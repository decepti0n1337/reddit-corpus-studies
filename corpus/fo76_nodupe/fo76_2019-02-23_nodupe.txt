This is awesome! A few questions:
---

---
What‚Äôs the difference between these cameras and photo mode? 
---
Will we be able to mark our camp on everyone‚Äôs map with the vending machines? Player encounters can be rare, especially when only one player is moving.
---
And a request:
---
Can you guys add texture changes to nuclear blast zones to mute the colors, apply a burnt overlay to objects, char the trees, and remove the foliage?
---
---
---
Why do people still say the bos are facsists in f4
---
Very good idea
---
I have a garage that's also ready to serve as a small radio station if they ever added relevant decorations.
---
Whatever man, whatever. Your posts look way more helpful then mine :D
---
&gt; Or was he banned and made a big deal and try to pull another "innocent player banned" post to push their anti-Bethesda agenda
---
DING DING DING!!! 
---
This is pretty much exactly what it turned into. And of course his tale of woe was picked up by gaming "journalists" and used as proof that Bethesda kills kittens etc. 
---
DAE another settlement????
---
Usually, yes
---
what is it with backpacks?
---
Sure, People travel to other vendors without knowing what is there. And if they were fast travel points (that cost caps), I think people would stop by. And maybe they won‚Äôt have to travel to it. Maybe all player stores will be accessible from some sort of network. Cause you are right, that would be a hassle. No one knows exactly what they are going to do with it.
---
My dealer sells them for 200c
---
Thanks!! If they implement this vending idea the right way it could be an awesome player hub and hangout spot!!
---
You say you don't care, but you act super hostile over it. Why? You should take a moment to think on this.
---
And I don't hate, or love this game. Its just a game. But people seem to put way too much effort in almost trying to make themselves believe things are better than they really are, even when they don't really gain anything from it. This thread was made to ask: Why?
---
Worked fine since release. Issues have only been in the last 48 hours. 
---
u do know the increased the stash limit to 800
---
Yeah that's why I say put all vendors in one spot to lessen the likely hood of griefers finding your camp when they see 3 or 4 people on the map gathered together in the same spot
---
Just spam collect and deal with it after the farm sesh
---
Forgot to add: whitesprings is centrally located as well!!
---
Even funnier, make dedicated lvl 90 sentry bots with no loot or XP come out to ‚Äúmaintain‚Äù the grounds 
---
I don't know much about it but I think it's mostly for people who want to start a new character without starting over from Square One
---
get the speed demon mutation, the encumbered walking speed is almost as fast as regular walking speed.
---
I am betting it will be like the binoculars, but you can take pictures with it.
---
It has happened to me before. Went on for about a day then just went back to the normal amount of DCs  and lag.
---
  Sorry, not trying to be negative about it, I would've loved for it to give some insight into his route. I wasted a lot of time trying to find him with that map, I don't think it's helpful.
---
Whitesprings is not that bad mostly because the train station is pretty accessible. Watoga is legit hard to unlock for low levels. Harper's Ferry is also borderline. Between those two that's 3 entire factions that aren't available to newer players, and enclave isn't really either. 
---
These are in-game items, you can pick them up inside the Emmet Mountain Disposal site (inside the tunnels, don't recall if its left or right one). Might be other locations but that's where I found them; be aware a deathclaw spawns down there too.

I find it pretty useful when I‚Äôm traveling with like 800 or 1,000 lbs on my characters back, can‚Äôt sprint or fast travel, so it helps make me move a little bit faster than without it xD 
---
I didn't. The thread very clearly says that its asking the people who Don't complain, who ignore the problems almost if they had to just to play. Sorry but I'd say the one who is "Impressive" here is you...
---
My bad dawg. I didn‚Äôt read the roadmap yet 
---
thanks a lot // much love
---
Oh sorry, British person here. Look up K-9 from Doctor Who.
---
Yeah whitesprings is cool, but the amount of times whitesprings gets nuked might make it kinda hard for lower level characters to travel to though not sure
---
Ya but what about that guy who got wrongly banned after 900 hours though?
---
Okay .. Dumb question. If I can now place a Weapon on a table ? Or a bottle on the floor .. No one can just come in and pick it up correct ? it will be a static location that no one can interact with? So If I want to display bobble heads on a shelf or whatever ... it can't be taken? 
---
I've been playing with speed demon so long *that's just normal speed for me now*
---
Hmm.
---
Now I'm curious if objects will be locked to specific orientations.
---
I.e. a Beer Bottle can only be placed Standing up, not laying on it's side.
---
This is insane. I'm worried it's my account or something.
---
Right. That's why they need to change the spawn point inside!! And make it free travel similar to vault 76.
---
Now that def would work
---
Millions of people visit my business every day!
---
(they actually don't)
---
See what I did there?
---
Watoga emergency services. At least ~25 each runthrough, with rank 3 pharma farma
---
Haha. That's awesome. 
---
Fallout 76s launch almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
What?
---
Omg im so annoyed i cannot set me gender pro noun 
---
Keep in mind that there are some perks that are basically necessary. If you are going to get and keep any mutations, starched genes and class freak are mandatory. For shotgun users a bunch of strength perks are pretty much required. For rifles builds you need a lot of perks in perception. I‚Äôm level 90 and it‚Äôs kinda annoying to move special points around. Takes forever and each time you do it, you miss out on a perk card.Go to nukesdragons.com for their perk builder thing. Then plan out where you character is going to end up....
---
It sounds interesting. At least the part of getting new abilities 
---
Are you sure games on life support get console ports even 7 years after they first came out?
---
I know you won't listen and you'll pretend you never read this just to keep on being angry over half a decade later but: Tribes and G:A didn't get "killed after making a profit" (that doesn't even make sense, if it was making a profit they would have keept them going). Both games were failures due to mismanagement by Hi-Rez. They got bad enough that they couldn't be salvaged. They learned from those failures and managed to create a successful game.
---
Yes, you like it or not Tribes and GA were indirectly stepping stones for smite, but smite was not the reason why they died, they failed on their own.
---
Yeah. Wat.
---
better late than never :P
---
This is the first thing in months that has made me want to boot up 76. 
---
FFXIV still holds that crown 
---
But I'm glad to see this. I hope they succeed 
---
I am all good, unless a scenario like this happens:
---
Scrap legendary weapons for scrap (let's say legendary scrap) that is used to buy loot boxed type legendary weapons AND this legendary scrap can be purchased with atoms.
---
Hey thanks for the offer, a friend already helped me out with it though, should've said sooner my friend charged me haha 
---
&gt;I'm fine with the atom prices, because it makes me be picky, save, and really work on weekly and daily challenges.
---
I've never thought of that. That's an excellent point.
---

---
Great minds think alike Odd that we decided to do this same type of post within a day of eachother ??
---
I mean: Thanks for the gold! But I have that feeling it was an outdated information.
---
Sounds awesome! Whenever I'm near Survey Camp Alpha and a scorchbeast shows up, I just run over to the base and repair the rocket launcher. It's so helpful!
---
Party at your C.A.M.P. after the update?  Lol
---
Heck the folks who like to trade could stand by their machine and sell stuff the way we do right now. I saw some guys standing in the empty candy shop booth selling and buying stuff the other day. It was a lot of fun!!
---
Load up your machine and sell stuff off your character!! Traders paradise. Lol
---
You do not have to pick a perk card in the same special you chose either, they didnt make that very clear.
---
You cant permanently screw up your character, at worst youll just have to wait a while to fix a poor choice. 
---
My end game build is different than my what I started with, and I even planned way ahead and used that nukes and dragons site.
---
Scrap legendary weapons for scrap (let's say legendary scrap) that is used to buy loot boxed type legendary weapons AND this legendary scrap can be purchased with atoms. Don't let this be monetized, please! üôÇ
---
Combat is better as a team, but there's more to the game than combat. For instance, going room to room looking for loot...
---
What's the gamertag
---
Death by cake?
---
Heck yeah! Where's my lunchboxes though? :O
---
Gotten responses know what got me still mad and confused awaiting the response to my reply but they seem to have gone silent when confronted with a well worded and not rude question.
---
No, there is actually a person in this thread who literally said everyone should be grateful for even getting the game, and for the hotfixes that have been coming out and how they haven't shut down the game. (this isn't really something anyone should be grateful for, this is the minimum that should be expected. Basic good treatment for customers shouldn't be a an extra or a bonus)
---
Ok, I have stayed silent on the game because I tried to hold on to hope. And though I do love the game, I have found myself getting bored...but here we go....I'm super excited to stick with them now, seeing there's more in the pipeline. I can only do "Feed the people" so many times before I say F*#$ it. (And that goes for all the events, FTP was the only one I could remember the name of)
---
Close enough whitesprings bandwagoneer, I would definitely wreck it
---
Wait till its on sale and below 20$, got it.
---
I'm sure it's my compass.  I've played enough to know how to read it.
---
You "epic gamers" are a joke. Paying for a promise of a game, getting scammed. And after all this praysing developers for delivering more promises.
---
My guess is something like the backpack CC from fallout 4. Customize the color, different faction patches, and then different add ons with minor buffs, extra pockets for more carry weight, med pack for increased effect from stims/chems, etc.
---
I've not played the game in a few weeks but all it's going to take to get me back is "return to last server" option.  Crashing will always happen, but nothing is killing the game more than losing your workshops or even worse the nuke zone you just launched.
---
Yeah...no. I hope to destroy your camp in a future lobby
---
Yeah well, doesn't the concept of tradeoff fit into RPG games.
---
I think they mentioned private servers to be a thing after the first year. I could be wrong though. 
---
Yes is it.
---
Close enough to get rekt
---
And how did you obtain the mutations? In game, grinding for caps and surviving  the journey for purchase? Or from a duper? Perhaps this character is a former mule?
---
This roadmap is beautiful. My only request is that we have matchmaking for the high level vault raids. Please Bethesda. 
---
I had this same bug on Xbox, I attacked them and they still stayed non hostile. 
---
I hope not I want to bathe in prewar money and now that the ideas been put in my head I'm gonna see if I can build over a swimming pool so I can swim in it üòÅ
---
Hey thanks, useful info, would likely be quite similiar.
---
Most browsers have a search function.
---
Money is just paper. Caps are just metal.
---
Credit can be applied to anything you deem to be of value.
---
Metro games use ammo as currency, so it's not a completely unheard of concept.
---
Just don't expect everyone to value it the same.
---
YongYea: Bethesda falls deeper into their hole for banning player with over 900 hours for no reason, as I'm sure you know they've done a lot of terrible things lately, but in case you don't it all started with them releasing a buggy incomplete excuse of a game with little to no content, then the whole canvas bag debacle, then they released novelty rum but misled consumers by definitely telling them it was going to be a full glass bottle, then banned many players for seemingly no reason and made them write an essay to get unbanned, then released a leather jacket as advertised but we don't like it so how dare they charge their price for it.
---
[removed]
---
I'm aware that could be a motive, but my point wasn't to guess at their intentions. I was just stating what it looks like from my perspective and the implications that has for making the meta seem less player friendly.
---
There is a small zone when you cap.  I assumed challenging the person in that zone around the work bench kicked on pvp.  
---
absolutely!
---
If I understand how it works my gamertag is EnchiladaJones
---
Im also in need of violet flux x20 so I can upgrade my excavator shocks if you have it, I have the 4 needed for the officer suit shielding.
---
I have caps and a few items that might be of interest, two shot gauss (not explosive and only 40th level)
---
A BOS chest piece, one star legendary-weightless, and dense mod
---
a few t60 mods etc
---
I'm on now in case you are, email at aggravation@gmail.com
---
Thanks!
---
Batteries Included, a INT perk.
---
What are you going to use as a slim jim?
---
Please have matchmaking! 
---
Common this is super cereal guys I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness
---
Maybe you can pick one mutation without any negative effects.  Kinda like a super power. It will be cool to see. I'm at about 140 and I can't imagine restarting at 0 unless it was really worth it. Ughh
---
I imagine you're not a publically traded company who can get in quite some both for falsely making claims like that?
---
High hopes for the road map , see if they follow through. Friends help the enjoyment of fallout 76 .
---
Dude who slavishly devotes himself to worshipping a videogame company tries trendy internet insults, news at 11
---
Eh, super duper doesn't seem worth it -- level 3 gives you only 30% extra ammo.
---
it wasn't him. the game just eats equipment. had it happen to me 3 times. lots of other reports as well.
---
Heres a fun bit of trivia: Fallout 4 the theoretical max was 65535 something, the decimal equivalent to hexadecimal FFFF 
---
 Im assuming its the same in 76 since a lot of the game a copy of 4.
---
In fo 4, if you passed that level, it would crash the game apparently.
---
That doesn't mean that every time they make something better, they also have to make something worse.  My problem here is that things can become worse for me, because of things other players do while I'm not even logged in.  
---
Yeah but the problem is. Aside from duping, caps cannot be made, only earned through actual game methods, that are modified by the game developers to balance the cap pool. Where as ultracite ammo can quite easily be farmed and created.
---
I've been saying that this was the plan the whole time, because it was obvious.
---
[Preston hates that] 
---
I never said killed after making a profit, I said they took people's money and then shuttered the game(s). "both games were failures due to mismanagement by Hi-Rez" okay and you are fine with that?  Yet you come here asking people "Why do you let these devs do this"  take a look in the mirror bud.
---
Shit left my game running while in my camp and I have 10 caps bounty. So if they destroy anything they won't get a bounty?
---
I wish they could have just appreciated you killing those cave crickets, I mean what would they have done had you not shown up? Thank god you were there to kill the crickets, what a savior.
---
Whos going to punish them? Why would the supposed punisher care if their lying about something that might actually be technically correct or straight up false? Whos going to call them on a lie when they don't publish any play numbers or statistics?
---
Only Bethesda knows and the sales narrative must read "Millions of players".
---
Jim Sterling *used* to be someone I enjoyed watching. I kind of stopped watching for a while. Then he did a video completely misrepresenting the situation. I'll never click on another one of his videos. 
---
But this will keep you on the hamster wheel for 3 more levels.
---
It's to flush all of the fraudulently gained  (source=exploit/duped) weapons, armor, mutations, XP, ammo, rare materials.
---
Also the re-entry price for suspended players to re-join.
---
for 3 months? no thanks. if you play often enough you get a bunch daily. 1 WS nuke run i got over 40 legendaries and most were 2-3 star junk.
---
Yeah, the hero we did not ask for but the hero we needed. RIP 900h guy!
---
all your base are belong to us
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more destruction to the buildings. 
---
Take a look at photos from Hiroshima and Nagasaki and while the more solid buildings aren't gone, they're significantly damaged. 
---
But this is trying to apply true logic to a game where irradiated and sloshy ghouls survive a nuclear blast so...
---
I found one valid ballot or whatever paper item.
---
So can caps.
---
Some people I've heard of here, farm 5k+ a day.
---
That is high yes. I manage 2h per day and that is split between TD1 and FO76 
---
can confirm lost my double barrel two shot this way a couple of months ago. 
---
Probably similar to CoD's old (or maybe they still do it) Prestige system. You hit a certain rank and boom, you get a star and you're back to level 1.
---
They could make ashland ky pretty easily,  7 minutes from Camden park irl. Plus right across the bridge for ky/WV on the way to Ashland is the big marathon oil plant (roughly 4-5 minutes irl) that could make for a nice new workshop
---
No plans, only mods.
---
Please please please please do this!
---
And make the budget increase with level, not just the budget cost decrease with level. I don't want to rebuild my camp every few levels to put more stuff down
---
For me it‚Äôs that they said months ago they‚Äôd introduce many of these features as soon as possible and in this roadmap some of them are still months off. 
---
 
---
[Player vending](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-02-fallout-76-to-get-player-vending) was announced back at the end of December/ beginning of January. It‚Äôs not due for release for another month an a half... 
---
Why tell players ‚Äúthis is coming soon!‚Äù  when it‚Äôs really not coming soon?
---
Thank you so much Bethesda! This is sick!
---
Can‚Äôt wait for all the delicious content üòù
---
I can craft speed demon and marsupial. 200 caps each. I can hop on now if needed (but might be going to dinner soon)
---
-thinks about linking Anansi's Goatman Story creepypasta-
---
-thinks better of it-
---
Take your time I'm not in a hurry.
---
Can't see it. Certanly not in Spring.
---
Time to dust off my Civic Duty Shotgun, IM GOIN HUNTING
---
Well, I've still liked playing this game, versus not playing it.
---
They are two very different situations: One is a new company that failed to make a good and self sustaining game twice, before they got it right. The other is an old company that just keeps on making worse and worse games even though they have the experience, money and manpower to do better.
---
\&gt;  one thing I liked about 76's quests compared to other MMO-styled games is that it doesn't pretend to be a single-player game where all the other players aren't doing the same shit, so I hope they preserve that design. 
---
They keep the player total pretty low per world, so there must be a freaking ton of worlds going on all the time. I wonder how much of a headache it would be to have a handful of different outcome worlds to reflect a couple major choices, and flush out smaller choices with NPC interactions. 
---
I'm hyped for more dynamic story quest lines regardless of how it's implemented though. Haha, definitely the content I've been hoping for. 
---
Woah man, I never said you were breaking anything.
---
I was giving an alternate viewpoint. 
---
I can‚Äôt opt-out of PvP if I just want to farm some lead. You can‚Äôt assume that everyone wants to PvP.
---
You monster!
---
I‚Äôve been able to scrap military-grade circuit boards, and so far I have the sentrybot helmet and the eyebot helmet
---
I seem to lose stimpacks and food that hasn't spoiled disappears every now and then thankfully I haven't lost a weapon that sucks 
---
Lol yeah that‚Äôs true, I kinda forgot how they portrayed ‚ÄúMothman‚Äù I guess it has been a while since I saw it. 
---
I'm excited for legendary player status in the summer! What if we can....duel wield! Lol just kidding. It sounds like it's more perk related. Maybe (oh please) we'll be able to combine lock picking and hacking cards? Hehe just a small inconvenience swapping out three. So excited about what's to come. The game runs incredibly stable for me now.
---
Bethesda tax, todd giveth and todd taketh away.
---
Hmm this looks promising, This'll be nice to come back to :D
---
You can sell 1.7k to the vendors. The only way you can be making that much from the environment (not selling stuff on Reddit) would be by constantly winning PvP battles (even still that's like 50 fights where you are fighting people above LVL 100.) Or cap bobblehead cap stash farming (but that would've been before the patches to stop that). Events don't reward that much so people would literally be grinding all day long to making that amount of caps.
---
I appreciate your TAZ reference.
---
If you pay a visit to the market76 sub, I see posts daily about someone who has found him and holding him up for other people :) Tracking him down conventionally is impossible, and the map which people love to link is actually wrong but no-one else has tried to map his path yet. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to that. Or a new area that you can only progress to if you‚Äôve killed her? 
---
I definitely like the idea of a next step in the story but you have to beat the queen to get to it. Otherwise it won‚Äôt make sense to new players 
---
What platform?
---
I love the fallout franchise as a whole, I‚Äôve played all except the ones for pc only and I‚Äôve played 76 and to be completely honest I was expecting the first stuff on the road map to automatically be in the game at launch plus the vaults even if they‚Äôre end game areas... I still think this game is like ESO in a way because at launch people were PISSED it was nothing like Skyrim and I personally think if we give this game more time it will bloom to be an amazing game.
---
I thought "drone" was the trendy internet insult, so I was just repaying it back. Yeah all of my recent posts are about FO76, but I like the game. Good trading system. All I do is go to work, smoke weed, and play Fallout 76 and VR games. It's pretty great rn
---
Xbox 
---
&gt;New Game Mode: Nuclear Winter 
---
Oh I wonder what it is... *cough* royale *cough*.
---
Me neither 
---
I met a lot of them through just doing events and having my mic on honestly. I feel like a lot of people are looking for others to do stuff with usually but maybe I'm wrong
---
I agree wholeheartedly about risk taking and trying new things, in an industry that dumbs down everything to the lowest common denominator, and churns out rehash after rehash of the same old same old time after time. The game is totally my cup of tea. I just feel like all of the backlash is the only way, it is the only way to make the decision making executives and management see when they screw up. And taking it easy on them only makes them sure they can continue to do the same things over and over and people will just keep throwing money at them.
---
I've read the roadmap like 3 times today there's so much in it. Everytime I read it I'm finding something new that just sounds awesome. I'm most excited about Nuclear Winter and the Vaults 
---
I've heard of Skunk Ape in Florida, too.
---
This has been discussed so many times. Luck doesn‚Äôt have any effect on loot. Having my luck stat several thousand high still gave me heaps of dogshit.
---
It did guarantee a 100% success chance for those pies machines though.
---
It does also define the condition of found weapons.
---
I am PRAYING that this system is refined and is delivered properly. Nothing needs to be improved more than the sheer collision space between objects and how dynamically they can be placed. Remember junk fences in FO4? Those things were nearly unuseable without mods. Us players want freedom and precision with this aspect, most definitely.
---
If you thought Reddit lost their shit over the survival mode, they would lose their damn minds over a second PvP mode. I am ok with trying to pull for all sorts of crowds, but I only PvE in this game and would be sad a out another PvP focussed update.
---
It looks like I need to revisit the game and get ready for more endgame!
---
I wouldnt really call it a guild haha but maybe, my tag is Dr.Whiskers 
---
People cannot steal your weapons. Stop spreading misinformation. 
---
Thank you. I was curious if that is what would happen.
---
That's actually exactly how I feel about it, dude. But I mean ESO got these EXACT posts about the game, and Zenimax kept throwing money on to that fire. There wasn't any end game content when ESO came out, it came out 4-5 months after, 76 is actually on track with it. Although they got a new zone and we're just getting some cut quests and new features
---
Think they said that before release. Could be different now. 
---
A charge attack with those horns would be pretty cool, too. I've been headbutted by a charging goat exactly one time in my life, and it was three times too many. That shit *hurts.* It'd be a good power attack, since you could telegraph the direction and maybe kite him into explosives or off a cliff.
---
Ive seen a few in watoga phoenix bot
---
I stand ready to assist.
---
well wonderful.. guess it will be another 80 levels before I get another gun like that.  I swear, all legendaries drop for me is armor and melee weapons, a legendary dropping a 3 star ranged weapon for me is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY, well you get the point, rare..
---
That's something I didn't regret paying for in creation club. Nice to have it for free and even more customisable!
---
I'd like to blame Bethesda, but people need to stop spending $10 on in game cosmetics.  That's how much real life cosmetics cost.  Everyone get a grip and the costs will go down.
---
I know this won't happen.
---
He's just going to be a vendor with some generic lines about legendary items, I highly doubt he'll actually shed light on anything.
---
I'm guessing the questline will do that.
---
Play something else, man. 
---
Very glad to see this. Stash items for CAMP? Asked for this a month ago. My evil teddy bear altar will be complete!
---
Now we just need energy weapons fixes, damn it.
---
Nope just calling em like I see em.  Go back to Smite, you provide nothing to this subreddit.
---
First one, 3 out of 7. That is, only 3 interest me. Player Vending, and the two new quests. Saying that, if the quests are anything like the base game it's going to be average at best.
---
Second one, NUCLEAR WINTER, doesn't say much about the mode so i'm luke warm on that. Legendary players don't appeal to me at all.
---
Third one, could be anything really, again, doesn't say much.
---
I‚Äôm sure it is based on how rocky it‚Äôs been since release. Hopefully we get an update on it. I‚Äôve still got faith, they seem to be moving in the right direction for the game. 
---
YeeeeEEES! New. Main Quest! Thank you bethesda! 
---
So happy right now 
---
I'm not the one that picked it up, but thank you (for all the random bags I've picked up over the months)!
---
do you have any bloodied super sledges/grognak's?
---
Which Paint?
---
Some daytime pics would be nice
---
Yep, would be great
---
Chew stick?
---
A problem is there is no 2 person verification in trading. At least with caps you can set how much you want and they have to match it to get your gear. You can't set it to ammo. So if you put 0 caps for the gear, because you expect them to put up ammo, they could just take the gear and run.
---
I didn't regret my full price purchase. The people who complained the most didn't want it to succeed before launch because they didn't want a multiplayer game.
---
NP, hope it helps. Always thought the pieces were part of a quest that wasn't put in. Then again the deathclaw sorta explains it. At any rate I'm tired and will now shut up : ) 
---
Once I hit 50 I feel like "nothing left to level up in, what's the point of continuing to play?" 
---
This. It‚Äôs a bit of a pain because you don‚Äôt have much flexibility vertically but you don‚Äôt need tricks or bugs to make it work.  You can put a radiant power or normal connection at the end to attach wires to as needed. 
---
pretty sure u need the plans..but try the market subs..u will most likely be able to get it at a better price than the vendors
---
I don't hide mine now. I love when people show up to my camp with my unlocked purifiers, junk extractor, and garden for anyone passing buy. I never had anyone attack it.
---
They listened? Doesn't mention NPC's, and have they fixed the server disconnect? The article seems to go out of it's way to explain the better servers, but did they actually fix it 100%?
---
I doubt it.
---
This would just make for a typical in game economy that is stagnant.
---
First things, prices would get fixed. If you don't list yourself at the accepted price, players will simply buy your stuff, and then resell it. So that's never fun. 
---
Getting players to interact is much better route to go with this game. 
---
I'd love to know too. I already have a full set of bos gear I wear, but I'd like to upgrade all the combat armor I find to bos before selling it. I can only upgrade legs to BoS and for the life of me I have no clue where I even found that, as I know for a fact I didn't buy the plan from Grafton. :(
---
Hey, would an option be to give us an option to "bake" words together, so they only count as one object? I feel like that could reduce resource usage
---
You can take extra perk cards and rank them up so you could have the same perk at different levels. 
---
Yeah us lvl 250+ need 2 feel a bit stronger over here 
---
the three bos combat armor plans are going for 750-1000 caps a piece on the market subs.
---
I totally agree with you, but it just seems like the hate for 76 took things to a new level. A lot of people that spread bad opinions about 76 never even played the game and I‚Äôm sure a lot of those people aren‚Äôt even aware of the current state of the game. I just wish we could communicate our constructive criticisms to help Bethesda make the game better without the toxic dumpster fire ignorance being spread everywhere.
---
Unfortunately, after level 50, when mobs keep leveling with you but your guns and armor don't, you're pretty much forced to ditch quality of life cards for ones that deal more dammage.  Otherwise you'll be farming a ton of stimpacks and ammo because you'll need a ton of it.  Up until level 50, my whole setup was for 
---
Maybe each decision creates a new game mode?
---
That's the only thing in the road map that had me a bit concerned.  Survival mode, nuclear winter, normal.  How many modes are we going to have.  A line between pvp and pve makes sense, but would rather see the nuclear winter rules (granted I don't know what they are) occupy a portion of the map etc.  I don't want to end up feeling like I'm missing out if I'm not trying to maintain a different character for each game mode.
---
Get ammo 1st.
---
Or set the caps amount to the same for both.
---
Hi Reddit. I knew it was way too positive here. Glad to know I'm in the right place

It mentions "new more powerful abilities" so if those are significant enough...

There are X-01 plans for all mods sold by Phoenix vendor at watoga station or watoga shopping plaza and you can buy the mods from the enclave bunker
---
Yeah new perk cards is what they mean 
---
Sounds like it is customizable so maybe we can make different kinds. One for extra carry or one that drops a mini bases or vendor. 
---
When is this estimated to be coming out?
---
Wow! That is one hell of a trip and it should be an awesome time. I am more familiar with the northern half of WV (Morgantown is my home town) but I can say along you‚Äôre way here are some places I have been that are good:
---
Fayetteville (new river Gorge area): Secret Sandwich Society, Pies and Pints, Bridge Brew Works (brewery only) 
---
Lewisburg: Food and Friends, Hawks Knob (cider), Smooth Ambler Distillery
---
Greenbrier: the whole resort is worth exploring a while, to eat I would go with Drapers for a fun but still casual enough experience. 
---
Other: it‚Äôs hard for me to tell from your map, but it looks like you will be close to Weathered Grounds Brewing which is one of the best in the state. It‚Äôs a ways outside of Beckley but if you like craft beer and get close it is a great stop. 
---
Any Tudors Biscuit World is always great for a hearty homemade breakfast.
---
That‚Äôs my 5 minute list, I hope it is amazing and would be happy to help with other recommendations!
---
Beacause Muh fallout 
---
If you‚Äôre Xbox I can put them on if you can give me the mats I might run out of.
---
really you sure about that?? you will note that I never said that he stole my weapon, just that I could only assume he did based on what happened..
---
seems odd that I haven't had anything disappear in 92 levels and many many hours of game play until this lv 132 guy with this odd behavior( for me at least) attacks me non stop until I kill him, THEN  my gun disappears.
---
maybe he didn't but it's suspicious. maybe it's a new glich you don't know about yet.. nah that can't be it, there are no gliches in fallout 76.....
---
so in conclusion, maybe your right and they can't steal weapons, maybe they can now but you don't need to be so instantly dismissive.
---
That would be shitty. 
---
I'm coming here from r/all so I don't have a dog in this fight.
---
These comments look shilled all to hell
---
Not denying that. I‚Äôm talking about the people who say shit like the game is complete garbage and refuse to even try and like it. People shit on the game even when it‚Äôs improving because it doesn‚Äôt fit what they want.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. Appreciate the offer but trying to learn these for a group I play with so more than just me.
---
I like to think there's not a right place on Reddit, just people with differing opinions.
---
I would love to play a super mutant or ghoul. That would be a fun way to reset.
---
I dont get why you can't still play bethesda games now even if you didnt years ago
---
I do like that they at least included that, but would like more
---
I sank over a hundred hours on this game, can't stop now.
---
If youre on xbox I can mod your armor for you, I learned all 3. Was kinda thinkin 20 caps per piece...
---
 but I recently contracted parasites, so I ate all of my food, and now will work for canned dog food. :)
---
You really are a dumbass aren't you?
---
It's THIS simple.
---
NO game should ever be released in the state 76 was released in asshole. 
---
I've had a few, but just sold them to vendors..  as a ranged build, I rely on action points for vats crits so I don't like walking around encumbered and sell useless (to me) melee weapons..
---
Yes! Both are loaded with history and small town charm, would easily recommend for anyone interested in history or even if you aren‚Äôt! 
---
Can you point me to the PS4 one?  That‚Äôs pricey but I‚Äôve scrapped north of 150 pieces so far.
---
the mutations are the only slow thing i agree. and yeah i ground for caps back in the day (this is my main character and the one i started with) i saved up for about 2 weeks and had 4k (that was alot back in the day) and that was enough for one mutation from the enclave, went and got it, was so happy!
---
forgot to take of starched genes.
---
lost all my saved up money in one go because of a stupid mistake, i was devistated, just turned it off and didnt play for a day, then got back on and got grinding again.
---
made the same mistake again later when carnivoire was preventing the seurums from working, lost another 4k the night before they patched in a fix :C was really sad but not as bad as the first one.
---
what i personally did was farm random mutations, 1 at a time, till i got one i wanted, if i didnt get it i rad away and try again, then kept it and equiped starched genes to give myself a little head start, i would say carnivoire might be the best one to grab first, theny buy a healing factor and get the rest in any order you need, alot are more for fun and fluf anyway.
---
and no i didnt dupe any, i just went around and made sure to sell to all the various traders every day, it was a little over 1k caps a day so i was able to get at least 1 mutation a week, worked my way to all my mutations from there, day by day.
---
though im sure now you could buy them in trade chat for cheaper, and i know alot of people dont care about getting specific ones and just farm out every mutation (i wanted to be specific to my build) 
---
A lot of this stuff should have been in the game in the first place no?
---
its $10.44 if u no where to look :D
---
The roadmap mentioned something about a legendary vendor and scrapping legendaries. No idea how it is going to work though. It's listed in nuclear winter, so it'll be added sometime in the summer 
---
No one ever looks up. That's why roofs are my best friend.
---
My new favorite is at Poseidan Energy Plant. The roof itself is "out of bounds" of the workshop, but it's easy to drop down from the roof to a ledge just above the Fusion Core Generator. I can sit there and snipe all day and no one ever finds me. 
---
Both forms or criticism don't cancel each other out. I think both are useful. I think they should have been more patient before releasing the game. And it's not just about this game, or Bethesda, but about all future games, all developers, the industry as a whole. They should if they are smart all learn from these lessons.
---
Wow, they couldn't keep to theme and only do 76 days? Unbelievable. I'm leaving this sub and this game forEVeR! YoU HEaR Me bEtHESdA?!
---
^(/s)
---
Now I can create a creepy museum with creepy dolls
---
We're currently in a fairytale Vault sim. The real world is totally fucked still so close to bomb drop.
---
I probably just don‚Äôt know how it all works. It has been my experience that when a new player comes into the area, it often resets the mobs.
---
you mean [YEEEAAAAAAHHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)!!!
---
You have a proof that they don‚Äôt? 
---
See how that works?
---
I wonder if this stuff has any connection to the Cult of Mothman, that Firstborn of the Wood stuff and the Lucky Hole Mine thing... I'd freaking love if that stuff people have been theorizing on is finally being built upon! On the left there's a board with pix of Mothman and a string going back to the map with big text saying "NOT HIM." There are some weird drawings tacked to that map too.
---
 /r/whoosh 
---
Pretty much. I never spec'd into terminals at all so I only do the level 0 ones, but they are still kind of tedious. I have level 1 lockpick but safe loot is mostly garbage and once I needed more perception points I got tired of swapping it out all the time so I just skip anything above 0 now and most of those too.
---
r/Market76. Use the sidebar link to sort PS4 content. Post what you're looking for and it won't take long to get a response.
---
Yes and those little green baskets too. I know those stupid things are plastic just like the golf balls.
---
Agree with the two camps. I was just thinking this too. There should be a small camp designed for mobility. The main camp should be more permanent like your rebuilding
---
You can plat it all solo, but the nuke launch is not fun solo, IMO.   Nuke launch is best you and 2-3 other people.  Yes, you can launch nukes solo.  I launched it solo the first time, but every time since I've done it with others and it's much better, 
---
Especially nice that they let us know about the legendary vendor so people have a chance to start saving those up before it gets released.
---
Both forms of criticism don't cancel each other out. I think both are useful. I think they should have been more patient before releasing the game. And it's not just about this game, or Bethesda, but about all future games, all developers, the industry as a whole. They should, if they are smart, all learn from these lessons.
---
Good call. I've got like a total of 30 now, some doublets or more. And I beleive, without any proof, that high luck increase the chances to get something good...
---
Interesting link, thx. 
---
I‚Äôd prefer people‚Äôs machines being accessible from the map, personally. My very cozy camp is at the top of the southern Seneca Rocks peak which means I‚Äôll probably never see any customers if people have to travel to it.
---
I‚Äôm hoping I can actually put cues and balls on my pool table. 
---
Straightjacket for the top, bowler hat is pretty common, then a walking cane for a weapon. You will just need to customize the face to have the makeup. 
---
Hey man, sorry, I'm just on my way home from a business trip. Will tomorrow work for you? I will work on the voilet flux :).
---
You can re-do the Wendigo quest. Easy caps. 
---
Serial key resellers are not reliable...
---
Your welcome
---
I had previously completely disregarded this game and just accepted that it'll never be what I wanted. I was so sad when I cancelled my pre-order.
---
But...
---
This roadmap has me considering picking the game up now! So props to you, Bethesda! 
---
I haven't read the books on Shub, are the metal faces we've seen on previous titles related?
---
I want all the haters who whined that Bethesda sucked and said they‚Äôd never play again, to stay out. Lolz
---
Based on your posting history, I see how much you hate the game. 
---
See any of those paid lootboxes yet? 
---
I've played for about 1000 hours and it took me 700 to get an explosive shotgun. I also had my gear disappear 3 times.
---
based on my experience and other reports, you can be 99% sure that it wasn't the guy. the game eat items on spawn and fast travel. nobody knows for sure how or why.
---
Hmm, the new features icon for wastelanders seems to have a little robot next to a vault dweller. Perhaps an automatron style follower feature
---
Somehow the game gets hungry and will take your equipped weapon when you die. Lost my Legandary All Rise that way.
---
^^^ What he said. I‚Äôve never seen a plan for X-01 mods. 
---
&gt;right
---
&gt;You can even turn my phone in to a vibrator, it doesnt matter right now. 
---
I... really interpreted that incorrectly...
---
The dent. That‚Äôs how you know. If it‚Äôs dented in, you can‚Äôt open it. 
---
Better: allow us to scrap the ammo or to sell it. 
---
Ahh, sorry man. I learned all pre patch 5, had to buy the arms at grafton, but I did find the legs and torso in the bog as random plan spawns (before I hopped 30 times for arms). 
---
If memory serves one was at the flooded trainyard in the car adjacent to the one with PA station. the other was on the first dead scorchbeast you see on the left in the final glassed cavern room.
---
The glass cavern one was very odd  imo, definitely wasnt expecting to see anything on a static dead scorchbeast.
---
The flooded trainyard can spawn a random plan, uncommon tho. Ive never seen BOS there again.
---
Its on a fan unit and this happens immediately upon startup with the console being on for less than 5 minutes. I play rdr2 and forza for hours with no problems.
---
Slower growth rates on crops.  Hypothermia.  Expensive camp movement. Reduced fast travel options.  Diseases stay till cured and are occasionally fatal. No slap pvp, yet teamwork is required to accomplish a lot of tasks.  Aid and junk drop on death.  Radiation damage going near water, not just swimming in it.  Frequent rad storms that dump rads to anyone not sheltered properly. 
---
Give me a punishing experience.  Why do I want this so much? 
---
Man I could not agree more!  
---
The basic WarDrum shouldn't have the cans on it, that should have been an upgrade
---
I spent a good while once trying to figure out how the heck to get into a trailer when there was some quest item obviously inside. All going around the thing in circles, trying to look underneath, etc.
---
So Metro series adapted to Fallout?
---
Most people upload images on an other website and then share the link in the comments section. 
---
We're also going to need new elbow melee attacks and the ability to launch from higher ground 
---
Did you reply to the wrong person?  I was talking about how duped items have permeated the playerbase simply by being near other players or looting anything.  
---
They are in game items, can be found in one of the mines 
---
I also thought your story was great... shared it with my wife.... She didn't see what it had to do with her.  I'll keep trying.
---
bulking the ammo would allow you to sell it. just like how bulking wood allows you to sell that
---
I‚Äôve gone back to glassed cavern a couple times. Those static bodies are considered containers so the loot resets every 24 hours. Plan drops are supposed to be rare but possible.
---
Now to just wait for the day after the first content drop for people to complain that  they already rushed through it and have nothing to do again.
---
On much current char, I looted a 86 bobby pin box.
---
Right. 86 of 'em.
---
Never argued on his behalf, I merely stated that, with time and knowledge, even something like 100k rounds of ultracite isn't that much of a hurdle.  This is merely grinding, and grinding is all about efficiency.  
---
I have nearly fallen prey to players hiding mass amounts if duped ammo in containers around whitesprings knowing most people auto loot all for time and so they pick it up without knowing it... why they do that I have no idea.
---
Another option is to equip Travel Agent only when you Fast Travel, then un-equip it when you arrive. Tedious, yes, but that is. Way around a re-spec and collecting 4 more LE cards. 
---
I‚Äôm in a similar boat as I‚Äôm firm on 4 Charisma points and no more. So I equip Travel Agent when I need it. 
---
Yeah well they made so many mistakes its like a comedy show. It really makes you wonder about their level of stupid. 
---
Still, anger lowers IQ, so I guess they had no hope. 
---
No i don't. I fixed it by enabling SLI in nvidia control panel
---
Finally make this game F2P
---
Too much in my backlog :/
---
XBOX
---
Comfy shack. Well done. I just recently found a perma home too
---
So apparently I'm lucky that it has taken this long for this to happen to me. Wonderful
---
Can someone tell me the point of survival mode if regular mode is already extremely tedious and hard enough to sustain yourself? 
---
How about you make regular mode work normally first AND THEN drop a mode that makes things even harder. Like the logic at bethesda is shockingly bad.  
---
It seriously sounds amazing. This whole year is going to be full of stuff. It's like Christmas all year round!
---
I love your point about human survivors but unfortunately the whole point of fo76 is the remaking of the civilization BEFORE all the other vaults open up, giving an opportunity to repopulate America.
---
Where? Where is this post you are quoting from? And how would one person's statement merit a grammatically incorrect post that infers there are hordes of naive gamers puttering around West Virginia?
---
I think it‚Äôs important to temper our expectations, but the roadmap looks pretty good to me. 
---
It's not acceptable, some of us have just moved on faster.
---
I take everything with a grain of salt because it‚Äôs never 100% til a month or less to release of dlc
---
What
---
Trading in cash can get you banned. May wanna Delete/edit this
---
It's the game. Has a habit of taking your best stuff. I personally think Bethesda is behind it. They just won't admit it's their programing.
---
Then again you find dead vault people around the map hinting some opened before 76
---
PLAYER BREWING YES
---
Well I enjoy the game a lot. The game is not perfect but is very fun. For beginner and play however you want and you‚Äôll figure out what build best suits you. 
---
But what is to stop the person from taking the ammo and running off? 
---
That might work if the people care about caps, but a lot don't.  
---
This game needs a 2 person verification for trading.
---
Don't try and rush through the main quests. Take your time. Spend your first 5 to 10 levels in the forest area. Pick 2 weapon types on which to focus, spec those out with the proper perk cards. 
---
X-01 and Ultracite both have a pretty equal amount of protection and they have their strong and weak points.
---
Imgur is the app most people use to share picture listings. They take all the screen shots then put them on imgur and copy the link and share it in there post with a title of what they have 
---
Have you turned Overscan off? It will be a setting on your TV. That was the issue when my screen was cropping
---
Same here. When I look at the map it cuts off part of menu and social and I can't for the life of me figure out how to get it to fit
---
Oh, and scavenge as many gears, screws, and springs as possible. 
---
I honestly feel like they could make RNG quests kinda like fallout shelter were you could go to the edge of the map and have a required amount of food n water for the trip and could ‚Äúfast travel‚Äù to a randomly generated area that could be home to pests, beasts, super mutants, NPC‚ÄôS good or bad (good) you can trade with em or kill them. (bad) raiders that kill on sight. Cannibals that lure you in and have psychological questions ultimately trying to kill you. And the map size is determined by the amount of food and water you bring...
---
I will try that
---
And only at the MODUS in the military area, good luck finding the jetpack or calibrated shocks. 600+ hrs and still need 1 more X-01 shock.
---
This is a close-range character with not-so-great damage resistance. Which one has better damage resistance, even by a single point?
---
The road map looks amazing while ignoring the concerns of players after the TSE nerf. There needs to be a balance between the focus on content and improvements to the combat mechanics. 
---
I realized I was spoiled by my TSE after I spent days and days trying to get one. But now all I can do is go back to being a melee build in order to have similar effectiveness. And it is crickets from Bethesda after that nerf bat gimped the game for a large portion of us. 
---
You are correct, some people used their own bunkers but most were flooded or had monsters. Those I think 30ish people lived until they started making stupid decisions or dying from scorched plague or scorched beasts.
---
People like you love jumping to the wrong conclusion.  It's not like anyone has accidentally dropped or sold a weapon before. No, never the players fault.
---
So, in conclusion you are wrong, but you spread your lies like they are truth. You dropped your gun, get over it.
---
happy cake day and fuck the haters
---
Oh i didn't think of a portable vendor
---
I have the same issue. Tried everything. It's just my TV. Skyrim SE has the same problem.
---
Yo they sold you a 60 dollar tech demo. And you thanking em.
---
Wow.
---
Players in the 300‚Äôs are very common????? Sorry. No. I‚Äôm level 90, 400 hours in. Seen like 3. I‚Äôve only been in on a few scorchbeast queens, but I check out other peoples level on the server. 200 level players are somewhat common. One or two per server.......
---
Have you played it?
---
I like the idea of a pre saved (quick swap) option. Or even an auto option, like open a armor work bench and it swaps out the cards for you...
---
It's so annoying 
---
I actually went to this spot to build a camp and it was taken. Someone had built into the actual structure, and I recognized it from reddit.   
---
Funny though, there's a spot that's like a 30 second walk from there that is one of my go-to locations now.
---
1. Yes.
---
2. He has them but they are not there every time like the other mods. It's still random whether he has them so it's back to server hopping.
---
3. I don't know.
---
This. People need to rein in their expectations by a lot.
---
Literally occurred to me as I wrote. 
---
got to dip into the deep well of frowning todd photoshops
---
It might just be your TV; it is for me. If you haven't, try changing the aspect ratio to the various setting to see which is best. I've heard the "point" or 1:1 is best, depending on the tv.
---
I‚Äôm just giving you hard time man lol all in good nature of course! 
---
Yeah the affix 100% accuracy is funny because realistically how could you miss hitting someone across the head with a rollin pin lol 
---
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of new legendary gear my man!
---
It's cutting off half the button beside menu and the letter l off of social and it is annoying 
---
You have awesome logic and knowledge. Good job decimating that strawman.
---
Its the exact same on mine 
---
With time, sure but it's highly unlikely under 30 days. If this SBQ spawned in some sort of queued dungeon instance I could believe it but we're talking about someone who had to server hop in hopes to join Scorched Earth. 
---
As for the suit cases or containers, they're limited in space so if he did aquire large amounts of Ultracite by some other means it was directly from a duper. There's no spinning this scenario. And his "false positive" excuse by passing from one account to the other is just silly. 
---
This comment in particular makes me glad I didn't shell out the cash for 76 that I was planning to.
---
Thank you. 
---
Be sure to pay attention to what you're told in the Vault. Also, follow the main quest to Flatwoods and explore thoroughly; it's a good tutorial area. Also, throwing knives are really good.
---
I would advise you at least have a rough idea for your build, check out the nukes and dragons website. Look at all the perk cards and see which ones you think will fit your playstyle, id advise you try to specialise in one weapon class. Melee is generally the easiest to manage as you dont have too worry about ammo and having alot of strength means you get more carry weight/ damage for melee. I think most builds should have a decent amount of strength, if you specialize in melee 15 str is a no brainer. Get lone wanderer if you are gonna play alone or will play alot without your friends its essential for solo players. When your friends hop online you can just switch it out for something else.
---
I have 2 4-star weapons, getting to reroll them definitely excites me. Maybe even letting me pick the augments. 
---
Yeah, but that's still barely anything. I think it should be like 2k minimum. More would be better, but 2k would be a good start.
---
/s?
---
The best solution for this teamwork you want would be to ask Bethesda to make the queen invincible if mobs or when it's in the air.
---
I've messed with my TV settings and nothing has helped
---
So it‚Äôll take another 6-12 months to get the good stuff into the game. If only Bethesda didn‚Äôt release the game until later this year... they would have had such a nice launch.
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping that they actually turn the game around because I want my $60 worth that I paid for.
---
Will have to try that, thanks for the suggestion. 
---
This is awesome Bethesda. I‚Äôm super exited and glad I stayed on this journey with u guys, and seeing this makes me super hype! I‚Äôve been with this game ever since B.E.T.A. and have more than 330 hours of game hours. I‚Äôm glad to see so much exiting new things and am happy to see the company still so dedicated to the game! Thanks!
---
They need to adjust mutations to buff all weapons, not just melee. Or add mutations for ranged weapon damage increase. There are 3 alone that increase melee damage. Only 1 of these 3 help ranged. So many aspects increase melee damage naturally. Only ranged perks that are specific to a ranged type increase ranged damage. 
---
Get yourself some weight reduction armor and knock on those damn doors. Gotta hustle for those caps.
---
Really brings the RPing factor to a new level. 
---
Ho yeah, you're right. Still, scraping bullets would also help a lot in this game. 
---
Sorry. Then we're in the same boat.
---
That would be great also.
---
BIRDS....??????
---
Someone found that junk node!
---
That‚Äôs what I was afraid of when they said you had to find him. 
---
After level 50 you‚Äôll be able to move SPECIAL points around so don‚Äôt stress too much about character build. Have fun and be in the moment!
---
Will do for 20 caps if on ps4 
---
I wish I hadn't lost the original remote to this. I have a universal remote but it only works for volume and on/off lol 
---
I don't think these are meant to be the DLC. This is more like when ESO had to rewrite the dungeons for added end game content. Don't worry, man. They'll give us our Craglorn
---
Where do I get switch plans I‚Äôm so mad I can‚Äôt find any
---
level 140+ and have no problems (fought many a SBQ event in it), this build does the most unarmed damage you can do as fast as you can without relying on sitting at dangerously low health (though it does do more damage as you ge weaker, but thats a bonus not a requirement). i have done various other builds and power armor and find this to be the most easy and effective build. does not require sitting.
---
and because of the high health and how stims work you find you only have to use one, maybe. instead of munching them like candy.
---
now i have done the whole super bloody builds with loads of damage but found many problems:
---
\-doing that in unyeilding armor for the super stats and radicool and nerd rage, etc. etc. makes it imposible to use that build in rad zones, you cannot get any form of effective rad protection without either power armor or a hazmat suit, meaning you cannot take that build into the most difficult content, so whats the point, one shotting regular super mutants? 
---
\-that build works in power armor but does not get the unyeilding armor bonuses, but that at least lets you take it into nuke zones, and emergency protocols does let you easilly stay around 20% health, the problems here are you still take rad damage in power armor so your constantly micro managing your radiation AND hp because your effective hp is 1/5th of total. your margine for error is very small and your constantly managing rad away and stimpacks rather then fighting.
---
\-explosive shotguns still work, just not as good. i tried the current explosive shotty compared to unarmed and found unarmed better in almost all cases, and when stuff runs up on you no fear of detonating yourself (or your framerate, lots of explosions and havok physics on everything is no bueno on framrate)
---
i have tried all of the meta builds over the games lifespan, not only is tis one far less complicated to play, you also dont have to deal with all the engitives of the others, resources, radiation, repairing, etc.
---
you just play. this is probobly the most effective comfort build in the game. 
---
Appreciate the offer but I‚Äôm looking for plans only.
---
Wgaf about any of this... first let‚Äôs talk about what happened with that dude that sunk 900 hours into this shitty game and got banned? 
---
Yessss freaking pumped for this 
---
He was a duper and his hours was forged. Stop listening to YouTubers 
---
That was a false rumor
---
Again, some details need to be flushed out.  
---
User logs on and sets up his turret firebase by Whitesprings Golf Club. He stays there and farms the spawns, using the turrets as fire support.  
---
All's fair, and each new user who walks by the Golf Club will spawn another wave of mobs to farm. His guns will shoot any spawns and pull at least some of the aggros, and be present as fire support. He can engage and manually tag any of the spawns for XP and loot. Kinda rude on one level, but understandable if he's present, actively farming the spawns.  
---
What happens if he up and leaves to do quests or just explore?  
---
His guns keep pulling aggros and even kills, but then other people farming the instance lose those aggros if they are pulled and killed by his guns, before those other users can tag them.  
---
That's a waste, and it's annoying to have to go to his base to chase down the spawned mobs. Also, if not teamed, his guns WILL damage other players. Annoying.
---
Told ya (;
---
Slow clapping is a really big insult in the UK.
---
I sincerely look forward to this game becoming something i can justify purchasing. Pls keep it up 
---
To that point, there are some unique weapon rewards from quests that are scaled to your current level, so its best to wait till 50 to finish quests with desireable rewards. 
---
I know some you can upgrade, not sure about all of them.
---
It's a pretty big insult in the UK.
---
wish we could
---
I've noticed this also and now I know why my mutation stats are all messed up. My ranged player sucks till I hope servers. Didn't understand why when I would move perks to craft, it made me have stats like a junkie with half the text gone till now. Been using gun fu thinking the card is newly messed up in patch6.
---
Really nice to see a roadmap after thousands of requests 3 months later. People should now start lowering their expectations. After that you should lower them more again. After that do it a few more times and just wait and see what they are going to really release. Don't expect anything, absolutely anything. Trust me, you won't be so disappointed after following these instructions.
---
Yikes
---
Some containers don't have an inventory cap...
---
I get you think he is a dirty cheat, and more power to you.  I don't lean one way or the other.  However, ignoring the fact that some things are possible to better accentuate your argument isn't doing your argument any justice.  Yes you can craft the ammo in large enough quantities to hit the 'ban' threshold in 30 days.  Easily.  I don't know how much he supposedly had, I am just pointing out that the threshhold is low enough to be attainable with diligence IF your making ultra 5mm or .50.  
---
To be fair a few of the ammo types could be attainable (ultracite obviously) with a goodly amount of work as most of the other types craft in much higher quantities than normal.
---
My source is experience at attempting to craft ultra ammo.  At a plodding and somewhat distracted pace I still managed to do ~50 crafts in 4 days of .50.  I don't recommend if you hate grinding, but if you didn't dick around like I did you could do much more.  500 in 30 days wouldn't be much of a challenge.  Just soooooo fucking boring.
---
This is what I was thinking was going on. 
---
&gt; incels call it? An NPC?
---
using terms like that on a genuine user make you seem like a...What do you NPC call it? Shill?
---
They didn't fix it. But I removed my mutation and re-added it today and things seem to be normal-ish. I'm pretty sure I lost a little top end damage but the muties die pretty fast again.
---
Definitely some weirdness going on with hunger or thirst making it better though.
---
remove and reacquire is the only fix that I know of.
---
Keep scrapping. I had all the plans but the arms when the patch hit. I made/scrapped roughly 70-80 arms to learn it.
---
Yeah, I server hopped for 80+ hours and seen so far jetpack twice and calibrated shocks not at all ... :(
---
wow that's a lot!
---
This resonates so much with my liver. 
---
Wow this guy over here within the hour. Some of our SLAs with some major tech companies are 15 minutes lol. One was (very) briefly 5.
---
3. on a table at sons of dane compound inside the bucks den. It‚Äôs a rare spawn so you might have to server hop for a bit to get it. 
---
I mean every bug needs attention and  I get that but I care a lot more about hits on hostile players sometimes taking 3-5 seconds to register and in some cases it seems like the server is just too laggy for anyone to do anything to each other. That is pretty much my biggest complaint about PvP.
---
Yes the x01 plans do exist, or yes they dont?
---
The legendary player feature needs to be added asap, like now, would make me want to play more
---
You might be able to get an app to turn your phone into a remote for your tv.
---
That is my old base location. Except yours looks much better. Mine was just a floating base. The only problem with this location is the odd wandering super mutants from above the cliff wander down. Plus I ran into an awful lot of flatwoods monsters there.
---
How bout we get a legendary drop when killing a legendary character (pvp)
---
Crocodiles.....??????
---
Exactly I agree this is why it can be exploited and abused 
---
Revenant helps giving 50%more dam if you really need a boost. That with some psycho will give you a nice jolt with sandman if available. Bobbleheads or a gunner mag can give you 30% more. I'm a stealth rifleman and thought, brother in arms. Gun fu isn't to be taken lightly either even at rank1.
---
Yeahnaw 
---
I rarely need anything other than power and volume. Just a pain to use the buttons on the back of my TV to adjust settings to try to fix screen size for fo76. Literally the only game I have any screen issues with lol
---
5 stars. Would laugh again! ;)
---
Save and seek tick blood. Eventually you can make tons of stimpacks out of them. Ends up being 1 tick blood makes 8 diluted stimpacks.
---
There‚Äôs seven different vendor factions of which you can earn a max of 1400 caps per day
---
don‚Äôt spend caps on supplies, save them for equipment. Use the trading threads on Reddit for that.
---
Two handed melee is pretty much the strongest thing in the game. 40% faster swing speed is a must on legendary melee weapons.
---
Third also, gather wood. There are lots of logs on the ground that you can harvest wood from. Whenever you walk past one, gather the wood; it's essential to building. Don't bother going out of your way, but get what's in front of you.
---
Last also, there are some places that are 'deposits' of iron, junk, crystal, etc. If you build your CAMP over these, then you can immediately build a harvester over them to gather resources over time. The junk one is really good.
---
They do significantly less damage than you'd get with Ballistics at a higher RoF, which translates to them breaking faster to do roughly the same or less amount of damage.
---
The way durability is calculated IIRC is only when a shot connects, is your durability subtracted. With that in mind, [the durability on laser weapons is absolute ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqMYBJqC8y4), and results in a high maintenance low damage per shot weapon, regardless of perks or build.
---
Top that with, at launch, plasma weapons actually didn't even work. You could shoot and the hit would not register at all. They got a significant buff of now consistently doing roughly 20/30 damage per shot due to the way split damage values work. To put it into perspective I think a single handmade bullet in full auto does 70 damage, so while the significant buff exists, they're still a trash can of a weapon.
---
Top that with not having any relevant or useful legendary effects or perks that pierce defenses such as anti-armor legendary effect, or the anti-tank perk, you're stuck with a weapon that has to fight enemies with either the same or higher DR than ballistics, managing a gun that breaks easier, and its a gun with limited perk based benefits besides repair perks, which are simply the bare minimum to keep your gun existing and to avoid the previously state management.
---
Also, sometimes when enemies are turned to ashes you don't get loot.
---
The few times I've PvP'd (I'm level 190-ish), I used an energy weapon because I didn't want to waste any of my relevant weapons durability just in case. Tons of enemies drop shit laser weapons so I just use them as my trash weapon. I know others do this as well, and while I won't speak for everyone, it's not the most uncommon thing to equip shit tier gear to kill people so you don't really risk anything.
---
tldr Golf Club
---
Okay I might redownload the game 
---
I just wonder what it will actually do. Kind of excited
---
Tldr. You're right.
---
I hope they don‚Äôt cost that much if they‚Äôre only for one type of armor. 14-1800 for four paint set I can handle. If one was 6-700 I‚Äôd be okay with that. But 2000 is too much. 
---
I can get behind this!
---
Shit, I'd give that a play.
---
Yes but the entire story is based around *you*. The game-story does realize other players but its focused around you and the overseer, not the other 23 people.
---
What did you scrap to learn them?
---
Personally I don't care, if they've got a bounty I'm checking for what we in the trade call a "Junk Pi√±ata". I don't pass  judgement, I just snatch bags.
---
Combat armor pieces. I just made the lowest level left arm over and over till I learned it from scrapping.
---
I will be sure to drop one of the umpteen weightless leather left legs I have when some one kills me. 
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing but no luck yet. I‚Äôve made/scrapped over 100 arms already.
---
Aye the RNG is a pain in the ass
---
Tyvm!
---
As explained above, it's rude to leave your automatic guns on to damage people and pull aggros away from other farmers, especially if you're not present yourself to do the farming.   
---
Some people are going to get annoyed at that level of rudeness to the point where they don't care about a wanted tag.   
---
To me, the system is working as designed.
---
No idea why me hoping its not something is getting down voted but alright then. 
---
I am so excited by this, my wife and I where so excited for this game but after early impressions where hesitant to play but after seeing the game on sale for like $30 we thought why not? And I have to say we are both loving it still not even lvl15 but we are so happy with what the devs have done so far and of course there are the occasional party bugs and whatnot but overall we are having a blast and seeing this roadmap only made us both more excited. 
---
Thanks for sticking with it guys. 
---
Don‚Äôt pick up anything you don‚Äôt want or nothing will spawn for 20 hours. Just keep hopping until you see the sack hood
---
I just hope there'll be something special for 100+ levels 
---
I can't tell, is this paid content? People are calling it "DLC" which to me means it isn't free... but the source article says nothing about prices. 
---
NMS was an indie game created by like twelve people. 
---
Bethesda is a massive development studio with over 200 employees
---
I'd like to see each weapon type get the same stat scaling as melee. Heavy weapons and shotguns scale with str, rifles scale with perception, pistols scale with agility, explosives scale with int. This would go a long way towards closing the gap between melee and ranged without nerfing melee. I really don't want melee nerfed it's in a good place imo just the others could use a little love. 
---
Why do you need to point out that he's "genuine?" Why's the comment getting brigaded? Who's paying you
---
So they're almost done the beta then?  I wonder if anyone will still be playing come full release.
---
Someone mentioned one of his spawn points is outside sunshine tidings co-op and they just capped that workshop first thing on log in and fast traveled back occasionally for the food and found him... often? I don't remember the frequency they mentioned but I know it was at least multiple times a week.
---
yup, detailed method shown in every 10 min vid on youtube
---
Ditto for me
---
There was never any risk of them giving up on f76, so I'm not sure why people keep saying this.
---
I like 76, but I dont think it or any other game can match what ff14 did. The amount of money and balls it took to reboot that game into what it is now just couldnt be done in current circumstances at the AAA companies. 
---
Camp budget is THE biggest thing for me right now. Stash, I'm okay. Please let me make more intricate bases :\^)
---
These are QoL changes that may be added through patches. The roadmap mostly gabe a look at new content and features.
---
Dang, for real! I‚Äôm not kidding but it‚Äôs seriously been WEEKS for me lol. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw a nuke there lol
---
Yup, I'll admit, looks like he was right. \*clap\* \*clap\*
---
Fallout 76 was made by a small part though, NGS Austin.
---
That image contains about 8x as much information as the roadmap.
---
Same here too
---
Lol yeah. I'm Australian so I say clubhouse. Same thing though:)
---
Maybe, maybe no
---
That is a good idea.
---
Thanks. It was rough there for a while. I work around 60-70 hours a week and when i come home i want to play my game. He played his and it became routine. We would be right beside each other but never talked to each other. We both felt neglected. Been together for almost 8 years now and since i got him to play it we play together every night and we always have something to talk about surrounding our adventures in Appalachia. He even calls me at work for help since I'm the fallout expert of the family. It has been such a great experience. 
---
Where did they say cash?
---
I unlock stuff if it is convenient, if not, I skip it without a care. I am low level so I should want all the phat lewts, but everything is just junk. 
---
I don't even use chems since I don't want addictions... Weird game that just convinces me to skip so much of the content because it isn't worth the hassle. 
---
See it how you want:) I reckon their 10 min vid isn't as effective as mine. Meaning they only do it for xp.But I'll leave that too you guys to decide. Thanks for the feedback though!
---
Level 172 here, really hope there'll be something special for 100 or 200+ ppl
---
No. Just the food value is increased
---
 Viddy well, little brother. Viddy well. 
---
Clockwork Radio would be cool
---
That goat beast is a MOTHERF\*\*\*ING Sheepsquatch!  SOooooo excited!
---
It's the LED lighting
---
They have said they are working in this 
---
How big was it in Fallout 4? Oh yeah - infinite. I had probably tens of thousands of pounds of stuff.
---
Agree with that statement.
---
Can't wait to go around RP-ing as the tourist that just NEEDS to take photos of all the exotic people (deadly, mutated ghouls and super mutants along with those suffering from the scorched plague) and wildlife (radtoads, fog crawlers, scorchbeasts, ticks, etc.).
---
Can't wait to go skiing!
---
Some of us had a whole discussion about it yesterday [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/atd4o4/what\_i\_really\_want\_bigfoots/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/atd4o4/what_i_really_want_bigfoots/)
---
I've server hopped 4-5 times a day since the release, 1 calibrated shock and 2 jet packs. Some other poster said low luck seemed to get the high end more, compared his wife a low luck build and his high luck. She apparently saw those 2 rare plans every third or fourth server while he didn't once. Couldn't find the OP to link here.
---
your poles flipped
---
I have been saving my teddybears for this all along UwU
---
Seriously? You think they might have just made that all up or exaggerated?
---
You getting downvotes because this isn‚Äôt controversial. What difference does it make if someone is level 60 or level 600. Still the same character.  It‚Äôs play time hours that make people better because more opportunities with RNG and getting end game gear. 
---
If Bethesda does what you ask. Then they are cucks to me now 
---
I definitely don't want melee nerfed. It's high risk high reward and the damage is where it should be. Ranged shouldn't have to have legendary effects to compensate for a lack of damage. They should just be icing on the cake not a requirement 
---
(Checks work bench) oh yeah I can craft a higher level one! What‚Äôs so good about it? 
---
I want a belt fed backpack that I feed steel and lead into and it auto feeds my minigun
---
My Rose's Syringer disappeared. Not that I cared about that thing, but gear do dissappear every pnce in a while. 
---
4 star weapons exist in the game?? How on earth do you find those??
---
sure, I'm on most of the time or just email me if you don't find me on a server
---
Laws. Laws that can actually be enforced. Plus peoples morals are generally better in real life.
---
Ohhhh auto crafting that would be intresting 
---
Level 12 here and I am having a good time, but have no idea what I am doing. 
---
i am getting worried now though because most things I meet take an obscene amount of ammo to kill.
---
I missed that post thanks I'll check it out
---
Only the Order of Mysteries rewards can be upgraded, all others are 'what you get is it'.
---
I'm level 141 and have only had low level incursions, 4 scorched lvl 20's was worst. Did have a [Mothman Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMoklmizEI) brought to me by a lvl 15 dude. If you watch only the I works as a start.
---
Nice roadmap but too late, seems like a couple more months till things pick up really well. Wonder what comea out to kill this during that time.
---
Yes
---
I spent $4k on a laser cutter and this is that company's roadmap: 
---
*   
---
Yep, *no roadmap* is the *tool company's* policy. Wish they were more like this *game company.*
---
Switch to melee weapons.  They‚Äôre really powerful at lower levels.
---
That's where people get lost? Just because you kill a legendary doesnt mean you instantly get what you want. You need to farm for your stuff and maybe need to kill tons of legendaries to get the gun you want. Just like farming gear in an mmo.
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying. I wonder why its only items from that questline are upgradeable?
---
Is it the great god Pan, or the great god...the Final Pam?
---
I don't have the budget for the Mothman statue, billboards or paint, but you can bet that I'm getting those once I've got enough atoms, I plan to rebuild my camp again at level 150 so my budget should be better by then considering I built this version of it at 100.
---
Shown every day on reddit, this week with people complaining or telling others to destroy their camps on it. 
---
I've been unable to play for 3 days, stuck in a Charleston Crash loop.  I also have a Ryzen 2700.  I've never used mods, uninstalled game/repaired/installed new drivers as of today (Feb 22).  I literally can't play unless I were to start a new character.  It is super frustrating as this is the only game I play.
---
&gt;I thought mods could lead to bans? 
---
Sure, but it'd have to be something that's cheating. Like wallhack or autoaim.
---
Normal mods don't, there's lots and lots of mods on the official modding site of Nexus.
---
I just don't understand a post like this.
---
This game is almost unplayable in it's current state for so many, and there has been nothing to fix these issues in the last few months at all.
---
New content doesn't mean anything if people can't actually enjoy it.
---
What game makes you hop servers just so you can complete a quest without a level 210 walking up and ruining the level scaling so you get demolished by anything that spawns with no chance to escape.
---
Why give us a favorites wheel if everything is so heavy and I can carry so little for the first fifty levels that I can't fill the slots with weapons of my current level.
---
Inventory management shouldn't be a chore. And just because you CAN make it work and not fill your stash after careful calculations it isn't fun to deal with, despite them raising the cap again, again...
---
I can look past an outdated engine and clunky gun play for an interesting setting and Fallout lore, and I do enjoy the concepts despite it being very hollow and containing no human interaction. 
---
Unfortunately though, there are, on top of the big issues, an endless amount of small annoying quirks that gnaw away at the enjoyment of the game. Graphical issues, mobs spawning T-Posed or running through walls. Inconsistent frame rates and servers kicking people whenever they fucking feel like it. Quest  notifications going on for tens of minutes every time you load into the game and resetting if heaven forbid you open up your inventory. JUST inviting someone to your team, if you click their name and move your cursor too quickly to the submenu it disappears until you patiently wait for the animation to finish.
---
People might think that's nitpicking but if it persists throughout every play session for hours it just absolutely rips away the enjoyment, what little they have managed to produce.
---
I honestly think a post like this hurts the game more than it helps
---
reported
---
I personally have yet to come across a container that has unlimited space. Lord knows I've tried stuffing missiles and legendary weapons in those and have to spend them around. I could be wrong.
---
Now by saying if he "didn't dick around" you meant sleep and bathroom breaks then sure. Maybe Bethesda did him a favor by banning him. Again, considering the amount of grinding for the Ultracite and let's not forget the other few hundred thousand stacks of rounds he had on him, it's highly unlikely. Focusing on one type of ammo, sure but several? Get outta here.
---
Look, I personally don't give a shit about this dude either way but what's fascinating is this strange infatuation with seeing Bethesda and this game fail by "fans". Wouldn't those who sub or comment here want to see this game thrive? No one is even bringing up the fact that ever since the ban hammer was dropped these servers have been absolutely stable. I played for 3 hours yesterday without a single crash. Everyone complained about the servers and dupers so now the issue as far as I'm concerned is resolved. 
---
Another thing no one is considering is that if you cheat and have zero regards for other players you are also capable of lying. Bethesda is already trying to swim up a river of shit so banning innocent players, especially one that has this much buzz wouldn't help. That leads me to believe there's more to this story. If Bethesda is willing to fold and redistribute a canvas bags at a financial loss they can easily unban this dude and be done with it. Besides, he's only temporarily banned. Play something else till this gets sorted. Bethesda didn't cut off his prescription. Just relax people. 
---
&amp;nbsp;  I just prefer to level once a day for the atoms while farming the tougher challenges in the lists.    
---
&amp;nbsp;  Wasn't trying to snub your method
---
&gt; I honestly think a post like this hurts the game more than it helps
---
Will weapon display racks be a thing? What about mannequins to display armor? 
---
Whats funnier is how they made giant things of every little controversy, they started an outrage of a fucking bag. a bag. people didn't even know the preorder came with the bag until the controversy
---
Also very similar to sea of thieves roadmap.
---
Vats is like an aim bot built into the game. It has this nifty thing that's like a critical bar and when it's full you can click a button to kill things with 100% accuracy. I mean if you're consciously choosing not to use a built in aim bot with a damage buff then iuno what will help.
---
Not yet, but they have said that they will work on making them better. Just a matter of when.
---
Nerfs make me sad. From another thread, Bethesda seemed to reduce at what health percentage the Adrenal mutation kicked in. Since I don't run a Unyielding build it doesn't seem so bad so far.
---
I think it would have been better to keep the starting point and just reduce what each level gives. That way it is useful even to the less crazy low hit point builds.
---
But I really like my ranged character and it wouldn't take much to bring her up to the melee's speed at killing muties.
---
Been looking for something good, but I have only found junk melee weapons so far. 
---
That is part of the plan. They'll let us decorate our camps.
---
Or just 
---
I am Legend 
---
to reference the book/movie title, which is also a post apocalyptic setting incidentally.
---
Buddy, autocorrect on that first line. 
---
Basically any nonsense on YouTube shitting on this game is just ppl tryn for clicks. And stir up shit. Along with 99% of the whinny children on this sub. It you like fallout you will like this. 
---
Pacifism stays on. At all times. It unlocks at level 5. U land a hit on he wrong someone with this off and they will grease you and steal your junk. 
---
This one I can't stress enough. LOOT EVERYTHING THATS NOT NAILED DOWN. lol you will need it eventually.
---
If having trouble with weight always check inventory for missles, Mini nukes, and plans. These can be heavy and stack up fast. Unless ya Wana use them for you character leave em lay in a bag or in suitcases around the stations. Missles are 2 lb EA. Mini nukes are 6lbs. 
---
 But above all HAVE FUN!!! üòâüëçGood luck!
---
Bethesda 
---
I'm not sure where to put this but there is an issue with the plans. I found the large tool box plan,yay but it is showing (known) but I am unable to build it. When I enter build menu in camp it is showing (find the plans to build this) I wonder how many I have left at Vendor stations for other players that I really haven't  learned. It is great that we have this if it is correct in that we have already learned it. 
---
Thank you
---
HA GOT EM
---
In case it wasn't clear /u/Valseek and /u/ladydevann, I would totally pay a 5000 atoms bribe for you to put it back in the store and another 1800 to buy it.
---
Level 12 here, never even seen a single one yet. Do they even drop from low level mobs or do I need to be at endgame? 
---
Vats does make a huge difference. So I don't think it would take any kind of huge buff to even the field. I really only have my farming speeds to really tell the difference between to two.
---
It‚Äôs cause you didn‚Äôt yell ‚ÄúI AM TUROK‚Äù at him
---
I'm hoping that pioneer scout robot (Pippy or something like that, he's mentioned as being ultra heroic if you read the Scout Terminal at Middle Mountain Cabins, I believe) will make an appearance, and be as beloved as Grahm.
---
Speaking of, I'd really like to know Grahm's backstory.
---
People are mostly nice, someone might kill you, take your junk, and blow up your base. It's part of the game, try not to get salty. 
---
Supporting a broken product and saying it'll be the biggest comeback diminishes their responsibility as developers to fix a released product that a lot of people paid for.
---
I understand you are probably passionate about the game and it's good you found something like that, but for the overwhelming majority of people these are glaring problems and we don't want the devs to feel comfortable in how this game is being treated, because they shouldn't. It's a broken mess. A broken mess some people enjoy a lot, which is fine and doesn't upset me, but this game is *objectively* a broken mess.
---
Yes!  I want to actually rebuild civilization, not just my house.
---
Still waiting on the hotfix to repair the broken "caution" bug that was introduced with the previous patch, no health regen or sneak attack bonuses. I still won't play until they fix that shit.
---
OK. So if I want to help, I will make sure that my important junk is stored in my stash. Use an orbital strike on the camp and drop a junk bag full of bones and salt.
---
CAMP Budget Increase, oh yeaaah. 
---
Does the customizable backpack come in canvas?
---
It‚Äôs just like getting it by standing next to radiation, gotta have that starched genes to keep em 
---
God I hope so

Idk if they fixed it, but for a long time, perhaps it's still a thing, there wasn't/isn't a legendary hunting rifle in the loot table. Lever rifles and revolvers/.44's are fairly common legendaries. As for weapons the ones I get dropped from most to least in order are melee, heavies, pistols, rifles, shotguns. Of the rifles, the legendary I get by far the most is lever actions. In fact, the only other rifles I've ever gotten are a half dozen hand mades and 1 assault rifle. No combat rifles or hunting rifles. I've only gotten 5 ish shotguns total, by far the least amount of drops of any category of gun. Some of them have been nice-ish but nothing great. Had a vampiric/explosive shotgun back before explosive got nerfed, was pretty excited for that... then almost immediately explosive got nerfed lol.

Happens to me all the time friend is like ‚Äúwhere the fuck are you going I said north‚Äù I AM GOING NORTH D:
---
You keep them as long as you don't take Rad Away. I use starched genes and class freak.
---
it's only the water at the water fountain near the tennis courts
---
Question, what if the old mutation doesn't show the positive effect
---
i also have had gear just disappear.  for me it was 2 pieces of armor.  both times, it happened after a fast travel.
---
i have caught myself accidentally dropping weapons before.  on PC, so when my fingers are flying across the keyboard, i some how manage to press a key combo that drops it.
---
even better, HITTING YOUR WINDOWS KEY IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT!!!!  :-(
---
No man's sky...
---
They said from the beginning that all DLC would be free, and it looks like they're keeping that promise.
---
The following I copy and pasted from the link.
---
"To that end, we‚Äôre excited to announce some of the new free content we‚Äôve been working on for Fallout 76 in 2019."
---
That was not my intention.  I was going for something like this.
---

---
Pay attention to places that you find Super Mutants. They are very good for farming exp and other goodies.
---
The only reason YouTubers spread hate is because it makes money. They don't give a rat's ass about any game. Controversies = Views. If a game is good, no one will watch your videos on it unless you are doing playthroughs. Doing playthroughs takes more effort than making a 10 minute video with random roaming around footage and basically saying "this game is bad hate it  because I say so".
---
Criminals won't.
---
Laws are just words.
---
You're choice on following them or not.
---
Punishment or not, still your choice.
---
I'll admit it is much easier to enforce game laws.
---
Thx only difference is that when you take a serum you don‚Äôt have the mutation‚Äôs negative effects for a while. Two hours, maybe? 
---
if you are "lucky" enough. ::grin grin::
---
The notes say something about you being able to restart with new powerful abilities. So I think it‚Äôs more than just a simple reset. 
---
Made all what up?  The roadmap is very vague.  It could be summed up as we are adding stuff, that tells just as much.  People are reading and imagining what they want, rather than reading and looking at how things have worked and been implemented thus far.
---
Have you actually played the game?
---
Completely wrong.  Much easier to take from people in a game than in real life. Maybe you need to change yourself or the people you spend time with.
---
I never said it should have been, rather that reasonable improvements have been made thank you
---
I'd have no problem with that.  I'm surprised Weapon Artisan *doesn't* work on guns.
---
I never said it should have been, rather that reasonable improvements have been made, thank you.
---
Well I‚Äôm not imagining being able to add stuff to my camp. Or new quests. I don‚Äôt need full details for that. Customizable backpacks? Didn‚Äôt expect that. 
---
Nuclear winter sounds fun. 
---
Other vaults that are raid level areas? Ok 
---
Justified.
---
Why would anyone trust you? Nobody cares about whining randoms, find a sub for pointless bummer complainers, you‚Äôll thrive there.
---
Done and done.
---
Maybe you need to have more than one viewpoint of the world.
---
Neither left / right winged.
---
Did you read ANYTHING I just posted? I even gave a list of specific issues I have with the game I could only know by playing.
---
But since you wanna post on reddit while being incapable of having a discussion I'll stop commenting now
---
now we gonna complain about camp budget
---
If I got +50 carry weight at the expense of 1-2% move speed, I'd take it.
---
It's stuff like this that made me stick around through Fallout 76.  I enjoy the game, for me it's my favorite Fallout, but it isn't perfect.  I can tell that a lot of work went into it, and while I disagree with some marketting choices like the canvas bag issue and the rum issue, that's not on the developpers.  Rarely have I been bored in this game, and that's only because my friends logged off and I didn't want to play solo.  This road map gives me hope that this game will get even better in the future, and I'm excited to see where it goes.
---
I'm really excited about the possibility of the big Wastelander DLC/update. I have some speculation, that I actually already thought about some time ago. Let's disect the info:
---
* **Wastelanders**
---
I may be looking too much into this, but could this be populating the Appalachia with human NPCs? Possibly people who came from the Capital Wasteland and therefore call themselves Wastelanders. If so, this would be amazing.
---
* a new main questline, new factions
---
"New factions" could mean either completely new factions or - better IMO - the new NPCs would "ressurect" the dead factions of Appalachia. Many factions left behing recruitment and training programs. We could easily see New Responders, Restored Brotherhood of Steel, Wastelander Raiders and maybe even The Resurrected Order of Mysteries. The new main questline could mirror the current one which takes us on the tour of the dead factions. The new could lead us to all of the new factions and establish new relations. We could even see some old holdouts rebuild. I'd sacrifice my third arm (don't ask) for seeing Harper's Ferry restored. And this all could lead to:
---
* a tale with true choice and consequences
---
The true choice could be the final choice of which new faction we ally ourselves with. Suddenly the difference between our characters would be more than level, equipment and perk loadout. The consequences could be that we end up permanently allied with players who choose the same faction. And while we wouldn't be permanently hostile to all other players, the allied faction could offer quests/events that would bring us into direct conflict with other players. And we would have to choose how to resolve it. For example: The Restored BOS sends you to secure the Big Bend Tunnel. But the players of New Responders are sent to secure it too, from the other side. Will you cooperate with the other faction or will you start a new bitter faction war to truly "secure" the tunnel?
---
I know that most of this is wishfull thinking, but I've been dreaming about what I've just described for a long time. A perfect next step for Fallout 76. I'll probably never see my dream fulfilled, but it FITS so nicely with the announcement!
---
We should....... but perhaps we wait a bit before we do.
---
I feel like this will be the big turning point in history for this game. I was starting to think they might have abandoned it after all.
---
That list of specific issues were mostly ones that were fixed in older patches, giving me the feeling that either a) You mostly learnt about the game by watching videos about it or b) you stopped playing long ago and missed on the improvements that came over time.
---
If it's a restart back to level 1 with some minor leveled power then it's just a simple way to extend existing content and force it to be replayed.  I sincerely hope they do better than that.
---
Proper scrooge mcduck style for all the old yins out there!
---
shut up and leave
---
If say closer to 16x the detail
---
And I think it‚Äôs just frowned upon cause we‚Äôre all gamers and we all have had to put in hours of work to better our craft and coming into the game instantly and just using the simplest exploit to catch up to everyone is just a little cheesy.
---
Finally gonna start grabbing pool balls and cues for my pool table, as well as tools for my crafting room, and food for my kitchen, toilet paper for my bathroom, and skeletons for my balcony if I can make it look like they're playing my instruments.
---
If we had gold coins I'd so Scrooge McDuck a swimming pool
---
Wait where do they spawn? I didn't know those existed in 76.
---
Lol TP for the shitter nice
---
I've wanted to do a diner build for a while.  I just can't seem to justify moving out from my current spot though.
---
I really do want target dummies though.  Something like at Marcus's shop in Borderlands where you could shoot at it and see the damage numbers.
---
I have a 1 Perception, so I have to avoid locks.
---
If Nuclear Winter is what I think it is, I am so fucking in.
---
Yes, thank you! The building aspect is the sole reason why I continue to play the series
---
Hopefully the new main quests from the wastelanders mean our original theory of people repopulating the wasteland coming true!
---
That‚Äôs my guess too.
---
I am surprised how much fun I have building camps. I‚Äôm fine with a budget, but I‚Äôd like to see it increased a bit. Building the most within a budget is more interesting than just going nuts without one. Also, have Atom store items take less budget and I‚Äôd buy more stuff. 
---
Hey, I may live in the Mire but I'm not gonna rely on the Mirelurk Queen 200 ft from my camp to clean my ass for me
---
Figured that was to good to be true.
---
Ho House would be much cheaper. Less classy, though.
---
Won‚Äôt believe it until it happens. 
---
The positive does not display at all after patch6, also it does not kick in until under 60% health, although is almost as strong as it used to be under 20%
---
Until the first visitor to your camp loots it all? Or will those items be locked to the owner ?
---
Yes i agree, but the space is somewhat way too low, the 800 mark is good, but "I" would be happy with at least 1500. Or make a different stash box with its own limit for weapons and armor only.
---
Here a thought because it's a MULTIPLAYER online game. SO These are MULTIPLAYER raids. Hard to keep up with. I know.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
They listened to us!
---
No, not made up. Just that it could be some totally bullshit that no one wants. Or that the induction of these new features and quests could just fuck the game the whole way up again 
---
I agree! They said from the get go that there would be bugs and things to line out because of it being the first Online Fallout venture. I‚Äôve been enjoying my time on the game, and some of the bugs are more funny than annoying.
---
Yes it is. I sometimes have to unequipped it before leaving a server so that it works right on the next server. It's an extra step but it works. 
---
Wow it feels like Christmas in February!
---
THANK YOU.  It only took me 1.5 runs to get a whole set.  Upvoted.
---
I said this and got downvoted last week, but I feel like without people complaining they wouldnt not have had as much urgency to do things like what they showed today
---
I tend to build in the low level enemy areas so I only have to put up a couple turrets and have more for the build. 
---
Did you notice the date is from 2017...
---
I honestly think it affects the immersion, not the gameplay itself. I had fun playing 76 but that stash was just way to low and made it really annoying.
---
Well, I was a Minutewoman in Fallout 4, I act like one in 76, and I'll be one on this Reddit then.
---
I don't think it'll be THAT extreme, but it will certainly repair some reputation
---
glad to help :)
---
Yeah, because Bethesda totally keeps their promises.
---
Have fun getting burned again.
---
They have been trying to listen just not many people gave them a chance 
---
So if you already had the mutation and took the serum would you just lose the negative effects for that time period?
---
JUST like other live service games, it'll come out, be finished in a week and back to no content. Trust me. (Not a diss, just facts) 
---
Most of the time
---
That's cool. They're not a 12 person indie dev team. 
---
Usually what I do is clear out an area, then replace Glow Sight for lockpicking and possibly demo expert or batteries included (depends on if I'm playing my stealth sniper or T-51b melee) for hacking.  Alternately, if the place is occupied by super mutants or scorched and I don't expect to need a damage boost to slowing enemies, I just swap in lockpicking.  I'm not in such a hurry that popping the lock on a crate is taking time away from anything.  
---
A decent amount of the time (maybe 10%) those lvl 3 locked containers have plans in them, especially the safes, toolboxes and footlockers.  I got a handmade rifle plan in the lvl 3 floor safe at Fort Defiance yesterday that would have been worth a few thousand caps a couple weeks ago.  I gave it to a lvl 23 that I saw sneaking around with a hunting rifle.  I think most of my camp plans were gathered from lvl 2-3 locked boxes.
---
You can open 95% of everything in the game with just lockpicking.  Hacking is handy if you're doing a Site run to drop a nuke.  I usually equip max hacker just to speed up the process (I don't like that power armor ceiling cheat) and make running back and forth more streamlined.
---
Hey if you're on PS4 and don't know what you're doing, I've been playing since BETA and only recebtly realised that building a camp in a cool location is not a viable combat method, so feel free to join me sometime and we'll fuck up our builds together.
---
Dude. Just because it is getting better, doesn't excuse the crap that has already happened. Don't be ignorant, this is why this sub is a joke. 
---
I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt tried taking a serum for a mutation I already had. Interesting question. 
---
What kind of ranged are we talking here? Is it heavy guns or pistols? I can offer pointers on rifles at least but really I think with ranged more-so than melee the build should compliment the weapon. Like with melee you get a whole category of weapons and basically the build is the same no matter what category you pick. Like if you're two handed melee the build doesn't change from using a spear to a grognak's I mean as they are in the same category. I don't think this is as true for ranged.  I'm not talking about altering my special stats for every gun but perk-wise I think Grim Reaper's Sprint makes a lot of sense on the high ap cost assault rife but if I'm running a combat rifle I prefer to just crit more often rather than harder since the ap cost is already so nice. Then there's the drastic changes like for the .308 pipe and pipe revolver where I basically just remove most of  my stealth agility perks and dump the pistol perks in cause... well.. it benefits from both so why not? Least it worked that way last patch, haven't re-tested my .308 this patch yet.
---
And then the manufactured rage when they found out the promoters got high quality bags, like it was even the same damn thing.
---
Im honestly mixed about the bag issue.  No one really cared about the bag in the set, but it was a bait and switch.  Eventually Bethesda fixed it, but it took a lot of complaining.  But no matter what, the bag had nothing to do with the game and people need to stop mentioning it on Twitter everytime there is a Bethesda post.  
---
Head..hurtsssss
---
Talk is cheap.
---
No, I feel you on that, I just hope by the third large update they'll have given us something substantial that's equivalent to ESO getting it's first update patch
---
For future reference, theres an easier (faster?) "hard way" to randomly farm for mutations. Go to west tek (fast travel, go around the building to the back door).
---
Go inside, theres a bunch of vats of toxic goo. You can collect as much as you want, and drinking it gives you 100+ rads.
---
Do that and stand next to a decontamination shower (theres one in west tek on the second floor). Just rinse off the rads when you get close to dying. Just remember after you get one mutation to start swapping on and off starched genes before you get in and out the shower (ill admit this part SUUUCKS)
---
Well you do but you won't. So have fun
---
B A C K P A C K S
---
I already know it will they released it with a wrong vision and they intended to fix it.
---
I haven't heard the news, care to link an article or video?
---
I think you can find Marquee Arrows at various Raider vendors.  Since Patch 5, Grahm's inventory has been pretty much identical to the one at Watoga Station.  The highly unique plans he used to have are missing.
---
I see a few people answer, but im just gonna confirm. They work exactly like a "wild" mutation gain. I personally run Marsupial &amp; Speed Demon those two are a must in my book, no matter what build you run.
---
Yeah, it's hard to explain. I'm actually working on a flow chart lol.
---
I've found some inside some buildings in Watoga, particularly the one associated with the Mayor quest, and also I believe in that Robco Research Center also associated with that quest. Searching around any place that is associated with the manufacture of robots is a good bet though, if you're hunting for them.
---
Why, because they made claims of intention?  Take what you have and what has been given so far.  Couple that with their claims, is it likely?  I would think most would be pretty reserved about any claims they make at this point. 
---
Find the secret room and steal 100,000 copies. Sell for caps or $ and buy everything you need. Bethesda will let you keep 1 copy of everything gained by your fraid.
---
Don't be afraid to die. Dying has almost no consequence in this game. When i started I was way too worried to die so I spent too much time looking for stimpacks and healing supplies. To that end, don't keep all your junk on you. Store your junk in stash box, dont keep too much of anything thats not needed for repairing weapons or armor.
---
I really don‚Äôt know what to say for a first time fallout player. It‚Äôs not a good representation of exactly what fallout is. And it‚Äôs not a looter shooter to the extent that destiny or anthem is. It‚Äôs kind of it‚Äôs own thing. Collect some junk, craft some gear, explore the world, and I hope you enjoy what the game has to offer!
---
Emmet disposal site is similar and where I got mine.  Pallets of decent radiation with a shower.  It's easier to fight your way into as well.  The goo at Westec is nice though in that you can take it back to your camp if you've built a shower.
---
Ok.  Update time as this is still pissing me off.
---
So I was starting to be convinced that it was something that was running on my PC that was causing it.  I spent the last couple of days systematically going through and closing stuff down that runs in the background, thinking that something is triggering these stutters. Through it all though, I forgot to check something basic.  I assumed that the FPS drops were happening on whatever was being displayed.  
---
I can go and stand up close to a wall so it maxes my FPS (to the max I have set it to in RivaTuner, 135 fps so that it falls under my 144Hz refresh rate monitor).  I notice the FPS drops.  The most common interval seems be 9 seconds, but I have see the interval be as long as 30 seconds.  Still, there are FPS drops and they are at regular intervals. 
---
What I didn't try was bringing the map up so that nothing at all was being drawn in game.  In theory, if there is something other than the game that is causing the FPS drops, then it should do the same thing in the map (or anything else on screen).   However, when loading the map I get a solid 135fps.  No FPS drops.  As soon as I close the map, the stutters at regular intervals return. 
---
So it would appear that something in the game is causing the drops, and it feels like it gets progressively worse.
---
I have uploaded a new video that is a couple of minutes long.  It shows the inbuilt current refresh rate of the monitor (running with G-Sync) in big yellow numbers, and there is RivaTuner's FPS counter with a graph.
---
You can view that video here:  https://streamable.com/3595x
---
You can see when I load the map, the drops disappear.  Then come back when closed.
---
Clearly something appears to be happening, but I am lost as to what it is.
---
I think I am going to open at ticket with Bethesda, but would still appreciate anyone elses feedback. Thanks
---
Go to www.nukesdragons.com to set up you SPECIAL build.  REFER TO IT OFTEN. 
---
Plastic is the most precious commodity in the game. 
---
Good luck and have fun. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard a lot of the negatives but I really have no expectations so if I dont like it I‚Äôll put it down until the next update. 
---
I pretty much only play coop loot and shoots but I enjoy the exploration games. Trying to expand my horizons so to speak haha. 
---
Appreciate the suggestions and see you out there :)!
---
Dupers are still selling them.
---
They also said atom shop was strictly cosmetic until they added one that did disease filtering and one that gave 15 hp
---
Melee weapons are easy mode but large groups of enemies will still hurt you.
---
Just explore the Forrest area for early levels doing side quests and events - no need and also not advised to rush main event.
---
Find what you enjoy in the game - exploring, killing, crafting or building camps &amp; go nuts on that aspect.
---
&gt; legendary hunting rifle 
---
supposedly added a while ago
---
got a real sweet laser gatling thingy today, health regen on hit + 25% faster fire + some other bonus, so that's nice I guess
---
they'll be adding legendary trading of sorts in May (check the roadmap) so now I'm stockpiling all legendaries. Applying ultra-light on armour ones to save on the stash lol.
---
 Unlike other fallout games, you have to seek out the background story of what happened in 76. So take time to read and listen to holotapes to capture the full story of West Virginia. 
---
I fixed it after a month or two of driving me crazy. It turns out it was my tv settings.
---
On a samsung tv :
---
Menu&gt;picture&gt;picture options&gt;[size=screen fit]
---
Apparently my settings were set to wide fit or something before
---
The game is selling for less that half off 3.5 months after release.  This game bombed,  predicting comebacks on just words at this point is a tad premature.
---
I wish that Bethesda would cut their losses and move on from this dumpster fire.
---
Bethesda is known for creating big and interesting worlds to explore. For me, that is my favourite part of the game. They are very good at environmental storytelling and you will find little hints and notes all around that flesh out the story of the people that came before you. All that is my favourite part. Getting cool loot from killing the monsters along the way is the icing on the cake. 
---
I have a super old vizo i should buy a new one
---
Put a cap on resources per stack, just like bottle cap currency.  1000 or 2000 or whatever, you can fill it up to that point for each scrap type without affecting main stash weight.  Then have somewhere between 500 and 1000 lbs worth of space for weapons, armor, aid, ammo.  Bam.
---
My first Fallout game was 4. People said the previous ones were good, but I couldn‚Äôt get into them after playing 4. If you like 76 I‚Äôd suggest trying Fallout 4 if you like to solo. If you want to play with friends then play 76. The storylines and NFC‚Äôs were really fun in 4.
---
Yeah, west tek horde can be a bitch, but you can avoid the majority of them by going in through the back entrance
---
It's a okay game. It's not bad. It's not great. It can still improve tho and their roadmap shows they are dedicated to making it great
---
Manbeargoat
---
Heh four hours heh
---
Same 
---
Keep the costume with you every time you kill l e it‚Äôs an easy 20 caps 
---
Against my better judgement I'll let you know I encountered all of those problems TODAY, which is why I even looked at this subreddit in the first place.
---
They're not adding very much and it's months after release..?? These "hurray" posts are comical. Kinda makes me think they're put up by Bethesda marketing. If you've done all the things, you get maybe a couple hours of quests over 5-6 months? Littered with bugs the whole time
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps

Pick a different starting FO game.

---
I've been tempted to smash those crummy platform camps that pop up in the back of the golf club during a nuke, but I really, really hate being wanted.
---
I put tesla coils on my power armor and just run through the entire club, with blocker 3 equipped, bringing everything out to the front parking lot for players that want to farm with some level of decorum.  I can zap pretty much everything with a practiced route and get 99% of the spawns up to an area that melees, snipers and other builds can share.  I'll just stand there surrounded by ghouls, blocking with my axe and taking the occasional stimpak while others gets their tags in.
---
I feel like it would be fair to disallow any camp placement within the entire whitesprings grounds (ie, anything with green manicured grass).  Of course some people set up nice little impromptu huts with chem stations, a rad shower and a stash box, but its not that hard to just make a pit stop into the hotel and miss out on a few nocturnal batons/troubleshooters robots arms/berserkers pipe revolvers.
---
I wish for this too. It‚Äôs frustrating because that cave could be super cool 
---
Yep.  CAMP building is my end game.  The more, the better.  More of everything!  Legendary weapon farming?  Psh.. I can kill stuff with a crafted weapon absolutely fine, maybe a two or three shots instead of one or two but the game just isn't that difficult to get all worked up about owning the best weapons.  Intricate CAMP building is where its at.
---
I‚Äôm here. What do you need?
---
I need a lot of Bethesda employees to comment on this post for a challenge
---
Please let the new cult be cult of the Mothman!!! Please please please please!!! Praise be the Mothman
---
It's good what they did . Tried to get the game in a decent place in terms of stability then jack out the dlc announcement .
---
You used jack so I had to 
---
Sounds like a plan, thank you! Big melee fan so this sounds fun! 
---
Great info, thank you!!
---
It has happen to me as well, i wish they would Hot fix it, but i guess they don't see it as an urgent matter
---
By fall I think the game will be in a very good place 
---
This was my first Fallout game too. Just have fun and explore! Also- read all the documents &amp; terminals. I‚Äôm impatient and hate to read so I skipped through them and missed out on a lot of lore and information. There‚Äôs no NPCs so that‚Äôs where a lot of your story comes from.
---
That sounds pretty cool actually. Excited to learn about the story. 
---
It shows that they're not abandoning the game, that's the real reason for the "hurrah." I mean maybe it's difficult to remember all the posts about how Bethesda will back track and shut down the servers blah blah blah. I'm just happy that the game is getting support. They have a really good trading system, just needs a few tweaks but I think that's really where game is, haven't played anything like it
---
We're all assholes in a world of shitty people 
---
I read a little about 3 but nothing about 4. I‚Äôll check it out if 76 is fun for me. Thanks!
---
This is the best I've found. Moonshiners 3-4 ticks then lumber yard another 2. The Butchers Bounty perk allows you to research each tick for more blood. With Butcher Bounty at max each server should provide at least 2 tick bloods. Which turns to many more stims.
---
Someone has to take care of these monsters! Thanks for the info! 
---
I‚Äôve heard that 3 and new Vegas were really good. If 76 isn‚Äôt for me I‚Äôll look into them. Hoping the games improves over time but I really have no expectations. 
---
Yeh a hot fix is so easy and a great way to keep things moving forward
---
25k caps
---
Ok, ty. Cutting it close üòÇüòÇ 
---
25,000, as I've just found out when I sold some stuff
---
Your welcome üòÉ
---
Did anyone else reach level 100 and the trophy not pop for them??? Any solutions? 
---
The highest damage achieved in the game is unarmed. That's with a build that allows you to run both blocker and barbarian which one/two handed miss out on. So it's by default also tankier than other options.
---
I was maxxed within 2-3 minutes of logging in that day....I could travel without my calibrated shocks excavator armor though so that was a win.
---
Or maybe believing a corporation who‚Äôs literal aim is to make money and not make you happy is more pathetic.
---
You are playing a poorly made game. There are better ones out there. 
---
theres a robot on the desk in the building overlooking the race track. 
---
I'm happy to see an actual survival game mode on the roadmap.  I haven't bought the game yet but will absolutely be getting it if there's an actual PvP instead of just dueling like the game trailer led everyone to believe.   I'm a survival games player and it would be so simple to just show you to shoot anyone that ticks a checkbook in their UI to allow pvp.  You can even still play with characters that want to do quests by turning off that mode at your camp or something so that you can't be aggressed anymore and you're put back on the radar. 
---
I wouldn't mind if any of the content was even in the game or working if i could kill players and take their stuff and build my little base.  Games like Rust, space engineers, Ark, and DayZ (mod...) Became so successful for a reason, for the investment it would take to just allow players to actually pvp, you create infinite amounts of player driven content which is what 76 seems to be lacking if i can judge that from reviews.
---
vendor only I think.
---
Seems like shilling for upvotes, gotta be honest
---
i know you can get a flachette mod from a vendor, i got mine today from the watoga station vendor 
---
Fucking bravo. Its fantastic to see such a huge company admit when it made huge mistakes and aim to actually fix them. Looks like its about time I picked the game up.
---
Cool, I missed that, thanks. 
---
Sheepsquatch
---
I knew Bethesda had it in them, but it sucks theyve spent the past couple months chasing their tail straigthening out the game. 
---
All of the problems could have been avoided with a proper beta and real nylon bags. Now its fixed and a lot of people wont care, but I guess it doesnt matter.
---
People still play this piece of shit? lmao
---
Thanks
---
I knew someone was going to say that I'm doing a bet with my friend to see how many Bethesda employees can reply
---
Good to know!  Thanks!  I'm been looking for a dense combat armor mod for my sniper, so I imagine I'll run across it at some point.
---
Why was this removed it's not a meme
---
All three of us. AND it drops right before spring break. A WEEK OF NERDERY. 
---
This old man is happy.
---
So, come up with a post that actually might get a Bethesda employee to respond. A question about the game, an idea for a quest or mechanic, a post with your well designed camp... just something with some *effort.*
---
Pfft, I was hoping it would be upside down :p
---
Got it
---
Rule number one man when a new game comes out.Ignore reddit at all cost cause all the little kids will bash the game and lie about tons of bugs etc to get attention.
---
Game wasnt perfect for sure but it was very good to play for me and 15+ ppl on discord.
---
Your very welcome. Have you reached level 100 yet? Did the trophy glitch for you? I made it to 100 and have all other trophies except that one. ü§Æ
---
They can happen anywhere from what I‚Äôve seen. They will say ‚ÄúEnclave‚Äù at the beginning of the title.
---
Lol, how long did it take them to break it- 2 or 3 weeks? How long do you think itll take them to fix?? :P
---
I agree, it would be nice if they prioritized hotfixing new bugs within a couple days of the patch
---
Nah. I just pick the lock, because I keep all three picklock skills permanently in my build. Makes it much easier when you don't have to juggle.
---
I did finally swap out the three hacker cards, though. I rarely found any real value to hacking terminals; its kinda tedious, and there's usually just a lock nearby anyway. 
---
Ahh... that is horrible!!!
---
I‚Äôm level 79... loooong way to go. If it glitches I‚Äôll probably snap the disc.
---
I think it‚Äôs going to be a portable workbench of sorts. And you can customize what it can craft.
---
I have checked this and while the CPU frequency does go up and down depending on the system load, when gaming it is at a constant 4GHz.  I don't think it is hardware related. 
---
Thank you though!
---
I dont understand why these are popular. My base is obviously better
---
I haven't heard of them.
---
despite the nice 100 day road map - the fact they haven't fixed this YET, after they broke it. It's caught me and screwed my grind so many times i gave up. When they fix this I'll come back.  I'm never ever going to preorder or buy any Bethesda game again, until actual player reviews are in.
---
Comrade, they're in the trees.
---
Hopefully Bobblehead Stand, Magazine racks, and something specific for the Camden Park Mr. Fuzzies/ all the teddy bear variants.  I assume we'll get armor and gun racks down the line too.  
---
Mr. Fuzzys anyone?  I found a stuffed toy sloth but scrapped him by mistake.
---
Ok, yeah this has me very excited. Haven't played in a while, this will definitely get me back into the game
---
Patience will help you a lot in various ways.
---
 Otherwise it's a fun experience, inventory management is a real thing but should be easier with the stash box increase.
---
I started with FO4 so FO76 was a bit of a shock to say the least. A lot depends on what you want to make of the game. There are those who are into the PvP aspect and those who are traditionalists and want to create a new world. 
---
There will be plenty willing to lend a helping hand within the game and offer advice. There are bugs and glitches galore, but eh, we're still playing so something is working. For many it's the community.
---
I‚Äôm curious about the faction PVP announced earlier, will it be included in survival mode or did I miss something?
---
You were lied to.
---
The answer is: 42.
---
You are not wrong, sir.  I was blown away beyond my wildest expectations.  It's clear that they're listening to the community and then some.  Between this and the datamined Rider (not raider) armor, the future is looking good.
---
I'm sure there will be a couple speedbumps along the way, but I've never played an online game with a new roll-out of content that didn't have some unexpected bugs pop up that needed to be hotfixed.
---
My biggest takeaway from the roadmap is that they're clearly committed to the game, which is quite a relief.  I've been having plenty of fun, and being able to experience the Fallout universe with friends is a surprisingly rewarding experience.  I never thought that I'd specifically want a low damage AOE effect for any reason in a Fallout game, but I prize my unperked one star quad auto tesla rifle on my rifleman and my tesla coil power armor mod for my melee character.  Nuke zones are extra fun with friends.  Honestly, everything in the game is extra fun with friends.
---
welcome to the game.
---
NOBODY outside was alive when Vault 76 opened.  Period.  It was the first vault opened.  
---
For you doubters, this is straight from the intro from FO3: New Vegas.  This is official lore.
---
-------
---
War. War never changes.
---
**When atomic fire consumed the earth, those who survived did so in great, underground vaults. When they opened, their inhabitants set out across ruins of the old world to build new societies, establish new villages, forming tribes.**
---
As decades passed, what had been the American southwest united beneath the flag of the New California Republic, dedicated to old-world values of democracy and the rule of law. As the Republic grew, so did its needs. Scouts spread east, seeking territory and wealth, in the dry and merciless expanse of the Mojave Desert. They returned with tales of a city untouched by the warheads that had scorched the rest of the world, and a great wall spanning the Colorado River.
---
The NCR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Hoover Dam, and restore it to working condition. But across the Colorado, another society had arisen under a different flag. A vast army of slaves, forged from the conquest of 86 tribes: Caesar's Legion.
---
Four years have passed since the Republic held the Dam - just barely - against the Legion's onslaught. The Legion did not retreat. Across the river, it gathers strength. Campfires burned, training drums beat.
---
Through it all, the New Vegas Strip has stayed open for business under the control of its mysterious overseer, Mr. House, and his army of rehabilitated Tribals and police robots.
---
"You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn‚Ä¶for the worse."
---
That's alot of potential bosses 
---
I have to pick them up. Call it OCD or just plain disgust I can't leave them just lying about stinking up the place... not to mention the incessant buzzing.
---
Wonder if anything in this will expand on tamed animals, I see that hint at robots hope one of the things is taming expansion.   
---
Like seriously I am tired of grinding for new animals every time my camp animal is killed by a random player that came near my camp.
---
Just block them and hop servers, takes 30 seconds.
---
I dont know how I forgot about most of the NV lore and I'm not saying o care about NPCs I just mist made this for the people who keep complaining about not having npcs
---
Did you post your base? :)
---
Lol yeh I know let's add a shit load of atom shop shit but not help the game 100% only 60%
---
exactly - like I said elsewhere, I think it needs to be described more clearly or changed to function like that.   
---
You can contest anywhere in the construction zone though, so. I think PvP only should kick on there. If you were halfway across the map I can't imagine it kicks in.
---
Yeh I agree fix the needy shit and I won't preorder any game after this lol.
---
I haven't seen roadmap can you link it to me
---
Pick an icon. In the atom shop
---
Not to sound like a pessimist but much of this should've already been in the game at launch.
---
Dropped connections and the bot stop one seem to appear a lot for me in the mire and watoga. They don‚Äôt offer that good of loot though. 
---
"Must have" been.  "Must of" isn't a phrase.
---
no like the little icon for for reddit.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-how-mods-and-private-servers-work-and-w/1100-6462371 
---
But the other day someone told me this game was unsalvageable! How could any of this possibly matter! 
---
Frustration aside, thanks for the roadmap. Look forward to all of this. I can only hope the ‚Äúwastelanders‚Äù update will have some actual NPCs and that will be tremendous in giving the game life and depth. I love this game but it‚Äôs damn hard to get invested with no character driven story. Backpack - will be epic if it‚Äôs visible as well as functional, while we are at it how about visible equipped weapon :D Definitely want to know more about ‚Äúnuclear winter‚Äù and the vaults. Thanks for the positive news I needed it :)
---
&gt; Applying ultra-light on armour ones to save on the stash lol.
---
Genius
---
Thank you for adding absolutely nothing to this conversation 
---
That‚Äôs my plan! 
---
I would be institute, but I'm not as concerned with bugs as I am with improving the gameplay and features. 
---
Hahaha I‚Äôll believe it when i see it
---
Petition to bring back the sex from new Vegas

And by that I mean the screen going black while a sound byte of really weird moaning repeats three times and when the screen comes back on you are well rested and short 50 caps

---
They could easily fix most stash issues just by adjusting weights. Handmade guns are about 18 pounds. Lower that. 
---
Make cosmetic clothing weightless it gives zero game advantage. 
---
Make all scrap bulkable. All of it. And make bulks weigh considerably less than they do now. 
---
Just those tweaks alone would free up enough space to not have to constantly micromanage but still force us to not hoard everything. 
---
I guess if you‚Äôre starting now you didn‚Äôt have to deal with as much of a stash limit, but inventory management is key. Find a strong weapon and scrap the majority of what you come across to get new mods. Also try to get down and get the excavator power armor as soon as you can. The process sucks but the extra carrying capacity helps a ton, at least it did for me.
---
Also any horde events you can find in the starting areas, join. You‚Äôre basically guaranteed a legendary drop from it.
---
Good luck!
---
I get it though, just sucks about the possible 12-hour in-game timer. That's a long time for someone who plays a few hours or less every day.
---
upvoted for contagious optimism!
---
Pretty early on in the main quest line you travel to Morgantown Highschool. It is an amazing location to farm plastic. Keep that in mind. My "in need of" component is usually screws and those can be found in mass at the capitol building, but there are a ton of super mutants there so I'd hold off till LV 20 at least.
---
Ah my bad. 
---
You know, you could reply to his post without sounding extremely condescdeing and maybe saying something useful. Hard to keep up with. I know. 
---
Plus the game was advertised as a something that can be completed solo or with a group of friends, so that means it doesn't have to be a group activity just because it's a "multiplayer online game". Again, hard to keep up with. I know. 
---
You have addictol still? Lol
---
Did you add me on ps4
---
I got a port a diner pie i wana put up as a trophy
---
Do you have any for sale? üòÅ
---
Yep
---
I get it, and what should have been the reality of it.  Others would have survived, either miraculously through luck and circumstance, or through thorough planning.  Still, 99.9% dead still leaves damned few living souls to interact with.
---
Ghouls, robots, and mutants?  They're here.  Grahm was a "lucky" one.  Perhaps he hid in a refrigerator.
---
People?  They all died to the virus and became scorched, or they died to the overwhelming numbers of the scorched themselves.  Conveniently just before the opening of vault 76, true.  So there are some too-fresh corpses.  But your Overseer found the cure and you self-vaccinated.  So did the other 76ers.
---
My first character was a totally unguided build using pistols for sniping and a shotgun to the face once I got their attention. She is not far behind the melee in damage she puts out but I little boost would be nice.
---
I have a new third character which I plan on going Heavy Guns but for now she is a sneaky sniper with a semi-auto combat rifle. So far things seem easier for her. 
---
Good point on GRS will keep it in mind.
---
You just want them to recycle [Gary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvSVuelB4o)
---
I really wouldn‚Äôt advise it, had mine for 5 minutes and it cured after 1 radaway. Admittedly it was my own fault. Was a waste of nearly 4K caps though. 
---
I was surprised also. It seems like an easy change to make.
---
It would nice if the raids were to scale with us or in difficulty but since nothing in 76 really scales with us now I highly doubt that the raids will.
---
 I'm going to guess it's going to be a mix of enemies from level 50 to 68, but I would love if the enemies and loot kept up with my character as I progress pass 50.
---
Change your gamertag to tickle_the_moonshiner
---
I‚Äôm getting on now
---
Imagine being in 2019 and still thinking Fallout76 isn't an irredeemable piece of trash (it is)
---
Hey, I loved Gary
---
Same here -- I think I'm going to go back and try to pump up my levels and finish the story after finishing up the initial offerings of Anthem. 
---
I started off as a rifleman, now im mostly melee. I couldnt make melee work for me in the early levels bc enemies would totally wreck me. Ammo was pretty scarce, so id recommend having at least two main weapons that use different ammo. I used a hunting rifle into my 50s, as well as a combat shotgun. 
---
Admittedly, I didnt make it easy on myself- I basically left the vault and went to the far eastern edge of the map, not knowing the enemies scaled higher the further south east you go.
---
Once I got to 25, I got the excavator power armor (PA), and pretty much lived inside of it till level 100. Finally got my weight under control and was able to use better PA like t60 and t51.
---
Currently Weight management should be a lot easier to handle, when I started we had half the stash space (so I needed as much carry capacity as possible).
---
Hahaha Gaaaary.
---
sure. becuase more easy to give a vendor what "sell" legenadry instead make a content where u can get it...
---
My go-to is Harpers Ferry for a "Dropped Connection. But I've been trying to go to every spot to get all the commendations back to back. I just can't remember all of them. 
---
The Raiders: I'm going to go out of my way to ruin your enjoyment as well.
---
Just level up a couple times and you will unlock it i suspect
---
nice catch. maybe robo companions? It does look like a mini sentrybot.
---
mini sentry versus liberator. 2 bots enter one bot leave. 
---
Lol :)
---
the church pews work as well.
---
Bye.
---
Have you tried this method? I honestly do not want to pour countless more hours into a game that is not worth playing let alone spend these hours grinding away with no resolution. 
---
" Their roadmap said that they have millions who average 4 hours a day. " lol...
---
THAT MAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE
---
Really helpful.... Let me guess you are one of the Bethesda faithfuls that believe they can do no wrong? Well I was and this is far enough wrong. 
---
Well I glad you where able to add some positive feed back to this post. Thank you!
---
Sorry was testing something out
---
while that method does show up  a bit  it dosnt hurt to have it pop up from time to time for the newer players, 
---
 I'd format it a bit better because on phone it looks like a giant wall of text ( which can scare folks off from reading ) 
---
thanks for the tips though , here have a upvote :) 
---
Visit the nukedragons site/think about what type of character you think would be fun.
---
Additionally, it takes a lot of levels to get all the exact perks you will want. The game gives you Perk Packs at level 4, 6, 8, and 10, followed by another pack every 5 levels afterward, and you get to select 1 each level, also 1 inside the vault.
---
If you can help yourself / play without it being too difficult, you can do what i did and WAIT until level 10/15/20/?? before actually levelling up. Then you can open all your packs and see what you got, then use your 1/level picks to pick the ones you didnt get for free.
---
As others have said, melee is pretty strong, and while i was already doing it for my main character, its probably useful for doing this method as well. (probably need to have a melee weapon regardless until you can get enough ammo)
---
This is why I say any real pvper will have the mutations that spike energy resistance by an extra 150 points
---
I personally dropped my earliest nuke at lvl 25 solo
---
I could be mistaken but I think the roadmap is for the whole year they have just released it at the 100 day mark but other than that yes I am excited to see how it turns out. 
---
Enjoy the feeling of being alone and wondering an anapocalyptic world not knowing what‚Äôs coming next.
---
Hang out at Hemlock Holes. Grant or maybe Gooney has a thing for acid....
---
Nice!.... What did you use for the bots inside the silo? Surely Troubleshooter something.... 
---
I've been a fan of Fallout ever since getting Fallout 1 during college in the late 90's, and a fan of Bethesda ever since Fallout 3.  I felt kinda lost and my faith in the game shaken after the TSE nerf with my main stealth/rifle character, but then I just started another character, learning the complete opposite of the spectrum with power armor and 2-handed weapons, and I started having a lot of fun again.  This is the first modern Fallout game where I actually enjoyed a melee character and used Power Armor extensively.  I largely just collected the various styles in Fo4 and never really used them.
---
I did feel like there was a long period of silence and open ended promises, like having a renter you really like with a good history tell you that they fell on hard times, a windfall is on the horizon and you'll get all that back-rent.  I don't have the cash in hand, so to speak, but I trust them based on their previous behavior and they sent me a photo of the check going into the mail.  I feel reassured, even though the money isn't quite in my account.  Kind of a weird analogy, but the roadmap made me feel like Bethesda isn't going down without a fight to re-establish their reputation.  I felt a sense of relief when I read this...
---
"*However, we know the game had a difficult launch, and we‚Äôve made mistakes along the way. We share in your frustrations when we do. We‚Äôll probably make a few more, and when we do, we will work to correct them as quickly as possible. Know that we‚Äôre fully dedicated to making this game the best it can be - and even more so, a platform for endless  Fallout adventures for years to come*."
---
Then seeing the roadmap, I was floored with how much stuff I was actually excited about, which was basically everything.  I was expecting to be non-plussed by about 50% of the game's trajectory, but the only thing I don't really care about is PvP servers.  Honestly, this might be the best "DLC-type" roadmap of any Fallout/Elder Scrolls game.  Far Harbor was very good in 4, but the rest of the DLC was ho-hum at best.  Same with Fo3, NV and Skyrim.  They each had one piece of DLC that was better than a C grade and the rest I had no interest in.
---
Thank you so much. Was my first post. And I feel like this is a little better than others cause it implemented bobbleheads, caps, etc. Hope you have a great day!:)
---
Maybe not destroy able from pvp but I think the environment should still be able to destroy your camp 
---
please!!!! asap. please!!
---
At first I hacked/picked EVERYTHING, now that ive completed all the content I only pick level 0 locks. I may actually swap them in when theres new content/adjustments to what can be inside that stuff
---
Each type of weapon has level variants. For melee weapons, better condition = more damage. When you start getting legendary weapons, try collecting one of each weapon type so you can eventually play with different builds/styles. 
---
I was a sneaky commando build so I used a lvl 25 non legendary powerful hand made for armor I used stand fast and chameleon and 1 lvl 15 troubleshooter leather left leg it took 30 minutes but was definitely worth it great challenge as well
---
Lots of good in there. I refuse to play pay-to-win games online, so I look forward to doing these things when private servers eventually happen. Until then, I hope the rest of you are enjoying yourselves!
---
22 for me but was with a 30 friend 
---
1 down and 987938453577772323 1* legendary rolling pins to go...
---
I want to be able to display all my magazines on my shelf!
---
What platform were you playing on?  Also not me, but ill upvote for visibility :)
---
yeah...that roadmap was for the full year not the next 100 days xD
---
not only is there no benefit (for anyone) but the griefers face zero consequence. they just party up, trash a camp then kill each other to clear all wanted. meanwhile the builder has spent hours upon hours farming and days building...and has to repair damage done ending up penalized for...playing the game.
---
Me too!!! 
---
Thanks for the well detailed response, I‚Äôll check out nukes and dragons! 
---
If you‚Äôre trying to get commendations you can also kill a scorchbeast.
---
this happens to me when i load in for the first time into a server, the junk is there but i can‚Äôt pick it up and after a while, it‚Äôs gone. haven‚Äôt experienced this other than when i‚Äôm loading in for the first time 
---
I'm on your team grandpa toothless... we shall befuddle and confound those law authoritays!!!!
---
As a Bethesda gamer since Morrowind first came out, i have spent atleast 200 hours per game since, with skyrim taking the cake at over 500 hours played. I will never touch fallout 76, or another game from Bethesda untl they make a new game engine first. Ive used the creation kit extensively (back when it was the construction kit even)  and not one thing changed between how you built things in Morrowind vs Skyrim. The exact same system was used, with add one software being the only difference.  How you entered scripts for any ai action/convo/movement did not change at all. Radiant ai was a lie, and anyone who knows how to use the kits knows this - they wrote one script and copy pasted it for every npc that isnt story related.   What im pointing out is they havent put effort into a game under their current management, they evn admit they just make the same game over and over. I dont pay for good ideas - i pay for a working product day 1, and continued support of publishers who publish broken hot messes is not how we as gamers get better games.  Period.  With no plans to change the old as dirt engine, idc what game they make.  IT WILL GET EVEN WORSE.  As other developers continue to make better games, the state of Bethesdas games will become blatenly apparent to anyone left as a fan of them.  
---
in f4 u enter with your backpack xd
---
Make Pipe Revolvers a legendary drop please, not playing until they are.
---
Why berserker? Bloodied has 3x the bonus for the same tension. 
---
if you‚Äôre on mobile you click on the subreddit, click on the 3 dots in the top right and click on ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù 
---
Personally I don't accept invites just because I'm always expecting it to be something nefarious after hearing all the sneaky ways people screw you over in this game.  
---
it could work if you had to decide between CAMP building and storage.   Choosing between a one level 2x1 rectangle that you can't do much but the basics but you can store a ton of stuff.  But as it is now a limited stash as much as it annoys me does add to the survival aspect of the game. 
---
If you could fix spotlights deactivated at login/leaving camp while you're at it that would be nice too.
---
Here's your participation trophy üèÜ enjoy!
---
Can you create your on flair?
---
I haven't had it happen until today is what made me question what was going on
---
adding stuff to camp, you mean like cut content being added back in...
---
New quests...really did you think they wouldn't add anything after launch?
---
Backpacks, fancy way of adding to the carry limit oh and of course atomic shop items!
---
I expected all of the above, I guess if you never played fo4 and/or actually thought the game was abandoned then things like this would be a surprise.
---
Nuclear winter, sounds like a PVE survival mode type thing...too little details to make a real guess at.
---
Vaults coming out as raids, known pretty much since launch.
---
Didn‚Äôt find. The sacrificial Blade mod for Machetes adds a 4th star (meaningless) and the Scorched Killer mods for guns (from the fire breathers) does as well (trash)
---
Whoa!!!an AAE!!!!niceeeee
---
Lol to all the people who think Bethesda will keep to that roadmap.  How many lies before you question the intent of pathological liars? Asking for a friend.  
---
I want to remind everyone to be cautious over these updates. I hate the Fallout 76 circlejerk going on in the gaming community too, but that only happened because the hype for this game was way higher than what it delivered (also biases before the beta was even out). I'm not saying to give up on this game, but I wouldn't hype myself up for a complete overhaul of the game anytime soon. I just don't want to see more of the backlash that's already going on in the community, I do believe that this game can be built up to be great.
---
Since arsenal reaction broke, I think bloodied and berserker are pretty similar if just looking at only raw damage per shot and ignoring the special skill increase with unyielding
---
had similar, got killed, picked up my loot (all bulk items), definitely picked up all, got to town, checked my inventory, had absolutely 0 bulk items.. kinda annoying, and the creatures that killed me, no bodies, no meat piles either...
---
Agree with this post because I rarely look in the atom store anymore for anything camp related. Could help push the atom store, well and some lower prices ;) 
---
But..u can buy stuff (trade bait) so it's like the caps are liquid and everything else is assets 
---
Please tell the cook i hate waiting, so no need to fully cook that chicken buffet.  
---
But sir, the other patrons dont want bloody diarrhea. ...
---
Dont care - its their fault for wanting it cooked i have to wait anyway.  Pink is just fine, you cant say otherwise. 
---
Trying! Lol at this point in the game, Im looking for specific stuff. 
---
yeah platform would help here
---
also you sure they don't show up in the "Recent" category in social?
---
Team play with rad sponge and ghoulish.  
---
Done.
---
Thank you.  I was going to point it out, but you did brilliantly.  
---
I agree. This gets an upvote. I work 40+ hours per week, am married and have three children. My gaming is limited and rebuilding after some kids destroy my C.A.M.P. sucks. 
---
It looks really, really great on the best set of Power Armor in the game. 
---
Dude honestly everybody was crying out about how shit Fallout 76 was when that ban happened, and completely forgot the exact same situation that happened like a month ago where 3 guys got banned, claimed they weren't cheating, and Bethesda came out and confirmed they were cheating. As soon as I saw that post I thought "this seems familiar".
---
OP demands platinum.  Your post is worthless /s
---
No but loving them $20 outfits.  
---
Yeah I was trading last week and everyone was talking about the forest camo jumpsuit..I think that goes for 12k..also add in some sentinel armor..u can only have 25k caps but your overall net worth can be wayyyy more than that
---
I'd very much like to be able to rank down cards.  I'm a melee AND rifle build, so not 100% on either but a lot closer to full melee.  I'd really like to back off a few points on my rifle perks and put them towards some other melee based perks.  
---
50% increased damage. cheap, keeps tension cause enemies can still hurt. Items cheap to buy cause nobody wants them lol
---
I've killed about 100 high level feral ghouls (diseased and legendary etc) but can't find the ones I need it's bullshit. They are hard enemies and I'm wasting a shit tonne of ammo and health aids
---
That's normal sometimes. If you just loaded into tje game it will show the junk, including the pick up message, and then hide it if you are not eligible to pick it up. Watoga Vendor's junk like the hotplates behind the counters do this.
---
Can't u search for them and friend request
---
Did you get your Cobalt?
---
There may be people in vault 94...one of the roadmap pictures shows two people running away from an open vault door...
---
Where'd you find the sloth?
---
Good idea actually, though maybe one vote per player per week or something .

I'm having the same issue with every other Bethesda game currently, where I play it for hours every night, forget to play one day, then never play for half a year and come back and make a new character. It also doesn't help that I'm playing on an Xbox One only cause I have friends on there, so my performance is pretty bad. I'll probably buy it on PC when it goes cheap again. I'll probably get back into the game in a couple months.
---
The servers can't handle that much with all of the players on one server
---
Bethesda is in a industry where not one word of propaganda is ever checked, bc class action EULAs prevent us from doing so. No one holds the power to make bethesda show their physical server rolls, and they know this, and say stuff like 4xs the detail etc. If anyone did, they would claim proprietary code to stop it. 
---
Alright. Thanks and good hunting!
---
Ouch that initial download

I've been collecting Teddy and suveneer bears from the start. Even at the cost of storing other gear, at least until the limit went up this week. And the teapot house, bird figure, gnomes....I knew it!! üêπüêªüê®üêº

Can I Barrow some burn creme?
---
Yes yes, I can hear your computer crashing already.
---
Does this have to be in the cave?
---
Like...if "I got a 100 levels, give me a trophy" is the only reason you play this game, re-analyze your life choices dude. 
---
i think you may be confused lvl 1 of lone wanderer takes 2 char rank 2 takes 3 rank 3 takes 4 
---
Same I feel alot squishier. 
---
Did you learn the arm ones from arms or all of them? I've scrapped 75 legs or so without getting it. I figured they pulled it until later. You definitely got it since the patch by scrapping? 
---
What is this landmark occasion that made it so great? 
---
Must have done well enough for microsoft to think it could move systems.
---
https://youtu.be/G4yjpYg92bM
---
That is also a good solution. As long as griefers can't upvote each other over and over to give false appearances, I think it would be a nice addition to the game.
---
Ya.  It's one of those odd cards that cost more than their rank.

Well I figured with all the controversy surrounding the game consoles with it weren't selling so they decided to lower the price for them. I'm just excited for this too because I just recently bought a 4k TV.
---
perhaps try xbox or pc, actual good consoles
---
Just had this with a glitching scorched at an amusement park. 
---
I think a lot of people abandoned the tiny house when the bulldozer patch hit.
---
Afterall part of the appeal of it was being able to replace the blueprint, but with the bulldozer patch that got easier to do.
---

---
I hear that she is but I still see a problem with using hunters. That being that most of the damage you take and things you kill are scorched (insert name here). So to me I think zealots would be better. But I have not tested this yet.
---
Do you find the way to fix that ?
---
I'm only interested in her. I don't have a team yet, so I guess I'm planning to kill her solo until I get drafted. 
---
Been searching for it. Done lots of uranium fever with no luck. You may need protective first but I can't find that. People keep saying Foret quests like distinguished guests. I've done that ten times or so with no luck. 
---
Shortly after the release, there were some posts of people building tiny 2x1 houses. I had that for a while, then did the 1x1 sky-house.. Now I have settled in a swamp where nobody seems to go, and simply built a fortress. The small house is nice, but I like having stuff.
---
Ok so I think that all of you are missing the point here. I love the Fallout series. I bought and played fallout 76 because I like the series. I was having fun in the game and enjoyed it a lot. My problem with the situation is that when I spend countless hours playing a game and yes earning all of the trophies along the way I look forward to earning the last trophy and completing the trophy list along with playing an enjoyable game. I was looking forward to the dlc and continuing to play with friends I met in the wasteland. What the root problem here is that Bethesda released a wonky broken game and if you spend hours and hours playing only to have a glitch or problem that does not allow you to progress or fully enjoy said game then there is a problem. I dont care if you agree or disagree with trophy hunting along with playing your favorite games. I do enjoy doing this and to not achieve something in game that I have achieved really makes the experience not worth it in the end. 
---
What level are you?
---
Well we aren't all made of money. 
---
I like the immersion. Walking around the Wasteland with just the shirt on my back never felt right to me :) 
---
I'm not really a programmer, or a 3d modeller, or animator, etc. but I have dabbled in those arts, and in "hobby" game development. That's why I view so much of it with scepticism. Because some of the things seem to be so easy they could have been released months ago. I as an amateur could have done some of those things, though I would struggle a little with it, it would take me personally some time to do it, but for professionals it would be a breeze. Yet patch after patch screws up more things. I just don't have the same kind of optimism as some of you concerning this game.
---
Thx..I didn't know how they were gonna implement the backpacks is what I was kind of asking 
---
I think it should be on how many good trades and how many bounty‚Äôs you‚Äôve had. If players had the choice, greifers would just downvote everybody without reason. Good idea tho 
---
Adding backpacks half a year after a disaster launch isn‚Äôt really a big deal
---
75, currently built melee, 400+ dmg without chems, secondary heavy guns, but haven't checked my damage since upgrading all my heavy gunner perks.
---
Oh, my bad. It was from one of the pics they released yesterday and I assumed it was a backpack 
---
Ah! I was confused then. Thank you.
---
I hope they won't make the legendary vendor spawn / walking around like Grahm. Just make the Legendary vendor fixed at some place.
---
we should.. but the perk thing is designed to keep giving yo the duplicates till you just own every rank.
---
i prefer to just own the earlier rank when i choose to get level 2 during a pick or if  a pack rolls one i already had.
---
i prefer if we could store the cards we won't be equipping in the builds we are using in the daily life of our gameplay. bring it back if the gameplay changes ie with finding a weapon or a new situation where i want one of the stored cards.
---
this is the kind of thing i expect truly before feature DLCs. just finishing stuff that is awkward or bugged or incomplete as features.
---
its in all my feedback posts
---
But someone else mentioned backpacks too lol..but whatever it definitely sounds cool if there are gonna be some..I really couldn't read all the roadmap posts while working today 
---
You can not release a game for 60 bucks with a 120 dollar version if it‚Äôs alpha quality and a year or more before you plan to implement basic features 
---
Ah, I just figured if it wasn't selling well why bother doing the packaging and such when people could buy an xbox one x for cheaper on its own. They have to think it will sell or why waste the time and money?
---
even more so when you consider there are other bundles for cheaper (anthem, battlefield V, nba2k19, ect) but maybe that is a difference in the consoles? I don't know what different versions of the xbox one x there are anymore.
---
What happens when i wanna divvy up bulk goods for a friend? Or what if  i only want to sell 6 screws instead of 10? Learn to manage your inventory better. If you bulk;put it away before breaking yo thangs. I store or sell bulk goods immediately. Storing things in bulk is a waste of plastic. If you fast travel everywhere instead of walk then disregard and whine away.
---
lol im being a troll, but some achievements are broken for pc and xbox too, it varies from console to console, it sucks especially when you want to 100% it. some events and quests cant even be completed for me and i need to complete them in order to get achievements, but until they fix it, R I P
---
Yeah I have a couple small buildings. The crafting building is open for anyone to use. It's pretty small, 3x1 L-shaped with all benches.
---
Also, someone mentioned bulldozing... I friggin hate that if that's the thing that attempts to auto delete my trees and rocks. If there's a way to disable that I'd love to do it.
---
My house isn't miniscule, but it's fairly tiny. I have a three-square foundation for my housey part, then a four-square for my garage with the workbenches (and flamingoes).
---
Have you ever built a massive online multiplayer game with the creation engine? Online games aren‚Äôt  easy to make especially one like this. They do have an entire studio working on it Bethesda games Dallas which there only job right now. Kind of like ZeniMax online only job is ESO. It‚Äôs going to get better. I played eso at launch it had a lot of problems and now it‚Äôs one of the best theme park MMOs on the market. There‚Äôs no reason to believe that the same couldn‚Äôt happen here. I think it will. 
---
Plus on Xbox the game is pretty stable. Now it just needs more content which is on the way. I‚Äôm excited.
---
This is what being lvl 100+ is all about.  I've been greatly enjoying a melee/PA alt over the past couple weeks, and I still have plastic and lead tagged for search just because I know anyone who uses a gun is going to be stoked to find 50+ lead and gunpowder in a train station suitcase.  A good friend of mine uses .45 ammo.  I get out of work about two hours before her, so I tend to pick up all the .45 that I come across and give her a gift bag when she logs in.
---
The other day I got an anti-armor/vats acc/faster reload handmade rifle that I was pretty jazzed on until I saw it was lvl 25.  I kitted it out with a suppressor, dot sight, hardened receiver and stabilized stock and long barrel.  I hung on to it for a couple hours until I ran across a lvl 21 sniper during a "Powering Up Poseidon" that was happy to share kills with me as a man-in-a-can with a tesla coil torso mod that was blocking and taking aggro until my new companion tagged all the mobs.  (I'm lvl 110-something so lvl 9-15 scorched xp wasn't anything special, but the guy was lost and getting smashed trying to complete the event solo, and I'm still looking for that windmill plan to complete the farm look on my camp)  At the end, I gave him a "come here" wave and dropped a couple dozen screws along with the rifle, and the kid actually got on his mic to thank me and ask if there's anything I needed in return.  I didn't want to ask for windmill plans, because he might regret giving them away later.  I just got lucky with the combat rifle drop, and I'd rather it be a great asset for a new player to really enjoy the game.  I just added him to friends and told him that I'm happy to mod out new rifles for him for free and help him level if he likes.  (I can respect a man wanting to make it on his own) Hopefully that rifle eases up on his leveling to some degree.
---
Well, i only had a map with brighter colors, im colorblind so this map helped me a lot because the contrast was greater, I took it down and now i can play without problems, im trying to make an official request to bethesda for them to apply this kind of help for the ones that need it like me, Id rather stop messing with it so i dont get banned or something like that, but thanks for the help! Have good night! 
---
Bruh, I'm not trying to sound rude here. But you aren't going to solo her. Now you might fight her with other people but not be part of a team but trust me her health is just way too high and there are just too many adds to do it anymore. When bobbleheads were stackable and TSE wasn't nerfed, sure it was possible then. My recommendation is just post that you're looking for a group in whichever system you play on and keep trying until you find one that you like. Back to your original topic though. She is a threat but if you're too busy dealing with the adds to get in good damage on her, what's does it matter if you have gear suited for just her? I hope that makes sense and again I'm not trying to be rude, just to help.
---
I would say customizable companions that can hold your stuff or fight for you, much like the Robot dlc for Fallout 4
---
Preach dweller, PREACH! All Gods in the building! If my hunch is correct and we get robot companions at the end of the year; I'm getting a 76 tattoo on my wrist and actually posting a pic.
---
Am I allowed to say thankyou Bethesda now without being shat on?! Lol Thanks for listning to your fans and I look forward to exploring a new broken Appalachia
---
The assets for at least a BoS flag existed in FO4 so shouldn't be hard to bring in. As for the the other factions easy symbols for flags already exist.
---
Yay I did it
---
"Hey, I loved Gary" - Gary
---
No, because you can just buy lone wanderer two more times for a rank 2 and one additional time for a rank 1 and then you will have the full set. Gives you something to do with your extra levels. The system is also pretty well thought out, it won't let you have duplicate levels of cards (in the end) and it only lets you pick enough cards to have 1 card of each level, so this was definitely the intended way to play. 
---
F
---
Well.. I watched it. Not impressed. Only 3 things stuck out and got my interest. The back pack, player vendors and the legendary vendor. Other than those it seems like hype for nothing being really explained. 
---
Its gonna take soooo much to make this game playable again for me. The stash is still is my biggest issue and im kinda pissed that i dropped so many legendary items and now we will be able to trade em in.... This game had so much potential and i didnt here anything about fixes and patches.
---
Im not gonna jump that hype train because the game needs more than just additional content. Yes it needs the content...  But there are more pressing issues to take care of first and until i can actually store enough in my stash to work with the games high demand for materials and repair costs...ill be stuck with a full stash and full inventory. 
---
Xbox and Bethesda most likely made that deal to bundle before 76 hit the market so they had projections on what they thought sales figures would be but were stuck with product after the game flopped.   
---
In Europe for instance there are some stores literally giving 76 away for free because they can't  sell the copies.   I even picked up a used copy of 76 for $20 at GameStop.
---
I think alot of people are jumping the gun here again like before 76 launched, let's wait to see the results before we get too excited. Also it's nice they apologized but that wasnt enough to cover all everything they have done, at least for me anyway 
---
No you're good man, I'm aware that it's probably an insurmountable task. I've fought alongside some higher level guys as they brought her down, I know what I'm up against lol. Where can I find a team? I'm on ps4, so atm I'm just trying to diversify my skillset so I can fit in with any crew to be useful, but I'm fully aware that a well orchestrated team is the best route. 
---
The stash is 800 lbs. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. How many legendary weapons do you need? I disagree content is exactly what they need however that doesn‚Äôt mean they are going to give up on improving other aspects of the game. I‚Äôm pretty excited myself. It looks like a good road map to me. 
---
Looking forward to finish my Fallout 4 playthrough until Survival mode goes live. I think this game gets waaaaay more hate than it deserves.  
---
I wish FO76 a successful year. :)
---
Inside Seneca Rock
---
My biggest issue would be the camp budget. It would be nice if it was twice the size but I imagine that‚Äôs in the queue of things to do as it has been requested multiple times. 
---
South side of the large pond to the north of Harper's ferry. It's remote and quiet. Also a very beautiful area of the map.
---
Be nice if bethesda would stop fixing stuff that ain't broken.
---
Yep I play on PS4 and no crashes
---
EA is another example of a greedy publisher treating its customers seemingly with contempt. I would also argue the fact the game has already been devalued in real world monetary value proves my point. This isn‚Äôt a fallout 76 specific complaint. I‚Äôm not very fond of the way microtransactions have suffocated games like a weed. 
---
I just cover the area in annoying foundations that nobody can wreck so the area looks horrible, then pull out what I need at the time, and put it away again when I leave.
---
It's like the Chameleon armor perk where when you're crouched and not moving you go invisible. I've also found it drains your AP while you're stealthed. 
---
Step 1 ban 75% of users with over 100 hours of game time step two close up shop and wait for actual apocalypse

---
I tried for so long to find a nice spot in the more but ended up building in the damn. The mire is one of my favourite locations in all of the games I've played. There's something alluring about radioactive swamps 
---
MY stash is at 1600 lbs of 800 lbs... I earned the stuff i stored. Im not gonna just give it up and sacrifice all my shit. so until they up it to 2000lbs im not interested I have too much invested to even drop it for a stupid reason like weight limits on storage that dont cause the game or servers any issues.... Its a storage... Does no good if i have to pick n choose between materials to build/repair and amazing collectables and my weapons or armor. Its bullshit. They can up it more. Its been proven the servers handle millions of pounds of items just fine with no hiccups. So yea. My statement still stands bro.
---
This is me with every RPG, didn‚Äôt touch fallout 3 for 5 years, didn‚Äôt touch New Vegas for 3, didn‚Äôt touch Skyrim for for about 6 months, and didn‚Äôt touch Fallout 4 for around 9 months. It‚Äôs not that itms boring, it‚Äôs just other games catch my interest and I usually wait for all the patches to tale place.
---
the last European story I heard said it was possible that the store was just selling for cheap as a PR move.
---
I am not arguing it was some massive hit, but that it sold decently for the niche and name it is. but that is just my speculation since we do not have the numbers.
---
Though it does seem to be a pointless argument since we both like the game XD.
---
Dibs on the top bunk 
---
Watch it be terrible, I‚Äôll laugh
---
Yeah, part of me hopes they'll stick to their guns with the no NPCs thing since I think it's an important part of the lonely (and kinda dark) tone they're trying to set with 76. But by the time Fall comes around and if it turns out they are adding human NPCs with real dialog, I won't complain.
---
but that's false, they have no problem with NPCs just Human NPCs they have a problem with
---
Free states flag!!!
---
But you said people should stop playing the game. Bethesda said players will be unbanned when they solve the duping issue. In future don't cheat.
---
I guess now we know... it is. It's part of the Wild Appalachia DLC.
---
Three questions, what's your age? What's your available play times and do you have a Mic?
---
do you have mods? 3rd party mods are messing with atom shop items apparently.

I wonder if Nuclear Winter will be handled like Metro when you‚Äôre topside. Such as changing Gas Masks filters and have degrading Gas Masks, I know they can‚Äôt necessarily make it exactly the same such as a cracking Gas Mask Visor, a Visor Overlay, putting a piece of tape over a crack, etc. But I sure do hope it‚Äôs like that. I would‚Äôt mind it, sadly there‚Äôs no use for an actual subway system like in Fo3 and Fo4. But one can hope. 
---
I have never duped. Can you read? I‚Äôve never had that amount of anything. I‚Äôve never weight glitched. I‚Äôve never xp glitched. Are you seriously going to act like an infant because I said don‚Äôt play the game. This is a prime example of why I said that. As SOOO MANY people have said BGS is able to see exactly what‚Äôs in a persons inventory and everything that has been, so either I‚Äôm lying, or they‚Äôre incompetent - you think I would make a post bitching and trying to show people what they‚Äôre doing if I‚Äôm lying? In future remove your head from your ass before commenting on something you know nothing about. 
---
Found out today, I got banned Monday, for the same excuse. Having 100,00 of rare in game item(s). Which I never had any of. Some guy dropped a lot of nukas at my feet once, looked in the bag, it was over 300k, I split those with a bud, but NEVER picked them up on my main, just my second account. Funny thing is, my second account, is still able to log on. Never duped. And reported the two guys I knew were duping. I was lvl 170+ with over 500 hours. Heck, my hubs, who got over 100k shotgun ammo from some guy, is still able to log on. Hes lvl 130+.. Know ain't no one gonna believe me, but I just want my words out there. 
---
the sillynannys 
---
Thats fair. I wosh i hadn't either. But im stuck with full stash and full inv. So my character waits in limbo until i can store it somewhere. I dont play with anyone so I am not gonna make a mule character. 
---
Good, maybe people will quit TSE‚Äôing me at a workshop I own where they can take what they want and I‚Äôm waving at them like a dumbass.

Nuclear winter. Nuclear Winter. NuClEaR wInTeR. NUCLEAR WINTER!!!

I am going to direct you [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as7w92/i_got_banned_info_threadmegathread/) more specifically:
---
&gt; People have no reason to believe you, and there is simply no way to  prove your innocence to Reddit. Frankly, most people never will believe  you. If you post, accept that and don't get all surprised-pikachu on us  when people don't believe you.

Is that a console thing? I play 1-3 hours a day and I haven‚Äôt been dc‚Äôd in probably 2 months. I‚Äôm on PC

Here is my route üòÅ

1 - Enclave inside the service entrance of the bunker (must have completed bunker buster to access this vendor).

2 - A short walk to Whitesprings Train Station

3 - Fast Travel to Watoga Train Station 
---
4 - Walk to SuperDuper Mart (it's in Watoga)
---
5 - Fast Travel to Harper's Ferry for the vendor there 
---
6 - Fast Travel to Pleasant Valley Train Station
---
7 - Fast Travel to Morgantown Trainstation
---
‚ù§Ô∏è 
---
Others may have a more efficient route. 
---
First would require new animations to be made which would probably be a lot more work than it's worth.
---
Second would just be yet another mod that people have but only need so rarely that they wouldn't have it equipped normally.
---
Third could open up to letting people go places they shouldn't because the world wasn't designed for that in mind. Though the game does have jetpack so not sure it would be a huge issue.
---
Just get rid of some stuff. When mine gets full I just make bulk mats and sell them for caps. I make a lot of caps doing that. 
---
everything's fine now guys!!! hahahah can you believe all that *manufactured* hate this game got, can't wait to see some youtubers eat crow!! OMG backpacks!!
---
I think he's lying
---
You can't reduce the value of the game after it launches unless they stop running the servers - the price dropping actually INCREASES the value, as the play value per dollar goes up for those who buy it. Them dropping the price does not rob you of anything - everything you paid for is still there, same as at launch. Even at 60 bucks the game still costs far less than a dollar per hour of content. I seriously doubt any other game released in the last few years is much better than that, and most are far worse. 
---
I don't disagree about micro transactions, but as long as the game you paid for gives you a decent amount of fun per dollar, they don't directly devalue the game as a whole. 
---
Also, they aren't always bad. Look at purely microtransaction driven games like Star Trek Online. They have no other means of generating income, and manage to give you a great game even if you don't pay a dime. It can be done, it's just that some companies either don't understand how to do it or can't be bothered to try (like EA). 
---
Sometimes if you go into their inventory they'll have like 4 or 5 pounds of something invisible and I wonder if that's the legendary it's housing
---
You weren't banned for duping, you were banned for having an unattainable amount of items. Clearly you did something to trigger this. Bit ironic of you to call me out, when your last few posts regarding fallout 76 have been shitting on it. If you really believe you were banned unfairly email Bethesda and explain your situation. When you make low effort comments telling people to stop playing or how much you hate this game, you come across as a troll.
---
No idea unfortunately.  It was this lil [purple](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Souvenir_sloth_toy) guy.  I still have yet to play all the Fallout 4 DLCs so I had no idea he was from Nuka World.  Can confirm they are in 76 however.
---
There will come a point where you just *know* where all the spawns are. In Watoga, bet it's in the gym
---
PS4
---
You could have just said "I don't like 76 and won't play it".
---
Yay
---
I'm probably being too hard on them. I know they have a lot of things to deal with. 100+ issues, bugs, problems, that are/were way more important to work on first. I want the game to succeed. I want them to fix everything. Etc. It will be great it everything works out. They have a lot to prove. They have a lot of work to do to win back the peoples trust. I don't envy them the position they are in. I hope they pull it off.
---
PS4.  The recent players on psn don't show anything from fo76 and the recent players in the social menu in fo76 was completely empty when I signed back in.
---
I could, but I don't know their full username.
---
Yes. They are *only* adding backpacks and *absolutely nothing* else. Of course. I was such a fool.
---
Rust does not have mules! Heck the game makes it pretty evident mules shouldn‚Äôt exist because the only way to store items is in your stash or on your person, heck you need to open up another physical client just in order to have a mule. But I agree ultimately it Bethesdas fault they should never have ported it to PC and left it purely as console game, they would have had fewer problems and better publicity if they just stuck to their guns like bungie did with destiny. 
---
Anyway the guy is an idiot because even after the nerf TSE weapons are **STILL the best fucking weapons**, they are just horrible OP weapons. Maybe maybe bloodied anti armour zealot weapon might do more damage against a Scorchbeast queen but for everything else TSE still fucking rocks. 
---
So you still haven't found the secret?

I was expecting something far more nightmare-inducing when I clicked the spidergoat link, not gonna lie.

""Hey, I loved Gary" - Gary" - Gary?

The canvas bag is a SBQ drop! Therefore you'll never see it!  Bahaha!

Cool
---
Yep good on you for doing a good job mate üíÉ
---
The way it used to work, you nuke Prime and half the players on the server will show up to pick the loot off the corpse. No communication required.
---
If the queen fights are really taking 45min now, then it may be less popular.
---
Anyway, Bloodied if you're min-maxing and Anti-armor if you're not.
---
I dunno about a climbing perk, but if there was a perk to give us a weaker version of Marsupial's jump height (or an equivalent version, but costing 3 AGI to equip instead of having the Marsupial drawbacks) would be interesting. Wonder how many would prefer it over the mutation.
---
I‚Äôm shitting on it because of things like this. And as the post says, I‚Äôve never come close to having an ‚Äúunattainable‚Äù number of items. And I edited to add that I have never duped because YOU said I was duping. ‚ÄúClearly you did something to trigger this‚Äù is that what you‚Äôd say to yourself if you got banned, right now? I tried to get on tonight to see if this game had improved, if it had any redeeming qualities, because nobody wanted to see it succeed more than me. Continuing to defend it, and defend the company when they have consistently fucked up on every patch, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôve all got Stockholm syndrome. 
---
Personally I love the fact that I rarely ever encounter other players. When I do it's kind of neat and reminds me we arent alone. 
---
However while I wouldnt want a private server, I'd love a pure pacifist server. No pvp at all. No camp destruction at all. 
---
I understand pausing isnt possible but I wouldnt mind if they added somethingconsumable, like stealth boys, but something that would put your character in stasis for x amount of minutes. You could craft it. Only consume it when you are not in a [danger] or [caution] mode. That would prevent people from shooting a sbq and then freezing for xp or abusing the system. Just a literal time out that would make your character non interactable for up to say 30 min or something without having to travel to a camp or worry about dying while afk.

I really actually enjoy doing events and things with random strangers. If the element for being pvp'ed was gone I think people would join together more often. 
---
I had it pop while doing a quest for Rose. Everytime I tried to do it before then it would reset.
---
I never left Bethesda‚Äôs sideüò≠and now I‚Äôm so happy for the new things to come. üòÅ

Ballistic fiber tub!!!

If I was banned I'd think back and figure out if i did something wrong. If I didn't and felt it was a false ban I'd go to Bethesda support, not go on Reddit.
---
Turns out he was holding 170k molded plastic. Bethesda staff confirmed it after reviewing his account. I made up my mind. There is no such thing as innocent bans. Thanks for the link
---
If you want to help, stick around and keep farming, tag the spawns, and help with kills. Maybe build some crafting workstations for people to scrap and repair.  
---
Once you're not present anymore, the guns are not viewed as assistance, they are viewed by the instance farmers as a hinderance/annoyance. People won't hunt you down over it, but as some have said, they will mot likely trash your CAMP, over and over again. Etiquette considers that "fair" once you are no longer present actively farming.
---
Well, he is waving to him, so he is not necessarily "mini", just further away.
---
I think there is a better recipe for disease cure that takes firecracker berries, blight, and blackberries? All relatively easy to find around the perimeter of Whitesprings...you can almost always find the recipe for this &gt;!in Emmett Mountain Disposal site, in the locker room, locker shelf by the wall closest to the bathroom. !&lt;So much easier than finding firecaps, IMHO.

Thank you for using the correct method of hiding spoilers, which works across almost all platforms. (The mobile website is one exception).
---
For those of you who are unaware, rather than following a spoiler format such as `[Something](/s 'spoiler in here')` (May be different subreddit to subreddit, depends on their CSS), you can just surround your spoiler contents with `&gt;!` and `!&lt;` which will give you &gt;!Spoiler!&lt; and looks like this `&gt;!Spoiler!&lt;` ^^No ^^Spaces!
---
You can also use just `&gt;!` at the beginning of a paragraph to mark the entire paragraph as a spoiler.

Someone wasnt loved as a child, I'm sorry.
---
I first loved the game. Played it for quite a bit then hated it and was convinced Beth can't fix it up. Please prove me wrong. You are on the right track. DON'T be late on the updates and DON'T make silly mistakes and you might just regain the goodwill of the fans you lost.
---
Honestly I hope they add more perk cards, the perk system has a lot of potential that is currently wasted.
---
-Looking Rad: 30% chance of getting a random mutation every 10 minutes, LUCK.
---
-Faster than Light: You sprint 50% faster at twice the AP cost, AGILITY.
---
-You've got the Power: All energy weapons deal 30% more damage, INTELLIGENCE (Why does this not exists? Outside Demo Expert there is really no damage perk in Intelligence and energy weapons are mostly weak so two birds in one stone).
---
-Hard Hitter: When using melee weapons you can hold the power attack button to perform a slower power strike that consumes all your AP but deals twice as damage and has a very high chance to cripple a limb and knockback enemies, STRENGTH.
---
-Eye of the Tiger: The last enemy you shot will stay highlighted in red through walls for 20 seconds (using the berry mentats effect), PERCEPTION.
---
-One for the team: Your teamates take 30% less damage but in exchange you take 50% more damage, CHARISMA (weird and maybe exploitable but that also happen with the revive perks).
---
I could go on all day but you get my point.
---
I just have a 1x3 open air camp, probably could fit it all on 1x2.  I figure if I build walls someone will just knock them down.  Lvl 109 and I've had my camp wrecked only once by some jerk because I wouldn't pvp with them.  
---
Power Armor does get duplicated sometime by accident. Don't worry, one duped copy won't get you banned.
---
No. I meant it seriously. Doesn‚Äôt have to be exact copy paste. But something around that. Like how Apex is done in its own way. 
---
Am I downvoted because people thought sarcasm? Or because they hate the idea?
---
That would be good, because it does get annoying to keep getting useless cards that just make scrolling through them all even more tedious when switching them around.
---
Agree 100% it‚Äôs a solid foot in the right direction and patch 6 with extra stash was good. Still skeptical on how good the content might be and how it may be delivered ..... now just give us back some damage back on our two shots and TSE‚Äôs. Somewhere in between where they are now and where they were before is the right balance.
---
Calm down buddy. It's just a roadmap. You can rub it in once they deliver on these updates successfully and in a timely manner.
---
Sorry to revive such an old thread, but is this a confirmed fix? I've been having the issue for a long time, and it doesn't seem to be reported that much. 
---
I'm not gonna lie seeing the OP put me in a pretty salty mood. I thought we were on our way past this. 
---
From the start I wanted to carry on messing up the wastland with my random looted junk. Everything is way too tidy and doesnt reflect the apocalyptic wasteland it is.
---
I don‚Äôt mind Multiplayer Raids but the Con of multiplayer raids is that if raids produce the best equipment, why would you do anything else other than raid? 
---
The game will become raiding, and I hope it doesn‚Äôt follow that route 
---
Proud to be part of the brotherhood and the institute.
---
Seriously? They dangle a bit of an update and you fawn over them like this??
---
This is why gaming is in the state it's in.
---
Ladydevann - have you heard anything about a shared stash between your characters? Diablo stash style or WoW mailbox or even a little borderlands Claptrap style stash? I‚Äôd give up the next 200 increase for a seperate shared box. 
---
It's nice to see they are gonna actually support it which is surprising all things considered. Was scary how quiet they were for so long and pair that with the fact the game has been out for like 4 months now with only patches and no talk of new content other then the vaults which seemed underwhelming at the time 
---
Can you maybe just place a normal 1 then after just click it, select replace, and change to the astroturf
---
Trust me, you were
---
What do u think it is??
---
raw flux, medical supplies and food.
---
Do you have any idea how much flux you get from nuking white springs and how much it is worth?
---
I can generate in a day more stuff then I can sell in a week without trying.
---
Getting 50k of items in a day is trivial. I don't dupe, I just play smart.
---
So glad you noticed! We‚Äôve got a small team down here - myself, u/lonevaultwanderer and u/furysevensix are based out of the Sydney office. Super glad the Southern Hemisphere specific pic helped :) 
---
You tried hip firing with that that mod attached? It does fire faster just so you know

---
My camp is an open plan design almost always placed next to Whitesprings station and has obnoxious blinking lights and strobes to attract players to use the benches. No turrets. 
---
Personally I think if they had just pushed there timeline out by 3 month there would have been slot of Better feedback
---
Actually, it looks like the majority of my Atom Store purchases have this problem... red and white lights, red rocket bed, mothman poster, etc.
---
The mechanics are fine. I was noting the misspelling in the game.
---
Absolutely!  [Here's](https://image.frl/2xuve) my latest tiny house (no generator though).

There is a current bug (rad worms) that screws up mutations, adding extra height. It does not sound like harassment, just some normal griefing. Even as a high level player, it is easy enough to get killed.  Unless you go around all the time with anti-pvp gear, you are vulnerable to anyone set up for pvp.  Settlers and raiders.
---
If he's in a team using stranger in numbers then you can jump higher.
---
Did you have an owned workshop, because they can contest it, fast travel to you and kill you. Or you maybe accidentally had a bounty.
---
Sadly, as much as it sucks, you can't report people for griefing. And as for the other stuff, unless you had ireputable evidence that were cheating/hacking, like recorded video showing them clearly doing something they should'nt be able to (even then, they may not care), otherwise they have no way to believe you on just your word.
---
Do the event 'Leader of the Pack' to get the commendations the  easy way.  3 guaranteed legendary wolves, get yourself some level appropriate gear too!
---
They could have fooled me
---
got mods?
---
He was probably grouped runnng strange in numbers perk. Some people are just dicks, and the pvp system is trash. 
---
Supposedly ducking helps to hide you on the world map. So do that while at your camp to help stop people from targeting you when you‚Äôre more than likely at your camp. Fairly easy to tell when someone is at their camp they are usually stationary in a random Radom part of the map.
---
Its looking better atm . And thats a lot coming from me lol , dlc looking good but we need to stay realistic so upcoming bugs &amp; glitches (yes there will be more ) dont get swiped under the mat cause everyone is so hyped.
---
Especially destiny has been good at overhyping people with dlc announcments- and they have not been to awesome after all. But its actually 1st time there is hope imo for this game üëç Stay realistic people 
---
All those robot spawn stations with the terminal in the middle that are scattered all over the map must eventually be for something.
---
Don't feel bad, the maths was wrong anyway.
---
Yissssssssss
---
We got your back u/klavinmour! 
---
This is stupid.  You aint their friend, they are trying to fleece more money out of you.  This game is garbage the end game is pointless and everyone knows it.  Jump ship because you're not teaching them a lesson by handing over your time and money for this prolapsed anus of a game.
---
Good ones
---
I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs an animal, but I know for sure regular SB are affected by Zealot‚Äôs guns, it stands to reason Zealots armor works too, and the queen should be the same as the normals. 
---
More development time after the beta would have been a great idea I think.  
---
Yeah I used a mod for unlimited carry weight in Fallout 4 and it ruined the gameplay IMO. 
---
If you want a wall/door to face the opposite direction. Place a floor/foundation the opposite side, store the other floor, place the wall/door ( it should now face the way you want, replace the floor/foundation, remove the excess floor. Voila!
---
In more advanced builds where your original floor cannot be removed because it's supporting walls, turn the walls into doors because for some reason doors can have their base removed and left floating, where as walls cannot
---
What platform? If PC Moded INI files are causing issues if you‚Äôre running one. Believe it affects atom store purchases. 
---
Sometimes for the floating issues on PC you can resolve the issue by hold E while moving and item around.
---
When I arrow over to astroturf, the foundation turns invisible. Hitting "build" removes it. :/
---
The reality of fighting the queen is half the server will show up to kill her if you nuke Prime. You don‚Äôt have to be on a team. 
---
Only if there is an increase in diversity of goods. Which for the MMO there isn't.
---

---
Lmao gtfo of here with your wannabe consumer white knight bullshit. Nobody but other losers thinks you are some kind of anti-corporate rebel for talking shit about video games and the people who make them.
---
Maybe you should ask yourself why you are so insecure that you feel compelled to try and label people (hint: it‚Äôs projection) and why you actually make a habit of telling strangers on the internet that they like bad games. 
---
Who does that shit?lol
---
I love this. I'd say make it 3 respec points, because lets be honest, the chances of getting 4 cards you want out of a perk pack are very slim. At this point I almost dread the perk packs because I think I get one that I want out of every 3 packs or so. This would be a great alternative.
---
It‚Äôs necessary if you are a heavy weapon user. Stabilized...
---
The Brotherhood is right tbh
---
I am not the one you helped, but thank you for doing that.
---
I love this part of the community. 
---
Wait, the gun does better hip fire if it's on fire?
---
Also, you can put guns on fire? 
---
But is that after you've already built it as another, but instead replacing it. Because I find this works sometimes with builds where it will let me place wood wall, but not a brick because its thicker. So I place the wood and after replace it to brick
---
Sorry, also what platform?
---
I need to stay away until at least Nuclear Winter. A lot of things have left a bad taste in my mouth with this title. I hope its a new game by the time I return. 
---
Fuck dude you lurked on this subreddit since the beginning and just now decided to play? God bless you lol
---
But really I'm glad. Took a small break (not because of the game, IRL stuff) and came back after the latest patch, very happy how everything is turning out. And just learned about the roadmap, so I'm even happier! I love the game a lot, I have about 4 characters (different faction personalities/looks), and only one is above level 30. 
---
My "end game" is pretty much trying to find the places I missed, finding new legendaries and unmarked sites, and redoing my hotel/house. Level 74 and just found my first megasloth near the monorail elevator. Hope you enjoy more friend!
---
I find it hard to believe anyone who has stopped playing would still be playing no matter when they made this announcement. What difference does it make if new stuff is coming months from now, there is still nothing new to do now.
---
When I see this, since I have marsupial,  I'll hop on the awning in the back and kill the ghouls on the the top floor through the window. While the other player with the camp in back rages at me, I blow him a heart and run off.
---
You have to scrap or store or move all the objects attached to the stairs. 
---
Correct - place a normal concrete foundation, select it and hit replace, arrow over to astroturf and it turns invisible. Hit "E" to build, and it's gone.
---
This happened in June 2018 too.Remember how hyped we all were for this game?Now look at it.I'm keeping my hype levels at all , for the chance of this being good is very low considering the massive flop this game was.
---
PC
---
Ok now I'm wondering if YOU have been playing the game. These are all current issues. And plenty more like broken Adrenal. Hunger damage glitch, etc
---
BUGthesds is why come.
---
Free states
---
&gt;the Bethesda devs
---
The what now?
---
If you haven't seen it, someone posted a camp where they built under a bridge. It's a bit cramp but still a pleasant home. 
---
The OP of that post was kind enough to give me the location so I was able to make that spot my own home. 
---
Here's some picture if you care to look. 
---
Fallout 76 Mire Camp https://imgur.com/a/7yjhXqv
---
This is very helpful. Definitely going to give this a try. Thank you UnicornQueen üòÉ
---
We got pretty much exactly what they said at the release statement. "Different type of game, never did multiplayer before, not following other people, enhanced Fallout 4 engine, no interactable NPCs". People will complain no matter what, and they'll say the world is ending before they admit they're wrong
---
This one hurt me. Found out at level 45. Wanted to cry
---
Nope
---
Holding E seems to freeze me in place
---
Literally everyone who has played a Bethesda game...
---
Change the walls to doorways
---
Damn, I'm not sure. Sounds like it hasn't recognised you bought it from the atom shop. Same problem with floors or only foundations
---
Same thing for both, unfortunately.
---
Interesting, I think it‚Äôs the mouse wheel that‚Äôs raised and lowers the item being built. Maybe it‚Äôs actually moving the mouse. Not on the computer right now.
---
New surprises: no NPCs but instead the devs and Bethesda team themselves comes in as "NPCs" with Tod Howard riding down the Appalachian Mountains in a prisoner cart
---
You can sometimes build another set of stairs attaching to your foundation and the game will accept that new set of stairs as supporting the structure. That allows you to scrap the old stairs.
---
Sometimes it may not work, but I've done it many times.
---
Yes. Those are real. But he mentioned T-posing ghouls as one of the biggest issues in the game. That was fixed early on.
---
In situations such as this Bethesda would recommend you contact the DEAF EAR DEPARTMENT. 
---
That was patched I think
---
Yeah it's gotta be that it's not recognising your purchase. Did you put in a ticket
---
yep
---
Some guy had a lot of ammo for farming and got falsely banned for duping.
---
According to the people here there's no way Bethesdas autoban system could have any faults or false positives so he's 100% guilty. 
---
This^^
---
Going to now I guess. I was able to place a red rocket bed last week, but at one point is just disappeared from my camp. "Repair All" didn't bring it back, but I didn't really worry about it since I was planning to build a completely new camp. Now I can't place that either (or any other atom store purchase).
---
Biggest comeback in history goes to No Man's Sky imo
---
Well if you already paid for the game, nothing else is going cost anything else. 
---
So what is going to cost money? 
---
Iam enjoying the game and done so since launch . And I will enjoy it for a long time , I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt :)
---
Watoga Highschool is even better for plastic, the cafeteria is littered with plastic cutlery.
---
Also, the cat lady house south east of Morgantown. If you want to know its exact location, check my post history.
---
Well you could join the Griefers local 502. I would have also recommended the Doopers but they don't seem to be taking new members at present ;)
---
Thanks, I just made them up. Would love if Bethesda asked the community for ideas to put in the game.
---
Yeah but 76 may just trump that now.
---
Haven't been there yet. Thanks for the tip.
---
Ah I don't actually know what T-posing is but the other stuff checks out for me anyways
---
XddDD were whiteknighting corporations but it's ok because were ONLY CASUALS
---
Still not buying it until I can play on a private server with just my friends.
---
Ah, okay. I'll check it out and see if I can fix it. 
---
I'll just put my "grief me if you're role playing" flag right here.
---
I can now role play the town drunk and have a neverending supply of booze!
---
Oh return to a last server is coming in a future update confirmed by u/ladydevann
---
How?
---
Pepe Silva strikes again!
---
What is pay to win in this game ? What do you pay that make you win ?
---
no secret lol. 
---
I want the plush cats even more. But I thought it was a shame to have so many variant teddy bears (and cats) and not be able to display them. 
---
Nope don‚Äôt care for either 
---
My friend does this in 4 as well and was incredibly disappointed he could not do it in 76. 
---
Yes. I understand why we can‚Äôt do it which is why I‚Äôm not pissed we can‚Äôt do it. But I still miss it  
---
Just to confirm you still need to relog between each mutation? I'm going to go ahead and pull the trigger on relearning Adrenal Reaction and you seem to know your stuff!
---
There was no early access on the label and the 60$ price tag didn't tell us either. 
---
don't open your pipboy when starting. That is why it's freezing.
---
What I do is wait for a minute and bring out my gun. Once the gun is visible, your good to go.
---
It‚Äôs the group between raiders and brotherhood. As you noted for the raiders you don‚Äôt actually ‚Äújoin‚Äù, the free states are similar. You complete quests for them activating the scorched detection system, but that‚Äôs pretty much it. It‚Äôs a faction but nothing specific.
---
Lol you people are insane. 
---
I wouldn't call it free when it's expected with the purchase.
---
Yes, I attacked them, and yes, they kept being utterly oblivious.  It was very unsettling to slap a ghoul and have it *run away* from me instead of bitchslap me back...
---
Now the only thing we need is a ‚Äúyee yee‚Äù emote 
---
I just didn't want to have a bounty.  I'm not that kind of player. ;-;  I'm here to have fun and harassing other people isn't my idea of fun.
---
No that isn't why because I am not opening my pipboy. 
---
Is this what it look like to not be banned?
---
bump
---
Oh, cool I‚Äôm banned
---
You probably got the ultracite rusty knuckles power armor mod for ultracite PA
---
I can now become unbanned, oh wait I  can‚Äôt 
---
There is usually one in Grafton in the trade bot area over to the right on a desk by the first aid box
---
A good QOL idea would be to unban me
---
Oh.. it's been like that since launch. Lemme guess... you have calibrated shocks installed, no?
---
I like to build on the overpass slightly north of Flatwoods. You can fit two foundations across the road, if you're careful. It's got water, easy access to a trader, and two friendly Protectons out front that kill the mole rat mobs.
---
Lord forbid you put them next to each other. Basically have to scrap the whole thing. Wants to tell me no support when one set of metal stairs is holding up a three floor mansion. 
---
Coming back from about a month hiatus I instantly noticed the performance of the game is miles better. Much smoother and combat it twice as fun now. I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs to come. Guess I should get to launching my first nuke now lol
---
The issue is you didn't have to have anything in your inventory to get the ban; rather, you just had to have had 100,000 of a "rare" item cumlatively go through your inventory over a 30 day period.  To put that into perspective: if you have 1,000 round of legit ultracite ammo, and you put that into a container and then take it back out, and you do that 100X in a 30 day period... they'll ban you!
---
just trying to help, chill.
---
I get what they were trying to do. Which is force you to pick what your character could do while allowing flexibility to change around. But with perks where you only need them certain times it just encourages people to change them in and out and since there is no penalty for doing so then it feels like it‚Äôs busy work forced on you. 
---
I like some one‚Äôs suggestion. Only allow you to change them in certain places (maybe train stations or only when you level up though that might be too restrictive) so you can still mess around with flexibility but it forces you to choose what to sacrifice at least for a bit of time. 
---
Maybe you are carrying way too many items on your main? Too many weapons and armors?
---

I have screen shots of all this. I promise this is a real thing and I experienced it tonight on my stream. PM me if you want it spoiled.  
---
Next thing you will notice is people wanted for stealing placed items in a C.A.M.P...lol
---
Any tips for growing screws? I can never find enough
---
I haven't installed the calibrated shocks that I found yet no.
---
I no you get +100 when in the excavator complete set, but I'm getting +200 right now for a total of 425 carry weight.
---
I've only been playing for about a week, and I guess I never logged out in Power Armor then if it's been this way since launch. My apologies if this is not new information.
---
It was.
---
I don‚Äôt ever comment but I‚Äôm going to have to agree! I‚Äôm so sick of running into greedy dipshits who do nothing but farm and then when I stumble across WS they come and try to grief me with their damn tse fucking penis pump hellbent shotgun and wreck my shit! 
---
The mole miners really need back story, and legendary effects.  Quests, holotapes and new items. 
---
I dunno, NMS will be hard to beat for that. That game had people bitter about it years after it came out. Even now when most people (finally) acknowledge a turn around you still have a few people bitter who get pissed that people aren‚Äôt still as upset as they are at hello games and dare say it‚Äôs a good game and not a scam. 
---
I think that turn around will be hard to beat and I definitely don‚Äôt think fallout 76 is there (I like the game but I think it‚Äôs too early to see if it turns around a lot of people who dislike it). 
---
Squishagnome?
---
No Turrets? Then you're not part of the "problem" being discussed :D
---
I really love the backpacks idea. I hope it's a cosmetic item that shows up on your character too? Maybe all the badges you earn can be displayed on it? That'd be neat! And it'd be really cool just to have a unique backpack that's different from everyone else depending on what merit badges you've earned. One of the reasons why I wore the Union Soldier outfit for a long time is because of the pack on it, making it look like a neat backpacker's outfit while exploring the mountains and wastes.  
---
I am very excited for the junk CAMP decorations! YES!!! Teddybears and baby blocks spelling out words in my camp. Shelves full of items. Countertops and desktops with proper junk items on them to look like my home is lived in. So happy for this if it works out well.
---
Spoiler Alert- Vault 76 is a control vault because all the dwellers were prototype synths like Nick Valentine 
---
It's not really that easy, the reason it broke was that they changed a tag so that items that were not supposed to be broken down automatically would not be broken down. Mods, ingredients, ect.
---
This broke bulk scrap, meaning it would not be broken down automatically to make things, so they removed the tag.
---
Now it breaks down automatically, having no scrap protection.
---
To fix it means implementing a new type of item tag entirely, because bulk junk lives in a weird limbo land where it's supposed to automatically break down sometimes, but not all the time. 
---
Intelligent ghouls on the way. 
---
They have a whole explicit way of reporting players, and a specific selection for reporting cheating and exploiting in their ticket system. I'm not sure where you're looking.
---
That is correct.  You assumed 
---
And purge most of the player base. People with mutations shall suffer
---
Yeah... you get that if you log out in power armor. with calibrated shocks mods, you get 500ish carry weight and you can roleplay as a walking stash box
---
I would reset my level to 1 if I had auto locksmith and hacking 
---
Oddly I was not happy about the announcement, particularly pvp. But I‚Äôve never wanted a multiplayer fallout. Still enjoying it though. Honestly I suspect the people whose prejudice had them get really loud when 76 turned out so buggy were more the people who already hated Bethesda and were frustrated that despite what they saw was crappy games, Bethesda ruining fallout, or games so buggy they shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded. And hey were ecstatic that people finally were frustrated at Bethesda so they helped fan the flames. And to be fair, Bethesda really didn‚Äôt help themselves either and also helped fan the flames. 
---
I was lugging over 2000 lbs of gears on me when I last played the game about a month ago, just wondering if I have gotten banned for legitimately hoarding all the stuff that I can't seem to let go. Would be so irate if I did. Better get the client updated and check it out tonight.
---
Thanks. That is weird. Did you kill any and get XP? Loot? I wonder if it's a bug or intentional. Like once you're bad, the enemies figure you're one of them.
---
Whelp. Might have been the mods. I had removed the mods from my Fallout76Custom.ini file at first, which hadn't worked. As a last ditch effort, I renamed both files and let the game re-create them. Everything appears to work now.

---
Fallout games never have backpack mechanics.
---
That's why it unsettled me, that was my thought too-- but yes, killing them, xp, loot, all worked normally, just like you can still murder, loot, and gain xp from the bots at Watoga consequence free after Mayor For A Day... but it was as if my faction had been changed to theirs, or I had been added to theirs.  I actually stared at a ghoul doing ghoul things, waiting for him to throw himself at me like they do, and he did nothing but the idle flailing they do when not in combat.
---
Not sure but I've had it since first beta. Kept crashing during the character creation screen. It's a lot better since the last patch and dupe purge tho
---
Well you don‚Äôt want ghoul slaying on it, do you? The idea is to keep them alive!
---
I guess everyone just skips that part of the game, it might be interesting to look into it more thought.
---
they're part of an enclave event 
---
Super late night for me tonight, but we'll make this happen tomorrow. My GT is Daemonizare. I also have it put in my notes so I don't forget :).
---
Yes it is you become god like tod our great lord has givin us non banned players but a fraction of his power and we have become mighty
---
Probably lets you cap your special points to max. 1 per 50 levels. 
---
I don‚Äôt think many people that are annoyed by turret platforms in the area there are going to go looking for switches. It‚Äôs a nice thought and all, but in the end the people that destroy these types of bases will make yours another target. 
---
&gt;tse fucking penis pump hellbent shotgun
---
...Beautiful.
---
Build a new set of stairs supporting the structure then you can remove them. I've done this and it works great. 
---
Omg yes yes yes legendary vendor is game changer I am jumping around my living room woo thankyou guys love this road map sounds so exciting 
---
Unyielding, Nerd Rage, radicool, and you can fix adrenal reaction. 
---
It makes me think of FROST total conversion from Fallout 4. I'm hopeful that it's like that (cruel survival game), but also based on our current game mode, instead of the upcoming PVP mode.
---
I wanna play FROST with friends, but getting shot and t-bagged by griefers would kill it for me.
---
I can do all for 4 for you ign is promitheusaudio 
---
Well, I guess we know who to replace next. Ad Victoriam, Brother!
---
This thing will wreak havok :) Have fun! You'll enjoy the gun even more when you'll find a quad version :) 
---
I just realised I don't even know what ballistic fiber looks like in this game.
---
Sent a request.
---
Many new bugs too ;) 
---
Now I want a gun that shoots Scorchbeast screeches... 
---
This is what I found to best also. 
---
Killed a queen, deathclaw, scorchbeast, no progress recorded at all
---
Black Rider Betty Garvey the Legendary Power Armor Hobo. Well you just expanded one my third characters story. Ty
---
This is the thing I have most been looking forward to.
---
I like a lot of what was mentioned, but for me the priority should be to fix game stability and improve weapon balance. 
---
You sir,  need to Run for Mayor.
---
There's like five or six links in the main thread already bud. Just look at the sub popular.
---
There is a mutation for that last one
---
Thank you very much!
---
You are welcome
---
I just hoard most of it and give it to my alts or friends. Never have a problem with anything other than fusion core management, and that only in my non-power armor melee. 
---
So it was working before, and they broke it with the patch, and you're saying it's to hard for them to fix what they broke? Oddly incompetent one would suggest. 
---
There are visual effects as part of the blast zone which drop framerate a bit. This causes additional slowdowns when added on top of all the mobs the queen spawns. The difference is quite noticeable especially on consoles, since they really don't have that great hardware (and I have a PS4 Pro with an SSD upgrade). Good PCs probably don't care about the extra effects, but a base Xbox One or PS4 for sure do. 
---
Don't forget to Kick some Emu ass Down there 
---
Couldnt agree more
---
In their ticket system. Under "report player". There is a drop-down menu listing the reason. Populated with only ONE option: "Report inappropriate mod". Please go look at this yourself before you assume I am some idiot noob who doesn't know how the system works...I have reported people for this exact same issue the exact same way twice before with no problems.
---
Thank you this did work for my door but I can't do this to my resource extractor I want to box in. So this solution only solves part of the issue. Thanks though. I really appreciate it!
---
Easily lol. I'm at 25k caps, have 5 weapons worth 4k or more, fully modded t51b power armor, 45 excavator power armor, mostly modded x01, fully modded t60, multiple outfits worth over 1k each etc. by the time your 100 or so its easy to have quite the valuable account. The people with characters in the 3-400 level range have insane values. 
---
What's up with this?  Is it a bug?  It only happens on one of my characters.  On the other one it's fine.  It's incredibly annoying though.
---
Still waiting for ps4 fallout 1/2
---
Not everyone. Some have yet to even get an email.
---
Dude, it should be your choice to breakdown the bulk, just like before the patch. Do you not get that? Your response sounds like you think we want bulking to be permanent. Never to be broken down.  That is not what we are talking about, or suggesting.   You bulk your stuff that you want sell and go hit up the vendors to grind your easy grand of caps, but you brainfart and scrap after killing something on the way.... And you're over loaded like a pack mule and have wasted all your plastic. Which didn't happen before they screwed the pooch on this, but now it does, and it's as annoying as all Hell!  Is this understandable to you?  Or not? Or are you just trolling for shits and giggles?
---
I guess it must depend on something else or my structure is just bugged. I have a balcony with a staircase on the front of my house and I wanted to move it to the back, so I built a new doorway, balcony, and staircase and it wouldn't let me scrap the old one, and now it won't let me scrap the new one either and it looks dumb now.
---
I got a bit impatient and frustrated and stored the whole camp just now so problem solved this time I guess. I'm debating moving to a new location for a change of scenery anyway. It's been a month or two since I've pulled up stakes.
---
I wish they'd remove the "structure would be inaccessible" thing. You can't play around with different structure designs without fear of something getting stuck and not scrapping again.
---
This! The new futuristic deomcracy demands that everyone should be Mayor For A Day!
---
All melee weapons are viable, I'm level 329 and am
---
More or less exclusively melee.  
---
   
---
  
---
Every melee weapon has its pro's and cons, but to be honest they did a great job on melee weapons.  
---
I literally use and  have on me..  
---
-Cultist Dagger. 
---
-Combat Knife. 
---
-Pipewrench  
---
-Mr. handy Buzz Blade. 
---
-Flaming PigSticker of Dooooooom. 
---
And I've experimented with every since melee weapon.  
---
Some are a little faster, or hit a little harder, but they are all fun.  
---
TBH, the whole "one shot kill" with SuperSledges is silly and stupid, I was one shotting level 60'ish trash mobs (non-glowing ghouls, scorched etc) since level 35..  
---
 It's honestly more efficient to use medium - Very Fast weapons, especially with swing speed. 
---
You know what's funny too...
---
It'll be winter down under for nuclear winter hehe 
---
Sent you a PM
---
I tried all the suggestions and none worked unfortunately. Thanks for the suggestions though. I even went as far as scrapping the whole upper floor, then the ground floor, then when I got to the floorboards for the ground floor that cover the half basement (it's built in a river depression) it stopped letting me scrap anything else. Everything was an error for "will leave inaccessible" or similar. I ended up just packing up camp entirely. I might check out some different spots to move to tomorrow before I rebuild here because I was getting bored of the location anyway. 
---
Nice. Front row for the nuke show
---
..
---
Yeah, but if ghoul slaying increases the damage, and ghouls get healed by gamma damage, it should just... heal them more?
---
What branch brother? I was a Jarhead. Yut!
---
I sure hope so. Because I've had to tear down numerous structures because of this 
---
Been asking for weapon display racks since day one. Shouldn't be too hard to port in from Fallout 4. And we could finally have more than 5 weapons without running out of carry weight and/or stash space.

Wow. Thanks for detailing that.

Thanks found it and so excited woo

Locations that spawn enemies are also usually blocked. Also any place that has placed notes or is part of a named location.
---
Seriously, just replace all the walls around the stair case with doorways, move the stair case and replace the doors with walls again. It will work.
---
Looking forward to the vendor mode we will be getting. Also going to start stashing Quantum to put in my C.A.M.P. Love these new things coming. 
---
Sigh. Maybe you shouldn't assume I didn‚Äôt look at it myself. There's no reason I would say it existed if I hadn't looked at it and seen it for myself. Here's a Screencast right here. I'm not sure what your actual damage is. If you can't find it, just report it under another category that's close enough. It's not like you can't explain the details. Or maybe you just want to be mad, in which case, no one can help you.

Are you running a vats build? My AA lever action (with an adrenal reaction/nerd rage build) one-head-shots everything but big beasts, and pumps those shots out fast, and with gun-fu it just keeps rocking. I‚Äôd get a bloody one if I could find one; the damage would be insane for how fast you can pump out shots. 
---
Bandolier i think?
---
Np
---
You need lower HP for it to proc. 
---
My HP didn't change pre-patch and post-patch. Yet my damage dropped significantly
---
Gotta use the nade launcher to chain react with thrown nade
---
My god, this is fantastic work. I really do hope the DLC plays out like a mystery or detective sort of case.
---
Unequip and switch worlds and try again! Or before logging off for the day make your character naked üòÜ

&gt;A mythical beast, a lost generation of scouts, and the strongest brew this side of the wasteland. Welcome to Wild Appalachia ‚Äì a series of new quests, features, events, crafting systems and more starting on March 12 **and appearing over several weeks.
---
**
---
I'm curious what specifically is coming on the 12th and what is coming out later. Want to temper my expectations. Any heads up /u/Ladydevann ?
---
I've always been really intrigued by the Chupacabra, you know, the Mexican lizard that eats all the goats. I realize it won't really fit in WV, but still. 
---
Awesome writeup! Do you think the Investigator's Cabin near Twin Lakes will be connected to thr Shear Terror storyline? It's got the terminal of a federal investigator looking into a cryptid hunter and then discovering a government conspiracy, and continuing his investigation after the war. It's also got a bunch of locked terminal entries - the place screams "future expansion".
---
Honestly might pick the game up here in a month or two 
---
Awesome, hope you wore your tin foil hat whilst investigating this! 
---
Would love to see you update this post with new information when it surfaces.
---
I'm afraid that's in the engine itself, all my friends have it.  I don't play the game since several month so i can't say if it's fixed.
---
it sucks. I want to move my stairs again, hope it lets me do it again. Otherwise i might just scrap it all and start over myself, although i won't be moving. 
---
Man, I hope I get to see a Sasquatch wandering in the woods 
---
I am hoping Nuclear Winter is a hardcore survival mode, if not that we may get something like that at some point.
---
Not the hardcore pvp mode, but something where survival is just much more difficult. I just find the base game (soon to be known as Adventure) to be so easy. Food, water, medicine, ammo, everything you could need for short term survival are so incredibly abundant. I never feel at risk of starving, and i am using the Speed Demon mutation.
---
A much darker map with less sunlight, blocked out by the fallout, along with real scrounging for food and water is something i'd find very exciting to play.
---
Having to think twice before i engage in a fight since bullets are scarce and if i get injured or infected it is a greater risk since medication to treat such ailments are difficult to come by.
---
That is the survival experience i'd love to play.
---
I think he means low hp percent wise. Like 20/100 hp
---
So it is nerfed? Because you need lower hp to get the same effects?
---
I most certainly did! Along with my monocle and trench coat.
---
And I am most certainly planning on constantly updating this post with supportive evidence and pictures, as well as any new datamines or leaks. 
---
Tomorrow I go hunt for the Sheepsquatch "FOOTPRINT" and possible connections between places. 
---
That's because this is what the community should be.
---
So you returned after a month and there was nothing new except a jpg saying they might add something months from now?
---
No.
---
It is a player made decision to constantly nuke Whitesprings. People were building camps there before it became the defacto nuke target.
---
By all acounts it is even a fairly low level area, if it wasn't for the constant nuking and high level players showing up there, hindering low level and new players in their progression.
---
We don't need even more limited build rules, especially not just to satisfy some player made meta game. Try nuking something else for a change.
---
Just a heads up Bethesdrone has been around as an insult way before incels ever came into the spotlight. Shit, I didn't even make the connection you did until I read your reply twice.
---
I wonder if Ever Upwards will expand into that long stretch of Ohio on the left side of the map, will Shear Terror add Goat Man/Jersey Devil?
---
I did a few hours worth of research into the cryptid and Sheepsquatch DLC if you're interested
---
For a while I wanted to get every rank of gunsmith on my rifleman just to have to switch out. Turns out that it defaults to upgrading the highest lvl card. So I had my lvl 5 and level 4, didn't realize that trying to "upgrade" would give me two level fives and, essentially, start me over again. Meaning if I want any rank lower than the highest I currently own (other than 5), I have to re upgrade my highest card to 5 and then a level one card up to whatever I wanted it.
---
I was like, huh, it would be easier if they just let me choose. Like seriously, why even bother "breaking them down"? Just have one card per perk that you can level up and then choose the rank of at will. Can't have more than 1 of the same card equipped anyway so why make me pan across 20 cards to get to Super Duper.
---
I don't thinks so. It's how it always been. Ya get max benefits from 20%hp. I don't like running that low all the time. Prefer my characters get meaner more hurt they are. It builds up and caps at that point. Any lower and ya just dancing with the devil.
---
Well, me too, I never really used it or farmed it, actually with my PA-only builds xD
---
Tweaking hardware/software for optiomal performance is fun (in a way).
---
Monitoring software will show an average CPU frequency (over some interval, typical about 1s), so that fluctuations will not show up in the displayed values (and all it takes is 1 core/thread to lose its boost momentarily to slow the whole thing down). I'm pretty sure that I get more stable performance with my 2600 at 3.9 instead of auto boosting to about 3.75.
---
If you have not done so, fixing the frequency with ryzen Master or in bios to perform a definitive test is a good idea.
---
It also drains yer core faster. 
---
That's ridiculous that we have to wipe our mutations and then try and get mutated again with the same mutation just because they keep breaking the game with every update...smh.
---
Especially a sneak melee build if you're using an instigating weapon.
---
Kill everyone 
---
do you consider scrapping PA jetpacks, shocks, servos, and other rare and expensive mods to make bullets before scrapping other junk working.
---
A lot of things were being broken down automatically that were very important, by fixing those to not break things in the same category, aka bulk, received the same change.
---
The current options are rare materials getting auto scrapped, bulk not auto scrapping at all, or bulk auto scrapping.
---
IMHO the problem is players who bulk for no reason, they are the only one's bothered by bulk not scrapping itself for crafting, but blaming players is bad form
---
waste a plastic the lot o' em.
---
Are all these detective files laying around everywhere part of this ya think? I found a large number of them in sugar Grove earlier. Haven't thought to check around other instilations.
---
I just want a fridge
---
I‚Äôm always down for some playthrough. 
---
My bad, I had no idea. I use so much Radaway that all my mutations last like 5 seconds.
---
Nah man it's cool once you get starched genes they stick around and there are some really good ones
---
&gt; find a sub for pointless bummer complainers, you‚Äôll thrive there. 
---
Textbook definition of this sub.
---
What if you leg it there? Just curious. Mine has up and turned off once or twice playing this game. No real noticeable  pattern  to it. Couple times on others but those I believe it got hot. Something had fallen over vent and I hadn't noticed. 
---
Yea i don't go down that low usually. I keep my hp arnd 50% almost always so I know very well my dmg output. But reapplying the mutation after clearing all of it, my dmg remains lower than before the patch. That is why I am suspecting there might be a secret nerf to adrenal or bloodied
---
It's utterly deadly with a stealth sniper build. 
---
I actually have a Ghoul Slaying Gamma Gun in my stash that I kept simply because I thought it was hilarious... the thought that what I thought was just ax simple curio might actually have a noble use *delights* me.
---
If I walk from a nearby location, it seems fine.  For whatever reason, the fast travel triggers the Xbox turning off...
---
I saw this and I'm so excited, Automatron was my favorite DLC because I loved making robots, I'd love a robot companion.
---
God I'm drunk. Took me way to long to figure what Cs ment. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm an aim down sights kinda guy. Don‚Äôt like bloodied. Seems more like health management to me :p
---
It kicks in sub 60% and is weaker, but nearly as strong sub 20% (the actual values are in the community patch notes and can be found in the sub somewhere)
---
In this case, I have to change my flair
---
I may give this a go after its fixed officially.
---
So it has been nerfed??? Oh well....
---
I work a lot on my camp, does that make me a Legendary Carpenter? Legendary Home Designer? Legendary Architect?
---
That's fuckin weird.
---
Where are ya when you turn it back on? ü§î
---
That is a weird one. The only reason I can think that your xbox would actually turn off is if it was getting too hot.  The only test solution I can think of is to make sure it's all dust free, stick it in a nice open place and then put a box fan blowing on it to keep it cool then try again. If it successfully loads then turn the fan off and test again to see if turns off again. If it does then somehow the load of that fast travel is overheating your xbox. 
---
It is weird!   And the thing is it took me a while to figure out what was triggering the Xbox turn-off.  I went insane for a while until I realized and tested the very specific set of circumstances.  Also, when I power back up my Xbox and jump back into the game it's fine.
---
When I turn the Xbox back on, I'm in Harper's Ferry, so it looks like the Xbox is crashing as soon as I get there.
---
Liking the looks of resetting my character to level one, I'm a grinder at heart. I wonder if there will be perks or just the title for prestige? 
---
Awesome, dude! I love reading things like this and i tip my imaginary hat to you for putting the works and thoughts in this. Please keep this updated as more information (or rumors) come in.
---
I think the legendary re-roll would be a lot better off being done earlier.
---
I would be MEGA psyched starting at level 1 if i knew that in the coming weeks there would be extra content added; as opposed to clearing content THEN getting the re-roll option.
---
I got it!!! üí° It's a us gov Xbox. Or it hates the bots ... "Soothing voice" ü§∑

If it makes you feel better I'm just over 300 hours in and only just recently learned about said water fountain, but I've got Plague Walker so I only use it to get rid of Glowing Pustules if I'm in a Nuke in White Springs or if I contract Blight.
---
That's what I initially thought, so I gave the console a thorough cleaning and made sure it was well vented.  When n it turns off, it's warm but doesn't feel overly hot.  It's not totally out of the realm of possibility, though.  It's just weird that it happens under these specific circumstances.
---
That is great news. I may have to finally hop back on. Maybe this can convince my friends as well.
---
Bloody strange, that.
---
DUDE, I HAD NO IDEA THAT EVEN EXISTED
---
I just compared the maps, and it seems as if The Satellite isn't the thing that is marked, ITS THE INVESTIGATOR'S CABIN!
---
Indeed!
---
I don't know where the hope come from consider they always break something while 'fixing'.
---
And shadow nerf stuff like we are stupid and can't tell the difference.
---
Maybe you're not wrong.
---
Damn, someone hit a nerve.
---
Equip the Green Thumb perk when you're picking the corn tato and mutfruit. You get double the amount. 
---
http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-vendor-map-2.jpg
---
With player vending. I would assume these will work at our camps. Gonna need to predetermine a locale for vendors.
---
Also, it is recommend that you disabling 'global c-state control' in bios for optiomal performance/stability.
---
A modest bios over clock with 'core perform boost' and 'global c state control' disabled is the best way to determine if it is the auto-boost or not.
---
I love that robot. Him and the poor sap at Camden park I stand and listen to his whole list of one liners. 
---
Are you in power armor? Fast travel to Harper's Ferry in PA is bugged on PS4 - doesn't fully crash the game but causes you to load into a black screen from time to time. Might be a related bug?
---
Same in the US. I came expecting to read a rant. 
---
That is a fucking awesome pic. Perfectly emulates the position most of us will have for a few weeks!
---
That might be, come to think of it...  I'm almost always in power armor.
---
Next time I get a chance, I'll try travelling out of power armor and seeing if that sorts it out.  I initially thought it was a bug related to my targeting HUD, so I tried removing the mod, but my Xbox still turns off.
---
Hope things get better for you man, let me know if you need someone on PC to play with!
---
I want a functional magazine stand and hopefully the possibility to hang them on my wall as posters. Some magazine covers are really cool.
---
I'm visiting this subreddit every day, but I'm not even subbed. Wouldn't put much faith into sub numbers on here.
---
Incorrect, the miscmods use a different keyword completely.  
---
If for some reason they changed how the engine hands the "noautoscrap" keyword they can just revert that change and re-add the keyword to all the bulk items
---
Fuck me if they can turn this game into a fantastic mmo i‚Äôd celebrate 
---
Truth, a whole one, no broken door
---
Invest some s.p.e.c.i.a.l. points into intelligence, more int =more exp (there are chems that give it a boost too, mentats... Ect), although it may leave you underpowered for a time
---
Not as of yet, at least.
---
Yeah, those are both great robots.  The raider vendor-bot at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort gives some good one-liners from time to time, too.
---
How many times has this happened to you?
---
I've strayed from the path, but this update has brought me back.  Thank you for not giving up on the game.  One more Firebreather, reporting (back) for duty!
---
I used to capture and recapture workshops back when it was good EXP and caps were easy to get. Now I feel you have to mindlessly grind your levels by slaughtering hundreds of super mutants.
---
At least you can always just do the main quest, since you need the access to the bunker.
---
Yes, but still quite viable for a bloodied build
---
Sure just remove another minor element of tension, why not?
---
I forgot about him lol! The lil diciple of chaos
---
This is vault 96 I believe. It opened a year after the bombs went off. They were US before the scorched.
---
stealth sniper melee build?!
---
Yeah, the robot says something like "I guess we can trade instead of murdering you..."
---
Fuck all the haters...great game!!!
---
I'm too squishy/weak to continue with the main quest right now tbh.  Hence the urgent need for levels, so I can respec out of being hot garbage.  Lmao.
---
Hi! I noticed you mentioned the Hopewell cave as well. Did you know about the Anthropologist‚Äôs holotape there? He makes a reference to an unusual custom regarding the transferring of remains of the Adena people and mentions that he‚Äôll do further research. Another anomaly! 
---
What weapon are you using with it?
---
Great communication. Honestly thank you for keeping us in the loop because I was very close to uninstalling fo76. Currently not a whole lot has changed since launch. (Not stuff truly important to players anyway.) But, this has given me new hope that this game will be entirely different and a great new experience towards the end of the year. I'm almost level 150 and have almost everything I could want. (Besides a respec since you guys nerfed TSE and EXP.. I forgive you.) So I'm gonna keep this game nice and warm in my library for you guys. I'll be ready when the time comes.
---
Mistress's of mystery count? 
---
if you're using deathclaw gauntlet, or mole miners gauntlet, or power fist, they aren't effected by the gladiator cards. they're considered "unarmed", not one handed.
---
Any updates on private servers and mod support? I enjoyed my time with this game but I always enjoy playing Fallout and Elder scrolls quite a bit more with mods to customize my experience.
---
no.
---
It's a dead woman ya find in several different locations one is in ws one of the cottages in a shower. Another is in Harper's I believe. They are wearing a black dress and have a damaged holotape and a worn viel on them. 
---
This is incorrect.
---
It just suppresses the negatives.. I have adrenal reaction and craft the serums alot when I need to remove the -50hp penalty from the mutation
---
I did indeed! I couldn't find anything about what he was talking about, so to be honest I feel like if it does end up being related to the DLC, that backstory is probably part of it
---
Yep!  Gets me back home with a load
---
If on pc, I can help you at White springs. 
---
I don't know how we did it but me and two of my friends managed to get one to ourselves. It was awesome. If I remember right we had got d\c all at once and hit play with team and when we went in it was just us. And stayed that way for hours. We nuked and farmed the holy hell Outa whitesprings. So smooth... No lag. No hitches. Nothing. I hope they add this i rally do. Others are fun most of the time but would be good just to slow down some too.
---
I was initially picking up things like teddy bears to put in my camp, then I was sad when I realised it wasn‚Äôt possible to place them :-(
---
I don't think single player would be fun tho. Maybe a team. But and entire server solo would be dull. 
---
This i also like. 
---
I'd absolutely love to be able to rename my favorite guns and admire them, the Well Oiled idea I'm not personally as thrilled with since there are perks like that already and for armor (White Knight, Gunsmith, Makeshift Warrior).  
---
I'd love to name my two main guns after D&amp;D gods of the Life Domains since they're a Medic's .50 Cal w/ +50% VATS Crit Damage, and a Medic's Gatling Gun w/ 25% Fire Rate and +250 Damage Resist while Reloading.  I'm thinking "Bahamut" for the 50 Cal and "Helm" or "Lathander" for the Gatling Gun.  
---
Also I want to name my Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet w/ +1 Endurance and +50% Limb Damage "The Prostate Exam From HELL."
---
Xbox , PS4 , PC, Switch ? 
---
Just dedicate your next 3-6 levels to damage-only perk cards and you're back on track. Do events/workshops for now
---
added, ign dabva
---
I don‚Äôt believe for a second that they‚Äôve been hard at work but I do believe it‚Äôs possible for them to turn 76 around.
---
Also I like your mysterious stranger reference.
---
PC, forgot about that.
---
I can't seem to invite friends from my list at the moment though. But I'm still standing at Grahm :P
---
VAULT RAIDS?! Can't wait!
---
Yes, I'm on PC.  Fair warning, I'm squishier than a marshmallow and will really only be able to tag stuff with a gun without getting steamrolled.  I need better gear, and have been trying to research what I should have, but there's so much conflicting information I have no idea anymore.  I got my mutations sorted out, except for *maybe* scaly skin, might be useful, but other than that....
---
Been using marsupial, speed demon, and bird bones to flit about rooftops and have a night vision suppressed something something lever action rifle I bought off Grahm that's been serving me really well from sneak.
---
Also trying to decide which power armor to build, and I think I want to make X-01 for looks and stats.
---
If you have time, I can make some coffee and log back on, and we can go from there?
---
---insomnia is a bitch, lol.
---
I like this idea 
---
currently in a group with CTRL+J but I'll accept after that gimme a sec
---
Have to move points, but yes, that's the plan!  Gonna get bloody mess and the rest of blocker (I am squishy. so squishy. a jellyfish. ugh), and then go from there.
---
I agree that card switching is tedious.  But as to why there are three each there are three reasons. 
---
 1 So you can't max them out two levels after acquiring the first card.
---
2 So you can have less than three point equipped and swap in as needed
---
3 It makes them way more complicated to share when you're in a group.
---
Guarantee they will kill budget :-(
---
Haven't gotten your friend request btw. Are you on PC/EU servers?
---
C.A.M.P DECORATING YES!!!!
---
Also legendary vendors?! I came up with this idea ages ago and I'm glad they've added something similar!
---
C.A.M.P Vending machines! FINALLY! 
---
My shop will now actually work like a shop!
---
Do you sell serums often?  Need Carnivore, twisted muscles, healing factor, grounded, plague walker, electrically charged and unstable isotope....
---
Quick spots with a handful, early game flat woods agriculture building, box on top of filing cabinet loose screws , outside of ag bldg three hangers and a two story shed behind. First hanger from bridge on top of red tool box, the room to the left will have a box on the floor, next hanger check on top of barrel next to wooden tool tote. The bldg behind on top floor there is a dresser with some teddy bears and a box of screws behind it. 
---
Morgan town , helvetia, quick easy desk fans, binoculars whenever you see them , handcuffs, check kitchens for salt or pepper grinders( green ones) toy cars, in Morgan town the high school in particular is a good stop for plastic pumpkins , toy cars , desk fans , pepper grinders , and lots more. Always go to McClintock for springs, there are 36 there in total . Always check wall mounted tool racks for little boxes of either gears or screws . And low level super mutants drop them fairly often. All that and more can be farmed very early game.
---
PC/US... not sure if that is the issue
---
Yeah. Worked fine for another dude from EU just now so that's all separated.
---
I dont have an account at that forum, but I uploaded an image here: [https://prnt.sc/mp04om](https://prnt.sc/mp04om)
---
Yes 
---
Give us Automatron 2.0 in Fallout 76! And let us create Robots as our own traveling merchants, so we dont have our camps revealed when shops release.
---
Im sure nobody would even visit my shop its so far off. 
---
I've got 5 legendary handmades in my stash. I only just yesterday figured out that by applying specific mods the weight can be reduced to 7.04 per rifle. I have so much more space now!
---
If hope it will be something like Monkey Knowledge in BTD6 with a skill tree to add points too. Minor buffs, nothing huge but still enough to make a difference.
---
The legendary player update is the most exciting for me. And dont forget about the legendary traveling merchant. 
---
This game is freaking fun. Screw the bandwagon haters, it's literally profitable for you tubers to pile on a game. So why anyone would listen to that echo chamber is beyond me. 
---
Not saying the game doesn't have serious technical issues, but Bethesda actually seems to be getting on top of them reasonably fast which is great. 
---
Im really glad i stick with Fo76 and didnt give up my hope for it to become an amazing game. Im hyped. 
---
Thanks you for the help.
---
Gonna try this out.
---
I think you're still onto something with the space station, the investigator's cabin is on the opposite side of the map so it couldn't be where that pin is. It's in the area near Twin Lakes and Solomon's Pond, just north of Huntersville.
---
You know that reparing a Camp with the Contractor perk requires almost no resources? (except the decontamination shower). And if you move it, everything will be automatically repaired for a few caps?  
---
On the other end, if you have 400 caps on your bounty, when a friend kills you, he will only get 200.  
---
I know, I'm talking about the pin where I thought the National Isolated Radio Array was, that is actually the Investigator's cabin, I doublechecked
---
Don't worry about defensive perks until you maxed your damage ones first
---
that is something you can do, but if you are a little short on junk to sell to vendors. just bulk up some ammo to sell. and with player vending comming up you could sell them to other players for a fair price. especially ultracite ammo
---
ohhh then yeah, I see it.
---
I still have support tickets in from close to launch of the game. Good luck getting a reply. 
---
Everyone seems to hate on this game, but I know that just becuase other things that aren‚Äôt connected to the devs are making bethesda look bad, doesn‚Äôt mean the devs aren‚Äôt always hard at work, we love you guys, keep doing what your doing!
---
How do I make my own?
---
I‚Äôve been doing that for a while, then when something released and I was under-expecting, I am happily surprised
---
I had a legendary ghoul begin his ascent to heaven in the Whitespring Clubhouse. I just managed to swipe his legendary walking stick before he floated through the wall, never to be seen again.
---
Imo they should go with the passive perks, so we have enough space for all time use perks like white knight, gunsmith. I hate switching vards for crsfting, locks and stuff. This would allow for more perk usage but keeping the special stats the same. They average around 6 iirc. 
---
I hope Beth no man sky's this game
---
But humans add a touch of realism to the game, it‚Äôs not meant to be realistic but you can‚Äôt suspend your disbelief to this level without any humans around 
---
Definetly brought hope back and Hype aswell. Cant wait for the upcoming features. 
---
I don't hack any terminals unless its to get someplace i really want to go, and then i'm annoyed I have to. I keep lockpicking loaded, I pick stuff all the time.
---
I can't do much damage if I'm constantly dying... but that is how I usually play games.  All out offense and worry about defense never, because I already killed everything.  That's why I'm so frustrated right now.  I screwed my build and can't play to its strengths.
---
They actually said "millions of you join[ed] us on this new adventure", so over a million people have played the game, which is in line with what we know of the sales.
---
They also said "We‚Äôre thrilled by how much everyone is playing, with an average time of 4 hours a day" which is possible.
---
The unknown is how many peopled are playing it now.
---
Generic repetitive feature request #9562 we *need* this Bethesda!
---
Yeah you could like EMP the place and you have a few mins to empty a secret vault or something
---
There is a lot of locked off rooms and inaccessible doors In whitesprings so the potential is there
---
No, there should always be a cap to how many points you can have in SPECIAL. They may increase it later on if they add more cards that are superior to basic ones but cost more points to use.
---
I'd also like to see some form of crafting using cards you don't need. Maybe even fusing them. Imagine needing not just 3 END but also 2 CHA for a card that combines effects of two cards and enhances them by a bit?
---
I read the article you cited on Wikipedia. Very interesting read! 
---
I guess it all depends on your build. If you're ranged, then try to be extra sneaky. If you're melee - put your PA on.
---
It depends on the ticket.
---
If it can be quickly closed with a 1-reply copy/paste response less than 24 hrs.
---
If it requires further involvement anything from a few days to whenever.
---
Said that it is nuanced. If you are 'someone' and/or you have built rapport with a CM in one way or another it can be fast tracked or escalated.
---
I hope these are quest/event/dungeon rewards, i dont want to pay money for them :I
---
No, but it gives me Pepe Silvia vibes :D
---
It's not a real event, its a triggered spawn at Charleston Station, but that only works if there is no C.A.M.P. nearby.
---
To trigger it move on the train tracks south to the red bridge and move like half way further down the tracks. Turn around and you should see something spawn at the barn across the Charleston Station. I will not spoiler all possible encouters, but there are many and one of them is a special responders vendor robot that also has a pack animal with him. He sells clean costumes and some other rare stuff!
---
Thanks again sir.  For your time and the plans.   I‚Äôll make sure the dups get out into the wild.  
---
@locke243 I think you need to enter the game so I can invite you. Or join me from the main menu.
---
Still got him?
---
It is possible the Autumn update will introduce some NPCs to the game. Maybe as a faction (BoS?)
---
Like it's still waiting for agent not even been looked at 
---
my alt has her camp on that junk node. I don't bother with the safes, they don't have crap in them. 
---
Did you claim a workshop in this server? If so, people can reclaim, step out the circle, travel to you and kill you directly even with pacifist. Your camp is also free to destroy. Only fix is relogging. 
---
Yup I'm still here.
---
Np man, any time.
---
This view will always baffle me. Just the idea of using feedback from the community being free labor amd bad. "I want good games but don't you DARE think about giving me what I ask for!" ....?
---
Okay, I'll join you. IGN: jchamlin
---
Do you see a plan for Park Bench or Stone Benches? If so, grab it and I'll buy from you.
---
Which mine is that? 
---
My favorite was the fox! He kept telling me you go away cause I stepped funny lol
---
Nope those aren't on the list here.
---
Obviously, the well oiled perk would be temporary, just a bit extra for 5 mins or so. But yeah, just a thought
---
I was trying to run melee with PA, but I think the problem there was the armor I was using... the baby excavator armor you can first craft.  I'm stocking mats for X-01 now though, so maybe a second try at melee is in order afterwards...
---
I used to live right next to pope lick, it was a weird area. I'm not quite sure how Bethesda would go about adding it though, considering Louisville is on the opposite side of the state.
---
Yeah, I don't know I'm not huge on the idea, I hope you don't think I'm calling it bad, I could see it implemented, I'd just rather have weapon renaming and admiring over that if I had to choose.
---
Then this game will die
---
I'm just glad I picked it up, and that since i did I've had a blast. I missed the first 2-3 weeks because of the negative publicity, I finally decided that i wasn't going to let people who for the most part hadn't played the game skew my opinions. took a bit to get into like all fallout games because you start out with shit, but now I'm over 300 hours in and find the game gets better every patch even when the bugs/nerfs/tweaks screw me over. 
---
Yeah, I get it, it'd for sure be a hard thing to get right balance wise, but I think it'd add sort of just that right amount of incentive to clean your guns, anyway, always good to have some friendly discussion!
---
Tbh, I really don't care. If I wanted to pvp, I'd go play wow or League of legends or fortnite or something where balance and rewards exist.
---
This does appear to be related, after testing.  Haven't heard of it on the Xbox, but yep.  It doesn't happen out of power armor.
---
Scrap ammo! Please!!!!!!!!
---
No, he walks a fixed route.
---
UPDATE:  This apparently is a power armor-related bug.  When out of power armor I can fast travel as normal.  When in power armor, my Xbox powers off without fail upon fast travelling to Harpers Ferry.
---
Deifnitely, the official Instagram is full of toxic people, I've seen people actually tell each other to commit suicide based on their opinions on the game, it's sickening.  The majority of fans I've met are chill and nice, while the majority of people who dislike the game are just plain rude and immature.
---
&gt; his caps are shared with some other vendor,
---
Watoga AFAIK.
---
Actually, I‚Äôm getting a different code now, [2:0:21967224] sucks cos its my Saturday night now :/
---
I don't like the idea of adding humans to the game, ruins the idea of us Vault Dwellers being the last surviving humans in West Virginia for me, make them non-feral ghouls and I'm interested.
---
The whole point is to NOT use the bethesda launcher.
---
I think it would be weird for them to introduce more carry weight systems, maybe the customizable part would let you move off some of your carry perks into passive backpack slots.
---
I just went there it‚Äôs not there
---
same thing happening to me.right now..but i can see that my friends are online playing right.now
---
Check email, might have gotten banned 
---
Which ini? If launcher ini, then there is 0 point doing it. It works perfectly fine on its own. The whole point is to NOT use their launcher.
---
i was on half n hour ago..closed the game to go do something.came back now i cant sign in
---
Nah, no email and never exploited anything anyway
---
consuming a duped nuka cola gives you a cap.
---
dupe 25k nuka cola. You have duped caps. aat least that is how they dupe caps.
---
March 12th is...less then a month away dude. 
---
I‚Äôd spend a lot of money for this to be a thing.  Private server with x amount of friends to join you.  We‚Äôve been talking soooo much about this the last week or two.  
---
Can't wait for that new faction of dead people.
---
And what's the point of doing it? Launcher works perfectly fine on its own.
---
You shouldn't call yourself an idiot. It's okay to be Pepega, DonMiguel33.
---
You might of been banned? Check your email for confirmation
---
Oh man I was just bout to go on nd play but everyone is having this issue apparently.
---
no reason i would be banned..i dont have multiple number of any items..no email
---
strange because my friends are online right now
---
In case someone is wondering where to put it. Fallout76Custom.ini in your [Documents Folder]\My Games\Fallout 76 Also just in case after you do any changes there make it read only, so nothing would mess it up.
---
Oh so I guess it's not everyone but there re other posts here saying they're getting login errors as well.
---
Is the game not dead anymore?
---
need my fo76 fix
---
What the hell are you talking about? Every game have bugs.
---
Fallout 76 was and is far from unplayable. Had a group of 10 of us who rotated around in groups. All of us played without exploiting, getting things done properly.
---
When we found bugs/problems/possible exploits - we reported them and didn't try using that for a while because it wasn't game breaking that XY didn't work.
---
People who say "Oh, exploits are in the game" are fucking pathetic. You deserve every ban ever. It's why every fucking game bans exploiters. Because 90% of the community report it, 5% never see it and 5% go "oh, we can use this to get ahead". The scum. The kind who download hacks and then say, "we only used it in warm-up" in CSGO.
---
Pathetic.
---
Have you updated the launcher?
---
no
---
Sir or mam; i do believe you don't got as much as you actually need to use, just a guess. 
---
Save too much junk? 
---
There are some junk you can't bulk so they stack up quickly. 
---
Save too much chems?
---
I got that duper and chemperk but sometimes i just don't need them because i can't sell quickly enough.
---
Save too much food?
---
Ever considered joining the cannibals?
---
there is no update available..i was on 30 minutes ago..left the game to go do something came back and couldnt log on
---
The megasloth was the best.
---
This could be cryptid far harbor 
---
Banned lol
---
Anyone collecting these or the valid vote? 
---
Didn't stop them from suspending me lol. And the emails took 2 days, after multiple tickets...
---
doubt it..unless they are just banning people.randomly for no reason
---
Well , what happened last week...
---
Happens on PC too.  Only tried in Excavator armor and happens 90% of the time for me.  Have to totally leave game and relog.   Seems like it happens on all platforms and bugs have been submitted.  
---
what happened?
---
A ban wave..
---
A ban wave.. 
---
Well, poop
---
My guess is that winter is hardcore mode
---
update..i just logged on..strange because i tested my internet and speeds were fine at 30mbps which is plenty to play online.so happy right now..i can put this rope away
---
Boring and dumb. PVP is not fallout. Don't know why they have to try and milk that cow. 
---
1 hour ago .. Damn 
---
I stack up meds way too quick.. At one point i was like "When the F do i think i need 50 bufftats?"
---
Any way of checking if I‚Äôm banned? Like bethesda account page or anything? This kinda my favorite game lol
---
Major server lag. So much for "300% server improvement since launch"
---
Yeah I second this. I am really excited for it but till then, I kinda have to know what is pointless effort (unlocking perk cards, saving skill points etc)
---
More instruments, one why are some in game but not craftable like the Mouth Harp, also why the hell are the Wind Instruments plans only good for the Tuba!?  Just call it the Tuba Plans if you won't give me more instruments out of it!
---
ok..well im online now so all good lol
---
I wish I remember where but there is an out house with a gold bar in the toilet.  Young could fill it with caps too
---
Well I hope your not. But I sent multiple tickets and got the email when i sent a login issue ticket
---
Hence why I said "aside". Ultracite ammo could also be duped, but without the hassle and hours of drinking Nuka cola. 
---
Was AFK a sec to go to the shop, so I'm still here ^^
---
The stag mentions very matter of factly that he's scared but will attack you in order to defend himself. Finished it two days ago for the first time, one of my favorite mini quests until now. I can recall him saying: "Why would you do this to me? I'm gonna hurt you before you can hurt me!" The silly voice just complements it so well.
---
I'm adding you now.
---
Huh?
---
Something something No Man's Fallout something.
---
Jumbo my friend, you yourself confessed to Glorf12 that you duped TSE's. Oh Jimbo, you lying bastard.
---
Not yet haha i quit trying :'(
---
Interesting! Good to know.
---
Same on pc
---
I picked up like 30 out of an ammo tin. Before xmas. And I never duped them, although was aware that it could bite me in the ass down the line....
---
Same here, in game it's fine but in the menus on the map thigns get cut off.  It's annoying but not my top priority on things that need fixing.
---
Considering how much hate this game gets from even the little things I don‚Äôt think Bethesda is going to include other things in the atom shop than clothes, furniture etc and skins. 
---
And..... your banned.
---
It's not legendary scrap.
---
&gt; Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.
---
I think you get a random legendary of the same type and level, and the more you scrap, the higher your chances of getting a better legendary. It's not like the dust system from Hearthstone.
---
Time again people bring this Atom store crap up but the store has never sold any non-cosmetic item, ever.
---
What do you play on?  If you're on PS4 I'd be more than happy to craft/mod some stuff for you, and I've got some supplies to share.  Always trying to look out for my fellow Vault Dwellers.
---
In 4 I used to collect rib cages and skulls and put them in a "ball-pit" area.  Computer would do some funky things trying to process all that crap.
---
Wonder where you stand on the whole thing. ...
---
Full metal jacket?
---
It doesn't strike me as necessary vs a time or leveling limited reset of points and cards picked. It would make more sense if it were a reset to level 1 that could not be re applied for a waiting period. This should already be available. Moving 1 point is a nice option for the times between where you are just trying out changes to which stat and cards you have in play at once. 
---
They're all free.
---
It‚Äôs a lot of geometry to collide in real time...knowing creation engine, I‚Äôd expect the unexpected.
---
Awesome! Thanks dude
---
Absolutely amazing, thank you Bethesda for sticking to this game, admitting your mistakes and saying what are your next plans. That's something many big game developers don't do.
---
Also reading trough thread about this on r/games makes me really angry. Just bunch of crybabies trying to shit on this game in every way possible and farm karma on it. Same goes for YouTubers, I'd bet there's going to be tons of videos shitting on this roadmap. Just fucking sad.
---
Can we also class it as a weapon so it can benefit from Lucky Draw?
---
Im really hoping to be able to kind of prorate the process. Like im a 155, can I do 3 legendary resets and be a level 5? I know thats probably not how it will work, but it'd be nice
---
It does for me, only perk card it doesn't work with is weapon artisan. Like I just want my 200% extra durability when I repair it, damn it
---
That's not a C.A.M.P., that's a vampire's face.
---
Yongyea would think otherwise 
---
You da real MVP. 
---
Because he thibks with his butt, that's why.
---
I've yet to meet him in 150+ hours (admittedly I haven't actively searched him out)
---
I imagine its just a picture of a car riding off a cliff.
---
Tomorrow I will be scouring the map for details to add onto this post, I will search Sugar Grove and a few others 
---
As non pa user,all i see is 60 pound wasted. 1 is enough.  In ocd therms tho,nice collection.
---
Was thinking the same thing, I loved the beta and haven‚Äôt picked it up yet 
---
same here ahah! 
---
I just found out, when I watched a video about how to farm disease cures because I always run low on it after a whitespring run :P
---
Oh that sounds good but also a little bit like: Grahm.. You gotta find him anywhere on the map ;)
---
a few:
---
\- ammo mods for all ammo crafting. add flame, poison, frost, shock, health etc mods
---
\- motorbike, trikes, quad bike crafting station. not fast, but chunky bikes, the main perk would be zero AP drain; to travel without those slowdowns. and a seperate portable stash would be cool.. mmm saddlebags...
---
\- some new bases/regular spawns for different BIG enemy mobs. like the WS golf club, but for each; super mutant, molemen, robots and creatures etc.. more new bigger Queens/Kings of all enemies that take a team.. like the SBqueen.. and different locations for different mutated enemies in nuke zone.
---
\- possible edit if if think of more :)
---
I am pretty sure the moth man cult counts at the carpenter... though they tend to not cut their wood.
---
I think that would work, I just kinda want more living non hostile npcs, st the moment we either kill them or it‚Äôs a robot 
---
Im gonna start using the ‚ÄúI have a plate of cookies for you!‚Äù Phrase now. Does sound raider-y
---
We will get more Enclave related quests soon‚Ñ¢, the story for them goes on, there is evidence for it in the yet inaccessible parts of the bunker.
---
The Overseer is alive somewhere, she gives out a mean holotape when you get to see your first nuke (even before you launched your own).
---
If you kill the queen thats the end of the story. Yes you can kill her over and over again but lore wise you only did once and thats the end of the scorched and the scorche beasts.
---
Slow clap is a clap that begins very slowly (as the audience is still recovering from the powerful performance they just witnessed) and ends in a volcanic eruption of applause. The golf clap might be more frequently used sarcastically. Either way, I think you're conflating real life applause with people trying to be sarcastic online.
---
And skip all that. Server crashed and got dc'd. So I'm no longer at Grahm.
---
I don't see the need for more NPCs but adding a few more traders who are ghouls would be interesting, I think it could work, but don't make a lot of them and maybe give them set locations/regions.  Also I don't want another super mutant trader because Grahm is special and awesome.
---
You have displeased the gods somehow. I recommend sacrificing a small animal to Todd Howard and the ghost of Pete Hines.
---
Probably lets you lock in your lockpicking and hacking perks, nothing more interesting, but fully appreciated.
---
I don't remeber which animals i "talked" to ,but i remember i was laughing like a maniac at those voices and lines.
---
These quests are always extremely funny.  Just like the one in the witcher 3 where you talk with your horse and you're both puzzled but intrigued. Then you start gallopping and the horse is all like" i love running".
---
Lol, reminds me of dwight;
---
"You learned a valuable lesson today, some tasts are not worth completing."
---
I make a horde of garden gnomes guarding my house!
---
yeah, I'm talking to a few friends who are still "blah blah, its still crap". oh how little they know!
---
Worth mentioning the UK has an autumn also not a fall ^_^
---
It's really not lol
---
Can‚Äôt wait!
---
Have you had someone build something tou dont have the plan for? Cos thats a thing that will stop you from placing your blueprint
---
Yeah, I don't understand why my CAMP sometimes can't be placed when there is no one else camping in the vicinity. It must be a different bug in the placement. 
---
The griefers will still mess with you, just in a different way.  Pacifist extending to player structures will never happen because if it did within a week we would see posts line this:
---
Came across this random guys CAMP and everything seemed fine, was breaking stuff down at a workbench when he randomly built walls that jailed me in one square of his CAMP, "funny joke" I thought but apparently there was a radroach near by so I cant fast travel with enemies near by and the guy is in pacifist so I cant take the bounty and shoot my way out. I just did all the work of completing the powering up event and taking the workshop now I have to server hop and lose it all. Betheada really should have seen this potential for griefing and allowed us to still hurt CAMP objects when the owner is in pacifist, do they not play online games ever? Sheesh.
---
What a dumb comment. 
---
They might add it? Generally a release date is a pretty good indicator they will add it.
---
Why not just save up the points for 5 levels when farming xp?
---
Was playing fine on Xbox this morning, no probs logging in here
---
GAMES AS SERVICE
---
Devs doing what they should have done
---
Wowzers, you stole my heart xoxoxo 
---
Lighthouse Souvenirs spawn at the Lighthouse in the woods that VTU built. 
---
I have never been able to make Steeped Fever Blossom Tea when I have all the ingredients.
---
Pffft No man's sky is the standard for turn around as far as I'm concerned.
---
From the launch "game" (Hardly call it a game), which was nothing like what was promised to an entirely over hauled title. 
---
It's basically an entirely different game at this point. Not to mention they don't just add content, they build entire new systems and mechanics. 
---
I
---
My camp is next to the space station
---
Looks like when the DLC drops, I ain't gonna get any sleep.
---
Since patch 6 the Dross Toss has not been giving me Mr Fuzzy tokens üò°
---
Laughs in No Man's Sky
---
yeh allgood now
---
I mean the extent to which NMS has changed is truly shocking. 
---
It's as entirely different game with entirely new systems, Mechanics etc. 
---
That's on top of just fixing what they promised the game was going to be. AND! they are still releasing significant free content additions and upgrades. 
---
It's a truly impressive feat. 
---
Oh I had no idea Bethesda has a Sydney office, would be awesome to tour someday be a great experience to talk about on stream!
---
Upvote the life out of this people !
---
I love how one rough launch/release and it's "I'LL NEVER BUY A BADTHESDA TITLE AGAIN UNLESS THEY CREATE A NEW ENGINE WHICH I AM ALSO AN EXPERT IN SO MY WORD IS CREDIBLE"
---
Yet, that engine has up until this point pumped out absolute sales machines 
---
I stopped reading at "the game is almost unplayable...."
---
Thanks to Reddit, the early warning signs of dumb fuck posts are easy to spot. 
---
Then why are you Here..
---
Some people are just so hell bent on hating this game that they refuse to accept positive change. Jesus 
---
Isn't this like six months from now? I'm still looking forward to it but idk if the game will hold my attention that long. 
---
I disagree. All though i think buildings should be 25x stronger. Make people have to use the workshop damage perk to even make a dent. Like common, how can someone shoot down an entire building. Just up the wanted per item in a house and call it done. Then raiders will just blow down your door, realize your not interested and hopefully leave. 
---
You have it
---
Except 1 and 2 (and Tactics if I remember right) that for sure have backpacks with separate inventory space and 4 where you can buy a customizable pack from creation club. 
---
So really, your "never" is just talking about 2 out of the 7 cannon games?
---
They weren't even Rad-emu!
---
Those ideas arent half bad now all we got to do is sit and wait 
---
As someone who lives in their power armor.. nice. 
---
Because it's the internet u silly nonce
---
Fuck off 
---
And PLEASE play through every song available before repeating any. Sometimes I'll hear a repeat after 3 or 4 songs, in the same server. 
---
a Internet zombie.
---
Oh shit another nonce 
---
Braaaainnss!
---
Fucking weird cunt bruv
---
Yup, it is the "Bots on Parade" event.
---
Can't understand? Does not surprise me. Zombie.
---
You're a virgin 
---
Ugh. They smell bad enough when they alive. 
---
I was actually in vasectomy thursday, because I don't want anymore children.
---
The ones you can get for free?
---
FACKING VIRGIN CUNT
---
Braaainnss!
---
Nah! Spotify.

How about Water Warlord

---
Description Purified and Boiled Water now weigh 90% less and can be sold for 3x Caps
---
Is Grognak getting repaired from Lucky Draw proc now? I wonder when they fixed that.
---
It‚Äôs Shr√∂dingers game atm, It‚Äôs simultaneously the best and worst game ever, until you play it. Then it‚Äôs either or.
---
Basically it‚Äôs much more stable, but the combat and loot systems are still hopelessly a mess. 
---
Atmosphere is still great, because Fallout, but the story and main-quest is still completely dull, because everyone is dead. 
---
I enjoy it, but your mileage may vary (a lot).
---
You already paid for the game. Why pay extra.
---
Is this thread full of bots? What with all of these positive comments?
---
This is probably right. Nothing great. Just another piece of over-priced clothing from the atom store.
---
Yup this. I have scrapped all the models, bears and cats I have found because they had no use.
---
Bugger. 
---
So this what an AA meeting looks like
---
On my birthday aswell
---
After 100 days there should've been alot more positive change than what has happened.
---
OK, now I'm considering getting the game
---
30, anytime Sunday-Tuesday, 7-11ish every other day, and yes. 
---
Yeah, at least it procs for me. I have luck of the draw maxed out so it procs a lot lol
---
Why would we need a karma system? This isn‚Äôt fucking red dead, there are no npcs and the robots aren‚Äôt going to cut you any deals. 
---
All the shit wrong with this hot mess of a game and this is what you want them to fix?
---
I don't air my opinions on the internet often, but I knew from watching todd talk about 76 that it would be similar to warframe, Starts life basic builds up over time to somthing worth its weight in platinum or atoms.
---
That hasn't been my experience. Either I end up alone or it's a rag tag crew that can't finish the job within the time limit. I've launched 5 nukes and not once killed her on my launch. 
---
Then delete a wall and watch the tsunami of fluff 
---
@Bethesda y‚Äôall should consider going F2P and keeping the micro transactions. I know cutting out the base price of any game=less money in the short term but let‚Äôs be honest 
---
Your game isn‚Äôt going to sell much now after everything the studio did. Going F2P would at least bring in some extra players that don‚Äôt wanna pay the upfront cost only to realize they don‚Äôt enjoy the game. Maybe they will and maybe they‚Äôll buy micro transactions. Look at warframe as an example.
---
Soon brother, soon.
---
You could just read the updates 
---
Glad to hear it. Cheers. I might swap my All Rise back for the ole Grognak then :D
---
Actually, after I lost it, I *couldn't* add the barrel. That's why I was looking for one. 
---
You do know what a slow clap means don't you?
---
Sorry mmatique.. too busy playing the game! Lol lol.. I don't get to play often anymore. I poured 100 hours in quickly and got a little burned out on FO76..
---
My girl is still asleep in bed so I'm squeezing in as many minutes as I can.
---
Ps4: Admanski come play üòÅ Current Char; seedy cop like dude (lvl 13) and Alternate Char straight jacket wearing hug monster (lvl 60+)
---
I was kinda hoping the Deathclaw would [say something like this...](https://youtu.be/3-ah5xJz6ZU) but alas he only remarked about eating me...
---
Maybe a ban ?
---
There are lot of things to fix, but it would be good if they would add at least songs from previous Fallout games (wchich they already have licence to use) I miss Uranium Rock and other atomic songs.
---
Nah, back in now. I‚Äôm thinking psn was down momentarily or something
---
There is always at least 3 fire caps in the basement of the vault tech gardening building at flat woods 
---
kill everything and move on
---
Just wanted to tell that there's nothing on top of N.I.R.A dish.
---
Well in fishing you would dump tree in the fake as Bass love brush.(Illegal to do before a tournament) but other than that no clue 
---
The ban wave wasn‚Äôt a random incident with random people chosen to be banned..... accounts were selected and rightfully so, nobody accidentally stores thousands of a rare bullet, repeatedly dropping and picking them up again.
---
No, he knew what he‚Äôd done and is now pissed at the ban.
---
Well there is literally too much to accurately list here. Either way I think you gotta find some time to do some reading to learn about it. But it‚Äôs very exciting!
---
why do the bethesda employees only respond to threads blindly praising them 
---
Yes.
---
I assume you mean 7 pm. Let me talk to my guys and we should be able to get you in. Do you have any opinions on pvp?
---
Point Pleasant was the site of a major bridge collapse the killed a bunch of people around Christmas time. If you check out the Mothman movie, it gives an artistic representation of the local folklore surrounding the event. 
---
I actually wanted to do a quack surgeon based character. A bit pity that stims etc are not rare at all and reviving people is basically free.
---
Game should be a bit more HC imo it's too easy
---
I picked up like 30 tses from a guy who was duping, I knew that it could bite me in the ass later, but I was low level and didn't care as much at the time.
---
I'm telling you that for sure I never had like 100k ammo or colas. I doubt I had more than 25000 of all items inc all junk and ammo in 30 days though. So that 100000 item thing is incorrect 
---
Thanks for the honest answer, I'll keep an eye open to snipe a copy at a good price and try myself then :)
---
I had this exact same thing happen last night.
---
Faster than light is already in the game, in the form of dead man running (agility)
---
Hopefully.  Once the mechanics of it are there, they can in theory make storage for anything you want I would guess.
---
YEET!!
---
That comment wasn‚Äôt aimed at you, i don‚Äôt have a clue who you are or what you do/don‚Äôt have.
---
I was talking about the one guy who ‚Äútracked‚Äù every bullet he stored and still got banned, because again, nobody picks up thousands of items and drops them to continuously repeat the process.
---
So i really do say again, every banned account knew what they were doing.
---
Thanks for this, really interesting. Think I‚Äôll give it a go on my alt. Something to keep me going while waiting for the updates. Thanks again.
---
You on today?
---
It means you have 50 less overall health points.... it‚Äôs literally right there.
---
They need sam jackson to do the voice for the queen.
---
I didn't assume jack shit, I was explaining the reasoning behind some of the outrage. Not that I participate in any of it. If someone has turrets up and I'm farming, I just pick a different server.   
---
So, rather, YOU assumed, because I was explaining something.
---
Absolute shit is a bit of an overstatement. But I do notice that certain areas frames are way higher
---
Yessssss
---
This is more plausible. Lol 
---
Why not let people be excited if they want to be? This game has been surrounded by extreme negativity and hatred since the very beginning. We don't need any more of that.
---
If it turns out that the roadmap isn't as good as it seems, oh well, too bad. But ranting about it already doesn't accomplish anything.
---
Let people be happy for once, ffs.
---
What platform? 
---
I love this game, I'm a 62 year old woman, level 116 gonna own it !!
---
They would, but just like the Reddit community, the positive people outweigh the negative. 
---
I can post something, and get downvoted immediately by the trolls, but eventually the post will gain traction and the upvotes will outweigh the downs.
---
Or my teddy bears that I have been saving up. They would look nice next to some body parts. 
---
And so the Moth man watched the Appalachians with his omniscient stare, but little did he know that he himself was being watched for once.
---
AD is working (only broken if you had it before the patch and have not lost it). It kicks in blow 60% health and is quite strong below %20. 
---
\-50 HP (health points) is reduced by the class freak perk
---
I'd like to be able to build storage boxes only accessible at my camp (apart from my stash). Then you could build the amount of storage you want, but would still be limited by your build limit (so it's not infinite). 
---
We even have labels/signs in the builder already.
---
O assume this os a keyword assignment when you say tag. I would assume they don't need a new keyword, since one must exist to protect the items that don't automatically get scrapped: baseball, beer bottle, assaultron head, stingwing
---
Bears,,,,bears everywhere...
---
I run into him just about every time I play for an evening (4-6 hrs).
---
I've been collecting them since it seemed to me like something which would mean something later on in the game.  It was a new item and seemed to be specifically named, which with Bethesda tends to be a clue to something in their games.
---
Why did you get banned? You want a sprite cranberry? 
---
‚ÄúDo that work for you‚Äù under the premise that you don‚Äôt have time, yet the time you spent explaining your lack of time takes your time away to do what you actually needed to do and probably could have found said information out yourself, instead you expect others to do it for you.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs a big pet peeve for alot of people, myself included.
---
Thank you for responding. I knew about the bridge collapse and I knew the legend of the Mothman, but I forgot that it was around christmas time.  
---
Have you played the other fallouts? Its alot different then they are.  But for me the trailers for the game seemed like it was going to have more content. Also when the trailers came out when you hear the word nuke you think chaos and destruction everywhere. Not death laws that run away from you. And Gouls you can easily one shot. In new Vegas cazadors where hell. Dearhclaws the same. The creatures in 76 are nice soft bunny rabbits compared to the other games. But that is just my opinion. Many others will have there own say. 
---
As I understand it (and I could be wrong) they would have to pay a lot more in royalties even with songs used in past games. 
---
I don't know if people said that, but I love customizing! The Robot Workbench on Fallout 4 was amazing experience! The mods in F76 are done really good, modifications matter depending on play style. The customizing backpack sound amazing! I'm definitely happy with the road map. Just give us more customizable stuff.
---
Might just be the chainsaw then, i‚Äôm a melee build, and my weapons keep their damage, everything from combat knife to a super sledge - aside from the chainsaw, because those type of weapons, chainsaw/ripper/my handy buzz saw
---
Are all terrible, even with Furious as a prefix
---
Disagree. Having all vendor machines in one spot. Wheres the fun in that? I play this game for the exploration aspect. Also if it's just an extension of your C.A.M.P. wouldnt you think bethesda would allow you to build it at a workshop you've recently taken? I mean not to sound like a complainer here but making all of the vendor machines in one place would just take away from the very idea of the game, for me any how. 
---
Back to new vegas, buddy
---
Yes, I played all the parts. I agree that the monsters are very easy compared to other parts, but still in this game there is something that keeps me and makes fun.
---
Most of them knew this wasn't going to be Fallout 5, but expected it to be anyway.
---
There could be random encounters where Chupacabra is trying to eat Sheepsquach. I think Chupacabra would fit right in
---
Their needs to be an option for most if not all causal or under armor clothing like blastic weave from fallout 4 that gives you small rad, dam, and en protection and maybe even +2 or +1 to certain specials. 
---
Take them DV's like the mutant scum you are ! 
---
I too would like to know.  The XP "curve" is really rather flat in FO76 ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a17b1c/exp\_required\_per\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a17b1c/exp_required_per_level/)), if it was steeper, then I guess there would be more weight to the argument for getting the prestige effect for every 50 levels if it can be obtained multiple times.  On the other hand, it is a bit of a kick in the nuts for someone like the original poster if that is the case (I stopped laying in the lowly 90's).  I don't think there is enough detail out about it yet though to tell, even though I would love to know.
---
My only gripe with this game is that with no human NPCs it starts to feel too desolate and lonely.
---
I always feel like with corpses in not-so-advanced states of decay that I JUST missed them or everything happened in the world recently but too far away for me to affect change.  I have to admit though after becoming used to seeing other players roam the land it did recede this feeling but I still wish I could meet someone from the brotherhood or the Enclave or somewhere.
---
Maybe on the roadmap? 
---
I remember when r/Fallout was so toxic that r/FO76 was created. Lately this sub has been so toxic that now r/Fo76FilthyCasuals is a thing.
---
Ohhhhh y‚Äôall wanna hit people with downvotes over this? Ok. Now I got to cut ya. 
---
Lol there are a lot of neat teddy bears in the game. It's nice to finally have a use for them.
---
Yeah everybody kniws by now how the game released. I don't see the point in continuing to whine about now. 
---
I honestly think a significant chunk of those leaving the subreddit are doing it because of the level of complaining that was going on.
---
People with over 500 hours, or level 100+ characters complaining about how bits of the game are too easy really tends to annoy you when you cant even get to that bit of the game yet because a random ghoul in that area is 3x your current level.
---
I play for maybe 4 hrs a week and am about to restart with a friend so he isnt alone in the early levels. I've made him some nice armour for level 1, a tolerable weapon or 3 to pick from, and once he has those I'll be sprinting to hoin him with my new alt.
---
Lol It's what every other loser gets. Seems fitting for this situation.
---
Only if I can make myself look like Hellboy ([here](https://hellboy.fandom.com/wiki/Love_is_Scarier_than_Death)).

God and make whitesprings even more of a cluster?

---
The people that complain about not enough content are usually the ones who play for 8 hours a day like it's a second job.
---
Why did that image automatically make it read it in an Australian accent? What kind of witchcraft is this
---
As someone who paid full price for the game.. This comment hurts me
---
Why? 
---
I grew up in Logan county, which would be down in the southwest corner of the map. In reality, my childhood home was about 10 minutes from Blair Mountain. 
---
Our local legend is The Ghost of Mamie Thurman, a woman who was brutally murdered by social elites in the early 20th century and is still rumored to haunt several locations in the area. 
---
That tale was used to scare the crap out of every schoolkid in the county when I was growing up and everyone has *some story* of encountering her. 
---
Would love to see them find a way to incorporate it into the game at some point.
---
yeah i can def see people going either way on this. that's the reason i think it should be discussed. and to note letting you add a vendor to your workshop is also a great idea
---
There were and still are some issues with the game ranging from mildly frustrating to "I hate this game!"
---
I also am not happy with the way Bethesda has handled these issues and their communication (Prior to the new roadmap, of course)
---
That being said I still find the game pretty fun, despite those frustrating moments, and I agree that we've seen significant improvement over the last few updates. 
---
The hate is overblown, amplified by YouTubers looking for views, and concentrated in online forums like Reddit 
---
Actually, neutral. I'm not gonna say he's not guilty, but I'm not gonna say he's "Obviously lying".
---
Explosive is not op anymore, but still a good legendary mod. If you want a strength gun build, you got heavy weapon or shotgun as your choices. I'm sure you know about all the heavy weapon perks with your past build, but good shotgun perks (other than dmg increasing) are scattershot (weight reduction and reload speed) skeet shooter (accuracy and range, helps vats accuracy too) and enforcer (stagger chance and cripple, honestly is op cause each pellet has an individual chance to trigger). Luck of the Draw isn't a shotgun specific perk, but benefits shotguns a lot more than any other gun, for the same reason. Also an fyi, the auto combat shotgun still counts as a shotgun in this game, and with enforcer you certainly could easily benefit from a faster fire rate.
---
I would suggest that believing in the hype is less dangerous for a free update than a full price game as you don't have and money to lose, just time investment perhaps.  The acknowledgement of the issues is also encouraging although I think it was slightly understated.  That being said, your TLDR is pretty much my life motto.
---
Use it in the radiation chamber in silos, but that's it. Emergency protocols with blocker is better in nuke zones if you like pa imo. It drains ap while crouched and still, but loses stealth while moving. I still lug it around with a jetpack and emergency protocols for x01. Maybe more uses for this year (hopefully).
---
Would it really be a fallout game without them
---
Can we link it to reddit karma, so we can downvote the ones that don't add to the conversation?
---
It's not a fix. It's a very rudimentary quality of life improvement. The period music always nailed the atmosphere and the more the merrier. Always the first fallout mod I use are extra radio stations
---
ƒ∞ts all true üëèüëèüëè
---
I hope they jack things up with survival
---
Legendary players should of been lvl  75-100 minimum literally 80% of players will be over lvl 50 by the time it releases. Becoming a legendary player should be harder I think 
---
Don't give it to him, he might dupe it!
---
Agreed. Can get some great fallout themed playlists! 
---
This is might be their way of "resetting" everyone before actual end game content comes out. Can't be much of an end game if everything gets one-shotted. Let's hope the buff is worth it instead of like Skyrim's 'legendary' system
---
yeah that's what i was thinking too. maybe they let us have 2 prefixes for weapons and armor? that would be nice. elsewise just adding 2 extra minor modifiers wouldn't really do much
---
How many ya got? I have found 14 valid votes. Team up for future domination? 
---
Where did they touch you?
---
I was personally unsubbed because I was tired of all the toxicity
---
There is literally no difference between that and how the system works now except that your method which you claim is ‚Äúless grindy‚Äù is actually worse because you have to grind 5 levels any time you want to do anything.
---
He wants to see if you can behave, so he can run away if you're bad or loot you if you're good.
---
The idea sucks, meeting a stranger in a post-apocalyptic wasteland should be an unpredictable experience.
---
I really hope this is what we're hoping it is. Having full reign to decorate our homes with all the items we collect will be the decider in me coming back to 76. I can't wait!!
---
Good call. Hell, I even miss the Fallout 4 main theme music 
---
According to the roadmap PvP mode will offer better rewards....I just hope it's a spelling error on their part instead of better drop chances for stuff
---
Oooh, I think you are right about that. I wasnt getting new mutations after I quickly got the first one.
---
Someone pointed that out about the cooldown /relog on an earlier post
---
Yep, it makes me think the playlist is even shorter than it probably is 
---
Some 10 year old squeaker spammed me with invites the other day while I was trying to do Into the Fire. He enjoyed telling me about how he could ‚Äúone shot me‚Äù if I made him mad. He ended up wandering away to bother someone else but I was pretty sure he was going to grief me. (Im a scumbag lvl 12, he had all the fixins at lvl 1 million or something) I‚Äôm so glad voice chat wasn‚Äôt a thing when I was younger. 
---
Whats the medic effect do?
---
Yes but the core game they released wasn‚Äôt a buggy piece of shit. GTA also had loads more content even without heists. 
---
Whilst I cannot mod any songs into 76 I would like to show you a possible alternative; A Playlist of over 130 fallout style songs which you can set to shuffle listen to via this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJI7PXQf-2v5wxep3I73uXyyi7AiV3UQr),
---
Yeah its an amazing turnaround too, i play that as well. But if you knew what a steaming pile of dogshit original ff14 was and then squeenix not only recognized it, but dumped the money into literally shutting the servers down and completely remaking the game, I mean it wasnt a case of patches made it better, its a completely different game now.
---
This was one of my favourite quests!
---
This game was hit unreasonable amount of hate, and if it was called something else than Fallout, it wouldn't have gotten that much hate. 
---
Beth should have been more clear about things, liket about the fact that just like ESO, this game was actually made by another studio, not by the studio that made ES games and Fallou 3 and 4. Beth Austin(Battlecry studios) had no experience with the engine or Fallout games.
---
This is not the only case. Even if the game is great, the way Beth has handled it's publicity has not been.
---
bear
---
Always be my beef was the lack of meaningful characters in any way really. But hopefully by the end of this year we get more to really invest it.
---
It does more damage against scorched and has  green laser instead of red but yeah, it's about as bad as any other laser weapon.
---
I take it back! 
---
I was curious, so I loaded up default settings with xmp and did a test similar to your video and get a solid 105 fps staring at the ground.
---
Most likely software... maybe a windows process (updater) running in the background? I have disabled mine. 
---
If this gets put in I want as many downvoted as possible but I want to trade people only the best stuff so I can look like a horrible person. 
---
There were some "human" ghouls, they got murdered by people that used to be their friends. 
---
I can't remember where the holotapes are, but it's pretty grim.
---
Because at the time, it wasn‚Äôt remembering it. I had to re-enter the username and password on each launch. They seemed to have fixed it now though. 
---
One thing I noticed about the keypad doors, you can't open them from the inside
---
As you level up now you'll be able to move points around with each level. Or you can swap your melee cards for your shotgun cards
---
I think you forget that 76 isn't Bethesda's only project that their developing, If the fixes where to come out as quickly as you want then they would have to push back the release date for ES:6 due to having more assets developing 76 rather than ES.
---
Agree. I hope increasing CAMP budget wont put too much stress on the server like stash / inventory.
---
Okay so basically when I get to level 51, I can swap a melee card for a level 1 master shotgunner? And with each level I can rank up each item? I was seriously about to make a whole new character lol.
---
TBH I‚Äôm pretty happy with the radio in fallout 76; it has more songs than 3 and 4 combined it seems. 
---
Hype is not trusting. Hype is excitement.
---
Yeah in middle of something so can you wait 10muns
---
What system are you on?
---
A few people were worried the system would be limited. Is this comment a confirmation that all items will be placeable? Within camp limits of course ;)
---
would have been awesome to have this info before I sold like 30 of them a few days ago :D :D :D 
---
run in borderless and look at task manager to see if some background process is activating?
---
I talked with a lot of people that didn‚Äôt know any of that when the game came out. They just bought it because it was Fallout
---
You can move points if you need to or simply take the new cards.  You still get a new card every level
---
We ran across a guy with over 1k (I think it was just 1005) when he decided to light us up at a mini camp trying to scrap and repair. We had workshops elsewhere, so he just smoked us and blew the crap out of the camp. I don't think either of us checked to see where his bounty was after that, we just waddled on down the road.
---
Whatever he was doing to raise his bounty, he was doing a lot of it. lol
---
It's not worse, it gives you the opportunity to gain respec points that you wouldn't have had instead of a random card pack that you might not want. 
---
My suggestion doesn't take away anything from the old system. It just adds a new choice. Many have complained about the inability to have a mass respec. This would give them that option without being too powerful.
---

---
Also; please for the love of Mothman give us fast travel mats for Camp too. :( I'm so tired of teleporting inside a wall under a bridge when my house is above it.
---
Yes they do this when they think you‚Äôre ignoring them. Not sure why area voice chat is so quiet, I‚Äôve tried making it louder in settings but no luck, It would be nice to hear what they want before teaming up but so far that‚Äôs the only time I can understand what people are saying.
---
Also; please for the love of Mothman give us fast travel mats for Camp too. :( I'm so tired of teleporting inside a wall under a bridge when my house is above it. 
---
What‚Äôs that you say? A random pack of 5 attribute reassignments? Sounds fun it‚Äôs in next patch!
---
Already completed that...
---
If you use the keypad it provides temporary power and that‚Äôs it lulz 
---
You can swap cards whenever you want now. But you can only swap points with each new level or pick a new card. So when you get to 51, you can either move a point, OR you can purchase a new card. 
---
Yeah the keypad switch has been broken for a while. I have made a few posts about it but it never gets any attention. 
---
354? Fucking hell mate. How many hours you got in fo76?
---
That was my immediate thought after I saw this quest stated in the roadmap. My friends that I play with and I found this cabin and read everything there, and just like you I thought it just screamed future content or expansion or whatever. After I saw the roadmap and got home from work yesterday I got in game and went right to there to refresh my memory actually 
---
Every new level you gain, you may either:
---
Swap a special point- So -1 Str for +1 int etc etc...
---
Or
---
Pick a new perk card. So if you fancy crafting ammo you can use 5 levels worth of picks and pick 2x ammo smith and 3x super duper. Once you‚Äôve picked a perk card, you can swap it for free at any time with any other perk card your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. level allows.
---
 Rather be playing Warframe anyway. Least you don't need to pay anything to play it.Ôªø 
---
Bourj. And I could definitely use some help with launching a nuke, I can't seem to do it solo. I'll be on in a couple hours.
---
Stop playing the game that‚Äôs how brah
---
Alright and do you possibly know why certain perks aren‚Äôt available right now? For instance, I tried to select super duper with one of the 8 pick a perks I had and it didn‚Äôt even show in my perk tree so I couldn‚Äôt select it. Is it only available to select on level 51 and up I‚Äôm guessing? 
---
Did you just take a picture of your photomode? I think you can hide the photomode UI
---
You have to add a switch or pressure plate to the inside of powered gates, the switch that is attached to the keypad on the inside can also make temporary power but you can‚Äôt interact with it. When you attach a switch to the inside you have to put hook the wire to the middle of the top of the door in the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù spot haha 
---

---
Funny enough you can shoot players with it and they'll glow until they relog. Pretty fun way to troll people.
---
Ah, so it is pretty much just garbage? Know the name of the plans for the power doors with keypads already on them?
---
Says 'lost sheep' on the map and it's called SHEAR terror... Possibly a wholesome questline where the objective is to locate and shear some long forgotten sheep to make sure that their wool is maintained correctly.
---
Ok. Where?
---
Sell bulk junk to vendors
---
Lvl 23 here. Genuinely did not know investing in intelligence gives you a boost to XP. How did miss that?... cheers!
---
I'd agree in principal, yet from a PR standpoint, not even mentioning them on the roadmap leaves folks like me feeling ignored. If you have once talked about the fact you're going to have a feature, you should keep people appraised on its progress.
---
Picture it like this: Three months go by and nuclear winter is the next upcoming release, yet without any of the Vault raids ever being mentioned or shown. Big fancy art is being shown off for the new nuclear winter game mode and yet no one is saying anything about the Vaults. You know they're working on them, they said so three months ago. But are they still on the way? Did they get delayed? Are they still committed to them?
---
Grind legendary areas then sell all the bad legendaries to vendors.
---
Oh, I stopped playing Destiny long time ago.
---
That was legitimately one of the most gut wrenching things I've listened to. The holotapes are absolutely horrifying and I highly recommend anyone who missed this side quest go find it.
---
Sadly yeah, you could use it to temporarily power something for fun I guess haha at that point I‚Äôd use a powered gate tho 
---
That‚Äôs a gamma gun, correct?
---
Either look on YouTube for specific rounds to do for cap stashes of my preferred way was to just pick up everything not stuck down then scrap it and bulk it to sell to a vendor. Then walk to the next vendor picking up everything again to scrap and bulk. Just go round all of them until you have claimed all of the days caps from all of the vendor.
---
Same but this games kinda trash 
---
Oh and it‚Äôs powered gates, they are pretty much available everywhere now 
---
Thanks! The name sounds familiar. I'll find em at some point during my run I'm sure.
---
1. The revive system makes sense. If you get obliterated in the face with a double barrel shotgun, there will be little chance of being revived, however if you‚Äôre getting beaten up with a baseball bat, then a revive makes sense.
---
2. Completely agree and this is something Bethesda said they are working on.
---
3. The event system is somewhat broken I will agree. The cost to travel isn‚Äôt overly expensive, the reward in caps alone is usually more than travelling to them, but a timer would make it 100x easier.
---
4. Vendors caps are replenished by 25% of a purchase price (up to 200) If it was any more, it would be somewhat open to abuse. The fact that they all share caps is good. Would just make this game boring as hell if I had to fast travel between 23 vendors every day, not to mention how much it would break the games already fragile economy.
---
5. New legendary vendor has been announced for May, so watch this space.
---
I have stealth boy on my T-60, the drain isn‚Äôt too bad and it‚Äôs fun in pvp 
---
Just pick up everything and sell it. Or do events if selling to vendors bores you.
---
I wanted to use it for tnuke launching to hide from the robots
---
intended apparently
---
&gt; Bulk items that are scrapped in the character‚Äôs inventory after using the ‚ÄúScrap All‚Äù option is currently working correctly based on the original design of the scrapping system.

Normal magazine sizes from Fallout 4, because it doesn't feel like a drum mag if I don't have 50 bullets or more. 
---
Gun buffs (not insane buffs, but make them equal or slightly greater or lesser than melee rn)
---
New perks \[mutant murderer: +10%/20% more damage to super mutants and mutated humans (could be implemented as a legendary weapon mod, especially with survival mode coming up)\]
---
New weapons (ballistic shield, used along side a pistol or one handed melee, new slug shotgun,)
---
New legendary weapon mods (overheating: +25% fire rate, +10% damage, incendiary effect, -30% durability)
---
Just some wishes and ideas
---
Yep, what's your gamertag
---
Can others throw the switch on your keypad powered pylon? I‚Äôve got a base with 2x garage doors, powered open from the outside from 2 separate keypad pylons, and then opening both at the same time from the inside.
---
Many players have came to my base, and walked up to the switch but not used it which i find odd because if I saw a cool looking camp with powered doors, I‚Äôd sure as heck want to see what was inside.
---
But, you know how these comments go: now I ask, why you are here, and you answer something that makes no sense.
---
Here we go: why are you here?
---
Bc this bum ass reddit put this post on my home page 
---
So I decided to give u advice
---
Doing nuke zones repeatedly can really heap on the experience. 
---
TL;DR
---
Case closed.
---
The damage bug is back and can make the fight soo much harder than last patch. Failed to kill her tonight by 10% HP left after regeneration. I don't recall ever failing to kill her before. Left the event with 3x .50 cals and 1 laser gatling broken with about 7k ammo spent.
---
Mighty kind of you stranger! 
---
Progamer56737 
---
It is hilarious that they ban people for exploiting their engine that has a rainbow of bugs which to pick your poison as to speak. Kind of a flop as a MMO there, no anti-bethesda or anything, just pointing out the obvious.
---
Even though I do not use these exploits, I have sympathy for the people who do for their punishment is not fair.
---
Can't wait for the release of private servers and real modding, so we can finally get the hard working modding community on these things.
---
The community &gt; the company, so there will be more resources to use.
---
It could work if the new settlers had been inoculated like we the reclaimers are. I would like more non human npcs. Like ghouls and mole men traders.
---
You can't be too careful when it comes to a stranger who wants to invite you into a group. They can see the location of your CAMP, teleport there and destroy everything. Happened to me the other day when I was making my way to Whitespring Resorts to sell some stuffs I was watching this person shooting the robots. And when I was about to enter the building he threw a grenade to the nearby vehicles, hoping that the explosions would kill me and take all my junks.
---
So I followed him and returned him the favor by shooting all the cars that close to him. He noticed and shot-slapped me. I ESC, turned my pacifist off and killed him twice lol
---
I can see this as another controversy youtubers will milk, it'll probably reset your level and give you like a star and all the buffs but you'll need to get to lvl 50 again to rank up, people will complain about how they wasted so much time reaching level 40043 only to reset
---
This is the way i lvled all my chars.
---
Put at least 3 points in str and use all lvl 1* 2h melee perks as far you can. So you get 30% more dmg and you didnt waste lot of points. Lvl 1 Blocker is also a nice to have.
---
If you play with friends put 3 Points in Charisma and get lvl 3 inspirational 
---
Hit lvl 25 and build excavator Power Armor.
---
Build your camp near Whitespring.
---
Take a rest in your bed for 5% more exp before each run.
---
Grind the golfclub 24/7. 
---
Harpers Ferry is also nice for lvling.
---
"Bobblehead : Leader" is also nice and helpful.
---
I hope this helps you out 
---

I am a huge slut for mystery and wild wasteland type stuff. If only this extremely well crafted content, like the Interloper, was contained in a game which wasn't such garbage to play and explore for even 5 minutes at a time. Gives me such a migraine that I would have to wade through such digital sewage as this to delve into all the mysterious things in the game.
---
Another player. Saluted to her/him, and moved on.
---
Are you serious? 
---
That happened to me, too. But I was at Whitesprings, after I cleared out the golf club. I was at the sulphur fountain getting rid of a disease when I heard the music change and looked up and saw a level 91 deathclaw just behind the bus. I was expecting for it to come and attack me, I'm level 41. But it didn't... So I went to it. I hit it with my hammer and it took off, leading me on a chase through robots, ghouls, all around Whitesprings. I ended up getting attacked by 4-5 ghouls from behind, so turned around to take them out, and when I had turned around again, he had run off and I couldn't find him again.
---
Blah blah blah backpacks blah blah.
---
Looking forward to new content and goodies.
---
According to data mining you can't leave BOS from scrapping. I believe the missing plans are on the known issues list. I wouldn't put resources into scrapping more combat armor.
---
If you can pick a perk card ..it is available you just have to swap it in...based on how many point you have in luck...if super duper is a 1 pt card...meaning you only level it up once...you need to have the available space under luck..you have to take a card off of luck and swap another 
---
Wendigo. Screamed like a girl and jumped back out of the room while the level 40 I was hanging out with took care of it (I was level 12).
---
100%. I love this outfit
---
When I first got the mission, it pointed at some house but I logged off and I just went to Wendigo cave to complete it. It removes the quest and gives some caps but it always comes back.
---
Having read the patch jotes for this month, I wonder if the quest is bugger and did originally require me to kill the one at the house but logging off bugged it.
---
Patch notes: Apparel:¬†The Clean Clown Outfit now correctly counts toward completion of the "Kill Wendigos" side mission at Freddie's House of Scares.
---
Do the circuit. Start at Harper's Ferry, then head south to Watoga for the Shopping Plaza and Station, follow the train tracks west through Big Bend Tunnel East, that takes you right to Lewisberg Station, head northeast to The Whitespring Service Entrance, and your last stop is Whitespring Station. They each have 200 caps so you can make 1200 per day. Supermutants also always have caps so you can farm them. Your final option is to trade with other players. I've never tried it but I suppose it could work.
---
Mechazaku here, it was so fun helping you out gather research for this man! I literally got giddy when I was getting off stream last night because of how much new life this investigation breathed into the game for me. It just goes to show, the truth it out there, if you‚Äôre willing to look for it. Happy hunting, wastelanders. 
---
Thankyou! I did not know that, does it do less dmg against non-scorched, like the receiver does?
---
Mothman, he scared me. I dealt with it by dying
---
you were attacked because u owned a pvp workshop.  u are just speculating that its because u didnt accept a team invite.  sounds like he was planning to attack you no matter what, accepting the team invite however would have showed him where ur camp was.
---
I'm LeJonBrames92, I think I sent you an invite
---
Definitely either the wendigo or the sloth. Sloth is peaceful and all but my first encounter (sneak build) was turning to see one grazing right next to me, about had a heartattack thinking it was a deathclaw about to screw my shit up haha
---
Two players. One sits or places camp on the Forbidden knowledge BOS Camp. The other places camp near whitesprings. Go to the Enclave Bunker and get two tech data. Fast travel to him or camp for free and turn it in for 30 caps and random rewards. Fast travel on camp next to whitesprings for free and repeat until there are no more tech data. 
---
Next fast travel to vault 76 for free. You are looking for a trailer North of Anchor farm and East of Tyler Fairgrounds. On the map there's a cliff drawn there it's at the bottom. Cool looking table with balloons that spawns a bunch or board games and hats but to the point .. clear that trailer area and if you want lay down camp. There's a junk node here. Trailer has around 14 safes. Great place to find more tech data and random plans. Repeat previous process until exhausted. 
---
havent successfull killed the queen since the patch. guess we are waiting for the next patch to go back to the only endgame content we have.
---
I'm thinking that legendary characters will have some passive effects on our perk cards. No more equipping picklock / hacker perk cards, expert and master.
---
Or a whole new set of perk cards that can only be obtained by legendary characters = more character progressions.
---
If you buy it and it can still scrap junk then it was still a worthwhile purchase 
---
I snuck up so close I had to wear a gas mask to no die from it's fart. Even got a pic, but sadly have no means to post it.

---
IF this is what it is then it they should absolutely be called out for doing it, it would be 100% recycled content forced down your throat for the "legendary" benefit.  If I wanted to level a new character, I would start a new character...For me the content just wasn't that interesting to have to restart again.  I sincerely hope they are smart enough not to reset people back to level 1 so they can restart with an extra shiny thing.
---
Maybe I been unlucky, but I haven't seen a nuke zone in a couple of weeks. 
---
Wendigo.  "What in the world is that thing?  Let me shoot it with my sniper rifle.  OH CRAP!  I made it mad and didn't even scratch it.  RUN!"   And then I died.  Those things are fast.

I like the idea of making booze in a post apocalyptic scenario.

I was rewatching BSG and about only 8 episodes in the deck crew and secretly making moonshine because there is no more booze.

The server chucks you out at that moment and all your holotapes are gone. I remember when I put my best weapons down for a second...

Looks more like a weapons workbench to me. I think you need to play even MORE Fallout. üòÜ
---
It‚Äôs effective in PVE also
---
Is it odd that i expected more lamps? its still an amazing build though - well done
---
I like this game, however it deserves all the bad reviews, I don't understand why everyone must either be a fan boi or hate the game, there is a middle ground. It's a decent game with a lot of issues ran by a company that was caught doing shady practices , in short, I will definitely come back once they add some more updates 
---
I mean, considering Bethesda's track record, I'd go with the last option. 
---
Wait nigga u ain‚Äôt even op tf u smokin 
---
Yup. And there's no way to lock it or anything. I'll try and lure some more people back to my baseme-uh, C.A.M.P. and see if they can also hit it. Maybe it was a fluke, but the other comments here seem to confirm thats its just for looks. Or some obscure, non security thing.
---
True and i really like the outfit looks like it fits the scenery well
---
Same works for any special point..you were saying have melee build under strength but want shotgun....just take down your melee and add more shotgun perks it's as simple as that..much different than previous fallouts..but if you want to change a point under special and add to another ..for example if you have 15 under strength and 7 under luck..and want 14 under strength and 8 for luck ..you have a choice after level 50 to move a point or pick a perk

Nitpicking? Sure, but there's your single lie. Period. 
---
you shouldn't judge anything at all by up/downvotes on reddit, especially on this sub.  these places are echo chambers, even if u have a great idea that is completely fair u can be downvoted to oblivion by people here.  that is why so many have left this sub, for example.   u cant mention anything PVP related without getting downvoted because majority of survival mode players have left this sub and all that remains is adventure mode players who dont want any time or resources being spent on survival mode players.

I bought Red Dead at the same time so I got sucked into that and new I would come back to Fallout eventually. Definitely glad I did.

Can I knit it?!

Oh shit, thanks dude, that's really helpful. I have a core assembly T-60 chestplate and the T-60 jetpack, but it's not really worthwhile having the jetpack on all the time.

It is true that it is very difficult to code a game. I made very basic games in college and earned quickly in the real world im not that good at coding. What most of us are upset about is the fact that this is a company that claims to be professionals and this our expectations are much higher. Especially seeing as we paid good money for a professional product and they gave us something half baked then continued to patch it with half baked patches. This whole thing has been a huge black eye for them. Maybe not monetarily because, as usual, we all thought this time it would be different. I think the company is staffed by people that I would label "80 percent-ers"
---
Well to be fair you're gonna have new content with the roadmap, but I imagine the legendary benefits would be better than staying level 30042 anyway, since after 50 it really doesnt do that much to your stats
---
This is the most likely scenario, and at that point unless that backpack offers some sweet bonuses I‚Äôd probably skip til it‚Äôs fixed. 
---
There are 7 total vendors.
---
Free states.
---
BOS
---
Watoga
---
Whitesprings 
---
Enclave
---
Raiders
---
Responders.
---
I have my camp just west of watoga up in the hills, so I‚Äôll start at watoga and do the station &amp; BoS vendor. Then fast travel to r&amp;g for raiders, then to Lewisburg station for responders. Next it‚Äôs off to whitesprings bunker then the train station, and a quick fast travel over to Harper‚Äôs ferry for the last guy. I think it‚Äôs costs me about 60 caps (With travel agent perk) to earn 1400 gross caps.
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a real fallout game, it‚Äôs an online FPS with a Fallout theme and a Fallout name. And it‚Äôs buggy as all hell
---
Only 135 most work benches with out stuff cost that much
---
I‚Äôm also trying to learn deep pocketed - is that bugged also?
---
It cost a lot of money to hotfix for consoles plus Xbox and PS dont like it. So chances are no. It‚Äôll get fixed the next patch.
---
Personally? I think it‚Äôs too simple looking to be so rare. I got lucky off Heart of the Swamp, but my buddy has been grinding since beta for it. 
---
Fucking Wendigos
---
i was not prepared for that firefight when I was a low level with shit guns I thought it would die kinda easy like ghouls but nope got my ass shredded 
---
From what they said, it seems like it'll offer carry bonuses at the very least. Which is awesome, backpacks should havd been in the previous vanilla versions of the game. 
---
the non-hostile scorchbeast at the morgantown airport.  I hid in the hangar buildings like a baby.
---
Never lost my camp either, not sure really why this happens to people, sometimes it doesn't load so I just relog.
---
Mole miner. Heavy breathing in my headphones. Dealt with it by spinning around irl, the doing it in game. Then having to hunt it down because the sound directionality and distance was/is horrible. I heard it on my right; it was on the second story to the left. 
---
I got lucky from a low level sold it for 1000 to me cause i said its rare but try ig its simple but its stylish unlike the tattered field jacket vtu jacket and cap are my second favorite
---
Accurate 
---
Antiarmor beats TSE after the nerfs, someone did the math on it and the antiarmor is superior after the tse nerf.
---
As for rust, rust doesn't have a trade economy. I even specified in my other comment online games with trading economies. Rust you create everything yourself. Thus making trading pointless. When you talk about a game with a trade economy I'm talking about games like Diablo 2, path of exile, etc.
---
As for your claim about Bethesda should have only went with consoles and they'd be in a better position? ROFL have you seen the backlash against the New metro game for even threatening that? It would have been even worse for Bethesda than this shit show of a launch and patches this game has been already. Much more dupers and exploiters are onx console because Bethesda has no real way of perm banning console players. So the console players are still out exploiting even after the bans. They have no reason not to.

It's a very hypocritical place of controlling complaining people who don't realize they're griefing someone because they didn't follow their unofficial rules that they justify by calling it etiquette.
---
Real etiquette is being considerate, server hop before you cost someone a crap ton of gears and circuitry, talking about etiquette over ghoul farming, god damn.
---
I saw a ghoul farm tower once, it had nothing but turrets and a few floors and stairs and walls .  I didn't destroy it even though I was ghoul hunting, I continued my circular route and left them alone because I'm not a griefer and I won't make up excuses to be one yet pretend not to be.
---
Just wow at how hard it is for some people to realize how they're behaving.
---
Babies need a lot of attention 
---
yep same happened here, but i'd do a reinstall of the games cuz i kept being trown out. maybe that's the reason?
---
What's your gamertag
---
Out of 5 post-patch SBQ fights I have successfully killed her once.  The loot took 27 minutes (no shit) to load.
---
The one last night she kept floating higher and higher in the air and stayed there for 11 minutes straight, making it impossible for anyone other than a rifleman to hit her. 
---
Had one a couple nights ago where she flew out of bounds for 9 minutes, only to return with 45 seconds left to kill her. 
---
Most of the time lately, we start the fight and do really good damage, then almost zero damage because people leave or get kicked.  She needs to scale to the people actually PRESENT and within a certain number of feet, not scale once to 16 people and stay with max buffs while the remaining 3 people fight her. 
---
Thats pretty clever. Now that perk to make pa parts lighter has some use
---
Fine, send the money and I‚Äôll mail it. Should only be 3 to 4 business days. 
---
Omg please stop trying to poop on peoples fun and excitement? 
---
A little off topic, but is there a way can we put things where we want to on the hot wheel? I want my best stuff at 12, 3, 6, and 9.
---
I tried to do some searching for where to find this coat, but no clear answers. Sounds like it‚Äôs a quest reward?  Could somebody point me in the right direction?
---
Hmmm. If someone was really interested in this, and knew alot about it; maybe Beth would be disinclined to detail exactly how they caught them, so they wouldnt know what to do dif next time.
---
Putting a cap of 25k when single items can easily be worth more than that is far worse. Not to mention almost every online game has a "currency" that was decided by the community not the developers. Diablo2 had 3/20/20s and high runes, path of exile has the mirrors. None of those hurt the economy of those games they actually stabilized the economies because of gold caps also existing in those games while those items I listed had no max cap.
---
Your post was caught in the spam filter for an unknown reason. I'm visiting my parents so have been minding the cat since I woke up - sorry for only seeing and approving this now! 
---
Nobody put a gun to their head and said "do this glitch". Whatever happened to people knowing the difference between right and wrong? Whatever happened to personal responsibility?
---
 Just because a glitch exists doesn't give you free license to exploit it. Pretty much every company out there bans people for exploiting glitches. This isn't unique to Bethesda. 
---
Try those excavation maps

He was standing next to me the whole time he was talking; he only attacked me when the notification about me declining his team invite appeared.
---
650+
---
If Bethesda can get their shit together and not continue to release buggy patches yes. Unfortunately that hasn't happened yet.
---
i dont see why we needed an 800 stash size if we can have mule characters.  personally i did fine with 400
---
This is simply a case of not thinking about it all the way. They did a database query for "more than 100k in less than 30 days". Which catches the people duping, the people really good at the game, the people that picked up a bag of dropped junk (my problem), the people that hunted dupers, the people new to the game that accepted large trades from strangers and all the other reasons you've heard around reddit/internet.
---
A bunch of 80%-ers at this company.
---
Lol! No you don‚Äôt. You just have to wait.
---
Sheesh trying to game the system before it‚Äôs out. 
---
Bethesda have said they're working on a system to let players track events but timers won't work because events can finish long before time runs out. 
---
This is so true
---
I know the bulk scrap thing is annoying in the least, but just in case you didn't know, Whitesprings is full of plastic as well.  A lot of players ignore the Nuka Cola cups at the pool concession grill and laying about.  They are plastic
---
Weregoat much?
---
Excavation maps won't get you that much in that short of time. But they are really good if you need all sorts of ores.
---
Not positive on deep pocketed, but I believe most of them are also "elite" mods you can learn from scrapping. It's just the vendor loot that's broken. They've never been available from scrapping to the best of my knowledge.

not sure u can 'smuggle' anything with no laws in place making that substance illegal.  selling alcohol in the wasteland is much the same as selling fertilizer.  especially since they are adding vending machines.  u wont even be traveling to sell the alcohol.  no vehicles to race ur way across territory lines.  alcohol vendors will be more like bartenders or liquor store owner/cashiers.

Fallout 76, I had massive freezing as well.  I turned shadows to low, ran game as administrator and shut down other apps that were running in background before launching the game and have had  no more issues.   if running afterburner or my corsair programs in the background game would crash right away with them off, runs great.  gtx 1070.  May be try a few tweaks if you have not already.
---
Pick up all cosmetic clothing like preachers vestments, rangers outfit, etc. Thrn sell them they can be worth a lot of caps. I prefer the ski lodge because you can easily collect 50+ ski outfits which sell for like 20 caps at vendors with max bargin perk.

Yeah, my friend has built it in my camp. That blows.

1. 1.the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence.
---
Lol I wish you could
---
There are quite a few ways to make Caps though.  Cap Collector used to be a good one (it's been changed so you have to additionally Search the container, like with Pharma Farma).
---
* Getting Rank 3 Hard Bargain.
---
* Selling goods to vendors.
---
* Bulking and selling junk components.
---
* Killing the Grafton Monster reliably yields a good 15-20 Caps (two always spawn around Charleston).
---
* Using Green Thumb to increase yields, pick flowers/fruits/veggies.  Each is worth *at least* one Cap.  Blackberries, being worth 2, quickly add up.
---
* Retrieve weapons from dead enemies and sell them.
---
* Set up a bunch of water purifiers around your CAMP and sell water.  At Rank 3 Hard Bargain, each is worth 4 Caps.
---
Face it guys, the only *real* Fallout game was Wasteland.  Isometric graphics that don't let you use your imagination are for filthy casuals. 
---
I found it as well a long time ago. I thought from a quest you get at it, that there would be some password to unlock the terminal. I was thinking I may have missed it, but this makes total sense.
---
Isn't that the map that's under the NRG Bridge?
---
I should really figure out where to find all the weekly challenges, but getting random dabs of atoms is cool too. It‚Äôs a nice surprise.
---
‚ÄúNow‚Äù meaning weeks away
---
Pre-release info didn't showcase content, just gameplay multi-player. But it is a good idea for people to have realistic expectations. If the game hasn't excited you thus far, it probably won't now. That said, I can't wait. 
---
TSE and anti armour aren‚Äôt exclusive. You can have both I personally rock a two shot, anti armour, quad mag pipe gun and I love it. 
---
Unfortunately, there are a handful plans like this (Water Purifier - Small is definitely one of them).
---
Hi, I was curious if anyone can elaborate on the following point:
---
* **New Vault Raids: Vaults 96 and 94 Opening** ‚Äì For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids.
---
I'm curious if it will be possible to do them solo, I guess it's something I may just have to find out on my own when the content drops. Regardless sounds fun - it may be one of those things were you can do it solo but a group is most recommended.  
---
Wait... so did the Flatwoods monster crash the Space Station and survive it? That would be such a great story.
---
That is most helpful; I hate trying to select a weapon stuck at 10 o'clock and accidentally swapping out armor pieces (See? I brought it back around). 
---
Dude, I only had like 500k Sprite Cranberries.  How did I get banned? 
---
Classic two sides to every story scenario here bosshog
---
Kick in the head from New Vegas for the nostalgia 
---
Decorate first then scrap. 
---
Try the breach and clear, or capture a workshop. There is one with 3 copper mines on the map. 
---
On the latter, I had a low level asking for .44 ammo, so I told him to wait here and invited him to a team so I could quickly travel to my WS to craft ammo and then fast travel right back to him free of charge. (At least I think it‚Äôs free, I don‚Äôt team up often.)
---
Stack three stair cases and put walls around it, and then fill it with Teddy Bears. If they make it to the top, then they get a prize.
---
So I was mad about this but I ended up just getting rid of it and re applying. Just travel around to high lvl players and see if they can sell you some mutations. I got all mine for 200 caps each and made a new friend that had a cave base. He was from WV too. Much happier now. 
---
I'm upset I paid hard earned money for a product I can no longer access because their database query to find "dupers" was too greedy. Instead of using that data to then find where the items came from they just hit the big red button walked away and said "f'em all we have their money anyways"
---
Perception helps with range a bit on your guns.  And the agility boost is really nice if using VATS, as is luck. 
---
I'm running a sneaky vats commando with a bloodied auto  combat rifle and it's really fun.  1-2 shot most regular sized mobs, crit meter fills like crazy.  I don't get hit much so I go unyielding. 
---
When I do get hit though I die pretty damn quickly. ;)
---
Damn, nice score.
---
Molemen.  I dealt with it by shooting them.
---
Was the cave base at Seneca Rock?
---
Are these updates free or is all of this paid content?
---
It isnt live but simply refreshing it gives an up to time location of everyone
---
they would make PVP scenarios even more exploitable, personally im waiting for survival mode where there will be no dots on the map other than teammates
---
I am assuming you can get your health pretty low and snipe from distances with a higher damage output with unyielding and not worry so much about getting in the fray as you would with melee build. I am about to try it myself. Good luck. 
---
Those mole miners scared the shit out of me when I fist met them. 
---
Bloodied power fist, Furious deathclaw gauntlet, instigating +10 while aiming lever action rifle. Oh and a sturdy assassin‚Äôs sentinel combat arm. Not heavy but whatever!
---
I don‚Äôt get good legendary drops. Dumpster diving at vendors is always how I got something nice.
---
You can swap cards at any level....you can swap special points after 50
---
Who needs a siren when you have a bottle alarm. As someone pointed out though, It may end up being static objects to prevent server issues. However, I think it would be fun if it worked.
---
And they actually worked it into the game's story and lore. The servers didn't just shut down and reboot, the world ended and was reborn. They turned it into a huge [in game event](https://youtu.be/YgEg8kXmifo) with a big fancy cinematic and everything.
---
They brought in a new producer/director, and rebuilt the game, from the engine, graphics, story, maps, over the course of like a year while keeping the old game running and supported.
---
1. I rarely have any technical issues with the game on my PC. Not sure how anyone can help you with that (Bethesda included). Your problems could very well be generated on your end via some software you're running (what anti-virus are you using?)
---
2. Cap Collector was totally broken before. I could easily farm 25k with it by just server hopping for a few hours. It was stupid easy to get caps. I don't believe that was intended and I'm glad they'd fixed that.  Caps stashes change was a bit odd though. I liked randomly finding a stash while looting buildings, but now you know where they are as they're static.
---
You may hate the game for whatever reason. It won't change the fact that I'm still enjoying it (even if I play for a couple of hours per day). Good riddance. 
---
three times in 24 hours at one camp.
---
I suppose you‚Äôre right. Survival sounds interesting but if its focus is PVP, how the hell will you find people?
---
Right but it‚Äôs tedious. 
---
You may be the most deluded idiot in human history. 
---
I live in Appalachia, and it wouldn't be a weekend without hearing a still blow up in the mountains.
---
They didn‚Äôt hotfix when they broke auto grenade launchers and m79s by changing their weapon type to ‚Äúnull‚Äù. Took them two(three?) patches to fix it. They feel no urgency to fix stuff they break like this. Cynically, it‚Äôs cause not many people are affected by it.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to say they should. I was saying they shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone about the game before it‚Äôs ready to be sold. If they want to leave it crappy quality when you will rely on word of mouth rather than the usual hype is up to them. 
---
If anything that satisfy and cool it‚Äôs gonna be like when fornite and subnatica did winter things during that big winter storm up here in the states  and one question does it snow in Australia
---
Whoah whoah whoah there. Don't complain about the game using all your common sense about how the game should work. You might get caught in the next non-sense ban wave. 
---
bye felicia! on a semi-related not,  i had a private server for nearly 10 hours yesterday and it was fantastic.  all graphical issues disappeared on a server with just me and my homie.
---
Yeah he's glitched. I've snuck up and killed him a few times now. He doesn't move half the time and just let's you beat him to death without fighting. He's not supposed to be this easy I assume. On other hand he never drops anything of value so maybe just not a good cryptid. 
---
For 3, just pretend that's what the Weapon Artisan perk actually does. üòã
---
Someone played too much Fallout 4
---
The blue workbenches are the weapon workbenches in Fallout 76, the ones that look like OP's pic are the armor ones.
---
Unlike Fallout 4 where it's reversed
---
He attacked me the **instant** the 'You decline the team invite' notice popped up on my screen. Therefore, it stands to reason that that is why he attacked me; he didn't *have* to explain himself in voice chat.
---
Also, consider the fact that maybe he didn't see the point in explaining himself, given the fact that I hadn't responded to whatever else he had been saying.
---
Mind you, he did say *something* while we were fighting, but I couldn't make it out over the noise of me emptying my Laser Gatling into his skull.
---
kinda related, but there is a few second hand online markets now.  i sold 100 copper scrap to someone in need yesterday, i have 500 more taking up stash space if u are interested.
---
Nice find, the 8% and 15% could care less what level they come on lol.
---
I heard about 1500 for one. So I guess that's the price. I have one on xbone. GT: KolathDragon
---
but you can launch nukes by yourself
---
as long as you don't post tomorrow, "**Banned. I'm the large Easter Egg Roadmap guy.**" LOL too soon?   
---
SHUT-UP AND TAKE MY ORANGE ARROW!
---
As a real life outdoor gear head and someone who is constantly overencumbered, I am way too excited for backpacks. Fingers crossed for a good variety of looks.
---
its a misconception that survival mode is PVP focused, its the same game just without PVP restrictions so u dont have to worry about someone training a buch of mobs to ur camp or workshop and wrecking ur shit, and u not being able to shoot that person to make it stop.
---
I think the SBQ's loot list tried to get into the game but was given the "4:8:2000" error.
---
I'd like to display my power armor like in fo4
---
Well sure but that would involve finding something, going back to camp, decorating, then going back out to look. Now they did mention items in stash, so maybe once you put it in there it‚Äôs ok. But still need a lock button regardless to keep from dropping or scrapping good weapons/armor.
---
I love one for the team. I'd use that with my medic build. 
---
You read his post wrong, he's agreeing with you, but god damn are you a dumb man. Re-read what he posted!
---
I did every quest solo, including my first silo. I didn't realize you need friends to do silos but it's possible to launch a nuke by yourself (cause I did) but some quests get ridiculously hard later on. I think I finished the main quest line at like lvl 54 or something like that
---
Thank you for that. Wasn't me, but finding some dropped screws or something helped me immensely with replacing my construction power armor after losing all my frames back when I was 30. That carry weight boost was a lifesaver on my scavenging expeditions.
---
Got it. I don‚Äôt normally like PVP that much but have enjoyed a few encounters in this game. Admittedly, they started out of PVE boredom. I see someone has a workshop or is wanted and I seek ‚Äòem out to have a little fun. Have actually made some friends this way because after a few good PVP rounds, I engage mic and chat with them. Hooked a guy up with a couple serums just for playing along (a lot of folks just leave).  
---
I'm sure it will be implemented when the duping vulnerability is fixed once and for all. Until then it'd just be making things easier by removing the need for an anchor.
---
Soloed it all since I started playing in Beta. It's easily doable. Just makes sure your build is specced for combat. Certain mutations also help (Healing Factor is a great way to save on stimpaks)
---
Hell of a find!
---
Nah I just don‚Äôt want to be banned for ammo
---
Is it possible with a map of west Virginia to look up roughly where the lines going off the map would connect to? Would be fun if they went somewhere connected to cryptids or folklore. 
---
Why is post-launch bethesda content always better than the base game? Im so hyped
---
I'm going to go ahead and guess you didnt get banned for nothing like a lot of us. Get your $60,$80 or even $200 taken from you and then talk about "what Bethesda didnt have to do"
---
I'm also on the fence with whether to go sneaky-VATS or completely non-VATS tbh. It's making the decision difficult.
---
Good points about the AP and the Luck though.....hadn't considered luck!
---
What's the best way to find legendaries that aren't 1star trash? 
---
that is the literal definition of speculating.  just because he waited to attack you until after u declined the invite, doesnt mean he wouldnt have still attacked you if u had accepted that invite.  
---
The story of the people is *everywhere* in 76. You're getting it through recordings, journal entries and computer terminals instead of face-to-face. That's the only difference.
---
Wishing that private servers would of been addressed. 
---
I kinda like being in the fray hehe :)
---
Ain't that a kick in the head! 
---
These are all good finds but that assassins/sentinel arm.... hell yeah!
---
Boom! Nice one üëå
---
You say he attacked me because I owned a workshop.
---
I took over the workshop while he was nearby and *not once* did he try to stop me. He had several opportunities to kill me and take it over himself, but didn't. He could have done it immediately afterwards, but no; it was about ten minutes before he actually attacked me... after I declined his invite.
---
Now, are you going to keep going on about this, or are YOU done speculating?
---
Exactly. Plus I quite like that it's trapper. Nobody likes trapper but I'm down for the hobo aesthetic, it's the post apocalypse after all haha
---
A woman in my office has not one, but TWO pristine globes on her desk for no discernable reason. I stare at them every time I walk by.
---
I was thinking it looked like the alternate weapon bench style when you slide to the right from your crafting menu.  It is the far superior variant, just like the non-L-shaped chem bench.
---
The cost is low. I would agree, but it is the principle. The decontamination shower... whoa boy. It took a long time to get the violet flux to build it. I put it up... use it... and store it. Annoying as hell, but I don't want to have to fix it from some knucklehead who thinks it fun to destroy camps. I am like u/bobdeeez. I have a family and work. I play for fun and don't want to spend time fixing my C.A.M.P. I would rather spend time making it look cool.
---
Indeed. My first thought was "Where is that barbershop? I want that workbench for $135"
---
yes, ur experience in PVP is similar to mine.  theres nothing else for me to do anymore except make new different builds on other characters.  workshops and wanted players help me get by while im waiting for my friend to get online to run silo/nuke zones.  ive def made some friends through a fun fight over a workshop,  people in this sub think all PVP players are griefers who only want to gank up on casual non pvp players, but that just hasnt been my experience at all.
---
I know. I build camps to the land. there is nearly never one that places down again. it's a key feature of the game that is my end game content.
---
the bounty clearing between friends is circumventing consequences. there are supposed to be consequences to this, yes? that system is not working. the only person punished is the person building and having their camp destroyed for ...whatever reason a person enjoys harming others.  it took me months of casual play to finally get my decom shower built and then I had it destroyed three times in 24 hours. I couldn't afford to replace it. I saved again and moved camp to try and place it and bugged out and disappeared from my stored tab not once but twice (I moved camp asap again to test).
---
I understand pvp and engage in it in most games. if it's a map with objectives, for example, I get it. if it's a workshop in this game you steal from a person - fair - they signed up for that. it's mutually agreed upon. but coming across a camp in the wasteland and destroying it for...whatever reason is not pvp. there is no benefit for anyone in this game to do that.
---
and this aside...we as players make the game we want to see. I am a helpful person that has crafted armor sets for friends and strangers; I guarded a junkyard workshop to farm black titanium to help finish an excavator set for multiple friends (I think 6 in total in the end), built strangers and friends camps and hoped their gaming experience has been enhanced and happier. because I believe in having a non toxic world where we support each other and that includes in games. 
---
if people want to grief so be it but the fact that they can grief other players with no recourse is very poor game design. I love so much about this game but this makes me almost want to quit playing.
---
I did a hardass melee/shotgun build for my first char, which was fun too and op of course.  The sneaky vats route makes it like a different game. Worth trying, you can always switch it up if you find yourself not enjoying it. 
---
Your post gave me an idea. If you have a card at three stars for example but you only have two open slots you should be able to equip it. The card would then show the two stars and in parentheses show the number three to tell you that it is actually a three star card. You wouldn't have to deal with dropping ranks at all because it would be automatic. As soon as UD equipped the card it would go back to its three stars.
---
Oh really? How much positive change happened destiny 1 after it launched? That trash-fire was an empty world with nothing to do but the same quests and one good raid, only to have an awful DLC released for it. 
---
Yeah true, I think I have 50-ish respec points left, so switching up a second time shouldn't be an issue :)
---
he dropped some decent stuff for me, but I was only lvl 35 mind you
---
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm feeling right now. I haven‚Äôt played in some time and after the general fullness of Anthem, this looks like the time to come back in. 
---
All free ^_^
---
I meant inside the hotel, obviously. 
---
i never claimed to not be speculating because i wasn't there.  i'm going solely on the info you have provided.  however, you in no way have proven that his reasoning for attacking you was because you didn't accept his team invite.  
---
I run a bloodied build, 2 unyeilding armors the rest bolstering, get bloody mess, nerd rage, adreniline and adrenal reaction mutation and you put out some seirious damage with guns and there perks, adrenal reaction isnt working right now but i push 300 damage with a tse handmade and when the adreniline perk card kicks in at max (60%) that gives me about 590 damage, im a beast with low ass health lol
---
Agreed. It is a little mayhem-inducing at times (I guess griefing). But I think most players are good-natured folks who will actually help out and make it right after the fun. I totally demolished a worshop and its owner several times last weekend. Ultimately, though, I fixed everything (same guy I gave serums too) and made a new friend. I like to think I‚Äôm a good griefer. Lol
---
I have this feeling that there might be a sweet spot where a Lv. 50 player could actually launch a nuke... mainly because if enemy spawns are tied to level, you may not get those OP Colonel Gutsys to show up and only have to deal with Major Gutsy instead.
---
If the game decides to start swarming you with Colonel Gutsys, have fun.
---
Do we keep all of our stuff if we prestige ?
---
that's terrible for someone to do.
---
I was trapped in a workshop one day I fast traveled to, to help defend. somehow a fast travel mat applied to me even not on team and I had the log out option, or destroy objects to escape it or claim shop... i didn't want to contest, i just wanted to help defend. I claimed shop, finished defense and they hunted me down to my camp to destroy it.
---
Are you playing VATS-sniper style?
---
I'm looking at this idea of a front-liner with low health....not sure it can work, but I'm liking the idea of trying it :)
---
I think it would make it a little too easy to figure out what other players are doing.
---
I could see maybe some kind of radar thing that does incremental passes over the dots, but not a live update.
---
Nah, i stay out of vats, tho its super handy, i dont find a need for it on my build
---
agreed! teddy fears everywhere for me!
---
Seriously. Just add all of the songs from the other games.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs enough money available for licenses for more tunes.
---
Should be all free.
---
I'm cool with pvp, it's not my focus right now, but I'm game. 
---
The benefit is you will less lose caps when I inevitably see your high level and farm you. Something about being 1 shot at that level just keeps bringing yall back, muahahaha! 
---
I don't know why they didn't continue with pushing patches to pc a few days early to use us a test server. 
---
Sorry, where = which silo? Doesn't it depend on which one(s) haven't been used recently?
---
Alpha is fine, if there's no difference. I probably need to restock ammo and stims. For my level (79, I think) my character doesn't deal nearly enough damage. I'm still struggling with how to maximize specs and perks.
---
I have a theory-
---
Bethesda purposely held off release of npcs to let us settle in the world, and the npcs will just be
---
Characters that exited vault 76
---
This is the build I'm working on FWIW.  I might switch out some of the luck perks and put some of the str back into agility.  I keep rifleman on because I have a bloodied dragon too that hits around 1400 damange when I'm almost dead, and it hits like a ton of bricks shot out of a junk jet :D

Or a different radio station.  A nice jazz station would be nice.
---
Get the marine tac helm plan and bulk buy rubber and plastic from here. The helms sell for 30caps each with full barter and some unyielding charisma and cost 1 glass 1 plastic 3 rubber to make plus you get super duper 
---
you dont need friends to do silos, whoever told u that lied
---
I‚Äôve been debating making this post. I‚Äôm glad somebody did. However, I have the angle that I just love the music. It‚Äôs just so enjoyable and quirky and fun, a spectacular selection. If they add more music I hope it‚Äôs curated much the same way because I love every single one of those songs.
---
the Schorched Beast Queen cant be solo'd like many MMOs, the game cant really be finished, and certainly not solo.
---
L shaped chem bench is the real deal!
---
200k Ultracite Ammo is a lotta ammo to obtain in a month...
---
Mmm. Hoping that the stuff can be destroyed. Would love to blow up someone's collection and have em freak out cuz it "took em all day to find that stuff" yeah, well it's gone now. Raider life. 
---
unless you get banned
---
You must be new here...
---
Brotherhood scribe uniform has a backpack as well and has been my go-to outfit for that exact reason. 
---
Be the change you want to see. 
---
New content wouldn't take away the fact you would have to restart from level 1, if that's how they do it.  I'm just saying I hope it isn't.  Then there is problem of gear being level gated, I have to stash everything Ive been using until I level up again to use it?  no, just no.
---
Since you made the point, there can be some technical solutions to it. The ability to fast travel from inside a C.A.M.P. or Workshop, if it is not owned by you or someone on your team even with enemies, Un-lockable doors in a pacifist mode, self-healing structures were mentioned in another post (so shoot your way out and it will repair/fix itself), etc. 
---
This the same process that is used to fix bugs, and solve these issues currently. You are right though, people who want to find a way to be problematic will do so. However, we can as a community address those issues as they appear. Let's try to make the game enjoyable for those who want to just play with less grief. I think this idea is great in that it heads in that direction.
---
I do think that environmental factors should be able to destroy your C.A.M.P., e.g. your camp gets nuked, or ghouls ravage it. Yes, I know people can lure creatures to your camp, but you will get a warning, and you can get some XP.
---
Stolen, destroyed, and they cannot be repaired like normal camp items. Will make you think about how you defend your camp. 
---
+karma
---
Stacks display the lowest durability in the group. If you eat those first two, the final one will show full condition. It's by design to prevent tons of individual stacks or leaving lower condition items for last.
---
I don't remember where seneca rock is. It was in the top right corner if the map in some mountains 
---
Okay that makes more sense now. Thought perhaps the third would show up as a separate item in my inventory.
---
Grafton monster.  Had no idea....  
---
Today though I was working on some yua gui and I heard a growl as a massive deathclaw came at me.  I screeched alittle and started running, lucky the deathclaw Battled it out with the bear so I was able to get away.  Was a little terrifying though.  Haha
---
I would like one as well especially with gear 
---
Technically it fixes if you remove it and add it back
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Would you post a few more details of that build for me? I think what I want to play is very close to what you are describing.
---
Always confused me why they can't bring back the entire collection from previous games. It's gotta be about money right? 
---
Mothman: he can appear from f#$king nowhere and jump right into your face.
---
He's made me jump so many times, I can be walking minding my own business and  BAM the f#$ker is right next to me and the battle music plays
---
How I dealt with him, unfortunately most are vengeful and I have to put them down 
---
So are you saying that rather than punishing people for doing something against the rules just because it is possible is not necessary and they should focus on fixing the cause of that misbehaviour?
---
For example rather than punish criminals for breaking the law because it‚Äôs possible, coverment should fix the thing people are doing crime on or with?
---
Honestly I just play Spotify fallout playlists. Guaranteed no repeats and you get some old classics (looking at you Blue Moon)
---
these salty tears are so delicious 
---
Mothman. I yelled into my mic, clicked a lot and apologized to the nice couple my yelling scared over by the cranberry area 
---
I did the same for someone, it was .308 and in Flatwoods. At the time, my slab with crafting tables was by the Overseers Camp so I did the same thing. 
---
**BTW:** It is **free** to FT to them if you are on a team.
---
They may have created the situation via their coding choices or plain old buggy code. But we as players don't have to exploit them because the exploit exists. Just like most people won't steal from a shop because the owner is out back and the cameras don't work. They brought this on themselves and should be happy it's only a temp ban and not a full on one.
---
Last I checked, it's around $60000 per update on Xbox. If they can patch it server side, fine. If they need to fix the client...we gotta wait.
---
With Max strength and in PA you should be able to carry enough to not even need that perk. 
---
&gt; The revive system makes sense. If you get obliterated in the face with a double barrel shotgun, there will be little chance of being revived, however if you‚Äôre getting beaten up with a baseball bat, then a revive makes sense. 
---
No, it doesn't make sense. It's random. I've been killed by a grenade, and revived. Punched in the face, respawn. I've also 'died' to nothing many times and respawned. 
---
So a more intense PVE mode just like Survival is a more intense PVP mode
---
nice! I'm interested!
---
Core assembly + Dodgy is such a nice tank combo. Would maybe suggest getting a chest with the tesla mod. Nothing better for tagging.
---
Holy sentence structure and lack of punctuation batman, felt like i was having a stroke reading this.
---
Plus, Xbox and PS aren‚Äôt very keen on letting companies do hot fixes and such. Down time isn‚Äôt popular 
---
I have contested Poseidon Energy when I went through the whole process of starting it up with another person to only have someone claim it. Since then, I claim it and then start it up. I did it because I thought it was unfair especially since my team and I did the work and they locked the Fusion Core generator.
---
I usually just avoid the confrontation. If someone claimed it, I move on to another server, or one of the other two remaining plants. I don't lock the Workshops since I think it is important to share the resources, and most of the time I am not there.
---
Please don't span our nice sub with your troll account.
---
I haven't had any success with her for a while now. I miss the good old days where she was a challenge but realistically a possibility. Now you seem to need the expert perk builders with the exact correct layout. It's cut my playing time dramatically since I've done everything else many times over. Hopeful dlc if good
---
Except it can be solo'd...its rather hard to do it because other people see the nuke zone and wander in, but it can be solo'd.
---
They definitely exist in game. 
---
Sick post. My camp is behind Hopewell cave.

IIRC, the effect applies to the *projectile* damage. The Fat Man and Missile Launcher do a tiny amount of damage on impact, and *then* deal explosion damage. If it works like FO4 that means the explosion damage is unaffected because of it being a special effect, not the actual impact itself.

For aluminum I reccomend the YouTube videos about ‚Äútop of the world‚Äù.  Farming the ski poles can be highly rewarding for aluminum.  
---
Copper is scrapped from telephones...  I advise loading into whitespring and heading inside.  Pickup all the phones, tons of copper.

Hope this helps

The mods do, but the plans to make the mods yourself don't seem to, which is what OP is talking about. At least as far as I've seen. I check the vendors daily to see if it's a random spawn but while I've seen plenty of PA headlamp mods I've never seen a plan.
---
The blue ones were weapon in 4. Source: 900 hrs in the game.
---
Yay! I can build my new pit of skulls!
---
Events and daily quest in The Mire, which will give you a chance at Leather Coat and Tattered Field Jacket as well. Happy hunting!
---
Yao Gaui, I ran into three of them at middle mountain cabins, one 3 star legendary and 2 scorched all over lvl 60 fighting a scorchbeast and I was around lvl 35....I didn‚Äôt last long 
---
Seeing the same thing, have done 3 queens after the patch, every time it takes 5-10 min's before the rewards and loot get's into you inventory.
---
And the only thing i can loot is the queen, all other ledgendaries or other enemies in the nuke zone just gives me the wheel :/
---
we should, but who knows
---
Would love that a lot more than 5 more copies of traveling pharmacy when I already have a 1, 2 and 3 star version of it
---
Well, that and all of the stories are much more linear; there is never more than one way to end a "conversation" with a holotape or complete a quest for one.
---
I mean it would've been within most publisher's policy to perma ban exploiters I don't know what to tell you other than don't duplicate items in an online game. It's kind of a no-brainer that the publisher holds the responsibility and right to keep the game and economy stable to preserve the integrity to legitimate grinders. Your $60, $80, or $200 was taken from you for less than 3 weeks and then a percentage of you will undoubtedly do it again and get perma banned next time then flock to reddit for sympathy. 
---
You‚Äôll be taking pictures in game, from a character perspective, rather than from an external view. It adds immersion to photo mode. 
---
No I think it's only bonus damage. Which means if you put a prime reciever on it it should do even more damage to scorched
---
There is no specific level to complete the game.  Killing the scorchbeast queen is nearly impossible by yourself, but this is an online game so people will naturally join in anyway.  But you can most certainly take part in killing the sb queen solo and "finish" the quest.  There is no real "end" to the game anyway.  It just not built that way.
---
I. AM. SWORN. TO. CARRY. YOUR. BUR-DENS.
---
[Were they?](https://www.gamersdecide.com/sites/default/files/authors/u39031/(41).jpg)
---
Totally possible to solo everything. I did almost everything solo including my first silo. My buddy joined after I launched the nuke and the two of us killed the queen in around 15 mins, so it's definitely possible solo if you have a good build
---
Interesting post friend. Have you seen the terminal entries at VTU regarding Horse Creek? 
---
I was told that if you do that it breaks again upon relogging
---
I would save main quest like mayor for a day untill lvl 50. There are others as well but waiting untill lvl 50 will give you max lvl rewards.  üëçüèΩüòé
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
Headlamp mods are cheap and plentiful anyway.  Not seeing a problem here.
---
Why would they want to add private servers? What's the benefit of that? Extra work for no return?
---
I was told that like I said above if you remove it then re apply it breaks again when you relog
---
Oh well last night I did the fix and it worked I will have to check today if I still get the bonus...
---
I'm pretty sure I read that the data miners discovered the level cap is 50,000
---
Since you brought up human qualities such as knowing right from wrong, is curiosity a bad thing? If you were working a job and found a way to do it a thousand times faster and with less effort, would you do it, share it with your fellow workers?
---
Also Bethesda should fix these things as soon as possible, since they wanted to hop on the MMO wagon. How many months has it been?
---
Ohhh excavator. How you badly need a paint job
---
Iirc there's an old bug where you'll only get a certain amount of songs per play session possibly. So you can go one session without hearing ol' man mose, then next session he kicks the bucket 50 times :v)
---
So can people acquiring cheat weapons and armor and other mods before major nerfs took place to level up very quickly.  Not saying this is the case for everyone but it‚Äôs amazing how quick and easy it can be when you never had to worry about getting killed.  
---
OR it adds second projectile that deals extra 100% explosion damage making TS explosives far superior to any other ranged TS weapons. 
---
TBH I just tried launching solo nuke at level 35 and the only reason I lost was assaultrons. I was like one or two steps away from finishing but I ran out of meds and couldn't clear the final assaultrons :(
---
Nope, still cant play the game because im "temp" banned. Im not going to say I did nothing wrong as i did pick up a bag with an absolute shit load of junk in it. But I never performed any exploit. I can absolutely understand with the whole of the internet being a toxic shit hole that you dont care about that nor believe me.  The thing thats a real kick in the nuts was that i saved a video of me fining it for this kind of occasion but of course i got comfortable and deleted it(another thing you wont believe)
---
Sounds like a generic excuse. Did you directly benefit from duping? If so, then take your lumps
---
I set my permanent base outside the white springs. Then I go claim one or two workshops depending on where I want to explore or what resources I need.
---
There's a link in the main page to join Discord for Filthy Casuals.   Best way to meet up with people currently online.  :)
---
[Scroll aaaaaaaaaall the way down to the gallery.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons_workbench_(Fallout_4)) 
---
They deserve criticism, but people love Hastings and destroying things in mobs. The click bait article headlines and YouTube videos are sad.
---
Exactly! In the previous Fallout games you read about people who lived pre-War via terminal and got a lot of lore out of those. NPCs were there just to send you on errands and "keep you busy". Not many added to the actual story.
---
I have no problem on my melee weapons but I do have issues where hitting a enemy may not do any damage for 3 or 4 hits then all of a sudden get a hit on them. Not sure if its my game or other having this issue with weapons in general. 
---
Did they specify when this turd becomes Free-to-Play, yet?
---
Yeah it dropped way off after the nerfs to two shot explosives. Things seemed to shift to fissure prime being nuked for a bit and now just an occasional nuke on Whitespirings. As far as my experience on Xbox. 
---
Haha good luck let us know what the result is.
---
nope for me it was all good, I think people are getting confused because the positive affects disappear from the pipboy after you relog but its still working based on my weapon dmg. Hopefully it stays that way. 
---
They had flags in fallout 4 for each faction. Also the raiders in 76 have a ton of subfactions each would be great to have a flag for.
---
I can see that stance and in the end yeah i did. Found a bag with around 750k junk in it on the whitesprings golf course then split it 3 ways with my buddies. But the fact that i was "temp" banned for "duplicating items" is still factually false. 
---
Hey brought you back to one upvote cos it's a good suggestion. Personally, I'm PC but use an XBOX USB controller since aiming doesn't matter as much in FO games.
---
Having said that, I wish I could remap my D-pad so I stop wasting so many Stimpaks!
---
ok so you now being the second person that's devolved to name-calling and cursing for me sharing a difference in opinion than you makes me the toxic shit hole. Cool. Now when you're ready to be an adult you can swallow your pride and admit to yourself that being banned for 3 weeks is getting off easy and does not equal someone "stealing your money" when they're letting you back on, you could spend some time outside in the real world and get over it. 
---
ok thanks I guess Ill give that a go
---
Mothman isn't the only one that's glitchy. I took down a Legendary Behemoth at ~ level 17 because after throwing a couple of rocks at me, he just stood there seemingly stuck under a tree. It took me something like 1000 rounds to do it, but he just stood there while I plinked away.
---
Last Laugh + Orbital Strike Grenades
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure that helps a lot too. I just be happy to hit level 100 for the achievement. I‚Äôve never had a lot of luck at nuked whitesprings and usually play solo. I‚Äôm probably not min/maxing my character very well either. Workshops are where I find my grind to be at. 
---
or God forbid play another game for 3 weeks, oh no!
---
Make sure you have the Class Freak perk card as well to offset the negative aspect of all mutations.  It maxes out on three levels which is negative 75%.
---
The additional projectile does not reflect on the Dmg stat. If you fatman does 680 dmg then the two will still do 1360 if the target is hit by both.
---
Great, thank you!
---
I think you can move your dead loot pile by putting something else on the ground. It will move the loot pile to where you just dropped something. Might be wrong though but would help find or make it easier to get to.
---
Because they said they would it would allow mod support and we would rent servers allowing another source of revenue. It will probably be a year 2 thing
---
No no no, you misunderstand. I was saying that the internet is a toxic shit hole and with that in mind I understand your reasoning for not believing my story. Also not sure why it is you think i dont go outside. I'm not 900 hours guy, i have a job. This game was my way of winding down after a day of work. 
---
It works. Although visually it won't show the positive effects in your status screen. Also suffering from starvation will enhance it now as well.
---
Scrap it.  They aren't that hard to find.
---
For a ranged build the bolster my be more helpful then the unyielding.  Unyielding is God mode for melee builds with STR boosting the dmg, nothing in the special makes guns do more dmg. 
---
Er I mean sell it.
---
You can try to carefully place your power armor down in the fissure, then jump on top of it to get closer to your bag.
---
not a problem, enjoy! &lt;3
---
alright time to starve myself
---
yeah, at lvl 80 got a card pack, guess what, 4 of them were repeats I can't even rank up, fml
---
in the meanwhile I got like 10 levels to respec &gt;:/
---
Oh. Ok. Thanks everyone. I wasn't sure what was up. I appreciate the explanations. 
---
Anybody notice the table in Fort Defiance with the toy alien and chalk on it? It has a chalk drawing of what looks like an abduction scene...
---
Just focus on doing events that are happening near you. You will pay less to travel there (based on distance) and you are more likely to do the event of your appropriate level (same zone).
---
I am glad someone else brought it up. I thought it just might be my game. The ghouls at the WS were taking forever to display anything. I spent 5 minutes or more walking around to the meat piles to check them. I noticed other people doing the same thing so it must be happening to everyone.
---
*"L'enfer, c'est les autres."*
---
K that's good to know
---
Not a problem! I spent months handpicking each song, so I hope you like it!
---
Yeah, I think if they were to do it it won't be in 2019. Well spotted
---
Well I recorded it. It both gave me a fright and then the biggest laugh of my Fallout 76 experience.
---
https://youtu.be/X-km8WTobSU
---
I think they said it would be a year or so before we got them.
---
It's like getting busted for drugs possession when you pick up a small bag of white stuff. Doesn't mean they should've punished you, but I can see why they thought it was required at the time.
---
No
---
I've always been disappointed by how enemies just become petrified solid when they die but I could understand why since game is online and all. I noticed it immediately since I dragged stuff around often in the other games.
---
(At least there's the amusement of those extra smacks you can give enemies for a few seconds after they die as long as they don't complete their falling over animation allowing bloody mess multiple proc chances when they're already dead.)
---
private solo servers - when?
---
Does anyone have any updates on suspensions? I've checked some forums &amp; sites. Googled plenty and not not found anything.
---
Real Fallout is what Real Scotsmen play. 
---
I feel your pain. I watched a gulper eat my turret without firing once. Now the turret is missing with just a wire leading to nowhere. I think I will need to pay to move my camp inches to get them back. Another gun turret is missing when a super mutant overlord smashed it. The C.A.M.P. says everything is repaired and the budget is taking the hit without any turret.
---
Surprised no one has mentioned Civil War clothing from the Philippi Battlefield Cemetery and Spacesuits from the Crashed Spacestaion.  They go for considerably more and are easy to get.  18 to 65 caps each. 
---
LOL, good metaphor. 
---
As far as i know the Dlcs will be free. Hopefully they're making a profit with the Atom shop and the Creation club so they won't have to charge.
---
No that would go against what they promised about the Atomic Shop.
---
Also the game doesn‚Äôt need thousands of mule characters because people are always trying to get around the stash limit
---
This kind of thing makes it seem like this is Bethesda's first Fallout game... it's crazy that there are so many basic requests like this.
---
It rolls over so often. I do find it funny when "Country Roads" comes on. I hear my kids and wife start singing it through my house. It is an ear worm.
---
That‚Äôs a long way off. They need to do a lot of stuff before it gets to that.
---
I wish people would stop complaining about something that won‚Äôt happen for awhile.
---
Been playing it since launch üòÄ
---
Just drop stuff until you‚Äôre not over weight and see if that fixes it
---
That's what I thought also, but some good points by another poster in terms of extra Agility for AP (VATS builds or Dodgy builds, also helps Evasive (up to 20)), and Luck for crits.
---
I am now thinking a balance, tbh. Maybe 2 pieces of Unyielding to top out Agi and Luck (and a little more Str for Barbarian DR), and the rest Bolstering.
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with having healthy skepticism. What we were delivered for the base game was not what someone would have expected when the game was announced, and the same people who created that are creating this. It's not a stretch to see these updates being bungled and warped just as much as the original game was. I'm not trying to rain on someone's parade, but you're more likely to like and enjoy what you get if you are more realistic with your expectations.
---
I liked about half of what I saw in the roadmap, and I"ll take a "we'll see" approach with minimal expectations. I don't want Bethesda to fail with these, but I also don't want to build myself up to expect something they'll never deliver.
---
Did they add anyrhing new? Havent played since the buldozer update.
---
I wish I would have thought of that before I fell into the pit the second time. It might have worked, but the loot is already long gone. 
---
YOU TAKE THAT BACK, HE‚ÄôS A GOOD BOY
---
I hate this line of thinking you describe. It gives pve'rs a toxic, unjustified self righteousness. 
---
Do you know how many times ive killed a player on a workbench and they scream over area mic? Nasty curse words. Mean personal attacks. Why you gotta make me feel bad for playing the game ?
---
Some people like to pvp. Its not much deeper than that. Nothing personal about it. You guys are nuts. Just because you get emotionally charged over a game doesnt meaan others do...
---
Then yall circle jerk like pvpers are "unbalanced sad people", when in reality its tou guys getting alll emotional about a silly game
---
Jeez 
---
Store your scrap and head east past the savage divide and start leveling up!  I used to head to Watoga and kill robots for steel or fight Super Mutants at West Tek.  Then there always The Whitespings area.  You don't have to wait for a nuke.  Just kill gouls all day long and farm legendaries.
---
Add me, my GT is The Occurence
---
Yeah I guess that depends on the weapon, as a snipe I would not use vats. As a SMG or pistol user let's rock and roll with the crits
---
I remember there being some in the upper floors of fort defiance. I think the place where the gormands had a hideout (can't remember what it was called) also had some.
---
The loot is already long gone, and Bethesda can't restore lost junk. But if something like this happens again, I'll be sure to try that.
---
So you are here since the beginning..have you seen improvement??
---
Hard yes. Rank 3 equals 1000 round FC.
---
The valid votes are going to be related to the presidents room thing in the enclave bunker. There‚Äôs a machine in there that exchanges presidentlal seals for president themed stuff.
---
The statue also disappears when you touch it and then comes back together as a bunch of moths. It's pretty epic. I ended up building a church solely for the purpose of housing the statue. Unfortunately I had did have to get rid of a bunch of other stuff just to keep my limit
---
Mountain goat should just be combined with the existing goat legs perk.
---
And... while I upvoted, dare I ask why this should be none of your business?
---
Moar Songz!
---
I always felt it would be a good quest opportunity with Rose's Raider Radio.  She gets word of a lost stash of music data, you go find it, and then bam! New songs on her station.  
---
I was in the Palace of the Winding Path yesterday and found a pool table on one of the lower levels with a full set! Good for plastic farming too :)
---
The Whitesprings Golf Club maybe? Don‚Äôt know about a full set but it has most and there
---
Yep now I remember. To Fort Defiance!  Thanks.
---
Nukes ruin the world
---
Yeah I see your point but they only had mentioned it briefly, way before the road map was released and I am just surprised there was no mention of it. I understand it may take a lot from them to implement the private servers but to not see it in the road map seemed odd.
---
I made a build that does pretty good damage with anything.  My deathclaw gauntlet can do about 1080 damage per swing not in sneak. my shotgun can do about 1200 in sneak as well as my long ranged weapons. I'm happy with it. It's mostly a bloodied unyielding build though
---
It's stumbled here or there, but it's getting better all the time, and it has always been playable :)
---
They released a roadmap for 2019 of all the content they‚Äôre going to add over the course of this year including new quests, vault raids, new modes like survival, etc
---
There's a big fucking wide field between "nah, it doesn't matter" and "putting out a hotfix right now". It's not like it's deleting characters or bricking machines; it can easily wait until the next scheduled patch. 
---
I mean, the main quest *is* using holotapes to complete quests. Not to mention conversations with robot NPCs along the way.
---
Does anyone else think the Pioneer backpack will be their way to give us loadouts etc? It makes sense to add in a feature like that with quests/lore. Fingers crossed!
---
I had never thought of that. Cool tip. just like u/andre_g_marek I have a set of Reactive Plates and a Jet Pack for T-60 and X-01. It would be nice to switch them on the fly depending on which suit I am wearing.
---
Upstairs at whitesprings golf club
---
&gt;Yes, but wouldn't look more hysterical with a proper mini-nuke in your hands?
---
They‚Äôre connected to newspaper clippings and a picture of (what appears to be) mothman off to the side. If you look at the image in the official roadmap, the resolution is clear enough to make out some of them
---
Good call. I‚Äôll check it out along with the missile camps.
---
I haven't managed to find a way to put reasonable points into both melee and ranged...would be interested to know what your key perks are :)
---
I‚Äôd assume that if there‚Äôs no mention of it, then it‚Äôs not part of this years roadmap. 
---
They shouldn‚Äôt talk to much about things that are more than a year or more away. It could be even two years.
---
People want a working game and all sorts of new content. But then they want all this kind of stuff too.
---
It‚Äôs so demanding sometimes. 
---
Okay makes sense why its not in the 2019 Road map then.
---
&gt;  If you were working a job and found a way to do it a thousand times faster and with less effort, would you do it, share it with your fellow workers?
---
If I knew the new method violated the terms of my employment and would probably get me fired? Nah, I'd keep my trap shut. And I damn sure wouldn't keep doing it to the point someone noticed and I DID get fired. And if I did get caught and fired, I would accept the fact that I brought it upon myself. 
---
&gt; Also Bethesda should fix these things as soon as possible, 
---
I don't disagree. They should be fixed. But, as I said before, the existence of a glitch does not equal free license to exploit said glitch. 
---
If anything, Bethesda is being too lenient with this situation. Any other company, and it would have resulted in a permanent ban with no chance for appeal. Bethesda has said they will reinstate the banned accounts once the exploits are fixed. 
---
Only you can answer that for yourself 
---
This is from farther down, explains how Beth screwed up this quest: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJcVchPuuuQ&amp;app=desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJcVchPuuuQ&amp;app=desktop)
---
That‚Äôs cool I‚Äôve already got rank 3
---
Not sure what you're on about here. You seem to be a person not pleased with anything. I admitted what it is I think i got flagged for, I stated in the nicest way possible there's no way for me to prove my innocence to you, I clarified why it is I know you didnt and very well shouldn't believe me. So your response is to say Im entitled, children are starving around me and go play a different game? What's up with that? I think you need some help my person. Do you want to PM me and talk about your troubles? Ill for real help you out if i can.
---
Shh, we don‚Äôt talk about that night...
---
There‚Äôs also a spotify playlist someone made and posted the other day.
---
For xbox users they can put it on in the background.
---
It can, and it's not terribly difficult unless a lot of players join in and make her OP tough.
---
The method is basically a Str bloodied build, with a TSE shotgun. You VATS the wings with your TSE (or BE, or AAE) to ground her, whip out a bloodied SS or Grog and beat the living bejeezus out of her.
---
You mean to tell me that people are struggling to do nuke silos without super OP weapons?
---
If you have saved any points you need to spend them. For example if you spend points to level 45 and save 6 points, (making you level 51) the game will still only show you perks available up to level 46. You cant save level ups in that regard. 
---
If that's not the case you are looking in the wrong place, or you own a perk already.
---
Best comment in the thread.  
---
Bye, i‚Äôve been playing since first beta session and the game has 110% improved since then and continuously does so, it still has bugs, and lots of them but they‚Äôre majorly reducing both the quantity, and severity of them.
---
I hope someone from Bethesda see‚Äôs this and acknowledges that some fans are really grateful for the turn around, this game has potential to be one of the most enjoyable ones out there an with work it can be done. And i‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre sticking to their guns, because they would have lost ALOT more respect by abandoning the game.
---
That said, all those issues are pathetically small. If yoir enjoyment on this game is summed up by your total cap limit then i gotta tell you, you‚Äôre in for a cruel awakening in the real world.
---
JOHNNY CASH IMMEDIATELY
---
Interesting... In the suggested playlists below they recommended Country Cookout with Guy Fieri üòÇ
---
I would legit buy that!
---
Weird thing is that everyone bashes the game and bethesda even to this day..everyone except here. Here i read about people enjoying the game..it's like it's another universe in here...
---
Awesome, will do! Thanks for offering :)
---
You have just discovered that instead of adding content they made a jpg that says they might months or years from now to try to get people to shut up. 
---
When you let trump build a CAMP right outside watoga to keep those darn low levels out
---
33% water Regen each 
---
I just want to be able to favorite a PA chassis so I can quick-enter, rather than fumble through the pipboy.
---
I swear, I have to have the radio off now, because if I listen to it, even a little, I keep hearing the damned thing in my head for almost a full day after.
---
I get such odd looks when I hit Butcher Pete &amp; don‚Äôt realize I am mumbling it out loud. 
---
Honestly I hope I find people like you so I can get some fat cap stacks.  Please witch hunt the bases thank you.
---
It's my theory that the ultimate "end" of the game (and where we ultimately end up finding the Overseer) is the reopened Vault 76
---
I'd love for there to be one free turret, just something I can stick over my veggie farm
---
Are these items going to be "locked?"  As in will other players be able to come and pick these items up?  That's my only concern about it at this point.  I will find bears and sloths of all kinds and put them in various compromising positions through my CAMP and have some tucked away here and there that people will have to really look around and find.  But I don't want anyone to just come in and take the stuff I have out on display.
---
Right after I get my items and flux, after a nuke fight, I always server hop. 
---
It seems to impact everything, not just the the nuked area. 
---
Reminds me of when dupers were running around with the weight glitch. 
---
Everything comes to a crawl. 
---
Yes, plus it could allow for some of the more subversive songs of that era to added as well. 
---
TSE handmade by any chance?
---
I kind of like that really.
---
Aside from being attacked by mobs etc, it‚Äôs kinda peaceful wandering around without random NPCs rattling off repetitive phrases.
---
Take my updoot, you savage. 
---
I hadn‚Äôt really considered that. I was thinking it just seemed less worthwhile to farm for eBay fodder after the changes. 
---
Max strength, max agilty, sneak lvl3, convert operative lvl 3, bloody mess lvl 3, shotgunner lvl 3 on all, rifleman 1 out each, radical, demolition expert lvl 5, unyielding armor with+ 1 strength on reach piece, twisted muscles, talons, adrenal reaction. Those are the main big damage boosters I can think of. Then the lower your health is the more damage you do. But it doesn't have to be really low. It could be just 1/4.
---
I have gotten plans for the T60 torso and the T45 left leg from treasure maps so I'm guessing that those are the only ways you can get armor plans 
---
I see a lot of people since the announcement imagining dynamically placed items. But wouldn't this cause performance and stability strain. Am I the only one thinking it will be static placement. Position X, Y, Z, Angle X, Y, Z all locked and no physics interaction.
---
Omg if we come across some sort of Elder God I'll lose my mind. 
---
Y‚Äôall should stop making up stuff, you‚Äôll end up disappointed.
---
If you want the loot from the rest of the piles you'll have to play the waiting game. It speeds up if you loot EVERYTHING from the piles as they populate.  Then they disappear and the server doesn't have to account for it and can move on to generating other piles. Then just sort and scrap the bits you dont want. Its gonna take a while though. 
---
Bethesda game *
---
Sorry, but that‚Äôs not a valuable item.
---
What do you mean by general fullness of Anthem?  Thought about getting it today
---
More/new guns
---
human NPCs
---
and I need reading glasses. Yes, you did. XD
---
Yeah, almost like these are the guys actually playing the game and not people forming their opinions based on a clickbait YT video
---
Plus, if it had a back to it (and a soldering iron), it could pass for a tinkerer‚Äôs bench &amp; you could bulk said scrap. 
---
I don't think you've seen how buggy new vegas is..
---
Honestly, probably my first Scorchbeast, as I approached Whitesprings around level 20. Totally destroyed me.
---
You can only have 5 characters on one account - lets not make it worse than it is ;)
---
How does it go against promises, and why does it matter?
---
Sorry! I meant dullness. It‚Äôs a fun game but the world is devoid of anything interesting. 
---
Where have you been finding these valid votes?
---
yes.are they only gained through exploits?
---
People are downvoting you but it's true, we're like fucking lemmings
---
You have to lvl up first. Like when you lvl to 60 you‚Äôll be able to pick 10 other cards or swap 10 perkpoints.  Or a mix like 5 cards and change 5 points. U won‚Äôt get new perkpoints. 56 is max. 
---
No need to be like this, mate. It was a simple question.

Me too! I love backpacks too much 
---
^^
---
This. This is my point.  I don't want to have to fast travel and HOPE the Watoga vendor has a headlamp mod in the correct color in stock. I want to learn a stupid plan so I can install the correct one anytime I want to
---
Guy Fieri must have good taste. Or, should I say...
---
...FLAVOR???
---
I believe it‚Äôs part of the ultra cite armor quest chain. You have to take it bake to Fort Defiance and log into her terminal 
---
So this will be like a Call of Duty Prestige mode where you drop down to level 1 and work your way back up?
---
Damn seriously?  Were you a Destiny fan at all? 
---
its used for part of the BoS questions and gives you access to Taggerdy's living quarters in the BoS base.  it will also let you get the ultricite PA plans and there is an artillery plan spawn there as well
---
:Lydia bot activated:
---
Yup, there was a bit of an exodus to the filthycasuals sub
---
my main problem, is input lag, to at worst. rubber banding.
---
while FO4 felt solid. shoot and hit.   in FO76 i feel less like i aiming for the enemy, but aiming for where they'll be 2 secounds from now, firing from an angle i'll be in 2 secounds from now.
---
i've tried to fix it, ethernet, etc.  but it persists.  its almost as if my character is heavy. and it hurts the experience.
---
Destiny 1 launched essentially ruined gaming for me till six months later when dying light came out. Taken king was absolutely amazing and then.. Destiny 2 happened. Haven‚Äôt played forsaken though. So destiny and I have a sorted history. Just not willing to invest in it again. 
---
Do any of you even Fallout? lol You're *all* right. There are 2 variations of the weapon workbench in both fallout 4 and 76...and they are the same in both games. You can build either one in either game. There's big blue one and there's the more makeshift looking one. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons\_workbench\_(Fallout\_4)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons_workbench_(Fallout_4)) The pic OP posted made me think of the armor workbench instantly. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor\_workbench\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_workbench_(Fallout_76)) However, if you know anything about ShopSmith (the thing being sold in OP's pic), it's more akin to a C.A.M.P. in real life. It's a pretty cool tool platform that has an all-in-one kind of setup to let you have all the tools of a big wood shop in a fairly compact package. If you look closely at the C.A.M.P., you can see a drill press, table saw, and other power tools built in. Very similar to the goal of the ShopSmith.
---
Yes, but you'll become legendary character with some powerful abilities
---
no. you didnt say anything about wanting one
---
Funnily enough my camp has been in that area since the game's launch, I've been staking out that vault for months!
---
Awe okay thank you. I‚Äôve already done all of that lol but really appreciate the help 
---
First off thank you for what you do. And it's absolutely not selfish. It's a huge part of what I was talking about - we feel good when we help others because it's a critical part of our evolutionary natures. It's a huge part of how we survive and succeed. To be helpful is to be human.
---
Thank you. I appreciate the help :) 
---
I vaguely remember the quest. I think it was in savage divide in some lab
---
I'd say they're cheap but not plentiful. About half the vendors seem to have one at any given time but the chances of it being the one you want are pretty low.
---
You are in the exact same boat as I am, turns out it is broken and you will never complete the overseer mission and the wendigo quest will re-appear a lot too... another issue I found was events and daily quests were not completing properly in the pip boy.
---
Haha dude, I was 3 bugs deep a few minutes after midnight release of that game.  I corrected with "Bethesda game" because the Fallout IP isn't their only IP that is bug infested.  
---
Also, Obsidian developed NV if I am not mistaken.
---
I was walking by an auto supply shop and saw all the oil and coolant bottles and was ready to collect some plastic.
---
Make it? No.
---
But I've got a collection of Islay's that I'd be willing to share. 
---
They can be semi-auto or have a shotgun receiver? equipped too!
---
So by your logic its acceptable to break a mutation that was working and just not fix it for weeks? Like ive said more than once its not acceptable to break something new every patch and i will announce it until measures are taken to prevent it.
---
I disagree with this given I use 0% of my budget on defenses.
---
If I were forced to have two separate budgets, this would essentially mean I lose budget overall.
---
Dude mine was in Flatwoods too! He was doing an event and the mission where you start the responders. It felt good to do especially since I met him right after getting griefed at my workshop for caps by some dude who dodged the dupe ban.
---
Happy hunting! :o)
---
They were notorious for being duped and sold. Over 99.9% of all TSE handmades and shotguns found in game in various characters were duped
---
Yeah, the world and lore of Destiny turned me into a fanboi quick. And I kept playing up until just before the last Destiny 2 dlc.  Dying Light was a lot of fun too!
---
Sucks about Anthem.. 
---
They fall under rifle for the sake of perks
---
Thanks.
---
No it's totally doable solo. Done it twice.
---
That said, there are a few periods when you are leveling that are tough. You are in one now ... you have maybe half your ideal perk cards, lower level gear ... but will face higher enemies esp as you find yourself in zones where some higher level has bumped the spawns.
---
It gets a better in stages. 25-40 though is a lot of repair, ammo expenditures, weight management, etc. After 50 you start adding in either more quality if life perks if you havent already or additional damage perks if you skipped those. Once you get even a single star decent legendary that matches your layout things get better again ... your ammo use drops etc. Once you get a bit higher and learned the plans you need for most of your stuff your need to scrap really drops off. You add in ammosmith, chemist, super duper, power Smith, white knight, etc and you can start trimming down your inventory.
---
It's true, sometimes society could be incredibly cruel, terrified by the unpredictable nature of the world, needing to do something, etc. But instances of forced human sacrifice for the good of the group, though they're popularly known, have been extremely rare in human history. Far, far more common have been instances of  self-sacrifice for the good of the group.
---
Exactly. There's no choices to make and no consequences since you make no choices. That's a first for a Fallout game, and not a trend I want them to continue.
---
I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the actual open-worlds,  but the lore is interesting. What got you to stop playing? 
---
I got bored halfway through the first post and havent been paying attention since. All i noticed were the personal attacks. And i find those funny. thanks for joining in!
---
I went into a silo at level 49.
---
Mr Handys were level 7
---
Gutsys were 22
---
Robobrains were 30
---
Turrets 16
---
Not so hard
---
Like I said, no clue how much of what he had.  Just pointing out that they set the threshold (as someone mentioned at 100k for rare items) at a completely attainable amount.  That was all I was pointing out.  
---
I would love to get back into the game, but alas, all my friends stopped played (or were banned and don't want to admit it) after their uber TSE weapons were nerfed and the dupes were removed.  
---
Most had already aquired all the best in slot gear for their builds via dupe handouts and ruined the game for themselves.  God I really want a private server that forces everyone to restart.  Want to have a town in a static state with some good friends lol.  Someday I suppose.
---
I think I found an entire set in the simulation vault at vault tec university.
---
No worries. Wouldn't telling him that awhile ago have saved you, me, and him some grief? :)
---
no, i need to PAY attention. I havent been doing that since you decided to attack me personally like i insulted your mother or something. 
---
you need to work on your rage a little. 
---
make that 99.99%
---
That could be why it is in the hover chair instead of running around like all the other aliens we've seen in universe.
---
nah, this is reddit, it's built for drama!
---
Have you found/ repaired the damaged assaultron in the bunker??
---
That will give you some info regarding the fate of the enclave bunker residents.
---
It's been playable since beta.
---
Was in the middle of typing a reply until I realized "hotwheel" isn't a new car they added to the game. It's the favorites wheel.
---
Same although I have a, probably wrong, theory that plans are in certain areas.  Found t60 torso plan in cranberry bog and t45 left leg in ash heap.
---
These are all good, but I'd be happy if I could have the FO 4 strongback perk that lets you fast travel while over encumbered. Would make life so much better for a chronic hoarder.
---
I also wish we had a way to just 'pack up' our camp and take it with us. Like, if I know I want to move, I can pack it up while at home and then place it down when I get somewhere I'd like without having to pay a moving fee.
---
All good, but I think people are straying from this method now because they track large amounts of stacked items and something like thousands of Nuka colas looks pretty obvious
---
Lol yeah. . . Tho Power Armor itself is kinda like fallouts hot wheels. 
---
Bolton Greens has a full set. 
---
This doesn't work for the record. Without retrieving your original dropped bag you will generate a new one instead. Best bet is to not fall into the fissures!
---
Yeah I've had 3 of them since probably December.   Please fix Bethesda!  Maybe make sure we get something nice for being patient?  Lol
---
The country club right above top of the world, Bolton greens?, has a full set I believe 
---
This guy got it. I have my wheel set up so up is jetpack down is stealth boy mod, left is kinetic Dynamo and right is Tesla.
---
I didn't attack you.  I gave you truth.  I was even kind enough to suggest that you were just raged filled and not an idiot, but you chose to refute that.  So you literally chose to behave like a fucking moron.
---
Thus, you are a fucking moron.  If the mean words hurt your little fee fee's, then maybe do a little due diligence and use the reading comprehension that we teach in fifth grade.
---
You fucking moron.
---
I dunno man, I just wanted to engage with the community.. Not to annoy.
---
Maybe there was a big one worth mentioning.. maybe someone would say 'they've opened another vault' 
---
Hmm, nuclear wasteland...desolate and lonely...yeah, just doesn't add up.
---
i really really wish that someday we can craft "talking syringe ammo", i wonder what would scorched beast queen has been saying... ( probably something like "f..k you, f..k you, f..k you, f..k you too, specifically f..k you!") :D 
---
Disappointing. Thank you
---
I guess you never played any other Fallout games....or read the whole post.
---
If FO76 has taught me anything, it's that there are a fuckton of mythical creatures supposedly wandering West Virginia. 
---
So, you're saying they can be shotguns or non auto rifles?
---
The mods not the plans.
---
Well, if you checked online for yourself, you would know. Right? Btw look at the latest ‚Äúinside the vault‚Äù post.
---
The unfortunate thing is that they told us there would only be a month or two of beta and when we bood they were like.. Nah its gonna be fine and then they release a train wreck.. But lets be honest it could have been worse. I do like the game alot but seeing reports of people duping and killing people in one shot who arent in pvp mode and breaking their bases im taking a few month break and hoping when i come back it will be a better experience
---
I so launched a nuke at 62. It took a LONG time to clear the silo. Didnt die though. Still hate assaultrons.
---
I kinda feel like I'm playing another version of fallout frost when I play 76.
---
I WANT TO BELIEVE
---
Yeah, I saw the rigged animation and I was 100% right about all the bells and whistles when people broke into the dev room. Don't you worry, it's not normalized properly yet.
---
PC or console?
---
Every time I see anything blue in nature now, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúooh soot flower!‚Äù
---
Right.. it's been a few hours, I've been looking since.
---
Let's just, ya know... Get over it and I won't do it again, okay? Sorry to annoy you
---
I was in on a big sbq fight last night. Over a dozen of us there. Lots of high lvs, lowest i saw was a lv 50. We couldnt kill her. 
---
She landed alot. We got her to mutate, then back down to about 20% before time ended.
---
Lots of add ons. It was fun, i burned through about 1700rds of ammo.
---
We got nothing but spinning arrow wheels In loot inventories.
---
Maybe some of the guys got something, but noone i talked to did. I was one of the last ones to leave. I picked up some flux, but with no glowing mass; even that was wasted.
---
I don't have anything to do with this, but I appreciate you guys work and letting me read the interesting lil thingy.
---
Not really a problem, simply log out and back in.
---
Ultimately, Spiderman and Fallout 76 made me stop.  I'll jump on every now and then to pvp with friends but these new bow and arrows are no joke.  I assume it's part of the last DLC.  I hated how each game wasn't finished until the final DLC,  at which point, everything from leveling to loot to the UI would change. I really disliked how with every new DLC, the world events would change and get rid of the events from the last DLC and render all the gear from the previous DLC as useless.  I paid for that!  Bring it back!
---
 Belly of The Beast is not "beating the game". ;) Its the just end of the Brotherhood quests.
---
I've noticed that my missile turrets are doing literal nothing ever since patch 6 on Xbox
---
Is this legit guys? Is it still working after reapplying?  Some post are saying it only works for so long..just want to know before I shed caps on all new serums. .
---
I‚Äôve had the opposite experience. Had someone super far away from me, and was chatting to him as clear as when he had been stood right next to me.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox though.
---
I too, did not have anything to do with the research other than being the foot soldier for checking map locations for OP. It was truly an amazing experience having some one randomly find my stream, ask me to help with an Easter egg hunt and then start to find all these little bits and pieces scattered all over the map that simply cannot he coincidences. It really renewed my faith in this game and made me see how much effort Bethesda is putting in behind the scenes and the crazy part is, the evidence is in plain sight! 
---
Except the entire point of this post is they didnt really cheat 
---
Someone DROPPED something to beat a final boss that at the time of the dupe glitch was bugged out on health 
---
But the real main problem is that most people being banned is PEOPLE WHO KILLED DUPERS TOOK THEIR STUFF AND DROPPED IT 
---
Bethesda whole plan for just checking inventories and banning is stupid 
---
Had they been patient came up with a way to check and see who made top much stuff like they said they were they wouldn't have banned a third of their entire fan base
---
I've had a few people go crazy and start shooting me after seeing something in my inventory that they desperately want. No idea why but my Nuka-Grenades seem to get a lot of attention. It's awkward, like a child throwing a tantrum... 
---
I'd love to see new weapons added, as an idea.  I play the game a lot to have all the super interesting weapons and more variety would probably help, just my opinion.
---
&gt; concentrated in online forums like Reddit
---
Yeah, no shit. That's what forums are for, to talk. In this case it's about fallout 76. The sentiment about the game coming out is a build up from those frustrating moments you were just talking about, people come here or to their place of choice and vent that frustration, then go back to playing.
---
I mean, ultimately it can't be anywhere where people aren't discussing the game so I don't know what you were getting at with that comment. That's like saying people looking to get off are concentrated in porn sites. People looking to watch videos are concentrated in streaming sites. This just in, streamers concentrated on streaming platforms! The outrage!
---
The overall sentiment about this game isn't overblown, it's just widely voiced. It seems overblown because so many people agree, it's in a bad place. Only a handful of super negative people are ranting and raving, while everyone else is quietly disappointed with some aspects and enjoying others. The most prevalent and repeatedly posted opinion is that of OP's. I see 3-4x as many I don't understand the hate posts as I see hate posts. I've really only seen hate posts prevalent when BGS really fucks up on a patch or something.
---
That looks effective! I am kinda looking for a build without sneak though. I prefer being in mob's faces :)
---
I‚Äôve ended up having to block two people so far that have asked for help, then continuously spammed me with game invites and party invites over the following days.
---
Bearing in mind, I **always** appear offline.
---
Then i wonder what it could mean if you haven‚Äôt found anything? Maybe nothing has happened? Common sense applies here.
---
But shock horror - no, nothing has happened aside from game improving stability and bug fixes. Look at the ‚Äúinside the vault‚Äù and you‚Äôll know what‚Äôs coming.
---
I feel your pain. It seems like I get the woodchuck perk card every card pack. 
---
I'm a bit worried about how this will work too. I was roughly level 57 when they added the ability to swap points and was bummed that I wasn't able to respec those last 7 levels. I'm \~110 now and finally feel a lot better about my SPECIAL allocation and available perks but it did take a while.
---
I beg to differ.  The online game was dead and boring at launch.  Also you claim it wasn't buggy? It was worse than buggy... There was no security and hacks appeared within a month...so many people were hacking it was absurd.  There were so many exploits it was absurd.
---
  At one point almost half the sessions I would enter would have some sort of hacker.  You just hoped it was one just making money appear random and not one instakilling everyone on the server whenever they wanted. There were so many exploits and glitches it was absurd.  I remember all the places people could glitch behind walls that they could shoot out of and not be shot back.  
---
People remember things selectively.  I remember all the rage and hate toward rockstar at the time.  People threatened lawsuits, people swore they'd boycott in the future...fast forward to today and everyone forgets.  I expect the same for bethesda.
---
Snalleygaster. I killed like three of them without taking any real damage in return, then the fourth killed me almost instantly.
---
i wonder if there is any utility outside of carry weight. would be cool to see stuff like being able to set it as a FT point
---
The L shapes chemistry bench is amazing for building. Those sweet corners that it can fill is really satisfying 
---
    To answer some questions, when someone invites you to the team, you gotta find them in the player list. But you have a period of time to hold the start button and instantly go the the menu and select accept invite.
---
    Every 5 levels you get a perk card pack with 4 perk cards and bubble gum, 1 perk card is animated, and the gum slows the rate of your natural need to drink and eat. You cannot undo perk card choices, but you can remove them from currently activated perks, or add them later if you have space.
---
    
---
I disagree. Once you level up in those previous games, the monsters became ‚Äòbunny rabbits‚Äô too. 
---
Whitesprings + relog trick done every 3 minutes yields more exp than whitespring+nuke+all the relogs in the world - its because even if one output is smaller per one respawn, the respawns are much more consistent. A guy who just tagged along with me exping made levels 60-80 in like 3-4h
---
You could do it without the sneak. Just put those points into more strength attributes or max out perception instead of agilty for more rifle damage. Then you would have melee and allot more ranged damage than I have with rifles
---
Is this something they specifically said or just something you're assuming from the roadmap? You could interpret that from the Wastelanders DLC in Q3, but given their past statements about NPCs I would definitely not feel comfortable making that assumption (or repeating it in all caps :P ).
---
Do you guys ever have any plans for an expansion to the map or new weapons? 
---
NPC, repetitive phrases, oh God! Triggered! Why did you‚Ä¶ (gunshot)
---
Maybe
---
But then griefers will know where your place is and wreck it
---
There is no proper AI (artificial intelligence) design in FO76. Enemies can spawn inside walls, floors etc. in your camp and just destroy it freely. Turrets are seeing enemies as friendly many times, because creature status (hostile or  friendly) is poorly designed and behind scripted spaghetti code.  Status check lags most of the time and fail to change creature status. So I don't think the fixes for these problems are coming into this game anymore. Maybe next Fallout game will be better if it is made by different company with different developers. One can hope...
---
And locking decor items so other players don‚Äôt just loot your camp for clean rare items
---
Now if they fix energy weapons not to be such trash we will be all set.
---
Yeah... Okay.
---
I've apologised, stated my initial reason to message the comm (hamfisted social awkwardness), I've said I won't do it again, I've mentioned that since first posting I did look at the road map.
---
And if your going to take on mobs you might as will have tenderiser and adrenaline perks as well
---
mine has a shotgun mod on it and also seems to be effected by the shotgun perks
---
exactly!!!! the cost is low (barring the shower I won't build again) but I have a family and life. this game is a creative and relaxing outlet for me and people bent on causing grief to other players aren't fun but as someone else noted they will find a way to do it anyway. sad.
---
and really. it doesn't matter if friends get less caps for killing you. that's bipassing (exploiting?) an in game consequence to actions that are frowned on. I am most unhappy that there seem to be zero consequences for anyone in this situation except the person just minding their own business and building. 
---
What i'm finding is that when I plan out the toon, most of the perk points are going into defense. I'll need to really calculate out what I can drop and what I need so that I can free up damage for guns/melee.
---
Ideally I'd love to find the Grail gun/melee bloodied tank non-PA build.
---
This may ultimately turn out to be impossible, but hey, experimentation is quite a bit of fun :)
---
&gt;Bethesda you nearly stole my heart with not giving up on 76.
---
Seriously?  They stole your heart for doing what we all expected of them?  I'd be damn fucking pissed if they just gave up on the game.
---
It really is upside-dowm, season-wise
---
Does the team have any plans for an expansion to the map or new weapons? 
---
Sincerely apologies, it really was a simple innocent question to the community. I'll learn my lesson
---
The meat piles seem to load if you drop something, anything in a bag on the ground. I don't know why it causes everything to load, but it seems to work. Try dropping a piece of junk, spoiled meat, or whatever next time.  I saw this posted yesterday and it worked like a charm for me last night, twice.
---
Well I‚Äôm a level 110 and have set off a good amount of nukes. Also need 1 trophy to get my platinum so yeah I think I‚Äôve completed the game. Just didn‚Äôt know what the ID card was for but I‚Äôve had my Ultracite before the changed it to where you have to learn the plans. I‚Äôm trying to find super rare outfits and things like that. 
---
I believe you. I'm thinking I got suspended for picking up duped loot in combat at Whitesprings. Take all option, about 600lbs of it. Didn't realize until after I was out of combat. Bethesda hasn't gotten back to me yet so I can see exactly what it was that I had, but it has been an emotional uphill battle between people on reddit who think you're a lying piece of shit duper and Bethesda support, who is radio silent. 
---
It wasn't a response to your question, really. More like a general criticism.
---
It doesn't. Not in 76. Int only boosts condition of crafted items. You need certain foods, leader bobble head, the well rested perk (sleep in game for about 1 min), and inspirational give exp boosts
---
So much hate is gone! Wasteland wonderland commenced. 
---
I was down there for awhile too. Was a very peaceful resource node cliff site.
---
So, basically you want to take the fun out of seeing what you get each time you visit a vendor?  Okay... Well... just server hop until you get what you want?
---
So...more Holotape questing is your plan for 2019?
---
Bethesda promised no pay-to-win. I know. It's not exactly PTW, but people are gonna flip 100%
---
Yellow is the stalking variant I think, and they‚Äôre hostile if you shoot. Red is vengeful and are hostile 
---
I‚Äôve played for so long and still haven‚Äôt seen a legendary behemoth yet. I know one spawns in a set location but I just want to find one based on luck :/
---
there's two variants of the mothman,  the wise mothman only spawns at the lighthouse after doing the quest and always has purple eyes. The other variant is the wild "aggressive" variant that has yellow eyes when not in combat and red when he's searching for you or attacking you. He seems to just be bugged sometimes, although I have never ran into him myself.
---
I completely agree the environment should be able to you destroy your camps.  and I understand letting players do it in a survival game BUT there is zero consequence for them doing it. that's what makes me upset. not that they can ...but that the only person that this negatively affects is the passive player just building.
---
The VOX Syringer.  That daily is so much fun.
---
I get where you're coming from, but your analogy is off. You're giving an example of two things expected to launch around the same time, and within the next 3-4 months. Mods and private servers have never been discussed alongside any other content, and they're more like 9+ months away. It's apples and oranges.
---
I think some kind of further confirmation would be cool, and I hope you get that much. But I don't expect them to talk about mods/private servers until we're much closer to their actual launch-- that's pretty common practice, especially since, IMO at least, there isn't much to talk about. We know the general timeframe, we know that mods will be applied by the server owner. The only real questions left are 1. When exactly are they coming, and 2. Will we have to pay for the servers. And I don't think it make sense to touch on either of those atm because Bethesda probably doesn't even know the answers. :-p
---
26th of March means exodus of PvP people to Survival mode. There is also some PvE content that should be released by then. Thats the first good candidate for return date, yo.
---
On Xbox I just check the LFG posts. Find 6 nukes on average during peak playing times over a couple of hours. 
---
I heard on PC there are discord groups who announce nukes, and I wouldn't be surprised if PS4 is the same. 
---
How does it give any extra respect points? When you get a card pack you still get to choose to move stats or pick a perk card. So the difference is only level 5 times, get 5 choices + a card pack vs your idea of every five levels you get five points OR a card pack? It's just locking the same points behind 4 extra levels.
---
The game is for some people but not for everyone, it‚Äôs really just personal preference. I love it and have put in about 300hrs since launch, but I don‚Äôt play competitively at all. I enjoy collecting junk and building bases. It‚Äôs like Minecraft in the fallout universe for me. 
---
that bar ‚Äúthe rusty pick‚Äù by the Charleston fire department has like 2 or 3 tables. 
---
People have already brought these problems to the public thousands of times, but army of Fanatic Bethesda Fanboys are down voting them.
---
Remove it, get a new serum crafted, use it. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen from a few different people here. 
---
&gt;TSE and anti armour aren‚Äôt exclusive. You can have both I personally rock a two shot, anti armour, quad mag pipe gun and I love it. 
---
So then you aren't running a TSE, you are running a TSAA NOT a TSE. The E means explosive. TSE absolutely was nerfed below other guns such as what you are running, TSAA.
---
The fact you even thought a two shot anti armor is a TSE really makes me doubt your understand of this game.
---
&gt;Also this game is more like a survival game just like rust, than it‚Äôs a looter or loot shooter like Diablo and or destiny. 
---
Bethesda has said this game isn't a survival game like rust, but closer to games like Diablo and borderlands. Which both not only allow mules, but even mention them in their guides.
---
I don't have any serum plans. Only 12 explosive vent plans unfortunately
---
If you're interested, I spent a couple days making an extended playlist for myself and a friend to listen to while we explored the wasteland. It's got music from the radio's of Fallout 3/4/New Vegas/76, Bioshock 1/2/Infinite, and other some other inspired music selections.  
---
[Here's a link for anyone interested](https://open.spotify.com/user/vaderman24/playlist/1vvwwNHJyeZTSadWzF2Ohc?si=zLovq5fySuqOmheFYSrHeQ)
---
Division style "hey want to team up with somebody for this?" sort of thing would be nice. I will say, I have randomly met up with a ton of people on FO76 and they are almost all super nice. Maybe one griefer out of every 20 folks I meet. And with the PVP-specific survival mode hopefully all the jerks will migrate over there.
---
The level cap is 65535, which is an unsigned integer‚Äî this was the same as FO4.
---
That‚Äôs the trick now. Having it nuked makes for more lag. I can see that. I thought the bloated glowing ones had a better yield as far legendary RNG though? 
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you need a new license for every game, you can't grandfather them in.
---
I secretly hope the prestige system affects perk cards (making certain 5 perk cards, only require 2 or 3 points for the same effect). 
---
My problem with this idea is that it takes away how Fallout should feel (imo). 
---
Our characters are basically the dawning of the rest of the franchise. My character's great-grandchildren will be raiders, members of the enclave, BoS soldiers etc. Without some kind of these elements effecting our play, it isn't a Fallout game. 
---
I do not raid, or "grief" as it's called now, but sometimes I come back to camp after looting and adventuring just to find someone has destroyed my camp. I generally ignore notifications about a player in my camp because I like the idea of a rabid, wild wasteland.
---
Well, it's weird.
---
The "standard" Tesla Rifle is a non-auto weapon.  There's a semi-auto receiver option and a "shotgun" option (which goes by "Charging Barrel").  Sometimes you see "Tesla Shotguns" for sale at vendors, but if you mod a Tesla Rifle with the charging variant, it doesn't gain that name for whatever reason.
---
\&gt;liter it with beer bottles   
---
I see what you did there
---
Somebody knows. I sure don't. I just do damage with very little defense. My defense is a lot of stimpaks and adamatium skeleton lvl 3 
---
Yes very true. I was wondering how they were going to handle this. Hopefully somehow they convert to camp items. How did they handle it in FO4?  I didn‚Äôt build much in that game but I was told you could place junk items.
---
And please play Take me home country roads more often! 
---
make sure you have the perk on that allows for more weapon mods, it looks like you have everything in place but the perk might not be on, happened to me a bunch 
---
Lol. Saw the same thing once @ Grafton. Couldn‚Äôt figure out where the shooting was coming from until i saw what was going on. 
---
Probably alot of that time is leaving it on though surely, I know alot of my hours are false because of this
---
Oh you need that for mods ? Thought you just needed that to craft. I‚Äôll give it a shot thanks 
---
I've seen that one too. ive also seen one with his head stuck in a wall and stretching and a dead Brahmin stuck headfirst in a wall. it was jiggling like crazy.
---
It‚Äôs been playable. Yeah I‚Äôve had some DC issues. When the stash was 400 it was tough, after the bump to 600 better but I still max out, and now 800 I‚Äôm almost maxed out. Not sure what‚Äôs up haha
---
Anyway, there are issues here and there, but most of the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù that mak people whine and cry are not having duped glitch guns anymore. Aka, having to play the game
---
Wow, for real? What platform? Every nuke Prime I‚Äôve been to on PC has been a slaughterfest. I think out of at least a hundred queen kills I‚Äôve only been at 3-4 that failed, and several since the previous patch (I haven‚Äôt been on much since the most recent one) were like 3 minute quickies. 
---
 Yeah I dunno about beating games in general. You can complete them. ;)
---
 The nuke launch would be it, though. ;)
---
Yeah looking for that
---
I heard that Phoenix took the other guys lunch from the fridge.. it's a cold cold world.
---
Awesome! Thank you! I‚Äôll probably just restart as I‚Äôm sure some of this is explained in the beginning. I‚Äôll read up more on the cards and what to use for my playstyle. I‚Äôll keep collecting, scrapping, and crafting. I made a barbed wire wrapped cane last night and it looks fairly hilarious. 
---
Random question, do you prefer first or third person. I was switching back and forth and couldn‚Äôt decide. Also learned I have a light. Could have used that last night haha. 
---
Thanks for the info!!
---
Interesting choice of defense perk - do you find that without PA you have issues with limb damage?
---
I have a bunch and am not sure what they are for...
---
I'm so confused.
---
Scenario: I hit level 40, and instead of being force fed a perk card pack of 4 cards (which happens every 5 levels) I get the option to choose said perk card pack OR forgo said perk card pack for a respec point pack. You still get your normal card/point choice as per usual. 
---
Does that make more sense? Apologies if I worded poorly. 
---
Gatling Plasma
---
People come to this sub reddit with the worst attitudes they cite that people lie as their reasoning for being such asses but they dont realize that half if not more of the problem with this thread isnt the liars it's the people who come in here for no reason but to assume and comment worthless negative opinions 
---
These are the facts you cant really say more people duped than not in here because there was a real life point in time when dupe hunters would go into comments sections and find dupers just to kill them and take their I'll gotten gains away and toss them 
---
And there ARE real life vendors out here selling huge bulks of items 
---
Just as there are vendors out here giving away huge bucks of items due to them quitting 
---
Now with all these routes you CANNOT justify using a half ass item monitoring system 
---
If your intentions is evening out the playing field WITHOUT giving half your player base the finger then just do account wipes 
---
Banning people who just bought or received a huge stock of items does nothing that wiping wouldn't besides .make them not want to come back 
---
And Bethesda KNEW their system isnt shit with all the unfair bans they were getting shit for and still are i.e. the 900 hours guy 
---
And yet instead of actually trying to be a good company they did the absolute shittiest thing and just made bans unable to be overturned and ignoring all the tickets they get 
---
They were ignoring the tickets before and it got out which is why they just went ahead and publicly stated they'll be ignoring all the rest 
---
Honestly defend 76 all you want I liked the game but looking back I only liked going out and hunting and selling rare outfits 
---
But I have to be objective and Bethesda tried to sweep their mistakes under the rug with this new road map 
---
But I cant help feeling shafted paying 35 bucks for an experience that was so mishandled 
---
If you can honestly say you got banned for using in game mechanics that were MEANT to be in game 
---
I.e stealing from other players/ stealing dupers shit and dumping it then there is NO EXCUSE 
---
Especially when you count in the 900 hours guy story 
---
Lvl3 of that one eliminates all limb damage
---
Well if you complete all main quests and side quests and you get achievements, then yeah I‚Äôd say you completed it. Once Bethesda adds the new stuff, if there are trophies then that‚Äôs where I go for them again, completing them until given more. 
---
Exactly.
---
 What's wrong with your level 30?
---
I got my answers..and ordered the game..thanks everyone!
---
This person claims to have legitimately crafted over 200,000 rounds of Ultracite ammo.
---
I don't think much of that is 'afk' time.
---
whaaaaaaaat???? omg i've gotta try this
---
I'm guessing we'll be able to have portable workbenches and that sort of thing.
---
I like 1st person for no real reason, but if the gun has bad sights I go 3rd to snipe more easily. The strongest builds in the game right now are melee, shotgun, stealth sniper, and vats, if you want a meta build
---
Most of hate train is disconnected from the actual issues of the game and focus on outdated or irrelevant bullshit instead. There is a lot of valid criticism for the game and most of this valid criticism is a constructive one, from tired people who want something they like turn to something they love. It does not deserves most of its reviews, as most of its reviews are made by people angry it aint F5 who barely played it. Is it a terrible game? It never was. Did Bethesda worked to get nicknames such as Bughesda? For sure.
---
Can 100% say it still works, perfect fix!
---
Wish came true :)
---
that sounds like COMMIE TALK TO ME, SOLDIER
---
Perhaps, that's where the Mole Miners come from, and where we'll find the Purveyor legendary vendor!
---
Are mod tools and private servers still coming a year after launch? That's a major reason why i bit the bullet and bought the game.
---
Yeah, Dark Souls had a better "Loot" drop placement system.  If you fell off of a cliff in DS, your souls would be on the ledge before the drop.  In Fo76 they are where you splatted on the ground.  It also sucks if you drop off of a big cliff and hit an outcropping halfway down and you bag is placed on that outcropping making it almost impossible to get back.
---
I did basically the same thing when in the Glassed Cavern üò≠  Had just defeated the Scorchbeast and the  accidentally walked backwards into a pit. I was heartbroken.
---
I know the t-51 calibrated shocks
---
It‚Äôs amazing, the only problem is it gets weird when you exit your PA, because the chest piece on your PA is now no longer in your inventory, and thus leaves your favorites weird.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs an inaccessible door at the crashed space station too
---
T-51b calibrated shocks are sold by vendor Phoenix at watoga station for about 6k a plan
---
no spoilers but there's a quest in Watoga that you should hold off on finishing until level 50
---
Actually there's a reason to not ever finish it at all for legendary farming purposes
---
I definitely am as well
---
Hi there! I'm currently running Bloodied/Unyielding VATS Sniper Crit - 15A 15L. What I have found is that the high L fills that Crit meter fast and high A is tons of AP.
---
I use 4 pcs of Unyielding and 1 Chameleon. Nothing sees me, nothing touches me and most things die in 1 shot. Gun-fu and Adrenaline are my bread and butter with Tank Killer, Tenderizer, Bloody Mess, Sandman, Covert etc. 
---
I have a great time with it :)
---
I took a break from the game for a month or two, and the difference in server stability/lag and everything seems phenomenal since the duping issues were taken care of, really made me happy to come back :p
---
I‚Äôd be cool to this. People hav such a whine fest about P2W. Paying for a stash increase is P4P...pay for premium. Which is why it‚Äôs called premium. 
---
I want to have collection of Magazines and Bears and Bobbleheads. I can‚Äôt do that with a small stash, or how the game is ‚Äúmeant‚Äù to be played. 
---
So why not give people the ability to bend the system a bit to have what they want? You can play the game to the full for free. You never have to touch your atoms! The game isn‚Äôt made easier for a premium, just quality is better. You don‚Äôt pay to win, cause you can win on your own. There‚Äôs no paywall that becomes impossible to pass
---
Premium vs normal is a facet of everything y day life. Why not here?
---
That would be REALLY cool, imagine in one of the DLCs we can nuke it and get like a kraken to spawn!
---
or as my online buddies say "don't step in the stupid"
---
Was said it would be a year after launch.
---
No. They're easy af and tse is still plenty powerful. I solo run silo's on my heavy weapons toon with a shitty single star gatling gun. More importantly, everyone who had those weapons still have them. It's not like they evaporated. Bethesda didn't delete all dupes, they just deleted stacks of items that weren't meant to be stacked.
---
Heh, people have speculated for a long ass time that the ES and Fallout universes are linked. Would be cool if BGS confirmed the link by making the Interloper a Lovecraftian god, combining the two universes and making the interloper the cause of the cryptids and corruption of pre-war man
---
change servers as soon as they start shooting you. They have a hard time killing you but can still destroy your camp, it's part of the CAMP mechanics. Put your camp somewhere more inconspicuous, block the asshole so he can't see where you are and change servers. I've only run into one griefer in like 200 hours and I just logged out and in and he was gone.
---
They already did that with literally every other power armor part plan BUT the headlamps. It's just odd that the headlamps aren't part of it.
---
Idea: Cooked food should not degrade as quickly as raw/uncooked.
---
They do, substantially I might add, and that's the real point of farming anyway. Who the fuck farms xp unless they want to rebuild their toon? No one, because until prestige, xp after 50-75 (depending on build) is a waste of time.
---
Right after the game came out I was wandering around randomly and encountered this guy with a wanted sign. He didn't have his mic on like a lot of newbies and I was like "hey so you need someone to kill you?" and he emoted yes so I took a swing at him and he killed me instantly with an LMG. Well at the time all I knew about inventory management was to have level three pack rat and carry all my junk around with me. Needless to say the dude did not leave my junk there for me to retrieve. I was really, really angry about it. But it did teach me that you actually do not need to hoard junk in this game. Having zero stored junk actually makes the game a little more fun - you have to go on these little junk collection quests to get what you need.,
---
There are only so many camp items that have any functionality. Turrets are one of them. They may not be super effective but they do something. And i like the aesthetic. Plants and couches are also pointless but they all have their place. 
---
Oh, I see what you mean. So you want to be able to "convert" the card pack to respec points ASIDE from the points you get from normal leveling?
---
This is a legitimate question but weren't dupers part of the problem affecting the servers? If they just added to the problem and theirs other issues, it'd just be interesting. 
---
Where was the leak for the Sheepsquatch monster? Monster designs are one of my favorite aspects of Fallout, I'd love to see what it looks like.
---
A fresh start just sounds nice
---
Good question... I think that anti-armor stuff is multiplicitive... So 50% and 50% gives a total of 75% armor reduction... Maybe it is similar? I doubt that it would be possible to fully eliminate all damage from a weapon class.
---
He is always being attacked by the other robots.  Every time I enter Watoga, I have to go there first if I want to get to him before they do.
---
Clear out the clubhouse and sell all the outfits :)
---
This happened to me too. I had maxed my budget (but with only two turrets). My missile turret went missing -- with just a wire left behind. I can't repair it, I can't add a new one. I have no idea what happened to it. 
---
I don't really feel like moving my camp, I kinda like it where it is. And I don't know if there is a guarantee the situation will fix itself if I do.
---
All platforms?
---
Just follow the quests.  They take you pretty much everywhere and stop you from going into too high level areas off the start.
---
All I'm getting from Adrenal Reaction is -50HP. Its Broke Broke and Bugthesda Broke it...smh. 
---
Sorry to disappoint the texture files are in the Atom shop section of the game files.
---
more people on here that don't like getting one shot then I had originally thought. They'll down vote but won't come fight me and give me their caps XD 
---
I only had my camp destroyed once and then, since melee build is the meta and I don't actually use my decontamination shower, I just stored it so people couldn't mess with it. Problem solved.
---
I refuse to participate in RNG anymore. I farmed the game as intensely as it was possible (I'm talking whole days spent respawning legendary mobs while simultaneously using two accounts to maximise the grind). My main character has NEVER rolled anything. My 15cha mule rolled cavalier leg and BE gattling in the fraction of time since I play with him. I traded the hell out of those items, seeking for people who'd do 2to1 deals with similar class items (often buying things I didnt needed but could sell better), until I got full weapon set and full cavalier armor. I now barely play anymore until something is changed with the game, but I still browse trading channels, especially stores of people who are clearly noob. For maximum efficiency, my cavalier set requires one chameleon prefix, and three times legendary mod ap refresh. Best leg type should have custom fitted craftable mod, which decreases sprint ap cost. I recently bought chameleon ap refresh cavalier metal leg for 800 caps. There are people who would pay thirty times as much for it, but I'm keeping :&gt;
---
If you run a bloodied build, emergency protocols is a straight up 50% damage reduction
---
What, I‚Äôm a little lost?
---
I found a Furious Explosive Western Revolver at the Watoga Train vendor once
---
All I could say is "What mad man would sell this???"
---
You can find them, and craft them! Perks help the damage output on them
---
Ooof, good question. Xbox One now, if I had the time I'd definitely open a shop on ps4 and PC 
---
I found him standing in a pond somewhere near Seneca Rocks, IIRC. Of course, when he died, he dropped nothing of any value.  I have no desire to run into one again - it took me several days of grinding afterwards to replenish all of the ammo I used on him.
---
Class Freak reduces it to -12 max HP
---
I launched a nuke solo as well. Did it around level 48-50. Was definitely very difficult. 
---
well, rip my wallet ,i guess :(
---
Instigating assault rifle, instigating lever action (a true beast), instigating handmade and explosive shotgun with 25% faster reload. 
---
doing queen or not doing queen (in blast zone or not in blast zone) I experience incredible server wide lag every time a nuke is launched.  (even on a low level toon in the forest for example)
---
Walk into an arts and craft store. If you walk down the glue aisle and realize that you briefly got excited, you need to stop playing for a while.
---
KICK THE BUCKET!
---
gt?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard about the pond spot and I‚Äôm just crossing my fingers for a random encounter cause it‚Äôll feel more rewarding cause my luck is trash 
---
They only show up at the bunker from what I've seen. No plans, only mod. Weren't expensive just rare.
---
See, haters. This is evidence that FO76 really isn't a lazy, unwritten, un-designed hodge podge of reused assets from FO4... the workbenches are different!
---
Right on, there's probably a hand full of places I haven't seen mention it.
---
The current thing is unyielding armor or bolstering armor and bloodied explosive guns, anti armor explosive, furious explosive. Explosive isn't as unbalanced as it was but it's still in high demand.
---
Myself, I'm moving into heavy guns / melee. But that is partly due to an expectation that they will get a damage / durability boost in the future. 
---
Where‚Äôs the best place to find them or find plans to make them?
---
Don't hunt what you cant kill lol :D
---
I play on Xbox, and I like it.
---
A Puppy
---
Clean Interior Walls
---
A Robot Companion (every time I shoot an eyebot I have to apologize to E-DE)
---
My conclusion after 230 lvls of playing... Turrets only work when you build a platform base near the whitesprings clubhouse. 
---
Actually it‚Äôs Scuzzlebutt
---
Super mutants are a good source. They can carry sledgehammer or the super sledge. 
---
OtakuWoody
---
I needed a kitchen sink....
---
I definitely am, haven't wandered too far at all. I guess I more so am struggling to figure out my purpose or role in this new world. It just feels so different lol
---
VATS Crits heal you and your teammates if they're within it's range.
---
I always pick up a super sledge, that and the death tambo are my two favorite weapons right now, but it‚Äôs only one handed. I didn‚Äôt even know you could get two handed until I saw it on Reddit 
---
why do they get flagged wanted? because it's supposed to be a consequence. instead of making those consequences matter and punish the actual aggressor you're suggesting I just store my shower and it solves the problem? can I pack it my entire camp too?  will that solve a problem?
---
the problem is that there aren't consequences for  the person committing the crime. they are bipassing that and the only one paying anything is the person that's the victim here. 
---
Two Shot The Dragon. I was shooketh.
---
Yeah I had a low level character stumble across me in my camp. We looked at each other for a few seconds and when I realized he wasn't there to cause trouble I started rooting through my stash to see if there was anything he could use. I dump stuff I'm just holding onto for sentimental reasons and clear up stash space, he gets some useful stuff, win win.
---
How is that amount justified? 
---
I login daily and do the challenges because I'm worried I'll miss something cool in the Atom Store. It's not so much of a concern, but I have noticed that I've been able to reacquire spent Atoms in the time between content releases that are 'must have' purchases for me. That's not a good thing, is it? Surely I should be at 0 Atoms consistently, why would I pay for them otherwise?
---
That said, there are lots of items that do interest me, C.A.M.P objects as an example but I'm comfortable waiting to buy them because they're what I would consider minor additions to my experience and not limited time deals.
---
Its fun as long as you can keep yourself busy and play with friends. Otherwise youll run into hoards of enemies that, in some cases, are impossible to take care of by yourself. Theres plenty to do and see tho. The map itself is beautiful and gigantic, its one of the reasons i keep coming back. Plus, the DLC roadmap has been revealed and as of yet, seems to be looking very very good. All in all its just a fallout game.. with friends. 
---
There's a couple Halloween costumes in game, the skeleton, clown, and witch. I've only ever seen the hat for the witch but if you get a random event you can find her body and loot the costume/plans. 
---
Adding new songs would wreck immersion though. The radio broadcasters have been dead for a long time so no new song would be able to be added
---
Super sledge, fire axe, multi purpose axe, and grognaks axe are all 2 handed. If your wearing power armor it looks like a 1 hand but this buffed by 2 handed perks. 
---
While it's an inconvenience it's not game breaking. The only time they've hotfixed was after the patch that accidentally rolled back a bunch of stuff to the previous patch and while the obvious problems there were just low priority crap like Bobby pin weight the real reason would have been what the patch had fucked up under the hood server side. 
---
I found heavy combat leg plans at harpers ferry, value of plan (after what is shown in my inventory) is 500, I dont know what the markup is from vendors, figured that would be easier to calculate than telling you what I bought them for with had bargain and 10? Chr
---
I took a screenshot as proof, will update in a minute
---
That's already how it works.
---
Thanks for the cool tipüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
On my PS4 after the latest patch I still can‚Äôt assign variants of the same item to my hotwheel. If I put two Gatling guns or Grog axe on it, one will disappear when I rejoin the game. Anyone else have the same issue? I imagine if I put two PA chest pieces on it, one will disappear too. 
---
TurdFergusonn 
---
Levels after 50 are for min/maxing all of your Perk Cards ie: I can switch out Adrenaline for 5 points during the day and 2 points at night to slot in Mr Sandman.
---
Well its a pretty good idea then lol
---
1* Bloodied Super Sledge, only cost me around 100 caps too
---
Ok so I may be misunderstanding- 2 handed melee weapons are just a single weapon you hold with two hands?  It‚Äôs not that you can hold one weapon in each hand - thus being melee weapons for two (both) hands? 
---
Just make them scale with you with a max level of 50. That way the 10% budget is justified. 
---
I reset my mutations and redid them. It fixes Adrenal Reaction for sure but when you log and come back the positive text will be missing from your effects tab but the numbers on your guns will be correct. 
---
Wr must have been fighting the same queen yesterday. When I was eventually able to pick up loot it didn't show up in my inventory. Them like 5 minutes later after I had jumped cal to my camp, all the lot suddenly hit my inventory. 
---
Ok. I didn‚Äôt think one person would have time to run a shop on all platforms but I thought maybe you were part of a network. 
---
Correct. There‚Äôs no duel wielding 1 handed to make 2 handed. 
---
I swear I heard a scorched officer on the bus the other day. 
---
Yep, exact same thing happened to me
---
Well in FO76, we are part of the way there. The Responders were those kinds of people. It is too bad that we can't play factions like FNV.
---
For me I felt really overwhelmed. Don‚Äôt know why, but so much to see and do. I eventually got buckled down though
---
You know what you have to do. 
---
Its very hard to fight the last boss alone as it pretty much summons half of the server.
---
In order to be able to actually fight her alone, you need a team anyway. You have to keep one rather old server as a team for a longer while. Past some point of server lifecycle, there is a point by which it ceases to let new players in, waiting for all people to leave it so it could restart peacefully. Being in such state means its performance is usually impacted, increasing crash rate, kicking people out. If you keep returning to your team, you may end up on a server thats desolate. It'll clear up lag after a while, still waiting for you to leave it. It takes about 6-8 hours of continuous playtime if you are lucky and land on a server that is soon getting flagged as 'no more people plz'. Its pretty much only scenario I see that guarantees a solo final boss fight.
---
I started to play anthem then seen the road map now I'm back lol :p 
---
That‚Äôs correct. A melee weapon that needs 2 hands to wield 
---
The only boards that are hard to do solo are in solos and nuke zones though right? I‚Äôve been soloing this game and think it‚Äôs totally viable so don‚Äôt be scared off by that imo
---
You can get a legendary mission reward for completing the 'Mayor for a Day' quest in Watoga which is a Super Sledge with the Heavy rocket attachment and a -90% weight buff
---
Yes, i didnt read any guides when i first started. I was constantly irradiated and full of diseases. I also died. A lot.
---
You should just be able to put on what songs you want to hear. I hear country roads once every 2 days , but the shitty songs all the time 
---
Holy crap. Mind blown. Well damn. Now I feel like a complete idiot posting this question. Apparently I‚Äôve been using a two handed the whole time, and I could have chosen two handed perks to increase damage. I didn‚Äôt of course because I thought I‚Äôd find a weapon I could use in both hands. 
---
I think when survival mode comes out in March everyone who plays it will be forced to create a new character and only play with others on survival mode , that may be what you‚Äôre looking for .
---
I can help  my gt is phishntrips   I'll need a minute to get ready. 
---
Why not sub? I mean you comment so you have an account? 
---
Now I want to. 
---
Yeah it's not an ideal fix. 
---
The only problem with that is mark 7 turrets are no joke with their stun lock and a player can easily set them up in a way that they're pretty hard to take down. I think some increasing cost would be justified.
---
I haven‚Äôt made it into Watoga yet. Only a level 45 and still enjoying the Forrest, claiming workshops, and hoarding junk. It‚Äôs on my to do list though in the next few days though 
---
It's not bother brother, only mutations that add flat over all DPS or STR directly affect the chainsaw and drill, while the appropriate melee stuff affects ripper and mr handy.  So Adrenaline and perks that add STR are the biggest damage increases from mutations.  Unyielding armor pieces, low HP, alcohol with the perk that triples it's affect, Bloody Mess, etc are all good ways to greatly buff the damage to being able to faceroll through all current content with very little risk.  The mr handy and ripper can do the same once they get beyond 100 damage per tick and get do everything the chainsaw does even better beyond that point and can scale up even higher with more safety since they can also make use of the melee perks associated with 1 or 2 handers (ripper is 1 hander, mr handy is 2 hander)
---
I guess I was thinking that gta story mode was quality and that was good enough to hold people over for awhile. And honestly gta online in its infancy was better all around than fo76 was.  
---
Totally agree. I think people are straight up against atom shop completely. But I want to support the game so more free stuff is added.. need a big atom market ! üòé
---
I just started messing around with removing CF3 and the +Damage returned, then I found the others just by accident when trying to equip Solar Powered to get more STR during the day and by removing one of the Endurance cards my Weapon Damage went back up!
---
I‚Äôd recommend waiting until 50 to do mayor for a day to get a max level all rise 
---
Mine had been 50/50. Sometimes they are OP full-auto sniper guns obliterating things at ridiculous range. Others they get mole-ratted to death. No rhyme or reason. I think they are more worth having than not, but not more than 4 or so. 
---
All good, it happens to everyone at some point in time lol. For 2h damage perks you‚Äôre gonna wanna grab the 3 slugger perks. 
---
Just to clarify.. people aren't going to be able to walk up and take all my Teddybears? D:
---
Nevermind now it works again.
---
IMO just serverhop the club house. Kill all the ghouls + loot all the golf outfits. Running around is a waste of time.
---
Drop the legendaries you don‚Äôt want infront of the door. 
---
Bluegrass music! O‚Äô Brother Where Art Thou-esque. It can be done! 
---
I'd rather they fix energy weapons before adding any more weapons to the game.
---
don't thank them thank the mod you have installed
---
Don't see the need for it. I have this subreddit bookmarked.
---
I dont see how its possible to take down a hoard of 30+ (not an exxageration) lvl 65 bloated glowing ones at lvl 20. 
---
Away with you! 
---
It would definitely add more of a sense of unity against the wasteland rather than against the player
---
Technically that's less of a fix than just breaking it slightly less. You'll get the bonus back but it still won't show in effects. It's a bug. If people are actually reporting it instead of running to whine on reddit they'll get to fixing it. People complaining they HAVE to remove and reapply all their mutations are just letting their impatience waste time and caps. 
---
I'll agree with you about Fallout 3 having great DLC. Fallout 4 was a disappointment, though.
---
Dude Reddits all about toxic af people dont worry bout people say &lt;3
---
We‚Äôll give a more detailed break down as we get closer to that. For now you‚Äôll have to wait and see :)
---
You're obviously not playing ENOUGH Fallout because that is obviously a tinkerer's bench and you're first thought should have been looks like I need to switch in ammosmith and super duper and craft some ammo.
---
Why do you put &gt; in front of your messages? Just curious 
---
I downloaded latest happy to play but survival mode but  isn't out yet sadly. Probably gonna do heavy and shor when survival comes out. Hopefully there aren't many weponns that can one shot through PA
---
You could decorate with items in that you could drop them from your inventory, pick them up and then place them wherever you wanted. It wasn't an officially supported settlement feature.
---
The way they should do it here is how the OCDecorator mod worked. It turned junk items into static objects that could not be picked up in the regular game mode. They could only be moved while in the build menu.
---
Problem is it was not 200k and there isn't 200k on my account.
---
That would be op
---
I find myself listening to the classical radio a lot when killing ghouls and whatnot. It's just thrilling 
---
Anyone else let back in? Where u?
---
I didn't have time to store the junk I had and I was in the middle of quest. Besides I just wanted to get somewhere safe since there were three scorchbeasts flying around outside of the cavern that I wanted to get away from. If it weren't for those scorchbeasts I would have just fast traveled to the nearest train station and dropped off my junk. 
---
The last piece I needed to make my irl home look exactly like my base in fallout 76.
---
Careful you don‚Äôt play too long you‚Äôll get banned 
---
Jesus Christ its just fucking adrenal reaction. Stop being a fucking drama queen. 
---
Ive heard of a single example, has anyone been unbanned yet?
---
It is supposed to have utility. The one in the picture seems to possibly protect your junk from dropping, since you have your stuff in a locked box and clearly marked is "My Stuff".  
---
;-) 
---
Yep. I had someone last week at WS station take a shot at me for not responding.  I turned around and let him or her continue shooting and then I one shotted them with my modded shotgun.
---
The person returned and gave me tbe ???? Emote. 
---
I have to say, as someone who‚Äôs played through FO4 four times, I prefer that perk system to FO76
---
I would say vats. Melee you have to always turn and be swinging at the enemies up close. Seems like that would be harder. 
---
Happened to me with technical data but i couldn't pick it up. 
---
Scrap whatever the turret is sitting on, also scrap any wires first leading to it.
---
I had a scorched melee chasing me around harpers ferry. Had to log out to get rid of it. I could see it going up and down the underside of the stairs by the train (near where you spawn when you fast travel). But couldn‚Äôt shoot it, melee it, or grenade it. (lol, fun timing that)
---
That‚Äôs precisely why I don‚Äôt accept invites. I don‚Äôt want them going to my CAMP and wreaking havoc. 
---
Ok sir I am sorry if I offended you by trying to help some people get the bonus of their mutation back, and while I do agree that people are over reacting a bit I just wanted people to know they can still have the mutation.
---
When you craft new power armor the new pieces have no mods and you cant remove mods. Unfortunately I dont think you can upgrade a previous piece to a higher level but I could be wrong...
---
I've had technical data show up on my floor but it was after I'd gotten kicked off the server
---
Run both and switch to emergency protocol when your health drops enough
---
Been playing 200+ hours and still haven't caught a  glimpse of him.
---
Hmmm, is Saturday the day they generally update the in-game Atom Store banner thing? If it is then perhaps the game and their servers cant link up for the updated material and your PiHole server is preventing that thinking it is an "advertisement". 
---
Does this happen if you change to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1), load up the game, play the game for a little then revert back to PiHole?  If so then there's something more weird going on here.
---
It hurts my heart each time to have to leave Marcus somewhere.
---
I really doubt she'd like to play this game if she's struggling with the controls on console already.
---
This is true I can confirm
---
I dunno I use different PA peices. Like my Tesla is on an excavator, while my jet pack is on a x01 ext
---
Interesting. So Strength DOES impact Chainsaw damage. I don't know where I got the idea that it did not have an impact.
---
I blueprinted my camp when I made it. When I go into build mode and bring up the blueprint like I am going to place it, I can see the missing turrets. I believe when I did that before, or removed the block on which they were standing, they appeared back in my stored objects. Unfortunately, I have stacked stairs which means I either need to move the whole thing, or store everything and build from the blueprint. In all cases, it is inconvenient.
---
Oh I gotcha! I used to never have a account and would just come to them aswell, but I made one finally and just subbed lol 
---
Just don't exit your PA easy peasy
---
You're not meant to store Technical Data in your stash since the latest patch. If you had any in there it will be dropped in a bag instead.
---
hey mate are you still selling this?
---
I get that 1 in 5 times. I stopped trying and went back to the old way of just server hopping. It takes 5 seconds longer but at least I‚Äôll never have to quit and restart the game (Xbox One).
---
All Phoenix wants to do is sell his wares and buy our garbage and all he gets is abuse from his fellow machines üòî
---
Well that just makes it sound like there is something on the dish. 
---
I was thinking the same thing. Unless It does it retroactive and puts a cap to level 50, and then gives people above 50 the bonuses to match.
---
Pretty sure Tesla will do more work than the Reactive Plates
---
Like others, it's the unpickable technical data that keeps haunting me.
---
it seems some areas of the map can handle the nuke differently.
---
Ya I should have added XBox one here too
---
Mods are causing the problem?
---
Dang xbox only :p I'm on ps4 but this is an amazing and cool idea ! Props to ya :)
---
Although I am having tons of issues with the developers and I do not want to play anymore (deleted the game this morning actually) I would definitely give it a go and make sure you make some friends as the others have suggested. You can for sure have a great time. Word of warning, if you find a bag with an unholy gob of stuff in it, dont pick it up. Don't accept gifts of large qty from strangers  either. 
---
My dumb butt never realized there was one that was always hostile. I'm in a hilly area in the dead of night and happen to look up and see red eyes glaring down at me. So....I run up the hill to go say hello to the nice mothman and maybe get an xp boost. 
---
Luckily it was my first encounter. It screamed like a banshee and took off like a rocket, but didn't come back to kill me. 
---
It's not supposed to be...why are you in a nuke zone solo at level 20? Even if not solo why at level 20? That's end game stuff. 
---
thanks, you are probably right. I was hoping it was more like the Blade of Bastet or Voice of Set where the old piece is part of the materials used to upgrade and so, maybe in this case, previous mods would still apply
---
This is exactly what I was thinking 
---
You have a good point.  I didn‚Äôt think about that.  I‚Äôll probably set her up with an automatic rifle to spray and pray outside VATS.
---
Starched genes mutation 
---
Yea I dont believe it works like that with power armor. That's why you should always keep that stuff until you have max. 
---
Good on them for not giving up. Still wish I never bought this (for $60 at launch), I might check it a year from now when the game is complete 
---
yes
---
im not on pc but there is a tread about it and how to fix it
---
From my experience, all of the holo games are random magazine drops (except Nuka Tapper). I eventually got all 8 by server hopping/farming magazine drop sites. I‚Äôd recommend Sons of Dane, three spawn points relatively close together.
---
Ps4, but I think ps4 was more plagued than PC and it turned a lot of people away. I've been in servers with 3-4 people. 
---
Same on ps4. Tried once, I'll try again when it's "fixed."
---
Doing the lords work, thankyou!! üôåüôè‚ù§
---
It said in the statement factions were also coming
---
Both are good and very similar early game, ba pipe are easier to mod (lower gunnut perk requires), but do not have as extensive a set of mod as hunting rifles. 
---
If you throw a spotlight near them it'll drastically help them find targets 
---
I‚Äôll check that out in a second 
---
Where was this teased ?
---
They can't abandon the game anytime soon as the hit to their reputation will effect all future online only game sales. They are spending money now to salvage their reputation.
---
They stated previously, you can bring yer current char to the new survival mode. ;) 
---
You're right. I'll give em a lil break and let em recover some of those caps.

Same here. I couldn't complain much as my squishy level 40 self wasn't able to contains lot to the fight besides aggroing some of the mobs off the ones actually doing damage, and stiming a few that went down. 
---
That's still their own fail though. Purchasing stuff blind is about the stupidest thing you can do as a consumer.

Clearly fake news, everyone knows Australia is upside down so how is it rights side up in

What could make the radio better IMO on top of more songs (or more variety) would be an Appalachian deejay. And yeah, yeah no more humans. Fine. Just get the Free States Vendor Bot at Harpers Ferry his own old timey folk country music station (a lot of that music may not even need licensing any more) and then every so often he chimes in with some shtick on the evils of government regulation. As an added bonus he there could be a mission where you wire him up to Abby's Surveillance network and then he can inform you audibly of new daily missions: The. Mayor. of. GRAFton. is. looking. for. SOMEone. to. help. with. Sec-ur-i-ty. for. his. GRAFton. Day. Parade. Volunteers. Should. Apply. In. Person. At. The. GRAFton. Mayors. Office.
---
Wasnt a nuke zone. It was at the whitespring tho. But no blast zone, no radiation, no flux. Just a shit ton of bloated glowing ones. Might have been right after the 3 hour mark or something, but my statement still stands... In some cases.... the hoards are too much for a single player to endure. In those instances, its always good to get at least a few shots in to get that exp and let the robots take care of the rest.

I would not hold your breath, but you can fix it yourself by removing and regaining it.

That greenish fire

I guess we‚Äôll see.  She‚Äôs watched me play before and has said she wants to try playing with me.  I still have my old Xbox One and we can game share so it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try. 
---
Anyway, my question wasn‚Äôt whether or not she would like the game.  It was what build would allow her to enjoy the game as a casual gamer.
---
Yeah I know, but the amount of salt that poured out of this sub when the nerf happened you'd think theyd been replaced with paintball guns
---
I would love a flail made outta a deathclaw head and some chain \*heart eyes\*
---
Also for if you do this mission I would bring a friend for the last bit of it
---
That is correct. New factions is coming, but it doesn‚Äôt mention the faction pvp-system. However it would make sense launching that system with the new factions, but I‚Äôm not assuming anything rn.
---
link? I can‚Äôt find this
---
Hornwright estate is known to be haunted... And bugged as fuuuuck

Oh I‚Äôm agreeing with you. People don‚Äôt educate themselves then think they have the right to be assholes

Will definitely be contacting you later to drop on by. This is exactly what I've been looking for haha
---
I'll add it.
---
cool
---
No you don't, but at lower levels with no real build you do lol unless you really do your best like all these people and I did
---
No they budgeted money to cover this period of development. 
---
Thanks for info
---
I'm on PS4 so I can't visit but just out of curiosity, do you also sell plans for some of them?
---
Following 
---
But how rewarding was it when you put the code in and sent it soaring?
---
Bronze faces?
---
It's not customers that will get in a fit over a lie like that but investors. If you lie about the state of your business to investors then you are going to be in really big trouble. Anyway I fail to see what's controversial about saying that a couple of million people bought the game as it would easily have sold that many copies.
---
Added a link
---
I think u misunderstood what I was saying
---
Do you have many mutations? Sometimes they are broken with updates, if you have not removed and reapplied them they may be buggy, but idk.
---
Really depends on how much you want to invest. A set of really good legendary combat armor will provide a better overall set of stats or some nice DR bonuses, but will require a heavy investment of time to get the pieces you need, get all the plans to upgrade to the best type, and require some fine tuning to get them where you want to be. Plus it requires a few extra points in Agility for White Knight as it breaks much faster than power armor.
---
Power armor will let you get that DR much easier with less farming and let you jump off buildings will-nilly, with much less investment. Stats won't be as good, but it helps out low strength builds immensely by setting Strength to 11. It is also HIGHLY durable and though Power Patcher helps, it isn't needed anywhere near as much as White Knight is. Downside is that it eats cores fast without proper perks.
---
So really, its a tradeoff and more of a personal preference.
---
I would imagine that it‚Äôs either part of Nuclear Winter update. Or not part of this years plans,
---
Oh please let it be 3(or both).
---
Yeah they responded to numerous threads about that , since that aspect got a lot of negative feedback , they said that nothing is set in stone and it is subject to change.
---
Harpoons can have scoops!? Awesome!
---
I don't have a lot of plans just yet, I'm farming for Cranberry Bog treasure maps lately to find T series plans. When I run across mods or plans for mods they go into my stash, and I usually just give away the plans I already know. I was never in on the duping crowd, so I'm slowly buying the plans I need for my shop so I can make mods. 
---
The reality is neither the "hurray" gang or the perpetual moaners actually know how much content is going to be added, the new main quest could be tiny or it could be bigger than the original...no one fucking knows. 
---
I'll have to look into that. I thought that the reflect 50% back on melee would be good since I seem to get in close to the enemies. 
---
I absolutely agree.  With the problems so far, a fresh start is what it would take to get me playing again.  I think an approach like Path of Exile would be good.
---
Thanks dabva for your input.
---
I kind of thought already that it wasn't a hardware tuning thing.  I just haven't changed anything in that arena to cause it.
---
There are low level legendary drops, but I'd say they do become more common in end level zones. 
---
Don't be mad, be above them. You know better.
---
Gotcha, I was never in the duping crowd either, never knowingly supported it anyways, so I'm cobstantly looking for plans for stuff myself.

Those will always be a little bit of a pain. If your able to get the jump on them and target limbs it will be way easier. Focused fire 1 is enough

A Fallout 3 remaster would be very, very exciting. I know it is too early to tell for sure, but my hopes for Bethesda have risen quite a bit over the past few days lol I hope the price points are fair, assuming it is a remake of 3. If it is, and the base game is anything over $40, I would be slightly upset (unless they added lots of content). And I hope the base will come with all the main content of the game with it's expansions. Too early, I know, I know :)
---
True that. I mean I'm digging that food and water /seems/ to have a bigger role. Almost always played survival mode on previous releases so that's a big part of what made the games so enjoyable for me. I've been ambushed twice by bloatflies and ghouls simultaneously with less than twenty 10mm rounds and a base machete and I've gotten my ass kicked lol. 
---
I think you should be withing reach of clearing all quests from lv 30+. Most of it will depend on how well you know the mechanics or where to go to progress, since the missions are mostly not linear by itself. Also if you konw what is effective and have the gear to match the playstyle. But if you are new do not worry. Just play.
---
I know, it is lame. But you can find players selling them for 250-500each, so not so bad. I think that I had to replace 6 total when rebuilding mine.
---
This! Turrets have never been the greatest at being consistent. It‚Äôs by design. They idea is even they need help to properly see a target and combining them with a spotlight makes all the difference in the world. Note, not just any light will do, it has to be the spotlight under defense.
---
Do you play PS4 by any chance?
---
Or Nick valentine Detective case
---
Yes, [these](http://imgur.com/s3JfwGq)  faces, in Fallout games they are where the supernatural and power are located, IE they are in the Dunwitch building in Fallout 3, The Dunwitch borers in Fallout 4, and a few locations in Fallout 76, but they are COMPLETELY littered about in the Lucky Hole mine, and seem to form ancient shrines of some sort. I HIGHLY recommend you go to the Lucky Hole mine to see it all for yourself

Not sure if you care to be a journal completionist like I try to be but I found the first journal entry on a barrel on the right side of the main tunnel just a short distance before you enter the room with the key-only locked doors.

Does it not occur to you that perhaps Bethesda did not envision people running mules because you have to open a second client to have a second second character that you can trade with in real time? Obviously üôÑ not because some people still do this, I reckon he‚Äôll end up being band for using a third party software which is against the End User License Agreement which he would have to have used if he multi boxed.

Can you describe where it is in more detail?

BUCK BUCK BU-KAWK!

Yeah I don't use the new feature because of that endless loading screen problem.

No- Xbox

I went looking but couldn't find it

It's pretty worthwhile to do the daily and weekly challenges since most of the other atoms you can earn are mostly heavily earned in the start of the game.

Another option is Apple music or Spotify, lots of fallout playlists, and of course you can create your own.

How much for 1 shock

This exactly. After 5-10 the loot from the queen will finally show up in my inventory after grabbing it but literally every other mobs loot loads forever until it eventually shows nothing.
---
I just removed all my mutations just to lose that AR mutation. Now...trying to get them all back will be sooo much fun. Lol
---
I have a pair of X-01 legs with shocks installed I‚Äôd be willing to part with.

Glad I'm not the only one experiencing this.

I experienced that this morning, what was your solution?

I was keeping Grahm company earlier after finding him. Stuck with him for about 2 hours to let others complete the weekly challenge. Until I disconnected. RIP Grahm.

where are you on the map ? i‚Äôll send you a team invite so i can fast travel

Ahhh, grandfather! You're looking much more spritely since your recent hip (reload animation) operation!

It does, I've nuked it in various spots and it literally kills the entire server. Doesnt matter where I go to on the map, the server becomes completely unplayable

Cant read more than first line of post. But I guess because they‚Äôre full on caps.

MAXIMUM EFFORT... Great post man!

Both fallout 4 and fallout 76 have 2 styles of weapon bench. The big tall blue one and the shorter one, that looks similar to the armor bench, except no little fire barrel. Looks like you need to pay more of both of them. ;)
---
SUPER MUTANT RADIO!!!  ALL METAL ALL THE TIME BUCKETHEAD!!!
---
Nukes are not killing servers. Its all the dropped loot people ignore that kills servers. If people were picking everything up then it wouldnt be so bad. SBQueen event is different though, theres no preventing "loading loot" and you need to wait at least 2-10minutes before it all shows up. 
---
There have been some really good updates and changes. But the way it launched showed a disconnect with what a online game is or should be (and ignorance or mismanagement of feedback for engine fixes or bug gameplay stuff). That together with stories/leaks about Bethesda made some go into a circle jerk. Of course yt etc. will blow it up for the views.
---
It is sad really. I enjoy 76 but don't talk to anyone about it because few play it and the majority will just throw the same statements/jokes about the game. At the same time I will not defend 76 even though I am very pleased with the steps into the right direction. This together with the leaked placeholder product on amazon by Bethesda makes me wonder if this will ever change.
---
A lot of these songs are so old they may be in public domain.  So they could be paying nothing or next to. If that‚Äôs the case the could add old songs from past games in.

Obviously the modern songs wouldn‚Äôt apply.

very respectable, I basically just went indepth of the title post.  Thanks for th ereply

I was hoping it would spawn a 3* Mr. Ghoulsy.

There was no leak no leak of the design, but we do get a broad look of what the Sheepsquatch will look like, and it‚Äôs been right in front of us The whole time on the roadmap. http://imgur.com/xyBCgaB
---
Do let us know how many times you get hit with an orbital strike beacon
---
No problem. The dupers started the trend of not accepting caps cause they wanted more items to copy. In hope we get less and less of it, or a better way to trade item for item.
---
You've gotta finish the boot camp mission, get your soldiers degree or whatever, then follow the tedious quest chain that includes finding Defiance. I'll look it up in more detail when I get home
---
Underarmor does exactly that in 76. Each underarmor has different linings: treated, protective, shielded. 
---
The outfits are supposed to just be cosmetic though. That way you can where whatever armor you want under it.
---
They have been trying game development isn't easy
---
oh I see that sucks. I really started only noticing it like 3 weeks ago. I remember vividly seeing things like this : [Platform] H: TSE whatever W: 15000 caps
---
Now I rarely see cap numbers exceed 10000
---
I‚Äôm in right now what are you nuking ?
---
I‚Äôll check in on this when I‚Äôm back in the office Monday :) thanks for tagging!
---
How much for 1 shock ?
---
Wherever you want. I just need to complete a silo
---
Well there was a ban wave, and they reduced all items in dupers inventory to 1 and then suspended them till fix. So market is getting a little and a little better. Less dupers influence the better.
---
The inventory loading might be varying per person. I have had sqb fight with groups and randoms where some would have to wait minutes for it to appear. For me it was instant however. The quest completion has almost always had crazy delay. I have had multiple dc's at the end of the sqb fight in a row, instances where vats simply doe not work because desync I guess. Normally a queen would take tops 700 5.56 now I have to spend about 1200-1600 per fight. 
---
No, it seems to be some kind of issue or just luck that you ended up on a server by yourself. There's actually a lot of people playing fo76. More than people here might think.
---
I am SO happy we get customizable Backpacks.
---
Always loved mods that allowed us to have them in Fallout and TES games. &lt;3
---
Add the ability to buy individual songs with Atomic Points. I‚Äôd spend 300 - 600 points on Civilization, Jingle Jangle Jingle, Big Iron, Atom Bomb Baby, etc. 
---
That sounds heartbreaking. I wouldn‚Äôt want to kill that poor thing after that
---
Lol I'd gladly level their base. I've done that a few times after people done that.  I frequently use caps so I never have extra on me when I'm wanted
---
yep hopefully it gets better, not to mention increased cap storage would be nice aswell.
---
Yes; exact same issue with gatlings. As soon as i log in i'm going to test if i can swap my helmet on/off really easy.
---
If #2 is the munition factory, it‚Äôs likely the mothman will be thrown into the mix since he‚Äôs known to hang around a WWII munitions plant called the TNT area in West Virginia. 
---
I‚Äôve been attacked once, noted right out before too much got messed up. Repairing large amounts of a huge camp sucks, and I need my mats for repairs. 
---
I haven't been able to get in all morning. I get a msg that the servers are down for maint.
---
Dude, you can't honestly expect this. They haven't even fixed the base game! 
---
Unless you pay for it, you won't see sh*t
---
It's just doing what the holotapes say, mostly. You don't have options to betray the holotape, or steal its experimental data to sell to the neighboring village of holotapes to fix their wind farm, or even really just complete a quest from a holotape in more than one way.
---
The robot NPC have the same issue; they're all gonna do the same thing and don't have the ability to be interacted with to the extent that previous titles had *because the game forces them to limit their interaction and permanent consequences*

I'll never forget the first time I saw a mirelurk queen at the castle ....then just when I thought I was a safe distance away, a bunch of babies turned the damn corner and had at me.

They still scare me the most even though they've become predictable ....the noise they make just brings back PTSD of my first encounter. 
---
The best Tip: Get off this sub, and actually enjoy the game at your own pace.

This would actually be awesome, I would definitely pay more (via atoms) for additional radioactive stations or songs!

The game has always given me headset issues, I honestly just gave up on it in game and use the emotes.
---
Are you using the Home Defense perk? 
---
My experience has been similar except that my impression has been that the turrets typically have a long delay between when I perceive an attack and when they do. 
---
I think some of this is "by design" to encourage people to build in ways which both delay enemies both from getting to the player and from getting to the items they most love to destroy. Otherwise there'd be less motivation  to use stuff like flamethrower traps, locked doors, etc.
---
Oh you will gimme those drugs or I will screech Britney Spears' entire catalog at you.......GIMME THAT BUFFOUT
---
Man I‚Äôd love that. Hopefully they add iron sights tho. I loved fallout 3 but the *zoom* just wasn‚Äôt enough
---
Ah, alright! Thanks for the response, still gives a nice glimpse as to what it may look like
---
I had a wise one spawn at the base of the ski lifts leading up to top of the world. I was low level and did not realize what it was and he got shot.
---
That sounds like it makes sense. I would think (hope) the devs have thought this out before implementing it.
---
Too many bethesda dick jockeys in this sub, I‚Äôd try r/gaming
---
Phoenix microwaved fish in the break room.
---
He deserves the hate.
---
Mmmm sounds tasty 
---
I did the boot camp long ago.  I haven‚Äôt searched the Fort even though I have been to it.
---
only perk affecting railway rifle is the balistic ammo weight reduction and bloody mess for 15% dmg
---
My wife and I were wearing Camdem Park Uniforms at Camden Park, and I found an "Amusement Park Worker Outfit" (or something like that) laying on a shelf. I noticed it looked the same as the CPU, but instead of purple stripes, it had red. I got excited, snatched it up, and threw it on, only to realize it's identical to the CPU....different name, different color in inventory preview picture. Same clothes on the character
---
I don't trust clothes anymore lol
---
I'll definitely be dropping by when I get home. How long will you be online? I need several sets of power armor.
---
This is awesome
---
I had one time but not on SBQ. Everything I killed after queen loaded for 15-20 min. Did horde event, boss loot was lost since meat pile must have stuck underground or in wall... i manage to drop a two shot weapon which I had to wait 15 min before being able to pick up, lol. About 30 min after queen kill server went back to ‚Äùnormal‚Äù. 
---
If you think about the setting tho it makes sense. All the enemies are super mutants, ghouls, scorched. Those *were* the human‚Äôs. You know? Those enemies *are* the West Virginia population. 
---
I will agree that I wish some of the people we have look for were still alive tho. Instead it‚Äôs just ‚Äúwell we have to go loot another dead body‚Äù 
---
How do you get that cool Enclave thing beside your name?
---
All the codes where redeemed already(not by me)
---
My camp is hobo-grade for that reason. 
---
Well that's just balls and ass! Good thing I'm not emotionally invested in this "collection" lol.
---
I am! I also have a number of things I can do to make your BoS look a little more complete
---
T60 BoS paint
---
BoS Combat Armor
---
Engineer‚Äôs outfit
---
T60
---
There are also two bowler hats. I didn't notice any difference.
---
Basically this: 
---
https://m.uk.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Defiance_Has_Fallen
---
You've gotta get the quest chain to initiate at Abbie's Bunker which starts Defiance Has Fallen, find the fort, then go through the DMV quest. It's stupid, and we should be able to get an official military ID by doing the basic training quest then going to the DMV and doing that. Defiance doesn't have to even be mentioned; there should be a quest after Basic Training to go and get your military ID.
---
Should the railway rifles be affected by the rifleman perk though? Or is it unknown 
---
Same. Thought was my PC. Rebooted , still not on. 
---
This would drive attention away from Fallout 76, so not likely, but still hype.
---
Totally agree, should be like the GTA map, laziness not the dev part. Some parts are live, like the mission where you chasing the cargobot, you can clearly see if moving across the map. I also noticed if a nuke zone ends, it disappears off the map, but most of the map is not live and it could easily be. Maybe one day it will be
---
Fairly sure it wsnt in fallout 4 either
---
Haha I can‚Äôt kill a few mirelurks, that would be a nightmare! Been using the same .308 rifle for 10 levels now but the critters keep getting tougher...
---
I had a collection going when I first started, but I gave it up once I realized how much some of these outfits sell for, and I only rotate between 3. Now I pick up all cosmetics to sell, the common high value ones I keep an eye out for are the golf outfit, golf skirt, and ranger outfit!
---
if they learn from the division's survival i'd be delighted. running for warmth is such a fun mechanic. 
---
That happened to me also.. Shitty ass "patched" game
---
I‚Äôll add you when I get home around 7 pm central time.
---
Luck + location 
---
Maybe a supporting character that is CHA-based? Really all depends on what style she finds better suited.
---
No prime receiver is worth it on any gun. The hardened receiver out preforms in every instance. 
---
Before the game launched there was a massive BoS clan that had plans to do just that. Unfortunately a couple of the high ranking members were neo-nazis :s
---
But I did understand. And like I said it seems that the items were moved from your stash and into the paper bag for you to collect as they are quest items not meant to be stored.
---
In this sub, click your name and click change flair. üëçüèª
---
Probably a lot of the day today, I should be able to get you set up
---
Well crap I hope they fix it soon.  I wanna try to launch a nuke at the queen.
---
If people think lesser of you for liking the game they‚Äôre the wrong people to associate with, we‚Äôre all individuals and we all like different things and if your having a good time that‚Äôs all that matters. At launch I bought a FO76 T-Shirt and I still wear it with pride because I really couldn‚Äôt give a rats a$$ what anyone else thinks of my tastes in games and never will, what I choose to spend my money on is my own business, always has been, some people hate on this game so hard it‚Äôs a wonder they don‚Äôt give themselves indigestion lol. I‚Äôve had my frustrations with some of the bugs along the way but no game is perfect. Try not to let these people bother you. When I see vids coming up in my YouTube suggestions with ridiculous titles and twisted truths about games I just laugh laugh at these click-baiters and move on, life‚Äôs too short for anything else
---
Maybe nuka world, automatron and the building DLCs  were dissapointing and/or bad but i felt like far harbor was quite good
---
Turd!!!!!
---
‚ÄúLetting their impatience waste time and caps‚Äù this guy is a fool.
---
Adrenal reaction is a focal point of any low health build and it is hardly impatient to choose not to wait 3 weeks till the next patch for me to be able to play a non-gimped character.
---
When you can acquire serums for 200 caps from loads of ppl on any trading post, at most you‚Äôre likely out around 1-2 days worth of hopping every vendor for caps.
---
1-2 days of vendor hopping to be able to actually use my toon over the next 3 weeks, that‚Äôs hardly impatient.
---
You also mentioned wasting time, and that‚Äôs exactly what making a million posts about it being broken is doing. They know it‚Äôs broke, nothing you do now will make them fix it any faster, trust me.
---
So how about you stop being impatient and wasting time with dumb posts and go take some initiative and fix it your damn self.
---
Yeah, it gets easier. I find that saving your ammo and using melee as yoir primary helps. Im usually a guns blazing kind of character, but for this game melee seems like the way to go, for me at least. The hoards havent been as bad since then either, but i usually play with my wife and another friend so it could be that as well. 
---
"Mount Blair - The location of this pin-point is where you find TNT Dome Key 2, the key that lets you into a bunker to the left of Vault 76, where you can find an alien life-form in a cryopod and alien blaster rounds. Of course, this is another alien clue. It is connect to a picture of a cryptid."  
---
I was there last night and got creeped out when the skeleton. which still has muscle tissue attached, moved its hand/arm.
---
I totally understand that it makes sense.  I just get some kind of dystopian murmur or something and drift off to games with more colour or life.  It‚Äôs more of a tough acceptance than a flaw as I personally think the game is done pretty damn great.  It‚Äôs a contention that I feel keeps me from playing the game for extended periods. 
---
Just the cap amount of the bounty. I would advise against it though as he can seek revenge and kill you and collect caps equal to your level. Meaning you will be negative caps. 
---
Thanks! I'll post a few more pics here after a bit
---
Every one of my workers shoot Phoenix on sight, I prefer it that way.
---
Oh was there a scheduled maintenance for today?
---
Cool thanks
---
&gt; The hate is overblown, amplified by YouTubers looking for views, and concentrated in online forums like Reddit
---
haha, overblown?  The game is 50% off after only 3.5 months.  This game tanked on release.  And they have not been doing a great job with all of their "fixes".  Even with the game bombing, the amount of user drop off since they started nerfing has been very noticeable.   
---
Eh, depends. Its like 50/50 for me. Im either in a server with a few people (less than 10) or it's practically full and majority of the players are for the most part new.(lvl under 30). I think the time your on  also plays a big factor.
---
Semi is better in both damage and vats/crit as well as ammo consumption. 
---
u/jakedpotatoes
---
I remember in the weeks leading up to launch there was a lot of hype and discussion regarding the idea of players contesting nuke silos, which I think just never really happened because the current systems don't totally allow for it. Here's hoping the inclusion of Slap/Full PvP servers kind of revives the idea.
---
Yeah I tend not to engage in PvP / wanted - hense pacafist, but wanted the achievements..  
---
I've logged out now - can he claim revenge at any time or is it session limited?
---
BUT ME?! UH-HUH-HUH-HUH, I HAVE TO HOLD 'EM TO KISS 'EM!
---
:(
---
That's fair, I wonder if we will show stars or skulls if we rank up enough?!
---
It is, but im in for the long con lol
---
He can‚Äôt seek revenge now once one person hops servers it ends
---
I need to use melee but it would cut my dps in half and burn more stimpacks... I may be forced anyway though!
---
&gt; You also mentioned wasting time, and that‚Äôs exactly what making a  million posts about it being broken is doing. They know it‚Äôs broke,  nothing you do now will make them fix it any faster, trust me. 
---
No shit you twit, that's the whole reason I wasted my fucking time to say people should be reporting this shit directly to Betehsda instead of whining here.
---
It's the cultist shrines scattered around the map for me....someone at Bethesda is a sick fuck
---
Because it was released in a broken and unpolished state. Rushed out as a quick cash grab. Majority reused assets from Fallout 4, which is another issue entirely because the setting is different for each game, yet you have new assets (which some of them are amazing) right next to old FO4 assets which look poorly placed by comparison, not only in detail but aesthetics.
---
Ehh another case with valentine? Unless it gave like a good amount of lore on the guy not the synth (since he doesnt exist yet) and a really good reason as to why a case in WV while hes in boston at the time instead, i'd feel as though a new detective would be better
---
I can finally finish my pool room haha
---
I was never able to get more than a few hours into FO3 due to persistent CTDs. I'd love to play a version that looks nicer, plays a bit nicer, and doesn't crash every 20m in urban areas. :-p
---
xboner lol.  Starting to miss my PC days, especially with all the new options for controllers and whatnot.  Just had Hotas variations and SNES style gamepads by in my day... god I'm getting old.
---
Easiest way to test awareness shows enemies health and armor rating or just by the prima guide with all the enemy health and armor ratings
---
It‚Äôd be an addition 20% damage after initial explosion. Two shot got reduced from+100% to +20%
---
ok
---
Define "acceptable"? I guess any bug is unacceptable, but bugs happen. If they had to bring the servers down for a hotfix every time anybody finds a bug, nobody would ever get to play. 
---
You're right. Far Harbor is the only one I liked.
---
Get starched genes... That is the only way
---
When loading into a server it sometimes drops a misc item for whatever reason. You can't interact with it and it will not be removed from inventory afaik.
---
Dude! Showed you a sneak peek of my shop the other day on discord
---
Alright. I‚Äôm just bummed, I want to have a viable high level build without the normal weapons people use
---
Equipping the Starched genes perk before taking a radaway.
---
No man's sky did better, nothing in there looks all that amazing.
---
Not to say that I'm not happy, but honestly it should if launched with half of this roadmap content.
---
I totally blanked on hiding the UI lol
---
I integrated a small shotgun package into my build for scorchbeasts. One rank of each damage perk and enforcer. I use an AAE combat shotgun. I eat level 80 scorchbeasts and clear the golf clubhouse in seconds. 
---
I know, I recognized the Thumbnail. Good job by the way. Lil Rico would be proud
---
Thanks for the tip. I was just stating the obvious. The game is poorly executed, buggy, and tedious. The environmental storytelling is great. I would just like to be able to explore and delve for longer than five minutes without the enemy respawning because someone else ran by and kept going, and now I'm stuck in a corner with 15 mobs I ALREADY killed earlier.
---
I should be able to explore indefinitely without interruption after I've killed everything in the area. Simple concept.
---
What if im only level 27..I think starch genes is later? This on my alt 
---
The sunkissed(?) perk will heal your rad damage during the day without affecting you mutations.
---
Diluted radaway is still a risk, though not nearly as much as the full.
---
No, thank you! Have a good weekend!
---
Just throw on a suit of power armor to negate fall damage. 
---
Dammit, I literally opened the thread to post this and you suck.... wonderfully so.  Have an upvote.
---
yeah they spawn on most, if not all the suits you find exploring if I am not mistaken . So keep track of where you find em and server hop and go around collecting their cores. You can also power up a power plant, they can produce 8 cores an hour  
---
Yeah, assuming FO3 remaster would just be the game with graphical tune-ups, I'd hope it wouldn't go higher than $40, as while both 3 and NV are great games, they haven't aged very well imo, and pricing a remaster of either/or higher than $40 would feel way too pricey (and even 40 is pushing it, but it'd be comparable to other remasters, and both games are older than Skyrim, whose remaster was $60 at launch). All platforms is exciting though if it's 3, since that means I'd get to play it on the go with the Switch.
---
What level is sunkissed available?
---
Nice.
---
Only some areas do that but they tend to scale to who was there first
---
Ah perfect, look at all the anger he has after I made him look like the fool he is, just perfect :).
---
If you are in the forest,that generally won‚Äôt happen 
---
Adrenal reaction isn‚Äôt working for me at all, I don‚Äôt use CF3 but I do have rejuvenated 2 so I might try swapping that out to see what happens
---
Just get used to having rads. Get some good mutations and perks that benefit having low health and high rads.
---
You can try and find someone that has the starched genes perk and ask if they can team up with you. They need at least 6 charisma to share 2 cards (rank 2 of starched genes is guaranteed to keep your mutations) 
---
&gt; solo playing
---
My advice: don't.
---
True, I‚Äôve heard consoles in general still have major performance issues that just aren‚Äôt a problem on PC
---
Is it the treasure maps that get you the plans? I‚Äôve been doing all the cranberry bog missions and so far only have one t60 leg and I want the whole set! 
---
Do you stink up on intelligence before crafting? Does it make a significant difference on condition? What‚Äôs the limit? 
---
I was on a team last night and someone had rad sponge it was the best thing ever..doesn't get rid of mutation
---
Excellent!
---
Ahhh I might have messed up in posting the map somehow, sorry about that, and thank you so much for the info.  My husband is especially excited about the breweries you listed, we‚Äôll try to check out as many of them as we can while we‚Äôre there for sure!  
---
IIRC dying also works, but I'm not big on mutations so that's second-hand.
---
I'm not a base builder and I'd do this just to spice up my camp, especially if the weight of those displays is unique and not added to my stash.  Weapon displays would become vital and not just pretty.
---
I'd also love to have the armor mannequins and power armor display racks like Fallout 4 allowed us.
---
Aah that makes way more sense, thanks :) 
---
If you have a friend and you share the perk radsponge (either one of you can have it) and you have it fully leveled (maybe you don‚Äôt need it fully leveled) it won‚Äôt take away the mutation but I‚Äôll take away the rads for both of you. My bf and I do it 
---
There was so much info, though. The E3 presentation, a freaking making of documentary, extensive interviews, released footage. Bethesda definitely went against their normal secret squirrel approach, and spelled it all out. There was constant chatter about it in the gaming-sphere.
---
Do you craft PA pieces or just have collected some?
---
that works too. As well as that other perk someone else mentioned that gets rid of rads in the sun.
---
The world has plenty of people who aren't interested in accuracy, fairness, or even being respectful of others. The internet just happens to be a place where people like that can go and have more or less no social consequences when they act up.
---
All you can do is find new social groups who are positive or try to persuade them to chill out... which isn't likely to happen, hehe. 
---
Is rad shower a risk?
---
Me too. Loot and dropout. There are sooooo many meat piles for everyone and nobody clears them because the mobs only drop junk. Server is almost unplayable post queen fight.
---
Or how about you just stop farming the same fucking place on the map over and over until you quit the game and actually go out and explore, it‚Äôs a big world out there ya know, why sit around in 1 spot complaining about that 1 spot.
---
I think most spots are farmed pretty heavily. But you can always get one out of armor spawns
---
You can always take power station workshops. I was running tortuga(? Whatever it is) and poseidon both last night, and ended up with 30+ in a couple hours. The power up events can be a pain, so I usually just plunk down a fusion gen. and skip the power up.
---
I‚Äôm a ways away from a strong build but great to know. I need to try vats. I‚Äôm a huge sniper and shotgun fan so excited to keep progressing 
---
I know the feeling. First console was Atari 2600. Well if you ever get on PC (and I recommend you do) hit me up. I moved from XBOX 360 to PC and never looked back. Think of it like a customizable console. Hell, I play all my games with a 360 controller.
---
I just updated that and I'm still having the same issues. I even went as far as removing all my mod files and reinstalling them. My custom archive list looks like this.  
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2, etc.  
---
Is there something I'm missing?
---
I believe so, Its a lot like rad away in that regard from everything Ive heard about it. I havent tested it myself so I dont know if its 100% safe.
---
I like how it teases what I am guessing is a sheepsquatch 
---
It's gotten much better. When it first launched (after beta) I would get thrown off a server once a hour. Now it's once a week. 
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre a bit low level for your quest progress IMO. I feel like the intent is you hit 50 sometimes around when you are wrapping up the final quest; that‚Äôs how my progress on my first character was and it all felt pretty ‚Äúright‚Äù
---
I sniped Wise with one bullet, before learning he was a stat buff.
---
Come here again after a few days later.
---
with Powersmith active while making armor, it crafts at 160%
---
With Fix It Good active, I can repair already damaged armor to 200%
---
Unfortunately I don't always have someone to play with! 
---
You're the fool spending time, effort and caps reapplying mutations while all I have to do is live a week or two with the HUGE DEBILITATING OH GOD WHY MUST I LIVE ON WITH THIS SUFFERING loss of having to shoot shit one or two more times to make up for the loss in damage.
---
You're as bad as the drama queens threatening Bethesda that this bug threatens to lose them all of their remaining players.
---
Hmm, I maybe should have paid more attention to where I was finding suits!
---
Thanks :)
---
Why? I played the whole game solo and thought it was great. Can go at your own pace and no one to come in and snatch items from areas you're in.
---
My advice is early on use your camp as a forward base. Put it down and explore all the areas around it, then move on and place your camp again and repeat. 
---
Don't rush, if you clear the areas and explore a lot you will always be overleveled a bit making it easier to kill enemies. 
---
For power cores take over a workshop with a fusion core generator. You will need the fusion generator item to power it , which you get for doing a power up power plant quest. They will create like 7 cores a hour or something so you can do that when you log in and have plenty of cores.
---
Take advantage of sneaking especially when you don't have on power armor for extra damage and not pulling whole groups of enemies.
---
I don't need the screws
---
I have a kid so only get to play at night. During her naps or if she‚Äôs playing with friends I like to browse Reddit. 
---
I‚Äôve started doing that recently. It bugs me that I still get the fo4 spotlight glitch (where the turret still moves and is powered but is not lit)
---
I‚Äôve tried putting it on switches and power counters which keep it moving but doesn‚Äôt always get the light back on.
---
this is why i gave up on turrets long ago.  they take too much budget and rarely do any thing other than alert me to enemies if i am at CAMP.  totally useless.
---
I think you have it wrong. IMO the sub numbers were dropping because a lot of people were sick of the cynicism and lazy trolls that sometimes come in here. As the numbers steadily fell off (in small amounts), the number of subs for Filthy Casuals was increasing steadily. Pretty sure people were just abandoning this place for a more positive, fun environment. 
---
Just my view, but hope is good either way. 
---
Thx!!! I got speed demon by accident (walking near blast zone without my suit) and then I fell in love..I'm gonna get the recipe 
---
Nah, developers/writers love when we work this shit out.  Why else include it?
---
Is that easy enough to do at my level &amp; playing by myself.
---
 I think the last time I attempted this I got ambushed by much higher players and they kind of put me off attempting it again!
---
Starts at level 45 :)
---
Good, because I thought it was the dumbest idea ever... 
---
Run to the whitespring, second floor. Vendor bubbles, nuka grape to remove rads
---
160% condition? Whoa! 
---
Does intelligence matter as well? 
---
Ive got that and healing factor, Im Deadpool!
---
I've been experiencing that but intermittently. 
---
At whitesprings I‚Äôve found in the back of those brown vans to be 1 fusion core every time 
---
Pal, there are tons of weapons that will 1 shot you in power armor or kill you almost instantly.
---
If you want to survive in survival mode I would highly recommend you start working on a PvP set of sentinel/cavalier regular armor.
---
I think you get starched genes around lvl 32 or so. I just lost all my mutations at lvl 22 trying to get rid of that broken Adrenal Reaction, Egg Head, and Hard Mentality.
---
I can imagine you franticly trying to get the right angle before they start dissapearing.
---
If a whole suit is 300 caps, how much are fusion cores?  I'll be there in a flash.
---
Hopefully they start opening up new dungeon areas For the new content. All those caved in mine entrances were a bit disappointing when first encountered, for example. The indoor areas in this game are nicely done. The burning mines make me feel like I crossed over into ESO. They need a Dwemer Easter egg somewhere.
---
One reason I enjoy playing by myself is because there's no pressure and I'm just free to go about at my own pace! However I am open to teaming up with someone more experienced and leveled to maybe guide me a little, I know I've reached level 32 fine but I still feel like a bit of a noob and a little lost/overwhelmed sometimes.
---
I think I said in another comment that last time I tried to take over a workshop I was ambushed by higher level players and it put me off attempting it again.
---
Thank you very much for your detailed response and taking time to help me. I appreciate all the help I can get! :)
---
Hey, I found this video on youtube and it helped out a lot. You just have to try going there periodically because sometimes they have already been looted, but for the most part, I've stored up around 15 cores over the past 2 days from doing this off and on.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2\_Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2_Og)
---
They did, but Bethesda was supposed to provide the QA. There's been some stink over that because apparently the QA they provided wasn't great, and they had a deal with Obsidian to give the studio a bonus if the game hit a certain meta rating... which it missed by like 1 point. And we can safely assume that 1 point rested on the many bugs the game was released with. 
---
I haven't 100% confirmed this story so take it with a grain of salt. But I think stories like this are why some people have been waiting so long to hate on Bethesda, hah.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the pipe bolt action doesn‚Äôt have any legendary variants. But it does benefit from both rifleman and pistol mods unless it got fixed. Hunting rifles are just better for end game more dmage, legendary variants, has the option to be changed to.50cal so ammo is super easy to make. 
---
No prob! May mothman be with you
---
Why do you care about other people's opinions? It's surely better to just play and enjoy the game. 
---
Cuz distributors pay. Why do you think we don't see many indie games
---
Yes!!!! Forgot about this!!!
---
It‚Äôs parasites bruh. If you have speed demon it‚Äôll b horrid
---
Nope. The only place I rubber band is the Whitesprings interior, where all the shops are. Pretty much every single time I enter it will rip me back to the entrance once I've taken a few steps. It's strangely consistent and doesn't seem to be about server performance. Possibly it's being caused by a bug.
---
Level 35 and you‚Äôve completed the queen 5 times. In other words you were carried through the queen event 5 times. I hope you didn‚Äôt get the loot. It‚Äôs noobs like you making it harder for the people that should actually be there. Stay the hell out of there till you can properly contribute.
---
I play solo mostly, and recently started a new character for fun. My main suggestions are stealth and knowing when to run away. I made it to Watoga by foot at lvl 7 with no deaths just by being careful. Sure you miss alot of xp but at certain levels you dont belong in certain areas and cant survive a fight. Watoga is also a good place for cores as theres several spawns in that town. You may just have to deal with the robots. Also dont be afraid to tail higher level players most people are still happy to help others. As long as you know your limitations the only difficult things to solo in this game are silos(though many people can solo them) and the queen. Everything else is very doable solo if youre prepared. 
---
I've tried this, and it's bad.   Don't pick up any junk until you have recovered your lost junk.  Dying with even 1 junk in your pocket replaces your other one, and it's gone forever.
---
Roughly 2 weeks away. Boo hoo. After that the content will flow relatively steadily.
---
No. And there are plenty of people here to help you along, if needed
---
Everybody is a noob at some time. For any game, if you ever want to know something just google it or ask or search a forum. There's usually plenty of info available to help anyone get a grasp on things.
---
I felt so bad for the panicking cat I shot with that thing. I really wished we had a "pet the kitty" action because he just kept yelling he was scared. :-/
---
I primarily play PS4, but if they brought FO3 up to FO4 graphics standards it would be an insta buy for PC.  I've been watching Wanderers Ultra Modded PS4 playthroughs and its freaking BEAUTIFUL.
---
Okay thank you.
---
As a non-console gamer - my reaction to this was 'wait - there are Hotwheels in the game?'
---
https://hotwheels.mattel.com/shop
---
I think Nuka Grape from The whitesprings. Or the fountain
---
Ha. "As low as 300" = Raider level 15
---
I don't have a set price for fusion cores, but I'd probably do 25 caps for a 100% charge one
---
My best guess is that anything PVP-related is going to arrive with Survival Mode. They may not have mentioned it because it could be undergoing changes.
---
You're either with us or against us.
---
I'd prefer if he wasn't, scares the crap out of me 
---
The fountain gets rid of rads too?
---
I think the rads stay
---
Might just bbe disease. Can‚Äôt remember. The grape is solid though
---
Not a bad price for an armor work bench either...
---
Yeah I kno it cures disease but I craft a ton of disease cures
---
Thumbs up!  Great content for the sub :)
---
Would I struggle much solo as a noob?
---
Currently I can only make full Ultracite, Excavator, and X-01. I can make a piece each of T45 and T60, and farming plans for those is my main focus right now
---
Yeah... Alright Bethesda marketing team... We believe you. No one's THAT naive. The never ending bugs, the lack of content, overall uselessness of Dev team. The roadmap is six months of maybe... A few hours content? Most of which will surely break the game time and time again. Why don't you wait for an actual release of something before you get your hopes up.
---
Ah brilliant, usually there are high level enemies there so I'll need to try sneaking in and out and hope for the best!
---
Thanks for the reply! 
---
1000 caps
---
Exactly what happened to me yesterday. The queen‚Äôs loot took minutes to load then other enemies‚Äô loot simply loop arrows forever. I got frustrated and left. 
---
I mean, how do you betray a holotape? Most of the time it's just giving you an indicator "there's loot here, plus you can learn more about what happened while you were in the Vault."
---
Now, you've got a point about the robot NPCs having limited responses. I'd like to see more options there. But the core story, you're either going to follow it or you're going to go off on a tangent. There's really no way to "betray" things other than "nah, I'm not going to investigate the Scorched plague."
---
Thank you very much! I'll have a watch :) 
---
Ok I be on in a bit
---
Sounds good just lmk
---
It's gotten harder, but I still rarely have workshops contested (except for munitions, that place has become a madhouse). It's risky, but it's also the easiest way to get cores. Just stash all your junk before hand, and make sure to lock the core generator.
---
It can be tough at your level to defend from 50+, but if you find yourself on a quite server, go for it.
---
If your on XB, you can hit me up when I'm on. I don't use PA outside of SBQ events, so you can have some.
---
Also, you can be in a team, and still play solo. I've worked out mutual defense deals between players before to share resources.
---
These kind of issues, that affect peoples entire playstyle and build, are a big problem. Many people will just quietly stop playing. Move on to some other game. I haven't have the motivation to even log in for days. I'm kind of just waiting for some new game.
---
What's you gt
---
Scottjowitt
---
Well, at least I'm not crazy.  So, y'know, there's that. 
---
If I remember it right it‚Äôs possible to get Ultracite plans in Defiance now, right? Do you have Excavator calibrated shocks?
---
I don't think so honestly. Just look up some stuff on google. Figure things out as you go along. There's not really that much of a steep learning curve.
---
Explain healing factor please 
---
Yeah man, I just finished that mission, lvl 45 Casual and it was brutal.  First time I ever did grinding was for ammo after trying it twice before, and I still ended swallowing a river of Boiled Water for healing.  Good luck, Ad Victoriam!
---
lol looks like you got the camp decorating update early :) i wish i could decorate my camp with dead stuff
---
Thank you for the reply! 
---
I've not had much luck with tailing/interacting with higher level players so I kind of just avoid anyone higher than me.
---
My approach is usually 'Leeroy Jenkins' approach, I should really try and sneak more and be a little more stealthy! 
---
The first 10 levels are probably the hardest, but if you stay in your area and level up which will take a while, it will be fun and fine. Once you start going east or south or north, it will get increasing difficult. But rest assured as you level up you become much stronger, so as long as you play and be patient you will be just fine, a lot of start as solo and continue to play solo just fine. It's noobs that jump into high level areas that they can't handle that struggle a lot.
---
What would be in there?
---
Expired cake
---
300% healing out of combat -25% effectiveness of healing items (I think its 25%, might be more)
---
It‚Äôs almost 18lbs. !
---
Love u 5eva
---
it also heals broken limbs
---
Lolz 
---
That pretty much summarizes my past experience lolz
---
Yeah I play on Xbox, I have never played with anyone I don't know in person who usually want to just quest altogether 
---
 I'm too scared to approach strangers! Ha
---
The truth is out there.
---
That belongs to more https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout
---
Just a week or two eh, I lived with it for about a hour, but enjoy the three weeks of losing 30% of your damage if you play a low health build.
---
And yes a 30% loss of damage is debilitating, it means I will use 30% more ammo, combat will take up 30% more of my time, oh wait what‚Äôs that? Dmg effects armor penetration and it‚Äôs effectively more of a difference than 30% less dmg? Yes genius, you have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre talking about. You probably don‚Äôt even play a low health build and if you don‚Äôt why the fuck are you even talking about this, and if you are, then learn more about your build because it‚Äôs a lot bigger of a detriment than you seem to realize.
---
Like I said before, 2 days of vendor hopping for the caps was well worth being able to play a non-gimped character for the next 3 weeks. 1 hour of time VS playing handicap for dozens of hours. Doesn‚Äôt take a much more than a 5 year old to get that logic.
---
True tbh
---
I would seriously doubt it, Late For Dinner. It just doesn't seem right.
---
Well its pretty much only tied to what kind of build you have, you can get decent dmg with just regular guns. Sneak attack dmg can boost dmg by 2.5 and adrenal reaction mutation makes a big difference when running a low health build and a bloodied melee. 
---
Are you dumb? First of all, I have a bloodied sledgehammer legendary. I can literally kill level 68 monsters as if I'm the same level as them. plus, I have charisma perks to heal teammates, reduce rads, and even reduce damage output.... keeping them alive and reviving them. So how about you stop assuming and start thinking? 
---
I always keep a vampire combat knife on me. It‚Äôs fast and can regen health pretty well if I get to low health using main weapon. Quick swap and once health is back up, the. back to main weapon.
---
This is really cool. 
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone is being forced to create a new character. Actually I‚Äôve heard you can port your existing ones and it‚Äôs gear over.
---
You take trades or discounts on collected -60 parts? Trying to assemble first suit at lvl 25. 
---
Have several empty power suits as well. 
---
I think it happens if you have the materials split between your personal inventory and stash. Try moving all the mats to your stash and vice versa. Hope this works. Good luck.
---
T-posing ghouls is still happening.
---
Was semi rewarding becuase once I launched the nuke on fissure site prime i realized I could never beat the scorchqueen. 
---
Get a usb headset it makes things so much easier when playing.
---
I played the game blind (without watching any vids or reading online tips). Most of the time I was just exploring different areas of the vast map while leveling up. By the time I decided to do some of the quests in order to have access to certain gear (such as x01 and ultracite armors), I was already approving level 100 and picked up some pretty powerful weapons in the process. The quests such as BOTB was hard but not unmanageable, I did it all solo. So from my experience don‚Äôt rush to complete all the quests, just enjoy the journey and grow as you go. Next thing you know the deathclaws and mirelurk queens aren‚Äôt that powerful any more. I‚Äôve been playing the game strictly as a first person shooter so I haven‚Äôt even used VATS in the battles. 
---
Visual bug. If it's powered it's working, whether the light actually shows or not
---
Where are you located on the map?
---
You better have a grill for the tailgate party.
---
I‚Äôm looking for a max level raider left arm. Do you have one?
---
If they actually follow this sucker then I'm willing to reinstall and get back behind this game.   
---
My gut feeling was that Bethesda was going to abandon this garbage fire. But if instead, in order to restore fans' faith in the company, they're going to work to put the fire out, fix it up, and turn it into a decent game. Well then I'll happily get back on board and admit that I was wrong.   
---
I want to be wrong, and I don't mean that in a cynical, "haha I'm only saying this to be witty" way. No, I want to be wrong about that gut response. So fingers are crossed.   
---
One aside though. Am I the only one who thinks that the whole "Wastelanders" expansion for the fall sounds like they might be finally adding  a real main quest and NPCs? I mean I kinda got that vibe from the little bit of info they revealed about it.   
---
Hope I'm not just being overly optimistic here. 
---
If you find yourself struggling in the early game, investing in Endurance Perks - like those that quell/quench hunger and thirst - is helpful. You can always respec later in the Game once you find your footing.    
---
The Game itself can be overwhelming at first but there is a lot of content on this sub and online to answer any questions you have.
---
I did the same. Keep a ski sword or blade of Bastet or miner gauntlet handy.
---
But it does the same damage as the hardened receiver and that's before the bonus damage.
---
That dmg you do back is after your resistance. So if they do slap dmg to you your doing half slap back. Or you roll Tesla and fry everything near you. I'll take constant aoe dps over maybe a little riposte.
---
Wow thanks for the tip!  I'm one lurking double checking my meat piles and bodies for like 5 mins after a mob session.  
---
I'm avoiding that one like the plague. ONLY EA would take the premier single-player RPG developer in the industry right now, and order them to build a Destiny clone. I mean...what the hell? 
---
There‚Äôs also one in the top of Tanagra Town which is east of Harpers Ferry.
---
As a long time dan if BioWare since I was a kid...  I don‚Äôt even want to talk about that... 
---
I think the "hate" is deserved. The game didn't feel completed when it was released, Bethesda screwed up so many real world tie-ins related to 76 and people that wanted refunds on PC had a hard time getting them if they even got them at all just to name a few things. Most of the people that criticize 76 are people that want it to be good but are objective enough to not be blinded by the fact that they like or did like BGS.
---
It's fine to like a bad game but to say you can't understand why a game you like is considered by most to be bad probably mean you are not objective enough to see it's flaws even when they are apparent.
---
Personally I think 76 is pretty bad considering Bethesda's track record. They have done plenty of Fallouts and they did a MMO with ESO so they have at least some experience to make 76 work but they fell short.  With that said I still play 76 because I find some enjoyment in it.
---
If no one gave it criticism then it probably would never have been improved as much as it has.
---
Try to avoid your desire to venture all over the map. In the early Game, staying in the Forrest Region is helpful for learning the ropes and getting survival experience. There is plenty to and explore there. If you find yourself struggling with enemies, head North West. Enemies NW are easiest and they typically get harder as you venture South East
---
Oh god I was just minding my own business yesterday and he showed up and I tried fleeing because I didn‚Äôt have the resources to kill him, but I was over encumbered so he just kept killing me and following me
---
Yeah Destiny whenever it does that shows signs of an identity crisis.
---
Found a plan today in the basement of the capitol building üòÅ
---
Lost all hope for the game by lvl 30 lol what? You barely even played the game.
---
Nah, Fallout 76 is selling rather well.  They just fucked up by releasing a quarter too early.  Shoulda realeased in January without the exploits and bugs, then dropped this map shortly after.  Some executive fucked up trying to get his Q4 bonus by dropping the game before Christmas season and ended up losing money and hurting Bethesdas rep.  Typical problem with high level management compensation.
---
BACKPACKS BACKPACKS
---
I‚Äôll have my backpack loaded up with things to drink and chew
---
If you‚Äôre low on ammo then I‚Äôll have some packed for you
---
Backpacks backpacks
---
YEAH
---
Yea that was shortly after a nuke zone dissipated. But those are not supposed to be single person, especially low level persons, events or quests. I understand whitesprings can spawn low level ghouls too but to say it is a problem that a lvl 20 cant take on a hoard of max glowing ones...that's kind of silly. 
---
What if I run out of quest for the forest region?
---
thanks for your time and response!
---
I hope they do SOMETHING cool with the Crashed Space Station. I'll be honest, one of the things that hurt my opinion of the developers and made me think the game was rushed and unfinished was that location. It's such a cool idea and...it's nothing. Just a wreck on the ground with nothing special in or around it. No aliens, no killer robots, nothing. Super letdown.   
---
So I really hope they do something cool with it. 
---
Awesome find.
---
Here's a blown-up version of the map for anyone having trouble:

Man I'm doing the exact same, it just doesn't feel like fallout without a bathtub full of cash and one full of pool balls
---
Was expecting it to just be the normal roadmap but upside down
---
He turned up at Whitespring today in the Nuke Zone. All those times he startled me and finally... the tables turned. I was carrying a Fatman.
---
Well.  At this point I add a month to each date, assuming it's that long before two 'fix' patchs make it playable.  But I'm still excited.
---
Played enough to get the general gist that the game was buggy and rushed, and I didn‚Äôt really feel like continuing
---
You're right no one will believe you. No believes any of us. The people patrolling these posts and down voting us are either die hard Bethesda boys or Bethesda employees themselves I think. 
---
Even with all the existing bugs this game is so much fun and highly replayable. I learned some tips when I read people‚Äôs posts (just joined reddit not long ago) and keep trying them myself. Yesterday I decided to go full postal with just an axe, lo and behold i was able to hack a level 80 SB to death in less than a minute. The loot still sucked but the game is just incredibly fun. 
---
I've played solo for 90% of the game, so I understand. Events are about the only thing I team up for. Still, even if it's just help taking and building defenses for a workshop, you can shoot me a message, GT is same as ID. 
---
I wouldn't worry about people in game, the vast majority I've met are very nice.
---
A few tips. 
---
Guides to farming certain materials, where to find them etc. 
---
How to make Excavator Power Armor at level 25 (you can also make it again at 35 and 45) that will give you +100 carry weight. 
---
How to make caps selling to all the vendors and cap stash locations. 
---
Don't do Mayor for a Day Watoga quest until level 50 if you want to get a good level 50 legendary melee weapon All Rise.
---
There are a lot of guides and YouTube videos and posts on forums etc. that will help if you ever need to know something.
---
A looooong fickin time.
---
What‚Äôd I miss at lunch time?
---
And play it if you enjoy it, simple as that. I had a very poor experience with it and thus don‚Äôt play it anymore and am a lil cheesed about wasting my money, and many others seem to have had a similar experience. However if you are enjoying it, then good for you. Too many people forget games are just games 
---
How long did it take yours?
---
Luv is a 4 letter word
---
I have not! Can you reply or DM some pictures or a text transcription?
---
Fallout 76 takes place before Maxson turned the organization's west coast "help everybody" commune into a xenophobic kill squad.  They wouldn't bother with mothmen at this time or any other creatures that aren't a direct threat.  Then again, they shouldn't be in West Virginia either, the airships sending the "help everybody" offshoot movement hasn't even started to take root and at the point in time 76 takes place the Brotherhood is still bunkered underground avoiding the world like most vault dwellers.
---
I realize this was 2 mo ago, but should've known Google would bring me back to good ol Reddit. Did you ever solve this mystery??? I just bought the sign/light &amp; cannot find it either : (
---
Maybe with private servers?
---
No, looks right. The higher your damage resistance the lower the damage, so no armor should be found more damafe
---
Hm. I've heard about the golf outfit thing. I might add it to my strat. Wdym by running around though?
---
You are doing literally what you hate.
---
Power Armor gives you Ballistic and Energy resistance which lowers Berserker Damage
---
Depends on your connection. Could be anywhere from an hour or two all the way to a few days off and on. No way to answer that with no information about your internet speed. But if this helps, as Fo76 sits now its a 53.8gb download. 
---
I hope we get some sort of group finder or matchmaking. Finding a group is the hardest, specially on console (PS4) 
---
For a stand alone Fallout game. NO. It's not a good one.
---
For a way for friends to play something fallouty with each other...yeah sure. You may or may not like it. 
---
Cold restart: Log out, shut down, unplug (press power and hold for a few sec  while unplugged to discharge), wait for a few min then reboot.
---
If on PC and still buggy then remove overclocks (gpu, cpu...) and cold restart again.
---
Check integrity of install.
---
You have to take into account the flux requirement for the ammo crafting for the same damage you have to do a ton more work. The bonus damage isn‚Äôt worth it 
---
I think they meant dropping something like a water or a round of ammo to move the bag rather than picking up more junk. 
---
I think it's 75+ gb or so now after the latest patches. Hope you have something else to do in the meantime.
---
Lmao, woahhh a low lvl bloodied sledge holy cow. That makes my arsenal of a dozen mutlistar max lvl bloody weapons look like trash! 
---
On a serious note, even with a bloody sledge, your dmg is likely garbage, my bloody sledge does 2-3k dmg depending on the situation, how about yours? Oh that‚Äôs right you can‚Äôt because you barely have any perk cards and have yet to even reach the level to unlock many of the top end perk cards. 
---
You‚Äôre too low level plain and simple, you‚Äôre not bringing enough to the table at level 35 or even level 50 to compensate for the scaling boost your presence is providing the queen. Stop making it hard for other people, she‚Äôs hardly been hard as hell since the last patch stealth buffed her.
---
Just go level up dude, yesterday I got my alt from 15-27 in 4 hours. It‚Äôs not unheard of people that bring a character from 30-50 in 4 hours. Stop slacking off and go level, it‚Äôs worth it at your level.
---
As I said 
---
&gt; Yeah they responded to numerous threads about that , since that aspect got a lot of negative feedback , they said that nothing is set in stone and it is subject to change.
---
Honestly, I can't remember the exact location. I know it was near the Top of the World on the railroad tracks. I used to travel there a lot to the vendor, so I would often follow the railroad tracks from that train station. I can't remember the exact direction either.
---
We should all just play the game how we want and let social dynamics and such handle the situation. :D
---
It's about 48gb
---
Just the first part has me super excited, I'm not going to lie. The rest is icing on the cake! Can't wait!!
---
I know this is a lot to ask but could someone that likes to make builds maybe make me a solo build on fallout builder I would seriously appreciate it . Maybe do like a jack of all trades kinda build. Again I understand if no one wants to but I know some people enjoy making builds so this is why I'm asking. I think if I have something to help me keep track of my levels I would have a better experience
---
Nope. Just a bunch of keyboard cowboys that think shooting everyone in the saloon to find the bad guy is perfectly acceptable.  
---
Well for reference it‚Äôs been about 40-60 minutes and it‚Äôs done 19.1% or just 9.33 GB
---
This would be amazing thank you so much!
---
I'll add you now and let me know what times suit you best etc :) 
---
I aim to create all sorts of different builds. It'll probably take a while, but like I said, I'm in no rush. I played Fallout 4 for a very long time and enjoyed every bit of it. It looks like there are great things to come for Fallout 76 and I hope everyone is just as enthused.
---
The solo campaign is great and complete now.  Co op is excellent.  PvP is decent but coming along.  You can have fun now, but should get a bit better over the next 6mo as more PvP modes and balance patches are introduced.
---
IMO if you find a deal, solo campaign to level up and try PvP but be prepared to set it down a few months if it's not yet to your taste.
---
there are two different police uniforms. A normal one and a responder one. the uniforms have different names, the hats not. Has one of them a red stripe around? That's the one for the responder police uniform.
---
... cuz I'm not much of a stickler for Haiku Rules? \*(down with the Haiku Police!)\*
---
So do the math. 20%  an hour approx. Should take you 2-3 hours or so
---
I noticed a damage drop with this as well
---
Fair enough
---
I think its from not learning the plans cause you were given them, IE small purifiers and Ultracite power armor parts. After learning the ultracite power armor all the parts didnt show known till I tried to learn one.
---
Not at all.
---
If I could let you take it, I would.
---
Or if you build in the same location on a different server, maybe you'll get one, too.
---
Don't get stuck on "betrayal"; it's just an example of a way you could interact with NPC in previous games that isn't present in this one.
---
But that's what I'm talking about when I say the stories are more linear. All the stories of the "survivors" have already ended, so they're inherently more limited.
---
Likewise, the core story is more linear, though in that case it's more a function of not being able to have branching impactful choices in the multiplayer setup that has been chosen. 
---
Don‚Äôt bring precious junks into uncertain fights. I can bring along my stable fluxes when i go to WS because I know ghouls aren‚Äôt a threat. But when I join a scorched earth event I always unload everything at the nearest stash box. 
---
My level 45 lever rifle does 145 DMG.
---
Basically the gun is a non legendary when I'm naked and when I put armor on it becomes even worse than a non legendary.
---
The effect is working backwards.
---
&gt;and they still do the exact damage they did before
---
not true
---
No speed demon but before the patch I would use a fraction of the amount of food to stay full.  I have completely drained 3 times in 15 minutes. 
---
So i would definitely suggest medic. Considering her profession. Every team needs a good medic. That being said, VATS rifle build for quick semi-long distance kills paired with a high luck. Once she got used to that it would be simple enough to change it up if she wanted to. That is awesome she wants to start playing. 
---
Can you put paints on x 01
---
if you are on PC and want to wash let me know. I can go 500 for one and then 300 ea. 
---
I usually just kite them out bc once they start smashing you with super sledges you may have some trouble. I like to dish out VATS head shots or cripple a leg first. Takes time those 68s are cake one on one but it gets a tad hairy when theres a dozen of em.
---
Major props to you good sir. I do believe I will have to pay you a visit!
---
I hope one theoretical roadmap wasn‚Äôt what made you forget everything beforehand and rose your hopes for bethesda. They haven‚Äôt earned it. 
---
They do stay
---
A team mate with rad sponge works
---
It's becauze idiots don't calibrate mics or they rearrange position of mics after calibration, and I r some Bethesda unknown fucked up reason, if mic is muted and you make a loud noise in game (power Armor clunk or whatever) it shows a chat icon like your speaking.
---
Saved this post I'll list my mods when I get home. I'm running a stealthy sniper build also.
---
This. For the silo part I had to go back and get my excavator PA and some decent weapons before being able to finish it.
---
But 100% solo.
---
Excuse me they do like 100 less from the near thousand or more they do
---
No no no NEVER put fallout and battle royale together you are giving the game a death wish.
---
This fucking rules lmao. The suit makes it 
---
That being said, I love my shotguns and packing that much stopping power makes for easy kills and not too much accuracy to pack so much power. You know i love shotguns so I would say that is never a bad idea.
---
I run a rifle build with a small shotgun package. I easily solo silos, farm whitesprings, and have no problem in scorched Earth. 
---
I just experienced the same thing about 20 mins ago 
---
I started new character a few days ago and since then I have noticed there is alot more garbage around. I started up Poseidon on my own then took the plant yard of some lead and cores. After a few defense quest and level 20 something comes over and starts attack me (lvl 15) and trying to take the yard. This lasted around 30 mins with me killing him way more then he killed me.
---
I got tired of him so I took all the resources and broke everything down and fast traveled to me camp. About 2 mins after he took the yard he left the game. I clue why people do this but its pretty damn annoying. 
---
I also had a lvl 90 break into my house and kill me for my 5 cap bounty then start breaking my whole camp with a drill.
---
Australia isn't a town in Florida?
---
.
---
/s sorry couldn't help it!
---
i was downvoted to hell yesterday for claiming that groups make silos easier even after detailing my reasons for why.   personally ive experienced wide ranges of difficulty from silos whether solo or grouped, ive done a silo run with a partner and only had 4 robots spawn during launch prep.  ive had other times with that same partner where it seemed like there was twice as many mobs as there are 'normally.'  as a sneak/vats build assaultron dominators are the only tough part for me, but as long as i stay out of power armor i can get the drop on them every time (chameleon armor).  sometimes i forget that u can get through the mainline quest at a pretty low level, i wouldnt want to try a silo solo under level 40
---
Here's what happened:
---
A PVP raider was sizing you up as prey.  Wanted to also get lucky and see where your CAMP was.  Hence the invitation to a team.  When that fell through, they began their inevitable assault on you.  That is all.
---
prior to the patch my TSE would do around that, yeah. 1000, probably more.
---
now my double-barrel, which is the strongest, deals 300 with all perks.
---
Are you interested in buying parts or whole suits at a wholesale price? I hate passing on good parts but I don‚Äôt have the time or stash space to sell them. I just got rid of a suit of t-51b lvl 50 last week. Would love to get a few caps and contribute to the cause. 
---
I don't understand why you're being such a douche. It's really confusing. as I've already said, I can fully kill enemies in the area and help out my entire team with reviving and healing. So I'm definitely not leaching on anyone or anything and I can definitely damage the scorchbeast queen. So there's really no reason for you to act like such a douche to me. Bye
---
How so?
---
Thanks for answering. Was just wondering if I would be able to download it overnight, guess I'll buy the game tonight.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I fell back. Headshotted them as much as possible, but still they get through. 
---
I went through and tested on my 3 accounts and various characters, seems to, atleast antidotally based on level...  
---
On the same account, in the same server, in the same place, the level 15 didn't do it at all, my level 86 a bit and my level 330 non-stop 
---
i had someone tell me this yesterday, while i had a server to myself.  so we tried it.  we had a controlled environment, no one in nuke zone not invited.  4 of us, all high level and well equipped,  couldn't take her down. 
---
What's AAE? sounds awesome. I would love more stuff that can clear the golf course because I always get murdered by ghouls and get so much radiation

You're very welcome. Not sure if I'll be on again this weekend, but I'm usually always on in the evenings during the week.
---
You really dont see it.....
---
I'm sorry John, but you're going to have to Run again.
---
Theyre crafty bastards. Take out the legs that will slow em down, regain your AP and dish out the lead
---
My explosive shotguns do about half of what they did pre patch with the same shotgun perks
---
X box only :(
---
not trying to be combatitve, but i had a server to myself yesterday for over 8 hours and so we tried nuking prime with a controlled number of high level well equipped players.  only 4 people on the entire server, we couldnt take her down
---
Also sometimes you gotta know when to run lol
---
I need friends like you to play with lol. 
---
Oh I do! Thank you, will head there today. Thanks!
---
Good luck in the wasteland fellow vault dweller!
---
Was it REALLY a plastic run you made at Watoga High yesterday?  Or were you the guy who entered the Monster Mash event and just hid in a corner killing everyone with a mask to steal their junk drops?  ;) 
---
So better choice?
---
Yeah well that doesn't add up, they still on shot ALL enemies from what I've seen. Hell, my pal one taps scorchbeasts. Plus you still shouldn't kill people in full X0-1 without even activating combat with A SINGLE SHOT.
---
No, I don't. Please elaborate. 
---
Never once claimed it as a problem. I said playing with friends makes it easier because some hoards are impossible to do by yourself. Which is a fact as were discussing it now. Not sure where the confusion is coming from. This is a multiplayer game after all, so obviously it will be more enjoyable/practical to play with others. 
---
Dumb dude here that just got an xbox. How do I find you in the game, haha?
---
Hmmm....okay, I am not sure why this is tbh. I have taken her down solo in less than 3 minutes with a bloodied melee build. Also solo (same conditions as you). Not for quite a while though, I admit.
---
Perhaps one of the latest patches changed something?
---
But are you the *real* one?
---
Hell yeah. In NV I also had piles of caps all over the penthouse. They're a little harder to come by in this game.
---
 Check the discord. There‚Äôs probably a lfg Chanel there 
---
still trying to figure out how to search DC for that.
---
Almost just did myself. My wife and I started strong, but at about super mutant 50 it went very wrong...
---
Power armor is awful in PvP 
---
You survived an Aiden, bro. Thank your lucky stars for that. Nothing more deadly than an Aiden latching on to you, following you around, squeaking loudly into his mic about teaming-up or dropping chems for him. 
---
Yours apparently lost interest before shit got real.
---
He must‚Äôve had ADHD.
---
Yeah, I Fallout, but my sarcasm sucks in text format. üòÜ
---
Nice job! I thought about doing this, but didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. I do wish this game had the fallout 4 option to display my other sets. Maybe I‚Äôll stop by sometime!
---
No.  They fucked they entire stealth sniper thing.
---
You can do it, like I did, but it's a ring crawl and you'll have to whittle away at shit as it runs up and kills you endlessly, only to go back to full health, which means wasted bullets and then hours on hours of crafting   and searching for bullets mats  vs just going melee and one shooting everything in the game no worries, no grinding, just fun.
---
Is kind of fucked up, but that's Bethesda currently.
---
Why would you be glad ? Lol.
---
Ash Heap\*
---
Half the community doesn't want little 11 year old battle royale bum boys swarming the game its bad enough as it is. We are getting a new survival mode have a little battle royale roleplay with your friends in that. To be honest as well if you want a battle royale go to fortshite or something.
---
If you aren‚Äôt familiar with Fallout games, they have a nice feature called ‚ÄúVATS‚Äù, which is an automated targeting system. You just activate VATS, and it locks onto an enemy.  It can make combat a lot easier if you have trouble manually aiming your shots...

Windmill plan is acquired by taking Monongah Power Plant.
---
What if you die from rads? 
---
I feel like Grahm can show up on any road.  I ran into him today in Whitespring. He was just inside the gates across from the train station.
---
Oh crap I didn‚Äôt see your level! Sorry about that but yeah sneak and run to the robots! :)
---
But this would be a completely separate mode from the main game, what's the harm in it?
---
Great. I hate seeing it on there. All I‚Äôm saying is they better fix it by the time wild Appalachia comes out with all the new quests. Cause that‚Äôs annoying. 
---
Once you join there‚Äôs a Chanel on the server called fo76 lfg 
---
Does kinetic dynamo and dodgy work stack/work together?
---
Alot....
---
Just FYI the targeting hud will cause you and others around you to blue screen sporadically. Don‚Äôt say you weren‚Äôt warned.
---
Not over encumbered. Seems I was wrong about one thing though: it's not just affecting my main.  And I followed someone's advice and waited a while before opening my pip boy. Froze again.
---
Against explosive weapons yes, but if you are a normal person it defends well against melee, normal bullets, and energy weaponry, as well as fat mans.
---
Why do you want to turn Fallout76 into Fortnite76?
---
For the workshop? 
---
He gone ? Lol 
---
ya i was going to ask how long ago it was that u took her down solo or with few numbers.  i have been unsuccessful with each of my 3 attempts since the most recent patch.  the person who said we could kill her yesterday with just 2 people was confused afterward, saying he felt like he was doing a fraction of the damage he was used to.  im wondering whats changed with the queen fight,  i used to have much more luck winning the fight.  couldn't believe we lost on a controlled server last night i was pissed
---
I saw Phoenix on top of one of the buildings once. Guess Protectrons need fresh air from time to time.
---
I can also see you are getting quite a few downvotes  on this too.
---
GT ?
---
Right. I guess your comment in my mind made it seem like a bad thing that a lvl 20 couldn't take on a hoard. Sorry for my mistake. I agree it's more fun with friends for the sheer fact that its fallout with friends. I guess I just stayed away from those areas until I was higher level. Focused on the story so I could play solo and listen to the audio which is actually quite entertaining. 
---
*Wooo* It's your **5th Cakeday** Pleged! ^(hug)
---
Yup
---
Seems I was wrong about one thing. It's now affecting my lower level character. Tried waiting a while before opening my pip boy and it worked... for a while, Then froze again.  Logged back in and eventually got it to work.  I'm guessing this will be fodder for a future patch.  
---
You make some solid counterarguments.
---
Maybe they did up the loss with parasites. I‚Äôve only gotten it once and it drain d me like crazy
---
As someone who isn‚Äôt the best quick-shot with not a ton of experience playing FPS games, VATS targeting makes it super easy. That on xbox is left bumper while in combat, it doesn‚Äôt last forever but auto-locks on targets.
---
Also early game find something like a machete or axe which will let you save up some ammo and is pretty easy to take down early level enemies with.
---
let's break down your post and point out all your mistakes, shall we?
---
&gt;they still on shot ALL enemies from what I've seen.
---
only bloodied ones. but at that point, mostly every weapon does. bloodied is the same as two-shot pre-nerf, except for the accuracy penalty and added requirement.
---
&gt;Hell, my pal one taps scorchbeasts.
---
then he's using a bloodied one. and even then, he's probably probably pumping every dug and buff imaginable, *if* he's not outright exploiting.
---
&gt;Plus you still shouldn't kill people in full X0-1
---
pvp for a bit and you'll realize PA means squat outside of pve. hell, you don't even need an anti-armor legendary to completely ignore PA, Incisor, Tank Killer and Stabilized do a great job by themselves. DResistance is crap, you want DReduction such as Lone Wanderer, etc.
---
&gt;without even activating combat with A SINGLE SHOT.
---
you mean he killed you in passive mode? because, in that case, he was exploiting. it's nothing to do with shotguns.
---
Yes atleast SOMEONE gets my point
---
50 with Power Armor and All Rise with no perks involved. Tedious on the Silo since gutsies are billetes sponges.
---
Try deleting, Fallout76.ini and verifying the game installation with the launcher. (Game options - Scan &amp; Repair). 
---
Check Fallout 76.ini and find the line 
---
    sResourceArchive2List =  
---
I don't really see what's wrong with your Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
After verifying Fallout76.ini, try removing the Fallout76Custom.ini (can just rename or move it out).
---
See if the game loads properly without a Fallout76Custom.ini, it should.
---
You haven't edited the Fallout76Prefs.ini with any of these lines right?
---
My Fallout76Custom.ini looks like this:
---
    [Archive]
---
    sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, MenuMusicReplacer.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, pahudfix.ba2, Power Armor Clean HUD.ba2, UHDmap.ba2

2 days for 50GB if you had my internet. But wait, there's more! 50GB patch immediately after installing, bumping time to 4 days!
---
Any recommendations for leveling up it seems kind complex 
---
As expected. People don't read or put any real thought into it, they just see the name "battle royale" and instantly downvote.
---
I obviously don't think Bethesda would do this, just thinking out loud that it could possibly work with some tweaking.
---
\+karma thank you very much
---
I wrote the simulation theory here.  Happy to help with story related investigations if you need or want help 
---
that's categorically untrue. a puncturing power first with incisor goes through your PA like it's made out of butter.
---
New player and this is awesome!! I might just stop by and check it all out as I‚Äôm only lvl 5. On XB1 so I‚Äôll add your GT. 
---
No problem. If you end up having issues locating it then I can try taking a screenshot. Just let me know.
---
Leg cripple the melee's first, you won't have to kite as far/fast. Then snipe from cover, again headshots to the melee's first, then a lot of strafing from cover to cover point until you can get them all. Ranged mutants don't have VATS aim, so you can avoid a lot of fire by moving.
---
Yet another reason why you see so many power plants unclaimed. 
---
I don't. lol
---
Again, something like this would be a completely separate thing from the main game. Building wouldn't be as fast and dynamic as Fortnite. Just something to make rudimentary defense or traps for players.
---
I‚Äôm not the douche here, I‚Äôm telling you how it is. Because players like you hold everyone back, thinking you‚Äôre helping but you‚Äôre only making it much harder.
---
The fact that you‚Äôre having to reassure me that you can kill lvl 68 enemies only reassured me that your dmg is low and you‚Äôre barely making a dent in the queen, especially since you‚Äôre not running rank 3 incisor because you can‚Äôt get it at your level. 
---
Just stop dude, go lvl up it‚Äôs not that hard AT ALL, you could literally be lvl 60 in a day or two and have enough perk cards to maybe contribute enough to warrant your presence. 
---
Wow. Cool story ! 
---
Jukebox Saturday night and Sixteen Tons are probably my 2 favorites. I really miss Orange Colored Sky by Nat King Cole from 4. And Crawl out through the fallout. And everything from New Vegas. I also like the classical channel, it has some pretty epic shit.
---
Liar
---
Same thing at a bunch of Workshops. Before even being able to claim it. Mobs under the trailer at Charleston Landfill. Mobs somewhere? at Sunshine Meadows. Then there are mobs during defend events just hiding somewhere you can't find them.

It is impossible for it to be bloodied as he had full health at ALL times. So PA is useless, I see that now. But he still shouldn't do that amount of damage. An exploit is the best bet. 
---
It brought back the damage bug, or it's the lag , I've noticed it too. I killed her twice and failed three times .all in this week, after most recent patch. When we failed it seemed like her health just stops moving at some point. I've seen posts about nuke zones being more laggy than before since patch 6 , so maybe that's the issue
---
Do you not get it PRACTICALLY no one would even want this I would guarantee that most of the player base would leave even if it's a gamemode.
---
What kind of BOS T-60 paints do you have? Looking for paladin or sentinel 
---
I'll try it tonight and let you know. Funny thing is, the PiHole doesn't even show that it's blocking anything when I get the error. Either way, blocking the log in is strange enough. 
---
Well I run an assassins puncturing power fist yet I still do not even half as much as he is unarmored
---
I feel your pain! I was got so happy only to be let down.
---
That's actually awesome great job 
---
Are you on ps4? Because I think I saw you take this pic. 
---
A fallout 3 remaster at some point is obvious, which is my fav fallout. If it happens I hope it comes to vr as well with better graphics to feel new.
---
Agreed but I believe op is talking about why unlimited would be bad in form of gameplay aesthetic. Like In fo4 there was no limitation so I picked up everything without a second thought since I could just store it at a base, but with 76 the limitations actually make you weigh pros and cons of what you need and dont need.
---
I hope not. One prestige per 50+, no additional bonuses. Keep it fair, especially for new content
---
No worries, it's a good feature 
---
Fragging will show them down.
---
indeed. with full health he'd be dealing around 350 at most, plus buffs like psycho. but even then he shouldn't be able to oneshot a passive player.
---
there are lots of reports like yours.
---
Definitely more laggy!! I killed her a few times today, and twice I had to wait 3+ minutes for the spinning thing to give me her loot.
---
I don't really think there's a new bug though. She's just tough :) Maybe a little stealth-rebalancing went on, but all attempts today were successful, so it's definitely possible.
---
Dont run around White Springs, just ‚Äúdo‚Äù the golf house. It‚Äôs boring but the XP / loot is very good. 
---
Sometimes the ghouls are already dead, and you have wasted time running to the other houses - but again I have done both. The golf house can be hard to manage (a lot of fucking ghouls come at you)
---
I just stand in the door with a vamperic super sledge and mash my attack button.
---
How very on-brand for BoS
---
Not bug. Game loads models before scripts. Since scripts are rather heavy, you first get the world, your character, npc models, everyone elses then final verification -- i.e. The first rubber band when you enter heavy load area. 
---
You honestly should just delete this post and pretend that you never made it.
---
Yeah definitely vampiric especially now they made the mobs harder to kill.. i run through west Tek with one and dont have to use a stimpak.
---
do you really want the game to be a bigger laughing stock than it is now? adding a battle royale will just give people more fuel to hate on the game with.
---
I actually laughed out loud at this because it's TRUE. I honestly could care less about the PVP in this game let alone a BR. No thanks. 
---
Yeah, maybe on the new pvp servers, because that just doesn't work on the current ones
---
Charleston is terrible for that. A damn mole rat spawned inside the ceiling of one of the trailers last night. I used explosives, grenades, mines, even launched a mini nuke at it. I was almost to the point of using an orbital strike on it. 
---
I just wanted the junk nodes, Bethesda!
---
That's it from me bye bro.
---
I know and this guy isn't getting the point at all.
---
Oh man this was an awesome read! Ive been curious about this for a long while since ive found bits and pieces of cryptid things but never had the time to dive into it. You went above and beyond in diving into this. Now i can explore all of this at my leisure and see if i can find any more cool things besides whats already been found 
---
Plus since you also probably know this, he was standing in place doing nothing as I drained insane amounts of health as if he WAS attacking. There were no enemies nearby.
---
I feel like I came off the wrong way. But isn‚Äôt it easier for you to just type in google and get taken to the official source. Rather than type into Reddit, wait for a response, and hope it is a good one. I mostly just wanted to suggest a better way to find out info for yourself 
---
I replied to your build question with a website for builds, my first 25-30 lvls I picked whatever perks and skill points I felt would help me in that moment, then tried putting a build path together and someone here on reddit helped me make it better (check my user history).
---
By not planning it out initially I will need to take more levels post-lvl-50 to fix my build, but it‚Äôs not the end of the world.
---
As a lvl 203 can I lvl up? Or does it take a while. I used to do this before the patch of 500xp per ghoul. If your correct I'll try to find a emptyish server with a nuked WS and just keep joining killing and leaving over and over. Thanks mate;)
---
standing around is normal because of sentinel. but I do remember a report similar to yours, at the time I figured it was just lag but maybe there's more to it.
---
Yeah, something seems really wrong with her damage reduction since the patch. 
---
I rarely failed before the patch even with pick up randoms and dead weight players... although some times it was a slog. 
---
After the patch though, failed every time.
---
Something big has changed with her resilience.
---
The game map is divided by level, stick to the Forest and possibly the edges of the Savage Divide (middle map) and Toxic Valley (up north where the crazy alligator water park is) when you're starting out.
---
Boil water or else you're going to get diseases from staying hydrated. Pharma Farma is a good perk to get stocked up on chems, just be sure to manually "search" the chem box to get it to kick in. Cannibal is also a good perk early on to keep you full, you get bonuses from being well-fed and hydrated, so it's worth it to baby your food and water meters.
---
Don't worry too much about your build early on, just grab whatever weapons you can and figure out what works for you. Also, scrapping weapons can teach you mods for those weapons so take whatever you find that you won't keep and scrap it.
---
I'd invite you to play but I'm on PS4. Have fun!
---
Only so far as you need enough points in int it to equip the perk.
---
I'll buy it for tree fiddy
---
This is so true I personally love fallout 76 (as well as every fallout game) but I can't experience chilling with a team of people and doing quests/whatever. Ever since Fallout 3 came out I've been saying ''This would be fun af to play with people''. Now the games here but no one to play with!
---
At this point all I'm asking is action against this dude since I'm sure it's impossible to get my 2k back
---
You're not wrong
---
Mentality of entitled gamer 101.  Mildly annoying,  but not even remotely game breaking bug... FIX IT immediately or I'll talk bad about you on the Internet! 
---
I claim them so I can get some fusion corps
---
Okay, now I want one.. :)
---
All I want is a goddamn legendary handmade and hunting rifle. They seem to be the most elusive beasts of the game. i don't know how many hours in I am at this point, but I've yet to see either.
---
Ooh! I need to get one of those.
---
I would buy FO3 again for the switch. I am already killing myself with neglect from Skyrim on the switch but I think FO4 or FO:NV on switch would finish me off
---
Invest in lone wanderer
---
If it‚Äôs not, drink a gallon of Tabasco sauce
---
If you do this, please make it optional.
---
The first thing I‚Äôve ever bought from the Atom Shop is the Mothman PA set. That‚Äôs fuckin sick. I need it. 
---
Clean water purifier skin? Chrome mini gun? A PRINCESS bed? The hairstyles and makeup is whack. The icons are bs. Only other thing I thought of getting was the vampire outfit, but I love the Pastors Vestiments too much to do that or the Unstopables sets
---
The Atom Shop should have TONS of accessories of bonuses and whatnot. That‚Äôs a market they are missing. People shouldn‚Äôt pay to win. But premiums are gravy 
---
Upvote this!
---
So in a couple weeks then?
---
The problem with having a legendary outright is that the chances are pretty low for a specific item. I'm tracking my drops and within the last 376 drops over a week as of now, not a single legendary Handmade or Gatling Gun dropped for me.
---
I can't speak for how long this could elongate the game for most, only that the determinism could shift the focus from "mindless" grind for TSEs onto roleplaying and enjoing the new content with adaptable builds.
---
The only reason id say no, is after seeing how much the red dead battle royale mode sucks, I think itd look similarly on fallout 76 
---
I like battle royales but.. no
---
Mole miners gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet, power fist. 
---
How many you need and how much you want to pay ?
---
You‚Äôre spot on. I went searching for this bug earlier because I knew it could be just me. Didn‚Äôt see your post then. The [caution] thing is annoying. The only way to fix is to log out which totally sucks 
---
No worries! :)
---
That 300 include the frame?  If I throw in some caps/scrap can I get some mods?
---
This is a known and often reported problem on this Reddit sub. Just search for Empath Class Freak to see the many posts about it. Maybe use the search function and add to one of the existing threads if you have something new to add to the discussion?
---
AGREED!!!  This should only be an option.
---
I miss Dying Light. :(
---
Technically this would be the brotherhood
---
+1 with the increases in stash size a lot of the perks i took to maintain my inventory i really do not need anymore. I wouldn't mind a free respec or just a better respec system in general.
---
Nope. Just like the people that complain how PVP isn't fair. It is not supposed to be a solely PVP game so no it wont be fair. All a BR mode would bring is bratty people and huge nerfs that would make the actual game unplayable. I mean take the queen now...if you've seen it you know what I mean lol. 
---
I was initially surprised that ‚Äútwo left hands‚Äù and ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know the gun was loaded‚Äù were actual real-life songs. 
---
THIS is what i envisioned when i started playing fallout 76. People being able to start their own "business" like this. 
---
How much have you got? 
---
Do you play solo or in a group?  Just about anything can be handled in a full squad of 4 players.  Even just 2 is pretty good though.
---
I feel like im going to nappa autoparts for a oil filter.
---
It's a good source for fusion cores. I'm talking about more workshops in general. And I've had enemies spawn underground  during the reclamation process.   In other words, I had to clear the workshop of mole rats to claim it, but I couldn't clear them  because they wouldn't come out of the ground. 
---
So I couldn't claim it. 
---
This happens to me, or I get booted to the title screen with an error. Very rarely do I ever get another server. I just stopped using it. Seems like yet another feature that wasn't tested.
---
same here !
---
Having a backpack is the main reason I run around in the union uniform
---
Hmm, anti-nuclear or pro-scorched?
---
I wouldn't mind a new faction of semi-scorched zealot players. They could roll them into 'raiders' to work against other vault dwellers 
---
Ok
---
No 500 xp a pop sorry, leveling past 99 is twice the xp compared to 50-99 as I recall. Im only level 77, but the xp for me has been very good.
---
Im now mostly in it for the golf outfits, they sell for a lot :-). Oh and the crap ton useless legendaries ... 
---
Frost mode :p
---
You need to update your custom ini file to take account of the changes in the last patch.
---
Add his gamer tag and then when he‚Äôs on just hit join game under him. 
---
It's what I tell myself
---
I have had them before and the food drain was maybe 1.5 times as fast. Draining my food bar three times in 15 minutes is unheard of which is why I don‚Äôt think it is the parasites doing it unless they bumped up that drain many times over.  I‚Äôll use a single food bar in about 20 minutes without parasites and in about 15 or so with before the patch.  
---
...please tell me this is satire or you're just trying to be funny
---
Ha, yeah sorry
---
I had a rabbit ("Hey! I was minding my own business here!"), a cat ("You can't kill me I'm too smart for you!"), both of these ran off btw, and a gulper ("hey this thing is making finding food today really easy!" ). I had to kill the gulper and his friends before I became food.
---
loved this quest. 
---
Yes totally agree with that. I was concerned when they said pvp. But when they described how I was like, ok I can work with that.
---
Ideally I was hoping for co-op play. But the limited players per server was good for me too. Though I‚Äôm fine with them upping the amount per server to 36 at some point.
---
Mainly I was attracted to this because they wanted the other humans In the game are real people, not just programs, 
---
That the most rewarding and frustrating encounters would be actual people. 
---
That has certainly been true for me. I think that‚Äôs why people used to single player Fallout are struggling with this version. The game is really designed for team play.
---
And I‚Äôm really enjoying that.
---
Super weird! It's been happening for me since I was in the level 20s, and still happens now (I'm 57).  I haven't checked on a lot of alternate chars though.
---
Ugh. 
---
Why do so many people not hide the UI when posting screenshots?
---
According to the last blog post from Bethesda, something is coming that will deal with this in the Summer, so I‚Äôd say hang tight.
---
&gt;	New Feature: Legendary Players ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
[Berhesda roadmap post](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
How could anyone here know? Wait for it and you will get your answer.
---
YES!
---
I had this today, and tested everything I could think of on my machine.
---
Killing the Bethesda launcher and relaunching solved it - hope this helps :)
---
And I‚Äôm asking why that should be the case.  It means that as a lower level player I have to either server hop or fast tracel out of ares simply because someone higher level was there.  Things like this make it harder for new players to join the game. 
---
I'm not *that* suicidal. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the info! I just need to read up on the cards and perks a bit more but overall I have a much better understanding. 
---
I appreciate the location info, that‚Äôs really good to know. Can‚Äôt wait to just explore and see how the game pans out for me. 
---
To be honest I‚Äôm so use to structured loot and shoot games, just playing how i want feels wrong haha. Too many possibilities! 
---
Thanks again!
---
tl;dr
---
"FEMALE QUEST GIVERS? OH MY GOD THE FEMINISTS ARE TAKING OVER"
---
Rough start followed by attention seekers on youtube.
---
My thoughts based on the description of Wastelanders is that Vault 63 is in turmoil and has still living residents; our job would be to get in that vault and rescue them, and in turn the dwellers inside leave the Vault with us and form their own fledgling factions and settlements.
---
Alternatively they leave the Vault of their own accord following some aforementioned disaster, and their now vacant Vault becomes a Raid like the other two.
---
Nice! I‚Äôm only missing a couple pieces! 
---
I downvoted, cause it shouldn't matter if females are giving you "orders". Do you complain when it's predominately males giving you orders in games? Of course you don't.    
---
Don't be anti female. Get yourself checked
---
Agreed. That would be a huge pain in the ass.  
---
If you highlight the Challenge itself, you'll see a checklist of the things that count.
---
You need quite a bit of stuff, like 50 Fertilizer.  It's certainly not impossible, but it's near the end of the week and I haven't accomplished too many of those things naturally.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this with my TSE Dragon also.
---
You can't repair it from the camp device?
---
If you highlight the challenge in the menu it will show you on the right hand side a list of what it considers ‚Äúbuilding supplies‚Äù. Hope that helps!
---
As far as i know all of these are considered unarmed, so they shouldn't benefit from one-handed.
---
near sons of dane compound if i‚Äôm remembering foggily? or at least near the Monongha power plant or the town?
---
Is that the add friend option?
---
Lol, I know nothing except how to launch Hulu/Netflix and launch games. 
---
Lmao just tried this and ya wtf they do. Gonna take awhile to lvl up but thanks alot for sharing. If on xbox my GT is YummyFortnut69. I am comban till tomorrow though;) lol but ya these 1 stars ugh
---
It‚Äôs not an issue bud, it‚Äôs a feature. The robots in Watoga will be hostile again after that quest because you are just ‚ÄúMayor for a Day‚Äù.
---
That‚Äôs great! I know I had done that before on other challenges - I don‚Äôt know why that didn‚Äôt occur to me for this challenge. Thank you! 
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Hey Turd ! How much for lvl 15 Raider set? I've been searching for weeks! I could meet you tonight but after ten pm EST!
---
I've had some success with Gatling Gun and shot guns. And of course both have  perks in the strength tree. That's on my main. 
---
My alt character was built more for rifles and rifles just seem weak by comparison.   They might be better with legendary effects but even then, I would think that an explosive shot gun would have higher damage than an explosive rifle. 
---
I know very few people who run successful pistol builds. Not saying they don't exist, but it does seem to me that damn near everyone I see has a shotgun or a melee weapon. 
---
Right. I misunderstood.
---
Burt Reynolds. Yeah that's not my name
---
They've formally acknowledged it.  It just hasn't been fixed.
---
How did he make your account suspended for 7 days?
---
üò≠ WHY NOT PS4... 
---
Thanks. I actually did that before posting but didn't see anything in the first page of results. I see lots of posts about it further down. Can't believe this has been going on for this long.
---
The roadmap was released just yesterday so i highly doubt there will be any further information on any of the upcoming features at this piont. I guess we all have to wait.
---
snipe them with a hunting rifle. U don't even need a legendary to do this. Just lay back and get those sneak attacks from a fair distance.
---
I would like to join. I want to get more into Fallout 76, but I never have anyone to play with.
---
Hate bug #1 learned that the hard way and missed the shot. Didn‚Äôt know about the drop the ammo thing though. Do you have to do that ever time you reselect the gun? 
---
Just going to copy my comment from the thread over at r/bethesdasoftworks (https://www.reddit.com/r/BethesdaSoftworks/comments/atwjbv/so_its_begins_amazon_listed_3_new_games_form/), remembering that they have multiple studios under their banner:
---
Going studio by studio:
---
- BGS: Extremely unlikely to be anything from them. BGS Austin and Maryland were both flat out on Fallout 76 until late last year (https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits), so Starfield has probably only been in full production for a little while. BGS Montreal is presumably mostly on Blades. Could possible be something from BGS Dallas (their VR team), but at present I'd assume they are mostly on the VR component of Blades. Plus, XB1 doesn't have a VR capability at present.
---
- Zenimax Online Studios: Their next expansion to ESO, Elsweyr, already has Amazon pages and is due out on June 4 2019. Of course, ESO game out in 2014, so there's an outside chance they have an entirely new game to announce.
---
- Id Software: Have Rage 2 (May 14 2019) and Doom Eternal (unknown release date) coming out, both of which already have Amazon pages. I struggle to see them having capacity to have a third game ready to announce this year.
---
- Arkane Studios: They released Dishonored 2 late 2016 and Prey in May 2017. Since then they did a standalone expansion to Dishonored 2 in September 2017 and a couple of expansions to Prey. Definitely could be something from them.
---
- Tango Gameworks: They released The Evil Within in October 2014 and then The Evil Within 2 in October 2017. 2 years between releases is early, but possible.
---
- Machine Games: Have Wolfenstein Youngblood coming out some time this year - which already has an Amazon page and is priced at $30 - and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot, which is supposed to be a VR experience, and also already has an Amazon page (for PS4 - and is prices at $20). Difficult to see them coming out with a full price game this year.
---
Most likely to me would be a new Arkane game.
---
Adding to that:
---
- Todd has repeatedly stated that he's not a big fan of remastering their earlier games as long as they can be played on modern hardware (https://www.destructoid.com/todd-howard-doesn-t-really-want-to-remaster-bethesda-games-513449.phtml)
---
- Who the heck does a standard/deluxe/collector's edition for a *remaster*?
---
Also note that the countdown is free to use stock footage, i.e. an intern with a few minutes of Googling could have put it in.
---
Remember that part of E3 last year when Todd talked about Fallout 3 and people got their hopes up for a remaster for all of 5 seconds? (https://youtu.be/hPlpOIfFbWI?t=1485) Yeah, I think we're being trolled here.
---
I probably should have built different characters too. Instead I keep tweaking the one character and moved perk points around. It‚Äôs a such a fun game that you can play it in many different ways. 
---
Agreed!!!!
---
Destiny 2 had a weird rollercoaster ride too, from love to hate and back again. 
---
I've noticed once in a while when I play my friend's can't hear me, and sometimes if I'm streaming and we use Party Chat from the PS4 then the stream doesn't pick up everyone's audio, there's always one person left out.
---
I‚Äôve encountered him 4 times now, might be a coincidence, but it was always in/near a forest.
---
I can sort of make it work with sniper and melee, but it's definitely lacking in melee since I perked up as a sniper. I have a shotgun build in the works, but I think I'll try full melee after that.
---
So, I'm curious, is the Berserker effect something on top of a weapon's base damage, or can it actually chew into its base damage if a player is armored up?
---
Like, if a non-Legendary version of this weapon did 150 damage, would it bottom out at 150 if I were fully armored, or something &lt; 150?
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, started playing this week. Lvl 19, no relevant perks, and my turrets work on both players and npcs. Just today I had a team of 2 players try to kill me for over 30 minutes but they couldn‚Äôt survive the turrets. I slept in my shack until turrets went off, then I‚Äôd pop out and hit them with my ski sword for the K.O. 
---
One was level 23, the other 29, both had power armour (I haven‚Äôt found any level appropriate yet) and I do not. I killed them 5 or 6 times each and I only died once. Was the most fun I‚Äôve had in this game so far lol 
---
I saw another comment claiming they need proper lighting to operate properly, but idk I only have a single campfire and some lamps I can‚Äôt figure out how to turn on 
---
Surely something can be disclosed. I mean even just the global inventory and if it weekly resets. Or possibly if it is a wanderer or will have a stash box next to it. 
---
They are, moron. You‚Äôre a boiling frog. 
---
How much would a level 50 full left side and right leg of T51B cost me
---
Oh ok, I guess I was confused lol. Thanks!
---
The Mothman giveth, the Mothman taketh!
---
I feel armor is currently fairly balanced, as nuke zones only make up a minority of your time in fallout 76. I do wish that a full set of trapper or marine armor would give you the rad reduction that power armor or a hazmat suit gives, however. With legendary effects normal armor is much better than power armor, all armor gains bonus defense when over repaired.
---
No, you. 
---
Yep totally sucked, fired my thousands of cells in one shot. I was like huh what just happened? I‚Äôve got several variants of this head including two-shot and furious, but never wanted to try again until they fix it in the future.
---
You are the very example of the "fragile male ego" that they talk about. And this is coming from a dude
---
This is beautiful truly a marvel
---
Go to the Charleston capital building..theres a lot of enemies not too hard too clear out..but desk fans and battered clipboards galore..solves the screw problem..but you will still need ballistic fiber
---
Arktos is the birthplace of the Snallygaster, just saying. It's on the terminal there. 
---
You‚Äôre stupid. Willing to be dominated by females is a strong and healthy ego? Hahahha. Sure sure. 
---
Do you offer stuff like the black/green BOS under armor or the BOS hood to go with armor? Either way I‚Äôll probably shoot you an add request soon enough! 
---
Oh, I didn't knew the thing with bonus defense. However, the nuke zones are an (if not the only) essential part of the endgame aren't they? And right now they are almost exclusively accessible in Power Armor imo.. 
---
I can‚Äôt get there in game right now, could I get some proof on that?
---
Black Titanium is important, you can get it off of Mole Miner Scrap items and Deathclaws.  Don't know of another way to get it, I just kept hunting down Deathclaws.
---
11-12 friends? Show off! /s
---
Lol WAT
---
Black titanium ore or whatever it‚Äôs called,and a shit ton of screws like at least 60 I think, I just started it a bit ago myself, only one more leg piece to build!:)
---
Probably said bad things in a message to the griefer and he reported it 
---
Sounds like an issue to me. I've got multiple characters and none are being attacked by the Watoga bots after completing the questline.
---
Technically the thing you uploaded to all the robots was to make them friendly again.
---
With them showing red, that's been an issue since launch that they can't seem to fix. 
---
Is there a thread or forum somewhere discussing this? I‚Äôd like to hear more about this lmao 
---
Thanks fir the reminder.  Once they fix the issue with food draining so fast I will check it out. 
---
The reason 2FA is so prevalent, is because the methods of spoofing sessions are so numerous.  2FA is the best way to secure, and identify a user.  It's not bad once you get used to it.  Google authenticator is free and can be used.  
---
Again, no one asked Bethesda to force another launcher on our computers, Steam offers 2FA for free, and Bethesda wouldn't have had to worry about it.  They chose to go their own way, they can pay for it.
---
That‚Äôs right, it shouldn‚Äôt matter. But here it mattered that they were female. They were made female on purpose because of political climate. There is a forced feminist bias. 
---
I can make and sell an officer suit (black) or the Knight or Soldier
---
Still got some level 15 armor you can part with?
---
Yeah, my eyes glazed over at that point too. There's a considerable difference between "I can't manage my inventory" and "unplayable".
---
Welcome back, bro. You on PC? I'll hook you up with good armour.
---
Prime receiver is great on guns that don‚Äôt have other receivers, like the 50 cal or gauss rifle. Otherwise, I would stick with hardened receivers. Scorchslayers is trash, and your better off with a hardened receiver.
---
Yup lol
---
How much of your imagination did you use to creative that narrative? Let me know when you are done playing make-believe, I would like to have a conversation with an adult, not a child.
---
No, this is not correct.
---
&gt;	objectively
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means. 
---
I'll say wait until level 30 but you need black titanium, alot of springs, steal, and i forgot the rest. But i build mine this week and it was quite easy since i was level 49. 
---
In light of all these problems with turrets, I am NOT also going to build a budget-expensive spotlight near each one to try and fix it. This was suggested to me months ago, and while it DOES work to make your turrets more effective, you can spend almost all of your workshop budget on 4 turrets and a couple spotlights, and have no room left to build anything else but a basic shack. Server stability has been massively increased (by 300%, according to Bethesda) and most of the duper mules have been purged that were choking the servers with too many items and causing issues. Our stash size has been doubled since day 1. Yet no CAMP budget increase? People used to think your budget increased with level, but that was found to be false. Why not implement that? It would keep new players who don't stick around and play long from putting too much of a load on the servers, but let the old vets that keep the game alive be rewarded and new players have something to aspire to. Until then I will just continue to put my camp places where things have a hard time attacking it and being my own home defense.
---
Becuase otherwise it means the problem is his and not the server's.
---
It says when SCRAPPING legendaries, so I wonder if the amount of stars may be a determining factor for potential learning the mods? Higher stars higher odds?
---
Also I think the scaling has to do with the first person in the area..so if u were there first..the enemies would have all been mid-level
---
Oh boy. Good luck with everything
---
Lol so women don‚Äôt want power on men ever and male-hating feminism isn‚Äôt a thing that exists today. Right? There is no feminism propaganda going on, right? The world isn‚Äôt skewed in favor of females, right? 
---
Yea for rifles you need to maximize Perception column but for pretty much everything else (heavy/shotgun/explosive/melee) you need to maximize Strength. That‚Äôs why I first tried rifle but then now moved to Strength because I can easily switch between gatling to melee or shotgun and equip the right perks to boost them. 
---
it's not fair for me
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs working backwards (that would be more damage with more armor), it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs damage range seems to only include negative, not positive damage. 
---
Do u sell plans too? 
---
Yep. Only Raider comes at 15 and I have a full set for 300
---
Is it the soldier that comes in green or orange? I‚Äôll take the black one if you don‚Äôt have or aren‚Äôt able to make one in a green variant.
---
This is what I‚Äôve come up with so far:
---
[his](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d93358f&amp;d=l71p02pc2sd2su2s01sp1a72as2a00a30l12lt2lk2lv2ce0cd1lr0eo2so2ib4pq1pj0&amp;w=ic4pe2l62&amp;n=His)     Lucky Blast ‚Äòn Boomin‚Äô SOB
---
[hers](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=66993cb&amp;d=sb2p02a72a81ab0af0ai0a30l71la2lt2l12i12ck0cf2el2eo2eh2pb2sg2cc2ce0ap2&amp;w=pe2sa2l92l22&amp;n=Her)     Thick-skinned Flesh-eating Medic
---
The first paragraph is highly subjective and IMO flat out wrong. There are dozens of games that I have personally played and dumped 70+ hours into on my PS4 alone. And most if not all were better to play than fo76 and of better value. 
---
Microtransactions work when the game is free to play. If developers charge you a full triple A price I expect every weapon armor item level quest hairstyle shirt etc in the game at launch for what I paid. Charging full price for a game not worth it (in many people‚Äôs opinions) and then charging them $20 for a digital paint job for an armor is extremely egregious and insulting to the customer. 
---
Do you mean cuz there‚Äôs no ending? Or no waypoints?
---
You can also extract the ore from Gorge Junkyard,
---
Where am I wrong? Argument. Enlighten me. Correct my bullshit: ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not true all leaders in the game are females‚Äù. Citing facts. Save me. 
---
Lol, first thing I thought. 
---
Lol. Sure perhaps, it still reads funny though.
---
Person A) stating bad thing happening to them
---
 Person B) bad thing happening to me too!
---
Person A) OK, I'm glad bad thing happen to you too
---
;)
---
I think both üòê
---
No waypoints i have all holotapes...
---
Lol females don‚Äôt Hate men, huh? women don‚Äôt want men as slaves, huh? You know nothing. Because you‚Äôre next to virgin probably. 
---
Women see males as slaves. It‚Äôs fact. 
---
I've been wanting to make a post about this too. After making a sneaky/vats type build, it's really annoying. 
---
It seems enemies find you instantly even when you're invisible and haven't even fired a single shot. Then you're in caution status forever afterwards. 
---
I was on top of a building, by The Top of the World, and somehow a mole miner saw me while I was invisible. I have Escape Artist and I went to the other side of the building and on a spot where they would never see me but after 5 minutes. I was still in danger status. 
---
This issue came up 2 patches ago. I feel it's not being brought into the light since melee and low health builds are the only viable, high damage builds that players use. 
---
Still suspended with no proof. Deleted everything Bethesda on my PS4 this morning
---
It's just a visual bug, the values don't change in the pipboy but class freak actually works for it. That's why there's not a post about it every hour reminding the devs. IIRC it comes out to ~8% extra damage taken.
---
Sort of.  As far as completing the main quest is concerned, you don't have to bomb Fissure Site Prime directly.  You can leave Drop Site C2 out of it and the Scorchbeast Queen will fight you there, if you don't have Power Armor.
---
25% commission of course haha
---
All of this sounds amazing. Really nice mix of new features and content. Super excited for all of this! 
---
https://help.bethesda.net
---
Was just on a server where there was two nukes one after the other all was fine a part for the SQ body disappeared.
---
About 5 of each flux at all times 
---
Anyone else looking to sell this outfit? 
---
Same boat as you. I'm done with them now. 
---
I love the idea of a FO3 remake, the problem is that with Bethesda and their ancient engine it will still look out of date.  With FO76 I have totally lost faith in Bethesda, okay they look like they might be on the right track now but we really can't forget the whole way the fans have been treated this last fee months... 
---
They need their next release to be an absolute showstopper, not another half assed Fallout title. Seriously Bethesda, take your time and make Starfield or Elder Scrolls VI amazing, that is about the only way you can start to repair your reputation.
---
It‚Äôs open ended. I believe, for future updates.
---
So you see a claim followed by a long list of facts to back it up, stop reading altogether and call the commenter a dumb fuck.
---
Great contribution lad
---
Updated the post to say that the third did not change in durability. It inherited the durability of the other two when they were at 40%. Not sure if it's supposed to work that way, but that's what happened.
---
It's not my responsibility to educate you, friendo. Just letting you know, getting all anti feminism/female is a slippery slope to a lot of other bad things. Open your mind, not your mouth.
---
Ok so there is now way getring the mission completed atm?
---
Yeah it's really sad. Thankfully I had some foresight and boredom; my first character was a stealth sniper, but my new main is a heavy gunner/melee. The TSE nerf didn't kill the stealth sniper build, but the lack of ability to actually stealth sure did.
---
Hardened receiver..suppressor (it's a silencer so the surrounding enemies won't really notice unless they are close to whomever u are shooting) and u will need to make a scope as well..u will need to unlock most gunsmith perks..I believe 4 out of 5 I maxed them..but 4 will do
---
I should add the herd mentality displays -1 special with class freak but it's actually 0, +0 when alone, +2 in a group.
---
So you too decided to not read the comment before giving your input? Were you upset by the claim or?
---
Correct. I‚Äôm pretty sure you get ATOM for getting the 17th holotape though.
---
I've got three, Country Roads, Wouldn't it be Nice, and 16 Tons.  Although Dark as a Dungeon and Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition are close.
---
I'm having this same issue on Xbox. And yeah, I've tried to drop a lot of holotapes and tried both computers. Any other ideas?
---
Ok thank you for the response!
---
Hahahahha. What an argument. You‚Äôre right and so educated. 
---
Bad things like what? That they want to eliminate anyone who knows the truth. Thanks for proving my point. 
---
Lol a mafia threat. ‚ÄòGetting anti feminist is a slippery slope‚Äù. Violent fuck. 
---
Besthesda introduce bug (because it is and they haven't said anything about this) 2 patches ago that makes your character's food and water to go down faster than before. With no mutations or diseases to cause you to lose food or water faster than normal. 
---
Im uncertain if they are aware of it but I've seen people complain about this quite often but it's died off. Just like the sneaking issue. 
---
Nope. Still "temp" banned as of this morning. 
---
So thr cannibal perk for hers is interesting but it looks like a great setup for a new player and someone who doesn't typically play games like these. Yours looks similar to my build but mine is high intelligence instead of perception. I like them.
---
If you think a new engine with a new, unfamiliar toolchain will result in *fewer* bugs, I'm sorry to report that that's not how game development goes. 
---
Yes it is a slippery slope precisely because it‚Äôs true that women want to destroy men. You‚Äôre proving my point. Congrats. 
---
That's what I thought. But from my experience, they can sometimes go all out - I'll be inside and hear a chorus of turrets opening up on some enemy. Maybe this is the bug then.
---
On the other hand, they shouldn't need spotlights during daylight. And I have several oil standing lamps spread around my CAMP near the turrets on the upper level. If they only need light, these should be more than adequate.
---
Also, turrets found in the world can easily identify you and shoot you from farther away than your built ones can with enemies (from experience). Based on how much of your budget your turrets occupy, we shouldn't be getting watered down (AI wise) turrets in our CAMP/Workshop.
---
I had the same at level 200, but sometimes there's Gutsies. The 2 last patches seemed to up their spawn rate.
---
You are wrong. You shouldn't be attacked by the robots. I finish the quest first so I can trade without being robot harassed.
---
Isn't that the truth. 
---
Shotty and enforcer. Knee cap them, then finish them off before they get up.
---
Lol open my mind to what? To not see the facts and to lies? How about you open your mind to the facts, moron. 
---
This is a list I find myself agreeable to.  And I don't know how it is that I love those first two when I hate John Denver's *Country Roads* and I've always disliked The Beach Boys.  But this game has me loving both of them.
---
I do miss *End of the World* from Fallout 4, though.
---
Yes it would be in your power to educate me if you were right on anything. Which you aren‚Äôt. 
---
I think they can appear on only few places.
---
This is a weak troll. Funny to an extent. Embarrassed I didn't notice sooner but whatever, we live and learn. Have a great day.
---
Nice to meet you mr. Ferguson I would like to invite you to visit the town friends and I have created on Fallout 76 on the Xbox. I'm going to add you to my friends list and go looking for you as I think you would fit in well with the Village of the great Mothman.
---
TEH RED ZMAN
---
I'm arguing with him too, but I'm done. I think he's just looking to argue with somebody. He makes videos too 
---
https://youtu.be/UTC4gMxivII
---
Dude, be patient
---
Nah. I‚Äôm right and you have no arguments. 
---
You know nothing, that‚Äôs the truth. 
---
Open your ass to females enslaving you. Oh you already did that. Fucking moron. 
---
The one at lighthouse could not be killed.
---
I‚Äôd love another supplier
---
WS nuke zones have been dead..but sometimes they are crazy..past couple have nights I've gotten lucky..last night I got a 2* zealots handmade from one of the glowing ones
---
I have Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw maxed out, along with Weapon Artisan maxed out for repairing.  I rarely have to repair them now, but it sure would be nice to have those Gunsmith/LOTD perk slots open for more fun stuff.
---
So just a quick update,
---
I wiped my SSD and installed a fresh copy of Windows 1809 and installed just the bare minimum I needed to get the game working:
---
- Windows
---
- AMD Chipset Drivers
---
- NVIDIA drivers
---
- Sound Blaster Z Drivers
---
- Intel Network Adapter Drivers
---
- MSI Afterburner &amp; RivaTuner Statistics Server (so I can monitor the FPS precisely)
---
- Bethesda Launcher &amp; the game itself.
---
Same thing happens.  Terrible overall performance and regular FPS drops even when doing nothing and nothing is going on around me. 
---
This is obviously some kind of server issue, but am surprised more people are not having this issue. :/
---
Oh no. I can't even bring myself to click the link. He's clearly a troll. A shit troll, but a troll still.
---
Dude do it hahahaha
---
That‚Äôs not me at all, just sayin‚Äô. It might look like you actually know it‚Äôs me. It isn‚Äôt. Fuck you insane fuck. You have no arguments btw. 
---
I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll be buying the plan for that soon though. 
---
I obviously read the whole thing, since the complaints about inventory management come after the claims of unplayability  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Sure, the game has bugs, but wild, whiny hyperbole doesn't do your argument any favors. 
---
Thank you! I thought I was going crazy. People‚Äôs camps were missing floors and I would just fall through them.
---
Lol you don‚Äôt have a point. What‚Äôs your belief? Man-hating doesn‚Äôt exist or it‚Äôs not an issue? Those are not valid arguments at all and that‚Äôs a fact. 
---
Yeah, honestly I love both versions of Country Roads, and The Beach Boys is nostalgic for me because when I was a kid one of my favorite shows growing up was Full House, even though I barely qualify as a 90's kid.  I seriously miss some of the songs from Fallout 4 though, loved listening to It's All Over But the Crying, figures theybreused Butcher Pete which is one of my least favorite songs in the game though.
---
The video isn‚Äôt me, fucktards. He made it up. You‚Äôre psychopaths. 
---
lol why do you say it‚Äôs me with no basis. 
---
All u gotta say is u like it..who cares if ppl bash the game..never bothered me one bit 
---
Right. For stating facts. You‚Äôre clearly a female or a slave of one like man. Certainly not a man like I am. A sexy man you can dream of being, and that guy in the video too. 
---
Keep In mind most players would be around 200 hp
---
I loved sending calls to you guys when I worked Warranty Exchange. Often they'd let us listen in on the calls as a learning experience (while on mute) if we were on the track to be a retention/res desk employee in the future.
---
Damn that‚Äôd be so sick! 
---
I reckon you should wait until the first DLC drops, just in case it's underwhelming.
---
Do not do this. It will stop working again once you relog.
---
don't insult or curse in messages. 
---
Invest in that recipe 
---
You'll always be a victim until you outgrow your victim mentality
---
Just so you know, you can‚Äôt find any T60 lower than 40. T45 starts at 25 and T51b starts at 30.
---
Just north of the Overseer‚Äôs Camp
---
I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm gonna wait and hope bathesda fixes this. There‚Äôs no way they don‚Äôt know about it by now. Thanks for the advice though man!
---
No problem!
---
There‚Äôs no paints available for X-01 other than Atom shop, base and Prototype. You can not reapply Prototype if you take it off. 
---
Was definitely going for the Used Car Salesman look, Thanks!
---
It should return when you re-enter PA, unless you fill that spot with something else.
---
Why not both? I'm a dude though, just an average dude with an average life but whatever I guess. You're entertaining me while I look for a show to watch on Netflix.
---
Includes the frame. If I can make the mod, and you can supply the mats, I‚Äôll make it for you cheap. 
---
Yup. 
---
I want to give you the t60 stuff to complete a t45 rig
---
I can craft a stock level 45 lever that does 145 DMG.
---
This Berserker with a hardened receiver does 155 DMG with no armor on. It does 93 DMG when I get in power armor.
---
The legendary effect is not working properly.

If you take the workshop at the giant red excavator, forgot the name, after you fire it up and defend it for 20 min, you get a tone of black titanium and other minerals.  It wasn't obvious to me at first but all the minerals end up at the end of the conveyor belt in a metal box.  But easiest way I think is to just go around killing mole miners.  
---
I think you're a little optimistic about it being $40.
---
I expect if this is true it'll be a full-priced game. The question of how modernised the game will be the true question. FO4 aiming/combat mechanics? Modding systems from either of the later-released games? Time will tell, if all this is true.
---
You gotta wait some more me thinks. 
---
I‚Äôll help if I can
---
Yeah good call I will probably do that 
---
Roger that. I‚Äôve got a new character I‚Äôm working on so I‚Äôll hit you up tonight if your on. 
---
You‚Äôre tarded and that‚Äôs a fact. You have no arguments and have proved my point. 
---
Yes an average dude who is a sub-human, not a man. And a slave of women. And an ignorant fool. 
---
I don't think it's much to do with Fallout. A remaster wouldn't do much more than mods could do and a proper remake isn't worth the trouble.
---
Todd Howard also said that they're not fond of remakes, with Skyrim SE being an exception as it was part of the process in making Fallout 4. Something along the lines of, you can just play them as is. 
---
Yeah took a lot of searching to find pieces before I started. I was a huge armor collector in Fallout 4 and thought this would be a fun shop to run. 
---
open your pipboy, go to misc quests, select the "retrieve your loot" marker. 
---
Lol an average American moron. I‚Äôm way above you, idiot. 
---
300, I have a couple. I‚Äôll be on then too
---
Id love all of this.
---
I think it's anti-armour explosive.
---
It was a meme about the 900 hour guy.... He wrote the post after he was banned and then followed it up with a banned post.. 
---
edgy
---
T51b is my armor of choice! 100 per piece.
---
I‚Äôve thought about it before just to make some extra shekel by selling serums but I don‚Äôt feel I should have to wipe all of my mutations and make new ones every time I log in because bathesda broke their game lol. 
---
This man sells. 
---
"Oh you're gonna come protect me for free, well while you're here, we got some sick ass deals for that suit you got there."
---
No you.
---
Alright, I‚Äôll save up and contact you when I‚Äôm ready!
---
Nah, you. 
---
Good to see a voice of reason in here. I think the chance of a F3 remaster is extremely slim. Seeing as the release date is end of this year (might very well be placeholder and indicate a 2020 release), another possibility would be a future expansion for 76.
---
If I have the plans as extra from what I‚Äôve picked up, I would sell them. But I did not get in on duping and therefore don‚Äôt have a ton of plans to sell. 
---
Its actually a minor glitch. Most bots shouldnt attack you but some will occasional spawn bugged.
---
For example i can kill a bot in front of another bot and that bot may become aggressive or it might just watch and walk off.
---
The bot will spawn aggressive and attack you while other bots wont.
---
However aggressive or not they will appear red instead of yellow always.
---
But the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù you upload doesnt actually fix the bots it simply, it states so somewhere in the quest (forget where) but basically it tells you that the virus that made them evil cant be fixed but you can set yourself as the admin to them (like the guy did that turned them evil) so they wont attack you at least but will attack everything else still.
---
I assume this is why they are still red labeled as enemies and why some of them still attack you occasionally
---
Detroit Become Human
---
I can make Soldier, Knight, and Officer underarmor. Unfortunately, I believe the Knight is supposed to be that olive green color, but it looks just like the Soldier. It‚Äôs bugged. 
---
I‚Äôll check it out!
---
Sounds like something a raider would say.
---
How much for a full set of xo-1 at lvl 50?
---
Cool man
---
Just in white springs or everywhere you walk?  
---
For me (and testing) it's everywhere 
---
Really?  
---
Odd, I'll give that a try, odd it would effect one character and not another!
---
&gt; Todd has repeatedly stated that he's not a big fan of remastering their earlier games as long as they can be played on modern hardware 
---
I don't know if you've tried to play 3 recently...
---
Thanks is for proving my point and facts. You have no arguments. 
---
Women do do want to dominate men, the political climate is highly feminist, anyone denying this is a troll. 
---
I'm sure there are some Wikihow articles on how to coherently troll someone on the internet. You started strong but you started slipping. 3/10 friendo
---
He likes to go hide underground too.
---
Nah, you.
---
Yes - I only know because I get constant notifications when friends post to GTA group and I've never played that game.
---
That sucks. Thanks for letting us know. I simply repeated what I'd heard, and it sounded right.
---
Not really, in my experience.
---
Tesla is great (I use it on one of my characters) but there is nothing like watching a sledgehammer wielding super mutant kill himself in 2 swings when wearing reactive plates
---
Her build is based on her being a tough-as-nails medical professional in real life.  The cannibalism is only a suspicion of mine at this point though.  She likes the cooking scenes in the show Hannibal a bit too much.
---
I've gotten the recipes for my favorite mutations just so i know I can craft the serums as I please..never sold any serums ever..I've given some away tho
---
https://massivelyop.com/2018/10/17/zenimax-online-studios-is-hiring-for-a-project-based-on-an-exciting-new-ip/
---
I did this before. I jumped into the pit and lose my loot. Someone told that you have to get close and drop something and the loot will be in the bag
---
That‚Äôs the best description I‚Äôve seen in a very long time, good job
---
I‚Äôve sold my last one. However, I‚Äôd be willing to make one cheap if you really want. You supply the materials.
---
That is not true, the damage returned is before reduction. 
---
There is a PvP exploiting using reactive plates that can cause a passive player to get an instant bounty
---
I have a suit of level 40 X01 I‚Äôll sell for 400
---
Where? Not sure there are microwaves in Fallout.
---
Shit, in a lot of cases they have to renew those licenses for old games. And they never really do. Mafia 1? Most music removed from game, was unavaliable for purchase on Steam for nearly 5 years. Alan Wake? Same thing, but Remedy actually paid for renewal.  Just because they used a song in 3, not only does it not mean they can use it in 76, it does not even mean they can use it in 3, forever.
---
Royaltiea are where the music industry itself makes it's bread.
---
Good to know. Thank you.
---
Question:  Is your avatar wearing an atomic shop outfit?  
---
If so, you likely have one or more mods installed, and have not updated your Fallout76Custom.ini file. 
---
Check this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asd5dl/psa\_to\_fix\_missing\_atom\_shop\_itemstextures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asd5dl/psa_to_fix_missing_atom_shop_itemstextures/)
---
It actually does -0.5 but the display of attributes can't handle decimals and rounds them up. When combined with Healing Factor which makes chems also have fractional attribute bonuses the -0.5 from Herd Mentally has a visible impact.
---
Yup. Licensing music is excessively costly.
---
If we look at a single point alone, the fact that level scaling makes it so a newcomer or under leveled person has to server hop or quest around people in order to actually progress, most people would agree the game is at best a chore, unless you happen to be one of the people who has been playing it a ton. 
---
And that's just one of the points there, and that list I made isn't half full of the issues in the game.
---
But die on your hill and think I'm just whining
---
Thanks!  I need to check and see what I need. I‚Äôm a low level player but I really want to finish my set of T-45 that I bought a bunch of mods for as well as my Raider set cause I love the junky look of it. I think I only need one piece for that one. As one other redditor put it: I‚Äôm tired of tromping around in my Low Budget Bumblebee set LOL. Although I think they were referring to the ability to modify paint on the excavator set. But I digress. 
---
Hmm interesting take. 
---
This happens so much that I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a feature rather than a glitch...
---
No, I have no mods installed. I had to delete the entire Fallout 76 folder because it told me I needed 50 GB update the game even though it was already installed. I tried doing what was in that thread and it didn't work.
---
Where‚Äôs your argument? You didn‚Äôt prove me wrong at all. Your reaction just indicates that I have a point and you need to be in denial. Any competent psychologists knows that. You have lost, but I don‚Äôt care about winning. I just wat the truth. And you seem to not know it. I wish. 
---
But I want to have my cake and eat it too! 
---
Damm. Someone still dumb enough to shill for a self admitted cheater?
---
Oof.
---
Why not just make a bucket on the roof to catch him?
---
There‚Äôs also a little camp site near West Tek (forget the name) that has a map in one of the tents. The map has pins that point to some of these locations, like the crashed space station.
---
Might be something more to find there. I stumbled upon it yesterday but didn‚Äôt get to explore too much before I had to go
---
This happened to me today. I had to scrap the turret. 
---
I'm ps4 but initial download takes forever 
---
I'll take whatever violet you have for 40 each?
---
Oh my. I'll be hitting you up next time I'm on to kit me and the missus out. Been hitting the spawns all this week and been given everything except what I actually want. Caps aplenty though.
---
If you happen to remember the name of a player on that server, search them out and join their game.
---
Your bag won't be marked anymore so you'll have to hunt your death location for it.
---
ha!  i played trombone in a symphonic band, so classical has always been a favorite of mine.  i did not bring it up here, as i did not think there were very many classical lovers here.
---
grieg's morning mood is one of my favorite classicals.  it is my ringtone on my s8 galaxy!!  lol
---
fo4 was my first fps ..after practice ..u wil be fine 
---
I have some power armor pieces to sell you. They are just weighing me down. At least 15 sets. I'll look you up. My GT is ThatGirlKraKra
---
Max lead belly
---
Either way I'm not buying it tbh. Not after spending $60 on 76 and them not bothering to try and fix half the shit. 
---
Bots on outside in streets and area won‚Äôt attack you, inside is a totally different story even after the quest.
---
Blizzard. Blizzard does a collector's edition of a remaster. (Digital only, goodies for other blizz games, 40 bucks, so not exactly the same, but it does happen.)
---
yep, when it was new i had to send out a mass message to tell the to stop spamming it every 5 min or get deleted lol.
---
Yes.  Experienced that yesterday.
---
I check the military wing and never fine more than 2 tech data. Where is the rest of it that everyone always send to find.
---
Okay. I posted about this before. But in the challenges menu, there's a list of challenges linked to destroying robots with various weapons. Each total amount is a string of 1s and 0s. But in binary you need 8 digits to be translatable. These are all 4 digit numbers, I am not close enough to the total to see if there are more tiers, but I was thinking this could lead to something else. 
---
Where is the last death icon..should be there..if someone else picked it up it would tell u..also if u pick up other loot before u get the bag can create a problem
---
Sounds legit, I'm gonna try it.
---
Same
---
Can you go back there and reply back screenshots? Also is the name of the location by chance, ‚ÄúInvestigator‚Äôs Cabin‚Äù?
---
I might have to but at this point I‚Äôm holding off from playing as I can‚Äôt get food fast enough. 
---
Same Haha
---
For me this just started after the recent patch.  
---
Bruh there's literally food everywhere I have 100 soup in my inventory 
---
Damn, you're not on PC :(
---
If I have it, and you have pieces to trade, I'll take a look at what you've got!
---
I think it's related to how many people are in the area. When I am soloing the WS Golf club, they load quickly. If I do the same (or Uranium Fever) with 2-3 other people, it takes a minute or two to load.  If I do SBQueen with 10-12 others, forget about it!
---
I reeeeeaaaally want to know this info too...but, because this is the feature I've wanted the most in the game, I'm really just content with waiting for them to release official info. 
---
I totally understand the want for more info, we just have to be patient. It was driving me crazy trying to think of the different ways this legendary trader would work :P.
---
This. I load up until I'm completely full. I can carry enough to Max out all the venders in one trip picking Flora.
---
Oh I think I know what‚Äôs happening.
---
Isn‚Äôt it that the longer you take the more bots are coming?
---
How did you get so far into the main quest at level 35?
---
Nah it‚Äôs different. Next time I play I can get a bunch of photos. Wishing I could remember the name of the place.
---
I‚Äôve been to investigator‚Äôs cabin though and was fascinated by it. Hoping we get to read his log entries one day.
---
That's cool!
---
Pedantic, much? It's a phrase of commiseration.
---
It's expressing relief that the issue isn't relegated solely to him.
---
In other words, he's saying; "Thank fuck it is not my PC/console breaking or something."
---
But you already knew that, probably.
---
How about a pistol slinger build? Or are we all forced into melee/heavy? 
---
Thanks! All the negativity around 76, I thought I'd do what I love  (collecting power armor) and combine it with a can-do attitude, and get a little creative. I'm kinda overwhelmed at the positive reaction
---
I could see it fun as overwatch 76.  Team deathmatch sounds fantastic.  Could to capture the flag, transport the vehicle, etc. Farm guns and ammo and chems in the main game and burn it in the other game. Could bring in new players.
---
#"BE ASSIMILATED OR BE DESTROYED"
---
I remember that. This game had a weird launch. 
---
Hell if I know, I just followed the quests been playing solo
---
Same here. It's like Step Brothers trying to figure out what to do with all their room for activities. I can and will be patient I was just fishing for a comment from the devs on here. Every now and again they reply with more info on posts talking about updates so maybe theres a bit more with this was my thought. 
---
neve spout off in message. my fav response to people who send me "fan mail" ,"thank you for violating the coc"
---
I'm not seeing the harm in it either buddy.  Too many 76 purests that take pride that they're in of a handful who play the game still.
---
It would be sick if the fo3 remaster included the settlement system from fo4 :)
---
If it's essentially FO3 in FO4's engine, I can live with it being $60, but I don't see Bethesda putting in the effort to update the game like that. It's probably going to be the same game, flaws and all (maybe they'll add iron sights but even that I'm not convinced would be added) with better textures and lighting.
---
I haven‚Äôt had this problem, PS4 
---
Kinda defeats one of the main points of this being a Fallout game don't ya think? The series is barely hanging on to its RPG-ness as it is.
---
In fallout 3 there was a side quest to help a lady named Agatha I think, once completed you could access her station which was all really moody violin pieces. It fit amazingly well into the that very grim world. The Fallout franchise has expanded my musical taste quite a bit. I drive Uber and Lyft on the side and always have it tuned to 40's Junction on SXM and people generally seem to enjoy it. Anyway, going to listen to some Grieg now.
---
"Was" an exploit I think they "fixed" it
---
Find where it's falling through and put something solid up there
---
You must have been playing with blinkers and didn‚Äôt get distracted from anything no?
---
On my last char I made an effort to stay on course of the main quest and ended around level 45 at Officer on Deck.
---
You gotta power the spotlight 
---
Make an indoor garden in that location with open sky light so he falls into the vegetation
---
Sorry! After today I might have to pick up a PC copy. It's been an interesting afternoon!
---
ever sense the 2s and explosive nerf they brake like 3x as fast
---
Ya
---
üëç nice
---
Totally legit. I won't lie, I made almost the exact same post as you when it was announced. I got all the same answers, haha!
---
It's really weird, I think this Wild Appalachia bit, (specifically the whole legendary system tweak) is the most excited I've ever been for something video-game related.
---
Ha same. That happened to me when i came out of the vault
---
Yeah they do! 
---
gctttttttüòÄüòÉ
---
Xx
---
Combat armor doesn't need any more buffs.....
---
In-game, why would a human wear normal armor in a nuke zone? Out of the game narrative you probably just want to keep your Unyielding effect, but it makes little sense.
---
The mechanic of hazmat or PA is fine and, even though I tried boosting RR to walk nukes without PA, I would like to keep the PA requirement.
---
Thanks for the comments. So if my paper bag is still there in some server, I can just hop from server to server (expecting to join by luck on the same server) or do this thing about asking to recent players to join with them.
---
I was just doing the first approach (hoping from server to server), but as my junk was lost in a kind-of random area I don't know if I'm searching on the wrong location or simply all is already lost because of my game crashing (or simply I'm not able to join in the same server up to this moment).
---
 So this was the reason I made this question, to see if there is still some hope.
---
Why?  It would be a different game mode from the main game?  I think a team deathmatch in fallout 76 would be great.
---
Just level up.
---
How much is a jet pack for x-o1?
---
Haha nice
---
Look, nobody is going to be entertained by everything; if the game isn't for you, cut your losses and play something else. You'll make the money back, but you'll never get the time back. And to spend *even more* time here complaining about how the game doesn't entertain you just compounds the issue. 
---
I'm on my third alt; I'm well familiar with being low level. Is it annoying when a high-level upgrades the whole area? Yes. Is server-hopping or going somewhere else instead a big deal? No. But if that's the straw that breaks the camel's back for you, there are plenty of other games out there. Try *Anthem*, I hear it's entirely problem-free and released to universal acclaim. 
---
Yup. Kneecaps work great. Best part is when a heavy weapons mutant goes down he switches to the pipegun. Easy peasy
---
I don‚Äôt have this issue on PS4
---
WELL YOU CAN'T.
---
Ah yeah I saw a glowing snally at white springs and was so scared lol
---
I have gone through a significant portion of my food in just 15 minutes.  There might be food everywhere but if the only thing I can do is gather ingredients, cook and eat then that leaves no time to do anything else.  I‚Äôll wait until this gets resolved and/or move on to another game for a while as most MMOs are filled with issues early on. 
---
Me too that and the vault raids coming. 
---
I am also from Logan! I was so hoping when I got this game that there would be some mention of Mamie Thurman.  I'd love to see 22 Mountain added to the map! 
---
What does it say?
---
I‚Äôm so excited for this, thank you!
---
Ha! If you call a level 54 a cheater, I‚Äôm pretty awful at cheating then, it was a joke, referencing all the crap that‚Äôs gone on this week about someone playing 900 hrs and getting banned or something ridiculous like that. 
---
In would headshot from a distance with the hunting rifle then if a group gets close, would toss a grenade and then finish them off with the handmade or combat rifle.
---
.....ffffffffine.....
---
Beat way I've found is at the eastern penitentiary and just go around and collect the tin cans should be 9 traps which = 81 lead and 192 steel each run and you can sever hop to restet them
---
Lucky hole mine. Use excavator PA for best results 
---
If it is a FO3 remaster then the capitol wasteland project pmuch just face palmed to the moon.
---
I didn't call you a cheater.
---
The 900 hours guy was.
---
I was just pointing out that your "joke" doesn't work.
---
That'd be kind of weird since Todd said the oldness was part of the games charm and didnt want to touch that, but maybe that interview question made him realize how good of an idea it would be, especially to recover from a rough launch for 76
---
Probably had friends help set it up ;P
---
This kind of challenge is easy to boost/cheat, though: you can bulk and then scrap the required materials as often as you need to hit those numbers. But ‚Äì shhh! ‚Äì don't tell anyone! ;-)
---
He asks you if he's scary and complains that he's hungry.
---
Lol. Stop. 
---
So you saying if I told you my significant other got murdered,  and you tell me yours got murdered too, that you think me responding by telling you I'm glad your person got murdered too is a phrase of commiseration?
---
Sharing the unfortunate event and being comforted by other people who have gone through similar events is one thing...  but you wouldn't go around saying you are GLAD its happening to other people too. 
---
I got aids 
---
Shit me too! :( 
---
I'm glad you got aids too!
---
-high five -  
---
Haha
---
Thanks for making a big deal out of an 'lol' comment. 
---
Well this sucks.
---
Jesus christ. Smoke a joint.
---
rcayton1
---
I'm really tired of this. 
---
I thought a roof would be solid. What is more solid than that?
---
It's also possible it's spawning slightly below the roof. I have never seen it fall from higher than the top leaf of the plant in the first screenshot. I assumed I was just always missing it when it spawned, but maybe it is only originating from head height.
---
Which is also bs.  Why not make it scale to the player level or be static to the region?  I‚Äôd rather know not to go to Grafton because its enemies are too strong than have to guess if an area is safe to travel to.  What I should never have to do is load into a fight with multiple enemies at twice my level and then keep getting placed back into the same server when I try to hop out if that server. 
---
Go to the fire department building and pick up the ~200+ pounds of dumbbells and scrap them
---
Bwahahaha!! I figured a medic build would be perfect for her. It leans toward natural instinct. She will probably enjoy what happens when she initiated cannibal though. If not, use the +HP Jesus card. Can never remember the name of the perk though i use it in all fallout games.
---
Sad to see all these people defending this dead fetus of a game, shame.
---
Converted Munitions factory, or just farm lead and make em yourself.
---
5 min ago tops , just in time to read your silly response and kill my buzz ;)
---
I never needed hope, most people didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre just being influenced by the extreme negativity in this sub 
---
Yeah. Sure. Move to heroin then.
---
Do you have ironclad or barbarian on? That would reduce the damage on berserker. 
---
I havent checked my berserker knuckles recently to see if its not adding damage like you are describing, but reducing damage getting in power armor is how its supposed to work
---
Where would this be? I would find this SUPER useful for completing  my T-45. If this is an actual thing you set up, please notify me so!
---
There is a lead extractor with water in the North West area.
---
South of the crash spaceship.
---
Near that area are 2 total Lead Deposits and 1 Junk.
---
You're choice on Lead and Water or Lead and Junk.
---
You should see a small forest area. Close by to the west is the water.
---
Thanks man! Shit I can't wait to get online now!! 
---
We should do it together, and than I can tell you I'm glad you do heroin too! 
---
Just get to level 25 and find out‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt need it immediately.
---
I take it back. You don't have the spare brain cells to be doing drugs.
---
And Morrison‚Äôs Drive In is superior to Hillbilly Hot Dogs!
---
People say this all the time but does it work? I've tried and only seem to get the option to add them as friend, not join their server.
---
What it truly needs is an escape from Tarkov mode where you reach the end of the map which will give you a prompt to explore the outer areas of Virginia and depending the amount of food and water you bring the larger of an RNG area is made but they can also contain pests animals or creatures living there but it could also be another way to actually implement real NPCs in the game for there being raiders that shoot on sight or peaceful people you could out right kill or trade with. Keep in mind there should be junk lying around you can pick up, hidden loot where you have to find a code or a key. Also this could be a good opportunity to implement pets such as dogs wolves or brahmin to carry your new found loot but this could also be bad because the pvp in the game isn‚Äôt balanced by any means rn. But this could also be for solo players so they can queue up solo or with a group if they want. I honestly feel this would be good for this game...
---
My issue now is do I keep things for player vending or the legendary vendor! Aaarrghh!
---
If you play fallout on the PS4 you need to join this page. It's the only auction system ready to help you move your gear or help you find the gear you're looking for.

---
Could be an expansion, though they did say that all future content releases would be free. Perhaps something to do with private servers?
---
I just heard first hand from my friends who played and said the game was a mess. I loved the whole idea behind FO76 but cant wait for them to flesh things out 
---
This is amazing! I can‚Äôt visit tonight but will keep a close eye out for your next set of opening times!
---
Yea disappointed its on xbox, someone should do this on ps4. Id be a repeat customer for sure haha.
---
Well you have to add them first I think.
---
Not their fault you chose to use some choice words, which you're not supposed to do. I've been there myself dude, right down to the week suspension. It wasn't their fault that I decided to go off in the messages on someone who was being annoying. Take responsibility for your actions, and remember: it's just a game. Don't go off on people for doing PVP or griefing or anything.
---
Yeah my TS(not E) lever action rifle at double condition barely lasts a SBQ fight.
---
In the nuke zone by fissure prime, look for sets of 3 trees, there are usually flash ferns at these spots. They give the raw violet flux. Still needs to be refined, but that's the easiest way to collect it.
---
It's a real thing. I've sold a couple full T45 but still have pieces available. Just north of the Overseer's Camp 
---

This has my explanation of my sneaky pistol build in it, plus some other people's suggestions.
---
Sneak being randomly broken is a pain but hasn't stopped me continuing with it as I have fun with the greater challenge of having a horde of super mutants detect me quickly and make me run for my life.
---
Tip if you carry a lot of junk around all the time, open social menu when you enter a server and take a screenshot (easy on PS4 at least). 
---
But even then, much safer to play with a friend for easier rejoining. 
---
I finally got it to work.

I had to put regular armor on and take it off again and it finally acknowledged that I wasn't wearing armor.
---
Bugthesda. Just make sure if you're running Berserker that the game is actually giving you the correct DMG.
---
I'm a PC user, but I'm told there are ways of playing it on both XB1 and PS4. On PC I know the Steam version is troublesome, but I had good luck playing with the GoG version (though I did find the gameplay incredibly clunky compared to Fallout 4 and stopped after ~10 hours).
---
Then we might see Muldraugh and West Point from Project Zomboid, that'd be neat!
---
Nah, it's fine because you can go at your own pace.  If you have any questions, just post them in this sub.  I'm 40 and am far from a hardcore gamer and really like this game.
---
I don't have anymore, sorry. I may have a couple friends I can get one or two from though. 
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. All I use is two shots! Time to diversify, thanks for the heads up!
---
If you get anything please let me know! I can‚Äôt ever find it 
---
Shit, is Orange Coloured Sky gone too? When did they remove that one?
---
Kinda why I'm after a little more info to be honest. 
---
Thanks I appreciate it. I just need some for crafting stuff. Tried a few nukes zones lately but they must have buffed as the raw flux wasn't there 
---
Any 'Power Up' event within the first three times. (Barring bugs, of course)
---
The only real Fallout game wasn't Fallout. We're reaching r/fallout levels here boys.
---
This is beyond '*its not a fallout game*' usual levels lol
---
Loved the pic for us! Awesome to hear there is a team down under. (rynobiwan, PS4)
---
Fantastic sales pitch. Take my upvote, you magnificent bastard.
---
Lucky hole mine
---
Take your ExPA to farm lead
---
That's the first logical assesment of 76's issue I've read on Reddit.
---
No. The game treats the HP missing because of rads as damage. 
---
Might I suggest Old World Radio on YouTube? They have interesting DJs and everything!
---
That's not advice, that's discouragement.
---
Or, here me out because this might be hard to do; make a secure password that can't be brute forced.
---
I have a love/hate relationship with the game. Sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it.  Today was a hateful day.
---
As a young father I don‚Äôt get a lot of game time in (about one hour a week) but I‚Äôve been playing since launch and have been trying to enjoy myself even though it‚Äôs a slow grind (I‚Äôm only level 16).   Today I‚Äôm considering giving up and returning to fallout 4 after the following experience:
---
I logged in and was completely frozen without any controls, no movement, pipboy, map, nothing.  A couple of low level scorched started attacking my defenseless avatar so I had no choice but to log out and log back in.  
---
After logging back in and getting my movement restored I begin rebuilding my modestly sized base for the third time.  Once I finished my tiny house, I couldn‚Äôt save the entire structure as a blueprint.  Frustrating since I moved my camp to a low level area so I could build my home without being interrupted.
---
Once I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to save my house I returned to my choice spot (south of the top of the world) to rebuild it there.
---
After traveling there I saw two super mutants walking towards me so I preemptively attacked them with my level 15 newly restored melee weapon.  Strangely enough, my attacks were completely glitching and not doing any damage at all.  I‚Äôm killed easily.
---
After respawning and collecting my brown bag, I spot only one of the two super mutants.  I take out my shotgun since my sword wasn‚Äôt working and kill the super mutant.  But for some reason I begin to take melee damage from an invisible source.  I assume it was the second super mutant but since I couldn‚Äôt see him, it‚Äôs only a guess.  I run to high ground and try to get away from the phantom damage but to no avail, at this point I‚Äôm killed again.  Fuck.
---
A few seconds later  my daughter and wife returned from a play date so I logged out from just one of many frustrating FO76 sessions.
---
So yeah I kind of hate this game.
---
My Bloodied Explosive Double barrel does solid 1300 dmg per shot without any chem buffs. The downside is that Im one ghoul slap away from dying all the time. Bloodied gauss also does 1100 dmg/shot. TBH everything that does over 300 dmg/shot in this game is exaggeration.
---
Who says they are mutually exclusive?
---
Try from higher ground or cover, ideally work out s way yo funnel them through a gap or doorway so you can take them one at a time with headshots or grenades. Or fragmines if you have time to lay them. 
---
Franchise it out, ‚ÄúCrazy TurdFerguson‚Äôs discount power armor! Coming soon to a platform near yoooouuu!!!‚Äù
---
Haha, glad you figured it out. Question is. Will you have to do that everytime you relog (like the 2nd excavator PA bug)
---
I can add some helmet mods or whatever the mod is that gives +2 to strength for t-60
---
I finished the 95% game solo by level 30, the only trick is if you get to a place full of high level enemies, server hop once or twice and they will spawn at your level. That happened to me a lot and it was obnoxious. Secondly, once you get towards the end of one of the quests lines, you are better off with stealth and/or just sprinting. You have to ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù level 50+ large monsters, but don‚Äôt have to fight them if you don‚Äôt want. Best to wait until 50+ to run the silo unless you have help. Good luck!
---
A great many guns in this game break way too quickly. The biggest reason why I haven't bothered with energy weapons is that they break stupidly fast, and that compounds with things like Two Shot. I have a lovely Two Shot Laser that will go from full health to broken in 4 clips.
---
No way there's 25 in there. I just went through with rank 3 pharma farma and got like ... 8. 
---
I got that message today but everytime I try to join another server the game still says that my place is occupied which is not true because there's no other camp builded in that area. 
---
What I was saying in the comments is that his health was full, so the bloodied couldn't have been a factor, so we ruled on exploit.
---
NANI?! 
---
There‚Äôs also the, stalker mothman. Saw it earlier today.
---
On xbox I just remember a name or look under recent players, view their profile and join the game gets me right back on the same server .
---
That is a bummer as I have been steadily taking points away from a build that was originally strength (was tired of melee). When I stopped playing my rifles just didn't seem to be doing nearly enough to survive the high-level places I needed to be. 
---
My buddy who was a level \~36ish melee was dealing more damage than my 72 rifle build. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but most enemies are just massive bullet sponges for me. I have one perk in each rifleman +10% damage line, and also some in shotguns and they aren't keeping up. 
---
I consider my story, and my person, as a kind of benchmark. I'm rather extreme. Its safe to say that if I dont make it through the crossroad on single green light, nobody could pass it in time, as I walk the fastest (I mean, there could be like two guys who walk faster than me, but I havent seen that in action). If I read a book, I usually eat the whole author, I rarely stop before 3k pages if I start. If I play a game, I use the best possible way to gey best possible gear. In Fallout 76, I have as good gear as it gets, and honestly, if not for trading, I wouldn't have set of 7 endgams weapons and full cavalier set. Fuck RNG. The time spent on RNG is time wasted on gambling. Fuck gambling, let us progress.
---
Oh it's glitched to all hell.
---
Check my pip boy......214 DMG
---
Remove evasive perk card check pip boy......155 DMG
---
Reapply evasive perk check pip boy.......155 DMG
---
I swear Bethesda is trying to steer us towards melee builds at every turn.
---
Wish this was on PC!!
---
Mr mystery show your comment literally made me laugh out loud. "Protectron".....processing.....access denied...our records show that you are part of that scetchy other organization...commencing self destruct sequence of this facility.
---
Now i don't know about that but that sounds like a little much to stop you from joining both factions.
---
That‚Äôs not a good idea. 
---
Go to whitesprings and drink from the fountain to clear your disease if you dont have cures. The fou tain is in the gazebo near the tennis courts
---
If the Queen is nuked 'correctly', you can fight her out of the nuke zone, so your 3 star normal armour, is better than power armour. 
---
Yeah I will complain too. Reaching level 50, then 100 is very doable. 
---
Reaching first level 200, then 250, well yeah it's doable too but takes really lots of more exp.
---
Obviously.
---
Rofl
---
It gets weird. I haven‚Äôt tested it extensively, but that spot on the favorites view gets emptied of an icon, and the second PA piece (I hotkey jet packs and emergency protocols torso) gets renamed what the now-missing piece is. 
---
I forgot the /s.  I usually respond like that to any "It iSNt a ReAL FaLloUt GAme" comment I see. 
---
does curing adrenal and getting it again actually work?  I am heavily mutated, and I was just planning on riding it out until it gets fixed officially.
---
Duh? You think we know while you don't? The roadmap was just released few days ago which even mentions this. That's all we got.
---
I just found one in the cafe near Phoenix in watoga - the one in the same building as the comic store wich never has a comic in it.
---
Lucky Break maxed out and Gunsmith maxed out and my TSE never breaks.   It does need to be repaired but not very often.
---
Now, my modded 50 cal and auto grenade launcher are a different matter.   1 decent SBQ run and they are basically trashed. 
---
I'm not, but he asked for advice on how to play solo.
---
Not someone to say "le don't".
---
Ha, me too. Glad I came across the original poster yesterday. 
---
Where are you located that's a heck of a price for a Shop Smith! I'm interested! 
---
Well, if it‚Äôs a bug with berserker, it would affect melee berserker builds as well. 
---
Alrighty, that's good to know, I heard that was a spawn point but was unable to validate myself.
---
If anything, we need passive perks for the stuff we constantly have to swap in and out. Lockpicking, hacking, repairing, that kind of stuff. And it still rubs me the wrong way that jury rigging is NOT in the game.
---
I'm gonna add that in the routine now.
---
didn‚Äôt look hard enough ig
---
Oh good point on spawning below the roof. I wonder if you put a ceiling fan or some kind of solid light up there would that 'block' it from spawning?
---
Try the market subs
---
I just had an  epiphany! My previous camp the turrets were useless. My new one they are quite good. The difference is the turrets are low, and enemies have to come down to attack. So the turrets shoot above the horizon! I have no spotlights. Is this observation shared by anyone? Is this conclusion correct?
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest that upvote smells like pure gasoline.
---
Farm cores by mama dolce's. There is a generator outside the factory, PA in a shed down the hill, a generator in the Chinese bunker and also PA locked in a room, access via a terminal. When I was low on cores I would farm here and grab 4 cores in less than 5 minutes
---
Oh good haha
---
I do wonder here sometimes.
---
I forgot...
---
I have 250+ screws and I never pass a globe or fan up. 
---
Nope. Just killed him an hour ago.
---
Don't die, follow the story. 
---
Throw the weapon bash damage mods on your gun, for non-heavy weapons it's like a 20% increase in weapon condition. Then over repair that gun for 40% longer life span. Forceful stock is the highest condition but the bash + whatever stocks aren't much worse.
---
Same. Especially fans, those have gears
---
Why do you need to buy one.
---
Tony Stark built one in a cave.  WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS
---
What's your point? Are you implying that I'm lying or something?
---
Try it.......if it doesn't affect melee than it doesn't affect melee.
---
It affects the lever rifle......... we've already established that.
---
Me and my sis would REALLY like this. We listen to the Appalachia radio everytime we play. Getting kinda boring to sing same song over and over hah.
---
I tried it yesterday. Got rid of all mutations, then used serums to get them all back. Adrenal reaction works now. 
---
Worked fine for me one time out of one.  For whatever that's worth.
---
How about side quests, I‚Äôm mainly staying away from them right now 
---
Me too damnit! The one time I really want him he is hiding from me.
---
Honestly, if you just want to stockpile random, useable ammo, the scorced areas in The Forrest are good.
---
Clear out the Morgantown Airport and other nearby lowbie scorched or SM bases. Do it with a fire axe, and you'll have upwards of 1k each of 10mm, shells, and .38 ammo.
---
The other answers you got are good if you want to actually farm materials to make ammo.
---
My advice works great at lower levels, you also get a good amount of scrap, keeping in mind how much adhesive and screws you'll need to maintain the better gear you start getting.
---
Nah bro. It's gonna be the same.
---
I also don't expect anything like op perks.it will be more like a brag status( like playing a crapton has ever been brag worthy lol)
---
Back to r/fallout.
---
*bows down* thanks so much, really needed this! 
---
So every game on XB1 is like Monster Hunter World on Steam at launch?
---
Annoying. 
---
I hope they add some new trophies along with these updates 
---
Bait
---
I think it‚Äôs left on the server. I‚Äôve come across a few brown bags where there were tons of stuff inside, such as bulk material and fluxes. So I left it there thinking someone was killed and they will come back to pick it up. Nope after some tour and games when I came back to the area, the bag was still there intact. Only then I realized someone‚Äôs game likely crashed and they will never be able to come back and recover it. This actually happened to me a few times at WS when it was nuked. I lost tons of junk there when my PS4 crashed, such as lots of freshly collected hardened mass. So now I go to my stash as soon as I picked up a few items. 
---
Just inside Whitesprings. I do get hitches sometimes, like a 1s lag, but not actual rubber banding.
---
I‚Äôll give that a shot
---
Huh, there‚Äôs a market? I‚Äôve got a full suit of min and max level of each world-spawn type (T-type and raider) plus a bunch of random parts on an alt. Might have to check the interest on PC
---
It's great fun. On PC here.
---
Nah, can't seek revenge if you have a bounty. Totally safe to headshots someone, snatch their bag, and turn on pacifist.
---
Yes I would love your trash sense of humor along with a dead meme 
---
I‚Äôd be so happy already if they could only fix it so I can repair it to 200% condition.
---
Location is US-13C Biovac. Next time I play I‚Äôll explore it in more detail 
---
It sort of works, it works more than just having the old one lol.
---
Dammit I see this 12 hours too late
---
SAME
---
It all went to shit when that one movie tried a slow clap moment, but the rest of the crowd went full golf clap on the guy and told him to "sit the fuck down and stop clapping!".
---
The two have been interchanged since.
---
It doesn't work.
---
In certain limb OMODs they have used the SET with a value of '0' instead of the ADD modifier on the dtRadiationExposure parameter and once SET to 0 you can ADD a million if you want it will remain '0'.
---
Reported since beta. Unacknowledged and unaddressed.
---
Coule Someone please explain why I found a dead Deathclaw called "Traveling Vendor" in the Cranberry Bog?
---
I've had same problem. Notably with armor that already has rad protection. It seems the effect gets canceled out with such armor.
---
Follow the story does not put you in too much danger at low level. 
---
I still want to use the SAMs to shoot down nukes. Could be a fervent anti-nuke quest line eventually leading to tech to modify a SAM or the load out.
---
i killed the friendly  veribird when i owned poseidon and then my turrets turned on me
---
As someone gone way over level 100 I don't see it quite as flat. Any level up past 100 takes nearly twice as XP according to that. 
---
It would be super cool to be able to use your sets of 50 levels when the feature hits live. That would create a nice objective for some players to try to be level 250 before it goes live.
---
Chicago, near north burbs
---
Why would it?
---
Oooh I may stop by and check you out, I‚Äôm trying to get my friend to come back to the vault and think maybe a bribe of a Low level raider armor may be the ticket.
---
Please be a VR Version for FO3 or FO:NV or FO76. :D
---
You see huge changes to PA regularly? Like what? And ‚Äúnormal‚Äù armor has amazing legendary effect capabilities, that outside of the rad resistance of PA, makes it far more useful than PA. 
---
If you‚Äôre expecting non-legendary normal armor to surpass PA, well, I disagree.
---
Haha rite!!
---
It's a piece by piece bug. Some pieces spawn bugged and can't be fixed, some pieces spawn with it working.
---
Eh, I‚Äôve got the same plans, just don‚Äôt have enough springs
---
Screws, lots and lots of screws.
---
https://www.facebook.com/falloutfm/
---
Haha awesome I know I've been having a blast so far :)
---
follow the marker, find the stuff.
---
If you want the best possible rank of the quest rewards, don't do them until you are level 50. However, this is an MMO kind of game, meaning there will be expansions that will render those obsolete anyways. Plus, a good legendary drop or two and you'll dump the rewards in your stash to remind you of those days when you were still a scared noob, running away from high levels because you thought they'd want to steal your shit or murder you. Seriously, just play the game as you see fit. Nothing is too difficult, not even for solo players.
---
If I had the time and was super creative I would try somthing like this! Maybe when the player vending machines come out.
---
If ur on XB1 I can help u with some supplies or weapons. That way u can take ur time and enjoy the story a bit more. 
---
Pretty sure they said that was a year two+ plus fearure, even before launch.
---
Also pretty sure Hines said explicitly that they would not be 3rd party servers anyway, so they will still technically be Bethesda servers.
---
I'm surprised they didn't put that on the roadmap, knowing how bad people are at comprehending words.
---
The old mutation is now weirdly tied to your hunger/thirst levels. They made an entirely new ‚Äúspell effect‚Äù and newly made serums will use the new spell effect, so removing Adrenal and getting a newly crafted serum will give you the new effect, which should work fine (apparently they tweaked the damage curve a bit too, I haven‚Äôt looked into it much)
---
They've got an app and everything, play any soundtrack from any fallout game. Yer welcome.
---
Run? üòä
---
I feel a bit burnt from that too but 3 is good enough on it's own that I'd happily support it to show THIS is what we want in a game
---
My gunsmith is level 3 and it never used to break this much. Every other time I do a base run, gotta fix my gun. It's more annoying more than anything. I always have plenty of scrap. 
---
You need black titanium, screws, steel, springs, aluminum, and some nuclear material for the torso.
---
So far I think I'm starting the market, judging by the reaction here 
---
Yes and possibly? I mean it's mostly for scorched but an over-repaired buzz is gonna shred them almost instantly anyway. Against players it seems to be basically useless. Either players run around with enough rad resist on their armor to negate the effect or it doesn't proc often enough or strong enough to slot over things like tenderizer and party boy which will do a lot more for your damage.
---
Well you‚Äôve got me sold, I‚Äôve been wanting to get a suit of excavator and have my ultracite upgraded 
---
You can buy lead from me. I have 175 bulk lead
---
But dahhhhling! Having ones own indoor ghoul is so hot, this season! 
---
Gorgeous house, btw! üòä
---
Your name seems familiar, but I can‚Äôt put my finger on it.
---
Thank you!
---
Lucky hole mine with excavator armor. Massive amounts of lead ore, but you need acid to refine it. With super duper and excavator armor, Though, you can end up with 500+ scrap.
---
Learn can-trap locations. Camden Park is also a quick one for this, there is I think 6 traps scattered in 3 pairs you can snag very quickly. Each trap is 9 lead and 18 steel. As mentioned the penitentiary is a great resource for this, but it‚Äôs a big, claustrophobic building with a lot of enemies to clear. On the plus side, it‚Äôs usually supermutants so you get a lot of caps, gunpowder, and weapons to scrap for steel, and there‚Äôs several workbenches there too. 
---
Extractors take too much babysitting for my liking (their storage space is too low!)
---
No but you'd be surprised how many players don't like having even a sliver of red on their bar for safety reasons. Plus when someone dies they lose a little bit of rads so unless someone resets their safety sliver on respawn in extended PvP you might be able to whip out the instigating guns after that first kill.
---
*sob*
---
With legendary effects, regular armor is the best outside of nuke zones. Without good legendary effects, power armor is better, but you have to deal with carrying around fusion cores and high repair costs.
---
For real money? Or ingame currency?
---
Not gonna be eternal, they already have a similar page for eternal. Why add a placeholder that's gonna be the same as something you already have. Has to be a remake or more hopefully starfield? Maybe? 
---
the existence of this message alone is proof that the other player won. you ruined your own game, they just helped you do it.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna charge real money lmao
---
thanks for the informed reply.
---
i guess I will just stash these pieces and hope that it gets fixed.  I will put in a bug report as well.  I have to admit, with some of the other bugs still floating around, I can see how this one would be low priority.
---
Dang it, so much for my uber rad resist whitesprings set.  
---
i have  full set of bos armor but i always seem to die quickly when using it..so it seeems.i have no choice but to wear PA
---
True haha.
---
 I have some arthritis in my hands 
---
recruitment blues is fucking cancer 
---
on pc btw  
---
been searching for the electro-fusion mod for hatchet. Plan?
---
I had a mid but gave it away I‚Äôm sorry
---
Yeah! I've got a forty-year old Craftsman Radial saw that simply won't quit... old tools are the best tools!
---
I did say the quest is there, and I did make it active. It still doesn't show the marker.
---
As would I. The price is so good, I wouldn't even pop those Grape Mentats!
---
Nah it's definitely a bug I'm experiencing. Death icon is on map but not very helpful when it's inside a dungeon type area. The mini marker map at the bottom doesn't show it. I can find them with patience and making sure I remember exactly where I die, but that's it.
---
My psn is SaintNitsu. Add me anytime and I'll introduce you to the guys.
---
I think OP was on my server the other day before I read this
---
Cutest Couple 2019
---
Yea, I know, most of the people do that, keeping junk at stash. My bad that I was keeping all my junk with me, because 1) for stash size restrictions and 2) for this desire of play this game like a Dark Souls game and feel the tense feeling of retrieve all the junk after a death (ha !, really, that was all my 42 levels junk).
---
Is kind of a bummer to reach again the level of things I was carrying with me (already marked again those needed to repairs to retrieve first those items).
---
I think a future ability to simply "rejoin last server" will do much good. If this was already present I already will continue the searching of my bag at least with the feeling to be certain to be on the correct server (the correct location where I dropped is another issue).
---
I had jumped to much between servers that I really can't remember what were the players on the original one. And by the way, I think that at least at Xbox you need to ask first a player to be friends to be connected at the server where he is playing.
---
Thanks to you all
---
Well, the Wedigo lore isn't remotely limited to WV, so who knows.
---
Sorry
---
Man you realize how many servers there are, right? 24 players per server. At 1000 people playing the game alone that‚Äôs 41 different servers that you have to hope:
---
A) Aren‚Äôt full
---
B) Aren‚Äôt one you‚Äôve previously been connected to already
---
The amount of time it would take to server hop to find your stuff, you may as well just go collect it again. Take a break and come back to it when your batteries are recharged and you‚Äôre ready to take it on. 
---
Not sure about rubberbanding, bug I lag really fucking hard near any of the Power Plants, near Charleston Landfill, or any location like them with an unusually large amount of objects in the environment
---
You can drop your power armour and it stays but it can be stolen so be careful 
---
Here's a link to actual app in the Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.fallout.falloutfm
---
There are random spawns of hostile boys. Usually gutsies when I play. They‚Äôll be higher level and attack on sight. Phoenix even warns about watching for non-brotherhood boys in the city. 
---
Welcome to Fallout 76. Here is your complimentary nylon duffle bag.
---
Must've been a console issue.
---
I didn't have fps issues at any point, outside of obvious, server related scenarios.
---
Pacifist mode is pretty consistent I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm almost always meele, with a tendency to use heavy weapons (minigun / Gatling laser / plasma) and I‚Äôve never accidentally started combat with another player.
---
I'm just gonna keep replying to myself until I receive acknowledgement that someone understands there's a sweet app that's got what you need.
---
Can you rephrase this question to be decipherable?
---
I am on ps4 thank you though 
---
Solo 
---
Also, I suck at Reddit, dunno how this works
---
It also annoys the crap out of me when I shoot a hostile turret and get a bounty. I'm under attack, yet not allowed to defend myself? 
---
I like your style 
---
I'm going to ask the real question.
---
How did you get remotely that much time out of RDR2?
---
I've never been so disinterested in a Rockstar game after the first playthrough in my life.
---
I started a second play for a completionist run, and pit it down as soon as I left the mountains. 
---
How this game was excoriated, and RDR2 was praised, I'll never know.
---
Morgan town trainyard, watoga, converted munitions factory is where I got mine 
---
If you're feeling underpowered, just grind and take your time and level up guns and armor fir a while.  
---
U got disco ball plans or witch/ skeleton outfit plans 
---
Apparently telling people to not be fickle and to remember the transgressions that just happened is edgy. The downvotes kind of prove the hive mentality of this board. 
---
I do not 
---
I literally have no problem with sneak, what problems are you guys facing with it?
---
Pleasure.
---
They probably have a tracker for the miriad "easy fix" bugs that have been reported but I concur with your assessment, given the circumstances I don't think they will get around to squashing them any time soon.
---
If only they'd stop breaking things that are working...
---
I don't think it made it into 76. 
---
Ah that‚Äôs fine 
---
At that level they're harder if you're playing solo, make sure you have lots of aid items, ammo and the Lone Wanderer card equipped.
---
Yeah but to be fair, there's like 3 games worth of instinct on not being allowed to fast travel indoors.
---
(Until I read this, I was still going to parts of buildings that are technically 'outside' to FT.)
---
Im already 135, unfortunately the respec system didn't come about until i was around 110 
---
Need another perk card set, unlocked after lvl 50 or something to run other builds or make it all repair and crafting cards instead of all this switching back and forth cards
---
Plant crops at your CAMP
---
I wasnt a big fan of 3 tbh. Didn't like that it forced me to join the BoS lol. It was fun though, but I'd much rather see NV
---
I wish they did a surprise DLC for fallout 4 thats takes u to Appalachia 
---
I'm pretty sure I have that mod!
---
Damn 
---
Level 110 or 200, same is same.
---
Would be really cool 
---
I have eight of each plant. 
---
Yea man, as I said on my last comment. I gave up for lost, I will take this experience as a challenge. I was having a blast with this game with no any breaking bug up to this moment.
---
Please Beth, at least implement that "re-join last server" in a near future, I think many guys are asking for that already.
---
Dont worry, it was a lvl15 * Mutant's Lead Pipe.
---
Yes, I did that and got around 400 lead ore I believe.  Just curious, do you know of a good source of acid besides scrounging for cleaner boxes?
---
Server hop. Every hop will random the remaining containers.
---
I still cant believe Bethesda left out hotwheels with flames and tracks and shit, huge game development mistake
---
Could you post your perk build? I am trying to run a non pa melee as well.
---
dont forget adren.reaction doesnt work anymore even after reapplying it
---
Dcg doesn‚Äôt get one handed perks, only unarmed. Same for powerfist. Dcg is cheaper to repair
---
I just killed a Super Mutant Behemoth, Deathclaw and it didn't trigger.
---
I did this earlier and had to shoot a brahmin, it was adore 
---
Kind sir, what is thy gamertag i feel need of a a new polish on my armor
---
Nothing will ever be fair to the individual, it has to be as fair as possible for the population. 
---
Giving a small number of people an advantage straight out of the gate means those people will always have an edge. Maybe throw a cosmetic only item for the few that go several hundred levels deep, but nothing gameplay impacting
---
theres not much attention there anyway lol
---
Hemlock holes is a good spot to take over. Other workshops also have acid nodes
---
"Bethesda left bugs from FO4, so this is baaically their fault".
---
"Hey guys, the bank guard went to the bathroom, it's his fault I robbed the bank."
---
This is called criminal mentality.
---
So many locations that spawn random PA armour of various types and levels. anything near a raider camp spawns raider type armour, but I found t45 near black bear lodge, down in the BoS forward base in cranberry bog, there are 2 PA spawns near mama dolce. Just need a bit of luck and keep checking
---
Same, or the trapper chest piece
---
Rdr2 was definitely a beautiful game and very smooth in game play but I did get bored and irrarted with no fast travel and the repition of similar missions. It actually made me really want the open fallout world with no limitations. 
---
Thanks for responding, its all good. 
---
Well, my hyper-focus Sniper/vats build can headshot 5 mobs before a melee player can even close with one... it all depends on your build and play style. I run a low health VATS build with an AA lever action (I‚Äôd love to get a blooded one) and between sneak attacks, VATS aiming for headshots, Concentrated Fire and Gun Fu, plus the occasional crit, I rip through enemies. Even with Adrenal Reaction broken right now, I just did AWOL Armaments and was still oneshotting the colonel gutsies with sneakshots to their thrusters, I don‚Äôt think I ever had a shot fired at me too. The legendaries take a few more hits, they seem to have more health beyond just the regent they do. 
---
Basically, a melee might have paper damage of 1k vs my paper damage of 240, but when I‚Äôm doing sneak headshots for 240*2*2.5, and I can do it from 200 feet away... I have no complaints. 
---
What‚Äôs his gamer tag? I couldn‚Äôt see it in the photo
---
I would go for a pistol or rifle vats build with crit. Rifle if she sneaks. Doing this with pistols right now and basicly dont aim at all
---
Do you have the Gamma Gun plan?!?
---
Just server hop at mothman museum by vault 76 if you‚Äôre below lvl30 Blackwater mine by Whitespring has lvl 40+ power armor most the time but lots of mole miners
---
I too play as an escape. I've enjoyed it at my own pace from the start. Level 109 at this point with no duped gear (even traded). I build in different places and set my own goals around the grind and story so I even enjoy the solo feeling of minimal npcs. It's a getaway from IRL and a place where I can roll around on my own or hang with friends. Let's hope the roadmap brings us continued enjoyment and new experience.
---
Yeah, if the container doesn't have data just don't touch anything in it and it should randomize the contents on next hop.
---
It‚Äôs not 50% off
---
Agree.  I burn through so much ammo in Watoga and surrounding areas at level 73.  I do have 5 rifleman points, 3 bloody mess points and 3 tank killer points, also 2 point to make sneak attacks stronger and one point in sandman.  Still am way underpowered.  
---
Everyone says to just do a melee build but not what I'm really wanting to do. So I agree, there is way too much emphasis on squeezing out every single dammage buff using perk cards, to the point where you can't even keep any of the quality of life cards equipped.  
---
Ok good to know, ty. So in terms of what perks u would run between the two it's similar. 
---
Yeah, after beating the story, I had no motive to play more. It felt like they spent too much time pretending they care about single player.
---
In hindsight, the entire game was built for RDO, and that sucks.
---
Dying will bring you back up to about 70-75% rads if you were lower than that. I don‚Äôt think it removes more. 
---
Canvas good 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know how anybody still supports and plays this game. Blows my mind how people think it will get better lmao.
---
You can also download the fallout76 map app it has locations of power armor certain items bobble heads and magazine location spawn points
---
Personally, I find the Deathclaw Gauntlet (and by extension, the Mole Miner Gauntlet) more comfortable to use because they seem to have a longer reach than the Power Fist.  I don't know how true that is in actuality, but the timing of the Power Fist feels weird to me.
---
Ive never really done online games before this, what are raids specifically? 
---
confirmed I'm carrying that mod. but no plan for it sorry
---
I think his point is that when you said:
---
&gt;I swear Bethesda is trying to steer us towards melee builds at every turn.
---
Doesnt make sense if berserker is broken for both melee and ranged.
---
I remember back in patch 4 when I got those knuckles, I was seeing the damage fluctuations like you were saying.
---
The weird thing was I was noticing damage increase by attaching a weightless armor piece. Doing just about anything would cause it to reset.
---
Hardened Mass, High Radiation Fluids etc are combined with radiated plants to make stable fluxes and these are used for advance mods on PA and weapons and some camp items
---
More xp, generally better loot.
---
The radiation fluids, hard mass etc are used with irradiated plants to make stable flux st the chem bench.
---
That's used to upgrade underarmor, prime weapons, build rad shower &amp; to make mutation serums.
---
Radiation fluids etc also sell for ok prices at vendors.
---
I was at whitesprings solo &amp; a team of 3 were leaving, rejoining world &amp; the glowing ones just kept coming &amp; afterwords they called me over to look through the bags of legendaries they didn't want - about 100 of them.
---
That's when it can be truly awesome :)
---
Also if you wait till after the radiation has left, the enemies are still glowing, but your not burning through fusion cores.
---
Don't fast travel to events then. I agree a map timer would be an improvement, but wasting caps is a personal problem.
---
Hopefully these come in the new CAMP items we've been promised in the upcoming DLC
---
I never thought about that. I've got a 3* DC I can try out and compare to my 3* PF. I used the PF for the first time and really loved it! Was zipping thru Mole Miners üòÇ 
---
There's some trickery going on with the campfire item. [Check out this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0vGoXMv3Q)
---
All these console focused MMO devs should be required to play WoW or FF14 for a few months.
---
These systems are all sorted beautifully in actual MMORPGs.
---
Problem here, is that sharding kind of requires a group finder tool for quests that can't be soloed.
---
This. Yes.
---
Then you would complain how they are not fixing the game...
---
But why the fuck do enemy turrets not need a spotlight?
---
I only got to explore it myself at 45. It became 100% easier when i finally bought a Marsupial serum. Theres so many places you can jump on as vantage points to be safe from 99% of what's out there.
---
Hahah, that's a good point.
---
Probably one of the people u traded with if u remember their GT
---
yes i have no diseases or addictions and im using waay more drinks.than i used to..everytime i log on i have to make.100 juices to last me a few hours..food is fine but drink goes down about 5 times faster than food
---
I came back for the first time in about 2 months today and was kicked off twice in 10 minutes.  Really feeling like a sucker for buying this game.
---
Nah, you're definitely the douche here.
---
Dude's useless against a queen, but you're also a dick.
---
Lone wanderer perk cards are great.  Also, the further you get out to the South and east, the more fusion cores you'll come across. I have about 50 in my stash and in inventory and never activity look for them.  You'll find them mostly in sets of power armor, occasionally in the power generators and also dropped from enemies.
---
You understood my point. Thank you. I should have quoted what I was referring to
---
Awesome, thanks guys

I'm doing such a thing on ps4 200 per mod applied bring the materials, I can make jetpacks and calibrated shocks for most armors working on collecting all the plans
---
I think it's more likely that he was continuing to troll me from the disagreement we had the other day.
---
His entire presence in this thread didn't see to be that of one who is interested in trouble shooting glitches...... instead he picked up where he left off the other day with the same dickish undertone.
---
You were correct this glitch is very similar to the excavator armor glitch. It seems every time I adjust my damage resistance it ignores the positive perks of the legendary effect m
---
You feel ignored because you don't understand that a one year road map will not indicate a feature already stated to be slated beyond the said year? 
---
Oooook.
---
Didn‚Äôt know it was a bug, thought it was its feature
---
Yep and I had to server hope out of whitesprings because a level 14 guy was running around in there.  Goes both ways 
---
I went to the hardware store last week...... so many screws.....
---
So what happens if you take a mutation serum now? Does it fix the glitch? 
---
Yeah, they don't last long for me
---
add spotlights they increase the use of turrets around 2-3x as much I use a pair of heavy energy turrets and 2 spotlights and they pretty much liquefy anything in near silence (within reason)
---
Bahahaha amazing!
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt remember unfortunately 
---
No sorry
---
your title illustrates the majority of people in this sub
---
BTW before the latest patch my marsupial mutation won‚Äôt work at all on some server or it will work but after fast travel it will stop working. After the latest patch it‚Äôs been working all the time. Thank you Bethesda for fixing it. 
---
Well, I guess it‚Äôs a bug. üòÖ
---
The Campfire object is interpreted as a dirt surface.  So you can build foundations and plant things on top of it.
---
I was just a syringer or a drill :P
---
I don't remember where I read it or heard it but I remember turrets being mentioned as essentially stationary NPCs and entities in their own right. They have loot tables and use AI like normal NPCs but they don't move. That was mentioned as being the reason they take up so much budget because they're essentially NPCs you put down even if they're blind and weaker than a level 1 mob.
---
I kind of want them to make 76 into a HQ for player made factions where we can bring it back online and build it up and we players can visit it and trade items and such in their own factions
---
Id like to know the real inspiration for the tinker bench, because it looks awesome and the tool layout reminds me of my grandfathers worksbench. 
---
Vertical half walls are all I've ever wanted
---
They have literally made the game melee only.
---
Everything else fails and is just miserable to play.  
---
You were in a group though... wouldn't you just be able to rejoin your group?
---
You misunderstood me in that case.
---
When I said Bethesda was pushing us to melee builds I never said to a Berserker melee build.
---
I agree with the loot loading issue, but I must be a complete exception to everything else on PC. I've suffered exactly one DC, and almost none of the glitches Reddit claims riddles the game.
---
The only consistent glitch I get is a body flinging itself into orbit upon death.
---
And seeing is how that's the glitch that became the Giant Smash in Skyrim, I still find it to be hilarious, and worth not fixing.
---
Ha! Cakes don't expire in Fallout world silly!
---
After storing them, placing them back down, linking them together and then rewiring them, they started working again. it was super annoying having to take out a vengeful mothman twice at my base with the turrets not firing. 
---
After getting them to work again, the third encounter went far more quicker
---
Do you realize that pvp is stunted as hell right? How exactly do you suggest doing this?
---
Even better, people would just swap server until they find one without this "faction" on it.
---
Worthless idea.
---
I can confirm that Stealth is still unchanged from before the last patch.  I have tried this with both chameleon armor and Stealth Boy equipped, and enemies have no trouble whatsoever finding me while I am supposedly completely invisible and not moving.
---
I was in Watoga yesterday and could hear tons of gunfire; Phoenix makes a statement about having to stop someone and walks off, by the amount of gunfire I thought someone was in serious trouble and ran off to see what the deal was.......it was a government robot employee melee; they were attacking each other.
---
What the fuck; I think the latest update fucked up their NPC settings.
---
Fuck. That really sad. 
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Wouldn't matter if the server dc'd
---
I'd like a rainwater collector that gives dirty water / better stilts / and warehouse windows that are not shattered 
---
Might have just got a glitched one. Happened a few times to me. Glitches to be almost untouchable. Good thing is you‚Äôll know within the first few min if she‚Äôs glitched, I just leave at that point and save my ammo. 
---
Great idea man! So much better than wanted :D
---
I'm betting we'll get this when they update the camera
---
I know that the stealth is bugged because every time I do this I go from \[HIDDEN\] to \[DANGER\]
---
1. go stealth / crouched ---\[HIDDEN\]
---
2. find a pack of enemies
---
3. switch weapon to missile launcher (I use Bunker Buster) ---\[DANGER\] PS: I haven't even shot the missile for them to notice twas me!
---
Love that idea!
---
Ok thanks. Whitesprings is indeed the cornucopia
---
Ok good, thanks
---
The online storefront schism is exposing something, imo.
---
Devs are sick of fucking achievement and trophy requirements. 
---
Nintendo never hopped on the wagon, and none of the new store fronts popping up against Steam have them.
---
76 doesn't have trophies/cheeves on PC, and I have to say, it's nice to remember what playing a game without the OCD riddled burden of controlled completion is like. I was a gamerscore addict to an extent at one time, not so far as to care, but it mattered.
---
I don't know why. I wouldn't be sad to see an arbitrary metric go the way of the Dodo.
---
my poops were in a group, i was ridin solo haha. i simply meant, i had my shit together.
---
Are they posted online? Or somewhere in game? I am probably the most oblivious person alive so I would not be surprise if I am totally missing it.
---
Was only a troubleshooter / ghoul slayer gamma gun.
---
Lol never done the monster mash event yet. 
---
But that's a good strategy haha üòÄ sounds like you've done it before hehe 
---
Can you put a jetpack on my friends X-01 prototype PA? 
---
Could be... on the fall description it said it‚Äôll be the biggest dlc added yet for Fallout 76 and will introduce decisions and true consequences.
---
Yeah, but that doesn't help the fissure site and doesn't help if you hit a narrow ledge that kills you yet is almost impossible to land on.
---
What console are you playing on? Steel worked fine on and then off for me on PS4 last night.
---
yup, true, but that bug was supposed to have been fixed in the latest patch ? :/
---
I found that in the cave leading to Blackwell's bunker. I immediately shot the prowling Deathclaw, wiping half of it's HP out. I laughed at the 17th century loading animation. The Claw sauntered off to lick it's wounds. I found it again, and shot it directly in the face...which took maybe 1 hp from it.
---
TL;DR I've fired this thing twice, and it worked once.
---
Spring roadmap looks gear imo and I‚Äôm very excited to check it out 
---
I have a level 35 one, literally lasts like 12 shots lol
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
This is dope! I‚Äôll be contacting you in game soon! 
---
GT: Brown mamba3489
---
That's an issue between your TV and PS4 settings.
---
You'll just have to tinker with both.
---
It's not the game, though.
---
I'm saving this post because I don't get much time to play these days but I am definitely coming to see you!
---
How is anthem btw? I heard a whole ton of backlash about the beta, and I keep getting ads for it that look pretty much identical to warframe
---
Literally only use the Nuka Cola T51b and the Excavator :P
---
I would encourage Australians affected to use the ACCC for exactly this purpose
---
Part of me wants to think it will look like the inhabitants of Vault 76 have built a thriving functional post-apocalyptic city across Appalachia. But in reality, a barren wasteland, not unlike the Glowing Sea in FO4. After years of abuse by the anarchists of Vault 76 raining down hellfire across the West Virginian landscape, the reclamation day dwellers will have fled far from the - now huge glowing crater - Whitespring and repopulated in neighbouring states. 2287 Raiders, Brotherhood, Enclave, all fathered by the dwellers originally tasked with rebuilding the world new, but instead destroyed it. Some survivors travelled West, some - East. Others - stayed too long and mutated in to the popular talking Ghouls from previous games.
---
I don‚Äôt recall anything about this ? 
---
Bear in mind I‚Äôm 1/3rd r tard.
---
Are they adding some kind of object placement?
---
It's not the game.
---
Ask Beth to fix problems that actually concern them.
---
They're not responsible for teaching you how to read your TV manual.
---
All the SB's seem to have been buffed; am avoiding them like the plague now.
---
Great Idea!!
---
It's a pain in the ass to be sure, but there's already a solution, jump to another server. When people grief me by destroying my workshops, I just go collect the collectors and the reactors and jump to a diff server. 
---
Yea really hoping it'll be offered a make over. It's still my go to armor for most things just because of the 100 carry 
---
When that happens I hit enter and I fast travel.
---
Yes the game can be completed solo no friends needed. I'd wait on some of the quests for the end item to be at max level.
---
I was able to solo both the BoS glassed cavern and the mayor for the day. (admittedly in he lvl 40-50 range) Arguably it's more fun in a group but not mandatory.
---
Btw you can solo a scorchbeast. They're just annoying. It's easier now than it used to be.
---
You can go ahead and use it, it's fairly easy to work around the bug. Just don't shoot when it says "999/0" for your ammo count. Drop all but one cell, fire it, and it's fixed until you take it out of your inventory. Won't hurt to check the ammo count when re-equipping it but mine has stayed fixed through disconnects, crashes, lots of weapon swaps, and weeks of real time
---
If they give us robot crafting stations they better damn well give us those donut fryers
---
I was always wondering if we ever getting companions
---
Doesn't this violate posting rules?
---
Is it possible they‚Äôre spawning her at a range of difficulty and sometimes we get a really easy one and sometimes an impossible one?  Is there any visible or invisible multiplier we can see for her strength?
---
Oh does it I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt see them they wouldn‚Äôt load I‚Äôll take a look
---
Hype falls under personal responsibility imo.
---
It's not a marketer's fault that you can't temper expectations.
---
I was hoping that we could equip perk cards to that backpack, only the perk cards that can reduce carry weight of certain items like : 
---
Chems - Travelling Pharmacy
---
Junks - Pack Rat
---
Ammos - Bandolier
---
Explosives - Ordnance Express
---
Food/Drinks - Thru Hiker (like a mini refrigerator backpack so our food wont spoil)
---
Imagine thinking a developer is doing something they already said they were gonna do because Reddit crybabies.
---
Just tagged a 3* Gutsy and dragged it back to a Camp where I saw 3 players (just up the road). They quickly filled him in with bullets and looted his twitching robotic corpse. In my amazement at noticing a TS Rifle I forgot he likes to explode. I got Nuked, Gutsy flew away to a distant land and now my beloved TS is no more. Searched for a while but I never found him
---
Yeah I've recently started to try to maximize durability on some of the more fragile guns.
---
This is epic.
---
Patch 5 they messed with stealth for PVP, I think when they did that they fucked it up for PVE.
---
This LL is dated. I speak from personal quest to gain the Shielded Raider PLAN using this exact table... Uranium Fever server hopping for ages... I am 700 hours into the game. I can confirm, 100% positive, I was awarded the Protective AND Shielded Raider PLANS from Mr.Messenger. Protective from Savage Divide and Shielded from Forest... Idk if that had any effect on the drop chance (though I highly doubt it), but that's where I got them. I gave up on ever getting them after 100's of Uranium Fever events and started doing Mr.Messenger to get a shot at rare apparel...turns out I got the plans. 
---
There are lots of paint cans on the roof of West tech.
---
Might as well make bases indestructible then. Bases are ment to be able to be attacked. I agree that there needs to be a tweak to pvp in general but not punishing players for playing the game as it is allowed to be played.  Maybe once they add more content people will go do that instead of hunting for bases
---
Even if it was outsourced it was Bethesda's responsibility to follow up on the product they're asking someone else to make. I imagine you'd have say...a meeting? You could have coffee, doughnuts, a large table and sit down with the people making the bag with a sample to ensure what you promoted all the way up to the games launch is what ends up in your customers hands.
---
I also look forward to the time when I will become super creative. 
---
Session replication has nothing to do with passwords.  
---
Are you on PC using mods?
---
Hee is my bunker I built, indetructable [https://imgur.com/a/MVWofAZ](https://imgur.com/a/MVWofAZ)
---
I hope you could cook food with it. Also it clearly has a sleeping bag, although it sure ain't nuclear winter model.
---
You might have to move you‚Äôre camp to store the foundation then re place it
---
Lmao it took me entirely too long to realize "non-ethnic hair mohawk" is just a really weird, long winded way of saying "frohawk".
---
On PC but.. I don't think I'm using mods dumb question but how would I check?
---
I rock a BoS Field Scribe Uniform for this reason. That and it matches the color of the tricentennial 10 mm
---
I'd love if they'd add the militia hats.
---
It isn't my tv, it isn't like that through most of it, just in that one part of the menu and every other game I play displays just fine.
---
Claim the factory and you don't even have to pick the lock either.
---
My faith is over. Deleted everything i had on my console of theirs and will be sipping my physical stuff to their office in Bethesda MD
---
This and the stealth damage bug are easily my biggest two grievances with the game at the moment
---
Ok. That's fine. I'm telling you it isn't the game, though.
---
I have a few games that do it too, but it's a ratio issue between the TV and System, not the game.
---
You're not using mods :)
---
Maybe you missed my point or maybe your head is so far up Bethesda's ass you can't read it. I've done everything there is to do in the game. I'm not going to go out and casually grind another 50 levels from just killing mobs.
---
Hmm thats an intresting point of view. I doubt but who knows, I mean why would you have a lock in a backpack
---
 You don't have to learn the plans. Its for people that lost the rewarded armor, as many did.
---
 I;m sure you are right. I don't actually ever complete all quests in games. I just do the ones that appeal to me, and get me what I need, to acquire what I want. ;)
---
 Played a lot of madded Stalker and the quests are often kinda open ended and not really what most people do.    
---
It‚Äôs hard mode outfit. Like tattered dress from mystery quest line
---
If this is anything like most loot games, anything you stockpile in advance will offer massively diminishing returns.
---
Odds are, prepatch leggos will offer less mats, sell for much less, or be entirely ineligible.
---
It's definitely not going to be worth jamming your stash space with every leggo you find.
---
Its not fun.
---
You can leave and come back?
---
I tried tried my first silo (solo) last week at level 89. Got to the last part and most of my stimpaks we‚Äôre gone.  It took way too long and it was time to put the game down and go do something else. So I said fuck it and shut off my Xbox. 
---
I assumed that I‚Äôd have to start over when I go back the second time. 
---
You forgot all the mutations that everyone wants. Lol
---
Hello brother/sister 
---
How about a portable donut fryer on your robot companion, that you can sell donuts with? Now you‚Äôre talking 
---
Another strange thing though... foundations for both characters are gone atom shop items are blank and all my blueprints for the current base aren't showing either, I remembered all I messed with was pipboy colors could that be it? 
---
I think I would too, but I'm not sure how viable that is since it was made by another studio. 
---
Maybe you're the idiot that can't level up and is investing energy into attacking people on the internet who don't have the same problem because they aren't idiots.
---
Go level up, idiot.
---
Ok thanks!
---
I wonder if this is related to the gatling laser/plasma bug where it loads ammo to how many cores you have till you reload it.
---
Why everyone buying violet flux ?
---
I was pretty hopeless at it until I randomly found this dog helmet apparel on an enemy, that sort of gave me a hint to maybe bethesda is hinting something related to companions
---
What if you hunted dupers? Never used items, just took and put out of reach? Let me guess, "ya shouldnt of done that"? What was i supposed to do, let it occur and no do anything???
---
That's a good point. But I think they should stick to cryptids that are at least somewhat tied to WV, not just put them in for the sake of putting them in.
---
I do like the Wendigo's though. Ever since I've played Until Dawn I love me some Wendigo appearances.
---
Yeah one of my comments is -12 on another thread because you know, how dare i talk about how disappointed i am with Bethesda and the fact i got banned for duping without evidence. 
---
This.
---
People are actively lagging the servers, and confused about it.
---
Or just have radaway cure the last acquired mutation. Randomness is BS.
---
Have you checked your post history? All you've done is be snide and troll anyone who criticizes anything FO76.
---
I have a store in the cranberry bog set up , the bog hole , previously set up at the devils backbone with the name the devils booty and showing the mothman sign high 
---
My favorite song: [Two Left Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUT7xbJIXs)
---
Im not trying to reinforce the hate but I just have to say this. So I played FO76 ever since the Beta and I took a break last month because the state if the game at the time was so bad it made rage quit (and because I had some new games to play). Now, I got back into FO76 for the first time since. While I was having fun killing some supermutants so I could own the Grafton workshop because I had no steel to craft the new Mothman sign. All of a sudden, the game freezes while I was trying to drink a nuka cola just to refill my hp. It was 'not responding;' I couldn't alt+F4 either. So I was like, "that's it, until the next big update then." *sigh*
---
Jetpacks?
---
Yeah, lose it and reapplied with serum built after patch
---
Regularly she should scale with amount of players participating in the event.
---
Maybe she now scales with ALL people on the server, who knows? 
---
I'm a stealth sniper and I can solo most of the game. Vats head shots from stealth deal a good bit of damage 
---
Same here 
---
That would be a slight improvement, as long as we had a way to recall which order we got them in, but even then, if adrenal was your first, you are really screwed.
---
So are players still able to scrounge their own PA or are they gonna be gunned down by players trying to corner the market? Dont get me wrong awesome idea, but I remember ESO with werewolf and vampires. Players were killing the creatures to prevent anyone from acquiring the bites unless they paid said player huge x amount of gold for it. Hoping this doesnt turn into that. Cool idea though.
---
That's why people don't show up to kill the queen anymore .. there is no point if you can't kill her anymore, you better off just farming for violet flux or nuking whitespring or morgantown.
---
i wish we could just hold E to move object/corpses like the other games
---
Cool thanks for the reply, I‚Äôve been trying to wait till they fix it but I want to play so I think I‚Äôll just do this. 
---
yup that really isn't acceptable. r/BethesdaGameStudios
---
Have you played without perks?  It‚Äôs possible. In fact might make it a bit better because you can‚Äôt just run up to everything and kill it in a whack or two 
---
Yeah but to be fair, beyond Mothman and Sheepsquatch, that's all your WV crypids.
---
I like the idea that these urban myths that don't exist, were created by nuclear fallout, becoming real, just as a concept.
---
I want a quest where you track bigfoot sightings, but it turns out he's just a super mutant with an overactive mutation that makes him hairy.
---
I spray and pray. The higher levels always help out. Just make sure you tag each enemy with at least one hit. 
---
Lol. Dude it's a game. Do it and move on
---
Maybe I'm just dismissive of "criticism" that isn't valid or criticism.
---
Maybe some idiot wants to try to call out that they're a victim of a shill.
---
Maybe both. What's your hottake?
---
I thought that was only temporary 
---
Yep. The first death in the green pits is the worst. My first was after a prime fissure nuke. Was just jumping around and landed square in one. Thought it was weird that I died but didnt think more of it so went back and just jumped straight in to get my bag. Nope. Instant death. So many screws lost.
---
Yes we have had our own servers especially at night, it empties out or crashes everyone out. Private servers are finally here .. I love it.
---
They fixed all the bugs, didnt you know? :)
---
I think I read theres a limit to the number of stickys, although two seems like a pretty low limit.
---
If that sticky limit is true, the news of the roadmap probably took the place of it
---
Maybe you're heads so far up Bethesda's asshole you can't probably form your own opinion or have any sort of unbiased thought towards the game. 
---
I‚Äôll second that. 
---
No when a serum is applied, neg effect are not turned on for like 2 hours from what I read. 
---
Todd howard demands that a certain number of players be culled for his nightly blood bath. Pete Hines then turns the skin into overpriced blue leather jackets with tacky gold trim
---
We're back to you crying victim because you're an idiot.
---
Keep going.
---
i have some gt pitbullhooligan
---
Guess I'll try it and find out 
---
That 200% repair buff that increases damage doesn't last long, after a hit or two it comes off. Mr Handy blade did 50 but for half a second.
---
Thank you! ;_; I spent a ton of time buying plans and placing things, and I was so pissed when this interloper showed up.
---
The bog hole hahaha! I‚Äôm a lowbie so I‚Äôve barely made it to cranberry yet, I‚Äôve discovered it but only scoured the outskirts really 
---
Saved lol. Will be looking
---
Do you need 2 get rid of all other mutations or just reapply it?
---
That's one way to look at it I guess although it does feel super unbalanced then not just hard. A scorchedbeast would blow you away with one attack I think.
---
I‚Äôve wondered this myself, and as far as I know, there‚Äôs no explanation anywhere.
---
It almost looks as though the city, as a self-sufficient and automated being, was trying to personify itself once all the humans had gone
---
I feel like I tried using map mods. I'm gonna delete all .bac and .pak and try s repair 
---
Yeah I normally do just jump on another server I think I just sort of resent doing that XD especially as it'll cost caps again to retake the workshops. 
---
Head cannon: scorchbeast nests.  I‚Äôve seen them flying around there quite a bit and there are piles of guano scattered around.  
---
My theory is that the scorchbeasts have treated them like a nest or something and dropped a load of crap up there like magpies 
---
There's NPCs later on sort of
---
Killed one just last night with less than eight active participants. 
---
Battle Royale + bulletsponge shooter = you're not allowed to have ideas, anymore.
---
I've seen that before a few times, dont know how it happens. I recall seeing a robobrain with abilities of an assaultron. That was quite a wakeup call.
---
That‚Äôs a mod that you can put on your power armor. 
---
Hell the only reason I lock my door is becasue the scorched just run though the door,and smack my reactor if I don't.
---
Yeah maybe 2 months ago. Now it works correctly. 
---
Did some searching, apparently the Flatwoods and the Grafton monster are also "real". You know, they are talked about beyond FO76.
---
Yup... Some dude kept blowing up my camp. Everytime I did a resource run, it was all destroyed without producing jack shit. I'm just amazed how people find that "fun". This is coming from a person who played mmorpg from the beginning. I was beta on Ultima Online. Griefing is what lead to its downfall imo. Also they kept making things harder and harder because people were macroing their characters. 
---
Yeah, I don't think they give a shit about the tablet PC market.
---
I mean, you could only be playing on a worse platform if it was a Mac.
---
Make sure you haven't unequipped Makeshift Warrior
---
to what?
---
And if folks have widescreen monitors then it's even worse.
---
Not just pc, xbox too! Im always a stealth build and I literally cant, even maxed out perk cards and shrouded armor!
---
It works correctly. My flaming chainsaw eats through ghouls now lol
---
 My Combat Knife is about 96 normally. After repairing it to 200% I stabbed a pile of Robots in Watoga. My friend Phoenix was being assailed. Then went to Harper's Ferry and killed a pile of Muties before I looked at the number which was 135. Now its a Nocturnaly buffed knife but that just adds like 10 normally. I've never seen it over 102 before. 
---
Snallygasters if you want to farm them.  I find it easier to just head to whitesprings and run through the laundry there
---
As long as there is a limit to how many items. Dont want my framerates to tank whenever I go near someone's camp or a workshop.
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) 
---
Yeah say what system you‚Äôre on tho lmao
---
Shit
---
Mostly bone shards
---
They're supposed to be like SB nests/guano piles.
---
nope it's my alarm. if you go wanted at my camp ,i move it. cant trust everyone.
---
Imagine making a rocket launcher from like 6 screws, 2 gears, 10 pounds of raw steel, and some glass.
---
Do you know how to read?  
---
Is it hard for you?
---
Dunno. I think to be safe, rid all and reapply. Just do research if not. 
---
Probably mutations
---
Make sure you put on the perception perk for double gathering as well as contractor 2 if your using it for your camp objects
---
something with mutations
---
Seeing so many stills around, I always assumed it was cut or planned content.
---
Alright cheers man. My build depends on it so you know 
---
(It's the old in out, in out, not the old in n out)
---
No? Its part of the game. Sorry you had to deal with griefers but some people just play the game that way
---
So Beethoven and Kelly.
---
Oh geez, thank you for the validation. üòÅ
---
Thanks man!
---
Check thr post by u/33 Games.
---
I agree with all but the junk thing. The only negative to dying is losing your junk. It's free game for anyone to grab 
---
Some things I've noticed and/or would like:
---
Broken - Please fix adrenal reaction mutation not working in latest patch!!!! 
---
Broken - strange in numbers negates all positive mutation effects
---
Suggestion - Empath mutation should also have a Max negative effect of 25% damage instead of 33%. Seems unfair to be 35% to you, 25% less damage to team.
---
 Suggestion - It would be cool to have a serum that lets you cure a specific mutation of your choice. Would help for people who have collected multiple mutations. 
---
Broken - Also seems like latest patch I've been contracting multiple diseases at once like 4-5 at one time.
---
Broken - Fusion cores seem to be used up at a faster rate than previously.
---
Broken - Also seem to be taking more radiation then before patch. (Probably because I have 4-5 diseases on my character all the time now)
---
Suggestion - be able to label power armor chassis
---
Suggestion - save SPECIAL blueprints, so you can switch between play builds or crafting builds so you don't have to take the time to equip and unequip perk cards all the time
---
Suggestion - be able to sell or trade back to the game duplicate perk cards received from bubble gum wraps at each 5 to level.
---
Suggestion - be able to sell known plans back to vendors, I've got tons! Also this would be cool because if there are plans I don't need but sometime else might then they have a chance to find it in a vendor if I sold it back to the game
---
Suggestion - calibrated shocks for x01 pa easier to find, too too too rare!!!! Also ability to add a consecutive second mod to pa but ONLY to the torso so you can use jet pack and another mod at the same time
---
Suggestion - in game customization option to create your own paints for power armor. Make your own paint mods!!!
---
Suggestion - ability to fix grognak axe to 200% with weapons perk maxed also create some mods for it to keep things interesting
---
Suggestion - paint mods for excavator pa
---
Suggestion - ability to find characteristic mods for armor or weapons for example you could find or buy a mod that would turn a weapon into a legendary or give it a perk like two shot or swing faster or weight reduction 
---
Ok I'll stop here but I hope Bethesda sees this and takes into consideration
---
Same here Damon... frustrated
---
Yep deletes any files that were from last time I played. Seems to have fixed the problem. Thanks guys 
---
Team up with someone and have them use the rad sponge perk
---
Asked and answered...by the game's own loading screen tooltip.
---
Killed her last night no problem she‚Äôs heavy health the first bar of health then super easy to take down once she regains her health bar
---
And I'm going out of the country on holidays for march. As long as they dont IP block my laptop while I'm away or something.
---
So whitesprings will be nuked non-stop by people farming legendaries. Nice.
---
Poke around on reddit, just search watoga.
---
I agree that the adrenal reaction should be fixed without the workaround. I'm ok if it doesn't happen overnight. It would be nice if they'd test their stuff better. It would be nice if there were serums for removing specific mutations for situations like this, re-speccing, or when they make changes to mutations.
---
Used that code for Charlie today, so I can confirm it works!
---
I was just going ask the same thing. Thanks 
---
All right; that's at least A reason.... Still, though... add a turret. :)
---
If you‚Äôre serious, what‚Äôs your user name? Or how do people go about contacting you? Thanks. 
---
Personal preference, Deathclaw Gauntlet deals good damage while the Power Fist can do good damage, energy damage, and ignore armor. I personally prefer the power fist.
---
Was this fixed recently? I used to have empath and always ran class freak 3 but I took more than 33% increased damage for sure. One barrage from a scorch beast would take me to almost 0 health in PA
---
Wendigo. Was doing the Gourmand key fragment section, was going into the cave and I guess a higher level was nearby and a wendigo spawned. Way above my level at the time. Scared the crap outta me I didnt know what the hell it was it was moving so fast.
