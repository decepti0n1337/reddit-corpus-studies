It’s true

Super sledges use kinetic servos instead of rockets!

That is a level 100 jill if I have ever seen one.

Cheevos have become the curse of gaming. I'm very old and these things offend me.

---
 Stay on the lawn. Nukes incoming. ;) 
---
Because the Fallout community is amazing despite the game doing poorly.
---
Sneaking whenever you're at your camp helps a little, hiding your dot on the map. Blocking them preemptively would also hide your dot.
---
They bypass pacifist mode by attacking your workshop first. Just expect that they may come looking for you whenever that happens.
---
Unfortunately, that's where my camp is.
---
Not a great location; mobs keep destroying my garden, but great for fast traveling.
---
I think the western area is better if you just want a nice place free from danger to build your camp, but it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere.

Was another entrance to Toxic Waste Dump! Sorry

And snowflake?  Really?  The neckbeard smells from here man.

I just hear a lot of younger, dumber *me* coming out of your mouth.  Hopefully you grow and gain some perspective, it helped.
---
Again, all these interactions are your choice, I hope you're enjoying them.

Goodluck with the Keyblade.
---
Idk how far you are so spoiler free: that elevator is an exit from a bunker you access to start the Enclave questline
---
Yes you got tricked into participating in pvp by becoming wanted /s.  You will now have to meet your doom quietly or go out fighting. (This is how i got my first bounty)
---
Your a legend! Bethesda hire him/her.
---
I think I saw something like that. It was kinda like the elevator button in the portapotty 
---
I assumed you were serious. To each their own, I say! Personally, I've been playing FPS games since Wolfenstein and Doom way back in the day, so I know how to aim down scope without issue. I don't consider VATS cheating since I have pretty good aim most of the time, likely better than the VATS glitchiness that exists which you may or may not know about. ;) That said, VATS is a key feature of the game, many builds revolve around it, and it's pretty unique to the Fallout series. I would imagine that the idea is that people will want to use VATS instead of getting turned off by how rapidly it drains your fusion cores, thereby giving it up completely, never to return to it again.
---
Or PM [/r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com) to report it for them to look into see if someone is manipulating the system.
---
Bye!
---
That's ok, you can say it too and complete it as "bye bye"
---
Bye bye!
---
I did the same but in reverse, you know, mutations....
---
Not what I'm into, but thanks for the offer
---
I was talking about the people who trashed your camp. They were “raiders”. That one flew WAY over your head...
---
Ah yes my apologies I was concentrating on the ideal run, i hole heartedly agree there should be a consensus if you teleport to the club house directly we should share the kills. Although it is inself flawed by the game since you cant see the enemies and it takes a good while to see them in action instead of the players hitting air. (hopefully something has done to this) Sharing the kills is very difficult in that sense. I for one can take the exesive hits and have the patience to wait and see but cant say same for all. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion, man, i'll do this. Can I ask you a follow-up question --- if overheating is the culprit, why now? I've clocked in over 300-ish hours on the game without an issue this severe... is this just a sad case of an untimely degradation on my PC... Hm... 
---
That kinda destroys their gameplay loop. 
---
I’m mad at you for not finishing the protest chant and instead just singing and random sponge bob song. That’s not how protesting works. 
---
&gt;R/fo76 was made because r/fallout clowned on it so much.
---
Uh, no it wasn't. Just like /r/fo3, /r/fonv and /r/fo4 it was created to be a game-specific sub. It had nothing to do with the hate in /r/fallout.
---
"Ohh look I found this funny bug, probably a feature, haha, amirite guys?"
---
What is the problem if they are upset that the game is bugfilled after 4 months?
---
No probs will still look I'm very interested in an elevator in a tree unless it's just an exit to a silo
---
The main problem is that the drain on fusion cores when using VATS is apparent even with the relevant perks equipped. I touched on that at the end of my third paragraph. The perks do indeed help delay the drain but you can still see your fusion core gauge drop when actually shooting in VATS, and even moreso when consuming your critical strike in VATS. It also doesn't make sense to me that one of those two perks would be absolutely essential for PA VATS builds when that's totally not the case for other builds in the game.
---
in addition to vendors, i pull 8hr grind sessions, specifically for caps.  hit up super mutants.  they carry caps.
---
And the only one of those that isn't an absolute ghost town is fo4. Of course, this sub was inevitable, but it picked up so much traction because r/fallout hated it. They still do.
---
&gt; Dictionary for definitions bud
---
&gt; Once you've read that, I hope things are a little more clear.
---
Not really, no. Thin skin much ?
---
I can link you up to my bodybulding.com page if you want to see how much a "neckbeard" I'm lol.
---
That being said you're probably young as an responsible adult wound't get caught in such easily predictable scams from developers. But at least you learned a lesson and hopefully you won't be a sucker next time. 
---
Ok, I'll give it another go then. I was normally server hopping there about 15 to 20 times a night before I logged off, but I didnt have a camp near there. I'm over level 200 too. I also heard it randomly spawns as a possible cryptid for the queen of the hunt daily quest, but I've only managed to trigger that quest twice in 3 months or so.
---
I was thinking this so you can keep your stuff you use only in power armor such as fusion cores with the armor so you aren't overweight when you exit. 
---
Or manage maybe just manage your carry weight?
---
Then what's the point of the extra carry weight if you won't use it? 
---
You do use it...
---
I'm not entirely sure but I've run into this issue back when RUST came out with my old Radeon RX460 gpu hitting 140C most times. not sure what they changed (if anything) from the 2-300 hours I played before that point but that was my issue. I've seen it happen a lot, especially if the PC is shutting down entirely, it usually indicates a hardware fault 
---
They did it because TSE were too OP, but now they are basically as wesk as every other regular legendary. Yet they left Melee as OP as before and Laser Weapons are just as useless. So balance still isn't great. Durability sucks harder now since mobs feel a lot more tanky for TSE so if you see a Scorchbeast, Mierluck Queen, etc, no reason to waste durability on them since they are still bulletsponges with no legendary drop. They also removed all dupes from people's inventory yesterday but only for those with multipld stacks of the same weapon.
---
You betcha. My everyday all-purpose rifle is a anti-armor handmade, and it's a wonderfully balanced weapon.
---
1% sure... Shoulda assigned a number to items to keep track of them. 
---
I agree that the current fusion core usage with VATS is ridiculous. It's really hard to explain just how bad the drain is to someone who doesn't have first-hand experience with the issue. Hopefully I've been able to convey that in this thread because it's the best I can do short of putting up a short video showcasing this issue.
---
Yeah! Knowing you’d actually make some progress would revive the event.
---
There is also that perk card where you do more damage to workstation and camp object....    some people like to be “that guy”
---
I believe it when i see a video of you pickin up a TSE from an enemy. No offence buddy
---
Hey, thanks so much for this. I’ve been able to collect some steel however it’s only spawned once so far - when you say 18-20 hours, are you referring to in-game time or real life?
---
Totally agree with you on this topic I just recently switched to a full rifleman vats crit build. Took some getting used to, but now I'm loving it. Lots of fun, I crit so much like every other shot, sometimes back to back for awhile its awesome. Just added eagle eyes, any my main weapons have +50 damage to crits. Big time damage. I just wish there was a way to get more  ap, vats drains the ap so fast. Then the vats ends. Gotta look into getting more ap or ap regen. Btw I use rank 3 action boy already 
---
But did you do all challenges?
---
He HAS it though. This is massive news for me. Watoga is my new home til I find that damn bench. Also been trying to get my last disease the Whoopsies a poster said might be transmitted by diseased strangler mirelurks. Good luck and I will let you know if I see it. 
---
Nice. I have a crappy little shack and my budget is maxed out.
---
To be totally honest with you I can go from 1-50 in one day rushing the main quests. It’s not easy, and I’ve done it twice now. Also it takes the whole day (like 7 hours) to do it. 
---
I’ll definitely be doing this later. I’ve been wanting to change my camp for a bit so this just helped make my decision. Thanks!
---
If you can tolerate briefly grouping for the Watoga mayor quest, you could solo farm the robots there afterwards in relative safety.
---
You could also be "that guy" who hops into a queen fight just to tag all the scorched on the ground. Fight lasts longer, more enemies tagged, more XP.
---
Or craft and decon all your junk until you can craft no more, but that's pretty slow.
---
Nice
---
Ppl here mistake bad design as a feature. 
---
You might want to consider checking out the Luck perks. There are some interesting ones in there that work really well together to help refresh VATS crits and replenish all AP points. :)
---
What platform?
---
PS4
---
Appreciate your input, will keep track of my temperature. Cheers, mate!
---
lolz, get your head out of your ass bud.  No I don't want to see your photoshop projects.
---
I hope you get some perspective in life, learn about personal boundaries and preferences and overall stop being a dick for the sake of being a dick.
---
And telling people they're being shitty, while they are being shitty, in no way relates to "snowflakes" or "thin skin". 
---
I'm just giving you your own shit back and you don't like it, so you're going to the party line of "Snowflake/thin skin".
---
You're just being a dick and saying you're right in a place you know it's unwanted.  Why are you like this?  What did the world do to you?  Is there therapy available where you live?  
---
Regardless, you'll show Dad one day, you're the toughest!  Who beat the shit out of Kingdom Hearts?!?! YOU DID!  
---
You got this champ, just 6.99 billion other people to shit on for no reason in the mean time.
---
&gt;And the only one of those that isn't an absolute ghost town is fo4.
---
Probably has something to do with the other two games being so old. But I'm glad you agree that your claim about it being created because /r/fallout hated FO76 is false.
---
So now we're back to the original claim by Shoelace that there were other "safe spaces" created before, and a lack of any evidence of that.
---
You can farm them.  Basically, for any session, there's a possibility that you'll get a Camden Park quest for going there or entering the Ash Heap region in general.
---
It never will be, I suspect it will be similar to gtao. Random sweeps and patch what they can.
---
My camp was on a cliff side and the spawn was in the air for some reason. I always wear power armor, so didn't give a shit. My buddy hates PA, so his spawn went worse.
---
Just a comment to boost the activity :)
---
I have lots of radaway and maybe a recipe for them kicking around you can also join up with me and my buddies who just started up (I’m level 130 something they’re 20 and 40) so I just help them get geared and leveled up
---
They have no interface like this. Of all the things this game needs. This ain't it.
---
High vendor prices are to favor player trading. As making them all cheap would fuck over alot of people who grinded the plans from treasure maps and events before the change.
---
Haha, thanks a ton! I appreciate the support.
---
Exact same thing happened to me when I did that mission as well, plus the guy dropped a bunch of legendaries for me too.
---
I pay it forward whenever I can
---
Omg the canvas bags!
---
Awesome. Yea I just hit 45 so it opened up a lot of new weapons and armor for me. I have a ton of stuff they can pilage through as well
---
Thanks for this!  I just started needing large amounts of ultracite .50 so this helps tons
---
The dragon is a variant of the Black Powder Rifle and can spawn instead. Its a unique weapon so to speak. It can drop in legendary form. I got a TSE Dragon. 
---
Interesting. I thought about rush questing but wasn't sure if it pays off, Ill give it a shot, thanks.
---
No it affects it for me
---
Let the dying game die.
---
Subscribe to both. r/Fo76 for news, updates, technical stuff, and "serious" conversation. r/Fo76FilthyCasuals for memes and random bullshittery.
---
"IF YOU CAM READ THIS SIGN I'M PROBABLY HITTING YOU WITH IT"
---
This right here. I collected a bunch of them thinking they’d look cool strewn about my camp.
---
Totally forgot that when you drop something, it’s in the damn brown lunch bag.
---
I’m dumb lol.
---
I think event is fun. You get to kill a lot of enemies that drop loot and you fix a power plant. Accessing the master control terminal and restarting the plant is one of the best sounds in the game for me.
---
&gt; lolz, get your head out of your ass bud. No I don't want to see your photoshop projects.
---
Someone got hurt/jealous... bodybuilding.com doesn't allow photoshop btw.
---
&gt; And telling people they're being shitty, while they are being shitty, in no way relates to "snowflakes" or "thin skin".
---
Are you sure ? You didn't give me anything back as you had no leverage in this discussion my friend.
---
Seems like you're just butthurt because you got scammed by Bethesda and when someone point it out you go rage defensive mode for no reason. It's your own fault, man up and grow some skin so you won't get stress out for being a snowflake.
---
PS: Seems like a "child" game being more successful than fallout 76 really got you mad as you wont stop talking about it.
---
It's ok, you will grow up, just check it off, Spidey. lol 
---
Well, brand damage, lost confidence in the product, and dedicated player base ... those things are lost without some kind of miracle.
---
Gladiator only influences one handed weapons. gauntlets are not one handed, they are more like an unarmed and only get an increase from iron fist. I just tested it. 
---
I run unyielding melee. My strength is around 35 all the time. I can one punch level 91 death claws and have taken out the SBQ with my buzzy blade. 
---
That’s perfect, I’m gonna be offline tonight but anytime this weekend you need some help let me know gt CommunistRaptor, also have some great reputable sources for gear if there’s anything your looking for I can inquire with them
---
What’s your build, as I may have stuff you might like or be able to use
---
U mean the unnecessary grind?
---
FYI this happened to me kinda but I looked around where the SBQ fell when killed and saw a persistent meat pile. waited 10 mins and the SBQ loot popped in it.
---
Polygon has more credibility than Bethesda right now.
---
I'm only wedding fertilizer bags and flower pots, no concrete
---
Thanks for this! I like it, but it darkens it a bit much. I'm going to keep running it as over all it is a nice improvement. 
---
Yea a 3* Civil Unrest id definitely want to keep around.
---
Wondering when this game will unveil 5* weapons/armor
---
As long as they aren't giving you id cards, keys, notes, or holotapes, take everything you're given. It doesn't ruin or spoil anything. There are literally thousands of plans and he could have saved you a lot of grinding later.
---
However, thanks for posting this. It helps me understand why some people refuse to take the gifts I'm giving. Just trying to be nice and be the player I would've liked to have met when I was low level.
---
Yeah good they kept those duped items in game... lol
---
I don't mind grouping, my in game friends don't play this anymore unfortunately. Ill look into the crafting thing though, as I have plenty of mats on my mains. Thanks.
---
Please upvote for visibility! Thank you
---
Finally feeling comfortable about converting my TSE\*\* .50 cal to prime. I had a Suppressor\* .50 cal too, but sadly that disappeared during the deduping this week. Funnily enough, I had a piece of armor disappear that I bought with caps, so was suspect, but the machine gun dropped for me, so I know it was clean. If I still had both, I'd have converted one of them after today's flux successes. Instead I'm still using up the last 4k non-ultracite .50 I have on hand, but I'm up to 1500 ultracite .50 cal too.
---
Each time you log into a new server 
---
Wow really?  So you can just farm the crap out of them?
---
So old yet the new vegas circle jerk is alive and well. So if all the people that were hated in r/fallout moved to r/fo76, and then the people that were hated in r/fo76 moved to r/fo76filthycasuals, what does that signify? A second safe space? I think so. Who gives a shit when the sub was made, if it gets populated for an entirely different reason than the game just existing.
---
I'm not even sure why the poaching is happening either. It's not like there's a mod message or something asking people to, everything I've seen says it's organic and random acts from the community, but just *weird* how prevalent it's become. 
---
Yes though for me the game will start freezing after about 10 servers 
---
Welcome to the world of online games! Where they need to keep  you playing for as long as possible so the servers actually have people on them! 
---
Literate seems bugged to me. No mater how many magazines I read, It doesnt show up.
---
I had a camp on the acid vent not far from there, but didn't even keep it there a day. Too many mobs, especially scorchbeasts, as there was a fissure there when I was there. But mirelurk queens and tons of super mutants too. I ended up moving to the acid vent near Top of the World, and yeah, my travel costs have increased since my two locations in the Mire.
---
 i understand its very popular and I have always had to pick from less perks, but really? To have the game target for me is not something I can live with.  
---
 Aiming down the scope is easy enough but using my big ass pistol to knock down bugs is quite satisfying. I'll use a sword for a few but chops are nice and mine are pretty good. Nothing like when I played a lot of Q3, but alright.
---
 Since Fallout 4, the game is a not bad shooter, so my game is just fun now.
---
Prewar nationalists?
---
Heres a comment about duping that made me laugh so hard i fell of my chair:
---
Did it. It was pretty fun at the time.
---
Getting caps is a bitch in that game. Having a pile of nukas means I didn’t have to spend my time every 24 hours hoping between vendors to move of pile of supplies to get each vendor’s max caps. Or server hop to farm caches that are now restricted as well.
---
I also didn’t like to run around with broke armor and weapons, so I duped enough supplies to handle that so I didn’t have to regret getting into a fight as I traveled. Scorch beasts are really tough enemies, like crazy hard to beat even in end game gear, and they are everywhere. They take hundreds of rounds and a handful of stimpacks to take down and give effectively no loot or experience. Most people I know just server swap when they run into one. I’d rather try to fight it out, but if I play the game straight I’d be out of resources after taking one down.
---
Breaking down weapons is a pretty common way of getting materials, but weapons are crazy weapon, a single trash rifle can be 30 lbs. of your maybe 250 lbs. carry weight limit. You can go over that limit, but they you can’t fast travel and walk really slow. Storing extra weapons is also punishing because you only had 600 lbs. of storage per character. It was pretty common to make a mule character to carry all your extra gear, but to stop the dupers they put a hard carry limit of 1500 lbs. on all characters.
---
All in all Beth has been making the games less fun since launch, and duping was a way to make my own fun and play the game in a way that was fun. I didn’t share my loot, I just did my own thing and treated the game like a single player game that people occasionally wandered into. If they really wanted this multiplayer utopia they should have done more to support and balance it
---
I'll buy you one and sell it to you for what I paid. I'm on PC as well. Or we can team up for a sec so you can fast travel to the vendor that has it and buy them yourself. At your level you shouldn't really have any issues in Watoga or Harper's Ferry as long as you're careful. ID is gilpo. Let me know.
---
I refuse to read 20 magazines. Also i dont have 20 so im storing them until i do. But thats my last one. Easiest fallout to get all achievements
---
The loading issue seems better since the deduping.
---
I claimed that twenty minutes prior and then went back to my camp. I had pacifist mode on. That means what you're saying is nonsense. Something I did 20+ mins before means I can be instantly killed? That's so dumb
---
Yeah TSE .50 cal prime is what I've started using in the last couple of weeks.  It has been a TON of fun but good god I am always making ammo for it.  I need a nuke spot where I don't just use the ammo I'm trying to horde while collecting flux for it
---
&gt;Last week I had a couple of asshats griefing me and I tried to server hop but it kept putting me back in the same server. After 3x I just logged off and played something else. 
---
Same. That's why my base was destroyed. Guess not enough players
---
Well the corporatists running the big corporations Pre-War. We are the survivors and can remake the world as we see fit :)
---
(Technically we’re pre-Liberty Prime at the capital too!)
---
Believe what? 
---
Love it!
---
It's been a bug for weeks now since they last patch.
---
They probably won't because of certain old time cap glitches. 
---
After the TSE nerfing, I built up a melee configuration. My daily grind got cut in half, because I was no longer constantly replenishing steel and lead. The only times I go back to my heavy gun configuration are when I'm running a silo, and need to take out turrets, or in SBQ fights, when she's not on the ground.
---
I'm not one those crazy maxed sorts, but with my *** bloodied super sledge, low health, and martial arts and incisor perk maxed, I can finally feel like I'm doing some damage to her.
---
Kinda hard to glass cannon on my melee main but imma  try it on my sneaky alt
---
This has been fun, thanks for entertaining me at work.
---
My team has had fun observing you go full Neckbeard and even pull out how big your muscles are.
---
I truly couldn't give a fuck about Fallout, a quick platinum and then deleted until new content and patches.  As for Kingdom Hearts, I've heard its great, just not my deal.  I wanted to shit equitably, so I shat on your easy target.
---
A scam would mean I didn't get what I was promised.  I bought that game weeks into release, I knew the hot garbage I was investing in.  Keep reaching, you'll get there, maybe.
---
I am butthurt, but only about shitty individuals spreading their trash around good places that were meant for informative discussion.  Not for you to take out your daddy issues on.
---
I at no point defended Beth or their game, its a heap, we know it.
---
I just pointed out you were being a piece of shit, you went into full dick-mode and couldn't make any salient points, so just resorted to repeating the words sheep, snowflake, and talking about my skin.  
---
The only leverage I have is that you keep being a dick.  From your first post until now, you haven't missed a chance to insult people.  
---
Dad will be proud.  You're growing up just like him.
---
Ask for a refund before its too late.
---
It actually is true. If you claim a workshop your open for pvp as long as you are on that server. Your camp is free to be destroyed too.
---
People just need to Reclaim your workshop, step out of the cycle and then travel to you. Even with Pacifist on they can do full damage on you. Its pretty stupid. 
---
"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN THE BODY DESPAWNED"
---
Ah, so now we have a new argument, then. That this sub as populated because of all the hate in /r/fallout. Do you have some proof of that?
---
Dear vault lords please. I need this in my life. I think mine would say something like, " SOMEBODY PLEASE SHUT ROSE UP"
---
Unless he got paid its still a bad deal.
---
Does it have to be BOS? I have unyielding combat armor, but it’s level 30 for a left arm and 50 for a right arm.
---
That card only apply to workshop items.
---
theres a prydwen inspired camp i fond on youtube. impressive what people do with their camps. i'll link it when i find it again
---
so I can basically just finish the quests log out and back in?
---
*Press x to doubt
---
Something to do with Campfires
---
Well there you go lol
---
I don't actually know how to do that but I've seen a video on YouTube about how to do it.
---
I'd like to see some progression of this game.
---
I just bought the brick set and I hate how ugly the inside white wall is! My base is just me trying to cover them up with pictures but I don’t even have the cat and dog ones yet :(
---
My wife's name is jill and she did not like this post
---
I'm sorry is that an issue? What if I want to say "no"
---
What system you play on? I got a group of guys that play on PS4

VILLAGER NEWS

I totally get that VATS isn't your thing and I agree that the series got better as a shooter as it progressed. I actually enjoy both using VATS and not using VATS. Pick any decent FPS in memory and I've probably played it ad nauseum, and they don't have auto-targeting. I understand where your disdain is coming from because auto-targeting is definitely a cheat in those games. In this one, it's a feature, and I like having VATS as an option especially for those times when I want to relax a bit instead of doing some hardcore twitch gaming.
---
There isba youtube video on how to do it last week, as well as posting on here.
---
Don’t know if I’ll get downvoted for this but I used to run a swastika on it, and used the nazi soldier cosmetics for heavy from Wolfenstein and the metal arm for heavy. Looked like a thicc nAzI
---
Dude, me TOO. That'd be amazing.
---
&gt; This has been fun, thanks for entertaining me at work.
---
&gt; My team has had fun observing you go full Neckbeard and even pull out how big your muscles are.
---
Happy to help, as you're probably hurt by being scammed and jealous because after the "neckbeard" insult backfired.... wait wasn't you who were talking about insults or something ?
---
&gt; I truly couldn't give a fuck about Fallout, a quick platinum and then deleted until new content and patches. As for Kingdom Hearts, I've heard its great, just not my deal. I wanted to shit equitably, so I shat on your easy target.
---
Oh... I get it you're one of those people who cares about virtual "achievements", that explains a lot.
---
You are free to have an opinion about anything you like, the difference is that one is a success and the other.... well you know as you play it, again everyone has their opinion and I'm fine with it as I'm not a thin skin person as some people....
---
&gt; I just pointed out you were being a piece of shit, you went into full dick-mode and couldn't make any salient points
---
So much for linking to the dictionary lol, anyway...
---
You're clearly very butthurt to keep making these text walls, it's ok kid, you will grow up one day and realize how fool you've been. It's just a game after all, you been scammed by being naive (or just some of those kids addicted to virtual "achievements").
---
I would recommend that you focus on real things as a better job, a girlfriend, maybe take some classes, who knows it may turn you into a more knowledgeable person.
---
Yup. That's the one
---
Thanks! 
---
Thanks!
---
 Plan your route around three things: distance of travel, location of cap stashes to the vendor (The enclave one is easy, if you use the service entrance you can hit 2 cap stashes between spawn and the vendor for example) and quick, easy to complete daily/quests. Best example is Grafton Day since it takes 10 seconds to drop the ol' monster and you get caps off the corpse and off the mission... also there are two stashes between spawn location and the Vendor inside the town, just sayin. 
---
You are very welcome.
---
PC thanks for the offer though
---
Duh.  But once u have nothing else u can sell and nothing else u can store cause ur stash and carry capacity is full.  There is nothing end game to stay online for hours to do.  People log on.  Do their daily cap run and the screw off for a little and go find another game to play til tomorrow.
---
I read somewhere that someone got banned for using the letters to write racist slurs. I’ll look for the article. 
---
Well... I guess I'm gonna go cuddle with my dog and cry for a bit
---
get over it. you can break things in 76. if someone attacks your camp just serverhop. they arent going to make it so you cant have your camp broken
---
Best use I've seen of the stacked foundation build is someone out it right behind the Whitespring Gold Club to block and troll players who put up turret bases
---
for anyone else looking, i just found the sack hood on a table at sons of dane compound inside the bucks den. there are a few different spawns so you might have to server hop for a bit to get it. sack hood with no hoses!
---
Jill looks coolest at level 10. But level 80 is pretty close.
---
I'll be interested in what you have to say when you specifically pull over 250 raw violet flux, which incidentally will never happen at Whitesprings, because it doesn't spawn there, period. 600 flux total is irrelevant. Based on what I saw this morning, and the previous thread about this, I think a little under 250 is the max for Prime.
---
"LOCK HER UP!"
---
Is it not self explanatory from the context of TSE legitimacy. Even now there has been shade thrown on if its just the 1% banned that continued to play the game, but how about the other percents. 
---
 Stalker? The best video game ever made and my favorite. The mods are to die for ,the game is near perfection as a game.
---
 It may too hard for you. ;)
---
 I have been trashing the new Metro 'cause wow, is COD all we can do now. ;)
---
I would rather have picture frames at mu camp that display my gallery photos. 
---
Protest signs don't do enough damage. I would never use them for normal battle. 
---
thats a you problem. I beat her hours ago no problem
---
As I understand the notes, they removed most of the copies of specific items that were duped, but left at least 1 copy. That would explain why I didn't lose anything. It's likely mine were duped, since they're statistically so rare, but I only had the one copy of each and they were given to me. 
---
Search r/fallout in this sub. Plenty of results talking about how the sub is terrible and can't discuss the game at all there. Post again if you feel the need but I am done here. I didn't stop here for a semantics argument. 
---
 I'm pretty sure that's a feature. ;)
---
It clearly isn’t a me problem if 15 people together couldn’t do it...
---
&gt; But it does make me wonder about B saying that fewer than 1% of accounts had duped items removed.
---
1% of all accounts.   Not 1% of *currently active players.*
---
So while it might be 1% of all accounts, it could be a much larger percentage of people actively playing.
---
Also, it seems that there were players with tens of thousands of items, so just one of those on a server probably caused issue.
---
I'm sorry if neckbeard hurts your feelings.  I didn't realize you were sensitive to that.
---
We're talking in a video game forum here bud, bashing virtual is just a fail.  Yep I got some points.
---
Again with the thin skin?  We talked about this.
---
I just keep addressing each point you make with my own, no walls intended.
---
Again, if you don't understand scam, look it up.  
---
Job's cool, wife's cool, dual ticketed trades person (thats a few classes, eh?)
---
Knowledgeable has nothing to do with calling out a dick when you see one.
---
So again, thanks for coming to the fallout 76 subreddit to shit on virtual strangers to get your rocks off.  This will definitely help you get insight on how to get out from mom's basement and meet people.
---
And remember, no matter how tough you get, you're still just a tough dick.
---
Yeah, you aren't locked out for the whole day or anything like that.
---
You won't *always* get them, but there's a pretty high chance you will.
---
They should add a feature where the game works properly haha
---
Damn those are all city miles
---
You can, by changing them to brick, or steel. Also, by building concrete reinforcement walls around them.
---
Negative, but once they finally decide to add more content to the game, I will be back to attack some more challenges.
---
Welcome to basically all modern journalism
---
Oh yeah, I remember swastikas too. Shrek porn, offensive terms for any group of people alive, sexual fan art of tf2 characters, the list can go on and on
---
maybe 15 people with level 5 pipe revolvers, no perks, and no ammo couldn't do it. we had 10 and took it down in about 8 minutes
---
I sorta just said fuck it to power armor since the game is so broken I don’t even need it to survive radiation. I would like to say how but I’m kinda scared that it would be removed.
---
The post says “mostly TSE”
---
The post says “mostly TSE” and only 4 people were under level 50.
---
I heard the more people who join the event, the more Resistance and health she gets. If you were joined by say 10 people lower level who shouldn't have been participating because they can't pull their weight, it can cause problems
---
Well damn, as if Charisma wasn't already undervalued...
---
TSEs just don’t cut it anymore. 
---
To give you an idea of just how bad the balancing is, I joined a bloodied player for 5 SBQs this morning. Not a single fight lasted more than 3 minutes. 
---
So what’s the new “best weapon” meta?
---
So what exactly do the fluxes do? I've never used them, lvl40
---
bloodied weapons are great but its risky runnin around on such low health..i tried it and kept dying lol
---
If you’re ok with running 20% health constantly, bloodied. The guy was doing almost all of the damage and was using melee. You could see his hits take down her health.  The chunks it took off were that big. 
---
Thank you for your life story. It was meh
---
I choose a Perception Rifleman perk and got 1 in Ebdurance instead...smh.
---
It also says shitpost
---
Ban Bots!  Not the Bomb!
---
Sorry, just stuffed a Lv40 Anti Armor Hatchet in the register at Artisan's Corner, I can no longer bury it.
---
Everyone else here said productive things except you, just saying.
---
my team mate did this..then put carpet and toolboxes near the entrance..its impossible for anyone to get in..and the conrete floors cant be destroyed by players or even a nuke..
---
Nice, I never thought of that.
---
Yet another reason they need separate PvP servers.
---
What platform? I'm on PC and am willing to help you through the quest chain or at least keep the mobs off you as you run.
---
Underarmor linings, prime receivers, ultracite ammo for those prime receivers, decom shower, fusion cores, ultracite PA, orbital strike beacons, orbital scan beacons ...
---
Exactly. This game caters to the 1% shitheads who like to just grief people and piss them off for fun
---
After they removed colors for the decal tool I remember that one of the Nazi signs sold for like 15 Keys. 
---
It’s too bad that’s all you can use now, since they took sprays out of the game. Never used it myself but always saw spies setting up hentai backstab traps xD
---
No that's not like Fortnite. Fortnite you build a a wall, then it can be upgraded I think two times using more resources each time, and upgrading its total HP each time. You can do that for all types, wood, brick, or metal.
---
Hasn't happened to me since the TSE nerfing. Silver lining?
---
&gt; I'm sorry if neckbeard hurts your feelings. I didn't realize you were sensitive to that.
---
Not at all, I just found ironic coming from someone who was crying about insults.
---
&gt; We're talking in a video game forum here bud, bashing virtual is just a fail. Yep I got some points.
---
Not really no, we talk about playing a game for enjoyment as a hobby(at least adults do), no hacking up virtual points and "achievements" to show of to your friends. But it's understandable as young people tend to give to much value to stupid things.
---
&gt; Again with the thin skin? We talked about this.
---
&gt; I just keep addressing each point you make with my own, no walls intended.
---
&gt; Again, if you don't understand scam, look it up.
---
&gt; Job's cool, wife's cool, dual ticketed trades person (thats a few classes, eh?)
---
I think you should scam definition as you were the one who bought a half finished game... lol
---
Although I'm surprised ( IF TRUE ) that you have a stable job and a wife considering you get offended so easily, make you wonder how ones go through life.
---
I would still recommend you put your time in more constructive ways, as let be honest virtual "achievements" thing is very pathetic, maybe even get your own business and chain like myself.
---
&gt; Knowledgeable has nothing to do with calling out a dick when you see one.
---
Again thin skin over butthurt because was made a sucker.
---
&gt; o again, thanks for coming to the fallout 76 subreddit to shit on virtual strangers to get your rocks off. This will definitely help you get insight on how to get out from mom's basement and meet people.
---
Seems like you're mad and keep trying to insult others here friend.
---
You're just a sucker who got scammed, a bit naive for an adult but hopefully you learned your lesson.
---
Thankyou, I didn't need this to stack foundations, but it solved a problem for me wanting to use foundation stairs inside a home
---
I was the same way. Level 165 presently; when they nerfed TSE I switched to primarily a melee build, and then to a PA-optional build, a couple/few weeks back now. Took a week or two of real effort, but I finally weeded stuff down to rarely being overburdened. I still eat a lot of ribeye and grilled radstag and deathclaw steaks, sometimes bufftats, sometimes booze, when I'm acquiring lots of stuff, like a silo or nuke zone run. But, it's doable. For the longest time, I didn't think so, but I managed.
---
That said, I am at a point where I'm dumping more midlevel legendary gear than I'd like - the way items disappear (I've lost X01 leg armor, a suppressor's .50 cal, and a piece of \*\*\* unyielding BOS combat armor) I like to have backups, and maybe multiple configurations (like chameleon or weightless). I look forward to the additional 200 that's coming to our stashes.
---
Still on?
---
Wait what?!
---
youre a dick.
---
you keep reiterating as such.
---
you've got a chain, thats nice, but you should spend more time with your hotdog carts and not on reddit.
---
will you explain why you think its alright/not dickish to shit on people for no reason?  Otherwise I think you've proven all my points for me.
---
I'll stand next to you with a sign  
---
RICKY DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER
---
OJ DIDN'T DO IT
---
I've got one of those. Always keep it on standby when my Vampire Tesla gun isn't doing the job.
---
How much did you pay for it?
---
Ah, the old “find your own proof”.
---
Have a good weekend, mate!
---
Newly lvl 45..haven't even seen one yet. But between that and launching a nuke..both on my weekend bucket list lol. Gt GdaIV747 if your interested.
---
NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION
---
Acid vent?
---
There are places where you can extract resources that are not connected to a workshop?
---
Always good to hear stuff like this. It is a great community. I was skeptical about an online Fallout but it has generally been positive.
---
By the way getting an Excavator armor from someone can mess up the Miner's Miracles quest where you build one yourself. You may not get the plan for the armor or for the power armor station. 
---
Yeah, this. Once whoever called it in opens it, it’s fair game. 
---
I used one for about 20m it still did that
---
Ahh ok cool, i have had the orbital beacons. They are epic
---
Well I'm lvl 270 ish I'm not on right now so can't remember exactly what lvl but I still am having fun , it is slowing  a bit but is to be expected with as much time as I have , i try to treat it like playing diablo 3 I've done every quest in that game a billion times too but for me it's all about min/maxing gear waiting for that next event or dlc
---
Add me : GT : Manny Sandov 
---
Again with the insults, it's sad when someone lost an argument and have to rely on insults, ironically by the person who was crying and linking to INSULT on the dictionary... 
---
I'm the owner of 3 gyms, but it's funny to see an childish adult trying to personally attack you because they have such thin skin and got butthurt.
---
&gt; will you explain why you think its alright/not dickish to shit on people for no reason? Otherwise I think you've proven all my points for me.
---
Honestly there is not to explain, you're being delusional, not a surprise for someone who focus on virtual "achievements" really... nonetheless I simply pointed it out it was an obvious cash grab to milk sheep by Bethesda.
---
It's not my problem if people are snowflakes and get hurt by the fact they got scammed.
---
Players gather up at a spot with their signs and a PvP version of "Protest march" starts 
---
Well..the plan was to go sbq hunting.. I was level 43 at the time..pa was 45..so we went out and grinded for a while to get a couple levels..plan was to have e him build me one at my camp..not the greatest way about it but he offered..so.. but..around 4:30 orso..he bent down to hack the safe for the mayor for a day quest..and stopped..just hunched over there..I thought maybe he was digging through his pip boy..he had chameleo. Armor..so he fuzzed out..about 5 minutes go by and I hear him start snoring in the mic. I was laughing my ass off..got a picture with his blur..gave a salute to the greatest dude I've come across.. and ventured off on my own
---
I know it’s not the answer you want, but maybe they’re roleplaying as raiders. Y’know. The guys that’re assholes for no reason. 
---
Yea figures since I havent played for weeks. Is there something that can be done?
---
Yep. Acid vents, at least one oil seep, all the ores. 
---
This is the best thing on the internet right now. I'm enamored.
---
Yes, yes! YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
---
Gosh those water purifiers are ugly.  Nice build though.
---
They're my favorite way to take out wanted players, or to get them out of their fortresses CAMPs. My ideal is when they spot me, start taking shots at me, I toss it, turn around and act like I'm simply leaving, and their world ends in fire. 
---
But at the end of the day, they can all be destroyed.
---
Red is also the colour of red-blooded, patriotic Americans. 
---
Yip, which is why I suggested the higher, but not infinate, rate of return.  But its still a bandaid. We need more content. More world bosses, more quests..just more to DO. Farming caps for plans can only amuse us for so long.
---
I’ve got a set I’ve started wearing when I’m looking to help newbies. Unpainted X-01 with glowing red eyes (if the Blackbird skin ever comes back I’m nabbing it quick), and my outfits the skeleton mask/costume. And for a weapon I’ve started using a flaming pitchfork.
---
Just gets me in a charitable mood.
---
I don't know. It would be nice if it did work that way, but even if it's only sprinting it's still not useless. You need to close a lot of distance as a melee on a ranged player. Having -75% damage while doing that isn't useless.
---
Yes few feel the effect of boycotts because in a lot of cases it actually isn't that popular an idea.  People really support echo chambers and so don't realize not many people outside of that echo chamber don't care. 
---
hahaha I also had a team mate fall asleep, though it wasn't mid quest
---
Pay for it? It was dropped by a legendary glowing one or glowing something.  Played for months without a decent drop from a legendary, then got this.  I already mentioned this was a rare drop.
---
  
---
So I paid nothing for it, just time in the game......
---
Na, the only way to pick a card is to pick a special first.
---
If you're looking at cards then you already chose a special
---
  The hero we need.  Thx.
---
I got a 2 shot fat man the other day, did a little over 500 damage (I'm not specced for heavy weapons at all) I left it in the register at Artisan's corner.
---
I did this on Fallout 4, it’s fun, huh?
---
another one popped in to my head.....
---
puny little human
---
make meat sack outta you
---
pull out all you organs
---
turn you into goo
---
when i finish slaughtering
---
i tell you what i do
---
is hang you from ceiling
---
make punching bag outta you!
---
+karma
---
If that was really off the top of the head, you're pretty talented. I think those two mission dialogues you wrote could be printed off and handed to the voice actors as-is. 
---
My question is, how the hell did you manage to build in Flatwoods?
---
Just apply a profanity filter like the last 3 Pokemon games
---
Duplicate Plans would be more useful if we could actually sell them. Its silly we can't.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about. Do you have any idea how much profit EA for example has lost from those "meaningless threats" to never buy another one of their games? Do you have any idea what damage Mass Effect Andromeda has done to their reputation? This isn't a few nerds on a forum echo chamber, this is real Mass Effect in action. People like you like to pretend and push the narrative that we are powerless. The government, the media, corporations, they love people to think and believe that. The fact is, as I said, the day is coming when people finally know their true power. Just like in the days of the general strikes and revolutions. This is our playground now. This is where we hone our skills playing games. Games teach us the lessons we need to learn that will be applied on a much wider scale.
---
Now that songs going to be in my head for hours....
---
No, Narnia.
---
Username/platform? Lol
---
The vendor in Grafton has the plans for the Excavator mods.
---
Okay I'm passing off Grahm. Sorry I couldn't hold him longer. It was one of my shorter gaming nights
---
I'm down. Will be on in 30 minutes or so. GT GuidedByVoices0 Will probably have one usual gaming buddy with me.
---
 Yes trolls are the reason development is slow, now back to reality anyone else have some input?
---
You can always just bulk junk and put it in the stash. Crazy thought but don't carry around 500 screws.
---
+karma!!!!  
---
pvp?
---
Ive been wondering the same thing. Have yet to see any change in the market or claim of items being removed.
---
Cool.
---
In game hat plans aren't currently working, same for union and confederate uniform hats
---
Hopefully some time away will reignite your passion in the game. Have a nice vacation!
---
You know what.  Sorry man, I have been childish.
---
I shouldn't pick on you like this.  I'll stop.
---
Have a nice day.
---
It's really the who?
---
I think I have a pretty good build. My aae shotgun with criticals wrecks. I need improvement in defense though.
---
I like to go around and help lower level characters. Yeah, it’s not the most entertaining thing to do, but I enjoy it.
---
His name is Petercheeks on Xbox
---
Completing daily/weekly/world challenges, hanging with other people, building camps. That's all I do nowadays
---
[removed]
---
I had this problem too, I think I had multiple of a quest item, so I dropped 1 of them specifically
---
Woah.
---
Just hit 109, I've been stock piling ammo for the past few days, now I'm about to remake my excavator suit at level 45. Then I'll see about modifying it and my X01. Launch a nuke every other day or so on Whitesprings or Fissure prime and farm for legendaries, working towards a full suit of Weightless, Troubleshooter, Bolstering etc. Thinking about making a new toon to run around with my buddy that just got the game, made him deep pocketed armor set as well. Set your own goals and personal quests man.
---
You can select a perk and special separately.  It happens by accident if you browse thru perk cards after initially selecting a special.  It is by design.  But most people don’t realize it. 
---
Well, the defense stats don't agree with you. Unless, lvl24 Assaultron has higher HP than lvl50 Protectron somehow.
---
Even if someone is relativly close to your spot it might not load.
---
There is no one in my general vicinity. I've loaded into 20 different servers. I've exhausted that explanation.
---
i see..so its only.good for melee really if you have to be sprinting..not very often i find myself sprinting while shooting
---
What a twat
---
Sentinel is better for shooting as you would be standing still.
---
Read the card....
---
It would be pretty cool if the game allowed you to write anything but gave you bounty for certain words xD
---
Why did you put quotes around the word  'the' ?   Haha. 
---
Achievements are wonderful and encourage people to play deeper than 'the' regular game. 'The' whole point of them is to get people to play 'the' game longer and more than once. Maybe you just don't grasp 'the' concept. 
---
Alot of range PVP players use sentinel assassin which is impenetrable but to a few things, but it is weak to melee. Melee running at range player will be shot down before he gets to them unless wearing cavaliers.
---
Agreed we need more content for you to sell us before actually fixing the game or releasing in game content. (/S)
---
At least a ghoul mask like fallout 3
---
I always assume high level high hp. Maybe that's the reason. HP may not has linear relation with enemy level. But enemy type.
---
For me.   Thats easy. Raise the prices on items.  But let me sell all of this junk I'm finding. Now I have an item I'm saving for and I'm going back out into the wasteland to find more stuff. Probably won't help high level players.  But at this point a minimal number of caps won't either.
---
I do understand they need to keep players playing their game.  But it's starting to feel like an Android game that gives u so many action points per hour.  I log on I play and then I log off and play another game once my points are gone.
---
I SHAVED MY BALLS FOR THIS!!! 
---
Oh, That makes more sense. Still seems like a stupid design but at least now I know to watch for it.
---
In game time.  I'm only guessing about the time.  Vendors refresh their caps every 20 hours.  Based on some things I've noticed in game I'm pretty sure the refresh time for world items should be the same.  I could be wrong of course.
---
Thank you thank you thank you!
---
Yes. I saw that, asked the person who wrote it to delete it, it wasn't authorized, or sanctioned by us. 
---
I think this is all about perspective.  I don't think the game changed loot wise much,  and your encountering griefers is circumstantial. 
---
I'm glad you are back and enjoying yourself but I think you might just be seeing it through a different shade of spectacle.
---
Seen Grahm for the first time today since playing on the beta, bought a plan off him.
---
You can find me....well, more appropriately, if you're an evil doer, Death will come for you, and I am it's Shroud! On xbone @ ISilverShroudI :3
---
Or, he could do whatever he wants. 
---
That is actually an insanely popular spot, I was just up river from there in line of sight and I had neighbours every time I logged in. 
---
Sometimes it bugs out if someone is in your spot and it'll keep saying it on login. I've had to server hop 10 times for it to come back once. 
---
I've been looking at Grafton for days of server hopping for a few hours a day. I'm pretty sure they aren't available anymore. One of the most frustrating things about this game is that they make big changes and the community can't keep up. Nobody seems to know where these plans are anymore.
---
Looks good.  That's what the grind does for in a week.
---
It can be expensive to repair all of you have high level builds. Also defenses won’t do jack against players with explosive weapons 
---
"Sir, I don't know about you, but I bathe and then wash my clothes with the bath  wayer once a week with boiled water. I also brush my teeth every day. We are not savages, my good man." - Zeke Lee Johnson (my main  character)
---
pretty sure that there are multiple teams for various areas so your point is moot
---
i hope you're a chick 
---
He's not using the appropriate perk to reduce the speed at which they drain and also possibly taking a lot of damage. I'm not 100% but after a big fight VATS or not you'll notice you've used a lot. I suspect it's actually damage that effects it
---
Yeah.... HW is tough as a lot of the perks we need to make the game fun we don't get until waaaaaayyyyyy later in game.  I made it to lvl 40 before I took any weapon perks and it was boring. I don't have any useful advice but I will say it is worth it, I really enjoy my HW build now.
---
Do you like beer? Because I drank a lot when leveling my HW build.
---
I understand that's a possibility, but I've logged in when there was absolutely no one around me at all. I wish that were the case, as I'm still continuously trying this method, but I had so many switches in my house that i think it's having a problem loading it correctly.  I've run into things where switches are visually on but not actually on, so even though the green light is on, it doesn't recognize it as on.  I had a few powered speakers and I think that may be an issue if that much is true.  But I'm still going to continue to try the original method.
---
Clearly you’ve not done much protesting. lol
---
Yes, please.  400 would be good.  Everything costs a fortune now.
---
WILL MAKE SIGNS FOR CAPS
---
It would be cool if we could put crops in potted plants in our camps to make a sort of greenhouse, you see plants you can take in pots quite a bit around the map too bad we can’t make our own
---
As others have said the radius is very very very large.
---
I understand the radius is very large, but even still, I've checked the radius and there was no one around.
---
When you protest! You finish the damn chant!
---
I know one of my known plans had a worth of 600, too bad I couldn’t sell it for at least 100
---
Yeah, that kinda bothers me. Also, can they fix the powered door with keypad already?
---
When you Japanese Baseball! You finish the damn chant!
---
There, ftfy. 
---
Personally I collect good camp locations, designs and plans and do the daily/weekly challenges. 
---
Tried blocking them?
---
I would like for someone to accept my invite once in awhile. We don’t even need to play together. I just want to maximize my Empath Mutation. 
---
Wow, what a fantastic idea!
---
That's there into the vault for upcoming updates, it says it will arrive next week
---
Next week patch. yes 14th was a duping patch
---
How do you get those new cards? Mine has just sat at level 1 forever
---
I have never been happier to say that I am on PS4. Love your work, heard and seen all your shows, I am but a pale imitation, but strive to embody the spirit ;)
---
Sorry I can’t hear you over the sound of this flaming garbage wrapped in trash. 
---
Best idea ever. Change my mind.
---
Nope
---
&gt;What they (bethesda) did was a classic anti consumer tactic called bait and switch with a dash of false advertising.  
---
Bethesda Softworks or Bethesda Game Studios? They're two different companies. Only one is responsible for the actual game. 
---
They have the 3* legendary microphone (+25 servers to broadcast range)
---
It was very frustrating when I was farming.
---
I think maybe relogging multiple times can fix it but I'm not 100% sure.  Sorry :(
---
Let them destroy everything and kill them for free caps?
---
so sentinel works while firing your gun?  i was hoping that..because technically your moving if your firing a weapon
---
Disagree, I played last night after 3 weeks away. Hoped something would be fixed. My mutations broke within 10 minutes. Many weight issues, stats incorrect. When I can't even swing my hammer, I have no incentive to play.
---
Pro tip: you can shoot them instead of staying AFK like a bot and then  crying on reddit. And yes, it's very fun.
---
Now that's too cool!
---
The ID badge is a photo frame. It's under Vault Tec iirc. When you use that frame in photo mode it updates to your current level.
---
This would kinda be nice. Also a log to tell me which one of them bastards killed me while I'm loading in. 
---
There's other Bodies you can find, i'd suggest trying that? I don't know where your quest is glitched maybe you never got the worn veil? 
---
Sorry to disappoint!
---
Thank you!
---
i want the greenhouse walls from fallout 4 back
---
"We're totally positive over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals!" and "this sub sucks|don't come if you suck" is an...interesting selling point.
---
Which level is she at? Lol
---
Give me your best weapon you earned for "equality" ;)
---
I never get wanted from that but I also shoot them down before they land
---

A side effect of the F.E.V. is that the Super Mutant loses all secondary sexual characteristics.  You can't tell the males from the females just by looking at them.  You have to lift up the skirt.

The only interactions I had in this game were 3. Two higher levels (50s) gave me mines and stimpax for no reason at all which was dope and some level 100 dude kept killing me. To be fair I wondered in his camp and took a nap, not sure if that’s frowned upon. 
---
Travel at light speed when getting shot at... hell yeah...

It's specifically a problem with the Brick Building Set.  In past builds of my house, I decided to make that door piece part of the Warehouse Building Set instead and have that blend into the rest of my CAMP's brick scheme.
---
This is such a cool idea!!
---
It’s part of the game. Collecting resources and fixing your stuff is part of the game. The possibility of other players killing you and destroying your camp is part of the game. If you don’t want to defend, repair or switch servers then what? If you don’t want to collect basic resources then what? It’s not like you go on the game and this happens every time. There’s a lot more friendly players out there too.
---
No, because people in universe either become ghoulified or die from radiation. They don't just choose to be a ghoul, it's something in their genetics. Letting the players choose to be a ghoul would just overwrite previously established canon and make the threat of radiation non-existent. Why would anyone choose to play as a 'human' character in a radioactive wasteland when ghoul characters wouldn't have to worry about radiation, hunger or thirst. The ghoul mask from FO3 was/is an amazing idea however.
---
Vats is strong. Stealth/vats was nuts but they stealth nerfed......stealth.
---
Yeah I dropped the extras but still no luck. Fingers crossed for patch 6 I guess. 
---
I could be wrong, but I think it also takes into account players walking through that area too.  If someone happened to either pass through there or is actively standing there, they can block your CAMP from loading in.
---
I'm hoping the hotrod set comes back. It was gone from the store before I started playing.

Not exactly sure what Beth is going to do about this. Just leave her alone.

I typically carry about 1400 lbs, which gets reduced to about 700 with perks. Guess i'll need to make some adjustments in that respect, so I can fast travel after the launch. 
---
Def more walls and styles for building with.  I'd simply love having a paint sprayer or paint can system to paint all walls and certain structures into different colors.  
---
This is exactly why I'm always nice to others, unless they're actively trying to be a dick or selfish.  You never know what kind of day someone had in real life, and it's pretty shitty to just be ignorant of others sharing your world, real or online.  
---
I'm currently playing a power armor/melee character, but my main is a stealth sniper.  I so rarely use pistol ammo that I put a prime receiver on my western revolver backup ranged option (when I'm not melee-ing, 95% of the time it's trying to shoot a scorchbeast that won't land, the other 5% is me being lazy and shooting a super mutant up on top of a building, or tagging a legendary for others to get their hits in)
---
I know how valuable lead, gunpowder and extra ammo is for a ranged character.  My sniper can literally never have enough .308 or especially 5.56.  I always pick up gunpowder, shotgun shells, .45, 5.56, 50cal, and 5mm when they show up in my container loot.  I leave the open/shared stuff for others that may run through and desperately need it.  Ammo is really light, and with 365lbs of base carry weight it's hardly a problem to hang on to it until I can drop it into a blue suitcase at a train station.  I also have lead and plastic tagged for pickup and drop that off as well.  I understand shotgun builds can never have enough plastic.

Last time I was in a Nuke Zone around the Prime Fissure, I walked away with 144 Raw Violet Flux, which became 19 Stable Violet Flux with Super Duper.

Thats a good idea, but where do you get the challenge list from? I didnt see anything on a google search.

My first thought - use ! ! for the two eyes and ears.  Use a Q to the lower-right of the ! ! to form the body (the squiggly is its tail) and use a - placed under the ! ! for its mouth.  Might that work?
---
You’re right, we suck, stay away from us assholes.
---
If you wait and run around like 15-20 minutes after the event is over all the meat piles slowly show up with the loot even after the bodies have been long gone. As you pick some up more will appear. At least that’s what keeps happening for me lately.

---
Not from scrapping? I think I learned most of my mods from scrapping
---
For modular design, I thought maybe having the shutters as objects you snap onto windows you want them on.  That way dev artists and modders can design the wall structures and windows as baseline without adding specific windows + shutters and windows + no shutters, and we can just add the shutter objects onto the windows ourselves.   
---
It would also make finding a perfect "god roll" Legendary a bit too easy.
---
Not that I'm against the idea, just that I understand why they didn't do it.

Sounds similar - I got stuck in a crevice and when I respawned no chance at getting my bag back. Thanks for the offer - I’m out of town for a couple of days so maybe some of the frustration will where out and I’ll make another run at it.

A VATS power armor build huh? I forgo power armor on my VATS builds because Unyielding/Bloodied is just so powerful, especially for a vats build (Unyielding means more accuracy (perception), more AP (agility), faster crit gain (luck). The increased strength for carry weight, intelligence for XP gain, and charisma when I sell is just gravy on the cake ;)
---
The Core drain is also a consideration, but even without it I’d stick with bloody/Unyielding. 
---
Shown as I respawn I’m wiped out - even before I can bring the Pipboy up.

I don't run around in a clown suit or fastnacht mask, but I modeled my character after Ron Swanson from the Parks and Rec TV show.  Rod Swanson, Ron's great grandchild, moved to WV in 2070 to join the Free States movement.  When I'm not achieving the Swanson pyramid of greatness, I wear a park ranger outfit (shorts within the acceptable 6" parameters) and a slightly unruly mustache.  I take pity on non-Swansons and often offer my assistance when they seem to be in a pickle.
---
That isn't the only example, though admittedly a very poorly timed one. I've seen it happen on countless occasions, especially on salty posts about this sub.
---
Btw for what it's worth, I don't care either way whether or not you're recruiting for the filthycasuals sub. No skin off my nose. Original comment was more there for humour value rather than, idk, whatever else drove you to comment denying such actions.

"IF U CAN READ THIS U GETTIN SLAPPED!"
---
I got past that part by leading the hoard of ghouls over to the nearby entrance (I think to the north) and having the bots fight them. You can also hop from the rocks onto the little fence pillar at the gate and the ghouls can’t reach you there. The bots took out a few before going down, but I managed to cull the rest by luring them out, hopping on that fence post and putting in as many headshots in as I could before they ran off.
---
Fans and toy cars and trucks.
---
Not that big of a deal. They weigh nothing. ODC is strong in this one. I wouldn’t mind this being fixed but def not high priority over what I would rather they spend their time on right now. 
---
I wonder if that spot in particularly is a little buggy as it's right next to a workshop. Maybe if someone has claimed the workshop it won't load a camp near it? Not sure, must be pretty annoying though. Probably not worth the trouble, might just have to move. 
---
You gave him a screw? You got screwed in that exchange lol... Pun was not intended
---
Abandoned bog town, it's in the south east area, in the cranberry bog, but I wouldn't rate it as that dangerous, as there usually aren't that many high level players running around if you are a lower level.
---
There is a lot of stuff around town if you want to do a thorough search, but for a quick cache you go up the spiral scaffolding to the roof of the tallest building, there is a open elevator shaft, drop down, you are safe on the roof as enemies can't climb it, in this secret room there are a dozen typewritters, made of screws gears and springs, as well as globes and a lot of other misc items, 
---
the whole town is a pretty good source of most any material you could be looking for, with lots of stuff scattered around, meds, ammo, weapons, junk of all sorts, as well as multiple locations that spawn random plans and recipes. I would recommend checking it out as soon as you are level 30 or so.
---
I'm going to modify the standard Sugar Grove answer. Start off at the National Isolated Radio Array. There is a warehouse behind where you can scrap the stuff you pick up there. After scrapping, move on to the National Radio Astronomy Research Center, THEN go to Sugar Grove. 
---
All 3 locations are withing a few minutes walk, and the extra stops will add to your haul. And you'll kill some super mutants and scorched, mutants carry caps and you can vendor the weapons for even more money.

Better yet, if they attack you without first initiating PvP and then they hit you and die, they should award you caps!

Wendigos drop them, supermutants sometimes drop them, and ghouls drop them sometimes, scissors, typewriters, and portable gas tanks are good sources.

Bye, Felicia.
---
I build my house right next to those robots. It’s the best security system I’ve ever had
---
Lmao! I was gonna then decided nah. Thank you for this. 
---
Yes you could....
---
1) Where are your rocket turrets? Where are your defenses?
---
Defenses are useless against any decent player. Do almost no damage and pop in half a second. 
---
2) Why arent you attacking them? Most of them are wanted. Go away, sneak in and take out one by one.
---
Most players engaging in PvP are prepared for it. Stims ready, likely powerful weapons and a good chance they’re using Sentinel/Assassin gear. They’re seeking out PVP after all; most people will try and work an edge. 
---
3) If you are so weak, just server hop and problem solved.
---
True, although it sounds like he tried that and got dumped back on the same server
---
4) Even if they destroy your camp, their bounty is more valuable than the junks you are going to spend on repairing your CAMP. 
---
Not likely. I had someone wipe my alt base. Fusion generator, full crafting stations, lots of food, and 7ish water purifiers. I don’t think I saw his bounty go over 200. It takes a hell of a lot of junk to repair all that (yes, I know the move your camp trick. That’s a massive time sink to replace everything I had out.)
---
Also if it’s a team, they can just unteam and claim each other’s bounties for little cap loss and zero risk. I had a pair do that to my alt’s base as well. 
---
F#ck this is beautiful. I'd wish this would happen more often. I am never so lucky to get attacked by anyone.
---
You want PvP. Not everyone does. Good luck finding it.
---
Try moving your canp. See if it's still a problem. Then move back. I have made mine modular so I can set up quickly. I move every few days to the resources I need.

Geez. Sorry to hear about it dude. I'm assuming ya were one of the Blizz employees that got cut. Whats going on over there is awful =(

I think having a place to discuss the game without the drama of the day or whatever is fine. I just found the tone of the post to be pretty adversarial, especially considering that you're plugging a place of positivity. haha

Your name looks awfully familiar. My name is GucciMalcs on Xbox. If it was indeed you, I am super thankful. I was stuck there forever.

No, however that was awful to read about. Just your average middle America service manager at a dying car franchise. Sad part is I'm going to school for computer science now to get out of cars. Lol

So it’s not just me. That’s good to know. I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be eligible for that effect.

What games you gonna move on to? I got Metro today but haven't popped it in yet. 
---
Ironic this post comes right after someone else got traction and gold for posting they did the same thing yesterday.
---
FYI...it’s a common misconception that Pacifist Mode affects incoming damage. It doesn’t.
---
Pacifist mode exists only to prevent you from initiating unwanted PvP by accidentally shooting other players or their CAMPs.

If only they had released the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse or Hot Pink power armors last Valentine’s Day.

Considering the harsh environment I'm surprised the second picture isnt a headstone
---
the other day i saw a nuke that hit tangra town, there is a cave in the middle where 12? scorched spawned in the same spot every 2 minutes or so, i could hardly keep up with them and they all dropped masses. i kept that going until i was out of ammo and all my melee weapons were broken.
---
That is a really clever idea. They’ve gotta be way more proactive than turrets. I’ve lost so many gardens as my turrets just sat there laughing. I eventually scrapped the garden as the budget cost wasn’t worth price of repairing.

It's been reported, and some players are using it as a PVP exploit intentionally..

In the last few days Ive come across a bug regarding picking up Fusion Cores.
---
Platform is PC, it occurs whilst both in and out of power armor.
---
Regardless of how many fusion cores I have on me, say 26, if I pick one up, my weight increases, but the number of cores in my inventory does not. 
---
Today I have found 4 fusion cores, 2 in an ammo case, one on an enemy, one in the back of the van in Whitesprings, each time my carry weight has increased but my number of cores has stayed at 26. 
---
I first noticed it a few days ago when I grabbed a core out of a generator and the number of cores I had in my inventory didnt change.
---
What can I do to report this properly please?
---
It technically wasn't a patch since they didn't do any kind of client update. It was essentially a server maintenance. 
---
Lol Bethesda could hack my bank acct while telling me theyre just making improvements to my phone and they'd still have more credibility than Polygon.
---
And if there's no one in the area at all?
---
This is correct. The plan in-game assets get tagged in their data files with prefixes that enable them to be crafted at workbenches, appear in the Atomic Shop, etc. The workbench crafting tag is missing from the hats so the armor workbench cannot display them as craftable even if you learned the plan.
---
Great write up!  
---
Have a question about full screen vs windowed.   
---
'76, with no INI changes, was getting 90 - 100 FPS from beta to December patches, and then 2 back to back patches cost me a total of 60 FPS in windowed mode..  
---
Any clue what could have been in those updates that caused that, and what I could change to get back the 60+\- FPS?  
---
Running 3 monitors and (3) game clients at once, and non-windowed is a non-starter..  
---
I haven't made mine modular. I would like a permanent answer to this, rather than me having to rebuild an entire base every time I log in.

It's not an echo chamber when that's the overwhelming majority opinion on this game. People who didn't buy it don't like it, people who DID buy it don't like it, and then people who *stuck* with it don't like it. Just because you think the dogshit smells like flowers doesn't mean the place is a "cesspool" for not thinking the same way.
---
Oh that's great news thanks for sharing that with me. Glad I could help and i'm sure Bethesda will deliver soon enough, even though I know they are not priorities. I have a 3\* AAE gatling laser I am itching to bust out properly when I don't have to repair it every 6 minutes.  
---
If I think of anything else i'll be sure to let you know, a lot of my issues are covered in your post which makes me happy. This is a bit greedy perhaps but what about the possibility of them working on textures for certain weapons that cannot be explosive. Not the weapons that already are explosive, I mean ones such as the crossbow, Railway rifle or plasma rifle (which is limited to 1\* anyway). They are doing it for the lasers/plasma gatling atm so maybe it's a quick fix? 
---
Go to Watoga. 
---
Go to Vendor Bot Phoenix.
---
Walk to the Northeastern-most Building, it's just past Phoenix. It looks like a small restaurant/cafe (Not to be confused with the Diner just southeast of it).
---
Look on the Table next to the Perfectly Preserved Pie machine. There's a good chance to find a Magazine on it.
---
Look on the Magazine rack left of the Pie machine. There's a good chance to find a Magazine on it.

---
Not sure I understand the textures bit
---
The 44 and the western revolver are pretty good pistols if your looking for one shot capability.  Otherwise I'd say the 10mm is probably as good as its gonna get.

+5% damage per 5% health loss
---
But can it eat cars?
---
Yes I’ve seen a few of those. With the multi shot canister it holds 12 shots!
---
Never seen one with +10% damage while aiming though. Very weird 
---
Mr Handy, I don't feel so good. 
---
Lemme check and make sure which plans I have 
---
The patch for the vendors goofed up the Grafton vendor and the bot doesn't have the plan right now. I think it's going to get fixed as I read it was unintentional. 
---
Waiiiit nah of course it doesn't (because they really didn't want energy weapons to ever be a thing for some reason), well I have a furious explosive one too so I was ready for that lol. Deffo needs to reduce energy resistance too for sure.   
---
Will do, i'll hop on tomorrow and try to remind myself of anything.There is quite a lot on it already though so if it isn't major i'll wait.  There's even stuff like the flamer being unreasonably hard to sustain. Even though I could just grab a lighter/can of deodorant and make one myself for no effort. On behalf of everyone I thank you! This game has so much potential they just need to put a bit more work in, nice to see others trying too.  
---
Ah. Well best of luck with the CompSci! Good path to take. Working on that myself! Future proofing myself since that stuff is gonna be needed. Lol the robots arent gonna program themselves ya know.
---
It really just doesn't feel good that I need to spend like 100+ bullets per event and I'm having a hard time getting my hands on that many.
---
It's made my playing be more about clearing low level content over and over and dreading anything above scorched or ghouls. 
---
The 308 works fine against super mutants so long as I stay hidden, but mole miners were a massive pain.
---
I've got a Somerset Special that works great but am lacking bullets for it, and it's only level 5 so it'll lag behind soon enough. Oh well. I'll have to reevaluate my pistol choice I suppose.
---
Yep exactly, everyone enjoying the game abandoned /r/fallout, which left them with nobody to argue with so they just picked right back up where they left off over here. That, plus the fact that this is the sub Bethesda choses to interact with so they took it as an open invitation to direct their bitching in this direction instead of keeping it contained in /r/fallout.
---
My little "epic moment" today was during a Scorched Earth (the nuke was centered on prime unfortunately for non PA folks).  A sniper in a hazmat suit fell off the building they were camped on and got beat down by a scorched yao-guai and some random scorched.  They put up the "help" emote and I was less than 20 yards away, so I sprinted and smashed the fog crawler to stagger it, stimpaked the guy/girl and proceeded to try and grab all the trash aggro around them until they could get back on top of the building to focus on the queen that refused to land.  I'm pretty useless against the flying queen with only a minor in pistol perks, so I focus on keeping trash off gun folks while she's in the air.  The queen was on her last 25% of health, so it would be shitty to have to sprint back into the fight from pretty far away and potentially lose your event loot if you're not back in event radius when she falls.  Scorched Earth is pretty hectic, but they gave me a heart emote once they were back in position.  I thought that was really nice they took the time to do that, but it was the least I could do while being in full T-51 protection with a heated instigating super sledge.  A rifle user is much more valuable than I am in winning the event while she's flying, so backup medic duty is fine with me.
---
I mean that the only reason I can gather than the aforementioned weapons aren't explosive is because they'd have to change the projectiles. An explosive railway rifle wouldn't make sense if it left the spike in terrain still, which is something physical you can stand on.  
---
That has reminded me of another bug though, the player is unable to pick up crossbow bolts in the wild. I am unsure if this is intended, at places like the Bootlegger's shack in the Bog there are some bolts on a shelf which look like they should be lootable. Anywhere else I see them I can't pick them up either
---
They were probably guarding it for a friend to come back and claim but no you’re not bad they’re just poor at PvP 
---
Ah I have deep pocketed marine limbs, robot limbs, and trapper chest 
---
&gt;It can if you reprogram locks and keys to work that way. Currently they don't.
---

And that is the real issue. They should tackle the item overload through superior programming, not by blaming the people playing the game. Just the fact that the server keeps track of every key that is on on every player at all times, is a sign of how sloppy and wasteful of resources the programmers were. 
---
This would actually be pretty cool. Kinda like temporary serums. Maybe not meat, but use their blood at a chemistry station to make serums. 
---
LOL
---
If you go to the weight room at the hotel near flatwoods and at the fire station you should be able to get enough lead to make a ton of bullets.  As for the pistols, if your on xbox I can make you a few different ones if you want to try them.
---
Yes  dropping now 
---
Not sure if mods keep deleting new posts, but I can't see anything after the comment following mine, "that's painful"
---
I crafted a lvl 5 pump shotgun maxed for a new player x i was helping. Then a lvl 2 appeared and was hanging around but picked up the shotgun bag i left on the ground for new player x. I politely msg lvl 2 to drop the shotgun and they did. New player x got it. No harm. No pvp. **But** 
---
**TLDR a mic sure would have been better if only we were using them.**  
---
I would have taken it too, dropped bag means its free game, baby!
---
Starting at what health %?   Cause I know it ain’t 100......
---
I made martini glasses out of them for my bar the titty twister
---
Are you complaining?
---
Well I mean does it really matter? Just to be able to run around as a ghoul would be cool to me. It doesn't have to fit in exactly. I mean you can already change your character at any time in the game...
---
Really? I do think it does lemme check
---
Fair enough!
---
do all the research you can.   I can’t seem to find a solid percentage chart/ any numbers to solidify  my switch from tse to Bloodied explosive....
---
What did they do? I wanted to try a stealth build with stealth boys 
---
Yeah, when I joined their party to hear them out, that's what they said. Yelled multiple obscenities at me, and told me to give it back. But I hardly took anything worth while. I thought it was pretty comical tbh. 
---
\*nod\*  
---
Agree, have some notes on the Flamer...  
---
WAY WAY to costly for their fuel
---
I keep hearing about how it's broken, but I don't understand. Mine works just fine. Power to the door, power to the keypad, and a pressure plate wired up to open momentarily to be able to leave the camp. Am I missing something? 
---
It's almost as if it's impossible for developers especially AAA companies from publishing finished products that do not have major bugs instead of a early access standard of a game. 
---
There's a buildable area near the church and I'm on the edge of it
---
I agree to increase the cap limit. But to make things interesting, you die, you loose all the caps! Just like Dark Souls.
---
No it does not i take every bag thats on the ground, they die youre loot then
---
Do you have to ask?   
---
If I see someone die that's been killing like at White Springs and dies, I'll watch their stuff so scabs don't come and get it, they usually run back within a minute or so and give them a thumbs up.   
---
People standing by a bag usually means they're watching it for a friend. I'm going to assume here that you're way higher level than them also since you killed them 2-3 times... if you had weapons that powerful to do that, you couldn't farm junk in 5 minutes to get what you needed???   
---
Now IF they don't come back which happens and they aren't even on the map... fair game! lol
---
Yeh I built a camp on a mountain side all I gotta do I remove a block fall inside place it back and no one can get to me so awesome 
---
I mean it's kind of a dick move to take somones stuff, unless they were waving you over to help yourself,  the  proper etiquette when it's not your bag it's not to touch it. Esp if people are standing over it
---
The crossbow bolts in the world aren't the ammo variants...  
---
Annoying but doesn't appear to be a bug.
---
I have a really basic method that requires no real effort in manipulating the stock game.  My camp is set up as a 3x6 floor plan with middle spaces left as bare ground.  So long as it's not rocks, you can place a bunch of small plants like corn, tato and carrots.
---
[Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/Heyg8Nk)
---
Works fine for me. If you want it to be momentary only run your wire to the box on the inside, not to the other point somewhere else (I never see it, it’s always through the wall). 
---
The biggest problem I have with them is the color is backwards. I don’t want a white wall on the outside of my red brick house. 
---
 The Western Revolver is what you want. Mine hits at 98 now and is just perfect.
---
Yea my tse gause with all rifle perks, and 2.5 sneak multiply is aweson the base damage is 425
---
I'm really hoping they add somethings for gardening in the future, this is just a camp trick to get the same effect in the meantime. They're adding a bunch of camp stuff down the road according to the last Inside the Vault, so hopefully that includes planters.
---
Commie bastard
---
I'll add to my other comment here... if they were being a$$hats about it yelling obscenities without asking like a descent person like "Hey, we were watching that stuff could we have it back for our friend?" then screw them... 
---
Needs wings. 
---
But you can't change them to not need food and water and tp be healed by radiation.
---
So you made her ugly. Congrats.
---
All i do is farm for better legendaries
---
You get kicked to caution/danger alot easier now so you can't chain sneak attacks in rapid succession.
---
But you can't change to not need food and water, and to be healed by radiation.
---
LOL. I run through all my guns when I start playing. I decide which ones need more ammo, and make some. 
---
 You might be overthinking this. ;)
---
I've just got a "stock" Gauss with a silencer. Combined with chameleon armor and I can usually drop at least half of a crowd before I stop getting my sneak bonus. 
---
Oh just sucks. Do you need stealth gear to be successful?
---
So you buy a car that is advertised to have the best features but when you get the car the basic features don't even work as intended. From your post it seems like you would consider the company in question here to have delivered satisfactorily. Hopefully i am wrong. 
---
Agreed, I wouldn't want people taking my stuff and one time getting killed by a dozen ghouls a level 120 watched my stuff... thought it was pretty cool so I started doing the same. 
---
I mean, there were two of them and they were Lvl 61 and Lvl 91 and I am Lvl 106. But typically, if I kill someone duirng PvP, I guard their loot for them cause I don't really engage in PvP unless someone's wanted or they actively want to engage in it. Idk, this time (I guess out of boredom and the fact there were no consequences) I just decided to pick up some of the better loot. And I honestly hardly took anything, it was less than 25 adhesive, some aluminum, and like 2 bulk gears. 
---
I have 2 left. Revives and kills.
---
I'd say I've revived 10ish ppl and killed.....3....maybe.
---
Pvp sucks and I'd never buy a game by bethesda to pvp.
---
I've shelved the game too, fully knowing i could recruit someone to hammer it out fast. But that's just me personally more than how pvp sucks in this game.
---
The way I'd get the trophy is griefing noobs with supply drops if i were to do it legit.
---
Really? I have never found bolts otherwise though unless i'm mistaken. Definitely get waaaay too many of them in ammo boxes though.   
---
The explosive is coming back though I believe? They are just working to not make them act/look identical to ballistic weapons with it.  
---
Honestly if you could suggest they rebalance the legendary traits too that would be great. Some drops are utter crap, +40% bashing damage???? Primaries like Nocturnal or mutants (as well as some of the two shot nerf reverted) could use buffs too. Everyone runs the exact same builds.  
---
Also can they FIX DUPING AS THE PREVIOUS PATCH BROUGHT IT BACK. 
---
Green thumb perk head to Silva and Billings Homesteads pick corn and razograin to sell at robot vendors to collect 1500 caps per day.
---
Server hop to find blast zones and Scorched earth event.
---
Farm Watoga robot legendarys.
---
Amazon Ng way to make your camp griefer proof just build it out of concrete floors and make it so one can be stored and replaced after you go inside.
---
I will try post a video of my camp I love it bit of a trap to lure players when I'm wanted up the top and me just chilling in my concrete cave 😀
---
I've had it happen to me, it's not cool. I leave people's shit alone , unless no one has been by the bag, in a few mins or no ones around.....but maybe I'm in the minority.
---
Yeah, lol I joined the party and just said, "Hello?" And immediately got called all the names in the book. If they had just been like, "Hey man, we were just guarding that stuff for our friend, could we have it back?" I would've given it back. Hell, if they message me again, I wouldn't mind giving some of it back and helping their friend out if they're a lower level. But I guess them being pricks about it kind of turned me off to that idea. 
---
Hahaha just do it if thats the question.
---
I solo the queen dude. When i first saw her i never tought i could but with bloodied u can
---
I am on Xbox yes but I'll go at this myself. Thanks for the offer though!
---
I'd like to ask a question though. What is it about the 10mm that makes it good? Is it the armor penetration and low VATS cost? Or am I missing something? It just feels weird that it's somehow really good but does so little damage compared to the other pistols. 
---
Do you know whether you can safely move the structure? For example you build this at your Camp, move your camp to a new location, could you still safely place this elaborate structure considering it’s kind of glitched?
---
Reason I’m asking is because I’m building kind of a windmill with gardens/farms on balconies, but it’s not in an ideal location. I’ve had some issues with moving basic builds around the map, forcing me to rebuild the entire thing because it just kept saying I had floating things here and there.
---
What’s your gamer tag?
---
What are the stats like?
---
I'm down, but I only communicate through horn honks and circus music.
---
I made a post the other day about a master list of plans. Since then, I have spend a LOT of time going from vendor to vendor and server hoping. I have yet to see those plans at any vendor in the game. 
---
The "as complete as I can get it right now" list should be available some time this weekend. 
---
I'm not a pistol user myself, but from what I've seen it's the low vats cost, the armor pen, and the quick firing.  If you have a lot of bullets you can just spray at higher health enemies and do pretty decent damage.
---
Super Duper takes time to trigger the announce, which screws that up. 
---
Interesting. From my own perspective I never have issues with power cores but I hope you can make a change. Good luck with your quest of spreading the good word.
---
&gt; You have no clue what you're talking about. Do you have any idea how  much profit EA for example has lost from those "meaningless threats" to  never buy another one of their games? 
---

---
&gt; Do you have any idea what damage Mass Effect Andromeda has done to their reputation?  
---
Very little because the damage was done far earlier.  The major talking points I've seen about Anthem isn't that it was made by BioWare so we have to be wary. It is how it is extremely similar to Destiny. In fact during the beta I saw a joke about how to make it less like destiny they make it so out in the field you are 3rd person but at the hub world you are first person. Because Destiny is the opposite with out on missions you are first person and hub world you are 3rd person. 
---
&gt; People like you like to pretend and push the narrative that we are powerless. 
---
Never said powerless only that circle jerking is a habit of people and they drastically over estimate the amount of people that agree with them. Case in point it was in the news recently that a sporting goods store owner declared they would no longer sell Nike brand gear anymore. Because they signed Colin  kaepernick to an advertising deal has had to close down due to lack of sales.   Despite the no lack of people who will continue to complain about Colin didn't translate into sales to support someone taking a stand against it. And on the flip side no one was actually boycotting him at all. They just wanted something he didn't offer so they went to another store. 
---
It isn't that we are powerless it is just people assume that other people automatically think like they do. 
---
Farming legendaries got really boring. 
---
Is it worth it in Watoga? Or is do they drop low level items?
---
Launching 
---
I got it by taking out wanted players before the duping exploded and everyone had a TSE. Back then I found a stock Gauss very useful against players in PA when paired with Tank Killer. The Radium Rifle was also kinda rough on others because of the rad damage. 
---
This is how boring this game has become? The only fun is spending hours upon hours just to make your character look older? 
---
Don't take others junk would u want someone to do that to u
---
Not sure. My chest piece was chameleon with better sneak and i had escape artist. Prepatch it was good enough but i didn't feel like getting 3* sneak to test further.
---
Lack of stealth still felt way stronger than other gun builds besides bloodied

Well, red is traditional for barns.  As a painter and lover of paint lore and pigments, the red oxide pigment was very common and very cheap in 17th-19th century America, and that tradition has stayed with us.  (check out Mummy pigment if you're interested in how weird the world of paint can get)  Blue, green and yellow pigments are typically the second most expensive colors with purple being the top of the heap, so it's funny that you should use those as examples.  I personally wouldn't mind brown, sap green, wedgewood blue and greyed bare wood options.  Those seem realistic and would offer some variety.

Charleston capital building 
---
It was one of the mods. Messaged them a few hours ago and they just ignored it. 
---
I guess one of them fell into thw whiny little shit category as well. Im not that concerned about it honestly but thanks for the heads up.
---
What new patch?
---
I suppose that'd be logical at least. I'm more or a big chunky damage kind of a player which is why I enjoy sneak builds. Pistols just felt better to play with than rifles because of the faster fire rate. Just unfortunate that it's really hard on my low bullet count. Still very much a newbie with the game. Took me long enough to figure out I could track materials I needed too..
---
No problems here. XboX1 first Gen. Platform issue on your end ? Or a setting maybe?
---
I would imagine there will be a skin of a ghoul, none of the benefits just the apperance perhaps? It could be cool. You talk about game breaking yet after a scorch beast attack you arent infected with the scorch plague or in any way can be infected. I would hope atleast looking like a ghoul was possible cause it couls give something more for those who roleplay in the game
---
if I leave stuff it will be at overseers camp
---
Is there a difference between the western and the general .44 revolver? Seems like the general .44 is easier to come by and scrap for mod plans.
---
isnt there some sort of an anti duper fix or something? thought that was today?
---
I will take all the bacon and eggs you have at a fair price.  Wait, I fear what you heard was I'll take a lot of bacon and eggs.......
---
Man, people just keep wanting to make this game easier and more trivial.
---
What i wish is that the relevant notes/holotapes are deleted/disappear after the mission is completed. Anyone else?
---
It was server side. No download required. OP was this post a lie?
---
If ammo is the only thing holding you back I would reccomend saving up some caps and buying a stockpile of bullets.  10mm is usually pretty cheap and you can usually get at least a 2-3/1 bullet to cap ratio.
---
Oh okay that makes sense. I thought it was a bug that it never updated my level
---
Patch?
---
nope, i had a long ass download and now i cant play. ive tried repairing, ive gone into my ini and checked my resolution, idk what else to try. i crash before my screen turns black completely
---
Early on in the game, probably still in November, I saw a player with the name XmysteriousStrangerX that was actually decked out in a suit and fedora with a revolver.  I had to give them a thumbs up.
---
and I may screech and moan a lot
---
is that the top of seneca mountain?
---
Yeah the damage was done far earlier and Battlefront II and Mass Effect Andromeda compounded it massively.
---
Putting up some figure about "revenue" doesn't tell you anything about how much they have lost. And Anthem has nothing to do with it and isn't even a factor in anything so far. You're just throwing up strawman after strawman left and right. Lost sales can't be quantified. How much profit would they have made if they hadn't done x, y and z? That 5.1 could be 25.1. You don't have any idea how "other people think". And don't include yourself in "we". You're not "we". It's very clear what side you stand on.
---
Ah ok well it keeps things interesting I guess 
---
PvP in this game is trash, if both players are fighting each other it’s just not fun, but if they work together to take down a high level beast then it’s fun, besides most of the time it’s who ever shoots second wins from what I’ve seen
---
Absolutely my favorite too.
---
It was one of the mods. Messaged them a few hours ago and they just ignored me. 
---
Yep! Saw it in the distance and decided I needed to try and get up there. The view was very worth the 10 mins of jumping.
---
The difficulty level of these events IS trivial man.
---
Hell, I’ll take heroic versions of these events in a heartbeat. Where messing up means getting overwhelmed and swarmed and killed. I would *love* more challenges in the actual gameplay.
---
Instead we have “do this simple, boring event 100 times” and *hope* you get something meaningful once.
---
yea my base is up there i thought i recognized the view
---
I've never been able to get those "inside" stairs to place. What's the trick?
---
It's more or less fine, I find just enough materials over the world to get by. But it has me always on edge of wanting to conserve since I never know when I get some annoying tough enemies in front of me.
---
My main issue with the 10mm is that it takes ages killing packs of low level enemies if they find me or in an event. Even after the armor penetration mod the protectron enemies at level 5 take like 10+ bullets to kill. Really annoying.
---
I was lucky today found a glowing mothman and then got chased by a kid killing me with his tse and took like 900 of my caps 
---
 Yes indeed. I do believe it hits harder than any other for starters. With the best receiver it also does enhanced hip shots as well as max damage and with the Long Barrel and a Reflex sight I head shot all kinds of trash. 
---
BioWare didn't make BattleFront 2.
---
The figures was to show how much the made. Even with the protests they are still making billions.  Literally billions.
---
Anthem is related to Bioware.

I actually made a post about that problem a little while ago. That's been fixed with the new patch. Nuke loot now drops instantly in the last few zones I've been in. Though for me, Hardened Mass is the most common, with the fluids being the least. Basically anything living that you kill inside the zone has a good chance of dropping one of the three.
---
Your and your friends nukes are always fun  **AJDx619** , thanks:)

But on this team you / we always bring here down, and fast :D

I'll add you then
---
Amazing.  Some people are just the best.

No, I buy a $60 car that is advertised as a $60 car, and am satisfied. Where’s the theme of this subreddit is “I broke my $60 car by loading 12,000 rifles into it, what are the names of the development team so I can blame them personally and complain forever.”
---
I put $60 in front of each example because it a game, a video toy for fun, not transportation we need to get around for life.
---
Thank you for this. Made my night 
---
Both of these

Best vendorbot Wallace has plans, 1800caps or less with perks, also free red pills.

I hate that keys cannot be dropped, it’s a stupid rule and I want to drop them too.
---
I just googled a bit and looks like the western is an exact copy of the .44 in every way except it hits for 5 more damage and is much harder to find. I guess I'll stick to a regular .44 to start with at least!
---
Game is more stable than ever.

That is pretty impressive in fact!

" My other Melee Weapon is a 3\*"

Wow that really looks inviting, great job.

You cannot place it at a new camp.  You'll have to rebuild it from scratch.
---
 That would be nice.

Today was actually the first disconnect I've had in a few weeks. lul
---
Lol
---
That particular mod cannot be learned from scrapping.  Confirmed via the datafile.
---
Cool, dude. It's worth it in my opinion. Haha
---
Maybe save this somewhere in case you need the settings again or something(?)
---
You have mods? I read they were a problem after update #5.
---
I mean... you already can... cooking
---
I was wrong, i starts under 90%hp
---
You really can't choose not to. The only other way is to do events and not pick up loot. Where is the fun in a shooter looter online MMO without looting. The 200 cap isn't even that bad if you can do like in ALL THE OTHER FALLOUT 3D games and trade items back and forth. Even in the other games where there were tons of caps at vendors I often sold stuff at whatever the vendor had because I had more loot than they had caps. In 76 it is just taken to an idiotic extreme. Like I KNOW you have 5k caps I just gave it to you!!! 
---
Remember if they do this, prices for everything on the bazaar and marketplace will increase since the caps a player can earn per day will go up.
---
Aw this is a good idea for the front door. Dont care if I dont have doors to my outdoor areas of the house but a proper framed front door is prefered. Thanks for this tip.
---
Try starting with one base then stairs. Attach entire house to that. I have a flat roof to use like a deck. A second door to a deck leads to the roof stairs. I attach several machine guns decks on the outside. Moving them if I need to.  Then I have a generator base with all my generators. 
---
When I move first I drop a collector and power right next to it. Then water purifier next to that. Attach wires and drop house so turrets can cover them. Keep each module on one base. That allows it to fit almost anywhere. Depending on terrain I May drop a couple of turrets on rocks or something if needed. But prefer to keep them on upper decks.
---
And if you need to lock it just replace the door panel with a wall and use build menu to switch back when you need in. Seems mole rats can pick locks.
---
You're the only one talking about Bioware. I'm not talking about acquisitions and subsidiaries, I'm talking about parent companies. You see for a long time people may be fooled by the passing of the buck, like what is happening with Bethesda Austin right now with Fallout 76, but we should look more to the parent company like EA, or Zenimax, etc. as the parties responsible, and the parties that if one does decide to boycott is the target, rather than some studio or subsidiary. Now EA makes a lot of money from the Fifa game, most of its profits actually. Though there is a rising movement within even that community against the monetization of it.
---
Now here are some more headlines.
---
"EA makes $186m Q3 loss despite rising digital revenue"
---
"For the year ending March 31, *2018*, *EA* expects to earn $5.1 billion in *revenue*, and $1.015 billion in net in *profit*." 
---
So actually about a billion profit.
---
Where's the Medicine Stick Gang at?
---
They need to be placed on a foundation section, not just a regular floor section.  You can even stack them but you need to first build a stack of vertical square poles, then attach a stair section to it, then remove one pole and replace it with another stair section. A little trial and error and you'll see how it works. The square pole is listed with the "Stairs" objects.
---
You want to be a ghoul so you can give people radworms?
---
hahaha...just kidding.  Everyone already has them.
---
Hope Jill left that guy that hit her in the face at her 60th birthday party. 
---
If youre crafting in a workshop...build a stash box.
---
If youre at your camp. you have no excuse.
---
run to your box check your ammo then craft accordingly.
---
I spend 3-4K rounds per SBQ fight. when i need to grind once i have enough gunpowder, steel and lead it takes two seconds to see what ammo you need.
---
Also most things you kill drop ammo.
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Where'd you get the shocks?
---
THE END WAS HERE
---
This is awesome!
---
Inside the enclave bunker under whitesprings. At the Amory vendor. Paid about 500 or so each. 1st found bout 6 hours in and the 2nd took the rest. I swear I wanted to throw the fucking xbox! 
---
They should make this a feature honestly haha! Toggleable of course, but still it would be cool if because of the radiation you experience in the game you aged at an accelerated rate and your character visually got older or grew facial hair. 
---
For leveling this will work but eventually you're going to have to decide. You can either be a Jack of all trades or a master of one. Most melee builds carry a gun but you're losing valuable resources in endurance just to gain perception. Tse are no where near as valuable as they once were. It's better just to blitz unless you cannot reach your target, meaning scorchbeasts. In their case just run to a clearing and dodge while shooting until they land and use what you were build for.
---
Sorry, I wasn't getting notifications of your reply's. Station. Just walked to Charleston to meet someone, but heading back
---
I found the plans being sold by Vendor Bot Phoenix though this was a while back.
---
If folk's are standing over the loot bag it's more than a little obvious why.  Maybe they handled their response badly, but yeah that was a total dick move.
---
Awesome feedback thank you. What about any changes if it were a pvp build? 
---
Defend on cap gives you some goodies. Also free fast travel. 
---
 You should have the Sumerset gun at low level. Its a nice .44 with AP on top.
---
buts it’s only been within the last week that i noticed this, prior to that, there’d be structures multiple extractors and water purifiers at every single one, no literally nothing...
---
I have it at level 5 yes. Just need to get more .44s for the mods!
---
I regularly blow up cars in this game. There are 3 within sniping distance of my front porch just so I can blow them up at login.
---
I don't have a VATS built character, but I do have a stealth sniper and understand what a perk intensive build is like.  I think BGS designed these builds to use conventional armor as a sort of "archer/wizard" archetype.  Softer than a heavy armor character, but capable of higher DPS.  Conventional armor might actually be an advantage for you, as legendary effects can significantly boost your stats, including PER and AG in the upper 30 range if you run with a full set of unyielding armor and AG/PER minor effects, plus food and drink bonuses.  Add in a legendary weapon with vats crit damage boost or -33% cost and you're cooking with serious gas.
---
Honestly, I think VATS builds are intended to function like stealth builds, requiring a lot of perk investment for potentially massive DPS.  I think the fusion core drain is an intended penalty so as to balance the strengths of the character with inherent weaknesses.
---
If you dump the power armor, your issues are solved.  Potentially investing in very high AG/PER, sneak attack damage boosts and liberally using stealth boys or chameleon armor....you're going to have a world beater of a character.
---
Here's my suggestions if you're not willing to forego the convenience of power armor for conventional armor (which could be a potentially large bonus with an increase to your AG and PER scores netting you more AP and better VATS accuracy at a slight defensive hit)
---
* Claim workshops at power plants to hook up a fusion generator that will periodically produce fully charged cores.  You'll have to babysit to workshop to some degree, but if you want cores, time is the surcharge.
---
* Invest in Batteries Included and Power User perks (INT tree).  90% reduced weight of fusion cores from 3 ranks of Batteries Included and twice the charge from a core with three ranks of Power User.  My power armor slugger melee has one rank of Power User and I dump extra cores that are less than 80% charge.  I sprint a lot for the power attack damage, too.
---
* Learn where PA spawns and where the fusion generators are on the map.  Lootgen frames always have a core on them, and it seems like generators have a core about 33% of the time.  You can potentially get 3-5 cores at Watoga alone, with the two PA frames, the generator in the transit station and the one in AMS HQ.  There might be a PA frame in AMS, as well as a couple robobrains.  Sentry bots and robobrains will also drop cores of random quality every time, sometimes two.  Server hop at 98 NAR, kill the sentry bot every time, and you'll have tons of cores.  Robco Research, Garrahan HQ, Hornwright HQ, and Sugar Grove are quality spots for at least a couple robobrains and possibly a sentry bot each.
---
It's something like 20-21 hours, in my experience.
---
Well at least you got what you wanted.
---
Haha thought you looked familiar. That’s awesome , we enjoy dropping with you too. We’re always down so when we do we’ll keep posting add us on live. Hopefully they update the Queen loot table 
---
Never noticed. My Charisma is 0 so I don’t even bother with vendors. 
---
Sometimes the model kinda pops into the real world ive had it happen mostly with energy weapons
---
Probably just more people who havr started recently and want to get plans for themselves. Can get some pretty rare plans from taking workbenches, hell I've done it myself.
---
 Should be lots around I scrap em' still for steel. ;)
---
I find very few of them unfortunately!
---
I've seen it once or twice, I'm just wondering how it got into the chest? lol maybe it was just a coincidence and a second one spawned.
---
It happens same reasom why diseased enemies carries legendaries it just happens 
---
That already exists. Mole rat boosts endurance level by 2 for a period of time. Fog crawler meat boosts your damage in water or foggy conditions. Glowing meat gives a 10%bonus to melee damage. 
---
Vendors caps reset to 200 20h after your first interaction with a vendor of that faction. All vendors of a faction share a cap pool. The factions are Responders, Raiders, BoS, Watoga, Enclave, and Graham/Harpers Ferry
---
Anti Armor xxxx weapon, all rise (at least 2), incisior, cola nut, a ton of Nuka quantum, grenades just all of the grenades, grenader perk from perception, t51b with reactive plates, optimized bracers, one kinetic shock and the other optimized, a TSE dragon, tweek your build for crits, learn to play in third person so you can not get sneak attacked, adamantium skeleton, suppressor in charisma. There's a bunch of things you'll need to do to tweek it to your style but trust me the template works very well in pvp.
---
I just cap workshops for random cosmetic plans. 
---
Free travel/bait for PVP
---
Hello! I'm back. Excuse me but I don't really know what you mean by "non-starter." Never heard that expression before. xD
---
I think you mean it doesn't start?
---
There is another user in this post who also uses 3 monitors and he/she said that turning off the other monitors and setting the game to fullscreen mode made a big difference already.
---
I really recommend you somehow set it to fullscreen even without turning off the other monitors.
---
You may not be able to hover over with your mouse anymore that easily but technically, to keep it simple but a bit wrong as I've told them already; If you set it to fullscreen mode, most of the strength goes to the 3D application. Background stuff isn't bothered with that much, that's why you will see a huge performance/hardware usage increase.
---
Also, I've personally had issues in Borderless or Windowed where I would get 30-40 fps everywhere. xD
---
Let me know what's up. :)
---
Thank you Riley216! I hope that's your IGN, that was quick and painless.
---
I did not know this.
---
Yeah, hard to say for sure if it was a bug or a coincidence or working properly, but I know I'm gonna check that chest every time now, I've been passing it up because it never had anything good.
---
 OK. They are fairly common and the plan is at Responder vendors last time I looked.
---
Very nice! Thank-you for the great tutorial!
---
Agree, perk card sets would be great. I'd even pay money for these like rune pages in LoL.
---
Yeah, I was referring to the color being backwards, I can get the door to work, but I hate to see the colors like that.
---
Oh, that's great! If you ever decide to give it a try in fullscreen mode, I can assure you that you will notice and even bigger difference. You're just sacrificing the functionality of being able to easily hover over with your mouse.
---
But Fullscreen -&gt; Most strength to 3D application without caring much for background stuff.
---
Borderless/Windowed -&gt; Background stuff still very active
---
This is somewhat wrongly explained by me now but it's kinda what's going on.
---
Let me know if you give it a try!
---
There's also a visual bug that will show the wrong amount. You can try selling even if it shows a low value, they might actually have more than is displayed.
---
Haha, you're welcome.
---
You know, the new one is less dark.
---
But if you don't like it, you could disable FakeHDR or HDR, whatever it's called, in the settings. That's probably what's darkening the screen too much.
---
I've included EyeAdapation which should prevent the screen from going too dark but then again we have different monitors probably and it's always a bit hard to set up a good thing that's nice for everyone.
---
Nice! I think I've replied already but I was on mobile, on Chrome, and I think it's a bit buggy.
---
Anyway, it's pretty good. Glad you're seeing such a big difference. :)
---
Its not the game. Its your pc. 
---
I had guessed you were going from one vendor to another of the same faction over and over, thus seeing the same cap totals. Figured it whould help you to know the basics of how vendors work. Know that there will almost always be more to sell then vendors to sell it too.
---
Dude what an elegant solution! Yes please BGS
---
Griefing is any action with no objective benefit where the only potential outcome is to cause frustration, annoyance, or anger.
---
If someone wants to take a publicly owned workshop, whatever thats part of the game.  The fact that they left the workshop and never returned shows they had no interest in actually taking it and the fact that OP wasnt trying to stop them shows they had no need to attack OP as they could take the workshop without resistance.
---
The only reason to PvP at a workshop is to take it from the owner.  
---
Any good Schwag?
---
the dumpster fire meme got old in december, not sure why the parrots are still mimicking it this late into the cycle. Also, don't you have anthem or something to hop on to? the hate train is still at the station atm, you can still make it
---
Haha
---
As I've said. No problem. I misread and didn't understand cus inglish.
---
Honestly, I just think that it's fine. The presets work; they just give you options to increase the render distance if you want that, but of course you'll lose some performance here and there.
---
Some people don't really care much for framerate and just want the visuals; nothing wrong with that. :)
---
But if you wanna make it run decently and maybe sacrifice such a tiny bit you barely will even notice, I reaaally recommend you just do what I wrote here.
---
And btw, I don't think asking questions is negative. Atleast you got a reply from someone as well. xD
---
I'll give it a try at some point but the game is smooth enough now that I doubt the increased performance will be worth the loss of functionality. Appreciate it though.
---
Ok. I know several people have issues getting it to work properly when they first get them because there’s two attachment points, one of which keeps the door open when powered (making it useless when a power line is attached). 
---
Would be nice if we could get a larger pressure plate that snaps onto it too instead of the horrible appearance of the regular one. 
---
Probably nukesdragons.com
---
If you do decide to go melee only, I created a modified version of Rifle Gaming’s melee build that can output over 10,000 damage and can have perk cards swapped for a shotgun class.
---
Gee, man. That sucks.
---
At this point I don't really know what you could do then.
---
I would say they have set something up a bit wrong for 21:9 users but that's just speculation on my part. Not blaming them but I doubt they really have 21:9 monitors to test stuff on as well and I don't really have the knowledge/possibilites/tools to see what they did.
---
If you find a way of making this work, please let us know here.
---
Alternatively, you could send Bethesda more than a couple requests until you speak with an actual person and not a bot that keeps linking you the same thing.
---
"Build the wall around my house, I hate everybody!"
---
Nice that you got both.  I've been hopping for about 3 hours for my second one, I got my first in about 20 mins of hopping lol.
---
I don’t know how y’all do these low health builds. Under 50% health my ocd kicks in and I’m
---
Stimming 
---
I am really really impressed :D like thats honestly pretty awesome and you kept to the disfigurement of the scars too and even made them age! brilliant, i thought about doing it for my first character and i probably wouldn't bother with a second (cause plans aren't shared between them sadly) but maybe one day i might :D pretty cool still.
---
Let's just hope a scortch beast doesn't try mating with it. 
---
Bud I don't know what carrier field you are in. For what it is worth, if you are in an IT field I might be able to hook you up 
---
Remember: Homies help homies, always.
---
Damn. I think you should stay at ease anyway because, again, I don't think there's anything wrong on your end. 
---
Excuse me but there have been lots of users recently. Weren't you on 21:9? Or 1440?  
---
Did you uncap your framerate?  
---
I have noticed that I crash like this in Overwatch if I don't have Vsync for 144hz enabled.  
---
There can still be a couple more possibilites but if you can give me a bit more information, maybe we can fix this.
---
Raiders steal things.  The murder, destruction, etc all revolves around the stealing.  There is nothing to be gained from destroying someone's CAMP.  Anyone doing this is just being an asshole.
---
Claiming the public workshop from OP would be roleplaying as a raider and they literally stopped stealing the workshop to do the griefing.
---
I'm just using the switch with the keypad for now, with can you can type the code or just use the switch. And yeah, the reason I don't use the plates is because I don't like the size, larger ones would be nice.
---
Also, fix the alien blaster. Right now it does close to 0 damage. It also doesn't seem to work in vats and isn't compatible with Concentrated Fire. I mean, it's literally broken, not just underpowered.
---
Killed a cave cricket in 3 shots with my level 40 combat shotgun. It only has a damage of 110.
---
Haha, alright. Sure thing. I understand completely. It's more of a suggestion than anything. If you're happy with it, no point in nuking the functionality.
---
I'm sad to have learned this. I think it's so well designed.
---
I barely even carry stims. I will only carry food, water, and 3 radaways (diluted, regular, or mixed diluted/regular) for my aids. I keep every single other aid item (which I have a lot of) in my stash box.
---
Thanks so much!
---
I'm trying my damndest to get into it. I've been working with cars as a service manager for the past 6 years. Started to not like it about 3 years ago..but I'm good at it and the jobs are there..but I been in school for a computer science degree for 2 years now. I spent the last few days applying for any low level help desk job I can find just to get some kind of experience before I'm do e with school.
---
I gotta ask cause i haven't looked much but how did you update the appearance anyway?.
---
Everyone would protest Bethesda’s 💩development.
---
Under the start menu there's an option for "change appearance"
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
here you go
---
Awesome thanks man! :D, also im curious your character there is she a Brotherhood of Steel member by chance?.
---
You specifically mentioned ME:A which is a BioWare game made by a branch company that previously worked on DLC content to free up work time at main branch for other projects.
---
Do you have any proof to support the statement that it was all EA's fault the Andromeda got a luke warm review?
---
I also Google f76 screws. Usually find a list of what has screws and good farming location.
---
I just got the vampire outfit, looks pretty nice with the black cowboy hat...
---
Initially focus on the scorched mobs that the scorchbeast spawns.  Once you kill the mob, the scorchbeast will land (if it has room).  If there's a lot of trees around, try to fight on a flat area like a road or field to encourage it to land near you.  I read about this around Christmas on Reddit and it's prevented about 90% of those flying sonic blast spam fights where the damn critter will never land and I'm just eating stimpaks like candy while lightly popping away at it's health with a 2-shot backup revolver in VATS.  If you're a melee character, sprint at it with an attack at the end, as it's functionally the same as a power attack and the beast doesn't have time to do it's own attack that will block it, usually.  I use this tactic all the time when engaging super mutants or scorched.  I run straight into the heaviest one, usually drop it with 1-2 hits, get my adrenaline perk started and just mow through the rest.
---
It's a great strategy and perk loadout for a melee in a Scorched Earth event.  While the queen is flying around I mow through the trash mobs with an instigating super sledge so the heavy gunners and riflemen can focus all attention on peppering the flying queen without much disturbance.  Once she lands I press the 4 hotkey to swap to my furious pickaxe with a sharp bladed mod, 8 hotkey to dose myself up with Fury and 9 hotkey (PC player) to eat a fresh glowing steak for another +10% melee damage, sprint into her and just go full attack on her face until she flies off or dies.  I always hang on to a couple addictols in case mainlining Fury has a lasting effect.  I also try to save melee-related Grognak magazines for Scorched Earth runs.
---
You confused chill with shill, but it is understandable as the spelling is similar 
---
It seems like the scars got lighter with age. Good job
---
I love it 
---
WHAT ARE THEY SELLIN??!!
---
Are you going to give her middle-aged spread, osteoporosis and a hunch-back? 
---
How do you get plans for calibrated shocks for ultracite?
---
Do it solo. There is less robots. At your lvl I'd bring 40 stimpacks. Also have all 3 hacker perks so you can turn turrets off.
---
Unless it has a junk extractor I usually only build defenses and thats it. I'm there for plans and the defense quests.
---
got mine from queen. around a 0.5 percent drop
---
I waited until I had a full set of troubleshooter armor before doing a run. I barely take any damage from the robots or turrets so it makes it easier to focus on the task at hand and not having to worry about HP management 
---
I got tired of the non-stop bitching and salt. Stuff takes time to fix. Devs screw up sometimes. And a lot of the complaints were just reiterated in other posts over and over and over again as if nothing was moderated. I was sick of seeing the same repetitive bullshit at the top of my feed every single day. It was making me sick of the game as well - I haven't played in a few months now. I'm hoping things chill out after a while and the game is still there whenever I decide to come back, but at this point I have little motivation to play at all.
---
If you are having ammo issues use ammo smith, super duper, and scrapper. I can easily get 300 steel in about 15 minutes, same with lead and gunpowder is super ease to get / craft. 
---
Because it is a multiplayer game with player interation.
---
Oh yeah. The assaultrons alone fuck up anything that comes by. For some reason some lvl 60 super mutants spawn from time to time and they’re dead within a minute or 2
---
I have a max level perfect storm and it's lovely. I really want to find a furious 10mm smg. I love the 10mm smg. They're so light and crafting the ammo isn't too annoying (looking at you .45 ammo) my perfect storm modded to my liking is only 6.3 pounds. My furious handmade is... More to say the least
---
I see you glitched time. Only Bethesda.
---
Yeah reading a lot of these comments I’m finding designated spots the community has picked to leave loot. This is probably the best community I’ve ever been apart of. I’m dissapointed in myself that I blindly hated this game for so long. It’s the most fun I’ve had in a long time with a video game.
---
Tank killer is necessary unless you enjoy doing minimal damage
---
I’ve been hopping for a week now and still haven’t encountered the jet pack. That’s what I’m looking for to finish up my build. Have 2xCS, stealth boy core, targeting HUD and red lamp for helmet. 
---
That's fine otherwise but I don't even have access to two of those cards yet! That's why I asked about pistols for leveling specifically.
---
I only do it if a daily challenge requires me to. Idc who takes it over. If they want it, they can have it 
---
I feel like tenderizer doesn't give a noticeable difference
---
oh I know some how via either dumb luck or some strange cosmic interventions I have ended up with 3 Gatling Laser plans 2 Gauss Rifles and 3 Handmade Rifles.
---
What system are you on?
---
Chose option 3 - had a friend join my game and do the deed. Never gonna try unlocking a government drop again. 
---
PC
---
Well when I was leveling my character I found it very valuable to use melee weapons as well to offset ammo consumption. As with all fallout games.
---
I'll give it a try next time I'm gonna go to a nuke site. That's always the worst, as far as frame rate goes and at that point I'm not paying attention to anything but fallout so I'm not missing anything 😄
---
You don't want her breaking stuff.
---
She is
---
Thought so the white aged hair really matches the theme of BoS.
---
Nice. I haven't gone to any nuked places yet. I can see why it would drop so hard though considering there's quite a bit going on and the High/Ultra preset are as I've said pretty overkill. xD
---
We have a trade system. If it's on the ground, it's fair game.
---
Lincoln Logs ftw!
---
Modus?
---
Damn, PS4 here. I would have sold it cheap. I'm camped near WS and when I'm doing a caps run I snag the good mods so player like OP don't have to server hop endlessly, not in it for the profit. Good luck, hope you get it soon.
---
 are you on ps4? I'd be down to team up and help you deck your C.A.M.P out, quest etc
---
Ooooh yeah. Last time I went into one, about a week ago, it was slow enough at some points that it was basically a slideshow. Turning off my two extra monitors helped at that point but not enough to be smooth. Can't wait to test it out now!
---
Look for someone willing to let you tag along on your platform that'll let you launch it. I'm sure there's enough people willing to do that especially given the lack of anything to do (level 155 here).
---
I'm using a level 10 Somerset special on my 17 pistolier. I carry a heavy sledgehammer (sledgehammer with the heavy mod which is +2 damage) for when i get swarmed by ghouls, mongrels, mole rats etc. I can 2 shot level 10 super mutants with the somerset. If hitting from sneak I can 1 shot. 
---
Cool. I hope it'll be better now then.
---
A thing you could do is set the quality settings down by 1 crack if you don't mind that.
---
Also, may I ask what graphic card you're using? Just wondering. Collecting data. xD
---
You’re the one who included your useless life story moron. Workshops are PvP, you clicked on the workshop and agreed to PvP, so stop crying like a baby over a video game that you got killed, you fucking little twat.
---
Melee is definitely the highest possible damage class right now, but honestly pretty much every build works if you're looking to be viable and not godlike. Melee's weakness is primarily Scorchbeasts and turrets, so you'll likely want to also have some ranged weapon with you for those situations. If you're looking to do a bare hands/fist weapons build just be aware that you can't use the Deathclaw Gauntlets or the Powerfist with power armor and plan your armor perks accordingly. Otherwise, play how you like. I've been using a not at all optimized rifleman build since the beta and there's not really been any situations where I've felt out of my depth
---
Tnx :) 
---
Yeah. Queen of the hunt is one of the nice spawn quests, like distant thunder and uranium fever (before they capped the loot drops at L40, need to confirm this myself..) or sons of Dane. But QotH is just, as you said, rare. 
---
Note what I’ve said elsewhere about dripping camp too close to the east ridge tower. I dropped it nearby and the random encounters stopped perking. Moved camp a bit further out to Abbey’s, and they started perking again. 
---
You can check the weight of thinks before picking them up by using transfer instead of just pick up. 
---
I have done loads of them now all solo, i did my first at level 60, died so many times, now i can do them without dying 
---
I gave a ton of plans that I didn't need (already known, just taking up space in my inventory) to a level 30 I ran into at the Watoga train station after patch 5 came out. I've done the same thing with random 1 star weapons, ammo that I don't use, lower level weapons that I already know all the mods for, etc. If I don't need it and it can help someone else, why not?
---
How late are you going to be on? Like an hour and a half or so at least? I’d like to have the instruments and pianos plans.
---
When they show low caps try selling sometimes they dont reset until you try to sell
---
I may have to if this isn't enough! Hopefully it is, though.
---
I'm using an 8gb GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, 16 GB of Crucial Ballistix Elite RAM (Gotta love Cas Latency of 8), an Intel i5-3570K 3.4Ghz Quad-Core, and have it all running on a Samsung 840 Pro SSD (with 16 GB page file for extra oomph). It's a beast of a computer which is why I have been annoyed that Fallout was so laggy. I assumed it was server side. Good to know the Shadows were at fault all along!
---
I wonder how much that has to do with all of the CTD that people talk about getting all the time. I've had like maybe 5 total since beta
---
The effect doesn't stack. :(
---
Good idea. Cant wait to see about every server filled with people with signs saying "GIVE ME MY REFUND!"
---
Clever ideas, well presented here. Thanks!
---
Never, it  was nerfed to what it is now around the release of the game to prevent people from continually farming it.
---
Since when?? Every other effect stacks like weapon and ammo reduction
---
Nice! Need to carry around a Multi-use axe and a hand drill for that craftsman feel
---
Try r/market76
---
Someone at Bethesda is convinced that PVP is the moneymaker. What you (and I) would like to see simply isn't their "vision" for the game. 
---
1 player mode - PETS
---
2 player mode - BABIES
---
more players than that, later DLC once they figure out how to design this stuff with leveling and perks for more than just our character
---
TOWNS
---
I tested it. None of the armor effects stack. :(
---
Makes sense, though, right? A full set would reduce the total weight to zero.
---
There is no information here.
---
I know unyielding and sentinel and assassin and everything else stacks I don't see why this wouldn't, that sucks
---
yeah people can just quit server and leave. 
---
I have a full set of weapon weight reduction and i can confirm it does stack.
---
Only stacks to 90% though so you lose 10% on the last piece.
---
Just out of curiosity, has anyone checked to see if Gunsmith is properly applying to energy weapons?  Just a thought...
---
Take the stuff and fuck them lol. Dont drop trade with people in the area, we have camps with locksble doors. People have done it to me before after ive died at SBQ, so i dont give a shit now,
---
if you mean how it happened, it just randomly popped up the 2nd time, and 1st time I triggered it in queen of the hunt
---
Yis. Maybe only spread the word if everything works out for you. Others could get to enjoy the game some more as well then. :)
---
But oh, damn. Nice computer you have there.
---
Definitely. But just to prevent any misunderstandings: It's not the Shadow Distance alone but also the Render Distance of the other things. 
---
It's the shadow distance mainly BUT if there's more to render from very, very afar, shadows have to be cast on those things as well. So, they're both playing along just dragging your computer on its knees. Haha
---
I don't think that it's intentional. I assumed that it was an issue with the server updating the visuals, like when you first log in or switch servers and sometimes see world items that you've already picked up.
---
I just want the free xp and plans , not interested in keeping and/or pvp. Cap 3 or 4, server hop, cap 3 or 4, etc etc.
---
it's how i got through my 20's. Pretty easy since no one pvps
---
Haha. Yeah, well, I do enjoy writing dialogue, and I made sure to "listen" to these bits of dialogue in my head in their respective voices to make sure they sounded right before committing them to text. The two of them have pretty distinctive cadences to their dialogue which is as important as their vernacular. 
---
Ugh I wish I was at your level already lol I wouldn’t have to worry about anything haha you play on Xbox? 
---
What I meant was that none of the weight reduction perks stack, probably because they all start at 20% and correspond to a perk that goes higher than that, which would allow for zero or even negative weight.
---
At least I saved you an expensive purchase.
---
I was actually thinking the other way around: That it would be cool to see robots made out of bits of power armour. There's so much of it laying around, imagine robots getting bits and pieces of T-60 armour or raider armour or whatever built into their bodies. 
---
(I was also thinking that seeing salvaged liberator parts connected to their bodies would be neat!) 
---
But yeah, having power armour which incorporates Sentrybot parts would be really imposing and cool. 
---
yeah ill be on
---
This is exactly what i use, it's so helpful in quick situations.
---
I just earned it last night.  LV 47 at the time.   XBOX.
---
Yeah lol
---
Expressing opinions/concerns and whining are two different things. The majority of people here "sharing their opinion" are ugly crying. 
---
Yeah it was okay thanks haha chuck us your gt
---
this is how we roll in the marsupials herd
---
KMooreLod 
---
I will! 😄 Yeah, I was oversimplifying it a tad.
---
And thanks, yeah, I enjoyed putting it together but even more enjoy using it. 
---
I noticed that too on mine. 
---
Server disconnects are a bit over the top today. 3 in the last hour. 
---
Haha, yeah, all good.
---
Always feels good, man.
---
Anyway, feel free to come by again if you have any issues and you're welcome.
---
Doesnt this not work when you have passive mode on tho?
---
Whitesprings? Maybe?
---
I stopped building up workshops because I was constantly getting attacked by other players when I was in build mode.  I get that it's open pvp even though I am a pacifist, but they always seemed to wait for me to be distracted. 
---
I just got tired of being a caps/junk donor.
---
Will do! Thanks again!
---
Place all basic stuctures first and plant the crops after.  The radius of planted foods supersedes any other object. Honestly, you don't really need stairs, as you can kinda walk up planted crops or jump up to the level ground easily, but if you're after a "realistic look" make sure you position your open space so there's no rocks or water in the way, as they tend to obstruct everything but the long metal staircase.  (stairs are basically impossible to place with water anywhere nearby, as it isn't erased like trees or small rock formations)  If you want walls or fencing, place it last.  I recommend against it, as it's mainly cosmetic and gets in the way of your quick food production in the event that a nuke is about to drop and you want to be prepared and repaired ASAP.  Sometimes planted crop radius interferes with walls and fencing, which is why I left the open floor plan.  I could only fence in half my garden, so I left it open.
---
Same with power attacks. Was super happy when I got a bloodied power attack sledge until I saw how fast it ate through my cores.
---
The game has major problems that are not caused by the said duping though. And the problem here is you are not getting what is being advertised. 
---
And i don't think the majority of the complaints actually mention wanting the names of the dev team and such. They are blaming bethesda as an organization as a whole. 
---
And the issue isn't about whether the product is for gaming or transportation. This is irrelevant to the point i'm making. What is relevant is that bethesda didn't deliver what they were marketing. You didnt get a $60 product that was advertised as a $60 product. And i mean this with objective factors such as game stability and such which was alr an issue from the start and multiple problems that were already known years ago that were not fixed. 
---
And, in general, more powered door options. Maybe some in the metal wall designs as well. 
---
Same. It's easier and faster to get resources by scrapping. But the xp and plans are so worth the 25 caps. 
---
I get something similar if placing things in/out of stash.
---
I remember reading 5% x 10 max
---
It is quite the pain in a nuke zone.   
---
Stacks of glowing meat from a whitesprings run is beautiful thing. Add a 3-star super duper and now you're cooking. I usually drop 10 stacks of glowing meat for most people I run into who are melee.
---
Came here to say that but didn't know about the fog crawler bonus that is very good information to have.
---
And thats exactly what you'll get! Just for a measly 76.99 you can enough atoms to buy it! 
---
With enough farming you can do that anyway. It just take more time. I just had to stop myself from visiting all the vendor every day to empty their caps limit.
---
\-dirt walls, for those coming from minecraft
---
Hello neighbor, sure is nice up there. 
---
Quest items should be (effectively) a bitmask or array of booleans. You have them or you don't, and you've used them up yet or you haven't.
---
Then when you pick up an item that you already have or won't ever need, the duplicate setting of the "I have" boolean is simply the redundant action of setting already-TRUE-X to TRUE-X.
---
Tah dah!
---
 
---
I build weapons that use the shitty ammo, and use them in low level area. It put some much need variety in the gameplay and let you save up the ammo that your spec to use properly.
---
Out of date mods? Maybe.  
---
yes cept im having trouble finding a place to put my camp thing so that my friend will spawn there too without having to climb
---
I thought grahm had it
---
I encountered at least 5 jet packs during my travels, along with 3 stealth it mods for x-pq pa
---
Just a friendly fun slightly trollzy reminder that complaining about complaining is still complaining and our best way to fight it is to direct ourselves positively.
---
Only with Grahm &amp; Watoga BoS Phoenix.
---
Not every plan is available at all times it seems. There's been times when the 'rarer' plans show up and then visits when they don't. Just server hop a couple of times at Phoenix and you'll get them I'm sure.
---
Same here!!
---
Why's that?  A single word is enough for you to completely and totally judge another person?  Don't you think that says something about you too?
---
Pc Xbox we need more info
---
In a weird backwards way, all of the attention, positive or negative, still shows *how much* people *care* about this game.
---
god yes. Was getting super annoyed at all the flowers I couldn't pick at whitesprings last night. was more in the mood for flower picking than ghoul killing and I couldn't pick half the flowers I saw. 
---
Oh you don't want to be bothered?  Because it's not all about you. 
---
What happened at level 60 ? Looks like it hurt 
---
Takes like 10 minutes for me. Easy. Ps4
---
"ah, you're finally awake"
---
you forgot the enclave bunker. theres 7 distinct factions you can sell to with a 200cap limit each, for 1400 caps every 20 hours. Also to clarify the Watoga train station is watoga, and BoS is at the super duper amrt in watoga. 
---
Sometimes you have to leave them then initiate again. Not sure why. Just another annoying bug. 
---
Sorry, by non-Starter I mean using "Full Screen" is hard on a multi-monitor setup, every time I click off the FO76 screen it minimized and sometimes just crashes.  
---
Before the December 11th and Jan 10th patches I got 100 FPS in Borderless Windowed mode (no driver updates on my side) so very curious what was done to the '76 engine to butcher the Borderless Windowed mode.  
---
I run my second and third Monitors on a second GPU in my computer, and have most applications forced to use that GPU as well (web browsers etc), it's just '76 I am seeing the terrible loss of FPS, I can get 90 FPS in FO4, same settings, in Windowed mode.
---
Two other suggestions to go with this:
---
Delete duplicate stacks of in-world objects, Red Rocket Mega Truck Stop has several newspaper stands that are actually two placed in the exact same spot, they're probably not the only ones.
---
Maybe spawn less enemies if a solo player enters an area.  24 super mutants in one location must be a drain on the server resources, why not lessen it a bit where applicable?
---
Nightkin stealth build sounds fun
---
Farm the Event Collision Course. Get a harden hunting rifle and hop up on the blue crate that's that's in-between where the scorched spawn and the cargo reward drops. Tuns of scorched to kill, tuns of 308 rounds to pick up from the dead scorched, 250xp for completing it and by snipeing everything from the top of the blue crate you mitigate a lot of potential damage. You can also take weapons off the dead scorched for to sell for caps at the near by train station and being in the back of the airport, easy access to ever type of workbench for repairs and scrapping.
---
Sadly I didn’t save any pics.   It wasn’t really all that good anyway.  I plan to try again. 
---
There are 7 different vendors altogether so you could sell 1400 caps worth of stuff a day.   
---
If you want to buy make sure you SELL FIRST! This way the caps they have goes back up and you can sell more stuff to them.   
---
Sell before and their caps stay the same.  
---
Here is a map of all vendors and factions...

After hearing all that the hate train has to say,  I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one having fun.  I play as a trader and craftsman, so feel free to hit me up.  TK84
---
I've seen the opposite were they have resources running but don't have the workshop. This way they don't have to defend it. 
---
Just got it,  it says enemies take damage for successful attacks
---
It has its bugs..sure..but man it's a pretty good game.  There's never nothing to do. Quests..farming..helping out new guys..I'm creepib up on level 50..finally be able to use these guns I've been saving for 20 levels lol
---
You would think and yet here we are...
---
You on now?
---
I just logged off for the night, but I spent most of my time getting some new guys some better weapons, ammo and armor at cost.
---
Mighty fine if you good sir
---
Others have already explained what's going on in broad strokes. Let me give you my own routine with respect to vendors, which should be instructive. 
---
When I first log in for the day, I go around to all seven types of vendors in the game (Whitesprings, Raiders, Responders, etc), and sell each of them 200 caps worth of stuff, until they're all broke. If they have anything worth buying, I'll purchase it after I've done all my selling, then sell some more stuff to bring them back down to zero caps. 
---
20 hours later, they'll all suddenly have 200 caps again, and so the next day, the first time I log in, I'll do the same again. This little run to each of the vendors typically takes up the first ten minutes of each day of gameplay, just to get it out of the way before I do anything else. 
---
Like others have said, be stacked up on stims and ammo, make sure your weapons are full health. Take cover when you need to heal. You can do it and it's a rewarding feeling.
---
I could hop back on but it'd be for 10 minutes tops.  Gotta work in the morning. 
---
Shoulda named her Raphtalia. ;-)
---
Probably means a lower level player triggered the loot there.  Try switching servers and you should find stuff equal to your level if you're the first one there.
---
That looks more like a torjan horse. 
---
As the old saying goes, "beware of geeks bearing gifs".
---
If you wanna trade a little I can give you some business lol. If not no big deal
---
In game now
---
I'm working towards doing something like this. Not sure why you're being down voted. People complain about no player economy, then players take it upon themselves and boo.
---
I can confirm, after I took holiday and didn't play for maybe 3 weeks, the last update made the plans easier. As you search through the vendors, it'll tell ya whether not you already have it, and in this case it will list the excavator in the item description. The Grafton bot loaded a whole mess of excavator mods first time I played since download.  I see near every mod, but no stealth boy or the extra extra leg carry weight... Given this set is the only one already with a carry weight addition. I did not yet see ether calibrated shocks for the legs, but yes on explosive vent. Also, the price of all this cool shit has gone way the hell up to where nobody can afford it, so good luck in your search. But yes, Grafton bot has the goods to mod your excavator power armor
---
That was a scorched with a gamma gun. They're more dangerous than the SB, as it's nonstop automatic radiation fire
---
Oh, I see. Don't worry.  
---
This is definitely the game that's not set up correctly. I doubt they have 21:9 or 3 monitor setups to test things out.  
---
Yes, definitely. Something happened there. You're not the only one telling me this but then again I haven't played the game then and I also never play on Borderless/Windowed. I'm not surprised there are issues with it.  
---
I also don't think it's the engine's fault but how they compiled it into the game .exe without setting those things up the right way. The engine pretty much doesn't have much to do with it. It's how the developpers have set this up.  
---
I highly recommend you report this to Bethesda anywhere you can so they actually look into it and fix this.  
---
The issue with FO76 and Fallout 4's presets is the poor hardware usage. This thing I wrote here isn't just for high fps but overall getting more fps while making your GPU work more.  
---
It's a bit different, so please, don't misunderstand.  
---
I don't think there currently is a way of setting this up the correct way if you're using 3 monitors. Other users who have already commented hre, have turned off their other monitors and say it worked like that.  
---
If you're fine doing it this way for the meantime until they fully fix this, I think it's the best way.  
---
I understand you completely however. This is one of those things where the user can't do much and is dependant on the makers to fix those things. I for example can't fix the things I want because they haven't released the Creation Kit for this game yet. Sucks, but I also have to wait. I feel you.
---
I have my camp near one, claim it every time if it's not already. The rewards and xp is worth more than the 25 caps. Sometimes I gather on it, depends on my needs.
---
there are some people on this subreddit that literally just downvotes post because they don't like it when others are  trading/selling or offering crafting services.
---
I had a furious handmade where if you aim down sights it did 10 extra damage, from what it felt like with furious was beginning bullets it feels like your hitting like a gnat then when it builds up feels like its has a bit of a punch on enemy damage. My problem with furious was the amount of bullets and weapon dur didn't feel worth it.
---
Says your offline
---
It does that to my fiancee sometimes too.
---
Stronger at what? What do you want to do exactly.

I play only with explosive shotguns and farm any location with ease. Basically 1 shot anything but tanky animals/robots.

Yes. It doesn't

Now I know why your name is punda. It hurts my gifty soul as a Greek to read that.

Well done.

After you said “swell kid” I read the rest like jimmy Stewart

I went to start it for the 1st time and got rads anywhere near the place. What do you do? Just rad x?

Thanks for the follow up.
---
The uninstall. 
---
No. Theres not enough plans in game for a system like that. 
---
I love this idea. I completely agree we need more wall types in the game. If they want they can do wall papers for the interiors in the atomic shop, but base game would super benefit from new walls
---
Lol besides that
---
Can’t have both the stealth boy and jet pack on the same torso without utilizing a glitch. 
---
THANK YOU. Tried very hard to explain to my friend that the only thing that mode does is keep you from accidently getting a bounty or starting a fight with stray shots. 
---
Same..sent you an invite
---
Should have bought them. You could flip them on the trading subs and used the money to buy a calibrated shocks mod. 
---
now they gonna patch it :/ 
---
And how does him not participating in PvP change your experience?

Guess what they have?

just buy the fusion generator plans...but i forget which vendor sells them

Maybe add things in the comments that you need fixed. I'll also send them a request on their website once I have more issues or after 1 day or so if I don't get any more.
---
Yep. There a LOT of players out there that don’t understand, and it leads to a lot of incorrect claims of bugs/glitches.
---
If you move the camp unit around after placing the camp itself it help a lot, since that seems to move the spawn-in point, took me a while, but I found a good spot after some trying around.
---
Didn't see it, what's your Bethesda name?
---
I have to disagree with most of that logic there. With that way of thinking you put the victim at fault, essentially saying " well if she didn't want that to happen, she shouldn't dress that way." It doesn't excuse shitty behavior. There is absolutely no tactical reason or advantage to claiming a workshop and then traveling to the player on the map to engage them. That is done ONLY to have an opportunity to engage a player, likely an unknowingly one. 
---
There's a mod for server/local chat? I just started and am lvl 8.
---
I’m still planning on being on in about 30 minutes. You say you have other plans not listed, so when I meet up with you I’ll want to look over what you have, there may be other things I’m interested in. My GT is JDBuckSavage. Thanks.

Well, pour that man a glass of Lagavulin Scotch. It's Ron F##kin Swanson.

Replace your call where it sits to get you generator back for 40 caps

Problems at Whitespring right now.  Server-lag.  Couldn't pick anything up. Locks and doors won't open at the pool.  I was stalked to my CAMP by an invisible enemy and hit repeatedly (not a person using a stealth boy - no one was there).  I then dropped dead with forty percent of my health in tact and fully hydrated and fed. 
---
They nerfed two shot from +100% dmg to only +25% dmg, explosive bullets from +100% dmg to only +20% dmg, Demolition Perk from +100% dmg to only +60% dmg. They also removed all duped weapons from people's inventory but only for those with multiple stacks of the same weapon. Curreng stash limit is 600 lbs but they will raise it to 800 next week. They will be adding PvP servers in March. That's about it.
---
&gt;This is fallout and we're here to have fuckin fun

I always left that to the GTA's and the SaintRows and the Far Crys etc. 
---
pink princess bed in the atom shop it’s a must have for full immersion
---
Duplication glitches got out of hand, but have recently been (mostly) corrected.  
---
Server stability was addressed both by the removal of (most) duped items, and a server side update.  
---
Many plans are more readily available from vendors.  
---
Two-shot and Explosive have been balanced, melee is still in need of it.  
---
Scorched beast AI has been tweaked to reduce sonic machine-gun spamming.  
---
There's more, but I can't think of them off hand.
---
If it's true I'm back in
---
From the Beta until the December patches I got 90 - 100 FPS in borderless windowed mode, and lost 30'ish FPS then, and then another 30 FPS with the Jan update.  
---
Would love to see whatever changed, and increasing the frequency of CTD's fixed
---
Rad-X or power armor and ignore the little rads over that.
---
Same, but will build for Oil as well :)
---
Sometimes it just for a challenge to gain a few atoms.
---
This is why I wish we had modding. We'd have so many awesome skins that are actually high quality.
---
I guess there'd be no reason to buy atoms then, considering you're getting worse quality for a premium. 
---
Im really disappointed with the atom shop so far.
---
Ive only bought the vampire armor. It wasn't so bad. Everything else I've seen is pretty disappointing. 
---
It doesn't. He is free to change servers or just leave the area if he doesn't want to PvP.  What he is asking for, is an invulnerability switch, and that is changing the game.
---
Just checking through before I wrote that. You didn't have to take them all, though.
---
\[XB1\] Please, perk cards presets would be a fabulous fo76 feature. Perk presets could be reward drops from quests.
---

I did my first at 50ish solo and had 0 problems. Vanguard Armor and melee weapons. So effing easy. 
---
You can keep playing the game all you want, but that doesn't make it any less horrible. It's simple. Games should be fun, not be chores.
---
I almost did. I was exiting mine and it went into third person like normal, but then it appeared as though I was clipping inside another set, like it was duped. Kinda stayed like that for about ten seconds until the second PA went away and I exited. 
---
I have 42 Battle bot event keys...
---
Yeah, I'm testing this Radium now, and it feels kinda like that, but I also think I like it. The only TSE I have is one of the ultra rare laser ones, so it breaks so fast, and doesn't seem to do nearly as much damage as ballistic TSEs. So I think I kinda like this Furious Radium. Basically I put a speedy receiver on it to get to max damage ASAP, but I agree it is kinda a bullet pit.
---
The concrete blocks still count against building budget when you delete them to make your camp float.
---
Now you're getting it!
---
My buddy has crappy internet, he came over to my place and hooked into my wifi and said mines way better than his. Usually when we play hes having tons of issues, not a blip at my place. Might be your service provider. 
---
Has there been a rise?  Seemed pretty common from day 1.  I was doing it pretty regularly from the start, and would even claim multiple workshops if it seemed like no one else was doing it (though ultimately 1 was enough, and I stuck to that).  Was a nice little distraction and source of loot.  Eventually I created a little 4x4 cabin with all the crafting stations in it and blueprinted it, then I could slap it down shortly after claiming.  Saves time and gives me a nice little setup to return to for defense events.
---
There doesn't seem to be much benefit in building up beyond that, though.  Even if they fixed the connection issues, making anything elaborate would only be worth it if it was easy to return to the same server, or restore structures used in previous servers.  I do most of my building with my CAMP, since that's semi-permanent.
---
Code gets copied and pasted all the time. Source: AAS in Computer Programming.

Yes, you were wrong. Don't take other people's stuff.

.still couldnt exit
---
If you haven't done Mayor for a Day, Watoga is the bees knees
---
Could be many things. I'm not going to lie when I first started, I didn't understand how they worked. So I would take a workshop and defend it when it needed to. 
---
But I didn't understand that you could collect resources. So maybe new players doing that?
---
this is several months later.  Ive since finished what Id call all other missions, all I have not on my completion screen are these 2, bureau tourism and that prison wrongful escape quest; Falsely accused, which I think triggers after this.  after reading all the items necessary to complete this quest, I feel like I already did all this shit months ago, before we all got bored and ended up with the whole nuke launch deal.  I still refuse to look up the code, as I want to solve the near impossible anagram whatever puzzle on Sunday night and launch my own bomb...I'm so far behind in that aspect just refuse to give into the internet part of the game.  is it even possible to decode yourletters and find the right word and not need 6 keycards to go in there and guess?  
---
sorry, I ramble.  any way to re-trigger this way early Grafton mission, going to the mayor terminal in Grafton never starts it, as I feel I already finished this but it is missing on my side quest list...so i for sure never did FALSELY ACCUSED...or Ill just burn my system if I cant find a resolution.  I'm one second from reaching lvl 100
---
I'm not sure to be honest. This game has a perk system so if you drop all your loot you also lose your weapon your built is based on so you may be very weak to start over from scratch with the next random weapon you find. But on the other hand i seen Rust and is capable of delivering amazing survival content when everything matters. But Rust has a lot more freedom. It doesn't have the weight limits you find in Fallout. So if you kill a player and he drops everything you immediatly become overencumbere and can't teleport. You also don't have where to put all that loot because of the limited stash on your camp. It is slso unfair that the perdon you stole thd loot from can't get it back if you put it in your stash. It would be demoralising to stealthy kill someone in his camp, take away his most powerfull weapons, and don't even have to escape his base because you can safely put it in his stash that is also your stash.
---
 I have only seen a level 5. You get it pretty early in the quest line and its your first good pistol.
---
 I tossed the Voice of Set, a Anti Robot perk on that, for my present stock, but maxxed Western Revolver. Its my Pistol and goes with my Lever Action nicely for my Rifleman build. I have the Sword of Bastet that comes with its own Armor Pierce and 3 levels of Incisor for over 90% Armor Piercing total, to round out my look.

Commenting just for a future reference.  Thanks for sharing.

Don't think that would work since it's considered a Quest. Although I do think they should fix the quest as it is suppose to drop things that are currently impossible to get by legitimate means

If you enable Pacifist mode you get reduced damage but other players can still murder you.  Can someone please explain the value of this?  This seems useless at preventing griefing and appears to encourage it.

---
Same here...  
---
I find that Melee (All Rise, super sledge) in Power Armour works best.  It's more challenging at lower levels, without power armour, and with standard weapons.  But I have done it.  You just need to bring some Rad-X, lots of Stim Paks, and Rad-Away.
---
I'll be online on Saturday if you still need help...
---
 I guess the .44 mods would work and I believe that chain goes up on the 5, so there mi9ght be a level 45 one. I don't know if its leveled or not though.
---
 One would have to do the quest at a high level to find out and I kinda remember doing it well over 5 and getting a level 5 one. 
---
I made a post about this long time ago and people berated me over it, telling me its a function in the game even though i knew something was up because when i was in power armor using vats with mu crit build sniper it would destory my cores.
---
Healing factor + Twisted Muscles + Martial Artist + Incisor + good Melee Weapon + Power Armor
---
They look like they’re taking their bow at the end of a performance. Well done, Mutants. Good Mutants. Bravo. 
---
Yeah, they gave everybody 5k caps at Christmas. Don't worry about it, maybe there'll be an Easter egg.
---
Or you can use Melee + Healing Factor and don't waste anything.
---
Are you seriously comparing GTA Online to Fallout 76? In GTA Online, 90% of the servers want to kill you for absolutely no reasons at all so if you want to not be killed over and over, you would turn on passive mode(which btw completely handicap you by locking all your weapons therefore you couldn't do any PvE at all).

That's pretty rad man. I wish I could up-vote twice.

I had something similar happen a couple nights ago. Was lvl 20 and trying to carefully lure a ghoul or two at a time to the bots at the hotel so I could get the saber when a higher level player came along and helped clear a patb for me. There are more helpful players in this game then griefers.

I believe him. I’ve been back about 10 times today.  Even when the rest of the room/building is farmed abs not respawning anything else, you can count on at least (8) Stimpaks.  
---
So you basically want an invulnerability switch. Might get frustrating for people to not know who they can and can't damage, it would be stupid to even keep pvp at this point. And without pvp they need to completly remove the bounty system from the game bacause they also removed it from the upcoming Survival Mod servers that are coming in March. Seriously man, pvp on Adventure mode is so weak it's like you're complaining that a bunny has sharp teeth.

It's Grognak's Axe...  Though, as a Patriots fan, if we could rename weapons I would probably rename it Gronk's Axe...  .grin.     I have one of those as well, had two.  I dumped a one star Beserker Grognak's Axe but I kept a 2 star legendary.  I forget what the affects are.
---
I just got a one star furious handmade.  It's my new favorite toy.  I started out as a sniper but it didn't scale well as I got into the higher levels.  Then I got a level 50 All Rise and started joining Nuke zones.  But, with the handmade I found that love of sniping again.  Plus it works equally well close up.
---
I dunno i was feeling a certain way haha
---
Reenacting the It's Always Sunny finale?
---
Don’t forgot about the neat but underwhelming alien blaster 
---
Yup, I have a 2 star handmade, and a 2 star gauss. I forget exactly what. But the gauss one shoot most anything save scorch beasts. Handmade is great backup, or low lv clearing. 
---
I just want to find somebody that wants this ax, before I sell it to vender. 
---
The removal of dupes didn't required any patch, just a small maintenance. Something is clearly wrong with your internet/client. Outdated mods maybe.
---
HUNGRY FOR APPLES?
---
Maybe it's a Puttergeist.
---
Now that's role playing and community support done right!! 
---
Is there a way to move the camp without picking up the structure? My camp is there as well and I’m having the same spawn in problems
---
With stealth melee you can 1 shot those as well.
---
He likely wants it for the gold 44 skin, which doesn't work on voice of set, or the western revolver
---
imagine all the toxic crap that would be on it tho
---
Or ditch 76 and play Exodus instead. Its pretty good. Also playing Anthem. &lt;3
---
I’m level 24 and just got the game about a week ago. I was a blind hater but now I’m kicking myself for not getting it sooner. It’s a really fun game.
---
On 14th there was no patch update just a small maintenance where they removed all dupes from the game but only on those with multiple stacks of the same weapon. The 800 stash patch is next week.
---
You're a god damn wizard
---
Scrue accuracy, buff durability.
---
 Ah, you are probably right. Too much information I thought, he just wants to buy one. ;) 
---
Exactly, so they have no excuse not to bring this in
---
#***PESTILENCE DETECTED***  
---
Yes there is: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
durability should be buffed for every weapon tbh
---
5 hours and no disconnects! I didn't believe it as I loaded, but now I'm starting to think we may be out of the woods!
---
I've been a Beth supporter overall since launch, but I've vented about the disconnects a lot. Now I won't know my place in the community LOL
---
I've met four kinds of people in this game ranging from assholes who are scum of them earth, to people who just aren't nice, to regular people, to absolute good Samaritans who are willing to help no matter what. 
---
Great idea, we will now implement: “tiny princess,  foam crown for 2000 atom shop points”
---
Dude I’m not gonna lie I’m drunk as fuck right now but I agree man they need to work on some shit 
---
I just got a Furious 5.56 Handmade rifle, non-automatic.  I love it.  Each successive hit does more damage.  I also have the Rifleman, Ignore x% Armour, and Sniper perk cards so that helps as well.  Personally, I noticed the difference right away and love it.
---
I've read that certain types of Furious weapons aren't worth it as it's easy to miss, and if you miss a shot you go back to base level.  It also means that you shouldn't use automatic and, if it's an option, you want to select the reduced recoil options when upgrading the weapon.  You want each successive hit to count with a Furious weapon.
---
Basically, I'm thinking that some weapons with specific configurations work better as a Furious type than others...
---
free plans for defending it
---
I know the gap you mean, although I'm fairly sure if you rotate the door it fits? 
---
its not them it's you, bud
---
Happens to me often. Sometimes FT to another location allows me to exit. So when I’m stuck I FT to the Vault, exit PA, then FT back to my camp. 
---
could just be keeping someones dropped loot
---
I made a scorched by activating all blemishes, damage and scars actually looks like someone from the burn ward
---
Keep 100 of everything mby 200 of adhesive, springs and screws.
---
I think those have their own subs, so...
---
hey as long as i have free range to kill any ghoul-players it's fine by me lmao
---
Wish PC had *any* achievements at all. Still kind of stunned that they just said “nah, fuck them” and didn’t include them at all.
---
all the rest are even lower than 100 something else is eating up my space i noticed i have many plasma cores 60
---
I say dont worry about what you might need later. Save your springs and screws and to hell with everything else. You can claim a workshop or 2 and get what you need later relatively easily.
---
Pretty sure she killed him.
---
Is it bannable to use it?
---
Yes I follow them too. Just saw this post on the feed so..
---
does that button do anything yet? found it during the beta and it didnt do anything
---
AFAIK it prevents you from doing damage to players and player owned structures. It also prevents you from doing wanted damage to other players (like when they attack you).
---
Your name makes me laugh so much I already forgot what your bitching about.  
---
Try bulking your junk to sell what you don't need. You might have a couple thousand lead or steel without realizing. Get rid of ammo you dont use. Sell the weapons and armor you are not going to fight with. You're gonna have to choose. Keep your important junk; screws, gears, aluminum, etc. but check how much wood, steel, etc. you have. Those are plentiful so you shouldn't store them if you are at your limit. At the end you can wait till the patch that gives your an extra 200 weight. 
---
No. There is a statement from one of the community managers somewhere in this subreddit regarding mods and the usage is not forbidden.
---
...stay there.
---
wait until you find out how much Mutation Serum Recipes cost at the BoS site Whitespring Command Center....
---
Yea you should just sell all them...... your stash should be mostly filled with junk and probably s weapon or two and a power armor frame. They dont give much space to hoarders in this game which sucks a bunch coming from previous games.
---
yeh that didnt work for me
---
After using this, I don't think I can go back
---
Yeah, the physical camp you got from Vault 76. Pick that up and move it. That's the spawn point.
---
No, your point is that this is a "Multiplayer Survival" (Hardly.) and that it's different from a Co-op game.
---
Yes! You're right, it's not a traditional fallout game, it's missing most of it's core fundamental elements.
---
Back at the ole "repeating myself for no reason" again, there's indie survival games that out compete FO76 by leaps and bounds, the PvP is unrewarding, and beyond janky, janky like, "You have to openly attack someone and deal virtually no damage, then until your opponent feels comfortable attacking back you are in limbo." janky.
---
I moved mine a couple of weeks ago to a really nice area with forked streams and built it as a Tree house, with part of it circling the tree.  The Garage is on a cliff on the other side of the stream with a garden in front, stairs leading to a dock next to my water purifier.  
---
My next attempt will be a castle with a courtyard and turrets, using the forked stream as a moat.  I hope that Bethesda adds a powered drawbridge as a door type at some point.  It would be cool to be able to have it span a small gorge with a power button on the other side.  Until then I'll have to stick with the large garage door.
---
I think it has something to do with the apparel you are wearing under the armour. The ritual bindings and helmet were really giving me issues for days and when I switched to something else the issue stopped happening.
---
I thought I tried that and it ended up blueprinting my whole camp, causing me to have to rebuild from scratch 
---
what are you supposed to do with treasure maps now? I've never figured that out. 
---
A bug where the weapon doesn't find a host so lies on the ground.
---
Eventually it will ping a host nearby it just chose the chest to Goto 
---
No uncapped frame rate, as it would run over my 100hz and cause tearing.
---
I even disabled g-sync as people said 76 doesn’t play well with it.
---
I’ve been trying to just play it at 3440x1440, just all ultra, and even your settings. Did another clean install of the game, and even leaving everything at defaults it happens.
---
Your camp is amazing, but your spot isn't. If I came across your camp while I was server hopping for that damn vendor bot I would've torched the place... Other than that, it's beautiful keep up the good work! 
---
Planning on it. 76 was rocky to begin with and I even logged over 350 hours SMH. Its much much worse now IMO. Realy love the Fallout series but they really crap the bed on this one man. Js.
---
I just got the game 2 days ago and besides some bugs and a little bit of lag I really dint get all the hate the game is getting 
---
Lol. She looks like E.T. 🤣
---
Preach! 
---
Yeah.  I waited till I collected 10.    Got the same handful of ammo and stim paks as I get with one. 
---
You find the spot where the treasure is and click on the mound on the ground and the treasure map leaves your inventory and some stuff gets put into your inventory. Then you click again if you have another treasure map for that spot, etc.
---
I have Home Defense 3. I can make missile turrets in a workshop or my camp, unslot Home Defense, and they stay and work.
---
If I came to your CAMP and built said Missile Turret, it would stay and work, UNTIL you stored it or moved camp. Then it would show up in your STORED settlement tab but won't allow you to place it again, at least until the perk is slotted by the one moving or deploying it.
---
My Armorer3/FixitGood3 are only slotted when I sit down to craft armor, ever.
---
In short, everyone is a crafter if they have these perks, whether slotted at any given moment or not. I made a crafting alt with 15 intelligence and plenty of luck so there is utility in having a crafter only perk since the higher Intelligence makes the armor's hp bar much longer. I read some number crunching that suggested the gains from high INT during crafting fall off substantially after 11-12 INT, so maybe 15 INT is overdoing it.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Is this how Milk of Human Kindness works?
---
Okay, this is cool...   I like the idea of the rooftop garden, where it is protected from local critters.
---
Funny and sad, what is that, poignant? Nice job.
---
That means they had it, built collectors &amp;c but have quit the game.
---
Yes.
---
I would like that too...  I've run the Fertile soil event often enough to wonder why we can't have various size/shaped planter boxes with earth inside.  
---
It would let you build your CAMP in areas where either there isn't enough dirt (i.e. on a cliff) or where there are a lot of critter attacks and still have a protected garden.
---
Lol I had a guy try to get my stuff when I got swarmed by 10-13 super mutants lvl68 and asked to get my stuff back from him and he shot me. My response  was pulling out my two shot fat man and killing him 5 times before he rage quit. Hours and hours of grinding for my pvp weapons helps mitigate jerks.
---
Good.
---
This happens to me with legendary pieces that fall out of the SQB. I distinctly recall receiving a legendary combat chest from her, but also saw it on the ground, so did my husband. Neither of us could pick it up though. Dunno if it was the same one but it was kinda weird just seeing a tangible chest piece in the dirt.
---
Literally the only thing I wanted from Fallout 76, ever since Moira Brown wanted you to irradiate yourself, and it's still not in the game.
---
I've noticed glitched out enemies stuck in walls or those that die and fall into the map will usually spawn their loot in nearby containers. 
---
Then...unsub from here? 
---
Why do they always use their knees and elbows, as the first point of contact? I've had a bust lip and recently black eye from my 4 year old girl. Good luck with your reemployment bud. Don't let the uranium fever get you down.
---
Many of us are/were in the same situation. I cleared my Weapons and Apparel tabs completely for starters, made NO DIFFERENCE overall lol
---
Then hit up the ammo tab, dropped thousands of unused ammo, and made sure no missles/grenades/nukes were in there. Still little difference!
---
Knowing my junk would be the problem, I bulked up and sold everything but oil, screws, springs, fibre optics and nuclear materials. Whatever would let me bulk, I bulked. Shockingly, only dropped a few dozen pounds, all this bulking, bulked stuff in my inventory and not in STASH.
---
I was not expecting what I saw in my AID tab. Holy shit, everything weighed tons more than I expected. I slot the perk Chemist when I make drugs, so I throw Mentats and Buffout in there until I have a few dozen of each, then slot Chemist and make Fury. Well, I made all the stuff i could and cooked everything and removed spoiled leftovers, hundreds of weight cleared, totally didn't expect this to be the issue. Food, drugs, ingredients, all weigh so much. Sugar, for example, I had 60+ sugar, they weight so much all by themselves, and I rarely use more than 1 or 2 for my Squirrel Bits cooking, and they are easy to make with plants found almost everywhere... once I got AID under control, everything has been easy and clean to manage :)
---
Don’t let Strong see this. He might try getting it from the Sole Survivor if he does. 
---
Unlike him, I wouldnt shoot first or shoot back. I just let people follow me to my base and have them watch as I fix, build and craft things with their shit I took :) 
---
Haha nobody said that. But different strokes for different folks. Some people like to grief and some people like to whine like little bitches. 
---
How much for right arm? 
---
Platform?
---
pc
---
I will be on later today, have a couple of pieces, robot lvl 50 right leg and left arm I think. Both are 3* and I will give them to you hella hella cheap or trade for 2* + leather pieces. :) Msg me on Xbox if ur interested, GT same as username here.
---
Check your aid tab. Chems can weigh a lot. Plus the 40mm grenades, missiles, and mini-nukes. Burnt books (and comics too, I think) weigh 1 pound each, but they’re under misc and not junk, so you won’t scrap them. Plans and recipes also weigh a pound, so read the ones you don’t know and drop the rest.  
---
Let me play as a super mutant and a deathclaw. I also want to play as a vertibird 
---
I've got it for the torso, I didn't ever see it for arms/legs. made sense in my head cos of the imagined size of a torso vs arms/legs. Time for me to waste screws making armor for scrapping attempts again :)
---
Didn't mean I didn't believe hi. Just whaaaaaat? Fuck yea!

I can make it for you. 500 caps. IGN: jchamlin. Online now. What's your IGN?

---
Yeah, in this case, my preset isn't gonna help much either since it's just a preset. If you get crashing, it's something else from the game.
---
I don't think you've overclocked your card and this game doesn't like it. My 1080 is pretty much yawning from being exhausted. Got it to 2.1ghz and run that constantly so I doubt it's that.

I've already posted this as a bug for Bethesda to read and will send them a message once I get more things to bring up.

Me too and i also agree. Im loving this shit
---
You just answered your own question.
---
I've been finding plans that I haven't learned, at least one or two for about 4 hours of gameplay, and I know a lot of plans.  I get plenty of dupes as well, but I am finding new stuff.
---
I've found that taking over workshops and doing at least one defend event gives you building plans.  I take over two each play session at the very beginning to replenish certain supplies and to get the plans.  It's also a great way to get Stimpaks.  Then I move on to Nuke events, etc.
---
Pleasant Valley Cabins, near where the Raider Power Armour is in the circular fighting pit, has about 3 to 4 plans, mostly armour.  Last time there I got some Light Combat Armour plans that I didn't know.  You could server hop in this area...
---
It takes work to get them, but it can be done.  But, yeah, if you don't want to work for it, then why not just buy them from the in-game vendors?   
---

---
I hear where you’re coming from and I was there not long ago too. 
---
In not too much time you’ll get to the point where you can go a week without earning something new. The problem is actually that I may have “worked” too hard and the remaining plans, raider underarmor last level for example, are not sold by vendors.
---
It’s not a major problem, it’s just that it feels next to impossible to work towards anything *specific* in the end game because plans and loot are so random. I guess I’ll probably need to hit up in game trading to fill the last few gaps.
---
+karma Thank you!

Very cool idea! My character Sarella has a crazy psycho raider chick vibe going on but I never thought to do age progression. Sounds like it was a fun experience.

Since the last server reset the Bethesda launcher doesn't show Fallout 76, anymore. I can normally start the game with the executable. What's wrong?
---
I’m joking. Radiation heals ghouls.
---
I love helping people in this game. Whenever I see a level one still in vault 76, I run to my weapons workbench real quick and make then a decked out automatic pipe rifle with all the best mods and a suppressor, then I fast travel to the vault and drop the gun, a few hundred ammo, and 10-20 healing salves (since I usually have a few hundred saved up) then I wait for them to get out of the vault and surprise them with a nice welcome to the wasteland carepackage.
---
The chalenges should be seen on the main menu when you have your map open. I personally just save up atoms to get stuff from the atomic shop that I want
---
Good to know, if you see a legendary on the ground check the local containers
---
Sell the weapons you have that aren't in heavy rotation. You'll find better ones.
---
Drop any ammo that you do not possess a weapon for, like in a suitcase or cash register near a vendor.
---
Keep any power armor pieces on a power armor chassis, along with one fusion core. Together they weigh just 10 lbs, but separate they weigh a whole lot.
---
Also notice that your more valuable junk is not bulkable so it doesn't it doesn't show up at a tinker's workbench. And some of your junk doesn't auto-scrap (like beer bottles) so you have to scrap them manually to reduce their weight.
---
Then aid builds up pretty fast. You don't need 100 stimpaks or 50 rad-X, or food you don't eat, any chems you don't use. If you pick up any flux, notice that it becomes heavier when it goes inert.
---
True, but you could heal the ghouls around the player your trying to kill :) 
---
Yeah, if it helps I can tell you my route.

Whatever one that scorched bastard  that occasionally spawns down by the queen has. That thing is bad ass. Fried 3 dudes in xo1 before i knew whatwas happening. Luckily Daisy cutter beats scorched assholes. 💪💪👍

If only I could get the hands on that one. I found a bloodied gamma gun and was disappointed that only the ballistic damage scales with the affect. 
---
The Racecar bed wants a word with you
---
Wait what? Really?

Thanks, I just made a [tiny room](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/546260057243910144/unknown.png) for my veggies so enemies stop molesting them since the dirt spots are pretty crappy in my camp. Only way in and out is a [shelf ladder](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/546261099071275008/unknown.png) \&gt;.&gt; so random normies can get food w/o any doors left open. I wish they'd just give us the planters from Fallout 4 but this'll do... at least it actually lets you put them tighter together than the planters did.
---
Lol this is great. I made this same thing for my first charter but the at some point changed the out look completely lol.
---
Nice, added a scar to mine for each death, reducing all by 1% each (real) day.  Well, that was the plan anyway, haven't died yet.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I did not downvote you.
---
Anti-Armor is just a strong choice, generally. Though Gamma guns generally aren't for killing dudes in power armor, they're for instakilling bloodied/unyielding shitlords. Furious would be fun, as well. Though, I've been told that gamma guns always spawn with bonus limb damage for the second star.
---
In Mire you can find a plan for the shrouded mod for wood armor as part of a questline. It's exclusive to wood armor. It acts like ultra-light, shadowed, and sleek mods if they were all rolled into one. Chances are if you're min-max stealth+melee or stealth+guns you want unyielding wood armor. You'll miss out on some of the other cool legendary effects (AP refresh, +1 special, Sentinel/Cavalier), but the mod is pretty incredible. It's also useful if you want increased sneak speed but want another mod on your legs. You could run strengthed or whatever mod on your legs to prevent them from getting crippled and run 2 wood armor pieceson the arms with the shrouded mod and you'll get the max sneak speed benefit.
---
Wood armor is pretty damn useful.
---
It's not there, standing on the exact spot, ran around every square inch of the north-eastern region of the map (have also discovered every location in the game except this one)

I'd just recommend [reading the Wiki's description](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4) of how damage resist works for Fallout 4, since it's got most of the important details you need to know and will probably do the best job of explaining it.  
---
Fallout 76 presumably utilizes damage resistance in the same way since it shares a lot of Fallout 4's mechanics.  
---
The most basic understanding I have is that if you have a damage resistance that matches the number of the attack hitting you, you'll take exactly half of the damage of that attack.  From there, however, there are diminishing returns for how high the damage reduction can go.

This is currently true. The people who think this is a feature are assholes with an emotional age of 6. The people who defend them by saying, "Oh, this is just part of the game" are assholes with an emotional age of 7. The people who think this is a bug are frustrated, and most of us are running out of patience waiting for a fix. Note: PvP servers *is not an adequate fix!*

Hey I know this was a long time ago but I remember you. You was the guy that was using Hunting Rifle right ? Just when I heard the turrets I felt that my duty is to destroy these commies camp. Never had so much fun in my life. Cheers :) !
---
I have seen the park bench on grahm before and after the update. As far as I'm aware grahm is the only vendor that sells it. 
---
That was happening with me for the last few weeks. I have found that if your able to switch to another weapon on your favorite wheel and your able to reload it then your game is loaded enough to open the pipboy
---
Hahah my man!!!
---
I was laughing so hard watching it all unfold. 
---
You might not belive but they were so salty. One of them sent me messages that included... well bad words :). Once again cheers and have a good day wastelander !
---
Damn so thats what happened to my fusion cells! I found an assaultron head once like 3 weeks ago and I went oooh cool! I tried it out and was able to shoot it once and i was like wait a minute I thought I had like 500 ammo. I thought I was crazy and just misremembered how much I had!
---
 Yesterday the first blue screen after weeks.
---
I missed that sonofabitch.
---
Ty for the information.
---
You wont see much difference from a regular character with 4 char (lone wanderer) using hard bargain and grape mentats and hard bargain (swap). 
---
I mean maybe for the 20k cap plans but still.. Depends how much you value your time.
---
Honestly the chem weight perk (forgot name) is the best money making perk in the game, that's all you really need to get the 200 caps from each vendor a day. 
---
Its the way the games setup, even before they released the game they stated workshops were for pvp.. you enter/take/build a work shop you enter pvp.. period..
---
He took a work shop. He invited/flagged himself for pvp.
---
The only exceptions to that are steel and lead for me. I can easily use 400 steel just making bullets all in one trip to my tinkers bench. I have probably gone through 50,000 bullets easily so for in this game.
---
hmm..ok..i change my apparel all the time and it has happened when in in the ratty skirt....letterman outfit..
---
I'd imagine a fair amount, especially if alongside that you take some beer, mothman omelette and grape mentats. Plus wear some unyielding armour at low health!
---
My charisma is only 5 and I have hard bargain level 1. Even with that plus grape mentats and beer takes the price down a good amount. 
---
I think furious stacks? I am not so sure. Bloodied only gives more ballistic instead of rads. But any gamma gun with deep dish does a ton of rad damage.
---
I've got my camp right along the river next to sunshine industrial. I should have placed it further down on the junk pile but I didnt realize until way later it was there and I have way too nice a setup to move now (when I was level 15 a level 120 joined my team and used all his known plans to build me a bunch of sweet stuff) Its nice though that there is a ton of soot flower and bloodleaf. With green thumb I can spend about 10 minutes getting 60-70 of each 100 each if its verdant season, then I use chemist and get 2 healing salves for each craft. I have about 400 healing salves at any given time and they are really great for selling to vendors. I'm able to bankrupt all 7 vendor factions each day when I remember to.
---
Try the enclave officer uniform. I seem to have no problems in my power armour wearing that. Headwear could maybe be the issue for example the ritual helmet has branches that would clip into the pa helmet. 
---
I honestly don't know if it is the apparel causing the issue. Its just changing mine seemed to fix it.
---
i will try changin apparel...maybe even naked  😁
---
I repair &amp; upgrade weapons &amp; armor if I have too much of the required junk.
---
I drop ammo that I don't use in front of a vendor, someone else may have a use for it.  I have bandolier equipped, so I'm talking about non-ballistic ammo; I've never been able to sell flamer fuel.
---
I sell junk that I have too much of, except what other people here have mentioned to keep.
---
I find a lower level player and craft some weapons &amp; armor for them, and give them a donation of aid &amp; junk.
---
I actually enjoy inventory management.
---
Cool and happy cake day
---
How is it even possible to build that big of a house with the budget limit? Mine is a quarter of that size and i'm at like 90%.

Not anymore unfortunately no. Its feed the person now.

Thats a terrible idea! NO WAY! I like the way the normal server is now. I almost never pvp but I like having the option to and I like getting to hunt bounties on people. I don't want to choose between playing an all the time pacifist server and an all the time pvp server. 
---
Thanks, trying to buy all the plans in the game
---
Caps isn’t really a problem for me, but I do want buy all for the lowest offer 
---
Just wanted to know the discount percentage 
---
the game should hide items already held
---
&gt;  It’s understandable that using VATS is linked to fusion cores and action point drainage when in power armor.
---
I don't actually see why.  You can do it outside of power armour and no energy source is drained.  Yet when you're in PA it drains fusion cores.  Which is it - does it require energy or not?
---
I'd put up with this for the sake of game balance, if it was implemented reasonably.  But last night I did a circuit of the golf course and a few other bits and pieces, took 12 cores with me, and finished the night with 3.  That is just plainly ridiculous in my view.
---
Yeah i would like that. Chance to exchange some for another. I have enough minigun bullets and plasma cores which i dont know what to do with?
---
This goes double for throwing knives. 
---
Have you actually met people like this in the game? 99% of the people I have encountered have been truly awesome and helpful. A lvl 120 helped me build a really nice decked out camp when I was like level 15. I always try to help people and give them free stuff. I'm level 53 now and I've only been attacked by another player 2 times. I'm on pc though, maybe the player base is more toxic on consoles.
---
Umm....what am I supposed to do with technical data again? I usually just dump em. Didn't think they were for anything?
---
Hey, whatever you do in the privacy of your own power armour is completely up to you.
---
No, it really won't.
---
I got massively downvoted yesterday for saying this, people don't want to hear that it's not magically all fixed.
---
"DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING!"
---
"THIS SIGN MILDLY IRRITATES MOLERATS!"

Bethesda’s sweet lies are much easier to swallow than hard truths.

I am referring to weapons and items not in containers.

I don't know what level you are but once you hit level 25 go to  [Garrahan Mining HQ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Garrahan_Mining_HQ) in southern ash heap and you get a quest to build excavator power armor. It costs a ton of supplies like screws and springs and steel and black titanium but once you build it the game gets a lot easier. Also stimpaks can be pretty rare, try making healing salves instead, you should get the green thumb perk which lets you get 2 of ever plant you pick and pick a bunch of soot flower (blue flower bushes theres a bunch all over the place especially in flatwoods and surrounding areas) and bloodleaf (red ground flower that grows on the banks of streams and rivers) then you collect dirty water from a stream and make boiled water at a cooking station (2 dirty water makes 1 boiled water) then craft healing salves at cooking station (recipe takes 1 soot flower, 1 bloodleaf and 1 boiled water). Once you get the hang of it and find your own little spots with alot of plants (they always regrow in the same spots) you can easily make 50-100 healing salves in 15-20 minutes. I hope this info might be of some help to you. Have fun!
---
Well, to be fair, they didn't lie. They just said the truth in a manner that made things seem much better than they really are. As much of a pita it would have been, they should have done a wipe. Or at least open up clean servers where I can transfer my toon without any items.
---
How can i install it on my ps4?
---
Need to makes walls more intelligent, put a wall up and it's blank, add a door to it to make a door frame, or add a window to make a window frame, mix and match window/door frames with all wall types while having less in the build inventory. that way a wall can have the 5 variations wood/barn/metal/brick/steel as 1 entry
---
Thee should be a vendor that exclusively does ammo conversions. 
---
I got it yesterday, same amount
---
Normal player so you mean everyone and anyone?
---
YES THIS PLEASE!!!! It seems like everyone has more budget then me. I find camps with multiple levels, or see pictures online of huge sprawling tree mansions, but my little shack and 2 basic turrets takes up all my budget. I don't get it.
---
my school carnival didn't give out participation trophy to everyone : (
---
So weapons just lying around you mean 
---
Are you on now? I'm interested in a mutation or two.
---
Yeah.
---
literally everyone can make a mule account.

No tricks or glitches here honest. Turrets kills budgets and I've found not needed unless your spot is getting overrun often.

sadly no. just msg me gt: rcayton1 ill get back to you when i get on

Okay my bad poor word choice. They didn’t lie but to me they definitely implied those weapons armor and colas were removed. And by all the posts I’ve seen about it a lot of people believe Beth got em all. 
---
This would be great!
---
No. But if modders can do this and this version of fallout is severely limited, I'd imagine Bethesda can replicate it easily and maybe even come up with something better

Lol melee is the only viable option right now.

i pretty much only nuked my friends camps when we still played.

it is great to get help or offer it where possible,

but of course if it was not for the high level guys being there the high level ghouls would not have spawned there..

that's the verge, polygon would probably just write an article about you.

30pct. Max is at  CHR = 20. Count each rank of Hard Bargain as 3 CHR.

Lol, this guy

I run a low health character that is somewhere near 20 charisma with unyielding gear. On my low charisma character (4?), I can see a witch costume for 40 caps. On my low health character with 5 unyielding pieces at critical health they sell for 49 caps. If I take a grape mentat I can sell them for 50. 
---
Just get a bunch of 1* unyielding gear to buy plans on your main character and farm some toxic goo from West Tek so you can rad yourself on the go for purchases
---
It's a repeatable quest
---
You can turn in the TD everytime you find them for a SMALL REWARD. 
---
Yup, no over clocking the GPU. I never do that anymore; but really a requirement for me.
---
Yeah, I wonder if it’s down to their terrible 21:9 support; with additional monitors connected. I have a second 1440x2560 ( portrait mode )monitor that’s 144hz as well.
---
The very worst I’ve seen it actually crashes the GPU driver; kills the game; and then the driver recovers. That’s rare though; once a month perhaps; and I’ve tried all the drivers now from 398 to the very latest also. 
---
The game also hates G-Sync. If it’s enabled with borderleas windowed mode the game gets stuck at 25-30 FPS until I uncap the FPS; but that goes silly as well.
---
So in a sense I disabled all these great features that help and enhanced gamplay; because the game can’t use it well. Then it still crashes a lot
---
I’ve been struggling with this hahah moved it about like 5 times

Given its game code it appears to be a sub level so it may be the name for like when u load i to he silos or something, lots of places have weird sub names and locations

They see it as a game. It is. It's a game. I don't think a main concern is satisfying PC people. If the game works and you can play, I suppose they're happy with it. Nothing wrong with that but then it's us struggling. If that makes sense.

Not really my style, but cool. Would still prefer a nice sniper barrel mod with good damage tho

Don't down vote the man, this is a legit play style and he's contributing to the convo.
---
i have also found this to be true
---
No.
---
Likely also an issue due to the age of the creation engine; and the fact there’s people out there with “exotic” tech that you’ll never get 99% of the time.
---
Specially for consoles and most of gamers. 
---
It’s a damn shame they couldn’t even be bothered to get 21:9 support right. There are several modders that got it working correctly. 
---
You can actually see in the video I linked you; even the loading vault tech icon bottom right is stretched. Betshedas solution was some ini tweak that stretches the UI. Who knows how that plays with the rest of it all.

I guess any Gamma gun with deep dish and signal repeater will get the job done.

I was wondering where the wood mods were. I've got loads of assorted legendary pieces, so I could equip this mod to them or is it tied to a certain piece or legendary effect?

u can learn this by scrapping

u trippin man, just make another char. how is it unfair if you have the option to do it as well?

Sorry, but no way Bethesda does this. 1) Every purchase is more money in thier pocket. 2) Bethesda loves money 3) It bumps thier player numbers for the stock holders. 4) Bethesda loves money.
---
Kill them or log out or play F4. What is wrong with F76 players? This is second video where I see person just standing there, do nothing and then complain how he isn't able to do anything. At least this guy has turrets, but you aren't doing anything. You don't have even weapon out. And if you are low level, progress, get gear and get better- thats the beauty of online game. You get to start from being noob and become stronger.
---
You are incorrect.  People want them to be less and less boring.
---
Just read the plan and you have it forever. Congrats. 
---
Plasma core = Gatling Plasma. When you REALLY wanna melt something really quick.

I've bounced around and settled on the road right by the train station at top of the world ( my camp is also setup as a train station). Junk pile nearby for an extractor, somewhat close to water, wood, berries, vendor. There is a little camp to the south that occasionally has plans or legendaries but just out of range that they rarely attack. 
---
I would think they could have just limited the waves or put a timer on the mission or something lol.
---
I suggest finding a nice junk pile, NOT the one near Watoga, and slapping an extractor there and making it your home. You gain passive, scrapped junk and it often gives rare peices of junk (like screws and springs) fairly often. 
---
You can find the plan to learn the mod in a bunker in the mire. I think it's Ella Ame's bunker or the one right above/below it. Once learned, you can apply the mod to any wood armor piece, limb or chest. Works for legendary and non-legendary armor. It will also increases resistances when applied, but still nowhere near other baseline armors.
---
I see how you mean that. Anyway, I've tried to already explain that the engine is fine. What you do with it is another thing. Haha
---
They need to look into it and fix it. Even if us Mod Authors had the CK for FO76, we couldn't change things in their .exe. 
---
Resolution settings and what-not is in the finally package. Plus, the CK they've released in the past wasn't the same they used. Couple of missing features and dulled down number of settings. Not complaining but I'm just saying in case you're interested.
---
Pmed you on Xbox a while ago, no reply tho?
---
anti-armor does not apply to rad damage. Only it's ballistic damage. Same with bloodied. They're great to collect and trade though. People will make their assumptions about it, just like an explosive tesla rifle.
---
For me it depended on the RP sorry I had created for my character. Which to summaries is a stealth infiltrator. Who crashed his vertibird and lost all his comrades. When I found a crashed vertibird complete with skeletons of dead soldiers it was the moment I said this is the one for me. 
---
So that’s one way to select. Or you can go for aesthetics, having a great view. Or somewhere unique and different. Or practical and close to the main areas and or resources. 
---
Sorry this is probably not really helping. But I think it should help you narrow down what you want from the locations.
---
What I can say is this. Stay away from Whitespring. Don’t even think about building there or near it unless you want your base destroyed daily. Also stay away from roads as they are used by griefers to locate peoples camps.
---
Hope this helps. 
---
not on right now
---
The server seems more stable, but somehow my performance got lot worse, and i don't know why. Did anyone else experienced the same thing? Honest question.
---
Where do you find many Marine armor parts then?
---
Because he likes to whine and then jump on others for having an idea. You see, only he can have a complaint about this game. He's the only one.

you dont. make them and scrap

Because you like to whine and then jump on others for having an idea. You see, only you can have a complaint about this game. You're the only one. 
---
I think quad would be best. It'd be nice to get limb damage and reload speed on top, but this is one of those legendaries where one star kinda makes it worthwhile. 
---
And there's really nothing you can do for hazmat suits and PA. It is really great to use against characters that use unyielding builds at half/low health. They usually can't remove rads fast enough and they respawn at something like 30% health.
---
::highfive:: I'm with you on this
---
I suppose. It just grinds my gears that I HAVE the loot worth 10k and no one to sell it to because any player has the same loot, or not enough caps or are too low level to use it or any higher level user has better gear, or it is junk loot anyway like another 3* walking stick.
---
I played GTA Online at release and for a while after heists were released. Maybe it is the fond memories of the past but I don't recall *grinding * for so long to buy the top of the line house and a bunch of cars. (note like I said it has been a while)  I do remember playing a fun game and getting rewards. Something which FO76 does not feel like. 
---
Can you move your camp without having to make a blueprint or do you lose your home if you move without blueprinting first? 
---
I think they should re-buff the damage but re-vert the VATs accuracy to shit like it was before. Two shot is great, but not being able to charge crits would make it a huge trade off. Not to mention a two-shot with +50% crit damage would be a shitty drop, and that's funny to me
---
Use your treasure maps (it's better to wait until lvl 50). There's a good chance to get plans in the loot.
---
Only replying to say that you have an awesome gametag. Carry on.
---
Not really, and I'm not seeing anything significantly different in terms of server stability. I still get "server not responding" messages
---
Not placing it down his your pit boy. Go top the camp in camp mode and pick it up like any other items.  It will allow you to reposition in case you placed it somewhere awkward. 
---
Yeah that’s the issue wit h their 21:9 support. Just a nasty stretch. 
---
Considering I can run Fallout 4 fine, and cranked out over 300 hours with my current setup.
---
Clearly something they changed in the engine or game has broken something for some setups.
---
Considering the crashing got worse since their last major update; it might have been something in there.
---
Fingers crossed the next update brings some relief.
---
/r/murderedbywords
---
If it's anything like other legendary weapons, the damage increase only applies to it's main damage effect. So it probably won't increase rad damage with each consecutive hit. I've also heard it only stacks to 30% extra damage.
---
lol :D
---
Wow. Just wow. So he's crying because a bunch of fucking assholes come in and try to purposefully ruin his gameplay experience? People like you are why people don't play this game. Not everyone has the time to go farm out ALL the materials to rebuild their base daily when people destroy it. 
---
Not really. My stealth VATs crit builds swat scorchbeasts like they're nothing and steal everyone's adrenaline stacks at the SBQ fights.
---
The nerfed it because they thought people farmed it for experience, but there's really not enough waves to make it worthwhile. When they included it in the changelog it read like a solution in search of a problem.
---
I agree as well. It's like saying, if you don't want people to destroy your base and everything you worked hard for it, don't bother using the public workshops feature. Well, that's like half the fucking game. What the hell? That's like literally how you get materials &amp; salvage
---
If you leave it open for anyone to harvest, it makes people wanted if they take anything....
---
I'm here too, top of the world Concourse has loads of items like mini guns and sell. Its central for fast travel. It's close to white springs as well. I have tried to find a better place and can't. It has EVERYthing I need. I got purified water for drinking and stimpacks as well as the river for boiled water for soups etc.
---
I would actually like to see a retexture or two of the minuteman outfit, it was very basic and suited my style perfectly.
---
spec for damage and armor penetration and you'll be fine. I've taken a level 16 character through there with no armor and a really nice shotgun before.
---
Hi there :)
---
Do you have the Ultracite PA "Motion assist servos" plan for sale ? i got it in a drop on my pc account, but never got it on the Xbox (my main character)..
---
Got the sunday grill cookout daily event to repeat continuously on a server. Earned 2800 caps just selling radstag (and bear) meat, and still had leftovers that expired.
---
not sure 
---
"Red is the color of communism and I hate it"
---
nice if you can check, gives 10 more in carrie wight :)
---
Unfortunately, the only way to check who is available to do PvP is by shooting them. So, because of that, people shoot you to see if it's possible to fight you. If you don't want to fight, don't take over workshops and don't turn pacifist mode off.
---
I'm confused. How is an unfair when everyone can use this method? I think I see what your getting at with 1 person owning 2 accounts but even a person that owns 1 account can still store stuff on another character via someone trustworthy. Even so its such a clunky/costly method that I dont even see the worth of doing it.
---
So pipe down before Bethesda ties are stash to all our characters. God knows theyll do it.
---
Probably because if you wielded in one hand in first person it would go off the screen and you wouldn't see your weapon. Just a thought.
---
no problem, just let me know if you have it :)
---
If you have dodgy, serendipity, and the right armor you can be quite tanky at 20% health, but it's not something to try below 50% if you're going to do PvP
---
I'm fairly certain literally anyone can open it without the code just by activating the switch. 
---
That a very impressive, where do you have it connected to the floor I can't see...
---
Couldn't get out of my PA, teammates invisible, then I got stuck in cloaked form, lag, extremely long load times, black screen, blue screen, and disconnected and that was just last night.
---
Oh and the great "duping purge" that didn't really do anything since people are still selling in groups and on Ebay. 
---
Yeah everything is running really grest....
---
This
---
I would like to have double sided walls for building interiors. I love the brick walls, but they're not great for interior walls since most of the wall decorations glitch on the bricks. 
---
Yes, exactly. I strongly suggest you report it to them. The more people, the more likely it is they'll see it. I think the team working on the game right now is pretty good. They're interacting way more with us than they did in the past. That's for sure. Still a couple of issues, but welp.
---
Nope. It still bulges on the brick set sadly.
---
I’ll add to this and ask for some way to view what ammo is for what guns as well. “Just remember?”  I can never remember which bullet type goes to my sniper. I. Just. Can’t. 
---
My take: build a shitty easy to place camp. Move it to newer better spot when found. If after a long time you are still ok with it then build something nice!
---
This guy bools. 
---
Unfair advantage? Literally anyone can do it, there's nothing stopping you. I like how anyone who doesn't agree with you is a snowflake, looks like you are.
---
Ahhh great plan I think I'll do that after lunch and chores
---
Wholesome, I wish I saw this earlier 
---
Moving your camp places everything as a blueprint automatically.   But it is difficult to properly place large blueprints.  You always get “intersecting existing objects” and “object is floating” errors.
---
They aren't assholes, they are doing what game is designed to do. People like you are why this game sucks. Because Beth knew if they make more exiting and more challenging people like you would cry and as we can see, you are already crying, even after all these water down on PVP. If you don't have time to be on par with other player and want to play alone in your phase, then there is something called Fallout 4 that you can play alone in your phase.
---
Yeah this is fucking great and I love it
---
Hmm.   Don't mind if I do...
---
I had it a couple of times, but it worked after switching weapons or opening my pipboiii
---
yep same
---
When you do any action that drains AP (running, overencumbered, VATS, jumping, punching) it drains the fusion core faster. When I used the full stack Full Charge perk, it slows down the drain by a lot. It might be a glitch and get patched, I hope it helps you in some way 
---
Even without rad damage benefiting from anti-armor, it's still a solid effect. I'd happily take a 3* one, for shiggles.
---
You missed to state that a load of bugs have been fixed. Since early December it is a major improvement ATM.
---
Then why doesn't everyone do this? If this is the way the game is supposed to be played, why don't we all go out of our way to destroy people's stuff? That's how dumb your argument is. no one likes this aspect of the game except the people who are stupid enough to go and grief people like this and destroy their stuff. No one wants that. Everyone has been asking for PVE servers or specifically PVP servers. 
---
love this
---
I did it a couple of times with my gf. But it would be pretty easy to solo. Though more fun with more people because of more enemies 
---
I got them from defending a workshop
---
be nice to have description in the sales screen of plans and mods telling you what they do, save me having to google what this or that mod does
---
It's like you are both ignoring the fact that workshops are meant for pvp.
---
If you don't want to risk PvP then don't claim a workshop, it's not fucking hard. 
---
They have the same parent company -_-
---
i don't even get the 21:9 option, 
---
yes i spanned my displays before starting the game.
---
All I want are plans and fusion cores not worth my time/mats to build defenses.
---
Hopefully this time I wont get that automated message to the support site. 
---
How much for just stable violet flux? 
---
What quest? This is not a useful post.
---
??Where in the post does it say i sell flux.
---
Was just wondering if you sold flux 
---
I run a melee+pistol build. It's a bit more compatible since you want a lot in agility if you're melee since you'll be sprinting towards enemies. With rifles+melee you have to give up a lot of useful stuff. Melee usually wants strength and agility at max, maybe luck at half stack. Rifles usually want perception and luck at max, maybe with agility at half stack. You have to make too many compromises to make it somewhat viable. 
---
I'd personally take fireproof down to 2. Unless you're running an unyielding/low health melee/rifleman build, there's zero reason to have radicool. This gives you 2 points to flex over into another special stat. You could even go down to one in fireproof if you have a dense armor chest mod. You def need some points in tank killer in perception, and at least one in concentrated fire so you can take headshots and stack your accuracy. You could probably draw charisma down to 1 just to keep strange in numbers, but maybe 2 if you really want to swap in inspirational/tenderizer/suppressor. I'd completely skip out on dodgy. It's going to rob you of AP you need to sprint to something you need to melee or kill your ability to use VATs.
---
You probably want 1 more point into sneak. You can afford to run adrenaline at 3 points and have decent damage buff. I'd personally make the trade off between demo expert and covert operative. Every additional point into demo expert is 10%, whereas every point into covert operative is 15%. It's worth taking if you have 2 levels into sneak. Sandman is way too situational to bother, so I'd cull that.
---
Even with all these changed out, I'd imagine you'd have a consistent problem with weapon durability, armor durability, and carry weight in general (rifles are heavy af). You have nothing into gunsmith/makeshift warrior/luck of the draw and tbh this build doesn't really allow much for it. Really the only thing you can do is throw player resources at it, and your stash is probably going to be really full because you can't afford to carry excess chems/food/drink on your character because they have no weight reduction perks. This character would constantly have to be fed supplies from friends/farming characters that don't have to make as many trade offs. You might be able to get by with 5 pieces of armor that reduce weapon weight and/or aid weight - likely favoring aid weight. Otherwise, the main way to make it work is to run low health with unyielding armor. That'd give you carry weight from strength, accuracy from perception, and an incredible AP pool to place headshots. 
---
nope. sorry
---
I did the same thing. Got sick of super mutants take always destroying my tatos!

It tells you on every single gun...

It hits lighter than a 10mm pistol on the ballistic damage side. You're only going to get 25 damage that still has to pass through 50% armor. It's a wasted effect and you won't see much difference from a non-legendary gamma gun. It's a utility weapon. For something like that, suppressors, two shot (not sure on this one), or quad would seem to be the better fit. 
---
Y'all need to give up on these X01 mods. You can buy the T51 jetpack plan from the BoS vendor any time and it has better resistances for the stuff you actually fight. 
---
ditto
---
If you deep dish and electric antenna mod it, I believe the ballistic is higher than that. I know for sure the energy is, and it gains a charged damage effect. That's a question, though, does AA apply to energy damage on dual damage type guns, like the plasma or gamma?
---
You could always check before, and make that a habit. 
---
You need a “friend” to hold the items from one character to get items to a second character. 
---
If you are doing a complete respect it might be fast via a new character as you progress through the low levels pretty fast. 
---
Just 1 bit of advice. Make yourself some good low leveled weapons and armor to give your new character. 
---
all food items should drop empty containers,

My current camp is a floating spaceship. Due to what elements I had to build it with, its rather bulky. If junk walls were a thing, I'd totally rebuild the whole thing from scratch (and I spent hours glitching all the walls to look acceptable), just so it would indoubtedly be single thing I wanted the most: rocket powered floating trash heap to drop my junk into so it stays safe
---
They have it in Skyrim with bookcases.
---
Wow, unfair advantage. That’s a new low here.
---
Can you please elaborate which exactly?
---
I have thebwork veil. 
---
So a player purcheses a second acount, gives Bethesda money helping with the cost of the servers for a mule with a stash limit that won't even affect server performance since he logs off with it and you want it banned? Why not suggest they ban people who buy stuff from Atom Shop while your at it since you want them to punish people that play fair and support Bethesda with extra money without duping and cheats.
---
You probably want deep dish and signal repeater. For that, you lose ballistic and energy, but still get 125-150 rad damage. AFAIK, anti-armor is really limited in its capacity and what it applies to. For example, if you have an anti-armor explosive handmade the ballistics get 50% armor pen, but the explosives need to pass through armor and do not benefit. Anti-armor has a really narrow vein it benefits. It's either intentional or broken, but generally you should just try to test these on friends in PvP to check your assumptions
---
I picked my location based on four factors: Within 10 caps of Whitesprings and Harpers, the divide sees less scorchbeast activity than the mire or bog, and I found a water source that just so happened to flow in a T-Shape between two small cliffs, so I could incorporate interesting natural features into the architecture. My camp spans the gap between the cliffs, with a small bridge crossing the other side of the T as well. :D
---
it looks like you are both ignoring the fact that players want a PVP server so they don't have to participate in this dumb shit. It's not fucking hard
---
Unfortunately, that thing is often the gatling plasma
---
Yeah, the suppressor takes a while to unlock, last mod i unlocked after a long while of scrapping...just dont give up
---
I have one for you:
---
"BLOCK the BELLYACHER"
---
Thank god, I killed a mile rat in a guys camp, and I got mowed down by his turrets and lost my loot. But this was a while back.
---
Thanks! Does it matter i scprap 35 or 45 lvl Gauss?
---
No, lvl 35 is better as they take less mats to make. Id recommend crafting alot, and taking some berry mentats before you scrap to boost your intellegence
---
Get super duper perk
---
CAN make it? Absolutely, not very complicated.
---
WILL make it? lol, no.
---
I missed the blackbird paint and I'm hoping it comes back soon. 
---
I said the same thing when it came to the known plans mod, but then Bethesda got around to it, so I'm going to be cautiously optimistic. Still gonna run the mod until they unfuck themselves
---
Whatever dude. People like you have ruined this game. It wasn’t all supposed to be sunshine and friendship. That along with Beth’s lack of support. 
---
So would a furious the dragon be good? Or not worth the effort?
---
Also it triggers defend events. All good for caps.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha no
---
Pshhh...minor detail :P
---
Sorry, but each server hop you take the other plans? Sometimes i take one and server hop but never seen again idk
---
Who is Beth and what does she have to do with ammo? (I feel I need to clarify this is a joke before someone feels the need to correct me)
---
Being able to breakdown other ammo types for raw materials would be fantastic. Or even just being able to sell ammo to vendors would be better to. Why they've limited it I dotm understand.
---
I was just thinking the last patch did the most for  “server stability” to date. Once last night the “server not responding” pop up appeared and I started packing up... but the server didn’t crash. Hasn’t for me since the patch (XB1).
---
that is the name of the drug to create super mutants.  not sure what it stands for, sorry.
---
great job, starting to print it now :)
---
what is the difference between base 1 &amp; 2? they look very similar.
---
No huge point
---
I honestly desperately want “wallpaper” so bad.
---
We already have a bunch of different floors for God’s sake.
---
Very doubtful
---
I chose mine because it's a unique location so not likely to get griefed, nice view, proximity to Watoga for farming lead/steel off robots plus near Whitespring for, well, Whitespring. It's a bit precarious due to truly shitty, high level enemies that spawn nearby (Mirelurk Queens, mostly) but it's a good source of meat/XP. Oh, and no Scorchbeasts unlike my last place just outside of Watoga.
---
A junk extractor would be nice but I'm fine without one and just a simple small water purifier.
---
I only do it for plans. Defending isn‘t worth my time. Especially when scorchbeasts are attacking. Costs more than i get out of it.
---
Next time you claim a workshop and you get that pop up telling you it'll be 25 caps, read it in its entirety.  Yes, something you did 20+ minutes prior means you can be instantly killed.
---
Makes sense, shame if true.
---
Is this J. D. Salinger’s new TV show?
---
This looks cool. The stove with smoke is so good. I'm loving seeing people's more creative builds on here. 
---
Love is love. Don't yuck their yum!
---
I had this happen to me. Same location. One day my camp wouldn't load anymore. The only thing I had done different was I had moved the camp assembly (the assembly not the boundary) to a spot where a bulldozed rock kept re-appearing. My theory is that on reload the rock would have clipped through the camp, so the game didn't allow it. 
---
How do you change the way they look?
---
It's a good start but they still arent getting me to come back until the TSE weapons are gone! They're just too fucking OP and should never have been in an online game like this from the first place! Getting rid of all the duped items in the recent update (or so they claim) is a good step in the right direction but the game will never be balanced again as long as those weapons exist! I had a friend with a TSE handmade who I had to stop playing with because it was all he used and I essentially just watched him play as before I could even look at an enemy he'd have killed/one shot everything in sight. Now I can already hear the fuckboys that love their TSEs crying because they dont want to lose their precious OP weapon but here's a perfect example of just how OP they are. Scorch beast queens... when you get the initial quest to drop a nuke and it says to do a fissure prime site (take on a queen) it recommends having at least 8-12+ players... yeah my mate with the TSE could solo a queen without healing once and did this 3 times a day... tell me how a weapon that let's you do as much damage as a dozen+ players working in unison is fair or balanced in an online game with a pvp element? Because it isnt and Bethesda were stupid letting it in from the beginning!
---
Thanks for all your comments! All of your Camps sound lovely.
---
Agreed
---
Honest opinion. First thing i noticed was the nose. It seemed like the cartilage was shrinking, but it should actually be getting a bit bigger/longer as she aged.
---
Reclamation Day! *is* a participation trophy that everyone gets so the entire foundation for your argument falls away like your dating prospects on Saturday night.  
---
You'll be able to get an increased cap total per day(2800 caps). You could then use a friend to trade between both characters so your main could get OP weapons, plans, and recipes quicker. They also might have us make a new character for the pvp game modes which will be coming next month(Though that's speculation due to the backlash they received from revealing that we would be able to transfer between pve and pvp game modes).
---
Me too! I haven't built anything more than a sleeping big, a campfire and a stash box. I just can't choose! 
---
Yeah, 3v1 as a level 25 would've been so fun. There's nothing wrong with F76 players. We only ask what we can do about it because logic is all you have as a new player and what would you expect in that scenario? I honestly wasn't even panicking, I just knew it wouldn't be smart to attack them and give them the added pleasure of killing me too. I'm not even complaining but you're quick to assume so for some odd reason.
---
Honestly, if you ain't got anything that's well thought out inside your head to say then just downvote and move on.
---
Wow, too soon, I had a sister that lived there :(
---
You're fired. Get out.
---
How does a man like that go home and have sex with his wife?
---
Legendary customizable protest signs.
---
Depends, if people are walking around with a bloodied build I'd recommend an executioners gamma gun
---
Bloodied builds keep their health low by substituting it with radiation to keep it below 25%, executioner deals 50% more dmg to enemies who's health is below 30-40%.
---
Give the gamma gun a deep dish and your dealing 125 radiation dmg, if you especially lucky to find a 2star gamma try and find one with executioner and extra 10% dmg whilst aiming 
---
Why did you let them know where you live by respawning at camp? Why are you crying about an intended part of game(PVP workshops). Why do you sound like an entitled cry baby millennial?
---
Note to self:  sell my bloodied gamma gun before people realize the prefix is not particularly important for such weapons.  
---
You got moxy kid, I'll give you that.
---
Drop F Bombs not N Bombs!
---
Thumbs Up to Dismantle Rose!
---
NI!
---
Genuinely thought you typo'd rant lol..
---
Whats with the snowflake usage last 2 years?
---
If the door isn't the poop hole....il be disappointed 
---
This looks amazing!
---
I imagine a basic word filter would be necessary
---
Lmao. They are far from OP now.
---
u on xbox? i have all of them
---
Not a lot of games enforce their TOS that way. I don't see Bethesda taking that stance if PC can have mild mods with no issue. 
---
Would it be possible to fix the heavy weapons bug, where it does not do damage in the next patch?
---
Specifically it shows damage, but then the enemy regains the exact health back instantly.
---
When that happens the only weapons that seem to work are melee unless you log off and back on.
---
It really hurts gameplay when you drop a nuke and have to leave the server without being able to kill the queen.
---
Thank you,
---
BECAUSE THEY'RE BUSY SPRINGING INTO GEAR!
---
So i logged on and made the changes you suggested and it definitely seems t9 run smoother but i still get these random lockups where the game just stops for a second or 3. Is this server side or is there something i can do for it?
---
Don't request it here.
---
Do the smart thing And submit it directly via the Bethesda support page.
---
Really? When were they nerfed? I stopped playing about a month and a half ago now and have been keeping an eye out for any news on them but haven't seen anything regarding then being made either manageable or just being removed?
---
NUKA CRAN, WE NEED IT
---
I always drop them near vendor container.  Suitcase in Watoga, Food container in Enclave Entrance, Overseer / Flatwoods container. It's too much hassle to find low lvl, fast travel to them just to just give them recipe / plans imo.
---
Hmm no
---
Just level up and use the method provided. 
---
Or make a new character
---
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!
---
How did you do the expression of the mouth?
---
they were nerfed fairly recently. I want to say end of January? it's now reliably faster for me to melee mobs than shoot them with my tse double-barrel. Sheet damage was reduced to a just over third of what it was (from high 600s to 238).
---
I'm sure they had two shot damage nerfed. My TSE gauss rifle went from like 371 damage to like 295. And thats with stuff like rifleman perk on and Tank killer to buff damage (doesn't show on stats).
---
They are far weaker now, still strong but aren't breaking the game. But the dupe change thing is sooo nice. 
---
Oh I never have to check, I'm always low on shotgun shells.
---
Go to the mine where you nuke to get the scorched queen to span,and the end of the mine there is a bos body that has one piece of bos heavy combat armor on it,I belive you can get one part a day I've been doing this and so far I've got the chest and a leg.
---
Two shot effect was reduced from +100% damage to +25%. Explosive effect was reduced from +100% to +20%. Demolition expert perk was reduced from capping at +100% to all explosive damage to +60%. This was all in the last big patch, around the end of January.
---
Same I lunches two nukes and got to 190 yesterday.
---
Gen I realized I was bored af and watched Netflix lol 
---
Hello, that's something I've covered in the video I made.
---
You can't really do much about that. It's either the server or the "new" "old" way the game is handling cells.
---
You're the player but the environment is divided in big squares. When you move, the ones behind you are unloaded and the ones ahead of you are loaded.
---
That's what's going on. There's more to it but I think this should give you an answer. This would explain the hiccups.
---
Really you only need to level up a max of 15 more times for a full on play style respec. If you just want to change a few flavor perks around then reallocating points as you level up doesn't harm your game play. The current system is great and stops cookie cutter flavor of the patch builds on 90% of people.
---
Not trying to hate on the game but it's just too tedious for me without a true respec. Oh well, hope you guys enjoy the wasteland. 
---
Once you're high level it takes too long for me and I don't want to start a new character and run through all the same stuff again. Not hating on the game, just can't bring myself to level another toon. 
---
This would be so helpful.
---
Wow! That is seriously great to hear! I must have just not read the patch notes that week or something as I have been keeping up to date as much as I can! I love Fallout! And I've ALWAYS wanted a Fallout game to be online! And I remember when 76 first launched it had its issues but I thought it was a great game! Then the duping glitches happened and nuking zones just became pointless as I'd literally get nothing out of launching one as there was always someone with a TSE soaking up all the kills before I could get involved whether it was a random or one of my friends I was literally playing to watch people and it just got too boring! I'll tell you what they are THIS close to getting me back! I've done every quest so will wait for more quests (which I know are coming i read that yesterday) but considering that was my biggest problem (and I know I'm clearly against these guns being in the game atall but it wasnt even so much that they were in the game it's that people were duping them every other person was buying them and I'm sorry but I refuse to pay money for a weapon just to be on a fair/level playing field in an online game that's just wrong to me) well... good job guys! 
---
Mang, i respecced from ranged to melee in my 120's, doesn't take very long if you do events
---
A small icon before the name to indicate unread would be helpful. I've done everything I need to for completing the Overseer's mission but it has not been marked completed. I suspect it is due to a holotape I have not played. Unless of course it is not meant to be completed because of a future DLC they have planned.
---
Thats what drains my cores so quickly
---
Happens every time I get in PA, so no PA for me 
---
Pop into whitesprings resort. They sell at least 6 varieties of nukacola from my memory of the place. 
---
Plot Twist: She’s 28.
---
I gave up and found someone to mod it for me.  What platform are you on?
---
Make a text post (like you did with this one) and paste the links into the text box. Ezpz. 
---
It's a shame people on imgur downvote fo76 just because it's fo76.
---
You also realize sbq scales to how many people are around right? And that its still possible to solo her without tse weps right? Just like how people solo stuff in ark or people solo raids in WoW; maybe people are better than you
---
JFC this whole reddit is either filled with people who whine about shit they want removed or shit that's been removed.
---
Like you base your argument on something that was already fucking nerfed and is all over the forums and multiple gaming publications. Sit there saying "you wont come back" so now that its fixed are you gonna actually play or just find something else to complain about?
---
I am sure if you had a tse gun everyone else would be a fuckboy because your gun got nerfed; go adventure in WV and stop bitching.
---
If there is nothing wrong with you, then why are you complaining? I don't see Rust playing complaining for getting attack and there you lose everything on death, while here you lose close to nothing. 
---
If it was so smart move not to do anything, why even then ask: How do you even combat this? 
---
I haven't really felt the love for any of the "unique" guns in the FO 3D games. I have played with a couple. The Alien Blaster, the Anti Material rifle, the Patriot, All Rise in 76 and maybe  one or two others but nothing I really wet myself over getting. I think the FO76 random legendary weapon system is quite OK.
---
I mean I don't need ANOTHER 3* walking stick but the idea behind the system is OK. 
---
"do the smart thing?"  you come here and fucking insult me?  lmfao@u
---
almost every one and their goddamn mother comes here a requests things.  then YOU come along.  go back under your rock where you belong.
---
I agree there should be a cap as I can farm fort defiance each time I server hop and come out with a little over 1k in straight jackets each time.  At least the cap gives me a reason to leave fort defiance alone now and then.
---
I have that same camp. I built multiple camps over that spot trying to cover the junk pile over, so it would be inside my house.  I think the problem is that sometimes on login the junk pile resource extractor rotates on the pile.  Somehow when it rotates it hits up against already placed buildings and the game nopes the whole camp.  I had to rebuild my camp at least 20 times before I finally built a slightly lifted house and didn't cover the junk pile.   The camp has been steady for about 2 months, but my problem now is that I had 3 turrets on my house and from server hopping they disappeared.  Like the power cables were still there but they are hanging in the sky not connected to anything.  I now have to place my camp again because the invisible turrets are taking up my budget.  I also tried repairing my camp, but they never returned.
---
hassles do not bother me.  retired and bored.  it is just some thing to do.
---
If someone isn't participating in PVP who cares if he can't be harmed in PVP? How, exactly, does this "change the game"?
---
Jfc yes
---
It's not VATS. Fusion cores are drained by any action that uses AP: Sprinting, Melee power attacks, even jumping. It's a built in drawback for using power armor and it's to balance the insane defense it gives you.
---
If you want to play a highly mobile, vats heavy character you should consider not using power armor. Regular armor has many amazing benefits such as legendary mods that increase special stats , you can't get that in power armor.
---
Anyway, it's not even hard to play with a power armor vats build you can just take a nuclear plant when you log in, and fast travel there for free every 30 mins to get free cores. 
---
I'm kind of in a holding pattern at the moment.  No longer logging in daily, but I pop in if I have 20 minutes to kill and check the challenges.  Knock out the simple-ish ones and log off.  Friends are more or less doing the same while they wait for (non-pvp) content.
---
Not really mad I guess - I think I've got 300 hours logged so that's more than earned its value.  Just definitely waiting for...something.  I also feel like they need to have the dust settle on balancing.  I was very disappointed about the VATS crit nerfs while energy weapons are just so...bleh.  Have no idea what the guy who prioritizes this stuff's problem is.  Reminds me of an acquaintance who was designing an RPG game that emphasized perma-death and punishing characters.  Why on earth would that be your design philosophy?  Make stuff that's fun if you want people to play....
---
I have given up on turrets take up too much room
---
A man of culture as well
---
Yes!
---
XD you do realise if it's submitted officially On Their System.  They are more likely to take notice. Funny as one of my ideas submitted officially is under consideration... I suggest you take the hint and submit it on their site. 
---
Just because everyone else requests here doesn't mean it's noticed. 
---
If you have an official ticket. It's passed on. 
---
This is reddit... not their official forums or support ticket system.  So yes
---
Do The Smart Thing
---
Submit it properly. 
---
Yeah, not into that
---
Are you using PA HUD?
---
Ahh thanks man!
---
Na fam game had its chance. F076 can die in a pit.
---
Yes, it's based on a ratio of damage dealt vs armor,
---
1:1 gives 50% reduction
---
1:2 gives 61%
---
1:5 gives 72%
---
1:10 gives 78%
---
1:100 gives 91%
---
2:1 gives 36%
---
5:1 gives 10%
---
\~7:1 and less gives a flat 1%
---
This means big armor is more effective at negating small attacks than large ones, as more damaging attacks need dramatically more armor to reduce their effectiveness. Armor piercing reduces damage resistance, but not energy, making it so you can more easily reach the positive ratios where your weapon damage is more than the value of the armor.
---
as every enemy in the game has more than 100 armor, you want weapons dealing closer to 150 with the highest dps, if you have 50% armor piercing the amount of armor drops by half, meaning you only need 75 damage to reach the critical threshold.
---
Armor piercing stacks multiplicatively, so 50% and 50% do not negate all armor, only 75% (50 + 50% of 50). 40% armor piercing by itself is equal to a 20% damage bonus until you start to reach into the very high weapon damage ratios.
---
DO..........NOT...........CARE
---
I have a shielded knight under armour. I would like 1000 for it but I'm at work for the next 9 hours. IGN Wastingsometime if you want it.
---
I'll submit your idea then
---
I'll get the credit
---
Cheers!
---
I do have 1000 caps but I don't need the upgrade on it (:
---
I stuff all my read things into my stashbox that I'm not actively pursuing or quest related just to cut down the sheer amount to sift thru looking for unread things i pick up. Helps, but would love an unread flag, too!
---
Ans just fyi. You look really thick replying to constructive criticism. 
---
I suggested you go official. But i guess that's too smart am idea for you!
---
Have a good day!
---
I'm in the crowd of those who cap them just for the plans. It's usually very little effort and the plans cost a lot more to buy than to take over the shop. When I start getting more duplicate plans than new ones, I won't bother.
---
I have a Nuka Cola resippy from the official cookbook. Haven't been able to get my hands on ingredients to make the syrup. I tried the Quartz and Nuka Cherry recipes, but I didn't want to wait for the ingredients to turn into syrup. Pretty good! 
---
A Quartz is actually just an old soda fountain recipe for what they called a White Cow, which is just vanilla extract,  vanilla beans, and then mixed with heavy cream and seltzer water.
---
The Nuka Cherry was good too, you were meant to mix it with the Nuka Cola syrup but good on its own as a beverage. Just cherries, sugar, grenadine, and seltzer water.
---
The Nuka Cola itself has some definitely different ingredients, but in reviews I heard it described as like a Holiday Coke that you would drink during Christmas or something
---
Nope, not really.
---
Minus trying a completely new stat load out, you can change whatever perk you want whenever you want to suit whatever your need is. Neat but ultimately boring as there are no unique builds running around.
---
From what I hear max discount is between 20%
---
armor piercing only effects armor, full stop.
---
energy resist, rad resist, poison resist, damage resist (med-x and similar), and explosive resist are not armor, so armor piercing doesn't work on them.
---
Armor piercing on anything that doesn't deal normal bullet/melee damage does not benefit at all from armor piercing.
---
No, Narwhal. 
---
I throw all that shit on the ground at white spring when going though my stash.
---
There's like 2 notes worth keeping ("I o u 1 beer","i o u tp") but apart from that there are two till i tapes that have additional functionality over than just playing stuff so it makes the other ones worthless.
---
Hey, pay attention. He was talking about tech data, not treasure maps.  
---
I had a buddy drop a bunch of 1 or 2 star legendary weapons for me to sort through. As I was looking some random came up and grabbed it all. It was mostly worthless stuff so neither cared too much but just a douchey thing to do lol
---
Ants are the same, they never let go. I once made the mistake of ignoring them because I am clad in power armor and they are –you know– ants, then the next thing I know, I'm on my knees begging for help...
---
I agree all the little pests should be highly territorial and be fine with you leaving the premises, but then why should we expect AI from pests?
---
You know there is this thing in FO76 called "Photo Mode"...
---
I got it somewhere. I have no idea where.
---
(This happens a lot)
---
They must have been really ticked off.
---
It's not a perfect system, could be improved.
---
Doesn't mean it's a bad idea to use something similar for the people who just want to play some fallout (with or without friends)
---
A++ comment. Thanks for sharing. 
---
Well I have that in my inventory if you want it. if you want a regular one I can just craft it for you but if it requires ballistic fiber I would need that because I'm out.
---
I wish I could get stalked by ticks. I need those blood sacs...
---
Okay
---
Have you tried Flight Helmet + Surgical Mask?  Or Medical Goggles + Surgical Mask?
---
Leveling someone's base isn't PVP. No matter what.
---
Player versus player means exactly that. Come kill me and put your own workshop up. Not a problem. If I want to keep the workshop I'll fight you for it until what? One of us gets bored and gives up I suppose.
---
Travelling to a person and leveling their base and even killing them repeatedly without actually trying to take the workshop is griefing. 
---
I'm a relatively new player (level20 now) and a filthy casual too ;)  will add you!
---
Personally I don't think it's going to help much.  It'll be active enough on release but I think people will get bored of everybody being a hunter and move back to the sketchy pvp mechanics of the "regular" game.
---
Really should make strict PVP and strict PVE and be done with it.  
---
Not questioning the decision, just new to reddit.  Why? 
---
Again with the putting words in my mouth. 
---
I never complained. Why can't I ask what I can do? I've never PVP'd in this game before so why can't I ask? This is the fo76 sub for fuck's sake. I never said doing nothing was smart, again- putting words in my mouth. Jesus, did you not read my post? I even thought it was funny while watching.
---
Why can't I ask for tips? If all you can say is "HuR dUr gO pLaY fAlLoUt 4 hUrDuR oR gIt gUd" then you're just being an elitist asshole. 
---
I had a similar setup in one of my CAMPS but I constantly had enemies spawning inside. I decided to build a new CAMP where I had an attached shed that was separated by a door to limit enemies in my main base. 
---
Still tons of enemies spawning inside. I hope they fix it at some point because I hate having to destroy/replant my crops every time I fast travel. 
---
Suit yourself. A jet pack bought for 500 can sell for up to 2k.
---
Rad-x or rad worms?
---
You can get a bonus 6 from being in a party of four with the +2 Char per party member other than you. +2 from the mothman egg omelette. +5 from Grape Mentants, as well as armor that gives +1 charisma per piece. So you can get 6+2+5+5=17 additional charisma. You can also check out fo76market and fo76 bazaar to trade for plans with players. It'll be cheaper than a vendor even with maxed Charisma, though you might trade with a duper. 
---
There's a billboard for Nuka Cranberry near Watoga too. When I saw it, I was like...Yes!  
---
I always loved collecting the Nuka Colas in Fo4. I really do hope we get the workshop items to make them.
---
I was kinda sad when the game started and I found the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant...and there wasn't much cola there. T\^T   
---
That is awesome!
---
LOL this what I immediately thought of. Man do they find some hustle when they're mad. Zzzzooooooommmm! I'm In YoUr FaCe!
---
Yes, pleease! Also let us show how much junk we have when collecting junk!
---
Would have been nice if they made a PVE option for taking workshops.  It's interesting enough defending them and taking them from the AI without the PVP part.
---
Make it so if you fail the defense event you lose control of the workshop.  They'll churn plenty fast enough.
---
I would LOVE this!
---
I don't think I've found a Flight Helmet or Medical Goggles yet. 
---
Where are they located? 😯
---
Rad worms, but that's when I froze, I went into my pipboy as I was going to use a disease cure.
---
I know gun runners in NV had like 25-32k caps for sells.  I get the idea of a limit but 200 caps is pretty small.  Like any increase, even just to 250 caps will help us out in terms of fluidity, it's annoying when you begin picking and choosing legendaries cause they've begun to pile up in your inventory.  I wouldn't mind 500 caps as a max limit for a few more hidden/rare vendors and wandering ones like Grahm should have 1k just for their rarity factor, it's a reward stumbling upon Grahm and if you're lucky enough to find him near a station or red rocket with a stash box, should totally be a worthwhile encounter especially since he walks so damn fast.
---
LifeInAnalog on PC..level 28 and sometimes struggling out there (as it should be perhaps)..
---
..is there a required uniform? a duster and cowboy hat perhaps? :)
---
Rad words bugs mutations out right now cure it then log out then back in should fix it
---
You realize you could just switch servers when you want to play one or the other, yeah?
---
Good work, his man! And Good luck, GdaIV747!
---
Jees.....tough crowd! Down voted to zero already!
---
Randomly in the BoS gear spawns in the Bog like the Ranger station or Antique store.
---
You may find Med goggles in a power plant as well as the Welding Helmet
---
..had the exact same thing with a group of higher level mole rats, I'd sprint then rest and they'd be right effin there.. finally had to "tree" myself on top of a truck just to organize myself and start picking them off..
---
Agreed... like the old known or unknown plan issue, this needs addressed as well. 
---
Especially if too many holo tapes in inventory causes bugs with certain quests.
---
look at my reply to the other guy...
---
how did you trigger it?
---
They’re both pretty damn rare. I’ve found 1 medical goggles and 1 flight helmet in at least 400hrs of play. Both are rare alternate helmet spawns in BoS locations- I found the flight helmet in place of the usual army helmet spawn in the antiques store outside Ft Defiance. Forget where I found the medical goggles. 
---
Got it backwards: *curing* Rad Worms suppresses all mutations as it is. But you're correct, curing and relogging gets everything back to normal.
---
I feel the same way sometimes. 
---
Tried the fire trick?
---
I agree you should be able to by default, but using a fire to create “ground” might work.
---
No he can't, did you even read his post you big dumbus????  
---
His memory span is that of a 3 second snail and must be catered to by trash company Bethesdicksuckers.
---
/s  
---
This is the best thread on Reddit. It just... works.
---
thank goodness for /s
---
You'd have to ask the moderators of the subreddit. Each subreddit has its own rules. 
---
“Very rare” mods can take a while to learn. It’s all RNG though. Best bet is to use Science! Perks to reduce crafting costs, use Super Duper, and keep building/scrapping level 35 ones one at a time until you unlock it.
---
Mine was already full, but valid point so take a +1 
---
That happens to me randomly. Usually a reboot of the computer fixes it.
---
Got me something else to hunt now. xD Thanks.
---
200caps with mats? I know a couple PC side traders who’ll do it for 100 or free with mats
---
Thanks. I didn't previously spend much time in power plants...guess I will now.
---
Found mine in the PA building where the firing range is near Grafton, random drop I'm guessing.
---
Right?  Workshops are pvp?  Fine.  Not my favorite choice, but whatever.  Make them pvp arenas then.  You step out of the arena, you're no longer pvping.  You want to defend the workshop from them taking your bench?  Fine, there's your pvp.
---
Hunting down somebody half a map away from the workshop in question is a stupid mechanic.
---
I’m fairly certain it applies to CAMP/workshop; Contractor certainly does. 
---
"Change appearance" under the start menu
---
*Never* log out at Whitesprings out of PA. Anyway, I'd still prefer Bethesda made our characters immune to all damage until everything is loaded in and we have full control.
---
The fun you get out of loading into a squad of (invisible) Gutsys and seeing your health bar dwindle away is –most probably– limited.
---
You're asking for a change that is only useful if you've left ammo in the stash that you'll probably need to get out anyway if you need to know how many you have. What a joke.
---
Don't complain about being put into the status quo when you're here asking to be catered to for maximum ineptitude. It takes a few seconds to scroll over to ammo and see which you have, it straight up tells you on each weapon which ammo they use, and if you're not constantly upgrading to new legendaries then you should keep the same ammo on your person. 
---
Good satire account OP I can appreciate the humor
---
I have all but electrically charged if you still need them. I can scrounge up the electrically charged when my buddy on the west coast wakes up. gt is phishntrips
---
very true
---
Downvote. All suggestions for this game are stupid. Boo this game!!!
---
Some people might be sick of investing time when getting disconnected all the time, so they invest the bare minimum.
---
Some might be using them as convenient free fast travel points. 
---
Some might be LOOKING for PvP so may leave the workshop as an easy target. 
---
I second this!! 
---
Oh don't worry, this isn't my first time freezing or getting a blue screen error in Whitesprings. I always get back into my power armour on logging off.
---
This would be a great UI change. I would also love a sorting option to see holotapes and notes grouped by the quests they are associated with, preferably with clear read or unread indicators and a quest flag for the one you actively need to read or listen to now. Even just sorting miscellaneous tapes and notes into a separate section would help a lot. This kind of reminds me of the need for a keyring, too.
---
&gt;n glitched and killed me instantly with pacifist mode on heading through my health. after I respawned though, it was very difficult for them to kill me so they just kept destroying my camp. In the end, they ended up destroying the entire thing after their friend came with the explosives.
---
How, other then logging in and out? The way they set this up, you don't know what server you're on and you end up on a randomized one every time you login. You can't easily identify toxic servers and avoid them.
---
You'll have to go to the box anyway to retrieve the ammo type you already have 500 of. Sorry your brain is of the weaksauce.
---
Just because they can't reproduce, doesnt mean they shouldn't try.
---
If you skip that quest and do it later it scales to your level. I have a level... 45 one? I forget the max level on it. 
---
How about more roof sets? I believe I've only seen the one...
---
Wrap around goggles, camo bandana, mining helmet and Union Uniform.  
---
I laughed *so* hard.
---
&gt; Ppl here mistake bad design as a feature. 
---
Man, that's been the F76 reddit since launch. 
---
They're one of fastest mobs in the game. I listen for their little legs and usually am able to jump and turn fast enough to one shot them with VATS. Watch out! They're feisty!
---
like others have said, all you have to do is craft them and scrap them until u unlock the supressor mod.
---
Do you mean the campfire made up with small rocks?
---
Again with people saying griefers are allowed their fun but disregard anyone who thinks griefing isn't fun. SSDG. Just like ARK, Rust, DayZ, Minecraft and a ton of other games. Such fun to be stuck being entertainment for griefers.
---
Bring on PVE servers.
---
There are PLENTY of ways they could have had PVP in FO76 without it being stoopid like it is currently very pro griefing. My favorite idiocity is the fact a Level 250 can fairly PVP a level what is it? 5? 15? I forget. Whatever it is it will be unfair because of gear, SPECIAL and Perk decks. But no no, griefing is legitimate play!
---
Whatever buddy. Just chalk it up to whiners and not actually address the toxic issue it is because only high level and griefers deserve fun. 
---
Yep. As Todd said, that's a "Feature". You'll never see a server, or have any control over what server you appear on, or who you play with.   
---
Because Todd never played multiplayer on XBox Live back in the day apparently. 
---
I think there needs to be a way to at least view what type of armor at view any mods. 
---
Yes, I'd love to know why this isn't showing as completed. It appears to be a fairly common issue, so I hope it's for something upcoming and not just another bug.
---
Or you could do a glass cannon, bloodied or berserker build. That is pretty adrenaline pumping.
---
Now that thrs a filthy casuals fallout 76 sub the number of rose tinted players would decrease. So i would say this sub shld get better and better eventually i hope. Then eventually that sub would remove their rose tinted glasses and finally call bethesda out in unity for their bullshit. A man can dream. 
---
Stands for Forced Evolutionary Virus, and it also made the Snallygasters I think.
---
I was playing GTAV online before this game and felt the same way....realized I wasn't having fun because I had everything...best guns , cars ,  boatloads of money , everything the game had to offer...nothing to challenge me besides other players , and that got boring after awhile too...sometimes the climb to the top is a lot more fun than being at the top
---
This is idiotic to suggest. To ask Bethesda implement a menu organizations system the modders have made for every fallout game yet??? What nerve! It’s blasphemy to even suggest they make the slightest attempt at making it more organized, intuitive, or convenient.
---
Oh I didn't realize you and Bethesda was so close....calling then Beth...you big sloot
---
Nice! I like the Union Uniform a lot, cause it's one of the outfits that has a backpack. The canteen looks cool too.
---
Do you find the Gauss a bit underwhelming? I'm really trying to stick with the Gauss but it feels weak. 
---
Nawww that's not what I'm looking for...I'm creating my own mode ..not adventure , not survival...I call it the Bare Boned mode
---
Great shop setup! PowerBurrito will be coming for some gear! I'll message u of course 
---
the dream would be thishttps://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:Fallout_4_tattered_field_jacket_with_accessories.jpg
---
but unable to for some reasons:
---
jacket has a 0.02% chance to drop
---
wrapped cap in F076 has the Hubologist skin from Nuka world, meaning it is chrome
---
and wrapped cap cannot be worn with any other face wear for some reason
---
The moonshine place and the lumbermill just south of v76 is where I farm them for blood and blood packs is where I get mine 
---
Something like that would be awesome like being able to turn on trading mode so nearby people in game can see your down to trade 
---
Again nope. PvP does Not equate to leveling someone's base simply because they own a workshop.
---
Killing someone and taking the workshop from them is what the game was intended and advertised as. Rocking up on a solo player with a squad and destroying their house? It's just being an ass hat.
---
And that's the same argument people used for ARK, DayZ, Rust, Minecraft and a million other "survival" games. So because people can't 24/7 min/max and roll with a squad they don't deserve to play? Yeah, SSDG. 
---
I’ve gone through the same struggle. In the end I went back to my main character and threw EVERTHING away. And started fresh that way,
---
It’s actually
---
Been very very rewarding!
---
Suddenly you’re naked and defenseless again, and now you can Choose new perks as you level to match your new style
---
it would be great if that same vendor could combine fusion cores for a fee.  It's stupid to walk around with 10 half full cores that weight six pounds a piece without perks. Even more so since the game defaults to full charge cores first.
---
Yup. It works for plants so might work for this.
---
Did you not read that I just got the game.
---
If you use XP bonus giving foods (cranberry juice from diseased cranberries 2% bonus, cranberry cobbler 5% bonus, mama dolce canned stew 5% etc) and pick up a well rested XP bonus at the start of your session you’ll get the levels you need in no time, also there’s plenty of vid’s on YouTube on XP grinding locations. With so many other things on Bethesda’s to do list I can’t see them giving people the option to totally re-spec in one go any time soon. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a list somewhere too of the best XP giving events too if googled. Also most recent inside the vault issue  doesn’t say anything about a re-spec which I’m sure they would mention if it was planned any time soon, you might as well crack on an get as many levels under your belt now to re-spec in the currently available way so your all sorted with your new build ready for the new content in March, that’s what I would do.
---
You'd be surprised lol
---
Add NitrousInject too if you like. I don't play as often as I used to, but I always enjoy being a moon man with others haha
---
You can still activate photomode, hide hud and take a screenshot 
---
Thank you for providing a quality and informative post. I learned something here. 👍
---
Well if you haven't tried it I suggest putting on a Hazmat Suit, and if you can get a Berserker first weapon, should be easy as I bet most people see them as trash. Remove all perks that add any DR. So you have 0 DR. Then go into nuke zones solo to fight glowing ghouls and gather flux. Honestly it's like what you described. Exciting, can die at any moment, have to be cautious, etc. It's something else. If you haven't tried it I suggest it if you want to spice things up a little. I also wear Hooded Rags when not in nuke zone with that build, as it just removes all armor so easy to switch to that "mode" without equipping every item.
---
Speaking of the Silver Shroud, how do you make the hat?  I can make the coat, but I never found the option to craft the hat.  Is it a drop or spawn in-world?
---
I'm on again for a couple of hours. Let me know if you're on.
---
I spawned into a game today to be told my base can't be placed, which was good because 3 level 80 scorch beasts started spamming me with their shriek crap. Leveled whoever's base was there. Sorry guy. I tried but after 3 minutes of nothing but shriek spam I just ALT F4'd.
---
Game still has a LOOOOOOOONG way to go. 
---
\&gt;FO76 has *no* scarcity for sellable loot.
---
Neither did FO4 but FO4 still managed to be fun.
---
\&gt;he only way to prevent this from immediately breaking the economy
---
Breaking what economy? There is no economy, there's only a inventory management simulator. There aren't player trading hubs. I can't even get 99.999% of players to trade because the trade system is so clunky it's practically useless. The vendor "economy" is a joke. If I forget how to work around the janky system and buy items before I sell, oops those caps disappeared. (SO IMMERSIVE) Available loot / money doesn't change based on what players are doing. There aren't even end-game goals that necessitate any kind of economy. 
---
\&gt;It's about managing a multiplayer economy where stuff falls from the sky.
---
No, it's about introducing roadblocks and inconveniences to increase play time to try to turn a single player game into an MMO. This isn't an MMO (There are only \~30 people per server to begin with) and even if it were that's not how you handle the economy. If I hopped on WoW today I could any vendor everything from junk loot to legendary loot worth thousands of gold and they still have a healthy economy because those items are \*actually\* scarce and rare. If they want things to feel scarce, they should make them scarce. If they don't want you to make 500 caps per loot run, make items sellable for less and/or make mobs drop fewer items. If they're going to give players boatloads of loot, players are going to \*NEED\* to scrap or sell said boatloads of loot. (Especially with weight / stash limits) Nothing is worse than fighting a hard fight, getting some valuable stuff and realizing you're now going to have to play the inventory management fast travel game the rest of the night to offload it and potentially just drop it on the ground if it doesn't have an immediate use.
---
\&gt;It's not about your convenience.  It's about managing a multiplayer  economy where stuff falls from the sky.  You should take the hint and  stop worrying about min/maxing your caps and vendor transactions, it's  unnecessary.
---
Maybe it's not about player convenience but \*fun\* should enter the equation at some point. Having to jump through 7 load screens just to sell some crap is \*not\* fun. Having to choose to drop ammo on the ground because there's no way to barter or sell it is \*not\* fun. Realizing you just made your caps disappear into thin air by trading in the "wrong order" is \*not\* fun. The system is broken and tbh if you actually care about the longevity of the game you shouldn't be defending it.
---
You get them through the toxic valley quests
---
fighting the SBQ with a bunch of deadweight players will only make her exponentially harder to kill
---
Yeah it's so dumb. I had 10 technical data and it only kept 1
---
Psssttt...come here...let me let you in on a publicly available piece of information. They were never planning to remove all dupes of all items only a set of specific rare items.
---
It takes like 20min solo to fully repair it. You might struggle at first because it's easy to get lost but it's totally doable at level 10+
---
Haha, I would actually buy that for my character!
---
sort by recent would help, too. 
---
Wrapped cap not being able to wear with face gear sucks. :(
---
Also, move them back to the DATA tab.  What possible motivation could the devs have had for making 43 ITEMS tabs, removing so much from DATA
---
No, but you get out of the one your in. On Xbox,  open the map, open the social menu and choose leave world... you end up back in the loading screen without shutting down your game 
---
My character's signature look is freckles + gridiron make-up + prisoner collar + no underarmor.  Rarely in Power Armor, usually doesn't wear an outfit over her armor.
---
I was going for the tough girl look, someone that would be underestimated by others in the wasteland based on her appearance, and then she kicks your butt and you realize she's not even wearing pants. 😂  For a while, it often felt like I was the only female character on a server, so that kind of added to it.  Hi there, Mr. Power Armor, yeah I dropped that robot in one hit while you sat there shooting it with bullets. 😏
---
Drifter outfit + gasmask &amp; gray cap
---
Good god. When that mission has you load the master holotape.... what a mess it was to find that shit
---
I mean, day one BETA player here. This update I doubt will change anything for me, or many like me. The problem wasn't what they fixed in this update, even thoigh yes that was a great thing. But I quit playing several weeks ago (actually picked FO4 back up) was because theres nothing to do, and no one to do it with. The fact they didn't add anything to do means I probably won't go back, and I doubt most of the people who are leaving will go back as well. I wouldn't call this good work from Bathesda unfortunately. They're showing they might kinda care, but with people still leaving in droves, it isn't good job. I'm not saying it can't be one day, but they are a far ways from deserving a pat on the back.
---
it would also help when crafting to have a small display of perk cards we own that would be relevant to the current activity, and whether they’re enabled or not. 
---
not that i forget to enable ammosmith or chemist or super duper a lot. 
---
I wouldn't mind if there was an easier way to trade for other ones. I'd like to put my several hundred plans into a vendor and have other players buy them.
---
I hope the vendor trading update does this and it's separate to stash.
---
SCP-049 has breached containment!
---
Thank you so much, this means a lot! I haven't made much progress, but if you find something weird, feel free to tell us!!! =]]]]
---
No equipping of any perks will be allowed. Do not equip a weapon. Do not open perk packs. Do not allocate special level ups. 
---
Welcome to the iron wasteland.
---
Beer hat, prisoner collar and bathrobe. 
---
I read it was 25, 9 from perk, 5 from mentats, so only need to hit 11 charisma via armor/alcohol/food
---
It’ll work for everything
---
Yeah, my bad - I should've been more clear that my final build will replace the stealth boy for a jetpack 
---
I agree, I wouldn't destroy someone's base just for fun, but the argument here is taking workshops flags you for pvp which is the entire point of them
---
It's probably to stop people posting low effort memes. Same goes for r/Fallout and other subs run by the same mod team. 
---
craft/scrap radium rifles or ultracite laser guns or marine/trapper/robot/metal armor all for mods
---
* Free fast travel.
---
* Doing a Daily challenge to own a workshop (usually worth 10 Atoms).
---
* Farming for various plans.
---
Marsupials herd has been functioning like this from the very beginning. There’s nothing to trust in. We just show up to help. Cooperative gameplay of sharing our unique skills and discoveries and items is our endgame. 
---
Why would I be wanted?
---
The FO4 pip boy app was awesome 
---
Stay around the easier areas. It takes awhile, but I also build with this character.
---
Yup.  The Uncanny Valley is filled with fake people
---
This works for me well, provided less than 10 people participate:
---
* 2\* Vampiric Gatling Gun with +10% damage when aiming down, Speedy receiver, Reticle, Extra large magazine (204 range)
---
* Heavy Gunner 1, Expert Heavy Gunner 2, Master Heavy Gunner 3 (+45% damage)
---
* 3x Martial Artist (+30% crank speed)
---
* Stabilized (Ignore 45% DR, Accuracy boost)
---
* Bloody mess (+15% damage)
---
* Gunsmith 5 (50% slower gun degradation)
---
* Adrenaline 5 (+60% damage, +90% damage with the Rad Worms glitch, you have to kill mobs to buff it up though)
---
Before we create nuke cola, we need to bring back Ice cold nuke cola from FO3!  
---
Oh, I've been there. Is it a random spawn chance item or what?
---
Agreed. Would make handling the stash box a cinch as well as helping a bit with exploring
---
Then go play something else instead (Fortnite or Roblox perhaps?)  
---
Nobody is forcing you to play FO76.. 
---
Thanks for the reply, i really appreciate the time and attention you're giving to help everyone here!
---
Anthem is a very mediocre game and I always recommend people just play Warframe instead if they want a similar experience with much more content, but let's not cope too hard here.
---
Ok.
---
Love the outfits with gloves. Drifter Outfit is one of my faves.
---
You got to shoot her in her tiny little face.
---
The idea was a laser focused build designed for only maximizing the amount of shit it can hold. And then I added scavenging. 
---
And Building. 
---
Kind of to demonstrate that the carry weight limitations aren't really a big deal.
---
This build can carry over 17 millions rounds of 5mm...17,000 pounds worth of chems, food, weapons - almost 7000 lbs of armor. 
---
And....because it's possible - no different really than any other ridiculously specialized build.
---
Probably.  It's like the one enemy that shows up at Fissure Site Prime, other than the Scorchbeasts, that deserves your respect.
---
Nevertheless, cripple the spouts, cripple the legs.  I actually have a Legendary Exterminator's Combat Knife that helps a lot with the rest.
---
1 doorway has that problem (greenish sides), switch to the other doorway (wooden looking sides with some wooden looking thing at the top)
---
No
---
Bloodied gatling gun for when she's in the air.
---
When she lands, bloodied explosive minigun. Shreds her into pieces.
---
On my low level, like level 10, I took a workshop from someone who was like level 15 and on the other side of the map. I needed the resources. Junk and fertilizer. So I just claimed the workshop. But there were like 10+ turrets. I died a few times. Paid to claim it multiple times. The other person didn't come back to defend it so I guess they just abandoned it. But while I'm coming back the turrets keep firing at me, breaking my low level guns, using all my ammo on these turrets that keep killing me, I also get wanted for some reason. I killed them all and took the workshop, then went down to food packaging and claimed that one too. When a few higher levels showed up interested in my bounty. The first one took pity on me and use their fists, I shot them in the head. The next one over level 100 one shotted me. I don't mind that higher levels are a lot more powerful and can do that, but I don't think I should have been wanted in the first place for fighting turrets that were shooting at me at the Workshop.
---
That's why you hit her with a hammer and kill her in a few strikes.
---
I’ve heard if you play the tapes in chronological order it will complete the quest.  I keep forgetting to do this so I can’t verify if it’s true. 
---
Was looking to kill some time until an expansion happened. Pve co op sounded fun after pvp griefing.  
---
Really thrown by the whole npc's thing, I thought I kinda missed them.  Please give me a holotape.
---
It’s ridiculous what happened to Andromeda. A lot of the systems they were initially developing for it shifted to Anthem. That resulted in two half baked games, rather than one solid one. God damn shame. 
---
So expensive though with 15 charisma and hard bargain rank 3 =[
---
Yes.  We’d love it.   So that means it won’t happen.  
---
Normally if I'm in Whitesprings, I drink from the fountain on the other side of the tennis club to cure them.
---
What perks do you think are a must for your gatling gun? 
---
PVP servers are going to be the worst of it. I promise you right now anyone who has cavaliers assassins armour and uses melee is going to crush everyone else. Basically you can't kill them while they're running you down and once they get to you, you're probably dead in one or two hits anyway.
---
Thanks! Is that the same formula for adrenal reaction? 
---
The issue isnt people taking over your workshop, its them failing to take it over, traveling to you and killing you for lots of caps, even if youre pacifist
---
Unless they changed it in the latest patch it should work.
---
There was a glitch where if you joined the game with the armour equipped, it would glitch out and not work. Maybe that is what happened?
---
It's cool finding people with exposed armor. I like the "Mr. Power Armor", like tin-cans have a discernible gender. 😄 I've seen some cool looks with the shadowed armor, and a friend sporting the true scavver style of random Metal, Raider, and Trapper pieces. 
---
I might try this out with my TSE gatling gun. But with 5 in the ecplosive perk. 
---
Cheers! 
---
One helluva combo.
---
System. Gamer tag?
---
Suppressor's gatling gun and ultracite gatling laser for queen and my trusty scorch killer pump and medic's double barrel for the lesser mobs
---
Please do it
---
Sounds cool. I agree about not wanting to OP new players. I enjoyed the early game when the struggle felt real. It got to be a drag in the late teens tho. 
---
PS4: VinKramey. Lvl 50-something. 
---
The main point is that you might not be bored as you have things to do now compared to just hopping from event to event on your high level character
---
Surely they didn’t do this for a good reason.  I mean why else would something so simple and intuitive not be already implemented.  They are not fools like us.
---
I want ALL the Wallpaper 
---
I still can't track down a decebt gatling laser. I hear it does a decent job eith the Queen. Just that it is quick to break. 
---
This comment hit hard for me. I loved mass effect trilogy, And andromeda maybe is the gayest, stupidest game I’ve ever bought/played.  I hope anthem is fun for me, as I plan on getting it on release
---
With all 3 rifleman perks maxed out, it hits like a freight train. My non legendary hits for like 234 without sneak bonus. Add Tank Killer and hot damn it will tear some shit up. 
---
well, games are software. so feature requests get logged, evaluated, prioritized, estimated. there are only so many dev hours in a day and they choose to allocate those hours where they will be most effective. 
---
since sorting already exists for other inventory types i would hope the technical complexity of applying it to this type would be low. 
---
Are we almost done with this nuke silo? I only had one breakfast this morning and I'm starving.
---
Way to low
---
I'm looking at the notes and I'm having a hard time reconciling what's so different that would cause you to start "having the most fun in this game since it launched" ?
---
Is there anything specific that you can describe?
---
I made my camp in such a way that most of the pieces are connected to each other.  That way the game automatically makes a quasi-blueprint for free.  It becomes a Stored item when you move your camp.  Doing it that way allows you to move the entire setup at once without having to rebuild much.  Depending on how you do it, you may not have to rebuild anything - just plop down your one-piece camp and you're done.
---
You on PC?
---
So maybe just a few people.  
---
Congrats. I got 1 the first week back in beta. Have yet to see a 2nd one.
---
I think for the benefit of your mental health you should attempt to remember it.  I’m not being sarcastic.  Like seriously, I’m concerned.  
---
The area by black bear lodge is covered in bleached dogwoods. Use the green thumb perk and you'll get about 30 just walking around.
---
Ignore the down votes, friend. I'm just like you and have very similar opinions and our opinions are just as valid as everyone else's. Thanks for your response. 
---
&gt; Don’t worry I’m sure all you snowflakes will whinge and moan
---
While whinging and moaning about "unfair advantages". 
---
Cool, thanks. Gonna give it a shot.
---
I change my outfit/look aaaaall the time. Recently I did my makeup and hair for the mistress of mystery, now I’m running around in a sun hat and swimsuit.
---
Usual get up is the mr fuzzy mining helmet and a jumpsuit! Always bottlecap sunglasses.
---
Stabilized is a must for me, the improved accuracy helps a lot.
---
I don't get why people seem to dislike the NPC interaction, I felt like it flowed fairly well and the characters aren't dull.
---
Take the opening with Owen and the freelancer, he sounds genuinely relieved when you hit the liquid after losing flight and it's "just water", the freelancer sounds like they're stressed too.
---
A little later, when they're closing the relic, it does sound like they're both a bit panicked.
---
When you get back, they establish his character as mischievous, but supportive, and from what I've played that doesn't really change.
---
Then again, I play on rather low settings, so I mostly just listen to dialogue and the voices of characters.
---
Weapon artisan and gun nut make mine last about half way through the fight, I spec mine with reflex sight and beta wave so I have basically the highest durability it can get and ultracite variant deals extra damage to scorched
---
Ok. So I guess it's cool we were at least able to get the Nuke off
---
shoot the little man in the boat
---
Whoa thanks that was too nice
---
At 110 you should just wear the skeleton mask
---
PS4.
---
I swap between heavy weapons like TSE prime 50 cal or TSE Gatling and a bloody explosive handmade with all rifle perks, helpful to have armor pen and crippling perks
---
I've given stuff to low lvl players as well. I would say 75% of the time they run off even if you travel to them multiple times and try to have a chat. 
---
I'm on PC. I had about 800-900 Gauss rounds I'm looking to give away being I'm switching to Lever Action untill I get an Instigating Gauss.
---
I started a new character because the main quest was bugged on my first character.  A lot of the survival challenges weren't working on my main (e.g. the "kill 76 animals" challenge said I had killed zero in 80hrs of gameplay
---
Basically it's the highest damage single shot rifle. Black powder and dragon have higher per hit damage but reload super slow. You might get a slightly higher dps out of a faster rifle but I doubt it.
---
Yes please
---
The NPCs in F76 *are* canned and scripted, in audio format.
---
I did.  Tried that but didn’t notice any difference.  The other variant of the Queen I don’t need to blast them in the face to take them down in 5 shots.  
---
Science Scribe outfit with Top Hat and Bottlecap sunglasses and Veil of Secrets or Camouflage Suit (Atom Shop) with the same accessories 
---
It is not an appearance thing. I actually think they did well with the animations. They dont stand at perfect attention while speaking and such.  
---
I am turned off by the whole "dialog tree" I have to navigate to get the "points"  I have to pay attention to dialog or I pick poor answers.  
---
I dont feel like its anymore real by having npc's. Quite the opposite. All I can think of is final fantasy 1 dialog. No npc's was much more clever than I thought
---
Ooh I use asylum red hat + prisoner collar with pink asylum, red dress or white powder jumpsuit
---
Next time, run around weaponless in your underwear somewhere like white springs. It's kind of a signal when you're wanted that you just want to end. Learned this myself by asking the same thing a month or so ago. Worst case, you can just run up and punch someone and they'll get pissed and kill you but you've given them no damage seeing as you're naked and weaponless.
---
Bloodied explosive gatling while she’s in the air, and bloodied swing spd deathclaw gauntlet when she lands. Just your typical low health nerd rage build.
---
You'd be surprised.
---
I do this too. Though it sucks when I wear something new and my friends don't notice..cause I'm invisible.
---
I wanted to rock the swimsuit with sun hat look, cause it's awesome...But...I can't get over running around barefoot. I've seen what's out there... 
---
I miss the red bottlecap glasses. :(
---
Oh, dude... if I could find an Instigating Gauss.... That would be heaven. Double damage if the target is at max health, combined with my 2.5x stealth bonus? 
---
I’m just not sure if it’s intended because at close of a range I was shooting at the Queen I could have taken down at least 5 scorched beasts.  
---
Once again; You're welcome. I just think it makes sense to try to make others enjoy the game more as well. Main reason I've published all my mods. Haha
---
Event is live, head on over!
---
I'm Level 137 on XBox.  I bought the game for PC recently and I'm doing kind of what you described, although not really on purpose.  I'm saving my perk slots for the cards I want for my builds.  The ones I want haven't started appearing yet, so I haven't taken any.
---
Right now I'm Level 11 and my SPECIALS and Perks are nearly barren.  It's a scary world out there.
---
On the plus side I'm a woman this time around, and I've chosen to run around in my underwear.  A lot of male players have given me free shit when they see me.  Weapons, armor, junk...one dude dropped 50 stimpaks at my feet.  I could get used to this.
---
Workshops are PvP zones, you took someone's workshop and was killing their turrets, that's kinda how it's supposed to work
---
Yes. 
---
Yea, and its presented that way. It is less fake. That's kinda where I was going with this. I know npc's are fake, I'm looking at it. In my head holo tapes are more real. Like a history lesson.
---
Except that the scorchbeast wasn't screaming in the air, it had the right sound effect, and no scorched were around. It also had unlimited range.
---
I maxed my Str but my melee isn’t that strong. Only does +200 with my super sledge.  
---
You initiated PVP and ended up wanted? Sounds like its working fine in that regard. It is *very very* broken, but thats not why.
---
Poseidon is the easiest Power Plant to repair as there's only level 1's and level 6's Scorched there, the hardest part is finding the way into the reactor room.
---
I had an issue with these two Super Mutants as well. After a headshot, [this happened](http://imgur.com/jVODZeO) and they didn’t quite explode as intended.
---
Not true my new place have red doors and wood doors all with this problem. Someone said its only the brick that does it which may be true. I have all brick
---
I didn't even know the White Powder Jumpsuit was a thing. :O
---
Is it from one of the ski resorts?
---
Love how there's so many variants of the asylum outfits.
---
Gayest is normally a poor choice as a descriptor, but in this case it fits.
---
&gt;I also get wanted for some reason. I killed them all and took the workshop, then went down to food packaging and claimed that one too.
---
gee i wonder why you were wanted after destroying workshops
---
How does one get this?
---
Dumb question- if a holotape isn't marked with a diamond as part of a quest is there a reason to listen to it outside of adding to the story? I have a bajillion holotapes that I've picked up along the way and probably only ever listened to a fraction of them. I'm curious if listening to any of them might open up another quest..... I just don't want to sit there for an hour going through them if that's not the case.
---
OP was unable to flea.
---
Me too! Best PA paint ...
---
I love the Veil of Secrets. I always have it as a back-up when there's junk in the air.
---
Hadn't seen the Science Scribe outfit either. Dang, I'm missing a bunch of cool clothes.
---
When I asked this people attacked each other while arguing back and forth.
---
You would need to watch that reload animation 4 times if it does exist.
---
Like the crossbow, you might need to push the reload button 4 separate times.
---
To the guy who has one - Please post a picture
---
I just want to be able to sort them by when/where I picked them up and/or categories, etc.
---
Awesome thanks man 
---
Very well put, couldn't have said it better myself.
---
They containt lore and help give an insight to life in Appalachia pre and post war..  
---
Aslo worth listening as some give you side quests or new map information..
---
what are you running in END?
---
I didn't "destroy workshops". I paid the caps to claim the workshop and the turrets fired on me. I defended myself against the turrets. That's how it's supposed to work. 
---
I kinda get that with how easy it is to collect ammo in the game that selling and scrapping it on the same levels as FO4 would probably screw up the economy, but even just a few lead and gunpowder or 5 caps per 500 ammo would be fine with me. I just hate dumping it all.
---
Lvl4 irconclad and lvl1 radicool
---
The Science Scribe outfit drops from turning in Technical Data :) Happy Hunting!
---
Andromeda had some interesting things in it, but seeing all the polish get shifted away into a new IP while leaving the original game half-assed is pretty depressing. 
---
Damn thought it would be a little higher tbh
---
Red rocket jumpsuit, robco hat, and sunglasses when im not in my x01. In my ar.or its all black minus the head, which is red
---
I'm not talking about the doors, I'm talking about the frames, there's 2 frames with the brick set. The frame that has a greenish metal looking frame is the one that has issues.
---
Sorting sucks right now.  There are mods on Nexus that does a much better job.  This is what, like the six installment of the series, there’s no reason for it too lack such BASIC functions.  
---
DEFINITELY need to be able to store nuka cola and alcohol in the nuka cola machines at CAMP. 
---
Both do it for me. I use one style for exterior the other for interior. 
---
I have a building problem
---
Ok, thanks for answering. Do you think it's a glitch it does that or is that just how it's supposed work?
---
Ok
---
I’m active on the marketplace, I thought if I’d max my charisma I would get like 70%-80% off the original price lol
---
I think it’s part of the pack that is a super rare drop from events? I bought it from someone unfortunately 
---
responders blue jumpsuit , glasses and a fishing hat 
---
The plane engine generator you mean?
---
Do the power up -name- powerplant events.
---
Sooner or later the plan for the generator will be gifted as reward.
---
I'll look it up. Thanks.
---
It actually worked. Thanks.
---
Now I'm going to look for an object that can serve the same function.
---
Cause the fire does look a bit weird.
---
I just wish I could sell them to vendors 
---
I'd like to see the same thing when it comes to mats, especially when crafting and repairing.  Knowing I'm getting dangerously low on springs or whatever might influence me to not make that last round of ammo. Wouldn't be hard to have a new display window with total owned materials in bulk/scrap.  
---
theyre not that hard to find
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Dragon](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dragon)
---
Cowboy hat, drifter outfit and patrolman sunglasses. Alternatively, tattered clown suit and fasnacht mask.
---
I'm totally biased and haven't researched the game much, but it sure looks like another microtransaction store with a game attached instead of the other way around.
---
Yeah bug fixes alone won't bring me back to the game. Give us some endgame content
---
How much can you get your gatling to do with maxed perks and low health? 
---
Nice. I wore the Responders Paramedic Jumpsuit for the beginning of the game. Looks good. 
---
k
---
Ah, I never knew. Thanks for the info. 
---
Where do I "turn them in"?
---
I just switched some of my stats around based loosely off of your suggestion and now my meat hook does over 1k base damage, so thank you!
---
You can track the quest in challenges. It lists each tape and if you have collected it. You get atomic shop points for doing so, only reason I know it
---
Thanks for this but I’m staying near the first town - gotta hell those new players
---
Good trucker/mechanic look. Why the diff outfit in the armor? Does it show through in some way?
---
I see more threads talking about controversy here than actual controversial threads. No one is saying 76 PVP is good.
---
Great news! They just announced a huge content boost! Gonna have new missions every week in a series called Wild Appalachia! 
---
I cannot imagine a situation where a Furious Dragon would be good.
---
And please give us chance to continue if mission starts with holo or note when we leave server and later log in.
---
It has a nice look to it and in general it let's people know I'm here to help , I've run into a few folks wearing the jumpsuit and I've had pretty good luck with those people  being helpful individuals .
---
I hear you. I was so confused as to what to do
---
/s?
---
They were talking about the quad legendary quality. The one that gives 4x ammo capacity.
---
Yes. For Silo Alpha,  the launch tube is almost directly south of Yellow Sandy Still in a fenced off section.  Be quick to snap a picture, there is no warning that the tibe is fixing to open.
---
It does get to me that it’s barefoot :( But I’ve just moved my camp to a pond so I like to imagine I at least have a nice foot bath every day!
---
I would totally notice and appreciate your style! 
---
Did the same thing over a river so I can keep my purifiers protected. Have a similar issue with enemies spawning inside my building but it's not often. 
---

Averaging 1500-1700, I don’t have a picture but have checked multiple times during SBQ runs.
---
Nice. When I wear the clown suit I wear the mole head with it. 🤡
---
Ya sandman is one I could hot swap in when needed.   I liked fireproof because it helped when I get attacked by scorchbeasts or other tse.  I don’t mind fixing since I just swap in weapon artisan and make sure
---
It’s 200%. 
---
Btw I’m level 189 not that it matters 
---
I seriously cannot tell if this is satire or not
---
But god help us if it isn't
---
This game is boring without pvp. Everyone afraid of it probably bowls with the bumpers up. Dying is a humbling part of any game, gitgud.
---
post apocalyptic hazing laws are quite vague but still generally frowned upon
---
It caps at about 30%, rising by about 5% per hit. That's base damage, so after the DR formula it's more like +43% actual HP damage. Anti-armor works out at +29% HP damage, for comparison.
---
Not sure what the rules are for missing or switching targets.
---
Which perk cards did you upgraded?
---
Same 
---
I mean it has the potential to be a good joke but...
---
Yeah, quad combat shotguns
---
Yeah.  Your name is still funny. 
---
I’m no expert, but most pistol builds i read about use vats/critically. I use sneak attack bonus with vats for headshots.  Usually one shot ghouls.  2-3 supermutants.  I’m level 65. Most enemies between 40 and 65. I use standard rifles. No legendaries.  
---
I'll be on in 1hr ish and I'll check out 
---
I've never had this problem. Nuke zone Scorched Mirelurk Queen goes down before I have to reload my TSE shotgun. If you're working at medium to long range, you're gonna need skeet shooter 3. Even with skeet shooter 3, a double barrel shotgun is barely hitting her beyond grenade range.
---
If you think the 7 hours I’ve wasted in this game to acquire all of that is satire then you can go touch yourself 
---
The only thing that I considered Fallout 76 having the potential to pull off that would be genuinely new and innovative.
---
It would fit in perfectly in 76; after all, there's no NPCs to refer to you as either smoothskin or ghoul, and the fact you can change your character and make new ones so fluidly would come in handy as well. 
---
The perfect opportunity for something I consider long overdue (the equivalent of vampirism/lycanthropy in the Elder Scrolls) to finally be implemented into the series, and it's not in the game.
---
Wait! What? PA causes 2h weapons to be 1h? Does that invalidate my 2h melee perks? 
---
Double connects? 
---
We'll get right on that. In another subreddit.
---
I would very much like hunger and thirst reevaluated. There is a constant need to micromanage these values, and it adds to the *tedium* of this game, greatly decreasing enjoyment.
---
Even if something is a designed game mechanic, at what point do you simply let the players have a more fun experience by making it less annoying and overbearing?
---
Please fix these drain rates. They are such a drag.
---
Sometimes it is good. Even when I lost hundreds of caps at the munitions factory against 3 players with TSE, I died more than I killed them, but I got them a few times and it was good. They have improved PvP significantly since then with how OP TSE was. I think the caps loss with level thing is a bit stupid, and prohibitive. Makes people not want to PvP. But workshops are based around PvP. Between the player who owns it and the player contesting it. Getting wanted in that situation is either some bug or accident by the player, possibly shooting at turrets that are perhaps not damaging them.
---
No, it doesnt give any extra benefit just the visual, still counts as 2h 
---
How do you get that many chems? Crafting with double perks?
---
No, not nerfed. Fought two more times later. One failed, with just 4 people. The other, dozens of people ( all heavy weapon) killed the Queen during the second landing within 5 minutes. 
---
It connects me then reconnects me to another server
---
I'm not trying to be funny here, but do you honestly think Bethesda care all that much about consistency? If they could do it easily it would be in the game, simple as that.
---
Love it. I like to swim in the game, so I really wanted to like it. I'm thinking of getting the Manta Man outfit and using that for my bathing suit. xD
---
Nope I haven't actually met anybody that has done this to me, it was more of a hypothetical situation. I just think having to destroy it completely would take more time and be easier to troll others. Rather than the troll having to stop just before it's completely destroyed theres some more ambiguity to where say 50% damage is done.
---
It isn’t! 
---
It was the other person's claimed workshop and you took it!  That is what made you wanted, and that's how the system is designed to work.
---
If you're using a shotgun and haven't done so already invest in enforcer. The stagger and cripple effect is astounding!
---
 Nothing better than watching deathclaws, behemoths and mirelurk Queens attempt to crawl away. Also make those face shots alot easier. 
---
Slow down there sport!
---
Cap 4 resources and the game will server hop you automatically lol
---
What sort of base damage do your weapons have? I have a lever action rifle, which I've buffed with mods, the rifleman perks and armor penetration perks. My base damage is around 130, 140, and that's good enough to headshot most things in 2 or 3 hits. (Super mutants and some robots, I'll need to switch limbs, but most things die in less than 5 seconds.) If you've already taken all of the damage perks for your weapons, try taking mods / perks with armor penetration as well. 
---
Smoothskin Supremacist!
---
I mean, technically you want my damn paint. I really want more good paint jobs though.
---
No it isn't. And you obviously don't know anything about Workshops if you think it does. Most of my play time has been centered around owning workshops, so I think I know how it works
---
Got all the rifle damage perks.  One in concentrated fire.   Full agility and sneak perks.  The one for ranged sneak damage. Rifle armor penetration. And all the luck perks for criticals in  vats and bloody mess.  
---
Lmao sorry I meant help, I give newer players my spare radaway, known plans and make them weapons as well as giving them adhesive (I get  slot from my farm)
---
Hey, don't blame us 76 players, we're all treading water waiting for bug fixes and new content over here. File a support ticket and wait in line like the rest of us

"WHO FARTED!?!?"
---
I'm selling an empath recipe for you and your friends. &gt;_&gt;
---
Friend had 30, yesterday she found out when she begins the quest they make the stack size 1. 
---
Mine are around 120, 130. I have a TSE with 222. 
---
I headshot as well, but it doesn’t hurt them much at all. Maybe I need to try vats headshots.
---
I have all the damage perk cards, so I’ll look into armor penetration. 
---
Suppressor can be unlocked by scrapping. Most of the Gauss mods are easier to unlock, but suppressor, compensator, and the recon scopes, all have a low learn chance when you scrap. 
---
Awesome 
---
Sure, but with a shotgun build I'll kill 10 mobs by the time you've stealthed towards 1. My gear might take a touch more damage, but its waaay more time efficient.
---
We have space for one more contract hunter.
---
We pay 2,000 caps for any asshole ""we"" commission you to put in the ground.

Got it
---
Wait what?
---
Can you expand on this a bit?
---
Come on you know the point behind this game is acquire the largest stash of explosive vents plans.
---
Trust me, we remember the good, forget the bad.
---
Look at the goodwill Rockstar has right now.  They all forget how much they hated them 5 years ago.  All those promises to never buy another game from them...out the window with the next big release.  The community was outraged with Rockstar for the whole first year...so much that was promised was not there until a full year later.  The grind was hoŕrid, but many bypassed the grind because hacking (not just exploits) was prolific.
---
(So I fully expect all these haters to be back to Bethesda once the next major title drops.)
---
Meh. I just don’t play often enough or long enough to remember. /shrug
---
Gauss has always been my favorite weapon since FO3. My rifleman perks are maxed and I have on Tank Killer. Still bad at VATS and it's nowhere near as effective as my Lever Action. With the LA the moment I'm caught up with Adrenaline + Gun-fu I'm unstoppable. I tried with the Gauss but no luck.
---
My character wears a sequined dress, fashionable sunglasses, and keeps a gold-plated .44 and a pair of brass knuckles in her purse.  
---
So was there any updates at all for andromeda to make it better?.  I literally only played the first two days after launch.   Was looking at the game yesterday thinking if I should even give it another shot. 
---
You really need to edit your post and stop spreading the BS "They killed me through pacifist". You claimed a workshop, and ignored the PVP notice. Stop spreading bad information. We have more than enough of that in this sub.
---
1500 a bullet? Holyshit. I can only do 200 a bullet with my TSE gatling so far hehe. 
---
That is impressive. 
---
For whatever reason i find myself picking up tons of notes and never reading them.
---
At 200 she'll just morph into post-war Nora all of a sudden.
---
I have enforcer.  That was the whole reason I went with a shotgun build.  :)
---
I want that red one they had in the trailer. Where the hell is that one. 
---
I had rank one mysterious stranger, mostly because of nostalgia from the other games.  It was nice when he came out because mobs would switch focus to him. Eventually, I stopped using it so I could have more room for bloody mess, starched genes, and class freak. 
---
oh god hahahahaha
---
That one took me by surprise :D
---
TBH I don't think people who have 'nothing to do' are the norm. I have put in over 250 hours and still haven't finished the quests, haven't launched a nuke, haven't visited all the locations... I still have shitloads to do.
---
Again. I feel the same damn way about gta.  I get in maybe once a month or every other month to kill a couple of ppl then log straight off. But that grind to the top is so fun
---
Oh forgot to mention, rockstar made the grind so bad to try to encourage people to buy shark cards.  It always amazes me that anyone would do this on a game that was so buggy.  (That first car I earned?  It disappeared from my garage the very night I bought it due to a server error.  Bug report was it ignored.)
---
At least bethesda is not trying selling you caps for real $$$. (Yet, hopefully never)
---
I was pretty impressed. I think the game's almost ready for release.
---
I'm not completely giving up on the Gauss. I'll just retire it for now and use my Lever Action in the meantime. The Gauss ammo is just unnecessary weight at this point so I'm looking to donate it to a fellow Gauss user.
---
Bahahaha.
---
Bathrobe and baseball helmet erday
---
Nice I had a mutation build but empath+ 5 perk cards crippled me lol
---
Speed demon+marsupial makes traveling fun though

Who would have thought a typo of 1 letter would be the exact opposite of your intentions? lol :)
---
Bahahaha. #JusticeFor**xXxPu55yD3str0y3rxXx** 
---
For something that was on sale for only a day or two, one sees a fair number of wearers.  
---
I think the Four Horsemen PA skins, when/if released, will sell like crazy. 
---
But... how?
---
Me too!! One of my favourite perk cards, mixed in with adrenaline and you should be able to make it an easier fight.
---
 Take out the mirelurk spawns and whatever other mirelurk are around to build it up then unleash hell on the Queen.
---
She's a pistol packing mama who didnt know the gun was loaded.
---
Loooove the Baseball helmet, was a fave in Fo4 too.
---
It was at a close range and I have max sheet shooter equipped.  Usually I can take the Queen out at a medium range and that’s where I started at but when I saw how little damage it was doing I went as close as I cloud without blowing myself up.  I even aimed at the face but it made no difference....
---
Okay so Technical Data can be turned into a quest reward by going to the BoS Camp in the Mire. Before you begin this quest, it stacks in your inventory. So if you know from another source about the quest, you would think to stack them. The quest can reward anything from plans, outfits, paints for PA, and of course Legendary weapons and armor. I was giddy to turn mine in, and bam. One technical data with the quest mark symbol next to it. I had like 15 or so, but I thought that was 15 chances at a legendary item or even just some fun cosmetics. Nope 
---
Nah, its mainly just im always in power armor lol

The only joke here is bumthesdad

Dont forget you can swap out underarmor for an extra charisma or 2, depending on what you have in your inventory...
---
Make an effort.  Use it or lose it.  I had the same problem but when you actually tried you will be surprised.  
---
Says the family members of a Bethesda employee. 
---
Headshots do tons of damage to the scorched, and good damage to super mutants, but the latter, well, they can shrug off plenty of damage. Not sure if handgun perks are Perception - I don't use them myself - but Concentrated Fire is worth a couple points in that tree. Agility has perk cards for damage while sneaking - boosting is from 2.0 to 2.5x - so that can help a bit too. 
---
Endgame, you should have plenty of materials, food and water sources, so also try to swap out your reduce weight / survival perk cards for ones focused on combat. I still use Marathoner, because I like to be able to run from enemies from time to time, but I swapped out the cards for reducing food and water weight in Agility, the ones making food last longer in Luck, etc. 
---
This!   1000x this.  
---
I still don't have the Witch outfit. I think it's from a specific event? I keep my eyes on them, but never seem to catch it.
---
Yeah... I dont know. Maybe he got laid?

Lv45 is cap. I have one if you're still looking for one.
---
Their family works for Bethesda and asked them to post a positive comment in support of this failure called a game. 
---
Yeah more times than not I’m in the top 3 of dps. I can easily gauge it just by not attacking and seeing the difference in her HP bar not going down as quick. 
---
Adrenaline seems kind of pointless when even stealth head shots require 2-3 hits for the kill.
---
Guns are insanely underpowered currently. Nothing worse than being a stealth sniper and not being able to land a head shot for a kill.
---
Yeah lmao
---
I usually go for the jumpsuit look, a lot of my play time I’ve spent wearing the Camden park or mechanical jumpsuit with a metal helmet. Or the responders jumpsuit with a baseball cap. Still trying to get my hands on those rare jumpsuits...
---
Lol haha #sobrave
---
#justiceforpu55yd3str0y3rxXx
---
totally agree on that. I'm also side on the idea that if we can't sell ammo, at least let us break it down if not for all, then at least some of the components maybe like 33% of half of what it cost to make. 
---
Yessssss. That's the marine armor? Liking the accessories. xD
---
Sack hood + clean straight jacket.
---
So new bugs every week to cause more server disconnects and freeze ups? 
---
I just wish I could be refunded for the PC game. I can take the console game back for a $2 trade-in, but I'm stuck with the PC game. 
---
Lol 😆
---
I lucked out and bought it from Grahm (400 caps but ssshh), I’m not sure how else you get it to be honest! I know there’s plans to craft it, but I haven’t gone to the right side of the map yet.
---
Agreed, it's a pain when I have like 5 random 4/100 fusion cores and just want to get rid of them, but the suit is all "here lets take the 80/100!"
---
I dumped every note and hold tape after reading except overseer and those won't dissappear couse it's not complete. Did yall forget about the dlc's? There's still some places the overseer hasn't told us to check out.
---
Heh, thanks :)! Yep, Marine Armor w/ Welding Goggles, Surgical Mask, and Combat Armor Helmet painted BoS. All the colours match. 
---
Hnnnnggggg :P
---
Same
---
I think you're confusing ME with all the people complaining about content. I've personally only run 1 character so far. I have plenty to discover at this point. I'm just excited to be getting more to look forward to so I don't need your negativity bud thanks. Not trying to tout myself as a bad ass, just spreading info and being excited for it. So you're welcome (I'll pretend you thanked me for the info;))
---
Yeah it bugs me too, being overweight and needing to also switch weight perks, and switch food and drink perks when eating and drinking, building perks when building, crafting perks when crafting, gathering perks when gathering, lock picking and hacking, etc. It's just such a cumbersome annoying system I can't even be bothered with it.
---
IIRC there is no perk for armor pen with pistols, this is going to make killing mutants and other high dr enemies quite difficult when compared to rifles or melee.
---
Obviously not, there are supermutants in this game.
---
Yeah, I've encountered this on particularly laggy troubled servers. 
---
Sometimes the whitesprings enemies spawn as eyebots instead of ghouls, and if that happens, even after the eyebots are killed and respawn as ghouls again they keep the robotic flag and legendaries explode on death. 
---
What makes it more ...exciting is that it is hard to tell what is a legendary by the name, due to diseased title covering up the legendary title on the namebar, ...so you get a bunch of booby trapped ghouls. 
---
Easy way to unexpectedly lose your junk haha
---
Assualtron helmet, bomb collar, and engineers uniform
---
Forgive me if this is obvious, but I don't see the list of Overseer Holotapes listed in the Challenges section. What sub-category is it under? Daily, Weekly, Character, Survival, Combat, Social, World
---
Also to clarify any confusion, the Side quest in question is called "Overseer's Mission" which asks you to "Follow the Overseer's journey."
---
I have completed all the steps stated at the following website and yet it still shows incomplete:
---
[https://www.vgr.com/side-quests-fallout-76-overseers-mission/](https://www.vgr.com/side-quests-fallout-76-overseers-mission/)
---
This is why I am unsure if listening to all tapes is a trigger for completion.
---
You can solo a silo. The 3 hacker perks will make it easier to solo since each section has a lvl3 terminal that controlls the ceiling turrets. Disable targeting restrictions and wait for robots to die and things to get quiet then turn em off. Move on to the next area. The only real pain is the end protecting the launch commanders. Plasma mines/nades help. As others said a good melee build will help. Good luck.
---
Pistols, melee, grenades... Sounds like you are spreading your perks kind of thin.
---
Pistols are a bit weak overall, but can be used to great effect with a vats/crit build. High luck, high agility. Better crits, grim reaper sprint, four leaf, action boy, concentrated fire. Try to find a good anti armor .44 or western revolver.
---
Melee is pretty powerful, especially 2 handed and unarmed. Unarmed doesn't work with power armor though. Max strength. Incisor, martial arts, blocker, dodgy. Twisted muscles mutation (and talons, if unarmed). Get a good super sledge (all Rise) or deathclaw or miner gauntlet. If you want ***insane*** damage, go low health. Get a bloodied weapon, a set of unyielding armor, add adrenal reactions mutation, and radicool, nerd rage perks. When your health gets down to like 30-40 hp, your damage can get upwards of 2000.
---
Yeah I'm sure nobody would figure out 100 ways to exploit that.
---
Stranger, no. Savior yes. If they bring back Miss Fortune yessss
---
Im not sure I understand your question.
---
The BOS plans are NOT like the enclave underarmor lining plans, which you get those one at a time. Enclave underarmor has 4 tiers, 1st time you see the lowest lining, buy it. 2nd time you see the slightly better version, buy it, so on and so on.
---
BOS is pretty random, I managed to get the torso and legs from plans found in the world spawn points. strangely I got both pretty close together in terms of time, might have been on the same server. 
---
I server hopped a bunch at grafton looking for the BOS arm plans, while I was hopping, I saw BOS torso and BOs leg plans once or twice, but I didnt need those so I kept hopping. Eventually the arms showed up for me.
---
Again all of that was done pre patch 5
---
Mysterious Stranger, it seems to trigger way more than in previous games, but he also does way less damage. So, he's mostly "useful" for drawing enemy attention for a few seconds. I didn't find him all that useful, though, since there are so many other useful perks in Luck. 
---
Mysterious Savior, I didn't get the card until after level 50, so at that point I wasn't dying anyway. If you don't have anything else to spend a point on, it seems like a decent safety net perk to pick, but Luck has plenty of good perks. 
---
Brutal. No accidental mutation or weird diseases? I can only assume you had some rare bug otherwise.
---
That explosive buff would be perfect for dealing with mol miners
---
They updated it quite a bit actually. They released multiple patches to fix and improve the NPCs and dialogue animation, as well as to fix bugs. The Multiplayer received a couple expansions, but they canceled all the single player DLCs which left several immenent story threads as cliffhangers. 
---
I think I've got around the same amount of hours, finished most everything. Maybe you haven't done all the quests, but when 70% are thebsame quest, just different skin you've completed them, and the other 30% of quests are just hours of grind for no reward, no one wants to bother. Maybe you haven't visited all the locations or launched the nuke but thats very easy to do in maybe one or two sessions. Hell the nuke is even easier to launch now then in the BETA and we still launched it in the like second or third BETA session. The thing that really makes me know thats the norm for why people are leaving is because its what I'm seeing and hearing. I had 20ish friends playing from the start. People quickly kept leaving, and only one plays anymore, and thats rare to see him on. Every single one of them with the exception of 2 told me they quit cause there was nothing to do, and games coming out that were actually enjoyable and had content.
---
It's better if you explore the game then ask question.
---
You have to progress in the main storyline a bit until that quest appears for you when you pick up TD
---
Should be under world, says something similar to the quest text.
---
Yep.  Need the right perks or they will drain quickly 
---
You'll regret if you get spoilers. Facts. 
---
Dude its been like a month since i have last picked up the game. Maybe longer.... went to replay wasteland 2 for my apocalypse fix
---
Besides the fact that you get a bounty put on you, thats pretty damn funny they kill themselves.
---
Love your enthusiasm, maybe in a year or so when the game is really kicking strong you'll change your mind. Don't worry, I promise nobody on reddit will miss your negativity
---
You get those too? Urges to live in a post apocalyptic world? You and me will get along just fine.
---
Last time I really played I was powering up Poseidon on a low level alt. I got an infinite load screen right at the end, after completing everything, even 100% optional stuff, 98% rad damage, no RadAway, about to restart the reactor as the timer is ticking down to the last few minutes and then an infinite load screen. Totally demoralized me and I haven't really played since.
---
Sounds cool. You got any screenshots?
---
If you feel you need convincing to play a game, perhaps you shouldn't play that game... 😕 
---
I'm PC and have just recently started to use a gauss, so I'd appreciate that ammo if you really are just giving it away! I'm not lucky enough to have a legendary so it's just a regular gauss, so a bit of extra ammo would help :) 
---
You go to I am become death to I am become waiting for the new dlc.
---
ur not so far from a sniper rifle build. Just saying, the special stats are close. Although u would have to buy the rifle perks. Just saying.
---
Also, move to anti armor explosive or bloodied. Two shot just doesnt cut the deal anymore.
---
Kek
---
I got disconnected twice last night and while farming ghouls at WS they are still lagging or disappearing altogether after a kill.  Granted, it’s better than what it was but far from a good or finished product. 
---
Sounds reasonable to me. 👍
---
Absolutely. Hit me up, THRDStooge. 
---
Ice Cold.
---
You just brought back memories.
---
Thats awesome, can concrete foundations take damage?
---
They're PvP zones so you get wanted for pvping??? The fuck kinda shit is that??
---
I have been using the Perk Loadout Manager mod for a good while now, it is very awesome. I know Bethesda has been mum on what is allowed in regards to mods, but it seems to me that anything non-cheaty should be fine. They will (should) put it in eventually.
---
no!  you did not just say that!! lol
---
Yeah frankly I'm done. This game sucks. I have enough materials to repair something but the game wont let me unless I have at least one more of each item than what is required. That's fucking stupid. So is paying to fast travel, what a cab is picking me up ? Do you pay to run some place ? And by the way nerds who know nothing about firearms, they dont break constantly and having them do so in the game is very pointless. I dont understand why they ruined fallout, what was wrong with it the way it was ? You made money and people actually liked it. 76 is a joke and the rest of the industry is making fun of you for selling us this farce
---
except they haven't been dealt with.
---
Gt: Amazing Viper X
---
I think it's more that the two handed animations would cause massive clipping in third person, so they made new one handed animations.
---
Wait there’s an actual storyline?
---
My TSE should never have been pushing 700+dmg.  Now it’s around 250-300 fully perked, which basically means I can one or two shot just about everything other than a scorchbeast or SBQ.  Same thing with my 2 shot Gauss.  It’s still about 3 bills on dmg. 
---
You actually got it to work? I’m literally building an [airplane camp](https://imgur.com/gallery/3K0INxK) and I’d love to not have to use floating foundations. Can you share a pic of it in use?
---
Not sure what u mean. The pvp system is lacking fairness in mechanics. Yes, but it definetly is fun and it works in its own ways.
---
U do have choices though. Just ignore and run. 
---
U do not have an option with a camp griefer.
---
I primarily play pvp (Not griefing), but if a player doesn't shoot back to initiate the pvp, then I could do nothing but slap damage, which is extremely boring.
---
If PvP is intentional why the hell do you get wanted? Sounds very dumb 
---
Game is buggy as shit. I finally did the ghoul hord forest 4 location one, and found nothing an any location. During with I tried two other events that produced nothing, and I found Charley Moo Moo. The "cow" was just standing on the bridge in Charleston facing the railing. I could hear Graham, but he was nowhere to be found. Looked for about 20 minutes before i gave up on him.
---
&gt;I didn't "destroy workshops". I paid the caps to claim the workshop and the turrets fired on me.
---
Exactly what happened to me
---
molerats!  another creature i hate.  made fun of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ar34l6/how_about_a_fallout_76_hoedown/)
---
It would still make those effects too powerful. They are perfectly ok as they are
---
Andromeda was an abomination.  I’m still in therapy over that game 
---
so no hoedowns, huh?  none of yins musically inclined?
---
I am wanted. Does that remove player icons?
---
Yes but no clue how to get them on here from PS4... Should log in on statement and try.
---
FFS, that's a ridiculous bug. And if you've handed in before and pick up a few, does it happen then as well??
---
Ha, I got a quad double barrel thats awesome. and a quad handmade. I burn through so many shells with the DB, id hate to see how fast id do it with the combat shotgun
---
😂
---
Nicely done. Which platform did you make it on?
---
Oh yeah. I was a big cold war nerd because my grandpa didnt talk about his time in vietnam.... so being a nosey little shit when i was younger i researched. Found out why grandpa didnt talk about vietnam. Of course my enlisting got him talking about it. But reading about vietnam filtered into learning about all of the advances on the battlefield... i mean we still use coldwar technology today. Kinda beautiful in all of its primitive glory. Enjoying the cold war of course has the end of the world to go with. Wasteland and fallout. I have been researching a paper and pencil game in the same vein called twilight 2000. I got a kick out of all the maintenance hours vehicles and weapons require even in the end of days. Also plan on attending wasteland weekend as a 1980s post apoc combat medic
---
I support this so my son's vats/crit based character can be used again so maybe he'll want to play again. My melee character running in PA next to his in a queen fight used 0 Fusion Cores and he would be complaining about having drained five and need me to trade him another so he could keep on fighting. It is definitely not working properly.
---
No kidding one time I got frozen at WS golf club and when I returned it was a full on massacre- on me. Then I lost a bunch of loot and basically got my ass kicked a couple of more times in the process.  That was earlier on in the game for me but I never log off out of PA and certainly not at WS as it is a recipe for disaster 
---
Dupes have only been temporarily dealt with, Bethesda's purge only got rid of highly duped items but seemingly didn't get rid of all items that were duped only things they deemed at the time.
---
E.g.. nuka grape dupes were mass purged and are gone but according to sources on here there's people still walking around with untold thousands of nuka cola still.
---
Bethesda still hasn't patched all the duplication methods either so it won't take the dupers long to dupe all the items lost again so we'll be back to square one in a month.
---
What should have happened in this purge  was all dupe items culled to one per player and all suspected accounts banned 
---
Damn. Haha. Would have totally wanted to come over and see it if you were on PS4 and free at the same time as me.
---
In what way have they been dealt with?
---
I read this all in Nick Offerman's voice. 
---
Yep
---
Ok sure, maybe 4 perk slots is more reasonable, but explosive shot damage being moved to 6.022x10^23 is super reasonable
---
Since you're rageplying to a three month old post, I'd start with myself before raging at someone else.
---
Become death upon other players 
---
There is already an [Android app for FO4](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.falloutcompanionapp&amp;hl=en_GB).. (I assume there is also an Apple one too...)  
---
Surprised an FO76 app hasn't been craeted yet.. 
---
PS4 😰
---
Shh, Bethesda doesn’t know that. Now let me get my buff on
---
I'm entertaining my little girl at the moment, but I'll be on around 19:00 GMT (approx 3 hours). Will you be around then? 
---
Genius :)
---
May I suggest your next study to be [castle neuschwanstein](https://goo.gl/images/BwAzeR)?
---
True, I do still have 8763 Moldy food
---
Got it it’s just called plane engine generator? 
---
What system do you play on?
---
Doesnt a Scorchbeast gas attack do Rad dmg? I belive there is a mutation that turns Rads into healing.
---
VATS does not currently play nicely with Power Armor, and Jet Packs are a bit power hungry anyhow.
---
If you've been struggling, I'd bet you're a VATS user, and there's a thread on this issue (which I'll try to find and will come back and edit in).
---
As a non-VATS user, I really don't find drain an issue, and I even keep the Batteries Included perk slotted to deal with the weight of the 20+ cores I carry at all times.
---
Well I did a full silo on a single full one without perks last night so idk
---
May I suggest your next study to be [castle neuschwanstein](https://www.divergenttravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/edit-0023-compressor-1200x900.jpg)?
---
Reposted, automoderator didnt like the google search link for some reason
---
Ghoulish
---
Avogadro says yes.
---
Pity the moles.
---
I totally agree. I'm glad there's still people out there willing to deal with the bugs and still enjoying the game. Sometimes I wonder why I even go on this sub  (thanks to all the complaints and claims of renouncing the game) Good to see another tried and true Fallout fan, I salute you sir. 
---
Sure. What's your character name? Want to make sure I give it to the right person. I'd rather pass on these rounds to a Gauss user than letting them de-spawn in some train station container. Also if you need me to mod your Gauss I learned a few.
---
No. It's not a 'plane engine generator'. It's the wind generator.
---
No way should you have to use a lot of ammo in silo watch this for pointers  https://youtu.be/FkK4KEob-yU and add me if u want help with sbq still 👍 psn mjesticbattlecat
---
I usually make very short work of the Queen.  Just 5 shoots does it for me.  But the scorched queen was so much tankier than the other queens I have fought in the past.  I’m using a TSE shotgun and had reload about 9 to 10 times. 
---
I can't view posts to reply for some reason, guy who calls bullshit on me playing for months.....yeah the game has been put for 3 months....... So would you say that's more than 1???  Dipshit.  You guys need to stop falling on the sword for this game, I liked it too, oh and also played every beta event, easily MONTHS of play!
---
I wish it was, that would be so awesome and I'd be all in on that :P But I think only the endurance-perk "ghoulish" does this.
---
Damn I am xbox. 
---
Must be great fun to be so pessimistic in life... I get that you are disappointed with the game and all its bugs. But complaining about future content that may or may not be buggy is so useless.
---
Drifter outfit all the way❤️ before that I wore the ratty skirt.😍
---
Oh weird I think I have that already will have to check appreciate it!
---
 No problem.
---
&gt;when I lost hundreds of caps at the munitions factory against 3 players with TSE
---
Sounds thrilling
---
Iuse auto exp combat rifle an grenades for all scorched creatures around fight and then furious handmade and bloodied gatling for actula sbq damage. But having a good melee if you dont have expl for floor creatures is just as good but will wreck your ap wothout action boy/girl. Use fireproof for negating some of bitch scream attack damage and all relevant perks for weapon damage 👍
---
Wasting time in whitesprings, trying to get better weapons...
---
Making/collecting weapons dedicated for every situation..
---
Instigating 308 for one shot one kill or higher level enemies
---
Two-shot .50 cal receiver sniper rifle for mid level/prolonged fights.
---
Zealot prime receiver 308 rifle for SBQ
---
Quad lever action for mid level enemies
---
Quad combat shotgun for low/mid level enemies
---
Tesla shotgun for large groups...
---
And well, it takes quite a bit of work to get 1k ammo for each of them. 
---
Other than that i'm trying to get more camp plans, planning on planting every single crop near my camp, working on my second and third power armor sets.
---
Oh and how could i forget, i get to walk from whitesprings to watoga -&gt; ferry vendors since i'm carrying too much junk so i can't sprint anymore... And yeah it takes a while.
---
Reached level 100 today.
---
DAMN! Awesome! How do they do this?
---
Everyone has a reason why they keep at it...personally, I'm playing and hoping they will eventually fix the game... so much potential.  It's really routine at this point, but it is distracting from real life, and no new amazing games out.
---
Thank you my tag is Darthvetter189
---
There's always work arounds for this, such as being able to destroy peoples stash and it'll drop the loot inside. This would further convince people to actually raid bases and camps. And you don't have to pick everything of the guys corpse. Also I don't really understand the 1St part you said? If you start over you won't have the perks you had in adventure mode so it wouldn't matter? 
---
I want that!
---
Yes please. 
---
Right? I mean it half way seems like it's more so just a mission sequence to show you around and get you to the silos. Not exactly what you'd expect for a "story line" but it's what we got so I just rolled with it
---
Incisor is required for all melee builds IMO.   
---
Those would be great for weekly or monthly challenges.  Might be a little too challenging for a daily.
---
I’d go with your 2nd choice.
---
You must be the luckiest person alive in the whole f#$king universe to find that amount of rare af items that are rng rolled in that particular order.
---
Also finding 9074 nuka colas? Love to know where you found them all.
---
OR
---
These items are the product of duping 
---
I'm in of the opinion that it is the latter tbh lol
---
Radaway is my problem.... fuckin rads man...
---
I might take you up on that! I've only come across / scrapped a few gauss in-game, so I only know a couple of mods. I think I've got swift capacitors, but that's about it. Wouldn't mind a suppressor, if you have the skills :D
---
I'm Hip-Hoppopotamus in game 👍 
---
Thanks. 
---
The holotapes that start quests already have an indicator next to them...?
---
It's not meant to work that way, so these people have no clue what they are talking about. Though they have said they are fixing a bug that people get accidentally wanted for a stray bullet hitting a player building or whatever. Maybe that will fix it.
---
Anytime. 
---
or (worst case) expand the sort to be a sort by date / time obtained
---
I'm sorry, my English is very bad. 
---
I wanted to say that after looking for bos combat armor arms mod you took the others that appeared in the points, style raider biocom or metal cushioned legs or others like that, or you just saw them and changed server to catch only bos combat arms. If you are looking for a plan you only take that plane or the ones that appear to you while that one comes out. 
---
By the way, in grafton? at what point? I do server hop in eastern penintenciary and I do not know if I get the ones that come out or just bos mods. Thank you very much for answering, really
---
one of your team mates may have been sharing rad sponge?
---
"We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player, and they may drop their Aid **or other items** in addition to their Junk."
---
Yeah that’s my build, and it definitely gets exciting! I die a lot. I literally have to give my teammates stimpacks so that they will continue reviving me, lol. But yeah when the other sounds fade out and you hear your heart pumping, the nerd rage animation triggers and you’re one shotting lvl 68 supermutants as they swarm you, definitely gets your blood pumping. And then you die and lose all your junk!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Suppressor I didn't learn unfortunately but I was planning on crafting and scrapping a few this week. Hopefully I get lucky.
---
Unfortunately the same connections and interactions you had here can be had on tons of far better and more enjoyable online games.
---
Unfortunately. And in comparison, 90% of players I met totally ignored my existence OR shot me in the face.
---
I just think it needs to be redesigned. Attacking a player repeatedly that doesn't want to PVP should make you either wanted or force pacifist mode for 1 hour. In a workshop though should be no penalty for anything pvp.....
---
You have aspergers and can't identify blatantly obvious satire.
---
Because VATS is in real-time now, Mysterious Stranger is pretty funny when you're playing with someone else who has it.  You're fighting and suddenly, this guy dressed like the Vault-Tec Rep shows up and starts shooting, and vanishes just as quickly. 😂
---
I’m not sure about that. It seems any time I go to the golf course, empty or it, those high level ghouls are there. But like I said I’m still relatively new. I’m still learning how things work
---
I found one just the other day in watoga and i think i saw one before at the vendor in harpers ferry
---
I think this is my issue. I need to get some new cards and swap them out with the survival ones. 
---
I was constantly needing FCs early on. Then I started parking my butt at the Posiden plant. Then I got a perk card for longer lasting FCs. I've got over a hundred now. I have to keep dumping them in the trash with lots of ammo just to keep my weight down. So if you go by the train yard by Posiden, you're welcome.
---
Both brick door frames have this problem for me, as well.
---
I can identify blatent satire but wasn't 100% sure if he was being serious or not lol
---
I questioned that decision too, (I started reddit because of fo76) but Go take a look at r/ResidentEvil2Remake.
---
Posting a picture or video kind of makes the whole page messy, since it shows the picture directly on the main page. I dont know, thats just my opinion. I do like how this sub is displayed with the titles only, but it makes uploading pictures a pain in the ass.
---
No no no, killing you with slap damage would be worth the 10 cap bounty I would gain as a result of murder.
---
I have made this post 3 months before the game came out:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/96ns18/charater_configuration_slots/
---
When we learned about howe perks would work after GamesCon last summer, I immeditately thought that we would have to change them a lot and feared Bethesda would not think of that. I started my post with the words
---
&gt;Please Bethesda, I hope you have thought of that.
---
It is such an obvious thing with this kind of system. SInce the game was released, so many people asked for that here on reddit, in official Beth forums, on youtube and it's very simple to do. And yet: nothing. 
---
I admire your positive thinking, though.
---
 That will be max level. 
---
Pistols are practically useless without a focus on crit VATS.
---
Thanks.
---
I lost 70 of them this way. Didn't know I was starting the quest, otherwise I would have stashed them :/
---
To be fair, if he’s been playing the game long enough. It’s not that hard to save up nuke colas if you aren’t drinking them. There literally everywhere.
---
Yeah, when you cap a workshop for fast travel and plans, you have to keep that in the back of your mind. Teammates of people who tried to cap your workshop are also hostile.
---
How is it an 'unfair advantage normal players don't have' when anyone can make a new character to be a 'mule' , yourself included??
---
I think the only whining in this thread is from you.
---
It adds scorch dmg to any weapon it is applied too. Making it the weapon of choice for killing the queen.
---
Yeah, after you get the quest for them, you can only ever have one of them, no matter how many you pick up.
---
I started reddit just for Fo76, so I just didn't get how to do it. (Cause it showed the options, but had the 🚫 symbol.) Whatever works. :)
---
Yeah.  Up to the point where I started using BoS Combat Armor, I had that look.  I thought it was neat, because every piece told a story about where I got it.  I still have a Metal piece on an arm.
---
Ok. I see the "Find the Overseer's PErsonal Journal Holotapes (6/6)" and the quest is still incomplete. So I guess it's not because of the Holotapes.
---
I’m level 28 and haven’t even done the Missing Link. 
---
Lol so I’m assuming worthless haha
---
Hey. ESAD....
---
I've been thinking about this issue for a while...for me, if they'd just increase the number/type of enemies at least in the eastern region of the map would be a big boost to interest/play.
---
I think he's referring to alt characters on the same acct ,not whole new games and accts.
---
But ,yes his argument is stupid. 
---
the workshop at lakeside cabins has a lead deposit as well. there are 3 just east of top of the world that run along the ridge line heading south. 
---
So if I pick up a second one it's basically disappeared??
---
Is there a workaround?
---
Ammo isn't cheap, and I can usually deal more damage with a diff weapon.
---
There is railroading and spoon feeding and having an interactive movie at two different ends of the spectrum. While I prefer the interactive movie ish side don't Bog it down in dialog. 
---
The invisibility doesn’t stack but the stealth boost does. I run a full stealth setup with maxed out stealth, stealth armor mods and chameleon armor and thus far i can even crouch sometimes and even when im in danger or caution the npc still cant hit me.
---
I assume because of some kind of accuracy debuff from me being stealth but i find it very useful to run multiple chameleon pieces, you could even switch out the stealth perk cards and wear chameleon armor and have the same amount of stealth.
---
Basically a full set of armor will give you about the same stealth rating as a fully upgraded sneak card.
---
Heck yeah. 💞
---
I thought Kabuki theatre
---
It is either damage or damage resistance.  Only ran into fog crawlers once a week ago. So don't remember which boost it gives.
---
Ok thanks ill get on acquiring those pieces now . 
---
I don't tend to keep nuka colas for long, I either drink them or turn them into grenades 
---
It’s definitely not that, I have high functioning Aspergers and genuinely laughed out loud lol 😂😂😂
---
Yeah it’s freaking stupid.

This would be amazing,  but I'm not sure how it'd work with items with multiple components... 
---
You seem fun.
---
That would have been awesome......if I had done that 40 levels ago. Lol. Now I don't know what I've have.
---
Exactly.
---
I don’t think there’s a work around since it turns technical data into a unique quest item that you can’t stash.
---
It’s a very retarded design especially since we have treasure maps that work in a better way.
---
If anything treasure maps should be a unique one time thing.

Correct, and there's no workaround. You'd have to go turn in the one you have, and then go back and grab the second one.
---
It's tedious.
---
A few days ago, I was messing around with Fallout 4.  I had apparently left off at Railroad HQ.  Drummer Boy comes running up to me saying Desdemona needs something.  Shaun starts ranting about the future.  Mr. Timms updates me on the safehouse situation yet again.  Whoever my companion was just starts babbling.
---
It really struck me how much I *didn't* miss this in 76.  Everyone's got their canned little phrases that I've heard a hundred times before.  It doesn't make the world feel more immersive or authentic.  It continually reminds me that I'm dealing with automatons with a very limited number of things to say.
---
I crafted it same as the coat.ill check what it is under later and update for you.
---
I don't think he made much of a difference, no. 😉
---
Why did you buy both a PC, and Console version, and are continuously complaining about the game?
---
Very nice. I feel like it's asking for trouble not having eye-protection and a mouth covering. Dunno that it'd do much good though. 
---
People who solo raids in wow, I must have soloed MC 100 times and still 7/8. I was never to wear a helm I suppose.
---
Why not?
---
That's daft :/ Still, at least now I know. Thanks man.
---
&gt;and changed server to catch only bos combat arms.
---
Yes, if it wasnt a plan I wanted, I didnt pick it up.
---
&gt;If you are looking for a plan you only take that plan
---
Yes
---
&gt;the way, in grafton? at what point?
---
The BOS plans would appear at the two vendors (rarely). One at grafton train station, the other vendor in the city. The vendors apparently are not working properly since the last patch.
---
&gt;I do server hop in eastern penintenciary and I do not know if I get the ones that come out or just bos mods.
---
If you find a plan sitting on a table, and you pick it up, nothing will appear on that table for another 20 hours (estimated).
---
 If you do not pick it up, you can server hop, and see if a different plan will appear. Sometimes nothing will be there, thats pretty typical, but you can keep hopping to see if something different will appear.
---
Im not sure what is supposed to spawn at the penitentiary, but some regions of the map spawn certain types of plans.
---
I found both the BOS torso and legs in the cranberry bog- one in the trainyard east of watoga, the other in the glassed cavern.
---
Marine armor? Did they just release a new skin 
---
When I was lvl 8 I went on a trek through to cranberry bog. As I was entering through the Greensprings Estate bottom entrance I saw a sentry bot, behemoth, all the Greensprings robots and a scorchbeast fighting to the death. I had to go into a janitors shed to survive it.
---
Do Bloated and Glowing Ghouls have armor to bypass with Incisor?
---
&gt; Makes me kind of wonder why people still don't continue to do it; it seems clear that most people still want to farm White Springs.
---
Whitesprings glowing ones' EXP rewards are nerfed on a certain patch, that's why.
---
How about when the quest is complete, un-marking quest items as essential. So they can be dropped?
---
 That's Combat Armor only. You have to click on it and it will tell you what it does.
---
I mean the Unstoppables outfits have you a health boost when they first came out but that ended about a week ago or two. I haven’t really touched the game since
---
I've been thinking about that too.  How infrequent it is to see players in The Mire or Cranberry Bog outside of Harper's Ferry or Watoga.  Few players make repeated treks down the freeway there, presumably because A: they don't want to deal with Scorchbeasts and B: there's a whole not of nothing in between.
---
Something I think they should consider is having a second vendor, tied into the Harper's Ferry pool, at the northern end of the Mire.  Right now, outside of workshops, there is almost zero reason to go to that region of the map once you've explored it.  The opposite corner in the southwest is similar.
---
Deselect those quests if you want a pretty photo.
---
Then everything else should get buffed too. Why should TS/E/TSE be the most powerful things because those once were? And TSE still is top tier.
---
People seem to think i enjoy griefing others or go around destroying CAMPs. I’m actually a super friendly player and haven’t had anyone destroy my CAMP that’s in a very accessible area. I’ve had a lot of fun interactions at my CAMP and other players CAMPs. 
---
With that said, it is a “feature “ to destroy others CAMPs. There’s even a perk card that lets you do
---
more damage. 
---
But whatever, keep downvoting me because some whiners gotta collect some junk to repair his CAMP. 
---
In atomic store,  they offer skins for armor.
---
Crap.  What a waste of atoms.
---
Even adding a * in front would help. It would move them all to the top.
---
I don't think they have as much damage resistance as other things, but you're probably going to venture out of Whitesprings at some point, no? If you're tackling a silo or a Scorchbeast queen, plenty of those enemies have strong damage resistance. 
---
An inspiration to all homeless boats everywhere.
---
I reacted to the ending of your post. Fallout is supposed to this and that. My comment is more to that then the rest of the post. 
---
Im also very happy about the changes coming. 
---
I just see(you probably do too) alot of people complaining on the lack of content when there is lots stuff out there to discover. Just because they dont notice it doesnt mean its not there. 
---
Just saying if really dig into it. (Like you probably have too) Theres alot more than 14 hours of fun.
---
Didnt mean to offend hope this clarifies that abit.
---
Im just saying, there is nothing more thrilling than blowing someones house up and waiting for someone to take your head off while "wanted". I always go back to the houses i blow up and ask if i can give them the repairs but most people just server hop immediately. Sometimes i want to pvp but i dont want to be a complete ass about it.
---
Also take note the better looking the house, the less likely i will blow it up. 
---

---
Some.   But why do a build for just Whitedprings?   
---
Have you tried class freak 3 with adrenal reaction  plus nerd rage 3, unyielding, and a low-health build.  My character one-hit-kills all ghouls just using one-star ghoul-slaying knuckles using a low-health build.   Six perk points plus one mutation and a little time finding unyielding armor over on F76 market makes optimal melee damage.  
---
The Wasteland really took a toll on her huh? 
---
First I'd start with double checking the code just to make sure all the characters are correctly inputed. If it still dosen't work then I'd open a support ticket with Bethesda about it while sending them a screenshot of the Amazon FAQ on invalid codes that says to contact the publisher.
---
Oh damn. I've been throwing out copies of maps I'd already collected.
---
I used to have my camp next to that boat. Be ready for lots of visits from super mutants, scorched, and mongrel dogs.
---
Once you exhaust the story quests, there are basically two things left to do:
---
1) You can try to maximize your character's power, crafting and equipment. This mostly requires farming the scorchbeast queen fight (she drops some unique plans) and some other locations. 
---
2) I like to try to explore every spot on the map - meaning, unlocking every quick travel location. When you're lower level, and a bunch of things can kill you, it's obviously tougher to poke around everywhere. And while this obviously isn't a traditional Fallout game, they have still put plenty of neat little stories and experiences in there. (One that comes to mind - Check out the catapults at Johnson's Acre, which is in the far southern-middle of the map.)

I don't know the technical side to making apps or anything but people port console games to pc and port android games to pc and even pc mods for fo76 have been ported from fo4 so it can be that difficult for them to do.
---
I just want the ability to trade the duplicate perks I keep getting from perk packs for ones I can actually use.
---
How about removing them as items all together and giving me a codex that I can access them all from?

Saw this in person, I was the piano playing ghost.
---
DUUUUUUR
---
There isn’t any. The primed receiver deals the same damage as a hardened receiver. You then have to use prime ammo which is very costly to make and only gives you bonus damage to scorched. I wouldn’t recommend any prime receiver and I think I’ve unlocked all and none compare to the hardened in terms of ammo to damage ratio
---
I have a vampires buzz blade with electric mod that’s does 60 damage per hit and it tears through everything, all while healing me. Better than all rise in my opinion.
---
You could try this build, which sounds close to what you want. I am not sure I am sold on it, but....give it a shot. If you're level 110 you probably have enough picks left to do some adjusting.

Try the tougher areas like whitespring Harper's and watoga..u may need to server hop to get them to have weapons at ur level
---
But what level?
---
I lucked out; had enough dkp to get my helm and then legs from an ony kill same day
---
I agree. Demo expert perk should be changed to a 3 star card, like gunslinger, rifleman, slugger, etc. Obviously, it should be changed to cap at 20% to go along with that. Then add expert and master level 3 star perks that also add 20% each. (And do the same for iron fist).
---
I want this!  Great idea.  
---
Hahaha maybe that's working as intended then
---
30 or 40 not sure, have to check when I get home.
---
Thx!
---
&gt;If you find a plan sitting on a table, and you pick it up, nothing will appear on that table for another 20 hours (estimated).
---
&gt;If you do not pick it up, you can server hop, and see if a different plan will appear. Sometimes nothing will be there, thats pretty typical, but you can keep hopping to see if something different will appear.
---
 that's what I was referring to, because I did not know whether to take the other plans or go one at a time as I am interested. thank you very much now I know that I only have to take one.
---
&gt;The BOS plans would appear at the two vendors (rarely). One at grafton train station, the other vendor in the city. The vendors apparently are not working properly since the last patch.
---
I hope fixed it in the next patch although I also hope to get them before haha
---
&gt;Im not sure what is supposed to spawn at the penitentiary, but some regions of the map spawn certain types of plans.
---
Im know only in armor workbench, although it is broken and it does not look good, and appear leather, metal, raider, mods...but rare armor combat.
---
Thx!!
---
Wow nicely done, one of the nicest camps I have seen.
---
No idea. The only unique thing that happened was that the Hemlock Holes cook somehow got chased over to the HH Maintenance workshop right after I took it over. Just as he left the workshop after I finished the defend mission, he triggered the quest and every time I'd complete it, he re-triggered it a minute later.
---
cool!
---
Yeah there is a point where you feel like your getting mobbed more often than not . He is useful for around 20 levels around that 30-50 mark. Quickly after 50 you find the need disappear. 
---
Why waste points on adamantium skeleton, when you are using PA?
---
Talk to amazon, they most likely than not will just refund you out of good will.
---
Yeah this, you need ultra cite and flux to make the ammo and you don't get a lot of it, as soon as I saw this, I said forget it. Flux is a pain to get at the best of times.
---
I was alone :) I always am, sadly. I never managed to get the few friends I have to join me in playing F76 because of the raging bad reviews, almost 500 hours in and still just a lone wanderer :P
---
Reddit advertisement.
---
welcome to mmo-ish game. grind for gear. What game has endless content?
---
My current weapon for dealing heavy damage is the plasma Gatling. However it fucking breaks after about 1 or 2 battles. Usually can drop 1 queen with it. So I carry a furious plasma Gatling as well as a prime plasma Gatling. Both are level 50. I was battling 2 level 50 SB’s yesterday. Dropped one with the furious, it broke. Then dropped the other with the prime. I can honestly say the one I dropped with the prime went down twice as fast. Which makes sense as there is supposed to be a damage modifier for scorched. 
---
Wow this was exactly the kind of answer i was looking for, thank you so much.
---
With how expensive items are and because everyone plays differently I think it's good to have easy daily and weekly challanges that you may get just for playing without even looking at items
---
However, adding more challanges that are more difficult would be great as long as it doesn't take away the easy ones. 
---
I want this just to make a sign about how unnecessary this is.
---
Good to know, thanks for the link.
---
Option 2 for sure going all in on the slugger perk points is inefficient in terms of damage to perk point. Especially if you only have 6 strength to work with 
---
Happens to me near top of the world i farm for shells cause of the mole miners recently its been empty no corpse and then ill turn around and then the hell swarm arives
---
I don't play a VATS build, but doesn't Four Leaf Clover make Critical Savvy much less valuable? I would have thought you'd use one or the other.
---
Also I think the queen is harder to kill since they nerfed all the TSE weapons. Setting off the nuke is half the fun, I would nuke other places like MorganTown and/or WhiteSpring for best results or just pick a spot for the heck of it .. once you guys level up either join some other queen events or just try again, people generally will show up at queen events, but not always. Also nuking places like white spring or morgantown allows you to level up quicker than normal if you farm the areas.
---
Same on ps4
---
I know he implies in the silo, but I think they burnt there ammo on the queen
---
That area seems to be bad for that. I'm at the Red Rocket mega stop and it constantly just has dead bodies. But if I take a few steps over into the mire it's random mobs, usually of Mirelurk Kings.
---
No no no, because then you wouldn't have lucky bastards like me who find a suitcase with 28 50% cores a day after crafting his lv45 excavator armour!
---
Anti armor reduces an enemies damage reduction. Energy weapons aren't affected by damage resistance. Doesn't seem like a bug.
---
They already confirmed moding is coming calm down bud
---
Something wrong with your connection 
---
sometimes I have to wait about 30 seconds and it’ll show up. Have you waited?
---
Actually in the silo. We messed up repairing the mainframe and fought probably 200 robots before we got it fixed after that we tried to fight the Queen and we were spent and there was only 4 of us
---
Looks like one rude awakening! 
---
Talk to Sony they the biggest bitch against it.
---

---
They’re actually fine with it now, thanks to the backlash, but Bethesda just hasn’t even mentioned it since the BETA, where they said this stuff would be considered after the BETA.
---
I believe that’s the dream of every multi platform mmo game. I don’t know of even one that allows all platforms to interact with each other. Blizzard said D3 would do just that and still nothing.

Yes, Starched Genes, LUCK, available at L30, has two levels.
---
I can literally go through 3-4 pr. I hour as I'm a heavy gatling laser user in power armor.

Another thing you can do to conserve ammo is take melee or use melee weapons instead .. just take a bunch of super sledges and only use ammo when needed.
---
It is funny how the most basic things are so overlooked in this game!
---
It just works
---
Thanks for your idea. I will promptly put in a message to the team for a hardened receivers nerf!
---
With about 27 Charisma and the discounts given from  grape mentats and hard bargainer I was only able to drop the price of the t51b jet pack plans around 500 caps. The way we stacked Ch was, being in a full team with someone sharing magnetic for +6 ch, having full Ch armor on (didn't have under armor though) eating a sweet role for the Ch buff, a beer with a friend sharing party boy/girl, hard bargainer max card, and grape mentats. I I think having a full set of Unyielding (anything) to push your ch up might be better for selling and buying. 
---
It works just fine, but the brick one is reversed 
---
They have an advantage for Energy Weapons currently, since they don't have damage increasing receivers/capacitors. Prime time is the only way to currently beef them up.
---
There's a handful of other weapons in similar boats (The 50 call think?). It also makes any gun with it MELT anything with "Scorched" in it's name. Especially if it's fully auto or super high single shot damage.
---
And stop us from picking up multiples of the same note/key/holotape!
---
Sort by date!
---
Do casuals close doors? 
---
Yeah actually
---
the bethesda launcher should keep it up to date. you shouldnt need to update it manually.
---
Use the Bethesda portal to fire up your game. It should update automatically.  
---
I crashed at whitesprings last night, log back in to a nuke zone.  somehow I managed to pull up my hot bar that has my rad suit on and get it equipped before taking but a very modest amount of radiation.  I haven't been able to do this before.  I still had spinning refresh icons for loot and empty 3 star drops, so I dont know whats up...this game is a mess LOL
---
Overseer's mission... Ugh... All of the overseer's holotapes show the diamond next to them, yet they aren't in order, and now I've got a "Follow the Overseer's mission" that doesn't show anything on the map as to where to go!
---
I've listened to them all over and over... nothing new has shown up.
---
What is the chronological order then?
---
I mean...you can't really know. I can't tell you how many times I've DC'd (full on crashed) on my way back to my loot at fissure prime during or after a SBQ fight. I'm usually solo so no way to rejoin server. Junk Loot becomes fair-game If it's sitting in a dirty bag on the ground.  Usually if folks are lingering near it it's implied that you shouldn't scavenge it.

&gt; Events should restart faster if not instantly on demand by users. What's  the point of an event cooldown? To make people wait to farm? They don't  wait, they server hop. Stop making them wait and they'll stop server  hopping. Maybe they'll even stay on a server long enough to get to know  each other. 
---
Because it is a community event not a (insert specific player's demand) event
---
How about, like in fo4 with the bobblehead stand, a cartridge display case that you can put them into after listened to/finished quest.
---
Don't really want them to be dropped and a player pick them up out of order.
---
Haha, reminds me of the Thunder Cats base.

The second one. But a lot of people will use the first one and not understand why they don't get responded to. 
---
Case in point this reply from r/Fallout complaining about being called toxic by players:
---
&gt; who rightfully thinks Fallout 76 (or even 4) is shit, that means   we're"toxic" or "negative" people. Now I know not all of you guys are   snotty little kids by any means, but I'm just so sick of seeing people   suck off Bethesda and rip on anyone who hates them by saying 
---
They do not see the irony or the connection to them acting like that and people calling them toxic. Nor the irony of calling other people snotty little kids while acting like one. 
---
I think that’s the expression made when I ready my weapon.
---

---
The patch wasn't just for removing duped items they also patched the server code, server side for this exact reason. And obviously based on all the reports it seems they actually did a good job.
---
Really? I mean I suppose. I always hit it up for the sodas you can't find around the world namely everything but the regular nukas, cherry nukas, and nuka quantums. I didn't assess how much of a net loss that is other than having 31 caps to recoup at the end of buying them all.
---
Almost at 30 of each nukas. I think carrying any more than that impacts my carry weight too much to be worth it.
---
I'm glad they announced the wild Appalachia reveal good to see the server stability increasing (about time) hope to see a lot more pve events and power armor and weapons skins. As well as other new items and outfits
---
Not everyone is an articulate mfker that can afford or has access to all that fancy stuff.
---
Makes me picture Charlie from Willy Wonka running around singing ‘I got a golden ticket’.  
---
I always like dropping legendaries for lower levels
---
And just to clarify, you need the second level! 
---
Although I'm sad it's had the effect of ruining the reputation of this game, I, for one, love their screeching tantrums about how they deserve more out of a product that updates itself for free indefinitely. I mean... I get why they are upset for sure. Because I have a lot of the same complaints But the way they express those complaints is just ... fascinating. It's like watching the monkeys at the zoo fling poo at each other.
---
Nocturnal coffee cup, nice. 
---
This did get me wondering, though, why someone carrying a piece of the nuke launch code walks around with that distinctive sound, advertising to any in the area that he is there. Isn't the point of having a code, and breaking up the pieces of the code, to make it HARD to solve the code and launch nukes? But instead each guy with a piece of that code is walking around sounding like one of the pots in your dishwasher. 
---
I was playing the game since day 1 aswell, and managed to complete all the content I wanted in like...3 weeks I think? I only count PvE stuff though, and I only killed scorchbeast queen like 2 times, since there's no point in getting stronger as I already have killed the one and only boss in game.

QoL updates are welcome, but there's 0 new content so far. If these missions won't add any vaults or new locations/changes to old locations, this so called new content is a joke.
---
Give me some meaning to grind, Bethesda. Currently there's none (if you are not into PvP or building homes). 
---
They are nerfing dishwashers now?
---
The launcher not only auto-updates, but has a button to check your version number, which automatically confirms you have the latest version. 
---
Steam is an evil rent-seeking company. Enjoy not using it for this game.
---
So I didn't ever end up even close to that much weight, but I frequently end up with stash limit issues. Honestly, if you're not using it and it's not legendary, scrap it. Sell the lower level legendary gear to vendors. Post for cap trades the better legendary stuff. Scrap wise, just cut cut cut. I try not to drop too much stuff, but have used over a thousand leather and wood at a time just to make boards which I then scrapped, rebuilt and scrapped. Easy grab at some safe exp. Screws, springs and plastic are all fairly easy to sell or trade. You'll have to go without some stuff so bulk what you can and drop the easy to find stuff. Meds are great to sell to vendors and even sometimes can sell on the trade forums. Good luck.
---
No. I did say something once at one and he went back and closed them all. But generally I would come home door open and rodents inside
---
id like weapon skins, and for them to be useable on all weapons.
---
If you're really trying to get it up you can get 15 total perk points in Charisma then add Magnetic Personality hard bargain and unyielding armor five pieces and you can get it up to like 30-35 with food
---
Its a glitch, if you log out while in the excavator power armor and log back in, you have +100 carrg weight
---
They’re the kind of hate comments that achieve no purpose and have no place in a discussion group, imo.
---
Steel workers hat/outfit/welding goggles with a pipe wrench. Because Appalachia needs more gun. 
---
I joined a server to kill the scorchbeast queen but they had actually just finished before I could teleport in time. Then 3 guys offered to play with me and kill queens all night. 
---
This has been a big that had been patched and broken again. Bethesda says to exit your power armor, remove all parts, exit the game, re enter, place power armor back down, replace armor pieces, get in. It should work after that, if not then who knows.
---
We can have both. A lot of these events need to be initiated by a player anyway (Uranium Fever). Reducing the cooldown just means more events and more chances for everyone to participate. Right now what's happening is that 90% or more of the server hops I do have the event on cooldown and I just keep hopping until I find an open one, then I rush through it before someone else can finish it.
---
Actual cool fallout style things, and not pretty pink princess shit
---
+2
---
Worked for me!

Placed a campfire in one of the corners and with some fiddling it fits. Then I hid it with the walls :) 
---
If I could set at uranium fever and just keep doing it with no cool down I would have every legendary I want by now. This is not a good idea.
---
Bethesda did actually have a company make nucha cola quantum a few years ago you can actually find some on eBay
---
Not really because the point of events is for people to do it together. Not just I do it solo and fuck everyone else. 
---
See my edit above.
---
Theres the assualtron head
---
That, is very useful information.
---
Mm thots
---
If you can afford to play 76 im sure you can work something out. Health before games in my books.
---
Would probably cause duping
---
As I suspected, but never took the time to test...thanks!
---
Let me craft different ammo types like in new vegas!
---
I think a system similar to fallout 3 and fnv would be nice, because in those game when you listen to a holotape/read a note the title of the given holotape/note would become darker than usual. 
---
Some people got it free with a used controller.
---
So have a personal cooldown, not a server cooldown.
---
Honestly I don't know how much of a difference that makes. My power core use from mobility (sprinting, jetpack, etc.) is the absolute least of my concerns for fusion core drain. The two that really do it for me are VATS usage (especially with my .50cal) and power attacks. I didn't count but it only takes me about 40-50 power attacks (or in that range) to drain an entire, almost-full core. 
---
I totally understand your motivations.
---
Most gamers are goal-oriented. Some are more comfortable than others in having a list of, say, 20 current goals that they're working on more or less simultaneously, whilst out wandering the Wasteland. And if you just need that one last crimson flux to build the decontamination arch you've been collecting mats for, and you absolutely have to find a blast zone before you can make a spec more progress on that, and it's driving you to distraction — well, I've been there too, my friend.
---
The game changes that you suggest are interesting, but they'd radically alter its existing structure in a way that would make *your* (and, sometimes, my) style of play less frustrating, but it would do so at the expense of stripping what other players perceive as valuable content and adventure possibilities. Those players aren't server hopping (on purpose, anyway! staying on just one for a while can be a challenge even when that's what one wants to do!). They're working on the assumption that if they just get out and adventure, they'll get more overall satisfaction, and they'll *eventually* get that last crimson flux in due course. That doesn't mean these players are laid-back navel-gazers; they can be goal-driven, too, albeit toward a bigger handful of goals.
---
I therefore don't think Bethesda is likely to re-balance the game in the way you suggest. 
---
Don't try to use logic here. OP only cares about themselves and wants the game to fit them. 
---
I was doing that the other day.  [XB1] The game froze when reentering my armor.  Waited ten minutes.  Still frozen. 
---
Quit the application and signed in.  GONE.   An entire suit of excavator power armor with mods.  GONE. 
---
Submitted a ticket: “my item is missing”. 
---
Response: “sorry”
---
Western is just an alternate .44. it doesn't have nearly as many mod options, but fully modded, it's still an upgrade over a fully upgraded .44. there's also the single action revolver, which it's basically a Western revolver with even fewer mod options, and a 2 minute, one bullet at a time, reload animation. Quad single action, though, is amazing.
---
I dressed up in the full policeman outfit for a while, then I wore the Confederate uniform with the ranger hat, and now I have gone full park ranger.

Blackbird looks best on T-51b and tricentennial looks best on X-01. Change my mind. 
---
Hop up on a van in White Springs and see how fast they run! Even the Deathclaw that spawns there is an Olympic sprinter! 
---
There's a window, there.
---
Happens every time. Or if you die, it does it too
---
Could be a mod interference. Disable them, see if the problem goes away; if it does, then you probably need to do some editing (but I'm not the guy to instruct you on those details).
---
I kno feels good right..I love hooking ppl up
---
Except that's a slow charge and it's a handgun
---
I hope I come across you, I've been looking to put all these vampiric weapons to use.
---
I think nuka quantums are licensed to the Jones soda company, you can find it on the walmart and target website
---
I think you should go stroll through traffic on the nearest interstate highway instead.
---
More tattoos, more hair styles, and paints and dyes but really that can also be said for the base game aswell.
---
Skins for guns people actually use

Lol I'm just wanting to get a group before Sunday
---
It was at the poseidon plant, player had benches stash down but workshop wasn't taken. Turrets said owned and they were still on the map... saw this also at the food processing plant both had fusion generators running it all and it said workshop is yours for the taking... again both players were still on the map

I'm all in for the marine helmet and nurse dress right now.

Where are u hopping?while doing that clear out all the enemies in the area so it doesn't feel like a waste..I've gotten so much xp and legendaries this way
---
Last night I found 3 level 3 people playing together. I followed them around and killed enemies when they seemed like they needed help. Then I tried to give them a bunch of stims. Kept emoting at them as I didnt have my mic running and I dont think they did either. I would drop the stims and emote and they would just walk away. Finally I followed them into a train station and on the 6th attempt they finally noticed the bag and emoted back.
---
Some weapons spawn with legendary effects that are useless on that weapon, like ghoul slaying gamma guns. I guess that's a bug, but, pretty low on the priority list.
---
Thank you!!
---
love  vampire anything lol
---
Are you suggesting OP commits suicide just because  you're afraid of pvp players? Lol 
---
In The Division I used to say that we need rogues, but I don't feel the same about raiders in FO76. Maybe(and I wish) survival will change this. 
---
I can make that easy enough. Plus, why have a hoard of caps? I certainly have everything I need. 
---
It isn't hard to track the last time each player did an event. And then give them legendary loot if it's been a while, or normal loop if it hasn't.
---
Try putting a rug down first then placing the generator over it. You should be able to move the rug with the generator on top. You just can't remove the rug afterwards or it'll remove the generator as well.
---
Almost everyone I traded with thru reddit were super cool peeps..we usually end up giving additional legendaries aid and food 
---
I don’t have mods because I play on PlayStation
---
As it happens, [I posted something about that a day or two ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqbd1j/bug_neon_letters_placement_issues_with_letters/), with a photo, and got some interesting explanatory comments — it's a mesh problem dating back to Fallout 4 — which did, at least, pick up a comment from one of the Bethesda folks who monitor this subreddit, saying he/she has documented &amp; reported it.
---
It really depends on your playstyle to be honest, but here are my opinions on some of the options:
---
Head:
---
- Targeting HUD - lets you see enemies in the dark. They have a slight red glow. My personal choice.
---
- VATS Matrix Overlay - VATS accuracy increased by 10%. Not crap, but with the way VATS and PA is at the moment, good luck maintaining a VATS/PA build.
---
There are no other options. Internal database is +Int, but you can't craft in PA. Sensor Array is +Perception, but this doesn't give you any bonus to anything, as far as we know.
---
Headlight:
---
- Red looks nice, but it's weird in combination with the Targeting HUD. Best used with Blackbird paint for maximum badass look.
---
- Blue, Yellow, Purple, Bright - well, they're headlights. Get one of them. Bright is best IMO, but you might like the soft-effect of yellow. Blue and purple are both horrible to play, but do make you look awesome.
---
Hands:
---
- Either nothing, because they're all crap for a non-unarmed build, or potentially any of them for an unarmed build. I'm rifle, I didn't bother. Major fail on the mod options here. Hoping to see more in the future.
---
Legs:
---
- Calibrated Shocks - +50 carry weight PER LEG. The easy winner in almost all scenarios.
---
- No honestly, the rest are shit.
---
Torso:
---
- Jetpack - Pure QOL and woohoo thing. You can blast yourself very high. With the mutations Marsupial and Bird Bones, you can almost fly. At the cost of fusion cores. I like this one, but melted mine accidentally, and don't miss it because I use....
---
- Emergency Protocols - If you drop below 20% health, a wonderful 50% DR (to everything) and 20% speed kicks in. My current pick because I have a bloodied weapon.
---
- Core assembly - more AP refresh, can support dodgy for defense, but I am not a fan. Seems too little to matter.
---
- Kinetic Dynamo - Melee hits regen your AP, which fuels dodgy. I haven't tried it, but I doubt that the regen can be faster than the hits if you're swarmed.
---
- Others: Crap.
---
Nutshell:
---
- Calibrated shocks legs. No question. +100 carry weight, hell yes thanks.
---
- Jetpack or protocols chest. Prob jetpack.
---
- Arms, nobody cares.
---
- Head is targetting HUD all day long.
---
- Headlight is to taste.
---
Hope this helped.
---
You can get witch outfit plans from a dead trick or treater that occurs as a rare random event. It took me days of server hopping. Are you on PS4? I can give you a few.
---
I have Boss combat armor. I got it in some random event in toxic valley. I do not send hop, I really wish they would disable that feature. People should just play the game. Drop rates are rare in plenty of games. However, everyone has this childish notion they should be able to have everything and if they can't they get mad. So go ahead and stare at loading screens or go make corn dogs if your parents let you use the microwave. While you're at it think about what you're doing. Trying to find a quick route instead of actually digging in and playing "Your Role" in a post apocalyptic wasteland. Your googling and scrolling the web so you can know everything. .. is that fun? Then your probably the type who likes spreadsheets or exploring library indexes. Just chill man and accept you can't have everything and go play that game. You'll get things way faster and it will probably surprise you. 90% of all spawn locations are farmed by greaser YouTube addicts and lovers of loading screens like you. Enjoy your corndog , playing it safe and staring
---
Good looking interior walls, maybe done as wallpaper. But not just that. A wall that is interior on both sides, ( a brick variant that has two white sides. ) just for use on inside walls. Say you like metal walls, want that look from outside, but the inside you want a wall board to cover the studs. Would open up a lot more decorative possibilities 
---
It's a bug, log in put excavator PA and then hop server to your team's server, now you have an additional 100 carry wait as long as you don't exit your PA.
---
Also upcoming weekly series of new content.
---
Who hurt you?  People like you are the problem, not me. 
---
Yes, you have to read the fine print regarding what skins fit which things, and you end up not being able to mix-and-match armor types with them all having a common paint. Paints are generally FUBAR'd in this game, due to Bethesda's lust to go the micro-transactions path instead of focusing on making a good game worth its purchase price.
---
I bought mine from Grahm, I’ve never seen them off Watoga and I’m there daily.
---
I think it's because the turn in gives a event completion style caps and xp. If they eliminated the caps and xp for just rewards, than a multiple turn in wouldn't hurt.
---

Just relaxing :)
---
Oh ok so I can shop for a plan somewhere then. Thanks. Guess I'll concentrate on right side of map vendors. Just need a decent Weapon Artisan'ed weapon to go along with my modded out Raider PA for my level 15. When I've played the game to death I hit the point when I start theory crafting new alt chars but don't really feel like inefficiently leveling 50 times just to see how that build is like, if I can do it more efficiently.
---
Really hope I get a bounty. No one ever does the hunter mission and playing Chase in this game would be fun.
---
Man you must’ve really put a ton of effort in on this post with all the details and examples you provided.
---
Sarcasm aside, you’re wrong dude, you need to do more testing, put the receiver on more guns. Prime weapons obliterate anything with scorched in the name and are well worth it. You apparently haven’t had much experience with them, yet you made a whole post about buffing them. 
---
It’s lazy ignorant people like yourself that waste dev time reading stupid useless information-less posts like this.
---
Thank you, if you see one over the weekend could you grab it for me? I’ll continue my server hopping mania
---
Sign me up. 
---
Eh?
---
I did this and Took no damage perks, man it's fun.. But I'm squishy AF on that character.
---
Feedback: I am sure this has been asked for but I want to ask for it again, can we at some point have the  magazines/bobbleheads, chems, food/drink sorted in their own tab.  pretty please and thank you
---
Allow us to choose servers, and seperate pure pvp servers from pve servers and half of all problems are solved. Add in permenant base building without budget restrictions and you’ve finally turned this into a *real* online survival game.
---
Basic things like this are often overlooked in games. It happens all the time when you're too close to any sort of project. The difference is most devs usually intend to implement them at some point. It's more of a lottery here which is really annoying.
---
On your rampage, please just leave alone anyone who is doing an event. PVP is fine if that's what you like, but please respect that others may wish to finish events without PVP interfering. 
---
Speed demon mutation + canned coffee?
---
I did it today it was painful. 
---
I was over encumbered,  with blight, shell shock,  parasite,  excavator armor,  shotgun build. 
---
I run down to 10 shells and half core,  out off most med.
---
My bloodied unarmed guy uses a.44/Western revolver about as often as melee, because even with no gunslinger perks equipped, he can still one or two shot most things, and it's faster than running up to each enemy to punch them. But yeah, melee is the only viable option. 🙄
---
I’d like to see a raider power armor skin made from car parts.
---
Also a Power Armor  skin with a deathclaw skull on the shoulder plate.
---
I’d like to see some faction related skins. Mostly for the Enclave, so the BOS and Enclave can battle it out over workshops and maybe KoS one another.
---
That's a bug introduced in patch 5. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
I'm not using that perk either and I'm a rifle build that uses vats quite often. I literally never worry about fusion cores, I always gain more than I use, to the point that I drop them in the lunch box at Grafton station sometimes.
---
OP using 20 cores in a single SBQ fight is just insane, I don't even use one while I'm using vats every time I can in the same fight.
---
I have a feeling a perk card he is using or something else is bugged.
---
This post apocalyptic game was sold with the option to not engage or not in pvp. 
---
There are a lot of old time fans who enjoy the aspect of playing with others not against others.
---
So to tell people to play something else if they don't like pvp is somewhat selfish and narcissistic. Why don't you play pvp on fortnite or apex and leave the guys in the wasteland who don't want to pvp alone
---
I don’t have much hope for the future PVE vault opening DLCs.  It will probably be boring.  PVP is the only hope this game have at making a comeback.  
---
Nipples
---
I think most of us just want this game improved upon.
---
Just do it like Fallout 3 and New Vegas where if you had a holotape or note that you already listened to, the name would become shadowed and darker to denote that you had read/listened to it.  If you hadn't read or listened to it, the name was just solid.
---
Agreed.  Except for the no budget restriction for camps.  No doubt  it will be interesting to see what people will built without restrictions tho.  But I guess the bigger your base the bigger the target it is so it may balance out.  IDK.  
---
Dang really? Thought it was more.
---
faction settlement items. Posters, flags, etc.
---
I’m on Xbox, I assume the tables are the same. Sorry man. Good luck!
---
I recommend using a anti armor pistol with armor penetration mods. Especially since there are no perks for pistol anti armor
---
If you place a rug over dirt and are able to place a object over dirt and rug, moving the rug is a way to bypass the restriction.
---
NP thanks again
---
I want the DLCs and the survival. 
---
Well...I don’t think getting kill once with have a big impact on your ability to complete the event.  I’m not an Ahole, if you gives me the thumbs down or anger emoji I will probably leave you alone.  And I won’t  interfere if the event is almost over or stalk and kill the same people repeated.  
---
The notes said that they only targeted colas in inventories they'd already found dupes in, and there are *zero* reputable reports of them deleting legit items, so... you sure this is what you want to go with?
---
yeah they have. Any account with a stack of them have been removed except 1. 1% of the players held 80% of the duped tse's. thus, 79% of dupes have been removed.
---
At least you leave the guys who don't wish to participate alone. My brother just got his PS4 fixed after two months waiting (told him to just buy a new one). 
---
Logs on for the 1st time on FO76 make a character and as we are building his 1st camp we get a pvper come and destroy everything we built.  So do we engage and potentially get farmed for caps, none of us are geared to pvp. 
---
They have to do something to give the people who bought into the whole "you can decide to engage or not in pvp" a chance to enjoy the game without annoying pricks making it impossible to play the game. 
---
My Vault-Tec #2 power armor skin. Been saving my atoms for that skin for so long 
---
I love the tan and yellow. Also the riders power armor skins but I doubt we'll get those anytime soon 
---
Uh, yeah pretty sure. I'm just reporting what I found to be true. I knew there would be posters that just straight up didn't believe me, and I also have no evidence. Which is why I asked if this happened to anyone else. 
---
How many of these rare drops have you got so far? on the same character? Ive only received 1.
---
The update this week was sever side. The content update is in the next few weeks which should see your PC update. 
---
Lol. Rockstar would have done a better job for sure. GTA Online is amazing and most everyone who played it loves it. 
---
It probably would be easiest if I even had decent melee weapons and armor. It’s so hard to find ballistic fiber so I can never repair my armor :(
---
Sure, from your original post your sound like a really nice guy.
---
Because that simply won't happen. This isn't WoW, they can't alienate all the farming you did to get decent gear. Will they make stronger gear? Certainly, will it make old gear totally useless in comparison? No because even if the new stuff 1 shot everything in the game, the current weapons are still strong enough to deal with everything. Hell I have mediocre end game weapons by most standards and I can still delete mobs.
---
They would have to introduce new boss level mobs and add in so much content that even if they started making it now, they wouldn't finish at least for a very very long time. That makes your point basically moot because by that point most people who play dedicatedly would already have those weapons.
---
Lastly, the damage is more than just the weapons being in everyone's hands. The division in charge of fo76 proved it cannot handle the game and so it's lost player trust and with that they've lost agency. That means they're less likely to sell as many copies of the game and sell significantly fewer atoms. It means when they announce something players don't trust they can follow through with it and are often tense about what they may fuck up. Just look at the subreddit after the last patch announcement, half the threads were like "what're they gonna fuck up this time." That kind of damage cannot be undone by adding something new to the mix. That's like saying if I punch you in the face repeatedly the pain will go away if I pay you 100 bucks... no, you'll just have something nice to go with the asswhoopin.
---
Out of all my tse guns my lever action is first to need repair b4 it breaks!
---
well, they just yesterday!!!  
---
What happened 
---
No budget would have to be approached way differently from the way they have it now. Maybe bring up material cost, or have certain items with build restrictions, say one bed or stash box per player, 4 turrets per player, where you have to physically dismantle the previous before building the new ones? I’m just imagining something more along the lines of ark or rust, with permanent basebuilding (drop the whole portable b.s.) with ‘safezones’ where no one can build (so people cant ‘fortify’ pve/story areas). It would encourage role play and ‘clan building’ if we could build tribelike bases or towns and pick ‘home’ servers yo develop our ‘societies’ in....
---
You were deceived by BGS.  There is no option not to engage.  
---
The game doesn’t give us the option to go “somewhere else”.  The game doesn’t offer PVP only zones.  And you are asking too much from an online game where people can play anonymously.  People can be selfish and narcissistic.  Welcome to Earth.  
---
I’m probably the nicest “bad guy” there is.   So far I’ve only played the game with Pacifist mode ON.  
---
Now you have me doubting myself with all the patches. Anyway not going to argue the point, whether patched on the client side or server side, still a patch, call it what you want.
---
I've already read some notes like a dozen of times... and I bet I still have some notes that I've not read yet.
---
No, they fucking wouldn't. Have you actually played GTA Online recently? It's a clusterfuck of epic proportions filled to the brim with unreasonably overpriced weaponized bullshit locked behind days upon days of grinding. Or spending money on shark cards, which everything in the game is geared towards getting you to buy. 
---
I know this because I've spent literally the last month and a half trying to get my shit up and running to where i can actually have a decent income in the game. I only just now, after having the game since it launched 2013, got to the point where i really don't have to worry about money.
---
It's not as amazing as you think it is and you shouldn't presume to speak for everyone. 
---
I often hear that the durability of those is very poor, so I’d be reluctant to respec in that direction. Maybe play around with the gun in lower level areas first to see if you like it? 
---
Wow, bad times... do you have dense mod? It makes a huge difference fighting scorchies. Dunno how I would do against 3 at once, though.
---
Definitely a cool idea.  
---
Ill buy some adhesive, fiber, screws or springs if you have too many
---
4-5 on the same character, only been doing it seriously for a week or two.  I'm pretty fast at doing these now and usually do 8-10 before I get bored and move onto something else.
---
Nice score
---
Things that are totally obvious, when you PLAY the game for a while...
---
Nothing.
---
Beautiful...and deadly. 🌹
---
Yup, I think 'visa reversa' is required.
---
Put martial artist with it, increases your fire rate
---
Nah, I'm on PC. Thanks though, for the info too. 
---
protest march mob shows up inside a building not outside in the alley
---
That sounds fun.   
---
I couldn't carry mine around anymore. Too heavy. 😄 
---
Maybe you could learn to write, properly? 
---
Another way to put Armor Pen into a stealthy pistol build: Find a pipe revolver. Put a buttstock on it. Now your pistol is a carbine that can be suppressed and it will benefit from BOTH pistol and rifleman perks. It's not a meta-build that'll be taking down the SBQ, but if you can find an Instigating pipe revolver (if those exist?), well, once Stealth gets fixed you might just have a real fun time.
---
I like the way it looks and it's fun for a scavenger role play... but you may want a higher RPM secondary that doesn't feel wasteful to your perks.
---
Same issue here as well. I always have to put on some piece of the armor every time. 
---
Why did you link to an article with a bunch of ads on it that basically recycles the inside the vault text? There is literally no new information on that article. Seems like you're advertising for your site. Delete your comment.
---
Gotta protect our forests. I used the police outfit for a while with the Bowler. Has good boots. 
---
No. With all Unyielding armor and base stats having my luck at an average of 30~, I still got garbage all the time. A safe bet with all things in this game is if it would make sense, it’s not in here.
---
engineer uniform with a assaultron helmet
---
What platform are you on?
---
If you are on PC I dont mind doing a run with you, and it wont cost you a single cap :)  
---
I love this.
---
People like you that crash or lag the server, do us all a favor &amp; don’t come back
---
omg, how did i not know about the camp fires and related item trick?! nice work, thanks
---
Do like the rest of us, get a 2nd account and mule stuff across 5 to 9 alts... ;-)
---
But seriously, if you have a friend online, you can dump items into like a static suitcase with 0/0 weight (or have your buddy hold it for you, but I hate asking friends to mule), switch characters to an alt and go collect the stuff from that same suit case (just don't brown-bag it then log off!). I have 4 alts just for the extra stash room, one of which is dedicated to entirely holding my meds and another to just bulk junk.
---
Dump everything that's not 3-star was the first hard lesson I learned after the weight patch, that was rough.
---
Clothing items that look more post apocalyptic and hairstyles .
---
I sorta like this "bug." I consider it more a feature. Hopefully they are busy fixing other issues and leave this one alone. 
---
Haha I actually felt the opposite. Whenever someone cries like this I just assume there some young kid and this is like crying to mommy and daddy “mommy, Billy and Jimmy broke my CAMP!!!”
---
Not true. I want a game that is flexible and allows people to have different experiences without having to game the system for hours. Ex: a cross-world event matcher (like in final fantasy xiv) where I can enjoy the game while waiting to be notified and matched with other people to do a fun event.  I don't really care how it happens, I just think server hopping is an unintended consequence of the game and should be fixed.
---
Trust your instincts, drop it like many others who have used their noggin
---
Love is love.  Pat Benatar's "Love is a battlefield" spins up.
---
I need this uniform. :O
---
come see the violence inherent in the system!
---
Do you have pics of the inside?
---
Why does it have to be in the atom shop. I want Bethesda to give shit for free
---
New hairstyles for men; a few more full beard options that aren’t scruffy and scraggly; better masks and helmets (that have actually been tested to work with all hairstyles and facial hair); and a series of Vault-Tec jumpsuit outer layers with different spins depending on faction allegiances, wear states and potentially hybrids with other outfits (BoS/Enclave patches, incorporated armour pieces, battle damaged, leather jacket worn over the top, etc.).
---
Basically, I got the game for free and just want an excuse to pump a bit of money into the Atomic Shop to show my support. I currently have 2,700 Atoms and zero desire to buy anything aside from maybe half an eye on Pip-Boy paint and some new bloody flooring.
---
Whoa dude, greaser YouTube addicts? I think we're on the same page here - we both want to end server hopping. I don't enjoy it, at all. Did you read what i wrote?
---
I dunno, it never updates, i.e. the flowers don't eventually disappear -- though I guess I haven't stuck around for more than a minute or two.
---
Excavator doesn't have jetpack or VATS matrix overlay. 
---
Also, what do you mean about VATS and PA? I run a vats/rifle in PA build and have no issues. 
---
It would be nice if wasteland Nuka-Cola could be crafted.  Crafting Nuka Cola was a thing in New Vegas, but 4 didn't allow you to craft it, probably because it was easier to find and they had plans for Nuka World to make that even easier.
---
Still, I've always wished using the Nuka Cola plants since Fallout 3 would allow you to bottle your own Nuka Cola if you had bottles to fill.
---
New games just came out, of course people would drop this game to play better games.
---
Git gud kid
---
I think I was in on that fight. We failed.
---
I figured it out, thank you
---
Of course lol I have so many atom points I never use because the shop sucks only things I've bought was the minigun and Fatman skins. Im betting there will be lots of new stuff with dlc as well though. Still have no idea why base armor paints from fallout 4 were never implemented 
---
I've seen this post. It's sad to see how oblivious people can be
---
100% Incisor because it also applies to every melee weapon type, where as slugger is pretty specific. The difference between +30% and +45% is minor compared to +75% armor ignored.
---
You can get the engineer outfit it by turning in technical data, and the assaultron helmet by scrapping assaultron heads.
---
Some people are super soft and have one little experience that doesn’t go there way and they gotta go and cry. 
---
We should go start a topic about getting down voted on reddit for not agreeing with someone’s whiney opinion. “Wahhh, reddit downvoted me and now I lost my fake internet points! They should remove the down vote feature!”
---
If you don't want it to go to waste, then you can craft lvl 1 versions of weapons and armor to scrap for plans. This takes patience since crafting fast causes lag and crafting too much can flag the internal system to check to see if you're banworthy, the method I use is crafting 5, then scrapping 5. Building a base also uses up materials. 
---
Personally I bulk everything and sell off anything in the excess of 10 bulk, exception being springs, gears, adhesive, aluminum, and plastic (used up in bulking) which I'll sell off in excess of 50 bulk. For the stuff that doesn't bulk, I'll vendor everything in excess of 100 unless it's ballistic fiber, or screws which I'll sell off in excess of 500.
---
I won't go higher than 18 glowing mass, hardened mass, high radiation fluids,  
---
For chems, I'll hang onto it craft down up to 15 and vendor excess over 15, Rad-X, Addictol, I'll vendor past 15, Radaway I'll vendor past 50
---
Excess oil: molotov crafting (each train station tends to have a handful of empty bottles when you run low
---
Excess lead above 200, or steel above 300, or gunpowder higher than 30: ammo crafting
---
If you've got power armor pieces, put them on chassies and let them recall to your inventory to net no more weight than 10. Learn any unlearned plans.
---
Prioritize the weapons you carry around your person. For ranged weapons stick to one or two ammo types. Assess your outfit collection and limit it to rare outfits and ones you really like the look of. If it's an atomic shop version outfit, scrap it when not wearing it for a while.
---
Stuff to let go of: known plans, ammo your weapons don't use
---
Use your missiles, nukes, grenades, and mines pretty liberally. It frees up a lot of weight.
---
This literally warms my heart to read. I truly hope you continue to have great experiences playing this game! Much love and positivity coming your way 🤙🏻

If you're getting 2 load screens, thats normal. There used to be only 1 but they added a second one in a patch. The second load screen actually helps the world load more quickly than ut did without it
---
Fair enough, I am a X-01 user so consider the above an overview of all mods for all PAs.
---
And with regard to VATS and PA, here's a thread you might be interested in:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqxg1u/fusion_cores_draining_unacceptably_fast_when/
---
The user that posted this is not wrong, btw. It's absolutely insane how fast they drain. It's not fun to farm cores for an hour to adventure for 3.
---
I have nipples Greg, can you milk me?¿?
---
Agreed...legendary lead pipes shouldnt even be a thing. I still miss "knock knock"......      
---
Its given me a drive to keep playing i guess. I spent the last 50 level up just trying to find a decent legendary weapon....and basicly failed. Ive gotten litteraly dozens and dozens of crap, and one .45 with explosive rounds thats OK...meh
---
Probably b/c they nerfed the loot but called it a “bug”b/c everyone and their mama had TSE &amp; other end game gear 
---
Now they’ll slightly make it better once patch 6 after they deleted copies of duped items.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised about this after tricking customers about a “nylon bag” and “glass nuka rum.”
---
Thank you for the link. I'll try that next chance I get. :)
---
You did get the product though, as most problems aren’t as bad as the common complaint (being disconnected for example). Every Robles has been worked on and it’s been getting better and better.
---
It’s not like an actual game that failed to deliver, like For Honor.
---
Totally agree! What's the fun in being faction based if you can't rep it?
---
I got disconnected from the server 4 times yesterday and the game froze on me mid battle 3 times. Killed two legendary 3* and the loot disappeared as I went to collect. That's just my experiences the day after the patch
---
Don’t know what you mean, we took only 10 mins for the Queen.
---
Thank you. :)
---
They don’t know how to track duped items b/c shiity bugthesda austin &amp; “it just works” mentality.
---
Soo they deleted items that weren’t even duped b/c they’re “rare” 
---
I found a vendor once in Whitesprings that had Nuka Orange, Cherry, Grape and other flavors once for sale. I went back and couldn't find the vendor again! Anyone know where it is?
---
Exactly! I want some cool paints for my pa
---
I remember reading somewhere that there's actually a thing where having too much actually has the opposite effect and brings your average loot down to very low luck levels, I don't remember where that was said or the source.
---
I personally feel like increasing my luck from 1 to 9 where it is now has substantially improved loot from locked containers and whatnot, it's not always great, but I seem to hit it big more often than not.  But this purely anecdotal, I feel this way, but I'm not 100% willing to say it does change your overall loot gain for certain, since I don't have any game data to support that claim.
---
Ah ok.  I was on another one then. Sometimes gamertags look similar. 
---
As for the one I was on, we failed. Health bar was only down maybe 20%.
---
I'll join one again when I rebuild my supplies. 
---
Nuka Grape is great for nuke zones. -1200 rad without worrying about losing your mutation(s).
---
Reminds me of black desert online, people asked for pure pvp servers with 0 pvp restrictions all the damn time. Well they finally added it in and turns out all these hardcore pvp players didn't actually want to play on fair ground with other like minded people. They really just wanted to kill people they vastly over powered with no consequence and the single pvp server everyone begged for is basically a ghost town.
---
Its always at watoga and bos, just most likely you have to be over level 50
---
Yes, but if the player doesnt shoot back or emotes "no" dont follow along like an annoying little gnat continously shooting. Or jump in front of them when theyre shooting a ghoul, forcing them into PvP.
---
I’m sure it’s as yet unactivated quest much like the voting machines all over Appalachia. I’ve yet to do any quest involving the weather stations peppered throughout the forest region.
---
Currently at level 163 haven’t seen it once. Are you on PS4 and want to earn some caps? 
---
Toxic issue? How often does this happen. How often has it happened to you? It’s never happened to me or the people I play with. The majority of the community is pretty friendly. Yes it does happen and it is an “intended” feature. If they removed it, would I care? No. But let’s be real. It’s an online game where you’re not supposed to know if an encounter with someone else is gonna be good or bad. If you don’t want to deal with the possibility of PVP then don’t claim workshops. If someone attacks your CAMP and you don’t want to deal with it, switch servers. If you can’t be bothered to collect junk to repair your stuff then don’t play this game. 
---
If Bethesda has an open API, we could make one... but afaik there’s not one.
---
No budget would just mean ridiculous amounts of turrets and other defenses. As it is if you don't use any turrets you can make a pretty huge camp.
---
Xo1 is the only suit that gets the skull paint with blackbird. My T51 suits all have x01 heads
---
Add me, I’ll be your eyes &amp; back up
---
Unless... you go full unyielding, and go shopping at low HP.  You could get your charisma much higher.
---
You seem salty.
---
For plans you can sort by either weight (0.25) or value and they’ll show up at the top 
---
If I drop it does it break, delete, disappear etc?
---
Pistols are underpowered for a number of reasons, and the few ways to enhance their effectiveness also don’t play well with grenades (sneak attacks and grenades are kind of mutually exclusive). Best bet is making a VATS pistol build if you really love pistols, and seeing what you can sneak in to boost grenades (which you probably can do, but you won’t get much else. I’m running - 1/15/1/4/5/15/15 build for a stealth sniper, you could move some of those points from Perception to Int for Explosives, but as you can see it leaves you very low in str/end. I make it work, Unyielding gear helps massively for carry weight but you won’t have any str/end perks)
---
Oh shit that's right.
---
That's probably where I thought of the idea
---
I don't see the point of class freak for adrenal reaction.
---
If you're running high rad low health why worryabout having less HP?
---
Also with items like that hey took them all. With weapons and armor they left 1. 
---
Thanks for letting me know. 
---
I do now remember having a problem with this before. But with power user, gun fu, and full charge I play for hours on a single core. I seem to always hover around 20 cores. I take over a powerplant about once a week for maybe an hour. Mostly I just pick a core up every now again from my scrap spots.
---
If thats the case, they claimed the workshop, either got booted or left the server manually, and then rejoined the same server. You cant build items in a workshop you dont own. And, to the best of my knowledge, you cant claim one and then choose to relinquish it.
---
Ah, full charge is the key here.
---
Many users don't want to spend perks on it.
---
Not disputing this information in any way, and kudos for putting the time and effort into that spread sheet.   For me personally, I have done countless of these events and have yet to see a outfit or jumpsuit.  I'd estimate well over 400. 
---
I have seen some posts in other places where players have mentioned lower level characters receiving some of these rewards so it makes me wonder if there isn't some kind of level specific factor in this as well. 
---
"I shouldn't presume to speak for every" as you presume to speak for everyone .... the irony
---
Nothing wrong with Raiders or PVP, just don't assume all lower levels are "pacifists". 
---
Wish my game crashed only every 2 hours. So jealous.
---
There would have to be restrictions on some items, turrets being one example. But the idea is to not be restricted to building in your/outside others boundaries, so you and a would be clanmate could build a permenant HQ/town together.
---
put it in a time capsule and mark it 'do not open until 2076'
---
What platform? I can make Buzzsaws on PC
---
Boats and homes
---
Do you have Glow Sited in Perception? That one is king for Whitesprings 
---
I mean that "Power User" is key here :P
---
Most don't want to spend perks on this.
---
If you're going to invest in Int, then (if you're ranged) some useful ones are Gunsmith (5 points), Nerd Rage (if bloodied), scrapper (can be swapped in), Batteries Included (power cores are heavy).
---
Power user is fairly low priority for many given the ease of farming power cores.
---
Whitesprings robots do drop loot. 
---
During march when they release the dlc yeah
---
Yall crash?
---
I like when I do this and then the low level guy follows me everywhere for 20 minutes. &gt;_&gt;
---
Maybe its camouflage. Maybe they all pretended to be dishwashers at a restaurant but now that all the dishwashers are gone the camouflage is broken.
---
you own it, why not.
---
Yessss! I love these. You're a better photographer than I, but I love taking photos. ([Some dark shots](https://imgur.com/a/iDfBd3k))  
---
I've also been trying to take portraits of the various robots in Appalachia...but they aren't very cooperative models.  
---
If youre quick itll disappear after like 3 seconds for some reason 
---
Experience several bugs that break the game where only a console restart can get me playing again...
---
Open pip boy and game becomes u responsive, but still runs in background.
---
Fast travel to Harper’s ferry causes screen to go black
---
Along with several random server disconnects / freezing.
---
Once ever two hours? Uncle Todd's just telling you to take a pee break. 
---
Guess im lucky only ever get infinite loads when i try to fast travel to fast 
---
It will probably be a atom thing or a 10k caps sync. 
---
That's pretty cool.
---
Nah it stays there. The disappearing bug applies to all mobs not just whitesprings robots. But they do drop stuff and it usually stays there.
---
https://i.imgur.com/iul0eHn.jpg
---
Loot &amp; bodies usually disappear when you kite the mobs too far away from their spawning points
---
Hahaha its not physical its just a cardboard cd with a code on it. :(((
---
Its a bait yeah he could have had a pal nearby who is waiting to kill you as soon as you entice him
---
Sentry bots are a GREAT source of fusion cores for those too lazy to repair a power plant &amp; farm the workshop.
---
I was hoping more people would want to help with scorched
---
Awesome guide. Thanks!
---
I have to be honest, and I'm going to sound like a dick, but... My main is a HW character, I have three perk points invested in HWs. I use rifles, melee and shotguns all the time, **with no perks invested at all.**  And I can kill shit with my eyes closed with regular non legendary weapons. 
---
You are either discretely trolling the TSE nerf, or you maybe shouldn't be playing shooter games.
---
Nice to get that answered. I have the purple on my PA and was woundering about that as well.
---
Starched Genes Lv 2. Not having to worry about losing mutations at all is immensely convenient.
---
Its my favorite because of one thing.
---
Im not longer stuck with Preston and I can actually meet other people and make friends.
---
I don't know about others, but I just spam shotgun shells till it won't let me anymore...
---
Weapon skins, Pip-Boy with different light's for the HUD. Fun and cool things, I don't want a princess bed.
---
I have 11 strength total. Martial Artist 3 is always on as it boosts melee and my Gatling Gun. I have Travelling Pharmacy 2 as I carry a lot of chems for nuke zones. That leaves 6 ponts which I swap between Heavy Gunner and Slugger+Incisor. I'm not mutated, nor low health build btw.
---
Just seems like a weak game. How does he know I wasn't going to flatten his mate too?    
---
I feel lucky I didn't get suckered in to it at least
---
Just sayin if someone has a bounty and you hit their base you don't get a bounty. 
---
Its being adressed next patch so that hoppers in FTP and Mothman event only take quest items.
---
Just a big beard.  That's all I ask.  The Santa beard from December, but not white.  That would do me fine.
---
Kilts would be nice too.  And a Saint Bernard as a companion.
---
I will be adding Rangers (I'm currently level 21). Hoping to still be able to to call on Rangers as we level up as well.
---
Thank you for the suggestion! I’ll pass this along to the devs. They’ll be sure to know about it, and you can count on this being added sometime in the next 14 years!
---
No, but great idea! I have 6 perception which I keep for boosting my Handmade nut used in Whitesprings.
---
Its happened to me except i can kill the guy 3 times over its a poor mans game to either get caps or junk dumb strategy if your board youll end up losing more than earned if its a melee of shotgunner
---
What are those from?
---
i just learned about this!!  lol.  finally found them.
---
You don't know if it's his or someone elses CAMP though. Also it's better to kill someone without a bounty, because the bounty will probably be only worth like 5-20 caps or something, but if they kill a teammate then they get the whole caps whatever level they are. 
---
Oh for real? Sorry, I'm pretty new to the Game still (maybe 100hrs/Lv73) I figured it was better now to play in to a potential trap and the logical reason for hiding himself leaned towards bounty baiting through attacking player Camps. Tbf, just realised it could have been his friends Camp and HE built him in to the box. That would cause me to get a bounty (if it wasn't his Camp, I mean)
---
No. That being said, thousands of players are "risking" it anyway.
---
Yeah like if you find someone elses CAMP you could get into it using some tricks, maybe pick the lock and then shut the door behind you, so you have a bounty inside. They can't get in without also getting a bounty. Then they don't have that slap damage protection so you can kill them. Then they will probably seek revenge and you get even more caps.
---
Alright, thank you. I'll try to check out them out, and I've only ever seen Grahm a handful of times, so I'll keep an eye open
---
Please!?
---
Wild. I don't really bother with PvP anymore since some Level 280+ was bait slapping everyone at Whitespring and I stupidly got hooked cause I hate bullies. Found it's best just to go Pacifist from here on out. I'm here for adventure, not a dick measuring contest
---
I should have clarified. The bots inside didn't seem to drop loot.
---
nice! I stop by those places almost every time that I log in and would swear that I have not seen them (but I might have been looking for "modern lights" or something else by mistake for a while). I will keep trying!
---
It's fun while leveling.
---
End game is the boring stuff.
---
So, since you've already bought it.
---
Go ahead and play.
---
I play with a Gatling gun in queen nukes only. With Gunsmith and Lucky Break, it survives the event. Put a speedy receiver on it and equip Martial Artist and it does a considerable amount of damage especially with  a Prime Receiver to the queen. Note, she doesn’t take explosive damage. A TS is better than a TSE for the queen. Plus no one walks in front of you and causes self detonation. 
---
More important question: Why is pvp in this game a thing? 
---
Good to know. Gotta learn some lessons the hard way I suppose
---
PvP can be fun though. I like Workshop PvP best because I just build defenses etc. and if someone attacks then I can defend. Or I get a bounty and if somebody wants to try to collect it then it's consensual PvP. PvP can be slightly broken in this game though so can be fun or unfun depending on if you focus building your character for that.
---
Server hopping will probably never be eliminated. Some people server hop for nuke zones, some people farm west tek or white springs golf course through server hoping. Personally, I server hop grafton steel, because a weapon plan spawns there, and the plan changes with server hopping.
---
“It just works”
---
I would have killed for this in FO4. How was it not at least implemented in the next game?
---
Okay im having an issue where i kill a legendary and its loot doesnt show any legendary items. Shows that its weight is ther i.e. killed a scorch 3star i go to loot the body and once i take everything it shows 14/200 (max weight made up). No i see that its supposed to spawn something and the weight is there however its not showing or not allowing it to be selected. Its happened to me on scorch queens and a lot of other legendaries
---
I was thinking after I posted that that I may have been hearing about the Gatling laser. So apologies if I am maligned the regular Gatling gun unfairly. I certainly see plenty of people using heavy guns against the queen, so i can believe the regular Gatling is a good choice as you say.
---
I've had a particular bug that been affecting me for a while now; usually when fighting the scorch beast queen and scorched spawns, I use the tesla rifle to easily tag mobs for the exp. However, halfway through the fight i'll suddenly stop doing damage, and don't get kill credit, their health bar shows them taking the damage (the damaged part of their health bar is shown in darker red, but the health never actually comes off, and they even fill back up to full) and this affects all my equipped weapons except for melee and any new weapons I pick up. The only way I can find to fix it is for me to server hop.
---
Because they have it coming
---
Yes, laser durability is AWFUL. 
---
I've done some research and if u look on u tube this is how u get it but its just extremely rare and up to rng 
---
Not sure, the food processing one was weird, player was right there all while my screen said the workshop was unclaimed and I could take it. Not sure if this is a glitch either since they had stacked concrete blocking access to be able to take the shop so I couldn't anyways even if they did get booted. 
---
You can also use a sweet roll, which gives 3 Char, and unyielding armor, which gives 15 Char at low health with a full set, but finding a full set with the bonus charisma legendary modification is quite rare. I think the max obtainable charisma is 50.
---
Or a keyring that stores all our keys for us in the misc tab. Click on that to see all our keys. It has been a mod in several other Bethesda games so it is possible.

Father Christmas..?

This would also be helpful to eliminate the number of items in the world at one time.

If you kill the 3 star legendary dishwasher maybe it’ll drop one of those cool rolling pins hails yeah.

Because I suggested he have as much endurance as possible and I couldn't think of most of the perks that would be helpful.
---
away from the other vendors-think it may be on the second floor near the dining room-someone on here will know better-vendor is named bubbles
---
I'll say whatever I want about whatever I want.
---
Right now radworms are making everything 50% stronger and have been overall behaving weirdly.
---
I'd probably have just chalked it up to radworms. 
---
That's because, even for pvp, endurance is a worthless stat. 
---
Fusion Cores.
---
No worries. I appreciate the offer all the same. GLHF
---
Yeah, but his consumption has dropped tremendously since new year tbf
---
I wonder if events like that give a higher chance of better rewards the better you do in them. Maybe if you have all 3 "intact" you get better rewards? Like for Poseidon I 100% complete all of the optional stuff. Like why is it optional? What is the purpose? Is there a reason to do it? I wonder about that kind of thing sometimes. 
---
Maybe they did that, got booted, and then coukdnt figure out how to reclaim their workshop. Haha
---
Totally... Even better if we can do dirty tricks like set traps before leaving the polling site. 😂
---
I've aged my guy and added radiation and physical damage. 
---
If I had it to do over, would probably have started with a pudgy guy and made him leaner over time too. 
---
I doubt your stack of 20 something colas was flagged for dupe deletion. 
---
What most likely happened is what I notice when I drop or sell items too fast is the lag monster got you. While dropping or selling an item the server lags and the item doesn't drop or sell for a few seconds so I click again. Once the server catches up it drops or sells the original item I wanted to get rid of and then the next item on the list. You may have done this then picked up another nuka cola and didn't notice at the time your original stack was gone.
---
This is all just a guess by me though. I don't really know much so take it with a grain of salt. I just like to make up scenarios in my head.
---
These could have been part of the trailer they look really nice 
---
I found my gatling laser busted super super quick, have they fixed that recently?  I was using gunsmith 5 but i get the feeling energy weapons are unaffected by that perk.
---
Good one.
---
I've had the opposite problem though I haven't paid as much attention since the last patch.  I got so many cores I dropped power user for batteries included to deal with the weight.
---
Never thought of that! Player had all the doorways and access points blocked...lol
---
It was actually default in a couple previous games I think new Vegas had it really hate that they took out the feature
---
Miner's uniform (overalls and denim jacket), newsboy cap. When shit gets serious I change into Silver Shroud + veil of secrets and wraparound goggles.
---
They are the same, some the base is not included in the zip file of the whole print. I tried reuploading to fix it but it did not work.
---
One thing I can say, is that having your luck skill several thousand high has absolutely no impact on loot. It did however, on those perfectly preserved pie machines. 
---
This is the most plausible scenario I can think of since nobody else has this issue. Thank you for the response. 
---
Not sure. If the game thinks it is atom shop, it might disappear. That's what happened to me a long time ago when I tried to drop Atom Shop painted PA. It did warn me first but I didn't understand the warning at the time. I get it now. Lesson learned the hard way.
---
Be careful not to cut yourself on that edge.
---
I've seen a 5000 cap wanted and a 10,000 cap wanted over the last 2-3 weeks... not sure how they got that high other than literally killing and destroying everything...
---
Totally disagree with your Torso: Others: Crap.  I have Tesla Coiled and works great, especially when there are mobs of ghouls, I can stand in the midst of them and deal electrical damage without lifting a finger. Plus when coupled with Tenderizer &amp; Suppresor, the damage persists a while after.
---
Note the queen doesn’t take explosive damage, so not sure I would sink points into demolition 
---
I've got gamma gun plan for sale psn same as here 👍🏻
---
I see this all the time! Some low level gets wanted and people go to hunt him down to get surrounded by way higher levels... old game but people fall for it all the time. 
---
Starched Genes lvl 2. Don't forget to look into class Freak as well 75% (at lvl 3) reduced penalties from the bad effects of mutations.
---
Love it. Totally forgot you can change appearance over time. Thanks definatly gonna age my guy a bit
---
I’d like to know too. That budget thing is shit.
---
I’d bet my caps people getting around it have to use a glitch though.
---
Added you 👍 I'm Hip-Hoppopotamus 
---
I doubt it will be "FREE"... even ESO/Bethesda charges a ton for that in their game. 
---
I finished it all in a week and a half. That made me sad.  Beth games should last more than like 150hrs

You can make "wanted farms". You just get someone to build 100 plants in a small box. Then you let the "Wanted" player to kill the plants and have the other person repair their Camp with the Contractor perk over and over. Its fairly easy and inexpensive. 
---
it's a little different than a creature effect that won't work on specific weapon X, we are talking about a Legendary effect that won't work for an entire CLASS of weapons.  
---
It likely is a low priority, but a much larger issue then the Ghoul Slayer's Gamma example.
---
server hop and they just wasted caps travelling to ur camp lol. A good player knows when to fold his cards lol. If u can't fight him, just server hop and save urswelf the hassle.
---
However, when u do have the fire power. Fight back. That simple, all in all, as much as you hear or see these problems, they ain't that many. U just got unlucky with that person being an asshole.
---
Oh how I would love this. My wife and I play on PC, my best friend and cousin play on Xbox and my brother and sister in law play on ps4. I bought copies to play with them all but to have access to all my characters cross platform would be amazing.
---
I don't see anything hateful. I think you're just being very very sensitive 
---
That’s great, happy with 1k? 
---
Did u do that before the bumped the prices on plans?
---
Well another broken thing is that wanted people should do fuol damage to other players because it isn't fair that you cant defend yourself at all and other players can just come one shot you... by this logic the game should just kill you and take your caps as soon as you get wanted. 
---
I don't drop them in a bag as I've heard they can rot away so I tend to dump unwatned items in bins or Overseers Caches 
---
Really? Well that sucks. 
---
Do you enjoy the game? It doesn’t sound like it. 
---
Tired of people waiting at train stations to jump you.   
---
Mmh nice idea. I like the single action pistols ...
---
I'm on now. For some reason it won't let me accept friend invite. 
---
Happened on my first nuke as well. 😔
---
I got ransacked over 1800 caps between yesterday and today between several players,
---
I have mutations all of them so a melee will possibly trigger an attack (slap damage ) where other players just go and use a tse to terminate, rinse and repeat on several occasions wonder if it’s a trend 
---
You were right, I was wrong. I just remembered there is a way to check when the app was updated and last update was 31 Jan for me.
---
It’s a huge waste of time in camp to constantly have to change cards around .  Half the time I forget (or I forget to change them back).  I would love some way to instantly switch between different perk card builds.  
---
There's ways to prevent one shots though. Being "Wanted" is a choice and has its own risks.  They just need to add more incentive to being "Wanted". Like better legendary rewards from drops or something. 
---
I think this is like a rite of passage at this point.
---
Boy! How can more health be bad? Even if you have to hammer on stims, that little bit extra can be the deciding factor. Given that he wants to be a melee build, more health is needed. This isn't the hayday of TSE where all it took was one shot. Most people don't have a constant crit build either so even with anti armor you can't be taken down with one shot. Sentinel assassin's isn't invincible either, stagger or scare them and VATS blitz and they are toast. So I say again. Boy! How can more health be bad?
---
Ransacked today at ammo factory I had to go do something but left game on so this OP lev 70 just takes all I have then once I got near it again he kills me where I respond
---
Everytime a favorite legendary dies a new dupe gets its wings.
---
Is that the black cowboy hat?  Found one last night and was thinking of doing a cowboy outfit.
---
Basically whenever you take a workshop put a stashbox somewhere, I usually hide mine so any potential enemy doesn't get easy access to it to stash their junk. Every time I empty extractors the junk goes in the stash. You really have nothing to lose. And if you set up your defenses well, which is one of the fun things I like about workshops, you can put a good dent in their health with turrets and traps. If you pay  attention and keep an eye on the console, be ready to shoot as soon as they hit the button.
---
Had desync where things were dying a second or two after I shot them and occasional disconnects (including a mini rollback on one earlier today) so no changes for me. I just lost some xp but still REALLY irritating as it sat on the controls lost screen for a good minute before disconnecting me which I've never had before.
---
I’m loving my Civil War Era Dress!  I kind of feel like a princess (with a sledgehammer).  Wish it were a bit cleaner but still happy to have it 😍
---
Not especially, but enough to keep playing.
---
That’s true. But so far the only people I’ve met have been unwilling to help me complete missions since I’m only level 12 and they are 30+
---
Awesome! That's exactly the info I wanted.... I like the lore but honestly not as into it as some are. I'll listen to the piles of holotapes if a few of them may unlock something, but i didn't really want to do it just for the heck of it. 
---
Yeah I was mad they fixed the refilling fusion cores bug. Leave this one alone
---
Ooh I love Fissure Prime Nuke Drops!!   
---
I agree, people are pretty douche when it comes to workshops and I get it is part of the game but still. One player took a workshop from my level 10/12 characters, then immediately logged off. Another group in X01 PA thought they were so dope, did they same, came destroyed and left.
---
Good thing is most don't care about workshops and choose workshops that will help you but maybe not the common ones.
---
There some black titanium deposits that you can put your camp next to and not be that bothered, you can also mine deathclaws and mole miners for easy access to black titanium .. there is a mine just across from white springs that has a bunch of mole miners. Deathclaw. island has a low level deathblow as well as the place in the mire where you start the enclave mission, 2 easy ones to mine. Lots of other places with moleminers. Nice thing about farming resources from animals, you can just server hop and just do it all over again without penalty.
---
Also you can put your camp next to a junk deposit and mine screws and rubber over time and probably a bunch of other places.
---
Take more workshops, I bet it is a mixed bag, some days you will lose them, others no one is going to bother you, don't waste too much time setting them up, that way you can server hop and not even care if someone takes it.
---
I find better loot with high luck on treasure map 
---
I know, I’m lucky. Lol doesn’t mean I’ve not experienced a fuckload of other bugs tho
---
It's easily missable.. I had the exact same issue. But the shovel doesn't stand out and if ur not looking carefully u will pass it up... Took me 30 solid minutes looking for 1.. And found it dam near next to the hole.... Ran over it like 20 times 
---
Ok, we're gonna slowly coax the information out like a riddle are we? /S
---
Which quest exactly my friend? Appreciate the help 
---
Yeah I’m lucky, tho the only other game to ever crash this much for me was new Vegas on Xbox 360. But that game has incredible writing so I find it easier to forgive.
---
That sounds really boring
---
Omg yes a thousand upvotes for you. I try to listen when I get them,but it's not always possible.
---
You can just sit on top of the building of the fourth one and make them all spawn in that area below you. Also, do it with a team so it’ll be easier for one of y’all to bet it and it also spawns legendaries :) 
---
No, didn't take any - it had room for everything a player needs.
---
Or not use turrets! 
---
Take turrets away and you can build a palace
---
Crafting ulracite ammo should be just existing ammo + ultracite. 
---
Sadly im on pc. I really hoped before release it would be cross plattform. Shame Sony only gives Fortnite that privilege.
---
Everything drops loot and u always get xp
---
 [Minor spoiler]   
---
The quests show up in certain areas. I would say go to the area near the big mining rig in ash heap.
---
ADS? Explain please. :)
---
Ha u mean for hours
---
Aiming Down Sights
---
Do you have Weapon Artisan? That will increase durability to 200% and increase damage on many melee weapons.
---
Your point is correct.   I run several other mutations myself.  
---
A yea I get that alot too. Only use red dot sight and annoys me that we alway hip fire in VATS.
---
I don't use turrets and I still feel like I have no budget compared to everyone else. I see these 5 story mansions fully decorated meanwhile I have 2 stories, really open and have minimal decorations at max budget. 
---
Contractor does. But wreckingball  only says workshop items. Maybe it does. But card only mentions workshops.
---
Will it sparkle?  I’d pay 2k for sparkle
---
Since they fixed damage bug is this still broken?
---
Check what you have stored , I have 2 turrets , a 3x4 house and a 2x5 industrial unit .. more that enough space for everything 
---
Are there certain workshops you get plans from or just a chance for those as the rewards for capping, defending? I don’t recall getting plans but maybe I haven’t been paying attention
---
I love the Sniper Outfit. I pair it with the Veil of secrets and sunglasses. 
---
Face of Meth: FO76 Edition
---
I disagree greatly. The HP gain from END is pretty minimal, you are better off stacking resists and frontloading your damage. Dodgy, Serendipity and even blocker (Subjective, as its worthless against guns) will provide enough damage mitigation, as opposed to the +70 max HP you gain from a full 15 END. Realistically, 70 hp only really stops \~100 damage or so. When a melee swing hits for 1.2k+, I personally do not see that as "worth".  To be fair, this is my opinion, not fact, I just happen to play a lot of MMO/MMOlites and love to PvP, and I usually find stacking defensive stats is inferior to just outright killing faster.
---
I'm tempted to start a new character and go full into luck to before anything else, just to see how things are. 
---
Though even if by chance the loot was better it wouldn't be en9ugh data to confirm it or not. 
---
Nothing stored except my dead pet frog that takes up 10% of the budget, can't wait for that to be fixed. 
---
But doesn't the wanted person have to have that many caps available? It would suck to kill a 10000 cap wanted player and get 10 caps...
---
Seeing that people were bitching about this game from the beta, you're either whining about the cost of the game after 3 months of playing it, or you bought it knowing what its problems were. Maybe you shouldn't spend what money you have on video games if you can't afford to be disappointed in your purchase.
---
I’ll admit it, I server hop for nuke zones in the evenings after I’ve played for a few hours.  I didn’t think it was a bad thing. 😕
---
I know this is old, but what are they listed under in the bsa? I'm looking for it in f04 and it should be similar
---
I will take those axes for 250 Xbox name DeugoMiGuy
---
Interesting! Had not considered how it might work with synergies but I’ll edit my post! Thank you :)
---
I don't mean to say server hopping is a bad thing. Just that it shouldnt be a fix for trying to find a world with an open event. Wouldn't you rather just queue for nuke zone and get a notification when one comes up to transfer straight to that world in a team?
---
It's the brotherhood of steel quest line at camp venture in the room in the basement. The turn in is a red box on the wall. 
---
Not sure why no one said this. Not really a spoiler so no need to be cryptic.
---
I wish that when assigning me a server, it wouldn't decide to plop a low level character onto a server where the character's location instantly has a scorchbeast overhead and those high-level lardass ghoul things running around. Instant death before having time to leave a server is always a pleasant start to a gaming session, LOL.
---
I want minigames.
---
How cool would it be to play pool in the wasteland or poker or minigolf at whitesprings?
---
I love chameleon armor..I always horde any armor I find..even the low-level ones
---
Let’s find out!
---
Ive never seen it or heard of it. Fallout 76 wiki doeant have it listed. Pretty sure it doesnt excist outside of user mods. If it exists at all. 
---
What level are you?
---
I've done 50+ events on my 260 and NEVER seen a rare item.
---
Nice home, I used to live a few hundred feet from there until I discovered it was a spawn point .. but at least you’ll get a screw every morning.. ( from the typewriter potty mind! ) 
---
I would wear outfits if armor showed up over them.
---
I would love to look at my inventory on my phone
---
I always wondered if ppl actual tried a 'perk-less' challenge
---
Yes! One of the best things they added were the "known" prefixes to plans. This should be a no-brainer ;D
---
Yes I have every mod unlocked for hunting rifles and 10mm..but supressor..I know what I'm doing today 
---
The codes are the express hotline number to call to get a plumber immediately and not have to wait around from between the hours of 8am and 4 pm.
---
The truth is neither will get an answer. This is bethesda we’re talking about. If 10,000 people complain about a bug they MAY roll out a ‘fix’ 6 months later
---
I'm going to start tomorrow... been thinking that the only perks I might use are non gameplay changing perks like hard bargain and fast travel....perks like that
---
Yeah, tho when Rockstar wanted that for GTA V it was Microsoft that refused. It’s annoying. For one game it’s one company and for another it’s the other. Annoying as hell.
---
Damn. I was chatting with someone on Facebook a while ago that claimed to have owned and used the Metal Frame mod, but they were not able to provide any evidence. Not looking good! 
---
there is no benefit. ammo is too expensive to craft. 
---
look for dunwich it will add alot to the lore
---
&gt;There is no option not to engage.
---
I suppose if you lack any kind of self-control...
---
Yes we all just wanna play together no matter if you can afford a pc or a console.
---
Had so many people that were joining me when cross plattform was still being discussed.
---
But as they know they can never play with me cause they have console and I have PC their reason for getting the game went away. :(
---
Gotta drink and eat every five seconds, which follows with near constant disease.
---
Whole damn concept is annoying, not fun, and just plain bs.
---
Why didn’t you just make us shit our pants every five minutes too?
---
Christ, figure out what’s NOT FUN in this game and REMOVE it.
---
At the very least, knock this craptastic “feature” down to where I only need be annoyed by it ever couple hours instead of minutes.
---
How did you accidentally get rid of it?
---
They made a script to target stacks of the same duplicated item removing all but one copy, this was done to make everyone happy
---
Hi, I'm using a PS4 and my username in the game is matchumomo. Recently someone that was playing gave me a marsupial serum. Since then, I have been fired of the mutation, but I still am unable to repair the majority of my weapons even though I have the gunsmith perk maxed out as well as makeshift warrior maxed out. Did taking that serum make me unable to repair my sniper rifle, 10mm pistol and combat rifle? I just want to know if this is a glitch or if it is because of the serum.
---
Former vault-dwellers with extreme cap bounties should be avoided. It's an aposematic warning to the cautious, or aggressive mimicry to lure the foolhardy.
---
Yeah that seems fair..everything but perks that will buff ur character..also I think green thumb and other perks where u double whatever u craft should fall under that category too..I played FF12 for years and there were sooooo many different challenges that ppl played
---
Hey if you do end up with some proof... Please let us know. Cause i thought I seen all mods and weapons when the game was "rooted" on pc and i dont remember even seeing any mods at all for the crossbow. But maybe i misssed em. Good luck and happy hunting. I hope that it does exist cause i love the "idea" of a crossbow but 76's execution of crossbows was super lackluster
---
Snitch 
---
Or he/she duped those after the purge.
---
Lower prices!
---
I agree. Tho my main complaint is how when one vendor is out of caps to buy stuff, ALL vendors are out. I need caps, I have an over abundance of shit stored in my camp. The fact that I can fast travel across the map and find another unrelated vendor also has zero caps is infuriating. Plus if I buy something for like 100caps, they only have like 15 caps as a result is also anger-inducing. I should be able to trade the same way as in 3, NV and 4. Making caps is just horrible in this game. Especially since sometimes I find myself almost out and needing a fast travel.
---
I didn't even get to launch my first nuke, finished everything looked at the terminals where you swipe the card and enter the code and the server crashed. 
---
Dual chainsaw mod.  Does great damage
---
Which I said is true and is (sort of) part of the game. I don't honestly believe the Devs expected us to have so many unclaimed workshops. Yes this is speculation and I have not very much to back it up but it seems like you're meant to wander into a workshop that's owned and when you try claim it the PvP message should pop up, warning you the owner is likely to defend it.
---
I highly doubt the Devs expected workshops to work as an opt in *permanently* for PVP, especially with bases that aren't in the workshop being leveled on the petard of "but they opted in hours ago and I have a right to do this".
---
If a base is part of a workshop then I have no issue with someone destroying it while they take the workshop. That is part of the opt in PvP. Hunting down some poor person who happens to own a workshop and killing them and leveling their base is just using a game mechanic to your advantage, low key approved griefing. 
---
Yeah the current system would work all right if the reward actually scaled in a noticeable way based on level and how many you have on you (and you should be able to select submitting 1, 5, 10, etc).
---
Dude your original comment was weeks ago
---
Make sure to check the BoS vendor in watoga as well, but i visit them often as well and it didnt appear for a while so its probably a semi rare vendor spawn. Im sure the traveling merchants might have them as well if you catch them.
---
Accidentally hit square and the bag fell to Hades 
---
Some game sound effects just get seared into your brain.  This is one of them.  Scorchbeast wing flaps are another.
---
He accidentally dropped it while in his pipboy..but the bag disappeared..this is one of my biggest fears..be super careful in pipboy..use the favorites menu as much as possible..I'm also worried about accidentally selling it to a vendor
---
For sure man, I'll be sure to notify everyone if I get some solid info. 
---
I'm in the same boat, I want to make a crossbow build so bad, but they're just...so bad right now.
---
So should I put all of my TD in my stash and only leave one on me before doing the quest? Would that prevent them disappearing?
---
Yeah, I’d buy a pc if I could afford it. But I can’t. I know I’m not part of the master race lol but still, my being poor shouldn’t inhibit my enjoyment of a game that cost me £50 at launch
---
Ah hell I forgot all about the debacle of the Shark Cards. 
---
I agree.  Zero disconnects since the last server update.
---
Which isn't to say I haven't run into crashes or weird little quirks.  I continue to encounter this odd bug where the legendary effect on the weapon I start with just refuses to work until I re-log.  Likewise, there's still that whole Radworms/Marsupial interaction.
---
I agree.. The NPC vendor system is illogical. Should have just kept the same system of previous fallouts
---
* chameleon armor 
---
* ballistic fiber
---
* springs 
---
* gears
---
* screws
---
* rare outfits
---
* rare plans
---
Yea.. I know. I wish i could go all Daryl Dixon on the baddies.... But yea... Hopefully one day. Bethesda should start introducing weekly or monthly mods for weapons. Or just add mods in bundles over time. 
---
Deju vu.
---
I want a robot workshop dlc where I can make one guard my base and say stuff other robots in the world say. That would be cool
---
I got myself trapped by a scortch beast. Some guy with a bounty came by killed the sb and asked me to get ride of his bounty. Most people are cool.
---
Nope, just witnessed this 20 minutes ago in-game. Kinda why i made this post. Someone would use a friends base to farm their "Wanted", then go around messing with peoples houses if he found any. If he killed people who were after him he would just teleport back to him friend and trade him the caps he made. 
---
I killed a 500-1000 bounty 3-4 times, same guy, for nothing.... 
---
Thanks for the advice. Spoke with live chat support, they told me the code was expired and within a day they could manually activate it somehow. Seemingly without needing to send me a new one. Which I guess makes sense, since I got the game through the Amazon Warehouse and it may have been sitting around for a while. 
---
What if the debuff was just "no PvP for an hour (or however long it lasts currently) and no damaging workshops either"
---
And there should at least be a way to see how many caps a wanted player actually has.
---
I feel like these suggestions are simpler than yours, but would still pretty much solve the problem. 
---
They should make that dlc free as well, open up items on the atomic shop for cosmetic items for your robot. 
---
But you know it just makes too much sense so it will never happen.
---
It's pretty consistent to find it there on the dresser with the room with the tinkerer's workbench. I've found it there at least 3 times.
---
&gt; by this logic the game should just kill you and take your caps as soon as you get wanted. 
---
But where's the fun in that?
---
You'd still have players baiting others with the "Wanted" status. You dont need to kill people who attack you... if your friends can do it for you for 100% damage. 
---
You definitely don’t get the warm, fuzzy feeling that you do when the claw picks it up!
---
If Amazon or bethseda, doesn't reply back by tonight, shoot me a PM. If you can get a refund for the game, I wouldn't mind helping out a fellow wastelander free of charge!
---
Get a second account and max the number of characters
---
But it won’t matter. Effective 20 is max for buying from vendors. 25 is max for selling to vendors, but the difference is marginal. Bordering on non-existent. 
---
I'll have to check that vendor out, I didn't even know there were more vendors upstairs.
---
My first nuke ended like this too!
---
I've never had my base blown up because until recently I didn't have one. I play with 2 mates who've had people blow up their bases and not ones at the club house.
---
I've had plenty of griefers try instigate combat and had a few successfully get me to slap them by mistake and start killing me.
---
While most of my encounters on Fallout have been good, even the bad ones aren't as bad as some other games. Death isn't a problem in FO76, low level bases repair and move easily.
---
That doesn't stop it being annoying. 
---
That’s for selling to vendors. Selling, there is a marginal improvement between CHR 20 and CHR 25. 
---
100% agree with this!
---
No joke?  That's funny because Quantum's are the one drink I would be hesitant to drink irl, but only if they legitimately glowed lol, also because reading that terminal detailing their product testing of the Quantum series haunts me to this day.
---
If you make it so people in their group also get the debuff, they just won't get in groups.
---
Already got that perked up for melee
---
Sure....I'll give you one FREE.  Find me in-game @ cyberhawk1.  
---
Good, keep it on then and it'll increase your fire rate
---
I don't mind fighting them. Sure I was popping Stims like Smarties but the constant screech spam got to me. Also the wear and tear on my gun and ammo consumption just wasn't worth the effort of shooting them down. The first one dropped some crappy hunter armour so I just switched to avoid the other two.
---
I hope the guy who's base I spawned in and got leveled didn't have to pay too much to repair it. 
---
Welding Goggles, Veil of Secrets, BoS Field Scribes' Uniform (the one with the backpack) and BoS Scribes' hat (it has goggled on it but screw it 2 pairs of goggles).
---
I havent tried a chainsaw yet, but I routinely get 300 out of a good buzzy blade. So i am sure I could do something similar with a chainsaw. To do it you need to really tweak your build towards melee. 
---
My IGN is Striker2444, i'll be grateful
---
Once I get a TV that's less than half my age I'll worry about reading the notes lol. 
---
PS. I'm 36 and my TV is nearly 15 years old. I'm surprised it has an HDMI port. So technically I do have that TV now but it's not what it used to be.
---
+karma 
---
Ya at $12 a bottle, it's just like buying it from a vendor!
---
Paper bags.
---
I wouldn’t hold my breath. I don’t know that they’ve even acknowledged that prospect... which would mean even if they acknowledged it tomorrow it could be months down the pipeline before they ever implement anything like that. I’d just go ahead and do it. Unless I missed something recently I really don’t see it happening anytime soon. :/
---
Can be found in the ore boxes during breach and clear
---
If they did that suggestion it would fix everything but you could still just swap to alternate characters. 
---
YESS, Ice Cold variants to drinks should give better effects and provide a condition to the drink that once empty returns the item from ice cold to normal.
---
Why is it that Ice Cold Nuka Cola just sounds refreshing?  I want some iced tea now.
---
They should let you put tea and other drinks in that machine to prolong their condition.
---
And a working fridge or ice machine to put food in.
---
That's so incredibly kind! I think Amazon's got my back this time, but I'll keep this in mind. I hope to see you out on the wasteland. 
---
I'm doing norhing but forest events and have not dropped a single vtu jacket.
---
Thx
---
And lode baring
---
No problem! I understand the pain of getting used codes. I figured it brother nice.to enjoy the game before the weekends.over! Take care dude!
---
For a long time, just a space helmet. Now, a ritual mask and 3 piece tattered suit.
---
Would you be willing to share these recipes?  I'll buy them off of you for 200 caps!
---
The backpack is the number one reason I wear it.
---
Sometimes, not always, but sometimes, if a bag falls through the floor, you can drop another random item, and it will spawn the bag at your feet with all the items in it. Picked that "fix" up from Morrowind, where it used to happen all the time. 
---
Dope FALLOUT skins—enough of the wacky, colorful bullshit—and some great camp pieces, furniture, etc. Would love if they brought back Blackbird as I missed that one. :/
---
I've added you :)
---
I mean if you still have the mission active there should be more!? Also i thought 76 wasnt cannon
---
Dude you are right I never thought about dropping another bag..I should try that..but I'm usually so upset i never thought about it..i only experienced this trying to give ammo to other players ..I even made a thread about not using paper bags when gifting..ever
---
But no active quest marker shows up on the map. 
---
Then let’s whine about the random mole rat,  ghoul or super mutant that shows up and smashes up your base also. Yes it’s annoying. But it is an intended part of the game. What game do you play where annoying things don’t happen? 
---
The PvP debuff should just be enforced pacifist for however long. 
---
Free shit is good shit. I agree. But since they aren’t charging us subscription to play the game the Atom Shop is how they’ve planned on supplementing free DLC content. Seems to be a necessary evil. :/
---
I have a Troubleshooter set. It's very nice for silos, or going rampage at Whitespring. I would actually like a Mutant Slayer set for grinding West Tek, even though they're not that tough. But I have low health build and things can be precarious sometimes. It's nice every time I get a new upgrade for one of my Troubleshooter pieces. Even though it doesn't matter much with -75% damage and all my defense perks loaded up hehe. But yeah. I think the stash and weight limits prohibit people from collecting sets and playing around with different weapons. I don't let that stop me though. I manage my weight on the edge with every weight reduction perk and fully upgraded Excavator for fast travelling.
---
Still wont stop the 1 cap, 10000 Wanted players baiting others into a prize with no reward. 
---
Ghillie Suit....that is all
---
WTB Raider Shielded Under Armor 3P 3A 1L. 
---
I'm not disputing that part. Just adding to your post. 
---
Daily and regular events not showing as completed is particularly annoying. Especially when playing with different character builds as it's hard to know which I've already done with each character. Fertile Soil is the only event I have that shows as completed. Would really like to see this fixed in an upcoming patch.
---
I don't think the Overseer's side quest has a formal ending at this point, although there are way more than 6 tape to find.
---
Eight 100s
---
Random af. My experiences.
---
Sadly.
---
That mission never ends, it's almost like it could continue in the DLCs...
---
This. ☝️ And most of the time I don’t even have to do anything—Super Mutants keep completing the quest for me, lol. 😂
---
But how many eights is that?
---
I think it's just her a bar tender but maybe there are more around I haven't seen-take a seat in the dining room if you have a second-cool lil' interaction can occur to ur character 
---
Good one Boy Scout.  What is this self control you speak of?  Do you not understand people do this because it’s 100 percent intentional and allowed by the game.  I wonder why there’re so many people whining about basic decency in an online free for all shooter.   It’s sad how these people don’t see how easily they can avoid being in those situations.  
---
Absolutely, I've been no-lifing creation engine games for the past 15 years, and the thing that gets me... the floors have never, ever, ever been stable. Everything and anything can and will fall through it at some point. Shit, in Caldera in Morrowind, the stairs had a tiny little gap that would cause you to fall to your death all the time. The bag trick might not work if the item falls too far out of reach, but I have had some success with it. Hope you never need to try it.
---
Drop a worthless item first. Like 1 scrap, to make sure the bag appears. Then you can drop items into it 
---
Are you talking like there are more tapes to find in-game right now? cause nothing is showing up on my map :/
---
Yep 
---
Yeah, I know, but it's got a case and wrapped so it looks good on a shelf!
---
Alrighty. Thank you! 
---
They always remind me of something straight out of Aperture. ^.^
---
I got killed a few times in wierd spots..so my loot bag is visible..but can't access it..it's horrible ..I've leaned to always stash my junk every few hours or every time I'm in a tough area
---
Not all the logs show up as quest markers. If you look at your challenges it will give you a hint as to where they are located 
---
I’m totally with ya. Atom Shop has been a HUGE missed opportunity since launch. That could be a freakin’ gold mine for them. There are a bunch of skins or camp items they could add that I would probably snatch up in a heartbeat, even if I had to buy a few extra atoms lol. 
---
No shielded raider, sorry. I have BOS, enclave, and marine wetsuit. 
---
So many legendaries don't really do much for me..I sell mostly all of it
---
*your dishwasher would like to know your location*
---
Was never a thing
---
You think railway rifles will be fixed?
---
That's happened to me before. Big pain in the ass. Dropped 80 radaways for my lower level brother because I was too lazy to open a trade. Big mistake. The abyss ate them.
---
I think there should start being an NPC police squad when you accrue a huge wanted bounty and don't have the caps to pay it out.
---
Just start sending obscene amounts of powerful Colonel Gutsy robots, or Scorchbeasts that drop no loot, and only grant like 3 XP on death.
---
I knooooo I tried to give away 700 ammo before :(
---
\&gt;entire server crashes 
---
This is NOT server crashes. This **your client** actually crashes. You can add some player on ur server to friend list before launch rocket.  And if game crash you can jump again on same server to this player
---
platform?
---
The bag trick kinda works with dead loot bags too, it just requires you to have at least 1 junk item and die again close to it. I’ve had that happen too, where the bag is there but you just can’t access it. Die again and it moves and let’s you loot it!
---
Ok Thx. I might hit you up later for a marine and enclave.
---
I’m experiencing a new issue with my camp. My red rocket sign is shown as exploded and damaged but it doesn’t give me an option to repair it. When I go into the camp menu and try to move it, it shows that it’s fully repairs but it still doesn’t show as repaired when I exit the camp menu. 
---
Right on. I moved on to other stuff about a month ago but I’ll come back once new content is added. It’s unfortunate to hear that the game is still crashing frequently because that was among the main reasons I stepped away. 
---
Like the pip biy app for fallout 4

No only if they are wearing a clown costume.

She’s way better at these types of things than Karen.  Karen!  &lt;shakes head in disgust&gt;

I was gifted 3000 bullets (1k 10mm, 1k 44 round, and 1k 45 round), not mention a whopping 400 gunpowder. This inspired me to play the game throughout its time, thanks stranger!

Solo for a reason 
---
That was hoax by idiots who kept dropping/selling their weapons
---
I ran into an un-killable perma-healing low level bloodbug the other day.  I didn't want to admit defeat, but finally just quit when I realized it was just going to waste all my ammo, break all my melee, and use all my heals before killing me.
---
I got to that quest but never continued past it. I’ve done many SBQ’s in events and found the loot isn’t worth the effort it takes to repair my broken weapons and used inventory. They never give me anything worth the time it takes. And Anything I need I just trade for. So I figure I’ll save that quest till absolutely last. 
---
I’m level 113 now, but I know I haven’t found every location on the map, which means there are more quests to do. Even if they are just busy work quests. I try and do events that I’ve never done, farm whitesprings when I’m bored for legendaries, and farm to fix broken shit. So cooper and springs usually. I also switch up which weapons I use, or run around without PA to make it interesting. Also adding in different mutations makes it interesting. Marsupial added a lot of fun. I also finally acquired the x01 jet pack. Which I always found entertaining even in FO4. 
---
I stumbled across the locker with the tnt key in it without knowing about the quest
---
Yeah no worries. Just making sure everything is clear. 
---
Check out this thread. Covers your complaint about vendor caps. Sorry if link isn't posted properly, new to reddit

The only time I’ve ever considered buying anything is with C.A.M.P. Items but then I instantly remember that their is never enough room for me to decorate the way I try to AND place the decor items in. A few of the items I always use like the mini nuke planters but their isn’t always enough room after putting in lights to justify putting a rug, mini flower pots, a statue or three, some wall decor. It’s all just too much in too little of a space. If they really wanted to sell them they should’ve made atom shop items take about 1/2 as much budget as they currently do so you would be inclined to decorate with them instead
---
Mods?
---
?
---
I never understood all versions from that bar cant just drop in-game based on its rarity.
---
150
---
Yea its stupid that Sony was shittalking Microsoft about the XBox Gold membership and then when PS4 comes put they do the exact same thing.
---
Go on the market subs and sell everything 
---
That is amazing. I need a jet pack...
---
If you accidentally sell it to a vendor you can buy it back. Always make sure to have enough caps to buy it back as well. You do need to leave the vendor screen and reenter the vendor screen though.
---
I know it wouldn't be cannon with 76s place in the timeline, but I'd pay for NCR veteran ranger armor or a very close look alike. I love that gas mask and riot control armor look. 
---
I think right when u sell a weapon it doesn't appear but if I exit and open trade menu it does appear..I just really hope I never have to..I'll try that later today when I'm on
---
Because people will complain about anything and everything. 
---
I got all the stuff i wanted for free, just by playing, but, there's not that much stuff in there i really want anyway. 
---
Radaway should not remove mutations, however, Rad-X will temporarily suppress mutation symptoms. Once the Rad-X wears off it should work again. Never heard of Radaway removing a mutation when using the starched genes perk.
---
This is a well thought out response and I appreciate you explaining your thoughts. 
---
That said, I think there are a lot of smart people at Bethesda and I have no doubt a DLC for this game will easily make new gear replace old gear as a step in progression. 
---
All they would need to do is have level 55, level 60 versions of all the same items and bump difficulty on all current endgame activities in a scaled fashion. All the same level 50 items will still be useful in the level grind, but new endgame boss fights and the existing queen fight will benefit from newer weapons that obsolete the duped items.
---
Regarding trust and an loyalty, I don't personally think they have lost anything other than the elitist gamer community which are a tiny fraction of players that move quickly between games anyway. I know its a controversial opinion, but everyone I know that doesn't frequent online forums thinks this is a great game. That may be an anecdotal sample, but I would wager the game will continue to do fine.
---
Thought you were gonna go with a guitar hero or monster hunter sequence mini-game where playing in sync or different tunes gives different bonuses. 
---
I don’t think so,  but I’m about to find out! Working on my permanent version and I’m not happy with the location. I did end up building a ‘terminal’ for it that does connect if I need to (non marsupial entrance!) so I’m going to attach it and *maybe* I’ll be able to move it without rebuilding. 
---
Have you played anything other than 4 and 76? Garvey is only in fo4.
---
well, at roughly 30 min a day for your playtime with what you stated.. it will be a really long time before you hit end game content.. go play it have fun and dont take it too seriously..   
---
example: left my house other night, went to walk to the otherside of the map.. took me roughly 2 hours to get there, killing, looting, and picking up junk i found along the way (im lvl 206).. its a big map, lot of stuff to do and see.. and 30min a night not really all that much time in the grand scheme of things..   
---
go have fun.
---
Also use only RadX diluted since regular RadX supresses your mutations! Not sure about radshield.
---
Right use of heals... 
---
Same here. But, just by doing the little tasks in game, I've been able to purchase everything I've wanted without actively trying to gain atoms.
---
The last patch brought back duping anyway, so deleting everything was mostly pointless:) Bethesda haven't even come close to winning yet
---
Which weather stations?
---
Can 10000% confirm it doesn't exist sorry bud. Also if you put the prime receiver on, you will be unable to remove it as you can not 'craft' the standard frame either. Be warned! 
---
Damn Fortnite strats 
---
Also put the timer for how long the holotape is, 0:20, 0:50, 1:30, etc, like in fallout 3.
---
My brother bought the xbox360/xboxone Fallout 3 yesterday. Played it and it is way different.  I know that, of course,
---
But looking at the scrap i picked up-  A LOT does not exist in fallout 76.
---
ANYWAY, when you play a holotape, you see a countdown timer so you know how long the tape is.
---
I wonder if they've forgotten about that, or if they chose not to have that detail???
---
We have fallout 4 and it didn't have the timer either
---
I think he means you don't have to use Rad-X and suppress your mutations
---
The hate for the shop comes from the misconception that Bethesda is working on the atom shop INSTEAD of the bug fixes. People don’t get that it’s two different teams of people and that updating the atom shop does not get in the way of patching the game. And throwing the people from the atom shop into the team of people patching the game is not going to speed anything up. 
---
To me 300h in a game is lots. I may be playing too many games at a time but I split my gaming time between  FO76, TD1, Warframe, Yakuza 0 and Apex Legends.
---
I will probably be bored of I played FO76 only.
---
Damn, that sucks. Hopefully they'll add some mods!
---
Thank you VERY much for letting me know about the receiver. That could have been bad!
---
A lot of complaining seems to be about what is in the store, and the cost of atoms and price of things, if there were a lot more things people wanted to buy. You know like if someone were to say $20 for this item? WTF? See if they had to buy the atoms that's how much it would cost. $5 for a door? Huh? A door that probably took like 5 minutes to make? I don't think they are managing the store very well. My personal opinion of course. And then there are the issues the game has. Some people wouldn't want to spend money when they are still experiencing technical problems. I personally got the Blackbird paints. Clean purifier because someone suggested it might give you more water. Silly me. I got some wood floorboards. An icon. That's about it really. And I still have a bunch of atoms. I've been waiting for the PipBoy with the stickers. One of the nicest items I have seen leaked for the store. I didn't even put the Blackbird paint on any PA. I only got it because it was limited time. I mainly only use Excavator and have NukaCola paint job on my T-51b. So yeah everyone has different opinions and perspectives.
---
psn: Silune
---
need help come find me, i dont mind helping anyone that needs or is looking for help on quests and such.
---
We made a strict agreement to only bring the pain the assholes. 
---
And even then, we only on contract. 
---
So, do yout little greifer thing. I'm sure you'll piss somebody off enough to call on us. If thats your thing.
---
I was also kind of wondering if there was a reason I was wrong.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I only have adrenal and marsupial. I run bloody, starched genes, and serendipity and don't want to put anymore points into luck.
---
The super mutants fighting liberators - overheard them saying "why won't they stop moving" or something to that effect.  Super mutants are cool and dumb!
---
Shame on you for what you're doing to the Fallout license.
---
I understand that items are expensive. But you literally don't have to pay money. They basically hand you atoms for blowing your nose. 
---
The point of it and what actually happens are 2 different things. Half the time i do it i'm the only one there.
---
Some events do already seem to 'activate' when a player shows up as well as being on a timer - Line in the Sand for example. I think it would encourage more participation with your suggestion.
---
Stagger them with melee....anti armor perks and weapons....they will die fast
---
Me same
---
The items are way too expensive for what they are worth honestly
---
not for fallout 76, no. 
---
I've never even researched the actual dollar price of any of the items because I've never had to think about using actual money. Most of the arguments I have seen from people stem around prices on items. But that's a failed point since in game currency is so easy to obtain. As far as amount of content, i feel like they roll something new out frequently. 
---
Too expensive with real world currency or in game? I understand its too expensive for real world. But in game earned atoms are so abundant you should never have to spend real money.
---
You're welcome. :)
---
Like others have said in this thread you can get them randomly in the world from containers, events and quests too so you will get them. 
---
so what do i do? i played for like 400 hours and now i cant even get the game to launch? i dont know what to do, ive tried to change my resolution, ive validated files but it keeps failing, ive uninstalled the game and reinstalled it overnight and its still not working. 
---
I have also heard the gamma gun doesn’t care about yo sentinel armor.
---
I know how to kill them, its just overwhelming the amount of people I run into with this armor. And I consider myself to be a highly skilled player so for the average player anytime they run into anybody like this they're going to die
---
I feel you on this. I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Love the world and idea of being online with other people but hate all the issues with connectivity, bugs, and gameplay quality. 
---
I do see that changes are happening it’s just unfortunate that it will be 6-8 months (or more) before we have the game we deserve. 
---
I’m guessing they didn’t release the game in China, since the government would get offended.  I’d love to know what they were saying
---
I actually have that exact 3* instigating the dragon with vats crit and 250DR! It’s a monster.
---
Real world yes and also kinda in game. I know the items are cosmetic but many are just not that special for what they should be worth. And I know thats slightly subjective but the majority of people have agreed that the cost of reskins and recolours of items are just way to high in both ingame and real world. Real world much much more so
---
I can definitely make out that they are saying “China”
---
I think they saying something along the lines of “long live China, for China, for the people of China”
---
Love the build. I had the same feeling after getting instrument plans. Mine is more of an amphitheater. 
---

---
Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim then I played WoW for a bit and then back to Skyrim. My friends then got tired of me playing solo so they brought me to League of Legends that was a real drag with a really toxic community. So I bought FO4 on my PS4 as a reason to use it as it had been gathering dust since I’m on PC. And ended up playing FO4 everyday for probably over a year I fell so in love with the game and coming from Skyrim as my last BGS game it wasnt hard to get into. Only thing is as I said I got tired of all the dialogues repeating and that there was no way to play with my friends.
---
This was also something I missed in Skyrim was so popular. Everyone had it, everyone was playing but alone.
---
FO76 represents a dream I’ve had for the last 10 year and although we have had a rollercoaster since launch im having a great time.
---
Hahha I stealthed and killed one from max range with my gauss. Very enjoyable 
---
You're so highly skilled. Why you complaining?
---
So my current gaming experience (level 106) is farm Whitesprings, farm West tek, onto harpers ferry and finally watoga (with a couple of place inbetween). Maybe, just maybe there will be a 3 stat Legendary. And maybe, just maybe its corpse won't just disappear or have no loot but a 3 star handmade or level action rifle. God knows what i'll do if i ever find one.
---
&gt;  that they definitely didn't get legit
---
How do you know? It's not that rare of a combo, if you disregard level and type.
---
What is this, darkest dungeon?
---
If its not that rare why is it the highest ticket item on ebay at 50 60 dollars a set?
---
&gt; I don't personally think they have lost anything other than the elitist gamer community
---
Lol? Bro you've been stuck in fo76 for too long, the general consensus is that this game sucks dick. Since launch fo76 has been one of the few positive places to talk about this game, and its been getting kinda bad in here lately. I'm not saying people think bethesda itself has gone down the shitter, I'm saying that the studio bethesda hired to make this game is objectively and measurably bad. They have done a more than poor job and it has **obviously** severely impacted sales or this game wouldn't have gone on discount almost **immediately** after launch. This shits all easily researchable. They've clearly lost a lot of good will with this particular venture.
---
Witches costume and top hat 🎩 (for when I’m in a Stevie Nicks mood) or Hunter’s Longcoat and the leather cap from the Atom shop, (sometimes Enclace officers hat) and the Stars and Stripes bandana, also from Atom shop. 
---
I think you missed out on the part where they nerfed TSE and left Melee the most powerfull build in the game. Or maybe TSE Shotguns are still an exception to the nerf if each pallet still has it's own explosion making 8 pallets an effective of +25% × 8 = 100 ballistic + 200% explosive dmg. That is 360% total damage with Demolition perk and i haven't even added the Two Shot bonus. If that's the case TSE Shotguns are still OP.
---
this is the beginning of the sword of basset quest for the mistress of mystery
---
even though you can earn atoms in game, spending the equivalent of 20$ for an armor paint job (the usual cost of a dlc add on) is pretty harsh in my opinion.. now with that being said i have bought a couple things out of the atom shop, sniper outfit, duster, blackbird paint, and still sittin on about 3k atoms, saving them if anything else comes up i just gotta have but still think things are pretty overpriced, if were cheaper i would prolly sink more into it, like the other pa paints but at 18$ a pop i just cant bite, and weapon paints only affecting one or two weapons just not worth it.
---
That’s for now, because you’ve been blowing through all the survival/combat challenges, after a couple more months you’ll have all the main challenges done and only weekly and daily left to do every week and that won’t get you atoms at even close to the same rate you’re getting them now
---
I meant other fallouts. Sorry you didn't understand that. I didn't need your small list of games.
---
Because I dont like to see exploiters win. Obviously youre on the other side and I cant wait til this gets nerfed cuz its only a matter of time
---
I think they're referring to [this quest](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ecological_Balance)
---
Yes and they are are just recolors wish they made reskins atleast or customization of some sort.
---
This is great.
---
But wait, doing this mission provides you with 11 cores? I’ve done this and do not remember collecting them. I only remember being able to use the workshop 
---
I get that we can pacify animals. But does this scorch beast appear every time you log in? Or do You have to pacify one every time 
---
Were you not able to spawn at the vault or somewhere else then block-and-bounce !?
---
I pulled 8 legendaries from whitesprings today in less that 2 complete runs,  got some good stuff for a change,  medics Lever, assassins handmade, 2 shot combat rifle, bloodied miners gauntlet.  As a rifle build it was a pretty good day 
---
What do you mean by the pack rat perk screwing others up?
---
Oh, that sucks. I'm getting. 50 cal guns (not that I care for them) and legendary armor and plans and whatnot. I'm in it for the plans and whatnot. Maybe the luck Stat has something to do with it? Hope your luck turns. 
---
And should require you to add a cap from your own stash to make it.
---
I did this too. Except I’m on the PS4 and I chose the northern region by the crashed space ship. Booted about 4 minutes into it
---
RIP your camp budget
---
This is something that needs to be designed in the engine from the beginning, or would require a massive engine upgrade and overhaul for it to be functional. 
---
Fans of The Division begged for this for years but never got it because the engine didn't allow it. If this engine does not have that API built in this will never happen. 
---
Based on the fact that there is currently no app, I would bet money on it not being possible. So don't get your hopes up. 
---
Scorchbeast tears
---
Ultracite receivers are different from prime receivers in several ways. Ultracite receivers take normal bullets, but have a damage bonus against scorched, and a damage Debuff against anything else. The anti-scorched training pistol has an ultracite receiver. The receiver also Lowers the damage, but against scorched its slightly better than a hardened receiver. I believe you can only unlock the ultracite receiver for combat rifles, 10mm pistols, and hunting rifles.
---
I am curious about one thing and that is your mention about picking up FO4 again. Are you playing only Fallout games? 
---
When I get bored of FO76 PvE which may be once my second character reaches lvl 50 I won't be going back to FO4 since there are too many new games coming out like Anthem, TD2, Metro Exodus and Rage 2. I also bought and need to start RDR2, MHW, Destiny 2, Spiderman and GOW. I can't imagine going back to FO4 given so many other great games are available I haven't even played yet.
---
Wait what!? The welcome mat is where you respawn?!? 
---
Someone figured out what was filling their stash. Then proceeded to sell the trash.
---
I made witch outfits, if you’d like one, send me a friend invite ingame (NordChick) and I’ll make you one 💖 Hopefully our time zones will sync.
---
Good luck man, I hope you don’t have to rebuild it
---
Congrats. Im level 150 and Im yet to join Enclaive. I hear the nuke silos are pretty intensive.
---
i reinstalled the game overnight while i was sleeping, it didnt work. if anything, its gotten worse. i used to see a black square, but now it just goes straight to the failure to launch error message. 
---
I usually put it in a suitcase next to the favorite is the one at witespring station next to the stash. 
---
You have to get the fusion core processor running. It takes 100 electricity, so getting the power plant back online provides the processor with power. It's to the right of the red workshop bench next to the substation by the door. You still need to build a generator and hook it up to it though. It takes time but if you sit there long enough you can collect as many as you want.
---
Well said. 
---
Destiny 2, currently one of the most polished, if not *the* most, games out right now has random public events just like this game. 
---
If you need to do Witches Ritual, you get to wait until it pops up. The only way to "cheese" the system is to clear other events as quickly as possible, as a new event pops up as soon as another is cleared. 
---
Hadn't thought about welcome mats. Interesting idea.
---
If i could change my thread titles i would but yes you are right. That is what i meant. All Prime Receivers are underwhelming. 
---
I mean, I was only playing FO4 again cause it was my favorite, and I just recentlygot all the dlc. As of this morning its updated to Metro Exodus, which holy shit. Bout 10 minutes in and its already looking like a top game to me. Clunky controls, but damn its good.
---
i think if you actually buy atoms its 100 atoms per dollar, and thats the thing, they roll out new stuff weekly hoping people spend all their in game given atoms and then have to buy atoms because of the new stuff coming out which turns into " omg this new armor paint came out and i only have 500 atoms, its 1800 and its limited time.." and have to buy 15$ worth of atoms to grab it before it disappears.. 
---
Either Bethesda missed someone during the sweep.....or duping is still a problem.
---
I doubt anyone felt the need to dupe 59 pieces of 1* nocturnal armor. So I'm guessing someone needed caps and apparently duping is still an issue.
---
I'm in U.S.  deal breaker? Lol
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
I use the little fence that is a defense it snaps and it is low
---
I’ve gotten a lot of good stuff. The last 10 or so times have been crappy.  Makes me wonder if I’ve hit a plateau.  I’ve gotten luck up to 10 but without changing stats that’s about my current limit.   Thanks for the good energy and good hunting to you too. 
---
Sounds more like Lyons' Brotherhood than Maxon's.
---
You know you can server hop right? Or spawn elsewhere and block them so they can't see you on the map.
---
Literally copy pasted
---
Not really, I am happy to post it but I am not sure if a UK edition would work for you?
---
Is that still a thing?
---
3 -1* Marine right arms
---
2- 1* Marine right legs
---
2- 1* Marine left arms
---
Must've been a shitty RNG run at Whitesprings?
---
Just a lot and I mean a lot of turrets 
---
Yep, and that illustrates the worst part of the multiplayer experience. I guess you need to take the bad with the good. As long as the good outweighs the bad. 
---
Maybe not. Thanks for being awesome though
---
Luck only affects the condition of found items, it doesn’t give you better loot.
---
I have only used atoms earned from in-game, too, but I think the pricing model is flawed overall. My guess is that they'd see the best overall return if the prices were 1/4 to 1/3 what they are today. More people would buy atoms to make purchases rather than grinding, and the increase atom purchase volume would not only offset the decreased revenue/unit from lower prices, but lead to significantly more profit overall. That said, the internal numbers they have may say otherwise, but I'd hazard a guess that they didn't do any sort of pricing research before launch.
---
If you have fusion generator plan you can claim the workshop build a generator and skip the power plant
---
I like that idea.   I read somewhere that they thought that it scaled.  So I gave it a try.  
---
ah ok yeah I’ve done this before but it only generated like 3 and no more than 3 per time.. I guess I could collect 3, 3, 3 and then 2 per hour for 11?
---
Hey. Bringing this up. I havent actually used the regular plasma weapons at all, but the enclave plasma seems to be hitscan. Are normal plasma weps hitscan too now or do they fire that ball of snot we're used to in FO4?
---
There not worth the resources to use when you can kill anything in this game with great effectiveness without them. 
---
Same thing now at the Watoga vendor.
---
This time a bunch of Nocturnal and a bunch of 1* wood armor pieces????
---
How do you do this? Or is this full buffs, perks, bloodied, unyielding, etc.?
---
I think Bethesda had a good idea but in reality it isn't working as expected. I would hope they split the two modes in March. PvP only and PvE only. My go to example is still The Division with the Light Zone and Dark Zone split. They even have diffirent currencies for each.
---
I’m in UK and on PS4 and I still love the game, just came here to say TOP MAN! Hopefully this brightens up somebody’s time! Great gesture!
---
i put a bright headlamp mod on my T60 and gained the atom icon also
---
Isn't it?
---
The only complaints about the shop are the crappy items in it and how fast it is updated compared to the actual game. Before that, it was the shady prices they put for some of the items. I don't know why you mention "hate". It's called criticism and it's 100% valid.
---
This is almost my favorite outfit, though I use the Ushanka hat, cause I can't deal with the 2 pairs of goggles. xD
---
I haven't tried this combo, but it sounds good. Does the neck of the mask match up okay to the suit?
---
Says the family member of a Bethesda employee
---
I’m confused. 
---
Why would you keep going broke? Do you lose caps for being killed?
---
Also don’t you have to accept PVP before they can kill you?
---
How
---
They should slash the cost by 1/3rd
---
You just answered your own question OP
---
A check mark next to it would probably work. 
---
I've similarly found an Instigating, +Vats crit damage Dragon handy, myself. Good looking out!
---
Best way to defend the people is to arm and equip them. Best way to defend knowledge is to make sure everyone has it. ;)
---
This is 5x unyielding, 3x3 slugger, radicool, sun kissed, bloodied mess, party boy, starched genes, twisted muscles, and some other shit I cant recall off the top of my head. 
---
I camped out there and grabbed it every time one popped up until I got tired and logged off. 
---
Might be worth holding onto it till the new PVE (Wild Appalachia)  &amp;  PVP content drops next month because if it turns out to be great you might end up kicking yourself for not hanging on and giving it a try to see if it appeals to you before passing your copy onto someone else, just a thought 🤔
---
There's sometimes some junk/explosive canisters in the uranium deposit. You'll have to blow them up (just shoot them From a distance) and/or otherwise remove the junk from the hole.
---
 You probably. ;)
---
You dont have to team with them, just add them to your friend list. When your done, remove them.
---
No one would bother duplication of such items. 
---
You lose caps even if your not wanted?   I didn’t know that, if true.   I’ve only been killed once and I was wanted because of looting supply drops when the rule changed. 
---
Also, does anyone else have trouble reading the messages? The paper is dark and stained and the font is one size too small for me.
---
That's awesome! I didn't know there were plans for them.
---
Thanks ! That was drivjng me nuts
---
I didn't.
---
My question was which of the 2 options is it.
---
Your response didn't contribute anything.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
So are vendors now selling 1* legendary gear?
---
Doing what we can. Getting new players equipped for their level makes a huge difference, and hopefully keeps them around. Plus, the interaction is almost always positive. 
---
I totally agree with the blackbird paint.. I didn't have the atoms at the time
---
If you kill the dishwasher, who's going to make the sandwiches? 🤔
---
“Either Bethesda missed someone during the sweep.....or duping is still a problem.”
---
Nah. You green horns complain about fusion cores like no other. Save power armor for tough fights or spec for it. I do that and i always got cores
---
Yeah, totally. Monthly would be okay, something with 100 atoms as a reward
---
There are so many actions in game that give daily credits in that shop, it's a non issue that there's microtransactions in it. 
---
Yup, but it dosallows placing of the support posts found under the "Stairs" category, which makes your roof look like it's floating, unlike the wire fence, but like I said the wire fence won't snap to second floors....
---
So which one is it?
---
You got the egg head mutation?
---
Someone cleaning out their Stash.  Plus/or the “seeded loot table” theory where one sees the same rolls on the same server session because RNG is based on a kernel. 
---
Yeah way over to the right in the misc items.
---
Try server hopping, my dude.    
---
At Lv40 it's possible to launch with the right gear or some tough backup but my advice would be to wait. In the meantime, server hop until you see a Nuke zone (or somebody high Level at any of the 3 sites)    
---
    
---
I explore ~3 Nuke zones each day so with a bit of persistence, you should find one. Or you can add me and I'll track down the materials you need
---
I can't see your point. The Brotherhood of Steal, I mean Steel, hoards technology to control and preserve them.
---
That is what they say, but it reality they hoard them for control and power.
---
This is the reason why most brotherhood members hated Elder Lyons, since he chose to help the wasteland, than doing what the brotherhood does which is keeping the technology for themselves.
---
So whenever you place it, that’s the spawn spot?!?! This is life changing breaking news jesus.
---
It seemed weird is all.
---
Multiple pieces of the exact same marine armor. Not a full set.....I mean 3 nocturnal Marine right arms.....3 nocturnal Marine left arms ......etc.
---
What’s up? I’ll give you what you desire.
---
That's the future... this is today. For a bunch of vault dwellers finding the ruins of the Appalachian chapter and rebuilding, it seemed the best course of action. 
---
I feel better seeing this at lvl70 and I have a hard time 
---
People are telling me I just suck. And maybe I do. But I still have fun, just takes me a little longer to defeat an enemy. 
---
A lot of good tips in this thread too!
---
Fishy by all accounts
---
Yes! Along with the subtitles - and this is on a 50" tv!
---
This made me chuckle and inspired a question. 
---
I know, that's what I was subtly referring to.
---
I think this is a great suggestion! There aren't really any safe spaces for people to truly congregate.
---
How long did that take you?
---
Has anyone really ? They're so easy to get and IMO challenges are one of the jewels of this game, alongside photo mode that bring that unique fun gameplay aspect. Why substitute real money for fun and challenging anticts ? Real dollar prices are SO steep too. 
---
But not worth duplication.  I throw such 1* items away every day.   
---
1'st part still matters because even with a fresh start you would be building your perks for a specific weapon like shotguns for example. If you die and lose your shotgun and maybe all your stash then you would be weak to start from scratch with other random weapons you find until you find a shotgun again that is complemented by your build. Bottom line is that the perk system kinda keeps you in place and doesn't give you the freedom to constantly start over like you do in other survivals. And the ability to destroy people's stash is also flawed since you see your own stash instead of theirs. There needs to be major changes to support this. Don't get me wrong i would love the idea. I'm just debating if it's doable with the engine's limitations on stash limit, player carry limit, perk system, nuke system and other stuff that might get in the way. If you suggest players to have separate containers then they would also have to change the common stashboxes you find near vendors. Also if you drop everything on death that means if you acciddently step into a fissure hole you automatically lose all legendary wepons and everything you have on you forever and olno ond can get it back. Or simply die in pve and get dissconected, all items gone. The more i think of the logistics the more demoralized i get. So at this point just losing the Aid Tab doesn't sound that bad.
---
hmmmmn.. Isn't the BoS chapter in Apalachia follows Maxon's ideals? I am pertaining to the founder, not in FO4.
---
I am glad you are helping people, it is just for me, kind of off with the lore.
---
These are my words coming out of your mouth (or being typed by your fingers, whatever). 
---
In all the posts I’ve seen complaining about the “cost” of Atomic Store items, I’m yet to see anyone acknowledge this simple little fact about economics:
---
“A thing is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it”. 
---
So, a few hundred Reddit users (Redditors?) have made posts about the “cost” of items being too high. A few thousand have commented on these posts to state their agreement. Somehow, these people are convinced that they are the majority of players...yet these posts and comments have not had any effect on the “cost” of items.
---
Bethesda didn’t just pluck these prices out of the sky. Trends were researched, data was analysed. I suspect that the most important indicator on whether or not they got this right, will be “projected vs actual” sales of atoms...and nobody on Reddit knows how that’s going!
---
The majority will have their say through actions, not words. 
---
I feel like the quality of the items and their value indicate the longevity of the game. They need to make money from item sales to justify spending money keeping the servers up. Crappy items at ridiculous prices means few sales. 
---
I believe it does. I would use a gatling gun and watch charging super mutants stop and grip their arms or something before being mowed down. But then again I did have it maxed out. 
---
It only gives you the passive bonuses of those stats.
---
If we're talking about the quest where you find the Overseer Caches with the Holotapes in them, they aren't marked on the map, no.
---
With INT u can unpick locks and hack much easier..with Strength it adds +5 carry weight for each Strength point..so 2 strength is +10 carry weight
---
World Boss events in Guild Wars 2 have a set timer that applies to all servers.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing one of the other vaults set up as a player hub, but not 76. Everybody tromping in and out of the area would kill the feel for newbies just coming out of the vault for the 1st time. It's a big world, let's leave 76 the way it is. 
---
I think Whitesprings would make a better hub. There is already a TON of (as yet) unused space inside. It is fairly centrally located. The only problem I see is you don't dare log out there outside of power armor. Otherwise you have about a decent chance of loading back into a nuke zone and dying as soon as you spawn in. 
---
How much cobalt do you need are you on pc?
---
Hats
---
Once I got the nuke thing out of my system, I don't feel the need to do it again, but I kill officers now simply to stop the noise. 
---
you don't need help to complete missions in this game
---
And ores and gun power in junk instead of being lost in misc with keys and cards adding unnecessary weight to my girl lol
---
only stacks have been removed, probably from sellers. you know, the people that don't even play the game? and just sell stuff on ebay and similar?
---
singles are still everywhere. people running with god rolls wherever you look.
---
You realize when they released this game that was there intent right. Right in the preview for it it had them saying you can even nuke other peoples base. I dont get why you would then proceed to get the game and then complain about something they highlighted you being able to do. If you learned how to spec out your player better you wouldnt have so many problems defending yourself
---
Wanted's caps shouldn't  disappear if the wanted person doesn't have enough caps to pay. It should stay forever until it's paid off. Talking about bankruptcy.
---
To make things worse for the wanted person = you can't trade with player or NPC vendor, join group, do events, daily quest, daily/weekly challenge until you've lost your wanted status.
---
Hey so I hear you on the vault suit upgrade but a couple a things:
---
One, you're better off picking up a brotherhood or enclave underarmor and upgrading that instead. The stats on even the middling upgrades are much better than the vault suit and it takes much less flux (2-4) to get a decent stat underarmor say 8/10/4 or 10/8/4 versus 5/5/5.
---
Two, you don't need to launch a nuke to reap the benefits of a nuke zone. Every other day someone is nuking Whitespring and there is a TON of flux to be had there. Mostly of the yellow, florescent and crimson variety. Some cobalt but generally not enough to even get one stable flux.
---
Three, Fight the queen! The reward generally includes a variety of stable flux. I fought one last night and two today and I've never launched a nuke myself. Maybe I'm just lucky but I don't think I've gone more than a play session or two without someone somewhere nuking something.
---
Grafton Rail Road Station, Camden Park, and Welch all have them. The plans will run you 250 caps. 
---
Just to clarify, you use the Fusion Generator to power up the Core Processor. The generator doesn't make the cores. (It confused me at first)
---
Is there good enemy farming there? 
---
Yeah had no luck even with it maxed out. Was also using a gatling gun. Might try using it again later.
---
People love echo chambers and monkey spheres. 
---
"A few people here agreed with me, which means EVERYONE agrees with me!" 
---
The Fusion Core Processor makes one every 7 and a half minutes. So 8 an hour. 
---
I can't even make up some of these complaints on this sub
---
If it’s gonna keep this game subscription free and help bring us free DLC then I am all for the Atom Shop. I just wish it had cooler stuff and less emphasis on silly, colorful items.
---
I grind out challenges and spend a couple bucks here and there. I don’t hate it. I just think they haven’t touched it’s full potential yet. 
---
They are not cute at mama dolces
---
&gt;  Scorchbeast wing flaps are another.
---
Can confirm. My GF was folding laundry the other day and it sounded like a scorch beast. Including the screeching. 
---
I found a Quad Crossbow farming nuked whitesprings. Decent low-to-mid single shot hits, but still slow to get all 4 shots loaded... it is my go-to for approaches using stealth.
---
Its got a smaller chance. Your best bet is to have stabilized and one gun army at the same time
---
The BoS chapter in Appalachia is dead. Every last one. Even found the graves... terrible tragedy. 
---
Going on the holos we found after the vault opened, and with the chapter dead and satellites down, you go with what you have. *I* never received any sort of directive from Elder Maxon, and based on his words from the tapes, containing the scorched and defending civilization seemed the top priority. 
---
I mean, if the real BoS ever showed up it would be a 50/50 on if they would let us actually join or shoot us and take our stuff. But until then, we just keep fighting the good fight. 
---
Seriously though, the lore from the other FO games hasn't happened yet. This is my first FO game personally, though most of our guys have played them all. You are not the only one to voice that. Given what's gone on already and our total lack of contact with anyone or anything outside of the region it gives us a huge amount of leeway with the lore. In the end, we are all just Vault Dwellers who emerged and started to rebuild. We are all just playing soldier, carrying on the ideals of the BoS as we understand them and in the way we want to. We COULD be all xenophobic and such... but both in and out of game, that's counter productive. 
---
Safeguard society? Check. They will be armed, equipped, and defended from griefers. 
---
Defend technology? Check. We do our best to expand our knowledge daily and insure its survival by entrusting it with as many of our members as possible. What's left is entrusted to our neighbors, in case we fall others can carry on. 
---
Given the limited knowledge we have to work with regarding the "real" BoS in game, it seems to fit well enough. 
---
Helpful thankyou. 
---
But jeez ! I hope your graphics aren't all the way maxed and that western outfit isn't default that low res, especially around the collar. 
---
OP tries to make it seem like pvp'ers can 1 shot him in the back with just 1 bullet instead of 100 while he is wearing pacifist mode. OP is just a nagging woosie.
---
So this is only for the t51?
---
Oh wow, 1000 times yes!
---
Thank you for voicing out your opinion. Again, don't get me wrong, I am glad you are helping people.
---
Yeah. I run the whole heavy weapon build. Didnt notice that perk till recently just tryed it today in harpers ferry and didnt see any staggers might try some ghouls or robots tonight and look for missing limbs
---
Hello? Are you still there?
---
Damn, you should’ve been playing with me last night man. Three nukes in ten minutes. 
---
What do you want
---
Probably dupers trying to remultiply their lost weapons from the one Bethesda left.
---
What you can do is put them away in your stash cause they dont weigh anything
---
I know it doesn't sit well lore-wise with the image many have if the BoS. We had to use some creative interpretations to fit it, but the lore with regards to FO76 is really more open than many want to believe. 
---
Yea, the BoS will turn ugly in the future. But we'll all be dead by then. I don't see what's going on as grossly out of character for the lore as it is at this point in the timeline, and even if folks disagree, that's ok. 
---
We're all just Vault dwellers playing soldier, either way. :)
---
Yeah every time you get killed you lose caps. The caps also matches your level so if you level 50 you lose 50 caps, if you you 200, you lose 200, you see where this is going. Op could of easily server hopped but probably was trying to recover his loot bag which was a mistake 
---
I'm trying to make excavator power armor but I don't have the stuff, add me, my gamer tag is TornadoSmash999
---
I actually like your idea that once they reach a bounty of the amount of caps that they have on hand oh, that they can no longer do PVP damage against non-hostile players
---
So if you have 10 caps and you have a 10 cap bounty, then you can only attack hostile players and hostile players camps
---
System: PS4
---
Anyone else experiencing these? I’ve only noticed them in the last 2 days:
---
Invisibility - my character drifts in and out of transparency when I’m sneaking in a heavily populated area/building. This isn’t even a stealth build in playing - I’ve put no perks into agility and I’m not using a stealthboy so it must be some kind of rendering issue?
---
Not able to move when fast travelling - if you fast travel into an area with immediate hostile enemies and try to open your pip boy, you get stuck in a loop where your character has their arm out (as if looking at the pip boy) but you can’t cancel/move/fight back. Only way to fix it is allow enemies to kill you or restart.
---
Also, I’m not really sure if this is a bug but is it normal for a whole building to be immediately hostile when you enter it? For example, the medical centre in Charleston, every time I enter I’ve got 10-12 scorched on the other side greeting me.
---
Your nuke codes were duped 
---
That doesn’t always work because of  bugs and a bad design but in theory he should have been able to but I bet he couldn’t. What he could of done is just change worlds 
---
Of course the other alternative is the possibility of having a negative cap balance. But that doesn't really work with the lore ... not like we have banks in Fallout
---
When crafting everything....
---
Did I make 14 CPU cores or 10 before that assaultron found.me...
---
How can anyone use these weapons? You get 1 shot, then it takes like 6 seconds to re-load. Enemies usually fight in groups.
---
It's funny I was just thinking of this the other day myself
---
That Fallout 76 would be the perfect player hub, and Marketplace.
---
And also it should be a no PVP Zone
---
Stats don't affect your perk points, they are always fixed. Even when you receive negative conditions that reduce stats it won't affect your perks. Stats are just special bonuses you get.
---
I would be happy to help.  Name is the same as it is here.
---
Ahh ok, so he’s saying people just unload clips on him which eventually kill him? 1 shot isn’t possible without retaliation right? 
---
Take Grafton steel or the converted munitions factory. Bring tons of steel and aluminum. 
---
Repair the vertibird pad. Kill the vertibird. Repair it and repeat. 8 steel 6 aluminum per vertibird. 
---
So when I see a lvl 77 with a 5 or 10 red cap on map is the bounty thief lvl + that number? 
---
I sympathize.  I finally got the initiate paint to drop yesterday. Must have turned in around 70 or 80 at this point. (not counting the initial stack of 53). It's totally random and stupidly rare. I'm surprised the resell value is so low as I've seen it
---
This.
---
The beeping drives me insane when I'm trying to listen for anything that can actually kill me coming along.
---
You don't actually have to add anyone on Xbox anyway just screen shot the recents list before you do something important. That being said it seems that the servers do crash and drop everyone. I
---
 have been dropped with groups many times.
---
Thanks man!
---
Check if there are updates for your GPU driver and/or dust out your computer as this doesn't really sound like a game issue.
---
Plus, just to be on the safe side, click on Game Options in the Bethesda launcher and perform a scan and repair.
---
Nope, impossible to get 1 shoted in pacifist mode. It takes several clips and patience to bring someone's health down and you have to pray that someone doesn't use a stimpack bringing him to full health because then you just lost all your  ammo for nothing 
---
Tried the same with my tse gauss plus sneak and Covert Op multiplier, landed five shots, dude must've had sentinel armor set cause hardly any damage. Odd thing was is that he was moving when I hit him, so I figured maybe Cavaliers set. Then snuck up when he was sitting still, bam three shots, vats headshots. Barely did any damage. Even popped in psychotats for that. Server hopped before he could find me xD
---
If you are talking about the bone meal it’s a different slot.  It’s on top.
---
I'm level 150 and still get atoms frequently.
---
Enclave officers uniform on my main. Moleman head piece and the atom Duster on my melee cannibal alt. 
---
I'm referring to those turrets in portal
---
Yes, but not having to switch out perk cards each time you need to pop a few rad-away is nice too.
---
Right but the games only been out for a few months. If you play this game for years like they intend you to, you’ll reach that point where the atoms slow down to a trickle.
---
They're asking if you have any mods installed. After game updates, outdated mods might render the game unable to launch.
---
It has a total different team working on updates for the atomic shop. The people who work on in game updates don't work on the atomic shop. Shady prices? Explain. Crappy items are an opinion. 
---
I love the use of ground foundations and stairs, with varying angles and heights.
---
I have one and I don't know what to do with it.
---
Xbone: piallator
---
I got 8 or 9 weapons with the Bloodied prefix. Mostly garbage but I shall keep the Bloodied Automatic Handmade. Only level 35 but with the comically large drum mag it's decent enough to support my build.
---
I made a post about this two days ago. Bethesda missed a lot of stacks of duped weapons. I know two people that had some stacks in their inventory removed while other stacks on same character were left alone. Less than ten people on my friends list play 76 and two of them still have stacks of duped items. Now imagine all the other people out there I don’t know. They may have removed a lot of the duped items in the game but they definitely didn’t remove all of the item types they said they did. 
---
What system u on?
---
Absolutely agree
---
Lucky!!!! I’ve seen it cheap also ,I can get one for 150 -300 caps ;but it’s the principle of it I wanna earn it ! Lol!! But this is bordering on the ridiculous!!! Know if any BOS  teams on here?
---
How much money are they really making on cosmetic items that you can easily afford by completing in game challenges? They don't really seem to be money grubbing in the shop when they hand out atoms like its malaria in an African village. Also, crappy items is an opinion. 
---
If anyone is interested, I got it to work!

Using this video that shows you how to stack concrete foundations, I was able to build foundations up to my balcony, snap on the fences that WILL work with metal posts, remove the foundation, snap a floor in, and then place the posts:

&gt; obscene amounts of powerful Colonel Gutsy robots 
---
any number of Gutsys are ridiculously powerful. Scary thoughts.
---
I got all the way to the white springs station and got blue screened lol
---
Never played portal, #roastme
---
76776 😀
---
Xbox one , know of any Brotherhood teams to join??
---
Wow.  Thanks!
---
I logged back in and luckily was able to gather some resources by a nuked prime site so not all is lost lol
---
How can you say thats what they are trying to do? Take that tinfoil hat off pal.
---
LOL.  Well, clowns ARE evil.   Thanks!
---
I want one as a pet.
---
It’s the bounty. If you hover over the red cap it will tell you what their level is.
---
Got it. But to pick locks, I’ll need at least level 1 card right? 
---
Xbox one , know of any BOS teams playing looking for members?
---
*miner spoiler :)
---
I like it, I'll offer up my time to be the first credit bureau of the wasteland lol. NO one escapes the creditors.
---
No, and you cant take it from me either.
---
I'm carrying 58 on my character but I spend a lot of time just cruising the forest and toxic valley, so I'm out of power armour quit a bit. I only use it in the higher level areas (and I was lucky enough to farm a load before they nerfed the fusion core resources).
---
I've not had a problem with then draining fast but I don't have the jet pack and I tend not to sprint whilst in PA.
---
I'd barely have enough SPECIAL points for my weapons if I kept using ones to reduce my FC usage though 
---
Only if the required skill is 1 u start with zero..the INT boost is if u are lockpicking or hacking that has nothing to do with the requirement level to pick locks
---
Twin lakes has worked for me for the few times I’ve bothered finding a behemoth. He’s wallowing in the pond just to the east over the mountainy ridge from twin lakes. Might just be unlucky and he’s already dead if you can’t find him (He’s pretty hard to miss)
---
At first there was just high level super mutants... Wish I could tell ya more but I was booted too fast lol
---
Ahhh thanks 
---
Thank you for this! 
---
Btw grahm still needs to be server hopped for plans
---
Maybe we could do an event at Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant, where we fire up some machinery to create Nuka-Cola products? Could create 10 to 15 different Nuka-Colas, which would be distributed to players based on the health of the machinery. Essentially, like the Tea Time or Feed the People events, but rare Nuka-Cola. 
---
Could also do it as a daily, where a player reads a terminal, specifies the cola(s) they want, and then starts the quest/event.
---
Ah I see that's how the monongah power plant was, just super mutants and a couple glowing stray dogs.
---
Ooh thank you this is perfect! I love collecting outfits and didn’t know these exist nor what they look like so it’ll be an exciting grind :)
---
Very nice!
---
Were they all the same exact piece? In my own experience, I will drop certain legendary effects over and over during a session. Does anyone else experience that?
---
FO76 runs on the same engine as FO4, and FO4 has a Pipboy app...
---
This is very cool and clever. 
---
They're adorable. I'd love to have one as a "pet".
---
Directly south of Solomon’s pond. I think it’s the same one the other redditor is suggesting but he is more west of the mountain range. It’s a consistent spawn, he is crouched down and there is a big blue pipe and toxic barrels in the pond. Just server hop until you get him 
---
I got it from an event, don't remember which...
---
Give all the Gutsys Assault rifles too... then they'd be sorry. 
---
It was 2 fecking months ago... Game went to shit since then. 
---
PA skins and skins for popular weapons. Im sure these have already been mention but maybe Beth will see this lol
---
Mods are still random at the vendors, I usually find dense mods in watoga. If you are on PC and are looking for marine dense mod, I have an extra you can have.
---
All we need now are the sacrificed bodies of virgins on the stairs.
---
One of the warning alert beeps from a conveyor in a factory I work at makes the same sound. I'm always scrambling to find my 10mm
---
Hooray for decent people!   
---
There are 4 easily available Cores in Watoga, if you ever run out again. Sometimes you have to server hop because someone else has gotten them first, but most of the time I get at least 2-3.
---
It would work but he wouldn't be able to buy anything for the game.

*Wanna Nuka Cranberry?*
---
I require a robot shop. That was my favorite part of fo4, customizing robots to farm for me and as companions. Then using them to set up trade routes so occasionally when I was out exploring one of my super robots would come over the horizon to bust some ass. I know that part isn't in this game but I still want to just customize a bunch of cute and evil robots. 
---
Look at the cost. The number of wearable items have gone down in game for favor of using the atom store. Thats ok, except dont make the price of everything so expensive.
---
Most of the turrets can be shut down via terminals, at around lvl 80 I was running them without PA, the reactor room is the hardest section to get through.
---
Where they all multiples of the same piece or 59 mostly unique items ?
---
I can nuke WhiteSprings, run the circle with a club house pull 3 times before long respawn. During this time I can get around 30 legendary drops. 98% of witch are garbage and get sold or dropped. If I haven’t cleared out the vendors for the day, I go and sale everything to a vendor. So to see that many times back up for sale doesn’t mean it’s duped.
---
Please update the C.A.M.P. build limit. Even another 10% would be amazing. Or make "decorations" not count, or something. I need more clutter!
---
Yeah that's why I asked. I died once and my respawn screen had no respawn points to choose. Strange bug I only had that one time. 
---
Alright guys, let me break down why this shop makes people *feel* like it's a shit deal.
---
If you want to actually put money into the shop and buy atoms the value you get for your money is *garbage.*
---
Since it is literally the same currency you earn through challenges, there will *never* be a point where you buy some atoms and *don't* think "if I just waited a couple days I could have gotten that for free."
---
Basically, even though the currency you earn in game is pretty generous, it does nothing to stop the fact that the shop *feels* like it is a terrible value for your money.
---
Considering the entire point of a MtX shop is to make money for the company, and a *vast* majority of people are only spending the atoms they earn in game, and yet a sizeable number of people are still extremely unhappy with the store... I would call this the worst attempt at an MtX store by orders of magnitude.
---
got mine from one of the frequent mod spawns at pleasent valley cabins 
---
I have been looking for combat dense for weeks and weeks now, have seen a bunch of marine dense tho 
---
wouldnt mind having one to follow me around with a couple .50 cals on either side of its head as a sort of walking turret companion..
---
"I'm a super casual player"
---
"115 hours since launch"  
---
Bro, that's not casual...
---
Awesome ...TY both was going to both “twin lakes” not realizing there is another lake/pond further west +karma 
---
I've only ever had a few occasions where a stranger has actually accepted what I've dropped.
---
I'm level 122, and I spend a lot of time in the forest (my camps there), so now and again I'll stop by Flatwoods and help out some lower levels doing the Fertile Soil event.
---
I'll try and grab their attention to drop some stuff (plans, ammo, low level weapons they can use, etc) but they run off...
---
I've been involved in some events and had a convo about how it wouldn't let either of us pick up the required items. But we parted ways without exchanging anything.
---
I see a lot of stories about people having nice experiences but I haven't had anything close to theirs.
---
Ps4?
---
it's better then Oregon Trail
---
I like finding a good weapon that's way too low a level, so instead of selling it for 10 caps I find someone the right level range and give it to them along with some stimpacks, water and any plans I've got on me. 
---
Thanks! I didn’t even think of jumping servers last night! I’ll try again tonight (: 
---
I play ok PC. The shielded needs 4 but making the 4 cobalt takes so so much from the nuke zone
---
I would add a 6.  Any bounty you have is also passed onto team mates, to prevent the surprise bait and gank.
---
Okay! I’ll look at what I have in my inventory and see what they need to be modified! Thank you :D
---
Will add!
---
I've done polls in multiple places asking people who has actually put money into the atom store versus just using the free currency they got.
---
Across all platforms I could address, the overwhelming majority (consistently 85-90%) we're saying they had seen no reason to put money into the game.
---
Considering the point of an MtX shop is to make money for the game, and there are still a number of people unhappy with the state of the store despite the fact they are buying stuff from it without even putting money in would suggest that the store isn't really working out so well.
---
I just wish I could work on other people's face as a plastic surgeon in game. 
---
My buddy runs a melee build and I always hear him complaining that he will miss 3 or 4 p5% vats in a row.
---
I quit playing becuase of this.  Hoped the purge would get rid of the cheat weapons, but nope..  It's practically endorsed by Bethesda.  Either buy a TSE yourself, live with cheaters getting everything, or stop playing.  I chose the latter.
---
Couple days in and it's still a problem. Seems to be better but it still happens more times than not. Even when spawing at my camp, which is in a somewhat empty area and is two water purifiers, cooking pot and a bed. Had to wait 2-3 minutes more than a few times. 
---
[More minor spoilers] Now that I think about it, and I might be wrong, you are referring to the final stage of the "Personal Matters" questline. The Overseer's Mission has one final tape when you leave one of the launch sites. I think *that* might be what he is missing.
---
I got a 3* missile launcher today, left it in a cabinet.
---
Having a tamed Deathclaw attacks your base. If you remove the power generator he will stop attacking the base. But a base with no power = no water. You can't remove a pet from your base or even store it.
---
Doing the powering up events will give you the plans. 
---
Interesting idea. I prefer keeping the bait and gank tactic in the game. We just need to make sure people are not getting jipped once they realize they got 0 caps and then killed by the Wanted players team-mates. Nothing wrong with someone trying to boast around with 1000 caps on their name.... but getting 1 cap for killing him isn't right. Even someone whos bankrupt still able to destroy buildings is whack. 
---
I would take it for a friend in Spain, Would be awesome to have some company in the game it's been lonely for me lately
---
If you are making bullets, lead and steel are required. Iron is refined into steel using acid. Copper not as much, keep 50 and bulk the rest for sale....
---
Only since it once in 300 hours but there is a blank attacking white springs encounter of 2 behemoths with 3 super mutant masters.
---
Well it has been out almost 100 days.
---
Used to run around in the dirty ass civil war era dress, but now I just stick to the vault jumpsuit and the clown hat. Not sure if mutants can see my hat over the top of walls though cause they sure find me quickly!
---
Yet most gamers don't roam forums. Just an important fact folks don't acknowledge for some reason.
---
i have no idea where that SB came from.  i put my character to bed, walked away from PC for a bit.  came back about 15 minutes later, went to my work room, and there it was, just laying there.  came back after a bit, and it was gone.
---
I’ll take it. When would you be available to make the trade? Does 8pm EST work? 
---
Grouped by time/date of pickup would be nice. 
---
Found one in the blackwater mine as a world drop. One psn willing to sell though may not be on till monday
---
REAL
---
Yeah, most gamers don't roam Facebook.
---
You're not wrong, but c'mon guy. Don't argue based on assumptions.
---
Wallpaper/paint for camps, nicer hairstyles cause the ones for female characters always look like they’ve been dragged through a bush backwards.
---
Half-yes. My screen started doing the weird color / not full full thing after the last Jan patch but does not crash. It does pause and then the spinning wheel goes 4x normal speed for a bit. 
---
I keep picking up bottle caps at work. It just happens subconsciously. 
---
Front looks good, however I'm betting the back looks shite lol.
---
Yeah, square give it away? 
---
There is something seriously wrong with VATS percentages. 
---
Had the same issue while toying around with some two-shot rifles. 95% and 4 in 5 shots were a miss. 
---
The odd thing is that nowadays i'm using a two-shot rifle with a .50 cal receiver and the % is quite accurate. 
---
I have no clue what's causing this, just here to confirm i encountered a similar issue.
---
i always dump junk in the trash can next to the stash in red rocket, at flatwoods. i have not played for a few days. but something to keep in mind you might find my leftovers. :)
---
Sure.  Gt?
---
Has a 1lb carry weight limit. 
---
That's great, I'll be sure to keep an eye out.
---
My GT is RaBD Xeno. Yours?
---
Yessssss. Free fast travel is already there. 
---
Fair enough, lets modify it a little then so rather than actually passing the bounty on you just make them attackable with no penalty, the same as if you were attacking someone with a bounty.  This way you can at least do some sort of counter play without putting a bounty on yourself.
---
oh i have not finished the enclave quest. 
---
My first vast shot at 95% misses often, seems like 50/50, but the second usually hits like it should.
---
I’ve luckily only come across 1 griefer since playing, but all I can suggest is just blocking them. Playing with other people makes it easier too so if someone does keep killing you, a friend can pick up your dropped loot/fight with you.
---
Look into joining up with some teams or put your username out there and see if anyone wants to join up with you, I’m sure you’d find numerous people who’d be more than happy to play alongside you
---
Up until recently, I was on the un-ending question for Raider Torso Dense Mod and finally bought it at Camden park. As has been said, by others it's still random, but it's always worth taking a peak at each vendor's mods section just in case ;)
---
Yes, that's how marketing works. It's no more evil then a flash sale at Walmart
---
Your statements just as much a hyperbole as theirs. 
---
The division was much prettier and more perfect than this game when it was released years ago. 
---
Maybe they wanted a product that is what was promised? False advertising kind of sucks. 
---
If they said it was an early access game and that's what you were paying for I feel there would have been less backlash than saying it's a finished product.
---
🔥🔥
---
The Gauss rifles have had that bug using vats since FO4. I had hoped they would have fixed it with FO76, always carried a 2 shot gauss in FO4 and now in FO76.
---
Unbulk the steel and iron. It’s way more weight than you need.
---
It is manageable! You just have to make sure you’re using the right fence and placing it in the right spot. Might take a couple of attempts but should work in the end. I haven’t been able to do it on my own base as I don’t have the right fences, but my bf is able to
---
You got me at "including the screeching". Well played. 
---
feel free to help me out with it :P pc: igotasweetass
---
I could be wrong, but most people say it is just gibberish. This kinda makes sense because they were presumably released by the enclave to create a state of emergency and open the silos (if i understand their terminals correctly.)
---
Apperently you've never played battlefield 5 either ;).
---
It's all about those social media "clicks". 
---
Gift me it then
---
I wear a bomber jacket, not the one in the Atom shop, but the one that has an orange high altitude flight suit under it, plus a military cap. I've never seen anyone wear it, plus it looks less worn and tattered than other clothes I've seen.
---
Great idea. I’m totally going to do this! Love your pictures.
---
That would be interesting. Flag all team-mates as hostile with the bounty man. You can still sneak and hide but your still vulnerable if finds you anticipating the setup. 
---
Well I have an extra BOS paint if you would like it. I wont be on till around 10 PM central USA time
---
I've actually tested this with and without the relevant perk card. As for taking damage, that's a non-issue since most things die before they make it to me.
---
Holo tapes maybe, but notes? You have to read them before you can even take them. 
---
Haha, first time it happened to me I made it inside the bunker entrance but the card reader took too long to respond and I got extra crispy just as it opened...
---
That’s exactly what this fuck-stick sounds like - every “nice guy” I’ve ever seen. 
---
“I’m a cool guy, just give me what I want. No, you don’t want to? Fucking bitch.”
---
It's quite possibly a bug that's affecting my VATS usage because I only wish I never had to worry about my fusion cores. All I know is that the thing that's tearing through them quickly like that is definitely my VATS usage. I don't know if your build uses the same perks as mine, but I'm deeply invested in the Luck perk and have the ones that refresh all AP and fill my crit meter faster. That might be making my usage spike even further.
---
One of the first settlements i encountered in the wild was a stage like build. It has like a podium, chairs.. and an electric chair as centre piece :)
---
Either the skull mask and costume, or a pirate hat goggles and red sequined dress
---
How did the stew taste?
