Come on...the survival in this game is piss easy. You literally don't even need to try. As a survival game this is a failure.

Cool im aERAGON0303, I'll add you when Im on. Lately I have been building up my junk supply in my Fallout First server, so if you see me on you are always welcome to join in.
---
Well hope you enjoy playing wack a mole rat.      
---
       
---
Sorry my idea made you mad.
---
I don’t use shotguns
---
No
---
Can I still buy it
---
Awesome, the Xbox app is good for messaging even tho I’ve got pretty fast typing with my controller I’ll never be as fast as just typing on my phone lol I’ve not been on my Xbox in a few weeks, tho I was in hospital for 8 nights so got far to into some mobile games lmao
---
You can't place a tent unless you have fallout 1st
---
Appreciate any tip. Though the asylum has been way too crowded lately. Everyone seems to be farming it on Xbox now. It’s wiped clean on most server jumps lately

You learn none by scrapping. Check [this awesome spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311) for more info.
---
Oh wow! I hope you are feeling better! 8 nights in a hospital could be the next five nights at Freddie's!
---
Exactly haha he faked it and has been roaming the wastelands of West Virginia
---
It’s in the dev room
---
oh ok. i don’t really watch tv much
---
If you want to send me a request so we're on each other's social list, I'll invite you to a server anytime I'm doing an event/quest with others in case you're free at the time. Good luck!

Edit: no worries about the mic, I only use mine when others require it. Otherwise the PSN messaging app on phone is really easy and quick to use
---
PC user, used to communicating without mics etc. For what it's worth if u ever cross the bridge id be happy to party :)

If you find a bow with an explosive major modifier it is hacked in.

Ok so if I buy the 1 year subscription and don’t renew it will will still be able to place the rent down
---
Lol my gallbladder was infected I’ve never felt pain like it so I was on 2 types of intravenous antibiotics 4 times a day all my canulars kept failing tho so in the end it was in my index finger knuckle !! And now I’m on antibiotics cause it’s infected!!, fml
---
I loved the heavy incinerator. The AGL is close in this game, but I don't know if it is as much fun as the incinerator was.
---
Hey there! I’m totally up for helping a first-time nuke launch. I have a mic and I can talk you through the process if you’d like. What is the latest that you’re planning on staying on?
---
My husbands Xbox is hard wired, I’m on WiFi. Interestingly enough we notice (at least guess given load times, ect) that my Xbox tries to pull host over his often. Public or private. We have over 200mbps internet speed and I know it’s not the most possible speed wise...but I imagine a majority has less. Often I disconnect when he doesn’t and he assumes host migration was the cause. I don’t know a ton of how this works, but it must be at play. Especially given all of Bethesda’s servers are cloud.
---
Could you imagine a bloody fixer with a .308 receiver?  LOL.
---
You need to go to Reddit's support page. The mods here can't help you with that.
---
General curiosity:  How well does PS4 cater to the deaf audience?  Do they have some sort of speech to text function where if I'm chatting on mic, you can read what I'm saying?  Pardon the ignorance.  I really don't know much about it.  But I'm glad the community has rallied around you and given you so many options!
---
K thanks man
---
That would be OP lol. I like the idea but I don’t think we need to go making those things and more valuable than they already are. 
---
I just feel like once you get a handmade there’s not much use for the AR... Seems like an oversight not one commando gun shoots .308. They would instantly become viable to people with better a hm.
---
Yes, gt otannehill
---
Certain dailies give treasury notes and I think it's every daily that came with the wastelanders update. 
---
I believe only Events that have the exclamation mark over it or give you a notification at the top left when they start gives treasury notes.
---
Make them quest like though, not the bullshit hard to track challenges!
---
If only the branches didn’t span put of the case in every direction 😢
---
I laughed way too hard at that comment!
---
Monster Mash event in all honesty.
---
Halloween candy is light and counts.
---
I have like 360pc I save just for that challenge
---
It happens when you fire too fast if you bash it will fix it and let you reload
---
I saw your name once
---
That would be pretty awesome or just be able to eject in general. Jet pack to a roof and eject, I wouldn’t bother with the SS jet pack anymore 😂
---
I’ll bet the softshell mirelurk sandwich is delicious 😋
---
I vote for H&amp;K P90c
---
to be honest, i hope they at least keep the melee hits explode enemies, it sounds both stupid and fun at the same time and i really want to test that out with my DC Gauntlet. but otherwise yeah outside of a couple of others, those legendary perks do need more work...
---
Start with a month mate and yes your tent will appear and you can use the skins you've unlocked for it by making them a 'favourite' thru the atom store menu.
---
You're an awesome dad
---
I read that it is best to do around lvl 50 for drop reasons. Is this true?
---
The large heavy laser rifles to match the Plasma Caster! Then remove all the shitty hunting rifles from the super Mutants, they should only carry minigun, missile launchers, heavy laser rifles, and plasma casters!
---
Not always. Got a two shot explosive minigun off one like ~ 10 days ago.
---
A friend of mine was extremely lucky and got an explosive handmade...
---
Crossplay would be great. At least Xbox-Ps4/5...
---
I just use my Private Server to farm these cores. I take like 2 plants and that‘s enough fusion cores for like 3 weeks
---
So if I buy a month then cancel I can still use the tent yes
---
I hate chatting anyways, I’m to shy. 
---
ATGarbar is my psn ID anyone can add me I play a variety of games.
---
Bethesda should just remove pipe weapons and bad melee weapons from the SBQ pool.
---
When November rolls around and Cyberpunk 2077 comes out, a lot of my time is gonna go into that instead of 76.
---
I know there is an app for Apple - PS4 second screen - that is pretty fun if you do. To know of it.  If you use a PS4 party it will translate everything into text, and when you type a reply it will read it out.  Makes teaming up a little easier!
---
I love when the npc's give you dialog like that. I remember I was suprized when a raider npc pointed out my automatic gun because she said never had enough ammo to use one. Really builds emerson in the game
---
Me and my (older)brother, who is a younger level than me (ex: I’m around 110 and he’s like 70-80) decided to take over one of the power plants, but as soon as we did some 290-300 level player decided to mess with us, so, for the next 45 minutes of that session we had a back and forth with this player. Our only edge was my stealth suit and my 2 shot auto grenade launcher
---
Needless to say we smacked him, though he had a bunch of explosives weapons, so it was hard
---
It’s called the PlayStation messaging app lol, but some people can’t be bothered to download that either. I’ll have no problem typing back to you
---
the laser rifle and plasma rifle from Fallout 3 onwards were such puny dissipointments. Glad to see the return of the Plasma Caster but we needs its laser brother also!
---
I’ve never even heard of this event lol
---
thats a shit ton of can traps.. holy smokes
---
Yes but only for a month. No pay no tent.
---
Ok thanks
---
I for one also don't use a mic cuz i am kinda insecure of my voice, I could suggest looking for fallout streamers who play on ps4 and ask their chat, there's usually a ton of friendly people. U could probably also play with the streamer, but someone would have to write what yall r going to be doing
---
Mjdemon27
---
Hundreds of hours but never worked on a build or anything so I’m not OP at all.
---
It takes place in Watoga at the High School. Not a Public one.
---
Oh ok that makes sense then lmao
---
Encountered a level 51 player with an explosive handmade today. Engaged PVP with my level 120 character, wrecked me in seconds despite being in a full X-01 suit with a Stim Pump. Even though I used an Explosive Mingun on him, he got nearly no damage. Not sure if this guy is a hacker
---
I hate the PVP System in this game, it is just crippled.
---
HAHA
---
PSN: BigHa1rcut
---
Play almost every evening (mountain time) and would be willing to team up if you ever need someone! Text chat is cool with me!
---
Wimbimftangftang with headset. Also recruiting for Enclave clan.
---
With a headset that puts words into chat?
---
the Tesla cannon.
---
I think this may fit in Fo76
---
Ahh bummer! Good luck
---
Hey, buddy! I'm also micless and been looking for some running buddies myself recently so I'll add you! If you see me online don't hesitate to come and give me a wave! When I'm not vendor hopping I'm running whatever events are available so there's rarely a dull moment ;)
---
I'd be glad to game with you at some point. I'll add you when I can if you'd like!
---
Hey the PSN message app you can get for your phone  is pretty useful for situations like this. Its what I used to do before I got a mic
---
If you take the Billings Homestead workshop (I think thats the one near Nuka Cola plant) and get the factory going you can set it to make fancy lads snack cakes. Just lock it and come back and collect from time to time. I have a small stash now for this daily
---
You ever play h1z1? It's free.
---
I think it's more than burnout though. Sure we're all depressed,  the lack of social interaction does that for anyone.  But; bugthesduh did one hell of a job getting us to overpay for the crapfest that was the launch of this still unpolished turd.
---
 After a year and a half it's what should be expected of a launch-state game. And the lack of anything but grinding as a game mechanism is total ballshoy. There was 2 things in the atom shop that piqued my interest over the past year. And I still think I've experienced more glitches bugs and crashes than all of Windows going back to Windows 93 (at least). I fully expect the game to crash my XBox so hard it'll only bring up an MS-DOS prompt and where's ctrl+alt+delete on an XBox controller? 
---
I actually made a game from the crashes. I play until the game crashes and then play something else.  Got up to 4 hours last week. THEY DON'T CARE (want proof try a support ticket) , Won't care and are gonna milk every penny they can outta this. Which is sad because they've got the bones of two decent games but can't commit to get either right.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind idea. *But dear god, if they are as grindy as they were before the Christmas Event, I will not do it.*
---
Looking at the plasma nade plans and robot armor plans. Those were huge grinds with a stupidly low chance before the Christmas update.
---
But but... I like typing on computers.... It makes me feel special :(
---
Sorry if I'm being stupid, but they're joking as in you shouldnt do this because it will complete the challenges and you wont get score from it, right?
---
I second this. Monster mash will keep you satisfied for days.... I don’t think you’ll have this challenge again after patch 20 though.
---
Just generally more traditional looking weapons, like the Service Rifle, or the 9mm Pistol.
---
I’m super confused here. The backpack and tent are two different things.
---
I don’t even use a mic! I try to make friends without one but have similar difficulties. I’m a pretty fast typer tho so I’ll send over A friend request! 
---
My psn is circletrigon
---
😄 this comment makes me want to read it in really funny voices and try and guess what yours sounds like.
---
Yeah completely understand. It was part joke as redditors often forget that people from other countries use Reddit too. 
---
We have a friend who has a small child with a faulty liver (liver replacement soon after birth) and their life has been very tough. Although in Australia we got off lightly compared to a lot of places.
---
Stay Safe, let's hope people start listening to the experts and take precautions.
---
You would have to leave the silo and go look for another one by using the computer in the Enclave Bunker
---
What platform are you on? And which silo? If Xbox I can come run through and bring you a few
---
Shoot down a cargo bot. I think you can get the location for one from the Whitespring bunker but it shouldnt be too hard to find one anyway. Theres often one between Flatwoods and Morgantown and Watoga area is another hotspot for them. I think you have to re run the whole silo again though
---
The same way you got the first one. Shoot down cargo bot.
---
This is pretty good.
---
Ha! “ just to clarify I did not pick them up and transport them to the game and got aluminum “
---
I am on Xbox. Gamer tag: AhZackk
---
I sent you a message ! Psn is Kendrick_lamark
---
And that was not even the argument. You said it was designed for mass killing without purpose. I pointed out that the killing in the game has a purpose. Now your argument is that it doesnt serve its purpose properly. Ha ha. Oh man.
---
You lost the argument bud. Take care now.
---
Site Charlie and the silo code is f-4
---
Hey sorry I forgot about some things so could you do it with me on Saturday or Sunday? I'll pm you
---
Now ur just being a jerk, my voice is normal, except for the occasional voice cracks. Problem is that English isn't my first language and sometimes i even go too much into detail when speaking. When writing i don't go into detail cuz i don't have the time to write all details i am thinking about
---
Silo alpha
---
I never experienced this. Really never, and I have played like 26 Encryptid events
---
Ok got it on my way, this week's code for alpha is 99357501
---
Thank you so much
---
I‘ve even seen one spawn at a fissure site, lol
---
That tree belongs in my camp in Toxic Valley.
---
I'm on the east coast and it would be a pleasure to play with you. Add me: GothicBarbie25 is my PSN
---
No problem :)
---
Friend of mine got one during his first trip to Allegheny. He unfortunately sold it when running out of storage space
---
I could certainly try! I’m fairly available most of the time to hop on.
---
No probably not which is why I’m attempting to get as much of this as possible
---
Sent freind request
---
Hey! I'm on ps4 and i like to text instead of talking...but i assume that you already found your teammates right? XD
---
On the market sub that can’t be linked here for whatever reason, way too much. But I’d say keep it and use it occasionally, it’s dps is super high even without perks
---
I actually feel like 76 has the better graphics.
---
I have always wanted to put deathclaw eggs in the display case since they can’t spoil, and I wanted to make the edition to my deathclaw themed camp that sold the eggs.
---
Will Reddit’s trending post suggestion thing ever learn I am an Xbox user? 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Found you on the map lol you had it right the first time you're at Charlie
---
This week's code for Charlie is 45394000
---
On Xbox 1 s?
---
Which level rn?
---
Ps4 pro
---
Great psn name!
---
Really? I rarely charge mine, so I don't know how that effects it.
---
Big_Duke_78. I am actually on right now
---
Crazy, I've never had this happen with any other gun. It's crazy annoying!!
---
Thank you so much man, I didn’t want to have to all that crap again I really appreciate it
---
Me and my wife are like about to drop today or tomorrow a nuke each, so I'll hit you up on PSN! Shame on Bethesda for not having text!
---
Is that a particularly Aussi thing to do? 
---
 Because I hear a lot of Americans do it too
---
It is do to few reason none of which you can control
---
My 1 star bloodied boxing glove is loads of fun, it does 900 damage per punch! Cheaper to repair than a power fist too!
---
I know the feeling lol I did that once, after that I started carrying at least 2 cards all the time lmao
---
I feel like this whole CAMP budget system is completely useless. Yes, it helps to reduce server lag. But has it got really any other effect?
---
Also you might know already but nukacrypt.com has the silo codes each week
---
Ok cool. It's not letting me send you a pm. Could you try to pm me?
---
That could be why. Also I just have an HD TV no 4k
---
Got mode plus leader bobbleheads can stack infinitly and you get like 4k from crafting any item
---
154
---
No need to skip all of that. I started playing at 8 and my first game was Black Ops 1 and i turned out fine (i think)
---
Their biggest problem is the condition and the sheer amount of enemies that resist energy damage! They have an awesome fire rate though and do great damage against unarmoured enemies.
---
10,002? Looks like he leveled up getting ready for legendary perk cards.
---
Umm... it's not your weapon/armour to hold.
---
Thanks hun 🖤. It's my nickname.
---
Good thing you don't have to buy it than
---
Just sent one!
---
Let me guess your gonna complain when he tanks all the pylons for you and even dps half the imposter to
---
You could just leave the team. 
---
Now if someone is attacking your friend all you can do is watch
---
Heyo, if you’re still adding people up, my PSN is K1ng_0f_Tr0lls (all the “Os” are zeros)
---
I’m a bit off the game right now as I have a lot of stuff to do, but hopefully I’ll be back playing in no time
---
I want to start by saying I’m not on ps4 but I wish you the best of luck finding good people to play with if you ever make the move to pc feel free to give me an add it’s LIlLadyKD
---
It's amazing how being fair &amp; considerate draws you downvotes
---
550... yeah, maybe.
---
See I'm sure the voices i was making up are way worse then whatever you got goin on. Have more self confidence. Ppl think you talk funny? Fuck em! You know 2 languages and they probably barely speak English themselfs.
---
Marksmen Carbine from New Vegas. I’d love an AR15 skin like that for the handmade. I ran around with the RU557 Assault Rifle Mod in Fallout 4 and it was basically a carbon copy of the Marksmen Carbine in NV.
---
(I like for it to become a skin for the handmade though, I’ve got a god roll handmade and I’d hate to try and get that same roll on some new rifle.)
---
I'd die for you, to get the backpack of course. OneBallWanderer would be me, a sniper/heavy gunner.
---
No thats his Native American name
---
Yeah it was much worse at lunch (primarily stability, you would literally crash every 10 min or worse) but I also think that the real issue with the game is that it's just not super well designed as an MMO, which is essentially what it is.  Character development and gear balance and progression are pretty out of whack with some strategies being unequivocally better than all others by miles, with most options being not only ineffectual but often more resource intensive and other strategies being all but strictly non-viable.  There are too many joyless grinds, and no real end game, items are either too common or too rare with like 90% of all new content since launch being in the cash shop, currency cap makes trade of the few actually valuable items a mess, scrip cap makes the main focus of the game for developed characters (legendary farming) feel like wasting resources, the constant duping and rampant cheating issues... I could probably go on, but you get the picture.    
---
I say all of this as a fan of the game, because even though it's clearly just fallout 4.5 with a poorly planned pseudo mmo multiplayer mode haphazardly cobbled on top of it, the setting is very nice, and the world building, as is typical of all Bethesda games, outshines the mediocre game systems and the rote blandness of the questline storytelling.  
---
I do think they are slowly improving, but from a strictly systems wise perspective this game still has a long way to go toward being actually good, but I don't think you really see and realize all this till you've had a very fun time running around the very cool map.        
---
I think personally as a person who plays bethedsa games pretty much only for romping exploration and just enjoying getting lost in a fantastical world, it's a home run (once all horrible horrible early days connectivity issues were resolved) and I could have happily played it just like another fallout game and been done with it after a few months.  They keep me coming back with the multiplayer aspects... but it just kinda ends up being sort of empty feeling gameplay because of the lack of content for established players (you can only kill so many mole miners before the novelty wears off), but that's really probably my issue for not just moving on heh.
---
It's put there mostly for the server side of things.  If it was a single player game than there really wouldn't be requirement.
---
But it uses the same  engine as fl4. add 8 people to a sever and no cap your sever will have issues with lag, and conectivity, regardless of what kind of conection your running that box off of.
---
 Same reason why we have a cache limit.
---
They could cut it in half by moving the cache to the (player's machine)  But I would still out to verify with the server. Which would lead to the same problems.
---
Girl, yes. Hit me up. I'm totally happy to play and just run around the wasteland emoting whenevs and chatting through text the rest of the time! 
---
Same name on PS4 as here; And I always like making more girl gamer friends! A lot of guys treat me differently once they realize I'm an actual girl (and it's not just my avatar/character just *looking* like a girl).
---
Hey cass, I know finding other deaf players is probably a rarity but I have a friend who is also deaf and I'd be more than happy to connect you guys if you're interested? Unfortunately he mostly just plays ESO but figured I'd offer anyways!
---
That’s what I’m thinking but we won’t know until patch 20
---
VATS Gauss Shotgun build is by far the most fun I’ve had on this game, melts everything including SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
Ok cool thanks
---
Yes thanks. Yeah I prefer to listen to doctors instead of politicans when it comes to my Healthcare decisions and alot of people around here don't. Although I am glad to hear that you are not dealing with that in Australia! Good luck!
---
It is possible they've been using a glitch to increase the budget. 
---
Doing so can cause problems with vending machines and displays though or it may have been fixed now.
---
The game struggles to load my camp as it is. If i had no budget.. well... WELLLLL
---
I remember when ps linked facebook pics with profile pics, oh lord... that was a flippin mess lol
---
I waited an hour and a half, no respawn happened, I had to close the game down!
---
VATS hit chance is amazing on the shotty, it’s much more consistent with that than my other ones.
---
They were.... when this happened to me they thanked me for my report and offered nothing to ease my pain! Lol
---
Am still doing it, no luck yet.
---
That is an incredibly generous offer! I have no problem with you passing on my psn if he wants a like minded person, :))
---
Mistaken identity can only be done once since it is not actually a daily mission.  You need to start a new character to get it.
---
Play Time always seemed bugged to me tbh.
---
I was playing today and went into some guys camp to look at the three vendors he had set up. And he attacked me with his deathclaw. So I moved away to a different vendor and he attacked me again. 
---
I was like, cool, I won't spend any money at you vendor then and left. Ridiculous. 
---
If want to PvP then attack me once but if I choose to not fight you then don't attack me again.
---
Not a legit item.
---
Thanks this was very helpful
---
But why is it then reported that higher level players get a higher budget?
---
I guess the CAMP budget and especially the storage is a big problem in Fo76. The game would have felt much better by being able to keep anything from the start.
---
This is one of the bests events and somehow it's always empty
---
Aussie truck drivers are fairly well known for doing it esp the long haul ones. Doesn't waste tissues, less mess etc haha
---
Well, they don’t call him the vengeful mothman for nothing. 
---
Seriously though, I have no idea why this may be happening.
---
Unless they changed it, lower levels did more damage to higher levels and higher levels did less damage to lower levels. I think it was a 25 level gap it happened? It was there around when the game first came out but I don't know if they changed it or not. Not to mention damage towards players is capped, not sure what the cap is, I think like 125?
---
Same. I'm low level and suck still though so I just try to avoid the game completely that way I don't stay up until the sunrise playing it.
---
Just pay it foward, help noobs when u are a higher level.  Welcome to the universe and community
---
He has been popping up a lot for me the last couple weeks.
---
lol right? I was just thinking about that the other day!
---
Some people will trade b2525 fixers and be gat plasmas for it
---
3 or 4.. don't remember exactly
---
The killing in any other FPS game has purpose though lmao. If you're going to be that pedantic. Wtf are you even trying to argue.
---
It drops from a random event outside Charleston station. Warp there, run to the red tracks and turn around back to the barn across the station. That will spawn a random encounter with a chance of spawning the responder vendor bot. THEN there is only a chance it has the hunter longcoat, but might have some rare outfits like clean space suit and fisherman overalls.
---
So layers of RNG to get the right outfit. Personally, I paid for it at a player camp vendor, like 5k caps. So much easier lol. Good hunting
---
I have to agree, perhaps if enough people agree, we can get Bethesda to consider it. :D
---
Damn..F in the chat
---
Yeah I've had problems with that one but got that one to work usually by quitting it and reactivating it in the pip boy , can't for these tho cuz they are greyed out and never active.
---
Same..
---
I would agree with that only a small group will finish for free but they said after the first 2 weeks people can start buying levels with atoms and there plenty of people out there that will just pay to get everything
---
That's right.
---
100% agree, I was a little older when I played 3 but once I did I was hooked, I pre-ordered new Vegas as soon as it dropped(first pre-order), I had the local Video Ezy order it in to my tiny little country town and even somehow payed less than at EB or any of the chain stores, which was great for my minimum wage paycheck. I still remember that day I was so friggin happy leaving the store holding MY first game, I swear the game glowed when it first touched my hands.
---
Oh god yes, how did i forget displays lol
---
Good griefing
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you some candy. If you're still in need?
---
Forgot to add:
---
*Results may vary
---
It's about item management. Certain things use more budget. Defenses use a ton. Eliminate them. Lights and conduents use a lot. Minimize them. Etc.
---
He knows how many Cultists you've killed. You steal from his mine, interrupt his children's praise of him, take shots at him when pops in to talk...why wouldn't he be pissed?
---
Pass the Buck sometimes pops up for me if I go to the Grafton Steel Yard or Pioneer Scouts Camp.
---
At least my squad had fun shooting my corpse around.
---
On ps4, she literally just showed up at my at the creek west of arkos pharmaceutical
---
Farm mirelurk eggs and pumpkins and make pies.
---
So it cannot spawn with Legendary effects? Then how are they being sold on Ebay. Are they hacked items?
---
Nah I’m on Xbox :(
---
Can we also talk about the sights on the bow being completely useless? They don't line up/you don't even sight through them
---
This^
---
If you’re going Bloodied, I highly recommend shooting for a full Unyielding set. The benefits outshine every other armor set for this build, and you can still attain high damage/energy resistances without going Bolstering.
---
I keep the CSS as a backup for nuke zones.
---
Great legendary drop by the way. Have fun!
---
FIX THE GOD DAMN FAST TRAVEL BUG
---
I highly recommend downloading the app to your phone or such. Aside from being able to type faster, I think a big difference is that you can still view and send messages without having to leave your current screen. If you're in need of options to increase carry weight, I could try helping you get the Excavator power armor set if you don't have that already.
---
Dang. I'm sorry hun.
---
I mean like pro
---
Oh great, guess I’m quitting again if this happens.
---
On another note, if ballistic weapons can get the explosive effect, energy weapons should have super charged.
---
Plasma was fine in every game before 76, being on the high end of damage. Lasers were fine up to 4, where they didn’t do crap for damage.
---
From a computer hardware point of veiw giving players a unlimited cap is a problem.
---
There is only so much the severs can handle before they become unstable.
---
Even if they spent several trillion dollors on sever hardwear it would be a issue.
---
Secound reason the  engine that the game is running  was deisgned for fl4/skrym which was a single player game. These games where not designed for muliplayer. The egine was slightly modified to run the game in a multiplayer state.
---
 They can't just upgrade the engine,  For it would require rebuilding the whole game from scratch which they do not have the funds to do, and no one would have the patience to wait for them to do it.
---
I just got one like 30 minutes ago on I think the road is 86B south east of flat woods under the New river gorge bridge. There was a responders vender bot, two eyebot guards and a pack brahmen. He was selling the hunter long coat
---
Oh shit, its actually a visor? All this time I thought it was some kind of round awkward armor plate. With visor down it would look super badass.
---
Thanks buddy! I'm going to have to look into that!
---
I space out my game time like one day doom eternal next day gta v then f76
---
Thanks man, but I was talking about it spawning with Legendary effects.
---
You must have just started the rep slog
---
It is one of the most tediously annoying things I have ever done in a videogame ever 
---
Those last couple bars take for freaking ever to fill up

Nah. Aussie truck drivers are too smart for that. That's what the highway rest stop bathrooms and restraurant napkins are for.
---
Gotta say, I have mowed down quite a few cultists and looted from the lucky strike pretty often 
---
Makes perfect sense to me! Thank you!
---
Yes, they’re hacked. It’s intended to be purely cosmetic.
---
Or duped from some one getting it from the dev room. Ither way banable
---
Hey there! Thanks for the great question, I have recently found out, from all the wonderful people on this comment section, that there is a talk to text feature on the second screen app, but unfortunately my slow ass internet is way to slow to support both while playing. Thankfully, they have the messaging app, that makes communication way easier for us muties lol
---
i dunno man, I don't use fast travel too much so is fun, I just take the mission and go place to place till the quest.
---
Why doesn't this have 5k upvotes?
---
Awesome, thanks for sharing :)
---
Thanks, wished they didn’t take away my Unyielding Radicals Mask.
---
no
---
So that's like 5 photos, right? I was expecting to see a whole bunch of photos for all of the score rewards.
---
So, that's it?
---
You don't even fast travel to do the missions? 
---
I honestly don't think you'll ever make it to full rep...which is sadly only slightly a joke. 
---
Ha!
---
I love your ideas! I agree that the scouts should get more love. Their questline is one of those rare ones in Bethesda games where the characters seem unaware that the world around them has fallen into chaos and all hope is pretty much lost, yet they soldier on with all of that adorable pep. Foundation is okay but characters come off as annoying/neckbeard sometimes. The blatantly obvious innocence is the stuff that gets me!
---
Ideally you'll want something like this:
---
1st star: 
---
- Full unyielding 
---
- (swap one for life saving if you care about dying)
---
2nd star: 
---
- 2 agility
---
- 3 AP refresh
---
- (can do less AP if you use Action Boy - more Agi if you don't want to max stealth perks - swap one limb for poison resist if you want since poison will one-hit you)
---
3rd star: 
---
- 1 harder to detect (this caps at one piece)
---
- The rest cav or sent
---
Full shadowed leather if you just want to be as sneaky as possible and care less about DR. 
---
2 shadowed heavy leather, 2 ultra-light heavy metal and ultra-light heavy combat chest, if you want the best balanced protection (afaik shadowed only works on leather, so take the extra AP from ultra-light for the other pieces)
---
(Just going full uny is enough to make this build work well with the stealth perks, but if you want to know what to look for these effects do make a big difference)
---
yes i made it up because they are telling me to use punctuation and im fucking sick of people saying that and i dont want to say something more cursed
---
lol no mate I dont, I just use fast travel to my camp when I'm full and back to where I was, I mean I'm playing 2 week's now I guess and already finished the main mission and I'm lvl 44, just need to finish the side ones
---
btw: to anyone that gonna do the silo charle alone as melee and are not lvl 50 with good gear a little advice: DON'T, is a pain in the ass, you can do it is double, but will drain your resources as hell, those assaultron are powerful
---
Thank you for this! I'm definitely going for the T-65 now. Before this I was saving for the Strangler.
---
Weird it's labeled as "Daily: Mistaken Identity" in the dailies tab
---
I'll do 30 minutes here and there. I only started looking at the beginning of last month. At first i wanted it to trade but now i'm like 'NO! I'M GONNA WEAR IT FOREVER!' 
---
when i find one of course. I could buy one but.. no.
---
Go Junkies.
---
With five addictions, you deal +50% damage with a Junkies weapon. You won’t deal nearly as much damage as Bloodied, but you also don’t need to be at low-health to maximize the damage increase.
---
Couple that with a full Vanguard set or, better yet, Cavalier, and you’ll get your fast-paced gameplay without being too squishy.
---
Screw screws, the gears is what you need from the fans
---
Or when your placing an object and it's green but you can't place it because it needs support. Damnit don't make it green then!
---
The Gauss Shotgun is a big disappointment especially since I cant seem to get a good drop when I am crafting them.   I built 10 in one shot and got a bunch of crap I had to sell back.
---
Oh don't get me wrong. I actually don't fast travel too much but man, those side mission fetch quests would just take forever without it
---
Believe me, after you have done the same 3 rep quests 65 times, you are going to start to hate it
---
God damn!!! Well I really hope you feel  better soon, fuck those infections
---
No, this is just the new pictures added. I posted the bulk of the SCORE stuff a few weeks ago when the PTS began.
---
X277 Viper rail cannon (FO3). Lore says it is gone from the Museum of Technology by 2277 with no known current location, so why not move it to Appalachia?
---
Don’t know how many time this happened to me a lvl 6, a lvl 24 even a lvl 114 all did that. I invited them to party and asked them wtf and they all were like “but it told me to”🤦‍♂️.....thanks for wasting my card homie!!!!
---
Who's "they"?
---
Considering their next 2 games are planning on launching star field and skyrim 6 are all using the same engine I would say..  Probably not for a while.
---
They are still convinced that they can make money using an engine that they developed in the past.  Until that notion changes with management I don't see that ever changing.
---
Edit:  At this point I'm hopping that the next fall out, If they Haven't sold the license. Uses a more modern engine.
---
ouch, 65 times now you have my respect and attention, Jesus is a little to much no?
---
It was probably just coded incorrectly. The devs probably intended the players to do the 3 Camden Park daily events, but inadvertently used Mistaken Identity (which just has you do those 3  events).
---
Bethesda.
---
I'll go one step further, I think the over all number of nukes being dropped are down.  I noticed it during Fashnact and it hasn't gotten any better.   I used to be able to hit Whitespring once a day plus a couple of SBQs, I haven't hit WS in a week (last one was my own nuke).  Sucks because I need flux.  As to why?   I think the number of nocturnal 1* pipes or pool cues I've gotten from SBQ drops speaks volumes to the what people are also experiencing, all that work and for what?
---
I thought I had an extra but I can’t find it on any of my mules.
---
65 was just a random number that I pulled out of my ass to represent half way 
---
It's probably not far off though 
---
I have been playing pretty regularly everyday since Wastelanders dropped at least to do the rep grind stuff and I just got the Raiders finished last night. And they are the ones with more options to actually get the rep. 
---
It's way too much. 
---
But I wanted that ammo crafter so it's what you do
---
Copy paste it with elder scroll online and skyrim
---
So after looking at the suggestions, my plan is to slowly alter some of the build. It'll take probably 20 more levels to switch points and get new perk cards, but it should provide way more tankiness, and a bunch more damage.
---

---
Squirrel scouts not beaver
---
I'm not even going to come up with a reply for such a stupid comment lol
---
So is the fix for the red rocket garage door coming this patch or nay
---
Running fo76 on pc from its own launcher is shocking, running it off Nvidas launcher, big difference.
---
It's just how they have set it sadly.
---
I just droped my first bomb an was awesome, but 4 hours doing the silo was tiring(only the silo not gather keys/fragments), I think  I will be good doing once in a while the rep thing not all days as I have a good chance of forgetting those, but thanks for the explanation
---
Try playing Skyrim instead. Unlimited replayability especially with mods
---
When does patch 20 drop? Are they doing the seasons thing? (Heard someone describe it like a battle pass.)
---
Ohh.
---
I didn't know they took away items. I always assumed they had no way of altering people's inventory/stash, which is why there's so many duped/hacked items in the game.
---
I remember first starting back in August, I'd be gone in a flash If I saw someone else.
---
First time I got a bounty (opening a dropbox, the contents wasn't red but I didn't notice it said 'steal' rather than 'take') I hid for hours trying to avoid being killed until I finally worked out bounties don't just disappear after X time, only after someone kills you. Took the plasma, got gooified, haven't really worried about players since.
---
Everyone just really does their own thing, events are great and sometimes you get some great teamwork from randoms in the most unlikely of places.
---
Just as a headsup though - Workstations are PVP (but it prompts you before claiming a workstation) so is the event Monster Mash at Watoga (which it doesn't really explain nor give a prompt to say it's PVP)
---
Happy Trails.
---
I picked that one! It fit my evil character nicely, I can make you one tomorrow if you want. I'd appreciate the one that you picked though :)
---
I agree. Naive enthusiasm despite the dire circumstances is part that trade mark Fallout charm for me.
---
Which one is better and can I do that with my Xbox settings some how?
---
My 9 year old asked me today if he can play finally. He’s been watching me play for the last four years and apparently I had told him “when you’re 10!” He’s been watching long enough and playing other shooter games that I figure he can probably play now, I don’t expect him to play the story line AT ALL lol but just shoot everything he comes across.
---
Wait which items can be displayed that have a spoil meter but won’t spoil???
---
Yep, I was a dumbass and only did settlers :(
---
You know how the assaultron helmet opens when you put your weapon away and closes when you draw your weapon? That function for the SS Helmet would be cool.
---
The plastic pumpkin on the porch at the Pumpkin House usually is full of candy.
---
...which was greatly appreciated!
---
Dude my roomie and i watch his daughter play COD warzone
---
She's 10 lol
---
Its fine omg
---
Theres worse words in rap music that most parents listen to 🤣🤣🤣
---
More the Merrier :)) it's always nice meeting new wastelanders
---
It seems like there were a lot of people who did the same thing because they didn't know. I mostly want the stealth suit and weapon plans lol
---
Happy cake day!!! A new buddy for your birthday lol
---
I call hacks lol, his health isn't even at 20% to one shot the SBQ.
---
Definitely XP exploit to get to that insane level.
---
I reckon I could 3 shot the SBQ but that's only with melee 🤔
---
If they add more, the challenges need to have zero (and I mean zero) rng based components. The unstoppables magazine part of collector sucks, and for a long time, plasma grenades plans were nigh impossible to find.
---
Yea I have my settlers rep high af Rn and my raiders is low, I hate the grind sooooo much
---
&gt;A guy did a bunch of tests and against a level 95 behemoth is was hitting 3 less dmg per hit on the t65 vs the ultracite/t51b.
---
3  less damage per hit adds up when you are being hit from all sides by a multitude of enemies.  It makes a big difference.
---
His tests showed him standing in front of one enemy who was slowly chipping away at his health.  That isn't how real combat situations work.
---
Events like Encrypted and project paradise don't have  one behemoth with a club very slowly taking swings at you.  You are getting pummeled from all sides by a multitude of enemies.
---
Do you need some flux? I got some.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
It seems ridiculous that I've only just moved my settler rep from "cautious" to "neutral". It feels like I've been working for them for an eternity
---
Does it decent??! Boy I tell you what!
---
I had a level 10 chameleon metal armor piece I used since LAUNCH.
---
The games not the same after they took survival and camp destruction out hopefully they add a pvp mode
---
Yeah, they just want to keep players in the game, if the rep rate was increased then everybody would leave
---
Scrip it
---
It may not even be a player killing it, Sometimes every NPC in an area just dies at the same time, it’s really weird. Nothing more creepy than browsing stuff in the Whitesprings bunker and then all of a sudden every robot falls over dead.
---
Keep and scrip them or toss them away
---
Yes I’ll make one for you now. My gamer tag is brozoge
---
Would very much like to have a Tesla Cannon.
---
I’ve maxed my scrip today, but I was going to. I feel like I am only getting stuff opposite to my current build. I feel like the game wants me to re-build my entire character
---
That would be awesome! I cant remember what kind of armor I have atm, but it probably needs leveling up haha
---
Hey thanks buddy, you to
---
Nothing more painful than getting a damn shovel or rolling pin or switchblade or some other goofy ass weapon from the purveyor or a 3* legendary.
---
If they ever fix that I’ll be pissed
---
You'll have to check through your Xbox video settings, not the game itself.
---
Do you use a Handmade or .50 Cal ? One bundle has a gold skin for one, the other has a gold skin for the other.
---
But my MF DOOM cosplay...
---
Lvl 10 -20% armor weight 
---
If I use anything else I am severely overencombered
---
Who on Xbox wants to grind score?
---
I don't agree with zero RNG but I would like better odds. I agree some of that stuff was pretty painful. I still don't have Robotocist because the Robot Armor plans drop.
---
Brain Implants..
---
being able to raise 3 stats by 1 point each would really open up some build possibilities for people
---
Definitely gonna have to go with the .50 cal since I Allready have a good handmade skin. Thanks
---
Metro exodus is pretty awesome too. Just a little more story driven than anything else
---
I've given up on Bethesda, they won't listen to the community on anything and that makes the game suffer
---
Bethesda's engine is constantly evolving. 
---
Personally I've always been fond of it, and with each iteration they expand on it's features. 
---
76 being a leap forward in a few aspects, like the addition of multi-player, phasing tech for story telling, lighting overhauls, and view distance enhancements. I would prefer they stick with it, clean up the bugs to make it the best it can be.
---
To be honest, I miss entering a building and knowing I am the only on who has been in there in a long time. Now, it’s almost a guarantee that someone has been there taken everything and the loot won’t respawn anytime soon.
---
They could just make all interior spaces unique to that player/team and the problem would be fixed for me.
---
I feel you. 
---
I've played a lot of fallout in the last 3 years and one can get burned out on it. So, I've put Mass Effect back on my box and have slowly been transitioning back to that for a while. I check the atom shop every Tuesday and keep up with news. And I'll hop on to help folk, but my heart isn't in it like it used to be.
---
I'm sure I'll roll back around with the BOS material later this year.
---
*Ad Victorium!*
---
thanks, those armor are all with no mods right?
---
When I first started I had a player drop me a hundred stimpacks. I couldn’t have been higher that 5. Those got me through a lot of difficult times. The kindness other players show is amazing sometimes.
---
Their engine gets improved upon with every new game they make. A new Bethesda engine with all new Bethesda bugs would kill the company.
---
It's the depression in the ground between the shed where the workshop activation bench is, and the house with the power armor station out front.
---
I would love to see a quest wear we physically see the transformation from human to super mutant with a syringer mod. Be great to make FEV ammo too.
---
My camp is right down the hill from the vault so if a low level finds their way to my camp, I try to drop some supplies to get them trough the early levels. I pay it forward and its weird when it’s done to me lol
---
Will take a look there. Also need some royal jelly for BlackBerry Honey Crisp
---
Heck, I'd just be happy to put my flaming chainsaw on a heavy weapons display rack.
---
happened to me like a month ago, I wouldn't have filed a report but it was tuesday so the weekly was screwed too. They awarded me the lost atoms.
---
It's ether your console's lack of 4k or your mods on skyrim and fallout 4 because the graphics look good on an Xbox One X
---
I don't know what platform you're on but I've noticed that the stash box at the overseers camp by the wayward is always overflowing with endgame stuff. High levels are dumping it there and the brand new players don't have any idea what to do with it. I have taken out a few times and left it at like a train station in a suitcase or something. Just so they aren't confused when they start the game.
---
yeah ghost in the shell!
---
i thought what I'd do was...
---
Less than that, believe I've seen 0.01%as the drop rate.  I've done about 200 SBQ fights and haven't gotten it.
---
Yeah I believe those are the base stats.
---
That might just be a bug and not one specific to that event. I’ve had it happen to me, very rarely though.
---
Great! Fo76 is my favourite game so I'm online 24/7 so feel free to join me whenever you want! My psn is highpika228 add me when you can..and btw don't judge i was 12 when made the gamer tag..XD
---
Same
---
oh nice, now I need to find the heavy metal plans then, thanks for sharing man
---
I have bought clipboards out of sheer compulsion because of this game series.
---
Got all three at Foundation from a traveling merchant who appeared behind me in Ward's trailer.  What are the clean space suit and fisherman's overalls worth?
---
I’ve been playing about a month and the people on 76 are the most generous people I’ve ever met on a open world game.
---
I’ll never forgive Bethesda for removing the effect from the radical masks...
---
Remove something useful I painstakingly grinded for because people were using it over your atomic shop shite? I’m never buying atoms ever again. Go to hell Bethesda.
---
The deep is the place to go for straight creeper!
---
And around Slocum joes area.
---
What if you keep your vendors full so it has no open slots?
---
Mothman and the Flatwoods Monster appear at my camp frequently.Between West Tech and the cabins to the SW.
---
I could try and make a set for both you and bex! I can gather the materials to make the set pretty easily but the only issue I have is getting Violet Flux to make the calibrated shocks(+50 carry weight) for each leg. Add those two on and a motion-assist(I think) to the chest and you have a PA set that gives you 210 carry weight(as well as double the ore when mining)!
---
If you'd like to add me, my psn is steinxfrank
---
I experienced some of that on my way up for past few weeks, but recently i was legit surprised, when lower lvl, around 60 dropped me some stuff, im lvl 100-ish.  I didnt know how to react to that, so i quickly went to my stashbox, and looked for something he could use xD its weird sometimes, but its good weird.
---
Just go to The Deep. There 13 or so there.
---
My son is 11 and plays 76 with me. It’s a game, it’s not a big deal.
---
Encryptid!!!  Stop murdering the pun you fools!
---
It can happen on any event. It's been around for quite awhile.
---
Got them from my dailies but Smiley wouldn't sell.
---
Far Harbor’s THE STRIKER, the modified Fat Man that shot bowling balls https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Striker
---
Oh ok
---
Well mistaken identity, it’s one of those quests that can only be completed the first time you go to a location....the very first time you go to Camden Park
---
They would just need to buy something so it doesn't really!
---
Sorry hold up
---
Ok cool, thanks dude.
---
If you're looking for the shocks I can install them for you, if your in Xbox that is
---
Around 75k. This is a god roll weapon. I suggest to try out the market in my post history if you wanna try to sell it. But I recommend using it instead.
---
How do you know this the one i saw was wearing a fedora and dead, no robot parts at all..
---
[https://imgur.com/a/FhHAQAj](https://imgur.com/a/FhHAQAj)
---
How is it that hard to load up what you need on your person before selling such items? What about in situations where a vendor isn't near a stash e.g. Grahm?
---
Really? Are you sure you don't need it?
---
I came across one this afternoon where I got catapulted from the savage divide well into the Cranberry Bog. Thank god for goat legs and an SS Jet Pack.
---
There are explosive legendary bows though, check the trading sub
---
Holy :O that is... wow, I hate being "overweight" and have to drop or sell shit. So that sounds awesome! Look out for cutthroat_cass  :))
---
You: "The concern trolls have arrived!"
---
Also you: "We skip dialogue"
---
You monster...
---
Seriously though, so long as your son isn't causing trouble by making people feel bad when he gets rekt by a griefer, all is good.
---
Then again, it looks like you're the one that'll have to be putting up with the griefers crying to you about how your son rekt them.
---
I’d like quests that tell me to photograph specific players. That’d be interesting.
---
I agree with everything you said. They are clearly still learning the ropes of an mmo and hopefully they continue supporting the game.
---
You gotta earn all the badges before the repeatable challenges will drop badges as a reward, a 25% drop rate.
---
Yup. I am on for a few more minutes. PSN ikki_makko
---
The carnival top left of map with ferris wheel
---
If you still need advice: taking the Sunshine farm workshop by flatwoods and setting up the machine to make sugar bombs is an easy way to get all 20. Since sugar bombs count for the challenge
---
I don’t particularly have a problem with the engine per se.  sure there’s buggy shit and it seems 76 is poorly optimized.  The issue is how Bethesda treats bugs (and to an extent how they are managed) and since theres no sign of a change on that, all a new engine would do is exemplify how the engine wasn’t the problem.
---
I feel so much better than I did my dr kept brushing it off as heart burn / indigestion so I’ve had this pain for months, they are on about me going back for surgery in about 3 months to have it removed which I’m so nervous about, I never had a problem with blood tests or Injections and now after my hospital experience I get so anxious when they try to push fluid in your canular that is in your arm but has come out of your vein inside, omg that hurts I had bruised all over my hands, stomach and all over my arms my friends were horrified when I showed them, plus I had a whole bag of fluid (1000mil) go into my arm and not my vein then all night the fluid came back out it was so weird I kept saying it didn’t feel right but they said it’s normal cause I got small veins so I grit my teeth as long as I could then I turned the machine off cause my arm looked like popeye lol
---
Yea I was wearing my leather coat and one of the raiders say "hey 76 looking good , who I gotta kill you get an outfit like that" ...made my day
---
You know what, ur right, I guess i gotta open up a lil but more
---
Well then you go to switch to a regular world.. And your camp is now implacable
---
That would be cool! The story of super mutants hasnt really been shown since fallout 1 or 2. It would be nice to develope it a bit more for people who never played those games and give a better visual representation than a few logs we can read
---
There's a ton of stuff on the computers in one of the observatories too; it almost sets up an alien invasion angle.
---
Thank you so much for this tip! It helped me!
---
That's when you start playing Oblivion again for the first time in years!
---
-t. me
---
I'd rather not have another tie-in to the STASH box. In fact, I wish they *remove* all connections to it completely and isolate STASH, vendor and display cases.
---
I had that problem for a week. Each day once or twice he’d show up. Then he just stopped. Those where the only times I’ve seen one in the wild. I also just saw my first flatwoods monster after 600 hours. I think I have terrible luck in this game.
---
No, two choices: either you can't log into a public server with the character with the camp over budget (so you'd have camp build characters as second characters that stay on private) or you tag new characters as private only to get the bonus.
---
I just spent 600 gold bullion in the Deep Pocket mod plans for the secret service armor.  Only, it only let’s you equip that mod to the chest piece.  600 gold bullion for +10 total carry weight (even less given it increases the weight of the armor.). Argh!  Why?  Why not all armor pieces?!?!?  Ok.  My rant is over.  Deep breathes...
---
Yeah i've found all sorts of details aiming at Aliens, early game they talk about Aliens in the first town near wayward.
---
I just have the regular Xbone, but imo the lighting is way better in FO76. Is there something specific you mean graphically? Like I know textures...sometimes do not load whatsoever for me. I just chalk it up to being that same engine trying to chug through an online game.
---
Or I will be on tomorrow after 330p EST
---
I both love and loathe The Sims 4.
---
^^&gt;we ^^finally ^^added ^^Half ^^Walls!
---
^^Awesome, ^^except ^^they ^^act ^^like ^^full ^^walls!
---
I know there are extra places, but the only ones i know of are Middle Mountain cabbins and Tanagra town. Plus the Faschnat collectron can find it if you or a friend has it.
---
Not so hard, really, it’s just one extra step. Often I’m selling extra chems and by the time I get to the vendor I’ve forgotten how many I wanted to keep LOL
---
And yeah, that’s why I suggested just the vendors close to a stash, so it wouldn’t break the logic of the game
---
What’s recipe or whatever is Starlight Creeper used for? What’re the benefits? Sorry, only been playing for a month or two and still trying to learn the little things.
---
That's...man...I feel your pain.
---
I think you're viewing past games with rose tinted glasses. 76 is pretty dark at times. Stuff like
---
* Colonel's story arc
---
* The dude in the fridge pleading for his life
---
* Lady stuck in the Morgantown Airport storage closet
---
* The situation at the settler's farm with Daniel
---
I'm sure that there's a bunch I've missed. The other entries in their own way have perhaps been more violent but not, at least for me, not as disturbing as this one.
---
76 was the first one that stopped me in my tracks and gave a real sense of the bleakness of living without hope (or not living with it) post apocalypse.
---

they prefer dumpster tyvm
---
But wouldnt that mean you dont earn the score
---
I do think that the fo1st is a bit expensive for what you get, but I don't necessarily mind if the game itself is working properly. I ended up canceling my sub just a few days ago because I can't be bothered with the bugs anymore. I love the game, but holy smokes man, I can't even do dailies without getting stuck inside the Overseer's home or crater (my character literally locks up and I can't move) or some fast travel bug, etc. Combined with new content being delayed, I just....I'll be back in a few months to see if it's any better I guess

Hey, I don't know if you've tried this but theres an app called PS4 Second Screen that connects to your PS4 and gives you features such as a keyboard, speech-to-text, and it allows you to use your tablet/smartphone as a secondary controller so you can browse the menus or turn on your ps4 without ever needing a controller. I live with a roommate that's deaf, and after looking over the text to speech to see how well it worked I can tell you that its nearly perfect. The only catch is it only takes data from PS4 parties, not from video game area chats (as far as I know).
---
Bhahaha...his Native American name.  What a stitch up mate.
---
How come, risk of glitch/theft?
---
That makes it exciting and fun for the guys trying to get it for their strangler heart power armor.
---
Good on you u/Lord_Zane66. Coming to the rescue! That is awesome...
---
Thanks bud :)) a few people have suggested it and I am now downloading it! Haha excited to give it a try
---
Oh yes he is extremely vengeful, doesn’t make me love the game any less of course but I’m no fan of wasting my ammo or my stimpaks needlessly
---
So let me get this straight. 
---
You want Bethesda to spend coding man hours, a company already in the weeds with keeping up with game content and fixes, and has a terrible record of reliably implementing even the most basic features, to create code for a situational circumstance (i.e. doesn't always apply to all vendors) just because you can't be bothered with one step...?
---
Do you not see the problem here?
---
Yeah I hope at least some of that is fixed in update 20.
---
Started playing recently on PC; I have a solo character and one for playing with a friend from work. On both characters I've experienced so much kindness from randos in the wild. One guy kitted out our camps, another lady helped power level me through some quests. Many other have given stims, food, loot... or just fun with music. This really is such a nice community. Its been nice seeing similar experiences
---
I'm sorry. I was going off what seemed logical. I'll have to defer to your expertise on this matter.
---
Appreciate the offer. I was more wondering how hard the plans would be to get if I was going to get the strangler heart.
---
This community is so amazing. I couldn’t believe it when I started playing. I do my best to perpetuate the help I’ve received. The high level players really care for the low levels and it helps retain those new guys. 
---
I’ve had one mildly toxic encounter the whole time and I just travelled to his base, dropped a bag of spoiled meat and laughed as he frantically melee’d me. Moved on with my day and haven’t found another toxic person in the wasteland
---
Hold on for a bit it gets better. Once you get some perks and items the only things you'll have a hard time dealing with are bugs and the clunky interface but the game itself will be a breeze. And this game's community is VERY friendly to newcomers so don't be shy if you need help ! Misery loves company
---
I think FO76's graphics look pretty good, really good at times. Of course not 16 times the detail, but undoubtedly better than FO4 and Skyrim.
---
Lol, my first character is always overweight and has essentially become a mule. For a while, it was so bad that I just stopped dropping stuff because I was that far over the limit. If you'd like the shock-absorbers for that extra 100 carry weight, we could always get a group to do some scorchqueen runs. I'm sure plenty of people would be interested in the loot for sure haha
---
Then don’t use it? It’s not like Todd is there holding a gun to your head every time you log on you know.
---
Yeah... that's never happening with an online game...
---
You're kidding re. nocs right? I started using them out of curiosity after I got a noc exploding handmade, and it's so powerful during nightime &amp; the wee hours.
---
I really like the Tesla rifle but I have a heavy weapons build.
---
Every single time a duplication glitch or STASH theft bug shows up, and the "CAMP cannot be placed" bug that can cause display items to be scrapped if you stay on the world, it always comes down to them being linked back into the STASH box one way or another.
---
It just doesn't look right. FO4 and Skyrim look bright and crisp and clear and distance items are sharp. FO76 look like a PS2 game in the background, tree leaves look like blobs. The trees are grown in in 76 so there's more quantity of something that doesn't look good
---
Trying to PvP tbh
---
Apparently there been some talk of the instance interior camps that are suppose to be comeing having a larger budget.... For fo1st members
---
My idea of the build is a little different here’s mine https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f347b88&amp;d=s01sq2s22s32sr2pe2eh2cr0cu0s12ip2a72a00l71lt2lu2ib1a12c72eu0ir2sb0a30ce0&amp;w=sx1p00cm0sg0e10e40e60ek0em0ee2c52if2ih2ep0s81c62&amp;m=051c29fe8&amp;n=PA%20Heavy%20Guns
---
Awesome! And hey if you ever wanna hang out, my PSN is WolfrumGaming. I also am part of a community called Dr. CJs Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare that consist of super friendly people who've been playing the game since beta and can help you out if needed. :)
---
And yet, when it displays on screen to activate the pylon to become a conduit, they instead just run around shooting at an invisible sheepsquatch imposter.
---
and i bet you still wonder why you got/get bullied at school eh?
---
I love low level players at public events not overextending and playing more of a support role. The cow herding is one great example. Another is clearing away the trash mobs and reviving downed players for the SBQ fight so that the heavy hitters can focus on the queen.
---
Yea I have a few times people were generous to me not with legendary items unfortunately but knowledge....in my lower levels I loved workshops because I loved buildings and in most games I can hold more than my own in PvP ....players were more than kind enough to show me how stealth boys plus legacy weapons work over and over ....also since I enjoy building so much I spend ample time at my camp and yet again players drop in to share with me that even though I am in pacifist mode in my camp there are specific items that can still blow everything up...Generosity on PC is strong lmao
---
I’m only level 28, but man I’m already so impressed with the community of this game. I had a couple people help me and show extreme generosity in the beginning, and since then I’ve had the “Giving Bug” myself. I don’t have much.. But every session I have I will go seek out at least one low level player or someone coming out of the vault and greet them with full freshly crafted boiled leather pocketed armor, fully tricked out pipe rifle, ammo, stims etc. Anyway, I can’t do much for anyone yet, but I’ve just been happy to try and pay it forward.
---
Thanks buddy :)) you'll see a request soon!
---
What kind of absurd ass idea is that 😂 pay a membership fee to be forced to play an online game alone just so I can build a mansion? What they SHOULD do is fix the weight of items and give us much more storage space so I don't need 7 characters just to balance out my playing
---
Sometimes I’ll check the map and if there are people coming out of the Vault or around Flatwoods I’ll go and drop them some Stims and water.
---
But that hurts lol. I have tried the conduit thing and die every time but then again I die no matter what I do at that event
---
Yeah unfortunately that's a known bug, not 100% guaranteed to happen but it's triggered by an event ending while you're dead/dying
---
You on Xbox? Guessing cuz (A) to respawn lmao
---
If you want I'll give you a circuit board to give it another go, stuff like that sucks
---
One idea that I would love to do came from the nukashine spawn point down south. If only the physics of spike boards worked the same with players and corpses, I would totally make one just to launch people off super high cliffs solely for the amusement lol
---
I bought the game in March and have only been killed at workshops I've taken (which is supposed to happen, and it only happened twice.) Opposite of that, I've had at least 4 high level players just drop plans at my feet!  I think you'll enjoy the public server just fine.
---
Thats not a bad way to do it. Instanced interiors. Hadn't heard.
---
Meant that there are some items that don't spoil but can't be displayed, yet they specifically allowed some items that do spoil. (there are some items that spoil that they don't allow, like the scorch beast consumables)
---
They haven't specified instanced interiors but if there's a single programmer with a single braincell left there......
---
I use something very close to that, currently toying around with a few perks like Dodgy &amp; Ghoulish.  I swapped from being a rifleman when I yanked a bloody explosive gatling gun off the queen &amp; it's been a blast.
---
Just a thought on Lifegiver, if you're sticking to about 20% health to get the emergency protocols &amp; nerd rage going that's only going to give you about 6 hp extra I think.  Might not be worth the perk points.
---
If you play on Xbox, I am one of the helpful, non-greifer Vault Dwellers and would help you out with some items and whatnot to get you on your way and (hopefully) change the sour taste the game has left you with 😉. DM me if you want some genuine help! I'll be on most of the day tomorrow!
---
There was a glitch early on in the game. I can't remember the specifics but I remember scrapping items after I'd moved my CAMP which removed them from the budget, but if you placed the previous blueprint down then they'd reappear for 'free' in budget terms. Something like that, but I guess if you had a camp like that and you've stayed there ever since, it could be absolutely huge.
---
Sure, give us more budget equivalent. Great. Love it. Agreed. But if they won't I'd still appreciate this. There are a lot of people who appreciate the camp building aspect. Hell, fo4 camp builders kept that game going. I get this is online, but if it doesn't hurt online play, why not add this that a decent sized subgroup of players might enjoy?
---
Thanks. What is it mainly farmed for by high level players?
---
You can't kill cheswick
---
I’m also confused now, does this mean that if you want atoms, you should complete all your adventure mode daily challenges before doing a NW match? I’m super new to NW so I hadn’t experienced this yet.
---
To add to this, if you can get the safe and clean disposal site, just north of Whitesprings, you'll find a lot more cobolt than just the sap.
---
Trap base
---
Hell yeah!  If they decide to add these weapons hopefully it’s in an Energy Weapon type of update where they get buffed.  They’re rather underwhelming right now and it’s a shame.
---
The best thing to do for fo1st, is to refund it, then lock it. Fix the game, give it a real end game. Make it respectable, then unlock fo1st let people pay for it. This game doesnt need a subscription,  having it hurts the game. They dont need a have and have nots. Giving increased camp budget will piss off people without it, when fo1st first came out there was anger. private worlds alone, should be the main thing, maybe give them speical cosmetics. Paywalling a single players fallout experience,  when half thier player base wanted it was scummy in the first place.
---
Ohh neato, thank you!
---
Thats one for trap base hehe.
---
I was happy about whole situation... I picked Greg. When he wakes you can say 4 options. 1 is intelligence or perception +4. 1 is charisma (which I didn't have). Eitherway I was disappointed in the lack of conversation options. Once you pick something you're already dumped into the final response choice of being mean or nice. I wanted to hear what he thought of everything &amp; how they tricked him into giving up his brain. He did mention a few lines of stuff during his crafting. But I couldn't hear it over all the robots that conveniently spawned in waves for no reason at all &amp; forced me to miss the juicy lore. At the end he mentioned finding that doctor (the dias doctor brain) &amp; wanting to destroy it. He then drives over half way through the office &amp; stops. Your not able to talk to him anymore unfortunately... I was hoping I could get him as a pet in my camp or at least have him join us in foundation or that army crew could use him as a new teammate. Sigh, alas development time constraints... instead he's kinda left wondering the halls of the place he hates.
---
TY for typing this up, much appreciated!
---
Bugfixes. Was a great loss when they were nerfed.
---
OG whitespring nuke zones haha
---
Thanks :) like I said in another comment I've been there before lol of all the frustrating things in this game that's one of the worst
---
Always helpful to have multiple locations for things, and lower level players might not know how to find The Deep. This is an easily accessible place to find some if you're looking for it, In addition to Black Mountain Ordinance in the Forest, where there are maybe three or four plants there.
---
I'd be willing to bet it'll never happen. Not without significant upper management changes e.g. if they ever sold the company or fired all the execs.
---
There are a few things people don't realise
---
1. The game engine isn't the same from back from Morrowind (or pick any other older game). Even from Fallout 4, you can't run 76 on Fallout 4's base engine. They're constantly iterating on it, "improving" it (I use that term very loosely).
---
2. Age isn't exactly the issue, since Unreal engine game out around the same time.
---
3. Switch to a new engine isn't a silver bullet. There is zero guarantee that a switching to a new engine would automatically give you improvements in stability, functionality etc. At a bare minimum staff have to get up to speed learning the new engine and deal with that own engine's quirks and issues.
---
Migrating to a new engine may eventually bare fruit but it'd be many games later and maybe even over a decade before you see genuinely good results. This kind of shit takes time and a lot of trial and error to get right.
---
Even then, are you sure it's an engine issue and not a general skill/competency one?
---
Lead, steel for crafting ammo. Some may farm cloth and acid to help make gunpowder. 
---
High radiation fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass, flora flux to make stable flux. Stable flux is used to craft/repair some power armor and to create ultracite ammo
---
Probably not lol, the issue I have with it is the horrible stutter when new assets are loading in. The performance can be shit sometimes but the stutter is worse
---
I saw a multiple cabin base setup on here on a creek bed it looked great.
---
I thought it was only reach possum scout etc...
---

Oh nice. I haven't seen a cabin base (or maybe I did and it's not really good).
---
Saw whitespring nuked about 20 minutes ago, so there are some out there still nuking it. Someone also launched a second nuke before the whitespring one even landed on the SBQ so everyone went there instead. My game crashed mid sbq fight though.
---
You can in theory get them all from whitespring.  Yellowcake crimson fluorescent are all over.  Cobalt is there more towards the train station side.  Violet there is some but the snap tails don’t always turn.
---
I like the set for the arm &amp; torso 'bolt' things. They're good to mix &amp; match with other skins. I find the grey LP skin torso goes particularly nicely with blue camouflage everything else.
---
So you're going to steal jerseyghost's content without even linking to the original source?

Well i opened my mail this morning they basically say thanks for contacting us,sent feedback,dont expect a reply, basically a kinder F off.

Yeah sure we can play together sometime, i work tomorrow but ill be free at night
---
Well then, the shocks and emergency protocols are both extremely rare. Both under 1% respectively, every other plan seems to be pretty common
---
3* is max. Anything above is a hacked item.

This is similar

Not every single PC player.
---
Gotta get em all. I had that dang electrician badge bugged until Wastelanders update fixed it and now I’m swimming in badges. I love selling the high capacity mod. Let me grind for you.
---
I absolutely love this game. Although it aint going to happen they really need an update their  engine. Especially with next gen consoles coming this year. Youre talking 10 year old tech. ALOT has changed in 10 years, and beth needs to get with the program.
---
It makes me sad when play FO76 after i have hopped on  red dead online for a bit. There's not much of a comparison in regards to graphics/animations and overall smoothness.
---
Yeah but it's  labeled as "Daily: Mistaken Identity" in the dailies tab and is part of the daily challenges for 80 atoms.
---
Ok thanks i appreciate it
---
Oh wow that's nice. Simple, yet unique. What is that wheel thing on the right?
---
That actually sounds like fun.
---
Noted. Post deleted!
---
Yes, it’s really fun to use and it’s very helpful in fights. Also I’m pretty sure it adds 20 carry weight.
---
Do you care only about the short term or long term? Short term it's expensive. Long term, you know people will always want the mutation serum (unless it gets heavily nerfed later) so there will always be buyers for it.
---
It was. I went back 5 times.
---
Super duper mart, first time fo3, these have nothing on it, it's the moment where your jaw drops.
---
Yep
---
&gt; [Starlight Creeper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Starlight_berries) 
---
It's just a rare ingredient, nothing game-changing about it. You need it for one of the [Pioneer Scout Challenges](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Seared_venison_with_berries), you can use it in [several different recipes](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Starlight_berries) this just seemed like one of the easiest places to find it quickly for anyone who might need it.

Obsidian
---
Someone is still searching for the red asylum outfit!
---
Thats the water wheel sadly its currently bugged. Its a Atom shop item.
---
I gotta do that. Label it as “free fast travel”
---
I kind of understand the mindset of some people who only wants to farm exp during rumble, what puzzles me are those who fails to read the instruction during encrytid.
---
I would pick the Holorifle from the F:NV DLC. I just love the fact it shoots holograms at enemies
---
MAKE BASHING WORTH IT!
---
To be fair. I have a trap base for 1 character, a bar type base for another. Then I have 1 right at the bottom of 76 to help those new players just beginning.
---
I think mothman cult, could lead us into some dark scary shit. Kind of like the haunted book and obselk, could be interesting in future dlc, wont be raiders of old but something.
---
Huh. I didnt noticed that. Sadly I don't have any up-to-date plans XD I dont want to finish the main mission because I want to get both ammo and fertilizer bomb plans.
---
Yes its very worth it.. I just made a new character which doesn't have this mutation.. i feel stuck to the ground without it.
---
I was going to say this looks oddly familiar
---
Happy cake day
---
Oh bloody hell lol Fuck that.... I barely tolerated the first few.... Hard pass on badge chasing now.
---
I would love to join a fellow moose. But my PS4 has been taken over by my daughter.
---
I did that today to some level 2 and level 3 people. It took them a minute to realize they could open the bag, but I left some stimpaks,  radaway, purified water, and a cherry nuka cola. I gave them the thumbs up emote to show I was friendly as they both immediately drew out some weapons. Ha
---
The back Mountain Ordinance disposal yard is littered with them as well.
---
That's nice and good for you to help beginners. I like the idea that you have three characters. I want to make another character with a better build but idk if I can put the effort in XD
---
Yes
---
Ah I never managed to find violet there but that makes sense! The cobalt comes off the trees right?
---
You can already raise 6 stats by 20 with unyielding armor
---
Very much. I make the serums and max out my dailies to the rail vendors. Sell em in vending machines when i want to make money with them. You can sell 2 a day for 1000caps so a couple weeks pays for the recipe. Well worth it, then start working on other serums.
---
Berry Mentats
---
Whitesprings is a great place to acquire all of them.
---
You can still get them but i believe it costs gold bullion i might be wrong though.
---
The big one is, I think, Berry Mentats. I have one character who is nearly always using them.
---
I heard he only sells on Saturdays and/or Sundays
---
If all of the plans were just available from vendors...
---
Vampires 10% +1P. It's pretty cool as it frees up needing fireproof for CQC.
---
The way I saw it when I decided to get fallout 1st was like this, the price is 13 USD a month, 1650 atoms equates to approximately 15 USD based on the processor of their atom packs. How I saw it was, I already was a big spender on cap cosmetics, so I might as well get the perks. So I  a nutshell I'm paying for atoms each month, and everything else equates to freebies, in my thought process.
---
I am looking for a bloodied, explosive, quad/two shot/other, lever action rifle/Fixer/other type of rifle. Will pay 2-8 thousand caps for it. Also if anyone has any legacy energy weapons I am also looking for them.
---
Dang, do you get gold bullion from treasure maps?
---
So the lag thing never catches up as long as they started buying once?
---
This game and vendors and stashes. Sheesh.
---
It's like they built it on Sharepoint.
---
Those are the on-rotation public events.  Players can’t trigger them to start. They will also award treasury notes
---
I wish more melee reasons had useful viable differences. I wouldn't mind relying on a golf club or baton if they just made them useful somehow.
---
Trees and silt beans.  There’s 2 or 3 around what I call the end of the ghoul loop, and 2-3 if you go up the hill past where the service entrance is.
---
Wait...I could have been roaming around Appalachia with Beckett this whole time?!?
---
i can help, what is your psn lvl 231 here
---
I'm using excavator power armor, mostly for the extra storage. I'd like to eventually use the ultracite armor but i have really bad luck with drops from sbq.  Being able to use emergency protocols and jet pack would be awesome. I'm using the liberty prime skin now and I'd be like Iron Monger flying around. 
---
I was really underwhelmed by power armor until I came across this build, so I hear you on how this was how PA was meant to be.
---
lol... just make everything super expensive and rename the top item "message me with offers"
---
That's so awesome! I've been working my way to making something similar. I have a second story bar/ diner with the tables over looking to an open view of the valley / canyon. It's all nuka cola themed. (Only the recent stuff that hit the atom shop but I'm still searching for old plans of the other stuff.) I have a lounge area off to the side with a jukebox and couches. next time you stumble across that take some screenshots! I would love to see what they came up with!!! 😊😊
---
I've seen you post this before and it's still so amazing! What platform are you?
---
I play a lot but I can still say the game is far from good, just in my opinion. Glad you like it tho
---
He still there? PSN is WorkablePuffin
---
Laser rcw and the thermite lance
---
I normally wouldnt use it, but it meshes with some mutations strangely and basically makes you unkillable at low levels. Check out angry turtle on youtube, I think the video was called something like "how am I so tanky"
---
If your are on pc I can drop him some gear
---
Get a vault tech alarm clock and a collectable baseball
---
I bought one when I found a camp selling it for only 500 caps. I've never seen it for sold so low I had to buy one. I only had it one fast travel as the next camp had a decontamination Arch attached strip me of my mutation. But, I just recently made one and now I have to starch gene card so it won't go anywhere. Ha.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I’m available to help if you’re still with it psn is lopezcommalauren
---
I mean that’s asking a lot haha, that’s a mess of TOS and matching account requirements and such between Microsoft and Sony. Now Xbox - PC...
---
Man I love reddit
---
Usernames checks out
---
My bad, every single person on Bethesda launcher
---
I may sound stupid, but how do you place a tent on xbox?
---
Because it's the exact same model as the ones used in Nuka World
---
Wait for 5-10 minutes and you will be able to respawn as normal
---
This game is kind of unforgiving in the beginning. All ammo , aid &amp; junk feels very rare . Try going melee route or sneak, will save you a ton of ammo
---
Whitesprings 100%. It makes up for any shortfall that the SBQ nuke, which happen regularly enough that you don't need to go out of your way to nuke that too.
---
Way back when i was doing what i do in most multiplayer games *exploring areas that are far beyond my level but damnit you wont stop me* a level 120 came across me and looked at me confused as hell as i was on a roof with about 20 charred ghouls below me and i was out of ammo and everything else man took a fatman out and wasted them then gave me some 200 shot gun shells and like 50 stimpacks and sone food and water
---
Whitesprings is best if you just want flux (non-specific) as you also can get lots of mats off the glowing ones. Best time is after the first rush (about an hour after the nuke), When whitesprings is almost empty is when you want to make your run. I start from the train station, go along cottage row to the golf course then up the other side to the maintenance area with a stop at the sulfur spring fountain for disease cure. if you are playing with a friend, log out and back in at the train station (separately to come back to the same world). then rinse and repeat the route again. In a standard nuke run I can do 3-5 passes and get about 20 of each type of mat per run. best results in a private would but do not expect much the first run as all need to respawn, but can re-run solo coming back to same world. If you view whitesprings on a map with nuke zone and no players in it...head to it. for flux; I normally find enough for about 7 crimson, 20+ florescent/yellow, 2-3 cobalt/violet. any left over mats I use on other nuke zones (fissure prime for violet, morgantown for cobalt). High radiation fluid is normally limiting factor, but excess glowing mass you can sell and scrap hardened massed for ultracite used in serums.
---
Yes please! The Wattz 2000 Laser Rifle and its Wattz 1000 Laser Pistol counterpart would be awesome!
---
I miss the actual Gauss Rifle we had in Fallout 3/New Vegas but i would be ecstatic if they brought back to M72 Gauss Rifle from Fallout 1/2/Tactics!
---
Laser RCW would be an awesome conversion for the Sub Machinegun we already have in-game.
---
Amen
---
Umm unreal engine has gone thru massive revisions in the same timeframe, the creation engine has been patched with chewing gum and spit, I can tell that and I'm not even a programmer.  
---
Best I can tell is corp mandates what's cost effective to fix due to its not normal human nature to leave a shit show around, people like to be proud of there work most of the time.
---
0h my god this might actually force them to fix that bug
---
What is that outfit
---
There’s one that occasionally spawns in the downstairs bathroom of one of the two story houses in Whitesprings.
---
Haha i remeber when i was exploring the area back then and suddenly oh shit wtf is that OH SHIT WHERE DID THESE PEOPLE COME up i effectively became a medic while also blasting a ocasional scorched in the face like 3 guys gave me armor and legendaries i couldnt even use yet and it was sine good legendaries too
---
Maybe they are a real version here.. Remember this is long before Fallout 4.
---
Nope. I’m not a clothing collector. No point in power armor. 
---
The fallout games made it seem special when you opened a door into a building. 
---
Open a door now and everything is dead and looted. Now it just feels like you’re an extra in someone else’s story.
---
The Far Harbor biscuits are delicious
---
The events without exclamation points only cost caps to fast travel to them, and you are paying the same caps you would to fast travel to that same location, even if no event were going on.  If you are already in the event area, or you run there, then it doesn't cost you anything.  MangyMoose76 already explained the ones with the exclamation points.
---
Isn't God mode disabled? (I'm thinking of the God mode you can enable while playing fallout 4 and such on PC) that's still crazy
---
No the plans cost. i think after you get enough rep.
---
Nm well fuck, I had read something different at one point.. Now fuck I'm even more depressed about any new Bethesda games..
---
She's been playing outer worlds lately, but mostly animal crossing because her friends are in there.
---
You can purchase the shielded lining for the SS underarmor as soon as patch 20 is available. 
---
It is currently boasting the best overall underarmor stats iirc. 
---
I think many people have it in their heads that because they have already purchased the SS underarmor they will simply get the shielded lining when it arrives, but it is in fact a plan you purchase separately with gold bullion.
---
I miss Dogmeat or an animal companion :( Would be awesome to have in 76.
---
This is actually true,it all originates from the same thing and all have very similar beliefs! It’s better to describe it as passing the word on and it slowly gets garbled and altered as it moves down the line of people,if you know what I mean
---
Could u explain or link to what they’ve said about pvp?
---
Makes the game way easier if you’re into that sorta thing.
---
Ok I hope I never experience this.
---
By "real end game" you mean the game coming to an actual end?
---
Got no mic either. Looking for a group too. Im low level though. Level 22. Just trying to get to 50.PSN cheapshot-2882..
---
Been having bad luck with the SBQ being nuked. I’m on PS4 and it seems, lately at least that she only gets nuked Monday mornings.
---
It’s an online multiplayer game...
---
To specify its the capt cosmos armor from fallout 4 cc with a black variant
---
Thanks. I do try and pay it forward. I tend to have way more stims and some ammo and building supplies not used given out. I leave what I dont need behind. It has been pretty fun considering I noped playing for so long.
---
is there any info on what the effects are for the ss underarmor linings?
---
That explanation is exactly what I was looking for, thanks again for breaking it down.
---
Yes. 
---
You can also submit a ticket to Bethesda support asking for the atoms you missed out on but that’s a lot more work.
---
A cool idea.   I am still slowly working through the badges.  Just completed there Medic badge because I forgot to get the right perk cards.  I will knock ot the code breaker one next.
---
I'd do something like this for max balls.

---
Stupid question so logging out of the world and back in makes the plants respwan? God I’ve been playing since release and I don’t know half this stuff. I feel dumb lol. Also makes me wish I had someone to play with.
---
Right... did you understand that the op was asking what you missed from other games?? I know this is on line ... there are other actual people controlling characters in the game...
---
Hahahahahhahh
---
Im glad u finally joined and having great experiences
---
There all pointless unless for cosmetic several tuber have debunked em theres a minor fraction of actual difference in damage reduction between the sets so your real choice is +100 carry weight for excavator or a jetpack... And none is worth the grind
---
This Machine from New Vegas.  .308 would be useful on a broader scale &amp; the sound of the enblock flinging out is the best.
---
I think it was meant to be able to equip more cards.
---
Cool thanks
---
Saw a roll of duct tape on my kitchen table this evening and stared at it longingly for a few seconds
---
&gt; Bethesda is only going to keep creeping closer and closer to EA turf. end of rant.
---
I could write ten pages of ranting on this. Being a somewhat passionate Skyrim modding fan, I've thought at length about how Bethesda really does feel like they went to my college, repeating stuff I learned when getting my bachelor's in business admin and masters in accounting particularly the marketing and mobile technology courses, trying to get the player engagement and microtransactions as opposed to... making a good game and a good story within those games. slowly creeping towards mobile grindfest slot machines in every game they produce. 
---
I know I may be cynical, probably too much, but they've really given me no reason to not be. How many embarrassing fuckups did they endure with FO76?
---
Never being able to fast travel, makes me depressed. 😕 My carpal tunnel doesn't need those extra button clicks. Over 14 button clicks to fast travel. Taking radx works, but that's extra buttons too.

If I get another mutant-slayers pipe pistol I'm putting it to my head and pulling the trigger.. but I still love this game.
---
There's this YouTube video explaining the connections between tanagra town and an episode of star trek the next generation. Blew my mind
---
Lol :D
---
Or you can just enter atomic shop before starting to play. Works wonders as well.
---
Lol
---
I was drunk and high and playing fallout one evening when ( in a longer story) my partner and i were discussing the condemning of an old building for demolition / that used to be an old cinema ,  hours later im foraging through the building with my phone as my pip boy light , and both realities converged , no ghouls though 🤔😕
---
Problem with this is the paper number lie, go look up actual footage of people testing the armor in game...  Beside SS yes right now SS is the best
---
Chemist backpack can be found at crater after you reach a certain rep
---
Grocers backpack can be found at foundation after you reach a certain rep
---
The gauss minigun is op
---
Secret service armor has the best stats out of them all and the way you get legendary versions is to just craft it or get it from the purveyor plus you can get a jetpack for the secret service chest piece
---
So that’s what happened...Experienced it earlier and didn’t know WTF happened...
---
Exactly. If I can build an actual minigun, why can't I build something like a repeater crossbow?
---
It really depends on how much you value it vs how much someone else values it.  Some people will spend big or trade big for it. Some people couldn't care less.
---
Other players can't see the names you give weapons/armor.
---
finally fixed that dumb respawn bug
---
Had a “trap” of boards hit me while at a vending station today. Went back to take out the building and get my junk back but nothing would do damage to the camp. What’s that about?
---
Stogiesnbogeys
---
We already have an end of the game, the vault dwellers saved the world from the SBQ. We need an actual point to play though, maybe death claws riding mutant behemoths, with dual weild lmgs making Rambo quotes. Easter eggs or bigger bosses, a real pvp world ( faction wars). Somthing to do, when your chartar is maxed out.
---
I’d take both of those, though automatic melee weapons need some work first before the lance should even bother showing up.
---
PC. Mogmeat, and visitors are welcome
---
Not a problem! You learn some nifty tricks and tips just lurking in the comments sometimes!
---
Have fun and stay safe out there in the Wasteland!
---
I read that the legendary effects on secret service armour can be sort of chosen. Like its not an RNG. Do you know how that works?
---
Yeah, I just discovered that recently when I was trying to knock off all the challenges. 17/18 in daily missions
---
18/19...lol
---
In the OP is a the change of pvp :)
---
Oh there's ways of removing the items from game there doing it with dev room items, they just don't care or bother most of the time
---
Them concern trolls. My 4 year old plays this game and it doesn’t bother him. I mean he does try to attack me now and Kees swearing but I’m sure it’s from the Disney channel. No way does this game reinforce negative behaviors, especially among kids who are unable to distinguish the difference between games and real life until after 5 years old. (3-5, age 12 they reach the same level as an adult).
---
You can pull the trigger multiple times, cause mutant Slayer don't do shit!
---
I agree with you completely.  It’s weird that everyone seems okay with this exploit but not, say, the old xp glitches. Twitch streamers are encouraging it as well. 
---
Mainly, this is steel junk exploit. I get why it’s done. Steel/ammo is a chore to keep up with.
---
There’s a lot of unproven superstition that you can weight the rolls, like if you have all unyielding gear you get a better chance of unyielding.  I call BS on that at the moment, but there’s a lot of people who really believe that.
---
Also SS armor stat wise is best in slot.  Go for the chest first, it has all mod choices.
---
This is true but doesn't negate anything said. It's just not a valid argument pointing to an engine's age.
---
yeah sadly I circled around on both characters and still couldn't get it to trigger.
---
whitesprings has enough for all of the flora.
---
Some newb was running around in a space suit level one the other day right outta the vault / your welcome lol
---
Yeah as the other guy said its all rng like everything else
---
What's the mats for it look like? I'd love to have someone install it for me but I don't know how expensive the mats for it and if the install itself would be expensive.
---
I think they've invested too much time and money into the creation engine to use a new one they'd have to learn. 
---
A big part of the problem with this engine seems to be how much it has changed, had things added, removed, tacked on etc, so it has become one big mud ball of a mess in its code. It'll now always be an engine that is un-optimised and full of bugs.
---
Okay thanks alot!!
---
And that's why I bring my ghoul-slayers tire iron as a backup. So I can bash my head in!
---
You can make your caps back fast if you get good at farming flux. 
---
Farm the mats first, you’re going to want a mule because masses are heavy af. I like either nuking Morgantown, having a friend in the server. 
---
Kill all the ghouls, go back to the station. Leave server, re join and rinse repeat.
---
Then once you’ve got all your goods drop a nuke on a high flora area and then craft away. You’ll want to make sure you use super duper for best results.
---
They just need to buff the burn damage and make it a legendary effect for energy weapons.
---
It would make them on par with egacy energy/explosives weapons.
---
Not sure, but it's been a long time. 🙁
---
Totally a lot more work. Thanks for clarifying this for me! I always try to do the daily challenges. Luckily I usually only play NW after adventure mode anyway.
---
"Darmok and jalad at tanegra" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok
---
The only way it'd be even remotely viable is if you had to sacrifice the power armour pieces to create a PA display of that PA type.
---
If it's something dynamic like the display cases, I'm guessing it'll never happen. You have to render 6 separate pieces of PA dynamically, per display. You add all the other display options and it starts to add up in terms of server performance drain. At least with my suggestion, you're only loading in one static item vs 7 (6 armour pieces + the display stand itself).
---
Same deal with regular armour display mannequins. Same problem.
---
Wow, you signed in once and ended up on an empty server?  do you think there's a single pts or something?
---
Get her mission and just do the infinite rep glitch then never do it again once your max
---
There's quite a bit of stuff. I can say I've purchased the gauss pistol, shotgun and minigun. Purchased the full set of secret service and mods. Unlocked the under armor(waiting for a patch to be able to mod it). The ammo machine is pretty cool. It's free ammunition. About 200 5.56 an hour. Not bad for the vendor. 
---
The gauss weapons are cool. Currently a shotgun build, so using the gauss shotgun. It's amazing. Have a Furious, Mutant's and Suppressors. The Junkie's pistol is fun to plink with, I didn't use it spec'd. The minigun was alright. It's just not my style and it eats disgusting amounts of 2mm ec, the most expensive and pretty heavy ammo. 
---
There's a lot more for you to discover.
---
Interesting. I hadn’t thought about issues like that.
---
They already have apparently, either on purpose or accidentally.  One of the youtubers that's been recording their PTS sessions said in one of the videos that they stopped having to repeatedly attempt to fast travel.
---
Only happens to me in encryptid, but seems pretty common during that event, hopefully its being addressed in update 20 or something.
---
First properly label armour so you know exactly which type you have then after that, maybe this.
---
People can still use terminals while you are at it
---
It happens to me 3 out of every 4 deaths :(
---
You know what I'm done arguing about the shit show that is Bethesda, I left a month after release is disgust just came back to try again with a second chance to show my son something and I get sucked into this circular shit show online,  it's my own fault.
---
Bethesda is a corporation for which 76 is a product to separate you from you money and make as much profit as possible, I get that it what company's do. 
---
But there's a good way to do it and then there a slimy scum sucking way that leave you feeling dirty for buying it after. But wtf does Bethesda care they got my money... I'm out.
---
Btw you didnt reply to him, you replied to yourself and they didnt get your message. Confused me for a sec lol
---
I rolled 14 today and got 2 unyielding and then 12 garbage rolls.
---
I don’t even play bloody D:
---
you singlehandedly ruined his chance to be part of fanartfriday lol
---
Best serum for both mutaton-centric builds and regular builds. Takes away 4 intellect, but adds 20 to carry weight and lets you move around with ease. The Intellect stat is only needed for crafting higher durability items and a very few skill checks in dialogue, so its downside is really meh. 
---
The other one I really like is Speed Demon. These two make solo play enjoyable.
---
I want everyone to look at all of these upcoming bug fixes and how often Bethesda has been able to release patch after patch to the pst over the last few weeks... this is what the game could have ALWAYS been like if consoles weren't holding us back.
---
Keeping PC and consoles on the same versions and locked to the same update schedule is and always will be fucking stupid as long as console cert exists.  This is why other games are able to release PC updates often on a weekly or bi weekly basis and have necessary hotfixes out within the same day as updates if not within hours of an updates release, and then when everything is stable release to console when everything is ready.
---
It's actually the bugged af damage calculations that have the check against DR to decide what % to take off happen **before** perks and other modifiers are taken in. Combine that with the general low condition of them and lasers are practically useless.
---
A thousand up votes for you!!
---
This is the most recent time someone asked this question I think and I havnt seen an answer on any other thread. I went out and tested it today and perfect storm does NOT work with friendly fire. For any future gamers reading this I recommend just getting a shishkabob since it doesn’t need ammo!
---
That doesn't make it any better? You're killing people to gain loot. I know you say it's more than mindless killing, but do you think I child has the cognitive ability to think the morals through on that?
---
The ability to turn survival off or perhaps different ammo types, and something more plausible for bethesda's abilities maybe the return of the ammo packs for weapons like the mini gun or an m1 garand or as i know it from new vegas the bozar that bullpup are was pretty cool looking
---
Yes I did. I love those games. Really want a kotor3 lol
---
I usually run in with my PA, hit the first one, spam 6 stims in a row, and grab the last two.
---
If and when you go down, don't instantly respawn if you can help it. If you're on your knees, you're still a conduit.
---
Yes but the God mode in this is usally caused by some lag or effect that lags you when you die
---
I want the power fists back.
---
This was me, until I realised that what I really loved about 76 and 4 was the building aspect. So now I just play minecraft instead, generally while listening to 50’s jazz.
---
I'm going to every post I see and saying 
---
🍌 Banana 
---
That sucks
---
Can confirm this. I was on the terminal trying to stop the randoms from starting project paradise while my team mates were still loading in and some level 20 started it anyway.
---
I did it with the baseball guy statues so the bats were all around him
---
Is is yinz, or youse, or y'all? I just can't keep up.
---
You're a savage if you leave doors open, especially at camps. You're a savage if you close doors. 
---
There's just no winning either way.
---
Yeah exactly, I mean I think its clear at this point both (or the one) entity are very much real and not just some cool easter egg we aren’t meant to take seriously, I do hope they expand on the Ug-Qualtoth stuff in a future 76 Expansion, its so interesting from a lore perspective but these tidbits are torturr! I want real content on it!
---
My 2 greatest dreams in life are KOTOR 3 and a new animated Avatar series but I've long since given up hope.
---
It's sucks bananas
---
Ahh don’t let them make bibles...please
---
First thing to note is that those damage numbers lie. It's almost never what it says it is.
---
You mean having a bunch of legendary perk cards that cause mobs to explode don’t do anything for you?? I’m shocked.  Actually I like to think some bethesda employee was running it by his kids as to what they thought the legendary perk cards should be and all they kept saying was “more explosions.
---
Edit:  yes I am aware there are other perk cards as well, but ultimately none of them serve any purpose in my game play.
---
Buy from a player. Ive seen it as low as 400 caps
---
I do miss having a team mate to help you. When I learned you could tame animals in fo76 i was so excited to have a pet mole rat or other creature to just roam around with. Turns out it just makes your camp feel more lively, which is okay but yeah its no dogmeat.
---
IIRC that's been fixed for Update 20 according to the changelogs.
---
I actually made a Fallout 76 easter egg video which included this easter egg!
---
 https://youtu.be/zp6Ru_jSiaM
---
they really need to make the game worthy of a sub cost, but i honestly dont see that happening.  not with their track record for bug fixing in previous games.
---
That was before my time. How has whitesprings changed?
---
Serums go for 200-350c nowadays btw. (It's been this way for more than a year now) No need to buy 'em at higher prices.
---
Dude I have the best glitch ever for ward, the game always thinks I have the stolen item even if I just started the quest so I legit never have to do any leg work for him again when I'm able to play
---
I am not even sure what the other guy was arguing. Someone said the game is not based around mindless killing without purpose, he said it is, then he contradicted himself and said its not about mindless killing but it sucks.
---
My opinion is that people need to stop trying to tell someone how parent their kid. If he feels okay with him playing the game, mindless killing or not, then leave him be.
---
If that's the case, why on earth is everything's health so high??
---
Hey ill take anything other than raiders bad settlers good. Even now theirs nothing different between them other than looks. Settlers want to rebuild, Raiders want to rebuild but steal a few things. Nothing really sets them apart.
---
Man idk the all start girl power raiders meg,rocksy, and wren are puuuurdy scary not to mention the mistresses of mystery ohhhhh boiii did that really get me shaking ...yeah we got a pretty vanilla wasteland there’s some gems in there ....like the super spoooky freak in watoga that literally feels compelled to tell me how she prefers to use machines for pleasure ...the writing flat out blows and stinks of estrogen....rose is good
---
Fo4 had a M1 Garand mod. Probably one of my favorite gun mods. I agree, we need more weapon variety!
---
For your specific build there isn't much to get. Maybe SS armour so you can try to roll an unyielding version. Makes you noticeably more tanky than current armour types.
---
There aren't any weapons really for you. Rifles (auto or otherwise) weren't catered for during this DLC run. You might consider one of the backpack mods like the chem one if it suits your build and could free up some perk slots if you're using travelling pharmacy.
---
That's about it really.
---
A 9 year old does yes. Not to mention he is playing with his father watching and who is more then likely helping him distinguish fantasy and reality. Kids are smarter then they are given credit for.
---
This sub should make it a requirement that every time someone comes here to inquire or complain about a big they must post what platform they are on. No this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a bug within the game but at the very least it would allow to see if a particular issue is platform specific. 
---
For example I play on a PS4 Pro (with a decent internet connection and SSD installed) and outside the game occasionally crashing I have yet to run into any of these discussed bugs such as missing X item, stuck in X quest, missing Power Armor or Respawn bug.
---
I got it for a day and a half, was about to delete the cache when I decided to try one more time and it loaded.
---
Funny story me and my friend want to go into an abandoned building now you just gave me the idea of getting high and downloading a dark green picture to pretend I’m in fallout 😂
---
Wow, thank you. It's a real shame the way that perk works. My newest inquiry is does +40 bashing damage increase friendly fire benefits? And once again thank you!
---
Check Mappalachia. One map with all Flux (quite crowded) but also for each of the types. That can help you decide where to nuke.
---

Id love mannequins just to show off outfits... but, i get it.

😂
---
Thought I was pretty clear who the author was in my post. Not trying to steal anyone's content, just trynna help.
---
Just sticking to the dailies and finishing the quest line it took me about 35 days.
---
Just because you mention the author, doesn't make it any less copyright infringement. 
---
The fact that you won't even link to the original video speaks volumes.
---
Implants actually raised the stat.. not only its buffs
---
you cant use cards with unyeilding bonus..
---
They removed the legendary effect from the mask in a patch about a month ago.
---
Sell them?
---
I spent hours farming spots and never found 1 of the items so I just gave up. Guess minigun all the way, just wish I could build the flower beds
---
I believe it does! I havnt tested but I’m like 90% sure someone told me it does. If I find one to test with I’ll try to remember to update this comment!
---
Yes! the bodies handing from the ceiling, the mist that filled the room. You could hear the raiders in the back as you try to sneak around making sure not to get caught bc you know youre outnumbered. I love the early game of every fallout the best.
---
Damn. That's a shame. You'll get 'em next time pal!
---
this is how implants worked
---
I did something different last time. After activating I ran in the shed and crouched down to hide. It worked.
---
Thanks again.
---
Yeah I remember before they released that kotor mmo I really was hoping it was a true kotor3. Boy was I disappointed. I'll be interested to see what Netflix does with the live action remake of avatar
---
😆 Seriously it's a post apocalyptic RPG. At some point the dialogue runs out. Welcome to video game's. If you're depressed about this that into it self should be depressing. 🙄
---
I've just gone back to playing classic  fo1 and fo2
---
30/6
---
Biggest fear about seasons is that it will just bork out.
---
Delete the cache? Like reinitializing your ps4?
---
Yes!
---
9 Ultracite, 17 aluminium, 1 fiberglass, 17 adhesive, and 5 stable violet flux per leg. No idea how much is reduced with the power crafter perk, but it might be a fair chunk
---
If you didnt want to supply the mats it probably cost 750 per leg in caps
---
Just like MagisD mentioned in paper there's a difference but in practicality there's no real difference between the Power Armors out Excavator Armor having more carry weight, extracting x4 ore from mining points and all Power Armor sets having access to a Jetpack EXCEPT the Excavator Armor which doesn't have any Jetpack Mod.
---
There were a ton of legendary ghouls and they were worth way more XP.
---
Ayyyy. Someone else who chose “scorched”. I felt it was more lore friendly. We are a rare breed.
---
PC here, and haven’t seen the bug referenced by OP post either.  But I am rarely encumbered when I die, I suspect that has something to do with it.
---
I just bought from him on Monday. There’s an unknown cause for his glitch.
---
I had this a few time I got sick and just said ok . Spawned in where my camp normally is no one was there at all in my place some times it just can't spawn needs fixing. Add it to the list item 234566 of bug fixes needed lol
---
Ive only played 40 hours. Never had a griefer. Maybe once every 2 days some rando will drop 20 stims in front of me. Weirely nice community
---
Official Bethesda article on it  [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44417/~/what-do-i-do-if-i-get-error-code-ce-34878-0-when-trying-to-play-fallout-76%3F#:~:text=What%20do%20I%20do%20if,corrupt%20data%20or%20system%20software.&amp;text=Press%20and%20hold%20the%20%5BPS%5D%20button%20on%20your%20controller.&amp;text=Allow%20the%20PlayStation%204%20to,for%2010%20to%2020%20seconds) probably nothing you haven't tried already, but worth reading through, I'd leave reinstalling the game as the absolute last step though.
---
Npcs just seem to want to complain to me about their aches and pain and to tell me how hard it is to rebuild. What am I? a therapist?
---
Yes! Fucking automatic sniper rifle
---
This issue could easily be mitigated by having a pop up alert that tells you someone is currently accessing your vending machine and asks if you are sure you wish to exit when you try to leave a server.
---
I am actually having fun. I really enjoy the story lines.
---
Crossbows get in line, .44 still waiting for that bullbarrle.
---
Yea I already tried everything except reinitializing my ps4 as I'm almost certain the problem is entirely on their end
---
What about the teased instanced camps.  Could that get around a lot of server load issues possibly?  Increased budget, stashed away elsewhere.  Or, possibly, an interior and exterior budget?
---
New player btw.   Genuinely interested in any info on instanced camps or camp expansion plans.
---
The interloper hidden in the mines is surrounded by those big heads and a similar obelisk to the Ug-Qualtoth one
---
This has been suggested so many times yet Bethesda just can't get a grip.
---
aint it weird how we can hate the things we love so much? i hate seeing my favorite franchise like this. fo4 was a gem, polarizing for the fallout community, but well made. ...fo76 is made from its scraps. literally. i was playing out my last month of fo1st last week (i paid for it dammit) and i use big guns. i would get this persistent glitch where all my ammo would be dumped into my mag. i carry about 6k~ .50 cal and 5mm rds (apply liberally), so i just had these op guns. they were various one/two stars (i routinely carried 6-8 guns, i bared arms fam), but nothing like that. but what i described *is* a legendary perk. in fo4. its the "Never Ending" perk. a perk not fo76. but yeah, apparently so. my friend i play with reports its happened to him a few times. anyone else?
---
Well, it's been ages since I read the mechanics of 2shot, but here it goes.
---
The second projectile is only a 25% damage bonus
---
Both bullets can hit, miss, or the main can hit or the secondary can hit.  
---
It sounds like only the bonus round is hitting.
---
However, after some experimenting with 2shot ballistic weapons, I just scrip them now.  If its TSE, then it's worth a second look if you can afford the explosive perks.
---
I don't think you read the op correctly
---
bro, your lucky you didn't witness it. Fallout 76 at launch was more bug filled than the trash can by my neighbors house
---
&gt; collectable baseball
---
I didn't even know about this one. Nice tip!
---
alright, in that light, fine. its your life, im never about commanding anyone on their life. i just really feel like bethesda is taking advantage. they can do better because they have.
---
Only time I've ever done this, was once whenever I arrived and there were already like, seven or eight people there all standing around, and the timer was down to two minutes. My buddies were on their way as well, that would make 11-12 people for the event, so I started it up. Got nasty messages from three people who were "waiting to start the event" and I was like, the fuck for? Even if my friends weren't coming, we definitely had plenty of people for the event to complete it.
---
We'll see its possibilities on June 30th when the patch is supposedly set to release, we can't really speculate anything now.
---
I doubt it but if by any chance you are on PS4 my wife basically does the same thing and she enjoys helping newer players.
---
Instanced camps are not a part of patch 20, and currently being worked on for a future update much later this year or sometime next year.
---
Lanterns, gas canisters, lighters and oil cans in Gauly mine = 30 ish oil
---
Oh yeah I messed up these two in my head, I think they stated about its implementation in the winter update on the 2020 roadmap, I guess this is in fact up to speculation.
---
For max level drops
---
Entirely possible, I'd also consider internet, you mentioned it worked at your friends place, I assume you meant your console on his connection? If thats the case, are you able to try using your mobile phones internet connection or something to see if a totally different connection greets you with the same error?
---
Which is people being kind really because you can sell them to venders over &gt; 400 c. But you can only have so many caps .
---
I don't have any data left rn lol but it does work when I use it, it usually works on this internet but for the past week it's been like this
---
Sure whats your name?
---
Do what I did and disrupt several important things in your real life so that you turn your existence into a Fallout style Survival mode for additional excitement till the next update lands.
---
My current real life objective is to finish my kitchen and bathroom remodel and sell my camp before the season ends for a profit of at least 10,000 atoms before my companion leaves me and takes my pet Mutant Hound with her. Then as an optional objective I have to live at my inlaws camp, which has a hostile Deathclaw Matriarch spawn, till I can rebuild my own camp in a new location with more room for my teammates to play in the yard, and preferably in a location without any chem spawns or cultists this time.
---
After logging out and back in multiple times, it went back to normal. So weird. Anyone else ever have this happen?
---
Account locked, once you drop them it will be destroyed therefore they can't be sold
---
B2525. No contest.
---
B2525 is the most valuable of the two, that's a perfect roll and highly sought after.
---
Oh SS armor, I forgot, didn’t realize he meant just SS
---
That's good to hear. Generally speaking 90% of the Fallout 76 community are very decent people, yes there's definitely awful/toxic players out there but the greater majority are really nice/looking to help likeminded players in need.
---
If you need a group to help you out or looking to settle down with like minded people, there's quite a few straightforward/decent groups/clans out there.
---
Just depends on what you're looking for though. 25% of the groups can be a bit rowdy/difficult to get along with but the majority are good as good can get.
---
I just found a flamer with this perk so I'll check that, but I really want to know about the shishkebab. Seeing as you are already bashing?
---
That's not bad at all. Gonna have to see if I can't find someone to put these on for me, I'm on PC.
---
Wow, it’s almost like they’ve already said we’re gonna get this later in the year.
---
That’s hilarious guess for all the bad bugs u get some like that too lol
---
I'm stuck in a loop for no man's sky, battlefront 2, rdr2, and fallout in general. I want to play other games I just can't bring myself to for no good reason
---
Same, I’m near 2000 hours. I’m so bored, I hate Ward, I hate Davenport, I hate The Crater, I hate the legendary exchange, I hate my inventory glitching as I scroll through, I hate the gold bullion system, I hate it.
---
But I like exploring, I like seeing what I can find and what I’ll be rewarded with.
---
I would rather have Power Armor statues, that way we run less of a risk of Bugthesda destroying our Power Armor's.
---
I get the feeling, I've picked up some really nice heavy weapons with junkies. Been itching to try Junkies for awhile now but I don't want a complete rework.
---
I had almost forgotten their 100% promise delivery rate.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
I don’t think you interpreted his comment correctly.
---
With the extra flame jets, a good main roll like junkies or bloodied, and weightless It’s really nice. Tbh I am not sure how it stacks up to the flamer bash but it’s just so satisfying using a flaming ninja sword to heal lol.
---
I laughed at my buddy’s interaction today. He just hit level 45 and is still taking things easy as most creatures and things tear him up still; well he heard an npc yelling for help... screaming for anyone to help him, so my friend says let’s go help but I’m terrified of what’s going to be up there! It was the guy being chased down the road by a little chicken. Haven’t had a good laugh like that in a while!
---
My offer is b/e/15r laser rifle, b/Crit/1p fixer, v/e/1a fixer, b/ffr Cryo, j/ffr hm for the b/25ap/50ld fixer. Does that look fair?
---
&gt;What about the teased instanced camps. Could that get around a lot of server load issues possibly? Increased budget, stashed away elsewhere. Or, possibly, an interior and exterior budget? 
---
To an extent, sure but even an instanced camp has limitations.
---
You can't assume for the best case scenario in terms of performance, you have to assume for the average case. While not having the rest of the world around to worry about outside of your instanced camp, you can't have it bogged down so much that a person with a high performance PC is ok but a min-spec PC or console has severe framerate issues.
---
Maybe that means you get double the regular camp budget. Maybe it's 50% more. I mean something is better than nothing but I get the sense that some people want Fallout 4 levels of building where you're able to build a full settlement. From a device that's called C.A.M.P. and specifically highlights mobility.
---
I guess we'll see in due time but I wouldn't get my expectations all that high.
---
What do you need? I have a little left over.
---
Really only need like 2-3 if you got any. Psn is Cocyatus
---
If your getting the B2525 fixer then I'd say that's fair. Imo your getting it for cheap.
---
Gt is Lord Zane66, or I can join you, whatever works :)
---
Honestly keep an eye on your camp when you are out and about and just server hop if you think people are trying to do something.
---
That seems like the most optimal way to heal as bashing with a flamer really isn't what the card says. But what can you do. I'm just looking for that leg up in PP.
---
What would I like to see return?
---
Obsidian writing the storylines....
---
Crossing into titan fall territory! But yes that would be cool. As long as the visuals weren’t to buggy.
---
Alas, thank you sir. 🙇🏼‍♂️
---
Np
---
Beat me to it, have an upvote!
---
No man's sky has been on my radar for a while now. 
---
I've also considered trying out battlefield 4 since it's on PS Now.
---
The rise and return of true Fallout weaponry to relevance. The laser weapons mostly, however some inconic heavy weapons need it too.
---
Perhaps obtain every single weapon plan available like the Flare Gun, Guantlet, Plasma Caster, Gauss Minigun, Floater Gaza’s Grenades, Dynamite, and what not to burn through the gold bullion.
---
The telephoto lenses give you a kind of advantage already. If you have to take a picture of something dangerous, you can take the shot from farther away and still get credit. No danger to agro the meanie.
---
Wow, that's a massive downgrade from Fallout 4's two shot weapons...
---
The whole notion of passive skills is bad. You may as well make every perk passive. Why limit it to just non-combat perks as people have suggested over and over.
---
All perks have value, even if you don't think so. That's why you want some to be passive because to you it's not valuable enough to "take up" slots but not unimportant enough to just outright ignore.
---
Passive perks are having your cake and eating it. I hope it never comes to the game.
---
With that rant out of the way, your suggestion isn't that shocking, especially considering it's already on the roadmap and planned to come at the end of the year sometime.
---
Yup, that's when you know Thanos is at it again...
---
I just finished Uranium Fever and waddled to White Spring to sell all the weapons etc. I play bloodied and am level 365. 
---
A lowly level 25 motioned me over and laid a bag on the ground with 3 stimpaks. I sent him a message thanking him but that it was unnecessary as I play bloodied. He replied that he thought I needed them because my health was that low. By the time I was finished writing it he had moved on and I couldn't find him. 
---
Keygamer117, your kindness will be warmly rewarded. I have a TSE lever that will quickly become your best friend.
---
Give the Assault Rifle a .308 receiver and it should do as much of not more damage than the handmade’s 5.56 rounds.
---
I’d say you’re getting ripped off.  Isn’t that a legacy laser?
---
Wtf dude, get help.
---
Can't believe they managed to come up with a decent solution.
---
Aye, 2shot got nerfed around patch 5? It was MUCH better.
---
Deathclaw rubber duckies
---
Sorry can you resend request PS4 did something funny.
---
Yeah, I stopped selling 'em to vendors while maintaining full stock of all serums (sell 'em for 349 at my camp) and selling stuff to vendor bots to reach daily cap. Having 30k caps on all alts is really pointless and constantly muling caps is too much hassle.
---
Now I don't even bother to restock serums regularly. Doing it just to get rid of excess flux in my stash since I don't plan to renew 1st sub anytime soon.
---
Lol what the hell are you talking about.
---
I'm on PC and ran into a dude in Charlottesville. He invited me to his group, but I didn't accept because I have really bad social anxiety. He tried trading with me, but because I'm brand new (Been playing for like 6 days total), I screwed up the trade window. This was all while the mole rat event thing was going on in the church next to us lol.
---
He still stuck around and gave me 2k fusion cells and a legendary armor piece, even after all of that bullshit. Honestly one of the most generous players I've ever met in any game, and I'm definitely going to pay it forward when I get to a higher level.  
---
If you're here dude, I'm sorry I didn't group with you.
---
I just want Liberty Prime to come back (and not just the power armor skin). He is the ultimate energy weapon and he will eradicate all those annoying 'liberators'.
---
It was a 5.56 gun but it could use .223 rounds.
---
Yes, it is. But that legacy alone won’t get me a fixer with 25ap effect.
---
For what just not happy with care bear story in a nuclear wasteland...just because I said it in a sarcastic manner does not make a difference
---
I just want my goddamn service rifle back bro.
---
I disagree :( maybe some but not all
---
I can’t believe nobody has mentioned this out of 92 people. The Doggy Gun from NV. K9000 of course...
---
You mean where he described the usefulness of the mutation but the op asked if the serum recipe was worth buying?
---
One thing to keep in mind - claiming a workshop in public servers opens up potential pvp. A player can come to your workshop while you are defending it from npcs and kill you. So this is a big difference from private servers since in private servers you do not have to worry about this.
---
Also, if you have not already, go to your settings and turn on 'pacifist' mode. This makes it so that you do not flag yourself for pvp if you accidently attack another player using Area of effect abilities such as grenades or explosive weapons.
---
I want bosses like Behemoth and  Swan from Fo4
---
Get it. I made some good money farming Marsupial Serums to sell.
---
I wait patiently until they're done. Sometimes you need to think before you drop tons of caps on something. It's all good my brothers!
---
And he said yes. He said yes then proceeded to explain the benefits of the mutation. Sure, he could have done a better job of explaining why the recipe was worthwhile...
---
I personally don’t think you’re ready to buy the serum recipe until you can reliably farm stable fluxes and Ultracite.
---
It was definitely OP but made nuking worth the hassle. Heaps of legendaries, tons of xp plus all the scrap. It was an immense amount of ghouls for a lvl 45-50 which is what I and my friends were at. So much fun and made us all re-evaluate our builds to survive. Real teamwork and felt rewarding for us because it granted a challenge. 
---
Even once we outlevelled it, it was still fun to wade into a sea of ghouls with a PA melee build. No bloodied or anything. Just an honest tanky melee build with the All Rise.
---
Last time I played (a year ago?)  it was maybe a dozen glowing ones that give f-all xp and barely any legendaries. Just not worth the effort to nuke.
---
My gt is monk3ytrain
---
Well good luck and please say you’re using a courier?
---
The op doesn't imply anywhere in their post that they don't know what the mutation does. They ask if buying the recipe for the muation serum is worth it, which we can assume they mean vs just buying the seum itself based off of the entire post.
---
Alright cool on my way :)
---
Now that u mentioned it. I probably will. Thank you, I almost completely forgot about that.
---
I’m the same way man. I get high anxiety when people start sending me team invites/party invites, etc. And I always feel bad about it afterward.
---
There’s another sub that unmentionable here because of reasons.  Go check it out and they have trusted couriers there as I understand it.
---
He did a shit job of explaining why it’s worth it. In fact, you’re probably right. You could say he didn’t explain shit about the recipe.
---
I just want to see Abbie back in the game as an NPC.
---
B2525 Fixer Master Race
---
As long as that balance pass includes cutting the weight of everything in the game by at least half then Im all for it.
---
This is not visual. My BE laser has been doing it and so has my Tesla rifle. It’s cost me entire fights because I lost the tactical height advantage,
---
It's crashed on me 4x now trying to complete it.
---
Here here
---
Apparently can't trade them lol
---
I finally got 1. Thought it was treated like a regular one and hit scrap all by instinct assuming it would be fine... it wasnt. My year long sesr h went directly down the toilet lol. So yeah if ya ever get a dupe hook a brother up please :)
---
I’m not following correctly. Are u saying there’s to many types of armour and pieces for the engine to display without losing performance?  If that’s the case. Why can I put armour/outfits on the space lady?
---
I wish you could expel cores from PA and Gatling lasers so they act like grenades 😂
---
I have a good one but it’s the same rolls as my handmade and I just don’t see the point lol. The rilfeman class guns have equals..
---
The hunting rifle chambered with 50 does the same as a lever with hardened.
---
Maybe to equal it out they could drop the fire rate of the 308 receiver so it doesn’t quite out class a handmade on dps.
---
The Outer Worlds has more or less sunk their reputation.   
---
Rightfully so, I thought it was awful.
---
I found a player vendor selling the marsupial serum for 1200 caps. Had multiple of each serum actually.   
---
But on topic, I could never, ever go back to playing this game without marsupial.
---
And this terminal has been used, sell me a bullet for 2k lol
---
Is this the update with the Battle pass?
---
That’s exactly what I want though, it’s about time the handmade wasn’t the best commando weapon anymore.
---
If we are talking about general weapon damage inconsistencies, why is it that I can body a 65 charred with a 118dmg pump at spitting distance, with VATS, and it still takes 3/4 of the tube to finish them off? It’s not even worth having a shotgun at that point.
---
I would agree. Have you seen the data mine atomic shop skin? 
---
It makes the AR look like a more modern AR 15/M16 I’m pretty stoked. 
---
Just give us the .308 revivers TODD!!!
---
You kidding? Outer worlds was great, a little shallow which is understandable  it's game 1. But you could see the whole universe they had there.
---
I thought that was for the handmade, not the AR
---
How do I do this? I am having the same issue
---
I definitely will! I kicked myself for not taking any this morning but I was in a bit of a rush.
---
This
---
Oh no. I hope not I thought I saw on jucie heads video it was the AR. 
---
That would suck because I traded away a god rolled QE LVC double barrel for one thinking I’d be able to put that skin on it.
---
That would be great.  She got trapped somewhere, etc.
---
Who knows the actual reason (though my guess is to earn more revenue from Atomic Shop cosmetics and they don't need to code anything new). 
---
However, you can have exactly 1 companion active at a time. I don't think people would be happy with exactly 1 PA/armour stand.
---
Are you hiding a can of tuna in your inventory? The mothman can smell tuna from miles away...
---
I have a BEFMSWA assault rifle that’s sitting in my stash box doing absolutely fuck all because I’m sitting here with a BE laser and I gave my BE50 handmade to my grandad. Got him hooked on commando lol
---
I aspire to be as cool as a dude/dad as u
---
Rifles, at least.
---
You can try and hop around to places around the map with the hopes of coming across a settler random encounter.
---
Do you know where these encounters are?
---
I heard a lot about the well from the Settlers.
---
Always carry at least 3 in case you make a mistake. I’ve got about 15 if you need any on Xbox
---
Hit places like Slocum's Joe, Marigold Pavilion and Assault Random Encounters and help the Settlers defend against different mobs, then talk to them and you will get a little rep bump. You can hop them till you hit ally! Here's a great [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ycZJzw_TU) for it!
---
Got to the NAR Repair Yard southeast of Watoga and keep server hopping, it spawns a random event almost every time and some will be settlers, defend them then talk to the leader to gain a little bit of rep at a time
---
Energy weapon perk that helps ignore energy resist would be a nice help.
---
I'd respec for melee if they added the Protonic Inversal Axe.
---
Normally they are little kids that get bullied at school. Maybe this is there way to get even idk
---
No one?
---
Well technically it does make you stronger. I call +15 strength a significant increase...
---
&gt;Behemoth
---
They're in the game though...
---
I had run from hillfolk hotdogs down to kanawha county cemetery then server hop. there are a few spawn points
---
Proud papa prepares his child for the future!
---
How?
---
They're all over the place on the map. Even if I knew where specifically, you'd have to hop around cause they're random.
---
The only one I'm definitely away of is at Slocum Joe's but there are a bunch of others. Quite a few but it'll take some effort to get them because of that randomness.
---
That a minority really and if end game is bloodied builds then they need to change it
---
Did you happen to stay on a world where your server couldn't be placed? That can cause that issue.
---
Your grandad sounds like a bad ass lol. Yeah I went and traded for a BE15 crits so it would match my handmade. 
---
I gotta make sure about that skin because if not that’s gonna really eat ass my dude. 
---
The BE laser is literally the most op rilfeman/commando gun isn’t it? I can floor the imposter in under 36 shot with it on my rilfeman. It’s like a crazy accurate laser shotgun or something. 
---
 
---
I maybe one of the weird exceptions that uses my BE15 handmade as a sniper on a rilfeman.
---
Yeah but it's never done this before I do that all time. But thanks for letting me know this can happen I won't do it from now on too much hassle.
---
i have been killed for no reason 1 time. but it was when i had taken over a workshop, and now i know thats a flag that says i want to fight. but i wouldn't call it griefing
---
Technically the 3* fixer could be considered a four-star since it has an additional sneak bonus.
---
I mostly use it for PvP but a level 60 3* Sentry Bot MkII goes down in less than three seconds.
---
Doesn't happen all the time. But when it does, you know it. So frustrating.
---
I'm pretty sure the percentage being displayed is incorrect. An RNG auto target system like this should miss a reasonable amount of times... But the number being displayed is a broken clock.
---
I just started using the shishkabob sword to heal the brahmin to help out even more. I love joining on random events to help out lower level characters too!
---
&gt; We're almost all familiar with missing 95% chance to hit shots (which should be automatic barring an obstruction). 
---
Someone isn't good with maths...
---
You still have a 5% chance to hit. That's 1 in 20 shots you miss on average.
---
There are legitimate problems with VATS, don't get me wrong, though it tends to have more to do with vats not remaining locked than missing shots.
---
It wouldn't be a Bethesda product if it didn't have bugs that actively try to tear the game apart.
---
I've done the hopping around, but getting the bump for helping sends hit and miss for me... :/
---

Master List with Spawns
---
yes, but you need two perks to keep it active and worth it. one is class freak, and the other starched genes. both are in LUCK.
---
Then in the mean time it hardly tickles the queen.
---
When I first got it I was hella mad because that’s how I tested it out. Thinking I just wasted 40k I stashed it for like two weeks before I tested it out on mobs and saw it’s really one of my favorite weapons.
---
It's hella grindy but if you're close, it's worth hopping around to end it. Then, on to a whole different grind....yay.
---
you can still open the fireplace to the wall? lol at least that's how it works with regular doors xd
---
Logging out and back in will make the enemies respawn.  The plants are on some kind of timer, not sure exactly how it works.  You can log out and back in on a public server as well, just note a few of the players in the world when you quit and then rejoin one of them through recently played with.  Doesn't always work, but pretty good odds.
---
New weapons aren’t going to be encouraged with that attitude.  If someone is complaining that they would have to put in work to get a new weapon to a place they want it then that is detrimental to the longevity of  the game, regarding new content.
---
I agree on the fact the game is in such a bad grindy place right now with rep and modules/scrip it would be hard to get a godroll for a new weapon.  But your mindset encourages monetization of possible new content instead of adding it for free.  
---
I would have liked to see Service Rifles in the loot pool myself or as a new plan over something I would have to pay for.  It’s completely worth the grind in my opinion and adds variety to things.  If you don’t want it you don’t have to have it, but for the people who like it they can get it for free.
---
Exactly!
---
I made a post about this a while ago.  I think it’s a great idea but the way Bethesda is treating separate weapons now makes me think this isn’t going to happen.
---
It may be all of the above, but also quarantine depression. Isolation even affects us stay at home gamers. You should also just try something different. If you're on Xbox, try out some games in the Game Pass library. Look at your free games you've collected on PlayStation. Peruse some free to play games. Have any games you haven't completed or bought on sale and forgot about? Try those. Rummage through your closet and grab out an old system of you have one. Play some games before they got so advanced that bugs always happen. Play games before microtransactions or patch after launch business models existed. There are a lot of games to play. You could even try different activities like audio books or hell, fucking drawing. If your usual distraction isn't working for you. Do literally anything else.
---
The game really doesn’t need more weapons anyway.
---
Multiple people disagree with you.
---
that happen to me in the encrypted event lmao he explodes and kill me xd
---
Well then, I didnt know this was a thing. lmao
---
You're my hero ❤️
---
I love how my peaceful first comment on this post got 7+ downvotes. I was just looking for more people to pvp with. It’s funny how people say the pvpers are toxic. I don’t go downvote pve suggestions like a little bitch🤔
---
dunno me and my friends never opened bethesda launcher anymore since wastelanders lol fk that and the pts
---
It's exactly what causes it. When you die over encumbered you're supposed to respawn at the vault. The bug happens when you lose your bonuses either from your backpack and/or Unyielding after you die. Since your strength drops it can make you encumbered and force you to spawn at the vault. It's doesn't always happen... People on the PTS say it appears to be fixed in the next patch though.
---
My camp is near the vault too, I always drop something for anyone coming out who’s visiting my base. It makes me so sad when they’re scared of me though since I’m level 70+, I’ll drop a paper bag and point at it with my gun and they’ll start running thinking I’m trying to grief. 
---
It sucks, I save all my low level legendaries for them. I look like a maniac running after them “Please, take my level 5 explosive 10mm!” Lol
---
Wat
---
You must stay on the computer and prevent others from hitting the button while you wait
---
It's worse than a hand pump. Gives you dirty water and takes twice as long. Looks cool though.
---
You have done well my young padawan
---
Where do you get that outfit in the first photo?
---
I made sure to get the base plans for all weapons and SS armor before messing with other stuff. That way there is a chance of them dropping from purveyor or companion quests. As for other stuff the chemist backpack is awesome, the floor tiles for planting are great, solar armor is also great for a full health build otherwise secret service is better.
---
Never said I heard good things.. :p
---
?
---
This. Buy the serum itself from other players for 2-500 caps. Then when you get to the point where caps are meaningless and you need to burn some, buy the plan and you will be able to have a steady flow of caps from then on.
---
Patch 20 notes includes deep pocketed for the other pieces
---
That's actually really sweet of that player! I too was confused when I first started playing seeing all these high level people walking around at minimal health.
---
You'll be pleased to know there's one on the porch of a dilapidated house at Becker Farm. I just got one the first time I checked there.
---

---
I would be wary before just fully accepting that. Sometimes I'll go a day or so without seeing it. I can't find any rhyme or reason for why it starts up again.
---
PvP was an abomination from the start, better to just put it down, maybe jettison some sweats
---
Very well put, thank you, and agree 100%.
---
Except that exploit was patched.
---
Just be careful of floors and stairs my friend / they can be unsafe i cMe out with a torn jacket and some cuts and what not
---
Weird. Cause I rolled 14 times for the left leg (my final piece) and for 2 Vanguard rolls and 8 trash... and I’m a bloody build
---
It’s probably just another thing to fix 69 times to stop
---
More duping lol
---
I did the same thing, it was early on this character so I hadn't bothered building anything but a couple platforms. I found someone on my bed and built a 1x1 box around them (with a door, I wasn't trying to trap them) and just filled that box up with Mr. Pebbles stuff. 
---
Then I waited. I wanted to be there when he came back. He had no mic, but kinda jerked the camera around and tossed up a heart and thumbs up.
---
A true scavver. I applaud you're ingenuity.
---
That was only in New Vegas though, the original could only use .223.
---
I’ve run into a flatwoods monster twice this week. Hadn’t seen him in almost 2000 hours until this week
---
I’m sorry to tell you this but you did most of the game, not much left
---
200? Man, they saw me coming! Ha. I seriously saw some for 2000-3000. 600 was seriously the lowest I saw after checking vendors for a few days. Are you PS4?
---
If you give away all your legendary weapons and armour and only use what can be crafted you will have the exact challenge you crave.
---
the tesla cannon is memey as fuck, lol
---
Oooh. Ok.
---
how did you emote a silver bicep..?
---
Awww, I'm PS4. Maybe one day they'll let us cross platforms.
---
Totally understand!
---
Scrapping animated cards to get perk coins is such a counter-intuitive game design move. They design a thing that is pretty and is intended to be a collectible; and then we are encouraged to scrap it.
---
So nuke MorganTown for fluids and masses? I’ve been looking for a good place to farm those.. thanks!
---
Had a moron do that with an explosisive laser rifle. He killed his dumb self and I took his junk.
---
So they wont drop as loot/purveyor atall if i dont buy them first? Had no idea about that. Hats off and thanks kindly sir!
---
Has patch 20 already happens?
---
I got mine for 100
---
Anyone else want a set of zig-zag linoleum floor tiles like the Black Lodge in Twin Peaks?
---
Yeah you have to have the plans like with the fixee. They don't drop from regular loot though. So far only the purveyor, the companion daily and Fasnacht have dropped them.
---
Yes but make sure you’ve got a friend so you can leave and keep re spawning the ghouls.
---
Otherwise if I’m alone I like nuking a fissure and killing the scorched they seem to re spawn every five or ten minutes without leaving the server. 
---
Good farming man.
---
What is a score reward?
---
Level 360, I put my shish on the favorite wheel for Fasnacht and haven't taken it off.  Friendly Fire is awesome for a bunch of events.  Rad Rumble, Riding Shotgun, Project Paradise, Free Range for sure.  Haven't tried it on Beanstalk.
---
I needed caps and I was gonna sell my tse gauss rifle, but then a guy named Archswifter on xbox told me not to sell that gun because it was rare and then he joined my world and gave me 600 presents for free. We need more generous players like him to help, especially when your broke like me. :D
---
i have no idea how they would make this happen but it would be cool if you could get the wild wasteland perk and see how it would interact with this game
---
And you’re still here.        
---
Did you ejaculate while writing that?
---
Not before the major balance rework.
---
Energy weapons are dogshit since BETA. Implementing a bunch of 'new' old Fallout energy weapons would either mean they are all also dogshit like every other energy weapon - or there'd be one that stands out and is clearly superior. Kinda like the Gauss Minigun (it's really just a heavy bolter, death to the false emperor)
---
I am so glad I cannot be contacted that way.
---
Definitely not how it works, ive gone a full month of the bastard telling me to "StOp By NeXt WeEk, IlL hAvE mOrE gOlD tHeN"
---
Well, there’s supposedly one in the works, so here’s hoping.
---
I just rolled an AA combat rifle at the Rusty Pick a couple of days ago.  Converted to .38 ammo, it makes for a lovely little sniper for ferals and scorched and such so I don't have to waste my precious .50 shells.  If only I could learn the suppressor plans for it I would be in heaven.
---
Is the porn at least fallout themed
---
That's what I have done several times so far. I fast travel to Vault 76, crap out the items, and then hop on the transferee.
---
It has worked for me every time so far.
---
Serums recipe are cap sink. Eventually you will have so much caps you want to buy random stuff that you will never use.
---
However if you are in the early game and are short of caps, I suggest just buying the serum from player's vendor, usually around 400-800 caps.
---
Nice! I'll try it next build, thanks.
---
Division 2 had a bug where it auto completed the battle pass. Devs fixed it and let the people keep the rewards because it was the devs fault since they didn’t fix the bug.
---
Bethesda would just ban you. Then fix the bug maybe a year later.
---
Good news. Thank you.
---
I, a level 102 started Encryptid and waited for a couple people to show up. A couple level 100-250s showed but only like 2-3... then a 27, 13, and 3 showed up. Naturally the 27 ran to the computer and started it... luckily we got the event completed!!
---
Are you on PS4? I have an AA/50L combat rifle you could have if you'd like. 2 star. It dropped for me fairly recently, so yes they definitely still drop.
---
Really? I never heard about it. Then again I haven't had to do it since so I really wouldnt know
---
Last one in with: love this community. ❤️
---
Thank youuuu! I definitely need to do this!
---
I didnt make this. But I saved it to my drive. It seems very accurate. 
---
[cost allocation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9XoDmKIIXGsBV7IzPtHwZzlWDQQv9n9VKva_QW8Kss/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
Oh believe me I have it too, it's probably one of favorite firearms irl too
---
Yeah. I have seen like 3-4 since launch of the game. They are quite rare. And weak
---
Eventually, yes, absolutely. But I would much prefer the current roster if weapons getting a total balance pass and rework so that many more of them become viable to use.
---
Yeah, I’m paranoid about doing this, so I just hang around until someone else starts it.
---
When is Patch 20 releasing?
---
Thank goodness they fixed that perk card mouse issue so I don't have to reach aaallllll the way over to my arrow keys.
---
If it wasn't for the fact my parents let me play Mortal Kombat when I was 11, I would have lived a rich, full life as a productive citizen. Instead, I'm sitting in a maximum security prison for leg sweeping a man to death.
---
How dare you?!?!!!!!11
---
The heavy incinerator needs to come back.
---
The arc and range on that thing was so much fun to use and learn.
---
I'd also like to see the fallout 3 gauss rifle come back as a thing of its own
---
Oh darn ty
---
They do so many things great. Absolutely fantastic. And I have rarely had an issue with the players (few trap bases, lost some junk, who cares.) But the game is really lacking in some aspects, mostly to do with multiplayer.
---
But we push on, fingers crossed.
---
If it puts it into perspective, there are a range of Civil War re-enactment clothing items in the game. Not only confederate.
---
Theoretically, these wouldve been salvaged from museums, displays, memorials, etc and repurposed/sold. I could understand if they'd *only* implemented the confederate uniform, but that isn't the case.
---
This is exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for, thank you!
---
Sorry for being a stealth build that does more damage when hidden so you’re almost always crouched
---
Abandoned Bog Town has one pretty much constantly, unless somebody else killed it. As far as difficulty, the whole game is getting a balance pass this year so... We'll see.
---
I had a rad dude build me a sick mini gun early on, a real homie that guy.
---
It’s just a reference to the civil war. Is it really a big deal?
---
Can’t wait to try the Meowscles outfit
---
Awesome trick! Thanks!
---
Same here lol. 
---
Just what some of these peops have been doing is suspect.
---
No like I was asking if it was
---
I did because I don't like always using it, so I just pop some when the situation arises and you don't experience the negative effects for 1 hour. Plus they sell for 500 at a vendor bot so they are good for clearing out those caps.
---
West Virginia exists because during the Civil War, a group of people in that area didn’t believe in what Virginia was supporting, so they broke off and formed their own state. The Civil War was fought there, and there’s an location in game where re-enactments took place. It’s a costume, or at the very most a museum piece that was taken from a glass case. Chill bro.
---
I bloody well hope so. They have overpowered Assaultrons, weak ass deathclaws. Nigh Indestructible mirelurk queens. A broken scorchbeast queen and a windigo colussus that spawns once in a blue moon. And gets stuck on terrain
---
They are wrong. I had 1 badge left for both tadpole and possum for many months, but I still earned extras. I've bought every blueprint from both machines and only finished possum last week. Tadpole wasn't working the last time I launched a nuke, also months ago, or I'd have it completed too. Might be fixed with Wastelanders.
---
I am only able to play 2 or 3 times a week... this is going to take a while...
---
Same,the moment I spawned out of Vault.. just ran into a random direction adn started exploring.  
---
Explored like half othe map,the forest,toxic valley and ash heap
---
No, you're an analrapist.
---
Do a search for flamingo units and you'll find what you're looking for
---
I likely killed someone when my client crashed randomly today. My base is over a cliff, I normally try to disable my vendors before I leave but obviously I had no control here. Poor guy was just checking out my stimpacks when the game decided it didn't want to live anymore. I'm sorry.
---
Makes total sense.  Try something totally different for a break.  Lots of free or demo games to try out.
---
Shit this how I be feeling. Playing 76 feels like a chore now
---
Union and confederate uniforms can be found in civil war museums along with civil war suits and dresses. The union uniform has a hat, but it's hard to find. They've been in the game since release. I made a post over a year ago asking if it was acceptable for one of my characters to wear one, role-playing as a future person who didn't know what it was. A player must've sold it to the Vendortron.
---
0/10 you are awarded no point for your submission, please hand in your assignment again at a later date, this time don't chew on the staples and make sure your name is legible.
---
That explains a lot in my life😂😂
---
Yes! I have 6 different power armor with all different paint
---
Implementing the Wattz lasers as end-game weapons would come off a bit silly, since the current laser pistol/rifle is a military design and the FO1/2 weapons were civilian models. They even look very civilian when compared to the FO3/4 guns. I don't think it's ever stated either way for the Glock 86 "Defender," and plasma weapons are on the cutting edge, regardless.
---
That said, I do still want them back. In addition to energy weapons needing love in general, the game seriously needs more variety in weapons/mods and a balance pass to make them all viable in different ways. Picking a gun and its configuration should be as much a part of a build as picking stats and perks.
---
Cool bait
---
(Wolfenstein players slowly back out of the room)
---
Seems like a day for it. Had two of those weird encounters today. Two level 300+. One wanted and the other close by, crouched trying to bait at my camp. Noped out of there. Not even ten minutes later on another server my power goes out and I have no idea how but here’s a guy over 500 just spraying me, probably to bait me again. Hopped away. Not sure how they got my generator down, but quick repair.
---
Happened to me once. Not sure what was the reason, but I never stayed on a world I can't place my C.A.M.P. ( which is rather rare, as place is somewhat unpopular ).
---
Nope... was working on my new character yesterday
---
What the hell is wrong with you?
---
It's people like you that ruin shit for everyone else, especially for people who fight for reason social justice causes.
---
Not that racism isn't one of those things, of course. However, it's such a tiny and petty thing to fight over. 
---
There's no monument that I'm aware of that celebrates confederate personalities. The one monument they have is of a union soldier.
---
There's no depiction of the confederacy that I can think of that is glorified in the game.
---
Heck, you have a better case against the existence of slave collars in the game but, once again before you jump you oh so eager gun on this one, it's not depicted in a positive light.
---
Your reward is FORFEIT!!
---
Don’t think it’s available yet. However I won’t be surprised if it comes with a later update if they expand the Blood Eagles more or just through one of the rewards in Seasons
---
I recently stopped playing fallout 76 even though Bethesda charged me for another month of fallout first. I miss the game but it needs to be cleaned up I’m tired of playing such a buggy game all the time
---
Yeah I've read conflicting accounts on the badges and always believed they could drop regardless. But with my RNG I never got one. Thanks for your input mate :)
---
Happy cake day for yesterday
---
Exactly. Like, those collars are literally made to turn prisoner’s heads into confetti if they tried escaping jail.
---
This is my build [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3558c8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sg2s01st0pe2ek1eh1c72cu0ip2l71lt2ic4a04a80a72a12e00lg2&amp;w=ls2pa0p80p90p30ln0p40sb2sa2sv2sx2e11e41e60em1ee2c62c52ck0cf2cr0i30ia0i50i12i44ij2i61if2s12iq2ie2ih2ir2ig2id2s72ag2at1au2l92l62l02lb2l22le2lu2lm2s22&amp;m=fc63ae&amp;wp=w7w7&amp;wm=172538-1l2538&amp;n=DVW%20%20heavy%20weapons%202.0](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3558c8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sg2s01st0pe2ek1eh1c72cu0ip2l71lt2ic4a04a80a72a12e00lg2&amp;w=ls2pa0p80p90p30ln0p40sb2sa2sv2sx2e11e41e60em1ee2c62c52ck0cf2cr0i30ia0i50i12i44ij2i61if2s12iq2ie2ih2ir2ig2id2s72ag2at1au2l92l62l02lb2l22le2lu2lm2s22&amp;m=fc63ae&amp;wp=w7w7&amp;wm=172538-1l2538&amp;n=DVW%20%20heavy%20weapons%202.0)   
---
I'm not using bloodied because the RNG keeps me giving vampire heavy weapons my dmg may be less then a blood build but I can tank anything when Im using my Vamp LMG and my Vamp minigun
---
Reminder that all Confederate soldiers were pardoned after the war and re-integrated into the U.S. military. 
---
They are American soldiers and deserve respect. THEY WERE ALSO DEMOCRATS. joe bidens great grandfather owned slaves and fought for the Confederates in the Civil War.
---
just stay on the computer, then no one else can start the event
---
Well said.
---
Nice 👍🏻
---
I think it's weird it wasn't available with the faction introduction, but you're probably right.
---
Not really anymore especially now that playstations back end is on microsofts azure cloud just like pc nintendo and Xbox is now. That's why so many games are becoming completely cross platform.
---
Whoa you mean the thing that has been recently happening where I see a bunch of crap on the ground after I killed some mole miners, like gauntlet and glowing meat, sometimes it can be a legendary on the ground that someone else didn’t pick up? I just figured it was my loot somehow. Neat
---
That's probably the last plan I need for all the vanilla building elements.  nice!
---
i just have my luck on 15 and i eat melons for breakfast
---
It's very powerful, but immersion breaking in my opinion. I understand that mmos aren't very immersive, but consider that you might find it annoying doing a super jump every time you jump
---
If I remember, in her last message she was going to Top of the World. No body (from what I know) and no news from Rose, so she might really well be somewhere.
---
Do the quest “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and you get “the fixer” which is an awesome combat rifle, already suppressed and with nice bonuses.
---
Is there anything more to it than the paint job? I know it has Blood Eagle paint on it, but it otherwise just looked like standard Raider PA to me.
---
Sad thing is. Once you have no griefers the gather rates at workshops is so abyssmal- is not even worth it unless your just getting started.
---
Some guy tried to pull the paper bag with too many presents in it trick on me. I didnt even bother
---
Maybe we should ban images of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson.  They were both slave owners.  Get that image off of Mount Rushmore ASAP.
---
Meanwhile, my great grandfather, who had no slaves and did not even support slavery was drafted, fought bravely in the confederate uniform defending his home state because he felt that it was the right thing to do, and was killed.  Yet the uniform he wore should be erased from history and even video games portraying them in a historical sense.
---
Yesterday a guy came into my camp and undressed down to his undies, crouched down then put his face in my crotch as close as possible so it appeared he was... well you get the picture.  No matter where I went he kept doing the same thing.   I'm pretty sure he was trying annoy me into PVP but I just decided to change servers instead.
---
I second. Ferrry Harper seemed a little incomplete, story-wise, for such a big settlement and rebuild project.
---
Wait- people can steal from the vendors?? I thought they were just trying to shop unnoticed.
---
Honestly, these are the people that keep me playing this game. I never used to play online games (not by choice, by cost of PS+) after playing the horror that is GTA ONLINE for a few month, I was relieved to see that this community is mostly united. GTA online may be a better quality game, but the player base of this game has actually given me better experiences.
---
I had an experience at a low level where someone came up to me and dropped some stimpaks, water and radaway. It was a small gesture but I have been trying to pay it forward, whether it's helping low levels get away from griefers, giving water and supplies or just helping them with quests.
---
😂 was hoping someone got the reference.
---
Lmao
---
What a beautiful house!
---
I bought a bloodied 33% vats for 3000 the other day which was the lower end of it value, if you've got the caps and time vendor hopping will pay out eventually. If you're after one star you're going to have more luck with lower level players from what I've seen, especially since AA is useless.
---
Yeah, that’s just my theory. I could totally be wrong through and you can somehow get it. I just dot know.
---
My buddy’s graphics card does this to his face sometimes, looks like peanut butter Spock face for like a half hour then goes back to normal.
---
I’ve seen so many people use the “Democrats were slave owners” argument, and I’m so tired of explaining it. [this video](https://youtu.be/s8VOM8ET1WU) should explain it
---
Right now it's just standard Blood Eagle paint and I want it because I think it looks cool. But that's just me being me.
---
Within game play Blood Eagle power armor pieces could be legendary junkie pieces to fit with their theme.
---
It's just something I was curious about but it could be something fun overall.
---
I typically hang out around the overseers camp and build new players a set of armor, full marine wetsuit, and a weapon to help get them started. It may not have been as much as that guy but I try my best to make sure everyone gets a starting kit .But I wish I’d meet someone like that, I never got any presents during the Christmas event since I wasn’t able to be there
---
If you have the space save them, i was a full health build for ages and then went to Unyielding Bloodied build and fell in love with it. You'll be kicking yourself later for scrapping them if you try this build. Took me about 5 weeks to build a half decent Unyielding set
---
A lot of people are saying it's linked to accounts who may have taken advantage of an old camp budget bug. 
---
Then some are saying they are lagging to gain access? 
---
It seems something shonky is happening again.
---
Hotbar wheel and Y
---
LOL
---
Exactly, I got rid of all my doors for this reason. Also I want my rad shower on all the time but these water conservationists keep turning it off
---
Shit! I hath been caught!
---
Atom seems to be used by the church that was founded in Megaton in  FO3 as a way to explain how a few people express a natural radiation immunity, and sometimes also as an excuse to fetishize the destructive forces of radiation upon the world that others cannot endure: when Sister Gwenyth found a science text and began to learn about the scientific theories of atoms and of atomic forces (Far Harbor) her faith began to unravel
---
The Interloper has artifacts and magical items left around America from times well before the bombs (the statue heads, Kremvh's Tooth), there are a number of strange sleeping bodies in caves and mines Appalachia that might belong to them, and their worshipers seem to be called to worship rather than finding the light/the glow for themselves. Worshipers of the Interloper and Mothman Cultists also seem to be as badly effected by radiation as their fellow survivors are, or at least they don't go out of their way to enjoy the glow like members of the Church of Atom seem to
---
They might be connected but it could take a Mothman-themed DLC to find out for sure
---
Thanks! It's been my permanent CAMP since early 2019. I'm planning on recording a video tour soon, but there's a few small changes I still want to make first.
---
if you "rebuilt the database" and updated the system software from root menu (shutting off ps4, holding power button till it beeps twice) you have done everything you can on your end. initializing or else wont do anything but delete your data.
---
i hope it just starts working again by itself, as it seems to do for most. i had this error several times in the past, lasting from a few hours up to 3-4 days before it started working again.
---
Obviously it was your choice, but I think you really shouldn't have sold the gun, could have traded it for something you'd actually use. It isn't available as a drop anymore, you'd have to trade for it if you wanted it again. As for calling you a food build, to my understanding it's a PvE player that uses perks for mostly food and drink weight reduction, and restoration for hunger and thirst. I might be wrong. I find it and care bear kind of toxic though.
---
Looks a lot like the terrain around Foundation.
---
Yeah the post is joking that if you happen to log into NW post patch 20, you will end up having the entire board complete but no rewards.
---
Thank you matey cheers :)
---
Definitely worth it - also definitely shouldn't pay more than 500 for it. If you are on Xbox, I can cut you a deal on mine.
---
Looking forward to it!
---
Thought the same, surely it must have been patched since April? Nope
---
Oh damn didn't know that. I thought it could just have the explosive effect life any other weapon outside of legacies.
---
Oh look, Gorignak is sleeping.
---
If you're on xbox I can give you some presents:)
---
Washington and Jefferson were deeply flawed men in this regard, but they fought for America, not against it. But thanks for marching out another straw man argument employed by racists.
---
Yes it can be very well a legendary , which you were searching, perhaps? :D
---
Call the Brotherhood!!
---
The stairs in the background make me think it is one of the outlooks, at the top of various ridges between Grafton Steel and the Hornwright mining operations. That ridge line has a lot of overlooks with stairs like that.
---
I agree that 76 is really dark. The backstory of the many dead factions is so heartbreaking at times.
---
So in other words Bethesda left in a bug that....helps...the...play......NO THIS ISNT RIGHT YO TODD! YOU GOTTA FIX THIS you made something helpful by mistake!
---
Or Rose just doesn't say anything.  Could be Rose's programming doesn't care about other women.   Or, she is holding back information because, well, she's Rose.
---
Is it releasing this coming Tuesday?
---
THEY WERE NOT AMERICAN VETERANS! And I say that as an American veteran. The law you’re talking about was to give benefits to their shitty widows and has been misinterpreted by racist ever since.
---
Diffusers have definitely been my bane. What platform you on? I could do a PS4 version.
---
Yeah, mine had chem and food weight reduction.
---
Imma load him up with even more salisbury steaks!!
---
Their still allowed to be dropped, I just got a quad Explosive 2* one a week ago
---
I like this idea, I've been wanting survival mode back since it was removed (there's a petition someone made to bring it back if you're interested) but honestly this sounds just as good and would save Bethesda from having to support seperate servers
---
As much as I wish I was , I’m on ps4 sadly to say. But thank you for your generosity ^-^
---
My idea isn’t very data hungry either. This would be 20% the size of a usual contend update.
---
Especially with public teams already being implemented, most of the work would just be adding another team mode that enables pvp
---
Aww darn. Well I'm sure plenty are circuiting around on PS4 as well, so maybe you'll get lucky and someone else will offer:)
---
I'm not sure text chat would have saved this relationship, especially the way you seem to be stalking this dude. Super creepy if they ever came across this post.
---
Hell yeah. Fallout 3 telsa cannon was the most fun gun ever(and op). As for plasma weapons and all the other ones that they changed the textures of since fo3 or nv, pls just revert them beth.....pls
---
So much potential, in and around Harper's Ferry, and The Mire in general.
---
I write players with wall decoration letters at my camp... super simple...
---
Are you telling me in 200 hours together you two didn't devise a  way to communicate. Not bullet holes in wall, writing it in wall stickers, nothing?!?
---
Maybe it wasn't that serious and you shouldn't be complaining.
---
Incite PvP? 
---
Or incite some wastelander lovin?
---
They didn’t fight for America. Not the way you’re talking about. They fought to not be taxed by the British without having somebody to represent them in Parliament. They were 100% fine with having slaves no matter what.
---
It reminds me pleasant Hill cemetery. That location has a lot of dead for trees and stairs.
---
Floating but nice floating. more of a garage hangout after a nukashine party. Lots of stuff everywhere, clutter, nothing fancy. But Plenty of room to play music, do photo stand ins, unlocked doors and unlocked resources, fully stocked vendor machines.
---
Well I'm an idiot, time to fix up my AA combat rifle for weaker enemies. I'm pretty sure I have the silencer mod unlocked. If you're on xbox, I can make it for you
---
I’ve been trying to get this for a while, it always feels so good getting that perfect plan or weapon you’ve been wanting.
---
Yea i would have done the same so you didnt have to trade a legacy item. Since they dont drop anymore in Game you could have traded for way more than caps.
---
Exactly! I believe BGS never tried to make “Fallout with PVP” how people always wanted. Survival was awesome but unplayable. Very lonely and it cost to play(alot). PVP events should reward victories and not cost defeats, to encourage competition and self improvement.      
---
NW was giving people who wanted “Fallout with PVP” something else: Fortnite Fo76 edition. And well as you can see most player pools only exist because of the rewards. PVP community let down, and BGS didn’t win the FN players either.    
---
My idea is just plain simple good ol’ Fo76 WITH PVP.
---
Or maybe piercing? I mean hitting many things in a straight line?
---
Greeeeat.
---
It just works.
---
Grass is getting turned off and I’m going hunting!
---
It's over. 
---
You have to move on.
---
I assure you the other player has. They're probably gaming with someone else right now. Behind your back.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking...
---
There must also be a small road or parking area because of the orange car so very likely an outlook area
---
Maybe one day I’ll end up getting one or two presents, but either way there are still plenty of new players/characters trickling in that’ll need a starting kit
---
So why do you need help selling an item?
---
Bruh. For real. What’s your problem with a costume in game, when there’s actual, active racism in every Fallout? Against ghouls, mutants, and synths. People actually hate them in game, and you’re here talking about a uniform that’s over 200 years old by the time the game takes place?
---
No. They weren't surprised. More than half of their paid atom content includes CAMP skins.
---
They know exactly what they're doing. 
---
They don't care what you want.
---
They just want you to buy atoms for skins and repair kits. 
---
That's all.
---
The laser RCW would work as a receiver or barrel mod to the submachine gun, and add a lot of versatility to the weapon.
---
Umm this app in your hands even has a chat feature which I've used to broker trades etc... Not sure he wanted to be found or converse....
---
Got a junkies explosive off the queen tonight.
---
Your clearly new to Reddit
---
Have the post edited. Yes ive tried to shoot in walls. 
---
And at this Moment, i havent any letters for my camp.
---
Umm...
---
Dude, you tried this yesterday and then [deleted the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/her170/a_better_solution_for_pvp_in_adventure/). Why do you think it'd work better a second time around?
---
You really should let the "not forced into PvP" thing go. You were resoundingly beaten in the last post about this issue. You really shouldn't be spreading misinformation. 
---
That aside though, so long as whatever you propose for PvP doesn't affect or disadvantage ANYONE who doesn't want to be involved, more power to you. Just don't lie to people over and over about people not currently being forced into PvP against their will because it's still in the game to date.
---
I would love more Free States story!
---
This would make a lot of sense if you weren't already able to just drop a fully equipped power armor anywhere and any time you want to, and have it display properly.
---
As it is, all they would really need to do is make it so that it can't be picked up by someone else, and slap a display box around it.
---
It could happen:) if not, you could try again this christmas
---
i dont think that this is stalking.
---
ingame he invites me every day, he tried to help me with stuff, quests and items. every day.
---
i would write him only a "thank you". dont want to merry him.
---
Funny because you stopped replying when I asked if PVP was 100% optional would you stop others playing. I deleted yesterdays post when I created this new one.    
---
         
---
Well this post has new rules:       
---
You can only criticise the idea: IF YOU EXPLAIN WHY.
---
I ha e the same problem with assault rifles
---
Yeah, I could, but I don't want any of those.
---
The link is right there to look at my response dude. I said we were done there and left it.
---
You didn't think to have an alternate form of contact after 200hrs?
---
Seriously.  You like playing with them. You don't exchange any kind of contact and now your upset?!?
---
You had 200 hrs to get an email, I'm, snap, discord, anything.
---
Aye, sometimes I meet them at my camp. I am aware, I keep my best items in my inventory, but I always wait until they get bored and leave.
---
dont think so, because i can see, that his level 280 char isnt online.
---
This is a you problem not a game problem
---
Still waiting on an answer for:      
---
     
---
If PVP was 100% optional would you not let others use PVP?
---
&gt;I have tried to google his name in vain. I have searched for him on Steam, Microsoft-friends, Beth-forums, reddit and a german Fallout-website called vault76, but no success.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;So now I have no choice but to check every day if my buddy, with whom I spent over 200 hours of fun, is online again.
---
Yeah, that's not creepy at all...
---
You dont understand the Problem. How do i get his contact-data?
---
Fortnite Fo76 edition killed me lmao that's exactly what it is, I'm not a fan of battle Royale games anyway so all I do is bush camp, especially since you get way more XP for just surviving than getting kills
---
On the other hand PvP in the actual game is great because you have all kinds of terrain still, options for surprise attacks and stuff, as well as the perks, mutations etc that you're used to
---
Something that I hate with a passion that ignites my tattered soul is:
---
If a player is wanted and I go to hunt them down, vats does no damage until after I shoot them out of vats
---
That makes sense if neither player is wanted, but not when there's some wanted troll bouncing around with marsupial and jetpack trolling low level players (my most recent experience with bounty hunting)
---
In that scenario I should be able to lock on and put them down
---
Ahh.... 
---
You didn't read my comment to your post here, did you?
---
That’s the plan if I can’t, too bad that it’s 6 months out tho lol. But at least by then we’ll hopefully have plenty more content
---
You HAD 200 hours too late now.
---
dont know, how do you find friends in rl. if anyone who contact you, you think hes creepy.
---
The Mire seems not fully exploited by the game at the moment and could be home of some future expansion, hopefully.
---
Happens with my handmade sometimes. It doesn't shake like you described, but it locks up just the same, in first person it'll look like he's holding it up angled across his chest sort of.
---
Also, I did a google search on other PVP suggestions. Literally saw a rant in the comments with your user name on many of them!     
---
      
---
Whatever the fuck your mission is, you’re very persistent.
---
correct, its my problem caused by a non-existent chat in the game.
---
I still look at the difference between the ammo machine, and the well.
---
These two things aren't even remotely in the same level of usefulness. I'd argue as 'settlers' a hybrid craft table (Craftsman's Bench etc) featuring guns/armor/tinker wouldn't have broken the lore or settler image and allowed a good reduction in camp budget and build room taken for something so serviceable yet not game breaking.
---
I’m assuming separate interior and exterior budget as it’s “instanced camp interior” we’re getting.
---
Yeah man I can do that. Pm me your ign?
---
I don't want to contact everyone I meet
---
Haha that's true. Good luck coming across someone in the meantime though^_^
---
Umm.. wait to see if they pop up on the friend's list, which I might check periodically, not like multiple times a day or even every day.
---
The only reason I would put anywhere near that much effort to get in contact with someone is to tell them that a family member has died. Aside from that, shit can wait.
---
The fact that you don't see your actions as stalkerish and creepy bothers me somewhat.
---
I figured it was , since it's under "Main" in the pip boy.
---
On a PS4, there isnt that problem.
---
That's one reason i installed text chat mod, allows my friends and i to communicate easier when we don't feel like using voice chat. Also since text chat shows other text chat users name as blue if you are near, I usually find several people with and start more conversations because i prefer typing more than vc so another reason i installed it
---
Yes only things not coming with the update is legendary perks system and the new colosuss event as far as i know the battle pass is coming still
---
good point about green thumb, will use next time.
---
Wow. I just feel sad for you now. I only noticed you posted the shame shit twice because it was literally the day after. Couldn't care less if you posted this multiple times in the past. Not that obsessed in looking up your past history.
---
Oh, i wasnt aware. Of course i know his vids. Especially the ones about magic weapons. But i just knew of the ones with firerate. Also i thought there has been a fix for those already. I gotta check that out with shotguns. Cause i do have a Bloodied limp dmg gauss laying around.
---
this post only for saying: i want a fucking text-chat ingame. not to find the person here. my story should be an example, why i need a text chat.
---
i play 8-10 hours daily, i look once a day if he is online. if he is in future, cool. i not, okay.
---
No but I’ll complain at the doing it, and then being a bitch doing no damage, dying all the time, and not even trying to help with pylons. You didn’t spend the caps for the card keep your ass out of the computer.
---
Ctitical hits...are they bugged ? I dont see any bigger numbers despite every 3 or 4 th shot beeing a crit ?
---
If you're using the camp budget exploit to expand your camp budget, then yeah
---
have read about the text-chat mod. but im a little bit scared, what beth does, if they detect that i have mods. there is no official position name from bethesda about whether they support mods, is there?
---
Let's say you played 5hrs a day together, that's 20 days of you NOT getting their info via any means possible. 
---
And them not trying either.
---
Seriously. Almost 3 weeks of 2 strangers who rolled around killing shit.
---
Did you really form a best friend?
---
If you did it's again your fault for not getting their contact info. 
---
You're being ridiculous.
---
Dont blame the game.
---
Your being crazy at this point.
---
As I said in another reply, pointing out that the upside could *possibly maybe sometimes* be negated is not really much of a downside. (and lets be honest, how many enemies have extremely low armor, and how much do those factor into anyone's consideration of their build/gear?)
---
It's interesting what you say about two shots though, I hadn't heard that about them.  Where did you find that out?
---
You won't. You will get blacklisted for requesting refunds thats it.
---
The poster was extremely clear about the fact that the PvP exploits would need to be removed before this system would work. The poster was very clear that these exploits exist, and even listed a number of them as examples.
---
They did not say people can't be forced into PvP as it is right now.
---
Your response was unnecessary and pointless, because the poster already covered your concerns.
---
correct, no chance to get there infos.
---
no best friend, but maybe a good ingame buddy.
---
of course, im crazy, stupid, ridiculous. everything you will. but it doesnt change the thing, that theres no text-chat ingame.
---
Black Water Mine by Whitesprings, just farm them and inside then server hop
---
Oh lol. Yes i have a few. But mostly the firerate stuff, like junkies lmgs or heavy 200+ fr weps with bash dmg and stuff. But those magic shotguns? I was today years old, haha.
---
isnt she dead? she says in the recordings amthat if you are hearing them she is dead
---
Fo76 has an environment for amazing and market leading PVP:       
---
1. Base building.      
---
2. Mmo RPG.       
---
3. Claimable territory with reward (workshops).     
---
4. FPS with customisable weapons and armour.     
---
5. First or Third person.       
---
6. Can also do missions with people not just fight.      
---
If Bethesda developed some kind of team death match like seen in games like COD or GTA Online, where players can join into matches running in the background of an adventure server, perfect. Map alterations aren’t necessary, as seen with monster mash. (Fun but rarely active + players)     
---
Alternatively BGS could run PVP in a more “Factions” style, notably very popular in the minecraft franchise. Factions allows players to form teams, and like you were saying, is similar to the teams update coming soon.       
---
This usually gets established by a leader who recruits members in to build numbers for the team. Very easy to create a whole team “on/off” setting at simplest.         
---
        
---
I really like what this game could be, I’m getting sick of wack-a-molerat and I’m really bloody tired of trying to explain to the extremest of the food builds, on reddit that I am not defending the bloody pvp exploits and my idea doesn’t want to force anyone to pvp if they do not want to be involved. Completely optional. This is my third post. The other two got brigaded to shit creek.
---
I can’t live without the mutation and I bet others feel the same so yeah it’s worth it
---
Mods are not supported, which means they will not provide support for you when something goes wrong, they have not and will not ban you for them. They only ban people for using third party programs.
---
Imagine the state of tesla builds when people switch out a taser for a cannon.
---
They haven't made an official statement that im aware of, I've had the game only two months but started using them when I first started playing because my friends have had the game a lot longer than I have, have been fine using those mods from nexus plus the amount of people I see still using it. Also other reddit post I've read. Which has made me feel comfortable using the mods at first I was skeptical as well about them being fine using mods but so far they and i have been fine im sure other reddit users, use it as well
---
Anyone want to help me launch my first on ps4 😂
---
You didn’t answer there.     
---
Still waiting.
---
Thank you, good guide! I jumped into this last night while it had already been kicked off... i had no idea what was going on. Failed about 2 mins after i arrived lol
---
My son is 8 and has played FO4 for quite some time, but only on God mode and mostly just likes building bases and robots. He played a bit of 76, while I am there, because people online are dicks, but he lost interest because there was no God mode and had to spend time collecting resources.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
It’s not a matter of wanting them but hey it gives something to do, idk for me I’m just figuring out shit to do so what ever fills the void.
---
Xb1
---
Imagine reading that post and not knowing you mean secret service with ss
---
I googled “PVP teams reddit” to see if anyone was successful. Anyone who does the same will see your name in two clicks.         
---
Also still waiting for an answer.
---
Or with class freak maxed out you can drop that down to -1 intelligence.
---
People can be willfully ignorant about a lot of things lol
---
A faction system of some kind would be great lol I tried to start an Xbox group when the game came out but there were so many people off an on at that time that I couldn't keep it together
---
I always find deathmatch modes too close quarters so it could work better with the extra space in 76, no more getting killed every 3 seconds after you respawn
---
Oh damn, nvm
---
Well she made them as a backup, doesn’t mean she’s dead, she probably turned them on as she left and just never came back, maybe implying death considering the plague and the hostility of the mire and divide but doesn’t mean death for certain
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
If you want to see an example of what I’m dealing with I can show you. May I tag you in a comment?
---
I am really bad in combat without VATS.  I just don't have the hand-eye coordination.  The people above have great suggestions too.
---
Also, fresh out of the Vault, your stats and weapons stink.  It will take time, but you will get there.
---
Yeah I read the other guys stuff and link lol just keeps beating that dead horse
---
I believe that’s where the Brotherhood will come in, considering venture was there main base before Defiance. So hopefully it’ll be expanded then but at the same time I don’t see the BoS being particularly kind in that expansion
---
Ya might wanna check around on prices for Fixers. Legacy weapons is whole different level of craziness.
---
thanks for the info
---
I'm just not patient at all lmao cause with fallout 4 it was easy
---
Personally I want to see a full rebalance pass before more weapons get added. 76 has been slowly going the way of power creep IMHO. However I'm all for the heavy incinerator returning to add some more choice to non ballistics/explosive heavy launcher style weapons as the good ol' "flame mortar" was a big favourite of mine would urge anyone reading who might be replaying NV as a pyromaniac to add this bad boy to their arsenal!
---
thanks for the clearification
---
I can’t remember if thats the same person but someone yesterday went in loops like that with the whole exploits thing ignoring everything I explained FOR 3 HOURS.
---
Bethesda1: "People still like the game"
---
Bethesda2: "Great, they can pay us money"
---
Bethesda1: "Like an expansion pack?"
---
Bethesda2: "No, more like just to play"
---
Bethesda1: "Ok, and if they don't pay?"
---
Bethesda2: "We shame them..."
---
(rings shame bell)
---
I mean, I'm down with seasons but I'm also annoyed because it'll just be more things to tick off the daily list  but not any real meaningful meaty content. It's something at least but I fear seasons will be  extremely grindy so losing the boss fight as well is rough.
---
The event queen give you 4 radom fluxs.
---
For craft it you need go to nuke zone, kill enemys for get the materials and collect flora (10 per flux, use the perks give you the double flora, i dont know the name in inglish)
---
been using mods since beta, mods are different to hacking. mods will not get you banned
---
That's pretty cool. That might require more effort tho, I was just pitching a quick solution.
---
More like a branching quest line.
---
The main questline culminates in the launching of a nuke. I'm sure you would've seen those going off semi-regularly?
---
I didn't say I don't enjoy playing the game, I've got other things to do. And I'd rather hold onto bullion for new things I might want later than waste it now on things I don't want, would never use, and can't sell or trade. My initial comment was that the camera has very little use beyond the Davenport daily, and there are plenty of other more enjoyable ways to earn treasury notes.
---
Fucking thank you!
---
It is the same one lol that's why they linked your other post
---
Like I said it's just willful ignorance
---
The highest traffic time for this sub is about 12 hours from now, so if you post it around that time, maybe in a couple days or whatever (since apparently posting an idea a couple times to brainstorm it is so awful) you'll probably get more, and more positive, responses
---
I gotta head to bed it's 3:30 here lmao but I saved the post and I'll check back tomorrow
---
Well that was not true upon release. They did not expect CAMPs to be this popular. Also they do listen... Slowly but they do.
---
Exhibit A: Feed The People
---
I rest my case.
---
Bruh i felt this so bad 😭 but is true 😞 when u get attached to someone and then they stop login in or reaching out it hurts 😭
---
Stop wanting it and it will drop.
---
I'm on pc and yeah, market situation might be different, but literally everything got duped into oblivion, so I don't think the prices are much different on consoles.
---
People who sell for 2-3k might be new to the market or just put everything on sale at base game prices.
---
You’re right, I was interpreting it incorrectly and recommending my piece of assumed boredom that I shouldn’t have. (Also I’m genuinely not trying to act like a sarcastic asshole, there’s enough shit on here as is.)
---
O.P. doesn't want to accept the truth.
---
200% they were a DefCon 5 level clinger and the other player has started a whole new character to get away from them.
---
Can you please explain this I'm confused? This is really vague.
---
Um, What. You are aware the *"Battlepass"* is free
---
My whole economy revolves around mutations. very easy money.
---
Omg that was like a sub machine gun laser? I forgot about that bad boy
---
There are power fists
---
Yeah sometimes , figured it was endgame content .
---
that does not count
---
Have a look in the player vendors, I have bought a jffr and bffr combat rifle for 10k and 4k respectively, most ppl are after handmades.
---
Wrong sub. Against rule 10. Also if its a 1* id just scrip it. If its a 2 or 3 you need to list the other effects
---
Do you want this people the check internet and look at the truth before making comment lmao good luck
---
There is literally an interview where they said how surprised they were that building camps was so popular and admitted that it was essentially a last minute addition to the game expanded off of workshops, which until that point were the only place you could build.
---
It’s included when you buy the helmet.
---
Np :) It is not a big deal now since they lowered the amount needed to 15, but earlier.. It was a pain without a list like this :)
---
When does this patch come out?
---
He dont want to play with you than. I made friend in the game while he is using voice chat I am not we are almost playing everday If they add textchat he will just block you because he dont want to see you
---
Couldn't agree more. I want them to add more NPCs make it more expansive. Do you remember the food paste in F04 at that elementary school? I would say Fallout 1st solves the loot problem but it doesn't add very much depth to the game. Tbh all the towns and their stories in this game feel pretty meaningless.
---
They’d turn it into so stupid grind
---
Dude you can hear them plotting your ambush and its so hard on Survival. I miss that so bad.
---
No worries. If someone is bored of the game and looking for things to do, then obtaining every plan whether they need it or not would certainly be a way to combat that boredom. And there's nothing wrong with you being bored with the game either, it does lack content compared to other online games. I've started making different characters- so my main was a "good guy" scavenger rifleman type with a little trading post style settlement for a camp, sided with foundation when wastelanders came. My second is a raider junkie with shotguns/heavy weapons with a bar/diner, third will be a BoS character who lives in his PA with a military base style camp, fourth will be a Responder with a clinic type camp who will sell meds and aid, and the fifth I haven't decided yet, but haven't got to that point. Basically the same way I made replaying single player Bethesda games more fun by creating a new character and equipping/dressing it appropriately to the character I had in mind for it. Not exactly RP, but closer to it than just having every character be a blank slate to pile stats onto. Would be better if there was more choice in 76, but in conversation with NPCs I stick with a certain personality for each character. 
---
And it didn't come off as sarcastic, by the way. I figured you were just trying to be helpful and recommend ways to avoid getting bored with the game. And your suggestions would be helpful for that issue, definitely.
---
Most of the people crouching because they dont want to get killed by punji boards it is not about vendor glitch
---
Build it near water and add a 'high dive' platform for reviving players.
---
You are good to go. Just modify it at an armor bench. You already have the mod.
---
Apologies.
---
Apparently there has still been a way for exploiters to get into player inventories, using either camp budget bugs or latency exploitation. 
---
Not sure on the details of how the hacks work, but I've noticed a couple people at my camp doing bizarre things - even disappearing. 
---
It all made me a little nervous so I've just disabled my shop for now just in case. 
---
Hope that helps.
---
Oh man I thought this was just a rumor and that was patched. I really hope this isn't the case.
---
Free States would be good for sure Quests/filler
---
Bullet xplode  double damage
---
Oh it is epic!
---
Queens are easy peasy.  Shoot the legs, I do more damage on then then the crit spot for whatever reason, and they eventually cripple.
---
Mirelurk kings though.  They scare me.
---
Could just be paranoia on my part so yeah, take it with a grain of salt.
---
" supervision " We the parents are the ones that teach them the difference between any media (not just games) and real live.
---
Yeah it was basically the submachine gun from FO4/76 with some doodads and spit lasers.
---
I would play it if I could put 76 down 😂
---
Yet dropping or deploying the power armor in your camp doesnt seem to raise the budget.
---
When’s patch 20. And is that the season pass patch?
---
Yeah this guy was kinda vanishing and reappearing, not a stealth boy effect just disappearing completely. Was very suss.
---
Yeah only you are thinking this. Any person here suggest this great idea
---
I have yet to see the mothman apart from the peaceful lighthouse one need him to complete tadpole/possum quests
---
Seems like the unspoken rule of RNG
---
*Laughs* *in* *Bloodied* *LMG* *CSA* *build*
---
Good point. 
---
I’ve just finished the BoS questline and it was a nice touch to see (well, hear) the founder infuriated that the BoS was turning into an organization distrusting outsiders and civilians (because after all they keep the tech to rebuild the world). 
---
Illustrated the tension between the isolationism / expansionism in NV and FO4 and the humanism in FO3.
---
Only 2 of the items will go into your Misc tab: Portable Power Pack and Osmosis Kit.
---
I have them on all 20 of my characters. I log in every day with each one and just turn the quest in for the exp and rep, even though about 7 characters haven't even touched the main quest line for Foundation. This way I'm getting the rep, exp, and a few caps every day with the characters in not currently playing.
---
you dont understand the problem. yes, im interested in having more fun ingame with him/her. but i get no depression if not. im old enough to know that buddys came and go. 
---
And I repeat myself: He invited me every day and wanted to play with me.
---
Apparently it was redone https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/
---
When I patch 20 coming out?
---
do you think there's any chance that beth could officially confirm this?
---
Roger Maxson was always a good man, kinda a shame his descendant would turn out to be a fascist cyborg. But I believe he is going to be very angry despite his pragmatic nature cause he had very clearly forbade nuclear weapons to be used by Defiance in fighting the Scorchbeasts then 76 went and did that exact thing. Can’t imagine he’ll be pleased that and Appalachia has the ATLAS or whatever
---
How bout the ultralight build mod?
---
Definitely not patched. Just finished doing it to max one character to ally.
---
The mutants effect adds +10 dr and er to your total. It won't add it directly to the armor piece itself
---
There are a lot of dailies on the Eastern side of the map. Dailies earn scrip and xp. I keep a small supply of bug parts in my stash. While doing dailies, I grab bug parts and do "Stings and Things". Takes just a couple of minutes, and a chance to earn a badge.
---
wait for it...
---
They're changing how daily/weekly challenges work. Instead of earning Atoms, they'll now earn SCORE.
---
When you reach certain amounts of score, you unlock rewards. These are time limited, unlocked in order, and I believe there's 100 rewards.
---
The items shown are some of the rewards.
---
At the moment, they said the challenges will be easier - less of "take a photo of someone in hat in whitesprings" and more "kill a legendary".
---
We dont know how many daily/weekly will be available (currently 5/5), or how many you will need to complete to "rank up". Presumably the lower ranks are easier to unlock than the higher ones.
---
It does mean people will have less atoms (because dailys/weeklys wont give atoms now), but in return you will be able to unlock lots of cosmetics.
---
So this should mean than people who arent buying atoms/FO1st have slightly less to spend in the atom store, but will end up with far more stuff than if they had scraped and saved for that one item (albeit they cant really choose what they get this way). I think that some of the rewards for ranks are actually atoms anyway, so it shouldnt be impossible to get things from the atom shop without paying
---
Yeah that was one of the many issues I've noticed with Vats lately. At least in Fallout 4 a crit was guaranteed to hit and for extra damage. I have the improved crit perk so it should be hitting for more damage but only seems to occasionally.
---
I understand fine. You obviously have some truth related issues.
---
My camp is set up near Nuka Cola factory, just to the north of  the raider camp on the river on the left side of the map. I've seen him walking down the road the runs along that
---
I wish they would add new weapons with new ammo too
---
Single player mode that comes with the initial purchase of the game.
---
you excuse the missing "feature" text chat with the fact that you can set letters in your camp? urgh...
---
Thank you so much for that. Appreciate it :)
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Granted, but its an additional $4.99 a month charge and is only allowed to be used by Fallout 1st members.
---
Thanks! I actually just went out and started farming it. Not as hard as I thought and pretty fun as I was able to kill like 3 legendary scorched beast along the way. So yeah, I guess it worked out in the end.
---
I consistently sell all of my flux at 149 a pop. They do not stay in my vendor for long at all. Have never sold serums, but the normal price is about 250 a pop. I'd think that flux is the better seller since people need it to mod, craft ammo, and make serums. And once some one has their mutations they don't tend to need them again
---
Not sure if someone said this before but make sure you don’t finish the wastelander quest line. The raiders have 2 daily missions for rep but when you finish it they drop down to 1 when you hit end game
---
200-500
---
My god, you truly are a moron.
---
I really find it obnoxious to have to quote myself but from this very post, like I illustrated above:
---
&gt;That aside though, so long as whatever you propose for PvP doesn't affect or disadvantage ANYONE who doesn't want to be involved, more power to you. Just don't lie to people over and over about people not currently being forced into PvP against their will because it's still in the game to date.
---
What platform you on I really need some cobalt
---
Xbox. Though don't think I have much atm. I don't farm it, only sell what I get from farming the Queen
---
Whenever i see a desk fan anywhere or a globe i just really have a need to pick it up and smash it for parts.
---
did you even read my answer? If you had, you'd know your answer completely misses the point
---
we have 2020, fallout 76 is an online fallout - without the ability to communicate.
---
"Thumbs up" or "Heart" is enough communication for you? you are not interested in having a funny talk while you play your favorite game? no reason to be toxic
---
I’m on ps4 •~•
---
You can still share your digital games so you dont have to buy them twice though.
---
Rose was the worst. Its like 14 year old teenage angst. I couldnt take it seriously. I enjoy realism and it just kinda broke the immersion. It started off good though, we had a dead guy in a cage and a room full of dead raiders. Fantastic set up for story, maybe about an ambush. The firebreathers wrecked some shit who knows, instead we got rose. as soon as I entered the dialog it kinda killed it for me. All complaining aside however I do like this game.
---
Well, deploying is only temporary and dropping it means it's free for someone else to take so it'd make sense it doesn't take up budget.
---
Thanks. Mine is set at 500. So maybe a bit on the higher end. I can always go down in price.
---
Drive over it to see if it really is
---
What? People are still posting the same post over and over again. 
---
You know why they do it? Because the event tells them to. 'Ohh look, an event, never done it. Hmm, let's do it' is most probably their thought. Instead of blaming them, I would blame bethesda for not adding the \[4+ players recommended\] or something to indicate it is not the 'Tea Time' difficulty event.
---
Do a run of the ash heap, the scorched should have some for you to scrap for plans
---
Say what?
---
SMASH THEM
---
I just want a proper fast travel mat so my guests don't spawn neck deep in an irradiated lake
---
Slightly off topic, ever shoot one? I went to the rang the other day and this old guy was there trying to sight it in. I ended up sitting with him for a few hours trying to sight in this rifle because he was tired of doing it bc of the kickback messing with his shoulder. Its a fun gun!
---
I think I’ve got some cobalt. Ps4 smmerritt777
---
Both sell but depends on the effort you want to put in and whether you're willing to invest in one or more serum plans.
---
I'd love to have it and mannequins for armor display. I mean, i keep that stuff in my stash, if we put it in the camp they should just take budget camp instead.
---
Makes sense 👍
---
Wouldn’t play without it, only problem is went back to playing some battlefield 4 last night and couldn’t work out for the life of my why I couldn’t jump very high 🤦‍♂️
---
Yeah, anything more than 500 and it's just too expensive. It's not that hard to find them often for less than 500 without much effort.
---
Yay
---
I want much more weapon variety than we currently have tbh. And more mods for the weapons we do have. And more exciting legendary effects. And balance the legendary effects we already have with each other and I don’t mean JUST nerfing the strong ones. 
---
Bethesda still have a lot of work that needs doing on this game.
---
Really? Cool thx for telling me
---
Agreed. OW was a fun game
---
What country are you in
---
You too? Thats the only reason I bought the outfit. What outfit do you wear with the mask? So far the best one Ive found that feels right is the Explorer Outfit.
---
Just checked. I’ve got 7 cobalt as well as some other if you need them
---
(Wooby says nothing)
---
When do you want to make a deal?
---
Pacific time frame...Samoa
---
I won’t be on for a while that’s why I want to know ur Timezone so I can pin point the time I’ll be on for you
---
Dam... it used to be more?! lol 
---
I've been slacking on the brewing front, so its handy to have a list :)
---
There is also two unique guns in the loot pool. Fancy single action is what I’m going for.
---
That’s fine. I went ahead and pulled the cobalt from my vending. I’ll hold it until we can find a time to meet up. I’m selling them for $150 each.
---
I’ll be on at 2:30 tomorrow
---
Free wooby!
---
Unlocked once you've crafted the entire set of PA. Hell they could even sell skins in the atom shop for them 😂
---
Sounds good. What time zone are you?
---
I’m in new zealend
---
Perfect. See you then.
---
Vendor bots buy them for 500, so the problem with selling them for cheaper is that you end up with people buying them and selling them at the train station for more, thereby making a profit for doing nothing.
---
But it's your choice, ultimately.
---
Ok desk fan
---
Yup :) It used to be 25 if i remember correctly. it was horrible. That's why i made the list in the first place as nobody was doing the challenge since it was too time consuming for the amount of atoms you got from it.
---
Just want to also mention that if you use a experimental mirv (maybe all types of Fatman) the mini nukes disappear midair 100% of the time.
---
&gt; They did not say people can't be forced into PvP as it is right now. 
---
If you read yesterday's post, you'd know that this is just false. Sadly OP deleted it so there's no evidence of the straight up falsehood he was pushing back then. That's was I was referring to.
---
It seemed to be a big enough deal that OP provided a whole section on being forced into PvP.
---
Hope that clears the issue up.
---
I havent found anything yet that I feel fits it perfectly yet. I'll try the explorers outfit though.
---
True. I’ve got mine set at 500. But the only downside is the 1400 daily limit. So, I guess I could hit my limit with the serums at bots and then sell them for 400 in my vending.
---
BUY IT FROM SOMEBODY ELSE
---
I really like the CAMP building the rest of the game is dam right boring and the combat is a joke... melee is basically the best option which makes things boring... 
---
They really need to rethink weapon balance maybe introduce penalty's in the way of passive buffs or debuffs based on weapon types.. For example reduce the dmg melee weapons can do but give melee users a defence/HP buff when wielding, Increase range weapon dmg but give them a debuff of reduce Defence/HP this way the cost of making ammo and repairing weapons makes sense.
---
Reminds me of one time when I was walking home from work, saw some screws In the cracks of the sidewalk and the exact thought in my head was “oh I should grab those for my excavator armor”
---
Everybody want their own pony, it's natural! :-)
---
250 for a serum? Lowest I've seen any is 400 lol
---
Mate, you're stalking someone and you call ME toxic?
---
I play on PS4. I have a mike. If I want to chat, I chat. If I don't, I don't.
---
No, I don't care about text chat. Not even a little bit. 
---
We have the ability to communicate, people just don't necessarily want to and to be honest, I can see why.
---
Try to spin it however you like, but old mate didn't want to communicate with you. Accept it, move on.
---
Can anyone say why the power armor go into your inventory after 60 seconds? if this timer is gone, it would be enough, you can stand your power armor in your camp.
---
There are ways you could possibly bypass this, such as carefully placing the camp while not on the same server, but then it's extremely likely you wouldn't be able to have both of your camps placed on the same world and one of you would have to go without.
---
I use all excess money to buy serum recipes. I currently have 9. At first they sold really well but lately they have failed off to one or two a day at most. 
---
I got the odd time someone would clear me out totally to resell higher I guess, but that’s very rare. 
---
I suspect fluxes would sell massively better, a testament to this is the fact I don’t want to list them myself as they’re too valuable. I’d buy them in a heartbeat if I saw them for sale but I am yet to see any for sale, and the only time I did the guy wanted 2k for them.
---
I constantly see them for under 400. 300 is the highest I'd ever pay. And over on the trade sub you can get them for 250 or less no problem
---
Someone would lag out the servers with loads of chassis
---
Guess it could take some experimenting. Tried it a couple of times with no success 😭
---
I agree with you :) but my team are stubborn 😂
---
I did before I realized they will make it count towards stash space like the other displays. So fuck them.
---
I out it at the third floor without even knowing what was happening i guess im one step agead of you all
---
He just wants the smelly willy
---
Can I get a carry on this please?
---
Oh man you got me laughing at work. People used to say (complain) that F3 is just Oblivion with guns.
---
Well, punk....I...I didn’t expect you to say that....punk.  I mean listen here punk, it could be 2 bullets or it could be one!  But wait, what if this here .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world.....is a Quad!  Still feeling lucky, punk?
---
Your not a therapist you are *the* rapist
---
A colleague shouting the usual stuff at everybody in the group in COD-MW2 back in the day to then find one of them was 7 - he shut up a bit after that.
---
I thought that it build jeff
---
Cool. Yeah, I think I’m going to sell my serums to bots to hit my daily 1400 and then farm and sell stable flux. I’ve got some stable flux you you want them. 150 a pop.
---
Terrain makes me think Savage Divide, but I cannot be more specific. Sorry.
---
I play on PS4 as well and had this bug happen to me all 4 times I died tonight.
---
I did the same thing last night. Instead of playing I looked at the main menu. I just played Borderlands 3. Gotta get ready for the dlc!
---
if i have the learned plans/atomic shops plans, i would craft the lowest level one just to use in the case, because you can’t see the level just looking at it.
---
Gotta do one up on higher/raised land section, another below... do it just right and you can have an sort of connecting floating staircase
---
I know gaming on mobile is considered blasphemy, but if they give me the old iso fallouts on my phone I'll be very happy.
---
If you played F76 since 2018 check beth launcher on PC you might have gotten 1 &amp; 2  for free on there.
---
Pink ghouls.
---
congratulations, another hobby psychologist, just because you don't need text chat (a basic function) doesn't have to apply to me.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
yes, i have the possibility to talk too, but if the person opposite doesn't have a voice chat active (which is not activated at the beginning) then i can talk as much as i want.
---
how do you know that someone doesn't want to communicate with me? maybe he just doesn't know that i'm trying to communicate
---
Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)
---
they have confirmed its free
---
I do. They also gave us tactics but I can't bring myself to play them due to the very outdated visuals
---
Thanks!
---
I'm new and i noticed that all my stash items are shared on the vendor, those items are showed only to me or everyone?
---
hello, to place other floating items try to place them onto a powerarmorframe, then renove the powerarmorframe.
---
to get larger objects on top of it (workbench eg) try placing down a small floormat/doormat and put the larger object on the mat then move the mat on top of powerarmor or where you want it.
---
You two go get a room already.   It’s obvious you’re in love and meant for one another.
---
" Power armor bad. Bloodied and unyielding gud. " ~ Bethesda.
---
Would be very nice but as pa has been ignored by Beth, can't see it happening.
---
maximizing Flamingo Units is the new end game
---
Escape artist does that.
---
and here is me, who rolled every day and not getting even 1 unyielding piece. this game is shite
---
Even when nothing is attacking you tho?
---
there was a small drive-up playground with a parking area during the sheepsquatch quest line, made me think of that.
---
i always thought something like the skyrim mannequins would be awesome considering they already have weapon displays
---
Absolutely, would love it ! On the other hand, no thanks, it’ll be another duping method
---
Yes. It happens to me in my own camp when Beckett sees me sometimes, or any defenses.
---
I think this is posted almost daily
---
AFAIC this happened with unclaimed corpses: they disappear and leave their loot on the ground. 
---
Twice i found such piles of loot from SB - wing fragments, bones, recipes and meat. Many times - liquids/masses. They glow on their own :-)
---
But i never found a legendary this way. Not even once.
---
okay, thanks for the clarification.
---
Apparently its not just those who used the glitch but camps that take a while to load in too
---
Had a look around, ground is too dark as it's technically in the ash area :(
---
Maybe there's something to that but... I can manually place all my PA sets.  Yes, it's only temporary, but I haven't noticed it causing increased lag.  And whenever I show up at a SBQ fight there's often a dozen different sets of PA, and although it can be laggy as all heck, I doubt it's the PA that's causing that.
---
I think I took a pause from this game a month ago because of my lack of stimpaks and frustrations haha
---
I have a hunch that we will when player bunkers come hopefully later this year.  I would think we’ll learn how to make them with their help.
---
The one from NV was a prototype, it looked like a pistol version of the LAER. We could get either it or the Yuma Flats YK32 Pistol and YK42B Rifle from the 1, 2 and Tactics.
---
The way the displays are at the moment it'll probably be both.
---
So basically everything 😂😂
---
Bro back when this game first released the stash Weight was only 400 and cap limit was like 20K.... I remember being full of stuff after like 30 minutes of playing in the beta
---
That would be really cool.
---
Yeah but i can deal with everything else but having a restriction on the weight is fucking trash
---
800 is no better i hit that limit at lvl15
---
They had a limit on caps? Wtf is wrong with them lmao
---
They still do? It’s 30K now
---
I feel the same about F3 &amp; FNV. But the iso ones have a certain appeal to the way they look, probably nostalgia.
---
They still do have a limit it’s 30K I think now
---
**Seasons** are coming, yes. Calling it a battle pass makes it seem like you’ll have to pay just to play the game.
---
I agree, my friend. Today was pretty good...got a good drop on an Executioners 2-Shot Gatlin Laser with +50% Vats damage and Vats reduction. I'm high level but not a heavy gunner so when I was doing a daily a low level started to join. When he saw my level and not knowing who to trust he appeared to stop in his tracks. I felt bad but I just kept playing and he joined in. Afterwards I waved him over and dropped the weapon for him. He seemed really happy with it and it made me feel better that I didn't have to script it. I then dropped a bunch of ammo and plans to another low level who didn't have much in her vender. She was excited and thanked me several times. Karma comes around shortly after and I get a T-60 Knight CPT PA paint plan from Camp Venture. Sold it for 20k pretty quickly. Then I decided to make a few SS armor pieces before I got off the game and landed an arm of  Bolstering with -50 fall damage, +1 agility. Also landed a weightless opposite arm with -50 fall damage. So I jumped off Seneca Mtn and landed without taking any damage whatsoever. Now I'm SS Jetpack ready...after 400 more gold bullion. And....no, lol, I'm not done...I found a bag that had a ton of plans. All the backpack mods was in there: high capacity, lead lined, insulated, armor plated, refrigerated. I had the armor plated, lead lined, chem mod and grocery mod but the others I didn't. I couldn't believe my luck. So, OP, look to help out others. It always makes me feel good to help others. The grind brings me down too.
---
They still have a limit on caps. It's 30k now, use to be 25k. Also don't hoard so much scrap. I'm level 335 with 1k+ hours in and have very few problems with my weight limits. You just have to figure out what to keep.
---
Especially as soon as you get rid of stuff that's when you need it 😂😂
---
Wow that is so dumb like why? They never did these things before there is no possible reason to do this.
---
Hey another female gamer here. I play daily and would love some more friends who also don’t mind text chat. My psn is leCRUIZE if anyone wants to add :) No mic, I just use the ps messages app or discord to communicate. 
---
OP I’ll add you just in case you miss this comment. Anyone else scrolling through feel free to add and send a message my way
---
Your post (and other reasons) made me subscribe to 1st too Just now. LOL. Thanks. (the tent and scrapbox are great. wished the private worlds would save our buildings...)
---
I just got them myself... and have NO idea what to do with them. Dang these things are heavy!
---
I agree 60 seconds is a ridiculous amount of time. Trying to take a good picture of all my power armours is a race. 
---
But if they where permanent is constantly be worried I'd get back to camp and they'd be gone forever, like the turrets. 
---
Besides that, could have a limit on how mang you can place at once.
---
Well technically it’s a must since there’s an online economy and not having a limit to caps is kinda game breaking. Technically you could have 150K caps cuz your allowed 5 characters per game user but that’s if you get 30k caps on every character
---
Yes that is the main problem man lol i do not want to do that it is time consuming and unnecessary. Fallout 4 i was able to have everything and scrap everything and hoard all that i ever needed so i can go out and do other things. It is annoying run out of things i really need at a certain time and then have to go find it again. Cap limit, weight limit, storage limit is unnecessary and stupid.
---
Why would you need five characters?
---
It’s the trade off of having a online fallout you need limits
---
I rely heavily on serenpidity and on one hitting my enemies as im melee so i can do high damage
---
Thanks was looking in to pistols maybe junkies but yeah they seem underwealming . I wonder if it’s worth going all comando perks and picking up one rank in each rifleman perk rather than ground pounder to get the plasma flamer rather than my Tesla as I think that’s what’s causing the bug it’s only 3 levels so I might try that before I shelf the char and wait for a fix
---
A lot of it is preparation i.e. never get caught in a situation where you're ambushed by a MLK or don't rush down the SBQ early without taking precautions and being mindful of your surroundings.
---
People underestimate the power of stealth. A lot of times Mire'kings will stop when they can't  see me. Make sure you have a silencer and the bloodied/unyielding armor makes agility so high it's easy to hide. The main thing is to attack from high ground that they cannot reach.
---
1) Try out different builds
---
2) have multiple characters with different reps for different factions for all perks
---
3) more stash weight cuz it’s 800 x 5.... just transfer everything over to another character.
---
4) replay ability...
---
May I go on?
---
What would be cool is if the Responders and Free States came back together trying to rebuild their own factions. Perhaps the survivors of each factions could have teamed up outside of Appalachia then when they heard of the settlers coming back, they came back as well. We could see them initially start as a small survivor group that we help (donate supplies, do dailies, e.t.c.) and as time goes on they become larger and eventually split up. The free States retaking making a new settlement (could say Harper's ferry is too infested with super mutants) and the Responders head to flat woods.
---
It is 100% necessary. This game is online. And everything you have it has to keep track of. Every non stackable item the world loads in is 1 more thing putting strain on the game. 
---
The cap limit is there to try to keep the economy under control, though it doesn't work. And the scrap they have 1st for, which I don't agree with.
---
Sounds like you are a low level from another comment you made. Don't hold on to guns that you arnt using. Sell them or scrip them. So if your gun breaks don't repair it. Just kill something and take their weapon. Untill level 45/50 your gear isn't that important. Make sure you scrap all your junk before storing it. Only keep like 50 of each junk. And the junk you use more of keep a bit more.
---
Im just waiting for the remaster mod of the old ones
---
Like the maniquins in Skyrim
---
Serendipity doesn’t work in power armor
---
Mmh, Maybe not a lot of enemy have low armor, but a lot of them have a weak point that doesnt need anti-armor effect at all... but you are right about the downside not being really a downside. However most legendary weapon effect are just situational upside anyway.  
---
For the 2 shots, the effects are known for a long time. You can compare accuracy between same weapon and different legendary effects.  
---
The weapon break issue is (somehow) mitigated by reparation kits, tho.

In order of personal preference
---
Totally agree. There are some workarounds and little cheats people use, some I know, some I've seen and should practice, but we shouldn't have to snap stuff down or use furniture etc to place things the way we'd like.
---
Your suggestions would be perfect and no doubt talked about on here before. I'd just like to be able to snap stairs next to a wall like in FO4 and use half floors alongside them. You can use a technique to place the big metal-framed stairs on top of each other but that means mesh flooring inside your house build if you want  something you can do easily in FO4.
---
I’m pretty sure if someone had over a million of 1 item in there inventory it would crash the server and you’d probably never be able to load that player into the game just because it would crash the servers hence the online trade off hence the weight limit/stash limit.
---
One that works
---
Do you have to complete the event with 4/4 for chance at the plans to drop?
---
So tired of folk who are all bout legendary farming and not PTFO. always end up 3/4 because 3 to 4 folk only want to kill ghouls, and i am running to collect radiated ore praying it's respawned again.
---
and HTF are you level+100 BUT can't cripple ghouls!! jeez
---
That'll teach them.
---
The chest piece does I think. I just got a whole set and when I changed out pieces the +/- 10 showed in the numbers.
---
Only you can see your stash items through your vendor. Items for sale are marked with an icon to the left of the item name.
---
Possibly. Though I don't think so. I know the stackable d*pe got really out of hand. People had easily 100k+ of multiple ammos and gifts. I didn't do it but carry 30k+ ammo for serval different types of guns and have no issue. Stackable don't take any extra strain than 1 item to my knowledge. Since its just a number not a separate item.
---
I do understand the limits and was trying to explain them to op haha. Since he truly doesn't seem to understand them
---
BEST advice !!
---
Probably explosive bait. You can damage camps without triggering PVP or a bounty. Griefers gonna grief...
---
Blah. They need to stick to single player rpg way better. A game like this cannot have a stash limit or cap limit. Hopefully fallout 5 strays away from multiplayer cause it fucking blows
---
You can
---
Isn't it already fixed on the PTS? I remember logging on the first few days it was added and crafting it. It has really great stats on the shielded version.
---
I also want Aries from the blueridge traders and mort from the wayward
---
God yes. Any of the new factions would be nice but instead we get the boring and predictable military jocks for the hundredth time.
---
Free states were definitely one of the more interesting of the new factions. Feels like they could have done a lot more with them and the responders instead of shoehorning in a faction that shouldn't be there.
---
I’ll comment here and look for it when I can play!
---
You're too kind!!
---
It's not new. Maybe a resurgence but by no means new.
---
I take it that you were buying junk items?
---
as a bloodied build right after receiving flux....heal up till you store.
---
How did the first guy take the stuff you bought?
---
Angry Turtle is the man does everyone have to 1st to use private server or can you invite anybody
---
Had a separate question i got to lvl25 and it said i reached my limit with special points? Though i saw in forums it was lvl50 this happens? Did it change?
---
Then go play those games. Myself and many others have found many many hours of enjoyment from this game. A lot of this seems like a you problem, and those are easily solved
---
Specials are capped at 15. You can't have 50 str. But you get points to use until level 50
---
He was selling scrap pretty cheap. While I was busy in a vendor, he placed a triangle stack of spikes around me that killed me before I could fast travel. Second guy did a square of them instead of triangle but I didn't have any junk on me.
---
Nah i am sure lots agree. And i do enjoy the game overall just hate the storage limit
---
Oof
---
That was my issue with the minigun - the ammo machine doesnt make 2mm, and crafting it yourself you get far less than if crafting .50 or 5mm. So while the other heavy weapons are easy to keep fed, the guass mini needs a lot of farming for supplies. If you prime it then you craft more ammo, but then you need a constant supply of crimson flux
---
Yeah. Cheaply priced, not even thinking this could happen.
---
We definitely need more Weasel in the game 👍
---
I do that to low level players on passive mode to scare them with the chameleon mutation. I'll close doors at their camps, toss arrows, and grenades. Then when they find me I give them stimpacks and cranberry cobblers :) they love the scare too, they usually message me after and friend me.
---
No i reached level 25 and i added one special point them it said i reached my special limit? And that
---
 I could move a point over to another special skill? But i thought you get special points until lvl50? None of my special skills are at 15. Highest i have is 7
---
If the game is so bad then why do you play it ?
---
You get no rewards though with the current bug lol it auto-completes challenges but... no rewards.
---
Oh i got what you meant
---
Yep, I've had a two shot, furious &amp; assassin's exploding in the last fortnight.
---
Just said i enjoy it lol
---
Thanks lol I’m very new to reddit
---
The jail is also a good spot for a quick steel farming.
---
I made a Fixer for a level 6 player selling cheap plans near the Wayward. Granted its level 20 but now he has something to look forward to I guess
---
Yes I’ll make one for you now. My gamer tag is brozoge (reposted bc i messed up before lol)
---
Literally the only one I thought would fit the seriousness of it lmao
---
The well isnt the comparible item - the turbo fert is.
---
While the turbo fert is probably less useful than the ammo, it can be handy if you need to craft a lot of things like alcohol due to ease of gathering supplies
---
In the same vein, power armor also doesn't help against poison DOTs. And it sucks at stealth, which really is every bloodied player's best defense - that, and killing things before they can even hit you.
---
It happens to me too. The game content is just not engaging. Fallout used to have massive maps with lots of secrets and Easter eggs, with FO76 not so much. It’s all very repetitive.
---
Bethesda have never been very good at fixing bugs but I didn’t mind so much when their Games were engaging with lots to achieve, like with FO4. I’d rationalise that with a Map this large and storylines so complex there are bound to be issues. I can’t say that with FO76. 
---
Also the server issues. Database server (access to weapon wheel, stash box, crafting, vendor) runs like dog shit, has since the Beta. Server not responding every couple of hours. 
---
It’s hard to find the motivation to grind when your grind is continually interrupted by bugs &amp; server boots.
---
Really it’s a bad game, with shoddy coding, poor design &amp; under resourced. Bethesda keep promising the minimum to keep us on, fail on delivery and yet we keep coming back. By Einstein’s definition, I am insane.
---
Yep, somebody did it to us yesterday
---
same here. Not a single one.
---
I’d love this Free States to me is really interesting and I’d love if they came back also would be really cool if you can have your own bunker and customise it
---
Completely failed that event yesterday n one guy on mic was SO damn salty ha ha
---
try searching by my method at least once , you will be surprised :)
---
I've had it happen with my AA one as well.
---
Also have it get stuck and wont reload until input it away and take it ou6 again
---
Honestly I don't think Div 2 devs are an example of great conduct, some time ago they banned like 80% of their players and undid their last two weeks progress, randomly selecting them, because some were exploiting a glitch. In the end some glitchers were free to keep playing and some who didn't even glitch found themselves banned.
---
I beek carryin people on this event for weeks and still ain't got it! Congrats fam
---
I always equip blocker and dodgy before fighting the SBQ, but its because I'm  running a heavy gunner build so I don't need AP to use VATS. 
---
Besides, I always jump on the roof or tent after SBQ dies, since there will be mobs spawning after it.
---
Use the light footed perk and crouch at vendors.. those traps they do with punji boards will become useless and u can buy cheap scrap all day..
---
Didnt see the post until now. Why was it removed?
---
Yeah, that's a common lure. 
---
Only thing to is report them &amp; keep an eye out in future.
---
We need the assault rifle from Fo3 and the Sleepytime from fonv,or just a suppressor for the 10mm cause that thing is as ear piercing as the siren you can place at your camp,I'd also like the anti material rifle and riot shotgun from new Vegas
---
You inconsiderate, game ruining, jerk. I friended a guy that turned into a stalker. The second I would get online he was there. He would send me voice messages one right after another and get mad if I didn't reply or do what he wanted. Even after I changed my online status to appear offline he was right there as soon as I loaded in. When I finally ditched him, his friend messaged my husband. After we both banned him his FAMILY started messing. I had to pay PlayStation to change our online IDs. 🤬😆 I will never friend anyone in Fallout 76 ever again. People are crazy. Especially in pairs or groups.
---
I only sell serum in my machines,  i  see lot of players have fluxs for for 300-400c, but do they really sell them?  300c is excessive for something that really is very easy to get, there are always users launch nukes in the queens, or you can do it your self and kill 3 queen in 40 minutes, or launch a nuke in whitesprings,  at the begining the fluxs selling for 30 or 50c on reddit market.
---
OK. Weird, but ok.
---
Your method is "scavenging stealthly"; i am simply scavenging sometimes...
---
I think it's just your real-life luck: there is at least two spawn spots for random monster (bos outpost and forest) in the prime strike zone, where legendary monsters could spawn and some player can kill them and lose the place where corpse fell, than you can find that forgotten remains.
---
SB's retinue scorched are never legendary; SB itself can be legendary, but it's corpse is big enough for everyone to find...
---
You are just lucky, deal with it :-)
---
Yeah but who can be assed jumping out to menus etc. Most peeps I play with on this and ESO we go thru Discord.
---
lol
---
Fairly certain it does this, or at least for me it does already
---
Remove the red crosshair over players! for it is too easy to spot players that are hidden in bushes or under water
---
If you're going to go AFK at least do it on the drums or the spit
---
Feel your pain bro
---
Would love the Solar Scorcher.
---
Pour a Nuka out for me 😅

i would use discord, no problem. but how can i tell anyone my discord-name through not activated ingame voice? thats the main problem i have.
---
Thanks
---
I would but I'm addicted and my supplier was killed by a glowing one
---
Oh once when me and my teammate were doing Becketts quest rescuing sage i shot at the mothman at the cultist camp and because whenever there are enemies near he loses his invulnerability and that lead to his downfall as my teammate and i mowed him down with TSE handmade and an AA 50.cal and im probally going to put the dust and wings on display as hes kind of rare
---
Considering they’re all a bunch of survivalists, it wouldn’t be too outlandish for a group of them to have escaped the scorched siege on Harpers Ferry. I can see them returning from the uncharted wilds west of the Mire.
---
Puenamic mod on your torso will help greatly. Then use perk 2 or 3 of fireproof for explosion and SB sonar attacks
---
Dude... the fuck is this past about other than.. noob launched nuke in wrong spot, i bailed but still got the xp/ rewards.  What lv are you?
---
I sell my flux for 150-200
---
If you wanna be disappointed put a souvenir Teddy bear on display. He's just lying down but on the wrong side. You can't see him
---
I haven't came across him but I've searched him up and I've praised him for his generosity and once he gets online I've got some backpack mod plans and stuff with his name on 
---
Gotta keep that generosity train rolling  - CHOO CHOOO
---
I didn't get the quest rewards just that server wide message you get when the queen dies. Did get the xp for the queen dying tho.
---
What he said what platform you on
---
Well if you want to launch a nuke i can help, im on ps4 as well and he and my teammate always nuke places, btw have you completed officer on deck, we can clear out the silo and you can actually launch the nuke. Btw we will do it in a private as we can get more flux and enemies to ourselves.
---
You still need the plan ?
---
each area's dailies are in its own set of "pools"   so when you the area after your daily quest cooldown it draw a quest out of the pool that is not active.
---
as an example, in the ash heap you do lucky mucker, and dross toss today, but did not do the camden hotdog quest.   once your cooldown (20whatever hours) is over you enter the ash heap again.  the hotdog quest is still available so it cannot be drawn as the new daily, the game will randomly draw either dross toss __or__ lucky mucker to give you for the day
---
each pool area is:
---
- the mire
---
- ash heap
---
- forest
---
- cranberry bog
---
- toxic valley
---
- savage divide
---
- raiders
---
- davenport
---
- settlers
---
note* the two scout quests are marked as repeatable, so they can be done every single day after cooldown
---
Oh but they do stop and wave 🙂
---
Because they have a Troubleshooter build, are capable of doing the entire event alone, and want to keep as much of the robot-bustin’ XP for themselves.
---
I think it depends. Camden dailies alternate, as do raider dailies. I'm not sure if grafton changes (buried with honor, big game hunter, grafton day) or if great of the enemy is an alternate to cop a squatter.
---
Still need the plan ?
---
The funny thing there is a mod that implements chat in-game (at least for PC players), yet Bethesda can't.
---
Coach the guy on correct spot.  Lol I'm just messing with you bro.
---
Flatwoods Monster sperm.
---
That's how Swamp Heart keeps coming back.
---
I run bloodied with heavy guns in PA. The only thing that kills me are mirelurk kings. And the occasional red floater for some reason. I don’t think fireproof works on them. If you get the drop on them they’re not a problem, though.
---
30th
---
I'm like this. But I'm genuinely depressed, so
---
Comon prices used to be almost near 300-400 for everything, seeing prices going to like 600 now and even 1000 is beyond me.
---
Maybe they started assuming everyone can lug around 5000 bars of gold bullion 😅
---
Final fantasy 11 had an option to dry a plant after you grew it so it would be a permanent display item. So grow a really pretty glowing flower and now it can no longer be used to craft or sell it bit it's a nice thing to look at. Wouldn't be too hard to add such a thing.
---
... they didn’t think CAMP building would be a thing??? Seriously how badly did they misjudge the core audience for this damn game!?
---
What happens after they've rolled out all your proposed limitless weight  containers? also curious what happens to the junk you had stored in the scrapbox when your subscription ends?
---
I saw a video of a guy coming home to a player afk on their patio, so they built a springboard trap under them with a floor sensor on all sides. Waited to see when they came back, they flew really well.
---
He sure knows now though ha ha
---
I just want to get a big "2nd" icon for us second-class patrons, to go with the "1st" icon subscribers get.
---
i think i will install this mod, because i personally need an text chat because of many reasons. but iam a little scared about to be banned by beth, because of using mods.
---
Theres easier ways to say “I wouldn’t mind the idea.” Lmfao.     
---
Guess thats it then.
---
that may be luck, if its not about 4-5 times per day for me (like everytime) for couple of days. i say its consistent enough to write this guide.
---
It will never be fixed, I doubt they know how or even care at this point.
---
They could keep the last endless container exclusively to FO1st until they think of something new. The waiting periods in between can be stretched so running out of 'endless containers ideas' would not happen within the first year or so.  
---
The junk in your scrapbox stays there after the subscription. You can take it out but not put it in. This could work the same way for all these containers.
---
As long as it is lore-friendly I am for it.
---
No, you're literally the only person that wants it and should feel very ashamed.
---
...yes please. I want as many weapons from old Fallout games as possible, even if they do go the route of making them ATX skins like they're doing with the R91.
---
Running two Quad Crossbows and honestly, no other primary effect even comes close. A semi auto frame (kinda like the Helsing in Metro) is a must.
---
And don't use up all your agility slots &gt;.&lt;
---
Just keep in mind you can chat with ppl who have this mod too. Beth is aware of mods and seems ok with that since they dont break the game. Also you can't play NW with mods.
---
Just kill them with nuke mines or punch them away
---
Lol I ain't clicking that shit 🤣
---
I stopped recieving notifications from treasure maps while NOT hiding. I went on a treasure hunting spree (30-40 maps, various locations). After the first 10 maps I stopped recieving notifications about what was dug up. Id still get the items, but not the pop up.
---
Um there is a website for viewing deleted posts... Let me get back to you on that.
---
Also when you do choose which to side with, the vault raid is different depending who you chose. Its not possible to do both missions yourself.
---
However if you have a friend who's at that point in the missions, you can tag along with them.
---
Using this method you can play through both versions of the raid. Personally I preferred the Raider raid
---
small things to fix as you say :  
---
Buy &amp; expand your server not small  
---
bugs small  
---
Teach player to how to play impossible  
---
non stop grinding not small   
---
All of you acting like this things are just 1 hour job it is not If you play game more than 100 + hours of course you will get bored try other things
---
His arms open wide
---
Someone's Electrically Charged mutation was triggered.
---
It's not worth it in my opinion because it's benefit is miniscule and it has multiple downsides(like breaking Instigating bonuses for starters). Looks cool tho.
---
Not allowed here. Read sub rules.
---
Let's not overstate what was said. 
---
All I said was that I don't care so long as it doesn't affect or disadvantage those that don't want to be involved.
---
You know, pretty much what that first sentence says verbatim.
---
Ricochet can deflect a whole hit and thus, maybe save you from a stagger effect
---
So in 1 year make everything weightless except armor and weapon also make fo1st player bug testers ... I am adding this to my worst suggestions list everyday at r/fo76 and probably you are the winner
---
The best ones are sort of I game
---
OP, I like your idea and it's stuff I've thought of in the past too. However, you have one major flaw to your thinking - Bethesda doesn't care about customer retention and long term profit. It's VERY clear from their actions that they're happy to burn their reputation to the ground just so long as they make good with short term revenue.
---
If I didn't know any better, it looks like Bethesda is intentionally being run into the ground to make it easier/cheaper to sell off as a fixer-upperer for some other investors to deal with.
---
Dude wtf stop todd howard crying at home and zenimax just go bankrupt holy shit you must be satan himself
---
well... we are all bug testers. but please elaborate why you think this is a bad suggestion
---
It'd be nice, but honestly the power armor quest feels like something you're supposed to stumble across. Back when I first got started during the beta, I didn't figure out how to get a power armor workbench until level 35ish, and letting people put the poster in their camps would kinda get rid of the "hunt," and make it feel less special.
---
Thanks for confirming.  Sounds like good news coming though.
---
Even something as utterly broken as that suggestion wouldn't make pistols viable ngl
---
why would they give away something for free, when people showed them that they are willing to pay for it?
---
the whole point is to piss you enough to pay for quality of life features in an already full priced game. No way I'm going to fall for that shit
---
also, the 'endless containers' thingie is just a suggestion to increase the benefit of FO1st when giving everybody the scrap box. I suggest this mainly because much of the scrap box code could be copy-pasted to make these type of containers. So "easy" for BGS to do.  
---
The general idea is just to add value to the subscription when giving the scrap box to everybody so people keep buying the subscription. There have been other suggestions too, like a workbench in the tent that can scrap weapons and armor.
---
If you'd only located the nuke properly, this likely would have been a non-issue.
---
Hopefully a lesson you've learned for next time :)
---
It's somewhat of a joke. People complain how there is no armor perk card for pistols, like there is for every other weapon type. Many complain how useless the Legendary Perks are.
---
I think he meant the SBQ event - where you have to do a certain level of damage over the course of the fight, to even be eligible for loot to drop from the corpse.
---
define "fixed"
---
The freedom of having your own world is pretty nice. Mine keeps crashing after about 2 hours though
---
Not gonna happen in million years. Cough up your $15.
---
Because more players would continue playing the game. MANY players quit because of the inventory management. More players would give more revenue so it might compensate the possible drop in subscriptions when it comes to revenue.
---
Nobody going to pay to gain advantage against themself only for 1 month and also pay monthly for testing bug for other player . everything you say is so bad I am impressed  and this bad idea won't make game good for anybody
---
well you would get a new advantage each time something is made available for the other players. And you still have the tent, private server and atoms.
---
I keep a piece of life saving armour on me when I'm doing those types of events. Won't help your power armor problem but you may drop the metal coffin at some point
---
Ignore the concern trolls. My kiddo and I play 76 together as well. He's 12. It's good father/son bonding time, particularly during this pandemic when he can't see his friends.
---
Right in the middle of the yellow circle.
---
Hi I’m back!        
---
https://www.removeddit.com/r/fo76/comments/her170/a_better_solution_for_pvp_in_adventure/    
---
So the reason you were disagreeing with my idea was solely due to the fact that I had not considered exploits when I worded the post.       -&gt; Is what you’re now claiming, albeit your earlier posts.       
---
Fuck you’re sensitive.      
---
You also wrote 6 long rants to avoid a yes/no question today, and endless yesterday.      
---
I think
---
You really come to argue against PVP as a whole, it’s clear.       
---
You’re a witty joker and if your goal was to cause a fuss, I applaud you. But if you think I’m dumb enough to, see you on google doing the same thing to other posts ranting “theres no point working on PVP”, viciously against anyone with persistence, believe you are doing this because you’re arguing the semantics of my post?      
---
I pity you mate.
---
Thanks for the advice, you may well be right, this isn't something I'd heard of before actually. I'm still a bit confused about the rules though. Just today I was playing alone and claimed a workshop... mainly as it was cheap and claiming it, building my blueprint workshop base and doing all my scrapping and stashing there would be quicker and cheaper than eating some meat (to resolve my overencumbrance), FTing back to my C.A.M.P, scrapping and stashing there, then returning to where I was.
---
Anyway, again a player turned up, killed me and claimed the workshop... odd that it's now happened to the last two workshops I claimed when before my original post I'd claimed many workshops without any other players fighting me. Is it just coincidence, or was the coincidence that I'd managed to claim workshops for so long without drawing any attention?
---
Knowing what I now knew I made sure to not seek revenge... there was an option to ignore too which I selected thinking that should make certain that I remain neutral to this player.
---
I stuck around in the area as firstly I had business being there, and secondly I had killed most of the supermutants who attacked the workshop and wanted to be sure I got my reward for completing the quest. I could see the player who was now claiming the workshop, and they appeared neutral to me, so I just started trying to mop up the remaining supermutants, however I was interrupted by the player killing me again. For a low level player the cost of being PKed seems quite high, especially if the only thing you can do to prevent it is to leave the area. Your caps total can be halved with just a couple of deaths.  
---
I respawned without seeking revenge a second time and this time just hung around and was killed again. The player who killed me was neutral to me when they killed me and didn't become wanted as a result of killing me. What mechanic is at work here? I would assume that unless I attacked the workshop then I would remain neutral or to workshop owners have a radius of influence where they can treat anyone else as hostile?
---
Also is it definitely just junk I dropped when I died? I swear I got some plans as a reward for the defend the camp quest but had no plans in my inventory by the end of this.
---
Wait, you had to let him in? Was your door locked? You're one of those locked door types, aren't you? What are you hiding?
---
This.
---
How about learn how to manage your inventory and improve yourself I think this is great Idea and you hate half of the game If you really hate it don't play the game
---
Ye was the guys first nuke, I'm sure he knows what to do next time.
---
The only item I can think of was a military award tux outfit that retailed for like 1800 atoms and little to no one bought it. This was when the game first game out, so October 2018. that's only definitive item I can think of though.
---
Making multiple infinite inventory containers would literally and figuratively break the game. Dupers would have a field day, mules would become useless, (I put hours/days into training mine and getting them uny armor) the player max weight limit would become irrelevant, piles and piles of duping and exploitation counter measures would be undone, and to top it all off, servers would become infinitely less stable/laggy.  
---
The reason why the scrapbox works is because there's a small, finite amount of different things you can put in it. Servers don't struggle to load in thousands of pieces of steel, they struggle to load in hundreds of different types of aid items, ammo items, etc, because the varied items each need to be loaded in separately while stacks of items are loaded in all at once. This suggestion would completely destroy fallout 76, no question about it. I'm completely sick of all these people coming in with "suggestions" on how to improve the game. At least be a little realistic. Leave your pipe dreams to yourselves.
---
Agreed.
---
the server thing is not true. The endless containers apply to stackable items. having 1 stimpack or 1000 stimpacks doesn't increase server load since it is just a different number for the quantity that is stored. That is why scrap boxes don't stress the servers.
---
A lot of the marks are not exactly where they map says they are, this one particularly
---
It would completely annihilate all hope for any amount of server stability. Why tf do you think we don't already have an infinite stash ffs?
---
obviously someone has already done the math on the bleed of players versus the revenue of Fallout 1st. And Fallout 1st definitely outweighs the loss, given how much it costs, AND how many players open their wallets for them. Remember, this is a full priced game. The players who left, already paid for the game. So they're not likely to give a crap. 
---
Furthermore, who cares about potential future revenue (in retaining players and have them MAYBE buying Atoms), when you have upfront immediate cash in people paying out for Fallout 1st
---
Hey Arrested Development reference, I see you!
---
&gt;it was much worse at lunch
---
I found it to be much worse at breakfast. Radscorpion egg omelettes and possum bacon, ugh.
---
My suggestions only apply to stackable items. Doing this for weapons and armor would wreck the servers since they all have to be stored seperately. This is not the case for stimpacks, ammo, etc. 1000 stimpacks have the same impact on the server as 1 stimpack. It is just a different number stored on the database. THTA is why the scrap box can exist without wrecking servers
---
and while we are un the subject of stairs, how about stairs that look like they belong in a home? they do these big packs of themed building materials but the stairs get overlooked. So you end up with a nice looking normal house, for example, but with a god-awful metal staircase that makes no sense.
---
on a side note, bridges/ rope bridges would be great too. Again, we had these in FO4...
---
but how meny fluxs you sell per day?
---
fo1st already got tons of benefit   
---
PRIVATE WORLD  
---
SCRAPBOX  
---
FAST TRAVEL TENT   
---
10 $ WORTH ATOM every month   
---
FREE SKINS  
---
COOL EMOTES  
---
Do you really think fo1st need more ... benefits ? they already got most important thing in the game right now you just want to take away  benefit of scrapbox out of fo1st
---
Fast travel mats are still there and functioning for workshops
---
Doesn't sound like they're trying to do the exploit, why would they waste load time by going up to OP and shooting? Honestly, just sounds like they're trying to start PvP.
---
I disagree with mort even thiugh he is a cool guy because he is there to keep duchess company
---
No, that is not what I'm saying. I'm saying everybody should have a scrap box but to keep people from quitting the subscription, they'll need to add something extra.
---
Do you have any idea how many different types of aid items exist?
---
Some versions going round seem to involve pvp.
---
Still no Deep Pocketed for SS limbs?
---
Amen to that, those cards aren't cheap.
---
Can guille be worn with masks?
---
There were so many people in fasnacht who had no idea what i was doing. They see me hitting the robots with a fire sword and run over and melee me or shoot at me. And then they'd stop and you'd see their character doing the maths. And then they'd wander off.
---
Haha was that joke about getting ganked alot? They showed you how legacy weapons and stealth boys worked... I just sprayed coffee out of my nose!
---
To be honest....today was my first day of selling. Sold 14.
---
well yes. but they are already being stored in the normal stashbox. So I don't see the difference. Storing 1 aid item in the stashbox or in some kind of other box wouldn't make a difference for the server. There are also many types of scrap in the scrap box and it works.
---
I also hoped they would give 1st players features “first”
---
Fuck the free states, I wanna see the enclave. It would be awesome to play as the villains and I would love to do so.
---
You can place 500 frog jars. You’re welcome.
---
*Seem* to involve? No offence meant at all, but it seems like you don't really know what you're talking about. Prob best not to scaremonger, unless you can provide solid proof. Again, sorry, no offence intended. Have a great day bud!
---
Never understood why they didnt make it so that person who uses the card is the one to start the event. This happens all the time and is a real nuisance. It shouldn't be able to be started by any random person who uses the computer.
---
Boo!  Ha ha ha - the Enclave can definitely be expanded upon as well.
---
Agree, specially before NPC's came back. Every storie had a dark ending. It gets over-shined by silly costumes &amp; neon floating camps.
---
Not in the main gold operations area that I could see, the wiki says it's in operations the sleeping area bit, so it must be accessable during the vault raid itself. I've already done that though so I can't go back in to check. Sorry mate.
---
QUESTION:        
---
uberlux said “If PVP was 100% optional would you not let others use PVP?”         
---
           
---
ANSWER:      
---
giantpunda said: “All I said was that I don't care so long as it doesn't affect or disadvantage those that don't want to be involved.”          
---
THEREFORE THE VERDICT IS: giantpunda supports secure optional PVP all along! What a surprise!
---
Not fuck the free states in particular but I just want to see an enclave themed update badly
---
Yes it can! Glasses also work
---
So make the servers bigger or more powerful?
---
Try using this map. I find it more accurate.  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) You can remove all markers on the side and add what you want to look for. 
---
It looks like it's closer to the tracks  https://imgur.com/J9pEnDM
---
yes exactely, this idea only works for stackable items. armor and weapons would still have a weight. that is indeed crucial.  
---
duping and exploitation: I have no idea but haven't heard of exploits with the scrap box. But yeah, that is a thing to consider (with every new thing they make actually lol)
---
2 pistols at once. Any one handed weapon for that matter.
---
Hiya I’m based in UK time zone, I can play with or without mic, I’m around lv.50, can play other games also if someone wants, just add me RMA-Nik
---
Not gonna lie, another weapon I would like to return would be the holorifle. I thought it would be good to add an obscure weapon from one of the best fallout games.
---
Glad to see this is still happening, amazing community :D
---
Rejuvenated: Effectively raises your Nerd Rage! threshold HP by raising your base HP. Be paranoid about your hunger bar tho, if you get much lower on HP than that increased 19%, losing your Well Fed bonus can leave you with 0 HP(more than 0 but less than 1) or outright kill you itself.
---
Lifegiver: Same basic concept, only it has a weaker effect and the only downside is the perk slots it uses.
---
Ricochet: Works for all projectiles, in or out of PA, at any health level. The damage it deals to enemies is completely negligible, but when it procs it's like Serendipity and completely negates incoming damage.
---
Beyond those, a healthy dose of paranoia and be mindful of the no-action cooldown time any spinning heavy gun and chainsaws have(you can't use stimpaks or do much of anything until the weapon says it's OK). Once you get staggered, you're probably going to die anyways so prevention is optimal. I believe you can spam Healing Salves during stagger, but it's been some time since I've used them so I may be wrong about that.
---
What I personally do for low HP heavy guns is use both a DPS monster and a Vampire's gun to just out-tank incoming damage. I prefer a Vampire's explosive .50 Machine Gun because it has no spin-up issues and a good magazine size. I prefer this over having 800 points in Endurance, but that does mean I die occasionally. Which is fine with me. Dying isn't a big deal to me.
---
It does happen some times upon joining a public event (i.e. Free Range) with the instructions on how to play the event. But it’s random, most of the time it doesn’t trigger the event “loading” screen, it just show a random picture I’ve taken...
---
Not sure, it's a bit clean and pristine - Probably just in-line with the Samurai Outfit. Maybe we can expect knights and ninjas soon? xD
---
How bout you not tell me what to do in my game thanks
---
Gauss rifles broke with wastelanders. Probably have to wait a long time for fixes too :/
---
First thing I do after scorched Earth is find the nearest tent (there is always at least one there somewhere) and stash that flux asap.  Very rare for the queens body to disappear and even if it does you are probably just getting a one star lead pipe anyways.  
---
Been jumped by kings I couldn't see because they were standing inside her corpse too many times.  Also not rushing her corpse gives the benefit that if there is a king, he's not going to lock onto you anyways.
---
Would love both of them tbh
---
If we can put them in the electric chair, I vote yes.
---
1: Selling scrap..enough to lure people there just like having 20000 ammo for it to only be 19999 .38 and 1 .45
---
2: Hanging around while you buy.....scrap junk...not high cap weapons or armor so not exactly a reason to wait around to see if he/she makes a significant amount from you...
---
1 and 2 equals be wary.  Think about your environment and situation in the future at others camps. It’d be very very boring to just sit for hours at your camp hoping and watching for one or two people an hour to buy 50 caps of steel or what not. 
---
I always keep an ear out for the owner If they are there and I’d they are close I’m just browsing. 
---
Such high junk camps in the future just buy 1 of what you want. Go away. Or walk around. See how they react. But junk is so plentiful I find any high junk sellers suspicious if they are hanging around. To have such numbers they’d need to be out gathering more constantly. Not sitting at home. 
---
Try accessing vendor machines at odd angles or positions or even crouch on top of them. It can buy you the seconds you need to fast travel away as they wonder how to best harm you. 
---
Standing bare faced in front of the vendor they have practiced or prepared blueprinted traps. But if you aren’t where there’s space or in an odd position they don’t expect, their blueprint gets the red shades of cannot place and they have to go sifting through the stupidest and slowest build menu of games. ...and one “oh ah” of your character gets you time to run. 
---
I don’t hang around watching people shop. I do what I came to my camp to do then go back out. They want to emote trade...f em. Everyone knows trading is dangerous....use my machines or message me or I just turn my back and head off. I expect shoppers to shop buy or not; not to but me to blindly trade out of the blue. 
---
Simple and profitable. Way more profitable than trap camps. It probably takes longer to fleece someone out of those 100 caps and steel they bought and put it back in and wait forever for someone else to fall for it than to just walk ten feet and pick up some junk and scrap it. 
---
Trap camps to garner junk and keep caps are childish and stupid and pointless.  And...just plain lazy. 
---
Trap camps as far as puzzling mazes of death are interesting and have entertainment value. 
---
But...for every 5 year old that has grown out of their simplistic “gotcha” vendor trap camp there’s a new player regressing into thinking they’ve come up with SUCH a great plan to make caps!
---
i think there are 77 total rewards from SCORE that arent caps/scrip/bullion/atoms
---
Mirelurk kings just friggin kill you. What does this level 520 do when I see one?
---
Run. Then die.
---
If u want a high health build junkies. Low health bloodied (Bloodied has superior damage)
---
I’ll be honest, I’m level 102, and not once, EVER have I been able to successfully sneak. I have been under-encumbered, chameleon traits, stealth boy (all versions) but as soon as I get within 5 feet of an enemy, the turn round and spot me. I have no idea what’s happening.
---
Fallout 76 is not for hoarders.
---
how about a legendary 'fix it good' card that fixes the game
---
This is not singleplayer game this is multiplayer game we all pay for it  this is not **your** game what you want will affect me so I can say what I want bout you
---
Yes i got this bug in Vault 79 Mission. Got danger from a Ghul,killed him and the rest of the Mission i was on danger Status. That was for 20min.
---
Yep.it comes and goes.  When it happens to me, I move somewhere with no enemies, then unequip my agility perks, exit pip boy, then reequip my perks.   That usually resets it after fast travel
---
I would recommend Bloodied but still use an aae shotgun since shotguns don't have armor penetration. 
---
Still a Bloodied build because you get  still more damage and armorpenetration then Junkie.
---
Also use emergency protocols on your PA for extra tankyness
---
Obviously i mean my gameplay numbnuts
---
PS4?
---
and this poor decision shall define you for the rest of your life as 'noob'

And if you read any of my messages i i said i had issues with the game biggest one being storage and that i still like the game. And i do not care about your gaming experience. I pay money for my experience so i will voice my opinion and if it somehow changes your experience that will be damn surprising as i am only one person but i would not care.
---
It says that it includes the items even if you already own them. Probably need to quit buying
---
it doesn't affect crafting as you can still add perk cards for crafting. I have 6 int and can still do all my crafting. and run with scrapper and Gunsmith 5 when not crafting. whilst under the influence of Marsupial.
---
People dont care about pvp so i dont care about pve
---
I have been having the problem where my crit shots say they deal all their damage, and the bar visually drops, then after leaving VATS the enemy is still alive with full hp.
---
Most likely, but if it's locked NPCs/allies won't
---
I sincerely doubt that anyone stores aid items in their stashbox. I keep all of my misc aid items on a mule, and any I haven't transferred over in my character inventory. If the option suddenly opened up for everybody to be able to store every type of aid item in a specific container, server quality would go down significantly. The vast majority of players either don't pick up or immediately sell any aid/ammo they don't use.
---
Vampires shotgun and enforcer as a back up for me personally.
---
Thanks for getting back.  Before I went to sleep I figured out how to get it with a few glitches.  Nothing too insane, but still works.
---
Air ship base.
---
i would collapse at a TK42B
---
no everybody don't need scarpbox I am day one player I never pay for fo1st and I can still play game is it easy ? no. but nobody say thing will be easy when you start playing this game no matter what lots of people stop paying for fo1st if they just make it for everybody   
---
.Some people don't need cosmetic item If they  add another QOL to fo1st people will want it to non fo1st  because of what happend to fo1st   
---
People will want refund are you gonna pay those people I don't think bethesda want to pay for it
---
Interesting, I can’t seem to even get the groups of 400+ levelled players to stop one shotting every legendary enemy in events. Downright awful assholes exist too. Imagine Bethesda actually nerfed their op stupid weapons.. maybe actually levelling to the player or finally brought in level 5 legendaries..
---
I do store a lot of aids in my stash. If you're right about 'the vast majority', you could have a point.
---
You can spam "collect" when it's going through it's animation and collect a TON of dirty water without gaining rads, unlike in a river.  You can complete the Collect Water daily atom challenge in a few seconds.  It's not a hugely useful feature, but other than that, it looks nice.
---
Never seen serums for 200-350c while vendorhopping. Lowest I've seen so far was 500c.
---
I take 600c for mine, if you don't like the price then feel free to continue hopping!
---
This is intended. If your camps were super close you'd get huge frame drops (or outright crashes) and you'd both be exposed to the stash steal glitch as wellm.
---
This is the most likely real answer.
---
I honestly feel real sad for you.
---
I hope you find other wins in your life because if this is it...
---
You know I hear about griefers but after playing in the public server for almost 4 months pretty much everyday I have only been griefed (I think) once. I was standing next to a bunch of parked cars and a guy started sniping them from a distance so they blew up and almost killed me. It was actually pretty fun to try to run out of the parking lot with all the cars exploding. I have had FAR MORE interactions with very kind and generous folks. One dropped me a level 5 laser rifle and 1000 rounds for it just as I left Vault 76.
---
Just try and get a refund on the bundle. Most likely you will get the refund, if you haven't spammed about refunds in the past, and get to keep the bundle.
---
power armor with low health benefits from emergency protocols and bloodied only whereas out of powerarmor you have several more low health benefits and with a good armor set you get good damage resistance that is similar to pa dr.
---
playing with powerarmor on full health with junkies ... not much that can go wrong here.
---
at this time all shotguns with instigating, stalkers, junkies and medics as 1* and/OR  have 2* bodypartdamage, 33vats or bash damage are doing much more damage as intended (while using vats only).
---
Found it, thank you. This map seems a lot better. 
---
The node wasn’t sunk into the ground like they usually are so it was harder to find!
---
I'm astounded we don't have interior walls already. My CAMP is 90% of the reason I'm still playing after a year, but improvements are long overdue.
---
more storage means more server issue more server issue means worse game experince now stop being selfish brat with your dumb VoIcE
---
Why...?
---
You know they're not going to give you a refund for that reason.
---
If you're going shotgun you may as well go gauss. If you haven't already. And then it doesn't really mattter if you're junkies or bloodied as you're gonna be one shotting nearly everything anyway.
---
There is a train on the tracks there. Go to the front of the train. There is a fiecracker berry plant there. Go to the firectacker plant and look up. There is an overhanging ledge up there. It's up there.
---
There is a pretty decent ore run around the mountain there.
---
Here’s where I can say:      
---
Fuck you for arguing against my idea on a shit basis and dragging a rant in for over 6 hours now over my wording. You are with a doubt the slimiest person I have ever had to deal with.    
---
I posted an Idea, I have an obligation to respect criticism. But you just wanted a fucking argument. Go to hell.
---
Happened to me two days ago too.
---
I managed to find the deposit thanks to another commenter but I’m just starting to explore this area properly it’s really nice.
---
Cheers!
---
It's a known bug and usually involves skipping dialogue.
---
Are you skipping dialogue?
---
Good to dream and keep Bethesda thinking. They eventually have to get to the camp SOON, Right?
---
I have a sinking feeling we won't even see a sink. The worst part you have a bunch of wall-less homes or floating platforms because people don't have a budget to build a REAL home.
---
Bundles I think are aimed at newer players who haven't much of a collection yet. Except of course the premium new bundles with all unique items. 
---
Just need to slow down and check the description, not easy I know as the Atom Store UI is not easy to navigate.
---
you "cant belive the negativity fir this game"? you said it by yourself in the begging - you spend only 175 hours in here. Give it some time... you'll hate it like the rest of us xD
---
Literally everything from workshops in base Fallout 4.  It's pathetic we don't have them.
---
A .50 anti-materiel rifle.  Not a skin.
---
The return of casual clothing, headgear and accessory stats.  I miss helmet stats, and it would be nice if hats, and clothes gave SPECIAL bonuses like they used to.
---
175 hours for $40 is more than enough for me on itself.
---
I can be whatever i want pal. Like i said my opinion will not change anything so just stop being a prick and trying to tell me what to do in my gameplay of the game everyone who plays has obviously. Everyone has dislikes in this game and voices their opinions about changes they want made. So so not go telling you get on every post and claim they hate the game and tell them to stop playing or improve their play? Like what? Ridiculous.
---
I agree, I'm constantly torn between getting rid of it because it's annoying and loving it because dashing around like a ninja is really fun in a full party with strange in numbers boosting everything up to hyper speed
---
Do we know yet are these unlocked character specific or for all account characters?
---
Do* me*
---
Really what they should have done is advertise it primarily on being a monthly atom subscription since that is really what it is at its core. Then from there they should have kept it as cosmetic bonuses only.
---
Personally I was against it when it first came out as well, I didn't get the membership till after wastelanders dropped. But it made sense for me only because I'm heavily vested into camp building, and I like the atom shop cosmetics.
---
Really fallout 1st was created to get people to buy atoms on a regular basis, it's a business technique used fairly often to generate revenue that can be more easily forecasted because atom sales can be sporadic.
---
What Bethesda needed back when they dropped fallout 1st and that whole fiasco wasn't really fallout 1st, it was quality content. If they had been better at dropping quality content into their shop, at more reasonable prices, they probably wouldn't have felt the need for fallout 1st. Handling servers and making content costs money, live service games require continuous revenue in general, so they rely on 1 of 2 methods. 1 being microtransactions and 2 being subscriptions for service. Since they failed to create content at a fair price they created fallout 1st to give incentive to buy atoms. A lot of this was bad marketing, and bad decisions at its base made for the rest.
---
I don't believe fallout 1st is for everyone, for someone like me who regularly buys from the atom shop it makes sense, but for someone who doesn't buy from the atom shop it doesn't.
---
On another note I will say that I dont agree with the repair kits and scrap kits, those should be obtainable as drops in game as well, beyond the ones dropped by the SBQ.
---
So I agree, Bethesda could have done better, but a lot of this comes down to bad decisions that came well before fallout 1st ever dropped, fallout 1st was their way out of a mess they created, that kinda created a bigger one. Maybe next time they decide to do a project like this, they will figure it out, maybe.
---
Change your build, get a build of your own.
---
Those bloodied build are boring, all the same.
---
Okay, so now it sounds like you're changing your story. If you were hanging around the Workshop still are you absolutely positive the other player had taken control of the Workshop? If you keep entering the Workshop area while it's being claimed the attacking player can keep killing you without penalty. You're essentially fighting to keep the Workshop every time you set foot back in the area while it's under attack. 
---
Workshop owners can only attack other players if they try to claim the workshop. It's possible for a player to start claiming a Workshop, kill the owner, step outside the area until the counter ticks back up and then repeat the process of claiming, killing, and backing out if the owner respawns in the area. It's possible that's what happened here, but I can't really say.
---
You only lose caps and junk when killed by another player. Your caps loss are equal to your level. Considering you can easily make 1400 caps a day even as a level 2 I would say it's overdramatic to say you're losing half your total caps unless you're just constantly going back to get slaughtered an insane amount of times or you should probably look up a guide to earning caps. I don't know where your plans went, but chances are if you didn't see any new plans they were likely just repeat plans.
---
Ah yes I could have done that I’ll let them drone on in future. Good to know it’s a bug many thanks for your help ✅
---
popped poop
---
Yep, that's a good one.
---
If you're already a junkie I would keep it. Start working on some heavy gun perks.
---
Had this happen about a week ago. Ended up dying because I wasn't paying attention to my health continuing to drain after the event finished, and then the only place I could respawn was vault 76 where it continued to drain.
---
Ended up restarting the game to fix it. I used my survival tent to dump junk just before the event started so that was lucky I guess.
---
Congrats! I'm still hunting this one!
---
I want a form of Dog meat and maybe a cat that can pick off those dumb mole rats. Maybe a really BIG house cat.
---
I would like some war games. One team makes and defend a fort while another team attacks. Hold the fort (workshop).
---
I now have 5 pieces of Unyielding on main giving high agility, with the arms shadowed and legs muffled I removed the sneak perk for dodgy and can sit amongst mobs and until I engage they just wander around me.
---

i know how to make walls fly in my camp
---
Yea give us a radio host called one dog. he could be his great great something or other to Three dog.
---
Marsupial + Class freak (max) + Strange in Numbers + Herd Mentality + a friend = the most fun I have had in this game.
---
Getting Herd Mentality was the biggest chore. That is an extremely underrated mutation.
---
1. Stealth
---
2. Serendipety
---
3. Stimpak: Super or Cooked Scorchbeast meat with Carnivore mutation.
---
4. Abuse bugged life giver &amp; speed demon combo
---
It uh really didn’t live up to the fallout killer hype tbh I thought I would love it but it was bland and full of game crashing bugs lol
---
I feel your pain, I like the contemporary camp bundle, i've wanted that contemporary house kit ever since i saw them and wasn't aware they were part of a bundle, that same bundle contains the contemporary floors and flagstone wallpaper sets that i think i spent 500 atoms on each.   
---
Pretty frustrating now for me to see this contemporary bundle pop up for 1200 atoms and i physically can't bring myself to buy the whole set because i've already dropped a huge chunk of atoms on the floor/walls that come with the bundle, but cant buy the house kit separately.
---
i know how to make walls fly 
---
and with that same technique, i built vault 88 under a bridge near gorge's junkyard 
---
look for the 64 on the map
---
Cool. Thanks for the info!
---
Lighting is important, line of sight to. Artificial lights will expose you, daylight will not so much.
---
Only problem is i don't think it's been updated in a long time so there might be some mistakes now.
---
If you are on PS4, I would love to buy your dupe plans. I don't have any of them
---
Sorry my bad I should’ve said xbox
---
Ye I can do that w my team it will be a couple of hours tho
---
Honestly it just seemed like they over hyped it, everyone was calling it the fallout killer etc even the developers threw shade at fallout, the game somehow had even less armor and weapon details/ mods than obsidians fallout and somehow they made characters even more boring than in fallout, and I just disliked how factions in OW were made out to like don’t piss them off or else! And basically once you leave the planet you never saw them again
---
Yeah I know, I made a post years ago about the same thing. I’ve been in all situations, in shadows, poorly lit areas, to the side of enemies, directly behind them, entered sneak just before getting to them, been in sneak a good 20 meters away before getting to them... nothing works, only able to get ranged sneak attacks. Even had perk equipped for being harder to detect.
---
Just another visual bug the game is full of them, so are their websites it seems🤷‍♂️
---
Fun maybe for one play through ( aside from the glitch on the final level that would hard crash your game lol) but I tried a second play through and saw choices mattered even less than other games and I just I couldn’t get past how bland and lame guns/armor were
---
I have it never used it, cheesy and bragging.
---
Awol is one of my faves. Really quick, 3* at the end. Sometime you get waves of 10+ most of the time it's just 1 enemy though haha
---
Man. Fuck Rose. I never want to talk to that robot again. Please don't let her be involved.
---
Every now and then an enemy can bug out and put you in constant danger. It goes away once you leave the area. It does suck when it happens. I have been a stealth rifleman for 400 lvls. Only a handful of times this has happened.
---
Honest question, Im new to the sub - how do I chat with people? Is it somewhere in the social menu? Or only at their camp?
---
They don’t have to have it just have to be on your friends list.
---
Sounds like it's time to relocate.
---
I would just buy the actual Serum first, make sure you have the Luck card maxed which stops you from losing it. Then when you have loads of caps gets the recipe.
---
Oh. What a shame. I was planning on leaving the Ammo Factory on collecting ammo. Disappointed
---
Nobody likes those.
---
So ive been running sneak for pretty much over a year now, and here a few things I've noticed.
---
This bug has been around a while, there isnt much to get around it other than taking off some of your sneak perks and hopping servers, then putting them back on. I've seen a bunch of speculation on what actually causes it, I believe its something to do with escape artist perk bugging out and doing the opposite of what its supposed to.
---
I stopped using escape artist on my build, it keeps the permanent danger bug at bay for the most part. 3 sneak is pretty much all you need, and if you are really hurting for getting away from enemies, pop a stealthboy. (There is a loot path to get 5 a day from top of the world pretty quick, takes 5 min)
---
Sometimes, you will be forced into danger no matter what.im not sure if its intentional, it probably isn't, but in certain events you will always be in [danger]. Biggest example is radiation fever when the sulervisors show up, ill be hidden and know exactly when the legendary spawns because ill go straight to danger. Then right back to hidden when Its killed. There are quite a few moments like this, mirelurk hunters lock on to you with the best stealth, scorchbeasts sonic blast you with pinpoint accuracy even when in caution, a few events you'll be in danger the whole time no matter what....
---
The bug was supposed to be patched, and sort of was since its gotten better, but hasn't been fixed.
---
Hey baby, you ever get your quest given to you by a fat man in a trench coat!
---
It comes with the Settler bundle.
---
Flat out stinks of estrogen? Lol calm down half the faction quests are them flat out getting desperate and losing everyone and having a last ditch effort but still failing and dying
---
Make them a brotherhood recon rifle too. You can make them level 5 and they’re amazing for the level lol
---
Thank you
---
In terms of narrative I think it would be an engaging idea to make the Pioneer Scouts an evil faction in Fallout 5. Make them a perversion of Lord Baden-Powell’s original scouting ethos, a twisted version that regards all other factions as slavers, and is bent on world domination in the name of “emancipation” to a new order that is fascist, and more authoritarian than the Scouts themselves. I think FNV missed a trick by making the NCR good and Caesar’s Legion bad - the NCR, while at first appearing progressive, could have revealed their intolerance and bigotry gradually over the course of the game, while the Legion, at first appearing barbaric, could have been revealed as a cohort of people adhering to an ascetic life in the belief that it would deliver the world from barbarity.
---
....nothing, and I think you need to come back with a warrant sir...
---
Good news as the survival meters are being removed and instead food, water etc just gives you a boost like previous games
---
Isn't that because the environment around there is too hostile to create actual settlements? Like, if you're going to choose somewhere for you and your family to live, it won't be next door to the scorchbeasts and fog crawlers.
---
That’s why I stay at the terminal when I activate it.
---
I posted My Idea, I have an obligation to respect criticism and reply where I can to support my idea. But you just wanted a fucking argument.
---
I’m sorry that my original post sounded threatening. I hope reviewing it shows you I didn’t Intend an idea of “lets force people to pvp”.           
---
I will be trying a third time tomorrow to post this idea at a recommended busy period. I don’t mind if you want to make a comment to warn people about exploits.       
---
Please have a think in your spare time about “players in teams fighting each other that can not hurt you.”        
---
Even imagine the possibilities with factions etc.    
---
and combat between players may not be balanced, this will not likely ever change. But there are levels of how well a build fights, with multiple strategies.          
---
People who have not invested their character at all for pvp combat, will only have a fair fight with one of the same. PVP is complex.     
---
Fallout PVP unlike many games requires you to pick your fights carefully, in a world with people of all different strengths.
---
That makes sense, thank you.
---
It didn't take anything away from the other quests involving posters for me. I still found them in the world tbf.
---
I agree 100% - I'm free states all the way, place the flag every time I take a workstation....  
---
I even had stickers made  [https://imgur.com/a/jX1DSJa](https://imgur.com/a/jX1DSJa)
---
That 10mm heavy cannon from NV Lonesome Road. And maybe the Red Glare.
---
I really want a heavy weapon that I can use to just burn up all my low caliber ammo.
---
Also, gimme the Wattz Laser rifle from FO1 and the FO3 Sniper Rifle.
---
Plenty of people does not mean its getting done.  
---
Been at this event enough times to see this.
---
My camp feels very much like a New York loft conversion due to the lack of interior walls
---
I've got over 1,000 hours in game, and I've only been to maybe 3 trap camps.
---
I have that gun, and it rocks. I one shot most of the time with it.
---
I don't disagree generally. But if it's there, this is why I'd want in it.
---
I got one at the eastern end of the tram in the monorail elevator
---
Yeah, don't come crying to reddit because you were banned from that facebook group. 
---
Quite rightly so I might add.
---
Haha i open reddit and the first thing I see on my birthday is "Happy birthday..."
---
Ricochet, very underdog perk.  Love using this perk on two of my builds.
---
Still trying to add PVP into a player base that mostly wants nothing to do with it. Cool.
---
 I have absolutely no interest in PVP on a game that heavily relies on legendary gear and not skill.  It's going to be popular at 1st but once a couple teams establish themselves and have the best gear in the game nobody's going to want to play or fight them anymore and it will die out as survival did.
---
 Gear based PVP is the worst kind of PVP.
---
Happy birthday to u also
---
To be fair, you were definitely helping him out too. Especially at higher levels, you can easily acquire/craft massive amounts of items that you can’t store. I do it a lot.
---
That is a great weapon.  One of my top 3 favorites.
---
Fatman in a trench coat... is that a new Legendary effect?
---
I would love to have a go at trap camps,I just never find any!
---
Cancelling FO1st and stopping auto-renewal work the same way.  
---
Easier on the PS App rather than the website.
---
Open the app, centre button in the bottom bar.  
---
Go to PS Store  
---
Click your profile image in the top right  
---
Subscriptions Management
---
It should be there. Cancel it, and you will still have FO1st until what would have been the auto-renewal date. But it **will not** auto-renew, if you do this.
---
Let me know how it goes.
---
Couldn't believe how quick it was.
---
I would also like to have Jen as an ally.
---
I tried everything - even went so far and used a low level, pulse modded plasma rifle to drain their cores, hoping they would jump out. But they just keep slow-walking and don’t give a shit :(
---
That’s exactly why I don’t use it or speed demon. If I get it, I won’t be able to play without it.
---
I've done that event around 30 times. Done perfect runs about 9 because everyone farm legendaries instead of doing the actual event. Still ain't got that...
---
One question sir:         
---
                  
---
If PVP was running as an optional event for players who do want to play pvp, and it is 100% optional.         
---
Would you still be against letting other people compete in PVP against each other, even if it did not effect you at all?
---
I saw a fallen tree in a park yesterday, I was wondering how many wood scraps I'd get from it
---
The T65 helmet uses the T60 mods for some reason afaik
---
issue #1. they dont want you downloading files from another persons system. it allows people to send viruses.
---
issue #2. they do not own the hardware so they cant install virus scanning software on a console or pc. and those companies will not give them permission to add one.
---
issue #3. they are not virus software makers so they cant do it on their end. it would cost a fortune for them to design , produce and maintain said program and staff for free.
---
issue #4. the game does not contain photo editing software. its not designed to edit and rescale your photos to fit the scale of the frames.
---
issue #5. creating and storing duplacte images and then sending them goes back to issue #1.
---
its a huge mess of worms. and thus why we dont see the options on any games. they legally do not want the hassle.
---
That’s my struggle.  I’d give away L stuff except it’s always so outleveled.
---
For me, it really opens the game up. I won't play without it.
---
Being ae to jump on top of something to avoid danger, scale a cliff, or just general mobility when exploring. 
---
Id say its the equivalent of getting a flying mount in other games, you don't know how crippled you've been until you get it.
---
I would've booted you, too.  
---
You sound like a complete asshole.
---
Dang , you could have sold that on Ebay for like 200 bucks .
---
What the other guy said you can find a big ledge and place yours up there and his below, you can meet in the middle and do a like Floatingish base.
---
My friend and I did manage to get our bases slightly closer maybe a 3 second run from each other, in the dried up lake I don’t think we did anything special I placed mine and he placed his it was nice because we had a third friend place his so we had sort of a triangle style going.
---
As long as there are no special rewards that can't be earned without pvp'ing then no would'nt bother me. 
---
 I just don't see it happening because the developers know the majority of players want nothing to do with PVP.
---
I play monster mash every single time I see it which would be a prime opportunity for PVP but nobody ever does it.
---
I think you are part of a small very vocal minority.
---
My base is a kinda fancy lake house. it's on the water, a pier type walk leading out over the water to the house. v nicely decorated inside, not boujie but classy. nice front porch to watch the nukes drop near watoga.
---
i use a  3 star anti armor glow sighted plasma bow. if the acc issue with the vats was fixed i would use it all day every day. but the realiabliity of a weapon is the most important part in a sneak build. if i have to fire at you more then once. it bypasses the purpose of a stealth build. when i hit. i hit like a tank. but to know i personally could make the shot in rl with my eyes closed and in game my toon just cant grasp the consept of not botiching a release
---
People don’t like to check anything unless their favorite YouTuber says it, especially with this game my god I remember everyone saying things that weren’t even remotely true at all but would refuse to even discuss it.
---
Same here, I deleted this game so many times before, and I download it back again and again. Same goes for fallout 4. When I go online I go to hunter’s vile and west tech to kill some mutants then roll a legendary then I log off, I check the market place and get rejected a lot. Then I go to sleep at 4am. I hate myself for loving this game so much.
---
High agility seems to be the most important factor, besides the relevant perk cards. You can get up to like 40 agility which should render you effectively invisible, think I got up to 39 myself with my stealth set+buffs and I only get spotted if I'm crouched in place right in front of them.
---
Do you have a miners lamp on? Or in general are you walking around looking like a hot little piece of lamp?
---
Thats probably it.
---
If PVP came as team death match, teams are mixed which defeats your gear basing issue.    
---
Some matches might have a full team of OP players but there would be control measures and it wouldn’t effect every match. You could just server hop if that server was being dominated, this worked in survival too.      
---
I believe a successful pvp development requires rewarding wins instead of punishing losses. I believe this contributed to the unpopularity of survival. Not only was there little gain, but huge loss.        
---
But obviously pvp events should work like normal events. No crazy exclusive rewards. Just a small prize to cover the ammo and friendly competitive team sport.
---
MESSAGES.
---
i mean this in itself encourages more social ability than pure MIC talk and as someone who is has high anxiety the idea of jumping on mic with randoms is horrifically crippling.
---
give me PC text chat dammit.
---
Yup. I had some good stuff and none of it even went for like 250 caps, I ended up dropping it all to listed value, some as low as 90 caps, still no one was bothered. 
---
Cleared it out totally for the space and sold it to duchess as it literally never sold. Transitioned to only keeping 3 star weapons for scrip or actual weapons. Mostly sell serums and ammo now.
---
I learned that now. I dump so much every day.
---
Ya had me till u used “clapped back”. Ugh that phrase is so cringe.
---
The 30th
---
Disable grass?
---
i do
---
Used to always be multiple in a wave, least before I quit when they started nerfing weapons.  Somewhere along the way they probably broke something that causes singles to sometime spawn.
---
Weird, something tells me that everybody clapped.
---
No. The 30th
---
I believe it has to do with the age of the server. A fresh server gets more per wave. The older servers just get 1. But I'm not sure on that. Just something someone else told me
---
I have a cracked death law egg on display, its with my other "cool animal parts"
---
Could this be the reason for why my game is no longer starting? Tried the repair already but my local files are apparently fine .
---
I had to raise my price for fluxes to 400 just to keep from selling too much.  It still sells pretty fast.
---
Does using a private work if I don’t have a friend to help?
---
Used to baññen all the time ho me so what I do now is launch a nuke at the queen and if the server has good players and we kill her with ease after thatIll start encrypted and alm the players just jump right in so no problem in having to wait for people go join
---
There are, however for supply purposes you're probably better off with a camp near some larger abandoned structures. The cap economy makes scavenging more lucrative than buying resources.
---
The best you'll get is foundation or creater. Though any train station would work as well
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Also the LAER Laser Rifle from the Big MT. That was my favorite for a while.
---
Yeah, you can turn it off in the ini file.
---
They said in their AMA a couple months back that theres an update planned for CAMPs but I dont remember seeing anything after that. 
---
Hopefully we can get some news on that soon.
---
The packs were previously released. At that time many of the items were able to be bought separately, it's only a revisit of the bundles at a discounted price.
---
I have probable cause; I can see your chem lab and I'm fairly certain you are in possession of stolen and/or illegal exotic weapons, you dirty wastelander! Lol
---
If it has been weeks since anything good then why didn't you save your atoms?
---
I agree with you about them needing to implement some of these things but as a fellow developer I can tell you these "small" things take up much more time then you'd think. Depending on how they setup their systems ofcourse.
---
Also the developers probaply want to implement these things but are probaply asked to develop other things Bethesda finds more important.
---
Gonna be "that guy" but just because YOU don't like stuff, doesn't mean OTHER PEOPLE can't like them.
---
Black titanium is in mole miner scrap???
---
Yeah that’s been around for a long time and happens every now and then. Just switch servers. If it persists, just close the game and restart it
---
Jens got a certain style that I can respect. Ya know?
---
It's much cheaper to just buy it off a player vendor, you can reliably find them for 300-500 caps and they usually have multiple vials for sale.  So it'll still be cheaper to buy a few that way unless you have **a** **lot** of friends.
---
These will probably be the ‘cool camp features’ they referred to coming later in the year. Not entirely joking.
---
They should make it so dropping mini nukes on plants will irradiate them. Finally would give the fat man a use.
---
Saw a guy wanted for 50 caps last night, went to his camp and saw a locked door he was behind. It had the small cooking station half clipped though the door. 
---
"Let me guess, I use the cooking station, and there is about 20 pungi boards stacked up on the other side that kill me" 
---
"No, please don't kill me" 
---
I stashed my junk in the box he had outside.... used the cooking station, yep, pungi boards.
---
Not bad overall, predictable but effective. People hate trap bases, but i love them when they are clever.
---
I've had the same. The sound goes out with a black screen but the UI is still there? Happens every once in a while. Extremely annoying.
---
Yes! Or at least have her roaming around Crater
---
B2525?
---
Worst thing players do to me is delete legendaries before I can run 5 yards to get a view of them once they spawn in events.
---
Its on PS4 too.
---
I would love that!
---
Thanks it worked:D
---
I never miss awol, when i'm server hopping its the first event i check for, I've noticed the more participants the bigger the waves and better chance of more legendaries, theres also a sentry bot that spawns nearby for a good chunk of xp, grats on the weapon that faster reload is a perfect attribute for a lever action
---
I guess they mean the original ones, which looked like a metal gauntlet and were powered by fusion cells.
---
I haven't done Radiation Rumble seriously yet, but due to my build if I shot at the Ghouls' legs I'd probably kill them before I crippled their legs. For that reason it's more efficient for me to shoot heads. 
---
Not everyone has limb damage weapons, and not everyone's built for shotguns, so for a lot of people intentionally crippling a limb is off the table.
---
I got rid of my armor on my junkies heavy PA build.  Outside PA i use the CSA and inside I use shielded underarmor for extra stat boost.
---
It the above doesn’t work go to your Wallet and turn off auto renew. It was the only way I was able to cancel my Monthly FO 1st subscription. Be aware It will turn off auto renew for all subs so turn it back on after the FO 1st renew date has passed.
---
No proof or science here, but many believe that if your health is low while crafting, the game somehow knows you probably want unyielding and it will give you many more vanguards etc.  If your health is high, you get more unyielding, etc.  No proof, but many do swear this happens.  In my experience, I believe they may be onto something.
---
How did you get the girders to snap to the corners of those blocks?
---
Help me out here, why do you say a radioactive barrel
---
You sound ugly.
---
All legacies are broken. That’s why there legacies.  
---
BES needs to fix them already like they stated over a year ago.
---
You only need to be 3/4 or 4/4 to be in reward tier for rad barrel and rad suit. The higher tier gets better odds though. 
---
Also your comment about 100+ not crippling the ghouls seems pretty ignorant. If you see me single handedly holding down by sides go run and get ore. I am at the event to get free legendaries and a ton of exp. The bonus is a chance at great rewards. 
---
You should play to your strengths and not judge other players on how they play .
---
If you’re looking for places with high foot traffic and NPC vendors also nearby, there are a few “trading spot” I would recommend. 
---
1. Whitespring station- has always been the trading spot and is still a popular place to camp. You have Whitespring close by or the vendor not at the station. 
---
2. Crater or foundation- NPC vendors, close to the gold machines, and lots of foot traffic from people visiting them each day. 
---
3. The Wayward- vendors, foot traffic, plus a great spot to help low level players. 
---
4. Watoga station- two vendors, and good foot traffic after queen fights.
---
I, a level 80something can reliably solo this with a stealthsuit and a two star handmade, i always wondered why so many people seem to have a problem doing this until i realised 90% of you have a bloodied build and cant tank all three pylons at once.
---
Wait for what?
---
I'm hoping that with the Brotherhood returning, Free States and Responders would also come and make an fully alliance to stop the Scorched and other Enclave plans. The first try failed but now is the chance.
---
I'm fine with those perks as well as long as they don't take the spot of another better thought out perk. That being said, I doubt they invested much time on them so it's not like adding one perk competes with adding another. It just feels like it.
---
Nice work bud.
---
Dang I would love to see that.
---
Weasel and Jen need to be allies tbh
---
I would love to see that base
---
You were probably just unlucky, on PS4 I only bump into a couple trap camp per week, you got three in one night. Could be on the rise though, since Bethesda is killing pvp scam in the next patch, they can’t come up with a better one than trap camp.
---
Weird. I did heart of the swamp. I put a couple hundrer rounds of gauss minigun in to the 3* strangler Queen and it did almost nothing. First death in weeks on my part. I normally take little to no damage from acid. For some reason the kings Don’t fuck me up like i hear everyone else talk about. 
---
I run a power armor build
---
Unless you are selling them for 500-2000+ caps a piece. Then it’s a horrible investment and you won’t know why you’ve been around a while.
---
Yeah. I have sort of a lake house but can't build anywhere closer to water because its close to a marker.
---
If we get anyone from The Wayward, it needs to be Bessie.
---
Stomps foot and pounds table, "Damit, it's a Camp, Not a house! Damn apocalyptic hipsters!"
---
But seriously, I like building, you get meh up vote.
---
Yeah I'll go with the T-45 for the Medic Power Armor, just need to add the logo on it. Also it's a shame you can't have the Mr.Gutsy voice in the helmet
---
**B**loodied
---
**25** faster fire rate
---
**25** less vats cost
---
The bees knees of weapons basically. You get one of those and you're set for life.
---
I might do that as well when I get round to making it, I just need some room in my Stash box. Also it's a shame you can't have the Mr.Gutsy voice in the helmet
---
You can usually find them in player vendors for 300-500. That’s a pretty good investment for all your characters. Definitely look into for yourself. 
---
You say you don’t want to use it because you won’t be able to play without it, but honestly idk how you can play often WITHOUT these obviously useful mutations. Crippling your gameplay for a weird reason seems short sighted. 
---
If you are on Xbox I’ll give each of your characters a set for free.
---
~~NCR T-45 please. I’ll never use T-45 but if they ever release PA displays...~~
---
Vault tec stairs are required for ANY build to look semi okay.
---
Wow. Thanks
---
Perhaps, but I have never spent real money and they will come back, so if you don't have enough atoms, buy what you can and wait for the sale and save up. On that note, you should have been saving up your atoms for the last 3 weeks, then this would almost be a non issue.
---
  
---
Also people don't HAVE to own everything in the game, it's hilarious and suits Bethesda perfectly, that your MUST have everything in the store. 
---
I have 4 characters and I buy when I can afford, the stuff I really want, I know I can't get everything, that's life .. and yeah I agree, it is lame of Bethesda to remove items from the store, they losing out on so much revenue.
---
GTA do something similar but work on weekly sales, but everything generally remains in the store but not on sale, so people can still choose to buy shark cards or earn money to buy them ..
---
All I want is the option to shut them all up 🤯🤯
---
But...you only have to rebuild when you move camp spots. That’s just telling you that somebody else has their camp there and would be conflicting with yours.
---
Dude, air out the basement .. you need oxygen
---
We need high-level, hard to kill enemies....just throw on some Troubleshooter armor, aim for her legs &amp; she'll go down hard and fast.
---
You’re really lucky, all i get from awol is one star melee and junk armors. I got the exact same roll from a ghoul in cranberry borg.
---
Yeah i started yesterday but i was server hopping for hours... it's my only chance to get the weapon I'm looking for XD
---
Sometimes they even remain invisible while doing this, as a v.a.t.s crit sniper I hate them.
---
Are you wearing leather armor? Heavier armors make more noise so the mobs can hear you within a certain range.
---
CAMP building needs a massive overhaul, this functionality included.
---
While I agree that the Scrapbox should have been given to everyone when it came out, that ship has sailed. The scrapbox isn’t a primary driver for FO1st purchases, but it is the thing that makes them stick. Once you start using it, if you can afford it, you’ll never go back to the old limit again.
---
That stupid Scrapbox is the only reason many players stay subbed to FO1st. You can easily live without the tent, private worlds aren’t that useful, and you don’t lose your cosmetics or emotes if you quit. If everyone had the Scrapbox, few people would sub for more than a month. If you added other, similar things on a preview basis, people would just wait until they gave them away. 
---
A more realistic suggestion might be for everyone to get a Scrapbox, but have it limited to a few hundred lbs of scrap without a subscription. That would still provide some extra space and simplify inventory management without asking Bethesda to give up the one thing that keeps people hooked on their service.
---
I hope they never fix that bug
---
Can u disable grass on console
---
It does affect your crafting. Intelligence affects the base durability and size of durability bar when crafting weapons. While you can build whatever you want using perk cards the ultimate durability is often determined by your gross intelligence.
---
Additionally intelligence affects about of exp you gain with anything, so that’s a factor as well. But class freak pretty much eliminates all negatives to all mutations.
---
I get the message about 4 maybe 5 times before I get on my world. Are you saying I should relocate so I won't get the message as often  ?
---
Add escape artist, and light step. I added those 2 perks and that mostly cured the glitch.
---
929 hours played though. And this is easily the best drop i've ever had. It's probably worth double of what i've had before.
---
Lol XD If
---
After half ab hour of trying to kill the one in the burrows I gave up. I'd manage to take a chunk off its health before I die but after I've ran all the way back to the boss room it's full health.
---
Hearing you can Disable grass was all I needed to get value out of this, -- the other day I accidently stumbled on a pile that had a High Radiation Fluid, and was like huh... thats weird.
---
Thank you for your Excellent, Stealthy Service.
---
Sweat-like typing detected
---
\&gt; A wall display for the C.A.M.P. that holds the challenge badges you've earned.  
---
Stitching em onto the backpacks would be nice. or unlocking a unique skin when you have all of them. or anything.  They're a proper challenge to get, it's a bit of a letdown we can only spend "badges" as currency.    
---
\&gt; More weapon skins. Mine is a melee build so I'd like every sword, axe and bat scouted-out but at least the hatchet (it's part of the logo).   
---
Obviously need a Mr. Handy Buzzsaw skin, haha
---
Herd mentality has always been a problematic mutation. It is not affected by class freak and in a lot of cases makes a character suffer -2 to all stats. 
---
Fortunately with public teams being released this perk will prove invaluable.
---
Yea it’s a god roll/one shot wonder lol, you really don’t need anything else if you’re a rifleman build.
---
Why would you sell a mutation for that much?
---
I don't think you understand what I'm complaining about. Assaultrons are meant to have a charge time before the big laser. But when I fight them it doesn't have to. It just fires its death Ray nonstop
---
I can craft you one with expanded durability on PC. Nickname as in here.
---
U can sell the serums to vendors for 440 a piece with Hard Bargain
---
Old man that keeps saying pull my finger 😭😭😭 enough already 😂
---
Actually, I do understand. But, like any enemy in the game, despite its strength, it can still be beat.
---
If BGS tweaks the charge time, that's fine with me, but otherwise, I appreciate having actual kill-bots in the game.
---
New players don’t understand the value of serums and many players just items for their listed value.
---
God, how did I not get that? He even had the beard, haha!
---
a similar fixer for close encounters maybe
---
Especially after how big it was in 4. At least half the mods I ever see for 4 are workshop mods.
---
Some more fence variety would be cool
---
All I want is BIV
---
I think a lot of the hate came from people that first and foremost enjoy playing an engaging storytelling that includes interesting characters.  FO3, FO4, and NV definitely had that going for it.
---
FO76 at release only had some holotapes, terminal text, and the most personality I saw out of any NPC's were Rosie and MODUS.  Maybe I'm missing someone else but the cast was pretty bare.  Combined with going solo I think it turned a lot of folks off the game.
---
But if you enjoy the combat, and the game loop of exploring, killing stuff, and scavenging junk it's still the same core Fallout game.  But now you can play with friends.  And that's a load of fun.
---
Yeah no worries mate, glad you got it.
---
I tried it twice, they acknowleged the bug but they havent given me jackshit.
---
Seems to me that with how annoyed people are with Commander Daguerre’s repetition of dialogue, the charm of Weasel’s voice would wear of fast. She’s a good character and I enjoyed working with her, but a little goes a long way.
---
This gun can handle any crowd without problem, especially if you use the Chinese Stealth armor. The only other thing you may add is a fast-firing heavy gun to solo the queen.
---
Yeah, those are the Assaultron Dominators - I really dislike when I get hit by multiples of those in the Silo.
---
Assaultrons are supposed to fight you in melee combat for a short time before they charge their laser. In fo76 they don't have a charge time and can use it whenever. If you think that's intended idk what to say.
---
MOOOO
---
I'm not sure what the rhyme or reason is, but I have returned to the Mire every day since last Tuesday and Queen of the Hunt has not popped up for me once since then... I've been farming that daily for months trying to get the Shielded Casual plans and this is the longest it's gone without popping.
---
what.
---
Is that the contemporary house build? Looks awesome
---
Are you thinking of the bunker addition supposedly coming ?
---
Like a loading screen into a second part of your CAMP. Hopefully also means an additional storage budget as you load off the main map.
---
That said we still need more simple additions too as has been mentioned already.
---
That would definitely make the smaller stuff a lot more viable.
---
Whoa hey whoa hey WHOA....that station is for making stimpaks man, and those weapons fell off the back of Graham’s Brahmin...
---
I recommend NMS to anyone. As an older gamer who has played since the Atari arcade era, I had not felt that sense of wonder in a game since the early ORPG era. I thought I had just become too jaded as a player but those titles are out there!
---
Cool anyone wants to try this I will add you
---
I say why not bigger than the BOS. The Free States is a phenomenally interesting group especially for the times we live in, libertarian, survivalist, sovereign citizen, government conspiracy theorists who are 100% right about everything in the world they live in. They could serve as a legitimate foil for the BOS, the Enclave, and the 'Corprate' Raiders as presented in 76.
---
Yeah, well it’s mixed. It’s not just mobs though, it can be single enemies. I think it might be my agility, it’s only at about 4/5 so maybe it’s not high enough? Still think that sneaking should be successful to SOME degree regardless of agility etc
---
They're not, you just need the right tactics or a better build to deal with them.
---
I wish they would developed further the idea with personal terminal claiming daily's. Little thing but useful
---
Everything becomes far to easy after while. Enjoy the challenge.
---
I realise I didn't word this how I wanted. I'm talking about the laser having 0 charge time and being able to be fired off infinitly
---
That's exactly the behavior I've seen - plenty of times they charge me &amp; swing their arms &amp; I've never seen them continually use their eye-beam. They will use it at long range, but do tend to melee.
---
Every enemy in the game is a puzzle - they have their strengths and weaknesses. If you are trying to kill an enemy by attacking its strength, yes, you're going to die.
---
I mean, my personal pet-peeve are Super Mutants with miniguns. Regardless of what armor I'm wearing, any level SM with a mini just chews through it.
---
Therefore, I don't fight them in the open, I don't give them the chance to spin up and fire, and I definitely aim for the head to bring them down faster.
---
A lot of people are complaining about the Assaultrons &amp; perhaps they can be tweaked, but I also see a lot of players who go into areas unprepared and don't think their way through the problem - they try to rely on brute force instead, which usually gets them killed.
---
I know right anybody that farts that much need to go to the doctor 🤣🤣🤣
---
I've encountered 4 so far and they all seemed to have a significant recharge time.  I'm just level 40 though.  Maybe higher-level spawns have shorter recharges?
---
I forgot to include the 0 laser charge time
---
it just works...
---
Shoot first :p
---
All the ones I've found walk out of the pod and blast me. Idk if it's a bug or what
---
haha, lazer go zappy zap non-stop.
---
Kind of hard when I'm a melee build
---
I think they should have the packs that are cheaper and then have all the individual items too that work out more expensive. I’m skipping these pack specifically because they have 1 or 2 items I want but don’t let me buy them separately.
---
**~~I've played the game since launch and the robot kills me everytime~~**
---
What do you mean by bridges ? Like the Vault ones ? Are you thinkingnof a mod ? I've always been vanilla but really need to use mods when I go back to FO4 as my settlements always feel limited, although I've done some crackers.
---
I know of a couple of rope bridges but never for settlements. They'd have been a terrific and simple, realistic addition to link taller builds. No doubt there is a mod with then available...😊
---
Bloodied build most likely, place it at your camp for a quick and easy source of rads to keep your health right where you want it. 
---
I've been after this plan for a while myself.
---
It might help not get the message so often, probably in a popular spot.
---
Even if you choose to stay on the world though you won't have to rebuild your camp.  It can't be placed on the current server but the next time you join one where it can be placed it will load in as normal.  No rebuilding required.
---
They were one of the coolest parts of the story because they're a uniquely 76 thing. Brotherhood, Enclave, even Raiders, they're all staples of Fallout even if they had an Appalachia flavor to them. Free States are Appalachia through and through, and I loved how they worked into the area's lore.
---
Sneak then, I run a bloodied melee build have no issue dealing with assaultron, just sneak up then whack them to death, or if you have a good build and are lucky enough to get Cavaliers armour run at them and whack them.
---
What platform are you on? I'm curious to see if it might be a platform-specific issue.
---
You need to do it when our group does it, so much fun. PKOA is awesome!!  I am ps4 but we are on all platforms, check us out on our reddit post. Tell them cyborg_mom sent ya 😉
---
No idea how to quote on here but went and grabbed this, which was a response to a budget increase question.
---
"You want it and OMG the dev team wants it, too. One of the greatest joys is sharing the wild and wacky stuff the community does with their CAMPs. But just flat out increasing the budget would have real significant performance ramifications. So it's a balancing act.
---
But we plan on doing some very fun things with CAMPs in 2020."
---
I also do remember hearing about some instanced interior like you said though which would be awesome.
---
Thanks but I'm on the PS4 unfortunately
---
This is a high quality reference right here. I see you 👀
---
Xbox
---
Ah thanks, good to know
---
I always “stay on this world” when server hopping/farming, so that change would be inconvenient for players like me.
---
Ohhh so even if I miss clicked and logged out without placing my camp It won't delete my original camp?
---
Weasel, Weasel, Weasel, Weasel !!!!
---
Am i missing something,  what packs?
---
I really liked setting up quest posters in my little settlement, because it made it feel like a point of light in the darkness. Come! Buy beer and bullets! Pick up a quest! Play some guitar with my ally before heading back into the wastes!
---
More questlines with posters is certainly a thing I want. I'd love for their to be plans that you get from a daily that cause the daily to trigger when you reread the poster you learned previously from that daily. Like a blood eagle wanted poster or something. It would be nice to have poster alternatives to use for resetting the terminal dailies as well.
---
Really the whole community should come together as a whole and hold them responsible for what they advertised. We all know that will never happen.
---
I'll get it done
---
I am on Xbox, and I'm tempted to take you up on that.  I've scrapped about 150 combat rifles and still haven't gotten that mod yet.
---
Your entire post is roasting some 8 year old and his friend because they sent you a bunch of messages . But I need to grow up lmao
---
You got it dude 🤦‍♂️✌
---
If you are shooting in first person a stagger won't stop you firing. Dot attacks are power armours one weakness, very little you can do other than spam the stim button and hope unless toy kill them first 
---
After the queen has died I always look out for a mob spawn and try to get some distance before killing mirelurk kings and hunters.
---
Serendipity doesn't work in power armour so you can move those points somewhere else, I run dodgy under agility for more tankiness
---
like how that one raider quest takes you to Watoga civic center (or whats it called) and you have to fight in the arena against waves of ghouls/floaters/... and then, thats that.... real waste of the space, they could have used the arena for a wave clear event or repeatable quest, where you have to take on as much waves as u can without dying, higher score better rewards, but nooo, you just visit it with the quest and never return...
---
I mean, give us some endgame Beth...
---
All account characters for any cosmetic rewards afaik
---
Mine are all 230, they sell quickly as people soon realise they can go sell them at the vendors for a profit.
---
I do this all the time. I look for places i would see in the game, like abandoned farms, forrest areas where trees fell, house that need attention. I visualize running through in my PA. #whengamingbecomesreal lol
---
Nice explanation, 🙏
---
[https://imgur.com/ElbLGa1](https://imgur.com/ElbLGa1)
---
Non-developers usually think that if a change is visually small (snap foundations to walls), that the actual implementation must be small as well.
---
Ty! Def looks interesting...
---
Who wouldn't?
---
That’s called physics lol, i mean stealth gives such huge buffs but I never expect to be that close to an enemy and believe that it won’t see me just because I’m crouched and wear fancy clothes. In real world they’d see me from 50 feet if I’m not laying flat no matter how dumb they are. I think at certain point the game system just won’t pretend I’m invisible any more.
---
Nope.  You won't have your camp while you are on that server but once you do find a server where the spot is available your camp will place down like normal with no building required. 
---
 I almost always stay on the server to see what someone else's build in that spot looks like and sometimes you see some cool stuff you never would have thought of.  Also any server I get on I check to see if any good events like scorched Earth are happening or if someone is in a silo.  If it looks like a nuke will drop soon I will stay on and play without my camp.  Can usually find another camp with every you need out in the open for others to use.
---
On rare occasions you might stay on the world and there is no camp even in your spot.  Happens for various reasons I won't get into.
---
I'm learning that I can't play games for all my downtime any longer. Doesn't matter the game, some days I just gotta go do something else. The game will be there tomorrow. Or a week from now. Or whenever I come back to it.
---
Personally, with fo76, I got it when Wastelanders came out, played it for a few hours each day for a couple weeks. I've barely scratched the surface honestly and just came back this week. I've still got a ton of the map to explore (probably 75% still) and that's what I enjoy most. Biggest complaint is the lag on enemy hits. Like, I shoot them and it looks like they have a sliver of health left so I shoot again. But turns out they just take a beat to actually die. 
---
Can't speak to late/end game stuff though. I'm still just running around looting everything and having a blast.
---
Plasma flamers are brilliant fun
---
for sure how i feel about this game, I'm terrified of the destiny/MMO direction as the format is more addictive but less empowering. Luckily for them I have mental illness that prevents me from doing much else with my time
---
The gauntlet is pretty much a classic power fist with a saw on it
---
That one is clever and dependent on the action of YOU, so it's good.
---
But Jen’s got style, you know what I mean?
---
I second this. You could allways make it a general ski. Gor every power armor, but I wouldnt even be so mad if it was T-45 exclusive.
---
I guess also you can stay on that server and move your camp if you WANT to but you don't HAVE to, it's just an option and up to you.
---
Holorifle is best energy weapon. Unfortunately it isn't a thing yet when 76 happens
---
Mire is way too underused
---
Weasel was the high point of the raider questline.  Truth be told though, I enjoyed the settler allies waaaay more than the raider characters.  It wasn't what I expected based on Reddit scuttlebutt.
---
Pretty much all the weapons from OWB were incredible
---
Awesome! Tried exactly the same a few weeks ago, but couldn't make it work. Will decently try that!  Thanks
---
A week ago I could waltz through the entire Valley Galleria in the chinese stealth suit without firing a shot. (The bird from Crater sends me there a lot for vacuum tubes) That's without running any sneak cards except the sneak bonus damage. The last few days, I'm in caution a good bit of the way through, then will go into danger and have to pop a few baddies to get the job done. I tried putting my sneak cards back on, but I didn't see much difference.
---
Yeah, if I see folks coming out of the vault I'll craft and drop a full set of lvl5 top notch deep pocketed leather, a decently modded 10mm, hunting rifle &amp; some ammo. Usually some spare plans too
---
I know they'll out level the gear pretty quickly, but I remember how much of a benefit some decent gear gives at the beginning
---
But she is alive....
---
In the events and some secret base... and give you a ride out of that base.  
---
(Yes finished the Wastelanders quest and stikl see motherlode on the events and base)
---
This got me too sometimes. Fortunately you can fav your gear to prevent item loss. Other stuff is more obtainable
---
I’ve noticed that if it’s not legit god roll armor it’s not worth stocking your machine with it now. I only buy armor for scrip prices now. If it’s not unyielding-sentinel/cavalier/sneak heavy combat/scout/ etc. it’s trash. I’m guilty of looking at people’s machines and scrolling immediately down to see if they’re selling unyielding and how much they’re selling it for. Personally I scrip anything that isn’t vanguard or unyielding sentinel/cavalier/sneak because I know it won’t sell, and I need legendary modules for my secret service pieces.
---
Weren't the responders one of the first factions to crawl out of the nuclear fire?
---
Is this a rare plan? I'm relatively new to the game and like OP got it yesterday I'm guessing from the first time I played radiation rumble which was yesterday as well. Didn't even realise I had it until I went to learn a plan I had bought from a player vendor.
---
Waiting for exactly that for over a year now. Makes me so angry, that they don't fix something so little, that will have such a Hugh effects.
---
That we can snap stairs only in the middle of a floor drives me crazy to that point, that I've stopped playing a few weeks ago.
---
I still don’t understand why they thought a bunch of solo rpg players would want a fallout game that is basically fortnite with more steps
---
Spiral staircase. So I can build down a cliff without weaving back and forth
---
Foundation had a memorable character or two, but I felt Crater's characters were more human. Especially when I was on that quest to save Ra-Ra.
---
Not really ha it’s not a real world is it? we’re talking about a game with talking super mutants and humongous honey bees and ferocious chameleons. The game intends for you to be able to sneak up on enemies, specifically being around a foot away from them otherwise there’d be no multiplier for melee attacks while sneaking; you’d not be close enough to hit them.
---
Gimme Weasel, she's the the most interesting &amp; fun character in the game. :P
---
Your problem is the cosmetic selection not that they designed the game to be super annoy AF and a pain in the ass to play unless you bought the sub?.... *sigh*
---
No, a good portion of people who sell them at that price know exactly what you're talking about. 
---
They complain about how people buy in bulk just to sell it to robot vendors. Cause you have to be a moron or desperate to pay anything more than 500 for a serum, no matter how much people such as yourself want to over-inflate the price artificially.
---
its been a thing for quite a while, but its only after wastelanders that the bug has gone into overdrive. i can't even respawn anymore, every death is the respawn bug
---
I'm sure nothing is easy to add/fix with an online game. Anything can bug out anything else out, we see it every patch. But I agree there's a call for more building options. The new prefab stuff is fun but I hope they don't solely go down that route. Plus they do have models and assets already in F4 they could bring over so I'm sure it's possible to add in. (I'd like to see the junk walls, shack building elements and some new stair options added along with the stuff you mentioned)
---
No way? That's very cool. Thanks for sharing!
---
Im almost tempted to re-download FO4 just for kinggaths settlement mods again
---
This is what happens now when I try to get on the internet. 
---
Is there a divide between internet people and people who have fun in real life? I'm just trying to figure this new life out myself so downvotes... Shove em.
---
It's extremely satisfying to use that weapon. Wish they added more skins for it, actually, all weapons need more skins lol.
---
I am not interested in pvp in Fallout 76 but this seems like a decent idea as long as rewards from these pvp events are not too special. One of my biggest issues with Destiny 2 was that pve meta weapons were locked behind pvp activities. I don’t want to see that repeated. 
---
Other than that, as long as I can opt out of any pvp without missing important rewards, I am ok with pvp coexisting with pve.
---
I've wanted Wattz to make a comeback since Bethesda picked up Fallout, tbh. It's always the first batch of mods I download.
---
I saw barrel and. 44 and thought they finally added the bull barrel to the game! Ha ha
---
These people want to over-inflate the market and absolutely HATE it when they're undercut by people selling serums at reasonable prices.
---
These people have been trying to push prices above 500 for a long while. Trying to make out like 500-1k is the normal market price (this greedy guy is saying 2k plus LOL).
---
Don't pay them any mind. 200-500 is what is generally the market average for now. Anything more than that and you're just throwing away caps.
---
I do his daily just to hear him drunkenly ramble
---
Yeah this just be it. My agility is only 4/5 due to other SPECIALS being quite high. I just thought even with mediocre agility, perks that make it harder for you to detect as well as gear and items that actually make you INVISIBLE would work, otherwise what’s the point in stealth boys if they only work when you’re agility is high enough? You’d just sneak normally and there’s be no need for SB’s. You’d think they’d be there for people who CAN’T sneak.
---
What's a bloodied build
---
I have a stealth commando, but yesterday, I was spotted the whole time, and always in danger instead of caution.... after I got killed and respawned... I noticed I had my pip boy light on..... duuuh
---
tldr, turn your light off when sneaking
---
It’s so beautiful and scary especially with mega sloths hiding in trees or super mutants patrolling it, heart of the swamp events make me think what if there was massive hordes etc
---
With that badass voice
---
Wait what? I sell them for 300 a piece... I was commenting on OP statement about selling them in his vendor after buying the recipe. It’s not a good investment if he plans on selling them for 500-2000+ caps.
---
And FTR I see plenty of players sell them for 600,800,1000, 2000 caps. They is definitely people who sell them for much less, but my point was unless you know have been around you won’t know what to sell items for. Many many players just list items in their vendors for the “value” listed on the items when you put it in your vendor.
---
As long as it's big, made of iron and goes on my hip, I'm good to go.
---
But I would've gotten 50 downvotes for this comment. The Reddit site is starting to blend into the BS.
---
Nice.
---
Great trick.   Thanks for sharing.  I’m wondering if I can use this to hang the patriotic banners from the stair railing off the porch.
---
There has to be at least one First member to keep the world going, otherwise, non-Firsts get a timer before the world shuts down.
---
It might not be a B2525, but a BE15fr lever is the most valuable roll on a lever you can get, worth upwards of 100k but better used as a trade only weapon.
---
B2525 is more valued on automatic rifles anyways.
---
Why is that weird? It works exactly as it says it does?
---
I’m honestly surprised they didn’t see it coming. I mean, look how massive Minecraft is. It’s one of the top games in the world. Bethesda created a real life version of that and didn’t expect it to take off? Come on... it’s an addiction and I love it
---
Weasel looks a lot like a close friend who passed away a few years ago. I took a ton of screenshots of her since the loading screens bring a tear of joy to me. So yes, I would kill for Weasel to travel with me.
---
Anytime you try to discharge the shot without firing (by holstering) there is also a chance that the whirring noise persists until another shot is charged. It's mad annoying. Gauss Rifles would be 10x better in combat all around if they weren't so buggy.
---
I've yet to find a stable flux vendor on PC. I'd pay 400-500 per unit if I could find one since it's time-consuming to find HRF.
---
I agree. Pvp events should operate with small common rewards much like other events. There could be room for things like new plans but they would need to be tradable and not too rare to be moderated fairly in the economy.       
---
Thank you for sharing some positive feedback on my idea. I really appreciate it.
---
Bolstering armor or vangaurds if you want full health unyielding if you want bloodied
---
Make sure you are selling 1400 caps worth each day to make money. Then just go shopping at player camps and try to find it for now more than 150 per flux. Buying it is so much faster than farming it. A West Tek run will get you a lot of weapons to sell you caps. Water farming is good for caps too. If you're consistent with getting your 1400 caps each day, you'll see how fast you hit the cap of 30k. Hit the cap, shopping spree, repeat.
---
I feel the same dude...
---
in addition, the military wing of the whitesprings bunker there are notes that say what plants make what flux. (most people nuke fissure site prime for violet and whitesprings for everything else)
---
also the Luck perk "with salt" or certain backpack mods can help with the flux degradation time
---
All I want is a Sage companion
---
I wish they'd put in an event that you could use to reliably trigger blooming in the strangler pods. Maybe alternate it with the Heart of the Swamp event so that in the the new event we have to strengthen the Heart (or the whole swamp) with some fertilizer to trigger a bloom, and in the Heart of the Swamp we need to beat the now strengthened thing back into submission or something.
---
Having to rely on random low levels to do An Organic Solution so I can make some RadShield is terrible game design. :-(
---
I have said this before and I'll say it again, they have done an event overhaul but I would love to see a CAMP overhaul, reduce the amount of crazy restrictions put in place to stop people building nice CAMPs (no im not saying increase budget I know there is a valid reason for that being what it is although we'd all love to be able to build huge again)  
---
What I'd like to see changed is things like:  
---
-Clipping items together should be allowed, clipping items together can make some really cool looking things  
---
-You should *not* have to place on a foundation to make a building, speaks for itself really, being able to build anything without a foundation would help a lot with creativity  
---
-Ability to turn on/off snapping  
---
-Stairs should not be required for upper floors, this is probably the biggest problem especially when you misplace a staircase and it all goes to hell, we have marsupial mutations, let us make CAMPs for that  
---
-As listed by OP, more wall/floor/roof sizes and shapes, half walls, half floors and half foundations  
---
-Add interior walls that can be wallpapered both sides  
---
-Allow re texturing of the underside of floors to make ceilings  
---
-Have workshop builds be saveable, so when you take a workshop you can load in what you have built there previously instead of having to rebuild everything every time  
---
I'm sure theres a lot more but these are some off the top of my head I personally would like to see changed
---
Samuel has got to be one of the most useless, uncharismatic, annoying NPCs in the game.
---
I have a feeling they’ll add onto it and make it repeatable or make multiple arenas you know? I would love a faction that has like a huge arena that is a global event and you say load in like nuclear winter and have no skills no perks just random weapons and armor
---
If its just leaving pa then it's that easy. Just don't use it. If you're dropping pa I'd recommend also dropping heavys so you can specialise in rifles.
---
So far nothing except financial fear has 'forced' Bethesda to fix a bug.
---
Yes i understand perfectly that it’s all inside a fantasy world, my point is I don’t trust it enough to get to within 5 feet and expect it to work every time, the game system has many parameters spaghetti coded together, when I get too close I expect some alarms, such as line of sight or sound or whatever else, get triggered and sometimes override my stealth settings.  When I push it sometimes it would work sometimes it would break without warning. I hesitate to call it ‘broken’ because I don’t know how far I can reliably push it.
---
All of my atoms for an interior corner roof piece! All of them! Let us have the L-shaped homes we want!
---
Yep, unfortunately however now my whole favourite wheel is unusable because it's occupied my by gear
---
Oh ok. Sorry, my bad for misreading your comment. I thought you were saying you'd be dumb to sell lower than that. Must have latched onto the price since that's a common price range people bandy about justifying the high cost.
---
Vegas for example had 
---
Displacer glove
---
Ballistic fist
---
Industrial hand
---
Superheated fist.
---
Salt upon wounds, which was able to poison, among others.
---
Those were very interesting and I want them back, also, having to use mf cells again would be neat.
---
If they did this it'll be NW vomit coloured
---
My respawn rate will be occurring more often than Kenny from South Park.
---
There are dozens of us.
---
Yeah, and the potential loss of 150 atoms per tier might finally force their hand.
---
With Wastelanders I noticed a couple changes that result in this. Pre-Wastelanders, Ghouls would all aggro immediately when you are detected by one. You can see this in older CaptainNoob videos for example. Maybe related but we used to see a lot of sleeper/crawler ghouls around this time.
---
Post-Wastelanders, they no longer aggro at once. Unfortunately it seems that they still "detect" you even though they're sleeping. I suspect whatever fixed/changed the en masse aggro didn't solve the actual detection - rather they are forced into their sleep animation until you get super close.
---
The current behavior of not aggroing all at once was the original behavior as far as I remember. I guess I could dig through CaptainNoob videos to see when it changed but I have work to do 😜
---
Non-PA armor doesn't really have Perks... I mean there's White Knight to make it degrade slower... and I guess Serendipity because you can dodge? Maybe get Goat Legs to lose some fall damage.
---
If you're not planning a specialized build (Bloodied), then you'll want Secret Service armor or Heavy Combat Armor.
---
Maybe you should join an RP group. I've seen them try to recruit players from time to time.
---
A disgraceful form of melee build where you have your health as low as possible to dish out obscene amounts of damage.
---
I'm glad that I'm writing my own novel on Fallout 76. It gives me a reason to explore the map and events, so I can incorporate them into my writing.
---
The industrial hand is basically the same as the gauntlet.
---
Yes this is actually why I posted this. I want to buy that bundle because of the house kit and porch but I already own everything else. It sucks.
---
Look at your DR/ER in your Pip-Boy. It doesn't add the +10 on the armor number itself but you'll see it increase your overall armor appropriately.
---
i would but when wastelanders dropped all the solar/thorn/mask vault armours lost their vines so its not really much to look at. and i can't be bothered getting the vault mask plan from SS
---
What perks do you have that are power armor specific at the moment? It would be helpful if you posted your build. 
---
Generally outside of PA you will be running legendary armor like unyielding or vanguards for example.
---
I think I might need to do the same. The formula for matching a piece to its ideal buyer has a lot of variables: body piece, armor style, and legendary effects. Probably not worth the stash space for most pieces.
---
I think each area should have like a scorch beast queen type event mire should have like say 4 events one after another of defending pods than the final is a massive strangler heart and however many pods you saved weaken it.
---
Yeah no worries. 
---
Theoretically serums should sell higher, but since plans and serums were duped it crashed their market value. In a perfect world you prob could get away for selling them at that price, but you never will lol
---
I probably would as well, you'll get more mileage out of your build that way.
---
I hate that damn monkey.  Turn a corner and SURPRISE MONKEY!  I always shoot them now.
---
So she can die after one bite from a radrat pup like all my deathclaw pets? I couldn't stand another round of that heartbreak.
---
It's a set up of armor, perks, and mutations designed to work well with a Bloodied legendary weapon effect. At 20% health the bloodied effect grants an 80% damage boost. When you combine it with select perks and mutations the damage you can output is enormous. 
---
Radiation is used to keep your health bar around the 20% mark specifically to keep the bloodied effect active at all times. Hence the desire to have a barrel that gives radiation at your camp because of ease and convenience. 
---
When you combine a full set of unyielding armor, bloodied, nerd rage, adrenal mutation, and various other damage boosting and defensive perks, you essentially become a glass canon. Except the glass you're made out of is more comparable to steel. Even at 20% health with the right perks and armor, especially PA, you can tank a good amount of damage. Most of the time though you doah out so much damage that its hardly necessary to worry about taking damage because you kill the enemy so quickly.
---
There are other ways to utilize the bloodied effect, many players like to use a stealth commando build with bloodied for example.
---
The world only keeps going if another fallout 1st player is on it.
---
Been my text notification sound forever.
---
Please and salty all in one mix. Thankyou
---
🤣
---
May he have a long li-
---
  You know what nah he got this without me.
---
Not really crying, just found it funny and wanted to share
---
He talks SO MUCH when I’m shopping at Sunnys.
---
Stable Flux, honestly.  Though I price mine for like...  10 caps each, only because I want to manage my Stash easier.
---
Yep I'm noticing this as well, have bolstering, vanguard and uny pieces up for 1000-1500 each and rarely sell anything. At this rate I'll be stopping selling them and just scripping them.
---
https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Cancel-Auto-Renewal-for-Subscription-Services?language=en_US
---
My agility is a base 15 + 18 from unyielding and cards, this must be why I seem undetectable.
---
I'm even more disappointed than you are.  You know why?
---
I was hoping for a pension.  But all's I got is tension.  Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
---
Ah, yes.  The Rad Barrel.  A moderately uncommon drop.
---
I didn’t buy F76 for role playing, I bought it for co-op.
---
Yeah. Been up for a little while now, its the reason why the game servers shit the bed last week.
---
i've seen regular items this way and more rare items such as rad fluids. never seen a legendary (on console). with your method, a legendary could supposedly drop without tagging the enemy. can someone else confirm this?
---
This game would be actually much better with more MMORPG elements.
---
Right now it's an MORPG with no end-game progression content for groups.  No dungeons, no raids/trials.  No way to safely transfer items between characters, no way for 2 players to safely and reliably trade one item for another, literally stuck in the stone age forced to use couriers (Todd bless them) to do a simple trade.
---
If this game took some of the basic content and features from other modern and other not-so-modern MORPG games then it would be a million times better.  
---
You said yourself you don't like many other games so it's not exactly a surprise when you don't like something especially 76.
---
I want some wood stairs with hand rails, sieling fans, glass windows, cash register, the pie machine, broken floors, sliding doors, a trailer home like in flatwoods.
---
People reporting this for not being directly related to Fallout 76 need to read up on RobCo.
---
That's okay.  I've been forum-banned going on 2 months now for violating an NDA I've never seen.  Customer Support is a joke.  Direct messaged Jurassica AND LadyDevAnn in Discord and Twitter (respectively) and both of them ignored me.  I can't join the PTS until it's fixed, and I'm just counting down to the actual 2-month date before pursuing more aggressive action.  
---
Anyway, I'm just sayin'...  Bethesda is also fond of wrongful bans.  Remember all the people who had lots of legitimately hoarded items who got banned a while back, too?  Let's not single out Division 2, here - they all do it.  Treating your customers badly is in the AAA Studio Handbook these days.
---
I like it doing it before the low sometimes high levels flood in, die a bunch of times and never revive the people who are conduits.
---
Much easier solo.
---
The winding stairs like in the tops of churches would be nice too
---
People need to lightin up
---
But then it's not really his birthday day....it's his birth day
---
i found one in the inlaws house, damn near threw it out of pure instinct. (no explosives though)
---
irl version is way more creepy looking than the games
---
You think?
---
I'm using a tse lever as my sniper rifle.  Never found a decent up close rifle.
---
Yeah focusing on one-gun type frees up a lot of perk space. I go Rifleman for sniping, and then use a non-Automatic Handmade for up-close.
---
Yeah armor has been dead a while now. I've been investing in weapons.
---
Love this foot-traffic idea ❤️
---
I second this. As a loyal scout I hit "Stings and Things" and "Operation Tidy" everyday as well as "Campfire Tales" if it pops up. I also have one challenge badge left undone. The drop rate isn't great but I've managed to get all possum vending machine items.
---
Anyone who complains about Mr. House not being directly related to Fallout 76 will have an Assaultron army sent to their C.A.M.P.
---
What I admire most about the game is the C.A.M.P. system.  It's great to utilize the little things in it.
---
You selling it?
---
Haven’t played Wastelanders, didn’t know they brought my boy, I’m happy now.
---
Well if you consider the note about house in fallout 76 you could argue it has a place here 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
It may take a little while to get it. Complete the storyline then you can get it from a settler merchant
---
Shhh Todd don't like any talk about New Vegas
---
Damn now that’s just harsh :o
---
You are best off only using 1 weapon type. You do t have enough perk points to use 2 to their full potential. And heavys need pa to shine. I've been a pa heavy gunner for 335 levels now and would always recommend that style lol. But I get that it's not every one's cup of tea
---
Pssssst... look up RobCo Industries.
---
Go for a non-automatic handmade. Other good up-close are Instigating weapons. A shotgun or melee. That way you get the double-damage from the first hit (moreso if in Sneak). That Lever Action should help you with keeping your distance, but if you're up close an Instigating heavy-hitter shouldn't need any Perk cards to help you clear some space.
---
You can use the port-o-toilet to make things float, I wonder if you could use it for the flag. I tried it last night with turrets, and it works for making some floating turrets.
---
Beautiful rifle. Best you could ask for as a non auto
---
I don’t have first so I’m not sure. 
---
When you nuke your private server and leave does the nuke stay? If so it probably works the same.
---
They had a ceiling fan in the atom shop awhile back, I'm sure it'll return at some point.
---
The two I find most often are at Slocums Joe near Vault 76 and the Cranberry Glade on the obtton right corner of the map. Might take a few server hops but you can usually find easy settler rep.
---
They were, due to covid they been rather quiet and just auto resolve issue without giving anything.. also.... Why should I have to beg for my atoms when this bug has been around since nuclear winter. And these other auto completing bugs too that mess things up.
---
Honestly bethesdas focus shouldn't be just the atom shop.
---
How much are you looking to buy?
---
He wasn't very "observant."
---
Actually I asked someone this just yesterday. In vendor view I wasn’t sure if when viewing a weapon it displays the added damage of all your perk cards, as my 1 shot weapons were doing quite a bit more damage than the sellers 2 shot versions of the same level. I asked to view in trade window to check if it applies it there but they didn’t reply to me.
---
He is also a pervert, i see him with his dirty undies all the time,like wtf? is it a bug or something he does on purpose.
---
I might have an AA combat rifle. Let me check my characters and I'll let you know.
---
If you have exchanged real monies for a fictitious currency that can only be spent in a single virtual world, on trivial cosmetic impulse purchases ... you are the architect of your own exploitation.
---
Not changing the story, this was a separate occasion.
---
I know it probably comes across like I'm being butthurt and whiny, and fishing for someone to tell me that the other player was being a jerk or must have been hacking or something, but honestly I'm just trying to understand a particular mechanic of the game which I have fallen foul of a couple of times and which I haven't worked out yet.
---
So far I can say I'm really enjoying this game and find it to have a really fair and helpful community around it, and I don't assume that anyone is just griefing me, it's just that there's very little stuff online that explains some of the mechanics there are.
---
I assumed that when killed by the other player I had lost the workshop. It no longer showed up as mine in any case, and a quest had appeared to 'retake' the workshop. All I'm saying is that some of this stuff isn't very clear.
---
I'm level 40 and I don't think I've ever had more than about 500 caps on me at any time, it's usually around 200 so yeah die a couple of times and I do lose around half my caps.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
If they are crouching when they go to your vendors they could be trying to make sure you don't get them with a trap.
---
People have been placing a lot of traps recently. Also they may shoot at you because some people stay at their camps in build mode and put down traps once you are there to get you too.
---
So could just be an abundance of caution not anything bad.
---
I also will see boxes that look like loot or stash boxes and I think ohhhh I wonder what goodies are in there!
---
A tribal PA skin, as seen on Fo2 loading screen, would be cool.

---
No, I missed them the first time and they came back a little before wastelanders I wanna say.
---
I don't get why they remove things from the store, don't they want my money, I don't know of any other game that does that.
---
Actually, give us "Faction-specific" skins. 
---
Enclave - Black Devil Skin
---
BOS - Outcast Skin (I know this is already coming, but it would be a good 1st incentive)
---
US Military - Taggerdy's Thunder Skin (pre-war)
---
Everyone else seems to have already gotten theirs.
---
&gt;If we get anyone from The Wayward, it needs to be Bessie.
---
The real hero, right here folks!
---
+1 for Bessie follower.
---
Definetly. Looks pretty cool.
---
Well, the unfortunate truth is running heavy guns without power armor isn't really a good idea. There's a niche stealth build for the flamer, but that's about it. Otherwise, the benefits of Stabilized are too good to not use PA.
---
Personally, I've tried, a LOT to work a build for both snipers and heavy guns, and you just can't do a good one. Yes, you can build for both, but both will suffer greatly.
---
Probably the best compromise (and the reason so many people do it) is a good commando build. With full auto rifles, you can get good hard-hitting ranged damage to rival the best snipers, but also high dps short-range weapons. 
---
**But**, if you really do want to try making both work and you need assistance, the first thing anyone needs to know to help you is how many QOL and weight-reduction perks you need to use the guns you want to use. Because heavy guns can burn through ammo fast, and they weigh a lot.
---
Oh, it's on XBox as well. It's rare (definitely rarer than the "freeze" that seems to happen quite a bit after FT).
---
If it's any consolation, it's a fun encounter, but the loot isn't anything to write home about.
---
I dont disagree with this, but I doubt Beth is gonna put highly requested P.A. skins behind an additional paywall.
---
Yeah, I know, but I’ve seen some other posts about it and kinda wanted to find it. Oh well
---
Your options are BoS or....BoS
---
Enjoy your birthday despite it being corona season hope you have an amazing day
---
Never been in a bundle. Think they have been back twice. So out a total of 3 times
---
So you say you want a motherload...
---
You can still find the stump and collect the goods, but its really hard to find.
---
Chameleon, Stealth Boys and Weightless appear to be more aimed at PvP. Some people claim a full set of Chameleon works, but I'm not sure. It was hot for a while after a popular YouTuber made a video about it, but I don't see many people running Chameleon anymore so it might have been overhyped.
---
For PvE the shadowed mod for leather works, I believe muffled works, and the "harder to detect" legendary effect. You can boost your agility by 3 points with Shielded Raider underarmor and I'm sure you know the other ways. I doubt you'll be able to reliably sneak still, at least without unyielding, but it might give you enough leeway to figure out some tactics.

I think their thinking is that if an item is only available for one week, people will buy it on impulse. If someone doesn't have enough atoms to buy something, they either have to save up atoms or buy the atoms. If that thing is only available for a short time, it might be hard for people to save enough atoms before it's gone so they're more likely to spend real money buying atoms before the thing disappears. It's a cash grab tactic. If things stayed in the store forever, fewer people would spend money on atoms because we could all just earn them from the challenges and save up.
---
Running with full charge,  stabilised,  power patcher,
---
Any idea how I can post my build without having to write it all out?
---
10 or 6
---
Nope.
---
I mainly use a gatling gun for my heavy.  I find that it doesn't use much ammo and ammo is cheap to make.  Never used auto rifles as I find it hard to find 5.56 ammo
---
You always can designate desirable stuff on desirable slots in wheel manually. No problems with that
---
Well what mean by clever is not obviously a trap base. But i agree, if the guy wasn't wanted then i probably wouldn't have known it was a trap right off
---
You might wanna read sub rules..
---
Thats what bundles for you buy one thing and get other thing too you guys are so fucking impressive
---
https://nukesdragons.com is great for builds and planning.
---
To be honest If it was me I'd probably keep the character you have and decide either heavy guns and PA or switch focus to rifles and stealth and do the other on a seperate character.
---
I meant not on much compared to serious gaming i used to do when younger..
---
Usually will do 2 to 4 hour sessions.
---
if interested pm me your game id\~(is there pm on reddit?)
---
Well, there was the "communist" flag that is the fallout universe's version of the Chinese flag. Theres also the smaller swiss flags from fasnacht. Theres not really a good reason in the lore to have the other countries.
---
Forgot to add... I'm not keen on the idea of having very little health.. like bloodied?
---
I agree with you about the Wattz weapons. I don't really see the need for them. However, the plasma defender could make for a good pistol, I think. I don't find pistols to be very viable in terms of damage, except for the gauss pistol. The plasma defender could make me change my tune a bit.
---
Sadly, he passed away when I accidentally shot him in the bubble....... 37 times....  
---
I forget when...
---
I pvp almost only for a year now and I have one once or twice a week.
---
are you jesus?
---
There are seriously too many weapons to decide on just one.
---
The Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun would be super badass to have again.
---
The “Prototype” Gauss Rifle would be great to have again.  I genuinely hate how the Gauss Rifle looks and prefer the Fallout 3 and NV style more.  It looks better and just feels right.
---
The Mantis Gauntlet would be pretty cool to have also.  If they add more enemies they could add Mantises and include the weapon.
---
You shouldn't be running full charger or power patcher either way. Both are pretty much a waste of points
---
I'm hoping they do introduce new allies as new factions enter Appalachia, because that means BOS hanging around my camp. The new Responder hanging around Flatwoods would be cool as an ally too, but I understand she's already got a place in the game.
---
Blessings on ya
---
Melee actually isn't the best option.... Try melee roof turrets or flying bars not fun.
---
The best option is a full auto bloodied vats character which never leaves stealth... Melee will win in damage but that wins in dps and its ranged
---
There's even a behemoth at Twin Lakes who acts exactly like Swan. He even yells "SWAN!" as he emerges from the water.
---
I would have liked a junkies as i run junkies gauss because that way i could have just used it now as a backup. And i imagine when loadouts arrive you wont be able to chop and change mutations. So i may have to try and roll a bloodied gauss.
---
Cut your pipboy light off!
---
Golfclub. Use a golfclub.
---
It sucks, just gotta hope they release the porch and house kit as standalone items in the future i guess.
---
With Green Thumb you can get 10 at Foundation.
---
General Stake house has a farm in the back with like 25 tatos plants.
---
Yeah, that's how I started with heavy guns too. Gatling guns hit pretty hard and are by far the most ammo-efficient gun in the game. But they're also not particularly high-dps, and IMO are not worth building for heavy guns just for that, especially not if you don't want to use PA. Personally, I recommend ditching the heavy guns and PA and focus on getting a more diverse set of non-auto rifles, and build around stealth.
---
Here's a link to the build tool most people use: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
What system you on?  I'm always looking for 3* Vanguard Heavy Combat pieces.
---
If its for C.A.M.Ps then it's nothing to do with Lore otherwise you'd have to erase half of the Atom Shop to stick within some arbitrary rule set. No reason why country flags couldn't be included in the future, other than there's a whole lot of them (190+) so maybe they would have to sold in sets (eg by Continent or Alphabetical) and cycled through regularly.
---
I was unaware of that. There goes that idea.
---
&gt;Theres not really a good reason in the lore to have the other countries.
---
Do we really need one?  It's just a camp decoration.
---
I'm on PC mate, not sure what I have without checking though. I'll let you know next time I log on.
---
Mr.House???
---
On the topic of Tribal PA I would definitely take the Tribal T-45 from Fallout 3's The Pitt. Loved that suit.
---
(but maybe they're saving it for if we ever go north to Pitt)
---
lol that’s funny XD my 3 year old love to watch me play fallout she just sits there and can watch for hours
---
Ha! I'd love a "Crazy Server" option...random mobs run player builds... A bloodied assaultron getting the drop on you and face lasers you so hard you wake up on a wagon.
---
I had one lead me over a hump in the ground and straight in to a pack of angry Yao Guai. Some days you just have to take the downs with the ups.
---
I think its funny how people on here get downvoted for asking legit questions but to everyone else thx for the helpful tips
---
I mean... if you only need a few to start planting, Flatwoods has em.
---
I think there's a sink with the season rewards.
---
While that is true, some of this we already have in FO4 and this is largely just a port.
---
The world shuts down after 20 minutes if nobody on the world has fallout 1st.
---
There is some just south of v76 near a hut, there is also a farm top left of the map that has a bunch.
---
Agree. Clans/groups would be cool too. Maybe dress it as factions.
---
Because it's fucking childish. 
---
And you people are ruining the game for anyone that still has a chance at a normal experience. 
---
Bethesda isn't your parents.
---
Ok.  Here's my build
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=de51b57&amp;d=sa0sq2st0s32sr0sb1p72pd2pk2pp2pe0pl0e80e41ei0ew0c50ic3ij0s10im0ip0iq1ih0a70ar0an2l90l21lh0lt2&amp;wp=w5w7&amp;wm=1k2832-
---
Not sure how to mage that link smaller.  
---
I'm hairy to switch out anything tbh.. apart from rifleman perks.
---
As far as multilayer games are concerned it’s my favorite format and I’m glad they added it to fallout.
---
 Just posted my build above.
---
Creator of rob co industry's, huge character in fallout new vegas
---
Fallout has never been a doomsday simulator. It's a doomsday comedy that has some survivalish elements to it(since NV), but it's far from simulator.
---
I do interior walls by clipping to walls together but I’m annoyed by them not only having twice the budget, but twice the thickness too.
---
a slave obeys.
---
Hes in his 200s
---
Considering how the camp building menu system is players from Zimbabwe will be pissed.
---
At least show the status of the daily foundation/crater/Davenport quests in it like they do for Biv.
---
To be honest man your build is a bit of a mess. You're using far to many qol perks and stuff that you only need on while doing certain tasks.
---
I’m not sure if they’ve ever been in a bundle before or not. I’m glad they were offered in the Atomic Shop again though, I’ve been looking for them awhile and finally got them last night.
---
When you're currently investigating the bunker for the BoS questline ,suddenly the siren pops up, you look on the map and be like "Whhaaaait....I'm near that red circle!" and hide in the bunker. You hear the nuke hit and suddenly some giant SB comes flying at you and you're only "WHO TF ARE YOU?!" :D Good times
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_House
---
I didn’t even know formula p existed lol... TIL
---
lol calm down buddy
---
Is it possible that something non-aggressive has detected you, I too sometimes see detected warnings and it turns out that I've been detected by a frog or something like that.
---
Yeah this is another MMO feature that would be great!   So many missed opportunities....
---
Thanks.  I play on Xbox.
---
I know.  I'm half way through removing some of the strength points,  but struggling to level up atm. 
---
What's qol?
---
Quality of life
---
 Might have to try that
---
B2525
---
they say the same thing if your in a stealth suit.
---
So it does seem like something might be happening, but I don’t know what... and no one seems to have any answers. Very weird. So far no one has taken anything from me, but I’m going to remain vigilant. Thanks for the insight! I do not think that in player menus it displays your perk cards, but I could be wrong on that. I could do some testing later with my friend and get back to you.
---
Sorry man. Looked at my four characters and none of them have those guns anymore. I bought a 2 star AA from a player vendor a while back and used it for a long time. Then had another one just like it drop from the world, apparently I've managed to sell both of them. Best I've got is a 3* furious and a 3* ghoul slayers.
---
I've played this game sooo much,  but have never really focused on a proper build . Always just picked random perks and plodded through the game.
---
What it means exactly?
---
Army? One Assaultron Dominator will suffice.
---
I'd like the option to just do the event. I've only got to do the event maybe twice.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f143ff&amp;d=s01p02pd2pk2pp2pl2c72ir2lr0l71l12lt2lv2a72ar2an2a02eu0a32lk2
---
There's my bloodied vats stealth rifleman build (going to change it to commando). Just as a point if reference. 
---
It is probably not perfect since I havnt don't much playing with it yet(been a pa heavy for 335 levels and just starting to mix it up).
---
But i  do feel it's pretty solid. And can be used for advice on what more of an end game build would look like (I am very welcoming of tips if anyone has any BTW)
---
All I see is u
---
I think I have 3 more serums to buy and I'll have them all. I sell more marsupial serums than any of the other ones so it would be your best caps maker out of the bunch. I post mine at 399 caps just to undercut everyone.
---
We need a full set of Faction flags first.
---
And Gentleman Johnny! I want that bastard stealing my purified water when my back is turned.
---
i didnt watch that.. so I have a question?
---
were either of those characters half dead the whole time or hopelessly addicted to drugs?
---
First let them repair Tesla rifle - it does not kill MOBs with automatic reciver
---
I don’t run a bloodied build so I typically try to stay the conduit for all three as much as possible
---
Why so little endurance?  How many hit points do you have?
---
Hmm to be fair mate if you want to turn that into a decent rifle build it's going to take quite a lot of work, your STR is far too high as is your INT. Honestly I'd say it's going to be easier to just make a new rifleman build from scratch and keep the high STR/INT char for your power armor heavy guns build. If you aren't careful you will be spending the next 20-30 levels redoing the one you have.
---
Thank you, but I do have an Unyielding chest piece with a few other effects (fall damage and I forget the other) for that character.  It's not wood, but it's light enough to put up with.
---
Charlie Junkies build incoming!!!
---
I did buy a couple hundred 10mm ammo for 0 caps
---
Because you don't need it. There are very few perks that can help your build. And when you don't get hit you don't need hit points
---
The Outcast Paint is already in the game, it’s a Nuclear Winter reward.
---
I honestly prefer the old republic. It felt like a real mmo rpg
---
yup
---
And I've been at this event enough times to know that when my buddies are coming to do the event as well, it's definitely going to get done.
---
I run that every time.  Best drop was a bloodied lever but the rolls were kind meh, still sold it for like 10 K so not bad.
---
Works for  me, in France :)
---
i dont do this event very often, but from what i remember u can place a PA frame in the door to block the computer until more people show up
---
Ok, first here is what I would start with as a base for using both heavy guns without PA and sniper. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cc215ab&amp;d=sg2sq2s32sr2pd2pk2pp2pl2a72an2ar2ao0ic4cu0ek1l71lt2lu2la2
---
Now, a few things about what you currently have. 
---
Strength: Pack Rat is a complete waste. It doesn't save you much weight, and you shouldn't be running around with much junk anyway. Stash it, use it, or drop it. Full charge is total garbage.
---
Perception: You don't need Butcher's Bounty. Even if you're running the Carnivore mutation, you can still probably be fine without it. It's a weak QOL perk at best. You don't have room for Glow Sight, and honestly, glowing enemies aren't that hard anyway. And none of the end-game bosses are glowing, so when you really need the most damage, it doesn't apply.
---
Endurance: Sorry but you are spreading yourself way too thin here. You can't do a build that is effective for heavy guns, and snipers, AND keep so many weak perks here. At most, you can afford 2 points for Rejuvenated. 
---
Charisma: Hard Bargain is great, but only for buying and selling at vendors. Swap it in when you need it, otherwise use one point in Tenderizer. Suppressor is also really good here, and Lone Wanderer if you play mostly solo (not in a group).  
---
Intelligence: For the build you're going for, the only thing you should have equipped here is Gunsmith. You don't need Batteries Included if you're not running PA, you don't need any Science perks except for crafting, Weapon Artisan you can swap in when you need to repair guns, and Power Patcher is also pointless except for when you need to repair. PA durability lasts an eternity now compared to what it used to.
---
Agility: Max out Action Boy/Girl, and all the stealth perks. You're on the right track here, you just need more of them for your sniping.
---
Luck: The only good perk you have equipped here is Bloody Mess. If you want to use mutations (which you should) you should have the two perks for that. Serendipity is always good, but not really necessary for a sniper.
---
I have that but still want the fan from FO4.
---
Also, why cant we put wallpaper on wooden shutters? It makes literally no sense
---
 That's what I was fearing tbh. It does seem like it'll be a lot of work.  
---
Any idea how to level up fast so I can get back to where I was?
---
Unless, of course, you don’t play bloodied,  which I realize is rare around theses parts.
---
Oh. Yeah I feel like Star Wars could bring that.
---
Pve go bloodied, PvP go junkies
---
Like a pristen enclave  flag.
---
I think something similar happened with these rewards for the ghillie suit and stuff. I never play NW and when I logged in I got all of the rewards up to the day of the timed releases. I had no idea what the deal was, but it made pretty easy to farm for the last two or three rewards.
---
Thank you! I'm an apprentice electrician that was supposed to be in trade school beginning march, so school was cancelled 2 weeks in, and just restarted online classes this week, so I'm currently following along online. But class is over soon, it's beautiful outside so I may go fishing with my dad later today, then some FO76 later tonight. :D
---
Also thank you for the silver. &lt;3
---
Thank you! I can't promise I will not turn into the next Mr.House. We shall see in 200 some odd years.
---
Good luck in the wasteland hope your blessed with some birthday 3 star legendaries.
---
If you only want to do the bare minimum to the Queen, get Adrenaline and pick off the small time shit to rack up the kill bonus, and then empty the gun into her twice. At 200dmg a shot, you’re easily doing the required tag damage. You’re there to act as support.
---
I really want the fusion core candles. Hell, there’s even a mod for FO4 that has them as a settlement object!
---
Did you by chance join a world where you couldn't place your camp? If so, your display items are temporarily placed in your stash. This opens you junk up to being consumed from crafting.
---
Because NV remains the best FO.
---
&gt; It is not affected by class freak and in a lot of cases makes a character suffer -2 to all stats. 
---
It is my experience that is not the case. Max Class Freak completely negates the penalty. I had to prove this to my wife to convince her to fork out the cash at Modus' serum shoppe so she could get herd mentality.
---
This is what I've done to stop folks from starting it.
---
Im looking foward to it, mr.house is in his 270s in new Vegas
---
I don't really care what people post, and this is quite Nice, but it is indeed not related to 76, so people are allowed to complain.
---
A bit weird, but allowed.
---
Yea that would be great! 
---
I’ll have to keep my eye out too
---
Weird question I know this is an old topic. But I talk to Vinny and the event won't start for me. Do I need more people or am I suppose to do something else after talking to Vinny before going in the tunnel?
---
Thanks to this I found out Mr House's relation to RobCo... and I have a couple thousand hours in FNV
---
The Brotherhood are moving into ATLAS Observatory. I would like the BOS to maintain a presence in the Divide and Cranberry Bog. If we ever get any expansion to the mire I'd like it to see a return of the Free States or hell the Cult of Mothman.
---
There is (was?) a glitch where players were somehow getting items from your stash via vending machines. I thought it was fixed, but this sounds similar. 
---
I really don't know too much about it, but it was a very hot topic recently so there should be a lot of posts on it. Vendors were disabled for a while due to it. 
---
Sorry to hear about your stuff and hope you can get it back! In the meantime, maybe turn off your vendors while you troubleshoot.
---
Thanks for the info.  My build is currently set up for power armour with half set up for rifles.. I'm half way through switching.  
---
I may just continue my level 10 character and set it up properly.  
---
I do have a load of useless/wasted perks/points atm
---
&gt; If you are on Xbox I’ll give each of your characters a set for free.
---
The first hit is ALWAYS free...
---
Why don’t you join us and have a threesome? ;)
---
Awesome,  never to late to learn new things
---
I mean, I fucking loved settlement building in Fallout 4 and it’s what made the game a serious time-sink for me but... it seemed like all everyone else did was bitch about it.
---
If no one else comes along before I get home I can give you a hand trying the team up thing, I'll be a couple hours though
---
Also just to make sure, it's the dirty army fatigues and helmet you're wearing right? 
---
It's been a long time since the beta lmao but I seem to remember if you wore normal fatigues instead of the dirty ones they give you it wouldn't move forward (or something like that)
---
Take a look at this for leveling tips.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ewnmdi/a_guide_to_level_up_fast_in_fallout_76/
---
The most important part will be planning what you want to do at end game, and planning your build out in advance so you know what perks to go for/work towards.
---
Try waiting about 30 mins in the server, or server hop until an event is up and running. If it’s not starting it’s because someone had recently already done the event in the server. Hope this helps.
---
Merci! I'll keep looking for the issue, then.
---
I finally found one near my camp like a month ago and after following it for 10 minutes it walked off a cliff lol. 
---
They are supposed to lead you to loot, correct? This guy failed if so.
---
If you are talking about when you have class freak enabled and don’t see herd mentality in your pipboy screen then you are incorrect.
---
This has been an issue that has never been resolved. Similar to the visual glitch where you have class freak enabled with grounded and it says -12.5% energy damage reduction, but it is actually still -50% reduction. 
---
Also why sell out 5k when people sell them in there for vendors for 300-500 caps.
---
I’ve always done better with my handmade with scorched earth I’m a sneak build so I tend to get spotted and folded up using the laser rifle lol. I usually will use my lever on mobs, then dump into her face with my handmade. 
---
I’m level 275 on my main and I’m just now switching to Ultracite ammo. I’ve been making trades for violet flux and so far I’ve got 5k. I plan on just stocking up on U5.56 for the queen. 
---
Maybe then my AR will see a little more use.
---
There were some skins in the datamines for SCORE a while back, I'll try and find it.
---
True, although I guess the rarity of those plans was unintentional. The other badges were fun for me at least.
---
Lol I’ll make all of them for free. I have plenty of each ahah.
---
Definitely want to focus on sniping etc..I do like popping super mutants heads from a distance.
---
Yes. It is confirmed. Someone nuked the event that I just started &amp; I was just unable to kill the Encyptid before the nuke went off. The event completed &amp; I got a Fixer plan too.
---
It was worth me dying in a nuclear firestorm.
---
Good luck, maybe restarting the computer, not sure I can help further, all the best!
---
Only managed to find them once or twice in a year. Broken game is broke🤣n
---
Trust me, I've been there. Trying to figure out this perk system is a nightmare, especially if you came from FO4 where you could just take everything. It took me til past level 150 before I finally figured out what I wanted to do and get all the points and perks in the right places.
---
Thanks for all the replies everyone. I’m level 85, am able to obtain flux easily, and have a truckload of caps, not to mention I’ve been wanting this mutation for a really long time so I’m gonna go ahead and buy it
---
Nah. The AR is still way below the handmade no matter what you do to it. I’m hoping a .308 receiver could change that.
---
Long term
---
Did you craft anything that needed that junk?
---
Yeah I'm a stealth rifle fan as well, always have been.
---
I'm trying for that Fixer plan.  Thanks for the confirm!
---
That’s a good idea. A free atomic shop item too
---
LOL post removed... how dumb can some people be? You think Mr House isn't related to Fallout 76? Your Pip Boy? Robco. The Santatron collecting lumps of coal at your camp? Robco. The stealth boys you pop to grief level 18 players at a workshop? Robco. Your Liberty Prime power armor skin you paid almost $20 for but hate because it never shuts up? Robco.
---
I'll grant you that Fallout 76 added some players who aren't invested in the history of the game universe. That's fine. And you aren't required to like New Vegas. It's totally ok to have bad taste. But don't try to dictate what is and isn't Fallout. That's silly as shit.
---
I have 19 that I'm looking to sell.
---
Same. On my bloodied build I grab a conduit hide on top the building and do some crowd control on the mobs. Let the tanky people fight the imposter.
---
Did the post get deleted? If so, i should repost it lol
---
thx for that :)
---
It showed as having been removed.
---
It’s for normies. Doesn’t have to be melee necessarily but more often than not it is
---
Only 8 more years, and he'll be a redditor as well.
---
:o, should i be defiant and repost?
---
It IS related to Fallout 76. It's all the same universe amigo. It's bad enough to cape for snitches, but here you are caping for tattletales who don't even know the lore of the game they are playing.
---
There is multiple references to it in both F4 and F76, he don't mind at all.
---
So there’s gonna be a new helmet with a working flashlight, and yet the veteran ranger helmet still can’t get that.
---
It is the most complicated part of the game.  I know how to do anything else in the game and give sombre great advice to people... but when it comes to builds I'm just clueless.  Lol
---
It's your life, friend LOL probably not much point to it.
---
Junkies here. I don't feel like i need anymore damage with my gauss shotgun. Base is 1056 damage and i've seen it over 1400. That's enough to one shot nearly everything. I don't intend to solo a SBQ or a colossus wendigo. So that's good enough for me. 
---
BUT i am gonna try and roll a bloodied gauss. I then i may swap
---
Yes they are getting enough cells for them not so much . But if I prime it’s not too bad as a mag goes along way.. 
---
Still bitter about the Tesla bug
---
Nah it’s all part of fantasy game balance you see... the more powerful something is the more ridiculous or embarrassing a thing will be. See WoW and there more striperific outfits And just plane weird looking items.
---
then they realized that there was almost nothing that a player would not be caught dead in if it gave theme more x“power”x
---
I just hate how people were loving the post to be censored by pricks lol. Admins apparently suck on here
---
May I suggest a Vampires Vanguard build? 
---
With a full set of Vanguard Secret Service Armor I can have more DR/ER than any Power Armor set, and add Sentinels to each of those armor pieces makes you a god. Use Vampire Explosive weapons and you’ll never die or need a stimpack ever again. 
---
Using stuff like Ironclad, Dodgy with Action Boy/Girl, and other perks to reduce the damage you take will also greatly increase your survivability. I actually just made a post here about the Ultimate Tank/Medic build that has been completely overlooked by the Junkies/bloodied/sneak build bandwagons.
---
I don’t run either but I’ve grabbed a few junkies weapons finally, including a gauss so I’m thinking of getting drugged up soon.  Which addictions do you have if u don’t mind me asking?  It’s 5 to cap it out, right?
---
Yeah, If I’m remembering right my semi auto handmade does like 400+ the AR barley breaks 300. Three hundreds not bad tho. Just outclassed indefinitely, especially using that 5.56.
---
That's not the stealth suit, but rather a black skin for the secret service under armor
---
Level 387 here, don’t play meta and never have.  No problems taking on anything.
---
OP, that’s an awesome roll.
---
Xbox?
---
Idk ive sat at my camp building it before and in around 3 hours i was attacked about 7 times. I wouldnt come back all those times thats what i got my turrets for.
---
Yes.
---
I'm pretty sure it's the stealth suit. Look at the feet.
---
Harness
---
How much are you looking to sell one for?
---
The 76 player community is one of the strangest I've ever encountered, in good ways and bad. One of the strangest things about it is there's like this... idk... like rivalry? With fans of Obsidian games, or rather with the games themselves. Like 76 is in competition with NV and Outer Worlds, for example. Like if you're on Team 76 you have to try to shit on the others. Well, it's not really a competition, not at the personal level. It's totally fine and i would say appropriate to like all 3 because all 3 have things that are commendable. All 3 are really fun games. 
---
The rivalry manifests itself in stupid ways like folks pretending the founder of Robco doesn't have anything to do with a Fallout game LOL sorry for the rant
---
Harness.  Random find or sometimes available at Whitesprings shops.
---
That's the shoes you get when you wear the secret service under armor and has the same exact pattern as it too
---
The Moonshiner's Shack, yeah.
---
I think you can find corn there too.
---
I pretty much just log in to do atom challenges sonic an buy Atom Shop shit I don’t need.  Hey h and grind for bullion so I can buy all the new weapons and gear that I don’t want... and scrip Legendaries for legendary modules, so I can try endlessly to get the secret service armor pieces that I’ll never get... and can never trade the value ones I do create but don’t wish to rock myself.
---
.308 is much heavier and has a higher velocity, because it’s a bigger round. At the cost of durability I wouldn’t mind having a .308 assault rifle that easily outdoes the handmade *without nerfing the handmade.*
---
Manual sniper build here. Instigating Gauss rifle and handmade folks 😎👉👉 though I'd love to get my hands on a furious Gatling plasma for my queen killer. Still a good drop, RNG gods be praised!
---
Are you really worried about me ass? Cute comment but what else besides that and a downvote? Fine, keep bitching and see what Bethesda does about it. 
---
You really think I'm not calm? Over Reddit? Over 76? Maybe you're just a bit young there lad.
---
Rant all u want, outer worlds a goid gane, new vegas was my favorite single player fallout and 76 is my favorite game, hes the biggest character in fallout
---
It's the harness. You can buy plans for it at station vendors - I forget which ones though. 
---
It is under armour though. And the one in the picture looks like it is shorts rather than full length trousers -  the plans give you the full length trousers.
---
First of all, thanks for the offer!  
---
However, the question was for a friend and I'm proposing to be the "second player" in this scenario.  I'm just trying to get thoughts on whether this might work and if there are nuances I need to think about.
---
Again, thanks for the offer, though.
---
Yo! I run full vanguard SS armor on my explosive shotgunner and he is an absolute tank. I would also ditch white knight and put those perks into something that effects damage! I also have full adamantium skeleton which is awesome because i can point blank shotgun enemies without worrying about being crippled.
---
If you’re on ps4 i have a junkies/SS cultist dagger i’ll sell to you for super cheap!
---
I like the survival mechanics. I'm going to miss them. I mean its 100% micromanagement but it doesnt bother me.
---
Obviously you weren't a FO4 fan, it seemed every raider in that game wore a pair and dropped them when killed.  :)
---
Ah alright cool :) yeah unfortunately idk if it will work or not lol but I think it's definitely worth a try
---
Rene Auberjonois (his voice actor) died recently so he could be reincarnated as Mr. House
---
Yeah this little convo has made me want it more. Lol they need a suggestion box dammit!!!
---
yeah that is when I got mine. I was told it was never showing up again and then it showed up the end of 2019 like November or December. Then I didn't see it again until this week.
---
I have them sitting in my stash, just in case.
---
I didn’t expect to get so much hate for my opinion tbh
---
Why don't more people use the microphone and talk to them. They may not be able to talk back but they would know your friendly at the least and trying to help.
---
I wasn't checking that.
---
My test is this:
---
1) Don't be grouped
---
2) Have herd mentality
---
3) Remove class freak perk card
---
4) Check S.P.E.C.I.A.L. to see if they are all reduced by two. 
---
(YES).
---
3) Equip max class freak perk card
---
(NO)
---
I know it's real because my carry weight took a hit when I took off max class freak. I got my carry weight back when I re-equipped class freak.
---
I have never seen Herd Mentality for sale at a player vendor, and I looked a lot. Hell, I've only seen Modus sell it twice once I started looking for it. I would have loved to have gotten it for a fraction of what Modus was charging.
---
I did similar, except I got hooked on fallout 4 mods
---
It’s a pity you can’t display the baseball glove.
---
I didnt realize it was :((
---
I'm sorry - I think I must be their target audience this week.  I've been playing for a couple months and haven't spent an atom.  But I just decided to start building in earnest and half the stuff I've been wanting is suddenly available.... and in packs that save me atoms.  Such joy!
---
But sorry for you though.
---
As long as your on xb1 yes bud
---
If they did have a suggestion box it’d be full of pricks like me telling them to fix the fucking game. Like right now, sneak is completely and utterly fucked. I’m sitting totally still, and I’m [      HIDDEN         ], crouched invisible. I have all the sneak perks. I have 35 agility. I haven’t fired a shot yet because I’m still aiming. Then 50 yards away a tweaked out Buffout addict sees me and one taps me despite being completely invisible, not moving, sneaking, having 35 agility and not firing.
---
Well Reddit gonna Reddit. But it’s weird you feel that way. The mutations, the right ones at least, are suppose to make your life easier. To intentionally not use them cu your other characters can’t is kinda short sighted.
---
You would probably have gotten less hate if you just said you were role playing as a BOS character.
---
Check to make sure your flashlight is off.
---
They could add so many things from FO4 that people would definitely buy. They'd make a lot more money selling atoms if they'd just add more FO4 assets to the game. It's a simple as copying and pasting them over considering the whole game uses the same coding as FO4.
---
Yep! For a moment I did. I was at a lower levels camp and crafted a "The Fixer" for him. Im assuming that scrapped my stuff when it was in temporary storage. 
---
I guess that's what I get for being nice lol
---
I'm sorry that happened to you!  FWIW, I don't think you can fast travel while you're taking damage, anyway.
---
Trap camps are not that common, but they seem to be on the rise.  It may be tied to disgruntlement (for some) about the upcoming PVP rules changes (re: no longer bringing the whole team into PVP if one member initiates it).  Unless I'm misremembering the trends, I think we're seeing a lot more reports of cheap trap camps, non-PVP death exploits and exploit-based camp destruction in the last few weeks.  I don't get the appeal, but griefers gonna grief, I suppose.
---
I'm up to level 152 and I got hit with a trap camp for the first time last week.  It was the same gimmick. I bought some cheap scrap and got lasso'd with a framework of punji boards on the way out.  I vaguely remember there being Tesla arcs and radiation emitters lined up on the top of the fence as well, but it happened fast.
---
Fortunately all I lost was 50 caps and the scrap I'd just purchased.  I had just dumped my junk inventory beforehand. That's the best advice: store your scrap before you go shopping.  Light Footed will help, although it's certainly not a sure thing (only works when sneaking, does nothing for manually triggering traps).  There really isn't much you can do once you're in a cheap trap like that, so the most you can do is minimize potential losses.
---
It’s also unrealistic for mini nukes to suck so bad. Balance is definitely needed
---
I just put like 3 complete sets of trapper gear in my vendor after somewhat getting decent SS armor.  
---
Guess there script now.  I know it’s trapper but they all got good rolls.  Trapper is my favorite looking armor.  Yea, I don’t know why but I love the look.
---
I have ago at 15, and using the main story stealth armor I can move around in crouched position and never get hit. If I stay still they will shoot at where I am.
---
Yeaaaaap.
---
I'm disappointed that having communist items in your CAMP doesn't provoke Liberty Prime attacks.
---
Do you have legendary weapons with a build to match? If not, that’s probably your problem. A bloody build with a bloody deathclaw gauntlet has no problem inflicting damage and getting rewards, but a regular dagger or machete is not going to cut it.
---
Yeah. There's 2 guides i've seen on getting addictions. 
---
One is to take 5 as quick as possible. And the other is to alternate stuff so daddy-o then alcohol then daddy-o then alcohol etc. 
---
I have 
---
Alcohol chr - 1 agi -1
---
Daddy-o int -1 per -1
---
daytripper chr-1 lck -1
---
mentats chr -1 
---
psycho dmg res -1 str -1 
---
Could probably find something better instead of psycho. BUT really. 1 str doesn't matter much when everything just dies so quickly. And my DR is 552 which is fairly decent
---
Hold on a minute isn't this a 76 thread
---
Damn man, I’ve yet to have that problem. Are you on Xbox? I think my agi is like 24 or something and I run two harder to detect pieces. I was even showing off too my sister last night that I can almost touch the super mutants at west tek and they don’t detect me. 
---
Maybe it’s the NPC humans?? I haven’t really noticed. 
---
I just would like to not have to travel to 76 every other time I die. Feels like a kick in the nuts.
---
Under armour, **LAME**
---
If  that dude is anything like me i just like to blow up every car i see.  Makes me laugh, everytime.
---
Not to mention the abundance of settlement customization mods available for FO4.
---
Radiation counts for bloodied, adrenal reaction mutation, and nerd rage. That's how most people manage their bloodied builds. Get rads to bring health down to the level you want and you can use stimpacks without taking you out of nerd rage or maximum damage from adrenal reaction and bloodied.
---
And this is why I'm running around in the tattered dress, +1 perception.   It would be less bad if those little boots didn't have heels.
---
You are a Saint for confirming this, thank you.
---
Pity it is. I bought the plans when I first started the game, was pretty disappointed it was. That said it was ok back then as I was sporting leather armour, so it looked fine. But wish it could be an actual outfit too.
---
Same goes for road leathers, undershirt and jeans and the checked shirt and jeans. All under armour. Such a shame.
---
What will the Shielded stats be?
---
Its getting upgrades. They are in the PTS patch notes. You will have to spend bullion on the plans.
---
Sometimes I can walk by a high level elite no problem but level threes see right through me. Weird.
---
Not sure about Sawyer, but seems like Locke would be a high intelligence, perception, and luck character.
---
Nice. Question... what's secret service armour and sentinels?  Been off this game for over a year...
---
Your testing is flawed. It has been stated many times by many people including the community mangers that they have no intention of class freak reducing herd mentality, empath, carnivore, or herbivore.
---
Before wastelander dropped I respec my main character and added herd mentality thinking that they had changed it, but it was always -2 when not in a team  and with class freak 3 on. 
---
You should test again. I assume that your tested it by grouping with a friend checking stats and then leaving team. Correct? In a lot of cases unless you leave the world and return the server still considers you “grouped”. I would suggest leaving the server and returning with class freak on to see your stats are still at -2. 
---
Additionally you on Xbox, ps4, pc? I usually keep one of each in my vendors, but it makes sense people may not sell it cuz I’m a lot of cases people play primarily alone and class freak doesn’t apply to the mutation correctly.
---
Says every IT guy in this thread....
---
I have a 1* bloodied hm for you and you just have to keep playing stay grinding out dailies and scrpit and must do trading to get better gun. Make sure your card setup is on point I'm not going to tell you how to do it but you need to read the cards and pic the right ones 😉
---
It’s not an RP thing, I just think they take away some of the challenge out of the game. They are better than they should be in my opinion. I feel like they should have bigger drawbacks compared to what you get for having them.
---
I just want a dog.
---
1. Not really
---
2. Not really
---
3. Not really
---
4. Rng
---
5. Buy one from another player
---
6. Really only the ss armor. It can roll uny. It's just rng again
---
7.  Buy one. Go to the market sub and try your luck
---
Bolstering is an okay alternative to unyielding. but most people use Unyielding stuff. you can find legendary gear from legendary enemies or try trading for them on a trading subreddit. since Bloodied/Unyielding is "top tier" expect to pay a fair chunk for them, some being item trades only
---
There's literally a fallout subreddit for the whole franchise, which is the reason i say it's fair to complain. The dude is not from 76, Aka not relevant on a subreddit exclusively for 76.
---
But I also said i find it weid to Complain, because it's a simple and Nice post, but it's fair game to complain.
---
I hope they see this and ask you to send some reference photos, that'd be cool to see your Grandma's quilts actually in-game
---
Mr.house a good character I do say
---
Sentinels is you take less damage when standing still.
---
Secret Service Armor is an end-game Armor that you get from turning in Gold Bullion at the end of the main quest (regardless of who you side with, the guys in the Vault sell the plan - then you need Legendary Modules from Purveyor to make it)
---
This dude 100% I see him EVERYWHERE. Bought mine from him lol.
---
Well the 1star b handmade or fixers I have only found one for 8k asked the owner if he would lower it to 5k and I snatched it up.might if been overpriced.i have rolled bloody weapons like combat rifle but its rare.best bet is to trade on market forum.find weapons people want.i traded executioners  explosive  lever for 25k and they even threw in some unyielding piece I needed.i thought that gun was trash but it was worth it to that guy
---
moooOOOo
---
Surprised I don’t see more people agreeing with this.  I feel like one way for characters to be ruined is to be added as allies in my opinion.
---
I'm just ground out with 76. This is all just another example of Bethesda being cheap AF: instead of adding new content, they focus on adding layer upon layer of grind.
---
Instead of making QOL fixes and features (like passive perk slots that everyone has been asking for), we get pablum "legendary" perks that are, at best, underwhelming. On top of that, then they add \*a friggin cost\* to change out those Lego perks. And to buy the perks, they add a NEW currency and even more grind.
---
We spend real money on stuff from the Atom Shop just have it be broken on the next patch (water wheel, et al) along with items that are missing obvious features (prefabs that are weird sizes and don't snap to existing foundations, outfits missing obvious keywords, et al).
---
Now we're going to get a "big" update that has the biggest stuff they promised stripped out of it because they keep trying to do the absolute minimum and people are finally calling their lazy, cheap asses out.
---
And don't get me started on them basically flipping Fallout 1st members the bird after we've already given them our money. God awful technicolor vomit armor paints, 57 outfits which are all just slight variations on the same, tired outfit, etc. People keep saying that we're getting the promised "F1st Atom Store discounts" but...where are they? Are they giving us shadow discounts and not telling us? Because, if so, that's fucking moronic from a marketing standpoint.
---
I've been a staunch supporter of the game since the first day of the beta. Hell, I stream the damn game 6 days a week on Xbox. But I'm getting to the point that I just can't anymore. The lack of new content and just endless grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind is just getting to me.
---
I love whitespring.  All thise robot vendors in the resort.  I call it the robot mall.  😁  Plus if you are on the grounds, all the sentry bots and assaultrons will protect you from ghouls, snallygasters, mutants, etc.
---
snoogans
---
How much?
---
With the current state of affairs with the maga crowd and rising tensions between the u.s and China I'm beginning to worry fallout is a prediction. Of the future
---
1. Mixing your armour to have a bolstering peice or two can be a way to help with staying alive. Full Unyeilding is most effective when using Melee. 
---
2. Staying alive shouldn't be too hard if your running Dodgy (Agility) Nerd Rage (Intelligence) and Serendipity (Luck) these combined should keep you from folding. 
---
3. Not really however toxic goo from west tek means you can manage your rads on the go by just drinking one. 
---
4. It's all Rng. However only roll 2* weapons to get yourself a starter weapon easier. Only go for 3* once you have that 2* (Be aware Mumbles will not drop a Fixer until you have learned how to craft it)
---
5. Possibly from player vendors. 
---
6. Secret Service armour is the best in slot and can be Unyeilding as you craft it yourself. 
---
7. Again best chance player vendors or trade sub. 
---
Hope any of this helps.
---
1. Not really, stick with Uny, the stat boost is insanely useful.
---
2. Stick with what works for you, I run a mix of various Secret service Uny stuff. Harder to detect, lower ammo weight, lower weapon weight etc.
---
3. I use food and toxic waste to keep my hp low ish. You can use a gamma gun though as well. 
---
4. 'Cause RNG, it can be a bitch.
---
5. Luck, hit up all the vendors and hope you get lucky. Or trade your first born for a god rolled one.
---
6. Secret service armor, which yes can be unyielding.
---
7. See 5.
---
Market starts at 300, You can sell them to npc vendors for 300, so listing them less than that is someone trying to hook it up, not make a profit.
---
What platform? I'm PS4
---
First time I played, a guy dropped me a legendary axe and cranberry relish. So, the other day I dropped some cranberry cobbler to a new guy. Pay it forward.
---
There is half a shack with a jeep next to it between Knifes Edge and Pricketts Point ( AKA the place you pick up the bones for the burial daily.) That has almost all of the bears in it.  In the attic portion of the shack. You have to jump repeatedly while spamming pick-up key depending on your controller. Just head towards Knifes Edge from the far west side next to the road at Prickett's point. It's off the road to the right through some trees.
---
Well, normally 10k caps, but I’m more interested / need materials. I’d take a good offer of steel or lead.
---
1. Sure there is. I rock a Chameleon piece for extra stealth. Some wear Auto-stim to help save them from a possible one-shot.
---
2. It does. You'll still want some pretty high Damage Resistances to help stray shots or sneaky mobs from killing you. Just because your health is low, doesn't mean you need to be one-hit killable.
---
3. Radiation is how you stay below the health threshold. Giving yourself Rads is how you maintain your health level. So you'll want to keep some Rad-X (diluted and regular) and some Diluted RadAway for when you're taking too much. If you die and respawn or accidentally cure too many Rads, carry something like Toxic Goo with you to intentionally give yourself more Radiation and keep your levels in check.
---
4. RNG
---
5. Trading Subs or Luck and Patience.
---
6. Absolutely. SS armor has great defense and if you've got enough Legendary Modules and materials you can keep making them until you get the pieces you want. I have an Unyielding Chest Piece I put a Jetpack on, not bothering with the limbs though. Also, the weapons you make from Bullion Plans can be Bloodied.
---
7. See Number 5. I bought my Bloodied Lever Action from a trading sub. Then I traded a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate Handmade I got from Fasnacht for a Bloodied Explosive Handmade; as I run Rifleman and not Commando.
---
Full glass walls would be amazing too
---
I think Sawyer would be high in perception and charisma
---
=(
---
Home of the Brave! 
---
*liberty prime looks so depressed*
---
The game is very much balanced around the casual experience, and has no challenge whatsoever outside of PvP.
---
Yeah that's a sweet drop that. I also love AWOL, nice and easy and guaranteed 3* enemy.
---
It is possible to ditch PA and remain heavy weapons, I did. The key is which armor set you plan on using, bloodied you need unyielding set with sentinel, if it’s junkies or just using AA weapons, vanguard armor is definitely useful. This is my build currently, specializing in energy heavy weapons and using a full set of unyielding armor.
---

---
:/ i just found this out about an hour ago. On the plus side i found a picture of a lighthouse i can display
---
Oh huh, I didn't know that. I never spent gold on the underarmor since it (currently) has no mods.
---
There are instructions online...
---
Looked pretty easy, I was fortunate not to have to do it
---
What about something like text chat?  How is that not around after nearly 2 years?
---
I wasnt going to till I found out their adding mods to it in the newest update giving it +4 strength
---
dont buy from modus, seriums cost 3-500 at players vendors
---
Your logic works from a programmers prospective it should fix the issue but the spaghetti code they made might literally explode if you try it. 
---
My advice would make sure the unbugged player does everything for the quest. Clicks all inputs etc.
---
The worst part is they don't even follow their own rules. I've reported threads where exploits were used by the OP in their camp, the OP admitted as much, and the moderators here told them to change the wording up to sound less like an exploit and they would let it fly.   
---
Kings of ethics I tell you.
---
I feel like everyone would like to see... more
---
It means fully naked Samuel has a crush on her. He should probably put on some clothes to start.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that wants to hear more "Big Boom"
---
I don't really see this competition, if anything there was a segment of overall fallout fans declaring outer worlds the 76 killer right before it released, but since it's totally died out.
---
Yeah, I've seen quite a few items I'd like to put in my camp.  Industrial machinery, electrical panels, control boards with blinky lights, stuff like that.  Then there's camp-placeable versions of junk items, so you can drop your stuffed bears and such directly on the floor instead of in a display case.
---
I kind of wonder how much backlash there would be about that, though.  I can certainly see people being a little upset about no-effort offerings if they were sold at the same price point as new items.
---
If they created a new category of items- unmodified world decor- it seems like they'd sell well.  I expect many folks would pay 1200 or more for a complete set of all the junk stuffed animals (all the bears, Mr. Fuzzies, etc.) in a camp-placeable form without needing display shelves.  I know I'd pay at least that much for a full set of wall-hung and floor-mounted industrial electrical components and machinery.
---
r/woooosh
---
Except if someone living in Appalachia wants to show off their heritage or something?
---
Begins June 30th!
---
There's two sinks, a rustic one that occasionally hits the atom shop and a clean one coming with the first season rewards.
---
MOTHERLODE REMEMBERS
---
I have 3,000 steel I Believe I could throw in some caps for the rest
---
Yeah, maybe add in strength also.
---
It seems to work the other way around, my camp got attacked by liberators while I was prepping for this photo 😂
---
Yeah, pretty sweet for melee.
---
We can definitely work something out. GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR
---
I'll be on a little later, got some work to do.
---
Do it.
---
Sounds good man
---
Thank you very much
---
Yeah, but it's not necessary... if all 3 pylons are actually* taken the imposter sometimes gets taken out in around a minute. If you're on xbox make a post on the LFG page and plenty of people will show up.
---
It’s because he had to endure this photo shoot when he could’ve been using this time to hunt down those pesky commies!
---
Those are no easy fixes by any means. I agree we need more stuff for building too but it's not as easy to implement as you think it is
---
I went on a hike sometime after I had started playing a few months ago. I saw a pile of twigs and my legitimate, first thought when I saw them was 'I should scrap that for wood.'
---
It's my birthday too! Happy birthday to all three of us, lol!
---
not even enough for a damn PA skin.
---
jesus christ.
---
Thx for the tips.  If you don’t mind me using you like google again; Does  mentats addiction affect grape mentats at all or do they still work?
---
If you're on PC, I might have a furious gatling laser still, haven't been able to play for a couple days.  I have a two shot gatling laser I'm looking to offload as well.  Maybe 1,000 caps each.
---
This game lacks a lot of basic features.
---
Hiding helmets is one on the long laundry list of basic features that have been in MORPG games for years but for some reason are not in this game.  We still don't even have a 100% safe and reliable way to transfer items between characters or to safely trade items between two different players without involving a 3rd party.  Who knows it will take before this game has basic QOL features like hide helmet etc.  Look how long it has taken for perk loadouts for Todd sakes
---
Rng on solar pieces is terrible... i spent approx 1800 vault steel so far and still not even close to have a just „good“ set together... i got quite a few good unyielding or bolstering pieces, but who wants to play low hp with a solar set xD?
---
Lol. Too funny
---
I’m curious about the ammo converter and how much ammo will cost or give
---
That's still not implemented?? Haven't played in a year lol
---
Yep. Stealth commando bloodied build wrecks a lot of stuff while still being fairly safe.
---
Cool! Thanks.
---
Look again there are LOADS of power armor skins
---
I loooooved their questline so much (maybe because the Mire is my favourite place, but anyways)
---
What is the range in Solar armor? And I’ve only gotten one Van piece thus far
---
FU.
---
I'm not sure if there is really something new in it that wasn't already done in FO4 respectively has the groundwork done in FO76. Also some of the more requested things like placing stuff on shelves could be rather trivial, as we can already replicate this by some dirty hacks with rugs and stuff.
---
Is it sad that I'm most excited about the clean sink?
---
Me as well, Im also glad it's rank 5 and not a later rank.
---
Actually I am on PC, I might be willing to make a deal. IGN is OL_Doc. I'm on almost every night around midnight eastern time. Let me know! 👍
---
I'll have to ask you not to take Todd's name in vain. Have a blessed day.
---
It gives you a ton of rewards , not just Atom's(skins, camp items, weapons, etc). For doing the things we already normally do in game, and it's free. So what are you complaining about ?
---
yeah crappy ones.
---
The rewards look pretty neat. I wonder how long it'll take to rank up if it lasts till mid September.
---
If it hasn't been announced, its probably not happening.
---
Still not in the game..
---
Fast travel rugs have been requested sooooo many times on this sub .
---
WOW! I am really impressed with these rewards. I really thought it would be very cheap but there is some really good rewards there in my opinion. I can not wait!
---
Also, did they say there would be Fallout 1st exclusive rewards or was that down the line in S2?
---
That I can't recall. I saw a comment in an older reddit post when the PTS went live a while back that lasted its stats, and they were definitely higher than anything we currently have. But I couldn't find the post after some searching earlier.
---
it's the fact you're losing alot of atoms you normally get from doing weeklies/dailies. and then you get to choose what you want from the store.
---
You get 1500 atom a month. Plus the tent, the unlimited scrap space, private servers and the Ranger outfit
---
Lol what?
---
Outside of already having pre-ordered Cyberpunk 2077, NMS and DayZ are the next two games I was looking at. Really into the survival genre right now with an emphasis on cooperation rather than PvP.
---
I have had multiple times that when I am in caution that they are already firing at me
---
in b4 people complaining  about getting less Atoms while we are going to get a lot of free stuff from the season.
---
I have a baseball theme with the statue and bats on the wall. I even have a home base in a display. I really want to display the gloves.
---
Can you read? I was getting free stuff before that I would use. I already addressed the fact that I dont care for about 85% of the pass. Mainly because I have variants of some of the items they've chosen to reskin. I'm aware that it isn't just atoms.
---
" We may add extra Fallout 1st bonus rewards in the future, but want to focus on getting Season 1 in game first and seeing your thoughts." Is what they stated.
---
Probably the most back story in fallout
---
That's mostly because Preston did bitch about it - it actively discouraged building new settlements. I for myself built the starting town mostly and maybe a couple of other settlements that had a mechanic tied to it (artillery), but ignored the rest because it only leads to more bitching...
---
If they'd have implemented some meaningful gameplay mechanic to settlements it would have been different. Also the inconsistency was kind of a turnoff, scrap this but not this, settlers hammering the same spot without fixing it, enemies spawning inside your walls etc...
---
Yeah I think that is one of the core reasons that the new ES6 and starfield keep getting pushed back more and more.I want to say it was 2017 when they said they were developing a new engine.  I expect 2 more years of this janky old ass engine on their games as they said do not expect either game anytime soon.
---
3. 
---
1 texture for each set of P.A
---
2 variants of the same P.A skin
---
New Vegas has always been my favorite fallout
---
Thank you! I saw that in the FAQ after I posted.
---
That's from Fallout 1st. What does that have to do with the season pass?
---
So this is one of those things where I dont play a Day and Im fked
---
With how rng legendary gear is in this game I have no idea why you would want to do that.
---
As a bloodied stealth commando you will want to go full unyielding. This is to help maintain the stealth part. They can't shoot/hit what they can't see.
---
With regard to resistances once you approach 200dr you'll see diminishing returns, at 250+dr more Dr is pointless. Therefore just go with a full set of unyielding but with the best mods you can. I would really advise against mixing with bolstering - go unyielding or go home.
---
If you are feeling squishy make sure you have serendipity 3 equipped, blocker 3 and maybe fireproof (for sb attacks and explosions). 
---
The final piece of advice is to watch this video by angry turtle: https://youtu.be/-W1DPhUCRpQ
---
Tldw: get speed demon and maxout lifegiver.
---
think this will lasts 3 months? i would guess
---
Its my favorite single player fallout
---
Thanks for the info! For the Secret Service armor, is that something I can craft or is that legendary drops? Sorry I'm a bit new to the game. 
---
Thanks for the tip on white knight too - any tips on which perks you like using? I'm mostly just testing different set ups and so far it's be a blast! 
---
I'm on XB1 unfortunately, but thank you!
---
Well, certainly better than just leaving it on the ground.
---
This is bethesda we're talking about, they're surprised by the most mundane stuff.
---
I’ve gotten some half decent drops from legendaries before. But only legendaries I find out in the world, never from the queen.
---
Thanks for reply, I looked as well but couldn’t find that info. I guess we’ll see soon enough.
---
150 hours might be one month yeah
---
Where should I go if I want to find this note?
---
my apologies xD
---
I’ll try to answer all your questions to the best of my abilities. 
---
1-Bloodied weapon means they do more damage the lower your health is. Regardless if you have unyielding armor or you’re walking around naked. The bloodied weapon will still do the same damage (except for melee of course)  since the unyielding gives you more strength, which means more melee damage. So to answer your question, yes, you “could” use other armor besides unyielding, but why would you? If you can find any armor that’s worth more than having +3 to your stats, let me know. 
---
2-As a bloodied build I rarely ever die. Exception being when I fight the scorchebeast queen. Her melee attacks insta kill me. Other than that. 90% of my deaths are me falling for more than 5 feet and dying of fall damage. So if you’re dying so easily, check your perks and damage resistance, chances are your defence is way too low. 
---
3-If you want to keep your health low, without rads or mutations, then yes you can. Don’t get the healing factor mutation, and just fight enemies until your health gets low enough. Then heal by eating small amounts of food to not completely heal all the way up. It’s possible, but honestly so much work. I rather just get radiation damage and control it with a radaway here and there. 
---
4-If you want a really good 3 star legendary, and you decide to take a gamble with the “mole miner” vendor. That’s exactly what it is. A gamble. You could get a really crappy useless instigating pipe pistol, vampire death tambo, furious lead pipe. Or a really good explosive fixer, furious fixer, bloodied fixer. You either get something really shitty, normal, or really good. It’s a gamble. 
---
5- you keep trying your luck and hope that the mole miner will eventually give you a bloodied fixer, between 1-3 stars. Or you go and buy one from a vendor. But don’t expect them to be cheap either. Be ready and willing to pay 1-3,000 caps. 
---
6-as for the gold bullion, you have cosmetic stuff for your camp. And of course the weapons and armor. Although I’m a melee build, I know I can easily switch my perks around. So I made sure to buy the gauss shotgun and mini gun plan. I still haven’t gotten a bloodied version for either of them. As for armor, I only cared about the secret service because of the jet pack. Since I hate wearing power armor.  It all depends on your preference. Eventually you’ll have everything bought anyways. 
---
7- you can buy one from another player. You can pray and hope the next legendary enemy you kill drops it for you. Or you can get it from the mole miner. Also this is VERY important. (If I’m wrong please correct me) You will NEVER get a legendary weapon for the fixer UNLESS you got the plan for it.
---
When you are doing the crane treasure hunt mission there’s a terminal which talks about house using robco for his own personal experiments etc
---
Creative use of stairs and the half floor sections. Norespawns shows how to do it about 3 minutes into this video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaayB6aWCHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaayB6aWCHI) )
---
Yeah exactly my attitude. It is completely illogical that we can't recycle it. Be better if we could make other ammo rather than the points thing but better than what we have now. Which is dump ammo all day long in my case.
---
Have you seen the rate at which it will change ammo types to another? It’s basically useless
---
If you like i’ll send you a pic of my perk loadout after work today!
---
Secret Service armor is available you complete wastelanders! You get gold bullion by completing daily quests and trading in treasury notes for bullion! Then you use that to buy the plans and craft the pieces.
---
In the mean time combat armor makes an excellent subsitution.
---
It's a massive reduction of atoms per month. That's assuming you even get to rank 100. For the average person, that's not likely to happen so it's even worse on average for them.
---
Just on the atom front. It might balance out ok in terms of cosmetics and items for them but mileage would differ for each person depending on what they're into.
---
secret service chest armor, and the jetpack mod for it, set u back over 3k gold for those plans
---
Have you tried going through the Burrows again? Most of the time one of the Gutsies at the end is usually a legendary.
---
Getting free stuff for the sake of getting free stuff is a bit meaningless when none of the rewards interest you. This doesn’t apply to me but I get where those disappointed are coming from: before Seasons, they got to choose what they wanted from the store with their Atoms, it was *their choice*, now they’re receiving less currencies for that and are being given specific items they didn’t ask for.
---
It was bound to happen, it’s impossible for rewards to please everybody.
---
I think people are upset because the choice is now gone.  Before you earned atoms and chose what you spent them on.  Now it's just like hey you get this whether you like it or not but at least its free!
---
Get ready for the grind.
---
Don’t crucify me for this but what are the burrows?
---
Any ammo conversion is better than having to dump it all at train stations. So glad this is becoming an option.
---
I've lost track of the number of missiles I've dropped.
---
I could start my own cold war
---
Nah i want that too 🙃
---
I've seen enough at 200, 250 and a couple of times at 100 to not consider 300 the starting price. It's closer to 200.
---
It may be the same deal as with the Gauss Minigun, in which case you need to get the prime capacitor for the normal plasma gun to unlock the ammo. I imagine it's something they just overlooked, hopefully they will fix it soon.
---
You must be looking at a different Atom Shop then, up until the most recent 4th July themed one the Atom Shop has been great.
---
This week's update was absolutely awful though.
---
What changes were made to flamers/flame damage?
---
I usually get 2 minimum before the gutsy in the burrows and as much as 5.  I have never not got at least 2 legendaries there and done it on Private Servers so I get them all.
---
The season starts on the 30th but the score system doesn’t start till July 14th? 
---
I’m confused, so we won’t be able to progress the scoreboard until July?
---
So you want them to give the same atom amounts as it is now and free stuff from the season?  
---
Seriously... people forget that this is MMO with dedicated servers that they have to maintain each month while make profit of it. Jezzz
---
The Sewers of Harper’s Ferry. Huge buildup and kinda decent letdown for a lot of people. But there’s tonnes of ghouls in there, and robots at the end.
---
And it comes right at the beginning, so no one can be mad about that thing!
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but anything from that dlc will likely never return, since those are big mountain exclusives.
---
I'm just glad it's available at a low rank and not a high one. Was concerned that it'd only be available to those that buy their way to it or grind it out for several hundred hours.
---
Legendaries spawn all over the map... But for the best results you're going to want places that spawn lots of mobs. You can add Huntersville, West-Tek and The Satellite Array to your list of places to go. You can also go to Watoga and climb up to the roof of the Civic Centre for the super mutants, and if you're jet pack capable you can get to the roof of the Medical building and enter from there to get the ghouls. Basically any place around the bog is good to go check for legendaries. You can continue northward into the Mire as well, basically if it's not Scorched at a place you should go clear it out.
---
This thing fucked me the fuck up goddamn.  Im level 24 and my best gun is an 83d marksman’s .308 rifle, not great against a legendary level 50.  Gotta go lick my wounds and work on some easier quests, spent all my ammo and all of my guns broke.  Was left with no aid, all my armor broken, and no guns.  All I had was a dagger and made one final stand, though it was futile.
---
Shouldn't it says you can also earn SCORE by doing Publlic Events and earn XP.
---
You can’t spend Atoms to rank up until July 14. They don’t want somebody with $150 buying all ranks from day one. Well, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind but I get it.
---
I have a friend who uses it with an auto recover and they have no issues, and I use a charging barrel and it does fine.
---
Why is it useless? Yes the rate isnt good but its free ammo.  
---
And the bloody thing is free too! Why are you mad?!
---
I tested by myself on my private server. I've been using this config since wastelanders. On PC.  I was extremely skeptical about the zero penalty aspect of herd mentality and max class freak. Nukes&amp;dragons perk planner showed the zero penalty effect. People on reddit talked about the zero penalty effect.  
---
I gave it a shot and you won't believe what I discovered.
---
Oh you can still take as many drugs as you want. i usually down psychobuff before the sbq fight (extra 25% damage is always good). So you can still get your better barter prices. 
---
I have the BioCommMesh mod for my torso which makes chems last 50% longer as well. If you're a junkie you may as well abuse those chems.
---
I've experienced this too. They made it lay on its chest instead of back. What a shame.
---
It’s not an automatic ammo to point process?  Where did you see the info?
---
I have the prime capacitor for the normal plasma cast or do you mean like plasma gun
---
Ohhhh, man...I’m beyond excited for the rewards but would’ve been great to get this a few days sooner
---
better not see those lunchboxes and supply packs outside of the seasons.
---
and yeah just like a thought, a hard nerf for free atoms. some good rewards but alot of derivatives though with all those ghillie suits and "onslaught" PA paints ect.
---
i really think this is a worse deal than just getting atoms like we were and buying what we want. with this system you better like captain cosmos or ghillie or its RIP for you. those skins would normally be a pack but they took them and stretched the PA skin and ghillie suits into like 40% of the rewards, with most of the rest of them being complete filler. 
---
also this is the only way bethesda could ever get scrap kits into my inventory, they will immediately get used or destroyed because they arent even worth the .1lb of nuisance weight
---
Do you have a link to the rates please? Can't find it on the main post.
---
Best ones I got I traded for. Literally everything else wasn’t worth the weight.
---
Cry yourself to sleep you fuckin baby
---
The picture of Dewey holding a golf club wearing a vault 111 uniform: “The Future Is now old man”
---
https://ibb.co/fYnLgzp
---
&gt;or do you mean like plasma gun
---
Yep!  
---
You have to get the prime capacitor for the Gauss Rifle to be able to craft the ammo to use it in the Gauss Minigun. I expect you're dealing with the plasma version of the same issue here.
---
I just want the concert building set and the train building set from fallout 4
---
Im relatively new, and dont believe i saw that event yet, is it a public one? Or do you have to complete some quest to get it?
---
Using stealth with comando will cut ammo consumption in half or better.  It’s pretty much mandatory.  Bloodied/stealth/comando was my favorite character for a long time.  
---
These days I favor a bloodied/PA/heavy build.  I’m not in PA constantly, just for battle.  With Life Giver 4 and Energency Protocols I’m pretty tanky - not unkillable, but durable.  I use a B .50 cal as a daily driver, then a primed version (and a primed B Minigun) for Queen fights.  
---
I too hate being in PA all the time.  Getting out of it and enjoying my Unyeilding armor makes it tolerable.  Also, nice not creeping around all the time.  It was frustrating when team mates would agro everything, denying me sneak criticals.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfknkr/happy_birthday_to_one_of_the_most_important/
---
In response to 1 and 2, I have a bloodied rifleman character with 4 pieces of unyielding and 1 chameleon piece.
---
While we're up to our shenanigans in Appalachia what's he up to over there? Anyone got a detailed timeline?
---
I run around the cranberry bog. Start at the Fissure site where you nuke the Queen, then run over to the Abandoned bog town, then run to Fort defiance and back to the Fissure. Do it all on foot, don't fast travel.  I can get about 6 to 10 legendaries, sometimes more doing that. Scorch beast, super mutants, mirelurk queens, Sheepsquatch, cultists, robots and more. It's a quick way to level up too.
---
Take a break? It’s quite annoying seeing video game posts where “I have played this game a long time and there’s nothing to do”.
---
Maybe it’s a sign. Fucks sake
---
Yeah I switched my plasma caster to use prime ultracite cartridge ammo but I don't have the option to craft ammo so yeh probably do need plan for guess rifle capacitor
---
So 150 atoms x 9 = 1350 atoms.... Every what 12 weeks? I could get 500 minimum a week. So in 3 weeks I'd have more..... Thats a hell of a nerf bethesda.....
---
Whoa whoa, let’s not get so hostile. I’m just asking for recommendations?
---
Hope so... Lets see...
---
No rads in those steaks is nice when sporting a bloodied build. I would be thankful as a lvl 300.
---
Every location in the game has a chance to spawn a legendary enemy.  The more enemies you have in a certain location the greater chance of a legendary spawning in their place. 
---
There are events that always have legendary enemies in them as well:
---
 AWOL armaments,  Any horde event, Riding shotgun, Uranium fever, ect...
---
You really dont need legendary weapon to kill things easily.
---
I used a crafted weapon with the best mods up until lvl 70 when I found my first decent legendary weapon (was months after release with hardly any market at that time). Now you can buy decent legendary gear from player vendors easily and fairly cheap. I always sell good legendaries on mine for decent prices.
---
more useful that 10k 38 rounds
---
A red, ring bound folder? Nice!
---
I’m gonna check that out today! Thank you!
---
It’s a house divided. If you aren’t a heavy atom shop purchaser, then you won’t care as much about less atoms. But the “look at all the free items” argument is kinda dumb. People won’t use 75% of what they are given. So yeah they’re free. Cool. I guess. 
---
It’s clearly about that money as you can tell from all the mentions of atoms in the article. Nice “buy atoms and rank up” graphic at the end too. And the included atoms with fallout 1st just became more attractive to those that were getting them from the dailies.
---
I’m gonna give it a go on my private today!
---
It IS better than nothing but the conversion rates are not ideal you will only use it once in a blue moon when you actually get enough "ammo script" from "selling" your ammo to the machine which you use the buy a different ammo. Here's a link for anyone wanting to know the conversion rates:   
---
[Ammo Converter Rates by JuiceHead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K96B4c659Hc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=343)
---
you seeking revenge is causing that
---
I for one prefer this to the current system.
---
Awesome! I haven’t looked that way yet, thanks for the recommendation!
---
Coming into 76 about a month ago I was hoping the building would be like fallout 4, with all the little shortcuts and tricks that came with it. Boy was I wrong. Can’t even get a foundation all the way into the damn ground.
---
I think it would have served them better if they had 1 or 2 additional "ongoing" rewards like the Ghillie and Atomic Onslaught paints.  Because, to be blunt, it just looks cheesy how most ten level sets look almost identical, with the exception of what armor the paint mods.  It's easy to see that they are stretching it really thin.  They needed something else to mix it up a bit.
---
Not a public event so it stays pretty lowkey, i don't believe there are any pre requisites. Its over at the RobCo research center just at the top of Cranberry Bog, its 3 waves of level 52 Gutsy robots, they can be a pain in the ass for lower levels
---
will the atomic shop still be there with weekly updates, and this season game board is just to spice up the daily/weekly stuff? (no I havent kept myself updated on this new stuff as I should have...)
---
It's not the repetition that makes Daguerre so detestable, it's that she says the dumbest, most annoying things. Gramps can talk about his tension and finger all he wants and I will never get tired of it because he's funny and has a likable personality.
---
Thats probaply quite simple. They find other things more important. Text chat might be important to us, but its quite... boring and small as a feature in its own. Speaking of personal experience Bethesda probaply wants stuff thats flashy and gets attention to the game. Think of things like wastelanders, nuclear winter etc. Those things are much more marktable then text chat and will get more money in the bank from peopel buying it. Sadly thats how a lot of software and game development stuff works. 
---
Team members such as developers,artist etc have quite a lot of good ideas but money needs to be made. So often new flashy things get higher priority then some small bugs of quality if life improvements.
---
Happy Birthday!
---
Yes that whole quest was well written/voiced she's a great character.
---
I'm sure also that there's additional hidden bunkers out there in the mire that perhaps haven't been discovered yet...or infiltrated with the GECK root stuff
---
Pretty much
---
Ha I didn’t even know there was a new exploit but yeah good luck with a pre-season fix.
---
I made 30+ ultracite plasma cores, never used more that 10 and there all depleted wtf is going on
---
50 \* 7 \* 10 = 4200
---
150 \* 10 = 1500
---
ya, its pretty hard nerf, its basically reducing free atoms to what you currently get for weeklies
---
HaHa they didn't use weapons in The Cold War, that's why it's called The *Cold* War.
---
There's also a bug going on right now that is causing junk items to be directly scrapped from your display cases even when your camp is placed.
---
it says june 30-mid sept, thats only 75 days, so the obvious implication there is that you can progress multile levels per day, or they are forcing you to buy levels.
---
Too true lol!
---
Scorchbeasts seem to spawn as legendary fairly often, I'd make a circuit of the fissure sites that spawn them (then hop servers).
---
It's not as well known right now and it's kind of a PITA to put yourself into godmode and the exploit requires you to have duped a lot of supplies as well.  That being said people on the RMT sites are actually charging money to help you do the exploit so its a bigger deal than people think.   Even more so when people find out they can use it to abuse seasons.
---
Mine is the same size as the first tier of a power transmission tower....either 3x3 or 3x4, depending on the floor, and 3 floors.  
---
Had to get creative with lighting so you can see stuff at night.
---
I can’t prove or disprove the contractor one, so it might be coincidental.  Camp had been in place for about 100 levels.  Budget was full.  
---
  Except for the resource extractor, fusion generator, and the camp device itself, I scrapped everything in my camp, equipped contractor2, then rebuilt it - same design, same layout, etc.
---
 I was able to add more stuff than what I had before the rebuild - added wallpaper, laminate floors, several more mounted heads, additional lights, and a couple new atom shop items.
---
So many repeat rewards. The grind isnt worth it.
---
Looking good
---
It's my birthday too! Happy birthday! 😁
---
Sorry man, don’t mean to be hostile but I use to do the same thing as you. Took me a while to realize it’s the universes way of telling me to do something else.
---
is the system account wide or character wide?
---
I've come across far more generous players than not, and I am so thankful for these people. I'm still only L32 and a sneak so I can only do so much but I still tey and pay it forward with even lower lvls.
---
The most generous players I've seen were a few hours ago actually. I ran across a group of guys at whitespring station who have mics. First they were worried I was gonna steal their loot because they were gear swapping but I offered each 6 purified waters and some food for the L2 if they would come check out my vendors (I camp directly South of the station). They obliged.
---
Turns out the L2 was no noob and his partner was 100 something. The 100 ish told me to sell him one 308 round for 2k caps and ended up giving me 4k. I couldn't in good conscience only give 1 even though I knew he had it like that and gave him 100 rounds. The L2 then bought every item from my vendors and gave all the items right back to me. The 100 ish also dropped me a plethora of plans and even came back to give me more and some aid items.
---
In the off chance you guys stumble across this, thanks again for everything and for the kind words on my camp and prices :)
---
Make that four! Happy birthday!
---
Thats a person giving it away. They sell at npc vendors for 300.
---
Finally a home for all that .38 and .44 rounds..
---
they fuckin took ONE skin and stretched it too look like 7 separate rewards. all to make it seem like you were getting more than you are. they didnt do this for the NW skins, they didnt make each skin have a separate unlock for each model of PA to pad out the grind.
---
between the derivative ghillie suits and PA skins, we arent actually getting that much, mostly crappy filler.
---
(going to get my popcorn for when the PvP crowd descends)
---
Hum Lets see, I think there Will be a limit due max points... Like 150 per Day
---
I think they're a little confused on what's going on.
---
Not the best quality, but why a video when a picture will do?
---
https://imgur.com/a/TCng8tc
---
Yay, the more, the merrier, happy birthday!
---
&gt; we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.
---
ell oh fucking ell
---
Happy Birthday Zesty!
---
That would be great if you could - thanks! I'm still learning, but loving the game so far. 
---
I'm actually about to finish wastelanders tonight, so good to know.
---
I'm wondering if I can collect the gold bullion since I haven't actually unlocked the ability to earn it yet...
---
I would spend all the Atoms for "Place Anywhere"
---
No pistol skins? :( I would've been so here for an orange western revolver skin!
---
Something about a market? In fallout 76? Like a subreddit market for 76
---
I have never been a fan of the 'hiding of gear'.
---
 If you put something on to wear you should have to see that item.  It doesn't just magically disappear or use some kind of invisible paint.
---
 If you want to see your face or hair, don't wear headgear.
---
 If you don't want to see your backpack, don't wear one.
---
 But I'm also not one to play dress up on a video game, that never was my thing. 
---
Just my simple opinion.
---
It is related to fallout 76 though!! You’re just not reading the comments I guess. Mr house is literally mentioned IN the game. Even if it’s just one terminal entry, it’s related and relevant. Ever notice how many freakin robots are in the game? Well Mr House is/was very associated with RobCo.
---
Worse I'm afraid...
---
60 *  7 * 12 = 5040
---
Plus atleast 100 for weeklies so
---
100*12 =1200 +5040 =6240 minimum
---
And its 150 *9 =1350
---
Remember its 10 week session with 2 week break before next.
---
So 6240-1350 =4890 atoms lost is the best case
---
yeah, you can think of it as dailies just not rewarding atoms anymore, 1500 atoms is about what you would get from the weeklies over the same period of time.  Even if you did every daily over the same period, you could only get about 3 PA skins.
---
Didn’t think this interfered with PvP since it doesn’t disable people who *want* to PvP?
---
Great counter argument
---
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
---
Some have success jumping servers and trying again.  I guess it depends on where it stops up.  For me, Gail was sitting in the scanning machine and it was like everyone was listening to an unheard voice.  I have to keep going back-and-forth using the Intercom, but there was a point where I just kept skipping the unheard lines until the Raider NPCs began the next phase of the sequence.
---
While FO76 is taking place, Mr. House is in a coma that was brought on by a system failure in the lucky 38. He doesn’t wake up again until another 36 years.
---
I have my camp near wayward and got final word on lvl 45
---
I usually let Sim Settlements auto-build most of them, but I would spend a lot of time on the one I lived in.
---
woman after my own heart chugging a beer like that :)
---
Workshops were obviously designed for PvP. I already know I’ll be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, so here goes. 
---
You don’t even get that much from worships. Need acid? Go to Tanagra Town or anywhere else with cave crickets. Need junk, probably for the screws? There’s a few good places. Sugar Grove and the top floor of the office building both come to mind. Look, I don’t PvP that often, but when I do, I enjoy it. Workshops are one of the best ways to do it. And Bethesda making changes to how PvP works with them, given their track record with making things actually work before they go live, is just bound to break it completely, or mess something entirely different up. If you don’t want PvP just set your stash up by the extractors, put the fast travel mat by them too, and run through to collect and deposit it all before fast traveling away or running out of the workshop area.
---
As if the existing rate wasn't sad enough, right?
---
Workshops don't exist outside of Private severs for me.
---
한국어로 웃는다. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
---
Requesting changes to the only area in which PvP exists right now, won't be very popular...just an FYI.
---
Yes, like that.
---
No pistol skins at all.. Also still no skin for raider armour..
---
true, the extra two weeks should probably be considered.
---
Ye I eventually did it it worked after I set my audio settings back to default for some reason
---
How about a deathclaw nurse as companion
---
Yeah I tried looking through the PTS Discord and I just couldn't find the image he showed in the video
---
Change the "ko" in the address to en.
---
same
---
They actually did have more story and lore behind the strangler heart and the mire in Vault 94. There are some videos on YouTube that go over some of it. The story was actually pretty fascinating.
---
Yup, there has to be some tradeoff unfortunately. Everything has to have some form of drawback or else why use anything else?
---
I'll take this, but I still don't understand why we can't have ammo bulking for vending machines.
---
The lunch boxes, though... if they weren’t already breaking the no consumables in the atom shop already (which they are), this is the final nail in the coffin.
---
I like to mix 2x life saving pieces on my bloodied builds on certain events.   
---
Pair with reverent or watever it’s called for extra damage on revive.  
---
Using 2x life saving pieces in my experience has 99% chance to proc on ur first down.   Its still RNG but like I said in my experience I was always revived on my first down.
---
Right on man will do. If you ever have any questions don’t hesitate to pm me. Have a good one!
---
One Assaultron Dominatrix coming right up
---
I was more aiming that toward JuiceHead, but I realise they're a streamer who makes money from videos, so it makes sense.
---
100+ hours of gameplay to unlock everything is not fair, and not fun. Massive disappoint, not only is the atom rate extremely reduced, but 100+ hours to finish the season is fucking ridiculous
---
Mouth Harp, Frame Drum, Steel Barrel Drum, give us more music!!!
---
I've noticed a few things. 
---
Getting stuck in Danger:  
---
* if moving around and trying to retrigger escape artist isnt working at all, i have to fast travel to fix.  
---
* If Escape artist works for a moment but then flips back to danger. I have sometime founds ticks submerged in the ground that were aggro on me. Similarly some ghouls in walls. Moving far enough away fixes it. 
---
* Certain mobs like guard dogs and Robo-brains seem to have a big stealth detection bonus (makes sense), and i **think** sometimes they can detect you outside of general 'aggro' range. So it seems like its bugged but, if you wander close enough it will finally go aggressive and things go back to normal after its dead.
---
ya, on the plus side, dont have to login everyday to cook fungus for 10 atoms or hunt down gd radroaches.
---
I think it'll be closer to 2, probably, because otherwise the winter season won't include December (and I thought there were going to be "festive" scorched)
---
Yep. They’re trying to distract from that by offering some of the items most people want (clean sink and ammo converter) at low levels. Suits me, as few of the higher level items appeal (especially when I learnt the chicken coop just generates fertiliser) and being choked of atoms would only be a problem if atomic store content wasn’t so mediocre. 
---
Once people have been suitably drained of their free atoms, of course, with far more limited ways to earn more, I predict atomic store content will have a jump in quality. There’s a whiteboard somewhere in Bethesda with all the most requested skins, outfits, and camp items on it, ready to be introduced when they can generate most profit.
---
Then there might be delays lol,  this seems a lot worse xD
---
They used to be Energy damage, like plasma and laser weapons, even sporting a lightning bolt next to the damage. Now they have their own Fire element damage and got a buff with Wastelanders. It’s wasn’t mentioned in patch notes but was observed though data mining and notable changes players saw in Flamers after the patch
---
I’ll have to check it out I was unable to ever run the vault due to not even team mates / the damn time limit
---
Hmm, interesting point.  I wonder if they classified some of those lines as World Radio or something.
---
When they first added that option, it had some odd knock-on effects.  Like, you wouldn't hear any music in the missile silos if World Radios were muted.
---
It's a good option to have for streaming, because it prevents the licensed music from playing, but if they classified some lines incorrectly, it could lead to problems like this.
---
I freaked out at the chicken coop.
---
I'll be on later today, just let me know if you end up wanting it done:) I'll have to double check that I for sure have it, forgot to last night but I'm pretty sure I do. Gonna feel like a lying asshole if it turns out I was seeing things a while ago😆
---
guess we'll find out in a few days, some of those objectives appeared to be infinitely repeatable, and they should be - like 'kill a legendary, level up, gain xp' or whatever
---
there is stuff that was datamined and was marked as SCORE but isnt part of seasons. im pretty sure one of them was a Gauss pistol skin, sort of grey and copper color.
---
HA ha ha
---
Stockpiling armaments was a huge part of the Cold War, ya dingus.
---
What are your builds? Me and a few buddies might be up to fighting sometime.
---
So you think you are entitled to uncontested workshop resources because you got their first? This makes zero sense.
---
Yes, but daily... Seems like the regular challanges but get points instead of atoms
---
community in this game is absolutely the best, when I just started and was at level 2, this nice lady who was level 120+ gave me 20+ water a lot of useful schemes that surely helped me a lot, and second time after an event a nice lady gave me a really good sniper riffle, thank you all
---
Ye that’s what I’m assuming it must be as I have them off and it worked fine when I turned them on
---
Aye, but why does it say "ko" in the first place? xD
---
Wait so i can use my sryinger ammo from the unfinished rose quest to get infinite ammo sonce every time i log on it gives 20 ammo?
---
Nice! That would explain why I couldn't find any info on it. Thank you. Now if they would add in the burning legendary effect to more than the Perfect Storm SMG.
---
I will usually drop a mix of medications,ammo,food and water,armor and maybe weapons. If they are a real new player
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g18tc0/the_flamer_has_been_buffed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Here is a post about it with before/after pictures even showing the damage now has a flame icon next to it
---
I mean... it was *something*, at least.
---
I do find it humorous that the two examples they gave are two of the most annoying to achieve though: Eating Bubblegum and killing enemies in nuke zones.
---
70 day seasons with 2 week gaps in between.
---
I just use different weapons to eat through whatever abundant ammo I collected. Kinda fun sometime switching between junkies and bloodied builds.
---
Sneak is fucked up beyond belief. Funny thing is mine worked fine 90% of the time before the patch. Then they said they "fixed" sneak in the patch notes. That very day enemies started following my exact pathing and shooting me while under CAUTION. I can very rarely even get HIDDEN to stay. Always just CAUTION. I think it has something to do with lighting.
---
What platform are you on? On PS4 nobody really bothers with workshops. I used to claim a couple every day for a good few months and can count on one hand the amount of time people tried to claim them off me.
---
Being mention ed on a terminal does not make him a core character of the game.
---
But I think you keep missing the part where i say i find it weird to complain, because i do. It's literally just a nice post.
---
Griefing? No wonder you have no friends to play with
---
Workshops are free resource zones and there should be threat for it also you don't need to have/do everything in game just leave it alone
---
Just looked it up. Seems like an awful lot of work but yeah I can see people still taking advantage of it.
---
I have my current Camp where the Motherlode pops out in the Mire to take you (back) to the Deep.
---
Everyone who fast travels to my camp is in for a surprise.
---
(Let's collectively pretend the Mother lode is fine and dandy! ^. ^)
---
It's the closest thing we can do to have it as an ally as of now. XD
---
Morgantown airport has several as well.
---
If you had tato thats been damaged by a critter attack, you don’t need to find/pic one to repaor your existing plant.
---
In the build menu, scrap your existing plant.  You’ll get both tato and fertilizer.  
---
Replant, and our good to go.
---
Take an upvote, but I don’t see how this detracts from PvPing. It merely enables a portion of players to participate in taking workshops to passively acquire resources while they do other things. The aforementioned changes don’t give or take away from pre-existing PvP; they merely provide a safety net for people who *didnt want to pvp to begin with but still want to access a feature of the game*.
---
The conversions rates are not great but and it's a rough image but here are the rates pulled from the PTS: [Rates](https://imgur.com/a/TCng8tc)
---
Here's JuiceHead explaining how the conversion works: [Explenation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K96B4c659Hc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=343)
---
I am up for anything different. A buddy a I go on his private server and do queens. It seems like that's all we do. It's getting a little old. Give me something to work towards.
---
First, it's not free. You have to put in the time to get it.
---
Second, even free stuff is irrelevant if you don't want or need it. 
---
Literally the only thing worth my time in this entire season is the ammo converter. And that's only because it's so early on the track.
---
I put /s after that sentence which implies sarcasm...I also explained it in the brackets.
---
It's in the FAQ, yeah. 
---
&gt;In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards.
---
Modern Warfare does it. They rotate the available items and its different for each player. As in some of the categories will be the same but my wife and I have 2 completely different "for you" sections and had to wait for the things that we wanted to come up for sale.
---
I'm honored to share the same b-day as Mr. House. He's one of my all time favorite characters.
---
guess all that gilly suit grinding was really worth it now. huh bush wookies. only thing i wanted was the fireplace door and its lvl 99. f\*ck em and this season crap.
---
Nah it's sad that none of this is exciting.
---
Maybe see the npc wear the Confederate uniform and weapons
---
Have fun grinding over 100 hours lol I’m sure it’ll be worth it
---
I find it funny how one of the examples they use is "Chew Bubblegum."  Easily one of the most annoying of the Daily Challenges.
---
Disappointing to see them stretch out the atomic PA paint and the Ghillie armor paint.
---
I do 5 - 6 Encrytid Events per day, sometimes as many as 12. I suspect that I'll get to level 100 in less than 100 hours.
---
I don’t think I ever mentioned it as a first come first serve, or that it couldn’t be competed for. If x player claims it from another, the only benefit of these changes is that *You’ll see less level 15’s getting shit on for taking a workshop; they can get kicked out without getting their shit taken or harassed* for example.
---
If you bought them from a player vendor they will not count towards the challenge sadly.
---
Any chance it boosted the damage of the shishkebab?
---
If you're careful, you can take workshops without any PvP most of the time. Sure there's always the threat, but honestly, it's not a big deal to stash your junk. Just don't choose retaliate and the most you lose is 50 caps and your pride. You usually can retake the workshop later after the pvpers server hop because most of them aren't actually interested in the workshop just the PvP.
---
But please if you do you should track how long it takes you.
---
Just to help ease buyers fears at my camp I placed floor safe stash boxes between all of my machines so shoppers can buy and immediately dump if they feel the need. I'm a responsible shop keeper.
---
Possibly, and probably. They’re not really popular weapons so idk if anyone has noticed a significant change in them.
---
We can definitely want that. Other MMO-esque games give CONTENT and usually aren't so empty, barren and lacking of any character. We're talking about the same game that only has people playing it because they designed it around limitations to force people to waste extra time because they can't be bothered to actually make content.
---
After Wastelanders actually adding a game to the game it's natural the fans would want more things to work for that aren't entirely RNG. Seasons could've been that but they decided to fuck over people who don't wanna spend more money on a game where the developers try like once a year.
---
I get that this community's standards are low, but we should be able to get new content and gear that isn't RNG without having to lose something. This game is made by lazy people with debatable intentions, however we should be able to expect bare minimum levels of additions to the game.
---
Would you kindly upvote?
---
I will let you know, midnight is pretty late for me, but I could meet on Friday night.
---
Interesting. I'm happy to see they've put some of the more desirable items - the ammo converter and the clean sink - at fairly low ranks. Not too sure about those perk packs, but might be useful when the legendary perks system is implemented.
---
The rewards seem a bit... underwhelming. Meh.
---
can't wait for the 'take a photo of a super mutant behemoth and mutant hound together' to show up again......
---
in seriousness though, all that's going to happen is someone sets up a public team, people join, take a photo, then leave the team for the entire day that's a challenge
---
I just want a bigger budget.
---
Lmao! Omg if only. I would be afraid to mess something up, but hey, some bugs do work in our favor haha.
---
o yea i bet everyone voted on picture frames, icons, emotes, and perk card packs. i'm so excited to get on and do dailies over and over and over for a free pushing a broom pose!
---
With how early on the board you can get it I'm hoping you can still collect.  Would not be fair to newer players if you can't.
---
To add to Reedogger's info: some of the robots fire armor piercing rounds which will easily tear thru you if you aren't careful. Also, there is a guaranteed legendary at the end (possibly others during event if lucky) that will explode a few seconds after death. Either loot these quickly, or wait till after the explosion.  :)
---
FFS another exploit in the game now?
---
Neither stay in my vendor very long.
---
it does. it affects the amount of durability on the weapons and armor you craft. higher INT gives a larger bar
---
I’d love for you to track your time this would be very useful info to many
---
I have it to. No idea why, but it's funny cus I can actually read it 😅
---
Indeed they are! This happened to me once and a very kind lady added the atoms to my account really quick. I thought it was funny that this was the only time I ever got a customer review request since it's easy enough to get good reviews after they helped, lol.
---
I'm at 200 hours, and these were my first.
---
I would follow this guy into Poland
---
Well I’m junkies, 2 are bloodied and 1 is just LE FATMAN
---
I'm making a note - I am also very interested to see what the conversion rate of my activities are....I mean, I've gotten over 1000 Treasury Notes so far (not counting what I've turned in), so I do the grind.
---
Cool those lunchboxes everyone complained about over a year ago
---
Hmm. Looks like mininuke farming will be on the menu. Since there are a few static spawns, might be a profitable venture.
---
I want the Scorchbeast Encapsulated Heart to come back...
---
Have you tried "The Forest"?
---
Stockpiling isn't fighting you idiot. It's called The Cold War because neither side engaged in conflict.
---
Of the bugged perma-laser no-cooldown variety?
---
LOOK UP BIRTHS ON THIS DAY FOR THE PERFECT MR HOUSE we will help raise this child to know his Destiny
---
I mean you can rank it up before then by normally playing if im not wrong? You just cant buy yourself max rank
---
I was more interested in the 10mm skin datamined. Gauss pistols aren't really great.
---
People put stuff other than nuka shine in those?
---
You mean a clean sink doesn’t get your pulse racing? What kind of non-Victorian housewife are you?
---
I always advise new Wastelanders to check the storage boxes, lunch pails, etc around the train station vendors.
---
Having over 2000 hrs invested and at level 2 hundred something, I generally have all the plans, weaps, perks, junk, scrap etc that I need.
---
I will regularly dump all the excess plans, ammo, material, weaps, armor...basically anything I don't need into the storage boxes at train station vendors.  I know a lot of leveled up, veteran players do this.
---
And yes, the FO76 community is generally great.  I have also have had leveled up players help me out a bunch when I first emerged from Vault 76.  And I've never forgotten that.
---
Pay it forward veteran players!
---
imagine being so lame you report fallout trivia because it’s not specifically related to this iteration
---
Not rare, but definitely uncommon.
---
Happy birthday
---
I had a quad assaultron head for the energy cell but then i realised it takes too long to load charges during battle, worse that the minuteman rifle in fo4. So i found a regular tesla rifle to unload the 1.2k ammo i have, unless there's a heavy weapon that uses them which i don't know about
---
I agree I’m tired of spawning behind my house and in my friends floor
---
i horde gum because of this challenge.
---
They answered that in Q&amp;A didn’t they, or am I not understanding your question:
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
My punch bowl is stocked with 79 of those puppies.
---
&gt;'the only healthcare you really need is a pair of new boots'
---
And the Mojave must be one hell of a crazy place presently right? 
---
Can't quite remember what the nuke count was that he said were fired and how many he stopped but they've got that going for them at least. Nonetheless the area is no doubt in turmoil over territory and resources.
---
No, you need the plan for the plasma gun prime receiver not the gauss rifle. 
---
You would need the gauss rifle prime receiver if you had primed a gauss shotgun/minigun/pistol and need that ammo.
---
Holy.. how did I not know that. Ugh. THANK YOU! You’ve saved me so much frustration hah
---
Robco is in the game, so technically its related lol
---
I sang happy birthday out loud
---
Buy the ticket.. Take the ride...
---
There is that issue as well. I get super irritated when I spawn in someone's floor.
---
Yeah if you get put into godmode you can stack duped consumables to give you like 4000xp per kill.
---
I want that damn ammo converter.
---
Ha, let the trolling begin! I like the idea in theory, but people will absolutely find ways to ruin it
---
I like this idea, and I'm a player who enjoys it when someone contests my workshop (I don't contest other's, I just server hop)
---
I know there are a lot of people who don't like PvP that play this game, but there are also some who do and the PvP aspect really adds to the atmosphere of the wasteland.
---
There's no way they should remove PvP altogether as is sometimes suggested. The survival aspects like food and water do the same, I'm disappointed about that changing too.
---
I think ideas like this, finding a middle ground by allowing the non-pvp players to basically opt out of it completely, are the perfect way to go
---
Sounds like you don't need them but on a related note, a few tips for workshops for anyone who might come across this post:
---
Use Contractor and never build anything but the extractors and generators, a workbench and a stash/scrap box. By doing this you will stay within the material budget provided by the workshop. (Unless you plan to build every extractor and generators for each)
---
This way if someone takes it all you're losing is 25-35 caps from claiming it, 20 of which come from clearing the enemies.
---
Always enter sneak mode before traveling to workshops to collect your resources, and stay sneaking until you leave. Players are far less likely to come attack you if they don't know when you're there, and extremely unlikely to sit there waiting for you.
---
Scrap and store junk materials as soon as you gather them.
---
I have to Ether teleport again or wait for him to remove the floor
---
Listen to him talk, when he's naked he talks about losing his save files for nukatapper and 'whats a john anyway'
---
Blame console players. Bethesda has admitted that they haven't given text chat a priority because the majority of players are on console where they're already likely to be using voice chat and are less likely to ever use text.
---
Sounds good mate. Send me a friend request and let me know when you're on 😎
---
depends if there's utility to the item, like SS jetpack, backpack or PA helmet.
---
i don't like seeing my backpack but there's not a snowballs chance in hell i'm just going to drop 120 extra carry weight as a result
---
Several times yeah.  The only way I've been able to fix it is to leave the server which you'll lose out on your junk then...
---
Umm who is mr house
---
Or just take the mods out of the naming convention. You only need to see it's legendary prefix and what weapon it is. The fact that it's recoil compensated or deep pocketed isn't a factor when you buy a legendary.
---
Only thing I have for legendary is +40% power attack
---
Naturally!
---
its not new, its been around forever. 20+ patches and never fixed.
---
If they do SCORE using public events and killing things well I grind today for Bullion and do all those things.  I will be getting Free SCORE as I go and getting more BUllion and other things as I go.  I see upside in this potentially and little downside.  We will see but seems to me I will be working through this naturally, without making it the focus.
---
Go to nukacrypt they have the weekly codes there buddy
---
I'll definitely watch in the future, but with any game, this shit happens. Made me think of all the Rust videos I've watched.
---
It’s a very underrated event because you will get at least one 3 star item if not more.  Usually good drops as well.
---
By your logic, any mention of Taggerdy in this sub would ‘break the rules’ because she’s not an active character in the game. She is just a recording. And any mention of the Overseer prior to Wastelanders would be prohibited because she wasn’t in the game, just her recordings. 
---
Or Rosalynn, David’s girlfriend because she isn’t in the game either; just her recordings. Or David himself, because he’s not in the game, just as a ‘scorched’. 
---
RobCo is in this game. House is the founder of RobCo. Robert House relates directly to this game. 
---
You seem to think because he had a major role in New Vegas he has no connection to Appalachia. That’s quite incorrect. 
---
This isn’t someone talking about Benny or Yes Man or Joshua Graham, who have no connections to Fallout 76. 
---
This is Robert House, directly linked to RobCo as its founder.
---
We could talk about John-Caleb Bradberton and what his intentions would have been for the Kanawha Nuka-Cola plant and other possible connections, even though he doesn’t appear in the game. 
---
Finally, a **moderator** has stated this is directly related to Fallout 76. Your argument has no merit, because whether or not something is related to Fallout 76 is partially subjective... and your subjective opinion has no weight in contrast to a moderator’s opinion. 
---
Keep fighting that losing fight, though.
---
You kind of did. If the workshop owner needs to accept PVP they can keep the workshop without a threat. Slap damage is a joke lol.
---
The punji still can kill you even with light footed had guy do it to me just yesterday was like a wall of punjis hidden behind curtains you had to reach through to get to the vendor
---
Agreed. The "Raiders" with their trap bases will just have you spawn inside a sealed room full of flame thrower traps or radiation emitters.
---
They can only expand the budget indirectly, it exists to put a cap on server side loading and client side processing so the more they increase it the worse the game potentially performs. This is why they're working on interior cells for camps so you can have seperate budgets for decorating inside and outside.
---
I'd say marsupial I'd more valuable function wise, while speed demon I could see being worth a few more caps as it isn't crafted as often as marsupial for selling
---
That's exactly how I felt using my Instigating Lever action and Furious Lever action lol could pretty much one shot most enemies except scorch beasts and queen mirelurk. I made the switch to bloodied because I wanted the ultimate damage build and getting a B2525 fixer sealed the deal for me, I use the chinese stealth suit because you rarely die in it.
---
Account
---
You can only add 10 at a time.
---
1,500 atoms for roughly 83 days, yikes.
---
I landed a junkies explosive LMG with 15% faster reload speed.  From the purveyor.  I just about shit myself
---
They don’t have to accept pvp, someone can come in to yank the workshop from the pacifist player. The point was that other players can claim from the pacifist, but pacifist cannot claim from others, to balance it out.
---
Haha the right answer is both, but I got marsupial first as it is nice to jump, but man the speed is also sweet.  On my new character I did both as soon as I could
---
Don’t double down on stupid, it’s a bad look
---
I agree. It's a nuisance and needs fixing. While I can mostly work around the VATs issues I rather would like to not have them in first place.
---
Thanks for your comments. I wonder if Bethesda anticipated this (or was an unintended consequence) ... effectively wiping out 80+% of the non-PA armor vending sales.
---
Yeah that's true.  Honestly didn't think of that.  The 76 community for the most part is amazing yet, there's always those few.
---
It has been super nice to know if its heavy armor though, without having to look up the DR/ER tables
---
Hmm. The Ammo Converter will be great (even if the conversion rates at crap, it's better than just throwing it all out), and it's cool it (and the Clean Sink!) are available so early. However, there's very little else in those rewards that looks interesting to me, save maybe the black Combat Rifle skin at 59...
---
Not sure a bunch of junk I'll never use is worth the loss of daily and weekly Atom challenges. Especially since that was one thing I felt this game actually did really well - anything you wanted could be earned through grinding for only a moderate bit of time. But now...? :/
---
It is specifically related to this game. Just because he has a more prominent role in New Vegas doesn’t make him unrelated to this game. 
---
By these people’s logic, we can’t talk about Taggerdy, because she’s not actually in the game. She is just referenced in recordings.
---
So you are suggesting a workshop is automatically ceded unless someone wants to defend it? That’s your solution? Seems kinda silly IMO and workshops would basically end up only being claimed by people with pacifist off at the end of the day.
---
Used to be able to buy the Harness at Raider station vendors (Pleasant Valley Station at Top of the World is one such vendor). It is underarmour as mentioned.
---
Mothman glasses look great on it
---
That’s sick!
---
I have a bloodied explosive lmg I got from faschnact and it’s just sitting there because I don’t think I’ll ever go bloodied.  I’m too ocd about my life bar I just like seeing it green and unradiated haha.  But I also don’t want to put it in a vendor for caps so it’s just gonna collecting dust. 
---
Lmg’s are cool but damn the ammo is rough!
---
You haven't played New Vegas???
---
Well that makes it even worse.
---
The impostor's body disappears completely and can't be looted.  There is also a respawn bug  that will stop you from being able to loot it and also will prevent you from getting rewards for successful completion.
---
But by all means, just ignore that and keep complaining about people starting the event too soon and  people being AFK.
---
I agree with everyone that said both. But if I had to choose only one it would probably be Speed Demon for the additional movement speed and the faster reload. It is absolutely painful to walk around the map at normal speed. I can get a jetpack if I need to jump lol.
---
Ok
---
And the ammo points will have a small daily cap, and the amount of points you get daily will result in minimal amount of ammo. Mark my words.
---
I believe magazine spots are pure RNG.
---
Now I understand what strain display is for
---
Yeah I'm not looking forward to the lack of Atoms but I suppose I'd resigned myself to them being removed. This is for me is the sweetener. Not brilliant but long overdue
---
Agreed, I think they going to lose a lot of players like myself who jump on to earn atoms so we can buy stuff, if it is going to be a grind, I likely will change games. Won't be spending real money which is obviously what they aiming for, but I guess that's the strategy .. it's too bad, but then again, the game is near it's end of life .. We will see how bad it is, depends if I will bother anymore I guess.
---
shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Don't let facts get in the way of a good story!
---
Well, guys. My question is not about communism. My question is about fallout universe and style. This truck is completely out of "canonical" style with aerodynamic shapes.
---
BTW,   soviet union is not mentioned in fallout at all
---
The conversation rate is like 5:1 on ammo so it will be such a minor exploit
---
They said 1-2 hours per level. It’s not 100 levels of xp. And you have 10 weeks. It’s a lot for sure. I know I won’t get all th rewards
---
Oh cool, we did it. We got loot boxes.

I would like to see them get ballistic weapons right, I have a .308 sniper rifle that does more damage than a .50 cal sniper rifle. They're not legendaries, just regular. I mean seriously a .45 ACP will leave a 1/2 inch hole going in and a 12 inch hole going out.
---
Remember a season lasts 3 months. So that 100+ hours is over 90 ish days.
---
From the hell to the yeah !
---
Man I'm annoyed at yet another form of currency. Just can't keep it simple.
---
House was even mentioned explicitly in the new wastelanders content!
---
I'm at level 335 and have spent over 1k hours in game. All on 1 toon. Its not as quick as you'd think lol, or it just slows down a lot after level 100. It's been awhile since I was at that level
---
He’s a core character to the entire series he will always be relevant in every fallout game. Sorry, man. Read up on some lore he’s very much so a core character because of his impact on America and the fallout that followed the Great War. As long as RobCo is relevant(which they always will be, beep boop), so is mr house. And yes it is a nice post, that came across to me just fine. It just seems like you’re being stubborn and not acknowledging that Mr house is very much so relevant in 76 and you keep saying otherwise when there is loads of comments and other lore and facts that are saying you are wrong. Just sayin. Even IF it wasn’t completely relevant, you’re right in the fact that it’s weird to complain about such a thing on a FALLOUT subreddit like other franchise subreddits don’t mention previous titles? It’s all we have to compare this game to.
---
I dont recall, must of missed it
---
anyone else noticed that one of the rewards is 250 legendary scrip?  are they planning on raising the cap???
---
I’m level 508
---
Only after a year of patch for us console players
---
At the end of the wayfarer quest when you go to the robco vending machines terminals talk about how House had severely cut funding and redirected it to some secret work in Vegas.
---
they only do free weekend during active dupes /s
---
Why did The Cold War start? What was it about? How did it get it's name?
---
It's not new
---
I showed up at an encrypted and every time I activated a conduit, I was dead in seconds. I'm thinking if you have the grounded mutation that may help. But that imposter sheepsquatch just blasts you anyway.
---
I used to feel terrible, I got the punch bowl and the pristine nuka fridge and used to fill them up with booze, trying to be a good hostess, not realising I was sending peiole off on blackout adventure. 
---
That's probably why no one touches the sweets o put out in my Halloween candy bowl either now :(
---
No I haven’t
---
I'm still looking forward to seasons but it does seem we will lose out on 4500 or so atoms with the new system. Great if you use a lot of the new items in the season. Not great if you don't.
---
Still 4 ammo per time i log in is a sweet deal since i have like 490 srynget ammo
---
HaHa!
---
#Wait so i can use my sryinger ammo from the unfinished rose quest to get infinite ammo sonce every time i log on it gives 20 ammo?
---
Sure it might be silly, at the same time it also has the potential to avoid having a shit experience at little to no cost to other players. Alternatively, it could encourage people to use workshops. The point is that there’s no downside, it’s just opting out.
---
Ah, i vaguely remember
---
What's annoying is that there's a lot of padding and it's the first season, some of these ranks offer .. A perk pack, or 25 bullions, or 100 legendary scrip, that's not exactly the kind of reward that's worth looking forward to, like really, 25 bullions? Did you mean 250? Because who the hell is gonna be excited about 2.5 treasury notes after 1-2 hours?
---
Also the big boi rank 100 being a reskin of a power armor paint that's unlocked earlier in the same season is uuuh, well, it's not terrible per say, but not exactly that great either.
---
Useless is taking ammo you never use and leaving it in a pile on the floor or never even picking it up in the first place.
---
Nice house design though.
---
Dude give up, you arent making yourself look better
---
To be fair, it has to be balanced so people don't just make tons of the cheapest ammo and convert it and ammo should still have some value for trading. It should be for extra ammo, not a new mechanic to grind ammo from now on to the detriment of the other systems in the game.
---
Once I encountered on, he shot me, he was several levels below me, I hit him twice with my exploding shotgun (don't remember the actual name), his health was almost gone and boy did he run and then 'port out of there.
---
I'm still going to give it a try, since I'm a bit of a completionist, but the removal of Atoms from challenges is -extremely- disappointing - I always felt the old system was one of very few games to be balanced reasonably fairly. It's frustrating to be losing that just to get a bunch of junk I'll never use...
---
Just read that, and it is only rank 4 and dispenses water. Now I'm really intrigued about this season stuff.
---
So yeah I'm... ..an optimist most of the time but like why couldn't they just keep it to a space theme? haha. Too many ghillie items man.
---
I get this too! 
---
I'm looking for a nice new right arm piece, but because at vendors I cant see if that 3k 3*"ghoul slayers heavy right..."   right what? Right arm? Right leg? What ? I need to know !
---
I'm looking forward to that Gatling paint. It's my edc, soooooo
---
I reported this in the Wastelanders PTS...
---
Just makes me think they did the PTS just to keep up appearances not because they actually care about bugs.
---
I had a tendency to ignore the nuke zone one unless someone else launched a nuke.  And the bubblegum run made me do bubblegum runs so I'd have them on hand.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me.
---
The amount of times they reuse Ghillie but on another armor type is just frustrating... Really guys? And so far apart? Like, theme levels 40-50 all ghillie or something rather than having me able to add it to my left arm for like 40 levels before I finally get a skin that works on my right arm...
---
It's a reward via S.C.O.R.E.
---
If it's anything like the rustic it's just about the same as the water pump. Mostly decorative I'd imagine.
---
Cool.
---
Same please :)
---
Why spend real money on atoms is the real question.
---
For what it's worth, you can click to buy the item and on the confirmation screen it will list out the full name and you can just cancel if you dont want it.
---
Still wish they'd fix it though.
---
Ironically, my stealth build I am now realizing does not need any of the sneak boosting perks besides Escape Artist due to enemies rarely spotting me even with my sneak perks turned off (more like I forgot to swap out ammo Smith for the hundredth time)
---
Something odd about sneak for sure...
---
Who cares, this game sucks 😅
---
I've done a screen grab, amended the OP &amp; credited you for the link thx heaps :)
---
Called fallout 1st
---
I have the vending machine. I put all nuka colas except for one Nuka Shine, sorta like a Russian roulette type deal.
---
Amen.
---
Are you able to answer these questions?
---
Lol don't get me wrong the stuff looks nice, but I'm just over the grind for the sake of grinding.. Camp items are cool but we need more challenging content that isn't just another arduous experience.
---
I say let another player pay to also co own the workshop, only the first person to claim gets to place stuff, but anyone who pay to co own can fast travel to it and loot from extractors (and get their own instanced loot separately from other owners).
---
There, people who want to pvp can take it from other players who have pacifist disabled, and pacifists can just pay regularly to own the workshop but not take part in the pvp, the pvp will only take place between players who have pacifist off.
---
And if a pacifist owns the workshop first and a pvper's comes in, they can claim it as normal and wait for another pvper so they can go at it, while the pacifists still get resources.
---
Yes? I also don’t personally see the value there but glad others do.
---
You can earn Atoms straight away but you cannot buy your way up for two weeks. To make us grind a bit first I suppose
---
Workshops are fair play, by claiming a workshop you accept the possibility of pvp, there's even a big warning that pops up stating as much.
---
But camps should be a no go for serious pacifist mode gamers. I'm sick of having to keep an eye on my camp whilst I'm just trying to purge the map of ghouls, ready to log off if some bored people decide trashing some random gamers base is *fun*
---
Will the sink dispense useless purified water or useful boiled water?
---
I'd trade the ammo converter for a third arm that slaps any grenades, mini nukes, mines, missiles or other worthless dead weight directly onto the ground where it belongs any time the game tries to crap it into my inventory.
---
Fell for that one and had an interesting trip
---
I didn't see it on the recent rewards list. Does it have the SCORE prefix in the files?
---
sweet, thanks
---
&gt; They can only expand the budget indirectly, it exists to put a cap on server side loading and client side processing so the more they increase it the worse the game potentially performs. This is why they're working on interior cells for camps so you can have seperate budgets for decorating inside and outside.
---
I didn't say I didn't understand why, I just wish the budget was bigger.
---
And I can already see how this could be abused, too. 
---
Player 1 Is a bloodied build with the stealth suit and a legacy BE Gatling laser. Player 2 is your average joe who is just fine with PvP if it comes up, but has no legacy equipment. 
---
P1 takes a workshop fresh in pacifist. He goes about and does his business. Then P2 comes along, no pacifist, and takes it over from P1. P1 then turns pacifist off, goes back to workshop, and proceeds to decimate P2 over and over until workshop has been reclaimed again. Once then, P1 turns pacifist back on again. Rinse and repeat. 
---
The only way your suggestion would work is if you had to choose to have pacifist on or off before even joining a server, much like joining a team or playing solo for Nuclear Winter, that way they couldn’t just switch between the two like the example I just gave. And even then, if they had a friend in that server...well, that’d only be a few extra seconds for them to switch between pacifist and not. There will be problems forever with PvP in this game because for whatever reason PvP games are almost taboo for this community. It’d be better for Bethesda to work on things that are a bigger issue than something small like this.
---
Whilst I don’t really like the season idea I’m not complaining too much
---
I'm delighted that it's such a low unlock! I thought it'd be a rank 100 reward
---
No Slocum Joe vendor... guessing that's gonna be an Atom thing?
---
I’m honestly shocked (and happy) ammo converter is only a level 5 reward. This makes it super accessible to anyone playing this summer and will get enough out in the universe for players who start in the fall to use. I wonder if we will see a converter added to foundation and crater as well at some point.
---
The point of the post is not whether is worth it or not, it's about them giving us clothes that can't be seen. Thanks for down voting btw
---
It was confirmed free weeks ago lol
---
Cool concept but kind of radical. At that point there might as well be a PvP arena or a hunter/hunted type of thing tied to a specific area with rewards that are better than taking over workshops. Which sounds good, but is a little more complex of an implementation.
---
Lol I dont care about your backpedaling questions that you asked because you looked like an idiot on reddit
---
I wonder what the conversion rate will be for 2mm ec, might be cheaper to make ammo then convert it
---
I spent a day on private holding a few workshops to see if it was woth the effort. I came to the conclusion that they were designed entirely with pvp in mind and not resources. The amount you get is tiny, especially considering all the extra aggro of defend/retake events constantly popping up. As you rightly point out there are far more effective ways of gathering resources. I imagine if used as intended Grafton Steel would be a lot of fun but obviously when they designed the game they were expecting a lot more pvp focus.
---
Yeah just realised
---
How many Atoms will this cost?
---
Can't speak to plasma, but I've never been able to get loot from a Scorchbeast that my gatling laser has ashed in midair.
---
"Pole dancer in a gimp suit" . I'd not seen if before but now you've said it...
---
There’s a pretty good guide on YouTube with some magazine farming routes
---
Yea I have a legendary automatic gamma gun on me at all times incase I come across dumbies trying to grief, then I just melt their health in one burst
---
That’s honestly an awful excuse for the company.  I doubt any other triple-A game company would deny a nearly essential quality of life feature because they have most of their players on console.  It’s like Apex using that excuse because the game is on console too, but they would never.
---
Rifle Gaming on youtube airs fallout 76 stuff and he went to Helvetia, WV for the real Fasnacht celebration and took video from around the whole area. People were wearing masks they made that were in the game. I told my wife, I would like to go as well. Heck, Helvetia has a site where they accept donations, the town has only 59 people and needs some help.

---
I didn’t downvote. Your post brought up the concept of “real money”. I think it’s fair to ask about that.
---
buddy
---
Lol tbh I sell my Marsupial for 50 caps more than the others I still sell it easy
---
Because Juicehead would never stand for being accused of leaving some barrel not scraped.
---
Except all those times we fought by proxy eg The Korean War or the Iran-Iraq wars.
---
Don't feel bad, there's plenty of time to eat and shop before the blackout hits. I have a room that's basically a tribute to Gramps so I put the bowl next to his chair so it's safely away from the vendors though.
---
That could get really political. Not that its not awesome to be really political but I think maybe video games are where peoples go to get away from politics ?
---
The goo pile will be lootable, it's just the complete inability to find it afterwards that sucks. If you're using it on a flying enemy just make sure not to kill it, when it's health is low use a ballistic weapon to finish it off.
---
Lmao i love filling it with nukashine, I also sell it but I always make sure my punch bowl has it before i put it for sell
---
*Goodbye Horses intensifies*
---
I snipped this off the juicehead video:
---
Blokes keep teabagging at me it is unnerving
---
The vendor in Welch lewisburg  has it. It is I think 1400 caps. You can also run the jail event as you get a plan for free otherwise you are stuck trying to get it from level 3 safes or extreme luck from a level 2.
---
It's not a bridge, but there's a spot I have a character's camp at that might be something you could use. A bit southeast from foundation, there's a spot with an arch-like rock formation. The terrain isn't very level, but could work for a vault style build. If your on ps4, I could show you what I did with it.
---
Grafton Steel *is* fun for PvP, trust me. But I’ve made it a rule for myself to actually look around the map for the workshop owners and check their level. If they’re under 50, I’ll let them have it. I know it’s going to be a one way fight if they’re under that, and it won’t even be fun for me.
---
This is interesting. Very specific, but interesting. At the same time, you literally give a suggestion that could be easily implemented as, “If you claim this workshop in pacifist mode, you’ll be unable to deactivate pacifist mode until you log out” or something akin to that. And I mean on the note of bigger issues, there will *always* be bigger issues. It’s Bethesda.
---
Even if someone grinded the atom points doing dailies and weekly challenges just to have clothes that don't show up because the Secret Service armor covers them 99%, that's the point of the post, not real money.
---
You should be able to buy them from Grafton. I can't remember if it's Vendor Bot Greg or the train station, but one of them carries it.
---
I got the issue with her i finish come back an it takes three to four times to get her side of the conversation to come up so i can finish now its started with vacuum tube lady as well

Yes, so you would need to log in 5 times to earn 24x10mm.

Super stoked with a lot of the rewards, but I'm worried that they'll be able keep up content creation long term without repeats. My flagging interest after 7 characters  has been piqued.  Fingers crossed!
---
I want Ra-Ra and Bunnabun as companions. &gt;;(
---
I can't disagree I empty out useless ammo multiple times per gaming session
---
If I'm wrong I would appreciate it if someone could correct me. If you have nothing to bring to the table on this matter, why bother jumping in? "this guy appears to be wrong, lets attack them". Do you know if I am wrong? Do you know your history or not?
---
Well guys seems like the bombs will drop after all nice knowing y’all

The reason why Fallout 76 has such strange community because 70% of it are new players that havent invested much time learning the entire fallout lore and its universe. So the community conflicts with an original fallout community and shit like this happens often....its sad to see how fallout is turning out to be.
---
Aight cool cool, thank you, ill keep an eye out, i got a pretty solid heavy build, so i think i should be able to do it.
---
They might mean extra/already learned plans, not duped plans lol.
---

---
Does anyone else remember when the lunch boxes were datamined and all of YouTube declared they would be pay2win items we'd be forced to buy? Hell, there's still people running around thinking this is the case.
---
Except logging on is occasional because half the time it doesn't work and just crashes :\
---
your best conversion rate is 16:1 for 5mm into 10mm
---
Awesome, thank you so much!
---
It's okay, timeline wont let that happen again, I'm sure you and I are going to be long gone before you get the chance to kill him again ;)

I think I got the speed demon recipe first, although they only 17k so I pretty much got them all in a few weeks.
---
The only one I'd really see charging more for is Scaley Skin since coal is a PITA compared to the others.
---
The Cold War wasn’t an actual war. It refers to a time in which there were small unrelated conflicts by minor powers that were influenced by major powers.  The major powers never directly engaged each other; they did so through proxies. 
---
Therefore, there are actually multiple ‘dates’ of when the related conflicts began or ended. 
---
There were weapons used during the Cold War, in the individual related conflicts that occurred as part of the larger dynamic and over the longer time frame. 
---
Your position and wording were intentionally disingenuous and designed to create false controversy. They were not intended to create a viable discussion.
---
**TL;DR:** The fact that the major powers did not directly engage each other does not mean that their weapons and military supplies were not used by their minor proxies in conflicts. Therefore the weapons were used during the Cold War, and your original statement is inaccurate and misleading.
---
Could you tell me where you tend to get bubblegum? I’d like to go out scavenging for the next time
---
I'll take that as a no.

Just delete your downvoted posts and move on, thanks

Yea, I saw his video, it was great to see those sites IRL. I did not know they need help. Thanks for the info.

Oop my bad I don't keep up with this stuff that much

They aren’t Because they were massively duped

My credit card at da ready

You can get as much vault steel as you want. Just have to hop servers. I’m 1 piece away from the set. Can’t wait to try it out with the new team system.
---
I especially like the 5 .38 = 1 fuel.
---
Oh. Didn't know. But ik you can find them
---
Being mentioned on a terminal does not make him relevant OR a core character to 76. That pretty much makes him an easter egg for those who remember him, because he literally has no impact on 76, and he's not a character you see mentioned over and over.
---
I would agree with you, had the post mentioned it like "mr house from former games is in 76", but it did not. It simply stated it's his birthday, which is not relevant to 76.
---
That's why i say it's fair to complain, because mentioning his birthday would be relevant on the fallout subreddit, but not a subreddit exclusively for 76. It's stupid to complain, because it's not like 1000000 people are spamming it, but it's still fair tho.
---
I believe for the fixer specifically, you have to know the plan for it first before you can receive it from the legendary purveyor. I think the plan has a low chance to drop from Encryptid? Not sure.
---
Do you want gold or something?
---
"I was about to feel bad then a read xbox" yeah you certainly do.
---
I got a decent heavy guns build and vampiric primed gat laser, that combo keeps me alive as long as i pull the trigger, so im not worried, but thanks for the tip :)
---
Wait until legendary perks come out that let you delete perk cards.
---
Get 1st for a month and cancel.
---
Fill scrap box with unbelievable amount of stuff.
---
Wait for 1st to go away.
---
Take everything out of scrap box.
---
Delete your Packrat perk with 25k pound worth of scrap on you.
---
Decide that it's better to throw away the character than throw away any of that sweet, sweet scrap that stops you from even moving.
---
Cheers, this is all that was needed. Thank you!
---
When you clean it.
---
I am hooked on the beautiful scenery. Another game worthy of playing just for the scenery is Far Cry 5. It made me consider a move to Montana.
---
In white springs club house baskets.golf,guns clubs,and coat hangers galore all steel approximately 150 per run ,more with scrapper perk
---
Of course it’s specific. You have to look at what a suggestion is, and find the loopholes in it. Just because I know *how* to be an asshole doesn’t mean that I *am* one. At least, not all the time. I’ll fully admit to bringing out a TSE flamer against a whiny Brit during Fasnacht because he was complaining about somebody playing music, and instead of just muting the person he started playing music himself and started shooting at people after the event was over. Was it fair for him? No. Was I an asshole for doing that? Yeah. But it shut him and his god awful mic music up, so it made other people happy, even if it just meant he was paying attention to me and not the level 10 that just started playing. 
---
Look, your idea isn’t *horrible*. But of all the things that the devs could be doing, I’d say that this is somewhere on the list of the last 10 things for them to even think of thinking about.
---
If they do it right I would think it would just sit in your collections tab until you can spend it. But Bethesda has screwed up simpler things.
---
Lol np
---
Big  b o o m
---
So they aren't automatically an enemy and able to be killed even if they are red?
---
Trust me, it’s more than a few.
---
Also what character does the bullion go to?  Does each season pass run per character? Or does the one you’re using at the moment get all the currency rewards?
---
Beats dropping them on the ground like I do every day.
---
Yeah, about 125/week. But there’s less of a time lock involved now. 
---
It’s about one-fourth what we can get now, approximately. Lots other benefits swapped in, and I’m curious how the bullion will work for characters or accounts that have not yet completed the vault raid.
---
So they want people to grind consistently for a minimum of 100 hours straight and an estimate of 149.5 hours? FUCK. THAT. I've got better shit to do then play your broken damn game for 6 days, 5 hours, and 30 minutes straight, that's pretty much gotta be my gametime at this point so like hell I'm going to double my gametime in 77 days! (from June 30th to mid September (15th)) That's a grind of 2 hours every single day without any breaks for two and a half months!
---
Again, FUCK. THAT.
---
RIP free Atoms.
---
Also, those rewards suck balls (as expected) !! I don't care for the 90% of the items in there (as expected).
---
Where is that AR-10 Screaming Eagle skin &amp; variants?
---
I see clean sink, but not toilet unless I am missing something.
---
Why would I delete it and walk away with my tail between my legs? I'm not ashamed. I received constructive information from a polite person, rather than an abusive attacker like yourself, with nothing to add. I hold my head high, and look down upon you.
---
I have bloodied stealth commando, 15 Agility, full Unyielding, 3 points in sneak, muffled etc and I'm constantly in danger just lately. Super annoying
---
I use a gattling plasma simply for scorchbeasts (just a shotgun build with something a bit more fun for scorchbeasts). I'd say if you hit it and it dies midair, *watch like a hawk* for where the  body lands otherwise you'll be running around all the  bushes looking for a pile of goo!
---
I feel like im missing a step on how to do this
---
Is it just a trial and error thing, or is there a consistent way to do it.
---
Ive tried scrapping, and storing the shelf, and half the time the flag wont even place on the shelf
---
I mean to be fair, I can see how they thought Bethesda would go down that route. They almost certainly considered it I bet.
---
I may have made a slight mistake... :)
---
no, the seasons last 70 days with 2 weeks of gap between
---
Thank you for acknowledging that your original wording was disingenuous. I respect when someone can take a step back and recognize their error.
---
You were corrected originally and called that person an idiot. You were never interested in a rational conversation
---
Thank you for addressing this
---
i cant wait to start con erting all those missles, 40mm, and mininukes into ammo il use
---
Holly $#!7 you’re right!
---
I’d take your lunch money!
---
How do you place the beams in front of the defensive fence?
---
I wish they’d remove camp building. It’s dumb.
---
There should be a minor questline where Mr. House sends hired goons to look for the platinum chip in West Virginia because he heard of the treasure of Appalachia. It would be neat and a cool reference to New Vegas.
---
Definitely! It's not the only thing I'm acknowledging too. Again, thank you and respect to you also!
---
You can get 100 levels in a day if you want. Impossible but there's no limit.
---
seeing as the lunch boxes have been in the files forever, its pretty clear they intended to put it in the atom shop but backed off, but still wanted to get something out of the man hours they invested in developing them so they integrated them as filler for seasons.
---
I’m only interested in the Ghillie Skins. The rest is VERY underwhelming at the cost of the ~1,600 atoms a month that we currently get if you do all dailies and weeklies
---
You know in order to progress this system you will do the same daily challenges anyway right?
---
I higly doubt it... 5 dailys, 50 points per Day, thats my guess..
---
This game sure enjoys to keep you playing everyday... Fear of missing out
---
Dude this trumped anything on the list for me as well. Only issue is i hope the redemption points scale well because selling 5.56 was my only way of making decent caps in vending since most legendary gear is too valuable to sell for caps or outright garbage and need to go for super cheap which I'd rather have scrip at that point.
---
Love this addition though.
---
&gt; Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two.
---
you will have to be able to unlock more than one per day because there are 100 levels and only 70 days to complete them.
---
Is there a lead deposit and a hidden acid deposit in a cave below?
---
If so friend, we camp at the same spot.
---
From the wikia:
---
“...fifty-nine were forcefully disarmed mid-flight, nine were blasted out of the sky by a laser defense system atop the Lucky 38 Hotel &amp; Casino, and only nine hit the surrounding desert.[1]
---
In the years since, the Mojave has largely been ignored by the developing post-apocalyptic civilizations, such as the New California Republic in the west and Caesar's Legion to the east, thus allowing enemies of such civilizations (raiders, slavers, the Brotherhood of Steel and super mutants for example)[2] to prosper there. For years, Vegas sat at its heart, decayed by almost two centuries of neglect.”
---
So yeah the Mojave Wasteland was a cesspool of the worst kinds of people until the NCR reached Hoover Dam and Mr. House reclaimed control of the strip.
---
Where did you hear about this? 
---
I'm asking because Bethesda disappointed me many times before.
---
Not only do I remember but I’ll bet you 10 caps that they’ll STILL act like we have to “watch out” for lunchboxes becoming P2W in the future.
---
I’m always for some good ol Bethesda bashing, but the absurd lengths people go to bash Bethesda with their imagination astounds me.  There’s plenty of actual things to bash Bethesda on, no need to make shit up.
---
Goo piles are invisible from underneath. That's the issue. It's still there and can be looted... if you can spot it and fly up.
---
And it's not just the gatling plasma. Any plasma weapon will do it. I assume laser weapons and ash piles have the same issue.
---
Just make sure you don't get the kill shot.
---
That’s separate from whether or not he should delete his posts to ‘avoid downvotes’. I may have disagreed with him and used facts and logic to prove him wrong (which he acknowledged), but I also respect him for not running away and taking the feedback. 
---
It takes some integrity to not only admit you were wrong (which he did) but to also not try to hide the conversation or dodge the feedback. 
---
And this is coming from the person that provided the information that caused him to admit he was wrong. 
---
If I don’t think he should delete his posts to avoid downvotes, why are you encouraging him to act in that sort of shady manner?
---
If anything, the suggestion should be to edit his posts to acknowledge he was in error. 
---
That’s called integrity. Running and hiding to avoid losing ‘fake internet points’ shows a lack of integrity.
---
just dont try and get 500+ for them and you'll be fine.
---
Yeah it's a pain
---
Hey Cyborg!!! Dude. Listen to her. It's so easy in that group
---
They did this right with the fire chief outfit.  Back-fixing this for all other underarmor would be great PR points, to a company that needs them.
---
Thanks for the source.
---
From what we know and the datamines,you could get more than one level x day,because there are repeatable challenges like "get xp" and "do events".
---
But main lvl up xp(not the normal xp) should come from daily and weekly challenges and those are not repeatables.
---
Were SS Underarmors released?
---
you should check the FAQ at the bottom, "question" 2 iirc
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events.
---
You'll earn more items with seasons than you would earning atoms. The difference is with atoms you can  choose what you want, wheras with this you get what they have made available.
---
Depending then on what you think of the rank rewards then influences if this is good (hooray lots of free stuff) vs a big nerf (12 weeks to get 1 bundle and a bunch of stuff you wont use).
---
You can get ~650 atoms a week through the current daily/weekly but that will require playing every day. Since you appear to be able to earn SCORE from doing events, it benefits people who play several large sessions a week rather than playing every day
---
Would be cool
---
Negative,  but that sounds awesome!
---
As in it isn't people in this sub (fallout 76 people) pushing anything.
---
Yep, I got it at Welch.
---
We get what, 50ish a day + 150 a week now?  So ~500 a week if you clear everything now.
---
Hmm.  Suppose we'll have to see.  Atop Shop currently trickles out just enough stuff for me to clear my atoms out but it's pretty rare I'm short currently.
---
Same to you.
---
I saw that guy trying to convince you to delete the  posts. I respect there fact that you’re not deleting your posts. My only suggestion would be to add in an edit to reflect your reconsidered position.
---
You made a mistake. Learning from it is honorable. Trying to cover it up would not be honorable.
---
It's the marine armour wetsuit helmet that does it for me.
---
That is my point. 
---
Bethesda always want us to play every day.
---
People have said earlier in this thread, someone can phase through u and use computer while you are on it.
---
Yeah like every daily gives 100 SCORE, each públic event gives 1 SCORE... Besides públic events are rare nowadays
---
My first thoughts are:
---
- now I don't have to log in every day, I did because of the challenges.
---
- HUGE nerf in atoms.
---
- Since I have almost all the worldly, character etc. challenges covered, it means I will not get any more if I don't buy them and I will not buy them because (next)
---
- Since I will not log in every day, plenty of options to go playing other games and forgetting about 76.
---
- My friends in game will do the same and there are a lot of chances than when we log in we'll not be together, friends are an enormous part of this game...
---
- the rewards are... meh. All those lunchboxes, fireworks, kits, vault boxes are underwhelming and will pretty much be scrapped when earned (same reasons as above for the groupal ones)
---
- I already have the ghillie suit, why would I want armor skins for it besides using them for bush camping in NW (I mean this will affect Nuclear winter   too)
---
- caps and bullions rewards are absurd when you are  a veteran player since you can earn them with a day of selling items to the bots and the guy at the wayward, furthermore they will not get you anything new if you have everything in Ws already unlocked. 
---
- if prices in the AS are not nerfed as well, and we all know they will not, I won't be using the shop and I will not be waiting all week for the new items, no matter what, because I will not buy atoms for a game I'm not playing as hard as I have been...
---
- I think this will be the end of the game for veterans like me, when we reach the item we want, we may left it until another season and it will be more difficult for them to attract us back if other games got us.
---
So, yeah, pretty worried and sad about all of this.
---
just looked at those rewards...those are way too cool looking. How are they not going to be wanting to charge people money for this? I feel like they're just giving us a first free hit just to get us hooked.
---
Like, you don't have to do it, some of us already play this game far longer than that, and are going to be rewarded for it. I don't think there is a problem here.
---
pretty much nothing really new either.. you just do the same crap you're doing now.. you just get stuff extra for doing it.
---
Headgear outside of gasmasks( you rarely need) give no benefit, not wearing them is the same as hiding them.
---
Man all I want is a sink that doesn't irradiate me and lets me spam collect as fast as going to a dirty pond.
---
Of course, I employed that broad stroke for brevity mostly, and to point in that general direction - the chaos of all the choices interacting in a balance of AI and narrative branches/chains - to me that was really cool. I ended up modding FO4 so that the grind was shooting and the fun part was building and assigning custom characters to very specific activities
---
Devils backbone has a raised highway .. pretty big area under it
---
Oh, my bad. Even so 100 hours over 70 days isn't unfeasible for a player base like fo76's.
---
Scrap kits? Really?
---
thats a fuckin reach dude. 
---
its a kids jungle gym thing ffs not some elaborate easter egg or teaser or some other convoluted way to tease an alien DLC.
---
the description is just a joke, so no anal probing Zetan DLC yet.
---
&gt;Then it’s a theoretically a horrible investment.
---
It is one of the few actual investments in the game.  Even if it's a bad one, due to lack of other options, and the cap limit, it's actually a fairly decent investment.
---
I bought 15 recipes in a few weeks.  That's \~240,000 caps.  More than the 30k caps I could otherwise hold.  Now I have 30k caps AND 15 recipes... that I make maybe 4k/day from and still have nothing to spend them on.
---
When you get to a certain point the 30k cap limit devalues caps to not be worth anything to you.  Having an artificial limit like that is pretty bad.
---
This is hilarious. Remember the justification for atoms about how they could be readily earned in game? How does it feel now that the rate they can be acquired has been squeezed down by a huge margin?
---
I welcome all bootlickers to come tell me how valuable all the poses, photo frames, skins for armour and weapons I don't use are though, when I never would have used my challenge-earned atoms on them.
---
What a dumpster fire.
---
They canceled the legendary perks for now yo
---
Nope
---
 What about the buried train car? Too small?
---
for all this game's faults, bugs, etc, i mostly enjoyed my time playing (500ish hours since beta). wastelanders was a pretty welcome addition, but the honeymoon period is already over. giving us a grind calendar with lackluster rewards while taking away our choice to use earned atoms in the shop, i'm afraid will kill off a chunk of the fanbase. it's certainly a huge turnoff for me.
---
i'm in my mid 30s with a 13mo old, haven't really been able to play much over the the last year, and when i did, i chose 76. the last 3-4 months i've actually been able to pay with some regularity, and even got FO1. but when that ran out in may, i put 76 away, and went to other stuff. i was planning on coming back with update 20, but nothing about it is really exciting. i'll probably play a little to get the ammo converter, and that'll be it. i just started red dead 2 with my game pass trial, and that's such a departure from FO...i'm loving it.
---
 "Using stealth with comando will cut ammo consumption in half or better. It’s pretty much mandatory. Bloodied/stealth/comando was my favorite character for a long time. "
---
i really hope stealth isnt mandatory as i find it tedious / boring (though i know sneak is good id personally rather go loud)
---
So if I needed the prime ultracite cartridge ammo I need that
---
Aye that's all fair, cheers for the insight! To be fair, I've now lost my personal loading screens and just getting generic ones now, classic Bethesda
---
No it’s just unfeasible for your average human
---
100+ hours over ten weeks
---
7 weeks*
---
Sure id love to see! Gothicbarbie25 is my PSN whenever you get a chance.

---
I mean yeah not EVERY reward is 'OH MY GOD I WANT THAT' AMAZE-BALLS but to look at all that and go, "Meh." frankly I think is a bit dishonest.
---
Weasel granted as ally.
---
Next really common request: "Make Weasel shut up. She says the same lines over and over and her voice bothers me."
---
Sounds good. I'm walking my pup right now, but I'll be finished in around an hour.
---
I don't have a lot of issues with griefers luckily. I've come across one trap base and I beat his trap and got my stuff back. Been playing for over a year or so.
---
Awesome! Thank you 🖤
---
I never used that one actually, I just got really proficient in the piller and rug glitches, lol
---
The introduction of the Brotherhood of Steel on the next major update will most likely include the introduction of more Gold Bullion plans. I'd bet the Enclave will be coming next.
---
You mean less extra stuff, since you won't ever have enough atoms to buy anything from the shop.
---
I got all my recipes early on. I have all 5 of my alts and all 5 of my gf account alts with max caps. After that point you just buy weapons, ammo, flux.
---
I have 300k of 556 and 180k 45 , I have 1300 of each flux, I mean at a point it is just playing on auto pilot. 
---
It is a good cap sink I’ll admit, but it seems obvious that OP was reaching the amount of caps for the first time that they needed to get rid of them. In that case like I said I feel that it is isn’t a best investment for them.
---
Doubtful by just basing on atomic shop items.
---
yeah, not even enough for 1 PA skin barring discount. ppl have done the math and you're losing on atleast 4k atoms now.
---
It does look nice yes, but looks like you gotta put in 150-200 hours of grind to get em all for free, or pay with Atoms (this is what they are expecting people to do in later ranks as it slows down).
---
It is still business for them and people with jobs will spend money to advance (no time to play as much), thats a fact and how these kinds of systems make money to the game...
---
Because I’m an AI program created by the University of Wisconsin with the purpose of infiltrating and exploring gamer subculture.  I can not love.
---
I totally agree and I have edited my post, before i actually read this. I'm always happy to learn, or even just have a civil conversation. I am definitely guilty of twisting my wording to be disigenous, or even volatile at times. This is something I don't always notice at first and I'm more than willing to work on. Sometimes getting a reasonable reply, polite correction or even a friendly kick up the arse is all that's needed you know! Thanks again
---
Yes I was really expecting it to be the capper at level 100.  Very pleasantly surprised
---
Ammo converter is all I care about in it. I don't really care about atoms either , I'm sure I'll unlock it easy enough and I can ignore the rest. I agree it sucks for those that do like to do challenges for atoms.
---
I think you're missing the point of the seasons though.
---
* Are they modifying this so that we, overall, get less atoms? **YES**
---
* Are they creating another ATOM sink and therefore likely to try and drive revenue up? **YES**
---
* Are they doing those who either can't afford to keep buying ATOMS or just don't have time to grind daily/weekly challenges any favors? **I Think So**
---
You see, most of the rewards are for cosmetics. Arguably, if you like them, then you don't need to spend atoms on them. The ghille skins for example, LOVE them. I'll be gunning for those and praying my 1hr/day playtime can get me to rank 82 for the secret service one. Those are two skins I won't need to spend any atoms on. I might even spend the atoms to get the ranks because of time issues but hey we'll see, i value atoms by like 20x their monetary value.
---
Alternatively, we now have the ability to gain other currency that otherwise was behind strict time gates:
---
* Bullion 300/wk + 200/day
---
* Scrip 150/day (per character) + another 40ish from daily quests/ally quest?
---
I like the functional more than the cosmetic. For me, seasons, in general, is an improvement.
---
My biggest relief is not the rewards, but it helps eliviate my "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO).
---
I don't have to be forced, to log in, every day to claim some long running reward. I can play, when I want, in a 10 week flexible window. Sure, they still mentioned the daily/weekly rewards which I will probably feel a bit of pressure to do, but if things go like they say, and I can get 1-2 ranks in an hour. I'll be happy. Even if I need to take a few days vacation, i won't feel like I missed out and therefore be driven away from the game.
---
You’re welcome!  Glad it was helpful. ;)
---
I wonder if/how the ghillie skin will apply to the Solar Scout armor... I just want to become Swamp Thing.
---
Yeah the movement speed seems like Halo 3-level considering how huge the map is lol
---
Ding ding ding we have a winner!
---
It's just going to be more plans.  Forever and ever and ever and ever..
---
&gt;The Intellect stat is only needed for crafting higher durability items and a very few skill checks in dialogue
---
Each point of INT is also around 3.2% XP bonus, so you're losing about 13% bonus XP.
---
I'd recommend also getting Egghead and keeping Starched Genes and Class Freak permanently equipped.
---
I agree.  I mostly spend atoms on camp items and seeing what they have offered in the seasons has me excited.
---
All the important game changing stuff is pretty early on anyway, so what's the problem? The rest of it is just extra progression for the people who want it.
---
You can also blueprint the object and use that to place the object, it's much more forgiving than placing by hand.
---
I believe it's 1 hour.
---
Yeap i will probably quit after this update, since there will be zero will to keep login in every day, since atom daily challenges were keeping me active. Now that those rewards are gone and instead we use a grindy board with useless items, **I AM DONE!**
---
I think new river gorge might JUST have enough space, pretty hard to judge
---
Mechanics are everything. If one guy sees you, the **ALL** see you. Ghouls have very good perception, so do automated turrets. Best thing you can do is get high agility, shadowed leather armor, and silenced weapons. There is the sneak perk as well.
---
Otherwise, if you have access to the stealth suit, that's your savior.
---
Theres some Chinese stuff that’s been in the atomic shop. DLC in China confirmed.
---
Welcome to Appalachia! My IGN is gomunk. I usually play during daytime hours in the EST time zone.
---
Angry Turtle just ran tests, you can check youtube.
---
ROLFMAO
---
&gt; I mean yeah not EVERY reward is 'OH MY GOD I WANT THAT' AMAZE-BALLS but to look at all that and go, "Meh." frankly I think is a bit dishonest.
---
I think what they're offering needs to be compared against what it has replaced. After the atoms earned through the character challenges, weekly and daily challenges were the only way to regularly earn atoms without paying bethesda money. 
---
They have now drastically cut that flow of atoms in exchange for things that can readily be earned in game by playing (the in game currencies) and cosmetics that are of subjective value. 
---
On top of that, the entire mechanism for earning these new rewards is gated behind a ladder for which bethesda both controls the rate at which we can advance and for which they've already provided us a pay-to-win mechanism for advancement.
---
I don't know how anyone can look at this objectively and say it's an improvement.
---
Yeah ofcourse, the whole change of daily challenges rewards is so players don't earn as much atoms for free and they have to pay to buy atoms in order to afford atom shop items.
---
Idk might be cutting it close lol
---
Ty
---
A lot of junk ammo is going to disappear from player vending machines this week. Finally all that 38 ammo has a use. 
---
I like this kind of event. Red dead online does this on super rare occasion and it actually provides something to do in that dead ass game. Hopefully fallout 76 does it way more often than rdo. 
---
Like the additions to the camp. Meh on the armor and pa skins. I dont consider the same skin over and over to be all that great, and who uses t45 anyways? sincerely hope since they seem to be putting in more camp stuff, that they will overhaul the terrible build mechanics and increase the build budget.
---
&gt; or pay with Atoms 
---
oh that's right, that's the catch then. The grind will be insane.
---
That would be great. But again, if you didn't want any of those plans, what's the point of getting that bullion? Now I'm sure I'll want nearly all of them anyhow but I'm getting to a point now where I bought some mods just "because" Why do I want to buy the penta barrel for my minigun when the tri barrel is so much better?
---
Whatever dude. You can think that. Just know that you’re wrong in thinking that.
---
You're welcome.
---
The position is assumed.
---
Earning XP and completing public events also counts, so it is much more grindable and less time locked than the current dailies.
---
The last sentence you added with the edit describes my sentiments exactly. I loved earning atoms and waiting for the next atom shop reset knowing I can probably afford a thing or two. Now I will be forced to buy atoms much, MUCH more frequently, as I am the kind of person that when I see something nice I simply can't skip it. Also, the free atoms from the 15 euro subscription atoms along with the 1.5k per 3 months (big LOL right there) simply won't cut it.
---
I called it some time ago and got downvoted into oblivion, but it was a matter of time until Bethesda showed their true colors. And mark my words, eventually we will see loot crates like ESO in 76 soon.  
---
I am going to have to pay a lot more money for what I want, and that would be Okay-ish if the game was polished, but let's be honest, 76 is amazing with a lot of potential but it's SO crippled by all the bugs etc.
---
Desmond was my favorite.. set him up with hazmat suit (or chinese stealth later) and a good rifle.
---
Or just a heavy Gunner/powerarmor Hurley $$..
---
Lol, a mod stating it's relevant to 76 means nothing tho, they are simply mods. Sure, they make the rules for the subreddit, but that has nothing to do with the big picture.
---
Also, you're wrong. The overseer was indeed relevant, because she played a major part through the whole game, not just mentioned on a terminal as an easter egg. Fact is, 76 could easily have left out that part, and no one would care, because he adds nothing to the core, he's simply a character from a former fallout game mentioned by name. But like i said, complaining about the post is stupid, but fair.
---
As mentioned: this is 76 subreddit, not fallout subreddit, which also exists.
---
You're correct, it's just the buying ranks that's shut off, S.C.O.R.E. begins on Tuesday
---
Where does it say seven?  It starts 6/30 and runs until mid September according to the Inside the Vault that was published today.  It isn’t mathematically possible to be less than eight-nine weeks given that.  They state most seasons will be ten weeks
---
Not everyone has that many bobbleheads and i'm pretty sure something as simple as getting xp,won't impact SCORE that much. You need to earn them through challenges.
---
Him being mentioned one time doesn’t matter. Mr House is present in the wasteland, he’s omnipresent through his inventions that we kill over and over in the wasteland. He is there, and he is very relevant and probably always will be. Sorry, but I’m not continuing this conversation. I digress. We can talk about something else if you’d like.
---
I like the ammo converter. Too bad I gave away like 4000 rounds of .38 and .44 thru my vendors yesterday lol
---
I honestly think we'll see them at train stations or the settlements and this is just our opportunity to have them in our camp.
---
The other thing that having all those 'free' atoms does is it makes the price of the items in the atom shop much higher. That's not to say that they will lower the prices now that they are giving aways seasons, but maybe we'll see less price creep.
---
Except you can sell vastly more easily and quickly obtained items to the vendor for your 1400 daily caps, so selling serums is usually pretty damn dumb.
---
Agreed! I love the Freestates faction! There could be a hidden bunker that closed its doors again when the scorched attacked!!
---
One more thing, if mr house didn’t exist there would be no robots in 76. Is that not enough impact for you?
---
You can get 7000 atoms in those 3 months from daily and weekly challenges. After the change you will only get 1500. You don't know what you are talking about.
---
Agreed!!
---
IIRC the tracker in the PIPboy shows bullion before the quest is completed, its just that the treasury notes don't drop until you've completed.
---
Though the bullion and scrip are likely ones you have to manually cash in since the season is account not character based.
---
I just went through this also.  It did not show up at a vendor to me until I got level 25 exactly.  I went back to them for days before level 25, with nothing new, then level 25 and there it was.  It's like 1800 caps if you have crap Cha and no trading perks fyi.  Brings drugs and alcohol to take before you buy.
---
Unfortunately at the moment yes.  They mentioned fixing the bullion plans to unlock the ammo like it should not long after wastelanders came out.  I'm not sure if that will be fixed with update 20 which is coming next week I believe unless something changed.   Could just wait it out and see.
---
Only ways to get that plan will be getting lucky on someone's vending machine, or doing the scorchbeast queen over and over until she randomly drops it.  Not a lot of people sell them because once you learn them they stop dropping.  If you get lucky and find a holiday present duper they may have them since the presents could drop them regardless of having learned it or not.
---
You should get a random prime receiver plan for doing the queen every time until they are all learned though.  You could get lucky and get it the very first time.
---
The time investment isn't really worth it, better to just pick up every piece of ammo you find to grind it
---
Are you talking about the prime plasma gun receiver?
---
26k atoms? Holy fuck. I see why there lowering the amount
---
Dm your name I’ll add you
---
ney, its around 15-20mins, farmed it today, its regular respawn time for NPCs  
---
edit: or just server hop and pray that noone did the quest recently
---
I'll still be "friendly" trading ammo swaps with buddies, because that exchange rate is horried. But FINALLY those mini nukes and missles and 40mm grenades are good for **SOMETHING**.
---
&gt;lunchboxes
---
definitely feel like these will be sold for atoms at some point..
---
and wow. 1500 total?? that is a ridiculous drop off... i get that there are a lot of other cool, coveted things in here but man... with a 10 week schedule, that's average 22 atoms per day, assuming you're able to complete them all. really not sure how i feel about this.
---
do we know what the "quests" are already?
---
Man, people love to be skeptical about everything before it even hits. Apparently an unpopular opinion, but I’m VERY excited for these rewards and don’t mind not getting as many atoms. A lot of the very desirable items would traditionally be included in bundles with like 5 much crappier things. The camp items included here are all awesome and I can already picture what I’m gonna do with them in my next camp build. I for one am pumped
---
Probably waiting for an atom shop update and not part of seasons
---
Remember folk, seasons were never tested on the test server.  We’re getting this from the same people who have yet to fix this Auto complete bug, that has been going on for a year.
---
Your whole post boils down to your specific situation means Bethesda won't get money from you therefore Bethesda needs to nerf Atoms to earn money.
---
This totally disregards the other 3 monetisation schemes in play which also earn Bethesda money (paying for the games, Fallout 1st &amp; season catchup). 
---
It also disregards new &amp; recent players who are screwed relative to the hardcore player since beta since they don't have that massive pool of Atoms to draw from and never will without spending a ton of money. Not to mention the casual who will only find it harder to get things for free from the Atomic Shop.
---
Going from potentially multiple thousands of Atoms to 1.5k atoms max (remember, they have to play around 150 hours or so per 10 week season just to even get those measly 1.5k atoms) is a problem for a lot of people.
---
are they gonna fix the combat issue too? where enemies are getting health when you atack and as melee 5 out of 10 attacks aren't registered? where can I see the path notes on update 20?
---
26750 as of today to be exact.  That's not even how much I could have.  For the first six months or so of the game I didn't give a shit about the atom shop and didn't complete a daily or weekly challenge unless it was by accident.  I could have easily saved up several thousands more.
---
Man this is good shit right here
---
We don't know how much progress XP and events will give you.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Wait so your definetly sure I need it to get he prime ultracite ammo for the plasma caster
---
I’m not saying stealth is mandatory.  I’m saying that without it you’ll burn through a ton of ammo.  I think you make 36 5.56 rounds at a time.  Compare that to 180 .50 cal rounds at a time, or similar for 5mm.  Heavy weapons are just more efficient for loud and proud.  
---
Just speaking for myself, I’ve not found an efficient way to run comando without a suppressor and stealth.  And I agree, that does get boring.
---
No need to act like a spaz, just do some basic math instead of making up a random number like 7000, ironically indicating that YOU dont actually know what you are talking about.  Unless you get extra atoms that no one else does.
---
Even if you do the math based on 12 weeks, its still only about 6000 atoms today.  150(weeklies) x 12 (weeks) = 1800 + (50 (dailies) \* 7) \* 12 = 4200, 4200+1800 is 6000.
---
 In 10 weeks (the length of the season), you get about 1500 atoms from weeklies assuming you do them all... which is exactly what I said... The other atom's you're adding in there are for dailies, which I also said are basically being lost over the course of the season.
---
I got 220 points I can't spend fml
---
Apparently this has been happening if you previous join a server where your camp can’t be placed and you choose to stay. It dumps your vendor back into your stash. I’m guessing this was used to combat the previous duping glitch. 
---
As for the windows give it a try yourself, it’s not a glitch there just isn’t actually anything there. I’m able to jump through my own windows.
---
I hate how Bethesda is making everything a grind. Why can't I keep my cards in case I change my build?? Just give a hide option for cards we aren't using. It ends up you have to keep leveling to switch builds. Ughhh
---
Edit: we already chose the card and now I might scrap it to "level up" a legendary perk. Then 20 levels later I need that card. Oh well keep leveling.  Why isn't it a flat new card or rank up an owned card every 50 levels??
---
Gotten 3 flags, had no idea a backpack or gas mask existed.
---
38 ammo chuckles I’m in danger
---
No idea what this means.
---
Most of the items are just reskins anyway, can't you see it? Also skins that i would never buy anyway, but i won't have the choice any more to choose what to buy from the shop.
---
Gotta love how 99% of building a decent house is exploiting bugs.
---
If you're glitching it to get 4k xp per kill in glassed caverns i bet the impact could be quite heavy.
---
Not everyone has that many bobbleheads but some people have a literal metric fuck ton of them and when one has that many they are probably selling them online.
---
maybe for single player game it is, but thats mmo
---
Word. A single 40mm grenade should enough gunpowder and propellant to make sizable amount of smaller calliber ammo.
---
You miss me entirely my friend.  ALso I am not sure if those elements are really based in the MMO. I guess I liked the highly creative elements of the game. I think the "Sim Settlements" series of mods for FO4 is getting towards the difference in gaming I miss. One of my other favorite games is rollercoaster tycoon and I also loved most of the HALO series and all the Infinity Ward MWs (ew on Treyarch). I think AI that has parameters to interact with changes in player generated shape/color/objectcollage is far more interesting than another ego-narrative based target acquisition grind. I carefully dressed each of my townspeople and built all their buildings to suit the land and their stories. Shooting is fun as a grind only. I feel like MMO's treat target-acquisition/combat as the "carrot" and loading-screens/menus/waiting/repetitive-map-navi as the "stick." In the Fallout I modded I disabled junk encumbrance and would shoot to grind for stuff for building and outfitting my villages. I would try and settle disputes between all the factions I controlled, and basically try and micro-manage a utopia in a post apocalyptic world. everyday grinding for new sparkly things to show off to other people who only care about their own sparkly things is pretty silly and boring. In the Fallout I had modded I didn't need to repeat many quests, doing the same ones everyday just seems like insanity. I don't know how anybody can stand to do the same exact shit everyday??? They took all the creative tools away, they were my fav part.
---
Robert House plays a major part in this game because RobCo is an integral part of this game as well as the Vaults.  Imagine the game without **ANY** of the Protectrons, Sentry Bots or Asssaultrons. Or even your Pip-Boy. 
---
There is no other character that is so integral to Fallout (including this game) than Robert House. 
---
In the context of **this forum** you don’t get to decide what is or is not relevant to FO76. But it’s adorable that you think you do. 
---
I notice you had no comeback about Taggerdy. She is just a long dead NPC with nothing left but recordings.  So if you can’t talk about House (integral to the very fabric of the lore of this game), you can’t talk about Taggerdy.
---
Lol honestly thats like 3x what i thought theyd give us considering everything else from the ranks.
---
TLDR: If you maxed ur cards, don't open new packs you earn every 5 lvls
---
I hate your first paragraph. No, they haven’t been giving too many free atoms. Your second paragraph is spot on though. How many atoms would an ammo converter cost by itself? A lot i am guessing (if it weren’t a season reward).
---
I haven't had any issues with my camp and haven't had "unable to place camp" in quite a while and even the last 3 days since the time I am able to play a lot of US players are usually off-line unless something changed with my displays and vendors simultaneously as they were displaying until 10 mons into the session
---
You can have 1000 scrip max, I see no conflict with these things...
---
Save those too, but the packs let you waste them so those are the "gotcha"
---
I really really hope they change that system, it's just bad for so many different reasons.
---
Why
---
I agree.  Looking through the season rewards it's pretty thin regarding things I'll be interested in.  Rank 19 is realistically as far as I'd need to go, though I suppose I can mix up my Faschnacht steins with the Jangles one.
---
I like a lot of the stuff tbh, but they are taking away player choice by only giving out 1500 atoms. Unfortunately not everyone is going to like the captain cosmos themed stuff, but it would be the same for anything really. 
---
I am going to withhold judgment until I try the new system out.
---
i feel like i saw somewhere that skins and camp items will be across all characters, whereas caps, scrip and bullion will be on the character to complete/redeem the task.
---
not sure where i saw that though
---
This wiki has a bunch of locations.  I mainly did flatwoods and red rocket everytime I was on a new server.  Would net me 2 to 3 per session.  If I was going into Morgantown highschool for some reason I looked there as well.  If I was desperate I would hit as many as I could but for me flatwoods was quick and I didn't have to spend too much time on it. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bubblegum_(Fallout_76)
---
Who gives a fuck about the atoms? Seriously you guys whine about atoms all the time and constantly ask Bethesda to put things IN THE ATOM STORE instead of IN THE GAME.
---
I'd rather play the game and earn shit than get a fucking currency to use for microtransactions.
---
Well, I have card swaps to make my Heavy gunner with 15 str, either Heavy guns, Shotguns, 2H melee, Iron Fist, or 1H Melee. But when I first started playing the game and made him a rifle man, I KNOW i don't want those cards so those are scrap fodder.
---
To your complaints, at least they are working on perk load outs, and also, you CAN keep your cards. So really its the time/convenience of swapping.
---
But you can find them all over the place?
---
You earn a level every hour to 2 hours. No word about a limit. So technically there is a 24 level limit a day at most. But let's say you find an exploit, you can get rank 100 in a day. Will you get banned? For sure. Lol
---
Freddie Fear's usually has a couple, though the increased traffic seems like it's been picked over fairly frequently.
---
I make sure to snag it whenever I get a chance.  Same with Gum Drops.
---
Also, Morgan High School usually spawns on the table in the hall with a couple of corpses reaching into candy pumpkins.
---
Just commenting so I remember to watch the video later. Need to see what kind of limits there are to conversions per day per character or whatever. I've never met a bag of discarded ammo I didn't like, I grab them all. I've filled 3 alts with missiles, mini nukes, 40mm grenades, syringer ammo, etc so I've got at least 2,850 pounds of crap to redeem across the next few years.
---
Lately I have been playing so little that I usually have more 5.56 than I started with each day since I clear my ammo maker each time I log off the day after running my basic gold daily errands. I guess ammo will never have value ever again, between makers at camp, conversions and all the duped piles a few weeks ago.
---
If you read the plan for the prime plasma caster and the ammo is not showing up in the "ultracite ammo" category at the tinkers workbench then yes.  Ultracite ammo is a separate tab from the normal "ammo" category.  The ammo requires stable flux to craft as well.
---
I have only heard about this same issue happening with the gauss weapons up until now, but since it happens with those I would assume the same is true for the plasma caster.  The base game prime receiver plans are how ultracite ammo is unlocked.
---
I'm already there. Guess I'm just going to save it for awhile and see if they release new stuff. 
---
Currently at max rep for both factions and nothing left interesting imo to buy.
---
I think you should get a constant passive buff all the time but have to have it equiped like a perk card. You get one magazine and one bobblehead slot.
---
If they were to reduce drastically the atom shop prices, I would understand (a little) but the prices were outrageous at the beginning and they have just go up since then, I don't think 50 atoms a day is too much, in fact it's the reason I keep playing daily. They may get new purchases from new players, but the veteran fanbase have paid 60$ (€ in my case) and if that's your model business for the long run, we may feel bad about losing the one thing that was keeping us in the game. I consider it ok if the worldly and character etc challenges were toon locked and not account locked, since it would give me reasons for start a new one and keep playing, but not being like that, they're kinda forcing me to pay more to continue playing (since making new CAMPs is the only real endgame, I mean) and not rewarding me for doing so. You say you have 26k atoms or so, so you are not the player they are aiming for, since you don't spend anything in the AS, I spend some of the weekly earned almost every week and also I'm not the player they aim to get with this new system, but both of us are long time players... don't you see anything wrong with this new business model? If I leave and you stay but don't spend, let's hope the can reach the new players in a way they have not achieved with us or 76 will perish... and with it the only Fallout themed mmo.
---
Maybe just the poster without the quest activate?
---
At least it would be a new free poster that nobody has.
---
clever, to bad I got too little time and hate stress grinding
---
...right.
---
But who the fuck spends their time doing these boring, tedious challenges and sweating it this hard for fucking atoms?
---
r/WOSH
---
&gt;  and the clean sink 
---
No clean toilet though.
---
Me sad. The clean sink was datamined back in December with a toilet and gave the impression it would be part of a bundle in the Atom Shop. I'm glad at least the sink made it to Seasons but whatever happened to the toilet is a mystery
---
The free atoms nerf doesn't surprise me at all, and is one of the reasons I haven't been spending the ones I've earned all that much aside from a couple of on sale items (200 or less). I think they went a little too hard on this, but I also understand it to some degree.
---
Caps reward is ok. Scrip could have been higher. Gold Bullion reward feels so low that it makes a pointless addition. Neither scrip nor bullion should have been less than a 1000.
---
Perk card packs are just completely unnecessary additions. We already get them easily enough in the leveling, and most everyone at least has some access to get whatever perk cards they want/need. I haven't been under 10 extra levels to use for perks since Wastelanders started, and I've been using and adjusting the points semi-regularly. They should replace them with scrip, bullion, or atoms.
---
I've got no issues with the lunchboxes and supply crates.
---
The weapon &amp; PA skins are nice though the one I really want is of course the Appalachian Thunder Pipe which is way the hell high up.
---
The ghillie skins do nothing for me. Honestly, they feel like a mistake to have included seeing that they created an easy full blown outfit for players to get in Nuclear Winter first. They sort of mistimed that one if they planned to do this.
---
The CAMP items are nothing major to me, but will be nice to have.
---
This is a decent enough first go at seasons, but they need to adjust with better additions in some areas to make it work long term.
---
Upvoted before even really reading, sheerly because you're epic enough that you're cool with people having fun, but the issues are killing it for you atm.  You rock.
---
I just got max rep for both last week, but dang you didn't miss a day or very few. I'm no where close to getting all theplans. I'm like 6000 away from finishing my power armor and then Ill have all secret service, T65 and all the new ranged guns except gauss pistol.
---
This is one of those threads that when you look back on it when you are older, wiser (and less of a jackass) you'll think "wow. I am ashamed that I was that much of a jackass"
---
You should stop, just walk away. No one will think any less of you. It's ok.
---
Or, I could be completely wrong and you won't ever look at this behaviour and be ashamed.
---
In which case, you have fun with that and your toxic personality that will inevitably damage and likely destroy every relationship you have in life.
---
/shrug
---
I now have 5000 bullion, I want none of the plans, they don't fit my build. This has meant I now no longer have to grind and can do other things, like wander about and explore.
---
The grind in this game is NOT mandatory.
---
Ya. I have a few loadouts I can run by switching right now. It's just the point of scrapping something you maybe worked for that bugs me. I think that being at level 300 should let me pick 6 perks or fully rank 2. Pretty much any combination of 6. This new way seems really convoluted when it doesn't need to be.
---
Thanks! I know some people are having a lot of fun right now, I just wish I was one of them. I adore the world and at its core it's one of my favorite games right now, so perhaps my expectations are too high, but as of late I just feel like I log off quickly.
---
Wow. Thats a good rate, since there are TON of .38, but not as many fuel.
---
I wish I could still get those old posters.
---
It sounds like you take the game way too seriously if you care that much about grinding every last atom.
---
This legendary perk system just sucks. It's nothing but a boring grind for mediocre effects.
---
They aren't part of the season...we'll get them as part of the normal Patch 20
---
Correct. So to my point you have 5k and nothing to do with it. Maybe a sink would do you some good right now?
---
"A: Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two."
---
RIP anyone with a job.
---
My point is valid 🤷‍♂️ Be salty if you want , we have a better community that's not made up of 14 year olds with big mouths . Hate to break it to ya buddy
---
I have come here to chew bubblegum and complete challenges... and I'm all out of bubblegum. :-(
---
So I definitely need the prime plasma gun receiver get it and I have enough flux and that to make it
---
Or make them actual books that doesn't break after reading and put a 20hrs cooldown on the effect.
---
Barely anyone can be bothered to grind out the shitty challenges for atoms, and lots of people don't give a fuck about atoms at all.
---
This gives you a reason to actually play the game and do shit.
---
I don't have all the plans but I have most of what I want.
---
SS armor with cushioned, custom fit, and all buttressed.  
---
Jetpack
---
Gauss pistol and shotgun with relevant mods.
---
Both dynamite varieties
---
Armo ammo machine
---
Full set of solar armor 
---
Grocer and chemist mods
---
Honestly not much left I want or need ya know?
---
Point of information:  We would still have Mr. Gutsy (and variations) from GAI, most likely. But IIRC, even those were via a partnership with RobCo.
---
The problem is that it's predatory and it's a symptom of a greater problem, they're slowly phasing out any way to make atoms without paying them money or dedicating a large portion of your time to unlocking everything. There's a tonne of predatory physiological practises involved in battlepasses that are way too complex to list in a comment here ([Though this is a quick summary](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/battle-passes-are-replacing-loot-boxes-but-theyre-not-necessarily-a-better-deal/)).
---
The end goal of them is to catch casual players in a situation where they want the rewards but don't have time to get them resulting in them spending money on the game. The first pass with Fortnite was fine because it was a buy in once system that kept you playing a reasonable amount and if you did payed for the next one. Now we have passes like this and DbD that extort you into committing to a part time job playing the game.
---
There are still games that make these reasonably paced passes like Red Dead Online where you only have to play for a reasonable amount of time a week to earn rewards and buying tiers is optional but 90% of them aren't and it's getting worse. For players who already play this game that much sure no problem and you don't see any issue but for the more casual audience they're predatory as hell and it's moving towards the less casual audiences too, nobody but hardcore players play a single game for 3 days straight every month.
---
You’re not forced to buy atoms though
---
I am thinking Bethesda would at least allow us a one off full perk reset.
---
69 of those dropped back into your stash.
---
also I really enjoyed the environment/narrative based detective work. To me, Fallout is all the great storytelling done with the environment, the tragic set piece tableaus, the psychotic Raider remains, the heroic dead power armors. I miss the politics that actually mattered to the whole face of the map. One time I downloaded a mod that was a suicide note written as a story and built into the mechanic in a way that was so meta that even with console commands it took me awhile to suss it. I think he would have appreciated that I immediately compared it to the robobrain apparent-suicide from FH.     Anyways I'm still trying to figure out why the bridge weights dropped suddenly after 10/22/77 ...
---
Lets hope that their delay/rework makes them less mediocre. They heard the player feedback in PTS and are trying to do something about it. But for now the scrapping cards seems to be a pretty certain thing.
---
Not to mention, console players already *have* some text chat, don't they? At minimum, via the console's social system.
---
The sink, the ammo converter, the fireplace, the wallpapers, lamps, raider hanging cage, cosmos power armor, raider gasmask...
---
All of those look good. You're just cherry picking the shit ones to make it all look bad.
---
At lvl 799, I got all the cards. Was excited to buy the bow cards when they came out. Now I'm lvl 1034. I might lvl once in a day now. But I would have been nice to know this 200 lvls ago. I'll probably have 2 packs saved when they come out. When is that even supposed to be? Everything gets pushed back in this game!
---
Maybe. It's the only game I play these days, first for my (already decreasing) group of friends, second for the daily atom grind (and since building CAMPs is the only real endgame).
---
But if I do take it too seriously and they are not reaching me with this seasons model, that doesn't say any good of the model, I guess.
---
Paying for the game is a one time transaction, that's not the kind of thing live service games can live off of and why they all end up with things like dlc, microtransactions or subscription services to cover further development costs.  
---
I can guarantee you that the atom shop has not been performing to the level they'd planned for it to.  That's why repair and scrap kits exist, that's why Fallout 1st exists and that's why non-atom purchases like the Settlers/Raiders packs exist.  They were desperate to find alternative means of monetizing the game to make up for the shortfall of the atom shop even if that meant pushing the limits on what they promised would be monetized.
---
New players may be getting "screwed" but they're just going to need to be more likely to wait for something to return for sale rather than buying it at full price the first time it hits the shop.  And like I said they absolutely don't want new players to have the potential to build up a massive pool of atoms because that's antithetical to their entire business model.  The current state of the atom shop and free atoms isn't healthy for the game, they can't just leave things as they are because it's unfair that beta players have their hoards of atoms.
---
And you can't just think of the free season atoms as a 150 hour investment.  It only takes until rank 90 to hit that maximum amount so even if you only hit rank 80 that's still 1350 atoms and even if you only  hit rank 70 that's still 1200 atoms.
---
Get an assaultron head and shoot it. Pretty easy tbh. You dont get the exact amount of rads but who ever needs it?
---
Hadn't seen that quote before, so thanks :)
---
I agree the atom dailies is why I played every day. I like to choose my reward. Instead of just being thrown a bone and told take this. I would never spend atoms on reskins and the kind of mess they are pushing. I said it before I will not spend money on a supposed AAA game that I paid full price for at the beginning. I loved the game much more when it fist came out but the paid "quality of life" content. FO1st which locked fixes to game problems behind a pay wall and Waistlanders 
---
 Yes I said Waistlanders. Have left a bad taste in my mouth. This may be the final straw for me.
---
Exactly what I'm saying, would be nice to put that bullion to use on something you **DO** want. Awesome achievements by the way. Jealous of you armor unlock progress. You are like 6 weeks ahead of me.
---
It's interesting to see that the first season rewards include a bunch of perk packs. I'm guessing that was supposed to add more grist to the legendary perk mill.
---
Did you not do The Elusive Crane Quest?
---
1. Don't know but it is high enough with most fast firing heavies that vats is not the best way to use them.
---
2. I'm pretty sure it can as I think that's the 3rd on my bloodied, but I would need to double check.
---
3. That was from Fallout 4. Here the weight doesn't directly effect it, each mod has it's own specific effect on AP use rather than a universal rule. The perk doesn't reduce vats cost.
---
4. Anything with +AGI adds to AP pool and AP refresh would help, but generally heavies need to use free aim instead and it's hard to use them extensively with vats.
---
As a 20 year MMO veteran, remember it's 100% okay to take a break and come back in a couple months and catch up on the fun. It can be hard because of FOMO, but if you can get over that, you can start playing these types of games for fun, and not out of a sense of duty.  
---
Developers will always struggle to produce content fast enough to keep us busy. And Bethesda currently doesn't have a standard MMO busy work framework, until they get that sorted we're always going to be at a content deficit even for non hard-core gamers. 
---
Tldr: Play until its not fun, take a break, and come back for more fun.
---
But the fallout timeline is already fucked for the fact the brotherhood is comming to applachia.
---
I was pretty hardcore because of covid. Lol
---
Honestly the SS armor and jetpack is my favorite item by a country mile. The rest is kinda meh, although the ammo maker is a cap making machine. Nice little camp object for sure.
---
Sorry for the bad news man, but hey, you are still going to be weeks if not months ahead of a lot of players come the legendary system. And who knows, you might be able to buy everything flat out right away anyway with all the cards you have banked. Don't dispear I'm jealous of your position as a lvl 274 guy that blew his packs a few weeks ago for the bow stuff. Thought i was clever and saved them for a chance at the bow cards...Nope not as smart as i thought i was.
---
Same here. It just wish there was something else to do :/
---
Bethesda launcher, then fallout 76 and scroll a bit down. You will see the patch notes then
---
That doesn't seem likely but they could surprise us. Retroactively adding our points back could spell disaster they are not keen on attempting.
---
My excitement for it kind of died over the last 2 weeks. I don't even care much about the rewards besides the gatling skin. The wendigo event and legendary perks are what interested me the most. Idk, I'll probably play for some of the rewards when I have time but I doubt I'll end up finishing the track.
---
Possibly, but now with waste-lander new players, you have to remember not all the rewards are for vets. Plenty of sub lvl 50 characters get value out of those packs.
---
You have to understand that Atom Shop items are additional merchandises, they are not included in all 3 ways of monetisation you mentioned.
---
oh, I'm not on PC I'm on ps4, they don't have on the website?
---
A like for the title alone
---
It's preferred by 9 out of 10 neckbeards, but I was never a fan of the western theme or blue skies. Still good, but prob like it slightly less than the others.
---
I got the SS armor and ammo maker first didn't regret it. Still want the strangler set though. that's like what, 5 weeks away for me...
---
Thank you kindly for the correction!
---
Yeah, I keep hoping they'll fix them. I got the perfect roll for my solar chest before Wastelanders and there's no way I'm gonna start rerolling it to get the vines to come back.
---
Why would you use a minigun with vats? It takes a while just to spin up the barrels, then whatever AP you have is gone within a fraction of a second. If you want to use vats with heavy guns, take a look at plasma caster, the gatling gun or 50 cal, weapons that can shoot and stop at any time you want, at manageable speed, and without delay.
---
You have to wait until it turns into tin cans again, then pick it up.
---
I just server hop. No cooldown that way.
---
lol!  Same!  I LOVE blowing up cars and watching the following chain reaction if there are several of them grouped together!  Do it any chance I can get.  :-)
---
Birthday buddies!
---
You’re pleasant.
---
I wish you could read this how it sounded in your head, I’m sure it’d be a lot cooler.
---
Not really. If you leave them somewhere, someone can pick them up. Then, if they leave theirs, you can pick it up. I mean, at least when people all dump their extra ammo, it’s like everybody is just trading. If you use this thing, it eats like 80% of it. I’d rather we all just trade what we have. This fucking thing is just another way to gobble your resources. The pay-off is dog shit.
---
Also, there are limits on it? Of course. What is this, Fallout Crush Saga??
---
Oof.. so if I'm reading that correctly, it takes 160 10mm rounds for 20 5.56?
---
Fasnacht collectron and I believe the santa collectron both collect gum and candy.
---
Well if they do not do so they are screwing the old players, it's like punishing them for playing the game too early. This must be done.
---
I’m taking a break at the moment, waiting for patch 20. Playing some GTAO for a change.
---
So, based on their history with upcoming features for fallout 1st, it is safe to say that this will never happen.
---
If the ammo converter showed up in the atom shop this sub would be burned to the ground from all of the people complaining that it's p2w, who would all then go and buy it anyway and then come back in a few months demanding that Bethesda buff it and make it more p2w.  Just like the fridge.
---
I agree, like the short lived (for me) Smiley cap sync, but it was an illusion as I now have nothing worth my time.
---
Converting bullion into something else would be good.
---
Is there info on the tasks out here already?
---
Bethesda have that as an expected average for the average user. Until we see the actual breakdown of tasks/points that remains to be seen. 
---
They also said it would be a big lower on Atoms you could earn, but it’s more like about 20-25% of what you can earn now. 
---
I prefer specific details over ‘general marketing blurbs’.
---
Do not worry Jangles, I will take good care of you on my back.
---
Quad Flechette Harpoon gun: the free ammo generator of your dreams.
---
Once I got done with Wastelanders, I felt the same.  I need more story and less Fortnite. I reloaded Fallout 4 and a bunch of mods, its been really fun.  Lots of free mods out there that add lots of new content.
---
You can voice chat when in the general vicinity of another player, provided you both have mics.  Or you can easily text chat players using the PSN app on your phone, apparently but I've never used it. Outside of that, just basically useless in game emoji's.
---
It depends on the person to be honest. For me personally, I am very goal oriented and this gives me a structured goal to work towards. While it may be the same tasks as the dailies, as someone who doesn't necessarily care about atoms, it feels more rewarding than grinding for atoms that may just sit there. Do I care about the level 100 rewards? No not really... but I do care about completion and that's what this strives to do. So, objectively, yeah some people will find this better. (Personally I have never finished all daily or weekly challenges)
---
I'm not interested in any exploits. 
---
What I meant is: There must be some kind of limitation in this "new" season challenge system. Bethesda want that we play a lot but don't receive as much atoms as before. There must be another "brutal" microtransaction mechanism   hidden somewhere in this season. 
---
Maybe we will be able to get one level per day very easy let say in one hour. The second level will cost us 6 hours of grind. Those are the things I'm expecting from Bethesda.
---
Those ghillie suit items are going to be really nice when Nuclear Winter adds more limited time rewards. All the armor types in that mode will have a good camo skin now.
---
Same for me except with pre war food
---
The free fireplace door at 99 is loads better than anything I've seen in the atom shop for the past year.  So comparijg it against what has been offered leans toward the season pass imo
---
Play New Vegas and read up on RobCo.
---
I’m not in the game, and it’s been a while, so forgive me.
---
In the Mire, East of the road, there’s a series of transmission towers. Near the one East (not South) of the church, there is a buried private passenger train car. 
---
Also floating around is something called, Fallout 76 Unmapped Locations, that has things like Carhenge, the Obstacle Course, Safecracker Camp, etc. It may be on there.
---
Same here...bought it at full price and played the B.E.T.A...however, I refuse to pay for seasons when I have been a loyal player this long and only took a 10 day break last year when my husband and I moved 1300 miles away from where we were.
---
Well, we have the Wendigo Colossus event coming, plus the BOS storyline / quests...Meat Week, etc....so, it's not just about seasons.
---
Well Bethesda is just screwing themselves here, since lunchboxes are the P2W mechanism in Fallout Shelter. You'd naturally link P2W with lunchboxes with that prior experience.
---
Frankly, I'd burn more free Atoms (and then potentially buy more) if there was stuff I actually wanted in the shop. I don't care about silly power armor model replacements; I want more regular paint-jobs to trick out my suits in thematically appropriate fashion. Skins for the non-machinegun turrets that don't look jury rigged. Hell, give me ceiling mount turrets; they're already in the game. And that's only a few examples. Most of what they have in the shop is just too wacky for me to care (or downright ugly, like the Hot Rod paint on anything but the X-01).
---
Actually they release only a small part of it in june.
---
Im feeling the same way.  I gave up on the rep grind couple weeks ago.  That felt amazing.  I was able to enjoy the game again.  
---
But without any new chunk of content I don’t think im lasting any longer.   Season rewards aren’t going to be enough for me, especially since we will be doing to same things we have been doing for almost 2 years now.   
---
I really like this game, I want to continue playing it, but its coming to that point we’re im gonna have to shelf it.
---
I'm pretty sure this is their plan. The Feds are trying to make sure the crazies aren't encouraged and the lazies get to it. I mean, we know they have their eye on this game. Maybe Todd did read his JP? I dunno.
---
If I recall correctly I think there was a really simple "bridge" in 4 that looked sort of like a little pier made out of planks with some long supports you could sink into the ground that was about the size of a half floor.  I don't think it was a mod at least.
---
They just added them back not long ago, I recall seeing the Spring Bundle for multiple times the past few months.
---
The conversion numbers seem a bit ridiculous
---
Look, i get that.  You're clearly a very creative thinker/gamer who creates their own worlds and stories with your games.  That's cool and all but I think all of that is possible because it's a single player game.  You said yourself you even had to install mods to tailor-make the game to exactly what you wanted.  That isn't possible here.  Everyone has to play by the same rules and this means that not everyone is going to be happy.  Hell, there's quite a laundry list of things I would do differently with this game but this doesn't matter because I'm part of an online community not my own world.
---
I hated settlements in fallout 4 and I largely completely ignored them.  I found them to be annoying and the NPCs to be so needy.  I liked to systematically complete every quest and thoroughly explore every single map location.  I enjoy finding the lore but I don't really take it much beyond that.  Once I'm done with that the game is over for me.  With fallout 76 and other online multiplayer RPGs my work is never done.  There is constantly something I want to work towards or put effort into.  What's missing is some difficult raid progression content that I can sink my teeth into.
---
I think you're just the type of gamer who prefers single player RPGs to multiplayer ones and that's ok.  You are right, creative people like you will probably feel stifled in an online environment with all the limitations.  While someone like me who don't have a creative bone in their entire body, won't really care.
---
Edit: I do enjoy the lore in fallout quite a bit and for what it's worth, I think Fallout 76 pre-NPC was some of the best story telling they ever did because of the way it was done through notes and tapes and terminals.  It was so cool and unique to be almost a historian going through and finding out how all the different factions failed and died.
---
Unfortunately the spring bundle wasnt the same bundle
---
^ this guy is joking 😂
---
Again I think that's a dishonest assessment of the system. For one, Bethesda no more controls the rate you advance in the SCORE system (do X to rank up) than they did with the daily challenges (do X to get 10 atoms). Nothing in that regard is changing. So in that sense I don't think you're being completely honest.
---
Yes, you DO get less atoms in this scenario - something they were up front with when they announced Seasons. But you gain a wide swath of bonuses including CAMP decorations, armor and weapon skins plus a bunch of other stuff you can not and should not be able to buy with atoms, namely perk cards, legendary scrip, caps, scrap, and gold bullion. That is an improvement to me.
---
And it is not "pay to win". Playing for a couple of hours a day for a couple of weeks to get a UFO-shaped playground or a gatling gun skin isn't "winning" anything and paying 150 atoms, which you can still get without paying real money for, to unlock those same rewards still isn't winning anything. 
---
Even if you were (frankly) dumb enough to pay on the order of $150 to buy the 15,000 atoms it'd take to unlock every rank, all you'd end up with is some cosmetics, some scrap and some in-game currency that, yes, will let you get in-game stuff, but a.) wow is that dumb and b.) who the hell cares. There is no 'winning' Fallout 76 and nobody is going to get wrecked or have their play experience cheapened or worsened because another player paid a few bucks to get some cosmetic crap and some scrip. What another player does with his or her own money is no concern of mine. Or yours.
---
So is it objectively better? Maybe, maybe not. Is it objectively worse? I don't think you can make that argument, objectively. It is _different_? That much is undeniable. I may prefer something like this that gives me something I can actually USE IN THE GAME like caps or scrip or gold, just for playing the game like I already do and not exclusively atoms for cosmetic items I may or may not even want. And then I get some currency for cosmetics on top of that, if I do want something. You, a wholly different person with unique tastes and expectations, might not like that very much at all. And that's fine. But I don't think it's objectively better OR worse, simply different, and that's fine.
---
Hmm which bundle are you talking about then, I thought you were talking about the beautiful plants and shit.
---
You actually have to physically pick them up yourself not buy them
---
Software development is a fickle process.
---
That’s basically what I did. I still have fun aimlessly walking around the map, but I’ve gotten to where modded Fallout 4 is my main game again. Plus, all those settlement mods really are something.
---
Lunchboxes have been in all Bethesda Fallout games in some form or another.
---
Idk i bought the spring bundle and got trees bushes the roof tiles and 1 plant but the one in thinking about had the small succulents a red plant some potted plants and such
---
I hope instead of chewing some bubblegum we just need to chew one pack of bubblegum.
---
Inb4 fall season reward. XD
---
By "easy" I mean they wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel or anything to implement.  The basic textures, models and mechanics already exist in the game or are readily available to be ported from 4.
---
Wendigo got pushed out of update 20 to a TBA date, likely end of July
---
BOS is slated for Winter so likely not til February
---
Wastelanders endgame content was purposefully timegated in reward redemption (smart move all things considered) but due to delays there’s nothing to meet the player at the end of that grind
---
Meat Week is the only thing to look forward to other than seasons which wew
---
Yes I'd rather not have challenges that involve teams as I play solo a lot. I had a couple I played with but they're not playing at the moment and I play off and on. 
---
It seems rather unfair for solo players - although when is the update which puts you in teams coming out? I'm assuming it's not mandatory...
---
Yes, as items, not as openable packs, except Fallout Shelter.
---
&gt; That's assuming you even get to rank 100. For the average person, that's not likely to happen so it's even worse on average for them.
---
That's assuming you actually know how the progression will go. They have only ever given vague descriptions of earning score via "playing the game", and they gave a rough estimate of 1-2 hours of play time per rank based on where you are on the board, but they also said the burrows will be a challenging dungeon for a team of 50+ players so we know their word means nothing
---
This week's ITV hinted that earning exp will factor into it, which means they are just giving you yet another reason to run a bloodied build to one shot everything and get that exp bonus from unyielding armor, so for those guys it may very well take 15 minutes of west tek farming to get that rank up
---
They probably just didn't want to call it the Summer Update since they pulled features out.  Maybe intending to push the rest out in July or August.
---
You're being downvoted but you're right.
---
This is awesome!!! I can't wait until the xbox one is up and running.  Bravo to everyone involved!
---
So it’s a combat rifle skin and not a fixer Skin... ugh... maybe one day
---
Sim Settlements is amazing.
---
Ah the Green Thumb bundle then, maybe I mixed up the names.
---
Anytime. Adding now.
---
Ah yes my video on this glitch has 6k+ views and I guarantee it won’t be patched. I’ve gotten up to 30k XP for simply placing a table and some rugs, definitely gotta go hard with the glitch when seasons come out to get those sweet, sweet, rewards.
---
The question was whether or not "Seasons" would have enough content to last the summer...I was pointing out that there is more coming than just the Season 1 grind. BOS is actually in 2 pieces - the first piece is actually coming pretty soon (in fact, the first part of it was part of the PTS).
---
So they black skin is for the combat rifle and fixer :/
---
Yes that one! I hope it comes back
---
Bro what? Of course they’re hostile when you seek revenge
---
That's why they also included non space themed stuff I'd assume.  Stuff like the gillie suits, raider stuff, chicken coop etc as well as literally throwing in the kitchen sink.
---
Awesome. I'm eating lunch and will be on in just a few mins 🖤
---
If you got the Fasnacht collectron, he has a chance to bring bubblegum.  
---
I leave mine unlocked.
---
:/ not cool
---
Given the presence of Atoms in the legendary run tree it doesn't look like there is a phasing out happening here.   
---
Also every argument you can make about predatory battle passes goes right out the window because this one is FREE.
---
They are openable items in 3, NV and 4
---
Alrighty 😊
---
YESSSSS!!!!
---
I understand that.  When I first started playing, I didn‘t know about the daily’s or weeklys, I just played; earning atoms via challenge was purely coincidental.
---
  Wasn’t until I saw something I wanted - and I asked  the player how to obtain it -  that the existence (and purpose) of challenges and their relation to the atom shop - was explained.
---
Thats a great question.  Are seasons character specific or account wide?
---
Im loving the hell out of it since I started a few weeks ago after plowing through FO4
---
You really don't get how predatory psychology works do you..
---
However,he is currently in a coma and won't wake up for decades.  I don't see him playing any active part in 76.
---
What on earth are you on about... We are simply talking about if a character is relevant or not, literally no one is being toxic.
---
Toxic would be if i started to talk shit, or insulted people, which i don't. I am literally saying both sides are right, because it's just a minor post, not spam, so it does not matter. It's you guys who take it waaaay too serious.
---
You're literally the one acting "toxic" tho, by trying to belittle me for having an opinion, and saying my behavior is bad, even tho i have said nothing offensive.
---
The more money grubbing schemes they come up with the less new players are willing to buy and support the game. You don't see any other company besides EA making such a bad business model.
---
Still items, not packs, learn the differences.
---
Meh.  I don't feel like carrying around an extra weapon and ammo just for rads. I just use the radiation trap at my camp or a nearby source of water. I only want the barrel for convenience.
---
And Unlocked Settlement Objects. Don’t forget that.
---
Its the same I see haha I just turned 23 today. Happy birthday to you mate.
---
I always put a mix of drinks in. Usually 3 nukashines, and a few other alcoholic bevvies
---
I get the impression they really wanted fo76 to be a blood thirsty pvp game. But they mostly have their loyal single player fan base who are obviously not 100% pvp driven. And many of those loyal fans enjoyed building. And now they can easily build and share with the community. 
---
Hopefully they will soon fully embrace their builders. After watching the 1425'th shelf filling/building tip video on Youtube, you might think they would look into adding the highly desired functionality, along with all ones mentioned above and the countless other fantastic suggestions one can quickly find on the forums, reddit, etc.
---
Mandatory upvote

Well you don’t need love if you’re getting double penetrated

I set refractor to 3, first aid to 3, wear 4 pieces troubleshooters armour and take all 3 pylons.
---
Then I pray I can get enough hits in to be able to loot the body, I'm usually running and hiding spamming stimpaks, though.
---
Santatron collector bot gives coal on a regular basis.
---
Yes, you are correct. RobCo initially designed and manufactured the mr handy, but then signed a military contract with General Atomics to produce the mr gutsy.  So robco was the brains behind it and GAI had the nuclear power to mass produce gutsy’s for the military.
---
I found that there is a vendor in the white springs that sells it but the plan is like 1500 caps.
---
I wouldn't mind an extra 1000 atoms, but I do think rewarding you for mundane stuff is better than doing ridiculous and random out of the way challenges.
---
Do you have Amazon Prime? Maybe sth to do with that, since it's linked to Twitch Prime.
---
amazing work, is there specific times the mule is available?
---
So awesome thank you
---
Yeah that was leaked to be an atom shop item
---
Nope, don't have amazon or twitch. I've looked through everything and I haven't been charged, it doesn't even say that I'm subscribed to it on my xbox subscription page. It's odd
---
Did it happen to have a price leaked?
---
I’d like them to make legendary plans for all existing weapons and armors, just like wastelander items. If I want to roll a legendary LMG, I go spend the gold on a legendary LMG plan, buy legendary modules from murmrgh then start crafting/rolling my LMGs. That would be a massive addition to the list of stuff people can do, and it literally cost the dev team nothing.
---
Edit: just like wastelander items, crafted Legendaries should be character-locked.
---
Being mentioned over and over as a part of the game does make the character relevant, but being mentioned once for the sake of lore does not. Sure, he's the reason there are robots, but again: he as a character is not relevant for the game. His creations might be, but that's it. He, as an individual character, adds nothing to 76. They could literally have left out the terminal part, and no one would have cared, because it changes nothing.
---
House is a super relevant fallout franchise character, but not a super relevant 76 character, which is why i say that posting his birthday on the FALLOUT subreddit would be far more fitting. I am also saying it's stupid to complain about the post being here, but that part keeps getting ignored, because hardcore fanbois only see the part where i call a character irrelevant for ONE game, and BAM! fanbois go crazy.
---
But who in there right minds does all those dailies!
---
Most players I know?
---
If you are going to become a conduit be prepared to use a lot of stimpaks. I set first aid to 3 and regularly grab all 3 pylons, then hide while everyone else gets the glory.
---
I usually come out of my hole long enough to get a couple of hits in.
---
I just chase the bastard with my Zealot Fire Axe.
---
I completely feel you. I took a break from destiny 2 to go to division 2.  Had fun, played a season.  Destiny 2 new seasons looked meh, division 2 was feeling meh, came to fallout 76 2 weeks ago.  Having a blast.  As a new player, the season will act as a catch up mechanic for me.  I'm excited.  But I honestly, whole heartedly understand where you are.  Was there in destiny 2 and division 2.  Seriously consider taking a vacation in another game. It helps perspective and helps you feel what you are missing from the other games, if anything.
---
If it's any consolation, I feel all three if these games have similar issues.  They cannot execute on keeping up engagement across the board, fail to fill the cash shop in a meaningful way, and thing more grind is the answer.  It's maddening.  (This is all besides the same PVP issues too)
---
Screw FOMO.  Have fun instead.
---
Welcome to any battle pass ever
---
Joining you now
---
Clean sink? Where the fuck is my clean toilet‽
---
Except this game started off with the bare minimum of money grubbing you can really have in a live service game while staying above water.  Although overpriced the initial atom shop was devoid of anything even remotely p2w like the repair kits, fridge etc.  Bethesda seriously hamstrung themselves by not being money grubbing and promising from the start that all story content would be free.
---
And you're delirious if you think that EA is the only company out t here that monetizes the shit out of their games.  Look at a game like Warframe which is somehow a gold standard among many for how to monetize right yet where you can spend cash to unlock all the new "characters" as soon as they've released bypassing the grind to unlock and then the cost/time to craft, or how you have to buy inventory space for literally everything.  EA and Activision just get a lot of flak because they're more flagrant about it and they have such a storied history of it that everyone immediately associates them with it.
---
I played beta and was very disappointed but continued onto the first year . I was still not pulled to the game and took time off until this last April.  I haven't stopped playing a single day myself.  Level 127, and beat all questlines and now into the grind. Still love it. The wastelanders update added a very needed aspect of fallout for me, NPCs. I cant wait to see what season two and the upcoming BOS storyline looks like .
---
Easy fix for Bethesda would be auto scrapping max collection perk cards and letting everyone start building currency I'd think.  Then you can open whatever and get ready.
---
Which 50 caliber are you using? If you use refined, it’ll outdamage the 308 unless it’s prime. The plan can be bought from Watoga train station.
---
I literally want 2 things - the sink and the ammo converter. Caps, Scrip, Bouillon = easy to get. (like 250 is one day's worth of bouillon) - perk cards? I have 21 perks I haven't unlocked because I don't need them (lvl 112). I get fewer atoms and a bunch of junk I don't want + stuff I'd get anyway. Hurray.
---
They do control the rate of advancement because they designed the whole system. Everything since launch has been a slippery slope of excusing away Bethesda's decisions on monetization. They do what they can get away with and if people lap up their changes, then we will see more. That may be doom saying but I stand by it based on how they've gone back on their word so many times already.
---
Their being upfront about cutting back on atoms doesn't minimise the loss. If I tell you I'm robbing your house, do you abide by the action? No. Furthermore, you don't address the absolute loss of choice in rewards. If I don't use power armor, it isn't a valuable reward. People chose how to spend their atoms before, now they are losing choice.
---
As to pay to win, I very obviously was referring to being able to pay atoms to advance up the season.
---
The entire game is a grind at late game. The "content" they've added is reputation, bullion, and script grinding. Earning rewards against that grind is pointless. You are earning a reward whose only metric of value is the time you put into the game to get it at end game. It's like if your boss wanted to pay you a currency whose only exchange value was less time spent at your work desk.
---
I believe you might want to submit a ticket, I don't think posting here is going to do much.
---
Apparently not if it means that a publisher can never offer something as an option in exchange for a payment.   
---
Here I thought that was like business 101.
---
I sell serums for 350 a pop, best sellers are adrenal, speed demon and marsupial. I can craft all of them and most has paid for themselves -exceptions are Herd Mentality, Talons,  Unstable Isotope and Plague Walker.
---
Yeah but I have 79 left and replace the ones in the bowl whenever they’re drank.
---
I've googled for a screenshot, because I apparently breezed through that quest, and didn't bother to read the terminals, I can't find a screenshot with this mention
---
Damn I did it like 4 times and got Father Winter helmet.
---
150 per level so 14,850 to go from level 1 to 100
---
Too bad I'm gonna take a 9 iron to his fucking face in 261 years.
---
&gt; caps and bullions rewards are absurd
---
To bounce on that, we get at most 250 bullions from this season, you can hardly get anything remotely useful with this when most things are above 500.
---
I’m excited to see what the roadmap 2020 provides, should be enough to keep us on for another year at least
---
If you never did all the challenges, what's different about this? That they put a colourful board game graphic on it and tied it to a period of time?
---
I don’t think any of the ATX items can have their prices found before they come out
---
Better throw out all the value of those lost earnable atoms because you like one cosmetic reward from the new system. It makes perfect sense!
---
ugh, old people moment. i confused the daily cap with the holding cap
---
Go to Blackwater Mine for coal. It’s in the main tunnel on both sides. You’ve probably walked by it 1000 times without realizing.
---
Check your bank statement to see if it’s charging you. If not I’d just stay quiet and take that free Fo1st
---
You totally can buy yourself to max rank. If you don't play at all during a season but hop in on the very last day with 5 minutes remaining, you'd be able to buy rank 1-100. Cost would be 15000 atoms, though. (1500 would be "free" since you get 150 free every 10 ranks or so). That said, that's about $120 USD
---
A couple of suggestions.
---
Try something else in game. For me it's roleplaying.
---
Try a more challenging build. We run around without legendary equipment during our RP, it totally changes the game. Try it out.
---
Honestly Bethesda made the game far, far too easy with legendary effects combined with consumables and everything else. I just switched from my power armor heavy weapons build to a hybrid explosives/rifles build and it's totally changed the way I play and renewed my interest in trying different things.
---
I 100% understand your burnout, it is super easy to get there when there is no challenge, and I do blame Bethesda for making easy mode far too accessible in this game, but that doesn't mean we have to do it to ourselves as well.
---
All 2 of them?
---
We agree it is less of a game then, to fit. I just feel there were already too many of this kind of title, and that Bethesda had the only game in town as regards their specific brand of RPG chaos and plasticity. One of a kind. I would have taken either Elder Scrolls or Fallout, but to get shafted twice, just makes me feel totally unseen. I also have no idea why anybody thinks pvp could be intellectually stimulating in a game so easily broken. I always thought Bethesda titles had to be "played-along-with" to work. Their engine seems too broken to enable enough strategic difference in an online pvp setting to be viable in the modern FPS market. How any person close to the game could not see that from a million miles off I know not. What a waste of everyone's time, developers and players.
---
wrong game friend.
---
The only screenshot I have is when they say house is shutting down the auto cache project I never got the rest but not sure how to upload a photo to a comment thread here

It's not hard, and doesn't take very long at higher levels. It's also literally the only rewarding thing you can do that isn't total RNG. And for me, it was the only real reason to keep logging in every day. 
---
With this season track, I'll probably play long enough to get the ammo converter, and then take a good long break to play the dozens of games in my library I haven't even touched yet.
---
Yeah I'm sooo bored of FO76. I started playing other games and I feel justb fine.  Plus with ps5 coming out, dated graphics and bug ridden games like FO76 will be left in the dust.
---
My subscription is not listed in my subscriptions either but they get there money every month. Check the card on your Microsoft account.
---
0
---
I am in the same boat.  Different perk sets for my character dictate that I have different levels of many of the most used cards.  So I have level 1, 2 and 3 of many cards that I want to keep.  Why should they make that next to impossible?  I hope this isn't a thing by the time the legendary perks are released.  There must be a better way.
---
It will be put in atomic shop as soon as people will loose most of their atoms they have stored. Now the only option will be to but them so 😁 i think now a lot of good stuff will come to atomic shop.
---
I think your just bad at maths mate.
---
I for one will probably take a break most of the season because frankly it's not worth my time, and I have other games to play that will be more rewarding.
---
You say it's less of a game but ive spent 10x the hours in it than i have in any other single player fallout game.  So idk.
---
This. Thank you.
---
Scrapping cards is fine, but at least let us "Bank" the new ones that we get from perk packs.  I don't see the need for the excess cards to just go poof.
---
Great idea, I mean there is already the Nuka Cola machines which can distribute Nuka Cola as well (it might be a Atom Shop item, I forget how/when I got it)

Did they fix the issue where you can only have a level 15 helmet?
---
Yes that's why I wrote this because those who didn't know have lost out
---
He doesn’t have to be ‘super relevant’. He only has to be ‘relevant’.  
---
Whether he is more relevant in another game isn’t the criteria. The sub’s rule criteria is that it be relevant to this game, and doesn’t require that it be in the game specifically. 
---
Todd Howard is relevant to this game but is not mentioned in this game. But posts about him are allowed in this sub. 
---
Relevant means connected. Robert House is connected to this game, and that’s simply the truth. The only subjective part was whether or not the relevance is sufficient**in the context of this sub**. That’s the part ***you’re*** forgetting.
---
You have exactly zero authority on determining if Robert House is relevant enough to this game for a post about him to be within the rules of this subreddit.  And since a moderator (who *does* have such authority) has deemed the relevance is sufficient, your opinion is completely invalid in the context of this sub. 
---
No matter how you try to rationalize it, the decision has been made that Robert House is relevant enough to Fallout 76 that posts about him are allowed.
---
Have a good day. Go find a battle you might actually win. Because this isn’t it.
---
And there are already too many House Birthday posts in the other subs. But, yeah, let’s encourage **one more** to go over there.
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Not sure that would be so easy. I like having lvl 1,2 and 3 for cards to swap if my team is sharing it
---
Similar speculation happened when the alien bundle was first released, sadly nothing came of it.
---
I've checked it, nothing's missing and nowhere is showing I was charged anything.
---
I see, thanks. I was wondering about that.
---
Delete post and say nothing! lol
---
Those wouldn't be affected.  Basically, if you've got a 1, 2, and 3 of a 3 star, then any other cards after that would be scrapped only.  That's why I stated max collection and not max stars.
---
I think you are
---
I want a chocolate fountain
---
The only thing I ever do consistently is the dailies. It's my end-game and why I subscribed to Fallout 1st. In a few minutes after Tuesday's weeklies reset I had all but the gather Nuked Flora and complete challenges as a group done. That includes the brewing challenge. And then I logged out of the game. Done. No Scorch Beast Queen slot machine for me.
---
Theres nothing stopping them from putting them in the shop still. It's just the kind of small bonus they've felt comfortable monetizing lately.
---
Holy shit, it's only rank 5? I was sure that something so highly sought after would be at near the end of the game board to encourage people to grind like mad or pay money to advance along the board.
---
edit: We also finally know what those lunchboxes are for. "Open for you and your friends! You and those who are close by get an XP Boost and a random effect for 1 hour!"
---
The more interactable stuff in camps the better! Especially if it facilitates wholesome player interactions
---
Sorry for your loss bruh. Maybe because I don’t care too much about screw farming I always try to kill the colossus as soon as possible knowing how things can go wrong in so many ways if the session drags on for too long.
---
Do you enjoy gathering water slowly? What makes the sink desirable?
---
I can you add to my list.  I am on during the day and will need to form a team for this this week's daily challenges. DM me with your name so I can add you.
---
*What is this...A-BRAX-O..."Scouring" for?*
---
PvP. With the build I want, faster firing (faster than .50) bigger damage + small explosive effect + accuracy... if I can get an average 20 shots to land it (about 1.3 sec - see  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) ) would down even the most god tiered / properly built player. If I can auto aim (VATS) it then this makes the whole engagement that much closer to a win. Especially vs a tesla build who doesn't even need vats. Minus a cheater - of course. There are still some things I need to work out before I can consider it viable. The whole spinning up thing is a tradeoff for VATS actually working with miniguns(or at least there will be so many shots being fired + spread out they are going to get hit a majority of these shots). Alternatively just anticipate the shot or keep it spinning.
---
Yah that's the plan. Worse they take it back like a bank getting your hopes up.
---
It would be nice to have an ally that's not always complaining about the hot underground place of the world we live in.
---
hackers are helping fo76 by stopping these buggers charging a stupid amount for stuff 😁😁😁 all good just wait and then it will be all fix
---
What is being done by the community to avert Bethesda UI holes is sometimes ridiculous, sometimes amazing, sometimes both. Kudos.
---
Pretty excited
---
One of my best purchases. I also use all the plants in the Green Thumb bundle, but rarely the dome haha.
---
Glad this post is getting upvoted, more people need to see this.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Looks like Todd has blessed you with Fo1st, you are his favorite child.
---
Warframe is a good F2P model that works. The problem with 76 is it's not F2P it's a full priced $80 CAD (Whatever that is in US $60 or $70) with thousands of dollars worth of non-appealing, buggy atom shop items, along with a subscription; which 100% would be okay by itself as a substitute for the free add-ons. Along with purchaseable bundles outside the game.
---
Fallout 76 is also on the cheaper side of the "live service" spectrum on the developers side. All bugs are discovered by the players through the PTS. I personally haven't seen any form of moderators or admins in-game; so I highly doubt they exist and are getting a payroll.
---
The Colossus might make it back that soon, but I doubt legendary perks will. That system was near universally panned from top to bottom and is going to need a "back to the drawing board" rethink before they even get to coding the changes. Maybe with the Fall rebalance update (though, as a programmer myself, the thought of adding yet another thing to an already far-ranging set of changes is horrifying).
---
&gt; I think this will be the end of the game for veterans like me, when we reach the item we want, we may left it until another season and it will be more difficult for them to attract us back if other games got us.
---
I think this may be the most salient point anyone has made here. With the weekly and daily atom challenges, I've at least had a reason to play regularly to accumulate currency for when something eventually shows up that I'll want. With this season, I can already see that there's nothing down the road that is worth my time getting, therefore there's no reason to keep playing once I get the ammo converter.
---
Yes Bethesda changing how many atoms you earn each day is literally equivalent to robbing your house. I've heard worse metaphors, but that's up there.
---
Bethesda is a company and companies like money and want you to spend more of it. Here is my shocked face.
---
And what loss of choice? There is a clear INCREASE in reward variety. Previously the reward was ONLY atoms. Now it's atoms, caps, scrip, gold, cosmetics and mild utility items. That's a GOOD thing.
---
And yeah the late game is grindy. Welcome to MMORPGers in the modern age where you do stuff to get more stuff to do more stuff. Whoptee-freakin-do. If you don't like it, don't play. And no, it is not like being paid to work with more office time. It's like playing a totally optional video game a couple of hours a day and getting some cool stuff every so often. It's a game my friend, not your job. If it's not fun to you, don't do it.
---
I would like the rolling thing but making them untradable is a stretch. It makes the current system pointless. You would never buy the legendary picks or stuff like that. Plus it devalues good rolls as they now become easier to obtain. Needs another way I think.
---
Your comment is the equivalent of your grandmother telling you to go sit in a corner and twiddle your thumbs if you're bored. 
---
The point is that most people have attempted what you suggested, many times over already, and there just isn't anything left to do. The entire map has been explored many times over, the final boss beaten (in many cases soloed). What the hell else are we supposed to do at this point. And now they expect us to grind even further for a few trivial rewards? 
---
How about seriously challenging and engaging content with rewards that not everyone will be able to attain? You know, some exclusivity. But oh no, that might be too problematic for politically correct Bethesda where everyone is supposed to get a trophy.
---
Was AWOL nerfed at some point? Doing it recently, the Mr Gutsy at the end hasn't always been 3 stars for me. Sometimes it's been just been 1 or 2.
---
There’s an event called campfire tales and you have to find twigs to keep the fire going so when I went hiking earlier today I was looking at the twigs thinking that I needed them for future reference lol
---
That's the tip of the iceberg.  We get 25, by a quick count, weapon/armor/power armor skins which at a, severely low mind you, estimate of 500 atoms per puts us at 12500 atoms worth of value which doesn't include CAMP items and the like.
---
Weightless assaultron head and a 100 cells carrying here. No weight whatsoever. But cant argue is still effective when not in camp or nearby water/ rads.
---
I give thanks to papa Todd
---
There is no data that indicates that the challanges themselves won't provide atoms. My understanding of this information was that besides the usual challenge atoms every now and then you'll receive additional atoms. In total more, not less, than before. Time will tell.
---
That would be so awesome but unfortunately she passed a long time ago, and I lost all my photos in a hurricane. But I built a little contemporary house to store my benches in my build before my current one, and I couldn't figure out why I loved it so much. Then I realized this little house was basically a verbatim copy of my great grandmother's house. So it'd be cool to see how much I could pull together from memory, but I need the folk art to do it. :)
---
Interesting, but since PVP damage is capped, isn’t it the same as using a Junkies or Bloodied explosive minigun with less Vats cost? The 5mm minigun actually fires faster than the gauss mini, almost twice as fast if you use Accelerated barrel.
---
Yes you can decorate other camp if your on there team
---
If that's the way you account for value, I have a big pile of manure that you're welcome to come pick up.
---
Is it really that useful? I was excited when I got it because I've seen everyone hyping it up, but I only get 5 rads at a time with it(maybe I'm doing it wrong?).
---
Shooting my feet with a Gamma Gun is way faster.
---
I feel like the loss of atoms is easily offset by all the scrip and bullion sprinkled in along the way. I don't buy much from the shop anyway, so I'm happy to get those as a bonus instead.
---
Bobbleheads arent even required, you can use the food xp bonuses and armor stack to get stupid amounts of xp as well
---
Its also the birthday of my girlfriend's dog! Haha
---
Its more for management when you're already slightly over/under 20% health. Not so much for going from full health to 20%
---
The amount of free Atoms you can get per month is greater than the number of Atoms you get for subscribing to Fallout 1st. We Fallout 1st members get 1650 paid-for Atoms per month. Free Atoms amount to over 2000 per month. The number is close to 2400 even. Almost all of it and the choice that comes with it will vanish.
---
That's false. they said that there would be less atoms.
---
Thank you!
---
No, it's been said it'll take 1 hour at first, and close to max it'll be like 2 hours.
---
Stupid question but do you have Bobby pins?
---
That is more cool than anything Bethesda could ever be capable of implementing in any of their games. and that makes me sad lol
---
There is nothing for riflemen. I made a new heavy character recently to try new weapons.
---
It doesn’t affect world drop since those are still tradable. It’s just an added option to let players grind for what they look for. Say I want a good LMG but haven’t had much luck in farming or murmrgh, I can spend the gold and try my own luck in crafting. Locking to character is absolutely necessary since dupers duped shit load of legendary modules and are trying to profit from them.
---
I would not be OK with non-paying players having the best (or any for that matter) item from FO1 for free.
---
However, I would be fine with a new subscription level that allowed someone to buy access to a limited scrapbox that could hold some finite amount of each scrap.  Something like 2k of each scrap.  Give them that and the tent (nothing else) for something like $5 a month.  This I would fully support.
---
As for aid having a separate container, why not just allow stackable aid items (up to a reasonable limit) to go into the normal scrapbox?  I'd be thrilled with that.  Not too sure that a separate container is necessary.  I do think that aid should not be storable in any limited scrapbox though.  If you want perks from FO1, everyone should have to pay the same amount based on the level of perks that you want.
---
Ok, must be I've missed something. I'll recheck.
---
Exactly why faster firing is so much more important. If I've already shot once in .09 seconds or less... then if you're doing enough damage you're still going to hit that damage cap. So in that 1.3 seconds of firing you also have 20 chances of staggering plus you're negating things like serendipity. But this is why VATS is important.... they can move ALOT (or be jumping / jet packing) in that 1.3 seconds and every fraction of a second is crucial that you're landing shots. With my junkies build, a chem, bobblehead, and a magazine to ensure... I'm going to be hitting the average player for that cap each shot(if I can land them). And the top tiered player will take &lt;20 shots (or 1.3 sec) to down all perks, consumables, 5x assassins, etc considered. As for minigun vs gauss minigun - gauss comes out on top(top players are essentially invulnerable for the first few shots, then it's an up to 80%? I think DR after that). So all about the DPS in this case. Use  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Only viable if I can make it last 20 shots in VATs without sacrificing survivability, though. Otherwise you're just another wind up glass cannon spraying and praying.
---
So, this insinuation that playing the game with lesser builds/lesser gear and roleplay itself isn't challenging and engaging has me thinking maybe your grandmother was right and maybe you should go twiddle your thumbs in the corner.   
---
Roleplay is extremely challenging, and it's an insult to those who have invested the time and energy into it to dismiss it like you have here.   
---
Yes, the game lacks challenge, if you fall into the trap of chasing the best meta and datamining all the secrets right out of it, but really in the end that is a personal choice that is made by the players themselves.
---
It didn't take that long to get to the, "well, companies like money so all of what they're doing is okay" argument eh?
---
Atoms represent absolute choice. I can spend them on anything in the atom store. A locked in list is the antithesis of choice. They've gone from absolute choice in cosmetics to no choice in cosmetics. When has that ever been a good thing?
---
Lol, and now the other argument, that "it's just how mmorpgs are." You guys set the bar so low. You should demand more instead of settling.
---
It could be as if we're paying for an armed escort to take us, or it's as if that's the cost of supplies to make the trip.
---
But I choose to believe that it's simply just tithe for, our Lord and Savior, the Mothman; who graciously transports us and also brings us back from the dead.
---
Again, you're talking about him being relevant enough to be posted about, but i have already stated i'm talking about the big picture, not simply about the subreddit(the big picture being the game it self, not a subreddit) 
---
He is not a relevant character in 76 in any way, he is simply mentioned. What IS relevant to the game tho, is his creations, but that still does not make him relevant as a character. He's an easter egg, nothing more. He does not play a big part in the game.
---
Well, if you use the stealth suit nothing agros you, just pop stims and shoot, you do have to keep moving because even tho it will not directly agro you it has a tendency to laser face in the direction it's taking damage from.
---
Halloween candy counts, so monster mash!
---
Never heard of it.
---
Looked into it. Definitely looks like something I'd try. And at only $20, once I get some money I wouldn't mind picking it up.
---
Where is it In game? the game board I mean.
---
Yeah, but it's better than just dropping thousands of .38 or whatever on the ground. The ammo generator from the raiders is pretty fucking worthless too, but a little bit for free is better than nothing.
---
The amount of free Atoms you can get per month is greater than the number of Atoms you get for subscribing to Fallout 1st. We Fallout 1st members get 1650 paid-for Atoms per month. Free Atoms amount to over 2000 per month. The number is close to 2400 even. That means greater 6000 Atoms over three months as opposed to a pathetic 1500 Atoms and some garbage in-game currency. Seasons will be a turd wrapped in a pretty package.
---
Might just be a bug that you discovered with the perks. Maybe logging out for a little while and then going back on may fix it. That’s usually what I do
---
Yeah 1.5K atoms but you GET several power armor skins and a ton of other cosmetics. Assuming that all of the cosmetic stuff was destined for the atom shop if seasons never became a thing you could not have bought all this stuff with the amount of challenge atoms we are getting right now.
---
People here have been saying "why don't they put cool new stuff in the base game instead of the atom shop!" for a long time now... well here it is. You can earn all this stuff for free instead of it going into the atom shop.
---
On the flip side, there's hundreds (thousands? I didn't count) of scrip and bullion sprinkled throughout the board as well.
---
It’s time to start vault-tec
---
Damn didn't know you could dupe those modules too is nothing safe!!! Yea I like if you could just craft everything you want but still it does devalue them I'm not gonna go trade for that handmade I'll just make it! Even if it's not tradeable its value is still impacted. Economy in the game is pretty busted. No currency had value. It's good gear for good gear trade and hope u aren't scammed or else you find trusted traders.
---
I am in that group of players that don't care that much for 'getting the ultimate gear' (because it's quite pointless, at least right now) and just loves collecting stuff and building CAMPS. I know for fact that I am not a minority, I would argue that most people that still play 76 are into camp building. With this new system, yes, I AM forced to buy and Bethesda knows it, so they capitalize on that.  
---
Listen, like I said, 76 is an extremely flawed game, from laggy servers (Europe has it extra bad) unlimited bugs and glitches (especially for camp building which I'm into) half-finished features and others that are very questionable.. to derelict technology &amp; engine.. I mean.. I can't even use g-sync properly and have to go backwards tech wise to reduce stuttering and other issues (and that's only by 80%). COMBINE all that, and then every time I have to pay for Atoms I'm going to cry inside a little.  
---
If they showed me that they seriously care for bug fixing and they halted all new content and instead decided to expand and fix/flesh-out the current (i.e. raiders &amp; settlers) I would feel less guilty for spending more money on this game.
---
Nothing practical in terms of game mechanics - it's just a cosmetic item that lots of people want in the game (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=clean+bathroom&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Basically people want to be able to build bathrooms in their camps without having them being filthy.
---
They aren't in the atom shop, they're in game rewards. Reading comprehension is tough, but try to keep up.
---
I would say around 5K...and you can purchase it (obviously for way less)from the Vendor Bot that spawns @ Charleston Station (not the one in the station itself) ☺️☺️☺️
---
Pre war food is one of the easiest challenges in  the game, a single round of Monster Mash leaves you enough candy to do the challenge five or six times over.
---
Yes, forgot to mention this one. Thank you!
---
With the exception of one handed (most of which are useless like rolling pin,lead pipe, pipe wrench) doesnt rifleman have the largest variety of weapons to choose from?  Already had a gauss rifle, and you got the Fixer which is an amazing weapon now that its availible in tbe legendary flavor.
---
You could always roll SS armormor T65 with your gold.
---
Try to get a buddy into the game! Experiencing content co-op with a new player is a very refreshing experience.
---
Sounds similar to what I do! Instead of making relish, I make cranberry cobblers and sell them really cheap. It would be cool to have something like the nuka cola vending machine, but more like a vending machine for food!
---
&gt;The problem is that it's predatory 
---
It's literally free shit for playing the game. What the fuck are you talking about predatory?
---
I mean if you just want to just help a struggling soul I’m all about it lol. Just really started.
---
I've already lost out, because I have all ranks of many cards.  I want to keep it that way, but the new system will force me to scrap many of them if I want legendary perk level ups.  IMO this is beyond stupid.  Especially considering that Bethesda is already looking to release perk loadouts and my current loadouts require me to have multiple ranks of many cards.
---
I play with a group of people and most of us feel the same though I agree, it's much better with others.
---
It’s so easy to get caught up in the grind loop and not realize you’re not really having fun. If the game stops being fun, stop playing it. It’ll be here later with a wealth of new content.
---
I'll have to pay attention then and make sure that's the case. Thanks.
---
Queen can't become goops, but other enemies can, incl regular SB.
---
Same here, now I'll have to redo my build
---
Maybe the toilet will show up in the atom shop. I figure most of this stuff was likely made for the atom shop before the idea of seasons came around anyway, so whatever other stuff didn't get put in this season is probably going to show up there.
---
It's a cosmetic, it's job is to look nice.
---
Very cool, indeed! This sounds incredibly useful. Hope to get it for PlayStation soon!
---
You are wrong, for a lot of players it is the motive to keep them interested and log in every day.
---
It’s about playing with a new player though, it’s like watching your favorite movie with someone who’s never seen it. 
---
I realize this isn’t the easiest option. I ended up buying it for a friend so I could extend my enjoyment of the game.
---
You can get all the gum you need for a single challenge without even needing to leave the forest.  Morgantown high school, flatwoods funeral home, Camp McClintock and Tyler County fairgrounds just to name the ones I list off the top of my head.
---
This entire thread started with a discussion about people reporting to the mods that posts about Robert House violated the rules because he is not relevant to the game, with a Mod making a statement about that. 
---
Your first post referenced whether or not such reports were valid. 
---
&gt; *it is indeed not related to 76, so people are allowed to complain.*
---
[Reference Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfknkr/happy_birthday_to_one_of_the_most_important/fvygl8x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
Now you’re backpedaling.
---
Feel free to back off your first statement that the complaints were valid.  Once you do that, I’ll be glad to discuss the general and specific relevance of Robert House to the franchise and the games individually.
---
Oh I see what u mean now. Yea I guess of you like have all maxed cards you are kinda hosed...
---
Unfortunately some of the mods like "ultra light" overwrite that "sturdy/heavy" description, which is dumb as shit.
---
Oh never knew that random boys could spawn
---
If you watch them for a bit, you will see it's random fire. They know something is out there, but they don't know where exactly.
---
Not only do I have all maxed ranks, I have lvl 1, lvl2 and lvl3 of every card that I use often.  This crap is too confusing, my brain is smoking from just thinking of how I'll approach this.  The bonus for "Animated" cards makes this even more confusing.  I have about 12 perk packs and 60 level ups saved, but feel penalized for playing too much when it comes to this new level up system.
---
PA skin not discounted is 99% of the time 1600. least I checked 1500 is below 1600
---
I feel you.
---
I agree, this is may not be the reason I played but it was certainly the main reason I played often. 76 doesn't have many in game rewards worth having (for a variety of reasons, including the storage and weight limits) but the atoms and being able to buy what you want made up for that.
---
Weasel?
---
I've started seeing a lot of the same people over and over while server hopping to shop. Hopefully they do another free weekend soon to boost the player base again.
---
Yep.. login get my 150 script, do dailies (atoms and ward/radier) and log off til friends get on later.
---
They said progress on pts does not move to normal servers. My characters on pts are from may 28...
---
Beth saying 1 to 2 hrs per for regular gamer, suggests to me it will be quicker than that for the more hardcore player. I too worry about some time gate on doing the challenges. Seems to me to suggest daily and weekly challenges, that you can complete as fast as you can. After that we will have to grind public events for more score.
---
Pipe, assault, combat/Fixer, handmade, gauss, hunting, lever action, laser, plasma, telsa...Im sure I missed something, but we already have a bunch of weapons. All of the endgame weapons that you can buy with bullion are gauss. The pistol for pistol builds, shotgun for shotgun builds, gauss mini for heavy...and we already had the gauss rifle from day one. If anybody got screwed in this, I’d say it was the commandos out there.
---
On a private world, maybe.  Otherwise, only if someone else didn't beat you to it.
---
It's still a quite scarce item as Daily Challenge items go.
---
Lots
---
That may be the case on paper, but I don't get 2000, definitely not 2400 free atoms per month and I play everyday. I pay for 1st and have a hard time spending those atoms because most of the time the atomic shop items are crap. There may be one on sale item I want every couple of weeks. And like I said, the bundles usually have a cool item every now and then. 1 cool item, that you're forced to spend 1200 atoms on. I get the hesitation for change, but come on... it's not all gloom and doom. At least with seasons we can see what the rewards are, and I love so many of them. Finally a cool handmade skin, for free. TONS of cool camp items I can already see myself using. Multiple cool new power armor skins and a new one alltogether. Of course not every reward is great, but have you played nuclear winter? That grind sucked compared to this one, and it had great rewards at higher levels too, most of which I don't use. But it provided some incentive to diversive gameplay because who wouldn't want free stuff. Don't care if i'm in the minority on this, but I fully embrace a change to the challenges and appreciate them finally giving out so many cool items for free. Plus I'm an adult and can afford the occasional atoms if I'm hell bent on getting something I want, while still working towards cool, free rewards
---
I didn’t mean that, I meant my progress from the regular server hasn’t been properly updated on the PTS, the PTS is using an older version of my character.
---
Gotta clear out the backlog before Cyberpunk 2077 right :D
---
Yeah, the same for me sadly.
---
It's somewhere around an 8% drop if the dataminers are correct.  The issue is more that  nine times out of ten the event tends to go to shit because people can't follow instructions and it either falls short of the goal needed for the plan to drop or fails outright.
---
If allowed, I'll be sure to place them on any workshop I capture for people to use!
---
Nuh uh! Melee got it worst... Where is my gauss paint roller for one hand and gauss paint roller on a stick for two hand? 😂
---
Was hoping they would do a semi auto gauss rifle with auto mod(not a sniper rifle), or add a stock attachment to the pistol.
---
On the flip side, you get 6k caps, 600 scrip, and 250 bullion. I could care less about the caps, but I almost never buy anything from the shop so I'd rather have the scrip and bullion. You also get 30+ camp items and skins that would have previously been in the shop that you would have had to pay for.
---
Yet here you are.
---
Interesting.
---
I'm of the opinion that they should need to notify you, somehow, but I don't see any issue with spectating users; specifically for development purposes.
---
Anything beyond that can get sticky.
---
There are always players just want to farm or trade, and not roll their own, so the value of good drops will stay high. Mediocre drops however will hurt because people will quickly craft their own mediocre and shit drops lol But because the item is locked to character and also each character has only limited storage capacity, it’s not easy to craft several good rolls and save them for later. People will have to scrip them to make room. Later when they try a different build they will look for it in the market again.
---
What's soup got to do with it!?!
---
...bullion :D
---
Lmao yes it was just a light hearted way of telling how I’ve been fudged up into a paranoid wastelander I’ve met pretty good people as well don’t get me wrong
---
I'm not a fan of the space stuff, I like that they mixed some other stuff in there so there's something for everyone.
---
I find I can complete a daily in between every 'Hide, Seek, and Destroy' mission.
---
Today isn't my birthday but it will he in a few days!! so happy birthday to us all!!
---
Incorrect.  When the event released the dataminers went through to find the drop conditions and according to them the npcs have no role in the rewards, they're simply the failure condition.  The only  thing that effects the rewards is the amount of ore turned in before the timer ends, with the top tier being 75-100 ore.
---
There's like 6 different free PA skins scattered among the rewards that you don't have to pay for.
---
I like 2 weapon skins, the tree and 1 jet pack skin.  At least it will give me something to do while I farm the perfect weapon.
---
Also the ammo converter.  Really excited for that.  I would have paid bullion or atoms for that.
---
Commando is just better DPS, so you can kill sort of faster but you’re using more bullets in the end. Rifleman is slower but does more damage. At least that’s the basic difference
---
In boss fights, the commando is the way to go.  Because DPS.  But, for efficiency the rifleman is the way to go in almost every other scenario.  You'll save tons of ammo.  Luckily, you can have a build that will work for both pretty well, but it is hard to maximize either role.  Fortunately, I've never needed absolute max damage so it works fine for me. I hit for 2-3k  in rifleman mode, and about 1500-2k in commando mode (Bloodied/nerd rage/adrenaline/sneak/headshots etc) and you need adrenal reaction and speed demon for this build to work right.
---
I like the Fixer in Commando, and the Railway or Lever in Rifleman mode.
---
Edit:  I run a QOL/Defensive loadout, because I like to survive and carry lots of unnecessary aid and ammo.  Here is what I am currently running.  Mine is very similar to what Angry Turtle does and is extremely tanky.  If you want more damage, this point structure allows for you to remove defense and add more offense.  It also works fine for shotguns.
---

100000٪ agree. We want Weasel!
---
So...how am I incorrect? You just stated what I already said. Tier 3 or 4 (75 or 100) ore get you rewards.
---
It's my 30th birthday today! Birthday twins
---
I’m a commando build and have been since they nerfed the TSEs.  I had a sweet AAE combat shotgun for my first 100 levels or so respec’d to auto rifle build as it is so versatile.  You can use handmades, combat rifles, railway rifles, etc.  As long as they are automatic it works.
---
I’d say just level both perk sets all the way and switch them out whenever you want. But I personally like commando for the DPS. It’s just a lot worse for ammo conservation. Rifleman seems to be better for VAT’s as well. Just because automatic weapons will eat through your AP. But grim reapers sprint helps with that.
---
Hey, get out of my head! GO!
---
50 is the minimum available per day, and you often got 60 or 70. Similarly, there were weeklies with more than 150.
---
This sounds like me two months ago when I first rolled a good bloodied fixer. I cannot think of any disadvantages other than more ammo consumption for the automatic, but there are definitely advantages to commando that make up for using more ammo. Such as commando kills stuff quicker for enemies than cannot be one shot with rifleman. I used to about crap my pants when my old lever action didn’t one shot kill enemy and I was left trying to reload. Not any more, and my life has changed for the better once I started running a commando build.
---
Me 5!
---
Not basically, but quite literally.
---
Who the fuck would spend money on those shitty rewards lol. If there is nothing more im gonna settle for the converter
---
Happy birthday, welcome to the big 30 club
---
which are not really good (imo) and it's the same skin just over all the different types. 
---
with the cosmos one being a different skin.
---
There’s another vendor bot spawn near white powder sports, you can also search YouTube for some server hopping guides that can make it easier
---
If only there were thousands of other games you could play instead.
---
Thanks! I didnt know that!
---
You rock! Ill seek you out soon.
---
Maxed Raider has 1 thing for rifle builds, sorta.
---
So what you're saying is that there's lunchboxes in all the Bethesda iterations of Fallout.
---
First of all, you don’t need to be rude. Second, from reading the Q&amp;A, it’s implied they might be added to the atomic shop.
---
The entire point of the cripple strategy is that essentially anyone can do it because it doesn't require a dedicated shotgun build.  All it takes is any shotgun, a ranked up Enforcer perk and aiming for the legs.  
---
The point of not just one shoting the ghouls is because all you're doing is instantly respawning them elsewhere.  If you're short on people you run the risk of the ghoul popping up in a tunnel no one is covering and then rushing straight for the npcs.
---
Also the pumpkin house will sometimes spawn them.
---
The format lends itself to a certain type of player to play often, yes. Also, the quarantine has probably boosted both the gross time and secondary sources of flow-state-inertia-gain time (so an effect that potentiates alongside exposure [or a logarithmic relationship]), allowing for said players - players such as yourself my good man - to play more. I just think that might be more the vault-tech doing its work? I have been kinda miserable the whole time in not the fun way. I really like to be alone sometimes and not having that option for awhile was really disturbing. Anxiety provoking, and a little bit like operant conditioning. I just feel very fucked-with in a lot of sly nasty ways by this game, like did the russians and the chinese front the cash or something? Can I get more meta? should I mix more metaphors? I'm pretty sure Todd is a spook.
---
The long awaited boxes 😅
---
Just mudstomp it right through the sink drain and then rinse.
---
Sweet loots!
---
It doesn’t matter who gives a fuck to the atoms, it’s about you and I are all going to have a net loss of atoms in the upcoming system. Imagine atoms are IRL cash, you can decide what you want to spend on. Now I will give you random stuff for your work instead of cash, you may or may not like the random stuff. You see the difference now?
---
If you need fuel, you can just server hop at a place like Bloody Franks in the Mire or Sacrament in Savage Divide. There’s always a cultist Mothman or Raider who carries 100 fuel. Sacrament would be easier though since there’s less climbing and killing to do.
---
&gt; Second, from reading the Q&amp;A, it’s implied they might be added to the atomic
---
...and? Who the fuck cares? If you can earn them in game is's not like it's pay to win, just like the repair kits you get from the queen are better than the ones you can buy in the shop.
---
Yeah I guess I got lucky then. Ran it a few times now and the first time everyone got involved and we got to 4/4, the second time was me and 2 others and got 3/4 and every other time has been everyone just shooting ghouls.
---
Something is wrong if every piece takes minutes, I was rebuilding my camp yesterday and 2 times it completely lagged, for about 30 sec or more, I wasn't available to do anything, also alt+f4 was locked, but almost all the time worked fine.
---
Yup, the wiki also states this, that you need to be lvl 25 for it to appear in Vendors.
---
Do you have a lot of stuff still blueprinted under the stored tab? You may want to try scrapping a lot of stuff, then just newly build it, instead of using stored items.
---
Happy Early Birthday!
---
Where is my Gauss explosive flail?!?!
---
That's not the case on paper. That's the reality of the current game as opposed to the new system. Now you may not seek to get those Atoms, but they aren't a figment of my imagination. There's also nothing stopping Bethesda from putting these Season Items into the game which you could then buy with you 6000+ FOR FREE Atoms. You're being robbed of choice and you think you're being given a benefit.
---
I craft cheap flamers to get fuel, but thanks the tip, will check this :)
---
Am I missing something? What is this post about?
---
It's more nuanced than that, dude.
---
I only recently setup camp and started building some I'm pretty excited for a lot of the random camp items
---
Eh, they are always looking for more of our "loot" though.
---
We *could* just stop giving it to them...
---
I have the most fun on my unmutated junkies non power armor heavy gunner lvl191. If having extra lvl ups saved them my wife's got like 500, lol. She sees me have to scroll forever through cards to swap them out and decided a long time ago not to just buy cards. I just wanted to know what lvl you had to be to get all of them
---
Yeah but you cant NOW till June 14th
---
My first comment literally states that it's weird to complain, lol, so how am i backpedaling? I have constantly made it clear that i don't see a reason to complain, but that it's fair to do so since the character is indeed not relevant to 76 as a game. What the mods does with the complains is none of my business, i simply state that the character ain't as relevant as people make him seem.
---
Heres the thing tho: using mods as an argument is simply bad. There are plenty of examples where mods allow posts that should not be allowed, it's not that uncommon on reddit tbh. Especially a case like this is hard to judge, because the character is both relevant and irrelevant, depending on how you look at it. I mean i can't deny he's a big part of the franchise, and some could argue that that's enough, but that's a matter of opinion. 
---
Being a relevant topic on a subreddit does not mean the character is actually relevant in the game tho.
---
That's a great idea been wondering how to find out what I'm missing I will wait for the Xbox one thanks for doing this
---
You must have some armor with rad resist. I get 13 or 15 each time.
---
I gave up trying to farm it and just ended up buying the plan, which in itself was a whole different pain in the ass because it's not something you often find sitting in a vendor and the trade sub has everyone convinced that the thing is worth anywhere from 30k-60k caps.
---
I wonder how the strip is doing during fo4
---
Wow. I would have never thought of that. I have an explosive harpoon gun that I’m going to start stockpiling on harpoons with this weekend. 
---
Alternatively, you could do the same with railroad spikes if you have an explosive railway rifle since it works similarly as the harpoon gun flechette mod.
---
But people wouldn't pay for them unless they wanted them. And if you don't  it's dead weight.
---
Thats not the way bethesda looks at it because they put a lot of work into creating all this, and that's understandable. But if the player doesn't want it the player doesn't want it.
---
Awesome camp! How does fast travelling to it work?
---
Hey pull my finger kid , TOO LATE
---
Soon the real faction wars will begin...
---
Those who wear the Mr. Pebbles backpack vs those who wear the Jangles Backpack.
---
Who knows, im terrible with the timeline. Is fallout 4 before or after new vegas?
---
I feel ya man. Coming from a designer point of view it’s killing me. Because I like my options of design
---
I do both.  When doing normal stuff and low events I stay with my rifleman perks. 
---
When I do endgame events ( PP, RR, ENCRYPTED, SBQ ) I switch to my commando cards.
---
I wish you were right - earning Atoms alongside getting progress towards the Season would be fantastic! BUT, unfortunately, the FAQ on their Seasons page has a question, "If Daily and Weekly challenges no longer award Atoms...", which seems to be pretty clear - they'll only give SCORE now. :/
---
Looks dope.
---
Really motivated to play F76 when this goes live!
---
My mistake then, when I see people reference #/4 in regards to the event it's always talking about the surviving npcs.
---
My mistake then, when I see people reference #/4 in regards to the event it's always talking about the surviving npcs and not the ore intervals.
---
Send me a friend request if you want to team up for some of the weekly atom challenges, I need to do 10 events or quests while teamed up this week. I’m a high level player, mostly a lone wanderer, and still need help sometimes for the team events. PS4 name is same as my reddit username. Please mention reddit team in friend request.
---
I dunno what's wrong with your reading skills, but I guess you never saw the datamine.
---
The leaked lunchboxes are not just in game models or simple items you suggested, but with sth like pop up effects, icons and shit, making it looks like some micro-transaction box/package thingy, just like those in Fallout Shelter.
---
Being forced to play NW for the ghillie suit was the worst experience ever. I normally dislike BR’s and on ps4 it’s absolutely hideous. 
---
I really do hope that’s not what’s gonna happen as well.
---
I'm level 101 and I've still never seen a behemoth. Where do they spawn?
---
Atoms aren’t that easy to get end game. Not for me anyway. It’s easy for some people but I also gotta balance real life into the whole thing as well
---
I agree. Just use the blue suitcases near the NPC vendors (in the train stations) to drop off what you don't need and take what you can use. I do this for junk too. If everyone did this there would be free ammo on the regular.
---
I've definitely had two at once before.
---
I would spend the ammout there asking for. It’s the rank 5 reward, meaning most people should get it within 5-10 hours of gameplay.
---
Who is he?
---
That’s smart. I already always swap out my sneak with Dodgy and Evasive and a few others when it’s non End Game, I’ll try that. We need load outs already!
---
They should really just make us able to toggle between them ourselves so we wouldn’t have to ask for this all the time.
---
&gt;better not see those lunchboxes and supply packs outside of the seasons.
---
*"The rewards are limited during a Season to the players who earn them through progression, and we are exploring other ways we may make certain rewards available in the future."*
---
😬😬😬
---
i’ll buy it for 2k presents
---
Finally, a use for .38 and 40mm grenades
---
Ah, I was thinking your family might still have the quilts around for you to get pics of, but I'd bet there are probably a few quilt museums in WV they could probably hit up on their next research trips
---
I’m just in for the design so little props don’t faze me and the moth man stuff didn’t really look that good with any of my builds unless my whole build was just about mothman
---
I must have missed that.  No skin off my back thus far.
---
Out of the 100 ranks, there are only TWO I seriously want (4 and 5), and one I'd sorta like (59) - the rest are all junk I'll never use. And sure, I'll be getting this stuff for free doing things I was doing anyway... but that is -instead of- getting Atoms that I could save up for things I'd -actually use-.
---
Of actualy being used....
---
Funny how mods left this comment alone but removed dozens of other comments discussing whether it was appropriate for a child under the age of 10 to be playing an M-rated game...

---
What platform? I can probably come throw down a lot for you to move around with.
---
Your first statement might say it’s ‘weird’ to complain but also that it’s technically legitimate.  And that was in a sub thread where a mod already said the complaints were *not* legitimate. 
---
And you seem to have also missed parts of Wastelanders where he is mentioned even more, and not just as an ‘Easter Egg’. 
---
Maxson isn’t in the game directly either. But he is relevant. 
---
House isn’t in the game either. But he’s relevant. 
---
RobCo has just as much relevance to FO76 as the BoS.
---
Hell, you have to deal with the RobCo research facility just to do the Settlers part of the vault raid prep. Why is that facility there?  Because House put it there. 
---
Your issue is that you think that because House was an integral part of FO:NV that for him to be relevant to a game he is to have that same level of presence or influence. 
---
He doesn’t. Relevance simply means that their existence has an influence on the background, setting and story of the game. And he qualifies for all three. 
---
**Direct question**:  is Roger Maxson a relevant character to FO76, and if so, why?
---
Just did! :)
---
Light footed only applies while crouched. If you activate furniture to get through a wall you're not considered crouched while using the furniture. Simple solution is don't use furniture at other people's camps.
---
Take your damn upvote for "Fallout Crush Saga"
---
Im on ps4 but I'm not sure you can, seeing how it was atom shop
---
It's not rare at all.
---
White dirty/Withered, White Clean, Brown, Blue, Green, Pink. Yellow, Forest, Red.
---
 That's the general order. Pink and above are generally the only ones sought after.
---
From the spread of items it looks like they tried to get a little bit of everything so just about everyone should see something they like.
---
The ammo station?
---
This sounds like a blast
---
Ammo Converter!
---
It looks nice
---
Fo4 us set Waaaaaaaaayyyyy later then NV like a few hundred years
---
Gotta put out that daily content with the same title as last week!
---
The truth is they have no plans for PvP updates atm.
---
I mean look at the game, even in PvE there are so many essential features missing, what do you expect?
---
IT should have functioned like all the other fucking armor in the game and allowed you to wear whatever you want on top of it, but nooooo....
---
I do. Over 100 currently.
---
I agree, no weapons for rifleman.  It's a blessing, and rifleman can end their gold grind sooner than everyone else.
---
Thank you~ This is exactly the information I was looking for.
---
I love the story of New Vegas, such an interesting region and the day the bombs fell must have been a sight to behold. 
---
I also just love that while we're all so preoccupied in Appalachia the events leading up to the other games are unfolding elsewhere.
---
If you take a workshop, you are signing an agreement agreeing to PvP, end of story.
---
And, no witch hunting is allowed here.
---
Thanks for the reply! I've actually been fighting this for a couple days, so I've been logged out for over 12 hours a couple times now.
---
Supposedly the conversion rates for the ammo aren't great.
---
Cool. I play a lot so will probably be active after I get off work tonight. I’ll look for you then!
---
Witch-hunting isn’t cool, either.
---
Workshop = PvP.
---
How did you not know this by lvl 104?
---
So to use the ghillie you must have the suit? Or is it a skin?
---
I’m glad you posted this because I hadn’t checked the website in a while, only 5 more days for some new content yeeee!!!!!! I want that ammo converter
---
Use light footed perk and fireproof rank 3, stay crouched, don't use furniture (because it disables light footed while using furniture animations) and carry explosive bait with you. If they trap you inside punji walls you can drop explosive bait repeatedly to destroy them to get out, because you can't fast travel while taking damage. You also won't get wanted for destroying their traps with the bait.
---
It's like spy vs spy.
---
If they place rad emitters you can also use bait to destroy them unless you're bloodied and have really poor rad resistance.
---
There’s something to that. On a private server there’s always at least 10 gutsys per wave.
---
I have close to 20k, because of purchasing discounted camp bundles. Probably would have more if for a mistake in power armor skins purchase. Non of my four characters use power armor.
---
I wouldn't want her as an Ally but as someone who can give us dailies, sure. Or even someone we can just run into in the wastes. Jen, Penny, Paige all could give quests. They're basically wasted after their questlines are played out.
---
Welcome to r/FO76.
---
Being a high level character, that “level up while...” challenge is rarely getting completed, so that’s less atoms already. I get maybe 1500 a month if I’m grinding them daily. That’s enough to buy what? One power armor skin? Or a camp bundle with only one item I want and a sign that’s on sale? You call that “choice”? I’d rather know what items I can get (which I love the ones they’re including in seasons), and just work towards them while playing the game. Weighing options, for me, is more looking at what they’re offering for free and thinking about how they would monetize all that in the atomic shop. This is WAAAAAAY better than just the skin for the PA towards the end being a full 1800 atoms, which it would be. Or the playground thing being the one decent item in a bundle that would cost 1200-1500 atoms. Or just the black and red handmade skin which would be at least 500-700 atoms.
---
Oh ok. I wonder what ending is canon
---
They're armor skins. So you need the armor for the particular skin.
---
That’s very strange. Normally I don’t have an issue with glitches after logging back on. You may have to send a report about it to Bethesda, but that’s just an option.

Four leaf clover is great for building crits. **Also lower the weapon weight the less ap each vats shot hits**. Also agility is the root stat for calculating AP pool. And Luck determines how quickly crit meter fills."
---
This guy is wrong?
---
They will not be pay to win anymore lol , they'll be fap to win
---
Pretty much don't care myself since I rarely spend them.
---
There really isn’t much for rifleman/commando builds with Wastelanders, at least in terms of weaponry.  We do have the fixer, which is still hands down one of the most desirable weapons in the game.  I’m guessing BGS wasn’t ready to bump that gun off the top of the heap just yet.
---
The ammo machine is ok, but slow.  Garden plots are alright.  Bows are pretty awful in my opinion.  Secret Service and Thorn armor are really the only things I’m interested in.  
---
Don’t worry, building a decent full suit of either is enough of a grind to last you for quite a while.  Thorn, especially.  150 scrip gets you one roll.
---
95% of the player base doesn't give a hoot about PvP, so they probably have zero reason to "fix" it. Also, the gun play and weapon balance in this game is hot garbage, so if I want PvP I'll go play a game that was actually designed for it.
---
goes live next week. I think they said you can get to it from either the main menu or the menu on the map screen in game.
---
I was just making a bad joke but that would be cool, I wonder if the engine could even handle animating a flail
---
100% agreed. In fact, I'd love if they'd just suck it up and go all the way to implement a full-fledged transmog system - I've never used any of the underarmors from the Shop because they're always in the Casual mod group for some reason... and I'd -love- a plain black paint for Combat Armor, but why would I ever spend money on it if I'll just be switching to Secret Service armor soon?
---
I stay rifleman. Commando still won’t out do heavies so I see it as pointless outside of a few rare instances where there is no heavy gunner. I get my hits in on queen than clear enemies from the DPS guys so they can stay on her.
---
Meh, the ammo machine we already have is basically worthless too, but it's free. Anything we get from the converter is an improvement over just dropping shit on the ground.
---
Oh man, I'm just a chem-dealing mutant-gouhl no-automics ranged rifle/pistol switch (1s15p1r15a13l base), I romanced both Beckett and the Commander, I gave bullion to both sides, joined all factions and quietly subverted their plots for domination - for the good of the realm. Made a special serum with my know-how from frogstuffs and high radiation fluids, ultra, nucwaste, ... you can see the rest on display (I dont display the nuka-Q, the secret ingredient). Anyways, it keeps me from turnin like my folks and friends. See my shop sometime at the Federal Disposal site, not sure about those BoS guys - they usually make with the pew pew and ask questions never!
---
1600h in says the same for me also. With a job and 3 kids when am i supposed to hunt gear if i got to take pictures of a fapping super mutant in a nukezone while wearing a clownsuit
---
Looking at my stash and the data mined limmit I will spend maybee three days getting it and then 2 weeks grinding up old ammo, less if I mule my main ammo stash over to alts  so yay inventory space.   
---
what. I may be a hoarder but I use my hord.
---
I don't really care at all, and tbh they were giving too much atoms.
---
Just remember the Atom Shop items aren't included in the price tag, and if you want compensation, there are already in some countries, sue the game if you'd like to.
---
I met this guy as well!
---
I was playing with my level 18 account, did the leader of the pack event to get some legendarys, but this guy, came and ran in Front of my bullets, so that he can kill me. He spawn trapped me then vor a few minutes, until i had enough time to activate pacifist mode.
---
You probably already know about Keretus' Perk Loadout Manager, but I thought I'd throw that out there.
---
Been here since day 1, it’s just sad to see that it’s still par for the course every single day
---
Does the thorn armor need vault steel and legendary modules? 150 scrip is a lot for one roll
---
This is exceedingly helpful information, even after playing for over 300 hours
---
Really wish the PvP groupies would hang it up, this game engine DOES NOT support it
---
I used to turn in the candy because at 5k Halloween candies you get a random legendary weapon or armor, but now I only save them for the atoms because my RNG can be trash sometimes. Also, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a few legendary ghouls, which is always a plus.
---
I don’t mind, I’ll probably get more than I do now since I don’t pay attention to the current challenges.
---
Everytime she attacks your CAMP? Shit you must have pissed her off, did you kill all the birds or dig out all the dirt?
---
I sware I’ve checked like 300 times and this is the first blue I’ve gotten if I’m lucky I’ll find a brown or Green

Edit: of course I find another blue one b2b while typing that comment
---
This was on the q and a page of the season website they put up today.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks!
---
Say... sorta related question: what happens to the challenges after you hit rank 100 or the season ends? Will they go back to giving Atoms... or just keep giving SCORE, even though you've maxed that out?
---
Tbh, i can't say much about Roger, can't remember where he's mentioned, but if it's like house, then sure, he's as irrelevant a character to the game.
---
Here's the thing.. A character like house is not relevant, but what he has done is. Talking about that stuff on 76 subreddit makes perfect sense, because then the focus ain't on house. House is simply not relevant as an individual character in 76, he is just mentioned either as an easter egg, or as a way to make the lore fit a bit better. He changes nothing, and means nothing, to the gameplay or story. He's just there.
---
They were, but at the same time they were holding all the good stuff for when they can turn profit, and this is not speculation, you will slowly start seeing amazing &amp; high quality items hitting the store soon after the update. Then perhaps you and others will care. I expect most will, since most people that are still playing this game are into CAMP building.  
---
I wouldn't mind a reduction, but this goes too far, at least in my opinion.
---
But you see, the 30+ camp items and skins are stuff you may or may not like. The 6k caps, 600 scrips, 250 gold could be obtained in 4 days. Atoms are like cash, you have control on what you pay for.
---
"Most of the time the atomic shop items are crap" but the score items are all awesome. 
---
Yeah, not knocking you or your taste but lets see how long that lasts. The way you explain it, its like you think the same company that made crap items for the shop is suddenly going to produce fantastic stuff for the score system.
---
I rarely have spent much time chasing the challenges, so it doesn't make a difference to me. I just buy atoms when I find something I really want. I think I'll actually work on getting the unlocks for this, so it's a positive for me.
---
However, I know I'm likely in the minority in this, so hopefully it doesn't end up burning the folks who work for there atoms too badly.
---
Ultimately any game as a service requires cash flow, so I'm happy to support it while I'm having fun, and I'll stop subbing to F1st and buying atoms when I stop having fun.
---
Damm, fuck it then i guess
---
Thanks for clearing it up
---
I actually had no idea, yet alone that we could mod FO76. I’ll definitely check it out
---
Yes, and give us a personal quest to change her voice.
---
Every time she appears.
---
100% Unofficial but not really, response
---
We have a plan for the game and our only focus is on sticking to that plan. Anything that breaks or has an unintended effect is ignored. We aren't trained on fixing things only creating things. 
---
PvP was replaced by NW that is all you need to know and should have figured out by now. PvP is what it is and all it will ever be again. The focus is on Seasons, BOS and a pathetic legendary perk system that makes no sense and isn't worth our efforts and thats going to take a few more months and quite frankly might not even drop this year, but that won't stop us from disappointing you with it. So maybe in another year, once the plan is fulfilled than we might stop to consider thinking about ~~fixing or~~ adding things that our ever shrinking base actually wants.
---
Yup, I consistently end up with more harpoons than I spend with my Flechette Harpoon gun.
---
Oh sweet revenge✊
---
For lvl 100 or converter?
---
I love his mod vids and his weekly vid, but his almost daily content... there just isnt enough content in FO76 to make a &gt;10 min video daily.
---
The main vanilla game has a huge variety of good rifles as is.
---
I am happy about this, but I will say I would prefer to have been able to junk ammo and rebuild.  
---
I’m sure there is a good reason they are doing it this way so as to not give any one ammo type an unreasonable advantage.
---
Looking forward to the season!
---
Still don't care, I got first anyway, just wait for discounts if you cannot buy it the first time, it's like any other merch, don't be too attached.
---
It's not about the total rewards, it's about how much a person cares about each reward and whether the rewards are worth the grind effort to get them. 
---
I don't care about loot crates, perk packs, caps, scrip, or reskins, so in the end it's pretty underwhelming for me too. Imagine grinding for a few hundred hours doing things we've been doing for 1.5 years, or paying upwards of $200 CAD, just to get about 1/3 of the rewards you've mentioned. Pretty bad.
---
there's only one guaranteed spawn in the pond down the road from solomon's pond. so nowhere near a mutant hounds roaming range
---
I dunno, try removing and then rebuild your turrets.
---
Maybe (Hopefully) because I tried to focus on the quantifying and light hearted take on addiction instead of the Violence aspect
---
I'm glad you're having fun, I do too, but at the same time I am encountering bugs on a daily basis, bugs that have existed since time immemorial, for now I am being patient with the company, but patience has its limits.
---
I kind of want Brenda from Camden as an ally.
---
Wise words 👍
---
In the AmA a couple of months (?) back, they flat-out ignored any questions on PvP.
---
Two random encounter vendors have a chance to sell it.  One is a Responder protectron that has a few spawn points in the forest region, which are easy enough to find with a quick search, and the roving Settler trader may have it.  He/she will sometimes show up at your camp or you might find them while out and about.
---
You can shoot corpses and then loot them again....
---
Yea the game is enjoyable I mainly said rose is fine based off I did enjoy how they had all these little separate raider faction with their own style I liked that even though the missions were bland...What it boils down for me is the version of raider we got is weak sauce I find them annoying as hell except for rocksy
---
My story if when I got scammed is that I really wanted a old man winter mask and was going to trade a full sute of ultracite power armour and when I dropped the chassis the guy picked it up and left
---
Well you don't have to do it.
---
I can have an actual bathroom
---
I just sold a blue to the vendor bot because no one was buying it for 100 caps in my vending machine
---
Fairly sure they're all FO1st rewards, not part of that bundle.
---
Why would you want to talk about it?  The scammers probably watch for posts of people they have scammed?  Probably the same with trap camp people.  
---
Don't give them the satisfaction of telling the story so they can enjoy what happened further.
---
Ha
---
sResourceArchive2List = **PerkLoadoutManager.ba2**
---
sResourceIndexFileList = SeventySix - Textures01.ba2, SeventySix - Textures02.ba2, SeventySix - Textures03.ba2, SeventySix - Textures04.ba2, SeventySix - Textures05.ba2, SeventySix - Textures06.ba2, Main.ba2
---
This is how I have mine set up. Make sure the ba2 file is on the sResourceArchive2list line. Also did you download SFE and install that as well? PLM needs it to work. Search SFE on the site you got PLM.
---
Not to thrilled on the surface.  12 weeks of atoms is 600-700 a week, so 7200 to 8400.  Cosmetics aren’t too bad.  Worth the atoms lost?  I’d say so to me personally, but everyone is going to have differing views on that.  Also depends on what shows on the shop in the next 12 weeks.
---
How quick ranking up actually is will be the concern.  If I can rank up decently on weekends and not hit daily progression walls, I’ll be ok with it.  
---
150 atoms a rank is absurd.  Perhaps it’s good so they can drop it to 100 with feedback because they’ll never be able to go above that without a lot of rage.
---
How is this our problem? 
---
"Giving us too many", you realize Atoms are a digital currency that cost Bethesda nothing to create right? Maybe the real problem is if Bethesda wants more people to buy and use Atoms, they should add more things people might like instead of a bunch of crap that most people probably don't want?
---
By the sound of the way things are being changed, we're getting fewer Atoms, but we get mixed-bag 'freebies' that are still mostly a bunch of crap I probably won't use or care for.  Who knows if their actual Atomic Shop system will improve as a result.
---
Im fixing to start stashing ammo onto a mule. Will it take mini nukes and missles?
---
Lol okay ... but your seriously telling me you think the raider faction we got does it justice?
---
Nice!!!
---
Well Daggerfall could but I don’t have any trust that Beth could haha!
---
I was making a bad joke too haha!
---
Just so you know, I double checked and I do have the suppressor for the combat rifle:)
---
Great idea friend. Hope someone could do his on ps4.
---
Absolutely, a lot of us are switching to the SS armor and outfits are the way to go since some of us are still rolling to get a full set. Either way, the SS armor covers 99% of underarmors and it's a waste of atom points. Also, in my opinion, the SS armor is kinda ugly, but that's another topic lol (maybe future paints will make it look better)
---
Agreed, the bugs get tiring, I quit in mid 2019 and only recently came back for Wastelanders. When the bugs/lack of content get to me again, I'll go play something else again. Right now most things are filler until things like Cyberpunk hit later this year.
---
I do hope they can fix more of the deep engine bugs, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
With a three rank armorer card, it requires 10 vault steel and one module.  It is a lot.  I guess BGS figures that a guaranteed three star roll plus the set bonus makes it 3x more valuable than secret service, or they were too lazy to adjust the cost.
---
Your custom ini doesn't need so much info, should read like this,
---
\[Archive\]
---
sResourceArchive2List =  PerkLoadoutManager.ba2
---
Also,  do you have SFE installed..?
---
You change it in the atom shop, just select the one you want, you’ll notice your current skin will show a check mark.
---
Don't care.  I don't live according to the atom shop.
---
The tents is changed in the 1st section of the shop and you have to than re-place your tent in the world for it to take effect. The skin in the content pack is for your actually Camp device and not for the tent itself.
---
THIS\^\^
---
Except the part about playing a game designed for it.  I am not a fan of PVP so I will just stick with my enjoyment of PVE.
---
I admit the ammo converter will be nice to have but at level 310 I am done grinding once I get 400 more gold script to get my Secret Service armor.  I have never paid much attention to daily and weekly challenges for atoms and will not worry much about tracking the seasons either.
---
The fact that you can stay locked into the head of the queen in VATS with a fixer for much longer makes the race closer than you think, but admittedly if you have good aim the Bloodied LMG still hits her way harder and holds much more ammo.  I'm ignoring glitched/legacy weapons though.  Those do crazy damage.
---
Oh God, Daggerfall... That's a flash back! I was so bad at it, but I spent many sleepless nights exploring.
---
That’s extremely kind of you, thank you!! I’m Xierg7 in game. A 1* HM would be amazing :)
---
We are now making 3* as less atoms, oh boy I wouldn’t be surprised if stuff in the shop got more expensive
---
As a fan of Mr. Fuzzy (Proud wearer of his Divine Garment) I agree with you.
---
There are multiple motherlodes. The one you save at Hornwright HQ and dies in the Settlers questline is just one of them.
---
If you do not care why are you commenting??
---
Most people do not have the time to grind or luxury to spend money on cosmetic items. Poverty is a real thing that affects millions.
---
You are just vapid and selfish and clearly “do not care” about your fellow players.
---
What is your level? Almost sounds like someone stole your stuff.
---
I'm not denying that the game could use a lot of work. I am simply putting down my opinion on why Bethesda would have created the respec system it currently has.
---
I suppose that there are many players that would retain interest if they could respec easily as opposed to creating a different character with a different style, set of skills, personality, and story. From what I have read in the various YouTube, Reddit, and forum posts is that the end game gets kind of boring. I am unsure how finessing the build would improve that? Now, if the new content I see coming truly does have bosses with fights that require teamwork and utilizing a mechanic, rather than just spray and pray, I can see how adjusting a build to fit the various roles might be good.

Fallout fandom is usually pretty good but they get toxic as fuck in the larger gathering spots online like the parent fallout sub reddit. You will still find people needlessly shitting on 76 and now somehow praising 4 (they LOATHED it when it was released). Even New Vegas and 3 were hot garbage on launch but no one remembers somehow.
---
We're like goldfish and forget most Fallout games are terrible on release and get cleaned up after a bunch of patches. Then after they're polished they get treated as works of art and we move on to shitting on the next new one.
---
Yeah but we get 3x less atoms now, if they don’t reduce prices in the shop, then you aren’t going to be able to earn your shop items anymore
---
Atoms mean almost nothing to me unfortunately. I'm just not the target market for them as cosmetic and camp stuff don't add much to the game for me. That said I do occasionally go out of my way to complete the atom challenges so I have around 13k stockpiled for free and maybe used less than 300 so far in total.
---
I'll give the first season my all and try to unlock all 100 levels, but it feels too much like this whole game is just designed to keep us hamsters on our wheel churning slowly through the same activities each day. If the season feels like a drag I'll probably take a good long break after it's over.
---
I can find any :(  Just have a level 50 fixer...
---
Um, the title says, "how do you feel?"
---
And again, the cosmetics are merchs, don't be greedy. If you can't, just don't.
---
And, if you are that poor might as well find more ways of earning money instead of playing games.
---
Wow there's so much to unpack here that I'm not going to teach you how simple economics work.  Have fun.
---
Then that's a shit motive. A constant reward stream like seasons actually makes me want to play the game again for more than 5 minutes a day.
---
Jeez, they dont sound exciting then.
---
Hmm at this level I doubt anyone would steal your stuff, idk, try sending a ticket?
---
Edit: And I am sure someone around would happily help.
---
No clue. No link either.
---
THIS!
---
Hmmm alright, I will. Thanks for the quick response!
---
Literally what's the point of doing that? You aren't playing the game. What are you grinding atoms **for**?
---
You mean July 14. But otherwise, that's correct. you also can't unlock them at all until June 30 :)
---
The content that is in between the filler items is usually what you buy/take part in the pass for. This pass seems no different. Some cool stuff at least imo
---
Can't the same be said about every single mmorpg out there? It's a sad reality.
---
I literally do not care about atoms.
---
Also, I'm pretty sure they would shoot me just for my Vtec Goodeye (tm) even if I could get em past the glowing and the jumping. I can't give it up, lost my old one to a deathclaw back in the early days after the bombs. I know she looks bad, but - Appalachia coulda been alot worse, I seen her through sum't
---
Weasel is hawt. Plus yeah companion all the way
---
Nope because i am a college man
---
am i interpreting this right? you have literally 1 character that has every plan on it, and i can figure out what im missing by scrolling through the inventory?
---
There's a bridge with a hole in the top of it just to the north of Harpers Ferry. Decent amount of space.
---
It is set 6 years later...?
---
And yet I saw people complaining in his comments yesterday because he did a cyberpunk video. YT people are morons.
---
No. You aren't forced to buy them.
---
&gt;I would feel less guilty for spending more money on this game.
---
Blaming everyone else on your addiction. Nobody is forcing you to be bad with your own money.
---
For me no. I have 750 hrs in 2 months, but I'm now faced with nothing to do anymore. It was worth the price, I will say that.
---
I have SFE.
---
No human NPC in the game prior to Wastelanders was a relevant character by your logic because they were not active while we played the game. 
---
So prior to Wastelanders, who was relevant to FO76?  You never encounter the Overseer; you only encounter her recordings and what she’s done. There is no direct interaction with her. So by your standard, she wasn’t a relevant character in FO76. 
---
Same for Taggerdy. Same for Thorpe. Same for every single character that you never directly see or interact with while they are alive and functional. 
---
Hell, Thorpe was more technically more relevant than the Overseer because you actually could encounter him (Scorched version) pre-Wastelanders. 
---
Your argument boils down to ‘if they aren’t physically in the game then they aren’t relevant’. And that’s simply a faulty definition.  
---
**Final point in the coffin:** If you don’t remember much about ***Roger Maxson***, then your opinion on the game is impaired by your severe lack of knowledge. If you don’t remember when or how Roger Maxson was referenced, then you’re not familiar enough with the game to have an educated opinion on what is or is not relevant.
---
Yup 👍 by far the best thing added
---
Daguerre is the one who fights her hence why IMO ATHENA should be removed and/or able to be killed.
---
Wait, really?
---
Weird flex but OK
---
I enjoyed it, he yammers on a bit to make the content threshold and i keep wanting to scream 'USE WORLD TIME BUDDY' at him but the content was pretty good.
---
I think it doesn't work as long as you are in a team.
---
No one is responding to that element of what you said, you walnut. It's your weird estrogen comment that outs you as a neckbeard.
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - 500 caps
---
Brown - 1k
---
Blue - 3k
---
Green - 5k
---
Pink - 10k+
---
Yellow - 12k+
---
Forest -  20k+
---
Red - trade only. Easily 150k. Saw people bidding 200k+ on one before.
---
I think they need to implement a system where if another player takes your bag, it displays their GT and marks them as want to your specific player Why can I drop this bag but not go get it back?? Half the time they stay passive or idk who even took it because it took two whole damn minutes to fast travel back from vault 76... Not completely related to OP but still.
---
Dafaq lmao, she must hate Athena. Just change your companion for now, others give similar quests anyway.
---
Is Godd Howard holding a gun to your head and forcing you to buy atoms?
---
Angry turtle came out with a video recently testing ap regen, worth the watch.
---
Items return to the shop regularly and often with a discount. Every Tuesday, you see what you can work toward. They don't ever miss an Atomic shop update. I knew full well that the glow-in-the-dark map was on sale at a 50% discount and had only been that way once before in 2019 because ... spoiler alert ... Google.  I also have a high level character and play with other high level characters. I complete that "level up while..." challenge daily. You say that you're an adult, but maybe you're just a young and naive one. And if you can't figure out how to speed through the dailies and weeklies, maybe you play alone or are just a dumb one. If it's the latter then you deserve this.
---
Commando and not Rifleman, as my wife complains at the sound of me constantly pressing the shoot trigger with rifleman.
---
Thank you for the NSFW notification I am on my work computer and was like "Oh what is this...oh I should wait about 40 min till I am off work."
---
Glad it wasn’t just me
---
Same.  Expecting an equal amount of effort on Bethesda's part too.
---
Well I'd say only the last enemy would give you trouble.
---
Okay
---
I’ve seen them. I want them. The glow in the dark wallpapers, the playground thing, the ghillie suit backpack, the handmade paint, the power armor paints, the new power armor, the fireplace door, the ammo converter, the pipboy paint, the Sheepsquatch plushie, the super sledge plaint, the hanging raider tree thing, the firefly lamp, the dark matter combat rifle paint, the camp module, the chicken coup, the new poses, the jangles backpack, the raider mask, the Gatling gun skin, the jetpacks, the cosmos suits, the planetarium lamp, the board game framed... yeah I see the rewards and I want them. If I got zero atoms for the next few months and got to work towards all those rewards I’d be happy. The atomic shop is a crapshoot compared to those specific items
---
Really wish the PvE 'groupies' would realize that not everythings about them and stop bashing something they know absolutely nothing about just because they're mad it exists.
---
They say PvP players are the most toxic but I highly disagree, one time (though I have over 100 un responded to hateful messages in my inbox on xbox) I killed a guy at a workshop only ONE time and he messaged me over 70 times telling me my parents don't love me, kill myself, how sad my life must be etc. 
---
People like you are the exact reason this will never be fixed. You downvote anything that has to do with PvP just because you don't like that is was added into the game at all, or maybe it triggers some sort of Fallout derived PTSD of a time somebody killed you at a workshop or griefed your base. 
---
I'm not responding to you again because a quick glance at your profile shows you know jack squat about this game in general, but you like to act like you do.
---
Downvotes ahoy!
---
Yes apparently see here

While funny  Urban dictionary makes everything inappropriate one way or another so unless you come up with some completely new words it's gonna be inappropriate thanks to urban dictionary
---
A list of shit I don't want or need is, in the end, just a list of shit.
---
- Clean sink: I have nowhere in my camp I want this.
---
- Ammo converter: Literally the one thing that is worth it. Because it's at level five and I can get it in just a few days when this releases.
---
- Flying Saucer Jungle Gym: I don't even have *room* in my camp for this.
---
- Ghillie Backpack: I don't even like how this looks, and I have nice backpack skins already.
---
- Sheepsquatch plush: I wouldn't say no, but it's only worth about 50-100 atoms to me. Not a big incentive.
---
- Hanging Raider Cage: I don't like this, or have room for it.
---
- Firefly Jar: Same as the plush.
---
- Chicken Coop: No need, no room, don't like it.
---
- Jangles Backpack: Same as the plush and the jar.
---
- Captain Cosmos PA: I have two sets of T65 PA I actively use, one with Liberty Prime and one with Red Ranger. I can't put PA on display, so I can't even use all the other skins I already have.
---
- Fireplace Secret Door: So not worth grinding to level 99.
---
- Ghillie Suit Armor Skins: I don't like how it looks and I never have my armor showing anyway. 
---
- Other PA skins: See above.
---
- 1500 Atoms: Almost 5,000 less than I've been able to get in the same amount of time.
---
- 6000 caps: Seriously? Is this a joke?
---
- 600 scrip: 6 extra pulls on the slot machine, in three months. I already get two a day if I feel like playing a couple hours. 
---
- 250 Gold Bullion: Again, is this a joke??
---
- 12 Perk Card Packs: I don't even know how many levels I have saved up at this point.
---
- 39 Lunchboxes: I don't even.
---
- Plus a bunch of other shit so insignificant even *you* didn't list it, and I have even less use for than what you did list.
---
Point being, you can make all the arguments you want about how big of a "value" this is, but at the end of the day, for us veteran players, if it's not stuff we care about, this new season format is just a big reason to move on to another game. And it's not like FO76 has a massive fan-base as it is. They *really* can't afford to lose a lot of players, and this will probably accomplish exactly that.
---
Same straightforward conversion was what I wanted too but it's better than nothing
---
nope, only do my dealings on the sub that shall not be named
---
xbox LFG is aids for that topic anyway
---
I run both. Marsupial to me, carry weight and jump with minimal intelligence decrease (about the same as drinking alcohol) as long as you have perks. It seems as if my food and drink are decreasing a lot faster after Wastelanders update so Speed Demon makes that even quicker. 
---
Long story short, I couldn't run Speed Demon without Marsupial because of the extra food and water I have to carry for upkeep.
---
This could change after they adjust food/drink penalties.
---
I was making a joke
---
Angry Turtle's sneak video might still be relevant he's pretty good at testing things.
---
https://youtu.be/GWX2HycA69I
---
Well you were trying to rip that guy off to begin with so I'd say its karma. Speaking of karma, stick to the market subs and only trust people with high karma.
---
We know, and I guess no one talks to you at parties.
---
Damn, sick burn! I’ll let you keep thinking whatever you want about me personally. We disagree, get over it. This new system is coming though, so enjoy being extra salty for the next few months.
---
Beckett is bugged for me so I can't finish his questline.  Gramps sucks and I can't find any others
---
1500 atoms is your allotment for the entire season, assuming you get rank 100. I'm sure that's the point of your post, yes?
---
10/10 would read again
---
It’s true though...so after running into the chick in watoga you didn’t stop and say wtf is the purpose of this? I mean I get it girl power okay but when’s enough ? Look I was a fan of chasing around this cute grandma all over the wasteland but holly crap I dread going to the crater everyday just to be reminded how much of a fail that faction is
---
Battle pass system = daily chore list.
---
pretty pissed to be honest, daily/weekly challenges were the only thing keeping me interested in the long term. save up and get a neat bundle or some small atom shop items that i wanted to personalize my camp. but now.... complete 10% of a several month challenge for what i can get in 3 days of completed challenges is pathetic.
---
yes, there is cosmetics in the season, so what? a sizable chunk i couldn't care for and even then everyone playing will be getting the exact same rewards. everyone will be walking around in the ghilli skins (especially in nuclear winter) or cosmo PA paint, it will all be so common it devalues the sense of achievement.
---
and that's all before we even get into the fact the atom shop will still be selling and taking away items/bundles throughout the whole affair. 1500 ATOMS for the whole season can't buy 1 power armour paint in the atom shop, so if there's a single thing i would actually want to get show up in the store the only option is the pay with money
---
I never personally said that I am poor so continue to reach and deflect from what a prick you are.
---
I will read you to filth. Keep trying me.
---
Farm the random encounters and you will find the other two, hell I didn't farm them and I got them all anyway.
---
Btw how is Beckett bugged for you?
---
Oh I know, I was there asking questions.
---
Ive been putting alot of effort into this for almost a year now just to get shit on by salty PvE players at every turn. I'm done being cordial.
---
None of that actually says how the pacing will be. They give that 1-2 hour estimate, but it's been pretty obvious since launch that they are pretty out of touch with the playerbase. I already mentioned the joke that was the burrows, but you can watch their dev streams too, or just read some random patch notes. When they say 2 hours, that might very well mean 20 minutes for a meta build. We don't know until it comes, so complaining preemptively is pretty worthless
---
The underground mission is bugged.  I can't get through one of the doors
---
Im allied with both sides so i havent bothered with random encounters for a while.  Ill check that out though
---
I never really meant you are poor, I guess you need to go to elementary school again.
---
Did you miss the whole theme of the first season?
---
Forced or not that's up to debate, they know their demographics better. This is about whether or not this game deserves the extra money thrown at it. Why? Because there are still glaring issues about it that have existed since day one, and seeing the direction they're going.. it really makes me wonder a few things.
---
Which door?
---
I haven’t watched any videos about it (yet), but I have max lone wanderer, and a full set of mutants powered sentinel scout armor. And there is a HUGE difference in regen speed.
---
Then why do you keep buying atoms?
---
Bold of you to assume it has a world model.
---
Sadly, I agree with you 100%
---
I’m guessing players that are really into camp building are feeling the hit with the loss of atoms moreso than anyone else.  
---
I generally don’t care about camp stuff and typically buy skins to lock my weapons/armor out of vend/scrip listings, so I’m actually pretty enthusiastic about the ghillie skins.  Given the amount of atoms I’m sitting on, I don’t think this will affect me personally.  
---
I can sympathize with players that are accustomed to earning a lot of atoms through the game, buying whatever they like in the atx, and now the well is mostly dried up.  In all fairness, I’m surprised they didn’t plug the gaping hole in their revenue ages ago.  Existing atom challenges are ridiculously easy.....mostly.  I figured they’d just eliminate it altogether, so I’m pleasantly surprised that it’s been converted into a sort of game with tiered rewards.
---
No but clearly you do if you think “you” isn’t being directed at an individual and refers to other people.
---
I’m not sure who let you even past the second grade but they should have their teaching license revoked.
---
Yes. Exactly this.
---
A random level 50 sheepsquatch or the Imposter? Neither one will give you a Fixer, unfortunately. You do get a standard one for completing the full Lying Lowe questline. Many players can craft you one, too.
---
Yes. 100%
---
FIFA is a cesspit
---
Exactly, there's no choice. And you get people apologizing on behalf of Bethesda with choices like this while the game remains pretty broken on many levels. This is what's truly disturbing to me. I don't feel bad that this post gets downvoted, hell, I expected it, but still, it does make me sad as I reach the realization that people don't care having their leg pulled.
---
"If you" is used in many ways, one of such means "If someone".
---
So idk what you're fussing about.
---
Damn you.... i had been doing this on xbox and kinda gave up a bit.
---
I’ll pm you and you might as well take a look at what i have...
---
I have 4 characters maxed out on caps, I've bought everything I personally want with bullion and I don't legendary hunt. 
---
I basically build camps and none of these camp items fit my "lore" build anyway
---
You can pay 150 atoms per rank. The rank 10 reward is 150 atoms
---
Ouch
---
Ah fuck me I thought that was the reward for Scoot’s questline
---
Ah cool will have to check that out
---
I was making a joke.
---
Oh, definitely! That was part of my point, even - the Secret Service armor looks god-awful, and I'd never even consider it if it weren't for the stats. But if we had a transmog system, I wouldn't need to choose between looking good -or- having good stats - we'd be able to have both! :)
---
I don't play my pure stealth guy much any more, but I know once I stopped using 1 chameleon piece (so no chameleon ability at all) stealth worked much better for me. Think I might have 1 piece that improves stealth. 
---
But I think they worked on stealth with 19 or some other patch? So may not be case anymore. 
---
But yeah, sometimes it seem impossible to shake that red DETECTED when it seems no one is around. I just tell myself it must be an invisible alien hovering overhead.
---
I’m very excited for this new mechanic. I really want to hang that board game up in my camp.
---
Sounds more like a lazy excuse to me, though I have come to expect that from you at this point.
---
Well lunchboxes in shelter are kind of pat to win.
---
lunchboxes in fo 4 are kind of meh unless you use a mod on them.
---
Given the loot rate mechanic in blades was pay to progress I think everyone else though Beth was going the wrong way with its pay to play crap.
---
If I was into cosmetics and whatnot Id bummed that they think my earning atoms to buy whatever I choose.. isnt as good for me as accepting their choice of what to give me...
---
thankfully (for me) Im not really into that whole scene.. but it is interesting to see the various takes people have on this so far..
---
I feel a massive difference using ap Regen armour with lone wanderer and nerd rage but no action girl. Like to me I feel like one ap Regen armour is equivalent to max action girl. 
---
But on my pa build I use all 3 perks to get as much ap Regen but doesn’t come close to my other build
---
One of the garage doors.  The terminal that is supposed to open it will not open it.
---
I'm curious - why do you say that it's not very good?
---
Because I want to support the game I play, and I may still depending how seasons truly pan out and whether or not they finally start working hard on bugs. Things are turning, and probably not in the right direction however, the change happened with Wastelanders and people were hopeful (including me) but now I'm skeptical.
---
p.s. I started with Wastelanders, so only now I am finding out that the bugs I am encountering have existed since day one. And that's disturbing.
---
Yeah I got scammed the other day and come to find out it was from a big scammer. Oh well.
---
Well pretty weak for an argument or a way provoke someone. 
---
Try harder, I deal with you kind of people all the time, but they are usually quite dim, I am guess no difference here.
---
same dude, same. At least I managed to buy a lvl 50 Fixer from another player, but no plans for it yet.
---
at level 24 I wouldnt even be thinking about a fixer for a while..
---
Id be scrapping the shit out of every combat rifle I was about to start coming across until I was lvl 50
---
Thanks! You spawn on the angled side of the mono-rail support, the lengths of power connectors allow players to access the work stations and falling down to the main living area is the best solution I have so far. Definitely going to experiment with it
---
I think you only need to open one garage door? If I remember correctly?
---
Yeah, every 10 ranks for a total of 1500. So you could spend your whole seasons reward of 1500 for that first 150 lol. Totally ridiculous.
---
No, she didn't bother me in the slightest because I'm not bothered by women like you seem to be. 
---
"I get it girl power okay but when’s enough ?" So you don't get it? You keep putting your foot in your mouth on this topic.
---
Y'all wanna know what plans you need to obtain? Add the IGN shown above. Go through there shit, as they have All plans. See the ones that you've still yet to aquire. Simply screenshot, or write them down. Then hunt for the ones you do not know.
---
:)
---
Had to go to page two of the search results to find out what you were talking about. Page one was full of Lacrosse and AT references. The Urban Dictionary entry was pretty specific. How many pirates are running around Appalachia anyway?
---
Doing that too
---
Thank you so much! This will be a huge help for me!
---
Hard out here for a shrimp
---
Shitter's full?
---
Well, you ain’t gonna get downvoted by me, man. I agree with you 100%, but unfortunately the only PvP I get to see is in TF2. At least Engie gets a Pip-Boy there...
---
Not everyone who plays this game is from the states. Now from lore perspective it doesn’t fit in the game, although you could make the argument that immigrants could have a flag from their native countries in their homes in Appalachia. I’m from Iceland and would love to have an Icelandic flag, nothing politic about it. I think Bethesda  could make a lot of money making each countries flag available for purchase in the atom store. What I’m saying I think it’s cool and I want it, but also doesn’t quite make up lore wise.
---
To be fair, PvE players get shit on by PvP players all the time. 
---
Carebear!
---
DoN't TaKe A wOrKsHoP tHeN!
---
I agree, it gets old fast.
---
Look man thier point is, bethsda is making it harder to get shit from the already microtransactions aggresive atom shop. This game has no end game, so your op 1 shot everything build, is boring to use. Camp building is somthing people like, but default camp building is mediocre at best. Just because you dont use the atom shop doesnt mean other people dont, this game wants you to spend. Fo1st atom shop, pay to win aspects, the series has become one big shopping mall. Also side note, mods for only private servers, with most likely creation club style mods, will be pay walking mods. My point is bethsda weaponizes micro transactions, so you should be so hateful at them for saying bethsda is forcing them to spend.
---
Haha good point! I would like to believe so since it has a stash box model, but I suppose if there isn't one it could be easily created. The regular sized Mr. Fuzzy can already be put into a display case, I feel like his larger companion should have the same respect 😂
---
I dont think there is a trail.. everyone does it differently 
---
Ive started 3 toons since the game released and none of them followed the same path.. other than my personal style is to lvl up to 50 before doing main quests...
---
In addition to what u/kantusa said, use a courier if possible. Some subs offer that service.
---
The converter. Most people play for far longer that 10 hours every 90 days.
---
hm maybee I should start a murderous hobo log.......
---
Same, level 24.  Ive been hopping up onto a rock or something and trying to crack off as many rounds as possible from safety
---
It’s funny I can see where both of you are coming from, when I got bored of doing the same old dailies and Queen fights with the same weapons over and over again, I made a new character leveled it to 50+ with a new build and play style. In that way among others you can stretch out your experience with this game, but I also recognize the other commenters point namely that however many different ways in which I try to switch up how I play the game, fact remains that it’s a daily repetition of the same old quests events and singular boss fights that I’ve done hundreds of times by now.
---
I feel I got my money’s worth out of the hundreds of hours up to this point, but in order to have some long term player retention generally speaking the amount of content is just too much of a shallow pool which gets old real quick. And there’s only so many times I can rebuild my camp or create a new character before it just gets too stale to keep playing.
---
Well I'm just reading the common discourse but the main issue people (including me) have with it is the fact that we will be earning far less atoms from Season 1 than the free atoms we could be earning in the time it will be taking place in. Also, a significant portion of the rewards are the same skin for different armors instead of unique rewards.
---
Tbh I haven't even finished Wastelanders yet and often play on and off (currently playing another game but will play F076 again afterwards). So this is good for me, I can continue doing the story and have this season to go along with it. I imagine it's boring for people who have finished the main story... It's good to take a break from certain games sometimes and then you can come back with more enthusiasm.
---
what will i get for offering plans i have about 1000 plans of different stuff
---
I feel like I came up with this exact idea idea a year ago. Not that it's particularly unique.
---

---
Agreed, I'm sitting on many, many Unyielding AP Refresh FDC pieces as well as a host of Lifesaving and other top rolls (Assassins Sentinel etc.) but its all pretty much worthless now with the SS release, may end up vending or just turning in for scrip
---
And arrows and cannonballs and crossbow bolts.
---
I have done at least 20 rolls for a decent gauss shotgun and all I get is crap.  It's got to were I don't even try anymore.
---
I’m wondering, as someone who doesn’t ever make time to play NW, if this means that I have three choices:
---
A) Play NW sometimes
---
B) Skip those challenges at the cost of Atoms
---
C) not finish the season path
---
I can give you one later if you dont find it before I get on. Also have found them on the skeleton near the entrance at train station near top of the world. It's usually laying on the ground.
---
I use a Instigating Hunting/Sniper rifle and a Furious Lever or a Furious Handmade most of the time..
---
Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit
---
And crossbow bolts and mini nukes and cannonballs.
---
I don't like it.
---
Thank you! Will do another announcement when Xbox is released
---
A workshop and PvP are undeniably connected.
---
Goodbye ammo vendor, ah well.    
---
Wow so seasons last bout 3 months right?  Assume you were a person who did dailies every day, that's about 50 a day, 100 for weekly, 450ish a week x 12 weeks, you'd be losing out on around 4k atoms.    
---
Now I'm sure not many do that, but for those that do that's quite a bit.
---
Marsupial is 100% a game changer @ Whitesprings
---
I will try and be available most of the day mid week and limited at weekend. I will edit the post to make it clear
---
There isn't one, but you can start to have diminishing returns, in that you only need so much AP regen to get by, and you might be better served by other effects.
---
I'm going to fudge the numbers, but it was something like the first AP refresh space takes the time down from 25 to 12.  But then the next goes from 12 to 6.  6 to 3.  That kind of thing.  Action Boy/Girl is another factor too.  It all improves the AP speed, but whether or not you will find that increasingly marginal improvement worthwhile is a different story.
---
Exactly that!
---
Can't find it there. Only the emotes, the scrapbox and the items
---
Nope I don't fall for that bullshit. No matter what you go first or no deal, don't care what story you want to give me or that you have trust issues, you want to trade you go first. If I want a trade I only use the market. I also only buy stable fluxes when the owner is not at their camp. I prefer no one else around at all just incase they have a teammate that does some weird fuckery.
---
Please explain more, I just started an immersive play through. No fast travel, no mutations, rifleman/heavy build (no bloodied / junkies - don’t want to be op), private world only play through. And would like to know why you do the play through a then and what do you do then? Random dailies?
---
Hello. You can visit the plan mule and determine easily which plans you are missing. Hope that helps
---
apparently.. their choice of what you get is better for you than being able to choose what you want..
---
-shrugs-
---
&gt; A: **There are fewer Atoms overall up for grabs in this new system, but you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges**. As a result, you will still be able to save up Atoms for Atomic Shop items, but **you will now also directly unlock lots of new items, including cosmetics for your characters, like Power Armor Paints, Weapon Skins, C.A.M.P. items, and more by ranking up. This wasn’t possible with the existing Challenge system, and we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.**
---
-ETA: a quote
---
nice!
---
Yes, I hope so too. We have PS4 members in our group so hopefully we can
---
I totally agree, but it is what it is!
---
I started in beta. I don't buy atoms to support a game when it constantly disappoints.
---
I've bought atoms every time I felt that Bethesda did something good that improved the game. Once when wild Appalachia came out and once when wastelanders came out.
---
I remember someone who was adamant that the casual player would probably end up with more atoms with seasons, and I was very dubious.    
---
With good cause it seems.
---
Is this a crafting/collecting group? If so, I'm interested in joining and providing services.
---
Creativity at its finest 😂
---
I managed to get a couple that way outside, but the ones inside the whitesprings and watoga emergency building are near impossible. Went through a lot of radaways already.
---
Hello :) not exactly sure what you mean. This is a free service
---
Hi innov! If it auto completes is it then not possible to ever get the rewards?
---
Thank you! I’ll go check there. I thought I had bought mine from the raider vendor bot but no luck so far.
---
&gt; If you can earn them in game is's not like it's pay to win
---
If you can pay for it while finding it in game, it is pay to win.
---
You basically take less damage from any source &amp; gain a bit of AP regen solo.  Compared to the Bodyguards perk, which only gives you 12 Damage/Energy Resist for being on a team (ofc if you rank it up to 4, you get it at 36 Damage/Energy Resist).
---
Yeah. Workshops were made 100% with PvP in mind, and the resources just as a small reward for keeping it.
---
For science, how many possible plans are there?
---
Not the point. Vaping the low levels and taunting them is still shit behavior. Only once have I heard of a PvPer being kind to a lowbie at a workshop. 
---
Taunting them and repeatedly killing them? We see those posts frequently.
---
Use
---
Abraxo.
---
sorry old grudge, I was the only one who cleaned the damn toilet In the dorm. As in literaly the entire building.
---
i have a bunch of plans i can give you but like will i get legendaries or caps or sumn (no actual money)
---
“You’re toxic, you don’t know shit” the exact salty reply I’d expect from one you. 
---
I don’t care if you’re not going to respond, all of you live in a bubble.
---
This game engine as it is barely supports the combat it has already and you want more PvP? What a joke.
---
They gave you Survival, and took it back over a LACK OF INTEREST. Then came NW, yet another mode that sure people play it, but it still sucks. It sucks so bad they have to dangle cosmetics in front our faces to get us to suffer it.
---
Meanwhile the PvE side of the game that VASTLY outnumbers you is wanting their shit fixed.
---
You want PvP? Go play CoD, it’s what it was made for. The abortion they set up here isn’t.
---
Bunch of salty ass criers. I didn’t even downvote, I just made a comment but in honor of you: here you go
---
Hey. If you want to join in the Xbox efforts, feel free to DM me
---
I don’t know what to tell you dude absolutely my comment was not eloquent but the argument is there so agree or disagree it’s all good ... the only one who has figuratively put their “foot in their mouth” is you my friend trying to comment on someone’s appearance as some kind of demeaning way of giving yourself any substance to your side of the opinion. It’s comical
---
If you are xbox, I can give you a free plan
---
They aren't forced to put 90% of new content in the item shop, but here we are.
---
There's still a point to be made here though. If someone is sitting at 751 scrip or more when they earn that reward, some of the reward will be wasted.
---
No problem. It may take alot of hops but that's expected.  Only bots I know I've seen selling them are the two by top of the world and the one at camden park. I'm sure others sell them but I've stopped looking lol.
---
Yes. Lost a BE gatling plasma and Cryolator, learned from it and moved on. This was back in Feb
---
Hmm that is a new one to me! What platform are you on?
---
I buy all my atoms anyway so it personally doesn't affect me.  I do challenges just to complete them, not for the atom rewards. Still I know for many players those challenges are the only way to gain atoms and the reduction will hurt.
---
It is absolutely that :) go ahead and DM me and I will give you the link
---
dailies, events, discovering locations and killing the highest level mobs I can reliably handle at whatever my given level is at the time without using up all my ammo and wrecking my armor..
---
I just like to wait until 50 because by then I can go anywhere on the map without worrying about getting my ass handed to me all the time..
---
I just stay in the West doing stuff.. if I see someone with a base near a train station in the east or at some other landmark Id like to discover for later.. Ill pop over there and discover it and split..
---
This. I think of it as more of a convert garbage machine that produces some ammo. And given ammo is often the only thing you can produce that has Any demand....
---
mobs wreck camps too.. 
---
not saying that is what happened.. but if you didnt see it yourself.. you cant really be sure unless they left you a bag of poop too...
---
So more than an hour every day... For over two months.  That is a lot more time invested than pretty much any other pass system asks.
---
Hello. This is a community effort so people have donated plans. We are finished on PC. I will admit that I did have to trade for some plans but generally 90% were donations.
---
Could have been  a scorchbeast, people will lure them or other creatures to destroy your camp
---
I can certainly understand nitpicking the rewards, sure there are multiple version of a skin and everyone is playing for the same rewards, so there is a lack of unique value. It really doesn't matter to me - there are 4 interesting rewards I'll be working toward and I'll finish the season for the fun of it. As for the Atoms, I've seen some people meticulously calculating the differences in totals of what could be earned. Yes, there certainly a difference, but who says Bethesda is obligated to maintain what is offered for free? Also the thing those Atom value assessments seem to fail to put into perspective is that an Atom is near to a penny in actual value, so these issues people have with the changes really equate to them getting mad over a few pennies. Those few pennies often take a significant volume of time to complete - are people really de-valuating their time to such a degree that they would be so angry over pennies? I truly find the Atom awards to be a bonus for having fun in the game, it isn't a job. Overall, I am excited for Season 1 - the rewards, the effort for progress and to see this as a building block, as you noted, to bigger and better things in future seasons.
---
The raider that helps you recruit the explosives guy in Raiders’ chain of Wastelanders
---
So basically this game is losing players quickly, there is no enganging end-game, a semi forced subscription, bugs everywhere, we can't mod servers to fix the game, let's say 80% of atom shop items are really ugly, and they nerf rewards and give us a bunch of PA skins, that I don't even use, and a guillie skin for 32 different type of armor. Nice I've spent literally hours to get an identical guillie skin from nuclear winter like 5 weeks ago
---
Aka we will see how many people subscribe until we waste our time making more free stuff lol
---
Hey it’s my birthday too. Best birthday. Half Birthday is Christmas. Evenly spaced presents gang rise up.
---
I was on public and i reckon there were 6 or 7 per wave
---
Wont really effect me. If theres something I really want I buy it. 
---
The Score track will give me a long term goal that I can see. I prefer it.
---
They said they were removing the daily atoms in favor of this system and that there would be less atoms available.  Much much less as it turns out.
---
There are 1301 legitimate plans of which 141 are not tradeable so the mule has 1160 plans

I'm at level 350 and play bloodied, the other day a level 25 tried to give me a bag with some stimpaks because he thought my health was too low and I needed help.

His gt is : Keygamer117

Can't think I have come across anyone more deserving. I'm giving him a TSE lever but he won't be able to use it for a while.
---
I want to like this game, I want to play it, but they make it so hard.
---
PS4
---
You're in what the game considers to be the wrong areas for you, you're in level 45+ zones. Progression at the moment goes The Forest &gt; Toxic Valley &gt; Ash Heap &gt; Savage Divide &gt; The Mire &amp; then Cranberry bog. If you follow that, things will go smoothly until the Wendigo Cave where unless you use power armor it will make it impossible. You can however jump on a power armor frame to reach a ledge near the beginning and get to your objective. Everything else is smooth sailing.
---
Theres a spawn point at the pleasant valley station, its on the ground near a skeleton outside of the vendor bot. The Face gear that spawns is random so good luck.
---
Not going to lie, this warmed my heart lol
---
One of the raider outpost down the road from the top of the world. It spawns on the picnic table
---
Wow this is amazing I’m on Xbox but kudos to you guys
---
I understand that. What I don't get is why the attacking dialog box comes up and I do no damage to them.  It's like I'm trying to initiate pvp yet they're already hostile to me.
---
they should be there when you log in via that launcher.. 
---
things you buy will be available on either launcher once purchased
---
HOW!? You haven’t said where the fuck this is
---
Wtf is an IGN
---
its a costume isnt it?
---
Ah
---
!remindme 16 days
---
I chuckled. It was good
---
Uh, earning cosmetics? I didn't down vote your comment Sbiffo. I will give you an honest answer. I'm a single player guy through and through. But I love Fallout and knew that I could enjoy the game despite it being an online-only multiplayer game. I've owned the game since 2018 and didn't choose to play the game until a couple of weeks before Wastelanders came out. I consider two things to be the game. The first is the original main quest and the second is the Wastelanders quest. I take my time with a game. I'm still playing the original main quest. I don't try to race through the game like a rocket is attached to my back trying to become as OP as I possibly can become as quickly as possible. However, the other stuff is just MMO-style filler to me. I knew that I wouldn't be crazy about it when I bought the game. And I can only enjoy that stuff when I get to play with my friends and in small dosages. But because it's an online game from Bethesda, more story based content will be coming. And in the meantime I grind for Atoms to get the cosmetics I enjoy while slowly questing. But for the filler that's earning Atoms, I'm a frickin' speed runner.
---
In the post it says this:
---
"If you would like to visit please get in touch with me and add IGN ThePlanCollectors"
---
So you can do that
---
Yea, but other items u get in the shop comes with some evivromental resistance. I mean it looks better then the picture in person.
---
TOW is a terrific game if a bit short, but it's a hell of a start to a new universe for Obsidian and I hope they make more of that title and make a ton of money doing it.  I'll look forward to them, buy them and play them.  
---
Signed,

A guy with 500 levels in 76 and 1000 hours in 4 (and Todd only knows how many in 3).
---
Update it was by the skeleton. Thanks a bunch man.
---
Two characters are level 200+, the other three are 100+. Never got Fallout 1st as there was no need; I don't think it would have opened up the game further than what I can already do. The game is pretty much "meh" for me at this point; I usually just pop in to shoot some things.
---
I just assumed as the effect is local to that piece, it would show up there, but I can see the logic now. Thanks.
---
I've given up on queen fights before they are not fun or rewarding. At least with encryptid, radrumle and project p you have fun and have a chance of getting cool apparel items
---
Comforting mooo
---
An IGN is an in-game name. It is the Bethesda username that you use to log into the game on PC
---
I see. Can I log in using either launcher at any time or do I have to go through any kind of process if I want to change from one to the other?
---
That’s a great idea for a mission,I think there is a challenge to snap a picture of the Wendigo in wendigo cave
---
Which means that *everybody* that PvPs does that, right? No. People like to talk about negative stuff. The media thrives off of it. I don’t touch workshops if the owner is under level 50. But you won’t see “Wow, thanks to the high level that helped with the 3 waves of rad scorpions!” because nobody cares about that.
---
Update operation Green Hood: Complete.
---
Found it by the skeleton thanks you guys rock.
---
Anytime and I'm glad you found it!
---
Nephi’s driver for the achievement.
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt;I basically build camps and none of these camp items fit my "lore" build anyway
---
None of the stuff they've offered in the shop recently works for mine either, which is why I don't care about the trickle of free atoms the dailies have out. On the rare occasion there is something I want I will just but $10-20 worth and get it, but that only happens every few months. 
---
I've probably spent $50-60 on atoms since the game released, which I'm OK with considering I've got several hundred hours of entertainment out of the game in the 20 or so months since it was released.
---
Is forest the 1 with the greenish stripe down it? Pretty sure it isnt that nice tbh. Do have it and blue green and pink after only starting abit of farming recently
---
There's never anything that pleases some people I swear.
---
Every time someone asks this, they push the change back a week.
---
ETA is currently 32 years from now.
---
I came back to Grahm going ham on my camp last night. My turrets would down him but not kill him. He had about half of my defences destroyed before I jumped servers and repaired.
---
Damnit. Maybe if I start saying how much I enjoy the game and how well it works it may inspire them to work faster?
---
Do they usually attack until everything is destroyed?I have a 4 story house and everything got wrecked.
---
If you wanna try it again they did Daggerfall Unity.
---
It’s a free DL and it helped with 99% of the bugs!
---
What good are cosmetics if you're not playing the game
---
Criticism. Learn
---
No, then they’ll think you’re happy with how it is currently, and start using up their vacation times.
---
I dunno.. my answer was really just a vessel for dropping the bag of poop line at the end.. lol
---
I can empathize with the criticism that few new items have been added to the... I guess what I'll call the "default" game.  I noticed it especially when Foundation and Crater moved in, and their vendors had no unique outfits for sale or anything like that, even though everyone there has something unique about them.  It's all reserved for quest rewards, Atomic Shop stuff, or the result of the bullion grind.
---
Even some of the obvious stuff goes amiss.  Like, what if someone wanted to replace a lost Fire Breather outfit?  Or the Responders Paramedic Jumpsuit?  You can't buy a new one from any robo-vendor, even from the ones representing that faction.  Why are BoS Combat Armor mods sold at Grafton Station and not the actual BoS vendor?  And the prices of goods like Stimpaks or Bobby Pins have always been wildly out-of-proportion.  It's like no one cares.
---
I saw that and left it for anyone who might want to make an office reference as I know reddit enjoys, but you took it a different direction, I respect that!
---
No, once you're 100 that's it
---
I dunno.. I linked my steam acct. when that was still available but never downloaded the game once it was in my library because I didnt want to wait a day for it..
---
Oh man, i just dumped tons of ammo yesterday. I dump ammo after pretty much every outing. At least I won't be wasting it anymore. 
---
I guess this is going to pretty much kill the ammo economy in the vending machines now too.
---
I actually feel inclined to leave... I only log in nowadays just for the daily challanges...
---
If ps5 makes it off the ground, alot of people have internet data caps. So that cloud gaming stuff,  is going to be a bitch and a half, Assuming they dont keep using disks.
---
No clipping rules, make snap a toggle.  Would open up a lot of possibilities.
---
Downvote all I want? Downvote I shall, then.
---
This absolutely reeks of **ungratefulness**. The validity of this change is subjective and you've convinced yourself otherwise. For a more casual playerbase that actually *plays the game to enjoy the game*, this change will (and seems to have been already) be welcomed.
---
This isn't designed for diehard daily challenge farmers. This is as entitled as that user complaining about "old" free items in the Atomic Store. I think that you should, frankly, be ashamed of yourself.
---
It's one thing to demand better service for *Fallout 1st* membership. Real money is involved in that equation and certain advertised features have not yet been implemented.
---
It's another thing entirely to look a gift horse in the mouth with a generous feature that **did not have to be in the game in the first place**.
---
Piss.
---
Removing dailys atom rewards Will for sure make me leave
---
depends on how much ammo currency you get.. and what you can get for it..
---
either way I think it changes the ammo meta drastically...
---
even though it is a pittance.. I like to craft everything I can for the XP.. it all adds up at the end of the day...
---
It uses the same 'pricing' models as vendors - you sell it for super cheap, but you buy it super expensive.  Plus I'm pretty sure I remember a daily cap on how much you can convert.
---
Same, at least it'll help in NW.
---
This is just sounding like they haven't really changed the daily atoms challenge system at all, and are just giving us points on the track instead of atoms.
---
Lol good thing you didn't want the glowing skeleton outfit...
---
Catch-22 in action.  (google it if you don't know that reference)
---
Same thing happened to me but I was on 5 hp and I ran to the whitespring train station for cover and I looked back and saw him using the “come here” emote
---
Yeah, if yeah have the party boy/girl perk on it goes up to 6 perception which isn't to be sniffed at.
---
IGN is a website so unless it has some other meaning it would be helpful if you explained it
---
I sell it.
---
There’s 100 levels, there’s a 2 week break where you can’t buy any levels, it starts at easy ( seriously an hour a level is not too bad over 70 days....too bad it ramps up.) and ramps up to harder and harder to do. ( you HAVE to pvp to get some of the points unless there’s something wrong with my data mining and spreadsheets, and this is the best part, you can’t miss Anny of the challengs to get 100 levels.  They even conveniently sprinkle in atoms equal to the ranks you need to progress so that technically you can skip one pvp Challenge a week...you just don’t get any atoms....skip all of the pvp challenges? Oh to bad. But you can buy atoms and thus literaly  buy pvp wins.
---
Oh and in this games case sprinkle in what is literal Junk rewards while putting the “real rewards“ at the end.
---
“Wealth of new content” ...how long do we have to wait? Wastelander’s content was 8 months late &amp; once it did arrive I finished it in 3 days while working a full time job. Not exactly a promising future.
---
I like #3, if for some reason you miss looting a legendary scorchbeast or the queen, fast travel to Watoga station and they’ll fall on your head full of loot.
---
Or he's just smart and stocks up on atoms while he still can given they're nerfing ways to earn sufficient amounts at a steady rate. Thats what ive been doing. 
---
So when down the line they release cool skins or camp items that should be free and earnable to begin with, the players like me who refuse to spend another dime will realize they now spend atoms faster than the game let them earn them will regret not having done it too.
---
When does this start
---
Only bought a backpack variant (with the attached shovel) and sit on my 4000 atoms. Thinking about buying the survivalist outfit coz it has binoculars hanging on the chest. That was pretty much my rl setup when i was hiking and camping outdoors. I would spend even more caps for JUST the binoculars, since the rest of the outfit looks pretty bad imo There is absolutely nothing else i'm interested in in the shop.
---
But i always liked the message popping up when i achieved something, although i was not going to spend the 10 atoms anyway. I will miss that small feeling of achievement i guess. 
---
But more perk packs are always nice, so i think i can arrange with the new system.
---
I'm just playing this until Cyberpunk comes out.
---
So is House alive during 4 or no? Canonically
---
Atoms = choice.  If you don't dig anything on the track it's a 100% nerf.
---
Very good example lol.
---
This char is now level 28. I don't have that one card that helps with Vendors but I do have some chems that help with CHA. It should still show up in the list.  
---
I read somewhere a faction has it for Wal-mart cheap prices.
---
Yeah they are both in the 2280 decade
---
In Game Name
---
That's your opinion but it doesn't help.
---
Be ashamed of myself? Why should I remotely be ashamed of myself. I've supported this game since DAY 1. I've bought 3 different copies of it and put in a combined time of 1.3k hours. 
---
I LOVE Fallout 76. I've been paying for Fallout 1st for the past 5 months and the only reason I was doing so was because I could get on, do dailys, save up those atoms and gather scrap for my box whilst I was at it.
---
Apparently you're incapable of reading since this criticism/feedback was entirely my opinion. Bethesda are the ones who are thinking that its objectively a better system. 
---
The entire system is subjective and that's exactly what I said. For ME and many others I've spoken to, this doesn't favour my time spend in the game. 
---
Choosing my reward rather than being told "you're getting this suit of power armour whether its one you like or not" was better for me. 
---
Would I have bought a reskin of a mask I already have? No, would I have bought reskins of an outfit I bought this week? No.
---
I wouldn't have bought any of the items this pass gives, so why should I be happy that the previous system, one I never once complained about, one that gave me the ability to save and buy what I did want, is removed. 
---
This system barely benefits casuals anyway. The majority of casual players will not play enough to reach 100, the grinders will. However this system doesn't appeal to the grinders, the ones who will reach 100.
---
What I find ironic is that a few weeks ago, I was making the exact argument you did. I was defending the reduction in atoms claiming that surely they wouldn't reduce them *THAT* much. That we would get a bunch of cool items for free along with atoms. Little did I know how unappealing this pass would be. Future passes might be much better, I imagine a BOS themed one next season or the season after. However this one, for a introduction to the system, is awful.
---
Edit: I actually would have bought the sink, and the new poster for the wall. That's it.
---
People do talk about the negative. People also come here nearly daily to say thanks for something. 
---
Not all PvPers are puppy kickers. Not all PvEers complain about PvP.
---
The OP wants Bethesda to "fix" or rework PvP. It certainly would help if PvPers had a good reputation with the community, wouldn't it? Maybe acting like it's "I enjoy the challenge of a test of skills" is preferable to "I'm bored! *repeatedly strikes someone in a vendor."
---
Tl;dr: Puppy kicking is mean yo.
---
Of course theres a daily cap.
---
Seems just the same ones on the atoms challenges, or at least same types as well as xp gain.  Chewing gum, taking photos in a group, etc.
---
Because it's not rewarding at all. Legendary enemies are so common and spawn so.predictably it's just another common. I'd really prefer having WAY fewer legendary enemies in the game. Farming legendaries is boring and totally unrewarding. And results in meta builds. From my perspective whole rewards system Bethesda is building is so confusing and broken it's a disaster. Scrips, bullions, caps, tokens, other tokens... People dumping legendaries on the ground after an hour of playtime means whole idea is spoiled and lost its sense.
---
That is an older bug.  I thought that was patched a long time ago. 
---
Fully quit the game and restart and it should go away. I hope.
---
Thank you so much for doing this!
---
I just did another playthrough, this time I sided with the board. Lot of Feels Bad, particularly at the end. But that's a true role playing experience! I love it and agree it's a great start to what could become an incredible series
---
a quest where you &gt;!salvage Motherloads personality from the wreckage!&lt; and then place it into the robot body of your choice from that robot store from the Wayward questline.
---
Boom.
---
“It isn’t perfect, but...”
---
That’s the Bethesda motto.
---
From the look of things from data mining if skip one of the weekly pvp challenges Every week.. it’s only 1500 atoms, skip all of the pvp challenges it’s going to be around 3000 4000 atoms.
---
and the best part is, from the look of things you have to nail all daily and weekly challenges to get all 100 rewards. Miss one and well they do give out some free atoms during the game
---
thats cool congrats
---
 I will sell the common ammo anyways. More my income is for 5.56, 10mm and .45. I hope they let us scrap missiles, mini nukes and 40mm grenades.
---
I went through a punji tunnel unaware that it was supposed to be a trap. The guy waiting on the other end must have been pretty surprised to see a lvl 16 wandering around his hidy hole.
---
If you're on XBOX, I can craft you DP Heavy BOS armour and some weapons
---
Sbiffo, you clearly didn't read or understand what I wrote.
---
I’m on PC :/ , thanks though!
---
Yes I remember that lol. No way I thought. Didn’t even try
---
Motherlode + Weasel. it'll be Fallout 76's Big Daddy and Little Sister.
---
Well, you get an upvote from me, as I find myself with a very similar reaction.
---
For a long time, my favorite part of the game was playing around with my CAMP.  I left the game for several months due to a bug that wrecked CAMP budget, and I only came back when a good friend urged me to give Wastelanders a try.  
---
Now, I've done the main Wastelanders quest, and I am nearly maxed on reputation for both factions. Beyond the reputation dailies, I only play the challenges anymore.  And this is going to make those challenges considerably less rewarding.  
---
Just as I finally break down and get Fallout 1st for a month... I find my incentive to play going quickly away.  The fact that this system replaces atom rewards makes it exceptionally difficult to earn atoms to buy cosmetics.  Now, to get any of the cool enhancements for my CAMP that crop up in the Atomic Shop each week, I'll have to spend real money -- whether through keeping Fallout 1st or by buying atoms, turning the Shop into even more of a cash grab. That doesn't incentivize me to continue. 
---
I'll play the season long enough to get the sink, which I would like for my CAMP.  Beyond that, I expect to cancel my Fallout 1st subscription after my second influx of atoms, which should be around the 4th of July. I will likely once again quit the game entirely shortly after.
---
I think Patch 20, wich is 30th of june
---
This is awesome, thank you for doing this! I'm missing way more plans than I thought!
---
The 30th of June
---
Yeah but remember trade ins get nothing in this game. Legendary sells at 100 on a ranged three star but if I trade in I get 40. I dare say they're not gonna take your 10,000x .38 rounds and give you 10,000 Ultracite 5.56 or whatever. It'll be like a two or three to one ratio, or less, and again be capped also.
---
I feel yours and my excess sale ammo will still be a commodity.
---
Fallout 3 :2277
---
Fallout NV:2281
---
Fallout 4: 2287
---
Oh I totally agree with you. Went all wrong about it the first time to be honest. Ran through the missions to get the end fame gear. Didn’t read terminals or really listen to the holotapes. That’s on my “main” that is a level 161 bloodied/stealth/commando build. Really op and with great weapons and gear. 
---
Now I’m 8 hours in on a new character that is level 8. I made myself some rules to make it challenging and fun while also allowing myself to get out of the chase for the new meta or the next “have to have” weapon. And really enjoy what is already there. And I’m so surprised of all the stuff I’ve missed and I just made it to Morgantown airport from Flatwoods. I guess you can call it role play but I don’t have a clue about what it needs to have to qualify for it. 
---
1. No fast travel (I think this is something everyone should try, can be tedious at first but man, makes you plan accordingly and consider thoroughly where to go next)
---
2. No mutations 
---
3. Run an rifleman/heavy build
---
4. One star legendary equipment only (no bloodied or junkies) 
---
5. Private world only (I know there is whole controversy about fallout 1st, I have the money to spend so I’ll do with it as I please) 
---
6. Read and/or listen to any notes,holotapes/terminal
---
I also gave my character a little bit of a backstory and A personality which I can relate to sometimes but made him have a really black and white outlook on life. 
---
I’m having so much fun doing this. More then I’ve had for the past 110 levels of my “main” character. 
---
Really having to run for the supplies you need, not just fast traveling to a point I know where to find it and back. 
---
There is a whole ocean of content and story there if you slow down and take your time, do a challenging build. 
---
Now if you can’t or don’t want to do that. Take a brake from it. And return when you are excited again.
---
I doubt the vast majority of players are as into camp building as OP.  Just because topics on this sub are popular doesn't mean the average player cares.
---
I also doubt they were surprised by the popularity of camp building or expected it to be a thing outside of workshops, as workshops are by design transitory so it makes no sense to actually build there.
---
But sure, add half walls, roofs and foundations :)
---
I just can't get on board with the numerous "increase budget" requests as the devs had said time and again "we will do this once we are sure it won't damage performance".  Performance is more important than anything related to camps.
---
I don't mind you doing this but as punishment you should have to walk from crater to foundation naked while we all follow you and chant shame while throwing objects at you.
---
Yes they still drop. I got a bloodied , furious, anti armor and two shot all last week. And all I want is a bloodied fixer. Lol.
---
Thank you guys
---
Still not worth it doing it there at level 20-24. You'd spend so much ammo it makes no sense.
---
Probably, but also it could be next season as well.
---
Nobody is going to thank you for not shooting them. Nobody is going to go around the server thanking everybody for not taking a workshop. Using your analogy, it’d be the same thing as thanking everybody at the park for not punting your pooch. You don’t know who likes PvP or not until you either shoot them and they shoot back, or if they shoot you first.
---
No problem! If you need any help finding them. Let me know. We have resources and guides
---
Happy bdday lad.
---
As far as I know, it doesn't even carry over from one character to another, one of my friends bought certain items with his main and then had to repurchase them for his secondary, so I highly doubt they transfer between console/PC :(
---
I've been playing the FOnline games since I was a kid, but in the past 6 or so years it's more a case of I pick up one of the latest sessions for a few weeks once or twice a year when I have some spare time and then get bored of it. Then next summer I come back and try it again, or play a different one. I just recently downloaded FOnline reloaded again, last time I played it in like 2013 and it's changed so much since then, there's a new intro sequence I haven't even finished yet. At this point I question whether it's taking breaks or it just became an annual ritual for me to come back and try to remember the good old days when we had 20 people standing around NCR at the same time, waiting for the next suicide bomber or car thief or somebody coming in to show off their power armor
---
yep that's a very damn nice lever there.  15% reload speed is much better on a gun like this that has slow reload speed out of the gate and be is already god tier.
---
Definitely has high trade value for any rifleman build.
---
We dont know whats truly canon ever
---
Ps. Then whenever I just want to dick around I can go to my “main” and do so. Then get back to it.
---
She's the most original character Bethesda has had in a while.
---
This is awesome but what are your hours of operation? Do to my work schedule I'm normally not on until very late / early morning EST.
---
Activision, riot, Blizzard,
---
Hey. I can be flexible. Feel free to drop me a DM and we can work it out.
---
I did not know that you could craft legendary SS armor!!! Haha how did I not know this, thank you so much. Diluted rad away, so that’s what that’s for.
---
I don't care. I don't really take advantage of the weekly or daily challenges as it is.
---
when they add more skins to the fallout 1st tab in the atom shop they are free if you have a current subscription. So far there have not been returns of anything.
---
the XP is great if you can mange it tho...
---
Sounds like scorch beast destruction. However the Yogi are pretty much total destroyers.
---
If you see **IGN**, player is likely on PC, stands for **In Game Name**
---
If you see **GT** the person will be on Xbox **Gamer Tag**
---
**PSN** Person plays on Playstation **Playstation Name**
---
Are you on PC? Seems there are lots more people willing to trade on console. I keep surfing peoples camps and end up buying random plans . As you say, I guess it’s all about finding something that someone wants
---
crude, but effective
---
excellent
---
I really think the irrelevance of most of the near-term choice-making (because reverting save states not an option online) drags the game and makes it feel more grindy. The cosmetic only stuff makes earning any particular piece very strange, and wearing mismatched stuff inconsequential. Some of the magic of Bioshock and Fable come from the fact that your choices in combat and behaviour really transform the world around you and your character. I think every stat choice that could be made physical should be so that the aesthetics become part of the motivation structure. Right now the game feels like it was made for Chinese markets, very numbers and discipline oriented, no real emphasis on creativity.
---
Indeed. The brute force method
---
So your telling me I didn't collect 12500 fusion cells for nothing?  finally!
---
OK. But, when?
---
Chances are, if you went and did a workshop for a daily or something, there's going to be an extremely bored and pissed off griefer child that has nothing better to do than destroy your camp and maybe you because he's mad at whatever and needs to bully and grief to make themselves feel better. Been seeing this a lot lately.
---
Exchange rates are very low according to data mines so don't expect to rely on it for supplies, and if you are a major buyer/seller of ammo don't expect the market to crash overnight. It'll be further limited by daily caps so going AFK won't help much to flood the market more than sitting on a lead mine would. 
---
It'll be most useful for crunching through those worthless ammo types such as 38, 10mm, 40mm, missiles (and iirc Mininukes) giving you a few dozen more useful rounds per day.
---
I never exactly counted on the atoms from them anyway. A few here and there to help with travel expenses. That's about all they're worth they don't really do much of anything for me.
---
Reminds me of Weasel News from GTA lol
---
the last 3 power armour skins where all 1400 atoms, we haven't had 1700 PA skin for 9 months
---
Hamster wheel.  Yep that about sums it up.
---
Yeah, I sell some types. Others just sit clogging up the stash forever. I routinely dump .38, .44, gamma, plasma, railway, harpoon, arrow, crossbow and fusion cell at train stations. Missiles and mini nukes too. Just don’t have infinite stash space to wait for that random once in a blue moon gamma gunner to find me. At least the converter will give another option for coping with less wanted ammo types.
---
Where is your camp, maybe a nuke ?
---
Played 1,2, ,3, NV, 4 and bought 76 on release.
---
I honestly fear to reach endgame since i feel like it has nothing to offer to me. So I just take my time, scavenge the world and haven't finished a quest for weeks. I set up a really inexpensive shop near the wayward, sell a lot of ammo, plans and some chems, wander to other players camps and look for a lvl 50 fixer and unknown plans. I roam around with only a few guns and enough ammo for a pre planned trip, avoid risks and think twice before i start an encounter. Often i just flank enemy camps and avoid the fight. I wear a drifter outfit, a mining helmet (to have my hands free while using a light [realism] and a backpack with an attached shovel (shop outfit, realism. who would leave home without a shovel in a wasteland anyway?).
---
I take it reeeaaalllyy slow, and i like buying my weapons more than farming for legendaries. I live from the bare minimum, my goal is to stay alive in the wasteland and prepare myself for the trouble the next day will throw on me while selling some stuff. The others may try to save the world, i'm just trying to stay alive somehow.
---
Yes such as my "ultralight BOS heavy pocketed combat armour" which for some reason reads as "ultralight combat armour"
---
Do some research then come back and ask this question when you know what to expect
---
thank you so much have had so many problems finding out what i dont have
---
Yeah I have had this happen to me multiple times my turrets hammering at Grahm .. also raiders hang out at my camp and destroy it, but never completely but I suppose possible,
---
Where do you even find a jumbo Mr. Fuzzy?
---
Fortunately I do have the fixer plan but didn’t know it was required for the legendary vendor!!
---
OMG this for sure.
---
1500 atoms in 2 weeks ? Boy you must be a hardcore player. That's about what I get a month, and I still go outta my way to earn those free atoms.
---
I'm currently sitting on 5000 atoms because nothing in the store really appeals to me (yet). I did almost buy the Red Rocket PA tho
---
No, just weekly ones and daily ones.
---
I want that Gatling gun skin, my main weapon is a gatling and the only skin I’ve ever seen for it was the black knight which is... ok?
---
I built my new tiny CAMP near Foundation after descending from my mountain fortress where enemies don't actually spawn. Got bored basically. My OCD about having a perfect base ruined the enjoyment of trading and CAMPs. 
---
Before I was even finished setting up I'd littered the area with L54 Liberator bodies that do surprising amounts of damage to CAMP items despite having such little silly bodies and lasers. It's almost wrecked and I just moved... My tent occupied that spot for weeks and I never saw a single enemy. 
---
So yeah OP it could very well be a mob spot too.
---
Oh no cheaters could get the untradable cosmetics faster than me it’s the end times!!
---
Fix the friends Quest‼‼
---
I don't care.
---
That was a rough estimate. Its probably more like 3 or 4.
---
My turrets also fire on any wandering merchant that visits but luckily they don’t aggro like Grahm.
---
It does help, appreciate the write up. I’ll pickup those perks too
---
Where did it say that they were removing the regular rewards for challenges? I was under the assumption this was an added reward, not a replacement.
---
No! PA skins are 1400 atoms when sold individually and have been since fallout first I know because I subscribed to fallout first and I've bought those skins.
---
Uhhhhh...?
---
I'm on console.xbox. Have a decent rig for gaming but my 9 yr old only uses it for roblox...but yeah it's kinda strange what's valuable on f76.
---
I've played fallout games before I am just asking if it is fun now since it's launch wasn't the greatest, my friends are I are torn apart on getting this or monster hunter world so I was just trying to see if the feedback from this would help me decide
---
purchased items (not atoms and FO1st sub) carry over between the 2 PC launchers.. but not between PC and consoles
---
It’s another option for dealing with ammo, and I like having options, so total win in my book. It gives .38 a reason to exist — to help make something people want to shoot.
---
The problem is that we now almost have to farm legendaries to get modules.  Every new good weapon or armor requires boatloads of them.  If you get 4 in a day, you've done something.  That's two pulls for a decent weapon, which you won't get in the roll you want until about 20-30 pulls most times.  (I spent 150+ to get the ONE leg of ss armor that I needed to complete my set) It is the module requirement that is evil, everything else about the gold grind is tolerable, but barely.  It takes about 15-20 legendary drops to clean out the scrip machine, and then you need to do more events that drop scrip to hit the 200 needed for 4 lousy modules.

No i didn't mean "you" as you personally.

That’s kinda funny that your boy has commandeered your rig and made you into a console pleb. Things we do for our kids eh? :)
---
True. And that's just another reason I think it's all broken, dull and annoying.
---
I have almost 30k...
---
excuse my ignorance but where are people coming up with a "__daily__ cap"  all im reading is that there is a max of the ammopoints in general.
---
the item was also not on the PTS, and the one datamined table i found shows nothing about max points
---
I know I have blue and brown lemme check and let u know
---
We literally have a mod on Nexus to do that.
---
Well to those who haven't invested a lot of time I guess your unaware of the various hidden items thru out the world such as the quantum paint job for power armors . I get your criticism but this isnt and wasnt ment to be a traditional fallout experience just like how different 4 was to previous titles. It is different and thrives with an amazing community even thou I poo poo on newbies a lot this game is great and a season pass with earnable cosmetics is goona be great
---
Theres still probably a considerable amount that play on the Beth launcher; since the whole FO1st subs are not transferrable
---
Exactly.  I like to use silenced weapons.  Covert op, all 3 rifleman perks, sneak 3.  And just strolling around unseen smoking everything.
---
Those little bastards do a lot of damage. I have a bad habit of just brushing them off as liberators are mostky weak but the 54s really sting.
---
Water wheel? ;)
---
Yeah it’s a b**** - hoping they fix it in patch 20
---
You mean people like you who say they do not care but continue to show your ass on the internet??
---
Yea you really showed me.
---
You can purchase them from the same terminal you get the Mr.Fuzzy costume from in Camden Park. Enter from the front and go left. There is a little building with some scorched and a vender bot in front of it. It's inside! 👍
---
Congrats on having $117.40 worth of atoms I guess?
---
The new season only give 1500 atoms for the entire season compared to what we would have gotten from daily and weekly challenges
---
Id get this game it is fun if y'all are just now getting monster hunter world y'all are honestly way to late for that train
---
Knew what?
---
Only rank 5? That's pretty nice.
---
What did u know?
---
Cool I'm glade your a fellow fallout first buddy. FF get an awful amount of undeserved flake on this subreddit and it's ridiculous how jelly people are about it.
---
Right on. Thank you.
---
What platform?
---
I'm on ps4 and have 3 characters and when I buy atom shop things I can build them on all my characters.
---
The only thing that doesn't is the scrap and repair kits they apply only to the character you're logged onto when making the purchase
---
I think you’ll get more replay value on this game than most would like to admit. I think its worth the $20 personally, especially if you’re playing with friends. Sure there are some minor issues, but generally they get resolved. The game isn’t too grindy, and theres a ton of customization from your character, your build, and your base/home. Lots of build opportunities and ways to make due. Beautiful map, and lots of area to explore.
---
Overall I think its a very good option at the price of $20.
---
Well between the four of them, my foundation building 'seedy shed' is about 25% from totally destroyed and they hit it seriously like 3 times between them. Friggin OP as fuck lol
---
Ohhhh! I thought you meant there was something good but expensive in the atomic shop! XD
---
I'm sticking to my guns on the statement that you should be **ashamed**. With all of this being subjective in nature, you're perfectly fine with saying I am incapable of reading just as much as I am saying you're ungrateful **and** entitled.
---
I'm glad you found motivation through the current system. I'm glad that others did too. And you know what? I think people will find motivation with this system as well. I'm being genuine there, too, not facetious.
---
As for where we're both coming from: I've not purchased three copies of the game. I have invested a considerable amount of money in Atoms and purchased various "DLC" and "Con Atom Packs" with things like the Elder's Battlecoat. I'm one of those aforementioned grinders and currently sit at level 304.
---
And as one of your supposed grinders, I find this new SCORE system appealing. I'm looking forward to it **even now**. I pity that you do not, because ultimately Bethesda's going to go forward with it anyway. I do hope that we all find even more enjoyment in **future seasons**, though! I certainly agree with you on that.
---
You also forgot 150 atoms just to skip 1 challenge.. so lame
---
I am.
---
Wow youre so cool for not caring
---
I meant NPC vendors
---
Wait, if you own a workshop people can kill your camp? If that's the case, then that's definitely what happened. I had the Thunder Mountain workshop and a high level guy came and claimed it and annihilated me in one shot. Then he disappeared for a while, and then came back to claim the workshop. I went back to my camp immediately after my second death because I knew I had no chance to defend the workshop from his weaponry, and my camp was completely destroyed.
---
Depends on what you're looking for. Certain vendors can spawn rare plans unique to that merchant such as Graham, the responder bot, the scavenger trader, Phoenix in Watoga, Wallace in Harpers Ferry, some raider vendors will spawn rare camp plans. If you just need to sink some caps there are various vendors in the Whitesprings, though they don't tend to spawn rare items or plans.

I felt like Mean Joe Green in that Coke commercial. By the time I finished typing my message of thanks and that it wasn't necessary he had taken off. He did ask me for a marine wetsuit which I left at my camp hidden and told him where to look but I want to hook up with him and lay some serums and ammo on him...maybe teach him a few shortcuts.
---
Levels 25 to 35 were the toughest for me so when he offered me those I was really touched.
---
IDK I cant open the first
---
the ammo world is about to change.. people gonna be converting that shit yo..
---
🤔 something was off with that. I’ve been caught in a box hut made of em and did nothing while I was crouch. Was funny and could tell the other dude was a bit pissed.   I couldn’t do anything tho but fast travel away.
---
Weasel is my favorite NPC in the game.  I definitely want her as my CAMP ally!  :)
---
With caffine and boostsbyou can regen faster than you can use it.
---
I thought this wasn't possible anymore if you outside of the green zone of a workshop ?
---
I want to visit plan mule 😡🐢
---
The BOS outcast is already in the game. However it isn't traditional but it is the one they later added as a creation club thing. 
---
You get it from level 60 in NW
---
If I could build a camp our of curved concrete and glass, a true modern/brutalist style building, I'd be SO happy.
---
alright, thanks
---
PC
---
Depends on the console.
---
PC is fucked with the hackers. I play PS4 and have enjoyed the thrill of NW but it’s not my cup of tea
---
those rewards are still 60% more interesting than every thing we saw in the atomic shop.
---
If there is anyway to help on the ps4 mule or group I would love to donate plans/time or whatever is needed.
---
You're lvl 50? Ahh you'll be fine.
---
I did the Vault 79 Raid on my Raider character at lvl 35. Wasn't that difficult, well except at the time i didn't have enough ammo (Had one belt of .50 caliber ammo left by the time i got to the end) honestly it was surprisingly easy to say the least. So you won't have any issues at all. 
---
Good luck to you fellow Vault Dweller!
---
i mean there is a event called breach and clear which is when the motherlode resurfaces and you grab the resources that she collected
---
I vouch for this.
---
In addition to these are the 2 faction vendors one in crater and the other in foundation.
---
There is also a vendor in Grafton hidden in a building. If you are leaving the station on the tracks side, head towards town and go towards the more left side road between buildings and the vendor will be in the first building to the left. Sorry if those directions made no sense.
---
Month to month basis. The base ranger outfit is permanent for anybody however the other items are there for the month then they leave.
---
So far nothing has ever come back
---
It's actual what i expected from the new "system".  I am definitely not a fan of it.  Especially because i play less than average thr amount of time most others do.  It looks cool. Nice theme.  But at the end of the day, i will probably just focus on the rest of the game.  I mean, I've been playing since launch, and I've still not launched a nuke.
---
We're the r34son for all this i guess....
---
No.
---
that is because the MMO format is dogshit, and lazy artistically. Whoever thought this IP should be MMO in any way like this should be fired from all games ever - they don't understand fun. (edit) or maybe it just some out-of-touch genX thinking
---
Seems convoluted. 
---
I have my ammo machine that just makes me ammo I need.
---
I'm not gonna go through all this extra effort of needing to save up ammo, deal with ammo currency just to get 20 5.56 ammo. 
---
I can get 200 per hour from my ammo machine so nah, cool idea but nah
---
They are already datamined in the pts and are exactly the ones we have now. That if they don't change them.
---
Also worth not modding the weapons. Its nice to repair them but modding them really does add unnecessary (For the buying process at least) info to the title
---
Fuck yea that’s why I love explosive bait
---
if you are in a "group" it will not work at all. I heard the new group finder puts you in a "group" even when solo while waiting to fill, and I know that group perks worked in a "group" even if the other person logged off (as long as they did not quit to menu)  not sure if the later was ever fixed
---
Its pretty bad from the leaks. 
---
160 10mm for 20 5.56, some are way worse
---
I run adrenaline at at least 3pts on all my toons.. as a vats user I also run gun-fu at 2pts.
---
-eta: since mobs are always so group oriented it seems like a waste not to run adrenaline at some level
---
Some of the new random human vendors can have it as well
---
Yes! Lookin forward to that chicken house as well
---
Happens to me sometimes. Not sure why it does it but all I do is restart my application.
---
Plans &amp; rare items mostly
---
Had mine stocked with Nukashine since I got it. Love coming back to camp to find 2-3 missing, always gives me a little giggle.
---
As of yesterday, no
---
There is no end to the grind, not when one must buy and learn EVERYTHING!  Plans are precious.
---
I've a few I never bothered opening, if you had added a zero then maybe dodgy but 10 is nothing, enjoy the gift.
---
Bethesda could definitely use some of the assets used at Ohio River Adventures for a fishing/docks aesthetic bundle. Let’s just hope at this point.
---
As of today...doubtfully
---
If they also make energy weapons worth using, I'd love to have more.
---
1. Wrong. A character can be relevant by mention, like the whole questline where we look for the overseer. All the info and stuff we get through those shape the story, while house is simply mentioned. They could simply have changed what was written on the terminal a bit, and leave out house, and nothing would have been affected. Removing the overseer would affect the story quite a lot tho.
---
2. Me not knowing exactly when and where we hear about Roger in 76 has nothing to do with the rest. I mean why should i not be able to know something about 1 certain character, just because i don't remember clearly where i heard about another one? Saying i'm not familiar enough with the game because of it is simply, Excuse my choice of words, bullshit. Not knowing 1 fact does not mean i can't know a 1000 others.
---
But please, go on, put words in my mouth, like you claim i argue that they have to be physical characters in the game to be relevant, even tho i have never said that.
---
As of tomorrow, there’s a greater chance of New Vegas getting an official remaster than you getting banned.
---
I'd have just spend my atoms on camp stuff. I don't buy P.A, repair kits, scrap kits, Outfits etc. So I'm just missing out on saving for camp items. Thats my main issue
---
well that will be good for the people who use 556 as currency.. lol
---
Fly bat thing! I’m rolling! Ha!
---
I've done everything besides from those stupidly long lifetime challenges. I was really hoping the pass would be good to give me an incentive to play. I really want to play but there's literally nothing for me to do now
---
It would be nice if they brought it back for atoms for fallout 1st members, but that would encourage people to sub a couple of months out of the year
---
I can use my ammo machine and get 200 in no time
---
As much as children in Bethesda games tend to be annoying and same-facey, I want to give a home to that poor girl who lost Lucy. RIP Lucy. :(
---
Okay thanks
---
I'd advise only one, because when I get shined, I make sure I show my appreciation by clicking it several more times and to the folks that put good hooch in theirs, thank you.
---
ZAX is a prototype. I believe JHE is a more advanced version
---
if the datamine holds true, you can!  iirc nukes and missiles are turned in in sets of 3, i forgot what 40mm was
---
New vegas? Not a story Bethesda would tell you...
---
lmao thanks I think we'll get this since most of us enjoy the fallout franchise games we have previously played, thanks
---
This is a fantastic idea! I'm on PS4 so I can't access it, but one day cross platform will be a thing!
---
Why don't you spend them, they are not even real until you do, just pixels on the screen.
---
I certainly hope not I traded for a few hundred of them and opened them all 😐
---
How does one ‘tea bag’ in a video game?
---
did not fix it, gonna reinstall and test it, thanks
---
edit: try it again and yeah its back, weird, still gonna reinstall just for peace of mind
---
&gt; There is also a vendor in Grafton hidden in a building
---
This vendor sells plans for BOS mods for heavy combat armor, which is absolutely ridiculously strong all things considered. I'm sure there's better stuff end game but this armor has been serving me extremely well.
---
No need to scream already. We don't know how many dailies we'll have to complete. What if they are 20 x day and 1 in NW,it would be minimal.
---
tldr;RAGE
---
SWEET BABY JESUS, stop introducing points and alternate currency for every new feature (that you guys didnt even god damned come up with on your own). Who the fuck is running this clown-show. My guess based on every new feature ever announced this way: In a week after most people have it, nobody will bother because its easier to do what people do now and drop their useless garbage piles and buy what they need for caps. How much do you want to bet it has a daily cap/max cap and will only allow you to convert in insanely imbalanced ratios. 
---
Also as a side note, the fucking water wheel STILL WONT GOD DAMNED SPIN. IT WORKED FOR LESS time THAN IT HAS EXISTED IN THE GAME.
---
Priceless
---
I want to visit. I'm ZeddtheRED. Great idea
---
It is borderline insane that ranks take an hour minimum.
---
PS4 ((
---
Says June 30th
---
Once.
---
Set up a trade with a guy on the lfg. My BE lmg for his something or other. Don't even remember. It was before I had my come to Jesus moment with LMGs. 
---
I'm a trusting soul so I set my price to zero first. I knew the risk, but this guy seemed cool enough. He takes it and bails. Doesn't respond to messages. Pretty typical scam, really. 
---
Reported him. Outed him on Reddit. Never heard from or saw him again.
---
I pretty much exclusively buy from vending machines, now. Except for a couple of friends, I don't even enter a trade menu with people.
---
That's not because of scammers. I just hate people asking for my stuff all the time.
---
true, but I'd rather stock pile ammo and convert as needed, ammo eats up so much of my carry weight because I have ammo reducers that make it impossible to store it at full weight in my stash so I think there is a real need even when converting becomes a thing.
---
Also, MODUS terminal for the camp please and thank you.
---
Well i have to admit this a wayyyy better outcome then the amount of 'Battle points' you get in Call of Duty: You can spend up to $150 to rank up to 100 and it'll only give you around 400 BP which is dumb as hell.
---
So I'll take 1,500 Atoms over that any day.
---
What is this pass? Where is it? Is it only on the pts or is it public now? I can't keep up
---
First time I experienced this, I woke up on a raft on a lake surrounded by... I think skeletons and traffic cones?
---
Second time it was the Skyrim easter egg.
---
Good times.
---
my sweet summer child ...
---
Oh yeah, forgot about that trick.
---
Fell for that one, too. Once. Luckily, I was only looking for 10 flux. So that's all I lost. Was like 1000 caps... so not a big deal for me.
---
But, it taught me a lesson.
---
A couple of positive points
---
1) Heavy weapons can be ammo hogs so every bit counts. I'm sure folks will still buy ammo for their gauss minis, etc
---
2) The rate of exchange isn't phenomenal so it isn't going to be that bad.
---
3) Gives melee oriented players something to do with all the ammo they find so will help them get better ammo to sell to folks
---
so glad I dont have a hoarding problem.. lol
---
Hairless vulture bird!
---
Have fun dont trust the nukashine
---
You said he’s not in the game ***except by mention alone*** so he’s not relevant. 
---
And if the Overseer can be relevant by mention, then Robert House can be relevant by mention. Now, the **degree** of relevance can be different.  But we’re talking about a simple logic flag (yes/no), not a quantity variance indicator. 
---
Example:  Harry Potter is a extremely major relevant character in the first book. His cousin is less relevant, but still is relevant. And the same goes for many other minor characters. 
---
Nicolas Flamel (the creator of the Philosopher’s Stone) is not actually in the story. He is only mentioned. Yet he is directly relevant to the book and the plot line. 
---
Nicolas Flamel is relevant to the first Harry Potter book in the same way that Robert House is relevant to Fallout 76. Neither story has the same essential framework without them. The story would have to be significantly altered if they were not in loved in the events of the prologue.
---
Pre-Wastelanders, the Overseer could have been removed as well. She could have been replaced with directives from Vault-Tec. Or the player could have done exactly what the Overseer did and followed pretty much the same path line. Discover what happened in Appalachia and try to make it better. 
---
If your argument is that removing the references to the character wouldn’t have changed the story, then this also applies. 
---
It’s not a question of if it’s relevant or not. It’s a question of **HOW** relevant it is. 
---
The Overseer is more relevant than Robert House. That’s never been in debate. But the **DEGREE** of relevance is not cited by the rules of this sub.
---
I suggest you go find out how Roger Maxson is connected to Appalachia and Fallout 76 before you dismiss him as ‘non-relevant’.  Again, your lack of familiarity is a strong indication that your knowledge is inadequate to make such a determination.
---
Queen of the bat cave!
---
This happened during Fasnacht for me a few times.
---
Checkout your hdmi cables if they may have wiggled loose
---
Looking at the rewards, it looks like they're "worth" more than you would have got in atoms, but the kicker is that you have to actually want those items for them to hold any value.
---
As you say, if you're interested in none of it, this is a nerf. If you are interested in all of it, its a buff. Most people will be somewhere in the middle.
---
For clarity there's only actually about 4-5 items that interest me. Two are #4 and #5, and two are #99 and #100.
---
So for me I'll get two items I want quickly, then have a several month grind through skins I dont care about, to get the door and the planetarium I want.
---
Lol I feel it and thank you brother!
---
Nah. In the enclave bunker you can find a terminal with Eden and Modus having a conversation though.
---
Its a "battle pass" 100 tiers of 'rewards' to earn.
---
It’s simple, having destructible set pieces adds to the processing needs. A single wall or a single object has more values associated to it (HP, etc.) along with more graphical states (normal and broken) along with animations as well. Nothing in games comes for free (processing wise) and destructible environments are no exception.
---
Well Turtle reckons the Medics effect has been fixed on pts. Or he did at least
---
Ok sounds stupid but try this, take all your Bobby pins and put them in your stash. Then go to a lock and interact with it. Exit the lock and get all your Bobby pins and try again.
---
Not to be argumentative but COD gives you 1500 too. 
---
Fallout and COD both give the same amount of currency and also cost the same to fully max out. 
---
COD costs money to buy into though so that's one upside of this one
---
That takes a lot of explosive bait. like alot. like 50.
---
Did they finally fix the bug where the punch bowl dispensed Items from your stash? I've also wanted to put in Nukashine but have been super hesitant to remake my punch bowl
---
Canon endings tend to be the ‘good’ endings. Like in FO3 when you sacrifice yourself to start project purity.
---
Birthday twins unite!  
---
It's also the day Michael Jackson died, so there's that.
---
If they didn't want other people being able to take your crap, you wouldn't drop it at all
---
You don’t say?
---
those events didn’t push my cap count anywhere close to 10,000
---
Huh, you make a very fair point. I respectfully retract my original statement. Apologies for that.
---
Yeah I'll admit one fantastic thing about Fallout 1st is the 1,650 Atons each month so that definitely beats Call of Duty's 'Battle Pass' by a long-shot.
---
But yeah: Thank you for the clarification. Appreciate you being civil about it.
---
shotguns with the perk that give 30% chance to cripple.
---
True that.
---
Never been scammed by someone on Reddit. 
---
Once I thought I was getting scammed... the guy up and disappeared after getting my weapon... but they stayed in touch with me afterwards and we met up an hour later. Turned out their Xbox live account had expired at that exact moment.
---
Ding ding ding. This is exactly why they did it.
---
Ummm it's not 1500 per 3 months......
---
You get 1650 atoms per month. So big LOL there.
---
Why wait for the second influx of atoms though? Won't they charge you a second time for those atoms?
---
They sure as hell didn't waste time in putting out the season pass, but of course they announced that Colossal problem and the legendary perks would be delayed.  The season pass is an attempt at monetization, I don't care what anyone says to the contrary.   I understand that this is an online game and that monetization is part of it.   
---
But it's just really offensive to me that they would delay new endgame content for a game that desperately needs it, while at the same time rushing to put out a season pass aimed at monetization.  It's just so off putting to me.  It's because of this kind of stuff that I have not been able to log on for about a month now.  This kind of stuff has really been sucking the joy out of the game for me.
---
I have them in my vendor.
---
GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR 
---
I’ll be on in a couple of hours.
---
I feel like I missed something as well
---
That actually makes a lot of sense.
---
I'll be honest in Fallout 3 I don't think really understood Eden's motives properly but I'll give credit to 76. That conversation between him and Modus as well as the machinations Vault 51 counterpart (I understand it's not exact same AI but rather an enhanced or updated version of ZAX) does lay the parallels on pretty damn thick. It's a cool tie in.
---
I only wish 76 did that more often with the other vaults. Hopefully 63 and 96 will be unlocked one day.
---
Something is weird those duper’s are up to something I know it maybe a new duping glitch was found ?
---
Studio 58 inside the Whitespring has a bunch of camp plans only available there.  Mostly the same various items that fill the resort.
---
There's a lake?
---
Fallout or not, it’s still an online game as a service. Events and reward grinds are what fill the time between story expansions. That’s core online DNA stuff. It’s why even though the SBQ is the end boss in the main campaign we get to keep nuking her house over and over and over. At some point, every online game pushes players to a tipping point — am I still having fun or has my reward FOMO turned this into a job? When it becomes a job, time to take a break or walk away altogether. Sounds like you may be reaching that tipping point?
---
"I didn't like them, therefore no-one should like them."
---
FTFY. 👍🏻
---
Hmm maybe, this is why we can’t have nice things. Just waiting for “vending and display cases are disabled!”
---
Also you posted this a couple of times
---
It's not enough for a PA skin..... But there's free ones....but I don't like those ones. 
---
Holy effin whine.
---
It allows you to get water in places like the 3rd floor of your mansion or in you're glitched underground bunker.  It's the only way to get water without a water source or dirt.
---
Without stating what it is (don't want to spread more and people who already know about it know about it)
---
Sadly there is an item in game ATM that can damage a camp regardless of whether you are in pvp or not.
---
Bunker wall pieces would be amazing.
---
&gt;First, it's not free. You have to put in the time to get it.
---
When people mean free i'm sure they literally mean it as in "no cost" rather than free as in "effortless".
---
But i agree; personally i'll take te ghilie skins, since i play NW often, every advantage is good to get.
---
I see I don’t know how that happen tbh
---
Happened to me. If you have a friend and they can guide you to a load door sometimes that helps. Otherwise you have to restart the game
---
Bye? 
---
Slightly less atoms but more free stuff is really brining out the whine today.
---
PvPers have dealt with this glitch for ages. We have been practially begging for bethesda to fix it, with the pve casual community not caring or in some instances opposed to bethesda “wasting their dev time” on a pvp bug. 
---
But now that it affects what you guys do, everyone is up in arms against bethesda. It’s honestly pathetic.
---
I have fixed that issue but seriously why does everyone have to suffer cause of duper’s  ?
---
How do you get it
---
Right? It’s annoying the whole is punished for a few 😞
---
Still need a fixer plan?
---
My favourite whiner argument. 
---
If you think first solves problems? Go cut your neighbours lawn for 10 bucks a month, get the scrap box, and 20 days later let me know when you realize it simply stores thousands of the types of junk no one uses.
---
These are upset kids that will watch and wait for someone to take a workshop, destroy your camp while you're waiting for the claim to pop for the credit and rewards (because you're flagged for PVP at that point), then immediately travel to the workshop to kill you. You get ZERO notice that your camp is under attack (thanks Bethesda!), so you can't do anything about it.  
---
So much for that chill community vibe.
---
Too bad? Whining over which free stuff you get is hilarious.
---
That’s why we can’t have a stable economy in this game just look at the t r a d e I n g sub look how ridiculous the prices have became then duper’s dupe things that aren’t useful or rare plans making them useless
---
Awesome. Hopefully we can get a PS4 one going
---
Yea but they did have to remake an entire instanced npc dialog system as well as rework the lighting system.
---
Hey. It is possible for sure. We would need a PS4 leader to own the project. If you want to be involved, DM me and you can join the discord
---
I did check it, they are brand new, I have this ps4 for like a month now, It scared me a lot I thought that the console had died
---
30th, they said it last week.
---
If you can wait a bit, I can craft one for you.
---
My PS4 is a refurbished so I thought it died as well!
---
No, it might be a server connectivity issue.
---
When it happened to me I just restarted everything.
---
Way more time than any other pass system... Just not true. Try again. 
---
Also unlike other pass systems, you don't have to buy into it to be eligible for most rewards....
---
I'm here to offset whines all week. Let me know.
---
I have nothing against PvP and i used to spend a lot of time in survival mode back in the day.  There's many reasons why it should be fixed.
---
lol, but she is like a huge bat, I can't remember the name tho
---
Ugh jfc whyyyy
---
Yup, while your claiming a workshop you're PVP flagged regardless if you have pacifist toggled on. It's what these twatty griefers live for, because they're bored with everything else so they feel the need to pick on people doing dailies/weeklies to make themselves feel better. Bethesda needs to leave the PVP for NW.
---
Is that really just a random legendary? I've been saving up candy because I thought there was going to be some rare reward specific to the S.M.A.R.T. machine.
---
If you're limited to only X ranks a day coupled with the atom nerf... oh boy, this sub will explode with force of a tousand suns.
---
Hey sounds good. Would you mind DMing me with your IGN so I can remember to add you back if it doesn't show on the social menu. That way I don't forget
---
No one seems to want to make the point you just did. 
---
Other pass systems almost always require you to buy in to get access to all the rewards per level
---
We play on Xbox so it's possibly a bug for him maybe, his characters seem to have really bad luck with bugs, he gets just about every one 😂
---
I don't have an alt so I can't confirm 100%, but he definitely has that issue.
---
Excellent 👍 I DMd you
---
Yes and on consoles but I guess players are getting bored on all platforms
---
Given that its likely gonna be popular i doubt it wouldn't be an atx item. It'd be smart for them to put it there.
---
Wow interesting, thought this was a thing of the past. Thx
---
Thats the mark of someone who has genuine feedback on the game, as it shows they like it and want to keep playing it but x issue is getting in the way.  
---
Same for me at the moment, im currently taking a break until seasons is out for the same reason as OP
---
Slightly ? you hilarious
---
I would remove tenderizer, use lifegiver, and put both those points into strongback instead. Just my 2 cents.
---
A lot of them were also Halloween rewards disguised as unique WS plans since it seems a lot players don't know about this vendor.
---
Typically online games have endgame content and updates to in-game rewards to keep players going. So you're right that game loops can wear thin due to the grind, and you're right that people can have tipping points, but you're also ignoring the thrust of my whole argument.  
---
If Bethesda had added endgame content or updated the in-game rewards in significant ways in the last 1.5 years, there wouldn't be this issue with seasons IMO. As it stands the game is bone dry and our two primary means of acquiring new stuff are through a cash shop and a hamster wheel, which is not the norm in my online experience, certainly not for a developer/publisher as big as Bethesda.
---
Scorchbeast and scorchbeast queen. Lol
---
Legends
---
I'd rather have delayed better content then rushed to production. Beside I'm sure the atom shop thing is mostly graphic designers and less programming making it already inherently easier to push out.
---
Carry weight is not an issue for me really. I'd rather put it to use in damage perks than qol! Thanks for the suggestion though, appreciate you taking a look.
---
I add stocks to pistols (if applicable) because rifles tend to sell faster and for better prices.
---
I’d help but I’m on PS4. Wish it was cross platform
---
I can hook you up
---
i'll send you an invite. also no need to pay
---
GT: rammadeus
---
Its more for management when you're already slightly over/under 20% health. Not so much for going from full health to 20%. 
---
I currently use the radiation trap to adjust my radiation my camp, but it has to be repaired every so often and requires a switch to activate. The barrel will just be more convenient for me.
---
I have a few hundred hours in the game, and I'd like you to name one camp item in the world I don't have or haven't seen. :P 
---
I've been playing since launch with some breaks, and I've followed all the updates.
---
I have an unyielding build with an almost full set of combat armor that utilizes the BoS and ultra-light mods, it is pretty awesome. Once I get a good left leg it'll be the full set, then I'll be after heavy combat armor to do the same with. Them good heavy combat armor legendary rolls are hard to find on the market. Lol
---
I think it might unlock via having *earned* 10,000 caps 
---
Or maybe you just got a lucky bug? Guess it be debatable calling it *lucky*
---
I think it's for the AP it gives. Both immediately give 50 AP upon drinking. So it's pretty useful for doing jetpack things
---
Edit: whoever downvoted this: why? Are you a bot that only downvotes to lower karma? Or did you not like my theory? Or is it because you gain satisfaction from it? Whoever you are, I wont find you, I wont seek revenge with my lackluster set of skills, but I will make stupid comments to karma whore on other subs
---
Nice! I’ll have to try that out, thank you!
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
Large tool bad stash box and I mean the stacked one not the big a little one
---
Oh that would make sense
---
Both also have a 150 HP heal, one has -300 RADs and the other one +25% RAD resistance. But I'm guessing the main draw is the 50 AP
---
there's a spot where motherlode takes you back to the deep in the mire? I've done all of the motherlode quests I thought but what part is this from?
---
Standard, I'll have to get the plan.
---
Marsupial for the carry weight and jump.  If you don't have the backpack and don't want to spend your caps and scrap on a jet pack.  In the end you want both plus a few others of course.
---
Junkies?
---
I'm glad you brought up the factions because that was a major disappointment for me that contributed directly to this situation. I was all for grinding out some rep to get some funky new items, but when Wastelanders released all I saw was a well and some planters... 
---
That was a huge let-down. I had expected I'd finally have some in-game rewards to earn, at least a dozen or two for the first factions, but as you say, nope, the vast majority of cosmetics ended up on the cash shop and now a handful in the seasons. 
---
I will never understand why it's been so hard for Bethesda to add new outfits and camp objects to this game. It's the last thing I expect to see throttled coming from a developer attempting to create a GaS model.
---
All the above effects x4 with Cola Nut perk
---
Probably but why not just use royal jelly taffy ? my fasnact collection has already got me 2k of the stuff and it’s unlitmited ap for a couple seconds
---
Im not against it but kinda liked a vampire thing?
---
Even opening them in the thousands to tens of thousands is safe. The only people that *might* get banned are the ones, and there are, that have or opened presents in the MILLIONS
---
If you're really gonna use a melee weapon without speccing into melee you want something that'll wreck. Like an instigating pa dcg. To one shot most trash enemies like muties &amp; marshmallow ghouls you need 450+ damage in a single swing.
---
Yeah once you get 5k Halloween candy you get a random legendary. I’ve only gotten two stars but I imagine it’s possible to get a three star too.
---
Nuka cola is powerful, been good utility items since launch
---
Vampires is unnecessary, especially in PA.
---
Bloodied heavy wep PA is pretty good too just fyi
---
Well as mentioned in this thread there's a perk that boosts all effects of nuka cola by 4x, they are also plentiful.
---
Well according to the roadmap there was 7 things coming in "summer"  
---
Fasnacht - Completed after a delay  
---
Legendary Perks - Delayed  
---
A Colossal Problem - Delayed  
---
Seasons - Coming 30th  
---
Public Teams - Coming 30th  
---
Community Challenges - Probably the BoS Event thats in PTS  
---
Meat Week - No Dates yet
---
&gt; I'd rather have delayed better content then rushed to production
---
Uh uh. No.  Not this time.  The argument was that Wastelanders would be delayed, but once Watelanders was done, they would have a framework in place to build upon and from then on it would be quicker and easier to roll out new content. I knew that wasn't true of course,
---
And delayed content= better content has already  proven itself to be false.
---
They've not fixed the bug where people can steal from your vending machine so probably not!
---
I’m perfectly aware of that but after awhile you only start getting one harpoon instead of multiple, at least it was that way the last time I used my harpoon gun.
---
I shall gladly admit i should have worded that one phrase differently, but you're still wrong. You literally compare the main quest line with a minor mentioning of a character, but that's not the same thing. 
---
Removing the overseer = no main quest.
---
The same can't be said about house, because he's only mentioned as a minor piece of lore for the sake of mentioning him. It adds nothing to the game, other than "oh Nice, i know that name" because he's not relevant to the game.
---
He's not relevant to what we do in 76, or how we do it. He's simply the creator of some robots, that's all. Again, i get that he is super relevant for the franchise, but not as an individual character in 76. He literally adds nothing to the game.
---
Yea I've got it, hehe.
---
Here's the thing: The base game had a good number of items. I played consistently for months after release, got just about every camp item one could get from either exploring, doing events, claiming workshops, and purchasing from vendors. And then... twelve months of virtually nothing being added to extend that fun and rewarding gameplay cycle. 
---
This is the whole point. It's not even just about veterans in the sense of beta players like me. It only takes about 4-5 months before a player will have earned most of what the base game has to offer, which means even many of the new Wastelander players will start to get bored in the coming months, and we have no indication that Bethesdsa is going to stop focusing almost entirely on the cash shop for new rewards. 
---
This makes for a pretty garbage experience where they're fishing and we're on the hook.
---
How do u get to this vendor
---
I see now but why are people wanting so much like I know there’s an xp glitch at the moment but this is strange
---
It’s really just a hit or a miss with that event. On public servers I sometimes only get one or two per wave, but sometimes I get 6 or 7. Most of the time it’s one or two though on public.
---
That's the debate I'm having internally.  
---
The timing is a bit obnoxious for me, as the only thing other than the challenges that I play for anymore -- the reputation dailies, which I play for the same reason as the challenges: to unlock items I want to build in CAMP -- are going to max out within two days of my Fallout 1st renewal, which is within two days of when this "Season" is supposed to start.  
---
So do I want to hold onto the subscription and get the atoms from it with the intent of doing some cool final things with my CAMP before I leave? Or just cancel Fallout 1st now and save myself $13 with the understanding I'm not going to be playing the game long enough to enjoy anything I get with those Atoms?
---
Yeah I see what you're saying. Not sure whether to just swap out for lifegiver then for a little more tankiness and pop ironclad back in when using Chinese stealth. Think I just need to create a new character because I really want to try out some other weapon types, but there isn't much room for that within the limits of perk points.
---
Buy them with caps.  Either faction has them but you need to increase your reputation to unlock them all. They should be available pretty early in the rep grind though.
---
This is brilliant! After looking through each item individually for its mods, I am shy on two plans (sledgehammer heavy searing sharp rocket and walking came spiked) as well.as the two healing salves for.CB and mire) and the raider protective lining.. but would love to meet the mule to cross reference once you get set up on Xbox!
---
 I also have some scarce plans available for the mule if you want them they're yours for free. The pursuit of completion is greater than the pursuit of caps :)
---
I doubt there's a specific glitch besides maybe wall clipping and getting to places you aren't suppose too with the jetpack and being at a high enough height. But other drugs can do the job
---
Doubt there's a XP, dupe, or any other *dangerous* glitch that involves two specific colas. But who knows
---
Ok I want to know about how to unlock them 
---
That bundle is nice. I built a huge wrap-around porch. Just get it. 
---
You can use foundations and floors with picket fences, too.
---
I have a bloodied 50 cal i guess i can just move from perception and agility into luck and strength
---
Fantastic. Thanks for the reply. If you would like to help with the XB1 mule, I will need to link you up with them. The best bet is to join the discord. DM me if you want to help :)
---
Not exactly a worthwhile tradeoff. Spending the most part of a year for mediocre gameplay - lasting a week at best. Leaves a sour taste.
---
Damn straight!
---
What do you mean
---
I'm always up for more camp items, and I'm glad to see some xp boosters that dont cost atoms. I go through so many cranberry relish.
---
Are you on Xbox? I'll make you one for free. It won't be legendary of course.
---
The raiders vendor straight across from the crater core entrance sells them inside a broken off part of the space station.  At foundation it is one of the Sunny bots in the food trucks, the one closest to the bullion machine.
---
Makes too much sense, so naturally it won't happen.
---
Alas I don't use discord, however my GT is Badgerist, feel free to pass it on to the relevant members and I'll be happy to bring in my own plan mule to share from
---
I was just starting to spec my character over to a bloodied build but then I got a Junkies Explosive 15% Combat Rifle from one of my allies quest. So now I guess I’m a junkie. I know it’s not the best weapon in FO76 but it’s by far the best weapon I got.
---
I honestly want an ancestor of dogmeat, or dogmeat himself/herself
---
Just do the dailies for either faction. As your rep increases it unlocks them.  Pretty sure the second rank of rep unlocks everything except the compound bow plan.
---
So more than 40 hours of dedicated play for a 60 dollar game weird it is almost like the only gamea2 that have more than 40 hours of game play are procedurally generated survival games , and what your saying is free content you have to play to get or open your wallet if you dont have time to get it is bad hmm weird I never see people complain about free content as much as this community
---
I’ll be waiting with my nine iron.
---
Then keep doing what you've been doing. No one is obligated to use it. I dont know who the people are that pick up missiles and mini nukes though. Ive dropped 40mm at the start of a session and theyve still been there at the end of it. Theres a lot of ammo in circulation that only a tiny number of players actually use. Most of it vanishes into the ether when the person who drops it logs out
---
I personally like it a lot. It’s the only set I use ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I'm not from the states either lol. I just wouldn't want to get real life drama involved into a game I escape in to?
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I gave it a try a couple different ways (with perk cards &amp; without) but no luck.
---
I’m goin to say annoyed by it, why not keep the current system and add the season on top, why add a season system at all (I hate the season design in general and the fact that it keeps getting added to games I play is starting to annoy me) just add the loot in the game with some other way of acquiring it. Maybe make it a reward for ally quests so you have to rotate ally’s around or something.
---
Okay but hey it’s more stuff, now I can get like 
---
* maybe 15? New camp items I won’t use because I’m at max budget, 
---
* script that will probably go to waste because I’ll probably be close enough to max to waste some 
---
* power armor skins I won’t use because power armor is worse than regular armor with legendary effects.
---
* gille skins I won’t use because I’ll just wear regular clothes over them or I don’t have decent Legendary’s for the weapon skins in particular. 
---
* and a bunch of scrap from crates that wouldn’t fit in my stash so I would have to sell it immediately. (Yay Scrap box take my money Bethesda)
---
* and a small amount of caps that I can make in a day with 1 water purifier in my camp (just replace them with gold bullion)
---
And now I’ll be earning less atoms overall. The only reason I’m not steaming is because I’m sitting on a stockpile of atoms (something I imagine several players are experiencing and Bethesda knows this, probably want to empty out peoples reserves a bit) because Bethesda won’t put anything I want in the shop. Even though most of what I want is stuff that used to be there but was vaulted. 
---
(And you know damn well that ammo converter is going to glitch. Probably going to either eat your ammo or it’s going to be used for a dupe and get shut down till they fix it)
---
I originally bought it just for the fences but overall I think it's pretty worth it.
---
So stop dieing if you don't want to lose your junk, it's working as designed.
---
Yeah I expected it would be a late drop. Im pleasantly surprised by how early its available
---
May be a dumb question but where are people getting the figures from for obtainable atoms in the new S.C.O.R.E system, is there a list of rank rewards somewhere that I've missed.
---
&gt;this isnt and wasnt ment to be a traditional fallout experience
---
No it wasn't, and it was a disastrous mistake.  The developers themselves realized this which is   why they decided to add human NPCs more than a year after launch.
---
I dunno man.  "It's not enough to buy the one I want to actually use, but they give me a bunch of shit that I couldn't care less about, so that's OK!"  Doesn't quite check out.
---
Always use a courier for a multi-item trade
---
I consider it an essential purchase if you like camp building.
---
It happens to me all the time. Trying to solve. Anyone else solve it?
---
Probably the opposite actually. Both these are used by junkies pvpers so they can spam more sodas while not dying to rads. Theyre probably eating thru their duped stash and gotta hit the market to try and get more
---
Insider information right here ppl. Gotta dev in the thread. It was merely a suggestion don’t get em in a twist or over think it bud.
---
I tried putting a camp down on the top of that pylon a few weeks ago and nothing was placeable. Couldn't even place anything on the ground. I always thought the camp boundary went all the way down to the ground if you placed it on a cliff. I was so bummed out.
---
I paid $80 for this game, we're not all Americans. And I don't measure games based on monetary value, I assess them based on how good they are and how good they continue to be. That's the relationship between a consumer and a seller. 
---
Bethesda wants me to pay more money-- atom shop and sub and now season pass-- and I want them to ensure the game stays good and continues to grow.
---
No this isnt disastrous , disattrous implies this game will have ended its franchise it is so weird that everyone forgets worse games when game media gets involved yes it was bad but they are fixing it
---
Rotating wall decor to give things a slight tilt would be nice as would hanging string lights on walls. 
---
Windmills need alot less restrictions too plus its the  biggest generator and easiest target so why is the power rating so low and where's the raider ones the plans should have been there.
---
Also this item cannot be placed because its floating needs to go away
---
When is this out?
---
If anything it should help ammo sales, people who run commando and heavy gunner need alot of ammo and will buy your spare random ammo to convert.
---
Just a little PSA, It seems to only snap properly if there is a floor piece above the shelf.
---
For some reason, the contemporary porch and the roof pieces don't seem to work as easily. Part of this I believe is due to how much lower the contemporary porch roof sits. I have come up with a workaround:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/hKImMn3](https://imgur.com/gallery/hKImMn3) 
---
This is still super awesome and a very welcomed discovery!
---
Edit: I figured out how to mount the flag to the contemporary porch album added, I also believe I figured out why flags have to snap to walls.
---
&gt;When people mean free i'm sure they literally mean it as in "no cost" rather than free as in "effortless".
---
If you're spending your time, that is not "no cost". It costs your time. Which you could spend doing something else.
---
I've heard of couriers in game. How does that work? I don't trade with other players very often because I'm always scared of getting scammed.
---
Check the 5 locations in Watoga.
---
*Edit: added info for you and others. *
---
There are five power armor spawn locations in Watoga. Four can be accessed without any fight assuming you’ve done the Mayor For A Day quest.
---
* One is in the center of Watoga by the downed vertibot. 
---
* One is on the roof adjacent the civic center, also by a downed vertibot. Climb the stairs to reach the roof of the civic center, then cross over to the adjacent building.
---
* One is in the bus terminal behind a locked door (level 3 hacker or level 3 picklock). 
---
* One is on the roof of Watoga Emergency Services building which requires killing a few baddies to reach it. You could skip them if you are fast/sneaky. One of the enemies could be a legendary.
---
* The last is on the roof of the high school.
---
Note that not all locations will spawn or if they do it is not guaranteed to be T-60. If its not the type you want then don't take it.  Server-hop and run the route again after checking the locations.
---
Motherlode. . . requests causal reply.
---
On the marketplace subreddit you can call for a courier.
---
Well yea... because we earn cosmetics directly without needing to buy them now
---
Id be fine with there just being something more useful I can do with 40mm, missiles, mini nukes and the other bits and pieces of ammo I accumulate over the course of a session. I can just dump it into that and get something i might use out of it rather than just dropping it on the ground or taking up stash space waiting for someone to take it out my vendor. The limits will mean some will still stay in circulation too. No doubt when I have it there will be aspects I wish were better about it but it seems at least "useful"
---
Lucky you, this is my first and only ever BFFR I found 
---
http://imgur.com/a/fewtbFb
---
Might be worth temporarily moving Camps for the sake of more build budget. I believe it was discovered that there was a budget increase when Wastelanders came out?
---
Bethesda and gear box are literally the only people that ever develop games with a significant replay loop to them that dont ask for a mandatory paid sub for content yes having a gripping game dynamic is nice but don't act like games like halo, cod and literally ever sports game ever dont do this even worse. There is a lot of content in the game sadly not as engaging as it should be but seriously where you expecting a better dynamic sense they based this game solely off the player base who only touched f4 and nothing else.
---
I just bought it yesterday, for me one of the best, now waiting for the log cabin
---
How do couriers help out? I’m new to trading so I definitely made an stupid mistake hahah.
---
I'm doing g a bloodied power armor/heavy weapon build right now and it is super fun. Check out this video https://youtu.be/GFpBqGWM40k

Guy goes into some detail about good perks and mutation combos that make you basically unkillable.

Sounds good and will do

They said we earn also through public events and xp. I want to learn more about that

ive been soured on this season concept thanks to bfv's tides of war.  hopefully it will run better.  im looking forward to the fireworks tho.
---
Having something above the shelf is the key component to getting it to stay. It won't place on just a free standing shelf.   
---
OP also has a floor piece as the roof for their porch. When I tried placing a flag under a floor Piece like in the pic it was able to stay first try. Havn't been able to get it to work with the Contemporary porch though.
---
They act as a middleman. You give them the items, they receive the items from the other party and ensure everyone gets what they are supposed to.
---
I can I’m on now
---
Lucky for you, you now have another avenue to give Bethesda more of your money!
---
/s
---
This is a hard way, I made it and always left leg was missing. For me was a real nightmare to get all the pieces.
---
I sell ammo so I can buy ammo I actually want. This cuts out the middle vault dweller.
---
Having dinner, will jump on in a little bit.

Complaining about free shit is obnoxious. They didn't even remove it out right. They reduced the amount of one free thing and increased the number of another dramatically. 
---
But let's all fucking hit the ceiling because why? You deserve whatever you want?  For free?

Todd says subscribe to 1st and buyblots of atoms.
---
Does not compute.
---
None of them are confirmed canon apparently, but people think the NCR ending is the most likely candidate to be deemed canon since Kellogg mentions the NCR expanding at one point. 
---
...Then again, that's his memories, so it could've happened before FONV and he's talking about how the NCR is expanding into NV itself in the first place.
---
I haven’t really been getting as many harpoons back though... thought they nerfed it...
---
Frankly if they had just ported in more of the FO4 assets they already own, we wouldn't be having this problem.
---
And there are plenty of games, both free to play and buy to play (like this game) that have longer loops that don't require a sub. I don't know where you're getting that idea from.
---
Wonder where they went this time... 🤔
---
You can replace the Overseer with an alternative without significantly impacting the core point of the main questline. 
---
House is relevant because without him there is no RobCo. Therefore without him there are virtually no robots. Meaning no robot vendors or about 50% of the non-human NPCs in the game. It would require a significantly greater modification if RobCo were removed from the game than if the Overseer was removed and replaced simply with some quest directions from Vault-Tec. 
---
The Overseer is simply ‘a method to relay quest directions in the game’. 
---
Again, your logic is flawed.  Both could be replaced. Neither is required to have the same basic gameplay experience; **discover what happened in Appalachia and fix it.**
---
One more time:  it’s not about the **degree** of relevance. It’s about whether or not they have a relevant connection to this game. 
---
Both of them do. Both of them are relevant.
---
you sound way too pissed about this. I'm not thrilled about it either but this just feels like calling people "bootlicker" with extra steps. Regular players who don't participate here, if they agree, also won't care about the season pass by not investing their time into it.  
---
That being said I agree, the new rewards don't really interest me other than the astronaut PA skin. If it's as slow paced as Destiny 2's season pass I will likely never get it anyway so tbh I don't really care about the season pass. Frankly I'm tired of it being the new video game monetization scheme.
---
I just deposited about 3500 gunpowder and about 5000 38 into my stash. Thsy ammo converter can't get here soon enough
---
My advice: don’t.

Hybrid builds are garbage. Just make a second character if you want a different playstyle.

Name five games that arnt rust reskins with actual repeatable dog elements, and this game is literally copy and pasted from fallout 4 thats why the dog helmets and instant assualtron beams come from( I say this cause everyone seems to forget the novatrons didnt have to charge its beam and neither did the gorgons)
---
Doing the vault raid with either faction will help unlock them faster for that faction. Make sure to do each faction up to the point of the "side with x" mission though so that you don't miss out on their rewards.
---
Basically just don't rush to finish it with one side or the other.
---
Reminds me of how confused I was this time a year ago as a newer player seeing a very high level with a sliver of health left. No idea why he didn’t heal. It seemed silly. There’s always a reason!
---
I did my first solo Imposter Sheesqautch about 2 weeks ago as a Junkies build and landed a Junkies Explosive 90% reduced weight LMG, I've been using it ever since.
---
Love the gun!
---
What I mean is I havent been on today to open any, so I dont know if they are banning...I'll let ya know in a sec
---
Setup camp by emmets disposal site and check emmets and solomans pond work great for me and it's free
---
Why would anyone pay to skip the entire season? You get score just by gaining xp. That sounds like a waste of money. Nobody is going to skip everything. 
---
Anyway I have issues with the seasons as well  for different reasons. I agree it cheapens the experience a bit. I’m going to try and have an open mind though. 
---
Also they have added quite a few in game rewards... all sheepsquatch stuff, nuka shine, brewing, backpacks, all wastelanders weapons and armor. So I think you’re a bit off base there.
---
Walk over character, press crouch key, release crouch key. Repeat.
---
I would love to know
---
I was going to make a dumb one up, but its pretty hard to top that one lol
---
I added you
---
don’t really care, they didn't even add atom shop content to outpace atom generation rate, not sure it’ll  be any different
---
Not strongly optimistic.
---
Keep in mind, this is a basic function requested for a long time and Bethesda put it on this season thing. And even though it's very early on the list, if I'm not mistaken this won't always be available to those that miss it outside the season window.
---
But more importantly, the willingness to add this to the game this way seems like a sort of half-hearted generosity that likely has a catch. I'm personally expecting very bad returns that probably require huge quantities that make it not as useful as it might otherwise could have been.  Won't really know until it's out, but if the food chillers are anything to go by, not very excited.
---
While it doesn't work exactly like people have been asking for, it is technically an ammo converter and it's free.
---
Goes to show that Bethesda does listen to our ideas, and doesn't automatically attempt to monetize them.
---
But it also means we should expect future items in the same vein to function in the same way: Grind for "Tokens" to trade in (possibly even time-gated like Scrip, Bullion, NPC Vendors, etc).
---
Overall, it's a step in the right direction (it's free), but depending on the exchange rates, it's probably like the collectron: a useful addition, but quicker to hunt for what you need specifically.
---
Edit: words.
---
Don’t die then.
---
Then just remember that when looking at the next limited time only cosmetic and if it's worth doing something you don't enjoy. Too much of the game sucks the fun out to force reward.
---
The missiles and grenades go in ...
---
Just saw. Headed back to my camp to craft the leg for you. Want Calibrated shocks?

This is solid advice. I'll do better next time. &lt;3

I got almost all of my heavy combat unyielding pieces from the scorchbeast queen. Completing the quest seems to always give you a heavy combat armor piece.

Happened to me once during sbq fight. Very annoying. You aren’t alone.
---
If you Prime it, you can make 172 .308 at a time, with super duper, that's 223 per go.
---
If you nuke WS, you can get about 10 Stable Fluorescent Flux per run or 2230 .308. I usually run it about 4x by resetting it (log in/out of the private server), which gives you enough flux for 10k rounds in about 2hrs.
---
Yeah probably most likely do that, thanks for the input!
---
Send me an add because I can’t join your game
---
When you position the nuke just don't include Fissure site prime. You can place the nuke ( where you want ) before confirming.
---
Dang, I didn't realize there were limitations to it. I originally discovered it with the shelf on top of the upper floor so I figured it'd work anywhere, but I guess the bottom of the flag was anchored to the floor in that instance.
---
Thx for the tip
---
Says you are offline
---
What can I say? What do you want me to say? It is what it is. In my view, imperfect as it’s been, it’s a positive that they saw Wastelanders through instead of giving up and they’re still trying to add to the game. Rather they try to grow the game than phone it in. The problem for long term players like us is, what rewards will really truly satisfy? What assortment of Camp bling, gear, and Barbie outfits would make the game feel more worthwhile? I think BoS will be the most important update this game gets to determine the true longevity of the game, because if they cannot keep the Fallout stories reliably coming, this game may not be able to retain its user base. I’m not trying to ignore your primary complaint, but I don’t think I can give a completely encouraging answer.
---
GT? I’ll invite
---
Has there been a time when an exclusive reward has been released that there hasn't immediately been a serious issue with duping / hacks on the level of servers crashing constantly or other major features needing to be disabled? It doesn't seem to me like political correctness has much to do with it vs stability of the game.
---
After giving it more thought, I cancelled my Fallout 1st subscription.  There really isn't a point in giving them more money when I'm leaving the game around July 5th.  I realize I should just leave now, but it would feel nice to finish the reputation goal I've been working towards.

I placed the beams before the fences. As long as the beams are already in place, the fences won't care that they're intersecting with them. I know in the past I could not get them to work together, so I think this was a recent change.
---
Look at ESO's daily log in rewards. It's 90% awfulness pretending to be "free" and you're supposed to be grateful for it. Same thing here.
---
I agree!
---
30th, tuesday coming up
---
I didn't even think of that. That's a good idea
---
Only crops that you built via the building interface will be stored. Natural plants like wild mutfruit will not be stored
---
Its totally ok to put down a game and take a break.   
---
I came back to 76 for Wastelanders after not playing for months. Played it during the peak of the pandemic. completed a majority of the content (not all of it) beat the story ect. I haven't played in weeks.
---
I missed most of the mask event because i was playing through Jedi Fallen Order at the time. (great game btw). 
---
So ill probably comeback at the next big content drop. Poke my head in sometimes. Thats ok. A totally valid way to play the game.
---
&gt; and much more opportunity for you to spend real money on atoms 
---
Wood armor paints...
---
Are they aware that no one uses wood armor?
---
I'll make an addendum to the OP, thanks for testing further and sharing your results.
---
Yay :)
---
This works. I tried it yesterday. I imagine spamming the buttons is much easier on PC, but it was tedious pulling the RT to scrap on Xbox.

Here is where you can farm everything!
---
If you have plenty of caps and don't want to farm for it just go around the robot vendors for it. You'll pay top price though it can be convenient.
---
You can pretend psychology isn't a thing, but it is. Just the existence of the atom shop changes how people experience the game.
---
What news did I miss?
---
You’ll stay alive in any circumstance, but your DPS is going to be atrocious compared to bloody.  Junkie at least lets you kill normal mutants without burning several dozen bullets on each one.
---
Need your GT
---
Sweet i just watched the video and screenshot his build! Hoping to get it going tomorrow!
---
You can get it in the game, while playing.
---
Happy B day Mr. House!
---
Is season 1 out?
---
Was my birthday on the 22nd. I seen a notification that said "Happy birthday...".. I feel cheated.lol
---
Ammo machine seems fine to me. Making 5.56 for my handmade has become a very rare occurrence . 
---
Of course your mileage will vary if your primary weapon is a .50 cal.
---
If you don’t reply, I’m scrapping them and logging off.
---
Shit-Canning Our Reputation Everytime
---
Eh, probably, but it involved vendor prices for scrap vs what is listed in the inventory.  Forgot to take that into account, but I wasn't using what I traded anyway, so.
---
Nuka Grape lets you clear your radiation without losing your mutations (if you don't have starched genes equipped).
---
oh man! I bever thought about NOT DYING TO A SBQ!
---
Next Tues patch is season start
---
Nope, everyone I've traded with was honest!
---
Are you talking about the Enclave Vault?
---
I'm on pc, if you want me to make you some armor and weapons plus give you some other items to help you get back on your feet, hit me up. ign is MadsAboutIt
---
edit: I'm on AEST time so timezones will probably differ depending where you are. Actually headed to work soon but can jump on afterward
---
Alright I tried. Sorry. Family time.
---
Will make it much harder to get those exclusive bundles....
---
AND... Please do not allow dropping painted items at all! Thank you!
---
Finally, yes, this is the thing here! Players need more useful tools for their camps.
---
It mostly happens to me right after killing the imposter sheep. I’m perked for stealth and the BE laser I have kills her pretty fast so I use that but then kind of get aggroed by the eye bots because it doesn’t have a silencer.
---
Plus: magazines could only set up in a camp shelf or being used by the owner, but not being sold or traded in regularly. If you want to have one you didn't actually found, you would have to offer it on some kind of comic convention area to actually deceive it with other players. Conventions would be held each week from saturday morning till sunday evening only.
---
When this system would finally be working as intended after maybe 5 or 6 patches it could grow from there to invent other player driven conventions like gun shows, power armor exhibitions and household conventions for found plans. Think of a player lobby (like in COD WW2) where you could only have access to your note section.
---
I would love to explore the wasteland hoping for a rare comic or plan that i could take to the convention and hopefully deceive it to something useful. It would make each find infinitely more valuable and meaningful.
---
Given the abundance of plans each player has learned by now would make inventing a PA convention meaningless at the games current state, but at least the comic/magazine system could be reinvented into something like this. Old magazines found yet would stay one time usable items, but new implemented "special collector editions" would be having a new mechanic as mentioned above.
---
Dreams would come true!
---
It’s coming this summer. Patience.
---
I think he's talking about in the Whitesprings build, 2nd floor in the hall with the loud carpet.
---
Im.curious about those and the houses with the handscanners as well.
---
My nephew was born today, (25th) when he is older I'll introduce him to fallout and ensure he changes his name.
---
As long as the character is on the same xbox account then shouldn't be an issue. You can have up to 5 characters per gamer tag/user.
---
If that's not the case he should open a support ticket
---
Happy Birthday twin!
---
Don't forget Farrah Fawcett.
---
There's a few things I would change on his special distribution. I would switch out good with salt for serendipity. I would remove hard bargain and if you keep the points in charisma I'd do tenderizer, or move them to luck and do ricochet. I'd pull off thru hiker, because food isnt really worth carrying around imo, and do dodgy instead. I have serendipity, ricochet, and I'm starting to acquire dodgy and I'm like Neo from the matrix, just dodging and deflecting every other attack. Combine those with blocker in strength and you are basically a god.
---
If you are talking about the rooms in the resort on second floor I think they were supposed to be exclusive areas for the politicians to hide out in. If you glitch through you just fall through to the 1 st floor though unfortunately. Nothing in there yet. Maybe in the future.
---
Don't say that like the SBQ is dangerous, it's just a bullet sponge.
---
5 ranks and done for me
---
See you in 10 weeks 🤷‍♂️
---
I noticed this too.
---
How much GB?
---
It's been posted a zillion times, it's just easier for the threads to fall off the bottom of the page using a mobile. As usual it's fanboy/hater fodder - it's free(ish), converts all the ammo that's currently just dropped in a ditch, and for those who think it's the Worst Idea Ever! you can still play the game without using it.
---
Youre the best dude! Im actually like lvl 240 so i have most of those already its just about respecing right now ill go with your changes
---
Thank you again
---
Happy Belated Birthday!
---
My best friends birthday is on June 22nd. Have known him since 1997. Good dude.
---
RIP selling ammo.
---
I second this.  I kept a bloody combat knife for mole rats and low level enemies, but barely used it and never wasted perks on melee skills.  I’d rather invest all my points into damage or defense.
---
3 parts ground raddidendrum, 3 bottles of boiled water, stir vigeriously, add brahmin milk, stir vigeriously, add sugar or spices, depends on your preference!
---
Lol, how is this revenge? It doesn't cost much to repair a leveled camp. I'd say he still got over on you. Killed you like a punk, took your shit, and then you spent a bunch more time and resources crafting a not so diabolical response. Actually, what you did is pretty laughable.
---
250 (5 tiers) my bad, forgot to put that.
---
That is where I totally agree.
---
Rofl
---
Perhaps go to Quarry 3?
---
Just kidding. Make sure the quest is active. If it still doesn’t show then quit/restart.  It might give a new location.
---
Thankies!
---
If you were on PC, I'd join you in a heartbeat.
---
Played around with Commando but am mostly a bloodied vats crit stealth sniper using a bloodied lever. 
---
I hit at 4500 with sandman, adrenalin and covert. I have several pieces of unyielding with sneak on them and when I get in a hairy situation I simply stop- noone sees me and 1 headshot with covert at 3 from close range kills 95 Pct of what is out there. Actual damage to the queen maxes at 450 so I do more than my share. 
---
I visit lucky hole once every 20-30 hours of gameplay for ammo and use 250 rounds on average for a queen fight.
---
I have a zealots handmade primed and used to take that to queen fights but burning through 2000 rounds wasn't as efficient as my bloodied fixer with a few chems and some food and ballistic bock.
---
That said I have never gotten an exceptional fixer or handmade, lesson here is use what you have, forcing a build on weapons you don't have is pointless.
---
That's awesome, thank you. I did finish officer on deck, that's the only nuke I launched. It's difficult doing solo and I'm currently changing my build. I was going for a sniper build but at level 75 I'm not that powerful.
---
LOL same difference.  They both take a long grind and reward you with nothing but exhaustion.
---
I just found it, there is a chest underwater.
---
Only 250?... that’s disappointing
---
Sadly I'm on ps4.  Game seems dead lately.  No ones launching nukes.
---
IT IS SUMMER!!! I’m joking but yeah you’re right I need patience
---
I'm gonna be pissed if the only pet we can get is a damn dog, if that's even still happening.
---
Yes man says howdy.happy birthday partner.
---
The immersion is oh so deep when I can make a Gatling plasma cannon instantly but can't defeat plywood to enter a building or pick up and ride a bicycle.  I hear your complaints but don't agree.
---
I'll have to explore the place a little more as I missed this. My apologies.
---
Oj yeah...I rarely go there and forgot about that darn thing.
---
It's underwater just in front of the buildings. But it's also right next to the submerged Mirelurk Queen who has woken up each time I've opened the trunk.
---
that matters ever so less when you can't repair it to 200%.
---
Ikr, that gets nothing lol.
---
Cant wait to drop a $100 on atoms cause I dont have the time but really want that dark Cosmo power armor :/
---
That’s the much smarter option.  Whenever I got a great weapon, I just built an alt around it.  I did that with all five character slots and now have the option to save up 5000 scrip for Purveyor sales, which means 5x the opportunity to roll more great stuff.
---
I figured it was something like that, thanks!
---
Bethesda released a list with pictures of all the stuff we can unlock at each rank this season coming Tuesday.
---
I have yet to see him! That’s Mr. Veterinarian right?
---
I’ve encountered another walking robot with wild mongrels.
---
And there’s the Pied-Piper one.
---
I always love the Miss Nanny’s story time!
---
This answer wins.
---
If you are talking about the ammo converter, it’s like a 30:1 ratio... so 30ish 10mm may get you 1 5.56, unless they have changed the conversion rate.
---
I never got an invite
---
Sadly I'm on ps4 and have launched nukes, only for not enough people to show up to kill her,  or too weak to do so.
---
Squirrels1869
---
I don't think it is. My first nuke was at the fissure west of prime and it still started scorched earth.
---
You’re so sassy.
---
Legitimate question: Is this for all or just Fallout 1st people?
---
Yeah it's definitely on the same Xbox account. Thanks a lot, I'll let him know to open a ticket 👍
---
😍
---
I agree its a shit system but its the one we got
---
If they had made the pass a paid system they could've made it another thing that FO1st members got and if you weren't a FO1st member you paid the generic $10
---
Supposedly they used to have them (before I started playing). People used them to teleport others directly into traps.
---
well, i mean, a giant-super-sonic screeching bat isnt dangerous...
---
if you hack
---
I edited my comment to include the workaround for mounting to the Contemporary porch and roof pieces. Would you mind if I made a cross-post in r/fallout76settlements ? I'll be sure to link both this post, your album and my album. If you havn't been there you should definitely check it out as I feel your build would be very welcomed there!
---
You seem overly emotional about this topic.
---
Thanks for the info. This helps out a lot. Sadly for my self, I dislike doing the "daily and weekly" gring quest. So I'll probably never get the full amount. But that's just me.
---
Yes it’s the houses with the hand scanners. I don’t remember Bethesda ever mentioning any updates on what they’re planning with these rooms.
---
I have been there.  When I'm the only one doing much damage using all my gauss ammo.  Thats why I'm so low on high rad fluids to make stable flux.  I always end up using all my ammo to help take her down.
---
Challenges should still give atoms. This way it's nearly impossible to get them for free. I mean 1500 for 3 months? C'mon...
---
Have some guilding!
---
Me and a friend were just talking about this, Thankyou all so much for taking the time to compile this!!
---
Yeah I have all my points in perception currently for commando/rifleman/bow perks, but I'm probably going to start another character for 15 points in strength and melee/shotgun/heavy guns perks. I got a nice Gatling plasma I want to put to use! I'm always put off by the grind for rep because I can't transfer that stuff between characters. Will wait until the next double XP to grind it out.
---
Yeah that's him. Very slow walk to follow to destination then nothing. Was fun to do once though. Found him near Wayward.
---
The ammo converter and fireplace are pretty cool...
---
Sorry that you feel a free update to a nearly two year old game should yield 50+ hours of content.
---
The fireplace could be cool if it doesn't stick out like the nuka machine but the rates for the ammo converter is putting me off on that one.
---
I believe it's in craft not modify/repair
---
The ammo converter conversion rate is terrible, about say 30 .38 for 1 5.56, unless they have changed the numbers on the PTS
---
From the maintenance entrance, there is one protectron between you and the paint cans.
---
I usually clear the high school, because it usually has a legendary or two, but sometimes just grab the cans.
---
I'm a sneaky VATS build and do have a fancy pump action though, so robots haven't been a concern for me for a while.
---
hello new, I'm dad! :D
---
This is actually a cool idea. Thank you for your service.
---
Go for it! At this point, I feel like you've contributed more to this discovery than I have. I'll definitely check out that sub as well, especially when I get ready to show a tour of mine.
---
1500 is pretty good for free atoms. This is Bethesda after all.
---
Yep was there for ages on my main. Can get stairs inside too.
---
Everyone
---
Yes instigating and sneak attack work together
---
That makes sense, seeing how common 10mm and .38 are.
---
In that case, I can actually be excited! Thanks!
---
That's after roughly an additional 200 hours of gameplay though. Plus I can  get all the currencies much faster in game now. I will never use most of the skins or base building items.
---
Literally the only interesting thing is the ammo convertor
---
You don’t have any time to earn any levels over the next 10ish weeks?
---
Good maybe if you name it after her she will actually get something done about the current pet system
---
Clean sink and ammo converter
---
Only other items of interest are the white raider mask and the fireplace
---
No chance I’m committing to those ranks 👀
---
I know it’s common, but it’s just the “points” thing they are using for it is weird personally. Mini-nukes are like 100 pts and you can only buy 6
---
Edit: Someone linked a picture of the conversion rates on another post pertaining to the converter
---
Not 100, I work 16's fml lol
---
Yah, that’s was my reasoning too, but alas, no dice on the freebie atoms... all good, I’m not atoms poor, but I legit didn’t play for a week cuz I was salty. Lol, I’m stoked for the seasons rewards they posted tho, so exciting!
---
The rate it "coverts" is barely worth having it
---
Yes, this week’s Inside The Vault gives the full reward list. :)
---
Same i want a cat
---
Well they had that thanksgiving display case in the atomic shop that was awesome. Also there is a display case with clean glass if you scroll over.
---
As long as they don't fuck with the monthly for 1st members, it doesn't matter to me. I don't think it's fair for people that don't pay for 1st though, because saving up for what you want is tedious enough as it is. But at least there will be rewards for rank ups.
---
