Never got into to many mods as of I just recently got a good PC and really the only things I've just gone nuts with mods is New Vegas and 4, although I would imagine that have tons of funs when it comes to mods for Oblivion

What do you mean like it popped up on the screen like when you loot it off of an enemy?
---
Got a fox and a chicken in the same pic lol

I got locked in a house today.  Door was open and I ran from a glowing level 91 deathclaw. I closed the door and it was locked.  Haha. I wanted the deathclaw so I ping the player and a level 31 shows up to let me out. Haha huge deathclaw raging everywhere while he did.

Works great for needing multiple subjects too. Kill one, then kite the others to the body.

Yeah right after I left my Inventory

Yeah right as I left my inventory

Someone posted earlier after datamine... apparently they listed good with salt lvl 1 twice, so lvl1,1,3  instead of lvl 1,2,3.... so at the moment it means you can stack it with good with salt lvl 2. At least until bug is fixed.
---
I understand...
---
Oh no you‚Äôre fine. There‚Äôs sometimes a weird delay or even when I get a new legendary, one of my others pop up and act like I just got that one even though I‚Äôve had it for weeks. You‚Äôre alright for sure. Bethesda and the bugs :)

Feral ghoul chair from fallout 4?
---
All I want is an Enclave paint for my xo1
---
I found Anne at the Lighthouse too after going to a bunch of different spots.
---
very good point, I put it in my stash and im relogging and gonna take it out
---
Each of mine has a frog jar on the computer. My camp is a serenade of croaking. That's on top of already being in the cranberry bog
---
It's space bar on pc, same button as you use to modify or repair an item at the weapons/armour bench. Not a console player.
---
yeah I have an IE lever, IE shotgun, and IE hunting rifle. It's just the hunting rifle
---
Then leave a bag of spoiled meat on their bed üò¨
---
No I literally have two now in my inventory
---
I chose to go for an alt. The reason being purely for when we are able to prestige I don't want to have to go back to having no high level character to be able to play with.
---
Actually found someone. Thanks +karma
---
Do u have 2? Does  that for my weapon sometimes but i never get another
---
+karma
---
Oh, I was talking about FNV and the drug cateye. I just realized you said cat eyes instead, which I assume is a perk in oblivion
---
Aaaah, just got level 3 today üò≠
---
Bye
---
Yeah i do
---
OMG YES
---
If you've already have a lot of strength you're not far off from Heavy Weapons as is.
---
U know crashing doesnt mean its Bethesdas fault. Game crashes when dupers do their shit
---
Yea I'm just putting two and two together there to, I forgot it was the drug in new Vegas , if I remember correctly which I probably don't night-eye was the illsuion spell in Oblivion, again I could be wrong
---
Dont know then. No big deal in the end
---
The more vanity options/customisation the better.
---
Just like Path of Enlightenment.. It fails with 10-20 secs on the clock for me. Luckily I‚Äôm only there for some acid...
---
I am inevitable
---
They both have the same blueish visual effects tho
---
So.... what happens when you reach that 120% reduction? Spoiled brahmin milk become fresh, inert flux become stable?
---
I want that tire decoration with the rusted spikes coming out it. I love the fact we got some skull decorations for the camp but yeah definitely more raider stuff. I dont want a nice clean never touched base this is the wasteland dammit! I want toasters in my tub! I want heads stuffed in a broken tv! I want chems piled all around my bed!
---
Noice. It's always good to find or do two or more things together for challenges.
---
It‚Äôs a well known bug....
---
I'm on my mid level 50s as a stealth rifle build, and I'm still finding that the pipe revolver and pipe bolt-action are my main go-to weapons, especially since the Gunslinger and Rifleman cards stack once you put a rifle stock on them. That, with a large number of sneak cards in Agility, and an Instigating bolt-action as a sniper rifle, and I'm one- or two-shotting virtually everything I can get the drop on. For close up, I go combat shotgun. All silenced, of course.
---
I hope. If i get banned for something I can't control I'm going to raise a stink.
---
Got a Max Level 2* Bloodied Grognaks Axe with 40% increased swing speed last night.
---
One of the few things sorely missed from release. Heading into the Mire for the first time in pitch black darkness was amazing. Turning my pip boy light on for seconds here and there to guide my path as I was too scared to be a giant bright beacon when I had no idea what was behind the next tree.
---
  
---
Now it's a lovely swampy stroll
---
U wouldnt get banned for something so small
---
I doubt you'll get banned. Actual dupers are still around which tells me their dupe detection isn't that sophisticated. 
---

---
A single item won't be on their radar. You can get 2 or even 3 of same item without duping.
---
In any case, not like you did it intentionally. But if it will make you feel better, open a case at bethesda support site and let them know. You'll be on record that it was unintentional and if they truly want to do something about it, can delete the item.
---
My guess is they will just say don't do it!! And thank you for bringing to their attention and will investigate to determine how it happened.
---
I know, sorry. I was being snarky.
---
Yes please

Yeah it doesn't make ANY sense to equip the science perk card, gain the knowledge to craft a super-complex plasma weapon, and then unequip the perk card and be dumb as rocks again. A good portion of the perks need to be made into passive skills.
---
Yeah that'll probably be best people might hate me for doing it but as far as I'm concerned in a game like this you shouldn't be duping anyway gives you way too much of an edge over the other players especially in a game with a trolly fanbase like this
---
You need these for the tadpole badge.
---
Found that out last night when a Super Mutant Warlord killed the squirrel I was chasing around Whitespring.
---
Is there some other prerequisite? It's in my inventory "broken prosnap camera" not in my stash and it isn't appearing in the tinker's bench at all, not in repair/modify or craft.
---
YES would love something like this, especially if we could leave reviews in game
---
I waste so much time FTing to camps that aren‚Äôt worth the trip. Not in aesthetics or product. 
---
Who the hell would buy a combat shotgun for 300c?
---
Sorry man ! Newish to reddit mostly a lurker
---
It actually works there if you take the workshop you can build a structure that you can reach the roof of the picnic spot and hunting from there works pretty well if you have a decent scoped weapon. And then I indeed finished off the yao guai with bashing it to death with the syringer since they do tend to run away when you keep standing on the roof and they are hurt badly.
---
You're probably going to have to do it the hard way and figure it out manually.  I've played a lot of Fallout 4 and totally forgot who you mean, so I don't imagine there's a lot of effort out there spent making tutorials on re-creating her.
---
Broken prosnap delux camera is the model you need.
---
Obviously he took from the last poor schmuck that tried those whacky scoutsleader's ideas.
---
I would love a helmet, can it be learned via scrapping as well? Of so, I'll buy 2 off you, tomorrow is when I can be on, reddit name is same as psn

Berkeley Springs is fucking nuts like that, and I can‚Äôt see a reason for it. It is hilarious though. I really wasn‚Äôt expecting it the first time I took the workshop and two scorchbeasts show up and start filling the house I was hiding in with that toxic smoke. It took me ages to kill them both by myself. Finally I looted them with broken guns and armour, and depleted ammo. The loot from them wasn‚Äôt quite worth the trouble but it was a fun experience.
---
That‚Äôs would be awsome also Halloween decorations too!
---
i was worried, but a guy i met in-game submitted a ticket and a post on their forums asking, tl;dr if it's in-game it's fair game
---
Is the radscorp venom a perk on the weapon or certain syringes you can craft?

Ign is deworley but I wont be on until 1600 east usa time tomorrow

It would be nice to save your current perk config as a profile, and be able to set up 3 profiles. That would allow quickly changing all of your perks with a single click.
---
This would be adorable! Could have Weekly Spotlights for the best rated.
---
I was referencing the two shot not so much the explosive. Remember they aren't in fact a set package, just the most talked about and used combo
---
This would 100% delight me! üòÇ

Yep

Open the map. Press Z on PC, or R1/RB on console. This will take you to the main menu. If you scroll down past the options written in big letters, you‚Äôll see one of the small print ones is called ‚Äúchange appearance‚Äù

2. You're Enumines and someone else finds a bug within a game that happens to be beneficial, but doesn't impact other players in the slightest. They decide to share it with the community on reddit. Do you...

A. Whine.  
---
B. There is no B.
---
Ah shit! Thanks, I really thought I had the right one.
---
I know when u look at the overseers inventory theirs a checklist and it says for the body that it‚Äôs vault 51
---
What's wrong with the punch bowl
---
How about a weekly one of these added to the Inside the Vault? They did ask us what we‚Äôd like the see in them.
---
Nah, I tried to go back but the guy logged off when I made my way back to the camp. It wasn‚Äôt a glitch, the door to the vending machine was attached to a balcony of sorts, and I could see the whole drop tunnel before I opened  the door to the vending but assumed the guy had made a tall building
---
Any luck? I am at the Nuka Plant right now and i am getting the same glitch again somehow.
---
Wait you mean being farted to death is neither heroic nor fun?
---
I‚Äôd also like to play the game for an hour without having  to freeze every 10 seconds .... I‚Äôve had this problem since the lying Lowe questline and it‚Äôs so annoying due to it being caused by your friends list . The game is literally unplayable when this occurs
---
My very first draw was an instigating shotgun. That was great. Every thing since then has been sad lol
---
They did just release some raider skull totem poles on the atom shop. I‚Äôm sure more will slowly come.
---
3 star level 1? How?
---
And I‚Äôd just done a Whitesprings run and had a fair bit of valuable junk I dropped, but he took my bag and logged off.
---
I have the refrigerated backpack, food spoils 60% more slowly, so it's like level 2 good with salt.
---
Was my bad, should have been more clear in my first comment as to which type, forgot there was a non deluxe prosnap version in the game as well as just a broken camera
---
Berkley itself is just at a leyline of Bravo spawns. It is more obvious at the workshop but being swooped by as many as five of them is not unheard of (thought that will require you to kill two of them first.)
---
Turned in some scrip with my level 2 alt.
---
Then yeah that gun has fat ol‚Äô glitch on it, it could be that the explosive is hitting before the actual bullet but who knows
---
Ah so they're usually on level? Sweet i was saving mine til level 50
---
Interesting, I'm not seeing this. I have full rifleman cards, and I can get the hunting rifle to ~150 damage with the .50 receiver, but the gauss rifler is over 200 natively. Am I missing a perk card?
---
No, I don‚Äôt expect you to do that. Just offering a different perspective. I hope you don‚Äôt lose your enjoyment of the game over this camera business. Cheers, fellow vault dweller!
---
Impossible to do an accurate Desdemona since our 76 characters can't constantly have a cigarette in their hand.

Server hopping never worked me. Not FT place to place. I lucked out finding one logging in after a night of server hopping. Found 2 walking from place to place, 1 was able to get back into the lobby. And another for lucky logging in. 
---
I found it 4 times at Phillipi. I like that area because Pricketts and the memorial are close by. So is the palace but that is a large place and I don't know were it spawns.
---
Forgot to report back. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I didn't stick around too long, either.
---
What the other person said. Take off armor/perks, log out outside PA, then log back in and re-equip.
---
I honestly have no clue how it works. I've gotten a few max level items, but mostly level 1 pipes. I got a max level quad broadsider with my alt yesterday.
---
Yeah but you only get the mission/plan for the 105mm lens aka bucket list from the tourist.
---
Duping is so easy it happens by accident you won't get banned I've had it happen accidentally before. You can either keep it, drop or vendor you will be fine
---
Im not sure 
---
All i know is i fought him in someones house the other day, he appeared when i was browsing someones trading thingo
---
Dumb.
---
I like it. Should also add a leaderboard independent to the machine so visitors can set a high scores.
---
Careful. He's in the mod good graces. A few weeks ago, I said "Whaaaah" and they decided to "warn" me  by banning me for a week.
---
The original comment said deluxe but I got excited, appreciate the help.
---
That is a Grade A idea! Seriously Bethesda hire the OP
---
Ive gotten one decent roll, but it's better than nothing
---
Good suggestions. You put some time into this.
---
&gt;So I skipped out on this game ever since I saw the beta. The controversy with the canvas bags
---
Yeah, not worth the time to read the rest of this dribble.
---
Don't worry still alive just critically injured, just gotta walk it off
---
Thanks anyway, its weird it happened twice to me now today across multiple servers and having closed and restarted fo76. The only thing i can think of, is that it had to do with a player camp i had traveled to.
---
That would be cool if that made us become one, or like your body becomes one
---
white springs, check the plans. go to the military wing - past the command room where you learn how to launch nukes.
---
This is what I was trying to say, thanks.
---
Yes
---
Out in the sun getting them vitamin D and R
---
Yes but only up to 3 pieces
---
I was thinking the same because I have lone wanderer and action boy so that‚Äôs 65% I believe and I have 4 Ap Refresh pieces , how much in percentage is the ap refresh perk on a armor ?
---
First one was the division 1
---
Will do mate!
---
Why? What's wrong about this?
---
If you're on PC I'll pass you 500 caps to learn it and hand it back to you
---
I think i read Something on the Bethesda forum saying  maxed weapons on low lvl chars are not intended and will be fixed
---
Why though? Shouldn't the plan disappear?
---
I don't want Raider personally but I do want Faction based decorations like BoS. 
---
Raider decorations will make it easy to identify which enemies to destroy though üòâ

Its obviously a glitch

If your fine with Todd lying, bait and switch schemes, and so on thats your opinion. However that opinion has nothing to do with whether or not these suggestions have merit.

Anyone down to hop online right now?
---
Ah i miss npc's
---
What is perk manager
---
Yeah I bought those and decided to do a primitive camp with burn barrels, candles and lanterns. The mounted animals heads and skin rugs helped also but we are still seriously lacking for these types of camp builds. Hopefully you‚Äôre right!
---
That's the kind of attitude we don't need in this sub.
---
I haven‚Äôt got anything great but last night I got a 2 shot 90% reduced weight then some third effect I don‚Äôt remember double barrel shotgun not really for my build but not bad I plan on selling it
---
Keep trying 3*
---
Wait, so you're saying the .50cal is now more powerful than .308 like it should be?
---
Gah! And I just brown bagged my .50 cal!

If you ever need a cat, head to the Wixon Homestead south of Vault 76. There's a dead one in the bedroom on the second floor. It's my go-to dead cat. RIP Cheswick.

Gear, 3 star. Ranged 2 star. Best effects need at least these. Anyone a melee build care to add?
---
Lol! Bring it on!
---
In proximity to the poster, they apply automatically. Or how about in your CAMP all perks apply?
---
I mean they already have the monster mash quest, which is a ton of fun. So they should definitely consider doing halloween the whole month and doing a ton of camp themed events.
---
I have been looking for this for awhile, and haven't seen it.  I think it is still mislabeled.   I can't find it at any vendor.
---
I had him spawn in the golf course in whitesprings
---
I‚Äôd rather give 0 stars to the obvious dupers than the creatively limited box house owners

Great.  Now I'm imagining a whole server RPing Beavis and taking on the scorch queen with nothing but TP grenades.

I opened up a refrigerator today and it had a dead vault dweller stuffed inside of it and thought to myself ‚Äúwhy the hell cant I have this in my camp!?‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt know they stated it‚Äôs supposed to be available, do you have a source by chance? If true then the fact it‚Äôs still not fixed is just incredible.
---
I agree something should be done.. I mean, if we have the perks, why have to keep swapping them.. It‚Äôs just a waste of time. The idea of pre fab perk builds is even good.. just swap one for farming / scrapping and one for killing etc.. üëçüèº
---
Read this tools post history
---
Read the patch notes. It‚Äôs all there.
---
Keep looking.
---
I had the same issue. Took out a Glowing Mothman first and nothing. Eventually got another Mothman  to spawn and he had the wing on him.
---
Long as the platforms are separated.
---
Unfortunately my .50 rifle does less than my .308 rifle still. I don‚Äôt see a buff
---
Tbh I actually had to look it up because I started to think eso had the same reference &amp; I felt meanüòÇ
---
There are so many tho
---
I have a .50 hunting rifle from before patch it still does less DMG do I have to craft a entirely new .50 rifle?
---
I visited a crazy elaborate camp in harpers ferry where u had to climb a tree then jump onto tables and such which led like a 100 ft in the air where he had 2 vending machines setup and a third a distance away that u had to perform a balancing act over a conduit line/junction, in which was a couple overpriced documents and some propaganda flyers, then the guy emoted come here and directed me towards a table (with a gunshot or 2) which had my 'prizes' for making it that far i guess, which when i got there had two 1 star legendaries in a bag, of course as soon as i got to the bag he emoted the question marks and removed the flooring, i died with a little junk on me (like 10 springs and gears) which i didnt really care for because it was actually a nice change of pace to my daily repetitive grind, i took some pictures of the guy and his base and emoted thumbs up for giving me a good laugh and he dropped me a bunch of junk i can assume were from other 'entrants' of his twisted little puzzle game, overall it was a funny experience.

I've had the weird ground glitch on PS4, but never the psychedelic double vision. I recently had a fun visual glitch where weird phantom columns were rising out of the Cranberry Bog, as seen from a Savage Divide cliff. I managed to get a nice photo of it.
---
So it‚Äôs pretty safe to assume there‚Äôs a lot of new content...
---
System you playing on?
---
How do I sell ammo while avoiding this?
---
Pretty sure it's an anti-dupe choice. 
---
I'm hoping that it'll get adjusted as once they sort out the duping.
---
my hardened 308 on my hunting rifle is like 140+ can‚Äôt remember but I do know my .50 receiver is weaker. Is there a hardened .50??
---
Yeah but make the loot little Christmas wrapped legendaries that become better if you trade it to someone
---
wait doesn't a friendly mothman spawn after the lighthouse event? What if you kill him?
---
Indeed. Someone give me the cliff notes
---
I experience this exact problem as well.  
---
At first I thought I just got lucky (maybe a side effect from a perk) with the 500 extra shots by the first reload, but then I noticed as time went on that it had been draining from multiple plasma cores simultaneously!  
---
What a shame, the gatling plasma might be my favorite weapon in the game but this glitch breaks the weapon.  
---
Untill a patch is done I guess the best option is to conserve these cores in your personal stash, never carry no more then two plasma cores and use the gatling plasma as a secondary weapon.
---
Kind of makes wonder about the drop rates now. Possibly get better stuff at 2 stars and cheaper or more expensive 3 stars with less chances. All this random stuff makes it a pain in the butt lol
---
Unsure about hardened, but mine is refined. .50 cal hunting rifles got a 20% boost in last patch notes
---
Cant kill that one, plenty of us tried lol
---
I'll have to try to dig up the statement, but it was spread around the Bethesda Fallout 76 forum after a guy sent in an email to their support team asking if it was okay for him to own one. They responded with details of the situation and why it never showed up prior and said it was fine. There is one hat that behaves similar that is not okay to own, however, the Hunter's Hood. It is a hood that goes with the Hunter Pelt outfit that hasn't been released. Unfortunately scrapping one also has a 100% chance of learning the blueprint and it resulted in several players being busted for owning them and knowing the blueprint.
---
" What do you do in adventure as a level 238? " mostly just hang out and stay happy by being awesome. when you're this sexy and cool being happy is easy.
---
Same, my ammo sales have all gone through correctly
---
I turned in 8 today and I got 1 max level but the rest were level 1. Friday they were almost all max level so maybe they already fixed it.
---
You can't add any drinks to it
---
I got jumped just up the road from Pleasant Valley Station.
---
I got it the on the first claw game I found on the first try, I‚Äôve never been that lucky in my life since that moment.
---
You made the right choice. The new content added is a complete joke riddled with bugs and glitches
---
That's 76 since the beginning
---
It would be a nice feature. On the topic of games it would be nice to see darts be added both as a throwable and playable game with the dart board (which I am unsure if it is still available, so if not then ignore the idea).
---
That aside it would also be nice if some of the other games were repair liked the shooting gallery, the whack-a-commie, and the skeeball game. Even Hoops would be a nice addition. In general I would love to see some world event occur to "retake" the old Fair Grounds and turn them into functional fairgrounds.
---
I just can't justify not having weapon buff cards
---
Oh well then I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think you could be/should be banned because you didn‚Äôt do the procedures dupers take. But I don‚Äôt know.. sorry
---
I want to face npcs in power armor, hopefully in the wastelanders content.
---
I‚Äôve received a lot of really great pieces - almost a complete set of unyielding marine armor, some great urban and Forrest scout armor, and an instigating dragon with faster reload.... I‚Äôve had better luck from the Purveyor than I ever have had from farming Whitesprings or West Tek
---
If you want details about what they added. They‚Äôve added 3 new events and 2 new quest lines one ends in you fighting a very strong assultron dresses as a sheep. The other ends with you unlocking a backpack for more carry weight and other mods. (Mods are a pain to get and take a lot of time)

Congratulations my friend! I purchased one for 500 caps last night after almost buying one for 10000 earlier in the day. 
---
Was at top of the world today and decided to try my luck as per usual and.... boom, I landed one myself. 
---
I was ecstatic that after trying so many times, it finally came through. 
---
I wish this wasn‚Äôt the case but it‚Äôs awfully fishy that the perfectly preserved pie seems to be showing up more lately. I‚Äôd love to claim that our perseverance and the kind tidings of the RNG gods paid off today for us, but I‚Äôm not so optimistic.
---
Last night I started scorchbeast queen with 11 full cores. It ate through the cores 2 and 3 at a time. You could look inventory and see that multiple would be equipped. At the end I had 4 cores
---
I have done it ten times and ten times I have received wood

Looks good!!

In any other sub this would post would raise eyebrows.

Player vending is a thing
---
The burrows mini-dungeon/quest now exists beneath harper's ferry
---
The berkeley station now has a legendary vendor, you buy stuff from her by scrapping legendaries for scrip at a special machine at any train station
---
Whole big quest around the sheepsquatch, culminating in a big boss battle
---
Scout questline is a thing now, mostly a series of arbitrary challenges to get coins for neat little trinkets
---
A couple new random encounters/events around the map, most popular is probably campfire tales for possum badges or free range for guaranteed sheepsquatch spawns/staff plans
---
Explosive energy weapons are *TEMPORARILY* removed from the loot pool, I think that was near the end of January so you might have missed it. People are treating them like they're gone for good but the patch notes clearly state it's a temporary thing until they make adjustments to the effect
---
Some bug fixes, some new bugs, the usual
---
Why would it be horrible? I think it would be great and also help to bring into focus pvp balancing.

The best one I seen was a guy had built on the radar dish by wes tek. His vending machine where mid level and he sold a bunch of junk way underpriced. I bought all his bulk lead at 14 and thought, why not see what he has up top? Ran up the steps to a closed door and a switch by it. I flipped the switch to go inside and was pushed off the dish by the floor trap. I was in excavator so no big deal, but it was clever. He gets your money and junk!

Just take out ‚Äúpvp‚Äù and your title is a gem.

And free fast travel to camps

When you really need to pee, but don't want to take off your power armor
---
Not sure if the replies would be the ones I was looking for though.  Hahaha
---
Craft one on a armor bench.
---
I think the other issue is your definition of a decent gun. I am lvl 135 on my main and still run 1* weapons. The reality is that 75% of a guns effectiveness is in that first primary effect. I run a bloodied / vampire commando build. I could spend a lot of caps and get a BE or VE handmade but it doesn't actually net me anything. I still one shot super mutants and can take down most anything with ease. So to me, the explosive is just a luxury addition from bragging rights and wowing random strangers with my pew pew boom boom sounds. 
---
You don't actually need a 3* weapon in this game at all.
---
Had Whitesprings no-leg run several times yesterday along with invisible ghouls and prone sliding ghouls that are really hard to kill. Also do get dupes once in a while (nothing good) like a dupe vampire combat knife (*).
---
After ruining his build I've relogated my first character to a crafting intelligence character, with 30+ intelligence, stuff he crafts has crazy durability!
---
Found the camera on both my chars using that. No hops.
---
Fyi, same happens with wood armor bud. Until bug is fixed, you should just sell or get scrip from those if you get them.
---
+1 DR for -2 PER? No thanks.
---
A standard PA suit is already better than most, if not all, legendary-amour builds.      
---
If there was legendary PA introduced, I'd like it to avoid straight buffs. Maybe stuff like carry weight, automatically using radx/radaway, weapon stability, extra melee armor-penetration, solar powered fusion (significantly reduced core usage in the day), powering energy weapons from the suit (reducing ammo usage), etc
---
There's all sorts of things that could be added outside of straight buffs.
---
I've received quality gear 5/30 and returned 25 to the vendor. I won't list what I consider quality but my solo char is now an addict. Did I want junkie affix? Meh, 50% is a quality affix though.
---
Nice
---
Morale is lower than a feral ghoul's iq.
---
Hahaha nice! Too much nukashine
---
Do you have a link to it?
---
Yeah but you can add burning effects onto laser rifles and it‚Äôs such a huge effect for damage. On top of that have you been griefed by anyone with the TSE lasers turned into shotguns with burning effect? I have and I can always hold my own against ballistics but I can‚Äôt against that laser.
---
Have any pics?
---
Thank you!
---
Someone did a analysis on FO76 RNG for legendaries and it seems that your inventory can affect the type of legendary you get. Sounds crazy, but if you favor a type of effect and have a lot of that kind of weapon in inventory or in your stash, there is a slight bias to get that effect on legendaries.
---
The way I see it, it's the biggest problem in the game right now. I feel fairly confident we'll see a fix before long.
---
Melee‚Äôs are better off with 2 star. Unless you‚Äôre hunting for like a super sledge then I‚Äôd do 3 star for the reduced weight
---
I dont think u can scrap them. U can make them at armor workbench

Hows the closest going?

The what now
---
"Oh, damn..." https://youtu.be/NZOFukA2V0A
---
I'm not sure if you can learn it by scrapping. I didn't even know I had it until I saw it on my bench, so I probably picked it up off a legendary.
---
Oh wait, you moved into James old Hospital Room.
---
Hey I have some support beams on those back corners lol
---
"Drop" the old backpack. This will destroy it, but you should have the crafting plan anyway. Craft a level 50 one to get higher bonus.
---
Reduced weight legendary effect only effects the base gun, all the mods increase the weight by loads and won't be effected by thr legendary effect!
---
What are you looking for help with specifically? The Heavy Gun cards go without saying, you'll want low endurance and charisma in favor of high strength, agility and intelligence. You'll want radicool for sure, and adrenal reaction. Unyeilding armor, but Heavy Guns synergizes well with Power Armor, so you'll probably be losing the Unyeilding effects most of the time. And of course Bloodied weapons.
---
Ye Beth please fix this bullshit of getting 3* stuff only for it to become 1* the next day it‚Äôs seriously getting on my fuken nervs
---
I hate battle royale that's why
---
Lead pipe from forest events. Guitar sword from level 3 safes. Plasma grenade from ash heap events.
---
I have the most bloodied because I kept buying them every better one I have, and the most unyielding since every armor piece is that and I don‚Äôt hold any other legendaries. I always get the damage bonuses or reduction legendaries and nothing else.
---
I‚Äôm not doubting you but it definitely is broken on my end or I‚Äôm just extremely unlucky.
---
Burn the Witch!
---
Yeah I went back to salt 3. It only gives 30 carry weight for the mod and the thing that annoys is it doesn't work while in pa. So you have to swap back to salt anyway if you use excavator to get around. The high capacity is nice, have that one too. I think going to try the lead lined next.

I should not be laughing as hard as I am and I thank you for that, been.... a shit day so thanks for the laugh friend

---
I‚Äôm not thinking about setting all my SPECIALS to 8 to go the easy path ;-)
---
The game regularly does not recognise any carry weight perks, or lower weight legendary effects! Requiring restarting thr client to fix!
---
I can‚Äôt offered much bloodied help but I love to roll the heavy weapons. 
---
I think the 50 cal and Gatling are the two best options. With strength I have all three heavy weapon damage multipliers and bear arms. My ultracite Gatling laser weighs 1.2 lbs. I use to like missile launchers until they nerfed demo expert. I‚Äôve never played with a harpoon fun enough to see how it does. The Plasma just isn‚Äôt my style but it has a stupid fast fire rate. Mini gun with Explosive is a blast as well. 
---
Then stabilized. It offers AA but only in PA. The PA restriction sucks but you gotta have some type of AA. 
---
With my  ***TS faster fire rate Gatling fully modded it cracks out 191 per shot. It chews through SB. My action hero 50 works really well on sheepshquatch. 
---
The down side, ammo. When I have less than 2k for either I get anxious. Last SBQ I used over 4K rounds.
---
Normal .50 gets the boost, but you're using a precise .50.
---
For science, of course.
---
Wasn't it Georgia? Or something like that?
---
Fair enough you don't have to like it but it's a hugely popular genre for a reason.
---
Hahaha
---
Watch for duped stuff after doing that. For some reason my PA parts duped in the PA frame. Had equipped parts and identical unequipped parts in inventory. Only time I have system generated dupes is somehow related to the no spawn pont bug.
---
Sherpsquanch
---
The only specifics to a bloodied HW build would be adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and an emergency protocols torso.
---
ah, 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Okay. you have to go stand your armour in the yellow power armour frame to modify or craft new parts.
---
if you don't have your armour in the frame, you need an empty PA frame. otherwise you cannot craft anything.
---
it doesn't work like weapons bench or armour bench in that way.
---
so, simply walk up the the PA workshop thing while wearing, and click craft. (or modify/repair)
---
Never understood why it's so popular. In my opinion it ruins the game because it attracts all the 12 year olds and gets the most attention and so the other game modes are neglected and i just don't like playing it. At least that's what happens with BO4.
---
We're talking mostly for PvE here.  
---
While I'd like to say the burning effect is great, it really isn't.  
---
Against the majority of enemies it probably comes out as maybe an extra 1% damage in the best case scenarios and is still something that doesn't gain benefit of armour penetration.
---
Explosive can no longer be applied to Lasers as it causes them to break, so TSE Lasers are not a point to talk about as they are incredibly rare since they no longer drop.  
---
PvP is really the only time energy damage has any chance to shine, and that's because of the way you stack your resistances in your build.  
---
Most players stack purely physical resistance and don't care about energy or radiation resistance, and most armour that you want to be using like Combat Armour generally has medium resistance to energy damage while strong physical resistances.  
---
Hence why I ran with Grounded Mutation for a while until I wanted to actually use Laser/Plasma weaps because that extra 100 energy resistance works really nicely.
---
only times I use PA are 1) nukes, 2) when I need the jetpack, 3) When I'm in another player's camp and I think "this is starting to get a little high off the ground"
---
Since you are done with the game, I'll take your stuff.
---
Unlucky for me was it opened one right under me and the loot dissapered after a little bit of trying to get it back
---
Well if this is true it should have been in the patch notes
---
Here's something someone wrote up a few days ago. Give that a read. Should answer most if not all of your questions. Also has a link to Official Bethesda site for more content.

Damn, I thought the two that hit my camp today were bad. :(
---
Apparently all the helmets are 100% learnable by scrapping one. Least that's what I heard about it from a few other sources.
---
Yeah I'd simply be happy if perks affected our stash. Like an idiot for the longest time I never realised this wasn't the case and kept getting annoyed at playing inventory management the game until I realised I needed to do a lot more math and my backup aid and ammo items were really filling up my stash box. Even if the stash box showed actual item weights and total weights so it would be much easier to know where the stash limit is being eaten up for us players like me who don't know better.
---
Guess your luckier than me. I‚Äôm on Xbox...
---
And it nerfs action point regeneration instead of buffing it
---
damn dude all I‚Äôve found is a precise .50 where can I get the .50 normal or hardened .50?
---
Idk how but I actually found two of the broken pro snap cameras in west tek Inside of a toolbox. And they were the actual quest item ones and not the junk ones. They were located in the misc section of my inventory. Can‚Äôt drop them for people tho :(
---
my game is in a constant state of low fps now. the mouse lags in the menus, turning my camera feels slow and janky instead of smooth like it used to.
---
I have a 1080ti btw so its not my computer.
---
For me BR is really good because it doesn't have the instant respawn mechanic that I hate in more traditional fps death match style games it has much better pacing and actual tension. My hope is it benefits all game modes by improving combat mechanics. I respect your concern though.

Plenty of times, gets a little frustrating honestly. Buy a 3 star legendary piece of armor that is all but useless because its all but useless standard leather armor or trapper armor or a junkies pipe pistol long after pipe weapons were useless for anything but a bug squasher. Its not even I get totally useless junk, I mean crap just a few minutes ago I got a 3 star combat rifle that is relatively useful because it does damage to animals, bashing damage, and 50 percent damage resistance when aiming but I'm about to toss it because my 1 star vampire combat rifle is ludicrously more effective, took down a scorchbeast with that guy and a crapton of ammo. 
---
I like that they have legendary vendor but I dunno, it seems really frustrating to me. I know it would be completely game breaking to let you select what gun or armor you want but I'd like if they were more level appropriate.
---
I go with the one that provides superior recoil.
---
The lack of helmets with good dmg protection are really lacking in this game.
---
Thanks for that! I never saw that post, so I'm glad you linked it to me. Probably will end up buying it now, so thanks again for the help!
---
Wow, I thought I misread the notification because I was in combat and just saw it flash past, only to check later and same as you.
---
All my ammo regardless of base price is set at 1 cap, so it seems there‚Äôs something common here.
---
Noting the ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt happened to me‚Äù comments, I wonder if it‚Äôs the combo of lowest possible price, tax deductions, and quantities sold that kick off the bug. Surely there‚Äôs some allowance for 1 cap transactions because they can‚Äôt pay fractions of a cap to you. And stacking items just goof it up somehow.
---
Anyhow, silver for visibility. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I had this happen (not legendary) to my PA parts. BSG is so bad a dupe glitches, they spontaneously occur. I suspect server lag is allowing this to happen in some way.
---
To Those answering, here‚Äôs a more precise question:
---
How does lone wanderer, action person, and AP refresh gear interact, what is optimal, what is overkill, what is just diminishing returns.
---
Same question for PA mods related to AP
---
You can check the range stats when u hover over it in mod menu..take the one with the most range if u like
---
If I need any longer, I log out.
---
Which mutations do you use? Do you feel explosive is a game changer when choosing weapons or should i be looking for other effects?
---
Back pack is work over everything except PA
---
All the way, Airborne!

---
You get to snipe with a little bit of gun fu play for normal adventuring, and then break out your B.F.G. for the hard encounters. This build is designed to use a Gauss Rifle, Plasma Flamer (they work off of rifleman), and .50 Cal Machine Gun. Add consumables and an endangerol syringer for more fun. I use a more optimized version (dumped END, maxed out adrenaline and heavy guns perks) and have a blast with it. Make sure you grab every bit of copper, lead, and steel you can find.
---
If you want I can give you the dimensions of my camp because I have never had build budget problems and I'm only level 74
---
I got a nocturnal explosive combat shotgun, which is the best thing I‚Äôve received. Everything else has gone straight back, not suited to my build.
---
Current perk set up, on  the fence on investing in demo exp or use those points for something better. Suggestion on mutations? I'm leaning towards t-51 for the high resistance.

Srry not supposed to reply to u,was for op
---
I totally understand, just figured the other guy deserves to hear it.
---
I bothered to unlock all the mods for it, and that required me to world-hop, then scrap around 20 blasters. The worst part about it is that the mods seem to break it in VATS. You will have a 95% VATS hit chance on an enemy and miss every single shot. The damage is bad enough, but not being able to hit anything makes it truly useless.
---
Do you have the herd mentality mutation?
---
Lol
---
Check your mutations, do you have Empath?
---
Sure I can do that I'm on the Xbox. You wouldn't happen to have any Violet I could purchase do you?
---
How substantial is the healing from the medic effect?
---
It's a random point in your camp, moving the camp device makes no difference!
---
Safest way is to let a friend hold it.
---
Why you ask? Just a waste of time? That's something of great value to Bethesda, in a never ending online hamster wheel.
---
Same here the first time. The second time I tried to convince myself that the Suppressor's Lever action yada yada was ok. I just don't get what's all the fuss about level rifles vs. a good handmade. I should scrap it. I also got an AA shotgun that's not bad.
---
More important is that players are now selling perfectly good 1 and 2-star weapons for reasonable money at their camps. I had no issue scrapping my Zealot's 1-star .50 heavy machine gun for an AA version for 1000 caps. So easy to do and a much more useful perk. 
---
Oh, I also got an explosive black powder pistol. My first and only explosive at L122. Not a fan of powder weapons, but it's still now my most powerful ranged weapon. Shame there doesn't appear to be any mods for them...
---
I load to see stats like that during loading screens.
---
Do backpacks take up the chest slot? Over regular armor?
---
If nessary you can request an atom refund!
---
You've got a really solid perk load out. Ditching demo expert is up to you, I personally don't use it for my build. You might want to consider switching out concentrated fire for something else as well. VATS isn't great for heavy weapons. Everything else is about as good as you can get.
---
I mentioned it several patches ago. One if the community reps said they would look into it. Nothing has happened yet, so you may be stuck with it.
---
A friend reported to me that herd mentality isn't displaying under effects while solo. The -2 sure works though.
---
It‚Äôs the cold truth sorry not sorry
---
Making a new character can be frustrating at first. But you do not share stash space with any other character. An if you need to move things between characters and a friend isn't available you can simple make a post on reddit and find someone with high karma, I suggest 100+ to help you as well. They usually dont charge much if anything at all.
---
Same thing just happend to me, got them all for free was super confused
---
As in replaces chest armour? No.

A trusted friend or someone w high karma. If you‚Äôre on XB1, I‚Äôll help you.

I love my explosive lever. GREAT sniper.

Ahahahhaahaha you think they can see...
---
Thank goodness.
---
I honestly do not know as I've never really tested the medics weapons. My limited experience was that it seemed to heal a small chunk of health as opposed to vampires which only heal a tiny amount on each shot.
---
Considering the lack of perk cards that are required for bloodied builds and the lack of armor on low levels in the forest..... I'd imagine this is a pretty good weapon to start with.
---
I'll test it once my mules shed some weight. I may have had a legendary hoarding problem.
---
Different stash. That's how some level 5's are selling level 50 gear in some servers. And you're correct about how to load them. Another riskier approach  is to take note of who is in your world, drop all your goods into a permanent storage unit, like the blue suitcase at Whitesprings station, log out, change character, log back into the game where the same people in your recent list are, and, with a little luck  you're back in the same world, with all your goods in the same container.
---
They go OVER everything
---
Also, for the current weekly, photos taken inside the Whitespring property walls doesn't count as Savage Divide. Apparently WS is its own named area in the files.
---
Im surprised u stayed in that server
---
I had "god rolls" for weapons I didn't use! Damnit I'm a pistol main atm.

If I was using my heavy I'd be set, or my rifle character I'd be set. But no.

Thought I could get him, but only did when i had a critical
---
Hold off for what?
---
Just found mine. At last ;)
---
I'm not familiar with this. Or at least it isn't ringing any bells. What kind of enemies?
---
It still takes a lot of stable Flux and mats to craft. Also not everyone has level 50 gear. If you have an X-01 vending booth, I'd bet it would still kill at the right price point.
---
It took some time, but I've sold enough low cost pieces to pay for the original plan costs. Though it took like 20 parts.
---
I would suspect so because I have .50 regular receiver does quite a bit more than a hardened .308 receiver
---
AP refresh armor modifies a different value to Action Boy, Lone Wanderer and Nerd Rage, but the same value as corn soup and some other consumables. My guess is that it's an additive modifier to the action point regen per tick (I don't know the base value), while the perks are multiplicative instead. 
---
Each piece of armor adds 5 points, versus 3 for corn soup. How high does it stack? Not sure without testing. There's no cap in the game data, but there may be one elsewhere, as with the movement speed cap.
---
Pretty sure that the code locked lab over at Tanagra town will 100% have the  shielded plan in it
---
code is 748250
---
Go 2 i use one for questing as the one is a sneak commando but can run very long distances, the other is heavy gunner grinding queen and legendaries with sentinel gear
---
They screwed up when they allowed transfer between adventure and survival for sure. I'd love to see the metrics on how much survival servers are used. I suspect it's much less than when they first opened.
---
It‚Äôs very viable from a stat loadout point to do this.  I have a character for each weapon style, and stat point wise melee and shotgun are very similar.  Heavy I went high charisma just to have a high charisma character since vats with a heavy gun seemed meh.  However those charisma points could easily be shuffled to agility.
---
My stats would be 15/3/3/4/8/15/5 with 3 being debatable in perception end or luck depending on what you like.  If you go full bore mutations then luck is potentially mandatory for class freak (with starched of course mandatory and one gun army potentially mandatory)
---
I will say that I from time to time wish I had one high level versatile character and 2 mules, but my style Tends to be to fill character slots and try different play styles.
---
Im fairly active on trading sub, and it's discorcd channel is very active for PC in particular, queen and other events are constantly being called out there. I just generally don't like them as they require dropping off anything I was doing prior, and there's so much of that anything I like doing.
---
Ah yes that explains how some like the Fixer, it should be good compared to most single stars and to many medicore 2 stars, I was more like comparing it to good 2 stars and thinking, well those listed effects don't really seem so great.
---
Nah mate, just bashed the hell out of it with a hammer
---
Sounds about right. If something doesnt get enough attention, usually nothing happens.
---
The old trick here is that Sentinel still works when you're jumping, as long as you don't move sideways. Not sure whether they fixed that yet.
---
I run. With 5 MG42s and 5 gatlings. Cycle depending on the enemy. My fav was a executioner's lmg - thing would rip through WestTek. Lost it to the dissapearing stuff bug 3 or so weeks ago. :(

Nice! I love fun ideas like this. Do you run PA or not? I see adamantium skeleton and stabilized both.
---
True, but this is to just avoid that altogether.
---
Only the Refined and Standard .50 hunting rifle receivers deal more damage than the Hardened receiver. The Standard is fractionally better than the Refined, because Bethesda.
---
Ya, I've decided to try and sell some parts. I have excavator legs with shocks attached in my vending machine. I'm going to buy the x-01 shocks and jetpack plans, and sell modded parts. See how it goes. I need something to use this flux on. Also, I'm going to repair them to 200%, then sell it. I think it will look better in the shop all maxed out.

Hi there, is it possible you can do this for Treasure map locations? They're a pain and a half. thanks so much for your work

And completely unnecessary because you can already put stuff all over the vending machines.  You can put stuff on the shelf, put posters over the wide bits, even put the small lettering on it to describe what's inside.

I‚Äôve had a similar experience doing monster mash.  Saw it up and someone else in there but never saw the person.  Then realized the event wasn‚Äôt sounding off.  Figured I had just missed it, but it was up and the guy was in there by the map. 
---
Funny thing was charred ghouls were spawning like the event, and it never ended even when it had on the map.  Killed ghouls til my weapon broke and cursed myself for not having a backup.
---
Another tip: Meat piles also count. The camera will recognize what the meat pile once was, and it will count towards challenges.
---
Funny thing - few weeks ago someone ask what other modes than survival we expect to see sooner or later.

I, not that i wish for nor intend to play it, said that i could imagine a battle royal mode because...every game today seems to "need" it for some reason. Got down voted into oblivion.

I only use PA with the 50 cal. Normally I'm running around in deep pocketed combat armor. I'm not well versed in endurance perks (I always have mine at 1) so I just picked what looked useful. Feel free to swap adamantium skeleton to whatever you need.

Had another guy who said it didn't work on his IE lever rifle. Best guess was that the explosive damage was applied first and prevented Instigating from working on the ballistic damage, but in that case I don't know why your lever rifle would work.

Or vice versa.
---
The Vintage Football Uniform clips badly through every piece of armor I've worn it under.
---
The preview pictures never show it with armor, despite being classified as underarmor.  I'm convinced it wasn't supposed to be, but the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing at Austin.
---
That's because Bethesda disabled them. But I'm talking about why they did that
---
Stabilized does work with explosive launchers. Power armor will certainly help with your survivability once you get it; it has approx. 45% innate damage reduction(if wearing a full set)  in addition to the DR/ER ratings.
---
I got the plasma grenade plan from a super mutant at West Tek earlier today.
---
Yesterday I spotted a defend event that said to defend it from the scorch beast...I then looked and the holder was a level 30.  Hmm, I thought.  Let me get over there and take a look what's going on.
---
Fast travelled to the Pumpkin house then legged it over to the truck stop and could see the 65 scorch beast circling.  Headed indoors, grabbed my trusty tri-barrel Zealot's Explosive minigun (named Black Betty though she is chromed) and Jetpacked to the roof.
---
"Eat this."
---
I found the level 30 huddling away under cover.  Gave him the thumbs up, got a wave and then headed on my way.  Job done.
---
The rapid barrel is so much more fun...but damn it burns through ammo far too quickly. :P
---
Well your no fun, clearly the gas is making u cranky. And overly logical.
---
Hahah thats a little too risky for my anxiety having ass haha
---
If you would have looked in the comments instead of posting a snarky comment, you would have found that out.  Level 3 safes at pleasant hills cemetery in ash heap.
---
I've only gotten invisible on my first load of the day, every time. I dont go there immediately anymore. And yes, legendary drops are a lot rarer now. I refuse to say it's because of the purveyor but it's hard not to think it.
---
Yep rebars and vents and all arms and legs, nothing new. Someone just nuked the fissure site (PS4), only one other guy showed up, everyone else on that server either stayed in their shop or were farming WS ans WT. Poor loot killed the endgame boss.
---
I find I'm getting new ones faster than I can resubmit the old ones...
---
Do you have the blight disease?
---
I haven't earned atoms from challenges in like 2 weeks.
---
Played the whole time, just not gotten anywhere near half the things they expect me to do, and honestly I don't plan to.
---
Daily/Weekly Challenges were fine when I could knock them out through regular play, but wearing PJ's while over 76 or under 20, in a Fasnacht Mask?
---
I just want to finish the quests, not play Dress Up for less than a cup of coffees worth of virtual currency, while going out of my way to find the outfits in the first place, further delaying the quest.
---
The World/Survival challenges aren't so bad, they're what I expect.
---
It's the amount of effort we have to put in for so little reward (and the "Value" of Atoms can be debated until eternity), that makes me not care about them any more.
---
It feels like a dirty trick to get me to spend real money for things I want in the atom shop, especially with the timed deals.
---
Carrot and Stick, I get it, just don't be so obvious Bethesda. I'm a person, not a Labouring Donkey.
---
they suck. i swapped out of shotguns into rifleman and use a plasma flamer
---
And, regarding the mole miners; I believe them to be normal people aswell. Have you ever seen such industrious muties or critters?
---
PSA: if you let the scorchbeast take over the workshop and ‚Äúfail‚Äù the event, you‚Äôll get a Retake Workshop quest which will require you to kill a bunch of scorched there without the air support. Significantly easier, significantly faster.
---
Just say no to scorchbeasts.
---
And you have to waste the sleigh and reindeer to get presents to drop.
---
Fukkin reindeer....
---
The three star legendary head lost all three stars? Wow
---
You are a true hero. The bat signal went up and you were there
---
There's no real story, but it's like a Scooby Doo episode, there's mystery, but no monsters.
---
I don't know if it was dupped or something, but that helmet is everywhere. Several people were selling them for as low as 50c. Just check people's vending machines and you'll find one for sure.
---
Do you play on Xbox?
---
I‚Äôll have to try that out... like plasma pistol or plasma Gatling?
---
What type of rated R Scooby-Doo episode is this!
---
Ah I remember that when I was similar level. Yeah I admit I freaked the hell out and thought it was awesome feel they got in the game with it
---
Read the notes left in the campground to (kinda) see what's going on
---
If you stick around long enough you would have seen pictures spinning on the walls. There‚Äôs a terminal with a guest log that talks about the hauntings there.
---
The ghoul opening the door and running at me right when the picture turned a ton was what got me. I‚Äôm actually still a bit on edge.
---
PC
---
R? Nah, PG at best lol. 
---
Those aren't Ghouls, they're men in rubber masks.
---
Everyone wants to look like a raider but bgs nerfed raiders
---
Nm must be plasma pistol if your using riflemen perks. Curious to know your setup on the gun and legendary perks
---
Definitely has gotten better. Its only going to get better from here!
---
yes
---
That's where I built my camp. I love to sit outside right after dark and listen to the screams. I can't wait till Halloween. It will all add to my camp atmosphere.
---
Oh I did see them turn and right as that happened the ghoul came through the door and ran straight at me.
---
They did, right after the ground shook.
---
The ganeis not without its issues for sure but personally it's a hell of a lot fun and currently the only game getting played on my Xbox
---
You could be sitting around to watch the new players get scared. Must be kind of enjoyable for the people watching, not as much for the people in it though
---
It all depends on why you didn't buy. It might not be your kind of game. Give this a read.
---
I read them if I bring myself to go back
---
I managed to fast travel to one, but it was gone when I got there. 
---
Was set up in an unmarked cabin too, so how I managed to travel there... Who knows?
---
Lol congrats!
---
The one in the vendor you saw probably came from the one on the table next to the artist‚Äôs chair that sits on the roof of West-Tek Research. False unearned pie not from the devil machine. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/5Dk2yKR
---
Yeah but then people would complain that they spent money on a camp item that they can‚Äôt place, in the case that they don‚Äôt own any of the games. I think it should come with a game but have it be a new one that doesn‚Äôt count for any of the challenges
---
Aww, you experienced it properly. I sniped off all the ghouls in that area and read all the notes about it before getting the scares. It wasn't nearly as good for me as what you're describing happening
---
You have no idea how hard I laughed when it happened. My wife thought I was insane.
---
This.
---
Dupers are duping while you type, Bethesda hasn‚Äôt done squat. I suspect they simply don‚Äôt have the ability to detect and delete duped items.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I wanted to experience it properly
---
It was a 2* and ya lost both quad and vats crit damage. I mean come on! I just lost 50 scrip for nothing.
---
The only thing I have locked is the room with my fusion generator bc I don't want mobs getting in. But just in case, I also put in a safe and a kitty hedge on top of the safe.
---
(Cats are hidden in several places around my CAMP bc I find it amusing)
---
I was going to make an arcade using terminals and the holotapes, but I was afraid people would come steal the holos.
---
Dude thats genius
---
It was released as a beta, so, yeah, the updates definitely improved it.
---
Check for herd mentality and the blight
---
I was discussing this earlier. As far as use goes I think I‚Äôm going to start getting 2 stars tomorrow. What I‚Äôm looking for is a good prefix and explosive so the third perk, vats or whatever isn‚Äôt that big of a deal to me. The vendor popped out 3 explosive weapons to my buddy in one day! That‚Äôs insane!!! Meanwhile I‚Äôm getting one star drops from the queen lol.
---
WasteLad, my personal favorite.
---
I picked up one of these from the vendor and am having a lot of fun with it.  Pity it's so slow to reload.
---
how is that one preserved!?
---
Agreed
---
That‚Äôs totally unacceptable. I only knew three star wood armors can decay into one star. Any other items would do this other than assaultron head and wood pieces?
---
Unplug your Xbox, wait a minute or two like go take a dump whatever plug it back in, reboot. Sounds dumb but may very well fix it.
---
Armor weight has a direct effect on sneaking. This can be found in the in-game "help" menu, which actually has some useful stuff.
---
Weightless heavy armor with an ultra-light mod (making it literally weightless) is your best bet. I can stay in caution and usually take out all the enemies with this and sneak perks.
---
As for Chameleon...I couldn't do it either. The constant animation drove me to get rid of it.
---
No no no no no... let's make it funny not regressive.
---
I think it'll just send you back down to whitesprings but we'll see.
---
[](/celestbraces)Conversely if we could have [this bug](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/579863083954995201/Photo_2019-05-19-214816.png) apply to more armor so I could see it with my outfit that'd also be awesome.
---
I assume the artist got it out of the port-a-diner with a hammer and chisel and brought it up on the roof.
---
Buff is badly tuned: 1% damage reduction
---
Hmmm. I don't know then.
---
Thanks, I'll filter through the perception perks and see what's worth placing
---
But of a biased space to ask but yes
---
Same here I went from 25k to 500c in 4 hours from player vendoring the other day lol
---
You are doing the Lord's work
---
It's a bit tricky because where you spawn in your camp seems to be different from where other players spawn.
---
Scorchbeast canonically where wiped off the map and went extinct after the queen died, and they took ultracite with them. Within the next 200 years we can assume all the ultracite was mined, and Appalachia becomes one big nuclear crater, so yea it all can tie in.
---
Calm down, Anakin. I asked my wife what the stats were. Double damage on full health, explosive, 25% VATS cost reduction. Score yourself five points for noticing.
---
Honestly I'm sort of surprised someone caught it, but that's reddit for you.
---
Add the Children of Adam lights!! That "bug light" yellow glow from the bottles gave instant character to a room.
---
And you know, the carpet really tied it all together...
---
Cheers!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure how true or consistent this is. I spawn at a relatively predictable area that I was able to chose by moving by camp platform. But when other players fast travel, they appear to spawn at the first place the camp platform was ever placed.
---
Hold off from buying. I don't have the game, thus I am asking this question.
---
Stick with the tea cup and hop over that. Found it 11 times then 1 time.
---
You washed it in hot water!!! You're suppose to only wash it in cold water!!!
---
But then you wouldn't have to buy a skin for each weapon or bit of gear. 
---
Gotta keep then atoms flowing.
---
I would be interested. I'm on PC
---
Ahhh to be in my twenties again. No kids, pretty gf, convertible....
---
Er...you meant level 20?? Nvmd.
---
Yea dude PM me
---
I don't know for sure. I suspect it has something to do with duping
---
It looks like a kid found his parent's armor.
---
1. Its worth it to go 15 Agility because there are a lot of really good perks in that stat.
---
2. The heavier it is, the worse it is for stealth.
---
3. I always use the shadowed mods and I'm almost never seen.
---
4. When you are far enough away from enemies while in combat, you crouch and if you are far enough you will go from \[Danger\] to \[Caution\].
---
5. I doubt anyone uses it because of the annoying animation as well as the fact that you basically cant wear armor for it to work.
---
6. Not sure.
---
Yeah. It comes through flat carry weight improvement instead of str improvement, which you nailed down pretty much perfectly, as far as I can tell. Easy to over look...marsupial is such a no-brainer for other reasons the carry weight is nothing but a nice bonus.
---
He spawns on cliffs. That's all I got sorry mate.
---
I keep waiting for that to get patched out, but...I will cry on that day.
---
 I love the 48 rounds in my quad exsplosive 10mm pistol. It chews through ammo, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.
---
Lol back when the punch bowl was working I had a level 7 come and drink some nukashine from it. I laughed and was like oh man where is he gonna turn up. He ended up in the heart of the mirr lol. I felt bad I fast traveled near him found him hiding in a shack and I gave him some low level legendaries for the trouble then had him fast travel back to me. Felt kinda bad at first but I think he ended up okay from it.
---
This only works for yourself. Other player's spawnpoint is always set based off where your CAMP was first placed when you set up CAMP
---
I randomly went to big freds bbq to see if i could get the free range event to spawn, nope got jumped by 3 scorch beasts and a bunch of conquerors, luckily a level 100+ player came along or it would have been a long fight, would have probably ran out of ammo too!
---
Hahaha dang I'm loving this. Power armor was cold that day üòÇ
---
I met Vengeful Mothman on the rocky cliffs just west of the wendigo caves this weekend. I‚Äôve had my fill for a long time...
---
People were spawning in my closed of generator room. So i made a door lol
---
But you need a crossbow to complete some of the pioneer scout quests. You can use it or sell pretty quickly I imagine.
---
I have three of these on PC. And all my friends have it. I bought a bunch from a vendor for like 100c each, cause I thought they were rare.
---
If you take more then one candy from the bowel you become wanted. :)
---
Omg at least do this for the piano
---
All the ammo is blank. It's the barrels that change. You have to scrap syringers to be able to make the different types.
---
Oh hey have been through there, never had that happen to me
---
Wahhhooo
---
Obviously it's going to be on the weak side. Low defense and no offense, but quite versitile. If it was me I'd take at least 6 pts in a weapon type, probably shotguns to take advantage of the concentrated fire.
---
if you own a brahmin pick it up in build mode and place it back down it will let you milk it
---
Devil Came Down to Georgia.
---
Thank you im glad im not the only one that feels this is unacceptable.
---
Yep. You're a no life.
---
You're not going to get banned. I've been reported dozens of times for "cheating" and I still play the game daily because I never cheated.
---
This is only true for yourself. Everyone else spawns at your Camp where you originally placed the Camp unit (aka the exact center of the camp), no matter how many times you move it.
---
I too am guilty of this
---
Where did you get the 60% value?
---
Best songs from Fallout 4 were Magnolia's. BGS should commission some original tunes for 76.
---
That didn‚Äôt work for me. I tried multiple things, even switched characters and relogged multiple times. Nothing worked unfortunately.
---
Its only 200 caps for a serum from a player
---
Isn't this likely working as intended? You start things off as casual and easy so people get comfortable with the game and the store. Then you gradually make it harder and harder to get the free currency. This occurs simultaneously to the rise of timed exclusive in the atom store. So they can't realistically save enough to buy all the exclusives they might want, so they buy atoms instead.
---
I guess its just those two items which is a total lose of scrip value. In an rng thing ur better off saying you got nothing for scrip instead of heres this u can only use it for this session
---
Sounds about right. People need to stop being sore losers.
---
The construction manual for the very 1st game implies that said game is a simulation to get Vault dwellers ready for the wasteland. That would mean that everything that happens after is also a simulation
---
Yeah, I hid in the cabin for a good 10 minutes waiting for a big thing to pop out... never did
---
Well, go stand by the barrels of radiation waste at Emmett's Disposal, north of Blackwater mine, until you mutate again. There's a decon shower there too. Starched Gene's before you use it though. If you don't get the mutation you want, you need to server hop to get it to work again.
---
1 lb per bag
---
Try to milk it once, then kill it, rebuild and repeat
---
She also needs to stop dropping 1 star wood pieces.
---
Yes.
---
I've found the ones in the wild never seem to work, but the ones for Free Range will work presuming you're the one to get to milk them first as they're on a timer.
---
I was just running around today between places and three scorchbeasts showed up and started harassing me (along with their entourage of scorched...)
---
 \&gt;The loot from them wasn‚Äôt quite worth the trouble but it was a fun experience.
---
Sooo Fallout 76 in a nutshell? lol
---
I found a couple pre owned copy‚Äôs for $9 Aus so now I‚Äôm forcing friends to play with me
---
A lot of people here have just adjusted to it and will say nothing is wrong. 
---
But if you look at it from an actual game design standpoint, yeah it sucks. The way it forces you to always go in and out of the menu is clunky and should have been simplified
---
I noticed this last night.
---
Just go with what works for you and experiment with diff perks
---
I've heard that it only reduces the BASE weight of the item, not the weight of mods applied to it. Haven't tested it myself though.
---
I've gotten garbage every time
---
Just because you don't enjoy a mode is no reason to remove it. Plenty of people enjoy PvP. You don't like it, don't play it, simple.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
But this isn't really "working" for me. I do just fine against level 20-ish and below, but going anywhere near the Whitespring when people are grinding gets me chewed up by ghouls. I'd like to get my hands on some legendaries but I don't even know how to start. That's been a whole other part of the game to me so far.
---
No
---
I have no clue what to do for a "build" either... kinda sucks, but if I try doing one I'm just gonna give up, because it might be too time consuming.
---
Buff, out of tune. -15% damage from scorchedbeast sonic shouts
---
So I can't add more to it?
---
You need some rifle perks and a good rifle to do well there
---
What if it wants to pay the queen a visit?
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I genuinely use the skulls i build as kill counts, successful stalk and hunt, or survival shootout kills, not including railway station skirmishes, and only counting the first kill against a player.
---
I seen these clubs (3star) going for 7k and up.
---
It worked for me. Before moving mine people would fall off the cliff behind my house. So I moved it to the front room on the first floor and people are spawning in my front yard now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Maxed, as in top level. 
---
No, not any higher than you already are.
---
I can just imagine some unit with Strength at 75 carrying 4 tons of weapons.
---
Yeah, that'll work.
---
üòÇüëç
---
What platform are you on?
---
No, you can only use 1 of each perk card.
---
Everytime I FT (Fast Travel) to another players CAMP I wind up right next to their CAMP Platform. So I got this hunch. Move the CAMP platform away from buildings and wholla problem solved.
---
Oh, I think I made a typo in my post, but this is what I was looking for, thanks!
---
Except the high capacity mod, which lowers yours defenses
---
Wish I could even buy anything from vendors
---
The skulls would be piling up for a raider. 
---
I've become a bit of a Raider myself lately. It's surprising how much junk people carry on them. Especially when they're building in workshops.
---
450 is the cheapest I‚Äôve seen. 500-600 is more common, and 1000+ is probably average by what I‚Äôve seen.
---
It's better to be overwhelmed than underwhelmed though, some of my best memories were discovering Whitesprings for the first time and evading scorched beasts and lvl 68 feral ghouls
---
Is that what solves the seismic mystery? I must‚Äôve done it by accident.
---
i can't po$$ibly imagine why
---
It's shady is what it is. Bethesdas greed over 10 cents worth of atoms is laughable. Not to mention all the challenges that have been broken since day 1.
---
It would be fun if they would actually land once in a while. They just do air strikes and poison the entire city, making it basically unwinnable.
---
That‚Äôs been a thing for a while.  There are YouTube videos on how to do it.  I have a round garden wall and a castle type turret blueprinted.  I‚Äôm planning a castle build for my next one...
---
That being said, having a complex build of my own, I appreciate the effort!!!  It really takes some painstaking work and a chunk of time focused on building and the various frustrations. 
---
We need floors with one edge that is square and the other that is angled from coring to corner.  That way we can put down proper flooring for builds like this.
---
Come grab whatever serums you want if on Xbox GT BLUBLZREDEUX. I'll be on tomorrow if you haven't found your serums by then.
---
As others have said, this only affects where you personally spawn. Everyone else will basically spawn right where you originally placed your camp module. So to prevent people popping up in foundations, you have to avoid building anything on that spot. If you don't want to spend the time replacing and re-building your camp, you can always place a workbench near the spot people spawn in at (since you effectively 'teleport' to any workbench you interact with).
---
There's a pretty effective shotgun build, so I wouldn't say he's right about everything. My question to you is - what does it matter what some tool on the internet said if you're casual and having fun? 
---
Since it does seem to matter, the "builds" everybody refers to are just the assortment of perk cards you choose to compliment and maximize your playstyle. You're probably choosing shotgun perks like Enforcer already. "Doing a build" would be very carefully deciding what SPECIALS and perks are going to max your damage or minimize the damage you take. There are websites that let you look at and play around with different builds. Look one up if you think you want to head away from casual.
---
Oh, and a lot of people don't sell shells because the people who craft them use them. And, crafting requires plastic which is a limited commodity. You can find shells on the market if you ask, though.
---
That happened to me at someone‚Äôs camp on the weekend. Lol
---
Pc or console? I‚Äôm xbox and I see 5-6 posts every night offering serums 150-250, hell I bought 3 serums last night 150 each.
---
I have, it does work here and there, but the blades can be a bit unwieldy at times. I've also tried crossbows, but let's be honest, those are cheating unless you have some distance. As in general I would just find it amusing to be able just chuck darts at people.
---
Dude shares the secrets of the universe with you, and you wanna kill him and skin him. What the hell. 
---
Me, I remained peaceful, gazed into eyes that have seen the entire universe, and didn‚Äôt get any wing. But when I die, on my deathbed, I will achieve total enlightenment. So I‚Äôve got that going for me, which is nice.
---
This is their way of making you buy them. Don't expect much to change.
---
I have 5 turrets and each of my 3 levels if 4-5x2
---
Me and my sister both have a storage mule...for the other person. Makes transfers easy.
---
Had to revive a friend multiple times to get it to trigger. I also had to remove all revive perk cards I had equipped. Failed 5times with on, worked first time without perk cards.
---
i'm more so pleased that i can play PVE now without being bothered by PVP players in adventure mode as often. PVP players have survival mode, but with the adjustments to survival mode i've seen a lot more of them in adventure mode trying their best to PVP there. 
---
&gt;!i personally love the camp PVP protection, nowhere near as much camp grief-ing anymore!&lt;
---
It‚Äôs not snarky, I don‚Äôt want to read most people‚Äôs mindless comments. You could have just easily elaborated in the description that ‚ÄúI found it here...‚Äù and that would have been a huge help to the community. People like myself just google search location of deathclaw gauntlet plan location fallout 76 to have to filter through all the garbage and incomplete wiki data for the game. I could say you were being snarky about bragging that you have all but three plans, it‚Äôs really just the way you read it and determine the language for yourself that can make it seem snarky.
---
I tried both and found that the its totally not worth it.  If the damage was significantly higher, then yes.  But right now the charging is more accurate, but ridiculously slow.  Its like a weaker gatling gun.
---
I got mine from a queen fight as well, not from the queen hereself but a grafton monster that appeared, wasn‚Äôt even legendary. Killed it, walked up and seen the dense mod plan and nearly shit my pants lol was hunting for that plan for 6 months. It‚Äôs definitely a game changer
---
Kinda what I was thinking I appreciate your response
---
Nope. Even with a +fire rate legendary one, it was ridiculous. It took forever to even kill a single glowing gulper. A level 65 legendary sheepsquatch took like 5-8 minutes of shooting from on top of a fence.
---
yeah my lever works like a beaut. no idea why my hunting rifle is like this.
---
I get a lot of that, but I would like to be able to farm legendaries or take on Scorchbeasts.
---
I've have 4k shells can sell for 2k if you take them all.
---
If they look in vendor camps they're probably seeing hire prices, someone last night was charging 5000 caps for serums, friggin' ridiculous.
---
 OP, go to the trade subreddit, you'll get it for cheaper.
---
There isn‚Äôt any weapons in the atom shop nor is there power armor. You are buying skins for them only.
---
Something similar happened to me yesterday twice!  Both times it happened shortly after I fast traveled back to my camp.  Enemies spawned nearby and got in a fight with my turrets.  I had a regular turret in between two missile turrets up on my roof.  after the fight, the two missile turrets kept shooting at the regular turret - and another regular turret on top of my water purifier was also shooting at it.  I had to store and re-place the turrets to get them to stop acting stupid.
---
come back later, please...  At level 1xx-something-doesn't-matter and up this is one of the better events.  You take the place, drop a box, gear the F up for scorched country, go you and get on top of the picnic roof and you wait... and you wait.. *zoop*  *buzzoop* You're like WTF?... Up spawn a bunch of Super Mutants.. Then you're like well fuck this... Quick action is to hop to your melee and go cut some mofo's up... Disappointed that you didn't get the ScorchBeast battle.
---
I totally would but I don't have 2k. Floating right around 1k atm.
---
I know that its just a skin man I'm not a noob I just thought the dragon fell under the "black powder rifle category for the skin
---
Nope, you are supposed to scrap the hides and pick up the magazines yourself from where they spawn :)
---
**The better part** of **valor** is **discretion.**
---
I just had to log off right now as i just punched my m17 alienware because i was in the middle of taking down my 1st 3* star legendary in days then all of a sudden an invisible mob just attacks me with high rad damage, and being bloodied build i died quick. Upon respawn i quickly took down the 3* legendary only for the game to crash to desktop! 
---
The constant lag and numerous bugs is making me really hate this damn game. I know it's not my hardware, and its not my internet connection either as i have the fastest internet that Xfinity can provide. 
---
If i can play any high end process intensive game with ultra settings with high fps and get no lag. 
---
Fallout 76 should be able to do the same. Which is why i would never get anything Bethesda from here on out.
---
Ah I see.. Yeah I'm not a shotgun guy either. End up with a bunch of shells
---
Just take a glance at the selection of perk cards the next time you level up. Find ones that interest you, or suit your playstyle. Start shifting SPECIAL points to try out these new perks, who knows, you might have the beginnings of a stealth sniper, or sneaky ninja. Just like other fallout games, you make the character up, not get set up from the start as a soldier or medic. Feel free to experiment with the system.
---
Old game engine, first online game and released too early. The only problem with this game is the price. It's Bethesda after all, we know what we where buying...
---
You can mod Fallout 76 and the servers don't mind? *Brain blown...*

Might be time to start a new character

I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd call those my best memories, but they‚Äôre certainly vivid.

And it would have took you less time to read the next comment than to type what you did *shrug* I‚Äôll leave it at that.

TBH, don't know if it's rng or just dumb luck. The group u run with has dropped and completed over 15 SBQ fights this weekend alone. And we have not seen 1 wood drop this weekend at all. We all share our loot and we have 2 that are trying to find that elusive weightless wood leg or chest. One of the reasions we run them so much is it takes us maybe 30 min max to run the silo and then at worst another 20in ( fastest was 5 min ) to kill the queen. We usually do 2 launches per server. Then hop to another one. Over 15+ legendaries 15 from the queen 15 from the event and then there's a good 15 from \*-\*\*\*star trash there's 6 that will always run a silo. And 5 more that can help but are usually helping other members with crafting/quests/loadouts/etc. But when we launch usually everyone on the server is @ V9 waiting for the event to kick off.
---
So yeah since the patch the group has done over 50 sbq kills we have had 1 wood armor( 1\* noturnal), drop and that's it.
---
Since I mean I don't know its an ancient ass black powder weapon
---
Well the only good point in defending against a bunch of Scorchbeasts is that's you'll get a bunch of plans. The bad points is that it's most likely gonna take a long time, you'll be wasting a lot of ammo and durability on everything you have, and depending on your level you might end up using a lot of stimpaks/radaway
---
Are you sure it wasn't the recipes? That sounds insanely over-priced.
---
Also this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9tow9/add\_character\_customizations\_for\_mutations\_in\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9tow9/add_character_customizations_for_mutations_in_the/)
---
Ok, because you get overwhelmed? Start using knives in close quarters. No ammo needed, just have a backup in case it breaks. Running away is an option.
---
I'm convinced that raiders from another region will come eventually. It would be such a waste not to implement it. I highly doubt they will keep the "no human NPCs" thing up forever. It's only a matter of time
---
Bethesda is Vault-tec, we are the the vault dwellers and fallout 76 is an experiment to see how many bugs we will tolerate before rage quitting!
---
Slightly off topic but not sure where to post.
---
Just wondering if there is another subreddit or dedicated thread where I can ask "Where do I find..." or "How do I complete..." type of questions for FO 76?
---
Just on YouTube. A lot of good and easy to understand videos on all types of builds. Look up ‚Äúbloody build‚Äù, it‚Äôs a fun one.
---
What's the source on the update for racks/stands? I can't seem to find it. :(
---
Jump* on
---
Tse are still good, but I believe that anti armor explosives are better now after the tse nerf. Also quad explosive double barrels are just crazy for close range
---
Bet you never thought you'd end up with an inlaw that looks like the damn sheepsquatch and nags like the freakin scorched beast huh? 
---
Because i sure haven't.
---
I have about 3k in caps but that changes wildly daily.
---
I mean the idea of rebuilding society seemed doomed the moment they incentivized repeatedly nuking the land. &gt;.&gt;
---
Positive. Serums and recipes aren't even in the same category.
---
Exactly this. xD
---
GT knucklessyrup message me.
---
I've been using All Rise since I got it.
---
I don't think there are definitive answers to your questions. 
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Agility says agi 15 gives you the same reduction as level 3 sneak.  With an agi in the high 20s, level 3 sneak is some improvement. It will depend what type of ‚Äùcover‚Äù you want to attack from, how much you mind taking damage, and the exact situation. 
---
I've never noticed much impact of weight or stealth legendary effects. But, I've never tested.
---
Escape artist lets you run for your life. I think it might make a difference in Sneak/walk vs. Sneak/run, but I've never tested. 
---
You are ‚Äùinvisible‚Äù with the chameleon mutation if you crouch or stand with a weapon raised. 
---
I've never noticed any VATS / stealth issues.
---
Lol yes this needs to be a thing!
---
Good luck.. I been making post for weeks about it..
---
In other fallout games all the enemies will level up with you to keep the difficulty constant. In FO76 everyone is a different level so the enemies levels are dependent on what part of the map you are in. If they‚Äôre too hard, level up and come back later.
---
i probably just need a good group to run SBQs with, i just help out whenever I see her up but I don't expect much anymore it's just exp at this point for me because my luck sucks then. üòî
---
Scorchbeasts with a shotgun an enforcer perk and concentrated fire is no problem, you just cripple the wings, they land, and you kill them. As for farming legendaries, that's just killing lots of legendaries, so I don't really get your issue. Are you having problems killing enemies with your Shotgun? If not, just kill lots of legendaries. If so, you do need to look at your build and your gun. Is it legendary? Does it have a hardened receiver at least? I could possibly help you out if you're lacking here. 
---
When I farm Whitesprings I just run a melee anyway (I'm a rifle build) to save bullets and let everyone get their hits in. If Whitesprings is nuked and you're farming it, melee is about the only polite thing to do anyway.
---
It was fairly well spread by players trading. I finally found one on one players vending as the item is now banned from trading on the trade subreddit. Brought it, recycled, learning the plans for it, then crafted few and listed on my vending for anyone wanting one.
---
I wouldn't wear it as it gives you perception degrease, and I think I've never seen anyone else to wear it either.
---
&gt;Note - the helmet is on PC but only by trading with people who got it from the dev room.
---
No, it's available on all platforms through dev room stealing.
---
Well if your on PC I can get you and intro into the group I run with
---
If there are higher level players around you, the enemies will scale to them instead.
---
I'd love a cigar smoking emote. Because I always sit places and just enjoy the view whenever I take a smoke break irl. :)
---
The only difference is the color scheme and it only has one mod slot as the standard backpack. The color is a bit darker like black with dark brown but it looks a bit better then the tadpole backpack.
---
Holy smokes, that's pretty cheap!
---
I really like how the entrance at the Top of the World is decorated, especially because of the tall junk walls, and would love to emulate something like that.  The walls we have now kind of suck if I am to be honest.
---
Fallout 4 also had some great decorations that would fit the bill.  There were barriers made from sharp metal spikes that were cool too.
---
Thanks for the offer! But sadly on PS4.
---
Yeah it seems pretty weak vs the Fo4 version
---
I fully support this
---
Definitely not
---
But when i bought unstopabbles 8,5and 4 from a player, the challenge wasnt finished. Stange
---
Offline now but I‚Äôm level 20. I‚Äôve not been playing much of the main quest I‚Äôve mostly just been exploring and doing side missions. I‚Äôm down for whatever my level won‚Äôt limit me for. Ain‚Äôt asking for help leveling up but I‚Äôve got a mic and could always use more friends in the game. IronGiant151 is the PSN.
---
Hmm because it's better?
---
\&gt;Despite it's hollow appearance, the Fatman still appears larger than a Gustav, with a lot my physicality and material too it. It's basically a giant metal sled style launcher. So if anything, a Fatman should weigh more than a Gustav.
---
Why? It's hollow and probably not made of steel.  
---
Your analysis is specious at best.
---
Pretty neat.
---
Cool cool, you have a deal sir and might as well check some liquors and plans while im at it. Thanks a lot
---
First rule of perk swapping: never ever swap out starched genes.  Minimum luck in this game is 5!  Starched genes and bloody mess (or some other variant).  
---
Yes it‚Äôs a pain in the ass, and for whatever reason Bethesda won‚Äôt yea or nay on their view of adding this in a future update.
---
Thanks, it's just a two level shack so I hope I won't have too much trouble.
---
I personally wish there would be NPC enemy groups that only have guns.
---
The 75% bonus to stealth perk will have profound effects on stealth even at lower agility points.  But it generally has a peak around 9-10 agility from what I've observed. Outside of power armor, you'll be able to sneak almost directly in front of most humanoids at 10 agility quite easily, even Scorchbeasts will fail to detect you at this amount.  I'd like to first say that what I'm about to say next is mostly anecdotal, if there is actual data contradicting anything i'm saying, then I apologize.  
---
Subsequently higher agility increments above 10 don't really have that much of an effect.  I've noticed diminishing returns, since the majority of enemies will cease detecting you at around 9-10 agility with Sneak at rank 3.  The only enemies where higher agility has a possible observable difference are highly perceptive ones, such as Yao Guai, certain robots, and a few insects.
---
To give you an example of my testing, a level 60ish Dusky Yao Guai at 12 agility (10 base +2 boosted from resistant lining Road Leathers, no special armor mods, or legendary pieces with stealth benefits) using all Sneak 3, and Escape Artist in daytime hours, the Yao Guai will become aware of me (caution) at around 6-7ish meters when looking straight ahead.  Without Sneak 3, looking straight ahead, that Yao Guai will become aware of me at around 10-12 meters away.
---
When boosted to 15 using a 3+ agility food item, the Yao Guai was able to be aware of me at **maybe** 5-6ish meters away when it was looking straight at me, but it was kind of hard to tell, because it seemed so close to the previous distance. Either way, when a Yao Guai starts investigating after being shot, neither boosted numbers seemed enough to evade detection at around 7-8 meters away, since enemies tend to become a little more perceptive when trying to track you down and are looking straight in your direction.
---
But anyway, onto some of the other stuff.  From what I've read, armor weight supposedly does affect your stealth, since you make noise when you walk.  But movement noise seems to be taken completely out of the equation when you equip Escape Artist, since part of the benefit is that you no longer make noise when 'running' in stealth mode.  
---
Things like armor weight, and muffled modifications only really seem to matter when you're not using Escape Artist, because that's really the only time you make noise while sneaking.   
---
As far as legendary pieces go, I'm just going to assume it works the same way it does in Fallout 4, since a lot of what applies in Fallout 4 seems to apply to 76.  A single chameleon armor piece won't do much for your stealth, but they stack with each other, so if you're rocking a 5-piece set of chameleon armor, you might be able to do something like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KafRotrxn0k)
---
Thanks!
---
I sell used cores because I don‚Äôt use them, really.
---
I keep some full powered ones for the times I really need them - and if end up with an abundance of anything less, I start to sell them. Sometimes I‚Äôll even leave a couple for people in their camps or at the Whitespring.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with selling used cores. I‚Äôd sell a 2 charge for 2 caps if I had one.  
---
There‚Äôs just something wrong with viewing the condition of the cores, I guess.
---
Our universe doesn't have power armor either.
---
The Browning Automatic Rifle weighed about 20 pounds.
---
"buildless noobs that don't know what they're doing." Fuck that guy! Shot guns a fun!
---
I actually just had two very different CAMP experiences.  1-  near a scorchedbeast hangout...  one starts to come near, I hear the defenses start firing, send a few shots too, then the house disappears.  I book it to safety.  2- same scenario, only the owner comes out and we kill the SB together.  Loot for all, and happy days!
---
Bought a lot of his stuff too.  Cool guy, shoulda got his name...
---
I would like to see some Scorched bosses in Power Armor and using Heavy Weapons.  They could also be wearing unique looking Power Armor, like the Tribal Power Armor from Fallout 3 or Scorched Sierra Power Armor from Fallout New Vegas.
---
It isn't a legendary shotgun, I just maxed out its damage with mods.
---
I had the same thing happen to mine! It was a 3 star Quad Assultron Head. It was super nice, loaded up all the way to 20.
---
Logged in the next day, and it turned into a 2 star and the Quad was missing.
---

---
The problem is that things I personally don't agree with aren't necessarily "flaws in this game."  
---
Your problem, and many others' problem around here, is how you frame these arguments as if you are the arbiters of all that is true and good in the universe when you're just some piece of shit scrub posting on an internet forum.
---
The Wasteland is a rough place to raise a baby - had to resort to spoiled brahmin milk last week because the misses wanted to mutate ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If it was a clean, fresh from the Vault rattle, trust me when I say it's worth it's weight it bullets that will come flying at you the first time they shake the SOB.
---
It also has the MIRV attachment. The 90% reduced weight effect only reduces the base weight of the gun and then the weight of the mods are added.
---
also this
---
Because it's much larger than a Gustav. And it doesn't matter that it's not a tube, when it's twice as wide, it'll have the same amount of material. Look at pictures of characters holding the Fatman, compare them to soldiers holding the Gustav. You'll see what I mean.
---
And really. You don't think the Fatman is made of steel? It's the fallout universe. It's the futuristic 1960's. Everything is made of steel.
---
My camp is right up the ridge of that place. I do enjoy the occasional high pitched scream to break up the sweet racket of all the caps I make off my  vendor machine.  Also There‚Äôs a junk pile to the North to build on and it‚Äôs a decent place to farm the ranger outfit or other miscellaneous junk, also I love to test out a new weapon i just got. Always Ghouls about!
---
Keep sucking Bethesda‚Äôs dick, Fallout 76 was dead in the water by the start of 2019 ü§≠üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That means that... we... drink bug repellent...?
---
Gross
---
Why should every weapon type work the exact same way?
---
You can submit a ticket. I think they are pretty good about giving your atoms back for mistakes... With in reason of course. So iv heard anyway. I bought the red stove to look nice next to my nuka cola machine but i need the plans also. Im going to chalk that up to lesson learned and keep it.
---
Also i need plans for a red stove.. Plz put them in your vendors üò•
---
lolk. 2018 called and it wants to give your premature ejaculation of a troll back.
---
Helpful tip: remember to include the system you're playing on, and relevant information such as what quest you were on, where in world you were, what if any enemies you were engaged with etc
---
Thanks mate
---
I got attacked by three scorchbeasts at once back in december as i was taking control of the ammo factory. Eventually like three people came to try and take it over and uh...They killed me and that's when the scorchbeasts showed up, so...i just booked it out of there.
---
Legendary weapons are great! But I think that Good junk and plans are the real treasures in player vending.
---
Players tend to assume a three star weapon is worth 5x the price. Of course there are exceptions, but I've found that people are asking way too much for legendary garbage. Who the hell is gonna pay 1000 caps for a level 30 Assassins pool cue?
---
No one.
---
Lower leveled players tend to try to over price things. You can get great deals from the higher level players just trying to get rid of junk. Eventually, the player economy will balance out. I sell X01 jet pack torso pieces for 250 caps. I don't bother visiting lower level vendors anymore. But you can really cash out by choosing to shop at higher level players.
---
1: It makes a world of difference. I‚Äôd say the actual perk matters more, and you start to become an insane stealth god once you get it high enough. For the record, stealth is harder in 76 than in most games. You need both, and a ridiculous level of speed in order to get through a place without being detected. The same is true for PVP.
---
2: Armor weight should be generally low. I personally think Ultra Light is enough.
---
3: they stack and it becomes ridiculous when you have the whole set,  but it overlaps in spot with Sentinel and Cav, which are perceived as better effects (I‚Äôm now realizing that they‚Äôre not)
---
4: Escape artist kinda throws off enemies when you sneak. Look up Shadow Warrior from Skyrim. Essentially the same thing but it works while you sneak to toss Caution to Hidden. Seems to be once every 5 seconds.
---
5: Chameleon should be on one piece of armor and that‚Äôs it. Nothing more, and definitely no mutation. Get a set of Vanguard armor. The invisible stuff is manageable for me, it blocks you from Vats in PVP, so people have to free fire aim. It‚Äôs too important not to run.
---
6: Suppressors seem to be bugged out the ass right now. I‚Äôm only hitting 50 percent of my shots in vats (even when displaying 95 percent chance to hit). Melee is apparently worse. Vats in general is spotty, hitting much less than directed. It deserves a fix.
---
Alright thanks for the info
---
Some dude the other day said that if you have a camera in your hand when you sit down, you can emote.  Haven't tested it yet, but it stuck in my head as useful info.
---
That‚Äôs good
---
Yep, the scoutmaster bot even says, "Drink this and those bugs will think you taste nasty," or something like that.
---
 My best escapade was finding a guy at his camp, gunning him down through the window, taking his junk, getting slapped with a 200 cap bounty then running around dodging a future friend for a half hour before shooting it out at hemlock holes. Good manners as a raider got a new friend out of it.
---
Ok. 
---
PS4, The missing link, an organic solution, and early warnings.  Berkley springs. And scorched.
---
i hate this challenge
---
Ok as a part/hvy/shotgunner.
---
1. Ammo is going to be your grind. Everything we use eats it like candy going out of style. On average toting 8k 50cal, 5k 5mm, 30 plasma cores, and 20 fusion cores. Not counting my 4k shotgun shells and 2k 45.
---
That is what I consider my basic loadout. Shotgun for silo /trash. Hvy for queen/SQ.
---
As to perks. This is from someone who does Not play a low helth build. So take it with a grain of salt.
---
Drop concentrated fire. Nto needed you will kill your core with cats.
---
Drop life giver no need to add more health to you it just takesore rads to get you to 20% health
---
Drop explosive. Max out gunsmith and power user. Ya don't need patch on all the tile only for repairs
---
Pa breaks so slowly no need for it to be equipped.
---
Don't need action bow/girl since your not useing vats the only thing you use ap for is sprinting/jetpack.
---
Stop one gun and pit seridipity inita place . One gun is not as good as it sound and just takes up points for better cards.
---
I don't use dodgy either since as a PA build you surrounded by others in a fish. So adds getting to you is not a big thing. But as. A low helth I'm not sure. I still get taged a few times in a sbq fight and rarely need a stim pack. But as low helth youight find you need it.
---
Also. Super dupper ammosmith, and chemist for when your crafting ammo. Are all NEEDED. As you will have issues with keeping a supply of ammo on you.
---
50 cal, Gatling Lazer, Gatling plasma fat man's, rockets are main fights aka squeen or SQ.
---
Gatling is what you want to start useing on small fights or go rifle/shotgun/Melee for smaller fights /mobs.
---
Hence why I haveu shot gun cards maxed so I just seap from one to on the as needed.
---
Oh and remember scrapper is your friend. For 1 until perk almost doubles your yeild of scrap. So you get all that gloroius steel when breaking down weapons.
---
Lucky hole mine and excavator armor for lead, scrap for steel, abraxo for acid, and your basically set.
---
Warning you will come to love the acid nodes and workshops around. But don't plan on storinguch else in your stash. 550/800 of my stash is devoted to ammo and mats to make my ammo. I usually run luck hole mine 2 times a week for 400 lead ore, witch givee close to 3k lead scrap gunpowder I either get from killing muties, or make with acid and cloth.
---
Just as an example. This weekend my group ran 15 SBQ fights. I used 35k 50cal, 5k 5mm 100 plasma cores (150%) 14 fusion cores (pa only 100%cores) 8k shotgun shells and 2k .45. and yeah that's 15 silo runs and 15 SBQ fights alone. Not counting theminor events like free range, uranium fever, or awol that the group loves
---
My action hero specs out @ 185 damage.
---
My suppressor gat plasma is 150 damage.
---
My ta Gatling is 195.
---
And my furious shotgun totp out at 160. When speced to it. Just some info sorry bout the wall of text.
---
Mine is over a cliff. I always make sure no one is at my camp when i log off so i don't accidentally kill someone. When i server hop, hoping to try get the Hunter Long Coat and i make sure to disconnect my vending machines so the camp wouldn't show up. Kinda sucked earlier today as i was exploring Prickett's Fort and two SBs spawned in. Was going to just log out but checked the map and someone was at my camp. Had to hide and endure until they left.
---
That sucks, but keep looking there are other groups out there
---
I feel as though if they did something similar to Diablo 3 and made a seasonal mode that would easily fix a lot of the problems they have, including the duped items that ruined the game. But people don't want to "fArM fOr tHeiR plAnS aGaiN"
---
No crusties allowed.
---
Unless you do events where other people can die, or get lucky and find somebody dying, then there's no other way currently.
---
servers might crash. There's a lot of other random client crashes.
---
You don't have to team up. You can revive someone at the encriptid event. üòä
---
Bazookas only weighed 13 pounds. The Carl Gustav is actually really heavy. Upon deeper inspection, I accuse your analysis to be intentionally misleading because you want your "favorite gun" to get a buff.
---
I was able to do the revive requirement at the imposter sheepsquatch event. There's also water all over the place so you can get the swimming revive one done at the same time if you revive somebody. You can also ask on here for help doing it.
---
Added üòé
---
I'm pretty casual too, I've only recently starting fine tuning and refining my "build" but the game is pretty forgiving. For reference, here's my current shotgun/rifle sneaky setup:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e6648a8&amp;d=lt2lu2l71s72ao0ar2an2ic4c72e00p02pd0pk0pl0sb2su2sp0so0sd0s01eu0eh2e60sa2ip2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=15c8
---
At least on Xbox survival servers, it‚Äôs all Vanguard Sentinel armor + Tesla + Stealthboy + Explosive laser.
---
Everybody and their mother (literally, one guy and his mother has this stuff) has this setup, and it‚Äôs CHEESE.
---
It there were a survival without legendary effects or mutations, it would be the same thing but more annoying. regular Tesla, Stealthboy.
---
&gt; Even a few of the hairstyles look good but maybe aren‚Äôt what I want on my character, but wouldn‚Äôt know unless I bought it.
---
That actually you can preview. Find a safe spot, open up the character editor and go to hairstyles. 
---
About the outfits I agree, I have barely bought any because unlike Camp items you can't preview them. Time ago I was about to buy the hunting cap, but didn't do it because I thought it might wouldn't fit my character. Later they gave it away for free and god, it looked so awful.
---
I consider it a failure they haven't put it in at launch
---
Very informative thank you, thanks for the direction in power patch that makes sense. I was under the impression that serendipity doesn't work in PA. Did that change?
---
Im on xbox yeah, I've got only a few left that aren't 100/100 but if you're interested you can buy them when I'm online in about 10 hours
---
Did expertment..worked fine ran out budget tho..friend tried worked fine, lower your settings also did you have extractors or purifiers going?
---
Eat their pie, gain their power
---
Happened to me on Xbox 3 times today. I can look at the map but can‚Äôt back out of my blank pip boy. Had to shit down the game and restart
---
Can confirm. Sort of.
---
No emote action, just the Icon.
---
But it does work.
---
In my experience, the best stuff is in the harder to reach places. I'm about 10 caps out of Watoga. I get a lot of higher level traffic. It is a little out of the way, but at the same time, I've visited tons of camps just outside of vault 76.
---
Most of those player vendors are low level players trying to sell stim packs for full price or slightly over.
---
It is all relative. Want to make a ton of cash? Sell modded gear at lower levels near the vault.
---
Want more caps? Sell better stuff in harder to reach places, or sell a bunch of healing salves for 2 caps a piece near the church.
---
How do ya fix them I‚Äôve never even looked into this
---
Precise. It has both hip fire accuracy and Durablity. Recoil does not matter on a bolt action weapon.
---
I don't even run this build, but my teammates do, so it pisses me off by association.
---
When somebody leaves the game their CAMP immediatly goes away. You might be seeing a CAMP that no longer exists but for some reason the game hasn't cleared it from the map.
---
It feels like that sometimes.
---
Not really sure. But I do see it pooping up every now and again when I'm low health and in PA
---
Yeah. I can understand that. 
---
Right now I have 110 legendaries for sale. I target the just turned 50 that wants to get a nice starter legendary. Most are 1-2* weapons that are not a shitty assassin's/nocturnal prefix. I try to focus on the prefixes that you can build a character build around. 
---
I have more expensive legendaries but most people don't want to hear that the instigating explosive sniper rifle costs 15k but in reality I don't have the cap space so you better have something in trade. Those I target to people on Reddit subs who do have the excess caps to spend or trades to offer.
---
My first was a Furious Ultracite gatling laser then it all turned to shit.
---
"So your in detention"
---
no problem man no i was assleep im gonna be online tomorrow :D
---
That‚Äôs a Fat L. Sorry.
---
By the third one tonight I was wishing for the old days when camps we're fair game and I had a twoshot Fatman just for the occasion.
---
I forget the name but the stock that boosts recoil control and bash damage. You'll never bash with it, but that stock will raise weapon durability which will be a significant issue once you add all the mods to it.
---
I've read it some where people I've talked have confirmed it. I think it's just the programming as well...
---
You : What do you mean my warranty is invalid. Clearly your suit is malfunctioning.
---
Sales rep: I'm sorry sir but our manual clearly states to wash it in COLD radiation free water. Or what you are experiencing can happen. We are not at fault. So clearly you dun f\*\*\*up and it's all on you.
---
No ima keep it but I mean wouldn't it be obvious to put the dragon under the black powder rifle category for skins I mean its a black powder rifle its just called the dragon cause It shoots 3
---
Yes - maybe.
---
Which vendor bot sells the auto receivers?
---
I don't think most players know that visitors spawn where you first place your camp, so they just build right over it.
---
What was that like?
---
I'm getting the same... Very annoying when you're on a sliver of health and have no way to hide from enemies.
---
Yesterday I cleared the first 3 scorched in watoga civil services, turned on my lamp to look at something and the light in an empty room managed to aggro every scorched in the building. And make them come one by one. Standing up and crouching didn't put me into caution again. And fast travelling didn't clean the status either. Mobs were not getting hit with sneak critical...

So, I looked at my inventory. I sold a bunch of what I had, but I've still got a Two-Shot Combat Level 50 I could part with for like 2000 caps or a Furious Combat Level 50 I could do for 900. Both are 1*. I've also got about 2500 extra shells I could sell at 2 per. Sorry this turned into a advert. Add Jay_31_ if you're interested in anything.
---
Im lovin all the free water.  Getting expensive though fast traveling around.  Haha
---
Raider tents/lean-to
---
I'm on the same boat as you with being near-clueless about coherent builds. I'm lvl 54, and I invested heavily in Strength early on. I've now just realized I unintentionally made a pretty good melee/unarmed build, and my game has become 100 times easier.
---
i have my camp near there too! on the little lake near that. i find the screams so comforting for some reason.

---
Shotgun/Rifle/Sneak
---
My trifecta
---
Here. It‚Äôs a Sneak Auto Rifle build. Crossover builds are not good in this game. Stick to one weapon.
---

---
I put mine way out of the way for those that want to use it.
---
Yeah, that adds longevity to the game
---
/s
---
But did you achieve Ultra Instinct?
---
With the last changes to RoF and DPS - no, definitely not. The gun is gimped beyond belief with the charging BARRELS. The regular ones are pretty ok now. Still a few tiers below ballistic, unfortunately... 
---
I have almost all legendary variations, I know very well...
---
Steel? 200 pieces!? TWO HUNDRED BULK MINIMUM!
---
Cant hear it so what does it matter?
---
My wife is level 154, and mainly a shotgun build. Playing with the perk cards to get the damage you like is the key.
---
Why‚Äôd you get downvoted? I have literally used you before lol
---
Fair enough!
---
Yes, I had fun during launch, then it got old.
---
The new updates are making it fun again :)
---
Incorrect, no need to have steel in your stash at all really, with the scrapper perk and one run of west tek it anywhere else that's mutant heavy you can aquire plenty enough steel for whatever you're planning on crafting. It's by far the most plentiful resource.
---
&gt; Bazookas
---
lol I'll say it again, go look at a Fatman, now look at a Bazooka. Tell me which one is bigger. Same with RPG's.
---
You character sits down to play the steel guitar and the chair breaks.
---
You are now Wanted! (5 caps)
---
Who knows. Had a good LMG for this guy but never got a response
---
If you are already going demo expert for explosive launchers (they all synergize very well with a heavy build) it's kind of a no-brainer for getting an explosive weapon for max damage. 32% more damage in an AoE effect is basically impossible to beat, and it doesn't cost you more ammo like 25% fire rate does. A BE 50cal with reload speed is my dream weapon. Gatling gun is less of a pure DPS weapon, more of an efficient farming weapon, I'd suggest 25% fire rate for it; even with a speedy receiver it's kind of slow, 25% fire rate puts it just about right IMO. I've got an instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun that once I get Adrenaline rolling, I pop 68 supermutants with single body shots, and it's a very accurate gun.
---
Adrenal Reaction, Healing Factor, Marsupial+Bird Bones, for me Herd Mentality (and strange in numbers perk) because I'm always grouped. I'm pushing 300 damage a shot with my 1star bloodied 50cal, without any buffs like adrenaline or chems. It fires just as fast as a gatling plasma, has more controllable recoil, is less of a PITA to reload (don't have to worry about partial cores), and has zero spinup time (which is huge). 
---
I've been running a HW/Explosives build in PA since launch; transitioned to a full Bloodied build (20% health) about 4 months ago. It's incredible, and explosive launchers actually feel worthwhile with it (my 2shot fatman is listed at 3200 damage; 2shot missile launcher is listed at 1100)
---
The only scary things are poison attacks (especially mirelurk queen) and stunlocks (yao guai are nasty at this). But if I spot them first, I can melt anything before it's at all a threat. I've got a primed bloody 50cal for queen fights; if a scorched MLQ shows up, she just pops...
---
I've only played it a few times but I am always at least #4 when I join in at 0 points. It usually picks up a bit after 30mins to an hour by about 3 players.
---
1. It was a joke.
---
2. I obviously craft a lot more ammo than you but your anecdotal idea of how much steel is needed surely applies to everyone /s
---
Launchs a canister with 4 micro-nukes instead of 1 mini-nuke. It‚Äôs bugged as fuck in ‚Äò76 though.
---
&gt;!Parody my dude!&lt;
---
Regardless, my advice is still good advice.
---
Do you have a screen cap of this?  I'm currently in a debate about this drop elsewhere.
---
Because you must play exactly as he does? Never trust anybody that tells you their advice is flawless lmao. Goodbye.
---
I keep 1 bulk of everything minimun all fluxes and screws. Just look at the things you use while crafting and fixing. Store that stuff... Sell weapons and armor you not using....
---
You're a strange one.
---
There is a way by inspecting the item you want to mark.
---
You need to inspect a copper scrap in your inventory to mark copper for search
---
Odd way to say that you‚Äôre ignorant to the many variables and don‚Äôt know how to respond now
---
I literally walked around Flatwoods and one shot all the mobs there for my 50 kills.  No need to enter build mode, scrap, build, exit, shoot over and over again.   Just shoot and reload low level mobs.
---
I really like this build and I'm wondering how you avoid losing/getting mutations after the ones you want without using Starched Genes?
---
Well, thats still way too circuitous. But thank you, thatll help a lot!
---
I‚Äôm a Cowboy, on a steel horse I ride.
---
Why don‚Äôt u try and kill 3 level 60 or 70 scorchbeasts
---
They do, there is a YT video that supports this:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjuTFuiar4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAjuTFuiar4)
---
I milk the ones in... Well im a nub and forgot the name. The fist town you get to. Anyways there is a few running around the church and most of the time i get milk from 2 or 3.
---
Maybe the wild ones are tapped out and need time and a Gatorade?
---
Do a rifle build and use the Riflemen perk cards.  I invest two points into each card.  
---
Grafton steel workshop
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I just paid because someone had 20 armor apparently  and it was all the basic crap you find all over the place.
---
I sell steel a lot at my camp, come visit if you are on Xbox!
---
For me, I do the National Satellite Array and West Tek and take out the super mutants. They mostly seem to carry assault rifles or super sledges. Plus, the caps they tend to drop usually covers the cost of fast traveling.
---
Grafton works too but not nearly as many.
---
You can‚Äôt really fix it; you have to learn where people spawn in at and move your base around accordingly.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f358bb&amp;d=lt2c72pd2pp2an2pk2pl2ar0ib2p02eo2ao0a30l71a04ic4sg2lk2lv2cu0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
thats the build. Junkies plasma rifle with the flamer mod.
---
What platform?
---
Kill all of the super mutants at West-tek and take their weapons. Use the scrapper perk and each assault rifle will give you 20 steel. The laser weapons will provide steel and plastic. Not to mention the pipe weapons and miniguns. Just doing this at West-tek can get you 1000 steel. There is also a bunch of paint cans on the roof of West-tek which provide steel and 5 lead a piece.
---
This is just because I've got brotherhood handle and you just want to nuke everything isn't it?
---
Use scrapper when breaking down weapons, I can easily get 400+ from a single Uranium Fever.
---
Use scrapper perk card and scrap every weapon you come across
---
I think for me the ones in Flatwoods are always already milked, as I haven't been able to milk them in a while.
---
Bought one from a player vending machine. Will scrap and learn, now that I know there is a 100% chance to learn.
---
I want a nuka throne.
---
Like the iron throne but nuka cola bottles
---
It really depends what you're spending your junk on. If you do little or no base building, you can dump almost all the concrete, ceramic, glass and bone for example. If you're not trying to unlock armor mods then you won't need much rubber, but otherwise it's often the limiting factor.
---
Another point is that you can be much more brutal when clearing junk when you know how to collect it at short notice.
---
Yes, buy it now, then come buy my well priced merchandise on the new player ran vending machine at my base , ign garlandtd on PC huaa!
---
You need Cooking Stove plans, I think most responder vendors sell them.
---
okay go to the pipboy, junk, then press rb to see by component or something, then you can press y i think to search for the things you want
---
but it's pretty glitchy for me rn, everyday i have to set it again because some stuff get untagged for some reason
---
Top hat and goggles... I smell a TF2 cameo
---
I've sent you a PM, I'll check it out!
---
Good plan, I'll try that out.
---
Hey, was that on PC? If so, I think I may have been the level 100+...it was a fun little scrum!
---
While I agree with your point somewhat, they are focusing on PvP more then PvE for the next DLC. Nuclear winter is PvP focused...
---
If you can hold off for a few days, I'm hovering around 1500 caps atm
---
It took me till lvl 99 to come across a combat armor helmet. Wich was being sold in a CAMP. Same goes for the marine helmet
---
What bothers me...well is the lack of protection they offer. Does anyone have an explanation for this?
---
I'm on PS4, but thanks for the offer, man.
---
I‚Äôll take whatever all you don‚Äôt want. I sell plans so any you want to get rid of would be appreciated
---
Check what you need to repair guns &amp; armor . Stack up on them . Writem em down or take a pic when you repair. Mark those junks with magnyfying glass ( sry for spelling ) . No need to keep tons of steel or wood . Steel is easy to get with scrapping enemy weapons with scrapper perk
---
Well we can hope thats for sure.
---
Wanna play with my banjo?
---
Yeah, sure, no problem. I'm just carting them around.
---
Yeah I wish it had no mutations, legendaries, and everyone started from scratch.
---
The thing is, chairs can't support power armor, that's why all sitting functions are not an option.
---
I got a quad explosive pipe revolver rifle but that was it for good items from there, got a couple other explosive weapons but the second star was normally trash
---
I had to do this with all of my alts. well except I just deleted them all and didn't liquidate. I was getting hung up in decision loops and bouncing from character to character. instead of playing I spent all my time in character load screens. inventory management got out of hand I had to much stuff to many places. I could never find anything if I did store it. I deleted all of them, all of the gear all of the alts , probably 50 to 100k worth of caps plus actual gear. 
---
F mule characters get rid of all that excess and 76 is much more enjoyable. I keep feeling tempted to make alts but as soon as I start the intial phase one set up and grind I get so annoyed I log out delete and go back to my main. keeps me focused.
---
Think I am completely desensitized.  Heard a scream and went toward the cabins.  Murdered some ghouls...walked into a cabin and saw a picture spin.  Thought...oh neat haunted.  Waited for Jason to appear with machete I could loot but only some ghouls came in.
---
Then followed some wires up a hill to a tower and could not get it to work...saw some bees and wandered off.
---
I miss feeling...more...and getting into it.
---
That‚Äôs famine?
---
I dont. Mainly that PvP turns into a Legendary fight. You have a full set of Assassin and a melee/ whatever is the best range combo? You won! As someone who dislikes melee/ unarmed  combat and uses heavy weapons, I hate bunny hopping or Vat crit spamming foes.
---
Also they are doing a Battle Royal mode so.... less yay
---
Ok cool. What perks should I get to improve the weapon
---
Only parts. Most of downstairs and all the crafting stations, bed and vendor stations are open. I have a locked door to the second floor because that is where my fusion generator and turrets are.  Haven‚Äôt had anything get up there and do damage to that generator yet, 
---
I also lock my extractor because I need what it‚Äôs extraction. Free water and plants though.
---
Until you run into bad radiation and mutate with something you really dont want and potentially wreck your whole build. It's to risky.
---
Sounds fun.!
---
Ive played 500+ hours on this one character. I just feel like if I start again I can focus on all the lore/side stories in it. Its not a mule
---
Find me
---
*you may feel a minor headache afterwards*
---
There are builds that counter builds. Its all about learning what to do. And this whole post is about that fact fallout is meant to be a pvp game.
---
The devs r still working on balancing. But there are ways to fight back. And a lot has to do with working with others.
---
Don‚Äôt delete.  You will regret it....
---
Slightly west of the lumber mill below Vault 76. Hard to describe a pinpoint location but the body is downhill from a tree in some bushes
---
Nope I'm gonna give the game a few months I got a few other games to play. üòä
---
Maybe some actual incentives will come along with it. Survival pisses me off, not a fan of always appearing on the map if you've been alive a while and are actually playing the game. The other day I had a 40K+ streak ruined while doing a Longest Night event by some PoS lv35 who apparently had some AAE full auto to blow me away, immediately die to ghouls and quit the server.... While I don't mind being killed I do not like being able to just track someone down, when the same cannot be done to my would be hunters.
---
My typical pvp experience in survival so far is usually, me getting into the top three just playing with some friends minding our own business, some asshole and a few of his friends ambush us, followed by us killing them repeatedly until they leave.
---
I just find the whole being punished for playing and not dying ever 10 minutes annoying. Otherwise pop doesn't bother me but I do have ridiculously OP weapons so it helps that I can pretty much insta kill anyone I encounter.
---
Oh you poor soul thank you for the laugh
---
Watch for the new meta of chair &amp; instrument griefers.
---
Just gimmee a crappy sheet with eyeholes cut in it outfit to wear, and a bucket that counts as a weapon to have equipped. I will visit everyone. EVERYONE.
---
No man's sky is a good game
---
It sounds like you only play to troll people.  How is FO5 gonna satiate your hunger?  There are plenty of other games to be a villain, why force it on the rest of us?  
---
I do agree there should be a 'hardcore' mode for those that want to play that way, but FO76 was in no way intended to be a battle arena.
---
If you use any weight reduction cards, their effect doesn't apply in the stash box.
---
Any junk that can't be bulked (nuclear material, waste antiseptic, gold scrap etc) I try to keep a minimum of 100 each.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Strength:  Shotgunner x 3, Expert Shotgunner x 3, Master Shotgunner x 3

---
Intelligence: Demo Expert x 5

---
Get yourself a Two Shot, Explosive Combat Shotgun and you are golden.
---
I actually saw that but it didnt work at all for me so I thought it would be something else
---
Poor attention to detail.
---
I understand that, but honestly the legendary effects and mutations, while fun and great for pve, is a pain for PVP.
---
I would love normal sniping duals, or being suppressing by a heavy gunner, or running away in fear from a guy with a deathclaw gantlet.
---
What Pvp now is getting spawn camped at the local station by a guy who set up.turrets there, or hitting a person with a full set of Assassin and have it doing Jack crap, or having fights turn into bunny hops and vat crits.
---
What my point is that it turns into a battle of skill that anyone can win, instead of the current system which is all about your gear, mutations and perks. You can be ass, but if you have this pvp meta gear, you will destroy almost anyone in survival. And it's not fun, at least for me.
---
What type of .50 cal receiver do you have. I believe there are 3 different types.
---
I just had a super mutant spawn in a foundation then as soon as I opened the door, it jumped out at me
---
G-String.
---
Well played
---
At level 2 I had no idea you could fast travel to Vault 76 for free! Kudos to you for being on top of it (and a good sport!)
---
on xbox you can join recent players, don't know about pc tho
---
Im bothered by everyone being so kind and waving and shit.
---
We get it, you ruin other people's fun.
---
Had this happen to me a couple of times as well, and I think it happens when you drop a lot of stuff that spoils, like meat.
---
My current character is a shotgun build, but then it's bloodied. You can do bloodied pistols and it still destroys everything PvE.
---
Back when I didn't have Adrenal + Bloodied, I played shotguns a bit differently. Heavy use of Enforcer to cripple the legs of melee enemies, or to blow the limbs off gutsies until they self-terminated. Once enemies were crippled, I'd finish them off with a pipe revolver rifle (later a lever rifle) to save on shells. Whitesprings was straightforward solo after level 32. Enforcer is just that strong.
---
When you need to kill stuff with them, combat shotguns with a perforating magazine have decent dpm but you need to work around the range/spread issues. Avoid using any mods that reduce the range, and try to keep all your pellets on target (ADS use and Skeet Shooter helps), otherwise the damage output drops sharply. Get the Speed Demon mutation to close the range fast. Take Tenderizer 1 because it seems to proc per pellet.
---
Otherwise just take all the damage perks as usual. VATS perks might be good, but I don't use VATS except against bugs, so I'm not even sure how it works with shotguns.
---
place power armor outside and enter it
---
Actually....I don‚Äôt but u know what they say when folks assume.
---
Here is two articles for you to read that explain how the game was intended.

---
Its creepy sometimes. üò¨
---
I have troubke placekng a 1 square camp down haha
---
I just pulled one yesterday so yes.
---
This is what I wanted when the game first came out.
---
But it never really happened.
---
Survival is a joke mode. Its a mess and punishes folks for actually playing. In my opinion, they should have never separated the modes.
---
I am not being very eloquent it would seem so let's rephrase the whole thing.
---
Deathclaw hides: you can buy them from other players then scrap them yourself.
---
Magazines: You have to find them where they spawn 'in the wild' and pick them up yourself.
---
So there is nothing strange about what happened to you, that is what happens to everyone.
---
If you trade for them/pick them up from a paper bag or container/buy them from a vending machine it does not count.
---
I would almost pay to see someone buy it. Wow
---
Love this skin!
---
Git gud.
---
fox at the bbQ shack ( where one off the FREE Range event spawns), wolfs at salomos pond but you might get ghouls as well.
---
Are you going for a fariming/team build? Cause there's no weapon perks and there's a lot of situational perks in there.
---
It is in game and can make them for anyone that wants one.
---
Gamer tag?
---
I have the same problem of not understanding builds. I play so infrequently (due to that life concept being out of hand) that I can‚Äôt keep a strategy between plays.. I‚Äôve found that you can google ‚Äúfallout 76 builds‚Äù and there are a few sites that will recommend perk setups based on the type of game play you‚Äôre looking for. As for other people, well... what works for them may not work for you.
---
I'm happy to help if you'd the same in return but I'm Australian and it's still working hours here so with time zones by the time I get to my Xbox you'd be asleep
---
Bethesda has nowhere near this amount of fun and creativity to spare for 76. Don't get your hopes up.
---
I run combat, but would also like to know how marine stacks up against it now that I've gotten a bunch of 3 star marines from the vendor.  Scout armor too, they all seem to be viable options.
---
Like the fo4 creation club one?
---
[deleted]
---
Lol this actually made me laugh
---
Why would I need weapon perks?
---
Except an assaultron will beam you up.
---
Not sure if it's safe but I heard it can teleport you to a place whwre you will never wake up
---
Instigating is shit with explosive. If you have multiple enemies in front of you and hit the whole bunch with the splash , well there goes your dmg bonus .
---
&gt;Get yourself a Two Shot, Explosive Combat Shotgun and you are golden.
---
I'll just walk down to the TSE shotgun store and pick one up then.
---
In all seriousness, this is gonna be the hard part.
---
Oh that‚Äôs so cool, I‚Äôve never seen that before! Yes exactly like that, they look so awesome. So are those official Bethesda mods or user created ones?
---
it is, find a low level yao guai and take its health as low as you can but dont kill it with something actually usable and just either bash it or use a bleedout syringe for the last few hitpoints
---
Why can't you PvP on survival servers?
---
How do you get Bleedout syringes?
---
I just want to be able to repair things in the armor. I can scrap stuff at the same bench but can‚Äôt mod or repair?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt even bother me if for whatever reason I lose 100 on my carry weight the moment I exit the damn thing, step back in and it‚Äôs still gone. I have to exit to main menu and start again to get it back.
---
Bring it health down low with any other weapon and when it's almost dead, finish it off by bashing with the syringer. At least that's what I did
---
yea up the hill to the south there‚Äôs a tree house with the controls for the camp, it was a pre war prank haha
---
It boggles my mind why they implemented such a feature in survival mode at all. I'd go a step further and disable the map entirely, to be honest.
---
Nice. Looks fun!
---
Darn, I killed the only humans then.
---
And why cant you if u dont want to pvp...not active it. üôà
---
I love the question btw. This post has nothing to do with not playing survival.
---
For increased weapon damage? ü§î
---
Build a few and scrap them. You‚Äôll get the plans. Kill the beast south of WS (near the snake icon on the map). There‚Äôs one sleeping in a little cave, pretty low level.
---
Scrapping syringers unlocks new syringes to mod the syringer with. Keep scrapping syringers until you get the bleedout mod.
---
imagine how much you could sell it for on the market if it was real, people went crazy over the snallygaster spit attacks back when it was still relevant and a legendary can sounds even more interesting
---
Need any help at any point in time, I'm also on ps4. Pm me and I'll most likely see it.
---
I‚Äôm almost level 80 and I still struggle with scorch beasts every once in a while
---
That's definitely worse than an arrow to the knee.  üòé
---
Oh, I didn't think I'd need them.  Which ones are situational?
---
Clothing should def have it's own cat.  I did get 2 tattered mole heads for 5 caps apiece today, so not a total waste shopping for scout armor.
---
I‚Äôm the complete opposite. I don‚Äôt buy anything irl unless I really want it, and somehow can‚Äôt shake that mindset in the game. To be fair... there‚Äôs only been one thing I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve actually wanted - a mod for my most used weapon. Everything else I figure I will either find eventually or simply don‚Äôt need. 
---
If I ever hit 25k caps, I‚Äôll would go plan/recipe hunting though..
---
People still do challenges? I stopped doing that shit when wild Appalachia was released.
---
Theres some shotgun and rifle perks in strength and perception. Get an explosive one and demolition expert is under intelligence. That's a build right there, that guy was just stupid.
---
Totally! 
---
It‚Äôs like a generator, so annoying!
---
It is crazy that I can be 350+ damage per shot as an commando build.
---
Run up to it and choke it with the barrel.
---
Unfortunately plan sells seem to be slowing down now that everyones selling  and buy at vendors. I can't move plans for a tenth of what they're valued at lately.
---
The reward is the legendary (or chance at one) sheepsquatch
---
Yeah, but still a nice thought.
---
[My measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=178063315) indicate there is a total 5% chance you get a 3\* drop. Also it seems the chance to find a 3\* legendary and the 3\* legendary dropping a 3\* is reciprocal so that at the end, you get 5% 3\* drops. For example, I encounter 3\* legendary enemies 20% of the time and they drop 3\* item 25% of the time; 25% \* 20% = 5%. If you encounter 3\* more often, they will drop 3\* less often.
---
Bruh it‚Äôs all about the radscorpion venom mod. Good luck gathering 10 radscorpion stingers.
---
the drinking ones were _terrrrrrible_ if you refer to those :P They're still kind of a pain since almost everyday you need to "take a camera picture of someone who wears this exact outfit in this exact place while they're in combat" or something, so those I usually just disregard :P But the soloable ones are almost fun sometimes :P
---
same dude, it really sucks and there's no reason for that. If they're 3* their odds of dropping a 3* legendary needs to be much higher than it currently is.
---
English please.
---
You have to check where players will spawn in, and adjust your camp accordingly. floating camp designs are actually good for this
---
I would get rid of Scrounger and get Bloody Mess. A universal 15% damage boost works great in any build.
---
Your reply doesn't make sense.  
---
You seem to be complaining about PvE players playing PvE on PvE servers.
---
There was a comprehensive post that said heavy robot armor was the best in the game. Can‚Äôt find the link.
---
Never had that problem. I just have the frozen power armor one.
---
Obviously you don‚Äôt farm pure flux.
---
Serums are dirt cheap just keep removing mutations until the one you don't want is gone.  
---
Then replace the ones you lost in the process.  
---
Not risky unless you don't have the caps.
---
Like a class paint job.
---
All rifles,  or all handguns.
---
I feel like this game almost has a really fun loop. I just wish, like you said I could roll more legendaries a day, and that there were other places besides Whitesprings to farm trash legendaries.

This game is not a Pvp Survival Game. Rust is. It is also not a only a Pve Trading Game. It's a storydriven Roleplaying Game with Classic Roleplay Mechanics with Multiple amounts of Players, which makes this game to a MMORPG. In most MMos Pvp is simply optional so it can fit in many types of players. Fallout 76 is made f√ºr Casuals and that means everything needs to be easy and filled with cotton and this will probably never change. You can say whatever you want, but F76 never was intended to fight other players, your fellow vault dwellers as a main feature of this game, but people demanded it and abused it anyway just because they could. Now People are simply got seperated what you would call a split into two or more communities that like the game the same way but hate other people for their vision of the game. You obviously hate people that are complaining everything, when you grief them and they hate you for the grief. This is nothing new in the Games scene \^\^ and all devs of this world could sing a song about it and how they found a way to fix it. Bethesda never really made such a game which means they need to learn everything from different sources, give em some time and everything is going to be ok. However don't expect that people are suddenly much nicer to you because you shot em into their face and stole all their stuff. Noone is going to love you for your grief, not even griefers that grief you. If you can't handle other people don't play MMORPGS.

i sell plenty of shotgun shells for 1 cap a shell, as for your build just pick shotgun related perks
---
Fo76 wasn‚Äôt built to accommodate pvp players. It was supposed to accommodate both but that is an impossible thing to ask for. SFTU
---
It does and the fact you don‚Äôt understand it, is exactly the problem.
---
There are no PVE servers!!! Adventure is still a pvp server.
---
PVP has to be activated.
---
1. By having pacifism off and returning fire
---
2. Claiming a workshop
---
Virtibot mobile base!! (Well.  Supply drop / fast travel
---
Both. User created and bethesda created. Had to buy credits like atomic points. Had stuff like ai power armor companions, player homes, zetan weapons from fo3, etc
---
Collect Guns &amp; Bullets 5 and visit Wes tek. Hop a few times then scrap at the tinkers or chemist workbench inside.
---
Impossible is only impossible till it gets done.
---
Are the arcade cabinets user or Bethesda?
---
I stopped reading after this is not a pvp survival game. üôà
---
Go to the junk tab press rb (or component view)  click which components you need highlighting.
---
It's probably similar to how explosive shotguns worked before the last patch. Out of interest, what does the pip-boy claim the damage is per shot?
---
Why would I want to farm that?
---
I just used a bleedout barrel and 150 rounds but everyone else‚Äôs suggestion is far better than mine
---
I suffered a scorchbeast attack on the Mount Blair workshop. I had naught but a cruddy 10mm, a shotgun, and a mole miner gauntlet.
---
I spent some time building stuff underneath the machine and then I decided *Nah* and ran away from that hoopla.
---
Pretty sure it was a mod author they hired. Thats how it worked. We had stuff from fading signal, elianora, etc. As well as bethesda
---
They do.
---

WHAT??? I CAN'T HEAR YOU! *while scrapping my nocturnal ghulslayer +1 CHR gamma gun*
---
Thanks
---
No map would be kinda more realistic. Folks what have to watch every corner and play safe.
---
I agree! I hate fast traveling to someone's camp with 70 hats and red dresses.
---
I'm stepping down from my throne. You're the real master. Snow question about it.
---
Stash management is easy. I am surprised there‚Äôs even a guide on it. Just goes to show most people are natural hoarders. Only stock up on items you need to repair your base and weapons. Drop everything else. Or transfer it to an alternate character. 
---
I ROFL when ppl complain about stash management. At least it isn‚Äôt 400 like it used to be. LMAO
---
Easy.
---
Lol nukashined
---
Sure was, and thanks again!
---
Nothing but the reward of a sheepsquatsh date and some fresh Brahmin milk straight from the source
---
Alex, I take "Duper's wet dream" for 500.
---
I thought that way too...until the Horde of Radscorpion event showed up in the Toxic Valley. Got them all in one go. It is kinda rare, but server hopping a few times got me there.
---
This is how I got my Tadpole Badge...with a bleed out. Now if they'd only debug the chemist one..
---
No problem. If you have fo4 I'd look into it. Theres constant sales and some marked down to free for a while at some points. Creation club is also for skyrim too
---
Bitch please. There are. Million ways to re-rad yourself. Shhhh
---
Bye bye always drm
---
Only problem is conflicts with mods, and sometimes breaks the game a bit, but thats a design problem.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can buy or trade backpacks/backpack mods yet, only the plans. From what I‚Äôve heard from others, you may still have to run through the challenge in order to craft the backpack, even if you learn the plans. GL.
---
Just nut up and crawl out of your anti-social cave for 5 minutes
---
&gt; It‚Äôs become quite taxing on my stash 
---
A full set of power armor only weighs 10 pounds. There are single guns that weigh more than that. Out of an 800 pound stash, are you sure you can‚Äôt sacrifice 30 pounds for three suits?
---
&gt; I have to pull them out one by one until I find the one I need 
---
Not necessarily, you can just rename them so you know which one to pull out
---
Can't wait till Spooktober!
---
"all can't sell to vendor btw 1-20 cps"
---
Come on dude, don't Anthem this. Who knows if Fallout 5 isn't going to have some multiple player pvp aspect to the game.
---
Oh, I'm cool with that, it's a business, and it needs to make money, and Time-Limited offers help motivate people to drop cash.
---
 It's more that daily and weekly challenges just don't feel worth the effort anymore, with the effort needed for a paltry amount, and lately there's been a raft of "Limited Time Items," that feels a lot like pressure selling.
---
An example would be, I don't mind levelling up 3 times a day, it happens.
---
But to get 10 atoms, I need to level up 3 times, possibly on a new alt, or during PVP (not as easy to arrange), while wearing a costume that's not exactly everywhere (Bathrobe or Atom Shop clothing).
---
I get the Carrot and Stick, but the carrots looking moldy.
---
And the owner took care of all the goods in the dropped paper bags to sell?
---
Camp spawns for other players other than yourself will spawn where you FIRST place your c.a.m.p. YOU spawn at the furthest northeast side.
---
They paid a lot of money to get those sound clips from Bioshock, and they‚Äôre going to show them off loudly and proudly
---
oh i see, thank you for the info
---
That's kind of what I was hoping they would do. Ramp up the survival elements(Like Fallout 4 or New Vegas' survival mode), remove the map and make player interactions much more important. You wouldn't know if they'd be friendly or hostile because every moment would be vital.  
---
And if you don't want that kind of play style, Adventure Mode works all the same as it did previously.
---
the doors will actually open and close by themselves there as well.
---
[Sadly, if you look in a nearby treehouse on a terminal, it's not paranormal. it's all hooked up to a terminal and you can disable or enable certain functions. it was supposed to scare the guests of the cabins i believe.](/spoiler)
---
Why not start a new character AND keep this one for the legendary character reset?
---
It actually is a little bit... too much, from activation to completion.
---
There are like three sound layers all competing for your attention - the 'cheery' carnivale musing and two streams of mechanical noises - and a final sonic boom that must be envious of the 'starting the game in Adventure mode' one - no idea if does that in Survival too, never tried that mode - and trying to prove that he is not the lesser boom.
---
ya definitely like the thought of that.
---
And they say this game is empty and boring. Lol. I love this game in so many cool and random ways.
---
Good luck finding one basically.
---
In my experience robot armor stats never climb as high as marine or combat, unless there‚Äôs some mod I‚Äôm missing
---
Under no conditions should you ever unequip starched genes. You did this to yourself. 
---
Yes the perk system needs presets but you and only you fucked yourself.
---
I know what I'm saving my atoms for now, hope we get many cool Halloween skins.
---
The current endgame is unlocking everything for Radium rifles.
---
This post is a mix of resentment, sarcasm, and irony.
---
You've got a point there. They get more and more specific/ridiculous/annoying. Loved to do almost all to give endgame a sort of a meaning. But in the last weeks i almost skipped the most.
---
10/10
---
Anthem this? Not sure what that means. The reason fallout 76 is a lot less content then other fallout games is because of the multi player.
---
Fallout 5 will be traditional and if for some reason it does have pvp. I will spit my coke and prolly throw my controller.
---
Wether you‚Äôre PvP or pve focused or you just like to build camps and crops or maybe just explore and read lore, one thing we can all agree on is we can‚Äôt wait for Fo5
---
Huh! Did not know they would allow mods to this game. TY!
---
Yeah it was nuts. They had some other stuff for crazy prices, too.
---
Just curious... Are there any clothes that people would actually want to buy?
---
Good Guy Griefer? ;)

'Excuse me Sir or Madam, could I inconvenience you for a minute?

Bleedout syringer mod and try the lower level yao-guai at Philippi Battlefield Cemetery at the parking lot.

Gotta find it its on Reddit
---
Build a fertilizer machine. The Brahmin will spawn. Milk, destroy (or store), rinse and repeat. Works for all camp related challenges.
---
Well being the fo76 is suppose to have servers that never turn off. I will hopefully still be playing fo76.
---
Fallout games are great but the one thing that was missing for me was sharing it with other ppl.
---
"Just like this repellant tastes!"
---
Both of the sentences in your first response to myself are double-negatives.
---
You have this idea of what Fallout 76 should be.  That's nice.  Everyone else considers Adventure mode to mean PvE, and Survival mode to mean PvP.   Good luck informing all the 10,000s of players out there that you are right and they are wrong.
---
What u mean legendary reset
---
More like missing commas... I will edit for u.
---
Drill.
---
If you think the game sucks so bad, go play one of the others. No one is forcing you to play Fallout 76.
---
The spawn point for others (not yourself) is where you FIRST place your camp device.  Moving it doesn‚Äôt change anything. Hunch debunked. I‚Äôll see myself out.
---
Don't create a broken game to begin with. Then I can't dupe stuff.
---
I actually love the game. I hate all the whiners and cryers who think this isnt a pvp game.
---
I agree, I hate PVP but even I don‚Äôt think it makes any sense for Bethesda to bow to the players that want to turn this game into a single player experience. The people wanting offline mode, private servers, and Beth to focus on single player mission like content are missing the entire point of this game. This is an MMO spin off in the fallout franchise and just because we got this instead of FO5 does not mean the devs should backtrack and warp this thing into fo5. This is why the devs are focusing on PVP content like survival mode and the upcoming battle royale/death match/whatever mode that nuclear winter is going to be. This game was not intended to be player as a single player, quest based experience and never will be.
---
Thank you. You totally get it. üòçüòç
---
All of them. Maybe challenge related items like the miners outfit.
---
I love it when people that want to be villains have breakdowns about being villains. Keep up the good work.
---
Your problem isn't with the players or Bethesda listening to them. Your problem is with the balance of the game. You can now activate PVP at a workshop from literally anywhere - no more workbench boops. And then what happens?
---
The 37 dumb turrets that you can't upgrade that the workshop owner placed do nothing useful. An attacker can be in only a field of turrets and not flinch. You're one shot or one melee swing from ending the doofus owner who is running around over encumbered in Excavator armor with a Hunting Rifle only useful in PVE.
---
This is not the work of a villain. This is the work of someone who failed at Fortnite not bothering to see the Risk vs Reward being so heavily lopsided compounded with derpy mechanics giving them a handicap so large that they can't fail deciding this is more their skill level.
---
Darwinism, I tell you, never fails.
---
Not quite.
---
After 50 you can pick a perk, or MOVE a special point from one stat to another.
---
Funny cause I am not a villain. üòÇüòÇ
---
choose a style of weapon you enjoy, and build around it. if melee. max out strength.
---
Yeah I just get random atom credits while playing, unintentionally completing challenges along the way.
---
I just imagine the dog catcher stumbling across daisy in downtown Charleston and saying, ‚Äúfuck this, that pet can stay lost‚Äù
---
If you add together the DR, ER and RR, and then ignore leather because no-one wants that much ER, then heavy robot limbs are indeed the best. The torso sucks though, and most people don't want that much RR either.
---
Some combination of heavy leather, heavy metal and heavy robot would be close to ideal. Heavy combat limbs + marine torso or vice versa also works well and is easier to find. Trapper is a good substitute for marine.
---
I‚Äôbe been experimenting with a 0c prices. I‚Äôve set up a machine that gives all items price free, but you can buy Black Titanium priced 10c, 100c, 500c as a form of the honor / donation system. I got rid of all my duplicate plans - and although some people took 4 same plans, I‚Äôve earned a couple of caps for stuff it would be hard to sell otherwise.
---
You don‚Äôt seem to care a whole lot for it. Your original post has you complaining about both modes. Your post history is either selling things or complaining. 
---
If the game was intended to be PVP, why have anything like Pacifist mode to begin with?
---
At 50 you do not add any more special points. You can trade out from one special slot to another OR pick a perk card.
---
Oh, helper of the wasteland, then? You should make a note in your post about the place that you force the dichotomy.
---
Or did I miss it and you're agreeing with me that you're a failed Fortniter unaware of the mechanics? I can't tell ...
---
Your dreams make it real...
---
 *extremly* well tuned
---
So basically 5 out of 100 3* enemies will actually drop a 3* item? 
---
My mule full of 3*‚Äôs is a testament of how many enemies I have killed.
---
It‚Äôs their servers, I game over 15 years, played alot of online games.
---
Other games has patches and server maintenance too, but FO76 has quite alot of those. 
---
Metaphor: a moderate steak will never be a perfect steak, no matter how good the cook is. 
---
They can‚Äôt fix a broken game, they can only patch up. But, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gamebreaking tho.
---
Are you sure never get anything of Bethesda? The Elder Scrolls 6 runs on an Unreal Engine as single player game.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one wanting to do something with this bug. Thanks for the silver, hope this helps visibility.
---
How about just adding a folder that becomes a radio station called by the name of the folder, and play the mp3 files in it, at random. Make multiple folders available...
---
Wait isn't marine wore then sturdy combat armor let alone heavy?
---
I tried all the ones I could find at the train station bot. I don't remember the names off the top of my head, but the highest damage of the ones I found increased it to 149.
---
On the game map is the concept of legendary characters.   It is only available for characters 50 and higher.  You reset your character and get some sort of legendary benefits for doing so.   They haven‚Äôt said what ‚Äúreset‚Äù means‚Äînew game?  Keep your learned plans?  But I can see clear benefits to keeping your main for the reset even if you start anew using one of your other four additional slots.
---
I didn't know bloody mess was still useful.  Thanks!
---
The pack and disciple clothing please. Like the masks/head coverings. Oh and the Hunter hood.
---
So let's say I want some cards for charisma for some reason to move one point to it will require one level up and if i miss up I'm screwed
---
Because folks dont actually have to pvp if they dont choose to.
---
It is a choice. 
---
Reverse your statement.
---
If the game was intended to be PVE...why have attacking other players as an option. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I server hopped at Middle Mountain Cabins for a couple hours.
---
Obviously you haven‚Äôt reached the endgame yet.
---
lol nukashine does wonders for your soul
---
I‚Äôm free to play on Wednesday/Thursday onwards.
---
I‚Äôm low leveled so I‚Äôd really appreciate any sort of help!
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
And you get a debuff for playing it like that instead of a buff.
---
Ammo and serums are the main sink. Armor crafting doesn't need that much
---
Something that has been needed for fucking ever tbh
---
I am actually somewhere in the middle.
---
I have never griefed a single player in this game nor am I the cutesy cuddly kind.
---
But I believe this game should have risks. And by taking a workshop, folks are agreeing to enter pvp.
---
Fairly easy, barely an inconvenience.
---
Go to a Super Mutant stronghold, eliminate the denizens for that imperialist sense of pride an accomplishment: 'I am doing my part!... taking out the trash' then check what prized possessions they store in their meat bags.
---
You will end up with enough radscorpion stingers to make yourself a full set of tribal-themed jewellery.
---
Plus stuff you need for 'Stings and Things'.
---
And the pride and accomplishment, never forget the pride and accomplishment.
---
Or... use the Bleedout Syringe which is only 25% less potent and uses just common crafting materials that do not autoscrap if you have an 'ooopsie daisy' moment.
---
I had a similar experience till I explored the area and followed the voice
---
So if you can choose not to engage in PVP, it‚Äôs not a PVP game.
---
I try selling first, see if its in demand, if it hasn't sold after a few hour of playtime, I just take it out to scrip it
---
I'm excited but given my current weapons and ammo situation I am in no way ready a big boss but I can't wait to hear the stories
---
&gt; Anthem this? Not sure what that means.  
---
During the dark early days of Fallout 76, there were a lot of people laughing at and making fun of Fallout fans and saying "can't wait for Anthem to come out so I can play a real game". Ended up that Anthem is in a worse state than Fallout 76 is.
---
Basically don't count your chickens before they hatch. Otherwise you might have some sticky stains to clean up and a broken controller.
---
üôà I give up on this one. Enjoy fo5 when it comes up.
---
It is a roleplaying pvp survival game. The key to role playing are choices.
---
Using those IS pretty fun. I jumped off the bridge with these (so no power armor) and took 0 damage.
---
Risk is my point: there never was any for attackers.
---
Back when workshops were highly contested I used to PVP for the Munitions Depot every time I landed on a server. Do you know what my risk was?
---
Nothing.
---
Now it's even easier with just as little risk. Do you know what the investment was in building up a workshop? Quite a lot of time and materials.
---
The risk and reward isn't there. It's boring entertainment for people bad at Fortnite and nothing more.
---
That‚Äôs true, glad they make TES6 on Unreal Engine as a single player game.
---
Good luck with BLOPS/Battlefied.
---
There is one thing I will totally bitch about though and that‚Äôs unique loot being taken. For example when they released that liquor making mission where you have to go in the frat house, they placed a cool little VTU jacket on one of the tables but that frat house was swarming with players everytime I tried to go in there for the first week and it was always taken. No matter how many times I server hopped there was always someone molesting the place. So basically when I play these new missions I like to explore the new areas and lookout for cool new loot like that and I always have this sinking feeling that the reason the new location is empty is because someone‚Äôs already been there and taken all the cool new stuff. It‚Äôs almost like you have to wait days after new content drops just to explore a new area without it being completely stripped to the bone of cool stuff. That is my one gripe.
---
If vendors and fermenters are any indication, a power armor dock would still draw from stash space.
---
I dont $ee why
---
I already have candy to pass out.
---
I only just recently found him after searching this whole time. Wavy Willard's water Park, go forward till you see the car and if you don't see him leave the world and join another. Unfortunately boring to keep quitting and joining but it's the place I personally found the easiest.
---
If you just want perk cards then you just buy perk cards. If you want to rearrange your SPECIALs then you pay per point. Two separate operations.
---
It's generally fine unless you want to switch to or from a strength build, in which case it can be quicker to start another character.
---
But why should you have to?
---
sent a friend request
---
If you are a bloodied or strong perception build it doesn‚Äôt matter. I go for the lightest version.
---
That would be super unlikely. It was specifically made for maxson. But i see your point. I just want Bethesda to release a trench knife skin for the combat knife honestly. Or the fixer paint scheme for a combat rifle.
---
Si
---
Thats because we lack repeatable content. I hate to say I hope but I am really hoping instanced vault raids will fill this hole.
---
Right now everyone races to do the new stuff because we lack options on other things to do.
---
Get a life! üòÇ
---
913  with just two of the maxed out cards
---
1043 with all 3.
---
Have fun outside the wasteland!
---
Let us know if you find any survivors out there.
---
Yup
---
Taking workshops is actually free until the green wears off. And if folks want to spend and build a fortress why shouldn‚Äôt they be prepared to protect it. 
---
It isn‚Äôt exactly easy to take a workshop from a four man team thats working together to keep it.
---
Nice video, pretty cool.
---
I would love to see that. I have a mod in Fallout 76 that makes the bomber coat into elder mason's suit.
---
Whew that's a lot. I heard there's a possum badge where you can only use the syringer so this is good to know.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be I survival mode for the challenge this week. It‚Äôs been bugged three weeks in a row. Just team up with rando‚Äôs claim kill and reap.
---
I will be playing fo76 thank u very much üòå
---
Lol...oh you ;-)
---
I‚Äôm game! Did this with another player and realized that the monster mash event is the most effective way to do it. Won‚Äôt be online until later tonight though. PSN: retrnsnxchngs
---
Lmao. If I knew what gold was or cared enough to figure it out I'd give you some.
---
This is a long-term project. Im pretty sure they have lots of new enemy types etc. planned for us...
---
My lady hasnt seen the first 2 yet........ cant go till she does :(
---
Mine is in the front of my Bar you don't like it you the back entrance like the dam peasant you are bloodied build.
---
I didn't find opening date for vault 51, maybe it will be few months. If you grind leader of pack and uranium fever events for while, you will manage to get egouth scrip from legendaries, to buy yourself full gear.
---
For ammo i suggest you to get atleast hands from excavator PA (so you get more ore from lead nodes) and then run tru lucky hole mine. When you get to point, where you know position of all ores, you can get over 1k lead daily there. Then you need tones of acid, which drops from bloodbugs which are at event: camfire tales. Cloth is everywhere and steel is best from uranium fever, loot there everything and after finishing scrap it in room next to where u fight moleminers.
---
On other hand i did read that vaults will be hardcore 15minutes per room "raids" for **group** of people. So i am not sure, if i will be able to look inside even with god tier gear.
---
and you're complaining why?
---
thats pretty much its max damage without popping Psycho drugs. It's AA and Explosive, its enough
---
Np bro I think it‚Äôs probably related to their dupe-ban operation back in Feb, ever since then the game has had a hard time identifying legendary items correctly.
---
I understand why the mouth harp wouldn't work and since you cant sit in power armor so that gets rid of pretty much all the others but why not the stand up bass and it be really out of tune. Or add power armor specific instruments that just use your hands and can be done standing like cymbals, maracas or the triangle. That would make the Sons of Dane event so much easier to do. I'm to squishy outside my power armor to do that event much.
---
I remember this from the pre-release Greenbriar event. I got very high level before I realized I hadn't come across this area. So I sought it out and experienced some of the same things you did. Good luck, stay sane!
---
Yes I find it as waste of ammo.  Unless I need some delicious scorchbeast vittles...
---
Sweetwater's Special Blend, too.
---
It's easy.
---
The first to get a shot off wins and when Bird Bones was glitched it was child's play. Assassin, Sentinel, and Empathy were busted for a very long time.
---
The defender _cannot_ build a fortress. The best you can do is set some garbage around that costs materials and barely kills PVE mobs much less players. The attacker should be at the disadvantage but never is. Turrets are pointless. If you have an attacking friend the bounty is pointless. The PVP no-cap penalty is pointless because of the mechanics.
---
There is no risk to the attacker. If you're getting stomped as the attacker you are terrible and if the no-cap penalty breaks your build you have homework to do.
---
And what a shame that is.
---
most cant do this without moving there base, people always spawn directly in the center of my camp under the floor. I can't move anything as its the only way to build my camp.
---
Once you hit 50, you should have the majority of the points assigned to the stats you want. If you‚Äôve messed up along the journey, the option to move a point allows you to adjust for it. 
---
Levelling after 50 is still fairly quick (I was levelling at least once to twice a day) but has slowed down a lot towards 100.
---
Just added you
---
Very fun weapon. Mine us the same but Vampires.
---
They should let us use the stand up bass than
---
Learn about the game you r playing before making assumptions about me next time. üòâ
---
If you can fire and reload complicated firearms you should have the dexterity available to play instruments with no issues.
---
Not everyone is on pc unfortunately
---
Apparently it is bugged. We used to be able to MAKE it, provided you scrapped enough combat gear. Bethesda removed the plan, ability to craft, and as it seems, the mods from vendors. Best bet is to hop the second grafting vendor (not the train vendor)
---
i've taken the liberty to swap around your idea of a build into something where you would not be struggling as often
---
it is a pistol/unarmed build since your given example had pistol perks and you said before you where an unarmed build. it focuses more on pistol as unarmed melee as a secondary. i was unsure if you wanted auto or non auto pistols. but here it is.

Sometime when you get a new legendary, a random legendary will show up onscreen. Other times it is just a long delay. This can happen when you open the map or pip-boy too soon after looting a new legendary.
---
Had this happen for one of the power plants. I‚Äôd gone through the whole ‚ÄúPowering up‚Äù event, and then claimed the workshop. And when the ‚ÄúDefend‚Äù event started 4 scorchbeasts and a hoard of 68 scorched show up. Just decided to log off for the day.

In on PS4 and can craft serums. I message me your psn and I'll add you.
---
Is there an easy way to make the scorchbeast land? I'm a melee only build but I have a tse gatling gun I carry around with me for scorchbeasts but I'm wondering if I don't shoot at it will it land quicker?
---
But folks can cry about pvping when they literally click the button to claim the workshop. Agreeing to enter pvp. And now folks dont even have to go back to defend it if they choose not to come back in the circle.
---
There r so many easier ways to get rss. No one forces folks to claim workshops.
---
Cheers on the cake. I saw that for me yesterday. (5/19 for timezone reference)
---
My first 3 star sold for 5k.
---
Yup these are all really good suggestions. I think ultimately as long as you can comfortably take down normal enemies you should be fine. Builds are nice to develop though. :)
---
More corpses and radioactive barrels for ya bloody builds
---
Yeah I would like this. But if you want to experience this now then live in the mire. It gets super dark there.
---
FWIW, assaultron head only supports 2 star as well. Same concept applies about it losing something. 
---
In my experience the wooden stayed at 3*. Only goes back to 1* if logout. (Ps4 for reference)
---
I don't plan on killing anything in this game though, but thank you.  Do the weapon cards reduce carry weight?
---
I would strongly recommend starched genes 2 and class freak 3. With all the mutations you have chosen your special stats are being knackered. Strength of 1, Perception of 2 and an Endurance of 3 is pretty brutal.
---
Lead Belly and Iron Stomach aren‚Äôt really that useful. You would be better if choosing perks that give bonus health, or stat buffs.
---
Hard Bargain is alright but shouldn‚Äôt always be on. Given the heavy team orientation of your build, Team Medic or Bodyguards would be a much better choice.
---
Class freak is a must for any team orientated, heavily mutated build.
---
Happy camper is pretty situational, and isn‚Äôt all that great unless your squatting on a workshop for an extended period of time or you are doing some major renovations to your camp.
---
You might want to move points form Charisma to Agility or luck. I‚Äôm assuming you intend to play a pistol wielding character. If so pistol damage boosting perks and VATS perks are your friend. VATS Crit builds are surprisingly powerful especially if you can get a powerful anti-armour pistol.
---
You should also get the following mutations:
---
Marsupial (+20 carry weight and jump heights.)
---
Eagle Eyes (4 perception and +25% crit dmg)
---
Healing Factor (300% health regen out of combat)
---
Speed Demon (faster reload and movement speed)
---
Class freak 3 can reduce the negative effects by 75% while Strange in Numbers makes your mutations positive effects 25% stronger.
---
I think you missed the point of my post.
---
I cant wait for the pve whiners to leave to the green pasture. I plan on staying on fo76.
---
At this point it may be easier to start a New char.   However if you don‚Äôt want to do that then save perk points. I always have 50 to spare just in case. (Lvl 340)
---
With such an attitude, please don't bother coming to my camp.
---
Adrenal reaction to boost it at low health, wouldn't be much though. Demo expert like the other guy said :-).
---
1. Gamer since 1994 . I have done a lot of pvp in a lot of games but the pvp in 76 is just too dumb and shitty to participate in for me. taking turns one shotting each other is not pvp its just stupid. and yes this was supposed to be fallout 4 with friends so wanting and expecting a fallout 4 remix is partially a miscommunication on bethesda's part. we are supposed to have private servers and solo mode available eventually as well. when that happens derp derp fight monkeys will have a huge shortage of victims to prey on. (pretty low on cannon fodder now tbh.) 
---
2. duping and exploiting created a pay to win environment. current cap to cash ratio is 1.29 $ for 1000 caps. you can go online and buy all the gear from all the farmers and do all the ganking. IF you do not go buy all of that and play with legitimately earned gear chances are you will be unable to compete. and before you go jumping on bethesda. the player base did the duping and exploiting bethesda was just dumb enough to trust in peoples better judgement and left the door open.  I blame the players far more than bethesda. toxic stupid players are the problem not gaming companies. 
---
3. villians are an important part of any environment you are correct. but a villain you cannot possibly win against isn't fun it just sucks. earning caps legitimately in game is sort of hard for a little while. being farmed for them by an unbeatable opponent is not something any reasonable player is going to willingly do. and most players are not going to go pay cash for gear just so they can compete. they're going to play the game with the gear they find or buy in game with the caps they earn playing legit. the guys get to kill me once at a workshop then I server hop. I want to play fallout not be a source of income for a douche canoe who somehow gets enjoyment from one shotting people. I suspect advocates of that sort of pvp are also the ones selling the gear to players. kind of like abusing your customers with one character so they get mad and go buy your stuff from your other character. none of the god roll items are needed to enjoy the game unless you get competitive, most players just don't care about the pvp in this game . we are supposed to be rebuilding america as fellow vault dwellers. gank happy phsycos make 0 sense to any rational person actually invested in the story. and that's whats fallout 76 is . its a friggin story told through environment that is defined by what we do. you want to tell me you and I lived in a vault together for decades and now you're killing me for a few caps instead of helping defend a fellow vault dweller? from a story perspective it makes no sense whatsoever. 
---
4. the workshops are the only other way for me to get fusion cores at a fast enough rate to provide for my laser gat. the map doesnt spawn enough to keep up and the only other choice is killing sentry bots at whitespring. for me I prefer the workshops. defense is pointless against dedicated pvpers so I just server hop when someone contests I make more taking a new one  than I do trying to defend it. 
---
ending counter rant with one thing. I think you and the "pvpers" of this game are just salty that they cant go use their over powered toons against people who play normally anymore. you make more caps ghoul farming with less risk. I think some of you are probably pissed off because you probably payed some real dollars for some of your gear, I think the root cause of your resentment is that you invested alot in assembling over powered weapons and equipment. I do get that you have to level and invest perks to go with, its a lot of time and effort. and you don't get the return on that investment now. I feel bad for you but I also don't. you're trying to play fortnight in a fallout world. and no NO I am not going to be your damn cannon fodder and income stream. I like power armor - which sucks for pvp - I like laser gat, also sucky for pvp,I like building shops and sort of need them. so by all means show up pay 15 to fast travel pay 30 to contest kill me once - make a profit of 5 caps. I wont get mad I wont get salty I sure as hell wont come back and fight you though. I am not built for pvp, I am built for playing fallout. I have perk cards in my build ...GASP  that ARENT RELATED TO ONESHOTTING EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING I CROSS I use travel agent good with salt, some weight reduc. you know fallout related crap. you shoud try it . you know playing fallout instead of trying to play fortnight in a fallout skin. maybe be a survivor and take on a damn role. I personally repair power companies , its almost pointless because people don't know repairing a power plant provides the area with free power and therefore dont use it. but I enjoy doing it. it is how i contribute to rebuilding america. also I take the shop and get ammo for my laser gat. nothing is more fallouty than laser gat and x01 power armor to me. I cant wait till the derp derp fight monkeys go back to fortnight. morons.
---
And if you read the replies you would have seen I have two of them now and it actually did dupe.
---
Are you new to this game? Like very new? Like very very very new in the last week new? All of these were decent changes since everything else was wonky and broken.
---
An attacker never had risk. The bounty system isn't high enough and allows an attacker to Macarena through all of the traps and turrets unscathed. That has remained static.
---
Well, they did not add anything that was not in FO4. You might wanna ask them to please hire a couple of artists.
---
I‚Äôm camped in the Toxic Valley for that nice ambient glow.
---
there are reduced carry weight cards, yes. but weapon damage cards only boost damage. if you just want to hoard everything then go max STR and only damage resist perks.
---
Excuse me, what?
---
Until the fix the Legendaries inspect feature, why do you even bother selling armor at all?
---
I only had the pistol card because it reduced weights.  I don't actually plan on playing on a team too much.  I'll mostly just sell the random wasteland bits and bobs I find around my camp on the whitesprings golf course.  I have team cards just incase I build up the courage to play with other people.
---
Broken pro-snap Deluxe cameras have an unsusally high drop rate in tool boxes (the orange square ones)
---
I did Archer, Athlete, Hunter, and Swimmer.
---
Really that will take me a while to read but if you need fusion cores. You can make them.
---
Queen runs all day and u have more then enough flux. And also I would recommend on getting gear so u dont need to be in PA so much.
---
" Fallout 76 was suppose to be a fallout game none like the others with RISK. There is no save and restart. There is no solo, you doing only what u want. Its freaking multi-player. " THAT is a bit of mis messaged crap from bethesda they also sold it as fallout 4 with friends. the hype was a mess of misscommunications BS and outright lies. still not sure all the lies were unintentional.

I have skipped shopping at player vendor simply because they have only one entrance and there's a decontamination shower smack dab in the doorway.
---
Thanks, but I'll shop elsewhere.

---
I bet this will be top of their list.
---
I don't see the appeal in being a big brute.  I don't even know why they let you go past 10 strength to be honest.  All the fun cards are in charisma and intelligence.
---
As this will be my 4th character, I‚Äôll have no problem handing it some gear if needed.
---
Yeah. Nut up.
---
Agreed, co op would fix this for me
---
I guess it requires unique players, not the same 20 times.
---
 I would, but I find the mire creepy lol.
---
When i saw the painting spinning on the wall..hmmm... bug. 
---
Apparently not!!!
---
Watch this post great info https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
each point of strength increases your carry weight, a LOT of weight reduction perks are in strength
---
This one time i was travellling around fissure site prime with my buddy collecting flux after a nuke, and was at the far south bos firebase thing when

SIX scorchbeast attacked us with an army of goons.
---
I burned through so much ammo...

That actually felt like a boss fight

Over 30k in caps spent on junk to unlock them. Over 4.5k screws.
---
In my experience the Handmade really shines in auto mode.
---
You have to be prepared to feed it copious amounts of ammo and repair a fair bit, but is quite satisfying to use.
---
I carry an AAE lever to 'take out the trash' and an auto FE (would rather have an AAE here too but hey, RNG will do what RNG will do and I can't be arsed to barter) Handmade for the 'meatier' foes in my non-bloodied toon.

Just a quick perk swap and off we go.
---
Why is this entirely believable? :'(
---
Oh well. Thanks for for enlightening me.
---
I made a doorbell by pointing a flamethrower trap at an explosive car then attacking a switch! Worked well but only once per login, haha.
---
In BETA - yes. After "launch" - no
---
I dont lock anything. Free water. Some people might be really low and I have always +10. It does not cost me anything to help other people.   
---
All my doors are open. One of the beauties of the wasteland and the only thing on the map that actually changes are camps. I build because I like it and being creative inspires other people. Why not share?
---
Demo Expert only adds about 10 points of damage. Not really worth the 5 points of Intelligence. 
---
I'm currently using this and not sure if I should switch them out because I use grenades.

I stopped using Nighteyes. It simply isn't needed anymore.

Hiding in the bathroom won't help rebuilding America.
---
Come on, it's assaultron head - you were fucked as soon as you made the trade... It sucks you lost legendary but it was crap anyway ...
---
Getting 10% back more, doesn't justify buying ranged weapons. With the 150 scrip limit, the amount you get back doesn't really matter, because at the end of the day I still got more garbage legendaries to sell than there is scrip available. Most importantly, the 3rd star is most useless one. If one looks for something like AAE,AA25,TSE,BE...No one really care what is on 3rd star, so there is no point of paying 50% more and also pumping chances to win what you need from 1:192 to 1:1920 just for some 3rd star, that is garbage anyway.
---
I've gotten around 16 so far.

[](/cehail)Mmmm, wouldn't mind my Overboss armor back. S'pose it isn't impossible that Ol' Colter's "custom" Power armor could have existed before he got his incompetent hands on it, and had it retrofitted to work with the bumper car arena.  
---
Likewise I suppose it isn't *impossible* that a coat very similar to Maxon's could be in the wasteland. [Battle trench coats were pretty big in the pre war army it seems](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/7a/US_Army_General_outfit.png/revision/latest?cb=20111030164141). With the fur lining on Maxon's it could be retrofitted from some form of air force version of the military general battle coats.
---
if you are PVE the perk Adrenaline works wonders, rank 5 gives a 60% damage bonus if you are on a killing spree. (max of 6 kills, each giving +10% damage for 30 seconds, timer resets on kill)
---
The first speaker box is outside near the main sign.  There's ghouls outside and lots of robots, naturally, inside.  Just follow the diamonds each time you activate a speaker box.  It's a pretty easy fun thing to do, and listen to the commentary.  It's pretty amusing.  We encountered a couple of legendary Gutsys inside that dropped 1 star loot.
---
I got a whopping 1 cap from a petrified corpse the other day.
---
Looks like you found new vegas sized power armor.
---
There are definitely a lot of assumptions there.
---
1. I am definitely not a heavy pvper. But I do enjoy it sometimes. I do pvp in both adventure and survival.
---
2. I have played 1441 hours and not once have I paid actually money for my gear. I am a huge trader and spend most my time browsing and trading on reddit.
---
3. The story makes no sense in general. You telling me that I lived in the vault with folks for years and they just left me drunk and passed out? Never to give a shit what happened to me. Maybe I would shoot those ppl for a few caps then.
---
4. I started gaming when I was 7 back in 1987. And I have never played fortnite nor have I ever had the urge to.
---
5. Broken mechs and one shotting are things the devs r working on. 
---
6. I dont kill ppl for caps. I already have way more then I can spend.
---
And dont forgot, you can craft fusion cores. üòâ

---
I am at 900 hours and Level 238 on my main. F the Queen - right in the pooper.  I only go kill her for the repair kits now and only if someone else launches the nuke. 
---
when you read the whole post (if you can) you will see I put in there I wear power armor because I like it. it is "fallouty" I could have god tier weapons and items at this point for regular armor even if I didn't buy it from dupers and exploiters. but I dont like it I am playing fallout not fortnight so my whole character Isn't built around oneshotting other players. pvpers are dumb. they make their whole characters revolve around the gank, it makes the rest of the game suck.76 is pretty good if you actually play it.
---
No, I'm sorry but I like having a sprawling barhouse on the lake with a garden and some generators up the hill.
---
"YOUR camp must adapt to MY playstyle!!"
---
When the amount paid to you exceeds the 15k cap on caps (see what i did there) the entire payment just ups and vanishes into the ether but the person still gets your stuff and pays for it. There was a PSA post about it not that long ago.
---
In all honesty paying 15 k caps is kinda a dick move if you know about that 
---
Also if you avoid listing more than say 10k worth of any one item at a time you can avoid it but if you are selling large amounts of anythings its best practice to keep your caps as empty as you can and put them into valuable items that don't decay get some barter town up in this bi\*\*h
---
I‚Äôll do what I want. You get some help for yourself, sport.

I felt really bad for him too. He really sounded hurt.
---
I love it! I got it yesterday and yes i felt like a spy. I took pictures of camps, players and a firefly amidst some corns and in general i liked the photos a lot. Of cource i didn't buy the plan first. First was the refrigerated mod, then the stash plan and last one was the night vision camera. In my opinion is a cool mod to play with photos.
---
When the stash limit was 400, I kept approx. 50 of each junk component. It worked fine.
---
**Never bulk Acid** because it increases their weight by 30%. Only bulking Aluminum and Lead reduce their weight **by 50%**. Rest of them are 0% change when bulked.
---
Wood and Steel =  \~300
---
Crystal, Fiber Optics, Nuclear Waste and Screws are hard to come by = max. 200
---
Springs and Adhesive for repairs = max. 200
---
The rest can be @50 without need to worry.
---
Since carry weight perk cards don't affect stash: carry respective items on yourself.  
---
Consider using *Traveling Pharmacy* and *Bandolier* at all times. *Bandolier* reduces 5mm ammo, etc., to 0 weight and it also affects grenades/mines. *Batteries Included* reduces Fusion Core weight to 0,3 from 3. Makes a huge difference if you hold 10 or more fusion cores.
---
Component uses:
---
* Acid = chems, explosives, smelting, flamer fuel, etc.
---
* Adhesive =  repairs, weapon mods, explosives, etc.
---
* Aluminum =  PA and weapon mods, etc.
---
* Antiseptic = meds
---
* Asbestos = energy resistance modding and chems
---
* Ballistic Fiber =  high-level mods and armor, repairing armor
---
* Black Titanium = high-level PA crafting and repair
---
* Bones = in small quantities in various crafts
---
* Ceramic = some mods, Generators, Defenses and Power Connecters camp building
---
* Circuits = energy gun mods, certain explosives and chems, Mainframe Core repairs in Silo, Turrets and Defense building
---
* Cloth = light-weight armor crafts and furniture building
---
* Concrete = camp foundations, etc.
---
* Copper = energy ammo crafting, electronics building, energy weap crafting
---
* Cork = light-weight armor and mods
---
* Crystal = energy gun mods and repairs and cryo ammo, etc.
---
* Fertilizer = planting, chems and explosives
---
* Fiber Optics = high-tech mods and energy weapon crafting
---
* Fiberglass = PA crafting, energy weapon mods, explosives, camp building
---
* Stable Flux = Ultracite ammo, fusion core, serums, end-level PA mod crafting
---
* Gears = gun mods and electrical objects, etc.
---
* Glass = lights in camp, energy weapon mods
---
* Gold = high-tech weapons and mods, especially energy weapons
---
* Lead = ammo, rad resistance modding
---
* Leather = leather armor, apparel
---
* Nuclear Waste = explosives, energy weapon crafting
---
* Oil = PA mods, item skin modding, mechanical objects
---
* Plastic and Rubber = commonly used in various crafts, Plastic for bulking
---
* Screws = mechanical objects, weapon crafting

---
* Ultracite = energy weapons, Ultracite ammo, Ultracite PA

A user here on reddit told me about the Big Bend Tunnel at the bottom of the map. I usually start on the West end, kill everything all the way through till you get to the very end that has a few work benches. tons of steel every time (weapons as well as junk items). You may end up overencumbered, but you're not really going anywhere. It's a quick run.
---
you can buy it from the scout's vendor machine using possum badges (5)
---
Yeah they need to find a way to make it anytime lol. So annoying
---
because you're unable of comprehending that you're playing the wrong game.  its not your fault you were born that way, but you really should go to a pvp centric game.
---
Around ~50 GB I'd say.
---
I would love love love to have a little robot pal dispense food and drinks to visitors from my pseudo bar I have :)
---
That would be the entire game finished and in a playable state?
---
R then
---
Yes for sure! I always like pvp when it is dependant on skill and not who has the most op weapon.
---
Well on the bright side. I am going to enjoy claiming all the power plant workshops even more now. üòç
---
Hop on little bunny.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, don't think I've discovered it, is it close to any big places?
---
You can inspect Them just fine if the owner is nearby. I detach the Power when i go out farming, and attach the wire back to it when im afk sitting in my camp
---
Does the client/launcher have a resume/pause download feature as well?
---
Just don't forget to take a picture lol, I did. üò¢
---
Yes please! It's hard to even notice wether its day or nighttime atm :/
---
Nearest places are Lewisburg and Lewisburg Trainstation just west of it. It's in the bottom right of the Ash heap, straight south of Uncanny Caverns.

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5e/Big_Bend_Tunnel_West_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20181110193947

Careful when you come out the other side, as the East end exits out into the Cranberry bog, just south of Fort Defiance.
---
So uh, don‚Äôt walk through it. I‚Äôm not aware of controlling your visitor spawn point. Spawn in a wall or the shower. That‚Äôs the risk we all take until the issue is fixed. 
---
Personally I keep mine on a switch.
---
It does. Also the Day 1 update only happened if you had the BETA installed. I got the game a few days after the full launch and I got no additional downloads, only a single around 45-46 GB download. Most updates on PC are tiny as well, around 100 mb. The largest one till date had been around 15 GB I think, when the first DLC came out.
---
Can‚Äôt help yourself, can u? Must reply must reply. üòÇüòÇ
---
If you log out in Excavator PA then for whatever reason (bug I assume) it will double the innate +100 Excavator bonus to +200 meaning +300 carry weight if you've got shocks on. As soon as you leave the armor or die the bonus goes away, I assume this is what they're talking about but please correct me if I'm wrong :)

If your not playing with a team often the empath and herd mentality aren‚Äôt all that great.
---
Nah, I don't care about buffs tbh
---
Nerf the damage, just make it not weigh more than a HEAVY (emphasis on the word heavy, as in weighs a lot and does a lot of damage) weapon.
---
I have two entrances to my house side by side, one with and one without the shower and both are labelled.
---
1400 hours in. Remember if u dont want to pvp. No one is making you.
---
Tell me any rss u need and I will tell u a better way to get it then taking a workshop.
---
I've been playing since the launch. Never found anything.
---
I‚Äôve tried to end the conversation three times now. It‚Äôs your creepy ass that keeps posting. I‚Äôm worried about the people around you.

I often get no legendary drops from 3*.  This happened to me on imposter sheepsquatch as well so frustrating

Why not make it sound like heavy metal or a similar distortion when you play the guitar. And also it uses fusion core charge.

Oh so there is playing the game ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù. üòÇüòÇ
---
Even something as simple as naming our shops would be great.
---
go for it - you literally cannot impede me with the new mechanics - if I show up on a map and the shops are taken I just server hop because I don't take from others. 
---
if you contest and I am not there I will just server hop away. 
---
if you do manage to gank me I am rich AF, 50 caps will not piss me off. I will smile a bit knowing that somehow youre giggling like a little phsycho thinking OOOH I WIN I WIN
---
If you had that much time in then you'd remember the old rules. It's cute you're playing OG, but it still doesn't solve that the risk on the attacker's part has always been nothing with workshops.
---
Remember that if you want to PVP there's a whole other mode that has nothing to do with workshops. There are also entire games with better balance that make the play field a more rewarding PVP experience - unless you're terrible. If you're terrible then continue to use this one as a crutch, I guess, but remember your choice.
---
Most polite raider ever.
---
Remember workshops r pvp. Hop away now bunny.
---
Yea I am sure it is a feature, not a bug.
---
Fail.
---
I get 1 cap from time to time. I've also found a cue ball and a drinking glass once.
---
Tbh I want Bethesda to make lighting take walls more into account. I try to make a sort of mood-lighted bar with no windows. During the day it's practically like I've made a greenhouse with purple-blue lights.  
---
Really ruins the mood(lighting)
---
Remember, the risk and reward for defending a workshop paired with broken balance leaves no risk for the attacker.
---
Remember, it's your choice to bleat about other players instead of realizing you're crutching an advantage.
---
Bleat away.

yes . and "the right way" is defined by each individual. your definition of the right way (which is what your entire post is about.) is more in line with the goods and services offered better by many games that are not fallout 76.
---
I don't get why these instruments would sound good any way, instruments normally aren't in tune when they haven't been played for years after surviving an atomic war

If bethseda didnt want folks to contest workshops, they wouldnt have added the feature. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I really wish they would fix this. I sell 2 and 3* legendaries and they are so hard to sell if you can‚Äôt show what the other perks are... I‚Äôve had to set up my controller with a rubber band and go AFK at my camp while I‚Äôm not playing in hopes of selling some of these items.
---
SBQ is just a waste. She should drop 10 stims, several plans and ALWAYS 2 3\* legendaries with a change for at 2\* on top - dont have to be god rolls. I accept RNG. Even the flux are useless for most of us. I always sell all my flux to the nearest vendor. I have nothing to use them for and the weight 1 pound!  
---
SBQ wears down armor and weapons. Uses a LOT of ammo and sometimes a lot of stims. I cannot imagine anyone with a Faster fire rate handmade participate in ANY SBQ fight. Way to expensive.
---
hi how much is the lvl 50 machete i can either save up caps quickly or give you a bunch of clothing worth a lot of caps if all sold to  robot vendors
---
Yeah, there be monsters there.  
---
Like wendigo's, mirelurks, or the worst of all...

The one writing rage posts because they don't understand PVP. ;)

Wonder if they pay in atoms

I left my keys in the fridge once... Rode the bus to work. Was late. Frustrated all day and when i got home i pet the doggo and let him out.. Now what the hell happend to my keys? Well ill grab a beer and hang with the dog for bit... Ohhh damn it!
---
Turns out the day before was just has hectic.
---
You know what im saying?
---
Did u even read my post? I am starting to think, you the one being hit in the head.
---
Thank you.
---
Which is a large part of why we stopped using them; since they were used almost as a csw role and there were better platforms for that really quickly.
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Ffs
---
I saw the same thing and to add insult to injury the Sheepsquatch pooped right next to his friends bodies.
---
I don't have a problem with the idea of the workshops being contestable - the current mechanics of pvp just make it stupid though. like literally the dumbest pvp in any game I have ever seen since the 90s. might as well go back to blackhawk down and headshot people cross map with pistol and jump exploit while being invulnerable with crouch prone spamming. the only people having fun at that arent really playing the game. as it is right now. attacker contests uses critical he has banked inflicts 999999999999999999 damage then the  defender dies. .....duumb duuuuuuuuuuumb stooooooooooopid.  how are you a gamer for so long with so many hours capable of even being entertained by that level of stupidity. how the f do you even think of that as fun.
---
Yeah, mine stay marked as done now.
---
Did you? It goes on to say you are filling the crucial role of villain but you later denied that. It then bleats about how workshop owners are deserving of villains or some other inane sheep noises. You then tried to insist there was some valid mechanic there but when faced with the obviously lopsided risk versus reward of workshops you bleated something about rabbits.
---
It's all above. Feel free to review it.
---
A good shotgun build will need Scattershot, Enforcer and Skeet Shooter along withvteh 3 Shotgunner perks. Also use plenty of VATS shots at close quarters. Make sure you are strong enough to tank a few knocks because you'll nees to get up close and personal with enemies; shotguns are useless at range. Finally, since shotgun perks require strength anyway, keep a backup melee weapon just in case  things get too much into your face.
---
Ah cheers can't wait to try it out!
---
Get urself a chameleon piece and try crouching.
---
And I am throughly being entertained by this post arent I. Most definitely put me in a better mood. üòè
---
Oh wow i never noticed. I know the excavator pa gives +200  carry weight (with shocks), but i don't use it much. I only use x-01 for scorchbeast/queen fighting and else im on foot. With the New high capacity backpack and unyielding and stuff i can carry close to 500lbs anyway xD
---
your level of uncomprehension at how stupid the pvp is in this game is uncomprehendable to me especially since you have all this time and gamer experience.
---
I thought it was there so you could clear them out instead of running in to em. Pretty handy on the tight quarters hold this ground quests.
---
Never found a thing tho
---
You can nuke the imposter Sheepsquatch though
---
More fuel for the "Simulation" fire.
---
Good catch though.
---
The sims 6 : fallout. :D
---
Do the overseers questline first and personal matters, once you're around level 25ish you can easily move onto the others. Also a little tip, if the enemies are too high levelled in an area, log out and back In and alot of the time they will spawn around your level.
---
I'm sure the quests in the area you go to are at your level there may me some other higher level people around making em spawn higher. At least that's how I think it works. I was getting insta killed by lv45+ super mutants at the top of the world went back another time and they were all around my then level of 15. Only difference was there was no other players around.
---
Well I dont know much about fortnite. But my daughter plays mind craft and I think it might be more your style.
---
Just walk it off. :P
---
What kind of sick bastard, invests so much time and energy into a game just to launch a nuke into another player's face... LOL
---
I try üòÉ
---
Play dayz and see how it works when they tweek too far the other direction. Nights are pitch black most of the time and in turn most ppl log off and switch servers. Totally diffrent games i know but a good example of when dark ass nights go wrong for servers.
---
You mean that she does that when you two aren‚Äôt having ‚Äòdaddy daughter time‚Äô out in the garage?
---
We have giant Mirelurk Queens, more mini-boss than anything though, unless you're low level.
---
Giant Roaches would be cool though.
---
I did athlete, archer and the codebreaker. Easy enough, but took some time
---
Is this where he always spawn? Haven't seen him yet.

To be exact. I said the ‚Äúrest of us‚Äù.  Didnt say me.

Third strike bunny. Now u a goon.

I used to kick frank in the dick I miss vats aim for melee
---
Being that I am her mother we dont do a lot of daddy time.
---
Seems odd, could it be the icon for scrip? I thought legendary items couldn't be scrapped.
---
So they can track unique players killed, but not duped weapons?
---
Interesting...
---
enclave military wing vendor sell 3 mods for it at each server. If you have 2k spare caps, server hop for hour buy out all mods and you will eventualy be able to mod all your armor parts.
---
English grammar, by example: "The rest of us went left. I went right."
---
That sentence is not correct.
---
Whatever these strikes are they must mean something entirely different to you.
---
Some people are also building closets on top of acid piles so when you port in you‚Äôre stuck in a closet of acid.     People are always so creative lol
---
When he found me, he said that he heard that I missed leaving the vault on time because I was drunk. I should of missed entering it as well
---
I know what you mean, I played conan, and it gets really pitch dark.
---
Obviously not since she told her teacher about it the last time. Maybe the next time that you can‚Äôt help yourself around her someone will be able to keep her safe.
---
A separate icon for legendaries is better.
---
Saw a camp selling ~20 weapons and armour, fast travelled to it and they were all shitty non legendaries.
---
Yea 5 is definitely the minimum for luck . I use starched x2. I Swap out the class freak/bloody mess for super duper when needed never remove starched.
---
Darn grammar police. Next time I make a vent/rant post I will have it proofread.
---
And sorry too many goons out. I am starting to get you confused.
---
It is a random encounter but I have only found him in The Mire, once where OP found him, another time in the random encounter spot on the road a bit south of the church with the creepy organ.
---
I have also found another super mutant random encounter recently that might be new: three Super Mutants arguing about the wisdom of leaving their original 'settlement' and the circumstances that led to their (self-imposed?) exile.
---
I use power armor you know this youre just trolling at this point. stealth mod for power armor sucks, jetpack for the win in everything but pvp. 
---
see thats the crux of the epitome. to make workshop defendable i would literally have to make everything else about fallout suck a little bit.  totaly not worth it. we have left the realm of arguing and discussion and are firmly in troll territory t this point. this conversation is complete welcome to the block list sir o7
---
K now thats wrong and offensive. Not cool to say things like that. End it now or I will have to report u.
---
Oui
---
Or you can jump from camp to camp as many people have Brahmin pins. And milk theirs that howni got mine
---
This isn't grammar policing. This is either you using the language completely opposite to how it is normally used by intelligent people or you are backpedaling from your big man pants in the face of adversity. :\
---
At least get that right.
---
Ding ding u got a winner!!!
---
No wonder u need fusion cores. Jetpack eats them alive. üò¨
---
Is it time to pay up? (repair kits)
---
I remember when I started to play a guy was slapping me all the time. So I entered PvP and killed him so many times I would have got the achievemente right away.
---
I don't have the game anymore but unless things have changed since, i got the achievement (both killing and reviving) with the same buddy.
---
The thought of one saying being insulted by this bot gives me hope
---
It‚Äôs the persons decision to do whatever the f they want. Coming to reddit to complain won‚Äôt change how people build their bases. If someone wants a decon arch by their door then that‚Äôs their choice.

Like I said there are a million ways to re-rad. Don‚Äôt be a bitch.
---
Feeling guilty are you?üë©‚Äçüëß
---
Maybe don‚Äôt pick fights with people?
---
It's money they are giving away by making them easy. Don't expect quests to become all of a sudden easy as they were a while back, it's a sad reality...
---
This post is about pve whiners who cry when workshops are contested. And that I cant wait for them to run to fo5.
---
Laser rifles really should have little to no recoil, I don't understand why Beth hadn't removed it yet.
---
A fallout 4 video showed that the light a laser emits does not have punch, meaning there should be little to no recoil.
---
Plasma rifles on the other hand, does shoot a projectile, so I think having recoil is fine.
---
Yeah but i am a completionist like that.
---
Reported. Not cool dude cool. And this is my thread. Its not picking fights when i wrote it.
---
Thank you for putting the moon emoji in your thread title. I would have been so confused about this post without it.
---
I never understood the logic of recoil on those weapons other than 'because we have to'.
---
The 'ammunition' is a battery, there are no moving parts other than the trigger - which is more switch than trigger - and the unloading/reloading of the cell is fully manual.
---
I guess one should not think too much about these things and go with the flow, otherwise 'that way madness lies'.
---
I don't actually know the science, but wouldn't the plasma ball/bolt/whatever be propelled by magnets/magnetism? Visually, they definitely don't leave the gun at an extreme speed so I can't imagine why it should have the recoil it has.
---
Lasers, technically, would probably have a recoil since they're still moving mass but probably not nearly what they have.
---
Either way, how the handmade has no recoil is still a mystery.
---
If you don't have any mutation you can just pop a radaway and see if that works
---
100% Agreed with OP -   
---
I'm totally biased toward Raiders and Wastelanders and all that grungy goodness, but I'd love some more!
---
This post is about you crying about other people crying because you don't understand the risk mechanics that are in place now and that were previously in place.
---
I'm sure they can't wait until you run crying to an easier to win game.
---
I‚Äôll post one next time I see one. Not the scrip icon either.
---
try to press R to access its inventory, sometimes a couple seconds, it will pop up
---
Sent you a friend request, I'll take literally anything. I'm fairy new to the game

I will have to keep an eye on Berkeley from now on. Like you i love to pop in and help clear the air !
---
Congrats on your assist job, well done.
---
Just carry a gamma gun with reduced weight on it to re rad your self at any point? Shoot it an your feet and you get hit by dads as well.
---
Yes sir. Gonna need to build myself a 30-foot extension to my rocket sledge hammer and I should be golden. Let me know if you see those plans anywhere!
---
Some challenges really test people intelligence.
---
I just shot it with my shotgun a few times and used about 50 rounds to finish it off üòÇ
---
Nah that won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve heard rumors that sniping it‚Äôs wings makes it land...but what melee build  takes perception? Only vats I need is the tanks to store all the bodies I amass.
---
Why? because of mods weight
---
I did yesterday buy a 3* weightless rocket launcher, that weighted less than 2 lbs.
---
When I modded targetting computer, its weight increased to 5. With quad barrel mod, it was 20 something.
---
I prefer annoying sounds blasted through my 5.1 surround system at high volume, for no good reason. Thanks......
---
You don't find the Mothman. The Mothman finds you.
---
I want risk. I want struggle and not pansy ass folks who think they can take workshops and farm. And cry when folks come to take their pvp workshops.
---
The devs keep taking the risks away. The only risk ppl even have is if they claim workshops or fight back. If the devs keep catering to these ppl soon we wont even be able to claim workshops. Fallout 76 was not meant to be a zero risk game.
---
As my last sentence says. If folks dont want pvp, dont claim workshops.
---
Also they are made of wet paper.
---
But 5% of the people might abuse it, it's better to inconvenience 100% of the people to make sure that can't happen.
---
I can't imagine being like this, in beta I accidentally broke someone's door and the guilt still racks me to this day

sry, abit off topic, but is the scout's armor better than heavy combat?

Not sure I follow...

It's not infinite. It's just long. the loading process is probably shared with the queue to enter Cyrodill.

Make sure you get a female one otherwise it'll follow you around forever.

I usually keep 10 bulks of everything and have no problems with the stash. There are items that are tricky tho: gunpowder for example. Aid items. Ore. Make sure to check all tabs, including Misc.

No screen shot yet but I just found another instance of the logo. It‚Äôs the logo that appears on the hover pop up for a workshop on the map. The icon is next to the junk category. So I guess it‚Äôs a junk icon. Still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs listed on weapons stats though.
---
I bought a second account as multiple mule tons for items, trash and caps, then realised I could use one of the slots for a photo model... dragged her around and got her a camera at level 3 with 105mm .. now I actually double up on all the player wearing x at y...
---
At level 2 she helped me get the Survival weekly... she is now level 5 so that I could get 2 naked female toons slapping each other and taking photos... gg Bethesda...
---
That might be what wastelanders dlc is about
---
This!
---
Can‚Äôt provide proof until I‚Äôm off of work but I‚Äôm almost positive I have this craft-able in game. I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
You get rid of junk and then set out to take workshops, walking between them, killing and looting everything. When I get there and take the workshop I build a few turrets and a wepons workbench and start scrapping and repairing. Then at the third one I got interrupted by the attack before building that stash and storing my stuff. It's not like loosing stable flux, but some steel, plastic, wood, copper, and a little lead and it's still a bit of a bother.
---
Yes thanks!
---
Let‚Äôs just say it was an enjoyable mini grind for the better version of syringer.
---
I'm still running with my level 20 light combat armor. only rare material you need to repair the armor is screws.
---
I think I got a mug or a plate from one of them once.

I wouldn't mind having a "Featured" tab of some sort where you pick like three or so Cool Things you have to give people a better idea

Gondor calls for aid!
---
I understand it's not for all and I know several women who won't either due to gaming community being toxic towards them for being women. I think that private servers would also be able to provide a safe environment avoiding that perticular problem. Hard of hearing and other impediments or just preference would be another ballpark completely.
---
Private servers do offer the option for others to set them up as they like. I understand that there's already a mod for chat for PC.
---
I would understand the  'because we have to'  if the damage would be the same or better then ballistic weapons, but its not so there is literally no reason for it.
---
Reminds me of my favorite Fallout video ever

We need as many people as possible to submit a ticket to Bethesda about this, I‚Äôve posted on quite a few Facebook groups asking people to do the same so we can try to get this resolved before the display cases come out, Astoundingly Awesome Tales 4 does not drop in the game so they need to up the drop chance or make it easier for us to find, try get as many people as you can to help guys :)
---
Did the same, I think those 3 are the easiest
---
I've created a Music room with a chandelier atop of my camp (yeah it's a house) big enough to fit a grand piano with a quartet or an audience. Now if they added a decent Tuxedo or Evening Dress and a Music section to the atom store I'd certainly spend atoms on some classical music like;
---
Moonlight Sonata - Beethoven [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU) 
---
Perhaps put an Organ in the game  and some music like;
---
Toccata &amp; Fugue in D-minor - JS Bach [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9rZjlsyYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9rZjlsyYY)
---
I actually like the sound the arcade machines make in FO4.
---
I would like to add in a little bit of diner stuff to compliment it though. The red sofas with the table between them and such.
---
got 6 3\* weapons.  bad to average a best (for my playstyle). the two shot ultracite gatling might get me some caps.
---
There's a treehouse nearby with a terminal that controls the effects.
---
I think we can ignore the visuals on the plasma rifle as they are purely visual.
---
If they were to be realistic, you really couldn't see anything when firing most of the guns, laser weaponry or plasma guns.
---
I see :) good on you!
---
I am more practically minded and I already have a full platter and with The Unstoppables issues and the Deathclaw Hides ;)
---
Pretty much this. The ~~person~~ is literally the worst type. I can‚Äôt wait until her kind goes away entirely.
---
Ordinary build with mid range luck of perhaps 7-8 something. I've got four or five pies from the machine, and some from West-tech. I find they're seldom there anymore though.
---
I'm parked fairly near the 76 vault, and sell basics for lower levels.
---
Not one single legendary in there, but plenty of consumables, ammo, random clothing, low level weapons and armour.
---
im a uk player that still needs this trophy as well if you are still looking for help
---
Id love to play moonlight sonata for someone on this game
---
Yeah fuck that. Even after collecting a few Unstopables, they didn‚Äôt count towards the challenge. PSA deathclaws don‚Äôt drop hide... ever
---
All you had to say was nocturnal
---
Serums aren't worth that much since u can craft them
---
Their is still duping, but no, i don't think what your'e seeing is duping. 
---
Remember people were hoarding for ages in anticipation of player vending.  
---
Not sure on x-01 mods but serums are easy to make. People are always selling flux for 50 caps a piece, can easily buy 20 flux (1k caps total) and turn into 20 serums and sell at 500 a piece making 10k caps and repeat... eventually you can mass produce at cheaper costs by buying materials needed instead of farming them. How's that duping?
---
20 hours i believe
---
20 hours since your first sell.
---
Oh from the last time I used it?
---
Five months later you get a necrotic upvote and thanks for the link.
---
I use them a lot.
---
What do you need help with exactly?
---
Switches? Wiring through Ceilings/Walls?
---
The timer starts when you sell the first item.
---
Great work! 
---
Just adding that it can be done at the Whitespring, that's what I've done both times this challenge had been on. 
---
One of the random enemy groups that spawn and rush the robots at the resort entrances can be a mixed group of mutants that includes a behemoth and hound. Last time I encountered it at the entrance SW of the bunker and this time it happened at the carpark near the service entrance.
---
It's very rare though, I server hopped for hours and at the SW from bunker entrance I saw multiple flatwoods monsters while trying to find the mutant group. 
---
Also if the guard bots/attacking group are glowing purple it means FM is nearby mind controlling them and they will attack you if FM detects you.
---
nice find, I've never encountered that random situation, maybe because I almost always fast travel.
---
This
---
I only used the one that allows me to get wires inside through walls but that was a pain to snap into place. Kept getting the error message saying it was intersecting with a fixed object or something like that.
---
Are you one of the people reporting my shop because I have 5 Scaly Skins and shouting that you're doing it over area chat?
---
Please don't.
---
You can buy all of the recipes from the Enclave if you don't get them in rare drops. They are very cheap to craft. Players sell them for 300-350.
---
Oh that sucks. I have a ton of stuff to turn in
---
No one forgets their first time walking through there at night and hearing those screams
---
Where do I find the plans for these? I‚Äôve checked everywhere.
---
I've figured out the switches, it's the solid wires (don't remember what they're called) that I'm trying to use. I want to have one of those amazing bases that I keep seeing instead of a shack with a generator in the corner üòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt we all ;)
---
Enclave bunker if not mistaken
---
Well, they would be worth 2k since you can get them only at enclave for huge amound of caps, but in first wave of duping, people heavily duped recipes for serums, so thats how it's price went so low. People are selling those recipes for 3k caps. I got 4recipes in over 100 SBQ kills. They cost 17-25k caps at vendor. This is part of economy that was badly affected by dupers.
---
Alright, thanks man.
---
In the shop with the X-01 mods btw
---
So I found vault 51 overseers body
---
The only downside of double barrels is you loose out on that sweet-sweet 40% armor penetration mag.
---
Always get a few rads.
---
I ended up using the doorway glitch to get them into the building
---
I mean sure i got something ridiculously over-priced but it's like an  snallygaster explosion spit attack from my miscellaneous section.
---
I'm not sure if I know that glitch. I'll have to take a look!
---
One strum, all the strings break and the neck snaps in half...
---
Haha
---
You forgot the drinking a glass. That emote is actually in FO4 and NPCs do it all the time when they sit down. Goes well with actually being able to eat and drink while sitting.
---
You place a wall, add the power connector to the wall and then press X (or square on PS) and then replace with a doorway. The connector will be floating and allow you to put a wire into the building.
---
When you have finished, do the same thing and replace back to a wall and it should all work.
---
Yes but it isnt worth the trade off. It will only increase your damage by about 10 to 30 points max. Youre better off with gunsmith.
---
It does and currently that would be uranium fever I'd say, or since we have legendary exchange now leader of the pack isn't bad either. Otherwise there are locations where legendary enemies spawn usually. I know one spot that a legendary mudcrab always spawns at when I go there, but I can't remember quite where it is
---
I always seem to run into a gear and level wall around level 30 ish myself, I backtracked and build stuff in my camp, built stuff with junk just  for the xp. once i got that key weapon / level / perk card the end part always seemed to go smoother. also power armor is really help full for the leveling process even if you dont plan on using it end game. 
---
OOH a trick i learned on my last play through. 
---
green thumb perk - chemist perk - super duper - pick all blue flowers from the vault to supervisor camp then pick all the bloodleaf in the creek at slocum joesall the way down to hillfolk hotdogs - make about 50 to 100 healing salve in one shot - you can healtank scorchbeasts at level 15 and 20 with enough heal salve. its really usefull for busting through that level / gear wall.
---
Hm, I'm going to try that just for fun haha Hopefully it exists on PC too
---
you dont need all the perks for the healing salve push to work its just better for every perk you do have is all.
---
They patched the most recent method. This is just speculation.
---
That is the extra junk it can provide if you use the scrapper perk, if I understand your post.
---
They only count if you 'pick them up from where they spawn'.
---
Trading, buying from vending machines, taking out from containers where another player put it, collecting from paper bags, that doesn't count.
---
Deathclaw hides do not drop from the deathclaws themselves, they drop from gulpers, Super Mutant Behemoths and can be found in footlockers, deathclaw nests (possibly, I cannot trust my memory anymore with this), junk 'nodes' and metal boxes.
---
What are you going to do with them, resell?
---
That would be crazy OP. Even if the plan for a primary effect was 100k the best possible weapon combinations would be everywhere.
---
Idem
---
Why did you triple post?
---
The ones that can pass through walls, look like pipes?
---
You can use the one that looks like a drainpipe (one side has empty "sockets" at top and bottom, the other side has a conduit in the middle), to wire through walls so you can hide your generator.
---
Then you can use the long "Pipe" wires to extend the conduit through the walls, and add a conduit plug to the socket to properly wire your machines up.
---
You can place the conduit in the wall, then remove the wall before wiring it up, and the wall just clips back in place, nice and tidy.
---
good to have this confirmed and with good info as to how to :) Thanks! Had no idea the flatwoods monster would mind control them though, that's a neat detail :P
---
4 actually. Must have been one hell of a burn to leave him so shocked.
---
Well there was YouTube vid about new duping system so yes. But also people like me sell cheap. I just sold two 3star legendary guns for 500, 10 two star legendaries for 200 and don't even remember how many one star legendariea for 50... Then I visited other players camps to see they sell 3 star legendaries for 10.000
---
I'm level 106,and rifle build. combat shotgun never comes out my load out.
---
only 3 cards for 30%,hardened and peircing, so thats 1470 in less than 10 sec.
---
great for close quarters , shitish at long or medium range..... s.b. lands, its gone.
---
rare for my to get low on shells, scorched and other drop enough, depends WHEN you use it, as with all weapons.
---
take a close look at other players builds, you'll find the will be great in some areas,but useless in others. tailor yours to suit the way YOU play,not the other way round.
---
if your l68, cant be doing that bad.
---
sound a bit o.t.t. but I can't emphisise enough, The way' YOU' play.

Yes, I had a assaultron head loose a star before I could scrip it. Now I always buy before scripping so I can get rid of them before they loose that extra star.
---
Seeing as everyone I know has issues with it on the PC including others in this sub even saying " yeah playing fo76 on the PC is far less stable than on the consoles.
---
I mean hell look at the hundreds of terrible reviews still coming out about how buggy and unstable the game is. But yeah everyone but you is wrong. Lmao
---
I've found entry to Vault 51 yesterday when I lost conscious after drinking Nuka Shine, but it's still unmarked location, even after touching the doors. I really hope they'll open vaults earlier - I sooo miss vault explorations from previous fallouts...
---
Sorry I triggered you, you must have been called this before must have struck a nerve well all I gota say is the guilty pig squeals you came to me
---
If we Do this, can we seperate underarmor, armor and apparel? 
---
Pretty please? 
---
I want to specialise in crafting shielded raider underarmor for example
---
I posted through Imgur off my mobile and it didn't inform me when I posted that it did it felt like it froze so I spammed the post button a few times sorry peepz lol my bad
---
Afraid not - backpacks cannot be traded or dropped
---
I have to disagree. I lvl 225 and ha e completed pretty much everything but I never farm flux. I have absolutely no use for it because I dont use PA anymore, prime guns arent worth the hassle at all, and I dont need serums.
---
couple weeks back both of my leg peices just vanished. no way I scrapped them on accident. the idea of losing the jet pack scares me it was hard to get. a whole power suit of armor though that's horrifying. could you have dropped it out thinking you placed it on accident? 
---
if you deploy (for pc its E ) its owned by you and goes into your bag if you don't pick it up in a couple minutes.
---
 if you Drop it(for me its R)  it will appear and you can get back into it but people can just get into it and steal it if they want and if you forget to pick it back up it will just stay there and you will lose it forever.
---
It was my bad through Imgur it didn't inform me I had posted when pressing post so I spammed it a few times haha üòã and yeh was good to see him plus im drunk üòêüòéüòã
---
Thank Bethesda for not implementing a zone chat so that we don't have to listen to this while playing.
---
Thats's a nice idea.
---
I often forget to equip happy camper when in my camp
---
I don't have any violet sorry. What's your GT?
---
Is this a sale or just normal price?
---
How dare you have your camp the way you want it instead of the way I do!
---
[There's also a cat north of Welch Station, too.](https://i.imgur.com/CRPIPux.png)
---
In FO4 in Nuka World there's one in a machine you always get on the first try. I decorated the counter of the level 3 vendors in my settlements with perfectly preserved pies. I spent a long time getting them...
---
more pvp: survival mode
---
higher cap per kill: high cap/kill ruined survival mode, lowering it made more people log into the servers on main accounts instead of only new toons for exp farming, giving more challenge and more people. reversing this will just kill servers again.  __get out of your own way__
---
more survival elements: like? we have food, water, desease, rads, supply farming and item decay to worry about. thats pretty much all the main ones in every survival related game ever.
---
Just in case you aren't aware, under level 50 you can choose to get a card from a different category than the special point you added, just cycle the categories (the buttons to do so are listed at the bottom).
---
I‚Äôm so glad someone shares how I‚Äôve felt for so long haha. 100% agree with you.
---
I would smack your crybaby hiney of you tried that dumb BS at my camp.
---
Im running bloodied + unyielding and Mine does 800-1k damage depending in cards equipped
---
No one have been reported. Thats why I asked here. But when people have 70-100 Serum and 30-50 X-01 Mods in their store it makes me wonder. ;)
---
Photons have Mass?
---
I didn't even know they were Catholic...
---
Imagine going out and meeting people for a change. There is life beyond Fallout games.
---
Pretty obvious why you have such low karma. People dont like trolls.
---
No, because even with the plan it would still take time to collect the materials for a single crafting. The plan means nothing without the materials to craft it, and the materials are spread out across several large activities which only holds a chance to drop them and requires amounts of these.
---
There are games similar to your tastes, go play them instead.
---
Welcome to the post apocalyptic wasteland where no one can be hurt and everyone just stands around looking at table arrangements, sending love heart emotes to each other.
---
yeah its a video game bud aint as big a deal as you make it out to be the game wasnt made to be a primarily pvp game if thats what you want go play that or the pvp mode as far as the changes it makes sense in adventure mode bethesda wants the majority of players to enjoy the game hemce why its adventure mode not a battle royale game you want pvp play pvp mode or a a different game no one has to play the game the way you want them to
---
Hi, I'm pretty damn good at wall, floor, roof wiring
---
You on console?
---
I had no idea either! I thought it was like the bug where sometimes the bots in the bunker would glow red. 
---
I saw the FM, it saw me and suddenly 2 assaultrons, a sentrybot and some armour piercing gutsys turned on me point-blank.
---
Xbox
---
Just imagine a T60 playing violin

---
First time ever I had three SBs attack me at once. All were level 80 and it was nearby Berkeley Springs on my way to the vendor. Maybe they've added SB activity in the area after the legendary vendor came dunno?
---
X-01 mods are going cheap as shit now due to being able to buy X-01 plans from production vendor now
---
You don't even need all the perks u/x_lincoln_x mentioned.
---
I use only one of the Shotgunner cards, don't use Grenadier or Demo Expert and Idon't need to fear most enemies. Use the Enforcer card to cripple your target and take your time finishing them.
---
With the player vending it is entirely possible to find a explosive or anti armor shotgun. Even a one star combat or pump action shotgun is already a big step towards confident only occasional crying Vault Dweller.
---
Ok see you this afternoon
---
I don‚Äôt understand. FOV‚Äôs don‚Äôt have any caps...
---
I like the idea but instead of plans, you buy one time use mods, because else people would just ask someone to make god weapons for them but if you had to earn one mod that you can only use once then everyone would have to earn it themselves, good idea tho :)
---
On desktop browser, top right there's a little drop-down below where you create a post. Then select flair.
---
Yeah I wish that were true. Found my mags in the wasteland.
---
Don't know if you know this but it is possible to fast travel now even if you are in danger. It just take like 15s and standing still.
---
Sadly, it's fairly unlikely that ZAX will be a badass PvE boss, given that ZAX units are static super computers. Could have some kind of liberty prime-style avatar body, but I wouldn't put caps on it.
---
That attitude is exactly why Beths made a change to this game. Just because someone is good with vats, it doesn't mean he/she is truly skilled in gaming. I mean, just be frank, a 5 years old can do that. And that 5 years old doesn't buy atoms ;)
---
And gaming is a bad source for life lesson. You learn life lessons in school, interns, and work places.
---
Well, no, but in a laser that can burn metal?
---
That‚Äôs a little overboard. Clothing and armor should suffice. Shielded underwear would count as armor cuz stats.
---
Never.
---
no
---
I had the same issue the other day, someone on here suggested I try aiming at the actual udder when I press the button, i thought they were just joking with me but it worked straight away!
---
It's the numbers of Serums and X-01 Mods I see in shops. I havent seen any recipes for the Serums but my guess make 80-100 Serums would take a hugh amount of resources but I guess it might be legit.
---
Just wanned to air it out there and see what people think.
---
This ! So much THIS !
---
Imagine that Event at the Son's of Dane-Compund where you have to Play Instruments to lure out the Wendigo. With a full band in powerarmor it would totaly fail because the creature wouldd go ' OY wtf is that noise ?, Im outa here
---
yeah theres still duping i reported a player after i went to check his store cuz it said he had 400 plus plans for sale so i was like cool he might have soke good shit i meed but it was all serum recipes nothing else which means at best if he did it legit it would of cost him over 8 mil in caps soo obvi duper so i reported him
---
Have you tried hunting rabbits with a rifle, bloody amazing mechanic, no scamming no PVP just you against the environment. created by BSG. You are complaining about one part of the game, that is fair enough but there is a whole other word out there in this game, many ways to play.
---
Try not to get so obsessed with only one aspect, PVP and player interaction. I avoid other players like the plague, unless they are a vendor, even then I only interact with a machine.
---
Not for me thanks. Happy for others to have it as an option. More concerned with some of the distant ground colouring at nighttime which occasionally looks lime green.
---
Is't survival mode what you are describing for the most part or are you saying you want this implemented in adventure mode?
---
Most games implement different servers for different player types.
---
PVE servers for those that want to mess around and enjoy their experience and not allow griefing.
---
PVP for those that want to go up against other players.
---
The complaints you have described in reading were mostly based on the adventure mode part - not survival.
---
In fact, the complaints i've read about survival is that it needs to be a little more ruthless. 
---
So if you are referring to Survival mode - then i agree and have at it. 
---
But if you are referring to Adventure mode, then i guess you should really stop playing in survival as it's clearly not for you and why you are playing in adventure mode and so concerned with it raises its own questions.
---
Everything you mentioned about people expecting code to protect them is complete bull - When i play destiny and enter PVP mode, i know i need only worry about the environment and not players. The opposite with PVP.
---
With World of Warcraft, if i flag myself for PVP, then i need to worry about both players and environment. 
---
But protecting players that have no interest in PVP is nothing new as you seem to be alluding to. Sometimes after leading our real lives, some of us like to boot up a game and play it how we like, not how some random guy on reddit thinks we should. People don't learn real world consequences from video games, the entire point of video games is to escape the real world.
---
I love jumping on with a few friends every few days and launching a queen fight and all the grinding for ammo etc to get set up for the fight.
---
What i dont want is to then be griefed by people like you while i am doing so, losing everything i have gained while prepping or being killed right at the end of the queen fight - that's what survival mode is for (minus losing ALL your stuff of course) 
---
You mention a hivemind of pussys and to think for ourselves. I am thinking for myself, and playing a game the way i like to. 
---
When i crave PVP, i play Rainbow Six Siege or mess around in the Division 2 - I didn't buy fallout 76 for PVP, i bought it to play with friends so while i have no interest in listening to a "hivemind of pussys", i  have even less interest in doing what a random reddit ever thinks i should be.
---
Just stay in survival mode and don't worry yourself about what we are all doing in adventure mode and everyone is happy no? 
---
Or hell, if survival mode is too difficult for you and lacks the grieving opportunities you crave due to people being able to fight back,  maybe try a different game. (Not Rust though, you won't like that if you can't hack survival mode on Fallout 76)
---
Well that sucks... sorry.
---
I have found 3 and 5 so far and they did count... I will be pulling my hair if they don't... this is being a pain so far.
---
Oh okay. I guess I'll just have to help him complete it. Also somehow I ended up with the high capacity mod without purchasing it. I only found this out after I purchased the blue print for it only to discover that it says already known. Is that a bug or does it give that mod to everyone?
---
oh yes! the locations story is essentially before the bombs someone pranking the visitors by rigging a recording of screaming, making fake tremors and making the paintings spin all from a terminal in a tree! admitedly, i found the tree before the location, so my experienced of being spooped was ruined
---
Well, in the case of the instruments that could be solved by having an alternate animation where the character picks up the instrument and stands infront of the chair while playing it instead of sitting down ?
---
Enforcer x3 and aim at the legs. It makes everything easy. I take out glowing ghouls, assaultrons and mirelurk queens this way. A deathclaw? No problem!
---
Protectrons in Watoga I shoot their arms instead and keep away when the self destruct.
---
I usually use a melee weapon on the helpless creature to make my shotty last longer.
---
390+ and I still have use for flux. [repairing] Decontamination arches, shielded underwear linings, prime weapon receivers and ammo, serums for selling. 
---
I don‚Äôt use power armor either. People are willing to pay a pretty penny for pure flux. With green thumb perk while roaming a blast zone, farming flux is more of a reflex at this point and is something to do when the spawns at whitesprings stop working.
---
Hoooo yes that place was perfect! Met it on our first day with a friend, it was great.
---
If you rename an item is the new name visible to just you or do others see the new name?
---
I've been thinking I should name the 3 stars with some abbreviation of their secondary/tertiary effects.  Most people would do this honestly.
---
Archer, Athlete, and mammalist!
---
I bought both my serum recipes at full enclave price, and I still sell my crafted serums for less than 600 caps. They are cheap enough to make, and I also consider it a public service.
---
Stacks of X-01 mods OTOH, I have no idea where those come from.
---
Yeah but you can't actually craft the mod and still it just add it to the armor pieces
---
Just to add....
---
" like dealing with customers basic people skills"
---
How does the game teach that exactly? Is it those interactions with griefers that scream threats down their microphone about raping my mother while destroying me 3 on 1 and then stalking me until i switch servers. (guess the fact i am forced to switch server makes me one of those "pussies" you are referring to)
---
Yea, what a fantastic environment to teach you things like  dealing with customers basic people skills. 
---
I would honestly rather learn that in real life when face to face with someone - amazing how i don't hear that in real life, can't imagine why.
---
Next time you're at West Tek, collect some of that glorious Toxic Goo. Works wonders for giving yourself large doses of rads rapidly.
---
The Queen used to drop serum recipies
---
Did you end up running it?
---
I love people saying things like the pacifist camp update no longer make it a "true survival game." Good, go play some other game with a 100% persistent world where people can break into your base, kill you while you sleep, and steal everything you own. Sounds fun, right? It'll teach you valuable life lessons and coordination. We'll keep playing Fallout 76, where you can have a job and a life and still get to experience the game. The risk *is* still there, I just no longer have to deal with a fight if I choose not to. Choice, what a horrible thing to give your players...
---
Hit Grafton from the North side, snipping everything from across the street, the head South-East around the large storage drums and move towards the workbench.  When you re-enter the Steelworks a lot of SM will respawn and I usually walk out with 300-400 lbs of weapons, mostly Assault and Sledges and it does crap into a lot of Steel.  The caps they drop pay for the fast travel and taking the workshop so this one is worth the effort.
---
Go get your head blown off in survival - you know you want to.
---
This is what happens when everyone gets a trophy.
---
Over 5 characters i rolled around a 100 2 star weapons from which i gotten 5 weapons one of my builds will keep &amp; around another 10 i thought were good enough to sell. 
---
But trying to hit the 150 scrip limit on all 5 characters can be very time intensive so all weapons that have not sold by the time the machine resets get scraped for scrip again.
---
I spend most of my time in survival? What has that got to do with anything?
---
Depends if it's an upgrade for you and if you can manage the fusion core.
---
It's a weird bug, items in vending machines or fermenters aren't *actually* taking up your camp budget, it's just for some reason they can't be put in if your budget is maxed out. If you scrap enough to make it possible, you'll notice you can put any number of things in your vending machines and it won't actually affect your budget.
---
I must agree with some of comment below - video game shouldn't be source of real life lessons - it's just games and should be treat as entertainment, not life learning. Therefore I'm glad that BGS separated Adventure and Survival servers and removed the camp damage (accidental) - let the griefers do mayhem on survival - there they'll have to think twice before attacking others, since they can find worthy opponents on survival servers.
---
If anyone else is having Problems with the Syringer/Yogi-Part : The Bleedout-Barrel is helping alot. If you are on PC, drop me a message here and i'll see about Setting up a Meeting to fix you up with the modification.
---
The problem is you need these crutches to even damage players adequately. I've already encountered players that if your not using anti-armor get tickled for almost no damage.(have shot guys in power armor from fairly close with a FE pump, and his health barely move) switch to my AAE Gatling Plasma and I proceed to insta kill the same player.
---
They Nerf legendary effects anymore everyone is just going to switch to the next crutch which will be incisor melee as that will still easily allow people to insta gib one another.
---
Correct, but now people have plans, they need the mods less
---
The reason I don't care much for the flux is I can buy most pure flux for 100-300 caps. I can still sell serums for a profit still. And I've got plenty of underarmors that just don't sell that well so I'm not in much need for them.
---
Buddy of mine suggested they simply remove VATS from survival, which is one step in the right direction.
---
Ah, okay. Thanks alot. So, if I scrap some camp-decoration to stock up my Fermenter and Shops i should be able to put up the verry same decorations again afterwards without budget-issues right ?
---
Need me to build you something? Lol
---
Would need any rare mats provided (e.g. crystal)
---
I have noticed a huge difference in the weapon durability bar when switching between stocks, so I choose the one with the highest bar.
---
Imagine a group of people in power armors playing awful music, each on his own instrument before nuking fissure prime
---
That must be a bug!
---
I have a railing I scrap before adding stuff to my vending machine. Then I have to rebuild it loosing a few wood, but I got plenty, so I don't care about that. It's a hassle though!
---
Try sneaking and don't let it see you before you milk. Also, use the Brahmin Pen. Fertilizer in C.A.M.P.
---
IDK my build has 10 int so I just run both. I wish when Bethesda nerfed demo expert they'd at least make it a 3 rank perk instead of 5 still which just makes me sad ;-;
---
Yeah, but it might get annoying to scrap and rebuild every time you want to change what's in your fermenter/shops.
---
The nights used to be darker, but they patched it to make it lighter a while back.
---
I would think you are extremely lucky. Or unlucky, depening on how you see it.
---
It's a bug you're able to give it to others to borrow the "known" plan they equip it to the backpack and now have the mod. I helped my friend get the backpack to give him the mod before they fix I don't want him to server hop to do 25-30 camp fire tale events like i did
---
Could you build something around the plants to protect them? Foundations and walls around your crops should effectively be a greenhouse
---
Same!
---
not worth any discussion since the "low lvl chars" with 6+ vending machines dominate the "market" anyway. they've duped everything they can in the game and sell it for prices way too low for any other trader to compete with. some Mods are pretty hard to find and therefore the high pricing is justified but prices get dumped more and more. so "honest selling" is not worth anything right now.....when the vending machines got released i sold stuff everyday. now not even 1 item per day. it may also have smth to do with ppl getting their hands on every BP very fast so the demand is not that high anymore but still the biggest problem i see is the duper-vendors...so talking about prices is useless until they fix the duper vendors
---
Fully agree mate but the majority of people who play this game, which Bethesda listens to are goons who wanna build pretty camps and share camp tales around a fire. God forbid you get robbed in a post apocalyptic wasteland to...
---
The minority are constantly ignored, but post about your pretty camp and your awesome.
---
At the end of the day it is a game but the Fortnite esque outfits and all the bitches constantly asking for new camp items, more storage, nerfing weapons, the list goes on....
---
All people do is complain about the bullshit side of things, rather than ask for a more real experience, they ask for a fairy tale and things to be easier.
---
Not enough people like you and its a shame, you have my full gratitude and appreciation.
---
Depending on how I am doing for flux vs whether I need caps or not and whether I can be arsed to vendor a pile of 'dropped' weapons/meat/shit I find laying around or I am feeling lazy I vendor serums.
---
Is not that unusual either.
---
I have had the game crash when eating from the pip-boy, but more commonly lately when succeeding in picking locks. It's been both doors and safes. I once picked a safe and CTD. Restarted and joind my friends on the same server and picked the same lock again. CTD again.
---
This works really well as a crown controller and instigator.
---
I use a bloodied build with a bloodied swing speed bat and 10mm smg but I reckon iron fist would be more efficient in perks (plus extra fun with Nukashine).
---
A minimum of eight luck is necessary as you need serendipity when you‚Äôre in the thick of things, bloody mess for extra dmg for all weps and starched genes to keep Marsupial, Speed Demon at least.
---
I have 11 luck to have 3x Tormentor for Scorch beasts but switch it with Super Duper for crafting and Grim Reapers for blowing through easy crowds with Gun Fu (fun but situational and not for end game, 10mm smg blows through all AP very quickly).
---
In strength I‚Äôd recommend
---
3 iron fist
---
3 martial artist
---
3 incisor
---
3 blocker
---
3 barbarian
---
I run that but instead of iron fist and barbarian six levels of slugger.
---
Agility and sneak is very good with melee/automatics, especially with bloodied. I highly recommend adrenaline, born survivor, escape artist and ninja/covert. Sneak 1-3 depending on how heavy your chest piece is and how much you like sneaking during combat.
---
I have upgraded the weapon with burning damage. Think of using it mostly to kill SB and SQB. It will be a backup for my AAE .50 cal. If it is not really worth its name i will first try selling then dump it is there is no takers.
---
If we're not in team Im always in for meeting new players ..   Im level 110 ,have mic and live in the CEST timezone ... 
---
Psn Ulakanakulot_1
---
We have [fallout76settlements](http://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements) though!
---
Yes this too.
---
Whenever a character I'm playing managed to get one, I keep it in their inventory forever.
---
So far I've managed to land 7 or of the thousands of attempts
---
It'd be cool if it was optional.
---
yeah but the price of recipes combined with the drop rate of recipes it mathematically isnt possible for someone to have acquired over 100 of every serum recipe even if they played 12 hr a day everyday since first beta session which leaves only 2 possibilities they either duped or got them from duper but simce i doubt a duper is going to just give that away most likely they were the duper so i reported if im wrong nothing happenes to them if im right they get banned as they should be but they can see what items were duped and what wasnt and if the person duped or not .. i think everyone who does that kind of shit should be banned it ruims the game for others who actually want to enjoy ppayimg the game right just like theres a mask in the game you see all these high level players selling at thier camps but bethesda even said only 5 in the game were not duped items think about that almost every player over 150 has at least one but only 5 were not duped soo how much shit do you think would dissappear if they actually just straight up wiped every duped item as i think they should and hope they do
---
I've been getting into using a Bloodied Black Powder recently. Honestly, I prefer it to the Dragon. The reload time is long enough with just the one barrel! Also, the bayonet attachment is awesome, no more punching roaches! 
---
It's a novelty weapon regardless, it seems to suffer from armour penetration issues as well as damage falloff/ penetration at range. It can't even begin to compare to say a Bloodied Lever Action, but it sure is fun!
---
I want the skin, but I also want the lever action skin. Why are they priced differently!?
---
Thats for sure. But at least there IS a Workaround until that pesky bug got squashed with a superhammer asap
---
Ikr. Pussies are ruining this game.
---
The main food is Sweet tato stew.  
---
Cranberry anything is nice for XP.  Otherwise the best foods tend to be very difficult to make due to spoilage, even with Good with salt.
---
Hey man, I can't find a "Google". What should I be looking for and where?
---
I have stacks of Xo1 mods. My girl has stacks of serums. 
---
We are not, nor have we ever duped. 
---
I have stacks of Xo1 mods from countless server hops in search of calibrated shocks and jetpacks. 
---
She has stacks of serums because they are cheap to make and people buy them up as fast as she makes them. 
---
The dupers are the ones selling 30 of the same God roll weapon/armor.
---
Good With Salt is life. Currently the second rank *does* stack with the fridge backpack mod (despite saying otherwise) so you can go HAM with quality prepared foods. I like to make the harder to find stuff but otherwise they go bad before I can properly sell or use all of them. Really need some kind of fridge for selling food at your camp.
---
To date though the best selling food at my camp has been prepackaged: cajun rice and beans and scanned coffee. I also do fasnacht donuts and royal jelly taffy just because they don't expire.
---
One easy to make thing that sounds exotic and sells well when fresh: megasloth mushroom soup. Sloths can be hard to find but server hopping at Tanagra Town is where I usually spot one. They don't always drop mushrooms so when you craft it use Super Duper. The bonus gives you +20% crit damage which is great for something so basic.
---
still too op there is no method that works how you want it too that is healthy for the game maybe a one time use mod thats drop akd you can never get another one but you can add it to any item it works on other than that too op no katter what
---
No thanks. I can‚Äôt stand games that are too dark for you to see.
---
So ... on launch when PvP was still not restricted and camps were destructible, the majority of players helped the newbies. Also they joined groups, created shenanigans and extremely rarely there were griefers. And now when the majority of players have what they wanted, the griefers started to whine and moan. Why? Don't force PvP on adventure and I won't moan about unfair killing in survival.
---
There are apps out there that do this. Way easier and widely available
---
How about weapon skins for weapons people actually use.
---
I have been watching this sub for a while, and I think that people asking for absolutely random unnecessary bullshit like this are murdering the already dead game even more. The game needs basic fixing, not adding pointless shit that will be fun for two minutes.  If you like the game you should stop asking unnecessary crap being added just because you farted and this idea came up. Just sayin.
---
This is so cool! Post pics of your restaurant please!
---
1. Any meat grilled is easy to cook and widely available, but it's a boring dish
---
2. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aen9jf/an_almost_master_list_of_cooking_recipes_with/) lists some of the rarest and endgame dishes
---
3. You're going to need to replace the Heavy weapons perks with One Handed ones to get the most out of your rolling pin
---
Nice score , I saw a guy selling them for 500 last night
---
*Argument
---
1 cap
---
I'm with you 100% just saying they might not of payed 20000 to get all those
---

---
This has what you need.
---
This is what I do too. Enforcer (I only have it x1 and it‚Äôs just as effective, weirdly) and aim at the legs with VATS and even the toughest enemy becomes incredibly easy because it can‚Äôt move. I cripple the legs (for Scorchbeast I do the wings first so that they land and don‚Äôt take off, for the Mirelurk Queen I do the sprouts first so that she stops shooting that acid/poison stuff that kills me so quickly) and then switch to my lever action or handmade to finish them (because I‚Äôm mainly a rifle build.). It makes it so easy that it almost feels like cheating sometimes!
---
Server hop a few times.
---
There are several possible Locations. One is at **Philippi Battlefield Cemetery right on the Center pathway. Just serverhop a bit there and you should get lucky.**
---
beside that, think like a Tourist. Where would you go to in Appalachia ? wich sights would you check out ?
---
r/IAmVerySmart much?

Or the trash can drum... It could bend a little though
---
Nope you‚Äôre definitely not the only one. I occasionally whip out my TSE double barrel shotgun when I deal with low level mobs.
---
Omg nobody will buy my shotgun shells!
---
Have you ever found one in a vending machine on   Xbox?
---
Sounds as though you have it all worked out. 
---
No need to remove the limit
---
Yeah thanks, l may have worded my plea incorrectly,  was hoping someone has literally seen the corpse so l could join their game. I'm currently server hopping and fast travelling between the water park and cemetery:)
---
Is the overseer a static spawn? I've been all around that area and found nothing.
---
Due to poor eyesight I would prefer a slider vs global darker nights.
---
Hell yea dew it
---
There‚Äôs a better workaround. Just server hop once and you should be able to restock your machine.
---
He will spare you if you buy skyrim
---
Mire is the best
---
If you build your base at the right spot you will het constant scorched beast  attacking
---
Man I think they used too..then I think and update messed with the lighting. I will say it is darker in the marsh lands.
---
I switched to a melee/rifle combo.
---
I got a few keepers (3* scout armor) the first day, but everything since (especially the 3* wood) has been scrapped straight away.
---
And again you don't understand the problem. It is not one setting, which can be switched on a whim, but not in the middle of a battle. Also in WoW (your example), there were certain maps where you didn't have to worry from the enemy faction and there are guards in the settlements, which provide so.e kind of protection in the area from high leveled players, who could invade the zone. They were also limited by their level from certain zones. But in the last thread you wanted a whole map PvP (bloody murder of innocent), because the game forces workshop in challenges and when claimed they are flagged for it, but the setting is not switched off for them. Also you can see them on the map and can ambush them, which you confirmed.
---
If you still want to force your play style on us, I can only demand PvP without legendary effects and mutations. Which in the previous post you hated so much "because the game is built upon those effects".
---
Would make sense
---
*Rearranges decomposing radstag meat pile to make it look like a deathclaw*
---
Woah, on PS4 every vendor I check out has them for 300 caps max.
---
It‚Äôs weird to me how high some people say certain things sell for when I‚Äôve never seen them for higher than a small fraction of that price (like the person who said the mole mask goes for 5K - 10k caps when I regularly sell them and see them for less than 500.) I wonder if the perception of ‚Äútypical‚Äù prices is skewed because someone checking out a vendor is seeing a lot of stuff that doesn‚Äôt sell - just because something is listed for some crazy price doesn‚Äôt mean they have ever sold for that price. It will be interesting to see what prices stabilize at after a few months after prices are dropped on the things that don‚Äôt sell.
---
As one of those people selling outfits, I understand your struggle.
---
Cap max is 25,000.
---
Yep for myself I do, but it is still annoying that this is the "solution" and bethesda just puts arbitrary limits on things for no reason!
---
I always have 3-5 weapons that I cycle through largely depending on mood and slightly dependent upon situation.  I always carry and use often my level 50 2 star anti armour combat shottie specced for range.
---
Not I:

I think that is a good idea. Beths should try it since it's beta anyway.

Practice safe scripping.  You know it makes sense.

I was going to say this same bit of lore.
---
It's a free fast travel point, so anyone including the new ones can travel for free to shop at the nearby camp. Works for high traffic.
---
Same issue on PS4
---
It's in the game. Just yesterday I saw someone wearing it. And the reason for them not having any protective stats is that you're not urged into wearing one when you prefer to not cover your head or want to wear fancy hats or something. Personally, I appreciate this choice. It's also easier to pull off on a technical level because they don't have to implement a separate head outfit category or a hide helmet option.
---
Riot armor
---
I'm using armour plated back pack but in the same time i hate Pioneer scouts. I wanted to just buy plans for mods but no one is selling those even if you offer 25k caps
---
I suppose so, but then we'd have a symmetrical preview window
---
Are you on pc?
---
Vault 94 will be open in middle of summer, atleast by [roadmap.](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57rzdd8RrXf5hNuIF3ofZJ/5e77803a3f8a7c43259a1b1f672ec2ff/Fallout76_RoadMap_2018_02-21_FINAL.PNG)  I didn't find any info on 51 thought, but i belive all 3, or how much vaults there are, will be open till end of year.
---
Also why it's number 1, because I do think it's the most important and prolly also the easiest to implement :)
---
hopefully, Fallout game without a vaults is not really fallout game ;)
---
Probably not many. Shotguns suffer some significant range issues, but don‚Äôt do much more damage per shot than sniper rifles, and automatic rifles do significantly more DPS. At the range that shotguns are effective, it often makes more sense to just go melee.
---
Archer, swimmer, athlete
---
Just for swimmer you need to revive someone in water helped friend do all of them and exams still took 5 hours somehow
---
TL;DR I want my dream weapons/armors stupid easy
---
End game boss in Fo1 was too "static". That would be awesome some huge terminal with turets and traps around in room. I hope we will finaly get some real boss that need tactic, instead of tones aid/ammo.
---
Oh, allright then. Are you on PC ? If so ill see if i can find that rotten nuisance for ya
---
I think it even always was supposed to be more but the servers just couldn't handle it just like the stash limit
---
Thanks ! I'll try that nex time i run into this bug
---
They literally made an entire game mode for you guys, why are you being a miserable whiner when you could just play survival
---
Rad resist is useless just simple diluted radx replaces it and there is no rad resist that help you in rad zone, you just need rad reduction from hazmat or pa frame
---
Just stab the stick through the snare first try and pull a sad face at the camera
---
Yeah - and I didn't read the note at the bottom, so void the first part. Don't steal from dev rooms, children!
---
I found the same event in the forest while looking for firecaps. Somewhere near the isolated cabin i think
---
You must have 16 arms
---
Yeah, ever since they made the vendor changes where now all factions offer all of their plans at all times, their value has shot way down.
---
4 serves no point. Everyone would place the beacon using up camp budget or just build near monumemts. Serves no purpose but to restrict an already restrictive build system.
---
5 is pointless no one would place stuff out unless they wanted to bait traps or give it away to begin with.
---
7 I'm against because I'm a solo player. I'd rather a dungeon that scales appropriately so groups can get their challenge but I can also have mine.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. Not intentional and not secret info. I‚Äôve seen it on a lot of things (rarely). Even other junk.
---
Caps
---
I thankfully didnt get the scream jumpscare when i went there. Killed the ghouls, read the notes, when things started shaking i noped the fuck out.
---
Don't quit to the Main menu, use the social menu and on the top click on your Name and Hit leave World, and then Hit Play again and then you'll be Put on a New server
---
I‚Äôm $eriou$ly confu$ed a$ to why they won‚Äôt make $kins apply to all weapon$.
---
So you mean a game i can mod myself and fix/patch with community made content? Then, maybe i just might get it from the used market. As I  would want to give Bethesda any more of my money if possible, because even with Skyrim/fallout 4, it wasn't Bethesda that made great for me it was the community based groups such as the nexus that did, Bethesda released a game with tons of game breaking bugs in which you cannot progress through the game but people at the nexus made patches and fixes making it possible to continue playing the game. 
---
And all this along with tons of content was given for free by people who were not getting paid to do it. So i don't see any reason for Bethesda not to be able to fix these game breaking issues when they are actually getting paid for it.
---
Bashing works. Take it most of the way down with a proper weapon, throw on some power armor and beat it to death.
---
Have you guys had the bug where your vending machines randomly lose all items and they all go back to your stash?
---
I like that about fallout though. The only game i think that doesn't do something like that was the haunted mansion in Nuka world I believe.
---
First thing to remember is your primary effect doesn‚Äôt show a damage boost, but it boosts your effective damage. 
---
Then, just realize that if you aren‚Äôt running a low health build, that‚Äôs pretty much as high as you can get it without temporary buffs.
---
Was the location at the NW Of the map?
---
&gt; yeah playing fo76 on the PC is far less stable than on the consoles.
---
hmmm, and what is a "console"? It is literally a specialized "computer" which has limited and known hardware (which thee game is optimized for)- and what was my claim in the beginning? That with the diversity of hardware on gaming PCs, this mess could not have been avoided. I never claimed there were no bugs, nor that thee wasn't server instability.
---
Your claim is that "it runs all the same"' then there would be NO DIFFERENCE between consoles and PC and there is, as you have admitted in this previous comment and is well known.
---
and that is why I hinted, partly by sharing that link, that you may have to tone down your system and turn overclocking off- or maybe even underclock (and sorry, no I didn't say it outright) but we all know that consoles have crap for procs compared to PC even without overclocking.
---
And i seriously hope you know that standard clock speed is determined by the probability of system crash under normal circumstances. Any time you overclock you increase the probability of crashes.
---
and all this is compounded by a massive world being transmitted through a network- you know like the damn invisible enemies- it doesn't matter how good orr faas your system is if the client has not received the data to render aspects of the game because there is nothing there to render.
---
An easy case in point- I have not had any invisible enemies since the beta-- until i was too damn excited after hoping servers seeing Uranium Fever and fast traveled before the world fully loaded- and yeah they killed me and yeah, my junk had not even spawned by the time I respawned but it did after 20 seconds, aas did the enemies- that is straight up network lag
---
Could it be optimized, sure and for the most part it has been slowly getting there, but you have to work within the limits with that and when joining a new server just wait- then all is good-- or i could bump my 35 mbps up to 50 mbps and it would help (even if it doesn't cure it completely) and that isn't something that Beth has control over, now is it?
---
And you got it all backwards- i am not the one saying that "it is all Beth's fault"- i have repeatedly alluded to it being more complex and that those on PC have to address what they can on their end because hardware varies- and that (at least used to be) literally the point of having a gaming PC.
---
YES. I was pretty disappointed when I got it for my raider princess.
---
One of the upcoming survival rewards is a decent 3* DCG so I stand by what I said.
---
I saw those planters in one of the lookout towers. Every level up they had different stuff in them. I want them so bad for a rooftop garden.
---
Vault 76 dwellers... americas best and brightest but we can't figure out how to put some dirt in a planter.
---
+1 on the level 30 wall. I hit that and stopped playing for about 5 months before returning a few weeks ago. You don‚Äôt say what your play style is which would help. E.g. melee, sniper or etc.
---
I love leader of the pack, easy legendaries to sell, even if they are only one star.
---
Why are you complaining? You have your arcade style free-for-all Kiddy death match gear vs gear pvp mode.
---
 You wanna shoot each other all day long ? Have at it, that's all well and good for you.  You have a whole game mode dedicated to that.
---
The only plan that is tradeable is the high capacity one, and that‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs bugged and you ‚Äúlearn‚Äù it just by having it in your inventory. Everything else backpack related has to be done yourself.
---
Well, if someone is crazy and grinds a ton of possum badges, I suppose they could buy extra mod plans and sell them to people.
---
Or how about being able to play them while walking around and people being able to give you a donation via caps. I think even just being able to play while walking around would be cool.
---
Wait...
---
You can get legendary shovels?
---
You can get shovels that aren't level 5?
---
Where?!?
---
Doesn't uranium fever only drop up to level 40 legendaries though?
---
I mean, it‚Äôs a single shot gun, have to reload after each shot.
---
Thanks. I hope I'll remember that nex time i'm fumbling around in a Panic in the face of nuclear Annihilation :p
---
Whitesprings main entrance, on top of car where you go into the building.
---
This is actually pretty common, in F4 we see the Stars and Stripes Bandana use the 50 star flag, instead of the 13 star one. I don‚Äôt remember the exact info about it but iirc the 50 star flag was still used, just to a lesser degree.
---
Okay! nice feedback! Here is some counter input :)
---
4. Police beacon should either be really really expensive in rare materials OR take up alot of C.A.M.P budget, so that it forces the player to weigh in pros and cons by placing it or alternativly place their camp near a Trainstation, thereby not getting those sweet resource spots :)
---
5. Not pointless in other senses though, as placing those items would allow us to make a more "lived in" C.A.M.P that doesn't look all the other camps. Yes one would have to keep in mind that it COULD be stolen but that is risk / worth factor that would forced unto all players, which I think is healthy game play. :)
---
7. I solo stuff like 95% of the time aswell, but I do wish that were content that FORCED me to team up with others! There is already plenty of stuff to solo and this is not a Fallout Prime Number game which means that it doesn't have to follow the everything should be singleplayer mentality :)
---
I‚Äôm on a diet and your pie looks insanely yummy
---
If you make shielded raider underarmor those will sell like hot-cakes.
---
I loved finding this as a mutant that likes to climb buildings months ago.
---
hes a yoa gui now and I don't trust him
---
others dont see the changed name no, i did this and realised i wasted my time lol
---
Go play survival. The game doesn‚Äôt have to teach you life skills. If you don‚Äôt like where this game is right now, then go play something else? Some people want to play the game how they would like to and if building camps is their thing then let them enjoy, if you want pvp then go play survival mode. To say that the game must teach you life skills is just plain stupid. Most people aren‚Äôt looking at games and saying ‚ÄúOh boy that game sure does look like it‚Äôll teach me life skills!‚Äù And for what you said about people grinding hard for weapons that kill you near instantly, the game revolves around RNG most of the time, so while they may kill one legendary and get a godlike weapon and I kill multiple and get a legendary wooden stick, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre better, just luckier.
---
I saw him up in Toxic Valley near Clarksburg IIRC.
---
see my other comments, eventually got it by going to it a different route (that was more above water).
---
maybe not much more darker...like use the pipboy light to see anything dark, but a bit darker would be nice, now its hard to tell if it is noon or midnight.
---
Most of the problems come from players hoarding thousands of armors/weapons, wanting to build bigger camps, infinite server hopping for a piece of recipes and so on and Bethesda not being able to handle these issues.
---
Don't think Bethesda expected players to act like this. Hell, I didn't expect it either. I thought all fallout fans were laid back casuals. But it turns out more than half of them are hardcore min/maxers or hoarders or CAMP lunatics who would never miss out a chance to dupe of glitch the game. 
---
They always complain the game's unstable but they want the game to stay unstable so that they can somehow abuse the shit out of it and have an advantage over other players. Not cool. Big disappointment to both Bethesda and fallout fanbase.
---
On this guy I'm going for pretty much all of the mutations so I don't really care of they come or go. I do have Starched Gene's 2 on the side. But I only put it on when using radaway or something that can make me lose a mutation. Mostly though I just let them come and go as they please. You can only gain or lose one per session anyway.
---
I know that feel somewhat.
---
In the early days someone nuked the quest area i was in. I quitted to the Main menu (and hoped) to join another Server. Well of course Not, i spawned inside the nuke zone without power armor or hazmat suit...
---
Bye Bye junk xD
---
Again, the fatman is "bigger", but it's a set of rails rather than a solid tube, and is probably made of aluminum.
---
Milking Brahmin is based upon your Charisma, the higher your charisma the higher the chance you get a successful milking with at 15 Charisma is 100%
---
My camp is also near the haunted cabins, so very new players tend to get weirded out by the earthquakes and screaming.
---
Would reccommend as a raider camp spot, but I went for it because junk deposit and quiet area.
---
I'd be up for that, especially if it were mutual.
---
Would also be nice to get some of the revive players on a team stuff done.
---
EU, PS4, PSN: JohnHughes72, online around 21:00 CEST.

Puts into perspective how all thise people must have felt on 23 October, 2077. They didn't have a logout button.
---
I ran into this and thought it was great so I got 3 new friends and had them run in without any warning and pulled out a bag of popcorn
---
Instead of inventing lighter machine guns, the people in the Fallout universe invented power armor and Buffout. Deal with it.
---
XB1 unfortunately, but thanks for the offer:)
---
Can I give alcohol instead of candy?
---
Not personaly but i heared about it from someone else. As for going back to the stash, they never realy leave the stash to begin with. They are basicaly just marked up for sale inside ths stash. But I know what you mean.
---
DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY BUNNGGGGHOLLLLLLLEEEEEE
---
I HAVE NO BUNGHOLLLLLLEEEEEE
---
The game was built to be played like this. I am the most casual player ever, perhaps. I play whatever seems like the most fun thing to do, no server hopping for plans or anything. And even I server hopped for Fasnacht parade because I wanted as many plans and masks I could get before the event expired. Fallout 76 bring out different sides of people. Things they'd usually wouldn't do in a single player game.
---
If you want to stick with shotguns, just look at your perks and see what effects shotguns and start from there. Everything else is just about how you want to play/what type of legendary shotgun you get. As far as getting legendaries go, you can start with some of the events until you get better gear to start farming stronger enemies. Leader of the pack is really good. You will usually get 3 low level wolf legendaries leading each group of wolves. Also keep an eye out for any "horde" events on the map. The leader of a horde is a legendary. And no matter what level the legendary item is, grap it and sell it for scrip. Then you can buy level 50 gear from the legendary vendor
---
Why can't we just do like a half crouch (basically a sitting position) then lock the joint servos? We'd basically just turn the lower half of our power armor into a chair.
---
I still don't see a point in the beacon/getting caught system except with your tied in with your place items risk them getting stolen.
---
I'd bet so many people would just not bother to place anything or just common junk.
---
As for content that forces you to team up I disagree with still because I like content like the queen or imposter where players just come together naturally. I also like interacting spontaneously with players like vending has created.
---
As for challenging content I understand the need for good group based challenges but they also should lock people out who don't want to have to group with strangers just to get some rewards.
---
So if when entering said dungeon or raid it instances to you or your group it scales. Example if you and 3 other max level guys enter everything spawns max level maybe even extra bad guys with a buff. Also maybe the boss fight adds an extra mechanic that requires coordination.
---
But if someone max level enters alone the bad guys are still beefy but maybe a few less of them and the boss mechanic changes somehow. 
---
To balance it would be hard but I think possible with some creativity.
---
This happened to me but not like every other time I've experienced. I play solo in currently level 43. Back in the early thirties I set up on the golf course. Nice little area flat ground nothing to overlevelled unless some level 100 walks through. Anyways so there I am just getting back from doing the majority of the bos questline. I got to the end and realize what it entails and leave that area. So I arrive home and the gods of karma decided I'd killed to many players. 6 scorchbeasts. No cover nothing to really help me as I was to far from robo army. They destroyed everything. I was going through a drought on resources too and it stunted my growth in game for weeks. I had no events I just got lucky that a bug decided to bring them with me from the area for that quest. I was livid and quit the game like a week later when a gang( 4-5 lvl 20s with 2 lvl 60s) decided to wreck my base and grief me. I just got back into it and had I not had my 300 stimpacks to sell I might not have been able to stay
---
I would like to know this as well
---
The issue with their way of doing is that since I KNOW I can't get enough atoms by playing, I tend to disregard the whole atomshop. I don't really look at what's proposed, nor do I ponder if it's worth buying an item and/or then buy atoms with real money.
---
I just go "meh" and ignore it.
---
If the offers were permanent, and I could get 50 atoms a day EASILY (not by doing impossible bullshit like "getting engaged in PVP while naked"), I would probably say "I've grinded for atoms for a few weeks, I could buy this and that, but I also want that other one, so i'll buy".
---
That's actually what I did for Hearthstone : I can get gold "easily", so I don't mind paying here and there when there's something I'd want quickly. 
---
While right now, I feel it's impossible to buy stuff with in-game earned atoms. WHO can win 1500 atoms a week four weeks in a row for those "beautiful" power armors of the Horsemen ? Not me, at least.
---
Drop your prices or we'll be dropping nukes!
---
Happened to me too when I was level 31 O.o
---
not being able to use our pipboy sitting down is unimmersive.
---
I also don't see a reason, why we can't use the pipboy while sitting.
---
Well.. geee.... Now i feel bad for bringing this up in the first place. Thanks XD
---
I dunno man. Seeing how Bethesda made vendors sell all those rare plans for caps, don't think server hopping for a plan was an intended way of playing the game
---
THIS, the night is so bright..
---
I feel like I touched a nerve? XD Well, alright mate, you do as you like. Sorry if I upset you!
---
Absolutely. It doesn‚Äôt have to be pitch black, such as in DayZ, but dark enough that you need to put more thought into whether you‚Äôre heading out or playing it safe and chilling at a well-lit and defended camp. Have certain enemies that only come out at night, so there‚Äôs a reason you might want to chance it - perhaps they drop resources that are otherwise difficult to find. 
---
Personally I‚Äôd love it if they made the nights darker and we had more wendigos coming out. Though I doubt many others would like that!
---
It wasn't, but it was the unintended consequence of the fact that plans could be obtained that way.
---
I've seen plenty of shotgunners during the SBQ I call them the cripplers.
---
What is the big ass thing in the enclave bunker that the bots don't like you going near?
---
If you do feel that way, you're projecting pretty hard, mate.
---
As I was saying....
---
It‚Äôd be cool to have flooring tiles with dirt tops that allow must be placed in dirt items. Foundations to make a flat planting bed in rough terrain and floor tiles for that rooftop garden.
---
Wet paper is deeply offended by your comment.
---
He considers himself a reliable and durable material when compared to whatever laser weapons are made of.
---
The most time sucking event still gives crap rewards
---
Sometimes when you log in, you cannot fast travel to your own base, not even the option
---
VATS is screwed
---
Let's not even talk about fast traveling to someone else's base, screwed
---
enemies not taking damage, melee
---
HUGE CAMP issues
---
Events and challenges broken
---
The only priority bugs that get fixed are the ones that benefit the player...
---
OP Did you get this claw after the latest patch? 
---
I had every pet and 4/5 deathclaws but after the last patch, no tamable spawns at the usual spot( the bridge near treetops). I'm a bit ashamed to say i wasted 4 hours hopping there to no avail.
---
I'd like a new dclaw,since now they cannot be killed by players.
---
Nah theres not enough cheese for it to be a sheggy reference. They're both alice in wonderland references, though.
---
The game is running on a 15-year old engine and it's clearly affecting the performance. Similar engine issues were plaguing Arma 2 mods (DayZ in particular). As the engine is not exactly built for online it was "adapted" to perform.
---
Beth has only two choices - rebuild their engine (maybe even from scratch) to accommodate for the newer tech or lease another company's engine that is more modern to run their games on.
---
I appreciate the help.   It doesn‚Äôt seem to work as I go back and rechechk the corpses a little while after.  They often just disappear.   I suspect it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm using a tse Gatling and do massive damage which overrides the health regeneration for them.   Hard to say for sure but the quicker they go down the more often they seem to not drop loot for me
---
I get one shot by tse shotgunners from time to time "defending" my workshops.
---
Make Lemonade. I never see anyone selling it. Every time I put in in my vending machine it‚Äôs gone within the hour. 
---
You get the recipe from a random spawned Mr Handy Lemonade booth.
---
I mean, it'll probably be a PvP thing based on the audio files that have been found, killing ZAX may just be the 'ending' of it.
---
I‚Äôve read it somewhere recently that non explosive shotty does more damage than explosive ones. How are they since the patch?
---
What seems odd is that there always seems to be a full moon out at night.  
---
I can definitely tell when it is night, and it does seem to be about right  for a full moon. So i think it would be nice if over the course of a month the phase of the moon changed and the darkness level with it.
---
This basic understanding I got from skimming over OP is he is mad people want to play their way and not his way. Seems a bit ironic.
---
The placing of items was a way to give Basebuilders some more tools to create visually pleasing and immersive C.A.M.Ps instead these "looks like everyone elses" system we have right now. It' wasn't really thought of to be a honeypot for buglars and thieves and a way for everyone to place their expensive shit out for everyone to take.
---
The stealing part was meant to have the location being a lootable site like every place in Fallout 76, so if the buglar decided to rob another C.A.M.P, that person would run the risk of being wanted.   
---
Oh I agree with you 100% it should be instanced regardless of execution :) That way it would leave more wiggle room for scaling as you eloquently put it. :)
---
I can only think that this (along with many other parts for settlement building that haven‚Äôt transferred over from FO4 yet) is in the pipeline but being kept to a strict ‚Äòdrip-feed‚Äô release schedule. It‚Äôs minimum effort content that they can occasionally use to supplement the new stuff. Though given the current dissatisfaction with settlement building as a whole, that strategy could easily backfire.
---
What do you want from me? I'm a raider
---
‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù Yeah whatever Todd. They can come out with weekly and monthly updates to try and make the community happy, and they get loads of praise for it. But they have no time to research and fix the common core bugs, such as those mentioned by the OP plus more, that have been around since beta. Feels more like a shell game.
---
I suffered from the ultimate bug recently. Logged on after about a week of not playing. This was after the Purveyor patch dropped. Two characters were gone. A level 99 and a level 80 something. The game started me in the vault as a level 1. Checked the characters section and found nothing. Submitted a ticket to support and was eventually told that nothing could be done.
---
Last night cinched it when I was deconstructing the camp. Half the tiles and walls could not be selected to be modified or stored. It was as if they were static items in the game. Exiting build and even logging off and back on wouldn‚Äôt fix the issue. Only moving the camp would fix the issue. 
---
At that point I had enough and deinstalled. I‚Äôll go back to FO4. It sucks to do because I was enjoying the game despite all the toxic reviews. I was the guy asking other friends that enjoyed FO4 to buy 76. 90% of them are already gone. And they all say it‚Äôs because of the numerous bugs that have been around forever but never addressed.

BGS comes out with a highly anticipated game. They use a shitty, antiquated game engine. And we‚Äôre told ‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù My ass it just works. Fix your core problems and THEN come out with more content. 
---
Let the flaming and down votes commence.
---
The effects screen on the character tab
---
Nah, explosive shotguns got nerfed, hard
---
thanks mate
---
Sharing with other people by shooting them in the face?
---
Sounds like the introduction of the first NPC
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt a game be able to teach you something? Luck is an element yes but you can refine a method of farming legendaries then scrapping them or using the market to get good weapons that is all skill get out of here with those excuses that its all luck. There is an element of luck and skill to everything you do.
---
This is a multiplayer game not a single player game, They can built camps all they want but you should be able to be affected - why bother playing a multiplayer  open world game when players can‚Äôt affect you on a broad spectrum?
---
All right. What are the good weapons to work towards now? Energy weapons? Sniper rifles?
---
So. op. Two weeks on, what's your opinion about vending?
---
I was a shotgunner once.  It was back in the good old days, but those days have passed us up.  The damage vs range issue has  killed off the shotgun for me.  I can do more damage (with sneak bonus) but from a safe distance with a rifle build  or I can do the same distance with more damage with a melee build.  I still have my TSE pump and a hunter explosive double barrel.  I take them out switch up my perks fr and run through Morgantown airport reliving the glory days from time to time, but for the most part my shotgunning days are in the past.

If you are going to be eating your fancy food, why not run rejuvinated? Extra food buffs!
---
From Fallout lore wise...
---
The United States was 50 states until I believe 1969, in which it broke up into 13 Commonwealths.
---
So I'm guessing the army keeps the 50 stars and the Commonwealths keep the 13 stars.
---
That mode is in a terrible state for multiple reasons look at my last post
---
Yeah i saw juiceheads video with those audio files. There was something with zones, from which he guess it will be Battle royal mode, **or** it could be PvE boss mechanics. ZAX could send some robots, or mutants before final fight. 
---
PvP arena with PvE boss for winning group would be dope too.
---
That vault dweller from vault 51 is dead tho.
---
3 is part of the big misconception around the game‚Äôs graphics.
---
Reusing the textures is actually fine for the most part. What‚Äôs criminal is the lighting, and how it does nothing to alleviate the sameness. This is why so many ENBs are made for other Bethesda games.
---
The latest lighting bugs reveal this issue further.
---
Will destroy their camp and kill them
---
If I could toggle if an item can be "stolen" or not then I'd be for it. That way I can show off collections and rare items... or I can have a locked room as an "Try me" kind of fun moment, or leave put gifts. However instead of a police beacon... give me a robot for my base. Maybe a protectron so I can choose its personality... when I'm gome set it to construction to repair partially damaged items. When I'm gone set to law enforcement. Set it to medic for some passive healing. M
---
&gt;Reusing the textures is actually fine for the most part.
---
Not if you are building immersive C.A.M.Ps in Wasteland it wouldn't be likely that you could construct something and make it look 100% the same as the other thing you constructed :)  
---
You should have the option to do that ofc. but you should also have the options to spice things up instead.
---
Have no idea what you are talking about in the first section of your response I dont play wow never have.
---
Explain how this game is not based on legendaries and explain why its not the reason all the end game players have left yet?
---
‚îå( Õù¬∞ Õú ñÕ°¬∞)=Œµ/ÃµÕáÃøÃø/‚ÄôÃø‚ÄôÃø Ãø

Muah ha haaaaaaaa
---
But SBs drop such good loot! Why are you complaining? &lt;---sarcasm.
---
The first time I experienced it was around lvl 12. I was just getting ready to snipe the ghouls and hear the scream. So my first thought is to find the source of the scream, so I turn around and head back up over the hill and to my amazement as soon as I top the hill? TWO BIG RED GLOWING EYES!!!! Yes moth man at lvl 50 was following me to alpine cabins and I was scared shitless. I hid in one of the cabins and it started shaking. I fast traveled to my camp and consulted the wiki. Never been that scared before not gonna lie.
---
reminds me of the experience that sold me on the game, I did *Line in the Sand* at level 12 with a buddy who had  power armor. My laser pistol and I helped handle the scorched from the sides while he protected the generator from frontal attack and the AAA blasted apart the scorchbeast. I tagged it a few times, quickly realized i couldn‚Äôt even touch it, and retreated under the roof above the front door to avoid being slaughtered.
---
If only I could use any of that scorchbeast loot.
---
Thanks dude appreciate the love pity you get all these downvotes for speaking up against this hivemind
---
Still easy scrip.
---
Or they could just log out when they see they have their camp in the proposed nuke zone.
---
Survival is garbage check my other post
---
It's getting really balanced lately. Full health tanky rifleman builds are your best bet for meta. Every build is capable but minigun getting a huge buff would certainly make heavy weapons more viable.
---
still a win for me :)
---
That's one hell of a housewarming gift.
---
The explosive nerf made them normal guns, no longer just a spray gun, so you actually need to use the gun correctly.  I have actually swapped out my explosive for a vampires.  Still fun and effective for large groups.
---
I'm trying to replace three of my lvl 35 Handmades with lvl 45 variants (Executioner's, Troubleshooter's &amp; Zealot's). I rolled for 1\* ranged weapons to maximize Scrip usage; no luck, plus I had to wait another day to scrap them and ended up selling them to the Harper's Ferry vendor to be able to fast travel again.
---
The problem is the daily 150 scrip limit. If I sell the regular drops per day to be able to roll at the Purveyor, that's 6 probably unwanted ranged weapon. They'd scrap for 30 tokens the next day only...
---
How many caps do you ask for a bottle?
---
Thank you man.
---
I‚Äôm level 93 and my instigating combat shotgun has been serving me well since level 50 or so! I do swap out  to my Gatling laser with relevant perk cards sometimes, but I still love my shotgun.
---
I list it at the default. Think it‚Äôs somewhere between 5-15 caps. Not looking to bank on it. Nice to share it.
---
Survival is in a trash state atm for many reasons.
---
Why shouldnt a game be able to provide life lessons? If you spend too much time in some bs fantasy it begins to negatively effect you. Why not use games as an opportunity to grow as a person?
---
I agree the game needs to be more punishing but not necessarily through pvp. I do hate all the "I did something stupid, Bethesda needs to fix this" or "This easy thing needs to be made easier" posts. Possibly because I grew up gaming in the 80's when it was basically sadomasochism. The difficulty and danger level is way too low for my liking. I really hooe they don't fuck up the vault raids as they sound like they have a lot of potential.
---
is it like a prime where it uses ultracite fusion cores? or can you feed regulars through it?
---
Truth, no one can handle losing
---
Oh shit! Those suggestions are 100% better than mine! Nice one! :O :D
---
No I play on PC. But dev room should have been accessed on all platforms as it happened on accidental fast travel before people starrted intentioally glitching in. Xbox players might have spread it around less for some reason.
---
Which platform do you play on? If it's xbox I have tons of spices, pepper and salt you may have.
---
Uhm idk i don't think there's been a lot of change. Explosive energy guns are right in the now quite popular. Especially bloodied weapons. I'm playing with heavy weapons and melee and i like it very much
---
I tried for Ranged and actually got a few decent drops, best was an AAE Railway Rifle, but I have mainly been trying for good Armor and getting garbage, including wood armor on 50% of the drops. I did the 3\* Melee once and got a Tire Iron.
---
All total, I have only gotten 2 items worth Keeping or selling, and all the rest are going to the muncher.
---
For the last 4 patches, the ground across most of the map has just lost its shading and glows bright at night! It's so bright you can see the straight floor boundaries!
---
Got it. I‚Äôll keep this in mind!
---
Wait! You can actually get those!?
---
Travel to site alpha, follow the stream from there up river and find a spawn of fluffy, they are usually only level 15 or something. Lower it's health a bit. Then start shooting it with the bleedout mod
---
They broke the lighting engine in the process!
---
I have tons of recipes I can drop you also, if on Xbox.
---
No. Not until they fix the pipboy flashlight.
---
What kind of unbulkable junk is the most useless? I usually sell asbestos, but I‚Äôve held onto things like circuits, because I lose track of how much I need for crafting.
---
Probably wrong but since my luck hit 30+ I seem to find a hell of a lot more legendary enemies. Especially on the east side of the map, watoga up to harpers ferry.
---
I know the drops are random but from 600 hours of playing I definitely stumble on more since my luck got higher, even more so when I got my Unyielding armor set.
---
Yeah they do. The break in the timeline is just after the war (probably) 
---
Here's the link if you want it...
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_II
---
Hey inspired by your original ideas... combined with some civil insightful back and fourth got the brain juices flowing.
---
I've seen bot companions requested a lot and seeing as the bot station from fallout 4 is in the game would be awesome if they could give it to us as a station and let us have even 1 bot in our base that serves a purpose, or let us make monstrosity like in fallout 4.
---
One unrelated suggestion I would like to see is ability to trade our camp in for a personal vault. So instead of a camp in the open they could maybe have set points we can choose from to own small instanced vault, wouldn't matter if 2 people had the same entry point it would prompt you to enter yours or theirs. Could also set permissions if you don't want strangers to visit.
---
But maybe with an instanced vault we could have a higher budget and more space to build.
---
Visitor spawn is always in the same place. The direct center of your camp. Every visitor who is jot you or a teammate will spawn there. People have been putting radiation showers at that exact point so you have no choice. I basically spawn into the shower.
---
Dude I started playing this game again today and the same shit happened I was level 7 and somehow managed to kill them both with my pump action shotgun
---
I don't mind, it's the way it works... These lot want it all given to them on a plate, and when they don't get it they cry and get given what they want like spoilt little kids.
---
What risk there is basically none? Slowly becoming less by the day. Pacifist camp update? You cant destroy camps at all unless you are hostile full stop in all game modes.
---
Experience the game? What you call experiencing must be doing heart emotes and staring at a camp for 2 hours. RIVETING!!! 
---
You always had a choice. What YOU want is a safespace.
---
If you play to long you have to repair it
---
You can change the name of the item.  Im listing a railway rifle as TSE+1Agi
---
Yes, this is why you're an idiot if you place your camp at Whitesprings.
---
it's gear vs gear sure but when two players who know how to avoid vats go at it it's actually an intuitive fight.
---
Green hood looks amazing with the skull mask :)
---
There I agree with you. But I don't want any of that bull crap on my adventure mode. I play adventure mode to get into and read all the lore, build my giant base, relax and have FUN. 
---
 Now if they released a survival mode that had no map markers, unrestricted pvp, no leaderboards,  characters have to be created and locked to that mode, better revamped bounty system, only pve legendary modifiers on weapons/ armor (creates skill vs skill instead of gear vs gear), safe respawn points (you are a no skill scum spawn camper if this bothers you) then I would be all for it and play that mode instead of adventure. 
---
I won't step one toe in current "survival" mode.  I still laugh that is called that.
---
If you were in a loading screen when the nuke hit you, that has a chance of duping your loot bag!
---
Yes please.  I love how things look lit up at night time in games, but this game's "night" doesn't really allow us to explore that much :(
---
I don‚Äôt believe he can be anywhere else. Turn your flashlight on if it‚Äôs dark when you search, he‚Äôs hidden in near some bushes so it‚Äôs not easy to see even in light
---
Hmmmmm prices too high you say. .....
---
Could it be proposed that MODUS is just a rebranded zax, perhaps the prototype for John Henry Eden?
---
Had to look this up because the only arcade items I remember are the ski ball, wack a commie, and basketball mini games from Nuka world but it turns out they added freaking arcade cabinets to the creation club. They would be a cool addition however certain creation club items are made by modders so I don't know if bethesda made them or a modder did which could complicate them getting in.
---
Demo stacks with explosive?
---
Ceiling turrets too!
---
Only you can read your custom names. Other players cannot.
---
This ain't it chief
---
Agreed ! 
---
I lured a mutant hound to a lake with a behemoth in the water earlier today.... killed the hound and its corpse rolled into the water and disappeared... hours upon hours wasted on this single one challenge........and still can't get the 20 atoms.
---
I've been experiencing something this for months now on PC. Consuming an item hangs the game but the music still plays. I once finished Scorched Earth with max hunger and thirst as I was afraid to lose loot. I've reported it to Beth a long ago too but client stability hasn't improved lately.
---
Couldn't agree more, mods need to keep this stupid shit under control, it's taking over the sub
---
If your on PS4 we can compare recipes and you can have whatever I got that you need.
---
True, but its green. It kinda stands out when you've got grey armour
---
lol :)
---
I don‚Äôt remember this place...but I‚Äôm damn sure going there when I get home from work!  This sounds awesome!
---
Here's a REAL LIFE LESSON; don't be a dick, online or off.
---
Thank you so much
---
i heard that the visitor spot is in the spot you originally placed your camp device and the owner spot is 20 meters north of that. idk if it's true in general, but it's true in my case
---
This. Lure it through half of the map and then, if they not stop and just return on the long way to the pond, they dissapear! Awesome! Such fun. Just wow.
---
That‚Äôs copy-pasta material right there
---
I've found you can get all 3 level ups by just going up 1 level.   As long as the 3 of the requirements are met. I did this yesterday was in a clown suit, wielding an axe and was well rested. Still a bit tricky, but not as bad as 3 separate level ups.
---
because it just a game. I play games since 1985 and they surely changed my life in some way, but I doubt I've learned life lessons from them. Especially, I usually don't play multiplayer (previously played Diablo 3 for 15 seasons, but mostly solo and now F76 for 900+ hours, also 95% time solo).
---
Why bother playing games at all...period?
---
People play what they like, and how they like.
---
Some of the more successful multiplayer games were successful as they catered to what their player base wanted, which tends to be pve.
---
What if (now hear me out here....) people don't want to be affected by other players?
---
What if, with the limited time i have to play, i don't want to come home from a hard days work, and if i;m lucky to find some time to log in, find my base in ruin or my stuff gone etc.
---
What if, i want to play the game for the PVE aspect and have no interest in pvp aspects?
---
To turn your own question on you - why bother buying a clearly primarily PVE game if you crave PVP interactions?  Plenty of PVP only games out there.
---
As for games teaching you anything - again it's not a great idea to have a game teach anyone anything. The "lessons" as we shall call them are being crafted by who exactly and for what purpose? Interacting with people in the real world does not involve them threatening to rape your mother and screaming down the microphone -  In real life there are actual consequences for actions (like a flurry of punches should some muppet threaten my mum) so real life is where lessons are learned. 
---
Want to learn how to interact with people - best way to do that is to go outside and interact with people - not play a video game. 
---
The video game you can use the skill, but learning how to interact with people from a video will quickly get you in trouble in real life.
---
Everything worth learning is available to learn in real life. So why would bethesda modify a game of there from an enjoyable PVE focused environment that the vast majority of their base enjoys to something  else that might see quite a massive amount of players leaving and going to a game that meets their requirements.
---
Ultimately, you are in the minority, and game developers do not cater to a minority opinion - they listen to the majority. 
---
So again - don't worry about how or why everyone else is playing the game and enjoying themselves. If you truly do not like PVE based games, then move on to a PVP one. 
---
The vision for PVP aspects in this game have been clear since E3 before launch - limited PVP interactions that a player can choose to ignore if needs be.
---
The recent updates have simply bought the game more in line with that promise.
---
Fallout 2? ZAX
---
Yuppers,  That is where and how I got mine.
---
A three star rolling pin for like 32 caps....that's less then a cap per scrip! I'll take those all day.
---
Say good bye to all of your bullets
---
&gt;This is what happens when everyone gets a trophy.
---
Just so i am understanding you - in a world where everyone gets a trophy - people play PVE games? Or People do not play PVP games? Or people that bought a game for its PVE aspects do not want to play PVP? Or PVP players keep going into PVE worlds because PVP is too difficult for them when facing other PVP players?
---
Sorry......can't exactly figure out which one you are complaining about.
---
There‚Äôs nothing good about PvP players in this game - it‚Äôs not their skills that gets them wins, just their gear and builds.  Stop stroking fragile egos and I for one will be happy if PvP is fully removed from the game.
---
Some people just have no fucking filter and think that just because this sub is watched by devs, it is an invitation for them to post whatever shower thought they have about the game in a form of a demand. It makes me facepalm really.
---
I saw a guy this weekend selling the marine helmet (*the one you can craft super cheap) for 999c.
---
They were selling 1* items for 5000c.
---
I bet they sit there and wonder why nobody is buying from them.
---
Some folks deserve it. üòâ
---
New this week: BoS paints for your sickle!
---
Guys there‚Äôs a creeper near me. What do I do?!
---
Lure a supermutant from fallout 76 into sea of thieves. Take a picture of it with the kraken and a shark swimming upside down.
---
10 Atoms
---
 No its not survival.  Survival was watered down to the point of being trash you get chump change for kills and now camps are indestructible. I‚Äôm making this post to call for a change.
---
This post is about survival and adventure - this whole game heading towards anti pvp anti conflict anti fun.
---
I love how you jump to accusing me of being a hacker simply because i don‚Äôt hold your opinions.
---
I've been getting this a lot with mobs and my melee.
---
I stab them a few times before it actually does damager.
---
Just do what I do and maintain over 5000 bullets of every type, no need to worry about ammo if you are overstocked on ammo üëç
---
ALL THE TURRETS!
---
Even the big red ones at Poseidon!
---
Yeah it's super annoying
---
Maybe some base game weapon skins that dont require atom. Thats probably alot to ask though.
---
Stop being ungrateful. It‚Äôs half the adventure. 
---
It just works.
---
I like my executionors
---
On sale. Idk when it‚Äôs over though.
---
Heavy gunner cards?
---
It seems consistent with weapons that cross a certain threshold of damage. I'm starting to think it's a form of balance they put in on purpose. Very powerful weapons seem more succeptible to this, so that the player isn't 1-shotting everything
---
Agreed. I wish at least 1 of the dailies was something like kill 20 robots/radstags/ghouls etc. something that CAN be accomplished by the average player. My level 35 ass definitely wasn‚Äôt going to go get a picture naked in a nuked zone. Things like that should be some other category like ‚Äúrandom challenges‚Äù or something.
---
Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit: 
---
Legendary effects are gone.
---
Invisibility is gone
---
Vats is gone
---
Ah, so once the meta build is found (sneak build) , everyone will rock it and a Tesla gun.
---
Now survival is nothing but a Tesla fest and you don‚Äôt even need to aim anymore. Everyone and their mother is sneaking. Congrats, nothing has changed.
---
Trust me I would do more pve if it wasnt just : collect carrots, revive somone dead in water. PvE sucks atm nothing to do and it will be like that until wastlanders comes out. 
---
Until then PvP is the only thing interesting to me in this game.
---
Yes i got after patch and it took me about 2hrs sever hoping my spot is dent and Sons Construction when you spawn in there'll be a bloodbug head straight behind it jump over small fence and run into the clearing there will either spawn an event. one of the mr. Handy's, a random battle between super mutants and liberators on rare occasion a level 80 Sheepsquatch not tameable if you're really unlucky you'll the three scorchbeast spawn that's always fun
---
Get your Bloodied&amp;Unyielding melee build done guys, you'll never struggle again. A level 80 scorchbeast will die in two hits from my Power fist. One hit if I can sneak attack it coming out of the spawn point. You've just gotta hide for ten minutes until you hear the "thunk" sound when it lands...
---
No that doesn't make any sense. Sometimes i need 3 hits instead if just one that's ridiculous.
---
Lol, yup I keep seeing serums for 500-1500 caps they are super cheap to craft I sell for 250c so players can buy them and sell them to robot vendors for a profit. 1* legendaries shouldn't sell for more than 500c or less unless it's AA TS or instigating even those I sell for 750 because players keep buying them.
---
if they patch this next, i'm blaming you
---
About 50 ranged weapons, 23 prefix, 7 major and 9 minor effects to chose from. If there is no preferentiality, an uniform chance for a particular 3\* item with particular effects is 1 : (50\*23\*7\*9) = 1 : 72.450.
---
My first run yielded two Ghoul slayer's Combat Shotgun (1:1150) on the same server.
---
I've heard there is a 25% chance for a preferential drop, i.e., she picks a particular set of effects based on your inventory and drops a random weapon with the same effects. I don't know if this is true or not, but the regular drops do have a preferential factor based on stash/inventory contents.
---
Not sure how this has anything to do with crafting end game gear.  You can be level 5 and run through blast zones collecting plants and looting dead mobs, it's not that difficult.
---
  The OP was talking about crafting legendary weapons and armor not pieces of underwear.
---
To add tot this. I'm using a level 5 bloodied hunting rifle. Playing a sniper build. Literaly have not found anything better. The highest level rifle I can craft does 80 dmg and my bloodied level 5 does 119..
---
You must have a lot of free time.
---
 [Oh there actualy was ZAX in older games.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ZAX)I didn't play Fo1 and Fo2 (actualy i did, but i was kid and i was stuck somewhere on start), but i saw oxhorn gameplay and i don't remember there was ZAX. Fo3 i did play few times and don't remember any big computer too.
---
 I was talking about Master from Fo1.
---
that's exactly what my button sa...... I see what you did there
---
N0 I just figured the dragon fell under the black powder rifle category for the skin I have both lever action skins and there dope plus I use an anti armor explosive dragon and I love it for PvP
---
I mean, the walls come in blueprinted plans with the exact same dimensions on each wall... the wood walls are a bit inconsistent but still the same dimensions are followed.
---
The option to to spice things up is pointless, your character uses blueprints and plans to build things, why would he say ‚ÄúFuck this stable structure, I‚Äôm gonna make a wall out of road signs‚Äù
---
He's mad because he was able to grief and kill people to his heart's content on Survival but can't hang with the players on the PVP mode.
---
He wants to be the griefer, not the greifed.
---
I found if you don't try to reconnect right away you wont end up on the same world.
---
 I usually wait like 30 seconds or go get myself a drink or what not.
---
Fallout 4 is WAY more theme appropriate for that kind of thing
---
It's a 1 star, it ain't even worth that much.
---
Damnit
---
Where did i mention vats? While mechanical skill and aiming is part of the skill there is also game knowledge map knowledge approaching combat overal gameplan/ strategies room clearing etc but i do agree vats takes skill out of the game
---
Why cant you learn from games? People learn differently. School doesn‚Äôt teach life lessons it teaches you what 1+1 = 2. Interacting with ppl teaches life lessons that happens everywhere school, work, bars clubs, games.
---
I can, but I won't. Because in your multiple post, you preach about choice, but you don't want that particular choice the player base took. 
---
So why should I even bother?
---
[Don't worry.](https://media.giphy.com/media/tnYri4n2Frnig/giphy.gif)
---
True, true.
---
Yes thats another point - i mean there are 5 challenges per day. Why not make them:
---
1 low level
---
1 mid level
---
1 high level, endgame
---
1 or 2 random camera snaps (solo and opt. Team), drinking/brewing/ kill 10-20 (solo/team)
---
Each 10 Atoms and they're fine.
---
Pvp mode sucks atm you‚Äôd know if you played it. But you are clearly one of those people that conplains go to survival when you dont know anything about it and the pvp in this game.
---
üòÉüåàüëçüèª all sunshine and rainbows
---
it was üòä
---
This. Often i have to look at my pipboy clock to even know if it is night.
---
It doesnt need to be pitch black, but night should be noticeably darker than day.
---
I like how this game incorporates all its elements together no many games do this i dont want it to be so anti pvp
---
Where, in anything i said, did i call you a hacker???
---
Ok, so you want proper PVP survival - did i not say 
---
"So if you are referring to Survival mode - then i agree and have at it."
---
But why in gods name do you want to make the same changes to adventure mode?
---
Is it so you can grief people that don't want to pvp or are not able to take you on?
---
Does not getting all of this in a separate PVP server not satisfy you because you would be forced to play with players capable of fighting back?
---
PVP players and PVE players should be kept separate as they are in other games.
---
You want to play PVP - good for you - off you go.
---
For those that don't - thats what Adventure is for.
---
So by all means campaign away for as many changes as you like in survival - its a low populated game mode and always has been because most people who bought fallout 76 bought it to play PVE as it was advertised to primarily be.
---
What you are saying is that against everyone's wishes, you feel the developers should now change completely how they originally sold the game (pvp only if you want to) and now change it to something that makes the minority of their players happy?
---
And you can't see that having any problems no? You don't think masses of players would leave because they are being forced into a mode they don't want to play?
---
Again ill use Destiny - I have hundreds of hours on each game - yet i've barely played PVP on it - i bought it for PVE.
---
Rainbow six is where i invest time when i feel like some PVP.
---
So if the makers of Destiny turned around tomorrow and said going forward the open world is PVP, and if killed people can take your stuff (stuff i spent hours of my limited time acquiring) , i would just stop playing.
---
I would imagine a lot of people would - as that's not the game they bought.
---
Now as for as you are concerned - it seems to me that when you originally decided to buy Fallout 76, you accidentally read the game description for Rust, as thats the type of game you are describing. 
---
Also - i don't see how you think the developers are betraying the Fallout concept. Ever play any of the other fallout games? Ever die in one? Ever lose all of your stuff because you died?
---
In fallout, the enemy was the environment, not other players, so if anything,  doing what you suggest goes completely against what has been done in the past and is merely a copy of what rust is doing now.
---
Which brings me nearly to my final point - Fallout76 clearly is not for you.
---
Look how most people are dressed up in the game, and how they behave. And you wanna talk about immersion? Come on.
---
How much RAM does your machine have? What is your GPU load at these 30-45fps locations?
---
The game got bigger, about 12 GB more data since launch which could put an extra stress on your system trying to juggle that content. Also there could be a problem with terrain shading that may have performance implications (see the bright landscape bug, etc.)
---
Skins skins skins, brotherhood enclave raider. Different skins have different phrases like the others. Love it.!
---
Amen
---
Look in red toolboxes
---
Why not? Hit me up if you want. 
---
What level are you? Where would you want me? 
---
I have high and I have low.
---
We need to get [the pruld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3HPkXHxS_s) to animate this.
---
On Thursday before the purveyor arrived, I traveled there in anticipation of her opening shop soon (she did) and there were 3 lv 80 SB's and a horde of scorched. There was one other guy there as well, but it was still a pain. I recognized the area from when I attempted a Bots on Parade event there once and there were always SB around as well. I don't think it's unique (in my experience) to your situation, not that that makes it any better. LOL
---
It's probably a tie into Fallout3, there is a log in &gt;!the whitesprings bunker!&lt; between &gt;!MODUS and ZAX in Ravens Rock Pennsylvania!&lt;, &gt;!Thats the Zax's from fallout 3,!&lt; &gt;!It starts out as President Eden on the radio, but later on you meet "him" as an AI and you get to poison everyone in the wasteland. !&lt;
---
The question you should be asking is "Can we play music WITH our power armor?"
---
No only suckers would give up real money in favor of atoms
---
I was originally a shotgun build and didn't pay much attention to my perks. But, like you, I found myself getting completely destroyed by hordes as I couldn't reload quick enough.
---
I switched to a one handed melee + power armour build and I'm having lots of fun. I an sweep through hordes and don't need to worry about ammo/reloading. It's not for everyone though.
---

---
Ah first time playing a Bethesda game I see, that's part of the charm! Lol
---
Very lore friendly ofc! I remember in fallout 4, I explained my feelings to the raiders and they apologised and stopped shooting me.
---
Didn't take too many bullets -- maybe ~100 .50 cal for my sniper rifle.
---
Took a lot of junk spamming repair to keep my rocket turrets working.  :)
---
Pvp mode with the broken OP armors and weapons..  no ty that shit will get boring annoying very fast
---
A battleroyal mode  jesh dont we have enough games with that   
---
Hype no not at all 
---
More worried about state of the game with OP legendaries laying around
---
do you use non-auto perks or auto?
---
Isn‚Äôt ZAX the name of that computer from Fallout 1?
---
The very first time I took Red Rocket Station I got a Scorchbeast attack. The reason I remember this very fondly (besides the 'wtf' moment) is because of the craziest coincidence of Grahm walking by when it happened. He actually joined in the fight and helped my sorry ass take it down, although it still took about 15 minutes. At the time I didn't even know he was a vendor. lol...good times.
---
I swap between my furious double barrel and my 2 shot pump shotty
---
I have an AA Vats Crit with less AP cost handmade. It‚Äôs an awesome weapon, and I have the Commando perks and a Vats build to complement it.
---
I have a plain auto Tesla Rifle, and the grounded mutation with no class freak on, so I‚Äôm doing the full 50 percent less damage.
---
The plain Tesla wins in every circumstance because I don‚Äôt need to hit my invisible enemy. In fact, I don‚Äôt have to aim at all, and I‚Äôll kill people, and ignoring 45 percent of hits is pointless if some guy is holding the trigger on a Tesla gun, or any auto gun for that manner.
---
The Tesla needs a rework. The damage is fine, but the bullshit ‚Äúhit the ground hit the target‚Äù has got to go.
---
welp kinda figured the shills would get butthurt over facts,   calm down little children no need to throw a tantrum,   downvoting me because i stated actual facts cute
---
Probably not the prototype, given before the war John and Mordus actually communicated and mordus found his ‚Äúmalfunction‚Äù of being too curious about us presidents weird
---
Why do people run that build?
---
I think it would be awesome, but there would be a lot of people complaining that they died from starvation/thirst or getting killed while playing lol
---
You don't remember any large computer in Fallout 3? What do you call President Eden then, a calculator? :P
---
or even better, i'm just chilling in my C.A.M.P. crafting and repairing and I see a queen nuke. yippee! suit up and go. wonder why i'm not doing a lot of damage and i'm also taking a lot of damage. halfway through battle realize I still have on Super Duper (instead of all crits perks) Ammosmith (instead of Adrenaline) Happy Camper (instead of Tenderizer), Hard Bargain (instead of Lone Wanderer) I must have picked some locks somewhere I have 3 Locksmiths on instead of Rifleman, etc.
---
(yes i know about perk loadout manager mods but i'm weary of mods that mess this deep with the game)
---
That's pretty much how i'm reading it too. 
---
If he wanted a better PVP experience on the dedicated survival mode or some new mode then fine. But he doesn't seem content with that and seem to want to be able to greif anyone.
---
Take the Billings Homestead workshop, it has tons of razorgrain so you can build many, many fertilizer extractors/Brahmin pens.
---
Then get milking.
---
Every time. It's like Vegas. Odds are on the house.
---
You earn 12 caps for killing somone in survival it should be a  max of 100caps.  There is no risk to playing to survival cos a bunch of pussies couldn‚Äôt handle losing double caps.
---
The servers are dead thanks to these nerfs you clearly don‚Äôt play survival so why are you making comments about it?
---
When did i mention that i rely on op gear? Please quote me . Oh wait you can‚Äôt because you have to fabricate bs to fuel your argument.
---
And you bought a second copy of the game for this?
---
Even a Darker Nights 76 version is good enough.
---
You ever wonder why everyone and their mother puts their camp at whitesprings? Is it because we are all idiots except for you? No it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a super convenient place to camp and maybe like ONCE a month or less you might have to log out due to a nuke. So chill, there‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs the most camped in place in the game and not because we are all ‚Äúidiots‚Äù
---
In game where even shitty weapon kills you in two shots, you care about OP weapons? Cool, but yeah RPG based PvP is not for everyone. Also we don't know if it will be PvP or PvE thing. I belive it will be full PvE raid.
---
I truly think this is the only lesson worth learning.
---
Assets sometimes don't load. Fast travel away and then back.
---
16gb of ram, I will have to check load in a bit but it's running on a 1070 if that counts, I have noticed that bright terrain thing a lot...
---
I did even search google for images, i don't remember meeting that PC ever :D wow, is there way to avoid him and finish story anyway? :D
---
Sadly nobody can say the word pvp anymore.
---
You don‚Äôt want to listen to it because you want a safespace and can‚Äôt handle critism. Nice.
---
According to fallout wiki, yes it is.
---
Same issue happened to me like 3 times ... 4th run was such a success but all the efforts I've put into this just ruined by the corpse disappearing bug...I really hope they'll remove these kind of heavily luck /RNG based challenges such as  "take a camera photo of a Graham at a workshop". (but most likely they won't) Server hopping is not fun at all.
---
It looks way better, has pretty good DR and AFAIK is lighter than heavy combat armor^*.
---
Finding the mods is a real pain.
---
(* The online resources for FO76 armor stats are *shit*).
---
Did you know they nerfed TSE shotguns in the last patch?
---
Yes - as the game was sold to players - Previous fallout players who were not to excited about the nxt fallout title being a multiplier one. 
---
Players were told not to worry as they can simply ignore other players if they want to and do not have to worry about them.
---
That's the same game you bought to and you bought it knowing that.
---
" Experience the game? What you call experiencing must be doing heart emotes and staring at a camp for 2 hours. RIVETING!!! "
---
As opposed to what, spending two hours wandering around aimlessly until you come across someones camp so you can destroy it - oh wow how "RIVETING!!! "  I have clearly been playing the game all wrong this whole time.
---
I love using my croquet mallet and fatman! 
---
Jk I‚Äôve never equipped those weapon types ever.
---
Because low health is not that bad. I counter 95% if the risk with stealth and if I do get in a sticky situation I can heal with a vampire handmade. 
---
The benefits are sky high stats and increased damage. I get increased carry weight, accuracy, stealth, ap, criticals for that low health.
---
Nah. Love the shotgun.  
---
I switch between my sniper rifle, homemade, and combat shotgun depending on the range I'm engaging at.
---
How am I being a dick? Is the definition of being a dick voicing my opinion? I‚Äôve simply explained why I‚Äôm against the changes to this game.
---
Noooo! I can barely see at night on there as it is
---
It's a battle royal they datamined a bunch of data about a 'firestorm' circle that closes in. It's gonna be fo76 chasing the battle royal market with a pathetic 24 player mode. Which is hilarious and is going to be months worth of content releases that virtually no one is going to play.
---
1 stars are pretty much worthless, even someone looking for an Assassins gauntlet will pass yours over in favor of a 2 or 3 star. The best you can do with it is scrap it for scrip
---
I would def buy a Dr Disrespect weapon skin set...

But you do ;)

---
Clearly that's exactly the type of person he is - any thoughts as to why? Couldn't possibly be because he/she is a PVE player, thus doesn't play on survival mode.
---
Yet here you are - a PVP player who plays in adventure mode because survival is "broken" -  is Adventure mode not even more broken by your own standards, so as bad as survival mode is for you, i would imagine adventure mode is 10 times worse.
---
Yet you play in adventure mode - and complain that you can't destroy peoples camps - so that pretty much tells everyone the type of player you are.
---
Can't hack being beaten by superior pvp players on Survival and can't hack that you can't pick on people and destroy their camps and all that other "RIVETING!!!" stuff you like to do.
---
It could be PvE boss mechanics too. Same were used in world of warcraft for example. Which would be soooooooo great! 
---
There are only audio files about firestorm. It could be Battle royal, but we don't have solid proof, so there is still hope.
---
&gt; has all the updates
---
*Have* all the updates.
---
Pedants'r'us -- we never sleep.
---
(In answer to your question -- I, personally, never had a bad experience.  Some of the new things are fun, especially the Pioneer Scouts challenges).
---
Build skill and gear. So what makes you the guy who decides what is good in this game? The fact you dont like pvp? Ok then.
---
Same thing with Belly Of The Beast quest in BoS chain
---
Okay.. ITS ON DUDE ! Drop your nukes and i shall drop my pants !
---
 And i'm not even joking !
---
You are right - Schools do not really teach life lessons.
---
Life teaches life lessons - it's sort of self explanatory if you take a minute to think about it.
---
Well go back to club penguin then.
---
I didn't plan out my cards until I hit about 80. I'm still (159) figuring out what works best. It's become a pain when I have certain ones I keep equipped most times then have to change based on where I am going and what weapon I will likely use or when I need to reduce weight. 
---
I have a 1* quad shotgun (holds 36 rounds) but rarely use it. It's great for a 1* weapon, but I usually use rifles except when WS gets nuked. Then I switch over to melee (changing multiple cards around) because of AA and +dam. 
---
It's about time to start paying attention to what you want to do and build based on that. I'll sometimes level 4-5 times before actually doing any changes which helps when I need to "start" a new card and level it up all the way, or as much as I need to for what it will do for me.
---
Nailing down what type of weapon and armor setup you want to use primarily is the first step. Shotguns need to be close, and melee weapons often do more damage. (not always, but if you can't find anything better than a combat shotgun...)
---
Are we gonna get stronger armour and weapons soon? We don't get any stronger after lvl 50 but there are hoards of lvl 62+ enemies.
---
Yep, I figure without stealthboys theyd at least have a chance of keeping the tesla away though.
---
I use them, now I‚Äôm using sawed-off, but just because fashion 76.
---
At close range not only are melee weapons more effective, they also don‚Äôt need ammo.
---
but then he would have a monopoly
---
"The last shop in the nuke zone"
---
Nope, thats not how it works.
---
He knocks you out and puts you in a cart...
---
read the post again
---
I dont care about OP weapons and with legenday effects on armor  you can become unkillade by other players .
---
I got first hand exp with someone at 25% hp and 60 round of a tse minigun and the hp didnt even move .  imagine that with shitty weapon oh and they can kill you in one shot even with power armor .
---
If the raid is pve good but a mix pvp/pve mode in fallout 76 isnt going to work well.
---
Yeah my friend camps there hear the screams all the time. Didn't know wtf was going on until a girl we played with told us about it. I believe it's based off some haunted camp grounds in Virginia where some kids died.
---
I have a friend i made here, asking for help for a challenge. We do them all everyday in like 20 minutes.
---
100% agree about the tesla fest. Saw 3 players just jumping and spinning around while shooting. Not doing anything but hoping the sparks found their marks. Didn't seem fun nor skilful.
---
You there, you were trying to escape it too, weren't you?
---
I‚Äôm doing this, there‚Äôs no point trying to sell weapons that aren‚Äôt TSE.
---
Nearly the same (91 is when i started playing games) and can't really think of any life lessons i've learned.
---
I have developed the ability to know nearly immediately upon coming across a new person in game if they are the type of person i will end up muting.
---
Not really a life skill though as how people behave behind a mic on game and in real life are amazingly different.
---
^ You prove my point perfectly, by doing the same to others (go read your original post).  PvP players constantly shoving PvP down others throats.  We're not ruining the game - you are.
---
The perk card super duper effects making serums. Well, idk if they have fixed that or not but I used to mass craft a lot after a good whitesprings run. Would have 30+ of just one serum
---
Lmao ohh no my fake internet points. Show me on this doll where my question touched you.
---
Looks like it use normal fusion cores. Still to test it, but it show ammo same amount as i have normal cores.
---
Beware of the mod problem (that the OP was in effect complaining about).
---
1. You can't learn mods, you can only buy them from MODUS.
---
2. He only sells 3 mods at a time.
---
4. The interesting mods don't tell you whether they're for limbs or torso, so you end up having to buy 'em to try 'em.
---
5. Some mods are designed for arms or legs and so can't be applied because the armor pieces are marked "limb" not "arm" or "leg".
---
Other than that...
---
 Morning beautiful world  (sees 7 glowing deathclaws) dammit cletus you gave me the wrong shit
---
If they'd make it into a game, they'd have. 
---
Thanks everyone, this was Captain Obvious.
---
To go with the silver shroud commy wacker paint! Act now and you can get the same paint for your knuckles and Bowie knife! That 3 pack is only 3000 atoms and next week we will sell the same skins but now they are more purple and we will call them Mystriss of mystery! Look it has an M on it so um 3500 atoms! A steal!!!
---
Do you know if weightless can appear in 2 star items?
---
You got my full upvote to make dailies more reasonable - the one that require dragging mutant hound from Huntersville to behemoth pond is ridiculous. I've gave up after dragging that stupid dog out of town and he died on landmine. I'd rather spend that time to kill some monsters that trying to drag one monster to another for hundreds of meters - it's just not fun.
---
And that challenges that hangs unfinished since beta (location ones, SBQ kill etc.) - it's pathetic, that they can't fix it for so many patches...
---
I have it myself. Got it from a friend who got it from a guy who gave it to him randomly. Scrapped it and learned the plans. 
---
Use combat armor helmet.
---
Take as many enemies down as you can before you die a glorious death. See you in Valhalla!
---
Nuke me.
---
I‚Äôm down if you‚Äôre still interested. Psn is brm138
---
Sneak through the tunnels that lead you back to Lewisburg!‚Äô
---
I started playing in the beta and I think that actually messed my character up. E.g. there are 2-3 trophies I don‚Äôt have which I should (like getting out of the vault). And I never got a weapon as good as yours. Took me until about level 35 to get a 1 * ranged weapon that was useful.
---
Its hard to make ammo because it needs nuclear material. Never seems to be enough of it.
---
The true purveyor are players, grind caps, at least you can choose what to buy.
---
Fair enough...I can't argue that.
---
&gt;r have they are a low effort attempt to keep the player base engaged. If you enjoyed doing those scout challenges i dont kn
---
You have nothing left to do - thats good for you.
---
What about all the new players that continue to arrive to the game daily who do not find themself bored - we should what, allow you to run around and destroy their camps and what not because you are bored?  Try another game while you wait for new content like most others do.
---
If on PC, play rust. 
---
But forcing people into a game mode they don't want to play because you are bored and feel like wrecking their camps is hardly the way forward for this game. 
---
If people were interested in PVP - then the survival servers would have been pretty packed from the beginning - but they were so empty (i jumped on a few times in the beginning to get a feel for it).
---
Sorry but you are just going to have to accept that this isn't a game built to cater to PVP in any meaningful way.
---
I think the main thing that needs fixing pvp wise I basic balance.  All the armor and weapons are heavily optimized for pve where enemies have larger health pools and more DR. I would honestly love a game mode with harsher pvp but no legendaries.
---
"Not really a life skill though as how people behave behind a mic on game and in real life are amazingly different."
---
Couldn't agree more :)
---
Yeah, it's a huge turnoff because now I don't even bother checking them anymore.
---
How about simpler things like 'kill 25 robots with a shotgun' or 'kill 10 enemies with mines'?
---
I like the little whiiir BOOM at the end.
---
&gt;Nobody cares about about their survival score Bethesda.
---
Exactly!  Longest Life had good intentions (to discourage camping in one spot) but just turned successful questers and scavangers into easy targets.  Top 3 Killers on the map was great for seeing where the spawn campers were.  
---
The score is pointless.  Either give me a reason to care, or just get rid of map locations entirely.
---
Somehow I got so irradiated that I now have fur, and have the urge to say that I has wares
---
They kinda do. I had to mute someone the other day whose camp was right by WS station because he insisted on trying to beat box for anyone who was nearby. At least we have that option. (To mute idiots like this)
---
I had a 2nd copy since release. bought one for my sister but she never played.
---
It touched my plasma core
---
What the actual fuck are these vault dwellers willingly drinking? Like seriously
---
Is it worth it? I can find nuclear material but I'll be holding onto a heavy gun just for the queen. If it does good damage it'll be worth it but I'm unsure. I guess I could always try it and if I don't like it sell it. 
---
he's talking about MODUS, which is a ZAX super computer...
---
Sometimes, just sometimes, the pitch blackness is fun, however, that is a rare occurrence
---
I've seen that bug.
---
It was funny and enjoyable as fuck, and extended my playtime by ten hours.
---
My bad it is 25,000 but the rest still applies as far as i am aware.
---
Well maybe if your plasma core wasn't hanging out for the world to see.
---
I actually found it last night. Set aside some time and just server hopped Wavy Willard‚Äôs until it spawned.
---
My shotgun is my secondary weapon after my rifle. I use my shotgun mostly against supermutants and scorchbeasts, And when I‚Äôm outnumbered. I keep a fire axe as my backup weapon.
---
Enough energy resistance with grounded and scaly skin as-is.
---
This is me exactly with the exception of not having serendipity equipped due to super duper so I really need a poster next to the door as well saying ‚ÄúHave you changed your perk cards back‚Äù lol
---
If you‚Äôre having fun you‚Äôre doing it right.
---
Don‚Äôt rush to meta, meta ruins things because it robs you from the pleasure of testing and discovering.
---
For all your cuisine concerns  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food)
---
Raiders, soon.....
---
This was happening all weekend for me
---
Well..... it‚Äôs fun to shop!
---
Hey my eyes are up here
---
With my non prime furious Gatling and moderate enemy activity it takes an hour real time to go through one plasma core so if this holds with the prime receiver it should still be efficient enough despite the high crafting cost.
---
You can't trade them?
---
We've gotten a ton of people complaining about this, boo-hoo. I've stopped turning on the shower, but it's not my fault if Little Igor turns it on and leaves it on. What am I supposed to do about it? 
---
Jesus fucking Christ. Just grab a ton of dirty water from literally any lake.
---
You're acting incredibly entitled. We've gotten a ton of these threads already.
---
Absolutely agree.  Especially depending on location, it is far better to build up and have the ability to do rooftop planting.  I'm built right next to a small pond and the build area is ideally suited for that approach.
---
On a couple, but I guess I've just been lucky. I do have 8 luck, and have been happy with about 75% of my vendor 3 star legendary weapon rolls. 
---
Anyone out there that hated/loved them, what level is your luck?
---
Thank You, I'm definitely modding this weapon now that I know the cores last.
---
They then reversed it and it went back to how it was. I only noticed that because before hand I could go about my house in the night with no lights on and be find. Now it is like i'm stubbing my toe against a mini nuke.
---
As far as your build goes, I recommend embracing the idea of perk swapping. It‚Äôs a little annoying at first, but it will save you a ton of SPECIAL points. 
---
Specifically, I would drop luck by 3 (or 2 and max one gun army) and simply swap Can Do with Super Duper when you‚Äôre in your camp. Similarly, you can lower charisma and swap Happy Camper with something else when you‚Äôre on the move. As a chef, you‚Äôll be using some things constantly, like butchers bounty and green thumb. Swapping those all the time would be really annoying. But even the most crafting heavy build is going to spend large amounts of time looting and shooting, where those crafting perks are useless. 
---
And then there‚Äôs some perks you‚Äôre going for that just aren‚Äôt very good. Quack Surgeon is fun and fits with your build, but the animation takes much longer than a normal stim, and stimpaks are extremely easy to craft. I‚Äôd only recommend Quack Surgeon if you‚Äôre always playing with someone who dies a lot. Otherwise just carry a few stims.
---
I also hear that philanthropist/anti-epidemic style perks have super short range. And Friendly Fire is pretty niche. Your build seems very focused on a group dynamic. If you don‚Äôt have a group that you‚Äôll be playing with, I‚Äôd drop charisma by a lot and put those points elsewhere. 5 intelligence would be pretty valuable to have, so you can mod your own weapons and make them last longer before they break. But if you do have a group, those perks should be fun.
---
Finally, you don‚Äôt actually need the endurance perks to make food/drink more beneficial. Since you have Thru-Hiker, you can just carry huge stacks of Salisbury Steak and purified water to satisfy most of your needs, and then top yourself off with the really good food. Obviously this is kind of a personal preference thing, but I have a similar build (chemist here), and I never run out of food/water.
---
Few days ago to smart traders decided to go afk with there bases in White Springs .... in nuke season !!
---
Oh i lose just fine - on dedicated PVP games where people can't go on Ebay to buy the best weapons and armor or dupe them with their buddies and are instead forced to fight me on a level playing field. 
---
In those circumstances i have no problem losing at all, and funnily enough, also no problem winning too.
---
So i circle back once again - here we are on a game that was marketed and sold as primarily PVE with limited PVP interactions and here you are, playing fallout instead of something more PVP oriented, and playing ADVENTURE MODE wanting to destroy people's camps instead of playing in survival mode, which as you put it is shite right now, but its still better suited to you than adventure mode no?
---
How do you currently pass your time in adventure mode with no camps to destroy or low levels/low geared players to kill to feel better about yourself? Jump to different workshops and grief those is my guess. RIVETING!!!
---
i broke down and finally just made a list. "Queen Checklist" perk cards, food, drinks, chems, heavy weapons, AMMO FOR the heavy weapons, etc.
---
Have you ever played rust? Trust me you don't want this.
---
Might actually spends some caps on this.
---
Wahh, I can't grief efficiently anymore. All I wanted was to stomp on everyone's sand castles and be a bad guy.
---
I always just play/defend the jukebox while in my PA.  Works like a charm, though you may have to repair it a time or two.
---
They're just digging themselves a deeper hole. Bethesda us all rdy on my shit list I enjoy the game more now with player vending but it doesn't excuse all these poor choices made to gameplay for the sake of grind and atom store sales. Never spending $$$ on atoms idc care wtf they put on that friggin store.
---
I really wish we could help him as part of some hidden side quest. Perhaps he would tell his other comrades about the sheepsquache and the human who helped him. Then every day you could do a daily to help a small squad of super mutants and him track down and kill another sheepsquache. Maybe there could be a comment from them saying "Maybe not all stupid humans are weak, maybe..." or "You sure human isn't super mutant?". Something along those lines. If anything it would add some more liveliness to the world and plus some interesting experiences.
---
In scorchbeast queen fights, it'll probably chip of noticeable chunks of health. Bloodied instead of Furious here, though, and I can do 170 damage without Nerd Rage at very low health. Per bullet. With gatling plasma. Nuclear material is hard to find though.
---
Current objective: survive
---
You can trade the plans but not the clothing
---
It's awesome your doing a chef build. I haven't tried crafting recipes to sell the quick spoilage worries me. I sell a shit ton of dog food at my camp though. Everytime I restock it it's gone pretty quickly.
---
Interesting
---
I am not asking people to not have rad showers. I am not even asking people to not put them in their doorway. Nor am I asking that you keep them off. All I am asking is that people not put them at the exact center of their camp where I am spawned directly into it.
---
Apparently I need to edit my post so that comes through.

She's the leader of the Railroad. Pretty important character.

Damn that's good damage. I'm trying to figure out a way to fight the queen and be more useful than the guy who waits for her to land so I can hit her with a Supersledge. Very helpful thanks
---
Honestly just change .308 rounds to have bulk crafting like 5mm and .50, the only other thing that uses it is the hunting rifle, and it already shares this quirk with the .50 rounds.
---
üòÇ
---
Hit damn thats awesone.
---
I remember in the good ole days my shot gun did 1100 and gaus did 1200.
---
You really goddamn diddly-doddly should.
---
It‚Äôs the only safe thing to do tbh lol
---
I‚Äôm interested
---
*"I missed school because you had to be there at 9 AM!"*
---
Once I finish creating some good ideas I will let you know and we can build this thing.
---
I found the same to be generally true while server hopping.  The faster I server hopped, it seemed, the more likely I was to end up on the same server.  Usually evident by me actually finding the same random spawn even, with bags/containers that were already looted (by me, the previous hop).  Or something like the un-exploded bomb already being blown up.
---
Glad I wasn't the only one.
---
"Hello children"
---
Holy crap what on esrth did you buy?
---

---
Happens to me also. I basically have to be pushing up against the enemy to make contact. Like my range is next to nothing even though it looks like my sledge has reach
---
Im a plan vendor, i buy  super cheap plans and sell them for a higher price. It somehow works. I also have a ton of random weapons and armor. Its nice.
---
Handmade. 
---
Yes, the lever has higher damage output, but misses a lot at point blank range and not everyone can affort a VATS build, yet alone pull of more than 2-3 shots with a typical AP pool.
---
Wrong sub?
---
Yeah exactly
---
That's a godsend. You could say there's nothing fun and exciting to do when you reach higher levels. But wait, just saying those words gets you downvoted near-instantly. You still uninstalled though. Bad. It affects only a small part of the community, and with high level characters it's technically an useful bug.
---
It seems the effort has DRIVEN you slightly MAD.
---
I use a combat shotgun in areas where enemies are close. A sniper rifle everywhere else.
---
i remember trying to chase the screams down but it kept sending me to every corner of the location.  thought I was going crazy.  Definitely one of the cooler additions to Appalachia!
---
You are just going to have to get a pic and literally put it right next to screen to compare. 
---
If you seriously want to get it perfect, the overcomplicated way is to find a facial picture that you can print out on a piece of paper that would be pretty much the exact size scale as the screen (this is the hard part)  Than you cut it right strait up and down the middle so that you only have half a face (left or right really doesnt matter) . Than you literally tape it right to your screen to compare/match the original. 
---
This isn't particularly easy though. I would just find the closest vanilla model and tweak it where it needs it. Won't be perfect but is that really all that important?
---
Earlier you said i called you a hacker - yet still have not pointed out when or where i had said that - hypocrite much? 
---
Clearly he doesn't play PVP much - he clearly enjoys PVE - so stop telling him and others how to play it or how it should be.
---
Servers were dead long before those nerfs - in fact, those nerfs were brought in to encourage people to try out survival due to low server populations on survival mode. 
---
Didn't really help though - well it did i guess for the first few days - i noticed more activity going on when i jumped in - but alas people went back to doing what they wanted to do, which wasn't PVP.
---
Why don't you play Rust? Like seriously?
---
A full core lasts a very long time, and especially with a furious one it should work out fine. The thing is the gatling plasma doesn't have a receiver upgrade so making it prime will increase damage against everything, not just the queen. Feels worth it, I'd prime my own if I had a way of using up all the regular cores I find
---
&gt; The other is Tanagra town on top in a bathtub.
---
Fuck that bathtub.
---
Heyyyy, man. If you're on PS4 I have a shop full of 3 star weapons. Could definitely hook you up with some deals
---
Someone needs to do this, this is hilarious
---
Assumes player is not currently in a relationship.
---
The nuke countdown is like 2 mins... Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but surely it couldn't have hurt to wait?
---
As appropriate: rifleman for the lever, commando for the handmade.
---
Unfortunately they have been tinkering with VATS so much that crits in auto are not what they used to be but I still keep the crit setup for auto though.
---
In fact VATS is fairly broken right now, specially for melee but that is another story and I rather not have another 'hurr-durr git gud and learn to aim' kind of 'conversation'.
---
Saw him once outside Charleston, across the lake and road from the station (east?)
---
Oh yeah, forgot about the that.
---
Try an ENB maybe ?
---
Heathen!  You don't kill the wise Mothman!
---
Even Enclave members know that.
---
Thats how me and my buds have been 'breaking' in for ages. If someone is at their camp  they get so confused. Its great.
---
As soon. As you said cabins k was like ‚Äúlet me guess....‚Äù yeah man I was scared shitless too
---
Yes, my friend lost his yesterday.
---
I think that's one of the coolest area's in the game. I don't think there's anything story related there per say (it does have it's own little story, you'll have to gather the courage to discover it).   
---
I found it similar to how you found it and used it to freak out several friends that hadn't found the place. I too was genuinely freaked out. It seemed normal at first, killed the ghouls and then started exploring. I thought it was odd that the doors closed on their own, but I had seen that happen before in the game (lag) and then the pictures started spinning, followed by the scream and the earthquakes. I booked it out of there too. Such a great memory.
---
Not really. Take the AngryJoe review and see how much can you cross off from all the flaws he pointed out. Not much, because even after Beth fixing bugs for almost a half a year, you still run into bugs in all play sessions...But bug, I wouldn't rube into their face.... 
---
Because worst part is that none of the updates has brought anything to endgame. First we got parade, we got from there what? Nothing. I have never seen or heard someone missing parade event, because it had some cool rewards or it had something valuable. No one. Then we got alcohol and we got from there what? Nothing. Even the recipe (firecracker) that lighted your enemies on fire, got stripped and that was something that was heavily featured in previews and you could say it had some value. After that we got encrypted and it brought exactly what? The Fixer, that doesn't even come close to TSE, 2 events that reward you some boring melee weapon that I never seen being wielded anyone. Then we got vending and backpacks. Vending half broken (inspection bug) and never have I bought anything from it, that I could say "thanks! vending". Maybe there is player who is selling things that I would need but I am never gonna make to that vending machine, because of the RnG. Backpacks just a boost to inventory space. I'd understood pioneer brought us a bow (as bow was in files and there were archery challenges), atleast then I could say pioneers brought something interesting, but no. Then we got purveyor. Sure some won with it, but most lost. By the time I win something good from it, the StarCitizen has been released. Then there was camera somewhere between, that also brought 0 value. Sometimes it doesn't even work properly, so to use it, you first kill the monster and then take photo of dead body. Burrows, dungeon with zero reason to do it. 
---
So as you can see, none of the content that came was "Ohh, I got now new reason to play F76". At one point it was good to see, that they are lowering needs to server hopping by giving vendors all the plans, but then they brought vending, that is basically server hopping all over again, if you have TSE weapon.  And then there is possum badges, that is pure server hopping promoter- You can do these one time challenges that takes time or you can server hop till you find server that has specific event and do these events till you have enough badges.
---
I agree, The Unstoppable Monster will be Crazy OP it's nice to see a good reward from Survival. It will also drop the prices of Bloodied (well most) DG's because everyone will have an OP one.
---
Sadly I'm on Xbox with few caps
---
Just do Enclave. Easy, and is an easy excuse to kill on sight.
---
I'm off to r/eyebleach
---
Make the night darker and the lights brighter.
---
Is it assassins plus SS plus +1 strength (3 star), or is it an assassins with SS (2 star)?
---
you right
---
I think calling people pussies is a good start...
---
Great info, thanks. Just got a zealots version and was debating selling or saving for queen fights
---
I used to do that a lot.  The problem for me is that I'm rifle spec'd, and not quite prepared for the inevitable surprise scorched/snallygaster/deathclaw that gets in my face and I end up blowing myself up by reacting too quick and eating my own explosion.
---
I meant to get the dense chest mod, but since I hardly ever use the shotty, it's always an afterthought as I'm running to pick up my paper bag :P
---
This would be awesome... Also, an app for our phones that allows us to play holotape games :D
---
No. Turn your brightness down. Some of us appreciate being able to see it our hands in front of us. I love you but when devs make night time "dark" they dont make it Dark, they make you blind
---
Yea i did that all the time works like a charm
---
I saw the plans last night at a player vendor for 500c I'm regretting not buying it I didn't realize the damage increase will be against everything that's good to know thanks
---
Another tip for console players (or at least Xbox...assuming it would also work on PS):  if your photo gallery is full you can still snap the pic without deleting any of them.  The pic, of course, won't save but you'll still get credit for completing the task.
---
The "R" in RNG stands for RANDOM.
---
Not sure about plasma cores but I had some fun with an Ultracite Gatling Laser recently. I burned through 20 cores yet I'm still over a hundred pieces. Turns out the weapon does not deplete the cores thus I had 20 1% cores in my inventory. My PA eventually ate them up but still, it is a ton of weight without Batteries Included perk.
---
I still use TSE Combat shotgun, Gatling gun and handmade
---
did you know that the expression "here be dragons" comes from ancient times when map makers and such often would envisage distant undiscovered lands as teeming with creatures from tales and fables? they would paint dragons and the like on the map. it's an anachronistic expression, first recorded use in 1570 AD, in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, a work considered to be the first true modern atlas.
---
1. yay! they balanced it so people will bring non low level toons in just to exp farm to 50? losing 400 caps and only earning 60 a kill sure was fun to people using their mains /s
---
2. the servers have been more populated now because of the change, and there are higher levels now causing more challenging pvp encounters. the servers are no longer 3 high level maxed out people and a ton of new toons just there for bonus exp
---
3.
---
Well then guess what, I'm already well on my way with it. I made a new character, and I'm at level 20+ now, I have a handful of bash DMG legendary lvl 50 weapons to test out with. I so far confirmed that it's not effective against sentry bots with no perks
---
I haven't tried the CC for FO4, but There is a mod for FO4 that add Arcade cabinet which are computers with the holotape games stuck in, and the computers are decorated with appropriately-themed stickers :
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10597](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10597)
---
Technically, but good luck!
---
Does the weapon have the *+250 DR while reloading effect*? There is currently a bug with it that negates bloodied/adrenal reaction effects.
---
I love the one I got. I'm maxed charisma build with medic perks and radicool, ghoulish, etc for my group. When the Purveyor released, first weapon was a Medics Ultracite Gatling laser, I think with faster reload, and can't remember the other trait. But its pretty good, I don't have prime receiver yet  or a few other mods to make it better, but I enjoy it the way it is currently. Just need to collect more fusion cores (recently stopped using power armor so stopped collecting till I got that gun xD.)
---
The human mind is extremely good at spotting patterns.  One unfortunate side effect of this is the tendency to see patterns even where they don't exist, faces in clouds, astrology, "hot servers" in FO76.
---
But you seem to miss the fact that it doesn't matter what you want ultimately - the game was advertised and sold as a PVE game with minor PVP aspects should a player choose to partake.
---
It's been anti PVP from the start as Fallout has always been an adventure a player can take at their own pace as they see fit. 
---
You are saying they should go against the very reason people bought the game and throw them into situations they have no interest in being in - and you think what - the game will be a massive success? 
---
You don't think the servers will end up as empty as the PVP ones are now.
---
You think players leaving en mass would be good for the game? 
---
RUST man - go play rust.
---
Rust has all the same aspects as Fallout - only its a proper survival game. Even when you log out your character and camp remain and you can wake up to find all your stuff gone. It sounds perfect for you.
---
Its having some success, because it is upfront with the type of game it is.
---
If tomorrow they announced they were changing to a PVE only game, there would be outrage and refunds would be demanded by everyone. Place would be dead within a week.
---
You don't seem to be able to grasp these concepts though. When i read your posts i hear this whining child upset that he can't wreck a level 10's camp so he can feel better about himself.
---
See? sbq downvoted my unfair advantage :(
---
What ingredients do Ultracite Fusion Cores need? I don't have the plans, and I can't find them by googling.
---
Medic is a very situational roll, the explosive is great on everything (with exception of the Tesla rifle). If you are specked rifle I would not switch for an explosives medic pistol, I would, however, use it as my backup sidearm for when my rifle breaks / or if I am conserving ammo. Depending on level and if it has a 3rd star I would see it sell around 500 caps
---
You are complaining that you can't wreck other peoples camps - sort of a dickish thing to want to do and certainly a dickish thing to complain about that you can't do.
---
That sound also plays sometimes when you're selling legendary gear to a vendor, it's startling lol
---
Super mutant style or are you asking whether I belong to Parsons?
---
Yes, how I imagined this is wonderful!
---
500 scrip worth of wood armor is a bigger issue IMO...
---
I was about lvl 100 when I finally stumbled onto that place. At a time when I was not really afraid of anything in the game anymore I was genuinely *creeped out*.
---
Well yes. But keep in mind that some of the Countdown already passed before I even REALISED that my camp was at ground Zero. And this was the first time I got shunted back to the same Server i just left. So the thought that a Little bit of waiting-time might be warranted didnt even cross my mind.
---
The only thing i realy curse in hindsight is the fact that I didnt think about taking a photo of the nuke as it came barreling towards me XD
---
Nice I got a bloodied ultracite gauss rifle from player vending for the hefty sum of 250 caps now I just need some ammo
---
&gt;So what makes you the guy who decides what is good in this game?
---
Ahahahahhha
---
The level up challenges became much easier once I realized it could be done with a single level. Now I just check the requirements when I log in and wear whatever the necessary outfit is until I level up. Yesterday I got lucky because I forgot about it but I just happened to be diseased and well fed when I leveled up.
---
Yeah for sure, I hate when my turrets can't aim straight down. I think wall turrets can target things from any angle?
---
We need more styles of vendor, they all do the same thing but the look different.
---
The first time I was there was because was meeting someone for a trade at their camp. I was so creeped out. How can you hang out in your camp?? It really put me on edge. 
---
I have a nice sunny spot in the woods with a view and just an animal spawn nearby.
---
You can also go to the spawn it shows for bloatflys in the bug spray tadpole quest and kill the honeybeasts that come out of the cave, they also drop some and they respawn / you can server hop to get it.
---
It also spawns at Middle Mountain Cabins in a picnic basket next to a grave.
---
Yeah, I mean, fuck the opinions of potential customers with disposable income. Games doing great, right?
---
Yeah. Sure it is.
---
With customers this gullible it's no wonder this industry has gone to shit.
---
Don't get me started. I sell cameras to those that have lost or accidentally sold, what have you, their original. So I grinded out 5 Possum badges for the night vision lens thinking it would be a nice addition to add to the mix only to find it's none tradable. 
---
Rubbish.
---
Any bloody pipe revolvers?
---
I‚Äôm not sure the word ‚Äòneed‚Äô means what you think it means.
---
You, not the only one I've got a shotgun+marsupial  build mainly in survival mode at the second mainly I bounce up to things and blow their head off with the good old double barrel and then bounce off while reloading in the air ready for the next time I hit the ground.
---
The issue with shotguns is the range you need a reliable way of closing the distance it also helps if you can use that same way of getting close to taking unexpected routes, to go along rooftops and drop on people or even just haul ass over the mountains when you are on the losing side of a firefight and marsupial  is a great way of increasing your mobility options.
---
I've been doing some casual testing with the gatling plasma since /u/mylkoo's massive post about TSE Heavies about a month ago, but without the explosive affix, I haven't been impressed with the damage of the beam splitter mod variant. I suspect there's something to the way explosive and the beam splitter mod interact.   
---
He made supportive comments about using the primed receiver for the SBQ:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu6va/massive\_test\_of\_tse\_heavy\_ts\_explosive\_weapons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu6va/massive_test_of_tse_heavy_ts_explosive_weapons/)

---
This is the build I use. I can solo the SBQ if no one else shows up which is rare but I‚Äôve done it. My weapons are BE 50 cal, BE Gatling and BE LMG.  I keep 3 into perception for lock picking the silos for easy runs.  When I‚Äôm not doing silos I‚Äôll do some combination of glow sight or exterminator.  Nerd Rage and Lone Wander Perk doesn‚Äôt stack with Action boy.  If you need any clarification on why I picked what let me know.
---
I don't know if I'm the only one but I already struggle to see what I'm doing the way it is now. I'm not sure if that's because of the light of the pipboy or the darkness of the night though.
---
updated the post.  
---
materials needed for ultracite power core (1200 rounds)  
---
1 Violet Flux  
---
1 Ultracite  
---
1 Power Core  
---
Its rough 0.1 caps p/ 1 round
---
They‚Äôre already in the game...why can‚Äôt we have them?!
---
I‚Äôm saying there should be risk in any game mode even if its small. The changes i agree with and suggest are in my previous post - my suggestions give pacifist players a way out but also doesn‚Äôt stomp on pvp players. I like this game because its somewhere in between rust which i have played but simply don‚Äôt have the time for and something thats not a pure survival game. Its also fallout and i love the series.
---
I never claimed you should lose all your stuff junk and aid is fine for me... the cap loss is far to low and like ive said survival is a joke because of this and the camp immortality.
---
You should be able to be robbed in a game thats a survival game which is why im against pvp being removed in adventure and i rob people in both game modes.
---
The game is still a hot mess. However, you should be able to play at your pace and have your own fun. Your base is now invulnerable to other players unless you are in PVP with them. So as long as you turn on pacifist mode in the game settings you should be fine. 
---
With the introduction of the legendary vendor and player vending it is easier to get gear and a good bit more social.
---
109 damage with commando perks then about what you're getting when nerd rage kicks in. You have tendereizer in carisma and also similar one in luck called bloody mess
---
I'm lvl 150 and I've only been by that museum and area only ONCE! SERIOUSLY! I haven't experienced that yet but thanks for the heads up
---
I really recommend you to prime it and use for SBQ runs. Saves a lot of money and ill do a lot of DPS
---
What a fun thread - very easy to spot all the buthurt greifers - or former griefers for the most part now.
---
Plenty of new players still coming in. A lot of there higher level players usually flock to the same High Level areas and stay there for the most part. You will not have a problem just enjoying the grind in peace.
---
nice! Farm Whitesprings robots for cores :D
---
It's awesome, I lucked out back when energy weapons were garbage and the Gatling plasma triple so and got a Furious Explosive one. I primed it and use it during the scorch queen, you can easily watch her health tick down as you sustain fire. I also have 5 other Gatling plasmas I switch between and I save the low-level cores to turn into ultracite as a way to recycle those low-level cores they give us when we reload/spawn in.
---
Not sure why either of us are being downvoted... I heard this place didn‚Äôt take kindly to criticism of this game, but you trying to help grow the community and me stating simply that I ‚Äújust wasn‚Äôt feeling it.‚Äù Is merit enough to feel we can‚Äôt contribute to this threads conversation. Whatever. 
---
Anyways, thank you. I‚Äôve been meaning to give it a try, but with what little downtime I have, I‚Äôve been decided on sure fire games I know I‚Äôll enjoy rather than taking a gamble on a game that has yet to grab me. I‚Äôll give it another look soon.
---
&gt; Does launching a nuke at the queen kill her
---
No. They made her immune to nukes a couple of patches ago.
---
&gt; spawned another 
---
I just got an explosive combat shotgun from the legendary vender it is ok but I have been loving my bloodied hand made rifle.
---
Heavy.  Poor ammo capacity (10 rounds in a perforating mag).
---
Turn off pvp and avoid nuke zones and you'll be fine!
---
I've had very few issues. I think, even if a game is buggy, not the prettiest, or whatever... as long as you're having fun with it, it's worth your time, and there's a lot of fun to be had here!
---
You can play pve all you want im stop stopping you from doing your playstyle. So again explain how this game is not based on legendaries and expain how im stopping people from doing their playstyle? If you can‚Äôt ill assume you have no arugment.
---
Nice Thanks mine isn't explosive but it should work well.
---
TIL Skyrim takes place deep in the Appalachia
---
I love these encounters... I ran into a Mr Gutsy crying out for help, only to find out he was looking for someone to rob once you got closer to him.
---
lol good name
---
Not to bad
---
Some salty people programmed bots to downvote literally every post made on this Reddit XD
---
Tbh completely forgot about that place for cores. Lmao.
---
Honestly, it's pretty fun to solo, just expect such a story based game like previous entries, there is a story but its more about context clues and environmental storytelling. Have a quick look here and see if any of the new additions temp you:

At least in Fo76 players can use modern lighting and hide in their homes.

Yep, I sold about a dozen cultist outfits the day that "take a camera picture with a Mothman and a player in cultist clothes" daily was active recently.
---
UNTIL YOU FIX YOUR MERCH WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON, NO ONES HAPPY
---
It never was in a vanilla Bethesda game
---
Yes, it has improved 1000% since launch with new content added fairly regularly. PvP is completely optional. I also recommend checking out r/FilthyCasuals
---
That sounds like a nice title for an post-apocalyptic disastermovie :P
---
How do you sell them? I tried trading, vending and dropping as well as container placement. None of those worked. I wanted to help a fellow player.
---
I mean there's the whole Dunwich Horror demon thing
---
This is good
---
"When the student is ready," etc. etc. ...
---
Three star trash weapons are regularly in player vending machines for 500-800 caps, so that's a potential minimum price range at which someone might buy it to scrap it.
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
Level 26. Wow - good on ya, man!!! I'm in the 70's and still hate that cave! Even without a wendigo, those damned mirelurks are vicious.

Drum Mag, Tank Killer, versus legendary (or AA).
---
Being able to do anything while sitting would be fantastic... simulate eating food off a table, picking your nose, opening the pip-boy, all the things you had mentioned... I feel like sitting serves no purpose right now.

Yeah within seconds of posting I was downvoted lol. I was figuring either bots or some holier than thou type who already knew the answer and figured everyone else should know the answer and downvoted because in thier opinion it was a dumb question. Luckily it's just fake internet points

I also reccomend you check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals.

I've traded two so far with no issues. But only to those who have already found the tourist
---
I‚Äôm on xbox too, what level are you
---
If you're talking about armor, then *yes*, as *Weightless* is the *first* legendary effect. It appears in 1,2 and 3 star armor pieces.
---
If you mean *weight reduction* on weapons, then *no*, because it is the *third* legendary effect. eg. bloodied / swingspeed / 90% weight reduction supersledge
---
Yes I have a lot of them
---
super mutant style
---
Its plenty dark enough, especially for pvp. You try seeing a player in chameleon as is let alone having it darker...
---
I did this quest yesterday. I purposely waited until I was in the level 40s before doing it, cuz I'm a bit of a coward (bit of a cakewalk at level 46). Good on you for tackling it so early. I'm just a bit stunned that the reward for it was so meager. I think I ended up with a metal leg and a gas mask. Jeez, thanks Rose. You really shouldn't have.
---
What is it good for?
---
Ah, I gotcha. Misunderstood. I was about to call you out for BS on that. Glad I didn't lol. Guess I'll have to keep doing the event as I only got aid when I did it yesterday.
---
I like West tek runs. I collect/scrap everything, my base is NW of there, so I slow walk from West tek, to the National Array satellite, which usually has more super mutants (and a decent chance at another legendary), and then to my base to scrap/bulk.
---
I usually end up with 200-400 steel, with the bonus drops of gunpowder from the muties. One quick hop to either charleston/elevator/penitentiary for lead, and I can crap 1k+ of whatever ammo I need.
---
Yeah, it has over 300 rounds on a full charge and you can sustain fire for many many cores. Now I just need/want to find an increased fire rate one!
---
Does it spoil?
---
Had that happen once. There were like 3 -80 +level scorched beasts and an uncountable number of other high level creatures plus some on had nuked the area . I then fell half way through the map somehow and a scorchbeast actually landed on me. Not a fun experience.
---
Thanks for answering, yes talking about guns!
---
When played, gives no buff, but attracts scorchbeasts and buffs them instead
---
I think most the complaints about how other people‚Äôs bases built are ridiculous, but the complaints about spawning in a rad shower or having a rad shower hidden so you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there until you walk through it are legitimate. Yes, it‚Äôs easy to re-rad, but it‚Äôs also easy for people who choose to vend to realize not everyone will appreciate their hidden rad shower.
---
Just turned level 10 mate.
---
A stealth based heavy gunner build doesn't make much sense.
---
I want to see the classic Fallout look -- the one armed leather jacket, the Max Rockatansky look. It was a classic Fallout look that was central to the early days of the game, and it's missing.
---
The greaser jacket look is almost perfect to the original Fallout look. All it'd need is one armed remove and the pauldron added to the shoulder, and you'd have the perfect retro classic Fallout look.
---
I have a similar build as above. I'm a stealth rifle build, but my secondary is always my combat shotgun (non legendary). If I lose my stealth, I lose a lot of my damage, and the rifles are a bit slow (even my lever-action) so a shogun with the Enforcer per x3 does wonders at keeping the mobs off of me (while I backpedal).
---
Enforcer is the only non-rifle perk I carry, but its sooooo worth it.
---
I played during the original stress test, I stumbled across this and was legitimately spooked and excited to figure it out. Without spoiling it, I think I had higher expectations.
---
i totally missed that thread! thanks. i'll check it out.
---
and i don't mind PVP and multiplayer as long as it's not a complete noob-destructing fuck-you-all arms race! And i'm getting the impression that it is no such thing.
---
yeah this is a bug and they are looking into fortunately! hopefully the next patch will have a fix
---
Ammo is such a pain I mostly run unarmed. Have an explosive shotty for tagging mobs though.
---
Better yet a real raider power armor skin not this crap we see that changes the armor to xo1
---
One more for Fisto, in New Vegas.
---
That videos a fucking joke and it's been on here plenty. Quit posting it no one cares it exaggerates the problems and is highly inaccurate. 
---
Standard FO76 Bashing BS
---
"The nation's best and brightest..."
---
Disappearing power armor is a widely reported issue, but it's not clear if it's one bug or multiple bugs. Since players cannot prove that they didn't drop the armor, it's often discounted as player error. Good luck. Maybe someday it'll be figured out.
---
"You are capable of figuring out things on your own, rather than having your hand held. If you found this description without having to post a new thread asking for opinions, congratulations! You might have what it takes to enjoy Fallout 76."

Oh No

I've only ever engaged in pvp when I have chosen to do so. I have only ever had my base destroyed once. Why should Bethesda be forced to eliminate all aspects of pvp in adventure mode? I miss looting a place and then my blood pumping because I'm full of junk and there is another player close to me. Will he kill me and take my junk? Will he wave and continue on his way? That was an adventure! What is adventurous in adventure mode now? Nothing. Why? Because everyone wants to be winners. But everyone cant be winners. You cant have winners without losers.
---
I cant speak for those who have had issues with griefers because it's been a rare instance for me. I would say that 90% of the people I have encountered in the wasteland are pretty chill. 
---
If you are encountering a PvP situation in adventure mode, its because you put yourself in that situation. I rarely take over a workshop because I like to wander for my resources, you know...adventure. I've battled a few times for a workshop. I've won, I've lost. In the end, I've always gotten a mutual thumbs up and I will drop a beer. Met some nice people like that. Are there dick? You betcha. The world if full of them. 
---
I dont necessarily agree with the OP saying its teaching life lessons, it's a game. And people need to take it for that. You win some, you lose some. Just because others dont play the way you like doesnt mean Bethesda should eliminate the ability for them to play. Everyone in the game is 100% avoidable. 
---
Losing is the driving force that makes winners. Someone beats you, you take a step back, regroup, and come at them harder.
---
I‚Äôve played solo since launch (with the exception of completing challenges that require other players and helping players with kit/materials), pvp is cool if you like that kind of thing but I‚Äôm almost always in adventure mode. 
---
The game still has bugs to work out but to be fair to Bethesda it‚Äôs massively improved since launch and I have faith it will continue to improve in the future. In short, these loads to do and it‚Äôs thoroughly enjoyable most of the time.
---
You‚Äôll be some amazing people in the wastelands and some muppets too, but mostly the players are really cool.
---
Also check out filthy casuals subreddit,  they‚Äôre a lovely bunch.
---
Same
---
And the fact head protection doesn't really give proper protection is really questionable. Yeah, I get helmets give 1DR now, but... why? Why are helmets so useless? They either do nothing OR remove are -2 perception. They're almost useless.
---
You got the discord link
---
Gatling skins please; several in a pack...
---
A wardrobe preview interface would be amazing, not just for the atom shop, but for ingame, if you eventually get a lot of skins/outfits.
---
I got a 2 shot perception 90% weight assaultron head but for some reason the two shit disappeared
---
You need 3 for a recipe to complete the cooking badge
---
My original character is a tank/shotty build. I still use her for crafting and PvP. She's the honey pot.
---
&gt;my suggestions give pacifist players a way out
---
Ok - and assuming that everyone takes that way out? Are you not back to not being able to ruin peoples camps for no reasons and kill/rob people that have no interest in interacting with you and bought the game because they too are fans of the fallout series but not necessarily PVP games? 
---
Look, ultimately this is not a PVP game. 
---
In previous fallout games, could people rob you? No. Yet it was a survival game. The survival aspect is in regards to the environment, not other players. 
---
You want to rob people - that's great.
---
I'm betting the majority do not want to be robbed - this is not that type of game. We all know what type of game it is.
---
We all know what type of game it was when we bought it. Nowhere did it say people could rob other people.
---
In fact, it said (in response to people asking could it be played in single player)  that although its online and you will be put into a world with other people, you do not have to engage with them if you don't want to, you do not have to fight with them if you don't want to and you can completely ignore them if you want to.
---
All the changes since to make it friendlier to PVE players is due to griefers.  A level 10 playing the game for the first time starts constructing his first base and two level 80's come through and destroy it.
---
I mean why - where the hell is the satisfaction in that?  Where is the fun aspect for the level 10?  How can anyone feel good about themselves after that?
---
I have destroyed many many hostile players in my time in fallout thanks to my handmade TSE that i managed to get my hands on early enough. Those kills were in no way satisfying to me, it was never a fair fight and they never stood a chance as soon as they started attacking.  Yet as i never knew what weapon they would pull out and attack with - it became my default.
---
Does that make for good PVP? Hell no? Good PVP is a level playing field - where a win feels like a win. Not some high levels mowing down lower levels - that's just pathetic.
---
Yet i seen so much of it in this game. Even now people going around with stuff they bought on ebay trying to get into a fight with anybody so they can feel good about and justify their purchase.
---
When the developers look at changes, they have to consider the experience for everyone, not only people who want to do nothing more than greif others. If it becomes a greif fest - how many regular players do you think will stick around? 
---
Who will you pray on then?
---
That's why for a game to be successful, PVE and PVP populations need to be seperated. Because lose your PVE players (the majority in this game) and you lose your income.
---
PvE boss will probably come in raids update, not this one.
---
If this made someone at Bethesda laugh as hard as I just did it's going to happen
---
I agree, pinpointing locations is dumb. I say remove the current system, hide all players and replace it with a sort of heat map. Something that shows where activity is happening, but not exact locations. The map is huge, so there should be some kind of clue as to where people are, but exact locations isn‚Äôt the solution.
---
So they are aware?
---
First of all, I am here since day 1 but I left the game and community couple months ago so I didn't know anyone was sharing BUT it is not exaggerating anything, it is not inaccurate. It is just what it is.
---
Most people over lvl 50 don‚Äôt use raider armor so I can see why Bethesda doesn‚Äôt focus on raider armor. I like the skins they just put out. So did a lot of others because I see them everywhere especially the death rider skin
---
Nope. No spoil.
---
I rotate back and forth between my combat AAE shotgun and AAE combat rifle and vampire AA handmade.  For heavy artillery I bust out my prime explosive Gauss rifle.  
---
I love the combat shotgun but good grief it breaks down quickly.
---
It uses Yellowcake flux instead of Violet so its nice to have some variety to which flux you need to use.  I use a Mutant's 25% faster fire rate gatling plasma primed so I can my flux reliance away from Violet and mix it up.  A 50 cal, AAE or BE depending on your build is the best DPS primed heavy gun but you only get 180 rounds with Ammosmith per flux, and plasma cores last longer.
---
I can't figure out what they changed but my past 100% capacity plasma cores seem to reload to 281 rounds now.
---
Lucky you, I saw it in one of the pre-release gameplay videos.
---
That‚Äôs been posted many times, still haven‚Äôt seen it as I‚Äôve enjoyed forming my own opinions.
---
I have repaired so many turrets at player camps because I was visiting their vending machines.  I also may have lead a small horde of glowing mole rats to one guy that locked all 8 of his water purifiers. 
---
I figure karma wise I'm even overall.
---
I would say for strength you need lock and load and bullet shield. Lock and loas reloads faster and bullet shield is 60 damage resistance while firing.
---
Never going there again, legit fuck that cave
---
ye I saw the post i will delete this now.
---
I just wish for some long feminine hair, like you know, most girls have.
---
Found three pipe wrenches and the occasional cap so far.
---
Had the same thing happen when I had it the other day. 
---
TS Gatling makes good work of them.
---
I have the plague rider best out of them all imo but it was a lil shady how it says it apply's to all armors but actually changes the armor instead of having a unique version of the skin.
---
Ok I never suggested this game become rust i like you have limited time to play this game therefore cant be online all the time i have about 4 hours a day. I like how this is a middle ground between rust and something pve. I like this game for the potential is has for pve and its pvp. 
---
I said you can learn life lessons...  not all of them but some good ones. 
---
This is a mutliplayer game so why in gods name would you play a multiplayer game if you don‚Äôt want to deal with other players good or bad? There a plenty of single player games out there for you if its too rough someone destroyed your camp... not sure why you would play this for pure pve when the pve is literally revive somone in water collect carrots collect bones while wearing a fedora. The pve in this game sucks atm. The endgame is pvp or grind legendaries.
---
I realise i am in the minority which is why if you check my previous post i made suggestions to accomodate players like yourself while not ruining pvp players fun.
---
No you are wrong the devs wanted a more pvp based game there was a perk in charisma which was called outlaw and directly impacted your wanted counter slap damage was implemented last minute to appease players like yourself due to backlash and fear of griefers. The devs had a survival vision of this game but the player base didn‚Äôt want that don‚Äôt delude yourself.
---
Unfortunately the reality is this games playerbase and game design was a mismatch but the least bethesda can do is implement changes so this game is remotely fun for the minority while the rest of you heart emote and look at camps.
---
Op edited the post.
---
&gt; Is it because we are all idiots except for you?
---
Pretty much, might go nuke some WS camps now.
---
Not without an increase to camp budgets.  I can‚Äôt even build all 4 trading machines i‚Äôm entitled to without scrapping part of my base.
---
This happens due to the constraints of the engine and is unlikely to be changed, unfortunately
---
I would love this, happened once and I couldn't say thank you to that guy!
---
Thank you. This is probably the answer.
---
I bought the drifter outfit off someone‚Äôs vendor for 5 credits and sold it an hour later on mine for 500 credits.  People are weird about outfits.
---
I diagree with pretty much everything you said there i like the aspects of survival you dislike i just want more caps for killing somone more opportunities to kill somone incentive to destroy camps and no more immortal camps.
---
If you are on xbox you can look through my plans and take what you don't know....I have a bunch.
---
I have a level 20 legendary combat shotgun (at level 81 now) that I use as my primary method to grab the momentum in any fight. It has a bonus to cripple limbs, double-shot, and with Enforcer 3, I can shoot off the legs (or wings) of any creature, then stand back and whack them in their immobile face with a dopey regenerating sword or a non-legendary handmade for a very easy, if somewhat cheesy, lkill. It has never failed me, it tears everything apart, and I can't imagine giving it up.
---
I would prefer it to be much more treacherous at night compared to day.  More wandering hordes and ghouls.  So much so that you really don't want to go out at night at all.
---
ton? Screw the dunwich quarry on hardcore survival. I have mods that have to make you wear gas mask at all times and winter mods with constant storms so it makes it so much worse
---
I'm 100% double barrel shotgun no matter what I'm killing, deals 158 damage and I have over 3000 shells for it. It's my pride and joy
---
Never
---
The community manager replied to someone within the last few days and said that it's being investigated. There's no ETA on the fix, but they're working on it. I vaguely remember there were 3 separate issues all revolving around melee hits being inconsistent.
---
Sounds about right! üòÇ
---
All that, and no mention of Morris's final holotape? That was the most chilling oart of that questline.
---
Unless OP intends to sneak up for PvP and unload with an explosive LMG.
---
Once you have the termimal password from Fort Defiance you can head straight to VTU with the dna on repeat quests.
---
It's not broken. They turned it off for now. It was in the patch notes.
---
All the way back in E3 2018 game footage there were shots of being able to place the ammo, medical, etc. vending machines like the ones outside train stations. So that tells me they‚Äôve had the idea for a long time and that it was possibly even meant to be in the game at launch, but was likely removed because they couldn‚Äôt even implement it right in time or something. So no, I wouldn‚Äôt say your idea sparked the creation, but I am just glad the vending machines are finally here and are awesome.
---
Its a survival game shouldn‚Äôt you be prepared for pvp if you take a workshop? The people i kill take workshops how is that forcing pvp? Explain? They were forced to take a workshop? Ok then
---
I just tried again with a friend to make sure and it would not let me trade anymore. So never mind what I said.
---
Oh I was talking about the Dunwich building in Fallout 3, but the quarry works too. I mean in Point Lookout you literally find a dark tome you have to destroy to prevent the demons in the basement from escaping or something
---
Heavy Gunner x3, Demo Expert, those are must, then you can add One gun army for staggering, Stabilized for accuracy and armor penetration, Nerd rage for more damage, Adrenaline and bloody mess for extra damage, etc etc
---
It's hard to sometimes because I'll be in like west tek and I wanna kill all mutants for the possibility for a legendary or even free range events 2 and a half minutes it's that long sometimes lol and a shit ton of resources and 20 copper later my camp is back up and I'm copper less lol
---
Fancy taking a swing at some lottery numbers for me??
---
Bullshit I've also been playing since day one. That vid is complete and utter crap there is no merit to it. FO76 was never as bad as that vid makes it sound. It spreads nonsense lies in exchange for views it's garbage just for shock value and views.
---
Why not? High rate of stagger for sent/cav builds. Please post something other than no it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I want feedback not short sighted opinions.
---
I run a stealth build and keep always a suppressed shotgun for the tougher enemies.
---
I do contest a lot of workshops. Tons of plans and junk! People also put up really good fights if they really want to hang onto their workshops lol. Other than that I leave people be. I just like morbid shit so i decided to make a raider style camp with the totems I bought from the atom shop. The mounted dead animals and skin rugs helped but man are we lacking in lighting and other  aesthetics for these types of builds!
---
The building was creepy but for me it wasn't as scary because I have a extreme fear of under ground places like the quarry
---
Explosive is still probably the best major legendary effect, but it definitely is not what it used to be. People are looking for 25%faster fire rate a lot, but I haven't tested it.
---
Since one of the recent updates yes, but it's I've only gotten crappy junk like dinner plate or baby rattle and it shows up as an alert in the upper left hand of the screen.
---
Ah. So you are a spawn camping griefer.
---
Gotcha.
---
No your not the only one i finally gotten a three star double barrel shotgun obliterates everything I come across haven't tried queen yet but I'mma gonna try it
---
I helped my wife with this quest this weekend.  I'm a Level 83, she's a level 19, but she wanted to finish Rose's quest.  We crept through the cave, dispatched the mirelurk kings and crept up on the wendigo.  I thought I had this one all figured out.  She would stay back, and I would take it down with a well-placed shot.  It worked great at first, and I managed to one shot the damn thing back to hell.  My wife ran up, looking for the key fragment.  Nothing.  
---
Since she didn't land a shot, the fragment didn't spawn.  We were sitting there wondering what to do, when another damn glowing wendigo came in full sprint.  I heard an honest to god shreik from the bedroom, and the next few minutes was basically a knife fight in a phone booth with the damn thing.  We beat it, but it cost a good half dozen stimpacks.
---
and they wouldve gotten away with it if it wasnt for those damn meddling kids!
---
I remember clearing the cabins to get cover into one of them, trying to find the source of the screaming. When I saw the paintings spinning I figured something was wrong, but somehow I did not find the source. It took me a second visit to say hey, let's see what this is all about....
---
I sold 2 legendaries last week (I'm a heavy build) so nope, there are other shotty folks out there.
---
I literally put another set of stairs on the outside of the building going to the second floor so I can delete the "regular" set, move it, then delete the spare set from the outside.  Its a workaround but it does work.
---
You can hope for anything you want. but nuclear winter has been called a "new mode" and involves a shrinking firestorm circle. It's very clearly going to be the most popular online genre added to this most unpopular online game.
---
I know this SOUNDS fun and aesthetic. but PLEASE don't forget the chunky chunk of the player base that still needs BETTER accessibility for this game. not worse. still no in game chat, still crap volume/no separate slider for volume  on holotapes and inconsistent (yet consistently too tiny) dialog captions,etc.
---
this is one of the few games I've come across that has no slider bar for brightness/contrast/shadows. 
---
My C.A.M.P. budget is 60% lights lol. the world is so dark I end up using my PA headlamp and sitting three feet from the TV, just to give myself a headache. I routinely lose loot because I can't see where the body dropped in the grass. The Tadpole quest to get sting wings took ages. 
---
that all being said, I could see how a player demand for more customization in visibility options would help everybody out.
---
You want to reverse the changes made for destructible camps and enforcing PvP on player whom have captured a workshop. 
---
Also legendary are means to an end, not a prerequisite for endgame. They make one player OP, but doesn't mean that the game cannot be finished without any legendaries. Also there is more than the loop for top tier gear.
---
Enough?
---
Seconded!
---
I repaired someone's fusion reactor on Friday because they had such a nice base build and they were selling good stuff (plans, mats, etc) in the vending machines. Super mutants were tearing the place down when I got there, and they always go for the generator first. Not so dumb after all.
---
I.... didn‚Äôt even know you can repair other people‚Äôs bases. Can‚Äôt wait to help some other people out.
---
No im complaining the option isnt there and complaining the direction the game is headed
---
someone didn't read the patch notes...
---
If I had to speculate I'd say that until Survival Mode leaves beta, we won't see any major PVP focused content.  It's not balanced yet in my opinion. It would make sense to flesh out more end game content. Adding PVE raids would be a great addition, and would at least save us from just running Nuke sites all the time.
---
The fact it can take up to 5+ minutes for the game to be playable and everything to properly load in on first log in is unacceptable. It gets worse every update. I literally logged in four minutes ago, and the legendary exchanges still aren't up. These objects shouldn't take that long to log in.
---
Sometimes they load fast, sometimes it takes over five minutes. It's ridiculous.
---
Great idea. And if we do get the wall turrets it would be cool if we could also get the stronger Mark II, III, and IV turrets that shoot incendiary ammo, armor piercing ammo, and explosive ammo. 
---
Maybe tie the newer turret upgrades into a short quest to raid a Military Bunker for technology or make it a new perk card.
---
I think it more about weight reduction not effecting the mods on a gun... A fully modded hand made is like 22lbs I think with no wr...
---
Yea the name calling is to bring attention to the post. Worked if you ask me
---
Alright well it depends on what weapon you plan on building around. For instance a harpoon gun would be a good stealth weapon as it deals a lot of damage and has a low fire rate.
---
If you are using an LMG I would build it based on putting a lot of firepower out without worrying about stealth.
---
Most heavy weapons deal low damage but have a high rate of fire so the first shot in sneak wouldn't do much damage either way.
---
The number of potential settlement pieces you could say this for is getting dizzying at this point.
---
I disregarded lock and load and bullet shield for these reasons. Not enough points for the cards I really need - I want unarmed as backup and carrying multiple heavy guns is well heavy and I will need depending upon different resistance of enemies/players. Reload speed is a legendary effect and with the clip count being so high on heavy guns I don‚Äôt bother. As far as the damage resistance from firing I don‚Äôt want because I‚Äôd rather go after % based reductions I believe they offer more bang for their buck. With having that perk card set up for str I can‚Äôt really swap any out.
---
Honestly, I can't be bothered to kite mobs just so I can take a photo. But it's still better then me, as a solo player, trying to take a pic of someone wearing 3 specific outfits in front of a building I have never been to on the edge of a map while high on buffout at noon. To hell with that.
---
Damn punch bowl dupers
---
That sweet ultracite tho
---
All the time. All 5 pieces of my armor are weight reduction. When i join on a friend, if i join them from a lobby im currently in, i lose my weight reduction perks. Now if i back out to the main screen and join them, it seems to work properly. I've sent Bethesda tickets with screen shots but they give me the same response. "We will pass this along to the Devs for review."
---
neither.  Just coincidence.  get over yourself.
---
Come see me, WAFFLE78STOMPER. üòÅ
---
So 2lbs on the gun and 11 worth of mods in your case.
---
I like the way you think!
---
I joined fairly recently, the game is great, love the exploration aspect. For me quests and stories are just kind of side activities
---
America's best and brightest can build breathtakingly elaborate C.A.M.P.s but can't use a shovel to level a 1x1 square to plant some damn razorgrain
---
Sooo many. It‚Äôs quite disheartening.
---
Hell yeah! They could give us an option to make our faces look ghoulish since we are always running around massively irradiated.
---
I too &gt;!woke up late and hungover on reclamation day !&lt;and didn't get in as early as many others.  There were players in the 90's - 110's frequently on my servers, and I've very happily slogged out a positive experience.  I've come across a few trolls (one shot me with the instigating railway rifle I just sold him), but no one had harassed me just for being low level, in fact, my experience has been quite the opposite.
---
Bummer, my 20+ cameras will remind how lucky I am ...
---
I use them, although its more of a "oh shit i've got not ammo", I haven't specc'd anything towards it on this current char.
---
That being said, I like that style of gameplay, but you're right, I haven't seen many people playing with a shotty for a while.
---
That seems to work most of the times but yesterday I had no luck with that solution.  Ended up creating something new from scratch :(
---
I think it's bugged as I had the 76/76 subchallenge checked in already the moment the challenge went live.
---
Sneak multipliers work like this as long as you are crouched in PvP you get the multiplier. Obviously in PvE you have to remain hidden. Max damage on a player is 190 no matter what per hit. Due to the recent changes Bethesda made. So high fire guns with low damage per shot get boosted by crouching and hitting sneak multipliers up to that magic 190.
---
I wouldn't care if they sold good and useful clothing. I'm tired of seeing people trying to sell t-shirts, tattered skirts, patched suits, and bandanas. The first couple days of vending, I scored quite a few rare outfits for next to nothing. Now it's slim pickins.
---
I run both builds on the same character, you can have a stealth sniper/commando build with the weight reduction and carry weight in strength and maxed rifleman/commando then switch to heavy gunner load out with p/a for nuke zones. Currently at around lvl 138 ish.
---
lol
---
FyI, There is a bit of misinformation on the SB contained in my post.  This is an old post and I simply forgot to edit.  Sugar Bombs will NOT become irradiated if left in your inventory.  This was misinformation passed on to me through another reddit post and when I tested it, it appeared true.  Further testing showed that it was not.  Sorry for any misinformation there.
---
Here we see the result of growing up with participation trophies.
---
I totally understand everyone runs differently :) I hope it works out
---
"I can explain!..."
---
I really love how they kept the real folklore of how wendigos are made.
---
You said at the end of the post you made previously why dont you go play rust oh wait you can‚Äôt hack that like fo76... sounds like you calling me a hacker there
---
Everything you said was plain wrong. The severs were packed during the first weeks of release but got quiet after the nerf.
---
I enjoy this game because its fallout both pve and pvp don‚Äôt  i can play what i like.
---
Why don‚Äôt you stop hiding behind the hivemind?
---
They need to put a timer on it. I had one guy come into my shop and take everything in my bowl. After someone takes something, there should be a 1 hour timer preventing you from taking everything. 
---
Jokes was on that guy. He was a lvl 10 and consumed a vintage nukashine. Ended up in the bog somewhere. Im sure he instantly regretted his actions lol.
---
If on console, there is a recent players function outside the game social system (XB1 phone app does this for sure).
---
That I did not know, in that case tear up some fools from a crouched position. I didn't intend to come off as ignorant so I'm sorry if it appeared to be that way.
---
Your mind seems to be stuck in a PvP gutter.  Fallout has always been a survival game - I try to survive the wastelands against muties, robots, deathclaws and all manner of stuff that try to kill you.  Not all online games need PvP - the world of Fallout is a great experience when people work together to try to survive the wastelands.  There's no need to kill each other unless you're a self absorbed individual.
---
If anything the latest patch and update just shows up how much the larger community of players appreciate the coop aspects far more.  Bethesda's mistake was trying to include a PvP element - I guess they felt they needed to ride on the Fortnite success.  Wrong audience unfortunately - the majority of core Fallout players don't care about PvP.
---
That ego. You think you are the only one who thought of player vendors? And even tagging Bethesda ppl for that shit... Seriously. Get over yourself.
---
I wish they would add an option for Perk loadouts, it would be so helpful
---
I always keep a shotgun on my weapon wheel, at my level (45) they're the best damage output for their weight that I can get. Yeah, the range sucks, but the shotgun has saved my ass more times than I can count when surrounded by tough enemies.
---
The shotty is my backup for the super sledge. Sometimes I feel like shooty shooty instead of smashy smashy, and it does the job.
---
Hopefully tommorow they're gonna fix this damn issue :)
---
This could be interesting
---
you could always wait for the steam version,  it has no release date though.
---
LOLOLOL Too funny. I admit to making a few not-so-brave noises myself playing this game. Mothman still freaks me out when it catches me unaware.
---
Toxic Water works wonders too.
---
You should start your own chapter of the BOS with you as the elder
---
The 90% reduced weight on rifles has never worked for me. So I ended up assuming it was applying the affect to the base weight of the weapon and that all mods were being added at full weight on top of that.
---
It's glitchey as hell sometimes but my God is it fun. It made me join Reddit.
---
I think some of it has to do with where you spawn and how busy that area is, both in terms of other players and the amount of content that has to be loaded.  Being out in the middle of nowhere in the Savage Divide, I don't have long load times getting in.  It's traveling to Watoga Station where it takes a while.
---
/r/ToddRolls
---
That's probably the easiest way to go about it and it's super generic, so no wonder it's the same
---
Some buy to cash in.  A 3 star for 500 is quick script when I'm a little short for the day and its time to quit.
---
Plus you get more ammo back than you use.  My BerzExp Harpoon Flechette Gun is named "The Loaves and Fishes."
---
"When I played Fallout 76, we didn't have planters. We had to put our succulents in a bathtub, and we were grateful!"
---
To be fair they did try to help you fix it. 
---
That‚Äôs weird though. I haven‚Äôt had that problem at all.
---
AAE weapons sell quite well. . .  I've made 50k caps off of 2 sales in the past 10 days. Not too bad imho.
---
Agreed! Just thought this last night. I finished my camp and would love to just sit there as people shop so they can properly inspect my legendaries. Would like to be able to wave when they come and go and heart when they buy something. I feel like a creeper standing around. Let me sit in front of my tv.
---
Could just put legendaries in parenthesis...   20 armor =17 outfits and 3 legendaries is 20(3)
---
Same with weapons.  10 weapons = 8 grenades and 2 legendaries is 10(2)
---
Love the idea!
---
A build is just a name for how you set up your perks and items. Normally but not always they are min/maxed to get the most amount of whatever stat the person wants (normally damage but some people go for complete damage resist so they can imitate a brick wall.)
---
You can totally have a build based around shotguns i know that as I'm doing it right now. Mainly it is all about the shotgun damage perk cards but other important ones are the spread reduction and then it is pretty much all damage resist stuff and carry weight reductions for utility with things like gunsmith and lockpicking as well (thankfully I play with my waifu so she does the armor mods and hacking)
---
If you don't know where to start on improving your "build" you can always post it up with a "how do I make this build better/viable/work" thread in this sub.
---
The dust going through roofs is the real problem.
---
Hey its me Kael ,  glad you like the weapon pal ;)  Do u want to know secret how to get God Roll Purveyor ? :D
---
I think the odds were adjusted with the patch just before this one. I won two in the same weekend.
---
Filthy casuals on here has a link to their discord
---
pick up a hammer or something with wood in it and look at component view and untag it?
---
I agree.  Having it require 5 ranks to complete is crazy.
---
TSEs presented a balancing problem, it's true, but their solution put the individual effects in a very weird place.
---
Is it perfect? No.  But if you spend $20 or less, I think you will be happy with your investment. But if you are spending more than that or MMOs are super not your jam or you already don't love Fallout, then I'd hold off.
---
There is a way to scrap/store the unwanted items.
---
I cannot remember exactly, but it has to do with attaching a floor and walls to unwanted item and then delete them all.
---
I followed instructions from a previous post and it worked for me.
---
Add new ranks to Home Defense?
---
How does making camps destructable make me a camper? Doesn't that works agaist my playstyle if I want to camp spawns with an immortal base? Explain.
---
I agree there should be changes to make the mode less campy, but that's all I agree with you one.
---
I'm far too feral to be a member, but it doesn't stop me from sporting a set of BOS power armor. 
---
Speaking of, anyone have an extra paladin paint plan lying around for sale on Xbone?
---
Perhaps what you are experiencing is the enemy defending/blocking? I've had this happened a few times with my melee and at the beginning it was quite confusing and annoying...
---
I was about to thank you, then I realized you said they had a nice base, so probably not me ;-)
---
Still, that‚Äôs awesome and you should get 3* drops and no wood armor (unless you like wood armor, I‚Äôm not gonna judge...)
---
Fellow shotgunner here :)
---
Dude if only it would register that I killed the Scorchbeast Queen. Even after killing it on 3 separate characters I still can‚Äôt get that challenge checked off. Man and those location challenges are even worse. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind Bethesda making the Daily Challenges as difficult as they are if they would have just left the Weekly Challenges as they were. 
---
With all my in-game experience I‚Äôm still lucky if I can complete half the Weekly Challenges and two of the Daily‚Äôs.
---
:D
---
Been requested since day 1.
---
In PC of course you can get it via mod but in console you are SoL.
---
It would be a massive QoL improvement for everyone.
---
Have you ever stood next to a metal shredder? They be loud
---
So you seem to either forget or were not around during the times where griefers were going around with OP weapons combined with stacks of bobbleheads killing people regardless of if they wanted the fight or not. I got nailed quite a few times.
---
That's why slap damage had to be removed. 
---
Have had my camp destroyed too quite a few times by a trio here or a duo there to the point i gave up with the damn thing - i loved camp building in Fallout 4, one of the things i was looking forward to in fallout 76. I used to spend hours in fallout 4 trying all sorts of different builds and seeing what i could and couldn't do.  But turns out on Falllout 76, i had to bypass that because after spending hours off trying to find materials as a low level, and getting started, some muppets would start destroying it while shouting abuse at me.
---
While i am sure that taking on a level 9 player and his camp was a great laugh and totally engaging PVP gameplay for those muppets - it nearly made me quit as this was not the fallout game i had bought into. I had no way to fight back. I had no way to stop them from destroying  anything i built. What's the point in this game.
---
But rather than quit the game, i just gave up basebulding because whats the point in trying to enjoy yourself when there are muppets everywhere that get a kick out of ruining it.
---
Thus - camp protection had to be introduced - and i fully supported it and still do. That is no experience that anyone should have to endure - if they want to spend their time building a base, why should others be allowed ruin their enjoyment of the game?
---
Your story about losing junk - that's still there you know that right? In that scenario, if you repeated it today, and died, you would still lose it so i fail to see your point here.
---
But also - if you had all this junk, and your blood was pumping because you saw a player and wondered if he would kill you and take it all or wave..... didn't you say you only ever engage in PVP when you chose to - so if that other player chose to take all your junk, how would he if you did not return fire?
---
So everything you said up to that point makes no sense simply because nothing has changed and it all still applies. 
---
You seem to have deluded yourself with this "everyone has to be winners" nonsense. 
---
In my above example - i didn't need to be a "winner" - i needed to be left alone. How is that so difficult for you to understand.
---
If i want to be a winner - ill turn on Rainbow Six and enter a ranked match and fight tooth and nail to try and win.
---
See....PVP works best on a level playing field - I don't feel i always have to be a winner - my win/loss record on rainbow six will speak to that - its horrible to look at.
---
Yet i enjoy playing it because every game is on a level playing field. I don't need to worry that the other team has been off to ebay to buy some OP stuff and is wearing OP armor that will absorb most my shots while i am 1 shot killed.
---
Had a level 70 player try to take a workshop from me the other day - i came over and waved and thought maybe if he knows i'm there he might bounce - he didnt - i one shot him. Nothing enjoyable about that for either one of us i imagine.  I don't count that as a pvp experience. 
---
I agree with having a proper dedicated survival mode (proper that pvp players could be proud of), but i oppose having one single server where everyone is forced into PVP. That's what the OP has been suggesting.
---
Would you like to join?
---
You can join as a guest and ask if you would like
---
No I'm complaining the option should be there in a survival game, the only camps i've wrecked at ones that camp whitespring + other spawns.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve been playing it on the regular PS4 for about a month now and I‚Äôm having a blast. I‚Äôve disconnected maybe two times in the past 4 weeks which isn‚Äôt bad at all, and I‚Äôve been playing it a fair amount. 
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered any game breaking glitches. You do get the odd ghoul stuck in a wall or some strange issues with the camp building (eg the error ‚ÄúNo item is selected‚Äù like wtf does that even mean) every so often, but nothing big
---
oh god let me buy a chameleon serum
---
You could RP as an outcast?! Or that crazy loner hermit guy in fo4!
---
I cant stand games where you cant tell if its even night or not
---
I wouldn't mind slightly darker but maybe half way between what we have and what the mire is.  I can't see anything when its night in the Mire.  Even though it would be more realistic I would rather not have the eye strain.  It's bad enough now, lol.
---
The computer terminal inside the office gives you quest markers for the officers.
---
Nope it's definitely a bug
---
Yep.
---
Every update is stored on your local machine, but the flags to enable the content seem to be server based. Every time you log in the game it seems to have to redownload manifests to see if that item/quest/event can appear in the game world (this is part of the system that allows them to release timed content on live servers without an update). If the system is even remotely lagged (and it always is) or you're in an area where it has too many item manifests it takes progressively longer to update them.
---
That said, I don't think it's entirely location based. I say that because putting in mainframe cores in a silo can also take up to 5+ minutes for the game to register you've installed even a single one of them. The mainframe cores routinely lag. It's like the server pathway for in-game objects shits itself at times and never fully recovers, and certain actions/objects get queued and take longer than they should.
---
Hey man, loving it, thanks! Whats the secret? :o
---
Sure, it would be an actually active player group
---
I like that idea of certain enemies only come out at night
---
In power connectors you can get the wall units which allow you to link to a generator on one side, and radiate power inside.
---
Something like that black coal miner dust PA skin for shotguns would be pretty sweet.
---
never stop
---
Most creatures glow from the radioactive environment.
---
Molerats glow from the EVIL üëø
---
You can use the wall passtrhrough conduit for instance.
---
Of you can 'cheese' it using the 'rug/sign trick'.
---
I used to do exactly the same damage as you, but after the player vending update, my damage jumped to 2458. I have absolutely no idea why.
---
??? only the mire is dark....
---
Advanced power connections has conduits made to go through walls. You can also use the floormat conduit method to cheese wires where you want.
---
Yes! I would love to have planters on my flat roof areas! Grow some veggies for food and brewing. I‚Äôm built on a cliff side so I don‚Äôt have much flat dirt.
---
Nice story üòä
---
going to do the campfire tales event, it is bright as daytime out... ruins immersion
---
Oh how I wish we could have the Outcast paint, but alas they don't exist yet in 76
---
um, we have pip boy lights and PA headlamps
---
Thanks all, think I'll go get it after work and join you in the wasteland!
---
Any guides or required reading for a new Vault dweller or would you recommend it best to go in blind?
---
5 seconds left?  Sounds like there wouldn't even have been time for my camp to spawn since it loads in one piece at a time  lmao
---
I was going to make a complaint about this but I‚Äôm glad somebody else pointed it out for me! This is killing pvp for me and needs to be addressed yesterday. I hit a guy five goddamn times before he turned around and shot me in the face and took most of my aid. He should have been dead four swings ago! Melee builds are already at a huge disadvantage in survival. We HAVE to catch people off guard! This is game breaking for me
---
What‚Äôs the point? What‚Äôre you spending those caps on if you‚Äôre constantly switching between 8 characters? 
---
Legit. This is a waste of time.
---
How am I forcing PvP , they took the workshop? They chose PvP there is a big notification... just because you wanted to workshop and thought you could avoid the PvP then get murdered anyone who does that is a victim of thier own decision. Anyone with any drop of self accountability would come to that conclusion.
---
I never said you needed legendaries to complete the games story but you you are making the game 10000000X times harder if you don't. Once you finish the missions what is there to do besides farming legendaries and PvP? Tell me what there is too do.
---
Or just use the nukacrypt code and skip all that? I did, on Saturday.
---
It is fun to play with friends, and seems to be easy to find people to play with in game as well if you would rather not play solo.
---
I've started a new character recently and have been playing survival mode, but have only run across friendly players lol
---
Very good indeed!
---
I got two decent handmades (Ghoul Slayer explosive, Quad something-or-other, maybe fire rate?) out of 1000 scrip on Day 1 plus max allowed trades since.  Got a 3* stalker pole hook with swing speed and a special buff (can't remember which) but melee VATS still a bit messed up.
---
I still think it's a fair system overall but I'm not carrying garbage legendaries around while I wait for the machine limit to reset any more.
---
Is it just me or does the "take a camera photo of x" stuff keep going wrong.
---
Like sometimes it registers that I've taken them and other times it doesn't.
---
Incorrect. Recon is a white diamond. The red pip is your perception picking them up. I run a handmade and i get red pips. No recon scope on it
---
Is it modded? Try removing all mods and checking what it weighs then. Then remod and compare the difference
---
yeah i made a post where bethesda replied last week, so that gives us hope!
---
I can do that? Thanks for telling me haha
---
It's still dark enough to make it tricky to see what you're doing when rebuilding your camp at night.
---
Run too. When u get in a fight switch them. The armor give u 91 damage res i have armored and regular i switvh between
---
Yes it is.
---
Oh shit you're right
---
I don't have that yet I'm working on it. So far I have grouded, Speed Demon, and Twisted Muscles for sale.
---
Yup, save yourself a lot of time and decoding headaches :)
---
At least something
---
I'm curious about this too.  I don't have a before-and-after perspective on this, but my route - which is basically traveling the road between Watoga and Harper's Ferry (I go a bit farther north to Haven Church) - gives me a ton of Legendaries.
---
When I mentioned this in the past, people were like "Are you serious?"  Because, you know, they expect you to farm Whitesprings or West-Tek.  But this route is more scenic and it's completely repeatable.  I've gotten 3\* Sent/Cav twice out of it, because it seems like every other battle involves some kind of potential 3\* Legendary.
---
Fair enough - and what about others who love nothing more than to simply destroy someones camp.
---
Had it happen to me when i was level 9 over and over until i just gave up trying to build one.
---
Even though i wanted to spend a few hours putting a good one together i was denied this by multiple people who thought it was a great laugh to torment a new player - i don't see the pvp value in that but each to their own.
---
His gun had but a recon scope pip is white. Red pip is they failed a sneak check and your perception is letting you know where they are.
---
This. They populate to a set of "random encounter" spawn points, the computer is the best bet, there are hundreds of points and they will be random to the silos, following the computer will give you the locations for the specific silo you want.
---
Run both - unless you need the fridge, carrying the high capacity and armor plated is the way to go.
---
Maybe it depends on what mode you are playing in, the vault could be a PvE dungeon in adventure and survival modes, or a separate PvP mode in Nuclear Winter where you are playing as a Vault 51 dweller (or in some kind of simulation, either way everyone starts the battle with equal gear and characters). It is the same story, but you see it either from the point of view of the Vault 51 characters, or it is told in the usual way where they are already dead.
---
Haha thanks
---
This.  There were discussion of setting up vending machines at our camps before the BETA even happened.
---
The amount of people that can't spell next on this sub is quite disappointing.
---
how does the tesla has to be modified so it has the bouncing "projectile"?
---
The problem is the mods aren't named properly at all, nor have they been named correctly since launch. You'll come across a mod called "Scout Armor Polymer" but it doesn't tell you if that's for the arms, legs, or torso. You have to buy it and guess.
---
I doubt your post is where they got the idea from. With as many people speculating about how they should go about it at least a handful would get it right.
---
my recommendation to you as you stated you want to farm legendaries, I would suggest finding an instigating melee weapon or an instigating gun, maybe add a silencer
---
and max out your sneak skills and take the appropriate modifier for sneak damage for the type of weapon you choose
---
I was at level 15 one shotting ghouls at whitesprings to power level
---
good luck!
---
1. Gather all scrip till maxed / 1000 Scrip
---
2. Make sure your Luck STATS is above than 10 ( 10 is minimum )
---
3. Equip Full Set Unyielding . Make it 30+ Luck &amp; use aid to increase Luck Buff . ( armor STATS Luck is optional )
---
4. Go Buyin 3* Ranged Weapon / Melee / Armor
---
5. Tadaaaa . 1st time Purveyor i got 5 God Roll :
---
- B10aim Ultracite
---
- IE Western Revolver
---
- TSE LMG
---
- BE Combat Shotgun
---
- B25 Plasma Rifle 
---
The rest is Shitty Roll but has some good 1 &amp; 2 prefix
---
YES LUCK DO HAVE SOME BENEFIT TO PURVEYOR :D
---
Yeah 30 IS taxing lol. That's why I dont collect raiders PA or T-51 or T-60. had it not take up space I'd definitely farm all types of PA. As for renaming, idk if it's a glitch but whenever I store a PA in my stash the name resets
---
For me it happens a lot with instigating melee weapons on mutants and robots. I assumed they were blocking, but w/o the animation.
---
Yeah that stuff looked great!
---
If you get wood armor scrip it immediately.  Run into the daily scrip limit then stop pulling from the Purveyor for the day.
---
Don't need the code pieces to actually launch a nuke. Only thing you need is a keycard. You can just look up what the code is online.
---
Happened repeatedly to me. I don't even restock it anymore.
---
You sound a right dick. Says it all tho long you can learn life lessons from a game. Guess you don‚Äôt get out much.
---
No. If you followed as close as you claim you would know it was one of the things they were wanting from the start.
---
As a Handmade user, this makes me worried. Are you using a controller by any chance? Did you have unusual lag spikes around that time?
---
yeah but for new players and just players without a camp it would be way to dark
---
All of that is consistent with what I've seen as well.
---
The Mainframe Cores are especially annoying, both in taking and placing them.  No other item in the game has such a pronounced pick-up lag.
---
omg pls no. I fix people's bases and turrets all the time, but if I knew that I'd have to run away from an occasional happy shopkeeper 'porting in and chasing me around with another heart above their head or a gift emote and a stack of toasters I'd be far less likely to help out. Acts like that should be normal for us, not noteworthy; if there are no positive or negative repercussions for repairing bases then us Vault Dwellers may more naturally express our own desires and chosen patterns of behaviour to either fix or leave massive gaps in our neighbours' defences
---
Yes same. I spend a lot of time in west tek with my instigating grognaks axe and sometimes i need to hit up 4 times to actually deal sone damage
---
God! they did fuck themselves ever with that fallout 76 lol.   They will always be an example of what not to do.   They hammered the last nail in their coffin with that shit hole game.
---
Exploring the locations, listening the the stories, complete all the quests and when all is done collect plans and items. Building camps, starting a shop, events and dailies etc.
---
You want whole map head hunting for the workshop, we already established that. And the PvP had to be and bow is enabled to workshop boundaries.
---
Also you said the game was build around legendaries and as you can see, it's just harder without them. Especially the broken one-hit type.
---
God, I really LOVE the sound of this weapon! but damn... it sure is an ammo burner. I go on firing my Really expensive 5mm ultracite ammo.
---
what system are you on? if you are on ps4 I can hook you up with something for cheap no problem
---
How do you do the trick?
---
They diffidently didn't think it through, their nerfs essentially ruined all explosive specific weapons, ESPECIALLY the M79 which took hits on multiple fronts and even when the weapon was arguably good almost no one used it. (I swear I must have been one of the few people who loved the M79, and I actively ran around with 2 Two Shot's as they broke fairly quickly)
---
Honestly the nerf to the Explosive Legendary Effect was enough, they should have left the M79 benefiting from the Shotgunner perks and they should have left Demolition Expert at +100% Explosive damage OR made it a 3 rank perk and buffed the M79, Auto Grenade Launcher, Missile Launcher, and Fatman by about 40% to compensate.
---
Even the nerf to Explosive was an overkill in my opinion, an Explosive 10mm Pistol went from dealing like 100+ damage a shot(more than doubling the damage) to dealing literally like 4 or 5 more damage than a base 10mm with Explosive with Demolition Expert 5. (don't know the exact number but it feels like Explosive only grants a bonus 10% damage or so off the weapons base damage)
---
They‚Äôre garbage now.
---
I'd work on getting Egg Head mutation so you get more XP from cooking and then Empath and Herd Mentality since you seem to be built to support a group.
---
"PRAISE THE LORD AND PASS THE AMMUNITION"
---
They won't change it. It's working as intended. They want us buying atoms.
---
It really isn't going to get much cheaper. If you look around I'm sure you could pick it up for $20. As far as the actual game goes if you liked the previous Fallout games then you will probably like this one.
---
You are pulling all this : "the game was advertised and sold as a PVE game with minor PVP aspects should a player choose to partake" out of your ass. The devs know that PvP increases the lifespan of the game , thats why they created survival mode despite the small pvp community. 
---
Its very likley due to data mining that nuclear winter is going to be some sort of battle royale? yeah seems like pve only to me. Battle royale Survival mode. 
---
Slap damage was implemented last minute because players like you cried because you were afraid of griefers, before release there was a perk called oultaw which affected your bounty timer again removed due to crying. The devs had a very different vision for this game.
---
I'm not complaining I can't wreck level 10 players camps honestly I prefer to destroy people on my level but I'd take what I can get sometimes you can't find people who can challenge you. That's literally a story you tell yourself to make yourself feel better, likely because you suck at pvp in this game.
---
Build the connector next to the object and wire it up. After that; place a connector onto a sign, pick the sign up and place it down and then quickly pick it back up. Place the sign where you want the connector and when you put it down the wire will follow 
---
Or use the connectors with built in pieces that go into ceilings or walls
---
Ah ok i see where that misunderstanding came from - Hack in that context is a substitute for, let's say tolerate.
---
The servers were not packed in my experience - and trying to find a new one was difficult too as there were not that many live to choose from. 
---
Managed to find one or two with enough player that i decided to stick around and die a few times - but then grew tired and went back to Adventure mode to kill the queen a few times before bed.
---
What exactly is this hivemind you speak of? 
---
These are my own opinions based on my own experience.
---
These are my own thoughts based on the type of game i bought and want to play.
---
If i needed to hide behind anything - then i wouldn't be here talking with you to begin with. Its clear the community is primarily a PVE one so its not like any of your suggestions will be implements anyway so would have been easy for me to move on to the next thread and not give this a second thought.
---
Can you take a noticeable larger amount of damage? Just curious.
---
Awesome tip. Thanks man!
---
remember me when you do get the plans!   &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs good that they acknowledged it but they need to fork out the shekel and hot fix things of this magnitude especially with survival mode active. It‚Äôs killing melee builds who are already at a disadvantage
---
Nope sorry
---
Enclave bunker vendor has them. 
---
Server hopping and luck are required.
---
They know all the dumbos that played 1600 hours aren't going to stop playing no matter what they do. They know you won't ever quit no matter how hard they squeeze you for money.  They know this game is a flop but they also know the people still playing will do anything to keep playing.
---
Not in a Fallout game, but in TES games, when playing as a Khajiit, you have that capacity from the get go. I think other characters can have a similar effect with potions and/or magic?
---
Some of this stuff... is a grey area and in this sub zealotry runs rampant.
---
Just search for 'fallout 76 rug trick' and you should get plenty of illustrative videos.
---
Not a bad idea. I'd spend my day just responding the "Bat" signals if those were part of the game. Sure we have the "Help" emote but that one is just for "I'm dying..." not for a "hey I could use some help from a passer by" that has a longer range.   Bethesda?
---
Ya learn something new every day, and today I learned it on reddit. :)
---
That would actually be a sick idea. If someone has a TSE, Tattered Field Jacket and Cobalt Flux in their featured you'll know they're legit.
---
Dose anyone know if it. Stacks with pa?
---
Its still DR but it does seem to provide a noticeable increase in tankiness.  Still not as good as damage reduction effects but does make a difference.
---
So fast travel spots are dependent on where you initially set your C.A.M.P. so wherever you put that thing. Don't build over it. Moving it later will not change a thing.
---
For the Brahmin make sure when you take the picture you can see the little tag of the creature pop up, you have to be pretty close.  And I‚Äôd try the reviving thing in shallow water, I did it at the shallow area of the lake by the camp with the knowledge exams.
---
Nope! I run an anti armor auto and my All Rise sledge hammer.
---
Fallout 76 is a mature oriented entertainment game. It is not an educational game for teaching children a lesson ;)
---
For someone calling other people pussies you sure do cry a lot.
---
What do you mean? In the Pip-Boy, Junk tab, you can switch to component view and untag Wood, even if you don't have any of it on you.
---
Interesting idea. I would like darker nights too, not too dark; living in the countryside I can tell that even a moonless night isn't pitch black... and oh boy, a full moon night without clouds is almost a Fallout night level of light - but beign that I play as a sneaking characters it helps me greatly when it's dark to sneak around ennemies.
---
Well, nothing would stop them from lying.
---
But I would agree, I wouldn't mind having either the ability to name the store or have some short promotional blurb.  For now, I just go by the quantities listed.  I'm attracted to stores that have a few Weapons/Armor and Plans, and if I can see that the owner has a level in the triple-digits, I know I can probably expect something good.
---
Just a note, if it matters to the story, but for me the corpse is listed as the Vault 51 Overseer.
---
no you get 12 caps for killing someone in survival the max should be 100 , 12 caps is pitiful. The cap limit was a good change but its far too low.
---
The servers are dead when I play usually 6 people on a server.
---
I do use high teir gear, I think the nerf should have been done differently but I can work with the current sent / cav armour.
---
You get them from the MODUS Armory Terminal, but it's rough. Gotta server hop, plus the mod itself doesn't tell you which slot it applies to, so you'll end up with a ton of extras after days of server hopping.
---
I'm just rebuilding my camp right now, but once I have my vending machine back up I'll have some Polymer and Lead Lined mods for 750c each (XB1).
---
Your camp fast travel point *for you* moves based on where you put your camp device. For everyone else it's pretty much dead center in the middle of camp, where you initially put it down.
---
I have found what's happening is you are spawning in before the floors have rendered so if you re fast travel right back to the same camp you load in properly
---
its a sad day to be sure, but I prefer to kill players not bases.  I just think the option should be there
---
He is around but he is much more rare. If you do the path to enlightenment event (which is at the lighthouse by the starting vault) he will show up.
---
While we‚Äôre at it, can we have a ‚ÄúPlayer X has dropped a paper bag somewhere in your CAMP‚Äù?  There‚Äôs only so much time in the day to wait for unsuspecting players to come home and discover what I‚Äôve left for them.  ‚ÄúLocked‚Äù doors.  Pffffftttt.
---
I really appreciate that you noted the reasons or thoughts behind your suggestions.  Most of the time people just say "Give me more CAMP budget." and that is all.  I enjoy reading these when effort is actually put behind it.
---
The first time I went to Point pleasant(where the mothman museum is) I ran into the thing just outside the town, weird looking creature...
---
For revive an ally, meet up with another player, they stand in some shallow water and drop a grenade, when they go down, you revive with a stimpak. 
---
The smores I got 3 from someone on here, search for it, someone will sell or give you 3!
---
You need to milk the brahmin 10 times, I found this tricky, the brahmin get annoyed lol and go angry. You can only do one brahmin once, then need to wait a while. 
---
On your map look at the daily quests, the scout ones are under ‚Äòworld‚Äô look at the mammal one and will show you how brahmin you have to go, will also show you when a photo task has been completed.
---
Yeh me to, it's never boring either. Whitesprings and West tek is the same run where as Watoga to the More is always different, you can zig zag to different locations to.
---
I've had a BE mingun, a Bloodied Combat rifle, Sentinel/Assassin armor, all sorts. Far better than whitesprings and west tek, did have my first rolling pin drop the other after 600 hours, at whitesprings lol, says it all really. If your on Xbox I'll join you one day, its a great run as you know, be different having someone with me.
---
I always seem to run into them in the Mire.
---
Alright I'll swing by
---
This game has changed 1000% since launch. I have to say, at first it was really like playing a fallout game, just a fallout game where they replaced all of the NPC's with the cast from Jersey Shore. It was like actually being a part of the show, only in the post apocolypse. LIterally nothing but super mutant jabronies with overcooked rad tans and terrible haircuts. 
---
 My first Queen fight, I thought there a bunch of LARPERS performing a live action reinactment of transformers 4. But when I finally got within mic range, the jabronies were really all strutting around like peacocks wearing volkswagon beetles, and trying to sex up the Snooki Beast Queen. It was kinda off putting, let me tell you.
---
 Anyway, in season two, the devs really upped their game. I'm guessing some of them are real big anime fans, (which would kinda explain why every player is now a big buxom girl?) because the graphics, IMHO, took a real down turn. I never pictured a post apocolyptic world to be so bright and cartoony, but  if the devs say so, I guess it's canon now. I kind of wish they would have left the super mutants alone, and not changed them all to mutacorns. And I don't think it was necessary for the scorched virus to be changed to a sparkly glitter dust, but **thats why I'm not a dev**, making the big bucks.
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our bronie role playing group, we meet every Tuesday. You'll have to find your own Sparkly Happy Princess Pony outfit (**not** to be confused with the Happy Sparkly Princess outfit, those guys are all @ssh*les.)
---
Thank you. Luckily I‚Äôm off today and wife‚Äôs running errands. Time to beat this moth to death!
---
Unless they change the rules and make it so diluted Rad-X cancels mutations too. üòâ
---
Ultracite mods boost damage to scorched enemies and overall provide a decent damage buff. The issue is changing the reciever to ultracite requires ultracite (that ammo type) which is a lot more material intensive to make.
---
I'm interested
---
I actually live far away from any town, in the Appalachian Mountains of northwestern Virginia, and while I too appreciate it being darker at night in game, it doesn‚Äôt come close to what it‚Äôs actually like out here. With no moon at night I can barely see 10ft in front of me. Much like others have said, the Mire is the closest you‚Äôll get.
---
Wrong again the Pvp servers were packed until the cap nerf now you earn no caps for killing people.
---
How is this game not meant for PvP? There is a survival server and likley a battle royale mode? Yea that's not pvp.
---
I think you need to accept that PvP is a viable way to keep people playing this game in the gaps between PvE content. Which is what I plan to do while I wait for wastelanders.
---
Plenty of shot gunners at WS and boss fights, they are super useful for large crowds and also ‚Äòtagging‚Äô for reward and XP. Pew pew guns do little damage compared to shotty, you often see people say they didn‚Äôt get any loot from the queen.
---
The option is there, if they decide to engage. Sorry you can't fulfill your weird power fantasy anymore. I don't think anyone will miss you.
---
Haha no problem! I‚Äôve heard you can kill him on this quest.
---
I saw it last time in the mire. About 3 or 5 times now. Toxic Valley as well... I don't know if they spawn only in a specific area or even daytime... but if you just want to meet one check out the path to enlightenment event at the lighthouse in the forest. The wise mothman will spawn at the end and will give you a 5% XP buff an hour. It's friendly and a good way for some snapshots :)

So the US version would go something like:
---
"Oh indestructible United States of freedom!
---
Rally to the eternal flag!
---
All hail the land of the free
---
The all-powerful UNITED STATES!!!"
---
Yep super annoying. Plus block never seems to stay up long enough. The lag tho omg it‚Äôs killing me. More responsive controller input would be great.
---
The hazmat suit is ‚Äúnaked‚Äù for some reason
---
Good to see you have some common sense. So video games can teach these things too yeah?
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can make you one, too easy...
---
It's not an ultracite Reciever, it's the normal ultracite gatling laser
---
I never keep the junk that I rarely use or is easy to get. No wood, bone, leather, etc. I keep as much as I can of springs, screws, rubber, ultracite, and lead. Most other stuff is around 200. If I'm going to be building on my camp or mass crafting I start saving more of the junk items I need. Once I'm crafting or building I drop/sell any extra of the junk I didn't use.
---
I worried a little, but then the Purveyor was kind to me. Finally. Once.
---
Vampiric Gatling for my Heavy Gunner. Yes, please.
---
How about no camera challenges in combat at all?
---
"Can't hack being beaten by superior pvp players on Survival and can't hack that you can't pick on people and destroy their camps and all that other "RIVETING!!!" stuff you like to do."
---
You literally just called me a hacker rofl
---
You seem to have misunderstood what he said.
---
He never said it wasn't a bug, but gave you the reason for why it happens. You can inspect a legendary when the owner is nearby, but when they get too far away is when the bug occurs. Never said it was "just a feature" and gave an option to help with it (turning power to the shop off removes it from the map, so someone can't shop if you're away, and so will be able to view it properly when you are there and turn on the power.)
---
I had to finish off that Wendigo with a single-action revolver since both my lever action rifle and combat shotgun broke. A dozen stimpaks later, a broken leg and arm, half of my health, and a broken T51 torso later, and I finally killed the beast with it. Needless to say, never fighting a Wendigo again unless I have all my weapons in good condition.
---
No worries man. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on the game and mechanics. Stagger and crit builds own cav and sent. Bloodied/unyielding is well bloodied and glass cannon I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for PvP - more PvE. So all the survival builds for the most part are based off sent and cav atm or vanguard. More so the first two than the later. Basically the more crits and staggers you put out it ignores the sent and cav effect. It‚Äôs even better with the only %75 chance of proc rate on these effects.
---
Yes, the game has become very cruel to griefers - but its not headed in any real direction.
---
As i've said to you in other posts, this game was sold as a pve product with limited PVP aspects.
---
Griefers found ways to get around that.
---
For example, people were told that they can ignore players trying to kill them if they want to. So if a level 60 wants to follow a level 9 around and keep shooting him he can but the level 9 wont have to worry about it unless he fires back.
---
Then after the duplication stuff started, griefers discovered ways to kill players even if they did not engage. 
---
Thus, slap damage had to be removed.
---
A new player starts 76, and decides, based on his experience on Fallout 4, wants to try camp building, but some very brave level 60+ players decide it would be lots of fun to keep destroying his work over and over.
---
He moves server, puts in some more time and calls it a night. Comes back the next day to finish up and within 10 minutes of logging in, more brave 60+ players decide to have a "pvp encounter" by destroying it all again.
---
Where exactly is the fun in the game for the Level 9 who can no longer play the game how he likes?
---
In fact, where the hell is the fun for the people destroying the base? You would want to be a special type of person to get your kicks doing that.
---
And its thanks to such brave players that removing camp damage became one of the most requested features and was implemented.
---
While you may not like the direction the game is headed, all it has been doing is living up to their original marketing by protecting players that bought the game to enjoy the PVE aspects.
---
If you are the type of player that either enjoyed killing players by exploiting slap damage with bobble heads, or enjoys destroying peoples camps just for the sake of it, then i don't think you are Bethesda's target audience and i doubt they care very much if you don't like the direction the game is headed.
---
&gt;Ammo should be 1c Each and some of these other prices for junk is stupid high, I'm not paying like 79 caps for a typewriter...
---
Almost every player vendor has ammo for 1c each just use them also typewriters and other junk are plentiful if you know where to look.
---
&gt; however I think we should aim for 1k Stash
---
800 is good... for now I'm sure they will increase this in the future.
---
&gt;A C.A.M.P. Budget increase is needed.
---
Well yes and no... it's lime stash space once you learn how to manage it it's easy to work with.
---
&gt;"Display Cases": Bethesda Bethesda Bethesda...when you announced what seems like forever ago that we would be able to use items from our stash to decorate our CAMPs, I was ecstatic. So that being said...I KNOW you aren't just gonna release display cases and call it "Decorating from you STASH" right?....RIGHT?! 
---
What else would they call it. And where else would we get the items I'm assuming this will work like vending where it marks the items you decorate with in your stash.
---
&gt;Missile Launchers .Laser Rifles\ -"_____ weights reduced by 20%" should stack.
---
Heavy weapons need an all around weight reduction. Then the legendary armor effects stacking won't matter as much
---
&gt;If you make Nuclear Winter a Battle Royale so help me god....
---
I'll equip my flaming pitchfork mod and burn some shit down. The market is flooded with Battle Royal games we don't need another one
---
One thing that Marine Armor has going for it is that the Marine Dense mod is way more common than the Dense mods for other armors.  It routinely shows up at the Watoga vendors.
---
Yes hunting players across the map murdering them never knowing what they are gonna have or if you are gonna make their group mad and they come after you is far more RIVETING than a heart emote and camp.
---
Oh my gosh really???? üòÇ Incredible
---
I tried, it - no change. üò•
---
I don't think there's any reason lorewise that we couldn't find Scorched in Power Armor.  Not everyone got the plague vaccine, obviously, and people had to be exposed before they knew to wear rebreathers, etc.
---
This would be best. PvE raid on adventure. And secondary mod with PvP arena.
---
Hail to the land of our founding fathers!
---
Hail to the melting pot of freedom!
---
Oh star spangled banner!
---
Lead us on to eternal victory!
---
OK, if it takes normal 5mm ammo then it just provides a damage boost against scorched enemies and thats it.
---
I came across a rare vendor selling the tattered field jacket, white powdered, and White springs jumpsuit...got both jumpsuits for 10k/ea. I'm drooling to find another rare outfit vendor, would love a featured of a couple items tab.
---
I've noticed those tend to be lower level players trying to get the full value from upgraded weapons. Can't fault them, but they would have better luck with selling extra chems...
---
With all the glitches of 3 star armour dropping to 1 star when logging off I wouldn't bother getting armour, too high of a risk wasting scrips that may as well be spent on weapons
---
If you're on PS4 absolutely
---
Drink more Nukashine! Who knows where you'll end up!
---
My first real fears in the game were...
---
* Near Camp Ventura with Scorched Beasts (2) circling and spraying me with that damn yellow crap.
---
* The 3 sallagasters surrounding me in that location on the edge of the Mire where all the meat was in that elevated shack. I remember pea shooting them to death over 30 mins. I can't remember the name of that shack but every time I pass it now, I chuckle as I one shot them...
---
This would make camp making so much easier! I build on cliff edges where there‚Äôs hardly enough dirt for my water purifiers. Being able to make a ‚Äúgreen house‚Äù would be so perfect.
---
rofl indeed - at your expense :)
---
here you go
---
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cant-hack-it
---
I don‚Äôt have so many mules so my play time is down to minimum, just login, sell stuff I already farmed and move on to other games. If they have anything new in the atom store I haven‚Äôt checked for days.
---
I've started collecting rare ones just as a way of spending caps, yet to find any that look good with an Assaultron Helmet though
---
What does the dense mod do? I‚Äôve only started to get out of PA so not aware of all the mods for regular armour
---
Unless you lvl up the lower ones they get less caps per item sold compared to higher lvl player.
---
If Enforcer wasn't a thing, they could have totally ruined shotgun builds.
---
It‚Äôs not pitch black at night, but I‚Äôve definitely never been confused as to whether it‚Äôs day or night...
---
I was really in the boonies and over encumbered with weapons and other junk I needed to scrap for steel when I came on a very tiny open platform base with 6 turrets  (4 dead) and bare necessities.  The base was overrun with molerats and Super Mutants.  After clearing the enemies, I repaired the players turrets, scrapped my steel and went on my merry.  This happened long before player vending, so finding a usable workbench and stash box in the middle of nowhere just when I needed it most was fortuitous and repairing this players turrets was a pleasure.
---
Pyjamas
---
Unfortunately I'm on PC... Maybe the Bethesda launcher has something. I'll take a look.
---
"Negative attention is still attention!"
---
I've encountered The High Moth of Death in two places that I remember:
---
1. Randomly in the same spot that the Responder Vendor bot spawns, on the way back across the red bridges.
---
2. Near the gate to the Whitespring golf course, down the road from the Bunker entrance, past the guardhouse that usually has a Caps Stash in the garbage can on the floor and the ballistic fiber items.
---
That's interesting too, as we know ZAX took over vault and nobody can achieve to be overseer.
---
This I repair what I find and also close doors lol I don't want someone to come and thank me by giving me stuff just pay it forward.
---
Same here. I would totally help out my fellow waistlanders.
---
I have enough common sense to know that life lessons are learned through life, not video games.
---
Video games are to get away from real life after all.
---
The sun of freedom shines through the radstorms
---
And the Statue of Liberty lit the way for us.
---
We were raised by George Washington's devotion to freedom
---
And taught to live the American dream!
---
That is correct good sir
---
love my combat shotgun for large groups or once i can't do sneak/sniper.  maybe a handmade or other weapon would be more rational but the shotguns are so fun
---
Please can you clarify and then maybe submit a PSA post to help others with your work-around
---
If half-wit super mutants can craft turrets with exploding bullets why can‚Äôt we?!
---
Actually I think Bethesda capped the caps and scrips for that very reason, ‚Äòspend time elsewhere folks, don‚Äôt let fallout 76 ruin your life‚Äô.
---
I‚Äôm fully specced for heavies but keep three points of shotgunner and full enforcer when I go into queen fights so I can cripple her with my shotty then light her up with my fe.50 cal.
---
Lol haha
---
PC users: through the use of dropping and checking mod options I've got a few extra mod pieces that I know what part they work on for polymer, deep pockets, and shadowed that I could sell or trade(need leaded). Also have a quite a few legedary urban and forrest that I'm looking to trade for a an Urban RL or Forrest RA. PM me!
---
Melee/Shotgun here - but have not used my shotty lately.  I like getting up close and personal to see them bleed.
---
Yeah, I made sure it said brahmin on the top right &amp; got nothing.
---
We did the shallow water thing w the grenade &amp; he just....died. like five times. Had ghouls attack him, molerats, no luck. All immediately respawn-only deaths. Finally had luck w a diseased mirelurk, but didn't get the accomplishment.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about 76 that‚Äôs the MODUS core, which I believe modus is a better version of a ZAX, but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
The hardest part is bringing his health low enough to finish him with the syringer but not kill him.
---
Hey where can I buy your $60 game? I figured you must have one, otherwise you'd just be throwing "should" around where it doesn't belong.
---
Also can‚Äôt lock VATS on flying creatures at all.
---
How can the level 96 Queen be worth 400 XP and a level 50 that I can take down with say 20 shots the same location after the smoke clears be 450? hmph!
---
I use a furious auto handmade and after a few shots it goes from 92 to 133.
---
I enjoy killing everyone, I enjoy a good challenge - that is literally a story you tell yourself to make yourself feel better because your build/gear/skill is garbage
---
I am using the daily quests, but it's not giving me the credit for the brahmin pic, even w the brahmin named on the photo. Glitch or am i missing something? I tried twice.
---
Well bethesda seems to respond to the crying so if you can't beat em join em I say
---
I'm actually just starting to get a shotgun build going. I always loved the double barrel shotgun in several other games, so I'd thought I would give it a go. 
---
For anyone else with a shotgun build, what perk cards should I invest in to make myself more efficient?
---
PC, otherwise I'd enjoy the company. üòä
---
But yeah, while you'll never encounter all of these, I've counted at least 10-12 different places where Legendaries can potentially show up along this route.  And maybe the staggered nature is a good thing, because you won't typically get runs of the same thing.
---
I just have a buddy fast travel to the camp, see where they spawn, and start building after that
---
Which is why you should be allowed to be robbed ;) cos its for mature people who should be able to handle it
---
Actually this isn‚Äôt true. I tested this myself and you can 100% move your camp spawn by fiddling with the camp item itself. 
---
I built a concrete foundation box inside the mire and I found by moving it around it moves the place I spawn. So doing that I moved the camp around to change the spawn inside of it
---
Mordus is way more deacriptive name than modus, haha.
---
I could hop on this weekend sometime I‚Äôm level 40
---
True, chems is not hard to get and people really buys a lot of them.
---
Btw I even saw someone selling water like he's that Diamond City Kid lol.
---
Oh, I don't think I've ever gotten one of those as a drop. I'll keep an eye out now, thanks.
---
Yeah spamming jump works most of the time if I‚Äôm quick enough
---
So I got a 3* executioners... 25% FF , 25% less vats AP....
---
Besides Flamer barrel , any recommendations on how to mod this weapon? What capacitor do you have on... I was thinking refined beta wave tuner bc of burning damage and improved hip fire..: but wanted your opinion. :)
---
you can learn lessons from anything, its very closed minded to think you can't
---
I've started the game two weeks ago. I'm level 6. I haven't encountered any griefer, all my encountered have been either brutal or positive : a high level player gifted me stuff and guided me to his camp so that I could use his workbenches.
---
I agree 100% it is a viable way for people to pass time who want to partake in it.
---
But as i've said before, there are players that are not yet finished the PVE storyline (hate calling it a story but there you go), and those perfecting their builds for bigger PVE fights such as taking down the queen solo that have no interest in such things.
---
I don't see why both types of people can't get what they want.
---
As i said originally to you - i am all for whatever massive improvements PVP players think should be applied to Survival mode to make it interesting and entertaining for you.
---
I am against it being applied in adventure mode where people have no interest in PVP and want to focus on PVE builds for PVE content.
---
I played by myself until i was level 40 something.  Then I started meeting different people and now almost always play on a team.  There are a lot of great people that play the game...and there are some not so nice ones as well.  I got hunted and killed by a 200+ player when I first started, but that was right after launch, and those type of people seem to have chilled out for the most part, or moved to Survival.  Most of the high levels like to help the newer players out however they can.  Whether you are a lone wanderer, or decide to team up with other wastelanders, you'll have a blast!!
---
I just hand out legendaries, this is fun too
---
You want Fallout 76 to teach a life lesson, yea? Fallout 76 is an M rated video games. Go pick up educational games and learn some common sense :)
---
It would be cool if they turned the Ash heap into a Silent Hill themed area. Reason I say this is cause I played a mod for fallout 4 that turned the common wealth into a legit Silent Hill experience. Constant ash clouds making it hard to see far. Which made combat a thrill again, especially when the siren went off. Cause then it got even darker and you were attacked by hordes of ghouls and I don't mean 5 or 8 I'm talking 15+ ghouls with varied degrees of level. It's nerve grinding to fight them but it made for a challenging, scary but fun experience. Just that feeling of uncertainty. Not knowing when the alarm would sound or what could be around the next corner.
---
Apparently this may be a link to *Van Buren*...
---
&gt; A ZAX unit turned on Vault 51's overseer, who eventually escaped his vault with the goal of finding help from the Vault 76 residents to shut down the ZAX. However, he died before completing that mission.

Damn, well atleast you get it.
---
That sucks I've suggested that pacifist mode protects player camps so you can keep it on until you are strong enough to defend yourself or think you are.
---
How do you get power to analyze the DNA sample? I never have any option to divert power from the generator room.
---
I was sporting the flight helmet and science uniform for a bit. Looked kind of cool, with my power fist, I looked a bit like a weird superhero lol. Might look cool with an assaultron helmet. Always could try the engineers uniform.

Surprised they haven't added a skin or outfit that displays a set of each type of armor, despite what you're wearing. Like the recent PA skins.
---
Happened to me recently at Spruce Knob in Suvival. I was teamed up with a level 26 who managed to hold his own pretty well considering. He must've thought I was nuts for taking him there. I'm mostly melee so it was torture waiting on those dudes to land. I only killed one in there air.
---
That's actually really nice and a great way to help the new vault dwellers. I'll move my camp right up there to Vault 76. Free water and food :) BTW my workshops will be open as well... no need for locks anymore
---
(Xbox) (Adventure-Mode)
---
Awh I don‚Äôt want friendly....I want to smash its face in with my hammer lol
---
I actually did know that! So sad they don't draw dragons on maps anymore.  
---
0/10 wouldn't use a dragon-less atlas again.
---
Does Repair All Structures not do this on the actual physical C. A. M. P machine? General hijack question.
---
That gold paint was a missed opportunity
---
Good lol cause I‚Äôm going moth smashing. Will update on report
---
But I love getting staggered in midair after I've jumped back really high with the help of Marsupial &amp; Strange In Numbers.
---
I don't commonly use one, however i always carry one and perk enforcer/skeet. It's my boss crippler or for when I want to see how many robots I can make explode at watoga/silo.
---
They have totally ruined shotguns, at least the 'in your face' playstyle...
---
Used to be like 'walk into the room, boom! in your face Super Mutant!'.
---
Now is like 'walk into the room, plink plink... OK I better go stealth and/or bloodied...'
---
No kidding. Enforcer is the only thing keeping me from going full melee.
---
Well, failed to find a hound anywhere near any of the 4 Behemotha I killed... yay... :|
---
Ok well this game is ment to cater to multiple play styles, as todd howard said : be who you want. I wanna kill people I don't wanna collect all the plans for the sake of it. I have a shop which servs the purpose of helping me trade to get stuff I want to make my character stronger for PvP.
---
The only thing that can one hit is bloodied and its very balanced imo
---
The f you talking about mate?
---
You answered your own question. Two different color schemes.
---
Well you're the first I know that's been able to. My whole crew tried moving the C.A.M.P. to change fast travel spots with zero effect.
---
No, it only repairs what was destroyed
---
I did that until I went to someones place that was built on top of Seneca rocks I spammed jumped right off the ledge lol
---
The mothman at the end of Path to Enlightenment is invulnerable.
---
No, I'm pretty well geared and capable. Here's one I tell myself: you crave attention in any form so post outlandish BS to get it because somebody didn't love you enough. I think it's based on a true story.
---
Yeah, I've been getting that too.
---
I've been calling it, "My Spidey-sense is glitching again"
---
Purveyor.  Better then a pool cue or rolling pin at least...
---
I don‚Äôt EVER search. If I have a keycard I go right to to that website. I usually wait until around Wednesday when they are all cracked. Though I‚Äôve seen it done on Tuesday‚Äôs too
---
Adventure mode is the answer to the PVP problem.   They can't touch you (not even reduced damage) unless you consent.   There are still the assholes who try to jump in front of your gun to initiate, so be careful with splash damage if someone is trying to be a troll.  I only see about 1 of those a week now compared to daily before.
---
Grind is still mmo annoying.   Mobs still fuck up in their spawns, or spawn on top of you.  High level players running around spawning high level shit on their way to somewhere else, making some stressful and/or impossible fights occasionally.
---
Depends on what you are looking for.  Doing story stuff should be feasible now at least.
---
&gt;Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We are aware and investigating an issue where some items purchased from the Legendary Purveyor Vendor will reduce in star quality after purchase is complete. The developers are hard at work to resolve this issue as soon as possible.  
---
&gt;**Due to tool limitations Customer** **Support** **is unable to restore items.** 
---
Yup. It's a problem. Happened to my 3\* assaultron head. You might think this would be one case where they could restore items, since there are impossible items sitting in people's inventories...
---
Well shit.
---
And why is there an explosion at the end?!
---
Yeah, this is especially problematic for me, as I am a STEALTH, low hp, melee build. I hover around 20-50 hp, to max my damage with my unyielding gear, and bloodied gauntlet. I hate this bug, if I have to swing 2-3 times to get my hits to register, I have such a high chance of getting spotted, and then murdered.
---
Component view should be part of a FAQ or something. It's something that I never even noticed before, but it's proven invaluable to untagging things I no longer care about.
---
Though I still haven't been unable to untag radstag meat or frag mines for some bizarre reason. (from some bait mission a long time ago)
---
Bolten Greens by the fountain
---
that sounds hard to be fair, I've been wanting to cop a flight helmet. I got the Assaultron Helm and Atomic  Shop Bomber Jacket atm, and I use dirt and facepaints to make my face look all camo'd up.
---
Yeah that ideas solid actually especially as ESO already has exactly that, my armour is such a mishmash of Assassin/Sentinel/Cavalier stuff that if I don't wear an outfit my character looks hideous lol.
---
So it‚Äôs literally just aesthetics? That‚Äôs lame, especially when it usually gets covered up by an outfit. But thanks for the info!
---
&gt; But this shouldn't even be a thing for a 60 bucks game.
---
I find everything so creepy in this game i have to play something happy and uplifting on spotify in the background like reggae
---
I've killed many legendaries and the 3\*s are as tough as the 1\*s, no strenght difference there. There are some starless legendaries (they have legendary in their name but are not diseased) which don't regenerate half-health and not sure if it is intended or a long-lasting bug.
---
3\* enemies used to drop 3\* only before the December 4th patch last year, but they changed it for some unknown reason. Now it seems there is a limit on the overal 3\* drop chance itself, 5% in my measurements. I also suspect luck affects the chance to see a 3\* legendary enemy - the higher the more 3\* enemies you encounter, but then to maintain the overal 5%, you'll see them drop 1\* way more often.
---
It moves the place YOU spawn, not others.
---
I agree.  I'm not kitted for pistols, but I came across a Quad Explosive Western Revolver the other day.  I gave it a Hardened barrel and took it on my run.  That thing took about 10 shots to down a single Scorched.  Couldn't believe they were *that* bad.  That same Scorched gets eviscerated in a couple shots from my Bloodied Gatling Gun.  Gee, I wonder which one I'm going to use.
---
Supposedly, if you're going to do pistols, you need to have the pistol damage perks and a hefty investment in VATS criticals.  And even then, you'll only be somewhat viable.  You'll still burn through ammo like crazy.  Neither is a direction I see my character taking.
---
There's little value proposition to pistols, but also it's so egregious that it puts me in the weird position of wondering "Should I hold onto this because they *might* buff them one day?"  The Quad effect alone is a hilarious conversation starter.
---
Dude you are truly pathetic, go play something else if this game isn‚Äôt challenging enough for you.
---
Thanks :D
---
Whatever you say man :D
---
Anytime :D
---
There was plenty in this post :)
---
Not much reason to use a shotgun over melee.
---
A temp workaround is to store &amp; replace the object.
---
Ok fair enough you want a separated PVE and PVP I can understand that for reason I said in my other post I'd like to have some presence of PVP in adventure but just make it avoidable, but to each his own.
---
What do they do with all that water anyway? I rarely bother to collect from my one unlocked purifier.
---
Does this work with non replaceable items?
---
What do you play on? I have quite a few recipes I can give you fo free.
---
In my findings, when you let the legendary re-gen fully before killing it, it helps drop the correct star weapon.
---
The cap collector perk requires you to "search" the cap stash to generate additional caps in it.
---
Glad you found the problem! That is a bit of an unusual one, did you see any 'request for memory denied' or something similar in event viewer? I would have expected disk activity to spike with page file use like that
---
I don't get it, care to explain?
---
I suppose that's why I never seem able to cripple the SBQ's wings when she's flying...
---
When prepping for the Crimson bog area I always carry 10k 5 mm but good god those ultracite shells are E X P E N S I V E with the violet flux they need.
---
Ok - i don't know where to start.
---
So players like me cried because they were "afraid" of griefers - do you understand what fear is......or what a griefer is for that matter?
---
What you griefers were doing was an exploit - not intended by the devs and thus removed.
---
As for battle royal - i think a lot of people are looking forward to such a game mode, myself included. 
---
See, what you keep missing out on here is "Choice"
---
Battle Royal will be a new game mode like survival was. 
---
I also believe that, like most other battle royal games, everyone starts with nothing so nice even battlefield where people will have ot leave the stuff they bought on ebay or had duped for them behind and play purely with skill - i can certainly buy into a game mode like that.
---
And then, on days where i feel like grinding out some ultracite ammo on adventure mode, i can.
---
Its nice to have the choice right? :)
---
As for my "sucking" at pvp in the game, actually turns out im not bad - a friend built a camp that was a fighting fit and to fight you had to equip stock armor that was provided and weapon. Food and chems were allowed and you could take whatever chems you wanted from a doggy bag in the middle of the floor.
---
I did quite well in most of my encounters.
---
See - i enjoy pvp encounters where its a level playing field - if i win i feel a sense of pride. If i lose i can learn from that.
---
I have no problem with PVP. I just also like PVE, and like to be able to choose which i am playing at any given time.
---
You though - well i figure you would run from a fight if it was on a level playing field. 
---
As for the developers and there "vision" for the game and me pulling all of this out of my ass - did you even watch the presentations for this game? Clearly not!
---
Clearly a melee build.
---
The variability of what people will pay is maddening.  I had an AA assault rifle and an instigating handmade at 150c each which no one touched so I scrapped them yesterday.
---
I mean life lessons can come from everything reading books different experiences video games conversations near death experiences there is really no limit.
---
Is crafting anything really ever that difficult?
---
While I do not know how much recoil a laser rifle should have, they do in face have some.
---

---
OP found that it was a configuration issue, what are the symptoms on your machine?
---
Give me some examples.
---
Gamertag?
---
I have seen it in watoga and the munitions factory I just have a torn wing from it but I have never seen the flat woods monster
---
I had that happen. It was after crafting another camera to see if it gave 20 film (like the first time you craft one). I trashed it and then couldn't get the original camera to work with challenges. I ended up trashing the original one and crafting a new cam/lens.
---
Not sure if that was the problem, but it works again.
---
Saw something like this a few days ago - just hoped over...
---
Visitor spawn will always be where you first placed your camp device.
---
 That event's kind of a pain. Didn't want you to waste the time, and then get nothing but a pic with a purple eyed mothman to show for it. üòâ
---
I haven't seen one since the scout events started, and dang autoscrapping burned the two mothman wings I had in my stash. I haven't been able to finish that challenge yet either.
---
Ahh so Ive been doing that wrong.  Makes sense.  Ill revise that part thanks
---
I started doing that quest the other day, and had to shoot a yao guai with Rose's special Karma med. So fuck yao guais, right, and especiially fuck making them stronger for 60 seconds. So I went to the civil war cemetary where a yao guai always spawns in the parking lot, and I've killed many of them from the safety of the balcony of the museum. Shot it with the drug, then couldn't kill it for a litlte bit as it was wandering around under the balcony. Killed it eventually, then got "quest failed" as I didn't kill it while it was still under the influence of the drug. Well the fucking quest could say "kill it within 120 seconds" and I'd have waded in and wasted a bunch of ammo and meds just to kill it. I mean, I am capable of that. FML.
---
Backpacks do not work with PA, they unequip.
---
No worries, all here to help each other out buddy.
---
Like the X-01 mods until the last patch, they're only available as mods from the Enclave vendor(s). You can't learn them by scrapping and you also can't buy or find or be awarded the plans. Hopefully they'll add that functionality in Patch 9.5 or 10 or w/e because while I like the 3\* urban scout chest piece I got from Mama Murmrgh, I won't love it until it's welded, tempered or buttressed with deep pockets just like I like.
---
Haha NOPE anything but MAD more like addicted eversince since these new updates been coming out fallout has gotten wayy better and more fun hahaha !
---
Search this sub for Mappalachia. It has everything you need
---
One of my favorite things to do is store all my gear, minus a basic combat knife, a single stimpak, and drink the shine. After I teleport it‚Äôs my goal to get back to camp without dying (no fast travel).  You can pick up anything, but you leave with just the knife and stimpak, naked. It‚Äôs quite an adventure. Lol.
---
It's analogous to the Fireproof perk in Endurance.  It reduces the damage you take from fire and explosions, but it also applies to the Scorchbeast's green Cheerios, so you can basically stand there and take no damage.  That's mainly what it's good for in PvE, since there aren't too many enemies that do explosive damage.  Obviously, that's more common in PvP.
---
I have a couple of the smores recipes. You get them from the daily at camp adams.
---
There is a PVP presence in Adventure and it is avoidable.
---
I can shoot anyone at any time to initiate PVP and they can avoid if they want to, or engage in a fight if they want to.
---
I would change one thing about that though if it was up to me.
---
Currently the player that returns fire has the advantage - i would change it so that you fire to initiate, the other player fires to accept and then have at it.
---
I can only speak for the rocketlaunchers but i am pretty sure those stayed the same rangewise. I have my camp near the Top-of-the-world-station, right next to the road. And sometimes i would shoot at the Mobs inside the raider-camp there to lure them over and as soon as they cross the gutter oft the road the rocket-turrets start to fire. Still the same
---
It's basically the same with a bit more content and lots of bugs. They fix bugs but others come out with each update. Plus the nerfs.
---
I thought that's what flares were for
---
PSA: If your camp is destroyed more than you want to repair, just move it to the same location and it will repair ALL for like 40-140 caps! woo hoo.. look my Rad shower is polished again!
---
I use a shotgun. Double barrel is my favourite.
---
I am very interested in this! I have a Scribe Sniper I‚Äôve been role playing. I‚Äôm on PC and IGN: inkpirate
---
I can't help but be attracted to melee/lever actions :(
---
Rifle build. Stealth up, sneak, get 3-4 headshots and super mutants go down, stay in stealth the entire time.
---
Shotgun build. Stealth up, sneak, empty and entire clip into a super mutant, back up, reload, fire... realize you only reloaded one shell, reload again... wait for the animation to finish, continue attacking.
---
It would also be a huge bonus if you could ‚Äúpick up‚Äù entire structures and move them like you could in FO4.
---
Your supposed to have 1 purified water and 1 canned dog food for that challenge
---
And you think people would build a camp and then decide, "ok, i'm off for a walk, but first, let me ensure my camps damage is enabled so people can destroy it while i'm away"?
---
Id bet the griefers would be the first to enable camp protection on their own while off destroying others.
---
In fact, id bet the vast vast majority would enable camp protection anyway - so what problem example do you feel you would be solving with this change?
---
Bethesda's logic makes no sense...
---
Nerf Twp Shot and Explosive because too OP in PvP = everyone just switched to Anti Armor Explosive and continue to insta kill one another like nothing ever happened
---
Melee capable of easily making a build that can kill the hardest enemy in the game (Scorch Beast Queen) solo in less than 30 seconds = perfectly balanced, nothing to see here
---
All that update did was completely destroy the late game viability of nearly all ranged weapons, while basically not affecting PvP at all.
---
Mature people don't need to learn life lesson in Fallout 76 after this thing called Real Life that made them matured beings :)
---
I do shotgun and rifle.
---
I forgot about the water and dog food! But you‚Äôre right. I leave with those 4 items.
---
Add some spotlights, get my turrets to target outside my camp bubble that way
---
Well, yes, that would have been  a Blessing in this case but NOOOOO. To add Insult to bleeding injury this was one of the rare instances where my CAMP decides to Pop up swiftly XD
---
That is the basis of this game.. "Team work"
---
Not sure.  I'll give it a try this afternoon.
---
I have one on front of house. No change.
---
Often low level, I like to invite a lowbie along. Let them get the first shot in, then wipe out the baddies. they get legendaries usable at their level, and I get scrip grind.
---
Suggestion: instead of trying to get Bethesda to change Adventure Mode, why not offer realistic suggestions and ideas for Survival Mode since that Mode is more of what you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
Work with others who want to improve the PvP experience in Survival Mode. 
---
Forget about changing Adventure Mode... the reason they made the changes was to satisfy both groups and its working well! 
---
PvPers literally have their own server to rekt or be rekted... great! Have fun! 
---
PvEers now have what they want! Great! Win win! 
---
Now fact that people can go into survival mode and come back to Adventure Mode is a joke... so if any arguments to be made is this... not exactly Survival if you can leave a survey and world type to go to a safe place. 
---
If your weapon is damaged you should have to fight to survive and fix it...
---
Food... fight to hunt and. It be hunted... real survival... but no, people have a safe place to come back and fix that character. 
---
Again, if you want PvP and survival to be better, work on that aspect and leave Adventure Mode alone, it‚Äôs a waste of time whereas they may be open to listening about improving Survival Mode.
---
I would deff spend atoms on hoods but overall I want more helmets like the Assaultron and Sentry Bot ones, love the Master Chief look
---
My man..  You get it.
---
My opinion is they need to nerf adamantium skeleton to make shitguns viable to at least cripple an opponent in pvp
---
PM'd to you
---
It does have bourbon in it.
---
That sounds super fun
---
Is adventure mode the same server as the basic game that came out where my character would be? 
---
I‚Äôve read on here that there‚Äôs adventure mode and survival mode, so they made adventure mode non-obligatory PvP and survival obligatory PvP?
---
What Windows version are you using? How much RAM do you have? What video card? What CPU?
---
Here are some tips that helped others before:
---
* Downclock your video card's core and memory clock by 100MHz.
---
* 8 GB RAM is not enough for medium-high settings. Install more or lower settings.
---
* Quit other applications and the launcher to free up more RAM.
---
* The game has trouble running with CPUs that have more than 12 threads, especially AMD 16+ cores.
---
* Verify the game files.
---
* Disable overlays of programs (Steam, Fraps, Geforce Experience, etc.)
---
pc.  damn
---
pc sorry lol
---
The Mire is dark and full of terrors.
---
No worries
---
good items in the fallout 76 market on here,  i just bought a good item for  25,0000 caps.
---
See I haven‚Äôt even started the scouts event at all. Like I said Iv just been having fun bashing things and giving stuff away to lower levels. But the only thing I haven‚Äôt smashed is that damn moth. .....maybe if I walk around with my light on it‚Äôll get attracted to it ...**hmm**
---
[https://i.imgur.com/dHgg1mz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dHgg1mz.jpg)
---
Found that on the forum, haven't tried the map though. Found him a couple times se of top of the world in the woods there.
---
Mine was always pretty good at staying outside but the other day he was inside the crafting barn somehow.
---
I did add a new vendor structure to my camp that crept into his territory and I had to move the haybales, so maybe that's why.
---
I am going to try and dress up as the hash slinging slasher
---
I‚Äôve seen it multiple times up the hill from the overseers camp. Same spot, straight up the hill near where the firecap up there is.
---
thanks
---
I'd be super happy if we could put dirt in a tub and use that!
---
Player towns and faction system seems really cool. Devs should work on em.
---
I didn't hesitate to pop a cap in him. I hate supermutants.
---
And yet you don't want to play in survival mode - odd no?
---
At least then if their group came after you they could kill you.
---
Or is that the part you don't like?
---
Because in adventure mode, it was never possible to simply hunt a player across the map unless they were either wanted or had agree to the fight with you to begin with (with the exception of the exploit with the bobbleheads) so what you are describing is something from survival mode.
---
And what is this "a heart emote and camp" nonsense - is that your way of justifying yourself as a griefer. (Have you looked up what a griefer is yet by the way?)
---
Most players i see playing are off out exploring and learning areas - you know....the way previous fallout games have worked.
---
Obviously as level 238 nothing to do
---
Gonna seem like a noob, but how do you get it?? Seeing loads on here recently. Is it just a mod like bos or is it a new armor class? I'm assuming you get it from the scout quests? Still not past tadpole atm ha
---
I'm not sure, but I have the Marine helmet and Brotherhood Officer suits for sale in mine. They look good, and are pretty uncommon, so I figured someone else who is an outfits collector would want them.
---
...also because I accidentally get extras from Super Duper every so often.
---
While I get what you're saying and completely agree they need more accessibility options
---
&gt;  I routinely lose loot because I can't see where the body dropped in the grass.
---
this has nothing to do with your eyesight limitations and everything to do with just how the game is. I lose bodies constantly, too. There's times where I'll kill something next to a landmark, make a mental note (e,g. "it's right there next to that unique tree, on the north side") and *still* lose it. A lot of times it's because the body turns to a pile of meat instantly, or in a more rare instance disappears altogether. 
---
They need to do something about hidden bodies for the sake of everyone, not just folks with limited senses. I'd accept a perk card that highlights bodies. I'd sacrifice a legendary stat on a piece of armor. I'd carry around some sort of item (binoculars, peepers, recon scope, metal detector, IDGAF) to be able to find bodies. bethsda pls
---
My main is full on shotgun üòÄ so your not the only one... thing is Bethesda fixed shot gun damage and now you need the perks for it to work well
---
Thats a real time saver yeah, i tried moving a blueprint selection but no dice :(
---
It‚Äôs crazy, it‚Äôs been proven time and time again that there‚Äôs **huge** money in weapon skins. Yet they continue to ssslllllooooowwwly trickle out skins for the least popular weapons in the game. 
---
If I was in charge of the Atom shop we‚Äôd be a veritable skin factory dropping skins as fast and frequently as possible for the Handmade, Combat Shotgun, Super Sledge, both gauntlets and Power Fist. Just sign your paychecks over to us.
---
I still use my TSE combat often. However I use it to cripple a group of enemies then finish them off with other weapons. 
---
In reality I can sell my TSE and use any other gun because I just use it to cripple enemies.
---
See I‚Äôm new to the forum too, haven‚Äôt figured how to search old posts. People like you give me hope for this world. You weren‚Äôt a asshole, mocked me, or told me‚Äùgoogle it bro‚Äù .you went out of your way and spent time finding that for me. And for that I truly thank you!
---
We need this stickied lol
---
Shadowed Mod I bought from bunker when attached, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúshadow‚Äù the armor like other shadowed mods or plans, meaning darken. 
---
I attached this to a chest piece and it remained the forest pattern. I thought it would look dark as it does for combat armor. 
---
Not sure if this is a bug or what...
---
I had a spot, failry early on, that had a great view and almost never had random spawns attacking. I liked it, but one day I moved. And now I can't find that spot again. I realized I always fast travelled in, and don't remember how I got there the first time. Since the view was not of a specific landmark like whitesprings or the antenna, I have almost nothing to go off of.
---
Yeah, even when you're Lv. 200, there are two types of enemies that still command your respect.  One is Colonel Gutsy.  The other is a hoard of Mirelurk Kings.
---
OP made a statement "X shouldn't" while having nothing to backup the claim other than his/her own expectations. It's exhausting enough to maintain a civil dialogue about criticisms of the game, lumping in personal expectations and extending them to "ALL GAMES" just to express dissatisfaction is circular, and small.
---
Considering Power Armor is garbage for PVP, you probably just don‚Äôt have much experience fighting Sentinel. Stagger them, Crit them if they aren‚Äôt sneaking, we die really quick that way.
---
Server hopping whilst directly in front of the main entrance didn‚Äôt work for me. I think it‚Äôs got a trigger. Try logging out at the golf club or train station and run over. I probably server hopped at the main entrance 20 times with no luck.
---
‚ÄúDrop your nukes and I shall drop my pants‚Äù title of your sex tape.

Different colors of Asylum outfits, BoS gear, Hunter's Long Coat, Spacesuit (both clean and otherwise), Responders Fireman Uniform/Helmet, Leather Coat (both regular and Traveling variants), Tattered Field Jacket, Whitesprings &amp; White Powder Jumpsuits, etc etc etc.
---
Upvote for respect.
---
Thursday which is payday I‚Äôm buying you a medal(would be sooner but wife likes to spend everything all at once) Simple as that. First place I was near on that map i found that bitch and we danced a good dance. Thank you again
---
At the terminal in the room with the silo status and code words, you can request a mission to recover a silo piece and specify which silo. You can also request a nuclear keycard recovery mission. You can have as many cards as you want - they are categorized under ‚Äúmisc.‚Äù (apparently they‚Äôre made of some kind of ultra-dense material found in the heart of neutron stars based on the weight vs size, though). You need to have at least one to launch, and the card will work at any of the silos. The typo-prone might want to bring more than one card.
---
Before I launched my first nuke, I went through those recovery quests in rapid succession to get all the pieces so I could do the manual decryption once. After that, I figured I‚Äôd done a proof of concept and was good with just using codes on nukacrypt. 
---
When it‚Äôs time to do your launch, you want to have a bunch of steel and at least 30 circuits in your stash or with you. 3* lockpick and 3* hacking are advisable if not required. Bring a lot of ammo and some food and drink - it can take a while to make it to the launch room.
---
Are you going for the quest item where you need the mothman wing?
---
try wearing sunglasses?
---
L26.... Yea! Good job with the Wendigo.
---
I am actually at the point where I can one shot crit a SM with my lever from a comfortable distance.
---
I cannot say the same with my shotgun unless I am using the muzzle to give him an enema.
---
May as well go melee and do the same with less hassle and 0 ammo cost.
---
Our Walmart is weird, sometimes you go in and all games are half price or less, ive gotten rdr2, fo76, and a couple switch games for 30$ or less each, but even just a few hours the games will all be back to their normal 80$.

Yeah, see I'm not mad about 3* wood armor, hell I was wrapped with it tbh. Added more to roleplay. But I'm pissed as hell being charged for a  guaranteed 3* and essentially getting a 1*.
---
I initially got my first piece going through the enclave quests. It‚Äôs dropping a lot for me from the purveyor when I buy 3* legendary armor. I assume it could drop from any legendary creature, but that‚Äôs where my knowledge stops.
---
Nope. Just a good ol beating
---
As I understand it, assassins isn‚Äôt that good for anything. And even if it was, your want it on a better weapon.
---
But a mole miner gauntlet with swing speed and +1 strength would be a great first max level legendary for someone making an unarmed build. You‚Äôll probably sell it if you put it in your vendor for 500-1k.
---
I never saw the spinning pictures and I likely sniped all the ghouls before entering.
---
But the shaking and screaming did freak me out. I ran around trying to find the source of the scream.
---
Eventually I gave up like "Fuck this haunted place" haha
---
dont worry bout it dude just take it slow and bring a lot of ammo and wear a power armor
---
Oh, okay. I was going to offer the wing so you could complete it.
---
I have come to appreciate Exterminator weapons.
---
Mirelucks die a lot faster....
---
I run a vampire combat shotgun, the damage isnt the best, but the fact that I damn near invincible when using it is pretty nice, my main weapon is a gatling gun though.
---
Yes I did use that one. And yet another bug that works against the player Lol. Would love to encounter a bug that gives me twice the Scrip üòÑ
---
It wouldn't surprise me if the same bug is responsible for an inordinate number of 1\* drops from 3\* enemies too.  Getting a 1\* is always a possibility, yes, but when certain items arbitrarily can't have 3\*, and those items are obnoxiously common drops, what are the odds that players are simply being robbed by an ill-conceived drop list?
---
Nah wood armor in itself isn't inherently bad, especially if you're stealth. But the stars reverting and the fact you're charged for a guaranteed 3* is bad
---
People will pay 500 caps all day long for them
---
I think it's just to put a limit on how fast the economy explodes. They have their own base prices for legendaries, stimpaks etc and you can already see player prices ballooning past that. I think it's to regulate the economy and keep value within intended range.
---
That's a shame. Would look terrific with the shadowed effect.
---
I generally get scrip before going to her.
---
I -love- the enforcer perk, I usually play a shotgun/melee style where I get into medium/close range and cripple the enemy with my shotgun, then finish them off with a bloodied Grognaks Axe. 
---
For a long time I was mainly using an exterminators explosive, but I just recently picked up a faster fire rate/anti-armor combat shotgun, so I‚Äôm set.
---
Yah super agreed about the Daily and Weekly challenges... I've posted about that several times. It has become way too ridiculous and specific and time consuming. Ppl that say it's free nyah nyah aren't coming at it in good faith. We're putting in the time and effort and staying with the game and playing the game and filling their servers and contributing to events to make the online mmo-lite world go round. 
---
Daily and weekly need to be simpler formats. Kill 10 mutants in the Forest, Drink 10 beverages, Kill 10 robots in Watoga, Claim a workshop, join 5 events (no requirement that they succeed, just participate), stuff like that.  Where it is more generic and open to let all players of all levels to have options on how to come at them. And not being something that needs hours and hours of a day just for 10-30 atoms. 10-30 atoms up against overpriced atom shop stuff that is a lot of repainted and retextured and recycled things that aren't worth 10-14 bucks.
---
I suggest sending feedback directly to Beths support saying that you have *common sense* and want *life lesson* in their Fallout 76. I am sure they will hear you.
---
That is a damn good point.
---
Yeah the "welcome friends" sign from the atomic shop is a huge disappointment
---
Same on Xbox, it will often even display 95% yet nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at alllll
---
I would recommend r-placing the object you scrapped just in case you log back in and find your budget 'magically' filled.
---
Same here, I had to pull half of my RAM because one kit wasn't stable ( 2x Kingston 12GB triple channel kits) and drop any OC on my GPU. Fallout 76 was the only thing I've ever encountered problems with on this system - and it was really bad; random blue screen, crash to desktop, hard freeze with black screen when bringing up the map, not to mention in game problems. I knew better than to blame the game at that point though.
---
Rendered with Blender fine, made and transcoded videos, played Fallout 4, passed benchmarks and Prime95/Linx etc. without issues. Memtest 86 found the memory issue after a few hours; but testing 24GB of ram one 4GB stick at a time, then in pairs, then in triplets to narrow it down is annoying.
---
Glad to finally have it working flawlessly!
---
ahh - i need SB meat for a recipe i need for tadpole/possum{?} challenges. Time to set up the Barby and put some nummies on the grill.
---
Most people that have come across my base will remember it for the 20 water purifiers I have and the 2.1 fusion reactors I need to power these things!
---
I actually drink only Inert Flux. That is nuked flora that has "expired" and turned to Inert Flux. It gives you also a 5% disease resistance. So directly after that I eat the spoiled meat. With the carnivore mutation you need less of these to satisfy your hunger.
---
Soooo... I ONLY use the purified water to dilute down the radaway and stimpacks. With the chemist 1 and Super duper 3 I get a 1 to 4 dilution.  I carry about 150 diluted stimpacks (Traveling Pharmacy 3)  and I sell off the rest of the diluted radaway and stimpacks. Makes pretty good business sense.
---
I like all of these ideas. I really wish we could move around ragdolled bodies, though. Definitely like the perk system idea, I don‚Äôt want to be changing more tedious shit.
---
-Make a PvP build
---
- rarely have problems with PvP
---
Just joking although it's true, most people wouldn't agree with this option.
---
If you get back on and play on PS4 lmk and I'll set you up with some stuff
---
Absolutely go for it. I played my first 100hrs solo for the most part. It‚Äôs a fun game, especially now with the additions, minus some reoccurring bugs and such. I still love the game.
---
I would do that, except there aint no wood there or scrap wood.
---
I've tried the regen urban legend, doesn't seem to have made a lick of difference for me. Lots of 3* still dropping 1* dross.
---
Yea I knew there was urban scout from enclave, but I didnt think you could get legendary versions up until seeing it on here loads recently. Is bos still the best dr or is this top of the class now?
---
Or give us like a list of 10 Dailies and we get to choose 5 of them to complete for a max of 50 atoms a day or w/e. Doing any other dailies above those 5 won't give atoms as rewards but a handful of caps.
---
Honestly, it's like elevation is completely ignored by melee enemies.
---
i regularly use it, but somehow wood got tagged without me tagging it and i can not untag it as it is not in the component view. Halp.
---
yeah that kind of does not work, wood aint there anymore....
---
Okay, fair enough. 
---
But expecting features to work in a user friendly way and not more broken than their last fallout game  also seems fair imo.
---
Fallout 4 didn't have so many unnecessary restrictions while building. I get it they are put there with a reason but the way it is put there seems like a huge downgrade. Pay more, get less isn't a principle i like to get comfy with. 
---
Enjoy your day mate
---
Yes. Melee vats is broken. It is especially broken for vats melee vs flying creatures. Bethesda knows. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
I really enjoy it now and try to find at least one which time I play. Wish we could cross platform.  Maybe Sony will pull their heads out of their butt sometime.
---
You can't vats flying creatures anymore, hopefully it's a bug.
---
Also your path has to be totally clear of objects for you to use vats.
---
So annoying. I just stopped trying to vats anything on my melee character.
---
Walls carry power. You have to play around to get this to work with switches and lighting. You can have multiple switches for different walls. Else run the wiring through a window or doorway, select the wall and hit R and T to replace. Select wall and it will replace it leaving the wiring.
---
Before the purveyor you could get non-legendary scout armour from the Enclave bunker and from Enclave events like Dropped Connection. Now you can get legendary scout armour from the Purveyor but as far as I know nowhere else.
---
&gt; I'd carry around some sort of item (binoculars, peepers, recon scope, metal detector, IDGAF) to be able to find bodies
---
The Prosnap Deluxe Camera will do this.  It tags locations and enemies (even dead ones) with text in the upper right hand corner of the view screen.  Any time I'm having trouble finding a corpse, I pull out my Prosnap and start walking around until the tag pops up.
---
I'd say that, yes, it's annoying.  But I'd also say that the lag works both ways, and *your* reach is also much longer than you think.  I notice it the most when I'm doing One Violent Night and the Ghouls are lunging at the jukebox.  If I start swinging from halfway across the room, it will still count as a hit on them.
---
I can‚Äôt speak on that, sorry. I play a stealth build, so my armor is a hodgepodge of stuff to buff that. My goal is to not get hit at all.
---
I have had this happen as well. I still have my armor... I never modded it.  It switched to a 1 star after a logou/ login.  I want my 100 scripts back.
---
how awesome would it be if you could be x amount of something to force them to your camp 1 time a day lol
---
Didn't get ant meat, just lungs, hearts an brains.  There should be a recipe for Scorchbeast haggis.   (Although SheepSquatch haggis would make more sense).
---
Best place for meat is Watoga -- look in the Scorchbeast nests, they seem to leave their meat lying around.
---
I was glad to get the plan only then disappointed after not being able to place the wall cabinet other than in roof or floor...lol
---
With the hardened receiver and other perks in the strength SPECIAL, you can pump that up to +250 damage per shot (with bloody mess perk)
---
Ah thank you though. I haven‚Äôt even started the boyscout quests lol
---
Caviat Emptor, bitch.
---
I would love a notification like "blank destroyed your base" if you come back and everythings gone
---
For now at least adventure mode characters can cross into survival and vice versa. So it doesn't matter what server you pick. 
---
&gt; so they made adventure mode non-obligatory PvP and survival obligatory PvP?
---
Yes just make sure to turn passive mode on
---
Would it be nic
---
Only if someone occupies my camp location and I don't server hop..
---
If your doing the pioneer scouts robotist the heavy plans don't count only the "light" versions
---
Not at all. They just need to look somewhat like her so I guess it‚Äôll just be trial and error then.
---
When i was like level 30 and i would take thunder mountain all the time 1-3  scorched beasts would show up sometimes before i got turrets up and the would wreck me. But if your defences/turrets are well spread out scroach beasts are pretty easy goingg for melee characters.
---
The fucker had spawned by the lumber yard in the top left corner. I used to have my camp in the pond with the safe a little east of there. And I would get scorch beasts, flatwoods monsters, and mothmen spawning.
---
It's the inverse actually.  Before this unwanted stuff would be sold to vendors where others could but it cheap.  Now causal players have a drastically smaller chance of getting a decent one since it drop/purveyor only.
---
I used to be shotgunner for 4+ months, but switched to Heavy Weapons for variation and have not looked back.
---
Glad it helped!
---
Start with the general shape of the face first. Cheeks, jawline, ect. Then fill in the eyes, nose , and stuff
---
Yeah I‚Äôve started the swing way ahead of time too, but that‚Äôs just to compensate for the slow swing speed.  It helps some but when they can hit me from across the room that‚Äôs an issue. I‚Äôll have to see if I get hits on them while they are still a long ways away because I haven‚Äôt noticed that. 
---
 Are you running PC, Xbox, or PS4?
---
I really hope they don't do this, starting off the game and running around the forest with the pip-boy light was not a great way to experience the world.
---
Duper destroyed legendary ranged weapons. All Bethesda did is nerfing whatever that's been duped and sold most. But dupers already made their quick bucks and their buddies' YouTube channels raked in handsome cash. Bethesda has been so ineffective in fighting parasites so they basically have to shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly.
---
I will do that thanks
---
Inert flux also weights slightly less then purified water and satisfies the same amount (I believe).  And I do the same with the purified for Rad-X and RadAway.  Don't usually bother on the stimpacks but your right...for the 1:4 ratio it would make sense.  Then again I'm usually hitting vendor cap limits already.
---
Ha! I'm bloodied, so same.
---
I have quite a few pieces already since I‚Äôve been only buying armor with my scrip. 
---
The armor has different abilities that I haven‚Äôt found (yet) on the other. 
---
One left arm grants the ability to breathe underwater and I haven‚Äôt seen it on the other style yet as well as some on the other style isn‚Äôt on the other. 
---
So forest and Urban May have different abilities that the other doesn‚Äôt. Can‚Äôt say for sure yet but so far it looks that way with the 11 pieces I have.
---
  Personally, I don't think its anywhere near as messed up as some outlets would lead you to believe.  Like any other FO game, it's not perfect, and it does have some quirks.   
---
Even so, its still great fun to play, solo or with a team.
---
I've been playing since January...most of it solo; only been within the last month I started teaming up with a couple of specific players.
---
Human nature being what it is, there will be occasions where you run across someone who wants to role play as a bad guy raider.  Server hop usually takes care of that real quick
---
Damn. Talk about bad luck. When I first started my camp I Stupidly built by a fissure (didn‚Äôt explore it first) had plenty or SB and deathclaws wrecking my shit. Now I‚Äôm on a cliff, most I‚Äôll EVER get is a mole rat and my turrets dispatch them real quick
---
oh really tell me more?
---
You can bet if it was a bug that benefited players that they'd have hotfix patched that really quick. Like if the Purveyor was giving ppl 3 star armor when buying 1 star armor.
---
I would really like to be able to tell when it is night. It is always way too bright. We should have darkness or at the very least a way to determine gamma ourselves to really make those glowing ones pop
---
I went to see biv and had a wave of nostalgia remembering when everyone dropped known plans in the metal box...I was gonna do it again last night but saw a lvl 60ish with a camp near by so I gave the plans to them since I don't have a vending machine setup. They kindly dropped mean few stims in return.
---
Far cry: Primal level of dark would be amazing. So dark that all you can see are bullets
---
I cant build them anymore because I need that budget space, but when I did build them my biggest complaint was that about 75% of the time they‚Äôd refuse to go hot. A level 1 Scorched could stand right in front of it hitting it with a pipe and it still wouldn‚Äôt strike.
---
I see. I just assumed it was from the scout missions because of the amount I'm seeing people post. Pretty happy with the set I have and wont be wasting scrip on armor until they take fix the bug with wooden armor ha

People often ask: If the hero in FO1 was the Vault Dweller, in FO2 it was the Chosen One, it was the Lone Wanderer in FO3, the Courier in FO:NV, the Sole Survivor in FO4, who is the protagonist in FO76?

The Oversleeper.

It happens most of the time on any creature, flying or not. There is nothing in between us.

I -really- want these put in.

I run an arcade on PC that hosts tournaments for the various holotape games on Thursday nights. 
---
We also keep a scoreboard in a google doc, but having the high score on a cabinet would be awesome.
---
If you have decent power armory and others are there any level is worth a shot. I went in pretty early reviving players and shooting the queen with what I could.
---
There‚Äôs always a camp you spawn under the floor and can‚Äôt move...lol happens every day...
---
About lvl 50 with power armour and tons of ammo an health.
---
I really wish they had food you could make that was essentially non spoiled. e.g. If I was in a post apocalyptic world I think we'd make a lot of jerky and other things that could last a while because you never know what would happen. That way there could be more chefs in the wasteland.
---
I hate both King and Wendy's... but its sooo funny to see how many get a hard time in the cave. I never had a hard time with it so I'm guessing its the perks and equipment? But yes BIG B and the bear are crazy too. Just be glad they IMHO nerfed the Mire Queen at least on the poison and the baby breeding. And WOW at that level indeed.
---
I‚Äôve used it like that a couple times, and it helps but it could be a lot better. Highlighting or beeping to indicate proximity would be a much bigger help.
---
If you cripple its wings, it forces it to land.  If there are scorched adds around, you can also kill all of them and make sure you are on the ground in an open area.  They won't usually land if you're under tree cover or ducking in and out of buildings taking potshots.  They also won't usually land if you're on the roof of a building or outhouse.  You basically have to use yourself as bait and make yourself as enticing as possible.

There‚Äôs always time for bohemian rhapsody my friend. Seriously though, are you thinking group or solo?
---
Please dont
---
I must try this. Some day I‚Äôll get my storage sorted out and will have enough space to store everything. Need to drop prices on the items I‚Äôm selling I guess to make them move faster.
---
i first went to the event itself when i was lvl 30 or so, just make sure you have power armor. If you want to launch the nuke, i honestly didnt have any trouble at level 50 so you can probably do it a bit earlier
---
It works if you have enforcer. If a single  projectiles reach the wing, even with minimal damage, there is a chance to cripple the wing. If the game registers that you hit the wing, you can cripple it
---
I sort of have a similar setup: I have a vendor that‚Äôs targeted towards more casual players, with recipes that are exceedingly cheap because I they‚Äôre pretty common. I also have keep my water purifiers unlocked.
---
A have a different vendor for more experienced players that sells energy ammo, fusion cores, black titanium and ultra it‚Äôs scrap, recipes that I think are more rare, etc. This is in a more ‚Äòluxurious‚Äô area, but the prices are still slightly under what I consider to be market value, just because I want to sell my stuff quickly and the area my shop is in doesn‚Äôt get a lot of traffic.
---
I really like your idea of free beginners stuff, and if I saw your shop I would probably go out of my way to buy something, just because I always appreciate people that go out of their way to help the community.
---
This would  be a great addition  to the nuclear winter road map the only  thing I would add would be to ask for a trough to grow tarberries

I know the pain
---
I‚Äôm a loner and having fun. I‚Äôm a casual as well, got to feed those ex wives. It‚Äôs enjoyable besides all the bugs, glitches, and  stupid camp building rules. Most of the griefers are gone out of adventure mode but they still pop up from time to time. We are getting people playing raiders now so be weary. I think it‚Äôs good for the game if you like the immersive feel of being on the edge. The stash limit is still a pain in the a**.  The backpack is a great add though.

Step on in. Oddjob 452p on PS4

I gave up my shotgun build (never had a TSE shotty). I felt like I was spending more time reloading and tickling the enemies. I had to get up close and personal, and the damage I dealt was trivial. Swapped to a rifle build, and could pick off most targets from a distance before they ever saw me.
---
Shotguns are lacking in any sort of real damage unless you have a god tier weapon, and even then you're limited.
---
Nope. Ed-E was working for enclave at other state at that time (or even didn't existed) and dogmeat was not born.
---
Ah ok, I didn't notice that. Seemed like a lot more than 60%. My foods used to die in minutes, now it takes days. Also love how you get downvoted for every comment on this sub.
---
I wish we had a way to mark junk to prevent scrapping it during crafting. Why do you want to scrap my souvenir toy sloth for lead when I have 7 bulk lead, Bethesda? If I'm not careful, I'll scrap all my collectables. Once we get displays will they be protected?
---
Well, bloodied is the current meta on pretty much everything. The damage in glass canon builds is stupid. Personally, though, I run a fists build, with twisted muscles, talons, and iron fists. I have an instigating SS, a furious SS, and a vampire's SS power fist, all used for different scenarios. Each hits for around 400 points ignoring armor, before the legendaries and other perk benefits. My armor is all bolstering +1 strength, so I sit around 23 strength. I have never had problems with an enemy, or a player that wasn't just invisible. :D
---
Oh i know powerarmor is crap for pvp
---
Oh indeed i dont have experience in pvp since i avoid due to broken legendary armor that make pple unkillable 
---
To stagger or crit means i have the luck of rng gods with me  with heavy guns . Meanwhile they can oneshot me so kinda pointless with bloodied explosive weapons with nerdrage.  sure you can die but it is hard  mix that with ch

---
Yup. Ran into her while at watoga, she was stuck in god mode and proceeded to wreck my shit
---
Anyone realize how the legendary scrapper seems to have a similar design to the CoD Pack-a-Punch machine? Both big colorful boxes that you slot your weapon into the grinders. Except one plays a neat jingle and the other replicates the noise of a Transformers gang bang.
---
Other perk cards can correlate with this idea already, So maybe ammo smith could be required on top of home defence to give you the option to change turrets ammo types, while gunsmith can give the option to craft more unique version such as wall mounted and/or laser turrets requiring science still. And than i wanna add being able to set Weapon traps ass well.
---
I have a two-shot combat rifle in my stash.  I shall now rename it "Oversleeper's Guardian".  Thank you.
---
But super deadly. No lvls. Drop health much quicker. 
---
Just a thought. I hate the cartoon like way pvp games are mostly. Games like dayz/Eft are exciting in pvp. Rising storm2 finds that good balance between those games and cartoon mega health pools of most fps games. you lvl up to get access to newer better weapons but your pistol is just as deadly as a day 1 character. You go about your days in the wasteland but now everyones is a threat. Not just triple diget players who you never see or use autoaim
---
What is there to "unpack"?
---
Only gun I carry.  Goes great with my melee build for crippling yogi's or shooting down cargobots or just reaching out and touching those roof running Scorched or Super Mutants.
---
If you can find a fire axe with swing speed they are actually pretty damn good. I use a combo of fire axes (bloodied and AA), a bloodied swing speed super sledge, and bloodied swing speed pole hook. Personally I prefer the poll hook for ghouls as it has more reach than the others, but the sledge and axe do a hell of a lot more damage so I usually use those for everything else 
---
Honestly though, if I had to do it all all over I would go unarmed, meat hooks, and gauntlet seem to be where the real damage is at.
---
You will definitely need a team and should coordinate strategically how you will do it. That being said the only way to do that is to have experience fighting her. Unless you premeditated your build expertly from the start you should wait until around level 70 and give it a go with some friends. Don‚Äôt be upset if you aren‚Äôt able to complete it successfully just learn and try again sometime.
---
we don‚Äòt need the exact same Ed-E, just another eyebot model. they were amazing followers. never standing in the way, turning invisible when sneaking, funny noises, etc. there are other eyebots in the game, lorewise we could just hack them. 
---
and how do you know dogmeat wasn‚Äòt born? we don‚Äòt know where dogmeat‚Äòs from. dogmeat could be an immortal entity for all we know.

From the purveyor I got two radium rifles in a row, two pipe revolvers in a row. If you don't like what you see in the first try, hop server because you might get another if you stayed.
---
There's one at The Whitespring. I shot it from as far away as possible. then got a hit or two in with my rifle. Hauled ass back to one of the gates and let the guard bots kill it for me, haha.
---
I have a 3-star assaultron head, which I looted from one of the bots in Watoga weeks ago, and it still has 3 stars. I haven't tried scipping it, but I got another 2-star assaultron head from the Purveyor 2 days ago which now has only 1 star. I don't know if the problem is just with the Purveyor or weapon/armor drops in general, as I haven't had a 2-3 wood armor piece or legendary assaultron head drop in since the last patch.

It is you have to remember this game is still really a hot mess, but they are at least seeming to try to make it better. But its still built on a code that was SO bad a player mod was made that was well over 3gb to fix the bugs and that was for single player, so just think how bad things have to look when making changes to it in online version it was NEVER made for.
---
So base resistances might not change, but legendary effects might be proprietary? That‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt consider since ‚Äúarmor is armor.‚Äù
---
Looking at the lore timeline it's very plausible dogmeat can be immortal... Or at least very long living dog.
---
Particularly up in t'north. The desert regions tend to be bright *enough*, but still rather dark.
---
I do have a section for ‚Äùdiscerning‚Äù clientele. But it has to be truly rare stuff. God roll weapons, outfits that can only be found on the traveling vendor bot, rare paint and weapon plans. These things sell every day for 2K+
---
Lol. I‚Äôm not mad. Not surprised. Just disappointed.
---
Someone previously mentioned wanting dogs and for them to play together when players interact. I have to admit to really liking that idea.
---
That definitetly seems like the Bethesda developers would design it.  Beacause why have a tremendous weapon modding system that would work with legendary effects.  Can't give us too many benefits. lol
---
The current top meta is a Bloodied swing speed +1Str weapon that is either fast or slow. Medium speed weapons have fallen to the wayside. However, for fast weapons furious and vampires are pretty nice and for slow instigating works well too. My favorite is a low health vamp build on a fast swing weapon. Nice damage output and the vamp effect keeps your hp steady.

or if not Dogmeat, we could have another cybernetic dog like Rex in NV. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

the possibilities are endless here, i just want something cool to keep me company
---
My TSE shotty dropped way after 'the great rebalancing' and the fact that they reduced two-shot to 1.25 shot but left the accuracy penalty untouched made it... risible.
---
I was however very fond of both my AAE combat and my QE double barrel. Now I'm going around with a suppressed AAE pump-action... and I am finding the playstyle... lacking when I can do the same better and more effectively in another toon with a lever.
---
Still, I can cripple stuff and force it land/stay put so I have that going for me I guess.
---
I'd say for dollar vs hours, there's value to this game. Is it perfect? Nah, but I still play it and enjoy it. I am more of a trader vs. a  player now, but I have fun finding deals and selling things. I'd say there are games you can beat in a day and FO76 is not one of them.

I'm building a run and gun shotgunner right now, so no
---
I like this idea
---
Did you and Natasha ever get Moose and Squirrel?
---
I should move closer to Flatwoods, probs. I don't know how much lowbie traffic I actually get - I'm currently between Camp McClintock and Summersville.
---
I just don't want to waste a free FT point. I like being sort of in the middle of the map so I can get anywhere fairly cheaply.
---
aww that would be wholesome. every fallout had a doggo, to me it feels weird without one
---
Got canned dog food from it, caps, card packs
---
Its forsure mods or ini files you need to fix
---
 I am personally waiting for a "Golden Grognak Axe" skin. Though if it could be applied to any melee weapon, I would drop more atoms on that.
---
Honestly just getting rid of wood armor would be fine. It‚Äôs not effective without shrouded and that‚Äôs as a joke
---
I have a similar issue that I've been ignoring, I somehow have carrots tagged for search :P  No idea how it got there, no idea how to fix it.  But I never miss looting carrots!
---
Thought about going into the game files and seeing if I could manually untag it, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
---
I'm glad you were able to get this requirement knocked out in such a wholesome way!  
---
I and a fellow Vault Dweller teamed up and simply jumped off a tallish C.A.M.P. into shallow water.  The first time he just died (splat) but the second time I was able to stim him and get the requirements for both "Revive an Ally" and the one for swimming (something about saving a drowning person?). 
---
It shouldn't have to be so hard...
---
You must have entered a pvp mode some how not throwing ideas out there because i dnt want ppl trying them but a buddy of mine framed me for attacking whisperings due to my mutations hitting surrounding area quite funny but a dick move lol
---
I don't think the preferential thing is real, unless she prefers to give me stuff that I don't have any. So far blew 1800 scrips on ranged weapons, got suppressors, nocturnal, junkies, hunters, stalkers, and ghoul slayers, I don't have any of those prefixes, all I have is bloodied, AA and TS, none of those ever dropped by the purveyor for me.
---
Same for me (on Xbox)
---
Regular auto guns also stagger. So does Melee. 
---
I run a sneaky Bloodied commando Sent/ass build, the only reason I win most of my fights is a single piece of Chameleon gear keeping me hidden. I still die super easily. Sure, I one shot people, but I‚Äôm often 1 shotted just as easily. 
---
Honestly once your comfortable with how to fight against Sent/Ass/Cav sets, it makes life a lot easier and PVP more enjoyable since you know exactly what they‚Äôll do. Stand still or die, or constantly sprint or die.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I seldom play my melee because of this. Bloody 2-hand relies on stealth and one-hit kills to survive. A big *WHOOSH* is not stealthy.
---
Some additional hints and to summarize what others have said:
---
The point at which you fast travel to your camp is pretty random and is based around where your camp object currently is located. You can kind of manipulate that by relocating your camp within the edges of your buildable area, but it's very difficult and totally unpredictable. Not worth the time unless you spawn off the edge of a cliff or something.
---
The place where others spawn into your camp is dead center of the build area. Which is the same place where you initially set down your camp object.
---
If you've since moved your camp object and can't really find the center, either have a friend FT to your camp so you can see the spot, or just guess, and stand nearby until someone shows up to buy something. Then, drop a corn or tato plant on that spot. It won't interfere with someone loading in and will give you a visual marker of where to build around. Then remove the plant once you are sure you know where the spot is and have built around it.
---
Yeah, this is happening with Assaultron Heads too. It's removing their primary effect. I got a 3\* Executioner's with 10% aim and +1 agility. Logged out, and it was a "Salvaged Assaultron Head" with two stars. Sigh... I was actually excited to try it out lol
---
I don't have anything actually worth the cap prices I charge at that single vendor. XD
---
Like I have the t-shirt and jeans for... 150c? Because it reminds me of how dumb it was when people spent stupid money irl for a white t-shirt just because Kanye West was selling it.
---
But really I'm sure they assigned a intern that stop having good ideas months ago and is just trying to see what crazy stuff we actually will try. Complete this naked and drunk, he's just wondering around at lvl 420 and watching us do the stuff he came up with high or drunk over the weekend.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a bar in the atom shop?
---
Yeah, this happened to mine as well... Just became a Salvaged Assaultron Head. What a bummer..
---
Don't think there is. The example you gave, at least from my expereience, only really shows up as a quest when i go to that Halloween shop every couple days or so.
---
No games, that's for sure.
---
Im still pissed that they have not fixed this yet...
---
I love this cave!  I know it in and out (went through it twice)  
---
sadly, I'm on the superior system.  #PS4masterrace
---
*Faster Opening Speed
---
*32 oz. For the price of 24 oz.
---
*Contents reduced 90%
---
get a bloody lever and you dont even need to use crit or headshot. that 2.5x sneak will oneshot most anything in the torso.
---
 With all the new restrictions on griefing and the new camp protections it's much friendlier to casual players. Most of the community are really awesome folks looking to have fun and eager to help new players out. Jump in! The water is fine!
---
i did not know that thanks for the info good sir
---
I just want a proper pirate skin for my power armor, that harpoon gun needs a theme!
---
If you play in Adventure Mode, you're good. Other players can't wreck you or your shit unless you choose to engage (except at Workshops you claim). Nukes tend to only hit specific areas that are best for farming, so no issues there either.
---
I've been playing where my goal is just to build a nice camp and explore. I've been having fun. It's great to run around solo and also nice to visit other peoples' camps and have an impromptu concert if they have instruments available. Or to wave at a stranger as you run past. Or casually work together to kill the same mob you both stumbled on.
---
If I can get a chance to hop on in the next few hours, I‚Äôll try and help you.
---
So true. Shows the attitude they have towards their player base really.
---
Maybe your cpu is bottlenecking?
---
I would venture they are making the same logic error I did - looked at the raw damage number, and ignored the added benefit of the AA part.  
---
  I'm a melee build with a couple of rifle perks for sniping, so most auto or semi- auto ballistic weapons have low damage numbers - below 50 per shot.
---
My sniper rifle does 110... making raw damage numbers for handmades etc underwhelming.
---
That said, I solo  L50 SBs with a 1\* Executioners combat rifle, but it cannot scratch an L65+ SB with same.
---
So I break out the AA LMG I've been lugging around but havent used... did wonders against a pair of L65 SBs at line in the sand....
---
(Sad part was both of the bodies bugged out - no loot)
---
It‚Äôs always nice to see a happy fellow wastelander. Happy hunting.
---
It's hugely fun, love the 'poon' sound when it fires. If they could fix the Lock And Load perk it would reload faster too.
---
the blueprints section is just there to tease you in to thinking they gave you a useful tool.
---
He will only get you 75% of the time.
---
I think this is an excellent idea. :)
---
Oh man this is a hail Mary here, I hope people responded and showed in time. I'm not at my ps4 or I'd be right over
---
Agreed. After E3 last year I was against it and figured I would never play it. Got it as a 
---
Christmas present and figured why not. Aside from the month of March I‚Äôve played almost every day. Glad I jumped in!
---
I don't know, I'm at work right now, so I can't verify, but I'm pretty sure that in component view, everything shows, even stuff you don't currently have any of; those items are just grayed out.
---
There we have it folks. This broken ass "release the beta because fuck gamers" trend has reached the end stage- users now arguing that you should *NOT* expect a completed and functioning game on release.  
---
what a world.
---
Selling it for 5caps a piece at vendors. 200 water = 1000 ez caps
---
Also vegetable starch for adhesive and diluting stimpaks.
---
I used to have 12 industrial water purifiers but i dialed it down to 7 so i could downgrade to just 1 Fusion core Generator.
---
I never played a shotgunner at the height of the TSE craze last Decemberish.  I did main a shotgunner from mid March till Patch 8 or 9 when the nerfed it.  I played a Bloody Explosive PA shotgunner (no vats or crits ever).  My shotgunner was a beast, one hit anything south of a SB.  I could even one hit a mire lurker queen if I had a full stack of adrenaline.  This was after the supposed TSE nerf.. I played it for one afternoon after the recent rebalance, it was horrible.  Unless you were within 10 yards of a super mutant, you weren‚Äôt one shotting anything.  There‚Äôs a massive middle around between one shotting a mire lurker queen and a super mutant.  The recent rebalancing gutted Shotguns.  It needs to be brought up a bit.  On the flip side, I sold off all my shotguns and bought BE heavies, a BE Prime Gatling Gun will one shot a 68 super mutant from any range...
---
You mean that isn't a slot machine?
---
Sold my Vampire Explosive w/ fleschette mod in my vendor for a measly 3k this past weekend.  I know I could have gotten alot more, but I am constantly fighting cap level and I really didn't need 10k for it.  I could get the damage up around 1300+, but as a melee/shotgun build it was never practical to carry and it broke too damn fast.  Hope whoever bought it has fun with it.  Probably put it in their vendor for 10k.
---
What an ominous reply to get at such an hour! Lol
---
The way it should be.
---
But, I was in the same situation... but.. house locked and no accessible scrap point or stash box. me and my team mate thought.. wow what a shit head! should we help him with a new door!.. lucky the owner helped us with a suggestion.. He had a switch on his 4 vendor boxes.. click, we "helped" the owner out by turning his vendor beacon off.. 
---
Guys, if you REALLY feel that you have to be a shit head and lock your house up.. at least have a scrap point and a stash box out side. ESPECIALLY when you are advertising a public location!
---
I personally felt like blowing a hole in a wall to help this guy out but I didn't.
---
For that price its a damn fine game imo. Enjoy it.
---
Stop traveling to camps an go to the nearest point = solves
---
Many players are doing this, there will always be someone with too many caps and too little brain will buy them.
---
If you're on XB1 I'll be your first customer. That's a great reason to open an in-game bar.
---
Conduits are the way it's intended but they are very difficult to align and make look nice. Kudos to those who have mastered it. I took a different approach and ran all my ugly wiring on the roof. There are conduit pieces that have a normal power connector on them. One faces up and one faces down. I put those two next to each other on the roof and the one that faces down protrudes slightly into the room below. Then connect all the up-facing ones together then to your generator. Or, if you have a lot of area to cover, put a power pole up there and connect them all to that. Looks like an antenna. Then you can wire inside point-to-point from the downward protruding connectors. It also allows you to use conduit power emitters on the roof to power lights and things that don't get direct wired without having the ugly light show inside. Just use the up-facing power emitter on the roof and you'll never see it.
---
I remember my first Wendigo encounter. It was in one of the mansions. I heard the breathing in the area and I was thinking WTF is that? Continue to explore taking out ghouls and then I see that it from afar. Pull out the hunting rifle focus a VATS Crit and bam.....didn‚Äôt kill it and it destroyed me.  Now wherever I hear the breathing I get nervous and get ready to kill. I‚Äôm lvl 106 so they are not a huge threat but I have Wendigo PTSD now
---
Caviar empty!
---
I do something like this with basic plans like Stools and such, I drop them on a stone pedestal and put a sign next to it saying to take only what plans you don't know, and to leave the rest. No room on the sign to suggest people dump their junk plans, but in a perfect world people would understand the thought behind it and leave their own clutter plans. So far nobody has taken the whole lot, so it could've gone worse
---
Because if you take a look at all the towns in the Fallout Universe they have been shack towns build out of scrap and hunkered down with what they could find! A road sign to patch a hole in the wall.. just take a look at the small shack towns in the mire and variety there! Give us basebuilders the same option to build fallout universe lore friendly homes!
---
I have some "you have been insulted" notes for sale for 12,500 caps for you !! tee hee..
---
What if they could add a technique where they map the (actual) real life sky?
---
If you've played games that use Google Maps (Pokemon, Walking Dead etc) you know what I mean.
---
Though I wonder if it's only Mobile games that have, or can, take advantage of that.
---
That would be pretty awesome to see galaxies and occasionally shooting stars or maybe.. just maybe.. UFOs? üòú
---
I have three. It does nothing
---
I've never seen a flare shot by other than me before..you know, to see what they do..
---
  I thought this might play a role - was toe to toe with a miloe miner, no hits registering - then I realized it had "curled up" with the gauntlet covering part of its head - so I was looking at its back.
---
Absolutely no damage when in that position.
---
As soon as it stood, stated taking damage again.
---
From a lot of datamined content, it's in fact not going to be PVE, but it's going to be a new PVP gamemode called Nuclear Winter. It also seemingly includes a Battle Royale.
---
Emergency Protocols is a must for your PA.  I would personally not run Dodgy, just use Serendipity and Nerd Rage.  For explosive weapons just go full Demo Expert if you have all of them.  Use a gatling gun for trash mobs, save the 50 Cal for bosses is the best way to manage your ammo.  Not using energy weapons then you can run both Scaly Skin and Grounded - both mutations help even in PA.
---
I envy you. Every time I‚Äôve tried that I‚Äôve been left with a second set of unremovable stairs.
---
Sitting has to be one of the worst mechanics in the game.
---
Solid screen freeze of the Fallout 76 game only, can hear chat, all other apps working flawlessly. sometimes it comes back. normally it follows a game crash.
---
Hahaha....now that sucks.
---
I now have 2 "You've been Insulted" notes for sale for 12.5k
---
I like your set up a lot, which mutations you're using? Do u use energy weapons?
---
First point is moot cause those are junk not aid versions.
---
Yes, it's the only way I play.
---
Yes I was randomly exploring and I went into one of the cabins and as I turned to leave, the door closed and I thought maybe it was lag but then the pictures started spinning and I ran out the cabin, then the shaking and screaming started. God it was so scary especially at night
---
I would support that.  I also try to fix people's crops and turrets when I see them down.  Gotta help out the neighbors!
---
In front of the Teapot, on the picnic table, there is usually one.
---
This happened with me too. Some perks make it not work. You should try removing all perks except the ones you need.
---
Just sent you a friend request.
---
oh well let me take off work to day and redo my camp because La3Rat has made a decree
---
Dont forget about doing all the work and not getting the credit  for the challenge. glitch. so much glitch.
---
Dont forget those dailies add up to about 60 irl cents
---
Remember scrap 10 pre wqr money, scrap 5 gnomes, level up ONE time? 
---
Actually read another games monthly update that said ... to make the quest easier and faster to complete! Dont forget  Beth has done nothing to speed anything up, or make it easier. so much grinding. folks that have a couple hours aint got time to go find something to fight cause they have to   figure out how to do a ridiculous challenge worth a dime.
---
I still carry my TSE 10mm as a backup in the field.   It fires fast so if I need it it‚Äôs there
---
As a stealth sniper VATS crit build, gutsys are cake. I can one shot them to the thruster all day long. But screw those mirelurk kings. They have way too high of perception and I can only get one shot off before they're on to me and stagger the crap out of me with whatever that attack they do. That's about the only thing I will actively avoid in this game.
---
First time I went through there, it was all high level super mutants ... and one behemoth :)
---
Again it proves my point  those armor legendarys effects combos break the game  .
---
My minigun can stagger but with 8%-10% chance vs 75% chance to stop dmg armor  sure you can die but chamaleon  you cant be targeted by vats
---
Oh no, so you‚Äôll be someone‚Äôs one time a month reason to log off and on real quick. Certainly not mine, see what I mean?
---
I agree with that.  I would much rather have a perk, for example, that gives directional audio toward a corpse than the one they have for finding magazines
---
well usually when you see 20+ armors, you know for sure it's most likely cloth.
---
othjerwise, well, visiting the world is part of the game anyway
---
Best winning method: enforcer 3 perk card, kite them to the ground floor, shotgun their legs till crippled (cripple both if needed), get some distance and drop a mini nuke on em. Worked for me.
---
Ahhh.. Thanks for the info.. :)
---
It's made with bourbon.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a glitch, doesn‚Äôt happen to me
---
What platform are you on? I have a few nice rolling pins I could spare, I'm on PC.
---
I was in adventure mode with pacifist mode on, and nope the camp was friendly, there were also turrets and the turrets did nothing to me. Just the pet.
---
Well, I learned you can fix player's bases. On hindsight, seems obvious since the game offer to you fix traps set up anywhere in the world! Well if I ever come across a player's CAMP and see broken stuff, I'll fix them :)
---
I love fallout 76 it‚Äôs great üëåüëåüëåüëåüëÖüëÄüëÅ
---
Yep. Looking for nice rifles, been getting anything but. Did get a bloodied gatling plasma that I was able to sell to someone.
---
I dont think its a tie in. ZAX isn‚Äôt one character, it‚Äôs a kind of AI Supercomputer, and there are multiple. The one from Raven Rock, after years and years, started to become sapient- which is what the logs between it and MODUS are discussing- and eventually it renamed itself John Henry Eden and seized control of the Enclave. This is a completely different ZAX computer that was likely installed in Vault 51.
---
I‚Äôm trying to tune a whole set so all I‚Äôm buying is armor right now. So far the stats look pretty nice. 
---
The one I mention also makes room for another perk card since I can remove aqua boy and use another perk in its place. 
---
I can add all the 3* effects to this post that I‚Äôve discovered so for if you‚Äôre interested...
---
It drives me nuts. This bug has been around since day one and still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Maybe it‚Äôs tough to replicate due to how many different variations there can be when building a base, but it seriously pisses me off.
---
Thanks for the replies RE events. I will check those out. :)
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
Same! I thought it would look great with a complete shadowed dark look along with an officers black under armor! 
---
Maybe they‚Äôll fix it...
---
Ah I hate this. Hear a good SCRUNCH... baddy turns around and slaps you -once- and gives you a disease.
---
=| =| =|
---
There‚Äôs heavily indication that Vault 51 ties into nuclear winter, and since that mode is the first thing on the rough summer roadmap chances are it‚Äôll open before the other two.
---
If you open the social menu, there is a tab called 'recent' which lists a whole bunch of peeps you encountered and/or were on a Server with.
---
(On pc)
---
Scroll down towards the bottom of the link and you‚Äôll see the mutations I‚Äôm using.  As far as energy weapons, I‚Äôd only be interested in BE Gatling Laser or Gatling Plasma.  Even thou they all have been recently duped, the BE versions are still rare to find.  I have grounded mutation and I still believe class freak and that mutation are broken.  Which would make energy weapons pointless for me to use.  My main farming weapon is the BE Gatling Gun, primed because it‚Äôs so ammo efficient and priming it allows me to one super most monsters in the game.  If I‚Äôm playing with my wife or brother or at an event I‚Äôll use the BE 50 and feather the trigger so I won‚Äôt one shot enemies.  For the Queen it‚Äôs a no brained BE LMG primed, the reload sucks but each clip of 75 rounds you see her life go down a chunk.  No other weapon beats out an LMG on the Queen, not even a bloody Ss meat hook
---
Funny you should ask, just picked up a three star quad double barrel with 50% limb damage from a nice player's vending machine. I named her Kneecapper of course. I normally run a stealthy rifle/heavy (Gatling) build but my new toy is fun and I shifted a couple of perks over to help. I just have to remember to target the legs when the ghouls start rushing now. :)
---
Good job fellas!
---
NO please, those of us with vision impairments it is already hard enough
---
This one makes me mad. Especially when doing the campfire event and I use melee becaus I one shot everything with rifles and I want people to have a chance to kill stuff
---
I loved leveling up with shotguns... then when I hit 40 or so they felt like they dropped off so hard that i felt like I'd wasted all my time getting up that high =(
---
This is an incredible resource! I've saved a bunch of maps to my photos, so I can quickly access them on my tablet and phone while in game. 
---
I have been trying to find Lure Weed. I cannot recall having found it in the wild, but do recall picking some up in coolers and other containers in the past. Any help would be great!
---
I run bloodied unarmed. But i carry a bloody shotgun in case i have to hop in some power armor. I really wish we could have load outs because i have to switch a bunch of cards around every time i switch to pa with sg
---
There‚Äôs literally no risk... oh wait the 1 super mutant that spawns when i fast travel to your camp.
---
Same server, it just sets the pvp damage to off initially.  You can even switch back/forth in game if you want.  If you participate in PvP, it will push you back into survival mode, and you'll be locked for a few minutes before you can re-enable adventure mode.   
---
Survival mode is unrestricted pvp, along with a few other restrictions on respawn locations; scoreboards for progress; some special challenges.
---
For a second I thought you were talking about the bug that you can't go upstairs, bit instead have to jump.
---
I do shotgun primary.  The enforcer perk is really underrated, especially on big tanky creatures. 30% chance to cripple is amazing. Nothing like hobbling a sheep squatch legs and just sitting there pinging away at him as he Slowly crawls at me.
---
In?
---
Soap and toilet paper for 100c each.
---
It's a dirty, grungy, wasteland. Everyone needs a good shower and to feel clean from time to time.
---
8-10% with a crazy ROF is pretty good odds, and you‚Äôre still doing damage at that point anyway. 
---
If I‚Äôm sitting for Chameleon to be active, Sentinel isn‚Äôt working, only Assassins. Spraying down the area at that point mercs me just as easily. If I stand up for all my armor to be active, you can Vats Crit me in the head and I die.
---
Also berry mentats help, but are usually unnecessary if you‚Äôre looking for the red dot/crosshairs.
---
Hopefully they will, I really miss vaults.
---
ZAX is a type a supper super computer, President Eden in Fallout 3 was a ZAX as well. This vault 51 one will be independent of the two.
---
I have been having the same issue on console so it could be the game and not your system.
---
Stick to Adventure mode, make sure 'passive' mode is on, don't attack anyone and you will not encounter PvP.
---
I‚Äôll give this thread a couple of minutes before it‚Äôs removal maximum. Not saying that‚Äôs necessary a good thing but rules are rules.
---
Melee are way powerful because you have to be bloodied &amp; near death to gain the max power increase. It's hard to maintain and as a spectator you don't really see the effort that goes into it. You're right in the thick of it, in the Queen's face getting the brunt of the damage and have to micromanage your health regen, stimpak/nuka cola usage, blocking, all the while being one anti-armour Mr Gutsy or strong attack from death. You can't really relax like you can at range; blasting away from a distance while we're the vanguards of the group attacking the toughest and dealing the damage. Also, as the lowest health person on the field the enemies seem to go for us first, Imposter Sheepsquatch especially. It's not a cake walk, it's a pain. That pain is rewarded with extra damage and much higher healing item usage. 
---
I started with a sniper character and made a melee second, and don't think I could go back. Ammo generation is a pain in the arse. It's kinda laid back in that respect. Maybe you'd enjoy it. Join us, join us, join us...
---
Love all the people in the thread calling any negative player interaction as greifing...  wrecking ball was there at launch people. Attacking peoples bases was intended part of the game.
---
It‚Äôs happened less frequently when I use an instigating tambourine with 150-ish damage (adrenaline...), my bloodied bat is less reliable.
---
I have a theory it‚Äôs due to a OHK/max damage-filter, as one gets to 190+ damage it happens more often in my experience.
---
I‚Äôm on board with that
---
Yes exactly!
---
Please no.
---
I hate nothing more than nights i cant see in in a game, its just kills the fun and makes night basically a "dont play" timeframe.
---
If at all they should make it an option like the mod "true nights" or "nightly nights" for Fallout 4 and Skyrim, i would be fine with that and everyone would get what they want. You can have realistic nights and i can still enjoy playing in the night.
---
Ultracite lasers have slightly lower damage and faster rate of fire compared to regular laser weapons. They also allegedly do more damage to scorched enemies but I have not seen any data to back that up.
---
Yeah, no risk of engaging living buttplugs who want to PvP when you don't.
---
Wonder what? 5k would be questionable.
---
Yeah I'm def noticing a difference. +91 DR is more than a 200% BOS combat chest!
---
Also I in my personal experience I have fought the mothman 4 times in the toxic valley and top left corner, and once in the mire.  So I mean that‚Äôs just my experience but who knows.
---
Haha! I posted this during the Beta and one of the comments was simply ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and it died in new. Cloudier nights should be darker, clearer nights lighter, but inside, under trees etc. should be proper dark. Link this to creatures that are nocturnal, but creatures that aren‚Äôt have reduced visibility.
---
What build could kill the queen solo in 30 seconds?! I'm bloodied as fuck but I'd just get swarmed by the other enemies and killed without being able to do damage. My max damage is about 1200 with +40% power attack damage and I can't even one-shot a regular scorchbeast never mind do that much damage to a queen
---
Dupers got caught?
---
I would love an eyebot follower!
---
Dang that sucks.. sorry that was just how I made sure I got those challenges done.. it seems like almost every player has to do a different way to get them done..
---
You forget that everyones eyes are different, i for example have a lot of difficulty discerning dark blue and black shapes, so nights in games can be super horrible for people like me where i can barely see anything. Im all for making it an option for all the interested, but please dont fuck me by forcing super dark nights :/
---
Different opinions, best solution is therefore to make it a visual toggle like bloom and FX etc.
---
Bonus points if you drop a welcome mat in that spot to confuse people into thinking you have a fast travel mat.
---
Fingers crossed!!
---
That‚Äôs dumb this post is only helping the community not witch hunting
---
Thanks for showing up
---
I just use my sons account as a mule go farming with mine dump to his trade then buy a water for all we made and he has no idea I‚Äôm doing this when he‚Äôs asleep
---
This is sounding more and more like we just want Noise Marines in Fallout 76.
---
You should mark the /s or they think you are serious...
---
Thank you very much
---
It is not uncommon for an application to have bugs, even many of them.. but it should be a decision for a vendor to put PRIORITY on fixing bugs and figuring out why my devs are creating new bugs and WHY is my QA department not finding these before the production users are???????
---
That's why the people are pointing fingers at Bethesda to do things differently.
---
Yes, I'm in this line of business and I feel this company has real major issues. But we stick with this because they have a DAMN great creative department.
---
I've got a shotgun main. I love how the pump action feels, but am sad at how things just.. shrug off the damage these days. Two-shot pump action for my main blasty \o/
---
Saw him 4 times this weekend. I killed the first one but haven‚Äôt killed one since they take off fast as hell. 
---
Anyway if you know the spawn points of the rare robo responder vendor while your server hopping the mothman has a chance to spawn instead... among other things.
---
Not the case, i5-8600k I have enough ram too
---
Who knew FO76 Shitposts were so literal?
---
Why?
---
You're problem is that you're trying to build a staircase.  Have you considered, instead, building a [Spiral Bearcase](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/deathknell1972/video/74872833)?
---
I bought them this weekend from one of the faction vendors @ WS. 
---
Think it was about 1/2way between books and artisans corner, but I could be wrong.
---
Meh I waited about 20 minutes before giving up.
---
I do right by my customers. I've currently got 17+ 3\* legendary armor and 17+ 3\* legendary weapons up for sale. I've been grinding, looking for good deals at other player vendors for resale, and now I'm scrapping my lowest quality items for scrip in the hopes of providing even better quality equipment in my vending machine from the purveyor. I'm constantly pushing up against the cap max. Go figure my most successful business venture would happen in a game.
---
Pretty self explanatory
---
It isn‚Äôt lame from a RPG perspective.
---
Been runnin unarmed melee for awhile. Tried bloody for a minute. It was cool to run up and one-shot deathclaws and all. But when you get surrounded by bloated ferals, things get a bit too bloody. That‚Äôs when you need high health and DPS. The build for me is furious +SS  + Strength for my weapon. BOS combat + endurance for armor
---
Who cares? Only idiots fall for it.
---
Thanks for the reply but I‚Äôm fairly new to the game can you dumb it down for me please üòÇ
---
It really is a great game. I been there for every update and patch and it keeps getting better. No matter what people are going to complain about something. Myself included. Just got to take it all with a grain of salt and experience it for yourself.
---
I have an instigating fireaxe that is great but can‚Äôt find one with SS. I hate the bloodied thing so I avoid it.  I do have a DCG with all the pluses but I‚Äôm need a weapon melee for the powerarmour use
---
It's enough that I'm able to take good with salt off my luck stack and replace it with bloody mess. That and the three ranks of strong back it gives you - it's like getting six perk slots. It is AWESOME. That plus being able to sell some of the nicer stuff I've been hoarding because come on it's so nice even if I'm never going to use it is really helping me get a handle on my carryweight/stash.
---
Now I just need to get rid of my 200 lbs of heavy guns so I can get rid of bear arms, two hundred pounds of drugs so I can get rid of traveling pharmacy, two hundred lbs of fusion cores and misc energy ammo so I can get rid of batteries included, and the \*300\* lbs of FOOD AND DRINK I'm carrying WTAF?!?!?! so I can get rid of thru hiker. Man I went a little crazy with alcohol cause of the Biv stuff, I need to just throw all that stuff out. Now if people would just BUY the 300 lbs of various sentinel and assassins and poisoners and reduce your ammo weight and reduce your weapon weight armor I have on sale I'd be in BUSINESS.
---
I was under the impression that serendipity didn't work with PA, did that change?
---
I want this. I dont know why I just do.
---
I‚Äôm really nervous to play again after all that it seems like I‚Äôve been missing. 
---
If you really wanted to help me my GT is my u/ but with no underscore :)
---
It‚Äôs a damn good game I don‚Äôt get all the negative hoopla. It‚Äôs being improved every month, new content, patches, game balance, etc... was it released early? Eh shareholders wanna see money on a project as soon as they pay for it - not wait 2 years. If that‚Äôs the case WoW has been unfinished since its design.
---
I can help, but due to timezones it'll be tomorrow
---
They actually did. I got her health down alone so far she regenerated and then quite a few people showed up and we finished her. Man i love reddit
---
Okay I‚Äôm glad they gave us the option to turn off PvP
---
I'm in. Mre605rc on ps4
---
Not sure if this bug has been (re)reported or if it will get seen here... posted on the Beth forums as well just in case.
---
The bug with Gatling Plasma weapons where the ammo count when the gun is first equipped was equal to the number of cores you have (i.e. first core was shown to have only 8 shots left if you were carrying 8 cores), which was fixed in patch 7 or 8 or thereabouts, has returned with patch 9.
---
You sir have a hording problem
---
Yeah! Absolutely. :) If you develop a comprehensive enough list, it‚Äôd be a good PSA post too.
---
Hope you have fun with that 3* Vampire's Gatling Laser ;D
---
okay cool!
---
hi, good thing they have built in pip boy lights and PA headlamps!  you dont need to fumble in the dark, use your built in game functionality to illuminate the darkness
---
it just seems silly to have the night be as bright as a cloudy daytime day
---
Thanks for the info, very informative.
---
nooooooo it is all  necessary
---
Is the queen that much weaker on solo? Or are you a beast?
---
I‚Äôm glad I can complete the game in peace now! 
---
Do you know if they fixed mob leveling so random mobs that should be weak don‚Äôt insta-kill you?
---
Mre605rc on ps4
---
There's a great bar set you can get from the atom shop so I def recommend doing daily/weekly challenges and what not - there's also a free punch bowl - it doesn't work just yet because they had to turn it off but it gives a free drink when it does work :) 
---
Sorry to hear about your loss but it's really neat how you're honoring their memory.
---
I‚Äôll be sure to try it in a few hours, thank you!
---
Not really since the current set up is able to track quests without a problem.  I've done nearly the entire main story without issue so far.
---
So I repeat why?
---
This is why I want I want to get a good legendary shovel so bad. Because I got one on my backpack ouo!!
---
Touch√© my friend.
---
Are they scammers?  Or are they real money traders?   There is a difference.
---
You should search this subreddit for this question. Gets asked pretty often and only rarely gets solid responses. In short, yes. I was skeptical but jumped in and love it.
---
Hopefully it‚Äôll be up long enough for people to get a heads up.
---
Go buy it at Gamestop. It's about $20, and well worth the $60 imo, but you may as well save money by getting it in store.
---
It's better to give the lower level legendaries to low level players than scrap 'em. Even if it's probably someone's second/third/fourth account
---
That's damn good info!
---
If you order a physical copy on Amazon it's $25. At that price it's absolutely worth it
---
90
---
One of my characters learned a few tank mods for flamer after scrapping some. So they do exist somewhere.
---
Maybe just show off progress on the games they teased last year?
---
He's actually a nokia phone.  Only reason he's lasted so long :)
---
But it‚Äôs not witch-hunting......so it‚Äôs not against the rules.....
---
Shop around, you can get a hard copy for 50% off or so.
---
Time to start collecting it!
---
I'm not the beast, my gun is :) i have a bloodied gatling plasma. It deals about 330 dmg per shot and damn son it shoots fast. It's not even explosive but it melts everything.
---
That ghoul dive-lunge is a nuisance
---
Thank you for responding. I apologize for not checking first though as this could be considered spam. Is it still good to play even if you don't have friends to experience it with?
---
Psh your not even admin lol disregard what I said
---
if you dont care the wire goes through the wall.. simply make a window wall, pass wire to the outside then replace the wall with a solid one
---
Ps4
---
vendor robots are found at various locations thoughout the wasteland.  Each one represents a specific faction - firebreathers, enclave, brotherhood of steel, responders, raiders et al - and each faction generally has unique items.
---
  One of the hallways at whitesprings has multiple shops and vendors - bookshop on one end, artisans corner at the other.  most of faction vendors are there.
---
I'm not sure how I didn't see this, but thank you.
---
Ok now tell me that ONLY by looking in the Pip-boy you can:
---
1. See what quests you haven't even started yet
---
2. See them in chronological order
---
3. Be sure you haven't missed any quest
---
You can't. You have to check the wiki for that.
---
Having a system in game that keeps track of all the quests in chronological order and most important, without spoiling them, would be great.
---
Locked water purifiers = overpriced stuff I will never buy
---
When I've had problems with stairs, I've also been able to rotate them to a different tile and fix some issues. This is in addition to temporarily adding another set elsewhere.
---
Yay, coming :)
---
Alright thank you.
---
I know numerous melee builds who use anti armor unarmed, one and two handed melee who can get up to 2000+ damage output. Granted with buffs, I've even seen a guy who can get over 12000+ damage output because of buffs Bethesda allow to stack, yet you can't with ranged weapons, be that heavy guns or rifles. 
---
As for being melee, if I wanted to use my fists I'd hit my missus.
---
Jokes aside melee is boring and shit for pvp, the point I was making is the lack of appreciation Bethesda has for the majority of its players. Even most power armor players use ranged weapons now yet we keep getting nerfed, yet you can whack the scorch beast queen to death in 4 hits.
---
Imo, there should only be one wacky situational challenge per day. The rest need to be things that you actually do while playing the game. ‚ÄúComplete 3 events‚Äù, ‚Äúlevel up period no strings attached‚Äù, ‚Äúkill 10 super mutants‚Äù, ‚Äúkill 10 scorched with melee weapons‚Äù ‚Äúclaima Workshop‚Äù, ‚Äúphotograph a historical landmark‚Äù.
---
Very nice! Just wish that the red rocket sign returns!
---
I hope you aren't looking for the mothman wing for the scout quest. I think it's unobtainable like the Stimpak Diffuser
---
One of the nicest things about fo76 is for sure the community! 
---
If you want, then Do IT! 
---
Play to like level 20 or so on your own to get the grasp of the game and then just Do things as you like and join events for example.
---
I've met dozens of nice people in my 300 hours so far, and recently met a lvl240 ish frensh guy Who modified my x-01 Power armor for free! 
---
If you buy the game and start the game, immediatelly go into your game options and turn off pvp. 
---
You are now excluding yourself from pretty much all pvp, excluding public workshops.
---
Oh and if you build your camp near vault 76, it cannot be nuked! You cannot drop nukes into the beginner area around vault 76
---
After a certain time spent and levels gained i'd look onto reddit or discords to connect to people and Do stuff together! 
---
However you can play 95~% percent solo if you want.
---
Yeah, 76.
---
Ah fair enough. From the shape of it I always wondered if it was a big arse robot in there or something.
---
I'm pretty shithouse when it comes to the lore.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one that just fixes stuff at other camps...
---
oh you dont actually play the 2nd account you just use it as a mule and drop all the shit to it to sell on the  other account,  then trade all the caps back to your main farming guy :) hope this helps clear the confusion up.
---
I don‚Äôt make the rules mate, I‚Äôm all for naming people that cheat or abuse players, if that is in fact what they are doing, was just mentioning that these posts are usually removed quite quickly.
---
and this is why I only lock my junk extractor and my personal bedroom...
---
No. I have not even started the boyscout quest. Just wanted to bash his skull in
---
Gonna try this. I tired of walking around to find it. Haven't even finished the booze and recipes I have are zero. Didn't manage a nuked yet either. So I have no quests to play for the last 40+lvls.
---
I dealt with the first round of nerfs to my TSE handmade and was thrilled when I got an explosive double barrel to drop because it would hit hard with my build. Now after the shotgun nerf 2.0 the gun is useless. I used it to kill a yao guai for the tadpole badge, but I had to weaken it with melee first. After that it went right back into the stash. I wasn't one shotting everything in sight, but when all the enemies spawn at high level it would be nice for it to be effective. All I have left is melee and I fear that will be next on their hit list.
---
Yup. I dumped my explosive shotty in the stash after last patch. They are useless at range and up close melee options do way more DPS.
---
Oh.. hope not off topic...
---
Please how about a means to find items we killed. Now that is worth atoms!
---
"Detector of the Dead"
---
I've spent many mins, many times, scouring a location trying to find the body of something I killed....
---
Yeah I‚Äôve come across as quite negative. They did respond to my ticket and give me a couple of things to try. I‚Äôm just annoyed that none of those worked and now they‚Äôve said, ok nothing to do with us now. Wanted to see if anyone else has had the same issue.
---
Yeah fr, annoying as heck
---
At the very end of the cave
---
Stay in the same world, open the social menu, click on your own Name and hit leave World. 
---
Then hit play again, works way better.
---
I know the pain.
---
How can I do that on PS4?
---
Same here. No change in music, either. 
---
What's weird is that I'll sneak to closest mobs, they don't see me at all or actively looking for me, but still won't get my sneak + covert op multiplier. 
---
I wonder if it's a mob that fell through the ground.
---
As a Halloween FANATIC this is the single greatest idea I've ever heard on this subreddit.
---
Added! :)
---
Yup rof is great in pve to stagger swarms of mobs  but like i said those combos break the game like pre nerfed tse weapons.  berry mentats means even more things to do for none bloodied sent/cav users while you can oneshot  them .
---
Basicly forcing ppl to use the same armors and weapons to enjoy pvp.
---
I found 3 so far are random. Found one yesterday but he disappeared to fast, not relocated, disappeared.
---
It is worth it at even full retail.  But why not buy a used physical copy instead?
---
You‚Äôre arguing with someone that was agreeing with you.
---
*confused emote.
---
Have a great day.
---
The urban armor is very glitched, has been from day 1. There are a variety of mods but most don't show up or can't be applied. I have spent thousands of caps on my old urban armor for mods, the mods don't tell you what they are. They just say "urban scout armor polymer".
---
There was actually a spreadsheet on reddit somewhere a guy posted with tons of good info on the scout armor.
---
I love this. All in on a self-made char. Can't help with your questions.
---
I carry a Tesla Rifle just for that event.
---
Way in the back area where the waterfall area is.
---
Through tunnels, twists and turns...and enemies that have a taste for human flesh.
---
are the even redditers? So little information and so poorly written I'm not sure what OP is talking about.
---
I miss that glass helmet from oblivion that let you have night eyes as long as you wore it.
---
I had a nuke dropped on my base Saturday... sure, they were probably targeting Top of the world.. but I was collateral damage..
---
I see what you‚Äôre going for here. People might be down to role play, but probably not with their caps.
---
I'm just used to buying on digital at this point, but everyone saying to buy a used copy makes a good point. If I don't like it I can just return it to a gamestop instead of having it permanently. Thanks for the response
---
Maybe to a certain point, but definitely not completely
---
Ya, I'm tired of the take a picture of...
---
For sure! I‚Äôve made friends in the game that I team-up with now and then. I mostly play solo though. It‚Äôs very doable solo. Solo as in not on a team. Certain events need multiple people but they are server wise events and others will show up without teaming up.
---
You want it like dying light? I remember the first time I played when it turned night  like ohh shit.
---
For me the biggest problem is ammo consumption. The shotgun just doesn't justify the amount of ammo used for the amount of damage it produces. This is why I gave up on miniguns, too. Miniguns eat 5mm ammo like there's no tomorrow, but don't do massive damage. Meanwhile, a gatling gun is ultra-casual with ammo consumption and does a ton of damage.
---
I got a hunters + fire rare LMG and thiugjt it was trash....but then realized scortchbeasts and sheepsquatch are "hunterable" and this bastard MELTS
---
it's quite game breaking, I hope they will fix this in 9.5
---
Yep same problem here
---
And shut doors! Ha.. playing of course. I always shut doors tho.
---
For those of us who have color vision issues please don‚Äôt...
---
Well I know what you should do today
---
I solo this game. You only need other people for two events, and people will show up to help if you initiate them.
---
&gt;will i be immediately overrun by hardcore players and nuke blasts?
---
If you're playing in the main game mode - "Adventure mode," you have almost nothing to worry about in terms of PvP. Unless you shoot back at someone who's shooting at you, they can fire off 100% of the ammo they have on their person and they'll never do a bit of damage to you. PvP has to be mutual to have any effect. There's "survival mode," where this isn't true and anyone can harm anyone, but that's wholly optional. As to nukes, whenever one is incoming, you'll get an automated warning, and a huge red circle will appear on the map indicating the area where it's going to impact. You'll then have three minutes to evacuate the area. That's more than enough to fast-travel to a safe distance under almost any circumstance. 
---
&gt;Or will i be able to, you know, just build my little camp, grind something nice and see a friendly face once in a while? 
---
I think you'll find that's actually what most of us are doing, most of the time. All of the really nasty, unpleasant and aggressive people quit the game in the first week, leaving only the upbeat, creative and constructive types. :)
---
That's good to know, honestly. One of my other main concerns is that the community will be as toxic as Red Dead is. 
---
Also, I'm not sure why every insightful or helpful response on this thread keeps getting downvoted lmao
---
Beyond the obvious damage perk cards, Scattershot and Enforcer are a must.
---
Both.  Stole 120k from me.   Heavy was business partner.
---
More than likely mate. At the same they either need to but ranged or nerf melee... Make it fair atleast. I understand though dude.
---
I experience this with the Gauss rifle all the time.
---
Thanks for the responses guys, i'm glad it's not just me going insane :)
---
I caught a video of this exact problem earlier.  I even got sneak attack damage confirmation.  [https://youtu.be/NaFKg0WQphE](https://youtu.be/NaFKg0WQphE)
---
you're outta luck had one in my vendor until yesterday
---
Is that a pie or cheese cake?
---
exactly...
---
Wanted this from day one. In door grow lights also.
---
Wow, is that the increase? Yeah that's a whole extra piece of armour right there
---
There's also a hard lemonade recipe
---
I've personally seen 3 melee builds drop the queen in under a minute. They were buffed to fuck but yeh it happens.
---
Happens all the time here on PS4. I can get right up to a scorched and 0% and then all sudden 95%. I'm seen by then..
---
Don't even try to melee something that's flying...
---
Gotcha, maybe a nice groggy axe if you can find one of those. They seem pretty popular with PA melee builds, but I've not tried one myself.
---
All 5 pieces of my armor have 20% weapon weight reduction. When i join a server from the main menu screen, my weight perk works fine. But lets say a friend gets online and sends me an invite to join their game. I accept that invite and upon loading into their lobby i notice that i am several hundred pounds overweight. If this happens i back out of that lobby to the menu screen. Then i go to my friends list and select to join that friend. When i reload into his lobby for the 2nd time, my weapon weight reduction works. Now, it has seemed to got alot better lately. But when this happens, logging out to the title screen and logging back in has always worked for me, in any aspect of the weight reduction not being recognized.
---
Learn to write in a way it makes a sense and maybe it will be read. Maybe.
---
Some sloths around fissures too and they're already dead. Nevermind that level 80 scorchbeast, just get your shrooms and skidaddle
---
lol i bought a mod from a vendor yesterday for my faster swinging power fist.  ps4
---
I have a stealth sniper build didn't know crouching with a heavy. (Aa.50).
---
BTW I just found my first 2* item (beside all rise, of that is one?). A lvl40 second shot sniper rifle. Upgraded to .50 with perforating magazine. I get 144 damage in the stats. But when I test it, I feel it does less damage than that same gun w/o legends but at lvl50 with a dmg of 133. 
---
I'm lvl116 and have 3 maxed out sniper rifle cards. What's going wrong? Also this feels low damage for a sniper.
---
wow that's crazy
---
Yeah, doing 1.9k per hit doesn‚Äôt matter if the dmg doesn‚Äôt register lol
---
Thanks!!
---
yep just another way bethesda does things the wrong way
---
I was thinking group on a discord LFG I‚Äôm in
---
Mission accomplished then by the sounds of OP.
---
Just sent a friend request. I also need help with it if you don‚Äôt mind helping me out as well.
---
Thanks for the tip, I haven't really looked at the groggy
---
You get the same effect using a single piece of chameleon armor, which is much easier than trying to assemble a full set of weightless armor.
---
That's a nice UI. I like itm
---
my trusty fire axe has been treating me well any time I don‚Äôt feel like using ammo, I might need to pay better attention and see if this is happening to me
---
There are toxic people for sure. But if you turn on pacifist and play on adventure mode they can really grief too much and you can always block or change servers. Isn‚Äôt very common in my experience. 
---
Seems like certain people just go downvote anything. Oh well!
---
Man a little Eyebot would be really fun. They could play music or have faction specific messages / stickers
---
I thought I was going to die when that part happened. Ground rumbling n I'm trying to get my best weapons equipped..ha.
---
I hope so too! I haven't seen anyone else bring this issue up so it may not be affecting everyone.
---
If theres a fix, I'll post it here tomorrow!
---
No problem
---
i have my place there too, never heard the screams ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Me either, but it's on my list.
---
I've gotten diseases from hitting enemies that never had a chance to hit back.  Make sure you use protection when you hit that.
---
I honestly can't thank you enough for your responses. I just ordered a $25 dollar copy from Amazon so I guess I'll see how it goes. Read the post that one of the dudes posted definitely helped.
---
I am pretty sure I saw a post here that suggested that like the Brahmin pen we could have a dog house (like the one from FO4) that would spawn a dog! Would be neat to have different kinds of dogs - like mongrels etc. But I also want a buddy to wander the wastes with me when I have no one to play with.
---
Shame Bethesda can't catch a break, first issue of release was duping this patch and now its stars disappearing, assuming whats next is when all dlc released since beta gets undone.
---
I'll pass. Flux is rare as is. My storage of that shit empties quite quickly.
---
yeah its very annoying, i made a post about it last week and a bethesda rep did comment, saying they are aware of this situation and are looking into it
---
hopefully they will be able to have it fixed with the upcoming patch
---
it really is a big deal for melee users, the combat is actually very broken for melee users
---
Same on PS4. Super sucks.
---
I think the BOS vendor does
---
Is there anything else than audio covers?
---
‚ÄúI just massacred the only humans who aren‚Äôt from the vault, **SHIT**‚Äù
---
can't pick the code up,you can take the holotape,but not the note.
---
seems if I go to uni,without going back to defiance, then terminal won't
---
work.
---
so my question is,do we always have to back to defiance as a daily prerequisite. ?
---
I‚Äôm fine with waiting until tomorrow, jefferylewbowski is my PSN
---
I'm on ps4 so maybe it's not on every platform
---
If I so happen to come across a players camp that‚Äôs getting attacked I clear all the enemies out repair things that need to be repaired, and vanish like nothing, and if you have your water purifier open I usually take what ever water is in there for payment
---
Half the map showed up for the event and then noped right outta there. It sucked.
---
The last sentence explains it for me. At point blank shotguns are great...but melee is better. 
---
At further range than that, rifles are better. 
---
And you can pretty easily use rifles and melee in a build.
---
Yah yeet
---
Good. Do you know someone who sucks like a vacuum cleaner? Mine's broken.
---
If you do, refer me to him/her/it. We'll have so much fun cleaning the house! He/she/it can suck the dust out, I can mop out the big dirt that he/she/it can't suck! We'll have so much fun!
---
Which vendor? All I see is heating coils lately.
---
i had some guy come up to me and offer to trade, so when i chose a few things id like to buy, me messaged me and said " i accept paypal only"
---
lol so I followed him back to his camp and put a orbital strike on it
---
No offense aimed at you but there have been a zillion posts like this and I just, for some reason, want to give every one of you the finger. It's probably entirely uncalled for. But that's just how I feel.
---
Like I literally had to wait three years playing FRICKING DESTINY for this damn thing to come out and crappy as it is it isnt FRICKING DESTINY. If Prey hadn't come out I would've lost my frickin mind. And that one game about people deliberately drugging themselves to forget surrendering to the Nazis. "We Happy Few." That game is a mindf@ck. 
---
These games come along extraordinarily rarely and they're f@cking expensive to make, way more expensive than pvp garbage like FRICKING DESTINY. People who make these games are doing us a huge favor. I get the game was fricking steaming garbage when it came out and a lot of it is on them. But if you don't like a game fricking shut up and move on. Argh!
---
tl;dr: GET OFF MY LAWN!!!
---
I sell stuffed animals like the various teddy bears, jangles, etc. Surprisingly sell a lot lol.
---
I didn't do my first nuke or zone until I was level 99.
---
Alright I'll add ya. My psn is nwa_terence.
---
Is this Wendigo in the Wendigo cave or the church?
---
It would be cool if we could load it up, say a cooler, with water but limit each player to only taking 2 within a 20hour spawn time like everything else. 
---
Maybe have different items spawn for different players randomly?
---
This is a good copypasta
---
I believe you mean 65 scrips but then again Bethesda owes us reparations for all the pain and suffering so charging them 35 scrip extra would make sense.
---
&gt;... WoW has been unfinished since its design.
---
That right there is the issue with Fallout 76:  it's a multi-player game being judged as a single player game. 
---
Yes, the launch was rough.  Remember when Wow launched? Does anyone remember GTA V online launch?  You couldn't even log into Diablo 3 consistently for the first couple of weeks.  Online launches are rough and the types of bugs that pop up in an online environment are probably not easily found by QA.
---
Even though the concept was explicitly laid out accurately at E3 last year, people still expected this to be Fallout 5 or Fallout: New Vegas 2.
---
This was an opportunity to examine the language used in criticisms. Yet you skimmed and repeated the same offence putting the word "should" in my mouth. My dude, your argument is only as viable as the language you use to express it. Whatever criteria YOU use to discern what is a completed and or functional game is YOUR criteria, nothing wrong with having an OPINION but to express it as the truth for EVERYONE is short sided.
---
Eh. It'll break for sure, even with Gunsmith, and more than 30 plasma cores will be needed. Completely alone it might take the entire event's time.
---
I really wish they would separate Serums / Aid and Armor / Apparel on the vending machines as well. I'm sure people get frustrated when they see I have so much "armor" and they get to my shop and I sell only apparel. OR like me when I'm looking to buy clothes and all I find is junk armor.
---
Thank youuuuu :)
---
I have seen a few people ask for this before, but I have to disagree. The nights in this game feel like they last forever. I don't want to stumble around in the dark, unable to see beyond the range of my feeble pip boy light. I'm not interested in realism for its own sake, I just want fun gameplay.
---
Also, don't you think it's already hard enough to find the corpse of whatever you just killed so you can loot it? Searching for a dead legendary in the tall grass of the cranberry bog when it's pitch black out doesn't sound like much fun.
---
Wendigo cave, I‚Äôm level 39. I‚Äôve got excavator power armor I can bring.
---
Cool! Most questions I have I can find on here. Check back if you need help.
---
Ya I've always wondered why they don't exist. Personally not a huge gardener, but that's mostly cause I'm sick of having my crops chewed up by every critter in the wasteland. Perhaps if these existed and I could grow food in the safety of my house, I might actually garden more.
---
Thanks again! I hope that you have a great day
---
Great, do you use guns or melee?
---
player
---
Just a color scheme.  Although I believe due to a to a bug the urban left leg has a lower dr and er than the forest does.
---
I‚Äôm always trying to be helpful and repair peoples stuff if I visit! Especially if I don‚Äôt buy anything I feel bad so I figure the least I could do is repair what‚Äôs broken.
---
Damn. Lol.
---
They do be like that most times.
---
I was hoping for a placeable desk version too. However, I think in this particular case it has to do with animations and actually interacting with it. With the standing terminal, how people are going to interact with it is pretty universal since the space it takes up requires a certain amount of space around it. If there was a desk version, they‚Äôd have to account for all sorts of angles and distances that the terminal could be placed and used on a table that may mess up animations. These desktop ones are fine out in the world since they were able to place them and optimize how you interact with it, but without that control there‚Äôs no knowing what kind of craziness could occur. 
---
A possible solution to this though would just be to add another terminal option that is just a desk with a desktop terminal already attached to it that can‚Äôt be moved, so then they could control how it‚Äôs accessed
---
ES6... will be online and have 0 NPC or immersive story and there will be an Elder Shop that sells cosmetic only items until we decide to sell non cosmetic items.
---
don't apologize for how you want to play, and fuck people trying to force you onto a team.
---
Guns, sneaking sniper. I‚Äôm gonna bring a bunch of plasma grenades, hopefully we just melt him
---
Here‚Äôs a workaround..don‚Äôt know how bad your OCD is.. but what if you max out our build budget and then just store it all?
---
I think we have to go back to defiance and re-read that note 'orders099'.
---
This is what i'm trying to determine, but if I have the dna, then I WILL crash.This and hardened mass, if I have that, then I,m dead twice 95%...
---
this game toys with me, i'm sure.
---
cheers.
---
Well since you're an avid fan of the Fallout series, I'll warn you, this is not the same RPG/Story-Driven game that you're used to.
---
This game is something completely different from any other Fallout game. Don't worry though, that's not a bad thing. This game is trying to shift from a RPG/Story-Driven genre to a Open-World Sandbox Survival genre, and in the category of Open-World Sandbox Survival this is definitely one of the best.
---
It'll take a little getting used to, but if I could recommend any way to jump straight in, it would be to build a small C.A.M.P. + a vendor shop. This will given you access to a safe(ish) place to store items, craft and farm supplies. It also, thanks to the new vendor shops, means if you hang around your C.A.M.P. you'll meet tons of other people quite often who will stroll by to see what you're selling. I've met all my FO76 friends this way and this game becomes so much more fun when you have friends across the map that you can call on to come help you out or vice-versa, you get called on to go help out some of your buddies.
---
If you're interested in role-playing, I've also ran into quite a few people randomly in the world who role play their character. One of my favorite people was a guy role-playing as Brotherhood Scribe. He was wandering around the map, taking in-game photos and writing notes about locations in a physical notebook in real life. He'd speak in the same ways and about things as a typical Brotherhood of Steel member would. He was dressed head-to-toe with a Scribe's outfit and a laser rifle. 10/10 role-playing and that's what makes this game truly great, the community. The community is easily the friendliest and most helpful of any gaming community I can think of. Don't be surprised if within the first few days of playing you get given loads of stimpaks, ammo, etc, from higher level players.
---
I tried this on xb1, I never mutate anymore. I to accidentally lost marcupial. Which I got from doingoimg this. I only mutate from ghoul hits. Sometimes even at my first rads so at 90+health.
---
How do I become a brotherhood???
---
I‚Äôve never met anyone that actually likes/uses wood armor. If I knew anyone I‚Äôd pass along all the stuff I get because of course that‚Äôs 70% of what I get hahaha
---
That thing won't know what hit him :)
---
Ok, buddy. It's fine.
---
The Best Shit, more like.
---
It's a single finite spot in your entire camp. This was not just happenstance either. One person built a shack outsid their main building specifically for their rad shower on the exact spawn location and set it up to automatically turn on when people spawned in. People we're purposefully putting it there. 
---
In all honesty I am shocked at the responses here. All I am asking for is a little common curtesy and all I am getting is a bunch of sarcastic response.
---
To keep your damage acceptable late game you will need an explosive shotgun with rank 5 demo expert. Other than that use every perk with the word shotgun in it. Also get the perk in luck that repairs your gun on hit.
---
I've been thinking about this while wandering around the nights are absolutely way too bright, I know it's probably for the sake of PVP but christ the sky is basically the same color in daylight, at least make the sky black.
---
This is actually really helpful. Thank you!
---
Snoop change your post or the fanboys will roast you on an open fire! This reddit forum won't hesitate to roast you till your cooked Dog Mongrel meat and they hate truth bombs as they prefer sugar bombs instead.
---
My OCD is bad enough that I have zero stored items as I hate the grey bar that shows. But I have used this method on occasion. 
---
The other issue is that sometimes not everything takes up the same amount of budget. So you have to build enough items and then store them to cap it out. 
---
The other thing that I wish that they had is an actual percentage of your camp budget used instead of just a bar.
---
Same - then the group i ended up with put me on add duty instead as a solid way to contribute.
---
What nerf to rifles?
---
you have worse ahead of you. chin up
---
Wiki says they retail for 35. I‚Äôd have no problem buying them for 25. Someone motivated might buy them for 30. If you want to sell stacks, I‚Äôd price on the lower end.
---
So the bug removes stars, weird why can't we get a bug that gives us stars?
---
If i'm asking to team up, it's because nobody on my friend list is playing and I need to try and complete something while on a team,  not place 50 outhouses in someone I don't knows camp,  but I understand why you would ignore my request... it's pretty impossible to get a random to join a team
---
mines a junkies/vats hit chance/90% weight reduction. poor 2nd/3rd but I play junkies and thats a free +50% damage all the time.
---
Mines modded with Gamma Wave Emitter, Standard Flamer Barrel, Forceful Stock and a Reflex Sight. Mostly for the condition since it breaks fast. I just sort of run through everything.
---
Im glad you enjoy it. I do as well, even when a legendary two shot handmade drops, and then realize its one star and...level...25....
---
If you could just tell those people that post and ask ‚Äúshould i get this game i dunno blah blah‚Äù that would be great. 
---
Try the game. Dont like it dont play it. Its silly asking someone else if, essentially, they will like a game.
---
Ok, that's hilarious and I'm going to do that. "Hmm, I don't know why it's not working at your camp. It works on mine."
---
Yeah I'm afraid lure weed doesn't seem to actually grow anywhere. So that essentially leaves it as a randomised container resource. Do Anglers drop it sometimes?
---
Yeah, ended up accepting a team invite from some foul mouthed horrid child and have stopped accepting random team invites myself ever since. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Also I‚Äôd say 40% of the dudes I‚Äôve accepted team invites from desperately want to educate me on any and all aspects of the game because I am not a dude and therefor need the extra help, I guess? Truly not worth the hassle all the way around, I feel your pain.
---
This is good.
---
I have a quad handmade, how do I boost that with cards? It isn't auto, I don't have that option. Dmg not even close to 130 lol.
---
I am a shotgunner but only on my survival character.  The reason I'm not a shotgunner in adventure is simply because I love the melee build.  Especially with what I like to call the drunken master melee build (professional drinker, party boy and w/e that one perk that gives you +2 luck is called in the charisma build in addition to all the points in )   The shotgun build is still totally viable and the only reason I don't run my beloved melee build in survival is simply because the shotgun build exists.
---
Even vault boy looks decently sick when heavily irradiated.
---
I'm wondering if there are some entanglements with the "must be in dirt" placements that need to be sorted out first.  We've likely all heard about placing some types of plants in the dirt built into the campfire model, and similar hacks. If the current option is to make a new model with a large expanse of dirt like that, we'd see oddball things like water pumps and purifiers stuck on roofs.  Some of that could be eliminated by keeping the planters small, but that causes its own problems with placement, budget and amount of plants that can be placed.
---
Maybe if they just made new camp items with planters for specific food crops, e.g. corn planter, carrot planter, tato planter, etc.  Seems like that could eliminate most of the potential oddness.
---
Have you tried actually shutting down the PS4 for a few minutes?  Once you do that, unplug all power sources.  Wait 5 minutes.  Clear any dust from the dust catchers, and then plug in all power sources.  Your PS4 should then turn on again.
---
Not mine, but I ran into a guy outside fort defiance with nothing but brotherhood outfits, armor, paints, only legendary laser weapons with the expected weapon mods.
---
Still haven't done any challenges for 4 days in a row, been playing since day 1 but this game demoralizing me. Really hope next mini dlcs are good since the next giant dlc planned &gt;!BattleRoyale!&lt; is going to be something thats not my cup of tea.
---
Man, I REEEEEEEALLY want that chrome paint, on like, every gun, ESPECIALLY the handmade gun. It looks so good on the minigun.
---
1. There is very little chronological order to main quest. Side quests only advance in chronological order.
---
2. All main quests lead into the next if needed. There is no spoiler because each faction is an independent story.
---
3. You explore to avoid missing side quests.
---
What are you? An idiot sandwich.
---
I‚Äôd get a good laugh if I found that out in the wastes.
---
Shotties are pretty bad. Pistol also needs some love with perk pruning.
---
I feel like they could sell for more. You don't come across them all that often and the supplies it takes to make them is stuff that takes an annoying amount of traveling around and server hopping to get.
---
Take a photo of someone wearing mismatched power armor riding a scorchbeast fighting a squirrel while intoxicated on moonshine and 2 seconds from passing out. 10 atoms
---
Forgot all about this, great idea but can we also get to make bag pipes with this?
---
are you in the right cabins? to the east of the cabins you can find the speakers that the screams come from. 
---
have you felt the earthquakes and saw the paintings spinning but never heard the screams? 
---
it is possible to disable the screams if you find a little treehouse but i doubt someone woild have disabled them everytime you played
---
Hmm I wonder you might be right there.
---
Best way to see if they‚Äôll sell for more is to put them in a machine for your preferred price. I do a lot of experimentation and my camp is in a really popular location so I see a lot of traffic.
---
Great. Now I'll be forced to stay home all night handing out individual pieces of halloween candy or you greedy kids will take everything from the honor system bowl I leave out then take a dump in my bed.
---
Agh bummer, I would‚Äôve hoped the SBs would have helped a bit. I love watching enemies attack each other.
---
You are defending the roken release of games. There is no questioning that. Be a pedantic linguist if you must, but your message remains the same. You aregue that we should just accept broken releases.
---
The answer is, and will always be, fuck no.
---
Puncturing is a scrap mod, so another route is to find a power fist plan. I think there are one or two world spawns for power fists too.
---
I think it's just the game because it does that on my Xbox One X too. Hopefully they keep releasing patches to make the game run more smooth
---
The Atom shop has the bar set and a couple different light up beer signs for decoration. If you've got caps to burn you can buy an assortment of fancy furniture at the Studio 58 shop in the lower level of Whitesprings.
---
Beyond that, if you need "regular" materials there's several places to gather them depending on what you want/need. 
---
Wood: Start at Flatwoods and follow the stream south. When you get to the dried river bed turn left (southeast-ish) and follow the riverbed gathering wood from all the fallen logs. With Woodchucker perk you can get 300+ in a matter of minutes.
---
Steel: Go clear out Poseidon power plant. There's probably 100+ scorched in the area, most of which carry weapons that scrap to steel. Kill them all, scrap all their stuff, and you should have 200-300 steel in 20-30 minutes.
---
Concrete: I don't know of any place with massive spawns, but as a general rule you can find at least a few bags of cement at every single farm-related place in the forest. Just wander around to all the different homesteads, the logging camp near 76, the farm supply store down by the nuka plant, etc, and check all the buildings.
---
A game that barely has many build options keeps reducing build options.
---
How fun.
---
I sell junk dumb low. Like less than a cap a peice on a lot of stuff.
---
I've disconnect 4 times in the past 2 hours - grrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
---
I blame patch 9 and pray to RNGesus that the next patch helps somewhat.
---
What platform are you on? I am always looking for those who keep a good stock of items.
---
I‚Äôd go for the armor or extra weight mod... hunting down something and cooking it is pretty easy and quick
---
Even the Enclave‚Äôs American flags are the old 13 star ones. There‚Äôs one right in front of you once you enter Whitesprings bunker. That and the responder outfits (police, fireman) use the 13 star design as well. In FNV: Lonesome Road the old army stuff had...you guessed it...13 stars. So it is quite inconsistent if that is the case
---
Server hop the event at camp Adams ‚Äúcampfire tales‚Äù.  It has a 25% chance to reward a badge per turn in. Avoid the challenges.  A lot of them are busted.  In the time it would take to complete a few of them you could have grounded the badges from the event.  Mind numbing, yes but you get tons of 1* items for the purveyor and once you‚Äôre done, it‚Äôs an event you never have to do again.
---
I'm sitting on about 6000 pieces of Halloween candy and you're gonna be the neighbor that shames me by handing out [full bars](https://tenor.com/view/excited-louise-bobs-burgers-candy-trick-or-treat-gif-4605267)?
---
Right on. I‚Äôve had great luck selling huge stacks of popular ammo. I‚Äôm almost maxed on caps right now.
---
No problem. Also, one other thing I forgot to mention that I almost never see people talk about for those asking about solo play.
---
You can be on a team AND still solo the game. Since there's no distance restrictions or anything and you can swap back to area chat instead of staying on team chat, you can be on a team with some friends you make, but then not at all play together. You'll be able to receive bonus perks from anyone in the team sharing a perk, meaning you can get access to perks you normally don't have by having someone with that perk (and enough Charisma) share it for you. I do this to gain access to rank 5 Makeshift Warrior as my friend has/can share it for me whenever I need it and saves me having to use five levels of perk points to get it. Then if you have someone like me who runs maxed Photosynthetic &amp; maxed Sun Kissed, I share one or the other (depending on what needs healing, HP or Rads) at all times so that whoever is on my team can be passively healed (HP and Rads) regardless of where on the map they are or I am. 
---
Teams can be super helpful even when not playing with the people who are on your team!
---
it is not a stash, purely decorative.  Have never had any problems placing it to date.
---
That's all i put in my punchbowl when i was near Vault 76 :)
---
Well that's as far as I know my friend.
---
I just remembered that small part listed before.. The rest is on Bethesda at this point.
---
I think you would be surprised how little many Wastelanders know about builds and the game in general. Casual players just don‚Äôt spend that kind of time on the game. 
---
I will admit I may have missed the part of spawning IN the shower and can see how annoying it can be. 
---
I think instead of complaining, it would be more effective to lobby for FO4‚Äôs fast travel rugs. Not everyone is willing to rebuild their entire base just so ppl don‚Äôt spawn in their foundations.
---
This game (with no npcs) is supposed to be a multiplayer experience, players looking to not be bothered or only looking for single player experiences are the ones playing the wrong game.  Wish it was embraced with dailies like ‚Äúperform 1k dmg to player structures‚Äù but they forfeited any type of raider game play cause of the vocal whining.
---
I think that it was the fact that this wasn't a brand new title and basically just more of fallout 4. I can't put my finger on what I'd like to see in 76 to make it more redeemable. i'm mostly glad that the game ended up being a multiplayer fallout 4, rather than being like eso or some other type of mmo revamp to make it more theme park or tab target. that would have been more disappointing imo, i'm kinda glad we got a multiplayer fallout with this heavy physics engine really, one thing thats always made these games great is the world interactability.
---
I‚Äôm with you on shotguns, they took it hard last patch.  Rifles thou, rifles are in an amazing spot.  I honestly think rifles should be the target for balance and try and make all other builds match it.  I have a bloody melee guy, a bloody rifle guy and a bloody heavy gunner.  By far the strongest guy overall is the heavy gunner.  Does the most sustained damage on the Queen with almost zero risk of death because being under 20% in PA makes you a tank due to Emergency Protocol and Nerd Rage.  A bloody melee guy will burst for more damage but you‚Äôre squishy and on the queen more than likely gonna have to switch to a vampire weapon or eat a rad away bumping you out of Nerd Rage for a bit.
---
Sounds like fun - sign me up
---
do think we could harass bethesda into making it a stash? XD
---
Haha maybe I was clear. On fo76 for tadpole challenge. Unless that was a joke then yes I did turn it off and back on again, still haven‚Äôt completed quest
---
I also had the quest Wendigo as a second one that ran in after I killed the first one. Was only expecting one because I had cleared the cave without the quest a day or two before.
---
Are we sure two Wendigos happening like that isn't standard for the quest?
---
Go play fo4 that‚Äôs a single player experience... this game intended to have player interactions both positive and negative
---
I've been playing since day 1 beta, so yes, I do remember. During that time I played smart. I played as my life depended on it. I avoided high traffic areas. 
---
I'm sorry to hear about your run ins with griefers. As a fellow wasteland architect, i can respect your love for the build. And i will agree with you on the area of camp destruction. In the last 2 months I have moved my builds out of their clandestine locations for all to enjoy.
---
And what I'm talking about with blood pumping and wondering if today is the day. If someone shoots at me, I'm going to fight back. That's part of the game, part of the fun (for me anyway). Walking over encumbered lost part of its excitement when you get shot in the face and take no damage.
---
Your reply to my response regarding another player killing me for my junk contradicts your opening paragraph. How did they kill you if you didn't engage in pvp? 
---
I am far from deluded about this everyone wants to be a winner. Who in life inspires to be a loser? Things shouldn't be nerfed because everyone crys that its OP and they cant win. Go out and find that gear. Tweak your build. 
---
I will agree that 3rd party pay to win (i.e ebay) has hurt the whole pvp aspect. But this isnt a new problem. It's been happening since the dawn of mmo's with tradable items. 
---
Now I do agree with a proper pvp server. I've been saying for months, there needs to be a pvp server with craftable items only. This will eliminate god roll 1 shot items and make it skill based.
---
Same here man hope 76 can be as optimized as 4
---
So there will be 2 queens flying around?
---
You can complete the survival challenge in adventure mode btw. I've had that happen for the last 3 weeks
---
I don't lock anything on the off chance a briefer cab use it to level my base, plus most people assume my extractor is locked so they don't bother checking.
---
I‚Äôll be on in 30 min and I would be happy to help. 
---
PSN schneebolt
---
Lvl116 never even been there. I have an AA .50 1* and all rise. Don't feel strong enough to try.
---
I just nuked with a great friend(you know who you are) and the nuke sorta did complete the quest. Didn‚Äôt even do everything, the nuke just ends it.
---
It‚Äôs even worse when the only light you get while running away is the lasers shooting at you. Spoopy
---
I find the majority of camps I visit are all locked (literally no idea why) and the vending machines like you say are just at the back of their house, so dull.
---
aha
---
I managed to get the tourist fairly quickly by fast travelling between Philippi Battlefield Cemetery, Prickett's Fort, Palace of the Winding Path and Colonel Kelly Monument. Since they are all right next to each other it only costs a few caps to fast travel between them all. I got it on my second character after 3 server hops and about 30 caps.
---
Yup, same. And I'm in power armor so I'm like ???
---
I had that couple of times when a bugged AI ran away from a Workshop and i stumbled apon it and killed it.  
---
Inside watoga medical?  Well... no idea
---
Yeah but im already able to carry about 340 lbs without that mod. I like the fridge one because I can start making some of the items I used to like to keep like sweet rolls and cranberry grinders. I ran good with salt from beta up until about 2 weeks ago when I discovered mutations lol
---
I always assume it's people trying to fast travel to my vendor and they click on me by accident or something. I don't accept an invite unless it's some super friendly dude with a mic I met during the free range event.
---
Yay!  Serenading West Virginia with the pipes would be a great way to get well tuned!
---
Go to r/Fo76 and on the top right corner is where ypu can change it
---
For more clarification, *any target over some threshold off the ground* has a 0% chance.
---
I had a snallygaster randomly hop up a few metres in the air for a while but despite being eye-to-eye-to-eye-to-eye with it, I couldn't hit.
---
30? For one queen? Uhhhh what. With my FE gat plasma I use maybe 5 per queen, less if its an easy one. You must be emptying whole cores at her while she's flying or something. First rule of SBQ is don't shoot while she's flying.
---
I buy all steel I come across
---
It just
---
I have a legendary suppressors rolling pin, I haven‚Äôt used it yet but I‚Äôm holding on to it just for laughs!
---
Got one as a loot drop, so I will validate there is such a thing.
---
Unfortunately, I turned it in for scrip yesterday.
---
I've come across a few where the doors were locked and the vending machines were inside.
---
FWIW, I only had one in my playthrough of that quest, but it was a bit more of a running battle that time, almost like you need to get "jumped" to progress.
---
As long as you have PA and some stims, it's not difficult to survive. If you want to pull your weight in damage output then try to get a useful one-star legendary, and make sure it's a dpm weapon not a slow-firer.
---
You don't need team coordination for the queen. Just bring plenty of ammo and work hard. There's a weapons workbench in a shed to the west of Drop Site v9 if you don't have repair kits.
---
My water purifiers are all locked. It's my water not yours. This is the wasteland, buy your shit and move on.
---
On that note, I will usually drop 25-30 purified waters for low levels or others that help me. Other wise I'm a thirsty mf! I have the speed demon mutation and I'm constantly using psychotats.
---
It didn't have to be 20 unique people. I got mine by killing people with bounties, or killing people trying to kill me for my bounties. I got the other half off of one guy who we continuously fought for awhile. Just get a really good weapon, I use a two shot gauss rifle, and make sure you have marsupial.
---
I started in February, afraid I was getting into Rust with Nukes. I couldn't have been more wrong. Other than a couple of notable jackasses (my first day, and last day before CAMP protection) the player base have been great fun to interact with or ignore as the mood strikes me. People are friendly and helpful to new players, and will cooperate on stuff all the time.
---
If you want to carve out your own little chunk of Appalachia and maybe say "hello" to the neighbors once in a while, this game is for you.
---
"Now drink this. The tick blood puts a buzz in your bonnet and the nuclear waste will put hair on your chest!"
---
Same. I suspect it's these 2 particular items specifically. I haven't heard of any others.
---
Man that‚Äôs even worse, there‚Äôs no reason for camps to be locked anymore either
---
My favorites are the ones where you have to play hide and seek because you spawned at the bottom of a hill on the back side of the house and there three doors with the vending machine located in a back corner of a hallway.
---
I see this all the time but please dont post about the railway rifle. We don't want nerfthesda to ruin another weapon for reason.
---
maybe, or when display cases come out we could stock it with food
---
YEAH HES RIGHT FUCK THE BAG
---
They seem to be the only ones that do. I want to be a wildlife photographer. I've got my zoom lense, my chameleon mutation. I want to capture the majestic beauty of the mirelurk queen. 
---
But my f#*&amp;ing camera is turning me into a trophy hunter.
---
I kept seeing the pictures rotate and thought it was a glitch. I have like two or three recordings on my Xbox of it. lol
---
It worked for me as well.  People were spawning right on the edge of the cliff then fall off.  So I moved the C.A.M.P. to the middle front of my house and now people are spawning on the other side of my house, next to it.  My spawn spot stayed the same.
---
Heh.  Punctuation matters...

Ha closed minded, like it. It‚Äôs not real life and the only lesson learned is there‚Äôs lots of dick heads on the net.
---
I read this somewhere over the weekend and only did the event once each day. All that guy said was that it would award badges after you became a possum, so I figured they were just mistaken. Makes sense though with the percentage chance. The up siide is it is a super short event. Thanks man. I really appreciate it. Sounds like I can bang out all the upgrades in a few nights this way.
---
LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
The write the damn tool!
---
Right?
---
I‚Äôm not positive, but I‚Äôm guessing it means kill as in you get the killing blow. Which can be hard on the Queen fight. 
---
But it‚Äôs probably straight up bugged. I don‚Äôt have it either, and I‚Äôve probably got close to a hundred queen kills, and I run automatic heavy weapons, so my chances of nailing the killing shot are high
---
I saw that too but couldn't find him there either. I'll check again when I get home.

I have also heard a fully modded gamma gun is quite effective at well since it negates any health regen
---
Sent thank you
---
Back in the stress test on Xbox before the beta nights were pitch black, it was so much better
---
 i mean, if you lose your rads, just go stand in some water for a bit, or stand by some radioactive waste barrels, the game is filled with them
---
since you are not engaging in direct battle at that point since you say you are fast traveling to simply check out vendors, then there is no reason to be upset about losing some rads.
---
you could always just not use fast travel directly to people CAMPS if this worries you so much, just fast travel to the nearest map marker closest to the CAMP you want to go to, then you can be sure you wont spwan into a decon arch
---
Good luck!
---
Absolutely!  And if you‚Äôre a carnivore mutant like me you‚Äôll get tons of glowing meat to cook into steaks!!!
---
Only to find out everything is overpriced or you simply don't need anything... sigh...
---
I built my camp next to a yao guai spawn to farm acid and most of the time someone spawns, a couple glowing yao guai spawn too... hows that for welcoming? üòÇ
---
Yeah as a bloody I can kill a normal scorchbeast in 2-3 hits with my DCG but I normally have about 40 hp so a stiff wind can kill me :/ i think that's a fair trade off personally
---
This is also great and something I don‚Äôt see enough of. 
---
Like a Executioners Gamma Gun? Good night I‚Äôm out.
---
Nothing that gives armor penetration works with any energy damage type. So no plasma/flamer/laser.
---
Agree. Its so obvious that vending was last on there minds. I hate running thru someones huge house only to see the machines are out back on the ground. If your house is locked i will try to get inside, especially if you used the big windows.
---
We have to ban players for that...
---
I just scored a 3-star gatling vampire laser from the purveyor.  Base damage was 25 which pissed me off so i was about to shred it to re-roll but thought, maybe i should at least try it.  I have never been into energy weapons and drop or scrap all energy weapons when I get them.
---
yikes tho.  It seems powerful.  its also weightless so only weighs like 2.5 lbs.  However, it does use FCs which is not ideal.  I typically set up camp a couple of times a week on a power plat or farm cores so its ok for now.
---
My personal favorite was this dickhead‚Äôs trap house where the vending machines were in a room rigged to kill you.
---
Not everyone is going to mess with your camp. Best be fussy who you team up with all the same. A good team really enhanced the game for me.
---
Louis Jordan - Open the Door Richard.
---
To be fair it does prevent marsupial from ignoring all melee attacks, but the range is kinda unbelievable on ghouls.
---
Of course there is. I don't want anyone going in my camp.
---
I bought the camo paint as the description made me believe that it would work for more than just the hunting rife..
---
Happy Fasnacht! After completing the main missions so quickly I created a new character and focused on the side missions only. See you in the wasteland.
---
Amen to that. I‚Äôm hoping fast travel rugs are in our future.
---
The guys I run with are trying to gather a few up. We dont PvP in 76 but our travels tend to put us at odds with people who do. Especially myself since I supply a lot of aid and junk the others need to make weapons, armor, and ammo. Though I have seen a new underhanded tactic with workshops were someone will wait until you are busy crafting, contest the workshop and get you when you are not looking.
---
How tf does it work? I feel like you could just escape.
---
Have you ever seen a player running around with his camera?
---
why would I want to paint my camera???
---
cool story bro
---
Scrap a bunch, you can learn all the plans from scrapping
---
Keep trying to control both sides, seems to be the only way you win arguments. Thanks for the thrilling discussion you have enlightened me so.
---
Also one of my buddies has a normal one with a repeater on it and fully modded out. Not only does it shoot fast but its like being able to use a Scorchbeast scream but with radiation.
---
Spitballing as a software dev:
---
* Purveyor rolls Wood Armor as the armor type (should this be on the 2\* and 3\* lists if it's capped at 1\*?)
---
* Three effects are applied without checking the item type (should type limits be checked here?)
---
* Player gets a 3\* Wood Armor (should this be allowed to exist in inventory when it's picked up?)
---
* Player logs off
---
* Inventory is audited when saved to server
---
* Wood Armor is limited to 1\* only, so the second and third effect are not saved
---
Never accept team invites from randoms. I send them a msg telling them to piss off.
---
12,000?
---
Recently? Or back when bobblehead stacking was a thing?
---
Wow that's ****ing awful. How come this game released half a year ago and the perk doesn't work with half of the guns?
---
There he is. The guy with no imagination with a vending machine leaned up against his crap shack of a house in the dirt.
---
how about being able to tag plans that we need so we dont have to message or pay caps and fast travel just to see that they dont have the plan we need.
---
The day vending came out, i unlocked all my doors and resource collectors, i blew a hole in my wall and added a garage door that's always open. Leads straight into open area with vending machines. You have all workbenches and stash around them, plus some purifiers (unlocked) and steel collector for my visitors. To the side i have some crops and a brahmin.
---
Front has instruments for your enjoyment and a bedroom in the back if you need some rest.
---
Enjoy...
---
Nice bro.
---
These posts make me glad I'm in such a wholesome community. Its sad a small minority of griefers can soil it all though.
---
I think if you enjoy the fallout series, you're gonna love 76. Most gamer haterade is from die hard gamers with extremely high expectations of the fallout franchise.
---
If you're casually wandering through Appalachia, you will never run out of materials as fast as they're implementing more and more. My brother plays seldom and we started playing at release. I've been barely able to keep up with the new content, he is overwhelmed by it. 
---
There may come a time in your experience that you get a glimpse of the end game stuff and wanna rush forward and participate, but don't. Enjoy your game. Read the terminal emails, the random notes. Explore that building, jog over to the new location and have a look see. Don't forget to enjoy the game for what it is. Bethesda has so much detail in the actual game that they focused on, you will thoroughly enjoy your experience. 
---
Don't be a check the box Dweller. Enjoy your life in Appalachia!
---
You'll have no problem playing solo. It is possible to do most things without a team, if you want. With the way that PvP works now, you should not have problems with high level players killing you, either. Only in specific situations is PvP a possibility (like workshops, not to be confused with your own camp), and even if you die you barely lose anything.
---
Some people returned the game early on, so maybe you can get a used copy cheap.
---
Come on in and join the fun.
---
I LOVE your build! I love seeing custom and unique builds and this one is definitely up there for one of the most creative I've seen by far, he'll you even have your character named to match the build and everything hahaha. Great job mateüëç
---
Tiny room with a pressure plate and 6,000,000 rigged traps. In the 2 seconds it took to register wtf was happening, I was dead. (And lvl 75 at the time so I wasn‚Äôt in complete lowbie territory. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
---
I at least thought that with the purveyor, you would be able to see weapons or armor that you don't ever see/loot in the game.  Boy was I wrong....level 120+...still never had the luck to see, let alone loot an explosive or two shot weapon, never saw a legendary hunting rifle or even Sentinel or cavalier armor among other things.  1000 scrip over 24 hours and different servers produced mostly 3\* knives, nocturnal shotguns, and useless 3 star laser/plasma guns.  I'm on xb, anyone else see anything like this? like your RNG loot pool never changes? even had 3 players pull an explosive from a Scorchbeast and I pulled a nocturnal pipe? ....just doesn't make sense to me
---
I dont sell shotgun rounds b/c I have a L108 friend that uses them...so I pick them up, then pass them on when we meet up.
---
Yeah, i was thinking 3-star = 100 scrips.  My mistake
---
I doubt it but do you still have plasma grenade plans ?
---
Hmmm... interesting
---
I'm 150 and that cave still freaks me out. I hate how it takes 30 seconds for the wendigo to spawn, as I'm waiting for it to drop from the ceiling, the anxiety building up.
---
What is the plan called just checked all the stores and can‚Äôt seem to find it.
---
Was he laughing at you in the tighty-whities?
---
the ultimate humiliation....
---
It was that, most assuredly.
---
Oh gosh is that legal? Todd is that legal?
---
The fridge wasn‚Äôt my 1st choice, I went for extra capacity instead because I have the carnivore mutation so I can eat spoiled food and it‚Äôs everywhere tbh, when I‚Äôm in a nuke zone gathering flux I just swap in good with salt perk to stop it from spoiling, the next one I‚Äôm going for is lead lined as I have a low health build but that ones prob not useful if your not trying to maintain a certain rad level but the armoured one would be good whatever your build with the extra damage resistance. The badges don‚Äôt come easy so it‚Äôs a tough choice but repeatedly doing the camp tales event could get you some as there‚Äôs a small chance a badge can drop from the event.
---
To much camp budget for that bs
---
try that in the middle of the night on a full surround sound system :)
---
Played the game this weekend for the first time in a few months. Had a blast, really enjoyed every second of it.
---
And do it without opening your map!  That's the real challenge.
---
Did you get those prefixes multiple times? The preferentiality typically does not show in 10-20 drops, more like 40-100, which is far more common than a typical 1:200 drop chance.
---
I had this happen with a two star rolling pin that turned to one star after logging out, so it' not just the wood armor thing but the loot from the purveyor is generally bugged.
---
I have one where I was living in cranberry bog right near Watoga (had a gold and copper extractor if anyone knows where I‚Äôm talking about). I‚Äôm pretty sure I was server hopping but I can‚Äôt remember why... 
---
Anyways this last time while I was loading (of course sometimes your camp takes forever to load) my controller was shaking like something was hitting me. I started running around and wondering what was going on. Then I heard a SB. Oh great.. 
---
Turns out, while my game was loading, a low level player (probably about level 40) was running from 3 SB and while he was running, my house spawned right on him.  So the SB‚Äôs were destroying my camp trying to kill him. Once I loaded I was already such low health so I took off running so I could watch from afar and grasp what was happening. 
---
I could‚Äôve been mad, but really I was so confused I just laughed. I can‚Äôt remember if I ended up leaving or stayed but I know I didn‚Äôt kill them. The level 40 just ran off lol. It was really funny and like a ‚Äúwtf?!‚Äù moment.
---
When I played (month or so ago) my shot-gunner medic I also used concentrated fire (perception). After 2-4 shots (in VATS) on the same body part the accuracy bonus was so high I could effectively snipe with a shotgun (I also used skeet shooter and enforcer). I had no trouble reliably crippling anything at a very respectable distance.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's somewhat basic design but it's easily accessible and has everything you need at your fingertips. 
---
I figure even if you don't buy, you won't waste a trip since you can use workbenches, stash, sleep, play, or help yourself to some crops and water. 
---
I'd like to think grabbing a couple waters alone reimburses you for the fast travel expenses :)
---
Sure can!
---
While this may not be what you're after, the cooking station with the firepit &amp; cinderblocks fits very snugly underneath them - might be able to use the ground cooking station to fit it closer.
---
Really? Wow!
---
Been having the same issue. Afaik it isn't in the list. What might work (but I haven't tried) is going to a crafting bench, selecting something you have all the parts for and that requires wood to craft, and hitting the tag button there. It should clear out any resources you have enough of.
---
just don't wear flip-flops in the cave for the floor spikes don't always sneak between the toes..
---
nothing is real its all vr...
---
Because?
---
I have a 1* one if you‚Äôre interested in it.
---
wow, you are a sad person, you have no idea what my camp is like, i kinda feel bad for you to be so angry about a non-issue that you start to accuse other people of nonsense
---
actually, i feel like you fit right into what is wrong with people nowadays, if you dont like something...COMPLAIN! YOU ARE OUTRAGED! and if anyone disagrees with you, then ACCUSE THEM OF TRUMP-ED UP NONSENSE ACCUSATIONS WITH NO PROOF
---
aaaaaaand you are blocked, enjoy your sad life, angry life.  I kinda feel sad for you.
---
I created a brand new little inside area of my camp just for my vendor. I put all my workbenches in there, and keep the rest of my house locked up (because privacy, you know?) that is mostly upstairs from the shop area. That's where my jukebox is, keeps people from turning off my tunes. I still need to do more decorating and fill up the punch bowl, but I figured I might as well keep people safe from the elements while they shop.
---
I've got 3 so far; the first 2 are in a little shop area,  armor and guns, and plans and stimpaks and shit. Then the 3rd is in my bar/restaurant area and only sells food and drink.
---
I think it has to do with the Railway Rifle firing actual projectiles rather than using hitscan. This also happens with the Harpoon Gun, which also fires actual projectiles. What baffles me is that the Syringer doesn't fire projectiles and uses hitscan instead.
---
I specifically wrote that it should require lots of hard to get materials. That it would require patience. Nowhere did it state easy. In fact, it stated the opposite. That it should be hard and take time, but that it over time would reward a patient person with what they are looking for.
---
I work with people. My professional work for the last 19 years is in social work with other people. I have a large family. Not really sure what would give you the idea that I don't meet people.
---
Same. I got nothing I could use, and most of it was heavy stuff like missile launchers. That taught me to buy stuff from Murmgh first, before I max out the scrip machine for the day, so I can scrap the heaviest stuff first.
---
They might be adding a way to share items between accounts already, &gt;!recent datamined showed next utility item is a mailbox but what its for and why its listed in utility section isn't known for sure, I doubt it would be for players to give free items to people they visit instead I'm betting its for storage between characters. !&lt;
---
Or if you drink alcohol prior to playing an instrument you play it horribly?
---
Did I say I was outraged? No. You were being a dick so I responded accordingly. You bringing your political agenda into it isnt helping you either. It's more sad to be lurking around posting sarcastic bs on people's posts for no reason.
---
One time use works too. As long as it requires both caps, time and materials that are hard to get,  so the time vs reward makes sense.
---
Sad oversight from Bethesda to not include option to see it even if owner not there.
---
I would like the bastards out there to stop stealing my resources like bandits.  Day or night!
---
We did the revive ally achievement in the Mire - there is a spot called the Maw or something like this and there is a specific spot where there is a rock just below the water and I had my friend (bloody so low health anyways) jump off and land on that rock - it's still in the water and that counted. 
---
For the brahmin I just took a picture of one in flatwoods and it counted - also just server hopped at flatwoods to milk the brahmin - if someone has milked it before you then it won't work so you just have to hop until you get milk - i think flatwoods is the best because there are at least 6 brahmin there. 
---
you can also pick up the smores recipe from server hopping at camp adams and doing the event campfire tales at night.
---
or, you could grow up and realize no one gives a shit about your stupid post, you should just delete it, you are embarrassing yourself
---
i offer actual solutions to your petty "problem" and you get even more upset! man you must live a sad life, i kinda feel sorry for you actually
---
I can tell you dont handle reality well, if you dont get YOUR way, and if everyone doesnt cater to YOU, then you get OUTRAGED!
---
living that entitled life. huh?
---
I AM PUTTING THIS IN CAPS SO ITS EASY FOR THE DEVS TO READ. PUT FUCKING UNIQUE ID NUMBERS ON WEAPONS AND AROMOR! MAKES DUPING GO BYE BYE AND CAN EASILY TRACK ITEMS. QUIT CUTTING CORNERS!
---
I‚Äôd say of the two responses this one seems much angrier. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Bethesda support is terrible. I can't help you, but I hope someone can.
---
Personally hoping they add musical instruments we can play while exploring wasteland, I would love to play the bag pipes while in a fight with sheepsquash to just to show it what I plan on doing to it after Im done.
---
No one should reply to this guy. Hes just a troll, he goes around trying to start bs on any post he can. Not worth you time.
---
No it's just the audio files, but those are telling enough. Literal hours of dialouge about pvp, none about pve. All of ZAX's dialouge is in the files, if there was any pve we would know
---
I keep seeing that but wheres the source in game? Is there one?. Idr seeing that anywhere would like to see it.
---
Pretty bad trade off compared to bloodied ranged weapons, tbh. I think many people who complain about melee haven't tried that.
---
I won‚Äôt go into detail right now because there are lots of other answers; but honestly I am thoroughly enjoying the game, I have two accounts now.  They also have a big road map of tons of updates with tons of new stuff
---
Yeah he was probably in there picking in you because he tried playing survival and wasn't as good as he thought.
---
So glad lots of high level peeps showed up for my first nuke launch last weekend. Glad to see you got some help too. After 5 months of playing it's great to finally have the nuke done and dusted. She was a total tank but my lever action crits seemed to actually take some health out if her.
---
Lol I get this a lot, I play as a female character (starlet sniper outfit pushed me to that). Lots of other *guys* will try and teach me things I already know and then I‚Äôll just respond over my mic... I‚Äôve some interesting reactions, one of which was some dumbass thinking and insisting I was trans because I have a female character.
---
lol yea but weird fact, most dupers and players who exploited game to store mass amount of items passed stash limit never got banned, this was either due to rules for consoles as I don't know situation on PC or so it wouldn't demolish player base for fallout 76, you can see some of this when hoping camps and seeing them store passed 800 stash limit.
---
Wendigos used to terrify me, then I found King Mirelurks.
---
&lt;shudder&gt;
---
Maybe that aren't shopkeeper and just want to have a yardsale...
---
Sounds like an origin story.
---
They really need to buff ranged back like it was. I was in a nuke zone yesterday and several people all shooting the same glowing feral to try and kill it and I walk up and one swing does what took them 100 rounds. I think it would be a mistake to nerf melee after this and if they do, they need to take the DR way down on a lot of enemies. After shotgun nerf 2.0 I ran into about 8 super mutant warlords and I couldn't kill one with my shotty. I switch to melee and it's still challenging to finish the enclave event, but would have been very unlikely with the shotty. RIP
---
Possibly, but I actually thank him for giving me purpose in an area of the game I've never focused on before.
---
Yes, known bug that has never been removed. Enjoy the extra carry weight while you can...
---
At least put in on your porch then
---
I use a V.A.T.S CRIT build and with shotguns it's really effective as you need to be close so the hit chance is always near 100.
---
I have the same outfit! üòä 
---
Lord what a jackass. It‚Äôs pretty astounding, isn‚Äôt it?
---
A roadmap is always good. That already makes me have faith
---
So which is it supposed to be? 200+ or 100+? Thanks
---
With that said, could you please provide a volume slider for the holotapes or have all other audio levels dropped while a holotape is playing?
---
I've seen this a lot. I think anytime someone clears a workshop area and a workshop is able to be claimed the game notifies the entire server. I wish they would do this for other events like campfire tales etc.
---
Yes it's a bug. Excavator is only supposed to give you +100 extra carry weight, not 200. 
---
At least not without adding calibrated shocks, which adds an additional +100, bringing total to +200lbs carry weight. 
---
At which point you can still glitch for an extra 100. (300 total)
---
I don't have much problems because I'm a Bloody Melee / Rifle build so I pick things off with my Bloody Lever and if they get close my Deathclaw Gauntlet ^ ^
---
It's worth noting that the game doesn't explicitly tell you that you earned a badge from the event, and it doesn't show up with the other rewards. The only way to know if you got one is to go into the stats section of your pipboy and scroll over to the new "collections" tab to see how many badges you've earned.
---
Same thing happens to assaultron heads, except instead of the last two it removes the first star. It's happened to me twice.
---
another OUTRAGED sad person is see...
---
Its been a bug since launch. Excavator gives plus 100 cw (200 with calibrated shocks) but the bug gives it 200 when you leave and join a server while in the armor.
---
My house is up in the monorail tower, I simply don't have room for one in that cramped hallway of a house. I did build a nice patio for it though.
---
I didn't know you could repair another player's base. In ashamed...üò∂
---
1. Cause it's a hold over from when camps could be destroyed.
---
2. To keep mobs out of the house. If your door is unlocked, ever Tom,Jane and molerat. Will walk right in heading for your generators if the can get to them if not the heads to the nearest wall. Course people are stingy, or don't understand / have the plans for powered doors or advanced power connectors.
---
3. People are lazy
---
4. People have an over inflated who that they have to stroke every time they come home.
---
5. Idiots who visit can't close the door after they leave.
---
Please take your pick of any one or multiples.
---
I'm a Futthly Casual, none of my stuff it's locked and all my doors are powered. On PC outside of watogga. I can usually be found flinging nukes at the SBQ each night. Did quite a few last night. After one of them I went to travel to my base noticed that it wasn't broadcasting that I'm selling items. Fast traveled and there's 10 muties 3 glowing gulpers and a hord of crickets eating my shubbery.
---
Hers 2 rules I wish people would follow.
---
1. Clost the Damm DOOR. 
---
2. If ya fast travel to a vendor. And mobs spawn kill them. Dont just leave. 
---
Well happy hunting and vending in the wastes. Stay casual out there. ü§£
---
Perhaps the one you bought is for the .45 Submachine gun, not the 10mm one?
---
I have 4 purifiers at my camp.  They are open to whomever wants them.  I also have speed demon and use chems and running out of water is never a problem. 
---
Then again I tend to fix peoples stuff in their camps as well but if locked no fix for you.  Next time I see a locked one I‚Äôll leave a special present for you instead.  Mole rat surprise!
---
You're the real hero!
---
Upvoting for ‚Äúfork out the shekel‚Äù.
---
If you need me, I‚Äôll be getting some t-shirts made.
---
Well... to the best of my knowledge, it never worked in FO4 either. So it‚Äôs been... 5 years?
---
Interesting. That may work explain some of it but I will have to go back and check the situations where it happens. I could have swore one of them was basically me trying to shoot a super mutant in the chest from zero range while it bashed my head in.
---
Its been like that from day 1. Quite a beneficial glitch really. Just dont exit armor.
---
They really can. I try to avoid as many people as possible just because of that reason, but I'm glad this time I didn't.
---
I got a cap and a hairbrush from two,
---
No worries, still kinda of hoping Bethesda changes Legendary vendor after this debacle to instead sell legendary mods so we can just choose what we want to put on our equipment especially when late game you get wreaked without proper legendary gear and that includes PVP &gt;!which next big dlc is a battle royale mode with singles or teams and appears will have new pvp mode related perks to equip like the one with dog nose sniffing suitcase animation find nuke boxes which is for launching nukes.!&lt;
---
Day 1? How is this not fixed? haha oh well.
---
This person gets it!   Upvote
---
Once you get a few members pool together your resources and make a bazzar-like shop with various items for sale. I'm not sure how closely you can place camps to other camps but try to place them as close as possible and I'm sure all those vendor symbols will draw players in as customers as well as new recruits. Then maybe build a PvP arena and host events. Maybe set up a chat where people can post when they want to party up.
---
How much flux will we get?
---
That would be cool, but u doubt we'll be role-playing as Spartans anytime soon.
---
I don't think Bethesda can add that code in not sure if it was in for or not. But they would have to update the engine ALOT to add volumetric lighting to it as it stands.
---
Im ps4. I prefer not to advertise. That would force me to actually grind in order to keep it stocked. I like it when a whale comes strolling in. They‚Äôll check the first two machines, and see the usual crap that everyone is hawking.  Then they‚Äôll notice the machine around the corner, sitting between two ivory pillars, and know instinctively that they‚Äôre in the VIP section.
---
thats what I was thinking.
---
Keyword shouldn't but lest you forget this isn't Bethesda A team and they focused on the next big dlc we been getting hints for (Spoiler ahead) &gt;!Battle Royale mode.!&lt;
---
Where are you located that someone would want to nuke your base?
---
yeah was talking to a dude with a mic. He's like "I tried to get this guy to pvp with me and he got all mad and reported me." I was like "so go to survival, you're more likely to find people actually interested in pvp there" and he goes "but I don't want to lose my aid"
---
Some dude tried to take my workshop the other day and we traded a few kills and he left and it was actually kind of fun. You just have to have the mindset "ok if I take over this workshop that's a sign to everyone around that I'm willing to pvp" There's other ways to farm stuff if you really need it, after all
---
That's not a bad idea! If I come across someone that needs help like I did I'll try that.
---
What happened to you blocking me kiddo? Btw I saw that you use that same "you're a sad person and I feel bad for you" line on like 20 other people in your comment history.  Do you have a single original thought in your head?
---
right, the OP says right in his post title ".. I can't stand you."
---
entitled and angry people are coming out of the woodworks today!
---
step away from the game a bit, go outside, remember you are not the center of the universe!
---
unless a desk was provided with it attached with a chair
---
That was a rather rough estimate. Maybe 10, but alone it'll eat up more than just 5 plasmacores.
---
This. The hardened receiver for the 10mm SMG is a scrap mod, so you can't buy it.
---
First really cool thing I‚Äôve seen building
---
How difficult would it have to be? Good raid teams kill SBQs for about 30 times a day while doing the same would take casuals two or three months. Gap between dedicated players and casuals is already big in this game and what you be suggesting will widen disparities even further between players
---
On the other side of the coin I always join random team invites lol. Haven't had a bad thing happen yet (knock on wood).
---
yea I was thinking the same with having a desk &amp; chair already attached to it
---
The Flatwoods Monster is stalking me.  
---
I encountered him first north west of Grafton in the cliffs.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3qcW2Ya.png](https://i.imgur.com/3qcW2Ya.png)  
---
I fired a round and hit, he disappeared.  
---
The next day I return to my camp to scrap/rest/etc. He's directly under my stilt house.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/qGHu8lu.png](https://i.imgur.com/qGHu8lu.png)  
---
I again shot him once and he vanished.  
---
I forgot to take a screenshot of my next encounter, but I found him north west of sugar grove in the cliffs again. Fired a round at him, disappeared. I was looking everywhere for him, then the god damn insult bot came out of nowhere and insulted me, so I shot him. Never found the flatwoods monster.  
---
I'm awaiting my next encounter. Being level 40, I've had a few people tell me that I have seen it quite a lot for my amount of gametime.  
---
So I'm convinced he's stalking me.
---
WHY ARE YOU GIVING THEM IDEAS YOU FOOL!
---
Yeah, projectile weapons are a big no-no for online games because the physics of the projectiles are rendered by the server rather than the client. This causes projectile weapons to behave unpredictably.
---
This is fucking creative.
---
yeah, i jump up super high out of reach of an enemy, and they somehow are able to melee me in mid air....
---
That would be highly frowned upon, if you could just spend real money to keep gambling on 3* legendaries... You thought the repair kits pay-to-win outrage was bad, this would be received way worse!
---
Your right on deleting the post. It's not getting the type of response I thought it would. I am not asking people to change how they play the game. I was just looking for some common curtesy when you put up vending machines and invite me to your camp.
---
My bloody unarmed rarely misses using a power fist even in vats (not flying enemies of course) but I switch to a 2 handed melee he starts missing. My fist damage is 400 - 1000 depending on factors like drugs/my hp. I only run 2 unyielding armor.
---
" Bugs have been Minimal " ... Ahahaha hahaha
---
See. Even though you have no room for one you made a patio for it. Some people are just throwing em on the ground out back
---
My camp was nuked by a squad I helped with nuking (very ungrateful), had to rebuild the camp from the ground up because repair costs were too high. Someone repaired my industrial water purifiers and then gave up. Don't know who, but we should at least be able to.
---
They better not. That would break their non pay-to-win promise they made (more than they already have with repair kits) and it would be super unfair you could get any legendary so long as you have the funds
---
Ouch, hope you get better soon.
---
And so that the enemies are harder to see üëç
---
(Okay scrubboi49 do not blow this...just talk to her about something you are familiar with and you‚Äôll lock that down)
---
...and THAT will be the day i stop playing
---
Son, you're doin' it wrong.  (At least until they fix this bug).
---
I have the opposite : those shotgunners seem to be everywhere - can't seem to turn a corner without a Tse shotgunner turning up.
---
Bethesda walked a fine line with the repair kits, this would probably cross it.
---
At least if they left it unmitigated. But if they keep same restrictions, like 150 daily limit, by all means. Waste your money while everyone else can easily hit 150 limit with a quick 15min whitesprings run.
---
Lol nah I just mean that heavy helmet look, bit like the illusive Assault Marine helm or what Power Armour has
---
Lol no ...yes they would make money but they would ruin this game completely if they did that ..that would be the true definition of pay to win
---
Thanks very much for your input all, managed to find him at the water park, will be fun being snap happy instead of trigger happy for a while!
---
what do you mean i‚Äôm sorry ?
---
They can't because it's essentially gambling, and gambling items are forbidden in games in many countries. Even the US is bringing in a bill to stop them from being in games.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt do the messaging part, everyone. It‚Äôs 1000% better to just totally ignore them.
---
At launch, WoW was so bad they were refunding (crediting I guess) subscription time because there would be multiple days when the servers were dead.  And that lasted many, many months.
---
People still complain about maintenance downtime (there and here both).  But when you could go a few *days* without access, maintenance seems like such a trifle.
---
It‚Äôs like a 10% chance of getting badges. Keep grinding.
---
If only the poor sucker knew he‚Äôs talking to a married pregnant lady. Hahahaha.
---
You mean they would be idiotic if the DID sell it. 
---
That is pay to win. Real money buying a chance at OP items. That company would burn so quickly if they tried it.
---
From a marketing standpoint, it's great. From a consumer standpoint, it's riot material.
---
Sometimes I swear it feels like if you were in range when the enemy started swinging, it‚Äôll hit no matter what even if you get out of the way. 
---
I don‚Äôt expect hitboxes of dark souls quality, but still. Feels like once they start swinging it doesn‚Äôt matter where you are
---
I don't think the Alien blaster has legendary variants
---
Thanks brother. Didnt know this. I just went up to the vending machine to check but I still didnt have any.
---
Yassssss
---
Wait I'm a a newbie to speed demon, what I'm getting from this, there is a chem for that mutation that improves it?
---
It state you can get a pipe revolver through datamining and i havnt seen any1 woth one yet
---
It's a PIA but start walking between points instead of fast traveling. He'll find you I've killed a few Mothmen and a single Flatwoods Monster by doing this.
---
I know it's tough to walk when you work and have a family. It really limits how long you can play. I'm in the same boat my friend.
---
Lol.
---
Damn. I play on PC and have nothing do with my 60k caps. It's hard to buy top end weapons for caps on PC. Even I don't sell my top end gear because most of the time I am too close to the cap max.
---
Of *course* she hits like a MAC. Where do you think her parts came from?
---
I‚Äôm a casual player too. I started in the beta, and have only made it to level 70, and honestly I feel like I play all the time, meaning maybe an hour or so every other day.
---
To be honest, when this game launched, it was a hot mess. There were a ton of bugs, missing functionality, and lots of duping. As a casual, duping didn't really affect me, but I did lose a piece of armor as they fixed things.
---
The big problems have been fixed, and it's now a solid game. 
---
I hear stories of trolls and greifing, but in all my hours of play I've never experienced it. Honestly it feels like most people are playing solo, with a little vending and event multiplayer, and as a casual, I like it. 
---
I'm only just about to launch my first nuke, so I'm still working on the main quest, and the rate of new quests released, matches or is faster than I can complete them, so I'm super satisfied. 
---
I would say this game is better for casual gamers than hardcore. Most of the complaints you hear about today are end game, and min/max related, which don't really matter to me.
---
 I do wish there were human NPCs ( they have robots like Rose, but this is a stupid artifical constraint they have put on themselves) for all intents and purposes, Rose is an NPC. So adding human NPCs would only be a value add.
---
&gt; You might think this would be one case where they could restore items, since there are impossible items sitting in people's inventories...
---
But that's the point -- since they're impossible they can't be restored.
---
Lmao it's okay. You didn't mean to destroy someone's video game door. 
---
Myself and those I play with on the other hand? We've destroyed many dozens of video game homes. Razed them to the ground for absolutely no reason other than the fun of it.
---
We can have them fix it if you really want to.
---
Please give us a challenge where we have to take a picture while naked of another player taking a picture of two bears high-fiving while naked in a nuke zone while under the influence of nukashine please!
---
Lol. "Entilted". Its usually entitled people that say things like this, normal hard working people normally dont think about things that way.
---
Level 142 and I launched my first nuke on fissure prime last Saturday. Helps if you have a good team. The silo is a slog! Also make sure you have plenty of high level players on the server. Maybe pick a time of day when people in your region are free to play and not 4am on a Wednesday.
---
Unflowing atoms can‚Äôt stop flowing since they never flowed.
---
Definitely fluky as after I cycle vats off and on it's back to norm.
---
Afaik the Alien Blaster is sadly not in the legendary lineup :(
---
I'm on ps4 and sometimes places like white springs are really choppy, especially in nuke zones. 
---
Think its an optimisation issue.
---
Thank you ;)
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, I think people are confusing/combining prime weapon receivers (because they use ultracite ammo) and just thinking ultracite lasers behaved the same.
---
So nobody will say where these actually spawn?
---
Yes, I completely agree with you but the fact that they said they would only sell aesthetic items at launch in the atom shop and then a year later start selling repair kits has me thinking they would move in this direction.
---
yeah it literally make it impossible to run away form a yao ming even with marsupial
---
Me first day in Appalachia : NO FEAR :D 
---
First time encountering a wendigo : ONE  FEAR
---
Some people aren‚Äôt into camps as much as other people. I could care less what other people do with their camps.
---
Damage is not shotgun's forte; it's a utility kneecapper weapon, thanks to Enforcer and Skeet Shooter.
---
Yea they really need to redo the perk system, what bothers me the most is we vault dwellers of Vault 76 are chosen due to intelligence and skills Americans the US had hence why we were chosen to rebuild America after nukes drop and we should be able to master everything like in Skyrim or Fallout 4 and with Starched genes once we acquire skill we should be required to build a potion to remove selected mutations.
---
That‚Äôs really the only thing they are good for since the unwarranted nerf.
---
Good opening salvo to cripple a tough solitary mob before swapping to nearly anything better.
---
Yeah. I understand it‚Äôs frustrating. 
---
I used to work in tech support. It‚Äôs probably frustrating for them too. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to cheerlead for them, but it‚Äôs frustrating when you can‚Äôt fix something.
---
Maybe it's not that easy? We've seen how items in inventories impact the servers - I can imagine it would have more impact if they add more to whatever process is handling the items or else it would have happened already
---
I use them is certain situations. I also bought 2 regular ones just in case. They will be needed for the new event tomorrow.
---
Anywhere.   It‚Äôs a current bored griefers tactic to do n
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are so worried about what other people do with their camp.
---
I got a nocturnal faster fire rate one today, they‚Äôre out there.
---
I feel like this is something unit testing or QA should have caught
---
Come on in! The radiation's fine!
---
There's absolutely, without a doubt, a ton more light now during nighttime than there was in the first days of the B.E.T.A. Back then nights were actually somewhat dark. Now it's daytime 24/7.
---
How
---
This. 
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
Does it spoil over time? Would hate to server hop for more after I grab one only to have it go bad on me
---
Only thing I didn't sell back was a 3* combat rifle its anti armour ,explosive,  reload speed.
---
Bethesda support site. You open a case and give them all the details.
---
Ok thanks guys
---
I wouldn't report him for that..and the only thing I use workshops for is fusion cores...tough to find.
---
..ha! I have started saving all candy..gives me 5 months to catch up to you :)
---
I used it for quite a long time, I'm a person who puts ballistic resist over energy resist.
---
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
My gosh man. It's not like I'm actually pissed off. It's just poking fun.
---
thanks. just waiting for insurance to approve surgery.
---
I normal get like 1 cap or stim every 100 or so.
---
You can only hold 150 a day...
---
Nope backpacks disappear if dropped and can't be traded like in real life . . . oh wait that doesn't make sense, like wtf Bethesda let me craft backpacks for new players instead of holding it behind a quest.
---
Clarification: In #2 the screencap shows both the location triangle and the custom destination marker.  The fossils are at the location triangle and NOT the marker.  They were pretty easy to find.
---
Thanks for all the info!
---
Teacher teacher, somebody has been naughty! Favour me!
---
I think I just learned it yesterday, if you need it I can put it on for you for free.
---
I encountered two of the regular mothmen within a few hours of starting the game near Charleston Station, and then a level 42 Vengeful Mothman attacked me out of nowhere in white springs when I was around level 12.
---
I rand into one Mr Handy needing help. All you had to do was fixing him and he would thanks you and go his merry way.
---
You're not supposed to ask how unless you want to exploit it for gain.
---
It‚Äôs horrid.  Basically enticing people to come screw with you AFTER you clear everything on a base you need something from. 
---
I really believe this small Bethesda group supports griefers.
---
I definitely WOULDNT pay to be taught this glitch. NO interest at all. Totally DONT PM me with details...
---
An enemy reached through a wall to hit me the other day. i don't know how this should be possible in any way, but it happened.
---
Luckily for me, I was running away from 4 or 5 Mirelurks and Mirelurk Hunters when the Wendigo triggered and they focused their attention on each other. I just hid in the shadows until they picked each other off.
---
It took me forever to find my way back out of the cave though, and I'm never going back there again!
---
Wtf seriously?
---
I personally wish wine can be fermented to vintage quality if you brew it yourself and grow tarberries so I can become a Wine Maker
---
Demo expert and heavy gunner both stack for an explosive harpoon gun.
---
And in general demo expert boosts any gun with explosive on it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happened to me several times too. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
I had it happen once. Not sure how long it was empty. I didn‚Äôt have an issue placing my camp so it wasn‚Äôt tied to that.
---
They'd be idiotic to do this. People would leave in droves.
---
yeah same, I was getting badges fairly regularly and now it seems they've dried up :(
---
The amount of toilet paper and salt I‚Äôve seen being sold for 25k... it‚Äôs tough being in a no wipe world.
---
I find it strange that you can‚Äôt just go into your user configuration and directly toggle things like:
---
*Accept Team Invites? (Y/N)
---
*Accept Trade Requests? (Y/N)
---
*Accept obvious attempts to goad you into PVP while their partner is stealth mode nearby? (No/Seriously, F that)
---
I do the same thing, mostly because I already have a large pile of legendary items to grind up. Its all well and good to say "scrap this so you don't lose out," but I'm still trying to clear out my backlog due to the weird daily limit.
---
I do.  I run the SBQ and Encryptid often enough to have over 50 of the darn things, and because they have 0.1 WT apiece, and can't be sold or dropped without destroying them, I might as well use them.
---
Oh m fucking god, today i was like "ok fuck it i will do atleast wendigo daily challenge" guess what, i am on 3rd server and there is not fucking vendigo on end of this damn cave!!!
---
Idk know why we dont already have player own factions like clans already. Would be a nice feature.
---
I never accept random invites in any game, it's rude to request a random invite IMO.
---
it would!!
---
I ran into this too but in the end it didnt actually duplicate them. It just looked like it was. For me anyway.
---
I just don't use a headset so it's always awkward when I run into other players. They just kinda stand there and stare and I'm like "do you want something...?"
---
Well good to know they exist
---
In my experience, it's quite a bit below 25%.  I've run enough to eliminate all but the most extreme bad luck (8 or so in ~100 events).
---
Hope this thumbs up dulls the pain, sad part its unlikely Bethesda has a way to fix this for players this. Basing this since they had to run a script to see if a player had x amount of item which would be rare and be unable to have that much like the guy who played 700hrs and got banned for holding tons of ultracite ammo.
---
It's the game and the settings in game.
---
1. Don't run the game at ultra settings they are headed out wrong. Run on High and customize it to your liking.
---
2. The game is in no way optimized for the current gent graphic cards. 5+ year old engine that can play better on an intergrated gfx chip than today's current gent.
---
3. Make sure your gfo4ce experience is turned off and not trying to optimize your windows settings for in while your in game.
---
4. Turn off any sync settings to your monitor. (If used)
---
5. Play in broderless window mode even on one monitor ( helps refresh).
---
6. Up your fan speed on the 2070. Stick speeds are set imo too low. ( Check the Nvidia tweek forums for more info on this).
---
7. General windows - make sure your page file is 4x the size that is recommended ( if your c drive is a 1 tb drive is would be set to 2048mb bad example but a general Google search will give you the info) the game writes to your drive like crazy and the bigger page file will help.
---
8. If ya don't have over 16gb me get some quick. The more mem you have the smother your game is.
---
Just some info for ya
---
And threadripper 1800
---
64gb 3200 ram
---
1.5 tb sad (c drive)
---
2x 4gb 7200 hybrid drives for storage
---
Nvidia 2080 sli x2
---
Well the unique ID numbers won't due much besides saying hey there is 100 of this one gun which there should only be 1. Then whoever's inventory that item is in is a duper. Not too much load increase on server
---
Nothing quite like the satisfying sound of hitting your enemy.. only for it to do no damage :|
---
There are still a few players out there who might need a "little help" like this.  I used to lock my main building up, but I kept my purifiers unlocked and built guest facilities with weapon and armor benches, stash box and even a decent, clean bed all under a roof out away from the main base.  Since the vendor update, I just leave the whole base open to everyone.
---
You just have to build and scrap a whole bunch of power fists.
---
A normal gatling gun can probably 1 shot a 68 super mutant if you've got your character set up properly. So can a normal shotgun... You guys are making things out to be way worse than they are. Shotguns do more damage per shot up close. They've got more utility in staggering and crippling enemies. So they don't have range, they're not supposed to... Just like melee. No ones calling for melee buffs. Shotguns are still strong AF. Are they the OP kings they always were? No, but they're still on par with everything else damage wise.
---
Comparing them to heavy weapons is unfair. Even at the height of the "heavy weapons are useless" propaganda circulating this sub, they were some of the best dps weapons in game. They just felt bad because of the extreme resource costs... Now they're pretty much #1. Either them or commando builds.
---
TL;DR: Every build has a draw back. Pistols have no armor pen, full auto builds have heavy resource demands, shotguns have small range, melee have no range, rifles are heavy af. Don't get me started on explosive based weapons like fatman.
---
Oh m fucking god, today i was like "ok fuck it i will do atleast wendigo daily challenge" guess what, i am on 3rd server and there is not fucking vendigo on end of this damn cave!!! 
---
Bethesda should stop giving us so specific challenges. I wont give them penny, becouse of this marketing.
---
Melee player w/  Incisor 3, martial artist 3, glow sight 3, bloody mess 3, gladiator1.
---
I generally do not bother with the food(s) that increase melee damage, nor have I used bobbleheads or magazines.
---
With that disclaimer, I've found for one or two enemies at a time, the slower/heavier weapons are great.
---
  Once I start seeing hordes, (or mutant with a minigun), I prefer to use a faster weapon.  L84, my current weapon of choice is a 1\* vampire switchblade to which I  added the serrated blade mod.  (It does 3-4 hits in the time it takes a Sledge to make 1.) 
---
Over the weekend, I learned the value of Exterminator prefix against mirelucks and AA (ballistic) against L65 SBs.
---
And I know a lot of people poke fun at it, but the 3\* rolling pin is actually a decent weapon, already modded it to the chef version, and still looking for the bladed mod.
---
How are are your perks setup?  Having the right setup can make a world of difference in how a rifle performs.  
---
Having one each of the rifleman perks, maxed bloody mess, couple in tormentor, and a couple in adrenaline can greatly improve your rifle use.   Bloody mess and Adrenalin are powerful often overlooked perks that help all types of builds.  
---
Here is my rifle / melee build.  
---
I have two points in skeet shooter for my shotgun that I use from time to time.  I drop skeet shooter and tank killer when I need to pick locks.  for hacking I drop nerd rage.
---
I doubt that I don't think many people would like that. It's a big leap from repair kits to paying g for legendarys
---
Seriously?!?! Dude I have way more cores than I know what to do with. I have fully charged and 120% charged ones for sale in my vendor for like 20-25 caps.
---
THe reason people don‚Äôt play survival isn‚Äôt because they aren‚Äôt  good, it‚Äôs because survival isn‚Äôt worth it, people do pvp for caps and fun, in survival mode you get 14 caps a kill and people just sit invisible so they don‚Äôt appear on the map when they are #1. Survival mode isn‚Äôt survival is adventure with fast travel limitations. Also the reason that he took the workshop was for pvp he didn‚Äôt need it.
---
I built a bar for the brewing kit, my main house is an open garage with sleeping quarters above and the vending is just alongside the bar. Buy some things, grab a beer and relax, fix your kit and have a snooze. Just thought it would be fun. 
---
My camp hasn't been locked down in months except my generator house because enemies.
---
Wah wah I'm going to Reddit...
---
Not exactly, those are both just known for taking up a lot of thirst
---
It wouldn't need an avatar. You get to the final room to destroy/reprogram/shut down the ZAX unit, and all of it's automated defenses, and security bots come online to stop you. Might have to get cards and simultaneously have 2-3 people turn the emergency failsafes on, which would override the ZAX unit. 
---
Plus, ZAX units are really AI as much as just great computers. I think only one ZAX ever moved to the AI level, and that was President Eden.
---
Actually came in handy in the middle of a white springs run when my pa leg broke.
---
Very nice my freind.
---
Happens to me all the time with my railway rifle, have to cycle VATS on and off
---
Found a random shacks that has a few bathtub with Carrots and Corn planted in them. I would love to have something like that in the camp.
---
That guy who posted weeks ago was right! The food builds are taking over!
---
I‚Äôm game. I also need help with that last part. Psn: unikron08
---
The repair kit decision did suck, but they are probably rarely bought anyways. And if we want to be technical I bet some intern at Bethesda said "This repair kit is cosmetic, not pay to win. If your weapon is broke then you can't look at it so this is a cosmetic. It only affects looks."
---
I don't see this as a consistency issue. It's a bandana, not an official Army/government product so people might cling to the gilded memories of a "better" era.
---
The responders are more an issue because, while not themselves an "official" body, it's likely that they simply picked up existing official clothing, and changing the flag from the 50 to 13 stars would be a waste of energy, esecially to track down those flage and sew them on the outfits, for what reason?
---
No it‚Äôs just one of the rarer effects.
---
If by second shot you mean two shot, then your problem might be using VATS? Two shot weapons are super inaccurate in VATS and you can miss out on the damage from the 2nd projectile. 
---
It could also be a range issue? Depending on the range stat for each gun. If one is significantly lower, then you‚Äôre probably experiencing damage drop off on targets further away. 
---
Statistically your level 40 two shot .50 with a perforating mag should do more damage, with the bonus armor penetration from the perf mag.
---
There is a shack in the Savage Divide that has something like that already so someone thought of it already.
---
Only annoying thing is the "corrections" to the bar name. It is Ad Hictoriam as a drunken play on the actual phrase. Even BoS like to get a bit merry and mellow with a beer or few. üòÇ
---
Haggis is illegal in the states.
---
I really love my shotguns and I initially set up my build to be a shotgunner - then I got to the Enclave and got laughed at by a cargobot. Couldn't bring it down and I didn't know anyone in the game at the time to help me so I had to start over as a Rifle/Melee build. I've always been really partial to Melee + Shotgun but since the majority of the shotgun perks are in strength I have to sit it out since I need those for my melee :c
---
Oh ,you can drop em ? Didn't know that . Yeah ,better to use em
---
I‚Äôm hoping the 10% vendor tax is going to the development of individual plans for these.  Your tax dollars at work!
---
They wanna talk shit to civilians all day until they're offered a drink.
---
I came to say just this. My camp is currently in the mire and it‚Äòs pitch black in most places at night, except for the glowing mushrooms.
---
How do you repair someone else's camp? I've walked by a few with busted defenses and beyond checking the perimeter for threats I didn't think I could do anything else.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to post :)
---
Cool, hey I'd be interested too. I play on ps4 so let me know when you've started
---
It‚Äôs cool man, your joking. I have seen multiple people say they didn‚Äôt  buy anything out of their vending machine because they didn‚Äôt like the way they made their camp. That‚Äôs just crazy.
---
Have you picked up the password from the top floor in Fort Defiance? It's on a paper in the room across from where the PA stations are.
---
Did you read the same post that I read? 
---
No ones talking about nerfs. They‚Äôre saying the gun doesn‚Äôt always hit the target even when it should. How would fixing that be a nerf
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm not sure when I will start. It‚Äôs just a lot of work but I am definitely untested
---
Shotgun is stronger than pistol atm, just feels bad because you gotta be in close range. At that point you might as well be running a melee build.
---
Camp Adams? I never heard of that location.
---
Some people exploit team invites, too. Some random player invites you to the team, someone else flags the group for PVP (when one person of a group if flagged for PVP other members are), they kill you, take your junk, kick you from the team after.
---
This is why flagging the entire party for PVP is a really, really bad idea. It's griefer bait for people who randomly accept invites.
---
They could just make Planters as a all in one item. One for each crop. Would solve any placement issues, you would just have to be able to put down the planter in the location you want.
---
I‚Äôd really appreciate an option to auto-reject (or preferably never receive) team invites. Would save me the vague guilt of not responding.
---
It does work both ways, but it‚Äôs very fiddly to pull off. Super mutants and Gutsys seem to work best for me. If you get right up on a wall, when an enemy on the other side is close enough, there‚Äôs a slight distortion in the wall texture at their location. You can‚Äôt VATS it, but a melee swing has a so so chance of connecting.
---
interested *
---
I'd be interesting to see data behind all the kvetching here when they were announced.  Vitriol was all you could see.  Now there's not much.  I wonder how many people quit and left vs. how many people accepted it and kept playing.
---
Anyway, I have a few from SBQ runs.  I've used them in a pinch a couple of times.  They're fine I guess.  Not as good as Weapon Artisan, but more handy if you don't feel like leaving a nuke zone to repair a weapon in the midst of a battle.
---
Do the 2 daily repeatable quests and pop Campfire Tales anytime its night on your server.
---
Clips though the field scribe outfit as well
---
Sure I can see that. I guess if it‚Äôs not a very common bug then it won‚Äôt be high on the priority list. I appreciate they must be swamped with tickets and trying to fix actual problems.
---
I‚Äôm normally such a cheerleader for this game, breezily brushing off the bugs and glitches and being positive on reddit and Instagram. I guess I‚Äôm just a tad annoyed but it will pass and I‚Äôll be making light of it in a week or two. I just want to see what new items have been added!!
---
I would love the addition of planters as well as the ability to plant some more of the wild plants like the Firecracker Berries and the Silt Beans! I really like how Firecracker berries look and want to decorate my camp with them.
---
I don't care what other people will write down. Don't give them any attention and they eventually give up and leave. Articles do not control the gaming community.
---
 "They would be idiotic to not do this thing that people like me, the very author of this post, would lose their shit over if they did in fact do." We should all think before we hit that submit post button, you guys.
---
How would you know? I've got bloody hundreds of those anyway lol
---
Oh, I never turn down a good deal.
---
See I never knew it was good for ballistic. I‚Äôve never looked into it really. I care about that more than energy resist as well.
---
The spit is either acid or poison, I don't remember which....and they can spit quite a long distance.

I haven't run across one of them recently, and I must admit, I don't miss them at all.
---
I checked that spot and i still never find a tamable. Some events yes,but the majority of times there's nothing. I think thw servers cannot keep up with these events anymore...they don't even load.
---
If they won't be mature about why give them attention anyways? Don't feed the trolls.
---
I sell cigarettes and cigars.  The undamaged ones from the enclave?  Woo boy you‚Äôre gonna pay out the nose for these!
---
There‚Äôs and old sci fi film called Millennium where, as I recall, people smoke because it‚Äôs better than breathing the air.  I imagine thats what life is like in the Toxic Valley.
---
Ive done stings and things 4 times and gotten the mouted rad roach every damn time lol.
---
Welcome to the *Circus of Vaaaaalues*!
---
I haven‚Äôt seen that effect.
---
1. I had a shotgunner. I used to swap to melee to farm shells, then realized it was faster w/o melee perks sometimes to clear the same areas as with my shotgun, so kinda abandoned them. Since then I've picked up heavy weapon cards and have mostly been playing w/ some heavy weapons on that character.
---
2. I do keep at least one "control" weapon on every character for SBQ and Fakesquatch. Enforcer + limb damage shot gun, cryo, something. 
---
3. I never had a TSE
---
4. If I get some decent fun pulls from the Purv, I may shift back.
---
Aw so nice!  My own revive another player experience wasn't nearly as cinematic.  I saved the boss fight from the Lyin' Lowe quest until last night, finally completed it and got both revive another player and revive another player in water from that.  We also successfully defeated the boss, so there's that!  Got my backpack and am finally unencumbered.  I've been playing for so long with maxed inventory I forgot what it was like to sprint...
---
I can‚Äôt find the post but someone datamined the %, but rng is rng.  Sorry to hear about your luck!  Me and my gf grinded then out together which helped for server hopping, just join the one who gets it.  She always got 2-3 to my 1 badge too!
---
I'm west coast so tend to be on a little later, but I like doing survival and pvp. Could definitely use a teammate.. gt cl88t
---
Fixing that wouldnt but as soon as they look into a weapon they will be like "wait a minute, this thing does decent damage and you could make a pretty good PvP build with it..... NERF!".
---
Once you complete the enclave mission for officer you are good to go.
---
First nuke launch for me was 55 and in no way was my build weapons even close to optimal. Still got it done in a group.
---
Fist solo sbq launch lv 75 took about 1.5 hours to complete still no where clost to optimized. Killed sbq again
---
Numerous sbq fights not launched by me. Lvl 75-100. Optimized hvy wpns build at this point.
---
2nd solo launch sbq lvl 103 time 45 min. Sbq down again.
---
It takes practice and some planning but it's doable @50.
---
Currently @ 170 and have 3 builds Melee/hvy/shotguns. Solo launches @ 30-40 mins each. Sbq kills so far 45/50.
---
If on PC I'll help anyone that want to try and nuke the queen. The group I run with loves queen fights. And will help as needed.
---
IGN is the same as here.
---
General info this last weekend 25 launches 25 kills.
---
The enclave will be taking that
---
That is an excellent one, hold on to that one!
---
Try survival mode
---
Pc player?  First i heard of that
---
Sadly this weekend my enjoyement was ruined by two a*holes using tactic that i didnt know of
---
While i was looking junk  i got spammed by teaminvites by random player .
---
I choose to ignore it  some time later a low lvl sendt an invite.
---
Thinking he want ft to where i am  i accepted the invite to help what happend next i still dont understand .
---
As i finish my junk run i went back to my camp.
---
Once there i see both players standing in my base while thinking nothing of it  i went to crafting new ammo.
---
When suddenly i see the messahe that my team got killed .
---
So i step outside to see what is going on.
---
Player 1 who teaminvite spammed me suddenly killed me when i didnt aggress him or attack him it cost me 50 caps...
---
And my base which he completely  destroyed
---
Fun tactics...
---
Improved one - bethesda did well, good reward for endgame bosses. They are still not worth grinding, because how much they do cost to kill =/= 3* legendary. But it is step good way.
---
Those in atom shop - fuck off.
---
A tiny shack with a loft bedroom is totally possible, even with the large foot print of the stairs. Just gotta tuck things under other things. üòä
---
I play solo 90% of the time, I still have fun.  I enjoy the base building (though I could use more base capacity...), doing quests and what have you.  I haven't had any problems with assholes since launch.  I think the only reason *not* to play is if the premise of the game (post-apocalypse with some silliness, base building) doesn't appeal to you.
---
have not seen, have not bought, have no need.
---
Or if you weren't looking for a teammate and just wanted to pvp lol
---
PC.
---
I like wood armor, please give me the right leg so I can finish my set!
---
I used one for this because I was in the middle of the bog, miles from anywhere and now over encumbered.
---
I now have the urge to paint my power armor obnoxious colors and blast Devil May Cry battle music through area chat.
---
Also now formally requesting garish power armor paint schemes.
---
I said I'm not looking for sweaty people who are going to report me for "cheating" because they cant win. Just wanna chill in a party with some people and Duke it out a bit
---
It says it in the replies I got from people.
---
The badges won't appear in the item list - it appears quickly in place of the event XP bar if you get a badge for the event.  Very easy to miss - always check the vending machine to be sure.  Sometimes the Collections tab in the Pip-Boy bugs out so the only way to be sure is to checking the vending machine.  Camp Adams has both vending machines.
---
im struggling!! i wanted to go 2x1 floor space so it‚Äôs easy to put down wherever. that‚Äôs the problem cus to have stairs i need to be at least 3x1 but then it looks stupid long so i need to go 2x2 then it‚Äôs bigger than i wanted lmaoo
---
I'll hit you up.
---
Nice.
---
&gt; I'm not the type of person that asks for things in return, but give me something in return.
---
Lol. 
---
Well we know Bethesda had the idea for player vending since at least June 2018 because they talked about it in the Noclip documentary. That puts it at a minimum of six months before you made your post.
---
So I'm gonna go with no, your idea did not spark the addition.
---
Explosive railway rifle is a lot of fun.  I had a one-star version and it was great at headshots, but it ended up being too slow to use for day-to-day adventuring.  Fewer reloads would definitely help with that.
---
People who said they'd leave: half the sub
---
Peoole who left: 0
---
If you're not familiar with the engine the game runs on (sounds like you're not)... items have unique id numbers. The dupe bugs create items with new, exciting id numbers. It's not an exact copy, it's a new entity with the same stats but not 100% identical values.
---
Anyone with an ounce of progranning exoerience can think of the "unique id's" solution, in this case it's an example of the problems associated with tracking duped items. If it were so easy any idiot could find a fix it'd be fixed by now.
---
Thanks for the offer, I‚Äôm going to build a few more tonight &amp; hope. If I don‚Äôt have any joy I‚Äôll give you a shout if that‚Äôs cool?
---
Their canned responses are lol worthy, they don't even look at their tickets.
---
sharing my story...whats your issue?
---
Nooo! Dont let Nerfthesda know about it!!!
---
I mean maybe... but they already fixed the issue of it not being boosted by perk cards so it‚Äôs not like they haven‚Äôt looked at the gun already. 
---
Plus a full Auto railway rifle has insane recoil so you basically have to use VATS. That somewhat balances the high DPS that it can pump out. More-so if it‚Äôs naturally less accurate in VATS than other weapons
---
no no no, It might be something about my monitor (lg oled TV) but I literally could not see a single thing at night, and was using my light even during the day. It's good just the way it is. maybe try turning down your monitors brightness? I almost quit playing it was so bad. making brightness an in game slider would be fine.
---
that bug also kicks in if you are killed and respawn.
---
If you are like me and bumping your weight limit, then that crawl back to your loot bag can be excrutiating.
---
Are you on right now?
---
Still sticking with "try survival mode" cause from multiple past experiences, even if someone says they won't get salty, they end up getting salty. It's pretty lame
---
Thats why I didn't explain it in the description.
---
After making a three story house, I agree the stairs do need a fix
---
Yeah in theory it sounds simple and easy, but I'm sure such a solution was looked at when dupers were wreaking havoc shortly after the game launched. It's hopeful, but we don't know the limitations or issues with the engine and making such a change from the outside looking in
---
I'll add u later..thx
---
I thought heavy gunner doesn‚Äôt apply to explosive weapons.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Gunner
---
‚ÄúYour non-explosive heavy guns now do X% more damage‚Äù
---
I suppose. I just worry that Bethesda is going to take my baby away.
---
There's a bit of randomness to Gutsys in whether or not they come at you with the devastating ballistic gun or the laser.  Individually, and with enough distance, they aren't bad.  In groups though, like in AWOL Armaments, everything can go south really quickly.
---
Look me up and I'll show you a group ofnlikenmided plaers that love to have fun,bargan and kill the queen. And help each other out. Iur vendors are stocked full of stuff. Some general some not so.
---
12k for sentinals weightless reduced something trapper armor.
---
TS, explosive,anti armor, bloody, beserkers, and a few junkies can be found and porcured at our fine stores.
---
I'd be surprised if the datamined % was accurate, given that my sample size is big enough to smooth over most bumps, but there's always that one guy who bucks the trends.
---
Or, maybe there's another level to the equation (level, damage to the 'boss', cloud cover, last Mothman sighting, who knows?)
---
Bethesda logic: a 5mm round from an antique gatling gun does X damage while a 5mm round from from a precision minigun does less than half that damage.
---
How does the same bullet become so ineffective between guns? The gatling gun is incredibly ammo efficient for the amount of damage it does while the minigun burns through ammo while doing piss poor relatively piss poor damage by comparison. Miniguns just seem incredibly underwhelming compared to other heavy weapons.
---
It's too bad the skull mask looks really cheesy imo :c
---
I can see that but people tell me that they've reported me way to often in survival just because they come looking for me (#1,2,or,3) and get their asses handed to them.
---
I feel Shotguns are too weak now, heavy weapons are too strong.  I fee rifles are in that sweet spot.  I feel rifles should be the baseline and a big B should try and balance to them.  Again this is all opinion base because everyone can come here and say X Y and Z.  My 2 cents is, if I can one shot and or cripple and enemy across the screen with a heavy gunner Gatling Gun and One Gun Army. Why the hell would I use a shotgunner and do the same thing but require me to be within 10 yards?
---
Cool story bro.
---
Since stuff keeps well, I've found that I have a lot more cooked stuff to sell for daily caps.  I swap in GWS3 in place of One Gun Army when I'm not in PA, have 11 luck so I can keep all the mutation perks and Bloody Mess on at all times.
---
Not a gimmick per se, but it is eating up a ton of my stash space to pull it off.  I've been grinding Biv's daily to unlock every single drink recipe and sell \~5 of each of them in my machine.  My CAMP is also themed to look like a bar:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/oZsXD6Y](https://imgur.com/a/oZsXD6Y)
---
Still figuring out pricing, most drinks are meh but some are desirable.  I need to get a good route going to farm ants to make Rad Ant Lager, by far and away those sell the most.
---
That's why you get the leather coat to match it.
---
I'm not sure about your chest piece, but my heavy bos is closer to 86 I think...
---
Yep. Will stay on for 2-3 hours .
---
Yah the attack is now just in my inventory now haha
---
You might be on to something, she always minds the fire with kindle and gathers missing camper items.  I was basically bumming around getting free insect meat and tagging the legendary mobs.
---
25%
---
That's a fun idea, haha.
---
She's not hard she's just a bullet spungr
---
I think he means he picked one up. That might be wrong, but I somehow got one as loot.
---
They are supposedly going to try and have this fixed in tomorrows patch. There was another post where they responded to this issue.
---
Maybe it's platform related? For my brother and I (PC) it's always been: we spawn somewhere semi-random (seemingly based on the current CAMP device location, with a little fuzz), everyone else spawns loosely where the CAMP device was originally placed.
---
He made some joke about my dead parents
---
A little while back they changed how PvP works by introducing survival mode. Essentially Adventure mode is PvE mode and Survival mode is PvP mode. If you don't fight back it's not possible for somebody to kill you in Adventure mode. You can turn on pacifist mode to ensure you can't hurt other players. Regarding nukes, it's very rare for somebody to target a location that isn't the bottom right of the map or whatever the current best grinding location is.
---
Regarding CAMPs, you can see what you'll be able to build here.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements)
---
Awesome. I'll be on in a few minutes.
---
Yes and thank you!
---
This is such an astoundingly dumb thing to downvote.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Can confirm. I farmed every magazine and this one doesn't exists.
---
Everyone else xan confirm too.
---
You're pretty spot on with where the extra checks need to be. It's probably a simpke fix but due to bethesda's desire for the gameplay to be the same across all platforms, us PC players are basically just stuck waiting on microsoft and sony's update verification process for it to deploy.
---
I haven‚Äôt bought any, nor will I, but I‚Äôve used the free ones a few times. They come in handy in certain situations.
---
Yea I find night vision scopes useless.
---
That's ridiculous. They can report you all they want, but nothing will ever happen if you're not cheating. If someone tells you they're reporting you for "cheating" just because you were better equipped, ignore and block. You won't get in trouble unless you're actually cheating. They're just being salty lil babies haha
---
This is even better than the fix option, since it doesn't require any item. It consumes more time though.
---
So, sneak builds and Tesla guns?
---
You‚Äôre essentially eliminating all the variety of combat.
---
Fuck you Behesda devs and wood armor! I DO ALL THIS GRINDING TO GET ITEMS FOR SCRIPT, TURN IT IN TO GET THREE 3* wood armor. OK no prob I'll just rescript next day,log in and this shit has reverted to 1*????? How about you morons test shit be for you screw over the the entire fallout community that is still supporting this train wreck of a game. Oh btw you a-holes owe me about 900 script for all the wood armor that I have received from purveyor across my characters.
---
For strait meta bloody with SS if the go to. Me I use an
---
Instigating SS ski sword with the blade mod. 145dmg adn swings super fast love one shotting gouls with it.
---
U also carry around a furoius ss reduced weight fire axe for fun
---
That's awesome! 
---
So many cool ideas and not enough camp budget. I had to sacrifice a bunch of craps, the power armor station (which I never used anyways) and I think one cat hedge. Along with the bathroom and two guest cabins, so I could build my vendor station. :(
---
Collect underpants 
---
Take picture of a Yao guai, a Flatwoods monster, and a radroach at a tea party during a radstorm, wearing collected underpants 
---
Profit
---
10 caps
---
I'm just worried that a certain volume of reports can get you auto banned.
---
Also, I'd love to see a few perks move around. Some of shotgun into Endurance maybe and possibly Bear Arms as well.
---
I got them all but 2,4,5
---
Ha no even worse lol it was before the patch so he was loading and procesing buffering and than gave me the paper. I felt SO insulted he wouldnt say it to my face.
---
Very possible. I'm skeptical as well.
---
Lag I assume
---
I see a lot of people check it when I'm there. Even tho no one's buying anything from it, I do hope they at least think it's funny.
---
I try and sell the BOS outfits and some other rarer outfits. Clean Space Suit sold quickly for 1500 Caps and a few "Rare" ones like the Tattered Mole outfit and head go quickly.
---
I don't send them but I like to accept the random invites and go to their camp and put down toilets in strange places
---
RIP Injured Super Mutant and his Comrades.
---
All i want is a wasteland barcade. Im with ya.
---
I accidentally gave away my Vampire's one :(
---
In the market for a new one :-)
---
That's awesome. I love how creative people are getting with their vendors.
---
I think people downvote it because its dumb to be mad over something like that
---
Oh wow. I had no idea some of these could fetch that much.
---
He's one of my favorites.
---
I guess I've never noticed.  The only weird thing I've noticed in third-person and aiming is when I reload the Tesla Rifle, my character tilts down and snaps back up.
---
That, and emotions *still* screws up the orientation of locations on your radar.
---
That... that would be perfect
---
There's also a cryptid daily quest in the Mire that puts you against a random cryptid at the end, and it has a chance of being a mothman.
---
That's not even that rare. Damn i guess i need to move my camp to somewhere with more foot traffic.
---
No, you can't, because patches and hotfixes have to deploy across all platforms at once and Sony especially has an obnoxiously long update verification process.
---
I go through like 10 a session
---
Nobody needs stairs with marsupial mutations
---
I have teddy bears and the Mr. Fuzzy plushes listed in that shop for like 15000+ caps, so I don't accidentally scrap them while crafting, haha.
---
I should start putting some basic teddy bears in the free vendor.
---
They don't control the community but they do control investors. 
---
Even if the two of us won't be hurt by such bs articles Bethesda can be harmed. Investors don't want to be associated with such articles even if they're fake. (also the reason for the youtube adpocalypse). If Bethesda is harmed they will think twice when they'll make a game, they'll think twice if it's okay to add some items in one of their online games...
---
lots of 
---
It's not about what we want, sadly it's always about what the people with lots of money want. 
---
I understand that you would support the game is such outfits were added, but it's such a gray area... Besides, the bread and butter of fallout is the fact that the game is set in this dystopia parallel universe, let's treasure fallout for being fallout. WW2 isn't part of fallout's identity.
---
What platform you play on? If it happens to be Xbox i can give you some ammo and maybe a weapon
---
I like this idea, another use for the intestines you pick up
---
Also head cheese consisting of sheepsqautch skull, mutton and Brahmin milk
---
More raider themes too!
---
I'm running a "support build" with a focus on crafting and consumables so I'm right here with you on cooking.
---
Some observations:
---
Don't underestimate how much wood and boiled water you need. Wood Chuck for wood collection runs is awesome.
---
Instead of getting water from a pump to turn into boiled water, find a body of water and spam "collect'. You can get like 200+ in a minute or two.
---
Many people run with melee builds and so one of the more popular food items is Irradiated meat steak, and the good news is that a billion end game creatures drop Irradiated meat!
---
Always check kitchens and cooking areas for recipes. They are everywhere.
---
As far as end game best cooking, basically if it's big and terrible then it cooks well. The best recipe I have is mixed meat scorchbeast which is nuts to make but had insane buffs.
---
COLLECT AND SAVE ANY AND ALL SALT, PEPPER, HONEY, CREAM, AND SPICES YOU FIND. Store these in your stash- they never go bad and many high end recipes need one or more of these.
---
Player vending opens up new frontiers for filling out your cook book, take advantage of it.
---
If food is about to spoil sell it to vendors! Don't let it go to waste!
---
Prime plans work a bit weirdly. It seems like the game will never drop you a plan you've already learned. Meaning once you kill more scorchbeasts/scorchbeast queens they will keep giving you new prime receiver plans until you know them all
---
Fo4 had a true dark night mod. It was absolutely hard as shit and is not for the faint of heart.
---
Except you can make a certain amount of each weapon. Like numerous games have done. Then when that limit is reached guess what no more weapons can drop, it is a fixed number, which limits the number of each item in game.
---
Yea how come my lvl 50 three stars from the vendor are waaayyy lower protection then my non-lengendaries? I started getting lvl 2 Because they had better stats
---
I sell "Housewares" that are all undamaged/pristine/Preserved stuff, and I have sold a fair bit of it, but it's all harder to get stuff and the prices are not unreasonable.
---
Its awesome!, too bad bug that allowed him to create it like that was patched a month ago.
---
i need stairs to build an upper floor though cus of how the build rules work in this game. 
---
i did try to build an upper floor and stack some boxes to climb up but it wouldn‚Äôt let me place the floor without attaching to stairs
---
If you are gonna be gullible in an 18+ game, you should play under adult supervision, just saying.
---
Molotovs.
---
Yeah, that's what I figured. I'm toying with the prices a bit to try and hit that sweet spot between "too expensive for lolz" and "expensive enough for RP lolz but still worth spending caps".
---
Basically it's targeted at folks near max caps if they want a gimmicky way to get rid of some.
---
I have the mutation and good doggy.  Canned dog food works the same before and after the mutation
---
Yes! Especially if you use the Cannibal perk with it. Meat is bountiful and Glowing meat is great for a small melee boost. You can still eat dogfood as well.
---
Awhile ago when you viewed it there was a little description as if it was legendary that said ‚ÄúBonus 10% to Scorched‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt pop up anymore but I give you my word it was. Dunno if it was removed or what.
---
I think if someone is dumb enough to pay real money for something like that they should probably learn from experience
---
Used exploit that allows players to place foundations anywhere and then used exploit that allowed you to leave a section of base floating with floors and walls but the foundation exploit was patched already :(.
---
I have used that combo, the damage is all over the board from what I can tell.  Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt do any damage.  Its probably a glitched combo as i‚Äôve read others complain about it.
---
Nah dude. At the most Bethesda and/or Xbox/PS4 would look into it, and then it would just get ignored and tossed out cause they would find that you didn't cheat. I play on xbox, and xbox's enforcement thing shows you somewhere when people report you. Back before all these God tier weapons and armor became the *thing* I was damn good at PVP, and had a lot of people report me for "cheating" on xbox and, allegedly, on Bethesda's website. And nothing happened. You won't get a ban unless they find that you cheated/used some type of exploit on purpose. Also, the people who claim to report you, might not be reporting you. They're probably just mad and trying to scare you cause they got their ass kicked
---
But its not combat.. Its who has spent the most time in game automatically wins. I thought pvp would include ppl under 200 hrs. Just lose all the shit and make damage much much higher. Then everyone can play.
---
I've tried many hundreds of times in previous games. Nowadays, in 76, I just try once whenever I encounter a machine. So far I've gotten 2. The second time I almost didn't look at the machine before leaving the room‚Äîit just caught my eye that it was missing from the machine, and I was like, "What? It disappeared, must be another bug. No wait‚Äî!" Now my pie has a friend.
---
It is, renamed it to Choo Choo Book Boom
---
As much as I'd like to agree with everything you said, I find that I consistently *fast travel* to the exact same spot in my camp. It's on the edge of my camp circle, I believe due North of center (where the camp computer was placed originally).
---
Now, if I log out at my camp, I will initially spawn in the same place as visitors do (95% sure, I haven't actually witnessed a spawn in, but they're far enough apart that I think I'd have noticed).  As you said, that's camp center, where the comp computer was initially placed.
---
These are absolutely consistent in my experience.  I haven't tried moving my camp computer yet to experiment, especially since I'm happy with the way things are at the moment.
---
I put a bunch of soap in the free vendor for stanky lowbies.
---
I am planning to add soap, toilet paper, and comfy pillows to the Fancy vendor, once I free up some space (or when junk decorating goes live and I don't need to use that vendor for super-overprized plush toys I don't want to accidentally scrap).
---
Can it honestly get any worse?  Ill take whatever at this point honestly.
---
It definitely helps quite a bit, especially with 40 spikes per clip
---
You can still eat everything and gain food buffs. You just wont fill hunger. If you're a plant farmer, get herb. If you hord nuked meats and such, get carn. 
---
Carn and herb pretty much have no real downsides.
---
I always putney items at half of the recommended price.
---
But there are exceptions. Such as a one star legendary that has a two shot, furious etc I'll put the price slightly above half price
---
You can attach a staircase to the outside of the building to build an upper floor.
---
OH NOO!!!!
---
I use the guarantee from pvp (instigating) and took off the mirv. The mirv is cool looking though, it does cover a wider area. Guess if there was more instances of mobs piled together but the damage is reduced so much. I'm pretty sure it does the base damage across the area mirv covers x 2.
---
Late reply (computer had a mobo accident...gawd darnit) but along the fences in Whitesprings. I'm near where there are robots pretty much and logging in or fast traveling usually makes mongrels appear typically with one that has a legendary. Got another 2-shot legendary that was a fatman and was pretty sick to use on the Scorch Queen with several perks and magazines.
---
Now sell it in your vending machine for 20k like everyone else.
---
Have you tried in-game pie? Better for your diet.
---
I don't see why it shouldn't tbh. You spend AP jumping, and went out of your way to get the mutation. It should at least do what it physically allows you to do
---
Where they in power armor?
---
Dog food doesn't count as meat as herbivore can still benefit from eat. I'd say either food mutation is good but I prefer herbivore as you can just pick plants anywhere if you get low. Ionized meat is great for carnivore as it doesn't spoil.
---
That‚Äôs actually one of the main problems I have with the series. It‚Äôs been 200 years, why can‚Äôt people figure out how to cut wood properly or make steel beams or plan anything before they build?
---
No reason. It‚Äôs not rocket science for any of this stuff.
---
If I was building my house in the wastes I‚Äôd spend the time to make proper materials and draft proper plans.
---
When you go into components to scrap you can go past the second-to-last component (Ultracite?) and it'll highlight wood although it won't show it. Does the same for me, and works on ps4 at least. Other than that, you can find a Camp item that uses wood and press the Tag/untag button that way. If it won't let you, try dumping all your wood first
---
enjoy snowflake
---
During BETA it was pitch black (for me at least). Yesterday I happened to find the exact spot past the dam where I crouched behind a rock waiting out the night because it was so dark I couldn't find the road and I was too paranoid to turn the pipboy light on in case other players found me and killed me!
---
I found turrets pretty useless and just gave up with the space they take up.
---
Yeah, it really sucks how limited the build budget is. I'm always finding myself almost feeling like I'm done making something really great, and run out of room. And then they constantly add new things and I'm like AAAAAAAHHHHHHH deleting stuff I love to add new stuff. :(
---
Haha i have trust issues from playing ark for 2 years lol.. 
---

---
yep pretty much
---
Yea plz i just love to fix player bases i know im playing as a raider and all but i will do some good if it gets noted plus you cant robb a corpse
---
Hi all,
---
Citing my good friend, u/Valseek over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/boy3e8/please_let_us_know_you_are_aware_of_the_melee_bug/): 
---
&gt;Wanted to confirm that we're investigating several issues related to melee attacks, including:  
---
&gt;\- Initial Melee attacks against an enemy not registering.  
---
&gt;\- Being unable to use VATS to perform melee attacks on flying enemies.  
---
&gt;\- Inconsistent VATS chance to hit when trying to perform melee attacks.  
---
&gt;I don't have a date to share on when fixes for this issues are coming but we are looking into addressing them with future updates. I'll be sure to let you know as soon as I have more info!
---
Make fun all you want, but Bethesda didn't do any of that with F76. So what does that say about them?
---
You have contracted clumsyness (action points regenerate slower)
---
Psa to the same people who need the do not drink labels on bleach I guess.
---
I love you
---
I think I'll be able to live with it.
---
Yep and/or mobs can destroy them in 4 seconds and take 3 minutes to kill a mole rat. I stopped building them.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
There is also a current bug where you cannot build anything under the stairs. if you have anything built under your stairs currently do not move it as you will not be able to place anything back under it currently.
---
I've noticed a lot of performance issues with lighting. In Fallout 76 they replaced the lighting system, and if the file names are anything to go by they are using Enlighten, which is global illumination middleware. Certain locations will causes the frame rate to drop heavily at particular times of the day. Even setting lighting to low it doesn't seem to have much or any effect on performance.
---
Yes you do.
---
i have 4 and collect 20 all the time! speed demon make you thirsty af
---
I stand by my claim that 76 is a test vault. That was 76's experiment - chaos. Testing to see how people survived, adapted, and overcame outside the vault. How people reacted to incredibly harsh environments and how long they managed to survive once kicked out into a potentially harsh landscape. The overseer clearly wasn't capable of rallying a vault for survival, and went along with the concept that everybody was free to make their own choices. She never had one iota of what to do.
---
Vault 76 opened early, far earlier than it should have. In fact, they even planned shutting off the air vents to force every last dweller out... or let them die a slow death from gradual asphyxiation. 
---
Once out of the vault, there was absolutely no plan on what to do. Rebuild Appalachia, they claimed. It's Reclamation Day! They threw you outside the vault with a gun, no real survival tools, and a CAMP. You didn't have a choice. It was exit or die. In the entire time they were in the vault, there was never a plan, never a concept of how to rebuild, what to do, how to do it. Nobody sat down and said "Hey, once we're out, we're all going to meet at Flatwoods, hook up with survivors, and figure out a strategy."
---
Nope. Just get out, and godspeed.
---
Vault 76, the vault without a plan.
---
I assume its something to do with the way camps load in or that we would be able to place purifiers on them or something but that said FIX THE BUG...... heh
---
were the odds adjusted? *or are you the chosen one?*
---
Aronholt farm, north west of the fair grounds. Even has cranberries, honey, and pumpkins.
---
Of course you can scrap in pa, just punch everything into fine dust
---
I bought the shovel one, didn't like it. The tadpole skin is still the best imo. But I can check for you.
---
again i considered this and i‚Äôm really not trying to be difficult but i wanted the stairs inside üòÇüòÇ i have a specific dream okay? but thank you
---
It's from Fallout 3.
---
Why? Don‚Äôt they have a guaranteed spawn location?
---
i put mine on my deck behind my house over the water
---
the door leading to my deck is on the opposite wall of my front door so it easy to find
---
I am on Xbox. I heard of that tactic and they used the low level to engage you. Its common trick were they will get a low level character on to your team and engage with them, causing you to be flagged as well.
---
Perhaps try crit build with mini gun.... and maybe the furious effect.
---
Aaah someone that likes to dine expensive with flux just like me
---
i think it's lag
---
I'm keeping my prefix-less salvaged assaultron head for my glitch museum for when we get display cases. I've already got a scoped tesla rifle, invisible combat knife, serrated bowie knife, snallygaster spit attack explosion, a handmade with standard paint instead of standard color, a spare commendation the game never took away from me after the enclave quest, a marine combat helmet, and now a legendary assaultron head with no prefix. I'm curious what new wonders I will find before we get display cases!
---
My camp is locked for the look of the automatic door to keep them closed since people won‚Äôt shut them. I do plan to write the code over the keypad so people can go in (but still don‚Äôt have the plans for the alphabet/numeral plates).  But my camp is big enough that if you fast travel to it you‚Äôll spawn inside where the workstations are. Upstairs is a bedroom , a play area, a therapist office (who doesn‚Äôt need one after the bombs). There‚Äôs also an access to the patio where you can lounge on chairs and drink.  Don‚Äôt want to come inside? I got you covered with a tent and sleeping bags outside. The vending machines are underneath the patio to keep them dry.
---
Ok? So it would be whoever grinded for the Tesla Rifle first!
---
NOTHING CHANGES. The meta has not changed, and now lower level players are just going to get melted. Who would play this?
---
When exactly does it sound good? It's a horrible mess of 4 cellphones playing different ring tones at the same time.
---
Compare to playing instruments in Sea of Thieves. That's what they should have done.
---
Also annoying my arse off! And i thought only the finest peoplw got admission to vault 76, my guy can't even walk stairs proper hehe
---
Oh praise Atom if this is true.  I've been wanting to start a new character for a Bloodied Heavy Weapons build after a decent roll from the Purveyor.  That would make things easier, as my primary character is more of a crafter/collector.  I like the idea of having different characters complement each other, have one guy who learns all the plans, has high INT to craft/mod high quality items and send them to your other character.
---
Blight soup gives the same critical bonus and is leagues easier to find. Tons of blight in the ash heap.
---
Fallout has some of the friendliest players I‚Äôve ever seen, expect some level 170 player in power armor to run up to you menacingly within half an hour of starting, drop a bag full of plans and ammo, and spam the gift and heart emotes
---
No, but it's on a 24 hour timer.
---
Also a harder challenge is that but you put your camp in a right half corner and goto the camp then with no perk cards or serum/pre aquired mutations
---
I can help in around 20min
---
IGN: SemiPotent
---
What about tide pods
---
Daaang, good to know. It‚Äôs been enlightening to see what has been selling.
---
Same. Like, do I really *need* that cat shrub on my chemist bench? No. Am I gonna sacrifice it for extra budget? Hell no.
---
Same with the succulents all over the place.
---
I don‚Äôt do team invites because I use lone wanderer.
---
Use the stairs on the outside. Stand inside the building and get a sharpie. Draw a ladder on your tv/monitor in the style that you would like then forever only stand on that one place. Stop being so difficult, easy solution. :p
---
[check this video maybe it can help you](https://youtu.be/2AyA3qa8X24?t=717)
---
Just posting to confirm the issue, and that it's annoying. Almost as annoying as being at Max Caps (25K) and our store will happily still sell stuff even though we're on the other side of the map and powerless against it. *(I mean, short of being an arse by logging off while they're viewing our wares. I don't have that in me, though heh)*
---
yeah out of the 20 or so i did this week, I've gotten 2. It's a grind!
---
There's a difference between roleplaying and PVP.
---
It was one of the first places I found. I totally dug that. I wasnt being chased by anything on the way there. It was the screams that got me to go investigate.
---
Perhaps your camp didn‚Äôt have enough cat pictures?  Sometimes camps don‚Äôt meet quota and I have to add a cat picture.  
---
The letters thing sucks if you put them down wrong you just can‚Äôt pick them back up, that‚Äôs why my first vendor was called the ‚Äúcorner marret‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve seen a vending machine with a sign stating that it is for low levels. It had a bunch of useful items priced for 1-2 caps. I smiled and moved onto the next vendor camp.
---
I've went through spells where it was always the same, and then suddenly I'm in a different spot. There's a corner of my base and I'm almost always in that general vicinity, but not always in the same spot. I do know there's a traveling random encounter that likes to cut through my camp and I wonder if that has an effect on my spawn location.
---
Used them a couple of times and found them quite useful, not bought any and won‚Äôt as paying for a single use item seems a little pointless to me personally. But the free ones have been handy at times.
---
For sure, GT is Xwolfpackleader.
---
But sounds gross and definitely doesn't go with my pet megasloth.
---
Sorry to hear that happen, probably simple math coding gone wrong where the 10% tax made 1 cap into 0.9 cap and in game value defaulted to 0 since it probably doesn't store decimal numbers and counted each bullet sold separately. This might be reason why Player vending was delayed and the fix they did for it got undone like earlier duping glitch was just an old one that was unpatched.
---
Camp McClintock, sorry, mixed them up... there is a Camp Adams which is mapped here: https://m.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Camp_Adams
---
Sure thing. Just let me know when you're online. Ign LeeBuddy.
---
I understand completely. With two accounts, each with a team of mules, l‚Äôm sitting on close to 100k. Had to stop selling serums. 
---
While window shopping at others camps last night, I came across a sentinel ass + endurance scout armor leg for 10k. I‚Äôm still caressing it as I type this
---
I think it‚Äôs common sense and actually makes pretty logical sense to experience a moment of frustration over. üôÑ
---
Well a mod to make an existing backpack refrigerated won‚Äôt change the entire backpack will it.
---
I sell most of mine, 7 caps a pop (with hard bargain) adds up
---
Why?  All the radiation gives everything a light illumination.
---
I'm a builder at heart and while I love my CAMP, It has no food and no defenses. 
---
I also just need like 5% more to fill in a few extra spaces with decorations and add a few more lights and honestly ill be good!
---
i was here to log it as a suggestion and maybe see if other people had the same issues! im not unwilling to try other solutions. i‚Äôm making a work around idea right now with a sort of fire escape type thing on the outside. i just wish it could be as simple as i‚Äôm imagining that‚Äôs all. i cant be the only one who wants the tiniest home possible
---
 Anything that screws up VATS has my vote. It was useful when the RPG games needed it, although I never used it, but we have a pretty decent shooter now. 
---
 Why do we need this cheat?
---
If its battle royale you most likely wont be taking your weapons with you.  You would start with nothing and find weapons during the match. PVP with non legendary weapons is actually really fun id be hyped for it.
---
No one wanted a description of your life.
---
Fallout was a ‚Äú hot mess‚Äù on arrival, but I personally stuck with it because you can see all the potential and fun the game had. But Bethesda has done and amazing job fixing it and even going above and beyond to make the game better. Try Fallout76. It‚Äôs cheap enough where you can take a gamble. And I‚Äôm sure you would like it.
---
Why
---
Did you not hear what i said.. Much much more damage. No grind. Full auto .38 would kill in 3 hits if close up. 
---
Im talking about losing all of the lvls from players and weapons. Everything is deadly no legendary items at all.
---
Are you having a stroke or something? You are all over the place, and making zero sense here.
---
A threw together a simple bar awhile back that was part of a motel. I habitually move my CAMP around and remake it whenever the game can't place the CAMP so it's gone now, but I have pictures. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cS3zNPF.png](https://i.imgur.com/cS3zNPF.png)
---
[https://i.imgur.com/QvyG15L.png](https://i.imgur.com/QvyG15L.png)  
---
I used shelves to make the counter, behind the counter is a brewing station and a fermenter, next to it is a non-functional grill. In front of the bar are some stools, a clock, and a radio. I've got a pool table (unfortunately there's no pool game), tables, a couch, a vault-boy, and a bathtub for expelling spirits. It's not in the pictures, but at some point I got a dart board (also non-functional) from the atom store.
---
If I recall correctly the red couch and the hardwood floor texture are the only things from the atom store in there.
---
Destruction 100
---
Thx for your post!  Whats ur ign?
---
What bugs have you experienced? They are annoying to place from my experience and you can't put those wooden defences on the pre made stairs and floors thing like you can normal floors.
---
I guess I should stop playing it then. Too bad, as I was having so much fun :(
---
You can just put a bunch of those tiny letters behind a cabinet or workbench, then rotate it to hide the letters against the wall. Remember though that the budget increases for every levelup
---
BOS Sales have been slow but i dont get a lot of foot traffic. Plans decently but i try and sell quality hard to find Plans. Sold a few sets of the Clock Plans from the Rare Protectron Vendor (500 Caps Each) that i got when trying for the Hunter Long Coat. Surprisingly Disease Cure has been selling pretty well. I went through like 40 of them this weekend (10 caps each)
---
Same here, happens with 2H melee and my unarmed guy with regularity, mostly on stuff that should be 1 hit kills too...
---
They're aware of all the bugs, they are just praying that you don't notice them
---
Running speed Demon as well and that much water is still overkill. I haven't harvested my purifiers in a while, leaving them for lowbies and those who need it. And I'm still sitting on around 75 water in my stash and 20+ on my person. Even with the psychotats, it shouldn't take more than 2 of the largest purifiers to maintain your water levels. Unless you're popping them constantly even when out of combat. Lol.
---
I hope not. I'm a all-day explosive shotgunner myself and i use adamtium skeleton, because i hate to keep a distance. Without AS, i cripple myself with every shot.
---
Same thing happened to me once. Ran all the way to the Whitesprings via the Mire! At level 12. Was a lot of fun. 
---
Hint? Run!
---
Its fine, I know what you mean. Hell I‚Äôd settle to be able to place stairs on the left/right or attach it to a small quarter piece. Instead of having to whack it bang in the middle of a section and block most of the room.
---
Table and or Locker plan was the same deal when there‚Äôs more than one type and doesn‚Äôt tell you which one.
---
1 TSE .50 cal would do it.
---
me too.
---
I have one behind a locked door with a shotgun turret pointed at you. Everythings one cap if you go for it.
---
Oh you‚Äôve convinced me. 690 hours in and I‚Äôm quitting.
---
Just be careful with purveyor, lots of reports of stars disappearing off items, and kinda of hope they give us an option to have everything your main learns spread to your alts.
---
yeah that‚Äôs my other major complaint about stairs as well haha
---
They actually just changed that in a recent patch.  The honey beasts drop the good ones
---
Logically yeah, but not worth getting frustrated over
---
Oooo I just got one of these but with Faster Fire Rate and 25% less VATS cost.  Been thinking of starting a second character to build around it.
---
Probably correct. That's the case with #9 and #17. If so, I'm saving my Atoms for Mr Fuzzy (#10 - not #2 - if they ever introduce him).
---
Mothman spawn might be buggy?
---
I never saw one (save for the pacific one you find in the lighthouse mission) until around level 37/38 (I can assume it doesn't spawn to lesser players tho so that mgiht normal) and now, I get a Mothman to spawn to me every... well 3 days I log in?
---
At least 3 times he spawned at my CAMP which is outside of the spawning points on the map posted.
---
So far tho he didn't dropped the mothman feather to get the Tadpole achievement :/ Not that it matter since the frog habitat craftign is bugged but heh.
---
The problem isn't that the tool doesn't exist, it's that they aren't going to access to it to their front line customer service reps.
---
I really want the marine tactical helmet to go under the assault on helmet. It would look amazing
---
Crossbow bolts can usually be collected off enemies you kill too.
---
It looks better with the warband facepaint on
---
Oh geez. That might as well be ‚Äúrun all the way across the map without a damn thing at all.‚Äù Lol.
---
i really hate this excuse being used.  it is lazy in no way shape or form a point in a debate.  afterall someone could just say "if you want a pvp shitshow go play CoD" and boom more null point argument tier shit throwing
---
Todd just wants to reintroduce Morrowind mechanics.
---
Todd Howard you sly dog
---
This just sounds like bragging on your part , too bad you aren't on PS4 and i could show you the true meaning of getting your ass handed to you
---
I always move my CAMP device inside my building and I always spawn outside the building.
---
I'm not supposed to give my opinion....but, i think you should get Mole Miner flair. It is best flair. ;)
---
They show some mods on armor - Pockets and Deep Pockets add Pouches to armor. I was just hoping something like that for the backpack mods. High Capacity having some extra pouches, Armor Plated having metal Plates added on, Refrigerated could have a cooler integrated, etc.
---
I felt every party of this LMAO I do the same shit
---
Hm isn‚Äôt stopping me and my friends from having a good time
---
&gt; Fuck, maybe bloody needs to be nerfed haha.
---
Nah, other shit needs to be buffed. Bloodied isn't even that much stronger than anything else, it's just how bloodied synergizes with all these other multipliers that make it strong. You can play a bloodied build with other legendary types and be 80-90% as strong.
---
Shotguns aren't too weak, heavy weapons are a bit too strong, but they're also my favorite thing atm so I don't want them to be nerfed lol. Even with heavy weapons being too strong, it's by a pretty small margin, like 10% if even that. Commando builds can be just as strong if not stronger and those are rifle builds. Full auto vats builds are just at the top currently and I don't really see a problem with that. They should be, they're much more expensive to run.
---
That being said, shotguns are just fine. They can eat shit alive just like any other build can. Switch over to a full auto shotgun vats build and see for yourself. They might still be the strongest, it's just also one of the most expensive builds to run.
---
Go figure. The stock backpack is ugly too.
---
This happens for me too but it eventually pops the color it's supposed to be
---
How do you engage the thing? It always does the death eater fly away anytime I have seen him....
---
I am a melee so not sure if you have to shoot it first?
---
Last time I saw him he was watching me fight a Murluk queen at the Fishermans shack.
---
But took off again before I could engage.
---
Wasn‚Äôt interested and I noticed the other day I had like 12 repair kits available... never bought any and I didn‚Äôt think they were rewarded either but that must be wrong.
---
Carnivore is awesome- fighting enemies you get all sorts of meat (animals especially, but also ghouls, etc). Some meat like ionized meat doesn‚Äôt expire, so you can stock up during nuke zones and be good for awhile. I almost exclusively eat glowing meat when I have it and ionized meat otherwise. I have a friend with herbivore and he redid his whole mutations to get rid of it because he was tired of pausing during battle to go pick veggies. :)
---
Yo, my assaultron head went to 2* too. I was wondering WTF happened
---
I live on a sleep hill so I can't help it. üòÖ
---
I've had a sign next to my machines for the last two weeks that, hopefully, was concise enough to point this out.
---
Used the "Life After Death?" sign, spun it around backwards since it's all white, and using the Small Letters signs wrote:   
---
 `IF IM NEAR`   
---
   `INSPECT`    
---
`WORKS!` 
---
I'd have written more but that first line took up the width of the sign itself, plus I had budget constraints heh  
---
But yea... If I happen to see someone at my shop whilst I'm out adventuring (but usually I'm alerted after they've bought something), I immediately travel home and then Emote so that they hear me and won't fast travel away. Not everyone seems to 'get' why and probably think I'm just insecure about them being at my base (even though they can't harm it), but at least 1/3^(rd) of you will in turn re-look at the Armor and Weapons machines :)   
---
*(I only bother to sell Legendary items or harder-to-find clothing items, as to not waste folk's time by seeing 20+ weapons and they're just things you can craft... heh So I can totally appreciate the frustration of not being able to see what the other Legendary Effects are!)*
---
I cannot remove any of the top floor from my house as it's all apparently *vital to the structural integrity*. Even the platforms around the edge for a couple of turrets. The CAMP system needs a good overhaul, a 50% budget increase and well, just fixing. The list of things you can't do far outweighs what you can and it all seems very arbitrary.
---
Robots don‚Äôt need my pie!
---
Hmm. You've really moved me with your extensive and well thought out arguments. I look at Fallout 76 in a completely different light now. Lead us to fallout glory, oh pontificating phenom of philosophy!
---
Now make some fart noises to really drive it home!
---
It's still one of the top three secondary effects depending on what you value. Fire rate and VATS crits being the other two.
---
If anything, you may have to discourage people from being too helpful at times, yes I am serious.  
---
When you start playing do two things 1) enable pacifist mode in the game settings on the main menu which will keep you accidentally damaging another player with you weapons and 2) be aware that if you take control of a workshop, whether anyone owns it already or not, you automatically consent to pvp by those who want to take that workshop from you.  For the most part workshop owners are left alone to pursue their resource farming, but the munitions factory in particular is coveted by many so you run the greatest risk there.  
---
Also, there are still some griefers in the game though most have left or stay in the beta pvp servers.  The current griefer meta is for someone to randomly give you a team invite, then they engage in pvp with a partner not on your team which makes you vulnerable.  Again this is rare but it does sometimes happen so you need to be aware that it can.    It is also rare but some folks get their jollies from setting up vendor camps on cliff sides to bait people into fast travelling their and seeing to it they fall by either removing floors or manipulating the fast travel point to be off the edge of the cliff.   If you are in power armor or have two pieces of armor that reduce falling damage by 50% you have nothing to fear, but not everyone has those items.
---
The player base there very friendly overeall and you won't see another player most of the time, and when you do it is mainly for event type activities.  It is a very enjoyable game.  There are some flaws here and there, but they are being addressed.  Best wishes.
---
At 595lbs I‚Äôm not complaining at all...lol
---
Hahaha, as another dude that plays a female character, I definitely can relate to the first part. Though it's funny to get their reaction when I finally say something over the mic with my deep southern accent.
---
Yeah I really miss exploring them and learning their horrible experiments.
---
&gt; Almost every player vendor has ammo for 1c each just use them also typewriters and other junk are plentiful if you know where to look.
---
-That they are which is why I'm suggesting the NPC vendors be more competitive. Typewriter was used for reference I know a spot where about 20 spawn haha.
---
Well yes and no... it's like stash space once you learn how to manage it it's easy to work with.
---
-I have NO clue what to delete at this point. Everything has its place and one little thing that's deleted means for example this hallway is now too dark, or this room now feels too empty. It's maddening I tell you!
---
I had always assumed I'd be able to drop junk items like in 3, 4, and NV :( I need a plunger in my porta-potty. I NEED a cooking pot on my stove...but what I need more than anything is a 10mm Pistol and a box of ammo sitting on my nightstand.
---
I cant Imagine ONE single person that actually wants Fallout Battle Royale :/
---
That‚Äôs pure gold.
---
Nice. This will definitely help. Thanks bud.
---
Did some searching and yeah they all are Atom Shop Exclusive. [Check under the Armor section here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine/)
---
The pass through junction conduit is the intended way to pass power through a wall. Conduits also have the benefit of not scraping to nothing like wire, so when you move conduit you won't lose your precious copper. The pass through junction conduit is a bit fiddly, for some reason the connection point for the wire to the conduit is in the middle of the conduit rather than on the wire connector. There is a downside, because you can't build to a grid there's no possible way to make the conduit straight. No matter how hard you try there's going to be a slight angle to the conduit, so very long runs will be askew.
---
They are one with road of bone now
---
I feel you. I love the gun too. It‚Äôs finally in a good place for the most part. I would hope they wouldn‚Äôt nerf it after they just fixed it
---
Yes but it‚Äôs not always there and some people don‚Äôt want to grind for it.
---
Djego
---
Of course they should do this. 
---
I really feel for people with poor eyesight, but they aren't the majority, and the world shouldn't be ruled by edge cases.
---
Even if they started tracking this today there's no way to know what effects were lost in the past. They weren't saved at all.
---
Yep, and the only option is to re-place your camp module and repeat that a dozen times until it eventually decides to work. I've wasted hundreds doing it.
---
Somehow I knew it was going to be that one before clicking the link.
---
ScientistRickSanchez used Burn.
---
It's super effective!
---
What one's better though? I assume ultracite right?
---
1) Dump all your supply holotapes in a suitcase at Morgantown station  
---
2) Go back 30 minutes later, all the ones you left are there plus 100 more.
---
If you're that desperate for  US Government Supply  holotapes, just go on mic and ask people to give you some. I'm probably carrying about 200 of the damned things at any given times and would gladly hand them off for free to anyone who'd use them.
---
Similar for me. I am by Sutton and will, on occasion, mod a lower level weapon (mostly to use up resources) and put it in player vending. If it doesn't sell after a few play sessions then i'll sell it to a vendor. I have put up some legendaries for sale, but I will mostly scrip them since I have yet to ever hit the max. scrip on a day. i didnt have a stack of them in my stash as i used to sell unused weapons to vendors. my stash has like 2 weapons in it and i carry 1 or 2 with me.
---
It is. Same way the SBQ can drop a Drill. Just a basic ass Drill. It should have three effects but the max for a Drill is zero so you get... zero.
---
Read the description of the game per launch of e3. This game is literally reusing assets from fo4 to make a multiplayer game out of it.
---
That‚Äôs really not for you to determine for me. üòä
---
I just spent a few hours modding fnv last night, it's quite a mess too. Wouldn't believe how many basic things only work right with a mod to fix them.
---
Never ‚Äútrade‚Äù anything unless you know them personally or you‚Äôve played with them for a while and at least somewhat know them. It‚Äôs not worth it.

Yeah no stars disappearing from this item after several days, think I'm safe there.  It's a Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Laser with Faster Fire Rate and 25% less VATS cost.  Apparently a decent heavy weapon, gonna probably roll a new character to build toward [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343cb8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ic4s10ip2ir2l71ls2lt2a04ei2eu0sg2s22pe2a42s72cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Energy&amp;m=2fc).
---
And why thats? :D
---
It just seems like you shouldn‚Äôt have to google search what is ‚Äúx‚Äù in order to determine where the plans you bought are. That‚Äôs silly.
---
Bethesda really need to address the problems of moving camps. Almost every time I move, even if I placing the base on flat ground I get the 'Cannot place item: Needs support' error message. I have a 3 x 2 concrete block foundation, and the areas I can place camps this type of camp are limited enough by uneven ground and slopes, but why should I have a problem placing a foundation on a perfectly flat golf course at Whitesprings?
---
The error message must be bogus, as it does not make any sense.
---
I suggest just going over the top expensive. That way there‚Äôs no question that you‚Äôre going for laughs. My fourth vending machine has only one item in it:
---
Perfectly Preserved Pie.                            25000c
---
How did you get a one star explosive?
---
IGN Codemonkey001. Will gladly die for someone willing to do the same for me, on PC and will be back on at 7PM EDT. Already a Possum scout, but it bugs me to have that one achievement sitting at 5/6.
---
I dont mind it too much the standard (non Tadpole) one fits well with the Drifter outfit i was just hoping for some variety.
---
Nice find. I am more of a pve players so my personal hunt in unyielding + AP refresh + weight reduction pieces.
---
I've given many people here a link to this video. https://youtu.be/fJzgi3w5KVE it works for me and all of them. Hope it works for you.
---
I would also like a gallery of the variations of the backpack.  Haven't found one yet.
---
It was my idea. During one of my wrestling sessions with Todd (he's training to be a Park Ranger) I told him he should put player vending machines in Fallout 76. He let go of me, whipped out his cell brick (it's literally a brick with random phone pieces glued to it) and screamed "PLAYER VENDORS" into the phone then he gave me a thumbs up.
---
This is another possibly. I went with the more the psychological approach cause Vault Tec has done it with other vaults. Vault 101 was one and based on what would happen if you put one person in charge and brainwashed everyone into thinking that the overseers word is absolute. Then there was the vault in New Vegas that had all manner of recreational activities but no beds or living quarters.
---
But yours also makes sense, since they were pulled from science and engineering backgrounds, but not from a survivalist or limited survivalist background.
---
Its 2019. You should know how to spell properly
---
Got a real embarassing noise out of me. Damn you.
---
Very frequent, I'm on PC running a 1080.  Not terribly noticeable all the time, but it's usually there.
---
What? I've been paying underage chinese children to play my game for me since day 1. I don't want to actually play the game, I just want bragging rights of having the elite meta, and hundreds of hours to pick up ladies.
---
Roight!
---
Good call, I hear it gets super shitty at hour 691. :)
---
Found him on Xbox at Wavy Willards. GT: irion15. I'll be on for a while.
---
I have an AA SS pole hook with a puncturing mod. Love it.
---
It doesn‚Äôt apply to explosive launchers (fat man, broadsider, grenade launchers, etc). Those are explosive by default and only benefit from demo expert.
---
The harpoon gun is a heavy gun by default and normally benefits from heavy gunner. Similar to a 50 cal MG or the light machine gun.
---
However if you get a legendary harpoon gun, LMG, etc with explosive on it, then it also benefits from demo expert. Same goes for any rifle, pistol etc. they benefit from their normal perk cards plus demo expert which boosts the legendary effect‚Äôs explosive damage. 
---
Rank 5 demo expert on any weapon with ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù stacks for 32% additional damage overall. 20% from explosive x 1.6 for demo expert = 32% total.
---
I never know who's a dude and who's not. I turn down all voice chat, super anti social. If I send a team invite, I either want fast travel or to share an event. That's all.
---
To bad people screw it up for us
---
Phew, thanks dude, close call.
---
Like w the posts and foundations ? Being in scrappable?  I figured out what I was doing wrong there...
---
There‚Äôs two lockers, one old looking like in mines and one that looks like the ones in the bunker. Separate plans named the same. 
---
You‚Äôd think they couldn‚Äôt place a 1 or a 2 after it and same goes for many other plans
---
Well, tge bug repelent daily quest shows that the bugs are NOT everywhere...
---
That's great news!
---
Wonder if the equally-big-deal of "spawning inside foundations" will *also* be fixed... lol  
---
\*fingers crossed\*
---
Yeah so the +91 DR of the backpack is like wearing an extra heavy bos chestpiece :D
---
 Well it is perhaps their best game so far. ;)
---
The thing is most vaults don't know they're an experiment. 76's overseer was told it was a control vault, but would Vault-Tec *REALLY* tell an overseer they were being subject to experimentation?
---
A few patches ago everything instantly loaded in. A recent patch regressed the change.
---
Nope, I have not.
---
I am with Ram√≠rez on this one ;)
---
Black Pudding though, yes please :) :)
---
Vault 76‚Äôs real secret:  all vault dwellers are the same height!  What a sick twisted experiment.
---
Be the NPC Bethesda didn‚Äôt give us! It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. Now that we have a firm grip on the game and great gear, we can shape everyone else‚Äôs experience with the game. Start playing for others now that you‚Äôve done it all. You never know what‚Äôll come of just helping a stranger. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs kept the game interesting for me over 850hrs in
---
There is no need to reinvent the wheel here. there are literally dozens upon dozens of games that have different systems that guarantee that that does not happen. Limit drop per day, limits how many you can hold. Decreased chance after each successful drop etc. 
---
These measurements exist in a huge amount of games. Just make sure there are such systems in place, and the divide between players will decrease instead of increase.
---
Thank you man! This will help
---
That's unfortunate... and I cannot recall if I have seen an Angler drop one. It's quite possible. I will look this evening.
---
I wish they would add MIDI support so you could play your own songs on instruments.
---
Yeah it used to work fine but it's been broken for a few weeks now at least.
---
Yep, that aanoys me. I spend ressources crafting the 105 mm zoom to snap pics of dangerous foes like the Sulfurie (scorched bat?) from further away. And found out that you basically need to shove your objective to her face to get it to work.
---
I got nice pics tho because one spawned near Huntersville so I was running around with stimpaks and my camera snapping epic pics of beast/VS Super Mutants fights.
---
Enjoying a game is THE reason why games are made. Bot enjoying a game is normal since no game (even the fabled, super-duper, praise-CDPR Witcher 3) is for everybody. There are tons of people who enjoy the game, ergo Bethesda made a good decision to make the game!
---
Thanks for the link. Sigh...looks like no plush Mr Fuzzy (makes sense as it'd be a completely different mesh than the others which are skins of the same four meshes).
---
YEAH! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE PICK UP ALL THAT JUNK JUST LYING AROUND!  WIRES AND METAL AND CHUNKS OF WOOD ALL OVER THE STREETS! WHAT A MESS!
---
With 5 food, drink, and chem pieces, purified water weighs 0.05 lbs and inert flux is 0.2 lbs. It's glorious.
---
Ghoul build
---
It's nearly as bad as eating one of those hotdogs from Camden Park. Maybe they're made of Yao Guai meat.
---
Just saw this, you get the request?
---
A build i really find enjoyable is a bloodied switchblade and vats
---
oh - I guess you use vats a lot? 'cause that's a lot
---
Whenever you come across broken stuff, you can repair one by one.  You can't interact with their CAMP at all, but you can wander and fix.
---
I figured I'd do it cause 1) i have the spare stuff bursting out of my stash, and 2) it just good form.
---
Also, I have my camp set up with missile launchers, so they do the trick, but I would hate to come back to find my camp is destroyed cause random players led a hoard to my base and left it undefended.  If I wouldn't want that, I would never wish it upon others.
---
Made a few gigs of video about them
---
Snapping needs to be toggle able, Clipping needs to be aloud, most restrictions need to be removed, aside from the circular build area, and camps should be able to be built closer, shorten the distance by at least half, Letters shouldn't have a build limit and take up space, welcome map fast travel locations need to be put back in. Items being sold at vendors shouldn't take up build space, I have home defense and turrets are useless, a level 30 dog made it up to and destroyed 3, level 2 turrets. Turrets are also shorter then defensive placements, so you cant put them behind it or else they cant shoot anything.
---
Im sorry, building is one of the most frustrating things about this game and it has 0 effect on nearly any of it, besides for the workbenches but they are everywhere anyway.
---
So I should grab both for the TSE railway rifle I have then?
---
Congrats on the FE GP; that's a mighty good weapon.
---
That is bad luck. For myself, the event and two dailies give a badge about 25% of the time
---

---
NaN, you have been insulted.
---
Ive had this as well, as another poster pointed out, even though the # it displays increases exponentially, you nver actually exceed the amount you started with
---
once you log off and back on, it all gets reset
---
its just a visual bug, but still a good idea to report it so it can be fixed
---
Yea the Tesla isn‚Äôt legendary and is objectively more powerful than any other gun in the game by mechanics alone.
---
Also, abandoning the idea of level is counter to like... the whole idea of an MMO/MO game, which is clearly the goal here. They‚Äôre going for a WoW feel here, not CS or Rainbow.
---
I didnt say i havent
---
Sounds like fun tbh. But not so much at lv50.
---
These comments are more fun than the game itself
---
Troll? Stupid person? Too lazy to give a solid argument as to why the game is still a mess?
---
I don't know, but what i do know is that OP has a pretty interesting post history..
---
Wait ZAX? The supercomputer AI from Fallout 2?
---
There's one near the tattoo parlor in morgantown
---
You dont get the AP, but you still get the accuracy with Plasma/Laser (its very noticable how much more accurate my TSE GP is when I use stabalized than when I dont)
---
If you can‚Äôt find evidence, then you should train your google skills
---
Haven't got anything yet. Whats ur ign
---
Yeah, core/VATS
---
Explosive harpoon guns are like this as well. Put on flechettes and you have yourself a super shotgun. Shoot 1 get 8 back.
---
Last time I did an ID check on items in a beth game, it had unique ID's for each item... unless they were identical.  Any alteration to the item (adding a scope) would alter the ID.
---
Basically if you can stack it (duped gun) it has the same ID.  Hence how they 'removed' duped items a couple months back...
---
Nah, tried using it in the uranium fever event (since this game has surprised me multiple times) but didn‚Äôt work. I take it you‚Äôre new to the game? What platform do you play on?
---
Funny your Ex said the same about you.
---
Carnivore is great because you can eat spoiled meat without catching disease, and dog food still satisfies hunger bar
---
I‚Äôm sure Bethesda is devastated that your solution was (checks notes) buying more stuff
---
I liked that one
---
 Get close and look at something, if it's broke you'll get a prompt allowing you to repair it. Costs junk, but it's a cool thing to do.
---
I was in the middle of a tense PVP fight, and my gun broke, the other player must have realized something was up, and pressed his advantage.
---
Luckily, instead of having to be wily and creative, or escape the situation to repair my weapons, i could just use a repair kit.
---
I like having this advantage over others who didnt pay for it.
---
*~BuT YoU CaN GeT ThEm FoR fReE fRoM sBq!!!!!~!**

Why do people like you even play FO76? You don't want to play the game, you just want to annoy people- like you're doing with this post. You're not going to be playing this game next year, or the year after. Greifers never last, and generally aren't even fans. You made a whining post about players whining... just like the dupers who after one month with their non-deserved TSE and 50,000 stacked bobbleheads would says "this game sucks" constantly over area chat.
---
Me too, no hard feelings, just hopping on the roast train.
---
Saw a CAMP built around that little cave and just around the Yogi Bear were punji boards. It cracked me up! good spot!
---
That would set off a paytowin firestorm worse than anything that has come before.
---
1. I don't disagree - but just a question, is there any spawns other than 1\* or 3\*? I can't remember EVER seeing a 2\* legendary.  It may end up being that 3\* can drop 2\* or 3\* but no 1\*.  The other side effect may simply be a decrease in the number of 3\* legendary spawns (so basically, same amount of legendaries of the same quality out in the world, but when you see a 3\* you know it's going to be better than a 1\* legendary)
---
2. This comes up a lot, and personally I think the issue is they were too loose with the freedom to respec your character.  Most other games with builds don't usually let you do it on the fly in the middle of an adventure to change things.  Personally i would prefer they encourage builds.  I know my opinion of this is very unpopular, but I think that it would be better to require us to be sleeping at a bed to swap our cards.  Then give us some actual reasons to be certain builds (you should be rewarded for playing a thief build who simply sneaks around and steals things). Alternatively, simply give us 3 build slots we can set and can easily change.  
---
3. I can't speak to this, I have never used scrapper, and between my junk runs, my junk extractor, and use of the perks that greatly increase the durability of the repaired item, I don't have any issues with repair costs. 
---
4. I agree, I would also like to see factions have a greater impact.  You can stay as "Neutral" character, or do some quests for a faction.  Faction quests have rewards but also can open you up to PVP of opposing factions... or something.  But I agree, I wish more was done with factions. 
---
5. I wouldn't mind if they did something, but i've seen a few times a handful of camps built very close to each other near the Overseers camp.  It could almost feel like a small town. I think the big barrier is that we are not tied to servers.  But I think it would be pretty cool if even a small group of players worked together to build camps fairly close to eachother to build a small community. 
---
6. The cap thing is simply a money sink. The game NEEDs a way to get rid of the caps people earn.  Otherwise inflation will happen.  The daily caps you can earn from vendors, the cost of caps to fast travel, move your camp, and the 10% "tax" from vendors are all ways to balance the caps in the game.  I know people don't like it, but it is a necessary evil in any game that has infinite money.
---
On my way.

"XBOX" is not a company
---
I thought the Queen was immune to cripple. Other SB go down, but you can shoot her wings all day with full Enforcer and she just keeps flying till she's damn good and ready to land.
---
I got a 3\* troubleshooter's pipe revolver from the Purveyor, immediately renamed it "sell dis shit" like I do to mark all the legendaries that don't fit my current build for easy sorting. TBH nothing I've gotten from her so far has been of any use to me; I suppose I should take the hints RNGeezus keeps throwing at me and build a full set of Urban Scout Armor and Nocturnal weapons instead of looking to improve my current inventory.
---
do you need pa for that? Or do you have carry weight issues
---
Oh man, I think our second day of playing my wife, cousin, and I ran across other players doing an event. We play in the same room so we don't need mics on (and our cousin's laptop won't recognize any mic for some reason) so we coordinate together and help out as best we can. We finish and this guy *homes in* on my wife asking if she has a mic and all that. Just damn.
---
thats funny, because at the E3 intervuew they said they are trying to __REDUCE__ PvP interactions
---
Literally found this, sold it for 5k
---
&gt;will i be immediately overrun by hardcore players and nuke blasts? Or will i be able to, you know, just build my little camp, grind something nice and see a friendly face once in a while? Because that's what i want to do after a long tiresome day.
---
76 has exactly what you're looking for. Just play adventure mode (what most people play) and you probably will never PvP anyone. Generally, my experience with super hardcore plays has been just them giving me some free loot they don't want :)   
---
This just isn't a super hardcore game. Everyone can solo just about everything even without super-powerful gear. And for those rare events that need more people, everyone just shows up anyway.
---
Luck has absoolutely no effect on anything like that.
---
Can we build "portable" instruments and act as bards, anyone on our team or in a radius gets the AP boost while we play it.
---
 I've been leaving my doors open on purpose so people don't spawn inside and get locked in. Suppose I could just remove the locks.....
---
If I see the player, I usually accept (especially if we chatted a little over area chat and they seem ok) but I usually don‚Äôt accept random invites if I have no idea where the player is or who they are. Maybe they want a fast travel point or whatever, but I hate when you just get ‚Äò[name] sent you a team invite‚Äô and you‚Äôre trying to figure out who the hell that person is
---
If someone's asking for a team invite its most likely to fast travel for free
---
I use 'em when it's convenient. Fitting, considering they were billed as "convenience" items and are exactly that. Never purchased one off the shop, just queen drops. Typically used to repair weapons after fighting the queen, allowing me to use my mats for ammo or somesuch.
---
Yeah PA and use cal shocks for weight.
---
For non PA my vats is limited, but try to use AP pieces.
---
It's kind of odd.
---
You mostly fight robots but I always go for ballistic resist.
---
No.
---
I have a stack of 100 that I listed for 5c a pop, and no one has bought any. No one buys any of my meds really. Once I put them in my stash and lose my traveling Pharmacy perk, they take up too much space and no one ever seems to buy them.
---
I just started selling them to the vendor
---
I have a shotgunner build. Even with a normal shotgun, this is playing on easy mode. You can cripple damn near anything and finish it at leisure. Yea, one-shot is not a thing. So what? you can solo everything, and crowd control swarms like a boss so who needs it?
---
I got a hold of an AA/+250 defense/+reload_speed combat shotgun (IIRC) and it is now god mode.
---
I mean.. I get WoW or diablo pvp.. There is so many styles that allow for unique attacks and counters. This game has balistic /energy/rads/and chill? Its not even scratching the surface of a mmo style. 
---
However as a survival its in a great place. PA could allow you to tank a few high caliber rounds. Finding a crafting weapons is all survival.
---
It will never be mmo in the style your thinking. But its a few big tweaks away from being a very fun survival game.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs less because you‚Äôre a dude and more because you‚Äôre exhibiting behavior relative to someone new or ignorant of certain game features.
---
I play with a majority of dudes, and constantly find myself explaining parts of the game to them, not because their dudes, but because they lack the knowledge.
---
Please don‚Äôt be so quick to jump on the gender wagon, the world is volatile as is with all of the gender hate, bringing it to a online video game just removes the fun. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who has read a handful of your posts in the past, and taking that in regard when writing this message.
---
They didn‚Äôt... that‚Äôs not even possible.
---
I hear it said that AP is not working with energy weapons but speaking for myself if that is true and they patch it then energy weapons would approach being OP.  My energy gatlings/flammers melt enemies in short order and I use them often.  Hard to imagine they could be even better.
---
The what wendigo? Never heard of that one
---
That‚Äôs good info. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre a lot more useful in survival than adventure.
---
I get easily scared ingame. I consider Minecraft Survival nights quite scary. And zombie sections of Return to Castle Wolfenstein were borderline nightmare for me. So it's no surprise I was shitting bricks in these cabins during the first visit. It's quite a cheap scare, but it works on people like me, who give in to their primar scare instincts...
---
Those are tasty, leave them be
---
You are the winner of Fallout 76. That is Amazing!

For the cargo bot photo I launched the Morgantown Airport event for cargo bot resupply. It‚Äôs an early quest where you have 5 waves of low level scorched and a cargo bot drops a package on the landing pad. It needs to be very close for it to register.
---
Wish I could see their fo level when they invite me. I too don't accept any invites since most have been hostile or just leeches. I'm all about helping out players, I often drop significant items if I bump into someone that ends up being cool or seems like a legit new player, not mule. But if I could see the invite was from someone near my level I'd be more app to consider accepting. 
---
I also believe in online recognition. If you are one level higher than me I will show you respect. You want to scrap script? Please go ahead of me, you need the stove, have at it, I'll wait. I do this because I chose this s my game style, not because u expect anyone else to do it. But gosh it would be nice lol
---
I‚Äôm stopping, I‚Äôm giving up at 100 Hours
---
You on PS4 ?
---
Looks good!
---
Seems like certain servers tend to drop similar items and legendary effects. I've noticed that when I play in group I'll often get the same prefix drop off a legendary as my teammates but it'll be a different weapon type or armor. If something is dropping the same stuff try switching servers. Explosive weapons aren't all that common of a drop. TSE stuff has only dropped three times for me in over 800 hours, two of which were two star from the SBQ.
---
I like it. It‚Äôs like a tiny rest stop on a highway. Just needs a porta potty.
---
Ugh, you're one of these button-fuckers, aren't you?
---
I deal with you lot all day long.
---
"We have an issue with &lt;tool&gt;"
---
"I don't see why they can't just press a fucking button and fix it."
---
"Apparently it's not that easy"
---
"Hah! Good job I'm not the boss, I'd fire the lot of them and hire someone to press the button!"
---
"Yes, good job you're not the boss."
---
Do you seriously think it's this trivial?
---
Thx for the up!
---
There's nothing to worry about really, most people (literally 99.9%) are really nice and genuinely want to help you and play peacefully. I've played with so many strangers since release and not one of them has tried to grief my camp.
---
Probably. Most people just pop between survival and adventure though.
---
Crappy part is, I saved up chems for weeks to sell at the vendor. Seems all wasted time now.
---
If you are on Xbox, I'll hook you up with a ton of chems for cheap lol.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs worth it to start over though. I‚Äôm having so much more fun on my second character now that I know how to play.
---
Well go back to playing Rust ‚Äúthe game that has no glitches‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I decided to trot my happy little self from Camp Venture down to the highway, skirt around The General's Steakhouse, and discover Mac's farm...just hadn't gone by there yet. Easy trip, right? Wrong.
---
lvl 60 diseased Mega Sloth was first in the woods, then a pack of super mutants with a 3\* legendary, next was a 1\* Sheepsquatch...finally made it to the farm for the mirelurk king and queen combo with all of their glowing crab friends.  Burned so much ammo and stimpacks it hurt to walk afterwards.
---
I just wanted to see the farm, lol.
---
The one time I got the insult bot he went for the how I hid in a vault like a coward while everyone else died.
---
Same here, noticed it and my Tricentennial salute were missing, checked the shop, found my Tricentennial salute and checked it, but the gift emote is completely gone. WTF Bethesda.
---
Sadly, at least in all my experience with checking, once you've logged out of the game on PC... that "History" tab resets :(
---
At any rate, I'm not lvl 301, nor am I nearly as bad-ass as most players my level (151) as my gear is "average"... However, you're welcome to add me if you need a hand: Formula350
---
Just be aware, I don't have a means of voice chatting, so I'm limited to Emotes and gesturing with a drawn weapon! lol 
---
Oh and just in case you do add me...   
---
I've helped a couple people recently who I initially was able to hear but they eventually ended up not talking clearly into their mic anymore and despite my creative attempt to convey this through continual **???** emotes combined with equipping-unequipping-equipping my helm... they didn't quite figure it out and so I just kinda went with the flow. 
---
So yea, that'll be the code for "I can't hear you :(" lol  
---
*(also, yes, all volume sliders are maxed, and no it wasn't the game sounds drowning them out, as I could hear other people clear as day :P)*
---
I‚Äôm on PC and I don‚Äôt use chems but maybe make a post on a trading sub?
---
I am having an issue I believe with 3 medic challenges to shot a Radstag, wolf, and you gai with a stringer not registering after numerous tries.
---
I tried basic syringer, bleed syringer, endersol syringer multiple times on each with no luck registering.
---
Keep in mind that depending on the area (global) you will have different mentalities as to what is "right". pvp or players helping others... You, being in India may have completely other people that you will be playing with due to shorter ping times on local servers.
---
Even in the same area I've heard that the Xbox players do pvp more than he PC players. This is what I've heard so please don't attack me it's incorrect.
---
My dad is currently level 14 on PC and is not getting hit by others.. so I'd say it's "safe".
---
This game is about personal preference and not made to suit all kinds of different people. Sure go hate it, I don‚Äôt care, doesn‚Äôt stop me from playing.
---
&gt; we desperately need a meaningful cap sink
---
Agreed, but ideas welcomed on what form this would take.
---
^this 100%.
---
No prob
---
How did you get a scoped Tesla? Or should I say how did the game glitch and give you a scoped Tesla?

That‚Äôs epic

---
Indeed i agree with you about the simpler formats. Way better and enjoyable than those unbelievable "do this while that with this. While rad storm"
---
Agreed. Placing walls next to them sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Placing objects near them will also sometimes cause the objects to freak out and seemingly disappears, and reappears in a different part of my camp later on. And of course there is the bug where you can't remove the stairs and get an error saying that removing them would make another part of the camp inaccessible, even when there is nothing else there.
---
I dunno. Do we really want to protect people this stupid from such a learning experience?
---
Wheras psycho, med-x and jet are available prescription free in every pharmacy.
---
I love doing that. Makes me feel like how pretty much every other faction probably felt before the fall. Once the Scorchbeasts started coming there was nothing left to do but run.
---
You‚Äôd have to be blind not to choose it.
---
They were really dark at launch and it was bad.
---
&gt; i want some non dingy under garments
---
I prefer mine pre-owned with mud and blood wash.
---
Actually no you assuming dick I am a fucking programmer
---
Shots fire, I've had it trigger multiple times on my heavy .50
---
I suggest going with the Lever action rifle since its the best for stealth in my opinion atleast.
---
Instigating and Anti Armor work very Well if you have a full health build.
---
And as for the stars on the weapon if its not explosive then its doesnt raise your dmg one bit more so enhances your vats abilitys and other attributes so a multi star is definetly not necessary for you to kick ass.
---
i can discord with you if you'd like and try to help you with your build. Audio discussions fair much easier.
---
They need to allow you to bulk ammo. Say, 100 round blocks. That would answer this problem nicely.
---
Sorry bud, but you get burned by random strangers a few times and you learn to be cautious. I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs the shitheads (specifically the shitheads, not the non shitheads) sending random team invites screwing it up for you, not those of us too fed up with their bs to not accept random invites anymore.
---
Strange thing is I get a ton of marine legendary also.
---
Per trigger pull, from everything I've seen. It's better on semi-auto weapons, not fully auto weapons.
---
Bethesda has a history of doing jump scares in the games I've played (FO3, NV, and 4 and the Elder Scrolls series) -- glitching skeletons and mannequins seem to be their favorites.  This was just one of the ways they like to keep us on our toes.  And you are CERTAINLY NOT the only person to be freaked out at the Cabins.

He doesnt need to be a game developer to expect a product to work. If I read a book and it was missing pages I would be in the right to say "what the hell?" Even though I am not a printer.
---
Oh gross, I‚Äôm so sorry for her experience. üò©
---
This game is perfect to play casually my friend, get it!
---
Cranberry Relish works with Carnivore.   That was my biggest concern.   It is a fantastic mutation to have.
---
Are we talking about the same Rust?
---
On top of Watoga Civic Center (North-West corner; stairs are on East side), where one of the Signal Repeaters are for the Enclave quest (if you've ever done it), there are two lootable Scorchbeast Nests on the ground near the dead Brahmin. They pretty much contain the same corpse-related loot as a downed SB, along with some human skeletal remains, so there's a fair chance you'll find what you're after in there. 
---
I know I've seen plenty of Lungs, Brains, and Hearts (as well as SB Bones, Hide and Wings), so surely what you'd need will eventually show up. Quicker to get to, and saves ammo and time vs shooting one down. :)
---
I run a stealth build with an anti armor explosive handmade. Handmade and lever seem to be up top for steath.
---
Vault 86 had free teleports!
---
I said it before. The faction bots should offer hourly flash sales. Responder boys sell aide items 10% cheaper. That sort of thing.
---
I did the quests 2 times each for two days and got 4 badges then suddenly started getting none. If it really is 25% or 5% then I'm just a lucky guy lol
---
Agree wholeheartedly!
---
cause I have ap regenerating armor in my vendor
---
can't help you w carry weight
---
I will say with a full set of unyielding and the backpack my carrying capacity outside of PA is north of 400
---
You probably want Bloodied, but it's going to be a change of playstyle if you're used to playing at full health.
---
The weapon will do max damage at under 20% health. This stacks with the mutation Adrenal Reaction. You pair this with Covert Operative for insane damage numbers. Basically everything in the game with the exceptions of Sheepsquatch and SBQ are one-shot kills.
---
You'll need to go hard into stealth though. Unless you hybrid it with defensive stuff (this can be done!), if you're seen you're toast. So chameleon and stealth perks are your friend. VATS is going to be your best buddy in many cases.
---
Gear will be hard. You'll need at the minimum 4 pieces of Unyielding and one Chameleon. 1* pieces will do OK at the start, but you'll grow to love secondaries like AP refresh and tertiaries like Sentinel. You'll want to eventually go for a Bloodied Vats/Vats rifle of some kind. This will cost you approximately one first born, one kidney, and 60% of your healthy liver.
---
Plenty of build guides out there on Bloodied snipers if you want to try this out.
---
There definitely a few bugs withcamp building I really hope gets fixed.
---
Nah, most people just don't like listening to whining.

Dang dude, guess I'll have to keep going tonight and hope to get 2 more badges so I can get that high capacity or refrigerated back pack.
---
Dude, 100% do not tell me what to do. I live in the US and get that quite enough from the top down on the daily, I do not need it from internet strangers. 
---
There are lots of good guys. There are also guys I‚Äôve run in and helped out with SB‚Äôs who proceed to ‚Äúeducate me‚Äù.

Don‚Äôt like women‚Äôs complaints on the issue? Ignore them and make sure you‚Äôre not part of the problem. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
the vats perk does increased damage per vats shot and takes 3 - 4 shots to get to 95% on all shots.
---
I really dont think youre poor compared to anyone.
---
...what's your actual build, what are your stats, what perk cards are you running, what is your fucking goal, dude?
---
I was trolled in the first dungeon after me and 3 strangers finished it. One of the guys level 150 had 5% health a started shooting at me when I explosive shotgun when I was collecting junk at the end.
---
I used my auto shotgun and he auto healed and killed me and then everyone took my junk.
---
I‚Äôm hardly ever at my camp. It‚Äôs very minimal.
---
If you camp does get trashed by trolls you can always just move it and it auto repairs with the normal cost (10-40 caps) of moving it.
---
I‚Äôve recently just got to level 50 as I only play the odd Saturday and some evenings. Still meaning to play the Scouts quest line and level up to get the skills I missed.
---
Add me, I‚Äôll help if I can.
---
(GT same as my username).
---
I sent a request
---
Don‚Äôt trust (critl it) he‚Äôs not to be trusted or traded with. Thief!!
---
I don't want to be complete "No way am I paying that, no matter how funny".
---
I did have the t-shirt and jeans for like 1000c. Mistress of Mystery gem necklace for lik 9999, lol.
---
Dropped all the prices lower so they're still absurd, but not totally unreasonable.
---
Except the bears/Mr. Fuzzies I don't actually want to sell. They're all 16000+ caps, haha.
---
I am! I just got a new one too, dmg increase per hit on target. It's hard to beat the DPS of my death claw gauntlet, but some heads shots from my shoty takes care of business. Like all fallout, I use the weapon for what job. Shot guns rip on miners and scorhbeast (big fat head!) I use the pump even if the combat shot gun could be better to enjoy the sweet sounds of it
---
Have you unlocked the backpack through the quest line.
---
How much of a boost is the lead backpack? I have capacity, refrigerator, and ammo so far ( I grind a lot) and am on 4th token. Trying to decide if I want the rad resistance since I need it with bloody build or if I should get that right vision camera lense for the cool factor
---
Would be so amusing if your character could use this ability.
---
I currently do. Nothing immersive about growing my plants in an enclosed warehouse though.
---
This type of item ID is different from a ‚Äúunique item id‚Äù. 
---
A unique item ID is used to track 1 specific entity of a item, for instance joe has a hammer with a chip in it, that ID will always identify Joe‚Äôs hammer with a chip in it, and will never be confused with Tom‚Äôs identical hammer, that also has a chip in it, because both hammers have a unique id.
---
A item ID is used to identify a type of gun (notice type and not specific entity). So if bloodied handmades with explosive have an item id of 420, and someone has 5 of them, then their inventory would list a quantity of 5 of the item ID 420. Yet these IDs‚Äô would not help distinguish which or those 5 is the original, or if any of them are.
---
Most game databases have item ID, but most do not have unique item ID, and typically the ones that don‚Äôt have unique item ID are games which have huge amounts of objects and items within their worlds, and unique ids were not included for the sake of database optimization.
---
Please share!
---
I use to accept all team invites. Then I joined someone and they built flame thrower traps on my camp as a way to destroy my stuff without consequence. And now I'm weary

She was referencing the ego mania of men in our culture more than the video game thing specifically.

This coming from a male.

Everyone who has interacted with me via Mic has been sound. Even been playing Elder Scrolls with some I've met on 76. In my experience griefers are usually silent or send shitty messages over Xbox messages.
---
ah the mystery meat shack.... good times.
---
Have you done the pioneer scout quest to unlock the backpack? If not you need to do that as the atom shop ones are only skins
---
yeah that'd look sick, doubt it'd clip either so shouldn't be too hard to implement
---
We were supposed to be able to connect upper floors to foundations, amongst various other changes coming to C.A.M.P.s that are yet to materialise. I also tried to remove an upper floor piece the other day and some electronic nanny keeps telling me part of the structure would be inaccessible, Bethesda need to give us more freedom so we can create with freedom...
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to create a cow shed for your Brahman? If only Bethesda would allow it, like putting stairs into the ground, walls that stand without foundation pieces...
---
I might be using the term bloody as slang.  I‚Äôm not referring necessarily to Bloody the legendary prefix.  More so I‚Äôm referring to it as a low health build.  I suppose the proper term would be Low health Adrenaline Reaction/nerd rage builds are the issue.  As I agree Bloody isn‚Äôt much more powerful than Anti Armor as far as prefixes go.  My main is a heavy gunner as well and I love him. Nothing is difficult with his build.   I don‚Äôt want him nerfed either, but it‚Äôs the clear all around top spec when it comes to sustained damage.  Low health melee and Vats Crit auto guns are very situational spike damage.
---
Toot--Toot
---
Yeah, I've never figured it out either.  I'll see situations where she stays grounded, or comes down a single lap after flying up, but in VATS, I don't necessarily see anything special about the wings being damaged.
---
I see people trying to sell water at their camps.  Water.  I get selling them to vendors, but I‚Äôm always in possession of like 35 of them at any point in time.
---
Alot of people don't get this, at this point I barely notice who even has sentinal, they all go down just as quick.
---
I can't even find tamables at my spots at all. Every kind of event or nothing but never a tamable.
---
You guys know the Possum musician challenge is broken? At least is doesn't recognize  the Snare drum or any instrument at the rusty pick? played them and i have the challenge tracked, double checked and yep - Borked. :(
---
I still buy that the system has a way of skewing drops to your account or character's inventory.  Explosive weapons were truly uncommon for me until I was able to trade/buy a bunch of pieces quite recently.  In the past 2 weeks or so I've gotten 5 explosive legendary weapons, 3 drops, 2 from the Purveyor.  That's more than the measley 4 I ever got in game from beta till I got a hold of explosive weapons.
---
Seeing certain prefixes and also 25% faster fire rate show up for me more often now.  Not everyone buys this but I'm rolling with it until I'm proven otherwise.
---
I've sent out "team" invites for three reasons. In order of likelyhood. 
---
1) You're sitting on top of a spot I'm trying to fast travel to and it's accidental, because the interface for the map is fucking garbage. (95%, currently)
---
2) early game, you were sitting on a spot I couldn't afford to get to and wanted a free ride (0% currently). 
---
3) I'm sitting at a free range/awol armaments/campfire tails/other legitimately good event and want other people to get on the action.  (5%).
---
Maybe.  I'm on XBox.  I decided to try that first before moving my camp and was surprised that it worked.  At the time, I wasn't sure how the camp spawning worked, whether it was connected to the C.A.M.P. or not.
---
If the storms don't take me out in Oklahoma I'll be on around 8:30-9 central time. I can rain some hurt on a Wendingo if you need a hand (Heavy Gunner build).

My camp is just foundations crafting benches turrets and my vending machine, no walls no roof no nothin. Come at me
---
-_-. Welp, I guess I know where I'm server hopping. I need me a legendary bear kill.
---
I did 13 badges in two days. And i have been told by random dataminer that it is 25% so i guess it is.
---
I tried haha
---
I was in Watoga checking out a guys camp and out of nowhere 2 scorchbeasts appear and start blowing shit up.  Then come the radscorpions.  I fixed several turrets!!!   The camp was a mess so I did what I could and bought several things to help out.
---
She seems surprised to see you there
---
How did you get to be a Possum Scout without doing a revival?
---
And I should be on about 7 pm also.  I will look for you!
---
Sounds nice, I haven't come across one and f those yet, but I love the bonus damage from the puncturing mod.
---
No, somebody enjoying PvP or playing the villain doesn't make them a troll. Why this game? The same reason you're playing it, because we enjoy the game. Maybe differently than you do but the community has been gatekeeping the player base so long. We can enjoy the game differently and still enjoy it like you do.
---
I just sell the non perishable food items for 2 caps each. Made myself a vending machine!
---
I second this. Instigating lever is just too good. It‚Äôs safe and reliable. And one with the +10% dmg while aiming is excellent for follow up shots. I used to carry around. Shortened lever with no stock with the executioner‚Äôs effect to kill off what the instigating didn‚Äôt.
---
This is all a lie lol.
---
The game does not have unique item ids at all. There is no way to track a specific entity of an item, if that item is placed in an inventory with another item of the same type and legendary effects, it cannot be properly distinguished from the other. 
---
This can be observed when you have two of the exact same item in your inventory and try to trade one to a friend. Often you will notice that instead of the item you marked for trade, actually being the item traded, the other identical counterpart of that item will be traded instead, even though the other was marked for trade, and even if the items have different mods and condition. This is because the database system cannot distinguish between the two and sees them as the exact same item, just two of that item.
---
Robco?
---
I play both games, I'm in to try this. Will Grubs work as a lure?
---
Gotcha Thanks
---
haha Same for the most part.
---
I came to it and had first seen the "Tree House" up the hill a bit... I took out what needed to be and looked at it, and there was a Terminal, which controlled the "Lure" *(I think it said?)*. Not having a clue what it'd do or what it was related to, I enabled it. 
---
A moment later I hear a woman's scream, which did invoke a genuine "WTF" moment before my inner-Sherlock Holmes deduced that it was part of what I just turned on via that computer. I concluded that it was set up to scare folk off, and/or part of a Halloween gag.
---
With that mindset... I made my way down to the cabins and looked for loot. Checked out the Guest Book entries as it was on my way, didn't make much note of the crazy ones towards the end. On my way to my first cabin I heard the rumble, and could've sworn I saw stuff shaking as well, but admittedly was strafing a little and didn't have the cabin in full view.
---
Had just about messaged my friend to say "Cool! There are Earthquakes in 76!" when, once again, it all clicked. It was all rigged to do this. Cute, but I was more hoping for there being earthquake events lol  
---
Making my way to other cabins and reading notes/terminals, things made sense. Though I never did experience the spinning picture!
---
That was kinda what I was getting at.  The game ID for items changes anytime someone alters the item.  Having a seperate ID to track that items origins isn't going to change that the game ID is still there, and I'm pretty sure that if you had unique ID's for items (even just for legendary items) the game would probably set fire to your gaming system...
---
That or evolve into skynet, mail all the players a package containing a monkey with a revolver, and have that monkey trained to shoot your gaming system and maybe you with said revolver... honestly, I put nothing past Beth at this point.  Fo76 has already blown past all the limits of my imagination in terms of things they can break lol.
---
You never know what happens next dame scorched
---
I fast traveled to a base and apparently spawned in two scorchbeasts and a moth man. There was very little left of this guy's base by the time we were done, and I ended up repairing whatever I saw that was damaged. 
---
My base is right at the end of a Free Range event and I know it can take a beating. It would be nice to be able to thank people who take the time to fix things up.
---
r/bearinnovations
---
There is a black backpack skin in the atom shop, it shows a shovel strapped to the side and was pretty cheap.
---
Fast travel is meant to be a small caps sink
---
Player vending is meant to be a cap sink
---
Encryptid is meant to be a large cap sink
---
I don't think we need too many more
---
Yeah thats one thing i want to point out. I mean if there are at least a few doables without endless server hopping in a fair amount of time - that would be a small step forward.
---
Fossil, there is one on the hill across from the sunny top train station you can take a picture of, up the hill against the cliff.  I think I wore the crumpled fedora, when I collected bones, any seemed to work.  
---
Complete the event at the Morgantown airport to get the cargo bot picture at the end.  It will hover right in range.  Bonus, grab the hotdogs off of the grill next the the picnic table while you‚Äôre there.
---
Something has also reverted regarding the range in which you get crippled by explosive shotguns. Prior to the first TSE nerf, you would get crippled/dead frequently with explosive shotguns. Then after the TSE Nerf and the buff to Fireproof, it was more playable and you'd only get crippled if it was a REALLY close shot. When they "re-fixed" explosive shotguns the other week, it went back to crippling all the f**king time like Pre-TSE nerf, even with Fireproof2 and Dense chest. Adamantium Skeleton 3 is pretty much required now and it sucks. They reverted (or bugged) something with the range in which you get crippled, at least in my experience.
---
I also agree the range is ridiculous. To be at optimal damage range you need to be right up in the targets face, which synergizes amazingly with getting crippled (even with a Combat Shotgun modded for max range)!
---
Effective max damage range needs to be increase 50-100% and/or explosive to cripple range needs to be increased.
---
If it wasn't for Enforcer, Shotguns would be one of the worst weapons in the game right now.
---
VATS shotgunning is better, but... after this last re-fix it seems I am SOMETIMES missing repeadidly with 95% accuracy. I get missing 1 or 2 shots due to RNG but sometimes I fire off 5-6 shots and they all completely MISS. That's some XCom 1 sh*t right there!
---
Also there seems to be a 15 badges cap (that's second hand info but could be relevant)
---
First video I ever saw of someone kill the queen, yes other people were their but it was a guy with nothing but a Bloodied Grog Axe in Power Armor who basically did 99% of the damage, that just ran up crouched under the queen when she landed and did like a 6th of its health a swing, killed it in like 34 seconds. (sneak attacks + sneak criticals and a few chems = you can achieve damage close to like 20K a swing if not higher)
---
Absolutely. Grab rifleman or commando (depending on if it‚Äôs semi or full Auto) and demo expert on top of that to maximize damage.
---
Also I‚Äôm jealous lol TSE Railway is a great roll
---
I know that the service rifle mod for FO4 fix that for that particular weapon. So it's obvious a pretty easy fox that is doable but we all know that Bethesda isn't exactly keen on quick easy fixes.
---
Shhhhhhhh lol don't give them more ideas like they already had lately.
---
If you prefer to use the rolling pin as a weapon, you want to swap out some of those gun perks for melee.  But I love your build in that it's an RP heavy build.  Makes me want to continue with my Wasteland Doctor build.
---
Nuke me please.. (really)
---
That is awesome.. I love the flux collecting. 
---
Remember guys it normally costs just 40-140 caps to move your base to the same location and all is good.
---
"Farplace"
---
Also if your base is in a nuke zone you'll have SO many people buying (of course if your prices are good).
---
You can't ask for a better "Come here" than a Nuking.
---
I made about 20k caps in the last blast I was in.
---
... that's fair. ‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú)
---
Real shame stairs decide if 2nd floor is supported or not, hope they remove that restriction because most players have marsupial.
---
Ah see y'all takin ah gander at me. I'll tell y'hwat, Imma buttah ya bread, han'sum. Yuh'll be squealin like'uh potbellay pig! Sq'wee! Sq'wee!
---
*gets well tuned on banjo*
---
Yeah, I figured it out... science you have to have exact perk cards on, no more, no less
---
1. Troops are way higher lv/ If you're used to seeing a troop lv in one location it might be wayyyy higher \[From experience\] 
---
2. People are as friendly or as rude as in normal mode, some people might just walk beside you and leave you be \[Mostly train stations\]
---
3. You can only fast travel to train stations/ Camp/ and the vault
---
4. You lose ALL junk when you die be sure to always store it
---
5. You lose SOME meds be sure to to run around with 20 Stimpaks
---
6. Thats pretty much it +20% XP \[Stacks\]
---
Buddy has told me the same thing, launched a nuke once and a group of like 2 or 3 dudes showed up with melee weapons and had the queen dead in a matter of like 20 seconds of it landing....
---
Meanwhile ranged takes like 10 dudes 20+ fucking minutes and tens of thousands of rounds of ammo to do the same thing 1-3 people can accomplish in less than a minute without using anything other than a chem or two.
---
This is awful! Had no idea this was something people could do. :(
---
Maybe a display bug. 
---
It is supossed to work, at least with full rank Class Freak. 
---
I have the mutation and also Class Freak, doesn‚Äôt feel like it is not working.
---
Easiest way I found for the cargobot is to go to the relay tower near the overseer‚Äôs camp and call in a supply drop. 9 times out of 10 it drops right by her camp across the rover. So you can just sit there and wait it out.
---
Mounts, CAMP upgrades (As in spend a large amount of caps to get 5% increases durability on all structures), and robots (like in automation DLC for fallout 4 but instead of junk it requires a hideous amount of caps) are the three things that immediately come to mind.
---
I think the issue is, things that are normally hideously expensive In MMO‚Äôs like player/ guild housing, side professions, etc are already in the game with well-implemented (imo) systems.
---
Same. I have repaired walls, generators, ect. I would like to know if other players have done the same for me. If so, I thank you.
---
It's benign at least. You get a mix of people in every game. I would be the same reaction years ago playing female characters in other games, and my wife plays lots of MMOs plus D&amp;D over voice chat so she's already way more sociable than I am. Especially after I showed her she can block people that harass her in most games.
---
I have like 14 of them from queen kills. I didn't know I had them they are in the misc tab? I have stash issues so I use my stash materials to repair items.
---
In terms of the magazines I think you have to collect like each version of it, so it‚Äôs not collect 5 magazines total etc, it‚Äôs collect version 1,2,3,4,5 etc if you get what I mean? I think that‚Äôs right...
---
Yeah, team mates can buold on your camp and the flamer destroys your stuff. So just watch out. It's only happened once, but it can happen
---
I never told you what to do. I live in the U.S also, which allows me to see your actions for what they really are.
---
I never said I don‚Äôt like women‚Äôs complaints on issues, you‚Äôre putting those words in my mouth, just trying to make me look like a woman hater or something, which seems to be your agenda in a majority of your posts.
---
Look you clearly have deep seeded hate issues with men, I get it, but no one wants to hear your men hate speech in every post you decide to delve your opinion in.
---
This forum is for fallout 76, if you want to hate on men, there is likely a subreddit for that.
---
I'll have to try that. I thought you could only do a repair all from the camp interface. Which never works for mine.
---
You could play this just like a single player fallout, if you wish. Everything but the biggest boss can be soloed. 
---
People are generally good. Either they ignore you completely or are friendly. Most of the asshats have been shunted off to their own servers to play with each other on even ground- which of course they hate.
---
*Todd will make it legal.*

maybe the game had issues with the stairs as the house was floating!!! tee hee..
---
Backpacker: There are fixed spawns for hotdogs. One of them's on a grill next to a crashed plane in Morgantown airport.
---
Chemist: The plasma grenade plan isn't in the same drop list as the other energy grenades and mines, which is probably a bug. Finding the plan will be somewhere between extremely unlikely and impossible.
---
Photographer: Shoot the engines, hope it floats close enough? I haven't tried yet.
---
Roboticist: Random spawn only. Armor plan (not mod plan) spawns in the Savage Divide and Mire should be the best bet, but I only know two of those.
---
Cook: Have you checked the Whitesprings cooking vendors? I thought at least one of those was there.
---
*  Not to mention if I don't name the chassis I have to pull them out one by one till I find the one I need. 
---
then just name them instead of being lazy.
---
Kind of what i think - the way they do that is way to obvious. And it's not that there is no other way to get what they want. I mean if they nuke us with Atom Shop stuff, reasonable priced, i think many of us will jump on.
---
I hope when they fix this is also fixes the vats bug where you're seeing a hit chance of 95% but ten hits in a row do zero damage both melee and ranged.
---
I keep one for a free fast travel when encumbered. If you find yourself in the middle of nowhere and too burdened to walk- take a drink. Can't make it any worse, and just might put you closer to a craft station or stash.

Picturing a bunch of gangly ass 8ft people in sneakers trying to punch a opossum is making it impossible to take your issue seriously...

They have been there for like 2-3 weeks.. nobody else I have talked to has them..
---
Also why is my previous reply downvoted ? SMH
---
&gt;...happy shopkeeper 'porting in and chasing me around with another heart above their head or a gift emote and a stack of toasters...

What If I just 'port in, put on my civil war suit and bowler hat, and go play the piano?
---
I just got the tadpole pack. It gives me +30 carry weight but the skin with the shovel gave me +40.
---
Reading is pretty tough.
---
Referring back to my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpdroo/dear_bethesda_please_add_wallpapers/entli62/) about Wallpapers coming to the Atom Shop, I never actually posted them, so let me fix that for you!, Here you **[go](https://imgur.com/a/QzhRA8v)**!

None of the existing sinks are large enough to balance out the 1,400 caps per day from selling to robots, and additional caps from events, stashes, and enemies. 
---
Consider, to be in balance, you would have to: 
---
* Host the Encryptid 7 times a day every day
---
* Buy 14,000 caps worth of player gear every day... that's not even possible to sustain. 
---
Are you doing your part?
---
Yes I can read, and you can clearly observe in how I articulate my posts that I am educated enough to realize what she was referencing.
---
But just imagine you said that exact same type of reply to her, merely trying to enlighten someone, and she turns it around and says you‚Äôre preaching your egotistical man speech on her just because she‚Äôs a female, when in fact that‚Äôs not the case at all and she has no grounds to jump to that assumption.
---
That is the point I‚Äôm trying to make.
---
Just wait for a while, they'll make up for it with upcoming challenges. "Take a picture of a naked and intoxicated player taking picture with their crocodile leather 105mm camera while in the nukezone with a yao-guai high-fiving a scorchbeast queen in the background, 10 atoms"
---
That crunchy, grittyness paired with the pungeunt juicy popping of detergent... ahh, heaven.
---
Not always legendary fyi and levels to player.
---
I highly doubt it, their prevalence yes but if this were the case Instigating and Bloodied would have also been nerfed into the ground by that logic.
---
Bethesda is just doing what many developers do, and that's cater to the loudest crowd bitching, chances are they looked at two things...
---
Dudes who probably ran radrage builds getting salty their getting OHK'd like its a good idea to try and fight another player when you have 30HP complaining what's killing them is too strong
---
Bethesda looking at statistics and seeing that like 98% of the people over lvl 50 have at least one weapon with Explosive in their inventory that is constantly being used
---
My issue with the nerfs is how seemingly little thought went into them, their was zero foresight into the underline things of the game. Demolition Expert for example was not too strong and should have stayed a 100% buff, I mean FFS its a 5 rank perk, that change alone kind of killed all the explosive ranged weapons as they basically all received a 40% nerf with no way of getting that damage back and its not like people were ever complaining about the Missile Launcher or Fat Man being OP because these weapons ammo weighed so damn much no one ever used the fucking things, it just wasn't worth it.
---
So now were left with OP melee, and everyone who uses ranged is still out their able to insta kill everyone else because we've all moved onto Anti-Armor Explosive weapons. It might not be a OHK all the time now but what difference does it make if its so fast you can't react?
---
Wow yeah that's rough, never seen it that bad. Usually it's just in the distance for me, or right by me and goes away pretty fast
---
Ugh, is it the wendigo cave one again?  Spent hours last time and didn't get it, not gonna bother this time.
---
No mutants is a first trait so is bolstering and vanguards
---
People like you make other people quit the game, because most people don't want to deal with the type of evil, soulless bullshit you want more of, in their very limited recreational free time.   
---
If you want to play RUST, go play fucking rust.   
---
The reality is, yeah, you always had evil choices in earlier fallouts. But no matter what, you \_won\_ in earlier fallouts. It didn't matter what path you took, you'd be the victor, you'd play the game, you'd have a good time.   
---
What you want makes it a good time for the sociopathic evil sacks of shit who probably  have dead puppies in their basements, and  a \_shitty\_ experience for fucking \_everyone else\_.
---
Yep I sell Bleedout syringers all day for that challenge.
---
They did reduce the number of enemies which are tameable in a recent patch.
---
This is viable from ground level, and I can see this in several places around the map! Sometimes it's worse and its glowing like the floor is made of lava or uranium!
---
My caps sink is buying stuff out of player machines. I don't need another caps sink. If they put a fucking dungeon behind a goddamn paywall over this "complaint" I'm gonna lol
---
He said the three effects though.
---
Instigating gauss is good for the play style you‚Äôve described. I use one with 3x max rifleman, max bloody mess, max covert op and tank killer. Hits for around 1200+. It‚Äôs personal preference though, what I enjoy you may not lol.
---
Have you tried using the stairs with the frame? I was having the same issue but was able to make a nice two story building with those stairs on the inside. Wish they had ladders though, or stairs that didnt snap dead center of the floor. Stairs against the wall would be nice.
---
I have a Mutants-LifeSaving and +1 str on my scout left arm. It‚Äôs not perfect but it definitely works well with my build.
---
I would eventualy buy atoms just to suport them, but they give me reasons for not wanting to do so.
---
That would be a good idea.
---
Also make it easyer to skip down faster on the lists or search for an specific item. If you got 25 weapons and tons of different Chems, it sucks to search the things
---
Who to trust? If I, lvl 142, come across anyone under lvl 50 in a nuke zone or elsewhere, I almost always split my water, stims and rad away with them!(maybe exaggerating a tad).... Theyre happy cuz they just got loads of free unexpected shit. Youre happy because you freed some weight and maybe made someone else's session. Try it sometime. This game is full of benevolent minds.
---
Really? Because I‚Äôm always hungry.
---
If you‚Äôre stealthing, I can make you a fixer. And on Xbox.
---
Currently still working for me, went from Sloth to Mongrel to Sloth. I did notice that the tame option only appeared when within melee range.
---
Different tiers of armor, possibly you're comparing light or medium tier against heavy?  
---
In Fo4 it would specify, but should still be able to tell via the item weight.
---
I lost my favorite gatling gun a couple weeks ago. Due to the prevalence of disappearing items I am compulsively checking my favorites and inventory. This should not be possible especially in a game where nothing will be replaced. I'm not saying I want them to replace missing items just make it impossible for things to go missing in the first place.
---
I've been asking for this for a while, because it could also work with all helmets like the combat armour ones and even bandanas
---
I think they used region because of the PR backlash they got when the burrows launched by calling it a dungeon.  I‚Äôd expect a very similar sized underground area as the burrows.  However, there will be an event in it.
---
I'm not an English native speaker. But thanks.
---
Some of the things that I always added with mods in FO4 is the Weight/Value option and the total weight option. It‚Äôs really helpful to realize that some of the lighter things quickly add up
---
Good linküëç
---
Yes! I agree!
---
Sry
---
Is this new? I had one snapped to a brick wall a few months ago and it was working.
---
Sorry. I sounded mean
---
I got this nice fancy bottled stuff here, or you can go out back and drink from the hose like a savage.
---
I just want stairs to work like fallout 4.
---
I've heard this, but just assumed it was wrong gonna have to try it now
---
Thank you VynilicPumaGaming! 
---
Very cool!
---
I'm just hyped for content. Idc if its BR
---
I‚Äôm dealing really ok with hunger and thirst;
---
Neither. It's a roll every time the weapon loses condition. Shotguns probably proc more often because they lose condition for each pellet that hits.
---
Automatic weapons do have a slightly lower chance per hit, 0.3% compared to 0.4% for semiauto weapons. Miniguns and Gatling Lasers have an even lower chance of 0.2%.
---
The condition gained from a proc is 25/50/75 times the condition lost for a hit, so the gain per perk point is similar to Gunsmith but more random. It doesn't stack well with Gunsmith.
---
Same with all melee!
---
That's what... 7 accounts with 5 characters each?
---
Pacify?
---
Awesome grab
---
I wore the Silver Shroud atomic shop fedora and that worked.
---
There's fossils all over, one in the toxic valley iirc.
---
Hot dogs drop in very specific places. Forget where off the top of my head, but you can google it.
---
Blackberry honey crisp needs the \*aid\* version of royal jelly, not the \*junk\* version that spawns in honey bees. And exactly TWO spawn once a day, one's at the top of Tanagra town, go to the building at the top and use marsupial to jump \*up\* one floor, look in the bathtub. The other one spawns at Middle Mountain cabins in a picnic basket behind one of the houses. Oh youre probably asking about the recipes, I think you can buy it at the shop in the whitesprings.
---
Roboticist robot plans are an extremely rare drop, I have chest and arms but no legs, after 500 hours.
---
Please tell me you clicked seek revenge and hounded him his entire session !
---
\&gt; I really believe this small Bethesda group supports griefers. 
---
I so agree.. So many of the "changes" were what created all the pvp issues that had to be fixed.
---
Marine and combat are pretty common drops for me. Unfortunately they are usually 1* or junk effects on heavy pieces. Where are you getting most of your legendary drops?
---
Same. I just got a bloodied explosive laser rifle. It lasts for about 4 or 5 clips at 200%. Its light so I usually carry it around for emergencies its ridiculous how fragile it is.
---
Ok guys unpopular opinion here!!! I think that the game this sub is named after, and is filled with people who really like the game, is actually a pretty good game!
---
Upboats to the left xdxd
---
I ran a 1\* AA gat forever due to the amount of damage it does. Wait until you get a 3\* AAE gatling gun. After all the crap 3\* pistols and black powder junkers I've picked up from the Holy Molie Lady she finally blessed me with a God gun last week. 
---
I have killed myself twice with it but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it.
---
Yikes, Sentinel Assassin?
---
Go with Vanguard. The nerf makes Sentinel paper.
---
Glad you got some wood
---
SO RIGHT.
---
3 star but you can't see what the 3 star are...
---
Go for it, the worst that can happen is you lose all your junk and a bunch of money. What's not to like about that.
---
I am mostly a solo player so the chances of me taking pictures of other players in a specific outfit and at a specific location is next to impossible.  It is aggravating that I miss out on so many Atoms.  I am not going to squad with people just to take a picture because that is incredibly stupid.
---
If they want to continue adding camera challenges, they should make them more feasible to complete.  For example, sometimes there is a challenge to take a picture of a Deathclaw.  That is much easier than having to lure a Mutant Hound all the way to a Behemoth for a picture.  Assuming none of them disappear.
---
I have a very fine Plan: Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip for sale in my high end vending machine for 23456 caps.
---
Did you connect power?
---
It was the same for me until I disconnected and reconnected the power line from my generator.
---
You have committed a thought crime. Off to the Gulag with you, fascist.
---
And along with that, can we please help the plants resolve their personal space issues?
---
I'd really like to be able to plant stuff and not have to worry about all my Razorgrain screaming "He's touching me, he's touching me!" or my melon patch requiring me to give it a different zip code before I can plant it.
---
Yes, I agree, low health glass cannon builds need to have some competition. I don't think they need to specifically be nerfed, I think alternatives need to be made. Nothing needs to do as much damage as glass cannon low hp builds, that's the point of them, extreme damage at higher risk. As it stands, though, nothing really even competes damage wise. They should have a mutation that increases damage at max hp, but have it do half what adrenal reaction does. It'd also have to work like herbivore/carnivore in that if you get one you can't get the other. That would give non-bloodied builds more viability without compromising the glass cannon risk idea behind bloodied. It'd also have its own drawback in that if you drop below max hp you immediately have to stimpack to get your damage bonus back. Smaller drawback, smaller gain.
---
Do yiu get paid in scrip or caps?
---
same thing just happened to me. Nothing funky, repairing the pipes just doesn't do shet. This game...
---
If this falls apart.. I can help tonight too.. lvl 199
---
"FarPlace" PC
---
I'm avalible rn
---
Still better than a drill or syringer, at least you can scrip that if you didn't max for the day. I'd recommend rolling armor first that way you can scrip 3* wood pieces before you change or leave the server so you at least recover most of the scrip.
---
I still use my trusty combat shotgun.  I have Enforcer equipped and I use it to kneecap mobs then finish them off with a melee weapon to save ammo.  Shotguns are quite effective on ghouls.
---
You bought a skin for the backpack not a backpack. You have to finish the Tadpole mission to get one.
---
I was always thirsty rarely hungry even at max rank, then again I sprint everywhere
---
List all your weapons and gear we will tell u yes is no
---
Can't do damage past 72? In what world.
---
I had a Player so far away that I needed my Long Range NV scope just to get them "rez", If I took a step back, they de-rezed.  Yet due to Skeet Shooter, I got killed at that range due to the grouping the shots had little spread and I got hit by multiple explosive pellets.
---
I just read up on the Whitespring Mafia.  That is hilarious - they are going to come and bug you if you don't pay them, like a little kid teasing on the playground.  I wish I was on Xbox to see them in "action."
---
Not true, proved it to some guy saying the same thing on YouTube. Decked myself up with all non legendaries and let him keep his, still won. Only difference was our builds and him having legendaries
---
I don't know. I collect people's crops and often then repair some, too. Im nor particularly intrested in that much of attention.
---
A shop register is a good idea. Especially if it had the like a caps/day measurement and other stats.
---
Should just be an entry in the personal terminal that‚Äôs free in the atom shop now
---
How did you get in there
---
Invest in perception to hunt, charisma to sell, and endurance for food benefits
---
If you're on PC, the Better Inventory mod does just that.
---
Sbq drops 3 when killed
---
Get the recipe for S'mores and make and sell them. You need to eat 3 for a badge, the recipe is a random drop and is rather complicated for s'mores. (Brahmin milk, razorgrain flour, spice, bone, syrup, sugar, wood)
---
It'd take a bit of work, but then as a chef, you'll know that a good recipe is worth the effort.
---
As others have said, make the lemonades too if you can find recipes. 
---
Keep a basic supply of meats and soups. Glowing steak for melee players, corn soup for VATS players ( increased perception) 
---
Make a variety of drinks from Biv. People do daily challenges and if the drink is readily available from a vendor rather than having to make it and wait for it to ferment, that could be useful.
---
This should have been ready at player vending launch.
---
also shows you stack weight. 
---

---
Get a Gauss Rifle of some kind. It costs more to run but it does a lot of damage
---
Imagine all the prank buzzin with Stealth Boys lol
---
Glowing steaks were selling for about 10 bucks apiece with bargain hunter before I did a respec to luck.
---
Just wait for the 
---
"Well if you weren't using..."
---
"Well if you didn't have..."
---
"How?"
---
Keep your original melee guy as I‚Äôm sure he had high strength and switch cards over to heavy gunner
---
I like THAT. A lot!
---
WHAT'S THAT SOUND
---
Ohhhh. It's just my treads.
---
I lost my level 50 Fixer. Vanished from inventory, and I had it equipped at the time. So I bought another from a vendor, and that went missing too. Then today it reappeared but using exactly the same name I've given to a lever rifle. Except the Fixer's now level 20.  If I change the name, the lever rifle changes as well. None of this makes any sense at all.
---
We have cap sinks, you‚Äôre just a no lifer paying Xbox all day. You have more caps than 99% of the players. How are they going to cater a cap sink to someone with a million caps? How many alts do you have to run all day to get that? It‚Äôs silly, don‚Äôt you understand that you‚Äôre not paying the game the same way most people are?
---
I do, yes. Now it takes 5x the shots to kill anything.
---
Bugs like this and bugs like the 3 starred wood armor should be looked into and resolved immediately. They shouldn't be allowed to carry on as they have.
---
There is one West of Vault 51 - it has one of the sensors for the Environmental Quest you get for being in the Forest.
---
Has Corn, Grain, Black Berries, a safe and armor workbench are in a Barn, there is a Tent and some other items on top of the ledge by it also.
---
That's not a PSA, that's just random useless info. Some sell for much higher than the listed price, some for much lower and even more right at it.
---
I got my 4/4 in sheepsquatch events; thought I got one in water but I was wrong - that one never got ticked off. Got Athlete, Archer, and Mammalogist for my three badges.
---
This is my problem with random team-ups. My character is kind of built for solo and I don't have many team perks that would make up for the difference.
---
Real gamer hours. Respect.
---
A "buy this gun get 200 rounds for it free" deal would be amazing.
---
Ok sorry
---
Mutants and life-saving are both primary effects, can‚Äôthave both on the same piece
---
I'm not even Level 200 yet but I feel like I play this game way too much.  If you got 405 levels out of it, I'm not surprised that you're bored.  Take a break!  :-)
---
I agree wholeheartedly. What is the point in playing if hard earned things can just vanish.
---
Brool Story Co.
---
Lmao so true.
---
I have this issue also. When it pops up lower the quantity you are trying to buy and it should go through. I had to buy 40 bulk acid one at a time because the machine wouldn't let me by them all at once.
---
I would love a prefab bunker (like the free-states)
---
Took me a while to actually figure out where it was when I got that plan
---
Check out the YouTuber Jug for some good building tips &amp; inspiration. He has fo4 and 76 builds up. Including how to do rounded walls. Cheers!
---
My base has been in the same spot for four months. Since they patched the campfire I won't be moving anything. 
---
I built a cooking station next to the wall most people get stuck in. If they can't figure that out then they can wait for Bethesda to fix this.
---
It seems pretty easy for them to fix. They just have to attach the fast-travel point to the vendor machines and don't let the machines place on half-sized floors.
---
I had a ~~mad scientist lair~~ medical center for a bit. I sold chems cheaply, antibiotics at a very fair price, and even home-brewed spirits to help ease the pain of living in a post-apocalyptic world. Of course the Addictol was sold for a premium, but if you want to play a losing game you must one day pay up.
---
Sorry for misinformation , browsing Reddit at work and must‚Äôve confused two pieces or something I‚Äôll edit with the proper stats when I get home and check it.
---
&gt; can't figure out how to put some dirt in a planter.
---
They can also craft advanced weapons, power armor, and fusion cores. But can't scrap useless ammo to use the materials for useful ammo.
---
It is all about DPS. The minigun does less damage because it puts a lot more lead down range quicker then the gatling gun. Have you ever used a gatling gun? Those things are slow as fuck to fire. If the minigun did the same damage as the gatling gun, it would be extremely good. It is all about trying to balance the weapons so they perform on a somewhat equal playing field in regards to the DPS. Melee happens to have the highest dps, and I believe it is rightfully so. As an unarmed build, I have to give up a lot of damage resistance so I can run my build, especially in nuke zones.
---
Before the TSE nerf, my TSE Pump did 1,076 damage. One-shot Super Mutant Overlords and Sentry Guns, two-shot Scorchbeasts.
---
It was *marvelous*.
---
&gt;Bethesda allow to stack, yet you can't with ranged weapons, be that heavy guns or rifles.
---
This is why we say it's an unfair advantage. Nerfing us but not Melee.. This is the source of all the pvp issues.. they are still there it's just that with the survival serer the
---
Can't say I've seen that one. Persistent? I often miss things that pop up but usually catch persistent stuff after a few hours.
---
You realize that it will turn into 1 star right
---
Preach!
---
We need an ammo breakdown/recraft bench of some sort.
---
Maybe you can use it to fix your camp next time lol
---
Sorry about that.
---
I have 6 purifers, 3 outside for all to use, 3 inside that are locked, that way I always know I have some at hand if needed for diluting stims or making adhesive, while also making sure that other players have it on hand too (plus the plants to make adhesive are out in the open)
---
How great would it be to have this over workbenches!
---
Okay, what about just a notification that so and so entered your camp?
---
Ok, just...for reference here. You're ranting about wanting to be able to "educate people on life lessons" by murdering them in a video game. 
---
Here's some "education" for you. "Can't hack it" is a commonly used slang term that's been in use since the 1950's. 
---
Hacking, as you in your mind-numbing ignorance assume this person means, was not even a thing at that time. There were no networks to "hack". The internet wasn't a phantom of an idea in someone's minds eye. This phrase came about in roughly the same time period that "computer" still meant "a person who computes".
---
Yes. I was complaining about this yesterday while rebuilding my base. Why do the damn stairs have to be in the center and why can‚Äôt the rail extend to the gaps on either side?
---
It is for any weapon really, as it will considerably increase the DPS.
---
Nobody appreciated the addition of Wood Armor at all.
---
I very rarely accept invitations due to paranoia and a lack of mic. Still the few times I have were generally decent experiences. Someone even added some water purifiers to my camp. Recently got the trophy for befriending someone and we almost made it through a silo which was a first for both of us. Managed to to finish the revival portion of the tadpole quest because of that. Unfortunately they later died too far away from to revive while my game then crashed a few minutes later.
---
Pfft I drink straight from irradiated ground puddles.
---
L84 w/ 15 STR, motion assist servos (+2 STR) , bloody mess3, martial artist3, glow sight 3, incisor 3, gladiator1, tenderizer1.
---
Tpyically do not use melee damage increasing food, bobbleheads, or magazines.
---
For me:
---
AA grognak does 184, but is too slow for more than a couple of enemies at a time.
---
Plain fire axe does 114.  
---
Blade of bastet does about 150, black diamond, meathook (extra hook) , barbed pole hook about the same.
---
Furious deathclaw gauntlet and vampire mole miner gauntlet also deal triple digit damage 
---
( &gt; 175 &lt; 200 )  but I'm overweight, can't use them in PA.
---
 I prefer faster weapons.  
---
I carried a 1\* L20 serrated vampire machete for about 20 levels, supplanted by a death tambo.  
---
Switched to a L45 cultist dagger.
---
Goto at the moment is a L50 serrated vampire switchblade.
---
and I recently discovered the joys of Exterminator when dealing with mirelucks.
---
It is a fight, but that little switchblade is quite capable of taking out a Legendary sheepsquatch.  Has also taken down a L91 deathclaw.
---
Well you could start a new character and roll it up differently...
---
as a trans female (with a high passable voice) i can feel your pain sista
---
Your best bet if you can get it for your build would be an Instigating Explosive Lever Action.
---
And as a programmer, do you appreciate people sending you "just do this" instructions in ALL CAPS?
---
And do you respect these instructions as coming from people who understand what you do?
---
Or are they assuming dicks?
---
No offense, but you're not really much of a programmer if you don't understand what a non-trivial problem is, are you?
---
Also, you're an arrogant, agressive dickhead.
---
Need me to put that in caps?
---
Hmm well i don't know. There's definitely something wrong though

---
&gt; Remember though that the budget increases for every levelup
---
Seriously? Today I learned.
---
If you have to load in, probably not.  If you mean a "cave" like those that run under the road near Watoga, then I would say yes.
---
Good idea!
---
Always check the misc stuff... Gun powder and whatnot can be quickly stock up and use a lot of precious loot space
---
^this
---
Yep same issue
---
Agreed. I don't actually have *any* team perks that would help. All I have for Charisma is Lone Wanderer, Travel Agent, and Hard Bargain.
---
VATs melee sometimes just doesn't work on any enemy - not just flying. It happens to me with low level scorch, too. It's mightily frustrating - it's like, ok, guess we're doing this battle VATsless ::shrug::  
---
It's also not just initial melee attacks - it's definitely any swing may result in hitSOUND but no appreciable damage to the enemy. I can tell you this if it helps - the only melee weapon I've been using has been a ski sword, usually modded for armor penetration.
---
People like this are banned from online games, but these are the kind of people who have multiple accounts. Makes it hard to catch all of them. 
---
Yes, it is illegal and goes against the Terms of Service, but the most players can do it report these kinds of players... or flat out start posting their usernames here on Reddit. 
---
If you start calling them out by name, others can help jump on the report wagon, then it would be easier for Bethesda to start investigating.
---
Pretty sure its randomized. One of the starting points is right next to the crashed plane
---
Did you abandon explosive shotguns after the last rebalance?
---
Yep. Want to sell some 3* stuff but dont want it taking up slots if it wont sell if Im not hanging around my camp. Ive got things to do, creatures to kill.
---
It should call in the strike, but I wonder if the strike will actually do damage underground- I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôd hit the ground above and do no damage underground.
---
Shit my bad I‚Äôll hush
---
It will sell well - put it in your vending machine for 25,000 caps!
---
It should have been ready at game launch, honestly. Not being able to sell ammo to vendors was never a good idea.
---
There's going to be a massive amount of camp damage from monster spawns on fast travel. I'm all for it
---
If you rebuild the pack the level 50 Standard one will carry 60. The one that i got as a reward for finishing the Tadpole Quest was level 20 and had 30 carry weight.
---
The high Capacity is currently bugged. If you can find someone who is willing to rent it to you for a small fee (i paid 1k caps) you'll automatically "learn" it upon possession. Then you can mod your backpack in a workbench and then return the plan. :)
---
Yeah I thought explosive was a secondary prefix. If they have a 1* explosive, then they have the rarest weapon in Fo76.
---
Sentinel Assassin lol
---
Gonna try this!
---
Honestly kind of fine with the STASH size currently. Would rather they focus on gun bugs and refine the game more than improve quality of life. The Gatling Plasma bugs are long overdue for fixing. Played in beta with the 400 Stash so got used to keeping it down. Manage to keep my stash at 500-600 for the most part now

Both battered fedora and white wolf fedora work for collecting bones. I've heard that the crumpled fedora doesn't work but I didn't try because I didn't want to risk it. FT to the Whitespring service entrance and there's more than enough bones in the dumpsters to complete this part. All the cooking recipes you need (except s'mores) can be purchased from Whitespring vendor. You already got the correct advice on royal jelly for the honey crisp. There's a single hotdog that spawns daily in the oven behind the recipe vendor in Whitespring if you don't feel like chasing other sources down. For cargobot, complete Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport. Easy to get a good pic at the end.

The ones I seen were more like little white strips with several of each plant in them and too small to stick a water pump on.

I like to repair things out in the Wasteland. Sometimes I even go a step further (and wrongly so as it turned out yesterday) I was at a camp and they had one locked room with their fusion generator and resource extractor in it and I heard a Mirelurk King in there. The little bugger had spawned in there and while it was aggroed on me it wasn't destroying the ever-living shit out of their camp.
---
So I hang out there and send a team invite to the camp owner. They decline, I wait a minute and try again and they accept. I drop the come here gesture and after a minute they arrived at camp. I stand by the door jumping up and down getting their attention and they come over and unlock the door.
---
I charge in Super-Sledge in hand, vault over the resource extractor and proceed to lay bloody waste to that evil Mirelurk King.
---
At least that was the plan, I swing three times and on the third swing it finally dawns on me that A/ the camp owner is just watching me B/ the Mirelurk King is taking no damage and C/ the Mirelurk King is not showing as aggroed.
---
I hang my head in embarrassment, compliment the owner on their cool pet (which thank fuck we can't kill anymore!!!) buy something out of guilt and head on my merry way.
---
She gave me a EE gat, which I traded for an AAE lever.  But the guy I traded with made a convincing case that the gatling is the best ranged weapon overall.
---
I thought railway was a heavy weapon and not a rifle due to size/weight. 
---
Yeah first drop from Legendary Vendor was a 3* TSE +1 AGI railway rifle
---
Appreciate you dude. üòä
---
That is a lot more fun than you think.  The struggle of finding food and ammo without Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
You might have rushed through the main story, so you can slow down and re-experience it.
---
Should pop up on the map. It spawns in various spots in the Mire. Once you find it shoot the big flower when it's open. Bring plenty of stimpacks.
---
Sorry for your loss of Elvis.
---
I would like to see a list of all possible tamable creatures and proper spawn points. Couldn't find anything updated/complete.
---
So that‚Äôs what happened to my 3* assaultron head...
---
i have a shotgun stealth build and I pretty much one shot everything, if I had a good legendary that would be even better
---
I didn‚Äôt even know you could repair bases.
---
I was walking past some dudes base last night (near the overseer camp) and saw it was under attack by dogs.
---
Helped defend the dudes base but then I heard a smashing sound. There was a dog locked inside his base trying to break out. I went inside to see if there was a way I could stop it (door was wide open) but the dog was in a locked room.
---
As I left the dog broke through his wall. I felt bad but I also didn‚Äôt want to get blamed for it so I ran away.
---
If I knew you could repair peoples walls I would have done it!
---
Like a man thong......wait what
---
no I'm on ps4 unfortunately :/
---
There is no "right way" to play this game or one single avenue that gets you the most out of the game. Play the way that you will have the most fun. If that's running around doing events and killing shit, do that. If it's farming for materials and scrap and becoming a merchant/trader, do that. If it's building unique camp structures and designs, do that. 
---
Play the way you will enjoy the most.
---
I want to go Commando!    I was referring to the perk‚Äîwhat did you think I meant?
---
I've heard the sentinel assasin combo is still the best for pvp.
---
mother of god...
---
Get Fireproof or Dense armor.
---
I'd like to know too. I've got several mules I'd like to use to grab these but I have no clue what events can drop them. My guess is that it's either the main quests in Flatwoods or Morgantown because after that, you move out of Responder territory. I seriously doubt it's any of the repeatable quests because I've done Fertil Soil, Back on Beat, Mama Dolce's, and Collision Course more times than I can count and have never gotten a uniform.
---
Ive got a vendor full of drugs, mostly because I wanted to put up a big neon sign that said ‚ÄúDRUGS!!!‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm always surprised when someone buys from it,  Hahahaha.
---
Girl it is tiresome. üíö
---
I have seen it yes.
---
The greatest end game goal is to achive is the bloodied meat hook with swing speed and +1 strength
---
Their base doesn't render until you travel to it. Happens all the time. One of my characters spawns inside the mountain side when I fast travel to my base. I've tried moving my camp machine but it hasn't fixed it.
---
The new content that‚Äôs been added since March leaves a lot to explore and a lot to do. Events are fun. I think the last few patches that added player vending and the purveyor are really cool. I run around doing events, helping people out, and exploring the spaces between locations on the map. It‚Äôs been a lot of fun for me.
---
Also u might need to unlock gunsmith perks
---
I had to remove my front porch due to this.  Now I have a perfectly placed spawn point, if you don;t move you spawn at the bottom step of my front door.  Feel free to troll people by putting a mounted deathclaw head 2 feet in front of where they spawn, always a good laugh
---
Wow!  I'm level 162, have finished the main questline, and all but a couple of the side ones.  I still love playing the game and kind of dread the day that I log in and feel like you do.  I love the new content they are adding, and as long as they keep doing that I'll continue to play.  I think another thing that has kept me playing are the people I play with...we just have so much fun!  405 levels is a lot of playing time...I think if I felt like you, I'd probably take a break, play something else, let them come out with some new content then come back and see if that spark of fun comes back.  There does come a point where you're just done...good luck with whatever you decide to do!
---
My ee gat is my favorite weapon, and I have quite a few sought after legacy weapons
---
Yes Master Jug üòâ.But that stay limited.Would be better if Beth can add that F4 items.For more extended build ideas
---
Or go to bed with power armour and bed breaks
---
I believe that is accurate as that was the tactic a guy was using over in PVP.
---
You have to be able to craft a backpack in order to craft a backpack...
---
No. Not sure if you played from BETA but it was way too dark and impossible so see anything without using light from the pip boy or PA. It‚Äôs fine now. Stop making silly requests. Imagine it pitch black and then the moth man shows up to scare the shit out of you. Fun for a bit but got old real fast. Even now we cannot see the tics without vats if they attack at night
---
If they give us a brightness setting then I would be fine with that.
---
Not to mention that 3 or so of the daily challenges usually involve the camera. I get that it's new, but that's a bit overboard.
---

I think stealth has been bugged for a while now, it‚Äôs much less effective than it used to be too. I shouldn‚Äôt complain though as at least it‚Äôs a little more of a challenge lol
---
Sure, I'd hate to see a dungeon gated behind a caps sink, but player vending isn't much of a cap sink since most of the caps are circulating; not leaving the economy.
---
I had a bug where if I had a Executioners Grognak Axe and an Instigsting one in my inventory, they both would reduce in durabilty even though I only used the Instigating one... but repairing one repaired both of them... it just works... üëçüèª
---
People spawn all over my camp. I spawn in the same place every time on the north border of my camp from where I placed my machine. I‚Äôve had people spawn in my floor, under the stairs... it‚Äôs annoying but I rearranged my camp so that wherever people spawn they won‚Äôt get stuck.
---
You and 900 hours guy should go on a double date, but that would require leaving the house.
---
I‚Äôm still trying to do this. I have gone from every angle suggested any help?
---
I get paid in discarded legendary wooden arms. There are no fair labour laws in the wasteland.
---
Well I have same issue in CSGO and that's because my upload speed is too slow (&lt;0.5Mbit/s) meanwhile my download is 100Mbit/s giving me solid looking experience and clean 15ping. For me it looks like all is fine but in reality my internet won't update my doings to server despite game working at pin point timing.
---
Agree wholeheartedly.
---
Don't think you're making big enough purchases then
---
You will make friends.  Join the trade subReddits but monitor the scammer blacklist and watch for a few days before you sell or buy. Try out a bloodied build.   Recognize that 1* items are often nearly as effective as their multistar siblings‚Äîespecially bloodied weapons and unyielding armor.  Get starched genes.   Get mutated anyway.  Buy serums from trade suubreddits for 300 versus thousands elsewhere.   Research and plan your build in advance‚Äîit is hard to change afterwards.
---
I accept zero random team invites - trust NO one!  Its a very easy way for people to get you into PvP, they just shoot at a friend not in the team and their friend kills you instantly right after.  Pacifist does nothing to protect you in a team.
---
If you want to meet people then get a mic and use it to chat with people.  If they seem cool enough then ask to add them as a friend and if they invite you to a team later go for it.  Its even easier now that we can fast travel to any camp with an active vendor.
---
I have Fireproof maxed out, got surround by a bunch of bugs so naturally I just started shooting the ankle biters....and I forgot explosive guns can hit you back up close, lol.
---
If mole rats are evil, then radrats are the Apollyon end of the world scenario
---
You are the edge case. Deal with it.
---
Yup, especially when your at camp crafting. They know you have your crafting perks on and would try to get you by surprise. Sorry if i don't accept team invites in adventure as i dont pvp in adventure, thats what i use survival mode for.
---
I ended up trading for an AAE Gatling Gun (which I can no longer use because it‚Äôs on my corrupted character) which absolutely rocked. I added the prime receiver and it was my main SBQ killer. With just 1 level of each of the heavy gunner perks it‚Äôs awesome plus it‚Äôs a slow shooter so it didn‚Äôt use a ton of Ultracite ammo.
---
You may want to call your local WVa OSHA rep.  That place does not look up to code.
---
I'm not sure, but if you were too sell it, how much are you asking.
---
Feed the People has been known to drop responder gear (specifically the exact white helmet you seek). So has Back on the Beat. I think any of the events involving the Responders probably have a chance.
---
Same for me, I'm always quick to be low on hunger and thirst now, even with the perk equipped
---
For a sniper I would have thought an instigating explosive lever action would be good, at least as an opener, then followup with an executioner version but I run heavy energy weapons so what do I know?
---
yes, surprisingly that's one of the hardest (damage taken) events in the game.
---
And aid. Even better!
---
Thanks for responding. I love it on my automatics, but I wasn‚Äôt sure whether shotgun builds favored it so highly.
---
I‚Äôm not entirely convinced it ever worked lol but it definitely seemed worse after the last patch
---
Wow you‚Äôre taking this way too far while also being hypocritical. She never said *you* told her to do anything at all. She said she has to deal with it in her life and doesn‚Äôt want to be bothered with in while trying to enjoy herself. I‚Äôm going to politely recommend that *you* stop putting words in *her* mouth. 
---
If this was based on **‚ÄùDeep seeded hate issues with men‚Äù** she would probably be sitting here yelling at every guy who even comments on this thread.
---
Done just that but only with the addition of jet pack till my AP ran out but darn mole rats seem to have an invisible jetpack of their own.
---
And a rat with a bat and a son with a *gun*
---
Read the responses to the other people that ask this question every damned day.
---
And don‚Äôt base your opinions on YouTube morons. Form your own
---
What are you trying to pacify? It the patch notes I remember reading it can‚Äôt be worked on larger animals like deathclaws, sloths, etc
---
Based on how this thread is going, that clearly isn't true.
---
I'm level 162 and have spotted it 3 times...killed him once about a month ago.  A teammate &amp; I were checking out this place in the mire...a random tree house...and I had one of those random being hit by something that's not there moments.  I brush it off.  Then it happens again and I'm hearing a strange noise, then I see a spark like a bullet tapped me on the ass of my PA.  So now I'm like WTF when my teammate yells out Flatwoods Monster!  I ran so fast to get a hit on that thing.  So yeah, you've definitely seen it a lot more than a lot of us have at level 40.  Get him!
---
Haha, I did that too. Shh, don't tell anyone üòÇ
---
That is.. quite late. lmao
---
Nope not a peep from them on it at all
---
Someone invited me to a party and a game. They wanted to trade junk. I got out what I could and the fucked killed me with his explosive shotgun. I‚Äôve told this story about three times now but i still can‚Äôt figure out how the fucker killed me instantly. He took all my stuff too then removed me from the party.
---
I nuked some of the competition camps that popped up around me last night, had fun.
---
My GF rebuilt her entire camp three times in a row because of stairs or floors that wouldn't go away no matter what. If the game thinks it's necessary, it could give a prompt like with scrapping or dropping favorited items. 
---
Why even force that rule on players if they can build multilevel fortresses suspended on one rusty set of metal stairs? Seriously I would like a Dev response to this. I can't think of one solid reason for the absolute restriction.
---
Mods won‚Äôt change the look. They‚Äôre selling all these upcoming looks in the atomic shop
---
I think itd be cool for them to have a game mode that has super long night times + your suggestion. It could have increased cryptid spawns and would give a great outlet to make use of nocturnal legendaries
---
Secret society of unpaid workers.
---
This problem aggravates when trying to get low level three star legendaries with a low level car√°cter. Many armors are not available at low levels (-lvl20) so the chances to get a wood armor are much higher.
---
I got the helmet from Back On The Beat recently, so it does happen, though *extremely* rarely.
---
&gt;level 1
---
Thank you! Will give it a try on my next built!
---
You just described me perfectly, except I continued to play this game on and off again and again.
---
Can we also fix the range for some weapons? Fallout 4 had a good range but in 76 your hit box has to be touching theirs to do anything at all.
---
If you're on PC I have some of the Fasnacht Tankards that you can't get anymore. :) 
---
I saved them to sell but I'm only asking like 100 Caps per one, and it's one-per customer so I can share them around, and someone won't just buy them all and up-sell them.
---
Damn near perfect

That would be pretty cruel seeing as it reverts back to a 1* as soon as you switch servers or log off.

I randomly invited a lvl 363 from accross the map when two people were grieifing me at hemlock. He came all the way up to me only for both of us to be destroyed three times in a row. He tried. And I love him for it.
---
You don't need extra range on shotguns, they are way too powerful to begin with. if you want range just go with non-auto rifles
---
PIP now shows collected tokens/badges/etc in the first tab, last category - don't need to check balances at machines anymore.
---
Missing legendary stuff seems to have started with the legendary scrip machine update. They seem like they coincide with people losing stars off existing legendary stuff that they bought, too. I'm too paranoid to buy anything now.
---
It's all apart of the field you work in take it or leave it.
---
Sure dude! What‚Äôs your PSN? I‚Äôll add you when I get off work. I mostly play weekends but I‚Äôm not some week nights. Also if you see the lvl 130 that‚Äôs me. The lvl 50 is my fianc√©. She‚Äôs more likely to opt for solo play
---
Only the pipe guns use 38, and I've seen a combat rifle mod that coverts it to 38. But the dage goes from a base of 35 to 18. So it's junk
---
Should have done that first, thank you! üôè
---
He says it‚Äôs 1 str
---
Pretty sure around launch they mentioned it coming about a year after launch as their plan, but I don't really remember where I saw/heard that.
---
Some of them aren't hard to do, just time consuming.  I have 4-5 (I'm at work so can't check) almost done.  The collectors was over halfway before I even started it because of the things I'd already picked up in my time of playing, which was nice.  I do Campfire Tales as well when I can.  I'm probably in the minority, but I'm actually enjoying doing these...actually working for something when the other newer things were so quick to get through.  I',, actually feel like I accomplished something when I finally get my mod!
---
Yeah, I had this happen to me too. I thought it might be, the junk was used for building or something and thus cant be sold anymore but still shows up in the vending machine..
---
Sorry for my english :)
---
Yeah kinda. I have a tse and with 3* card of demolition card in intelligence it goes from 118 to 178 I think.
---
Yeah, good idea. The last weapon you had equipped should go on our back/backpack, or the one we use the most/second most
---
While they‚Äôre at it, how about they drop the atom shop prices down to something that‚Äôs actually sane
---
Exactly this, it's like the massacred fallout 4 and plugged a lan cable up it's arse. Or at least fallout 4 with building mods.
---
Nice! Im only level 32ish but I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.
---
Aye! Fookin' Hell. Lik me wee Mither use ta mek.
---
If wishes were fishes Fallout would be Bass Pro 5000. I don‚Äôt see how this is an improvement. It‚Äôs unnecessary too.
---
Mirelurk Kings are on the very short list of mobs my lvl 120 sneaky dude still has to respect. Buggers.
---
I mean if you quit over some bugs then maybe a bethesda game isn't for you /s
---
Despite the bugs (i've been here since beta) the game is still really fun, both as a solo player and with a group of friends. some things are much more challenging solo but that's the way the game is made.
---
no one can tell you the best things to do because they're different for everyone. while i like looking for rare outfits and cosmetics and my current life goal is to obtain a perfect 3 star legendary shovel for "it's on my backpack" reasons - my friend i spend a lot of my time with - his idea of a great time is taking the munitions factory - pimping it out and staying there all day collecting ammo then doing a queen run and blowing all of it lol 
---
if you like fallout then get back in the water, the radiation's just fine.
---
This would solve the problem using the existing game.mechanics.
---
This is such a bad bug....
---
Yeah this happens to me. Really annoying. And like the last guy said, sometimes i feel like my sneak perks arnt working at all
---
Not an issue. Glad the info is out there. Have fun
---
Ffr or explosive is a nice boost as a second perk on a lever. Well worth targeting. I tried and now don't use the explosive perks. Other perks were more useful.
---
It boosts damage and is percentage based so the higher your damage the more it does. If you found a 10% damage while aiming and 10%.while mutated it would be about the same.
---
As far as I understand it, it's a glitch from specifically getting a charging tesla rifle as a drop. Supposedly that glitches out the sights and gives it a "default" of a scope, which doesn't exist. So it has literally nothing on the sights, and it doesn't even show up as an option when examining it. Even the standard sight attachment has a little aiming reticle on it, but this is just empty space where that sight would be
---
Only if they are priced at a same level
---
&gt;marsupial
---
Holy shet just looked up that mutation that's awesome!
---
Buttressed
---
My point is, nerf everything or nothing. It's that simple, I'm not after a benefit, or to make my life easier or the game. It's just a fact that melee hasn't been nerfed whatsoever.
---
Well, he made the effort to educate me on what I was giving up,   (I just love levers and wanted an AAE version).  I do have a BE gat I bought in February but haven‚Äôt tried‚Äîbut will now due to his and your input.   It is only level 40 but should give me a sense of the overall experience.   Actually typing this post has made me realize‚ÄîI need to pick one weapon type each week and force myself to use it to break myself of my lever habits.
---
There's Buttressed as the top material mod. Adds +12/+7 for limbs, +23/+11 for the torso. I don't think that's massively better than hardened or tempered, but I don't have the numbers handy for those.
---
It's a scrap unlock, although you can find mods for it at vendors. If you can't craft raider armor (the plans are not farmable) then searching for the mod is your best bet.
---
How do you kill him? He just keeps disappearing when I attack him.
---
PSN: SuperKameGuru__
---
I'm not sure if I'll count faschnacht stuff, since that should come back next year. There's also nothing bugged about it existing
---
My point exactly, thanks for your reply.
---
wasnt it nerfed? i think i saw some post saying the difference is 10 points of dmg
---
I think I use vats, but it missed most of the time (zero dmg). Range should be the same it think or less as it is a lower lvl.
---
I literally bought one a week ago for 5k.
---
You can use the cinderblocks as a small staircase

Not without a mod you didn‚Äôt.

---
fucking hell
---
Another on board. Yeh see this all the time. Nerf everyone, not just certain weapons. Or give us our buffs back.
---
It's an event area. As to all the posts and hope. Take it with. Grain of salt. Probably a 30 min event timer, 3 large rooms with connecting tunnels and a mob density similar to either nuked burrows or the golf club
---
Perception and the perk change this. In a few small ap cost of an auto burst you‚Äôll be churning 95% in no time.
---
It‚Äôs BACK !! :)
---
Found 1 yesterday while on a routine run of the map for items.  Found it a usual hat ‚Äúspawn‚Äù location.
---
yeah but you can‚Äôt place an upper floor without attaching one of their official staircases to it and then you can‚Äôt remove the staircase because it says it‚Äôs inaccessible
---
It‚Äôs stuff like this persisting that makes this game really look rough.
---
Agree
---
185k members and less than 1k upvotes. Yup you are the edge case
---
Lemme get you starred with  the "long pew"  plans... give us preview pictures dammit!!!  i bought 2 before i figured it wasn't a lazer gun.....fuck
---
Mostly SBQ, random encounter, sheep, and daily quests.
---
There are only two good second ranged weapon perks‚Äîexplosive and fast fire rate.   So if you don‚Äôt have spare intelligence perk points you can choose FFR.
---
Vats is the kill button- if you can VATs someone they should be dead. You can‚Äôt VATs when someone is cloaked it has their gun out. I think when someone is crouched as well.
---
Yeah, me too... :/
---
I give her the thumbs down all damn day long and all she does is nod at me.... its like she knows she's peddling crap.
---
For queen fights, yeah. They fire a bit slow there. Can't say that I found myself wanting a higher fire rate anywhere else though.
---
Frankly I hope they don‚Äôt do it.  I was originally hesitant but now like interacting with others.
---
The game literally uninstalled itself 30 minutes before the Beta went live. I usually ignore bugs but it‚Äôs hard to ignore them when you can‚Äôt even access the game ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Np, it's been my guide for a few months now
---
The first sentence she wrote says ‚ÄúDo not tell me what to do‚Äù then went on about how she gets told what to do in her everyday life just like every other man and women in any country with a job.
---
So please how is her saying ‚ÄúDo not tell me what to do‚Äù not her telling me to not tell her what to do lol? I mean really did you even put any thought into this rebuttal? 
---
What‚Äôs next she‚Äôs gonna jump in and say she don‚Äôt need no man defending her? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised honestly. Because that‚Äôs what men haters do, instead of thanking you for at least trying, even though your response lacks logic.
---
In regards to the subreddit thing, thanks, I‚Äôll take it as a compliment that my routine comments on a video game sub sound ‚Äúvery smart‚Äù to you,  when in reality to me I am literally dumbing everything down, so that the inarticulate and uneducated masses on reddit may understand.

They were mentioned at [PAX East](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b70x75/pax_2019_news_thread_will_update_over_time/), perhaps there will be more information at E3.

Make it Rust dark.

Is there any chance you could make a clip of that happening? Cause that sounds ridiculous.

Same thing happening to me&gt;

It said "World found" and started to count down, then froze on 1 and said "Disconnected from server". I tried to load in again and the same thing happened. I closed my game and then tried again. "Disconnected from server". Tried to scan and fix, tried reinstalling the game.

How do you fix?

I agree, I think the purveyor is a great addition to the game, but the end game events need to be rewarding end game loot, SBQ should be giving s guaranteed 3* legendary every time
---
There wasn‚Äôt one, this guy got punched in pvp and is complaining.
---
If you run towards him he'll run away, so shoot him to engage.  My teammate had shot &amp; engaged him, so I just ran up and hit him with my axe.
---
Yeah I have a Bloodied, Swing Speed +1 strength combat knife &amp; it melts lmao. Also have incisor 2 &amp; level 3 of that perk that makes the melee‚Äôs weigh less &amp; swing faster
---
What i'm guessing is , they are patching exploits and glitches to make sure for future content or 5* weapons don't get duped and sold on ebay for more than the actual game value. as you can see they implemented new legendaries already.
---
This is a problem I experience. I enjoy just casual conversation with friends, and somethings I just want to help people out, and if they don't want it I respect that and leave, but these days even in Adventure, I'm apparently a KOS? Really tarnishes the fact I just want to help people, new or not.

PSN: king_g4merr3 Will be glad to play with you :)

I've got carnivore, and I fill my hunger bar really fast with any of the prepared or basic types of meat, but I have a constant thing where I'll way over prepare foods

Most recs default at 500 caps. It's kind of hard to know a real value of something because there's no auction house where you can compare prices with other players.
---
12 points, and that's for a regular one. Two shot means each projectile gets its own explosion, which doubles the total effectiveness. Then there are other effects that stack on the explosive damage
---
Seen it before, especially on good deals. I‚Äôll have to try buying in smaller quantities like y‚Äôall.
---
Yesterday, don't know how.
---
Oooh... that's seems me strange to as I had already them done quickly (I had not checked it at 5:00PM (france) and was like "hum...ok... already did 76 kill...why not))
---
I would strongly recommend this, especially if you rushed the levelling first time around. I started a new character to play with a friend and it was far more fun than I expected.
---
Keep server hopping yo find it eventually

Near Ella‚Äôs often

Agree, I just think it's unfair we have been hit with nerfs yet melee hasn't. Either nerf em all or don't.
---
I'm it never worked. And still doesn't . I've even removed it and both starched genes and class freak, reapplied the mutations and then added the cards back. Still takes 30 min ( timed multiple times in multiple servers. With and without.

Test as conducted. Craft 40 food and 40 purified water

Remove both cards. Eat and drink both food and water 40 times. ( Making sure that the bars are completely full)

Run in circles in my locked camp.

Time untill notification of low food/water
---
Record time

Repeate all steps with card equipped.

Time with cards 28.53 min

Time with happy camper only 45.6 min

Time with happy camper and class freak, and starched genes. 45.59 min

All tests done with NO armor or weapons equipped to make sure. Try it yourself

I had my camp built right next t to the cabins when I first started playing,  the screaming got really old Lol

Clearly a melee build. Dickhead.

Thanks best start earning badges

Yes the Extremely Complex system they put in (a vending machine) could only have been imagined by you. Get real.
---
alt, it ends up being much faster
---
Good idea, not a fan. I like my good deeds to remain anonymous.
---
You'll still get Prime Receiver plans and that kind of thing from SBQ but not Purveyor. Any of that specific loot pool type stuff is still some motivation (unless you've got it all already).
---
Damn. Thank you for the reply

I play it like it's a single player game with other people around. I've never teamed up, although I do hop into events as they are happening. Like Elder Scrolls Online, you don't have to be part of a team to get credit for world events, you just have to participate. 
---
I'm level 56 and have been playing ~6 weeks, and I've never had a problem with griefing or other players in general. I just explore, do quests, build my camp, life my life. Sometimes other people are around, sometime they aren't. It's all good.
---
There are a few bugs here and there, but I haven't run into anything major in my time with the game so far.
---
Maybe.
---
That's what this game is for. Ammo, healing items, and legendary rolls are far too common for this to ever be a hardcore experience. You can stay in survival mode unless you want to pvp, which it sounds like you don't. Nukes are pretty rare nowadays and are pretty much always either directed at the scorchbeast queen or a legendary farming spot (whitesprings/harper's ferry). Unless you run the popular events or establish yourself a decent vending machine, you won't really be seeing many people around unless you seek them out
---
This Please. Would even pay some serious atoms for it.
---
I was saying even at the darkest nightvision is unnecessary unless its a dungeon of course
---
I could have sworn they said it would come 2019 with mod support
---
Probably a bug, it seems the selling of ammo is a bit whacked out right now (certain amount of caps are vanishing upon purchase from the sounds of it). I've pulled all my ammo from sales currently until its sorted.
---
Viable again? Shotguns are one of the best options in the game. Enforcer alone can make a level 5 pump action viable

Yes. I managed to find the previous holotapes and then that one. Creepy.

SPOILERS BELOW
---
Zax is an AI built into vault 51, which had an experiment. The experiment was that it didn't have an overseer when it closed it's doors, meaning that the dwellers would have to find a way to choose an overseer. While they were choosing a way to elect a dweller to become the overseer, ZAX had a better idea. He put the candidates in a deathmatch and gave some, but not all, guns and the winner would be one step closer to becoming the overseer. After winning multiple of these free-for-alls the dweller would become overseer. This is the nuclear winter mode, where ZAX has you all fight in a battle royale to become the overseer and win rewards, whether it be unique weapons for adventure mode characters or XP. This is Nuclear winter, the new mode coming in the summer. It is probably going to be showcased by Bethesda at E3, so we probably will get more details then. 
---
I hope it works like this. I have watched a video or two and have a decent idea of what will happen. I have filled in some blanks with my own thoughts so it will probably be wrong:
---
* Once you press play there will be three modes, adventure, survival, and nuclear winter. Once you choose nuclear winter you will spawn on a server, with a completely empty inventory except for your vault jumpsuit (they wound't leave you naked, would they?). 
---
* You won't have any perks, and you will be lvl 1. You may be able to lvl up during the mode (I dunno, we got leaked images of a weird "briefcase bloodhound" so maybe) 
---
* Two things will either happen, A) part of the map is designated to be fought in, whether it's in the forest, the mire or the ash heap or B) vault 51 will be the combat zone. There you will have to scavenge for weapons and ammo. 
---
* A ring of nuclear fire will slowly collapse in around you, where going into it will cause Rad damage. 
---
* There may or may not be workbenches, where you can fix or upgrade your weapons. 
---
* Every once in a while a government supply bot will come, and drop off a supply cache of resources and guns will be dropped. 
---
* Winners will get unique rewards for their adventure mode characters, such as weapons and armor, or clothes
---
I dunno, what do you guy's think. Sorry I have been rambling for a while
---
So much suck
---
As a Scotsmen haggis is my right I have it running  through my veins och aye the noo "freedoom" :)
---
Whatever I feel is a fair price to me. Not trying to get rich or anything...lol
---
Yes. I‚Äôve only engaged in PvP twice and mostly play alone but encounter friendly people all the time. I‚Äôve been playing since December. Not sure how many hours in, but I‚Äôm level 68.
---
Wow that‚Äôs even more impressive. Congrats to you! I bet that‚Äôs a fun gun.
---
But yeah it‚Äôs a rifle. So rifleman perks benefit it if you have standard or prime receiver. And commando benefits it if you have the full Auto piston receiver. 
---
Auto piston cranks out great DPS but the recoil is insane, so you really have to use it with VATS or tap fire it.
---
They should fix the terminal and later trip wire while there at it because it doesnt work right
---
Get into to it quickly and get set for project paradise. Find some players to play with (just post here on Reddit) it sounds like you'll need a group. 
---
New content has a shelf life and paradise may well follow the trend. Fun while the community is interested and difficult to do alone. 
---
Either way the game is best when the community is united in accomplishing a goal. If you enjoy it then go back and play some more or play paradise until the returns diminish and wait until the next content drops. 
---
It's going to be when the game is at its best. If you can't enjoy it now you moat likely won't joy it any other time.
---
&gt; as long as it's not a complete noob-destructing fuck-you-all arms race
---
Play in Adventure Mode (the standard) and turn on the Pacifist flag in game settings, and you won't have to worry about PVP at all, other than a tiny chance when claiming/owning a workshop. PVP is all by choice in Adventure Mode.
---
It's like night and day
---
It used to be 400 at launch, but has changed to 800. If you're filling it that fast, you might have junk stored that was not scrapped first. You must scrap all junk prior to storing it to substantially lower the stash space.
---
Wait, wait... That's a thing? I've been there on a few occasions for kill Wendigo challenges, made a beeline for the chamber to find it empty. I always assumed another player had beaten me to it, or it wasn't a guaranteed spawn. I just need to wait? Really?
---
I think the best thing they could do is place more emphasis on factions.  The cap thing and perk cards are more just me being nit picky, but I feel the game would really benefit from a more traditional Fallout faction dominated environment.  The game as is, you obviously have to join/pass the enclave in order to shoot a nuke.  I wonder if they could make one silo per each major faction (Enclave, BoS, Free States?) or just give every faction access to them.  Or for that matter have different eng game content per faction.  SBQ for BoS, some type of super raid for enclave, etc.  I dunno

No amount of Abraxo Cleaner is going to get your knickers clean.

So would it be better to use the resolute veteran over the two shot explosive gatling gun I'm using?
---
yea.. 00huntr00
---
Ill be on in like 5 minutes.. in the stream behind flatwoods..
---
Does it just add to your cap total when you take it out of your stash? I've never seen that before. My guess would be it's some kind of bug relating to the fact that scrapped items in your camp/workshop automatically send whatever you get back to your stash. It must have "scrapped" a container or body that had some caps on it
---
&gt;Clost the Damm DOOR.  
---
&gt;If ya fast travel to a vendor. And mobs spawn kill them. Dont just leave.
---
1. I closed the door at a camp I visited the other day. Door locked behind me. So I accidently screwed every subsequent visitor as you couldn't get to the vending machines. Crappy camp design.
---
2. Don't FT to a camp in an area where you can't take on the worst of that region. That means you low levels shouldn't be shopping over in the mire if you're just going to nope out when a gulper tries to give you a welcome kiss.
---
It would be more of finding the legendary mod plans that would be difficult.  Then finding the rare ingredients to make those mods.  It probably won't happen because Bethesda for some reason loves RNG.
---
A year from launch will still be 2019. But we probably won‚Äôt hear anything about it until much closer to winter.
---
Remember you always buy them from players for about 200caps for each one so don‚Äôt buy directly from Modus unless you buying the recipe which last I checked is 19k each and to make sure mutations stay on always keep starched genes lvl2 equipped
---
‚ÄúHard at work‚Äù....

You ever hear of a thing called customer service you have to deal with it. Also you never said anything about your work so you're just one of the many sitting in a cubicle answering phones all day by the sounds of it.

Nothing has turned red yet! Bought some mods from the vendor in Watoga, including a beta wave tuner to add burning effect

Can‚Äôt imagine why you‚Äôve been banned from this sub before? How strange!

Yeah, you never know the intention of the person inviting, but it's better to ignore. Plus, telling someone to "piss off" in Xbox live chat can get reported and you can get comms banned for a couple of weeks. üò≤

That's Bethesda programming for u
---
I run a bloodied pump action as a backup used to love it but now beathesda have done something weird to it,700 plus per shot and it can take over 8 shots to kill a supermutant as they just soak up the damage,done run any perks I've try ed max skeet shooter and still no difference.
---
I at least had them on the ground out front of my camp. Was ticked off because a server ate my camp last time I had it finished so I just built a makeshift platform for crafting tables and set the vending machines on the ground in front. Was good enough to sell 10k worth of stuff before I got around to rebuilding things.
---
Nope.
---
I typically drop .38 in a paper bag in front of my vending machine. :) 0 caps solved

You should do it in the water too, take out one of the requirements for another badge

On this same note I would like to see a reputation on player icons or above their name if they make the repair flag them on the map.

Right you are, I hope the biv alcohol challenges maybe foreshadow further content in that genre
---
Just keep knocking things down little by little? 
---
Its kind of iffy though, cause I was just ready to lower the price on some legendary scrip material (worthless 1\*) and somebody literally showed up and bought all of them moments before I was gonna do it. They'd been at that price a few days with 0 interest from anybody else. 
---
I'd prefer a more World Market type setup frankly but I do like touring peoples CAMPs and seeing the sheer creativity people have with the building system so I don't mind this system either.
---
I was thinking like March 2019
---
And just so you know....I'm not a griefer nor was I ever. Infact, I have been called, "one of the nicest guys in the wasteland". 
---
I have encountered griefers, and made them regret it. I've encountered these wasteland bullies. Infact, even yesterday. A lvl 60-something attacked my mule. He wanted to pvp. A lvl 60-something vs a lvl 3. Yes, I know, not possible. But he was hitting me and taunting me. For not reason. So I logged into my main. A lvl 193. He didnt want to pvp me then. So them my girl logged in when she over heard what was going on. So me a lvl 193 and my girl a 175 asked why he was being a bully. Nothing. Then he brought his friend. A lvl 93. And his friend quickly realized the situation he was unknowingly put in. 
---
The bully kept saying he was going to get us. And we said that were were right there. All talk. Just a bully. Finally he left. But his friend stayed around. Asked if I could make some ultracite parts. Of course I can. I run a very successful PA shop with the cheapest prices in town. I said to him, "your friends a dick and theres a difference between raider and dick" told him I wont make him ultracite pieces.  Instead, I dropped him a fully modded suit. Soon after I got a a message. A full apology for being a "bitch". 
---
There is a reason some people run into griefers constantly and theres a reason people hardly encounter them. And by our short back and forth here and your religious downvoting (as if it bothers me), I can see why you have had negative encounters. I'm sure there is a r/ for bringing back club penguin. That might be more suited for you.
---
And let the downvoting begin
---
Folks, if you are struggling with the lore, just go onto the wiki
---
Problem is If said item is that 1 pylon that's connected to all youe stuff. 
---
Or if it's stairs. Your never getting those replaced.

Back into the scrip machine
---
Stealth has always been bugged, and they have never addressed any of the complaints. I have been in stealth with +30% from a bobblehead, +75% from the perk card and another plus from amour and covert ops mag, essentially putting my somewhere near +150% stealth and still was being 'Noticed" through walls and being shot at during night from a distance that even in day with no stealth perks I wouldn't be even seen.     
---
Right now stealth is in need of some serious TLC to make it more accurate and proper.     
---
There is no excuse for being in caution or danger when using perks and buffs plus a stealthboy while standing still, but it seems if you are within 20-30 ft of a mob they can smell you or something.
---
Racing stripes are just part of the wasteland. Embrace the nasty!
---
Those lvl 22 gutsys are bastards at early levels. I still take great pride in one-shotting them all now when I run into them. Bastards earned it.
---
What about decontamination showers
---
Once you sell enough and see enough you start to get a feel for it. My rule of thumb is it never goes at or above the "default" vendor value unless it's something rare that can not be easily farmed or bought
---
I had never heard of them, being from Europe. The new event at Camp Adams is pretty harrowing. Must've sucked when Layla met Nia. I'm almost desensitised to Wendigo now; seen enough of them, but the idea of meeting one prior to the war is disturbing!
---
Okay, that‚Äôs good to know. The purveyor gave me a AAFFR combat shotgun with less VATs cost. As a commando rifleman, those rolls are amazing, just wasn‚Äôt sure how useful they would be on a shotty. I could see that shotgun being useful for queen fights.
---
I don‚Äôt see where that is mentioned. Regardless the majority asked for it to be brighter when it was much darker during BETA and initial release. There will be a much bigger protest if they go back to that.
---
....... Ahahaha
---
I am not sure what this has to do with your original post, but OK.
---
I **DO** work in customer service. I work for the largest company on the planet, and have (directly) a team of 16 who (indirectly) represent 260 reports.
---
I haven't had the pleasure of a cubicle in many years.
---
Tell you what I do have the pleasure of. Dealing with devs and project managers who make my guys' tools. And it IS a pleasure, because they're reasonable people, able to have a 2 way conversation, who appreciate praise for what they did right, and feedback for what needed to be done differently.
---
You, mi amigo, could not survive in an environment like that.
---
I repeat. If you are a programmer, I am 16 feet tall, green, and made out of dental floss.

Next time buy 19 screws first
---
Nerfed, but still effective the majority of the time.
---
I think they tried to balance having a locked in build and being able to swap builds but ended up with something that‚Äôs just mildly annoying. Maybe they wanted to add some friction so you couldn‚Äôt quickly swap in the middle of a fight. Perk sets that are only swappable out of combat would help and not allow you to quickly change in the heat of battle.
---
Much like most right in front of the spawn point. 
---
The walkway that splits the cemetery specifically. Upfront on the right laying down.

I don't know if they will be upping the storage space, but everyone does seem to want it. There's ways to get the most out of the 800 lbs we have now tho... make sure you scrap all your junk regularly, and depending on how much you gather you're gonna wanna go to tinker bench and bulk EVERYTHING you can (make sure to put the bulked items back in storage lol)  It's tempting to throw all your legendaries in your personal vendor to sell, but that's the fastest way to take up space. Only hold on to 3 stars with good attributes for that and take all the 2 and 1 stars to the legendary exchange to trade in for scrip (trade scrip in I think at Berkley springs, right above Harper's Ferry).   Also, any legendaries you want to keep but don't use all the time, go to your armor bench and mod them so they weigh as little as possible while they're stored and the mod again when you decide to use it. You can take a 12 lbs sludge hammer down to 6 lbs for storage, etc.... the other thing I do is when I hit storage cap  I go thru all the junk and decide what I have a ton of and sell it. There's no need to have 30 bulked cloth or glass... that's all I can think of for now, hope some of that helps :)
---
Ah. Yeah around launch they said they were targeting a year after launch but that might slide based on other dec priorities.
---
Ok. Thanks for the info
---
All types count. I managed to find the plans I was missing, some player had them on sale so I got them. I already had heavy torso plans which I made and it counted for me.
---
I just have a basic Bloodied Gatling Gun and the first rank of each Heavy Gunner perk.  At low health, that thing does about 450 a shot.  Hard to complain.  Eviscerates pretty much anything I can't melee.
---
I know this post is super old but I have some Combat Armor that could use some deep pockets. Any chance you would be willing to help me out?
---
KOS? (Sorry, I don‚Äôt think I know the phrase.)
---
I think offering help is a nice thing to do! It‚Äôs the assumption that someone needs a constant barrage of unsolicited explanation that can be frustrating.
---
You go to one area of the map and get blown to smithereens by campers.
---
Sounds like a BR mode to me.
---
Reduce the brightness on your tv
---
I avoid building my base over where I place my camp unit as that is where players spawn on, if more players would just realize this it could save a lot of lost sales for them. I generally won't bother going back to a camp if I get stuck in a floor, not worth my time to FT to the nearest marker and walk back only to find over priced items or nothing I am looking for.     
---
If I don't spawn in a spot I can easily walk from to the vendor units I'll just move on to the next camp.
---
Definitely a mistake. I think a community manager said they were aware, but nothing has changed yet.
---
Then i will need lead lined back pack to swap for when fighting ghouls that's it üòÖ
---
Specifically for SBQ you just can't beat a shotgunner with that perk that cripples everything. I said stay LANDED, damnit!
---
Sorry, I don't
---
Everything about th m works correctly.
---
Except the blast radius. It's currently set to around 5-10% of what it should be. If you throw one and watch it's explosion, you'll see a dinky little blast about the size of an eyebot.
---
IF it actually hits something, it does catastrophic damage, but good luck with that!
---
For comparison, try a regular Nuka Grenade. Quantum Grenades should have an explosion that matches them.
---
You can pick it up cheap now and the pve part is decent but pvp is a broken non-existent mess.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I was pretty sure it wouldn't work because of how the perks are coded in the ESM, but testing is always good.
---
Class Freak adjusts the magnitude of spells that have the negative mutation keyword, but several mutation penalties don't use those, including Speed Demon. Some mutations are specifically written to work around this.
---
Did you also test without Speed Demon, by the way? According to the ESM the penalty is 40% faster food/water reduction, not 50%.
---
If we keep saying it, it might actually happen...
---
Just give me the greenhouse set and I'll be a happy camper.üòéüèï
---
I'm expecting something similar to the Burrows, except with more of an arena focus.
---
Corupted character? I need an explination.
---
I fix turrets all the time for people.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing another nuke zones spot with a few three stars and some mobs of the kings. Would definitely be a challenge for a few people.
---
Ok so you dont do any programming thank you
---
The wastelands are surprisingly warm and fuzzy.
---
I got stuff in the first few days after launch but it‚Äôs been ages yeah.
---
&gt;Or don't put strict restrictions on it to begin with.   
---
Please Bethesda, please  
---

---
Ah yes, I must have been mistaken; that's the only qualifying feature of a BR game. So that means every single FPS is a BR game, too.
---
Do you have vegan option???
---
I've noticed lately (thanks to player vending and visiting lots of other player camps) that having a turret inside the building is getting more popular, e.g. the turret is at the corner, and there are angled half-walls on the two perpendicular walls that make up the corner. This enables the turret to shoot targets outside while getting increased protection from being inside. I thought it was a pretty cool idea, though it kind of presents the appearance of having a big hole in the corner of your house. Sort of a workaround for those who don't want turrets outside.
---
I don't have any locked doors but I did put a note on the wall with signage to close the main door when leaving

I would love the vault pieces from FO4, make a safe space for those shell shocked snowflakes leaving the vault.

Yeah Luckily I was able to figure out the junk scrap early on :) but I didn‚Äôt know about the bulk thing so thanks

Tbh I‚Äôve been able to manage it well for awhile (ammo/gunpowder is annoying)

But it‚Äôs mostly legendary a I have problem with (I don‚Äôt get many 3* )

Every update I see I‚Äôm hopeful for even abut more space or work around

But it hasn‚Äôt happened yet

Took me a few days to get 13 possum badges so far with a few not finishing as they are bugged,had to take time off my daily meds run for caps and travelling all over the place was hard on the caps and I managed to buy the high capacity mod from a guys camp for 7000 .
---
its a hard one, let me tell you this. If you are standing in front of it, you wont see it.
---
Sure gt vespaboy1975
---
Don‚Äôt feel so bad.  I ended up getting wanted inadvertently I was curious about someone‚Äôs locked item in their camp, so I went around in PVE trying to get someone to kill me.  I went up to a lvl 300 guy and hit him with a couple of shots and he ran away.  They must have thought I was a griefer.  So after 30 minutes of everyone avoiding me like the plague I go to survival mode and just sit there at Whitesprings waiting for someone to gank.  Nobody took the bait!  So I wander over to the train station and some guy is micd up talking all sorts of nonsense so I engage him and end up killing him by mistake!  He respawns and launches into a gay bashing tirade (directed at me) so I ignore him and seek out #1 who drops me quick to remove my wanted label.  Ugh!
---
Yesterday my FE Combat Rifle disappeared
---
I just wanted to point one thing. They throw you out \_without\_ a gun. Without even a knife. Bare hands
---
Not the only one left but rifles are better at range and melee is better up close.
---
That reminds me I couldn‚Äôt find it either! Where is it and what‚Äôs it called then if not ‚ÄúBrahmin Pen?‚Äù
---
Now I‚Äôm a trash human for calling you out on your obvious hate for men. Maybe you wouldn‚Äôt be called out for it if you didn‚Äôt do it. 
---
You should take a good look at yourself, because I‚Äôll tell you a normal person doesn‚Äôt jump to the conclusion that a person is sexist just because they are the opposite sex and enlightening them on knowledge they clearly lack. Only people with deep seeded hate issues for the opposite sex.
---
And another thing, if you‚Äôre not a man hater, then this would all be laughable to you, and you wouldn‚Äôt be so mad as to call me ‚Äúa trash human‚Äù . You‚Äôre only so mad because I‚Äôm calling you out on it and you know it‚Äôs true, and seem too ashamed to admit it.

I‚Äôm on in about an hour or so, if you still need it then I‚Äôd be happy to help.
---
So you're telling us you bought this game 8 times? Fucking why, mate?
---
nope, you can increase your brightness once they make nights normal and not as bright as daytime
---
otherwise , what is the point of a day/night cycle at all?
---
That makes sense. Sorry if I kinda just barged in there, thanks for explaining. 
---
Also, KOS is Kill On Sight.
---
Don't be so quick to dismiss the combat rifles .38 receivers....with the higher end .38 mods the gun is quick and the muzzle never leaves the target ....it's a good little ghoul killing machine while using up an " unwanted" resource and saving wear and tear on the old handmade.
---
Possible but irritating, I think.
---
Eight, actually.
---
I've been experimenting with this issue recently, and have figured out a few things:
---
1. Having any un-silenced weapon equipped seems to affect stealth, even if you haven't yet fired.
---
2. Un-equipping Grenades (Obviously not Silent) seems to help.
---
3. Being teamed and in close proximity to a team mate, when they're discovered, so are you.
---
4. Also make sure nothing (Diseases, or Perks) is affecting your agility adversely.
---
I have been watching this close lately, and found that when playing alone, with only silenced weapons in use, and my agility at 20 or above, my Stealth is nearly enough to bump into enemies without discovery.
---
Also if playing on a team, make sure nobody is sharing "Strange in Numbers" it can screw up many things.
---
I'd guess it will add in some new perks as well as pulling some of the low end ones as well, like faster movement when aiming. Stacking perks like Executioners Furious Explosive would be insanely overpowered.
---
Keep trying the recipe bot at Whitespring. That‚Äôs where I got mine
---
yes exactly
---
No. Because you can get one, or maybe depending on how you do it, two, 3 star legendary per day. You can  take out multiple queens, sheepsquatch, etc, every day.   
---
I don't do any events for the legendary loot, exclusively. Queen fights are great because you get all sorts of XP from killing trash mobs, other legendary enemies, flux, ultracite, plans, aid items, repair kits now, etc etc etc.
---
It's only Monday but this is the best post title of the week. Well done.
---
Today I got an identical 3* single action to the one I had equipped. What are the chances? Lol.
---
They should probably just ban anyone not running a food build or joining the scouts. Make the wastelands a bit more warm and fuzzy.
---
Whoever built that base is a goddamn genius.
---
No... they dont exist. This is actually why they made up names for them
---
I was at WS and during a Nuke and was shopping at a player vendor. I walked away and suddenly a pack of 8-10 bloated glowing ghouls 3 of them legendary 3 stars came charging at me and my buddy. We fought them off at the camp and then repaired the turrets they damaged. Caught us off guard and was very happy to repair those turrets.
---
I just bought it off a Player Vendor for 25c a couple of hours ago. Keep an eye out!
---
If it costs over ten caps I just don't go to vendors anymore. I've wasted my last cap going to a vendor who has twenty weapons and the most interesting one is a drill.
---
that is why they have berry mentats, the pro snap camera, recon scopes, there is a night eyes perk that is useless as is, night vision scopes are also useless if i can see everything like its daytime
---
We really need to be able to bulk and sell ammo
---
It's gonna be like the burrow and everyone will go nuts again because they expected a new 60 dollar game.
---
Assassins/swing speed/+strength is a one star weapon?
---
at night time!!! its dark at night!
---
i honestly cant believe all these responses
---
ugh
---
That's a very nice gun
---
If we do get them, I bet we'll get 4 &amp; 5 star gear via modifying 3 star gear, kind of like what you can do with the Sacrificial blade on a 3 star Machete.
---
For instance, you take a 3 star Combat Armor, and apply a hard to get mod that makes it's stats even better than BOS material. Now you've got a 4 Star. Then you apply a special effect on the mod category that's also hard to get and powerful. Then you get a 5 star item. Same for weapons by getting a special Barrel/Receiver/Magazine/Effect/etc.
---
Basically, it gives you stuff to grind for without making current top tier items inferior.
---
Do you have a long barrel on your shotgun?
---
Mine does that too. It's usually when they're too close and the barrels clip through them.
---
Someone once invited me, I let them join, thinking they wanted a free fast travel. He joined. Teleported to my camp. Left the squad and leveled my camp to the ground.  Needless to say. Never again. I know they fixed camp damage recently. But never again.
---
It‚Äôs already at max brightness. So I can‚Äôt increase it. But you can easily decrease brightness and instead are being a total hole of the A$$ by insisting that others should be forced to not be able to see and enjoy the game.
---
Yeah, I ran into that one when redoing the floors in my base (before noticing the "replace" option... grrr).  Luckily, the good ol' rug glitch still works as long as you don't delete the rug afterward.  
---
(For those who do not know: 1) put down a rug, 2) put down the thing you want to move under the stairs on top of the rug... near the edge works best, and 3) move the rug with the thing still on it.)
---
Fair play :)
---
"running around the forest with the pip-boy light was not a great way to experience the world."
---
then you can explore at day time and do stuff in your base at night
---
my god its a post apocalyptic game based on stark realities of war never changing, but people cry uncle because night time gets dark outside?
---
?!?!?!!?!?!?!?
---
Tbh I'm pretty sure I've gotten lvl 45 and up from it but idk that's the first time I've been asked and I never payed enough attention before.
---
I got a 3* TSE Gatling with reduced weight from the vendor at Whitesprings for ~400 caps. I have no perks for it and it still chews through enemies.
---
You've been on Reddit for 5 years and don't know where it says this post is 91% upvoted?
---
imagine that, nighttime in a nuclear hellscape is more dangerous than daytime...
---
go figure!
---
I usually just put plans and stimpack for dirt cheap, I can sell in bulk and earn quite a bit.
---
I used to run it all the time. I started to noticed they were all level 40 so I stopped going.
---
you can use the pearly peepers or pro snap camera to tag even dead bodies
---
Mine reset today, but it was a good thing, i organized my machines
---
I always appreciate when a tester provides their methodology.üëç
---
Thanks. I need to start a new character to specialize in shotguns now haha
---
Don't do it. If you do, there's a well known exploit where they use blind team invites that are accepted to make you active in PVP and kill you and your CAMP.
---
It doesn‚Äôt show on the mobile app or on mobile web browser. I can‚Äôt use the desktop site at the moment
---
Oh yes mate love whipping out my pro snap in the middle of a pvp fight. Fantastic point.
---
Didn‚Äôt they remove the sacrificial mod adding a star? Thought I read that. I bet your right. Seems the most agreeable. That way you don‚Äôt lose your best stuff just make it better.
---
Yeah they pulled that when the Purveyor showed up (or the patch the week before, can't remember).
---
Fix what? They already made it twice as bright with twice the illumination distance.
---
It's a fun weapon, pity it breaks so quick.
---
Did you load into a world with the "can't place camp message"?
---
Mine resets when I get that.
---
Seems the game thinks you "stored" the vendors in that would and resets them.
---
Happened to me twice. Which is surprising considering not many have a camp in my spot. (Only got that a handful of times since launch and I've always been in the same spot.)
---
Wtf at what point do you just play a different game???
---
I check lucky hole mine for ants , they don't always spawn , but when they do it's a lot of them. And butchers bounty.
---
Did you find any info on whether perforating/stinging stacks cleanly on top of AA legendary or if it‚Äôs fucky? Does it add up directly to %90 armor reduction?
---
I only have the large recon scope but given the recoil and that I‚Äôm primarily melee/fist build that‚Äôs ok.
---
Yeah agreed
---
Did you get an email confirming you'll even be receiving one?
---
Ppl seem to assume they had top do nothing to get their bag replaced when in reality unless you jumped through the hoops you didn't jump through the hoops.
---
The email will say 4-6 months
---
Whatcha' generating?!
---
Level 150 and those are my three as well.  The only time I team up is when my son logs on.  Other than that I've been solo since launch day.
---
Yau gaui, rad roach, sting wing, fire fly, tick, wolf, owlet, bloat fly, and wendigo. I didn‚Äôt know the mole rat was up for grabs. Do you know where?
---
We'll let that excuse pass this time lol j/k I never noticed on the mobile site.
---
Dailies have a chance too, i got 11 badges whle doing only 2-3 possum badges
---
Shroud never even got his plastic version.
---
Not at all, everything I've gotten is basically the polar opposite of what would fit my build and current load-out.
---
Although I have gotten 2 good Explosive Weapons from the Purveyor, they are both weapons that do not have a suppressor mod available, and I'm a Stealth build.
---
I‚Äôd like to see the additional stars unlocked as part of the legendary player mechanic when it arrives, maybe 1 star at level 100 and the second at level 150. Just a thought.
---
Ddosing probably.
---
The day after the last patch, my main character (lvl 180 or so) tried joining a world as I was swapping things between accounts with a buddy. When I log in, I got a "Disconnected From Server" message over and over. It seems to freeze on the countdown to join. Basically, I haven't been able to play for 2 weeks. This thread seems to be what happened to me:

Damnit, man. It has seriously become an issue that you don‚Äôt want to mention anything you‚Äôre enjoying or anything that makes the game more fun and less of a time sink aloud.  If Beth catches wind they‚Äôre going to nerf it and claim that the way it worked before was the bug. 
---
It‚Äôs okay if things are fun and a bullet to the dome from an exploding round would indeed realistically kill a LOT of critters &gt;:C
---
Its a feature.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what OP is talking about. What you want is probably not trivially fixable.
---
I killed the Son of Fluffy by kiting it around doing sneak attacks. It took a while... Funny thing is, I had previously got the kill one with a shotgun by reducing the bear to 10% HP with a different gun. I didn't think to do that with the syringer...
---
I love this post.
---
Try out the lighthouse there tends to be one up on the top
---
Are they still banning people for using mods?
---
Never apologize for liking something.  You are entitled to your own opinions and taste.

Adults with adult supervision?

Thank you very much. I've asked this question before but nobody seemed to know but now i do. This is outrageous how is this not fixed yet??

Got a link to anything? A quick Google and subreddit search didn't produce anything.

We need a better log of things entirely. Like a journal with a ledger. Maybe a way for visitors to sign their name at you base or a way to thank you for leaving their crafting tables not behind a locked door?

A mailbox for daily login rewards and/or player gifts would be awesome too.

I used to say the same thing about Steam, but just like language, the more people agree on using something interchangeably (is that a word?) the more people treat it as fact. I hardly see anyone say Micro$oft when referring to the xbox. Mostly people just say xbox.

Ask the vendor to remove and readd the junk. I‚Äôve had this issue and readding resolves it.

OMG I do that too for others. I feel its a good idea to assist others so that they don't have to come to a place in pieces.

Doing the same except I‚Äôm using the same character.
---
Damn, good lesson, but damn...
---
How about when a Melee only one dies without even looking at you and you still get a disease?
---
Sneak attacking a Ghoul from behind them and still getting Rad Worms makes zero sense.
---
If you have the camera, use that. It sees dead bodies and sees them better than i do sometimes. Either that or give it a few minutes, come back and look for the flies.
---
Alternatively, if this happens to you, fast travel to the closest hard travel point and jog over. Sometimes it's free other times it's a few caps. Sometimes it's worth it sometimes it's not. 
---
I am not particularly enthused by the idea of rebuilding my camp around the fast travel point. It took me a while to build it. Lol
---
Valid point and i agree - but we've got to admit beth learned from the brewing-all-day-long.... Kind of at least.

I mean now there are lesser but even more specific/annoying

you can get possum badges from the event even before becoming a possum, i already had like 4. the pioneer scouts repeatables can also get you possum badges

I'm game.  If you reciprocate.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? I'm just asking for advice.
---
I don't know how you can handle more than one of those monsters. They always give me such a hard time. 
---
The Scorchbeasts must have been annoying too.
---
If you don't want to use the advanced power connectors you can build a wall, place the regular power connectors on it in the middle, switch the wall type to a door type, the power connectors floats in the doorway there. You can connect your genny from that doorway and then change it back to the wall type. External power at the cost of 1 power connector and you don't have to fiddle with advanced power connectors.
---
No, they never did
---
Also, there's a fountain at the Whitespring Golf Club that cures diseases for free.
---
Is he new? I have had him 2 times recently
---
Yea I wanna look like Ricardo Milos
---
Not ideal at all, but if have some weight perks like thru-hiker you can equip them to estimate how much you're carrying of that sort of item.
---
I recall there were some automated bans going out early this year. Let me see if I can find the article...
---
I'm totally with you there. As i said instead of forcing you to team-up they should make it optional - do it solo or team.
---
Bet I‚Äôm gonna rn
---
Let things settle. 
---
Personally I see a mix of 2 extremes: Players who undersell their legendary weapons, such as selling a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet for 200 caps, and players that over value their items, such as a  3* nocturnal limb damage combat rifle for 3000 caps. Obviously there is a middle ground between useful items and a price that represents the time investment to harvest them.
---
For consumables I typically price at half of vendor so ale price. If they don't sell at that price I start cutting down.
---
Wendigo Cave is my go-to location whenever I need to level up in a mine or cave to claim a challenge.  I love that place.
---
No such thing, just go with whatever fits your build best.
---
All 3 Pylons must be active for the Impostor to receive damage, one person can hold all 3 but I think the damage stacks.
---
As for dot I'm not really sure, it was possibly the Impostor while invisible shooting the Assaultron beam.
---
Lmao coming from someone who acts like they know programming when your first question is "Is the power turned on?" I program monitor and maintain life safety systems which have some of the strictest standards in my field of work, and just cause you can tell other people what to do doesn't say your correct.
---
This is where I comment that I can loot other people's railway ammo and they potentially get double returns.
---
I literally saw one for 5k.
---
I rely on team invites to fast travel o:
---
This was implemented in the fallout 3, NV (Yeah, Iknow you dont want to talk about it), and Skyrim, im still mad that they were lazy and didnt implemented it on FO4  moders have been doing a great job making them visible (but limited), and F076 Its almost a reeskin of 4... so no hopes on that.
---
Interesting. Cause I jumped from my friends Camp at Senecca Rocks with 2 pieces of Acrobat Armor to test this exact theory and for me it worked, multiple times (no Serendepity) although I do have Bird Bones
---
Do a little bit more research, the guy had cheat engine. Thats why he was banned.
---
I literally renamed one 5k.
---
Yepp. But sadly won't happen.
---
Still asking myself if they knew that they put in a photoframe for 300 atoms. 
---
Thats about a whole week of challenges - if you get them all done (lol) - for a frame. If you buy a full album irl it would be cheaper.
---
XP is based on enemy type and their name modifier. Your best bet for your current level if you‚Äôre playing solo is to kill super mutants. There are a lot of super mutants at Grafton Steel, WV Lumber Co, and the Penitentiary.
---
Alternatively, you can tag the charred feral ghouls in Whitesprings and wait for someone to kill them off for you. There are videos on YouTube that show where you can go to do this, but your best bet is the little curbed area by the pool left of the front of the clubhouse or the windows on the left side of the building just outside the kitchen area.
---
Where exactly is this safe?
---
Maybe two legs together are bugged? I have Acrobat chest and leg. I put them on yesterday and launched myself off of a cliff several times. No decrease in health at all.
---
Are you crashing when trying to enter, logging back in, trying to enter again, and crashing again?  If so, wait like 4 minutes outside before trying to enter to give the game more time to load.
---
Did you make sure the name showed up on the upper right hand side when you clicked?
---
He‚Äôs been in the game for a while but wasn‚Äôt working. They recently fixed him.
---
This is what happened to me as well. I finally bought an explosive shotgun after grinding for the caps. Within two weeks, I started getting explosive drops. I moved some bloodied weapons to my alt, and that character suddenly started getting Bloodied drops.
---
Around that level, I was probably slaughtering mutants at Summerville until I could adequately murder bots in Watoga.
---
They should imement everything from the Better Inventory mod in the base game
---
I don't think I have invited or accepted a team invite from a stranger, but I have shown up and helped people a bit. I helped some kid who was a level 8 power up one of the stations. He seemed lost and didnt know abiut the workshop. I showed him how to build then ran off, mostly cuz I didn't want to hang out with a kid, but I do the same with adults I have run into. Sometimes I ignore them unless they seem to be in trouble. In which case I may jump in, but will usually run off once the trouble is dealt with. I think one time i did team invite someone who was at my camp to a share a perk card with them when they wanted to craft. Once they were done, i kicked them from the team and went back to doing my own thing. So if I ever run into you. You can tell me to scram or i will disappear once we are done with the trouble/event/quest but will most likely not have a team invite.
---
I started late too and I had no problems.
---
Make sure you choose adventure.
---
Turn on ‚Äúpacifist‚Äù in options and you and your camp will be immune to attacks.
---
High level players are always in the low right corner of the map, you will be alone most of the time, it will feel just like single player.
---
Bonus, you will have access to a ton of stuff you ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù because of player vending.
---
The only bad thing is stash limit, daily and total cap limit.
---
Have fun!
---
lemonade and brownies, it seems.
---
That's crazy cuz just recently I could swear I got a lvl 45 sickle, lvl 45 flamer, lvl 45 war drum. Must've gotten them somewhere else
---
you said to find bodies and loot "m8"
---
try getting your point across without distorting it to debate, "m8"
---
that would be a fantastic victory for common sense, but something tells me you just want to argue
---
It is my understanding that the pylons themselves are the dot. I activated a pylon my first time doing the even and couldn't stay alive at all due to the constant damage. The next time I did it, I avoided the  pylons myself and worked to revive the people that activated them, since I couldn't handle the damage myself.
---
It also does this if you‚Äôre close to an object. It‚Äôs really obvious with the flamethrower which has the same problem.
---
You can see what it‚Äôs doing here:
---
https://youtu.be/F1Qx7wHbjaU
---
So being a conduit doesn't damage you, or being close to an activated pylon? That's the only thing I thought it could be, it was a slow consistant drain on my hp not chunks or it's death ray.
---
That would be cool but I think it should be limited to energy or physical
---
Jep. On all occasions.

Ah gotcha lol

I'm assuming you have the right perk cards equipped?

Sorry for hijacking this thread here, but you seem to have been around since release Oct/Nov when the game released. I pre-ordered on release for XB1 so I started playing late October. I stopped playing around Christmas time because I‚Äôll be honest, I was one of the ones frustrated with the state of the game and I wanted to wait for some patches to release and revisit at a better time. I have consistently been lurking in this sub waiting for that time to come, and I am just curious for your opinion. Do you think there have been many changes done throughout all of the patches? Would you recommend me start a new character and just start fresh? (Only made it to about lvl 29 on my run through). I‚Äôm itching for some Fallout again, but just want the opinion of someone who has been playing this whole time.
---
Agreed that the daily challenges need to be easier. I preferred when they were simple and could be completed with normal gameplay rather than needed to dedicate like 30+ min to each challenge exclusively.
---
That's the thing with the fallout community. Especially right now, it's like if its not a steam roll its trash and nerfed to the ground. The balance of the game is a joke with these weapons in their current state.
---
Being a conduit does damage you... That was the dot-damage you took.
---
I was on last night and it was so bright I had to look up and see if the stars were there to make sure it was actually night.  At the very least, add in a moon phases so it's darker some days and lighter others.  It would be really cool to see enemies off in the distance using torches and lights to get around.
---
This. If they change it, it needs to be optional. I want to see the game I'm playing.
---
They did this with the advanced power connectors. It's kind of awkward but also is dependent on the angle, to a fraction of a degree, in which the starting wall pass through connector or switch connector is places. It's a little aggravating with the entire process but it's nice to see the concept is available. 
---
I've seen a YouTube video for rounded walls or circular buildings, it's unique to be sure. The roofing system is a mess. 
---
All in all it would be great to see rounded snapping pieces. It's in there somewhere.
---
Wait. Bulk weighs less than loose? Well I know what i'm doing tonight. Bulk everything!
---
I believe the 2shot legendary modifier tanks the accuracy of the gun. Might want to pick up the perk card Skeet Shooter and see if that makes it more manageable.
---
Add a sleep bonus, cranberry bonus, friend bonus and rack in that xp. Idk if you wanna try this in the survival but that's a great place!
---
If you become the conduit yourself, you will receive damage. I always become the conduits because as you know, that timer is short. I don‚Äôt trust the other players and as long as we do the damage, I will use all of my medical supplies
---
Say what?? 'You said to find bodies and loot m8', excuse me buddy what are you on about üòÇ 
---
How you couldnt detect the sarcasm is beyond me but neither of your past two sentences even make sense, quit the dribbling and move on
---
A lot of the marine and combat drops I get are from the Queen. Awol Armaments has had some good drops for me if you get a decent size group doing the event. It will often spawn multiple 3\* robots. I run West Tek for steel and plastic but rarely get anything good. Nuking Harper's Ferry sometimes yields a decent amount of legendaries if it spawns mutants.
---
Lmao, happened to me too. The players seeing me working were confused for sure!
---
idk that just sounds like an asshole. most people appreciate the help
---
I got a 2* nocturnal explosive gattling
---
My first visit I got 2 laser pistols. Yuck. I'm a rifleman dammit.
---
WHAT
---
Strangely enough, I've only encounter radrats once per 2 hours. I thought they were rare or im just in a wrong region but mole rat sucks
---
Thanks, I'll have to check that out.
---
I got mine from the Event: Encryptid. One player gets down every 30 sec or so. You'll have good changes there.
---
Nop, i still use it too, but double barrels only, others hurt like a wet fart.
---
You need to make sure that you are attempting to tame random spawn animals - you cannot tame normal spawns or animals that spawn in groups or with enemies. In the case where both options say pacify that just means that creature is covered by both animal friend and wasteland wanderer. I would suggest looking up random spawn locations and server hopping exclusively there until you get the pet you want. 
---
RIP Elvis.
---
Whenever I have any spare quantum nades I use them as my stealth opener, especially in close quarters or indoors. Combine Grenadier and Fire in the Hole and most foes will be tasting the rainbow.

I guarantee you're not the only one who didn't know this. ü§£

They switched Deathclaws from animal friend to wasteland whisperer. I can confirm they can be tamed as I've tamed two since the patch - however I haven't run into a sloth at a random spawn to confirm if they are tameable or not.
---
Vending machine spawn is always the center of your camp. A lot of people have semi permanent camps and don't want to change them, myself included. Thus you end up spawning into a foundation block. Luckily for me, my visitors don't spawn in a wall and are only chest deep in a foundation. As long as the part of you (not sure how much) is above the foundation you can escapse and rise up.
---
Now im curious
---
Lot's of reasons not to accept team invites, this being one of them.  I just now got used to removing my locks as a courtesy to my customers.  I'm not going to let strangers or want friends to edit my camp.  I'm lucky that my teammates that I play with are respectful enough to ask if they want to add something I can't make myself.
---
This would be really fun imo - different colors or boxers / swimming trunk styles lol
---
Give me the mothman booty shorts and a pair of green ones that say RAD on the back
---
I would not mind this too much if it werent for the fact that my spotlights never work/always disappear
---
My camp is pretty permanent and I don't feel like a redesign. Luckily for me my visitors are not permanently stuck in my foundations. Once my camp loads, they rise out of the foundation.
---
I love it too much. It‚Äôs durability is great and sips ammo.
---
Seriously? God dammit. Good for the people that want that but wtf we desperately need new PVE content that is going to last. I feel like there is enough PVP stuff for now.
---
totally agree with this ive been selling cheap clothing and fasnacht masks so it looks like i have 60 armour but its the two machines full of clothes
---
LOL every time.  Look for the circular gazebo near the tennis courts and swimming pool.  There is a drinking fountain on the low wall surrounding the gazebo, drink it to cure diseases.  Inside the wall, outside the columns themselves.
---
Yep.  At the spawn-in point for the Golf Club, turn all the way around and walk past the tennis courts.  Take a left.  The structure in front of you has a water fountain in it.  Drink up and cure a disease.  Easy peasy.
---
Same bug here, happened multiple times during scorchbeast queen fight, when getting hit while shooting a plasma gatling.
---
Hitmarkers disappeared, and forced to use an other weapon.
---
That's exactly what I just did and how I got the idea!
---
That is by far the worst. Sorry. Better scrip it before it evaporates.
---
PS I don't know if I could scrip it. A part of me would hold out hope that it stays a 3*.
---
It happens so fast I'm just worried that my post won't be seen since it hits zero almost immediately. I'm still part of the Anthem sub and I'm really salty about that situation but I don't go around downvoting everyone, I just don't understand some people.
---
Also:  Casual Shielded still does not drop. And dense mods stopped dropping in February.
---
I'm glad I could help!
---
Yes that event is for sure the most complex. It really does take coordination between players. This is something new to the game. All other events can be solod very easily, except the queen. But the difference between the queen fight and the squatch is mechanics which the queen fight is just shoot and kill very simple. 
---
For the squatch, I've found it's best to have one maybe two conduits who pan around and avoid damage from squatch while everyone else kills it. The 3x conduit does a lot of dot. So if only one player is the conduit be sure to have a ton of stimmys. Other reports have indicated that the healing factor mutation and being 3x conduit being in hidden mode, the healing factor mutation can compensate for the damage from the 3x conduit dots. 
---
I'm not entirely sure how the aggro table works for this game. But the squatch for sure is random and can one or two hit most players, even in PA. 
---
Recall key cards are available at most vendors in the misc tab. But they're 2400 a piece with some high charisma and chems you can get that down to ~1700. Creating the new key card requires a fluorescent flux, so that's added costs that. 
---
I haven't seen too many pugs for the event because it is so time sensitive. Most pugs I've been in have failed. Miserably. It does require coordination between players and that's been a serious negative factor for this entire game. Players like to interact with one another but haven't been too keen on full time coordination. 
---
I suscept in future content more and more coordination will be required, which will put the game into a more sophisticated mechanistic approach to ensure higher player involvement and coordination rather than just being able to solo an entire multiplayer online game. 
---
That's my views on that I guess.
---
If you still need help I can join and help you

Thx for the detailed infos!

Rename your camera if this ever keeps happening. Worked for me.
---
Goddamn I just unloaded like 60+ on a vendor, I'd do them for just 2 a piece

I would love if they'd add some energy/fire resist parts so that I could free up my "fireproof" perk points.  I'd love to get back to using cola nut or something.

Handicap build maybe? Empath??ü§î

It won't.
---
chances are it's either an inside joke or an attempt to get this exact reaction out of you. Maybe a bad translation of a "handicap" or "crutch" build?
---
Ah. The ol' classic "I sit down to pee, therefor I am helpless" condition. I have that condition also.
---
The most obnoxious was in Destiny raids, when some clown starts mansplaining everything to me specifically. Then I have to shut him down, which automatically makes me a "bitch". Then I reverse explain to him everything he may have said that is completely wrong or missing details, due to my in-depth knowledge of the meta that is or ever existed, making me a "bitch". Then outscoring him and nearly everyone else or the wipe screen, making me a "bitch". Then getting chewed out for running my beloved Voidwalker instead of Sunsinger "in case I die", then never dying as opposed to everyone else dying constantly, making me a "bitch".
---
I don't raid anymore. 
---
I've found one cool dude online 6 years ago who is my permanent gaming partner in Destiny. I don't really bother trying to meet others anymore. But I play 76 with my husband, and we really don't know if we're going to bother trying with the raid or not.
---
I know.....but I wanna believe.
---
This happens to me all the time as well. Please fix!!
---
Few have figured out, yet, that Bobby pins are the one true currency of the wasteland. It is the equivalent of a life insurance policy or annuity for your character, when he is old and fat and rich, he will have enough Bobby pins to spend his days on the beach. 1400 caps with the click of a button, whenever he wants.  No weight, no limits, no brainier.

Just yet another generic post that doesn't really add anything. Some guy killed me and took my stuff waaah.
---
I use my shotty once my shells ammo amt hits over 1k. But it's annoying because even at point blank it seems like i have to target things with VATS just so that the mobs take any damage at all :/
---
I thought empath and herd mentality got a buff after this patch?
---
Thanks guys , got to check em out
---
I've been playing since the BETA and have focused on Forest quests specifically to find a firefighter helmet - one dropped last week during a Fertile Soil run, well after I'd given up grinding for it. I've heard a method that seems cheaty but very reasonable: make a new character and run to Flatwoods to complete the first Responders quest (the water one). There seems to be two chances for a cosmetic item to drop during that quest, and it takes a full 12-15 mins for a run from resetting to making the character to finishing the mission: this gives you the ability to run 4/6 missions per hour, and I've heard good things about finding responder drops this way
---
I had two pieces and would always jump of the roof of watoga hospital when I was done and took zero damage ( no bird bones).
---
and every post, too! :D
---
Well, Fallout 76 community is super toxic. 
---
First are the "good guys" and those who take it too far:
---
Some are Bethesda fanatics who can't tolerate anything negative towards the game and they mistake posts like these as such. I once asked help and some people commented that it's not game's fault if I am noob and idiot, when I made it specifically clear that my issue is that I DO NOT KNOW and can others help, yet people are blinded by hatred and they only read "GAME SUCKS BETHESDA BAD FUCK FALLOUT" when it really says "Hey dwellers, I don't know how to build second floor when I try to add floor on top of walls it doesn't place there" and instead of telling that I need stairs they downvoted me to oblivion and called me names because they obviously assumed I'm saying game is bugged.
---
Then the another side of the coin; Haters. Go and check Fallout's and bethesda's official instagram pages. So full of haters bashing the game when clearly none of them has never even played nor even knows what Fallout is about. they only heard game is bad and joined the hate train because it's popular and people are fish in the ocean; can only follow the herd.
---
And when someone gets downvoted they often revenge by downvoting other posts and comments which then spreads. From time to time I have seen every post with like -5 points and so on.
---
So it's not you, or your post.
---
Seen this happen with a couple who joined our party a while back..  We had split in two teams and were all on same server doing events together for awhile. Without calling tags, the guy's tag is basically "Joe Player" and his wife's is "Joe Players Wife".  17 year old in the group starts hitting on her and wasn't very subtle about it.  Joe finally says something like "Dude, I'm right here and can hear you. "  Kid says he never noticed and he was on *their* team.  We bounced him anyway because like you.... just damn.
---
I always keep that thang on me
---
Dataminers have shown files in game showing legendary power armor. If or when they will actually be implemented, who knows. But the files are definitely there.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea!
---
I have done this sooooo many times.
---
How old r u?
---
They need to give us a slider so we can set the darkness of the nights - if they changed it for everyone, then you will have people complain it is too dark, and others saying it still isnt dark enough.
---
Love farming the burrows my ghoul slayer handmade one shots everything down there
---
If you're tanking pylon/s, don't pursue the Sheepsquatch. If it pursues you, try to run and have it lose aggro. This is the biggest mistake I see players make. They die instantly because they can't tank the pylon damage stacked from the already very high Sheepsquatch damage. Once you die, the pylons will electrify again which stalls the event for a while until players can activate the pylons again.   
---
To guarantee the loot from the Sheepsquatch, just hit the creature a few times prior to becoming a conduit. Then let the bloodied builds do work. The more damage you do has no effect on your loot from the Sheepsquatch or the event itself. So work as a team!
---
I just won't do this event anymore. Fired up my first one while finishing the quest. Burned 50 stims and killed it only for the body to disappear. Spent longer looking for it than killing it. Never did find it. Not worth time or resources.
---
No. Fuck your opinion in particular because you are a special kind of garbage.
---
Auto handmade with commando isn‚Äôt too bad in my opinion.
---
Thank you. I'd feel guilty taking something you could sell. Especially when the issue is how I play. My biggest problem is simply I've spent so much time wandering the wasteland alone exploring the world that I've built up a character that is great for fighting general animals or solo enemies but it wasn't until recently I joined others in taking down a queen that I realised how my lever action just can't keep up and my other guns just burnt through the ammo. I'm changing my game play style to try and farm for more bullets/resources and try and join others in events hoping for my own legendary drop.
---
Shadowed? If you have clicked on it you should be able to build it on light, sturdy, or heavy chest pieces. 
---
Could be bugged.
---
I understans your pain :(

You see power armour behind the purveyor.. it‚Äôs comming

Sure pal

Do you have your armorer perk cards ‚Äúon‚Äù?
---
Yeah this would be great, the list of things we can craft is huge, but I only seem to make Corn Soup. Yum. Disease Cures and Grape Mentors Chem wise too.
---
WHY? They specifically updated to make it brighter. What they really need to do is put in a brightness slider so everyone can play how they want. I have a 55in 4k tv and no matter what settings I use I still can't see Jack shit at night. I use that time to cook and craft cause I cannot do anything else.
---
I agree,  I try that also,  with mixed results,  mostly no response.

Man this is a great tip. I know this post is old but figured I would add what I found after one server hop. I found a power fist, shishkebab, and railway rifle plan all one run.
---
Makes sense to me. However I am a little worried.. a battle royale mode with any sort of bugs, or imbalance, or even lag, doesn't generate interest and usually doesn't last long. Hopefully they fix a lot of these issues before releasing something like this or else it will likely end up being a dud.
---
When you go to the blueprint under the blueprint tab, is there a "store" option? This should dismantle the pieces into the "stored" tab.
---
Yeah and the moon is in the right phase and you had the right breakfast.  Otherwise it just does nothing at all, and you don't even get a message.  Try 2 more times and it could work.
---
Bethesda have been looking into a bug regarding melee where hits aren't being registered properly. I wonder if this comes together into the same issue.
---
Is it not cheaper on CD Keys? It's like ¬£10 on PC.
---
That's less than neighborly
---
well, fortunately this bug occurs on wood armor and nobody use them
---
aaaaand, easy fix for bethesda: since wood armor naturally have only one legendary slot, just remove them from the purveyor \*\* and \*\*\* leveling lists.
---
Close,  that IS the basis of the game.  RNG though, not teamwork.
---
I haven't been yet, where is it? I have a ghoul slayers black powder rifle with crit dam that mows  through whitesprings
---
What's a few Rads anyway?
---
I've been swarming Bethesda with complaints about these challenges. How can they all be so bugged? Hopefully tomorrow's patch will fix some things.
---
Weird cuz I always sneak shoot him and he disappears. Is it because I'm sneaking possibly?

The purveyor can‚Äôt take 150 scrip, literally doesn‚Äôt have an option for that

Mama Murphy build? Lots of drugs? Dunno.

I think they need to add mutant geese to the game. They could fly around in packs and then land and attack vault dwellers with wings outstretched.

They can't destroy bases anymore. Only if you attack back.
---
Ya your most likely right about the servers however give that spot 2-3hrs your time server hoping and don't engage in the random events i found my last deathclaw on maybe the 15-20 hop lol the grind
---
Only perfectly preserved pies work unfortunately, 1 every 3 steps he takes
---
9 perks in shotguns, 5 in demo expert, 3 in bloody mess. That‚Äôs my base shotgun build.
---
I am coming to the conclusion that all of these issues that come from the RNG mechanisms are due to Bethesda's manipulation of the RNH in order to maximize the addictive qualities of the RNG.  The algorithms they are using are in conflict with each other and result in "glitches".  The RNH is not sufficiently random.  Wood armour is probably 3 times as likely to roll as combat armour in spite of the fact their is three times as many combat armour variants (light, sturdy, heavy).  That is a manipulated random, that makes certain results more likely than others.  But then it is important to have a few pay outs every now and then to encourage people to keep playing .... trying to influence the random generator to not be random causes issues.
---
They just did what all the whiners wanted...whine about AA and it will be next. Pesky ass kids.
---
Gunsmith and white night are uselessly nerfed (repair kit anyone)... If you use vats concentrated fire is nice over long shot. Bloody mess should probably be on both builds also...pharma farmer is also very situational.
---
Grafton in general is a good place for me around that lvl. Supermutants galore and the quests there just spawn tonz of mobs to kill.
---
I just tag along with high lvls when i can. Im like the little brother with an unplugged controller.
---
ramps on that your CAMP of accessibility?
---
Yes let‚Äôs avoid a feature all together, why not. Maybe Bethesda didn‚Äôt mean to put it in there
---
Just go into the event area itself. Collision Course triggers whenever someone enters the area.
---
What build do you use? Might give us an answer to this inside joke.
---
Quad auto Tesla melts enemies.
---
Probobly would have your build similar to most shotgun builds. Standard shotgunner perks, skeet shooter, enforcer, bloody mess, etc. Only things id say do diffrently than other shotgun builds is run fireproof and possibly a dense mod on your chest piece, since your weapon is explosive. This way you avoid insta gibbing yourself if swarmed point blank. 
---
If your using vats a lot then i recommend picking up Four Leaf Clover, Better Criticals, Grim Reapers sprint.
---
Also chem fiend if your going the chem root for more dmg and you might want to consider marathoner since you'll more than likely be sprinting to get into range.
---
As for armor choice its entirely up to you, though power armor will chew through fusion cores if you use vats a lot,but still provide the best defense for up close encounters.
---
In general, anything should be able to be bulked...magazines, supply requisitions, ammo...1 cap for ammo is a joke...I would buy tons of .45 ammo if it we're four for a cap...would buy all day long, without question...at a cap, no thanks, pass Everytime.
---
I personally wouldn't hunt for all the ingredients even if they did buff them. It's to much hassle with everything else I do on the game but for those of you that do it would be worth it and I would support it.
---
Yeah I've got a yao gai that spawns near my base. Ribs are cheap and easy and some of the recipes require a lot of time and effort gather items for not much improved benefit
---
Only somethings weigh less. But it does make it so you can sell it to a vendor bot if you get too full. So change up space for caps!
---
Had this suspect...  Just want to know either it is intended change or bug. Thanks for an answer.
---
fool me twice...
---
Gat is always a great choice for weapon.  AA gat is pretty reliable murderer.
---
9 str points in the three heavy gunners, 3 in martial artist if you use gat (makes it fire faster), 3 in bear arms.  At least 2 in int-&gt;stabilized (ignores % of enemy armor if you are in PA), luck-&gt;one gun army is not bad.
---
Just point your face at bad guys, stand tall, and wreck them.  PA heavy Gat is one of the few things BGS hasn't (yet) ruined.
---
What fuckin gene pool did they fish you out of to be so aggressive about this
---
Suppressor level 3 and tenderizer level 1 can kinda make up for losing LW. You can also easily share tenderizer if you have no other card to share.
---
It's so annoying when this happens lol. They need to fix fast travel. Spawning inside locked houses, or off a freakin cliffside....both are annoying.
---
No scrip
---
Did you put weapons in machine or try to buy from the mole miner?
---
Oh yea. Get back in. Weather you start over or not i think youll be happy with the additions and changes. They even redid the airport in Morgantown. Player vendors are nice. Changes in carry weight and camp budget. New content. The wild Appalachia content is great. It still has a few bugs but it's really been smoothed out. I wish you were on the ps4 I would walk with you. Only way to know is to try!
---
Mods are the false excuse for real cheaters.
---
Besides, mods are working only because the game override framework allows them. If bethesda doesnt want mods, it's easier for them to disable the override than ban everybody.
---
You can‚Äôt trade at the vendor. You have to scrap them at the legendary scrapper at train stations
---
When I've seen a vender with free stuff I've taken I've always felt obligated to buy something from them. So it's a great sales tactic on people like me haha
---
Are you the mysterious stranger or savior?
---
That splits the player base and will kill the game. Its something you do when its on its way out.
---
Like what mods would you want? Prob not the same ones i want so we would never play together.
---
What?!
---
#This is where I comment that I can loot other people's railway ammo and they potentially get double returns.
---
selling fasnacht masks I had so many after the event because I would run it so much and pick up any masks people dropped. One mask is 55 caps so with tax I get 50. I used to sell the fasnacht plans for 300-400 caps each but they sold out super fast.
---
Bruh they nerf AA they better nerf Incisor, Bloodied, Talons, and Twisted Muscles...
---
Tired of them nerfing ranged, when they nerfed Two Shot, Explosive and Demolition Expert I took a like 5 month break. Just started playing again a few days ago.
---
You should play. I have not had any problems with other players messing with me and I have been playing since Beta.
---
Don't claim any workshops and keep your settings set as a pacifist and you are good. 
---
(If you claim a public workshop you opt into PvP so there is a chance someone may try and take it from  you).
---
i heard something about arms spawning in tree tops on the floor with hanging radstags.
---
Lol. My karma isnt exactly hurting.
---
I actually ran into one just today on the south eastern side of the map, first time in over a month though.
---
Another good question is why can‚Äôt I place the wood defense half wall in that spot next to the stairs? It‚Äôs smaller then the gap.
---
That.... would require..... the days to actually change....  
---
*\*points at your Pip-Boy's date readout\**  
---
^(\[bottom of the actual pip, or on the Data page otherwise\])
---
But yes, totally agree... to an extent. As someone who lives in this general sort of area to the game (Eastern Tennessee), not exactly near the big cities or any suburbs, a cloudless full-moon night isn't *quite* as bright as it is in 76. Which, yes, my TV is properly calibrated, and is probably a bit darker than what most folk experience. (In Minecraft, it was zero visibility for me, but everyone else could see fine at night lol)
---
True that. I keep grabbing more &amp; more stims out of the stash each time I see encryptid. I try to revive as much as possible as well cause one of the downed players maybe a conduit (they can hold it for the 30s downed timer).
---
I have 8 of the small ones, so I'm covered on water. I sell most of it to vendors for easy caps. My water is unlocked so others can help themselves, but I do lock my lead extractor. That stuff is worth a lot of time/money. And I picked and stay at my camp location for the lead deposit so...
---
It IS to that point for my friends and I. Bethesda is nerf crazy because they arent used to balancing PvE and PvP.
---
It be a one star by tomorrow
---
That would really hurt my feelings! I'd never survive irl fallout 76; even if I could survive physically (I couldn't), someone ruthless and manipulative would take me down too easily. I just want everyone to be kind and get along.
---

---
I was doing a the quest for the daidycutter
---
Have you seen how OP the drill is when built into with perk cards? I'd rather get drilled than get wood.
---
I kill her almost every day, pretty ez fight but I am not going to lie and say I don‚Äôt remember my early days when she was a struggle
---
Yeah, in my view this could be a very good mode or just a slightly different survival mode. It probably will set the game's course from here on out, if it's bad the game won't get any more popular, if it's good the game will probably make a slight comeback.
---
Happens to me across all weapon on XB1X, usually reentering vats or just switch to a different limb and back (with Concentrated Fire card I believe) fixes the issue.
---
I'm going to purveyor murmrgh and the x is greyed out over my legendaries. That isn't the way to do it? It was working for me yesterday when I first tried.
---
It‚Äôs a huge garage sale... 
---
Lvl 90 was selling regular non legendary weapons for premium prices, lvl 35 50 cal, 1200 caps... 
---
Another lvl 144 was selling a Resolute Veteran for 400 caps... (yes bought it) whereas I‚Äôve seen others go for as high as 5000 caps...
---
5.56 for 1 cap to 3 caps, big difference when you‚Äôre buying say 1000.
---
I don't understand all the downvotes. These would be balanced changes lol at least leave a reason.
---
Ah, and they appear to be white supremacists as well with their "the only solution" catch phrase. Fucking trash.
---
I feel ya pain, the struggles was real... üò•ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah I have this bug when using my 1 handed melee weapons, often happens when I am sprint-hitting someone/something in VATS. It's definitely annoying
---
Secondary caps

Agreed with the mats,and for the stairs, a spiral stairwell would solve some awkward building moments for sure.

I had a simikar issue with mine except I reloaded once, having 4 cores on me. It gave me 260 shots on that reload then it gave me 45...then 30...then 10...5...then 1. Like I don't understand how I used up 4 cores with basically 1 reload.
---
I wasted 3 hours yesterday at my spot and 3 today at yours and i haven't seen a single tamable,not the wrong one,total zero. The last patch must have killed the spawns because it's absurd.  Also i see event loading soo late

I used to have massive issues with crashing around the wasteland, entering buildings and at SBQ especially. The only thing that fixed it for me was deleting the fallout 76 save file which also removes your pictures and settings presets.

I always thought that they should have done a banking system like ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) that can accessed by all characters on a account.

Personally I think the vendor machines need there own stash limit so once you decide to sell an item it comes out of your stash (lesssening your normal stash limit) and goes into the new stash limit of the vending machines as I am struggling to get my limit down while I wait for the other items to sell, just a thought!!
---
Using the "follow me" emote to lead someone into your deathtrap C.A.M.P.
---
Yeah you will be able to have fun in this game. Unless your camp is at whitesprings it's really unlikely to get nuked, and even so you can just server hop to protect it. Hardcore players don't do PVP anymore, they leave that to the survival people. They are more likely to just give you free stuff that they have in their stash. It's a really nice game with a lot of community, with said community being one of the nicest I have ever been part of. And BTW, it's not called the wastelands, just wasteland (no S).
---
Can you imagine how bad the smell must be? It‚Äôs a pair of underwear that your character never takes off, even after:
---
- Running from deathclaws
---
- Swimming in radioactive sludge
---
- Contracting horrible illnesses and parasites
---
- Being sprayed by Mirelurk Queen acid
---
- etc
---
It‚Äôs been like this since the beginning
---
I can see why it would split the player base. But on the other side, it could bring back whoever left because of  no offline and no mod support. 
---
As far as mods go, I usually download weapon mods, quest mods, and mods that are considered "funny."
---
Down voting not because I hate you or anything, it's just not true.
---
It's incompetent game design, not intent, for 99% of people. Bethesda needs to fix this, but as it's been a problem since launch when traveling to friends camps...they probably won't.   
---
You fast travel in, and arrive before the base loads. Then the base loads around you, and they don't auto pop you up, and there's no /stuck command like most games where this is a possibility.   
---
If you can place a power armor frame, you can enter that to get out of any floor/wall/etc stuck situation.
---
Lol sometimes i get diseases just when a ghoul looks at me
---
Same I upgraded the perk where radiated food doesn‚Äôt affect me anymore? Thirsty? I drink it straight from the creek.
---
But very defensible, except of course for molerats.
---
I did it for the first time over the weekend, solo at 52 (well 54 by time i left), wasnt as hard as I thought it would be based on reading stuff on reddit, just need to manage moving and killing robots through each section - think the hardest part i had was fixing the pipes and finding them all in the time allotted.
---
I wasn't aware you could scrap legendaries at the purveyor. I thought this was only achieved at the scrip machine outside the train stations?
---
There is a bridge on the small river.Sunday brothers cabin South.You can build a bunker below
---
Speaking of vendors I hope they separate the player vending machines 
---
From you‚Äôre stash it would help with storage plus having them integrated with each other makes the layout kind of cluttered :/
---
Good point. I honestly couldn't quite remember 100%, but... that even furthers the problem!
---
It‚Äôs bugged.
---
I mean, I wouldn't call it "meta" but I also wouldn't kick it out of bed. Especially on that combo  you rolled. That'ed be great in queen fights, or in PVP.
---
I use it and cannibalism very convenient
---
I was just thinking the same thing...
---
Damn that'd be awesome. But you would have to keep a knife on you at all times so......maybe it would be good?
---
You‚Äôre gonna have to wait for Bethesda. The lack of polish and quality control literally leaks into every piece of this game üôÑ
---
Can you confirm drills and syringers actually come out of Momma Murrgghss?
---
They didn't nerf gunsmith, it's useful for rifle builds. White Knight isn't as useful, but not because of the nerf... Because as a stealth sniper you don't get hit often, and your armor degrades slower.
---
I'm not sure maybe I'm doing something wrong here? Basically I went to the purveyor yesterday with a couple legendaries and traded them in directly to him for around 70 something scrip. I went back today and now the option wasn't there. I'll keep an eye out for the scrip machines outside of train stations though.
---
sounds like a great idea to me since i do my scip scrapping and my vendor capping out at the same time would save some fast travel
---
Dysentery Intensifies
---
I'm just not rolling armor at all for the moment until they fix this bug...that'ed be a pretty sweet piece of armor. Super light, super stealthy.
---
Definitely read this as shitting and not sitting and was like, "that's a good idea"
---
I have the same issue, so annoying
---
They shouldn‚Äôt nerf anything, just let people play and enjoy their game.
---
Add in adrenal reaction not working when you have strange in Numbers, or empath/herd mentality also not working with class freak
---
Exactly what I told my boyfriend about the 30s downed timer. Also I just end up getting so many stims from doing the Free Range event alone so I‚Äôm always stocked up
---
Ate you part of EATT??
---
We should also see what our carry weight would be without any modifiers, eg weight reduction cards, armor, etc.
---
Not yet.
---
Hopefully tomorrow?
---
I think I'm going to run the second build I made so I adjusted it a little how's this look. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f335fe&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pr2pl2c71ar2an2ao0ae2a04lt2l71lu2li2l12eh2iq2ic4&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
Right on ‚Ä¶ but Shotgun Stealth build is a bit of an oxymoron. :-D
---
I did the whole proof of purchase thing and they said they would send out an email when they start shipping. Updated my ticket a few days ago asking for an update, but waiting for a response.
---
i have really bad RNG
---
The wendigo should have the key fragment. When I first did this I immediately hooped in Power Armor, which I don't use much. The wendigo isn't that hard if you have the right gear, but otherwise......[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWZIu0oLZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWZIu0oLZk)
---
Cranberry relish gives a +10ÔºÖ boost to exp, and until you find the recipe for that cranberry cobblers give a +5ÔºÖ boost. You should also be well-rested for another +5ÔºÖ, and if you head into Survival mode before completing missions or crafting large amounts of items/ammo you'll get an extra +20ÔºÖ from that as well
---
If you're a violent player you can clear through the Belching Betty, and then the Big Bend tunnel, and then the Glassed Caverns as you progressively level up; and if you're more peaceful then collect plans for guns like The Fixer or for rare guns that people would want to scrap and then sell them cheaply in your shop
---
Nope. Heard of them recently though.
---
Steps after implementing this:
---
-add a fiddle to the game
---
-PA user plays it
---
-Red sheepsquatch spawns to take player‚Äôs soul.
---
-killing red sheepsquatch unlocks a random golden chair-instrument
---
You can add a 4th star to a 3-star weapon by making it do a lot of damage against scorched (counts as a star).
---
There is no blueprint under that tab... it only shows under Stored :(
---
It was recently delayed again.
---
Apparently.
---
The base which I built using glitches Bethesda copy and pasted from FO4 (which still remain) and grandfathered in to people who still had said bases...
---
Notes from Bethesda say ‚Äúfuture update‚Äù Not next update... they are aware of this issue so chances are high not tomorrow...
---
UPDATE: On a hunch I disabled all mods... and no change at all.
---
I am interested
---
There is no chance you‚Äôre a programmer.
---
None.
---
I would say it certainly is, look at cost of shite ones.
---
I would love to see junk decor
---
Isn't that kinda how most shotguns basically look?
---
It would be a  nice ammo type actually but you have to get a mod for that type of receiver.
---
You on now?
---
You realize that if a set of rails is twice as wide as a tube, and made of the same material, it weighs as much right? It's about the quantity of the material, not the shape it is in.
---
And this is a universe where desk fans are all made of steel. The fatman is made of steel.
---
Anytime
---
That is why you buy them
---
That sucks
---
Smart man...shhhhhh
---
Lmao that is disappointing. Guess I've been pretty lucky so far.
---
Like at what time?
---
I‚Äôd like to not walk around like I‚Äôm blind lol. I equipped the Bright PA Headlamp for dark environments.
---
&gt; Wendigo 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo#Folklore
---
Human wendigos (cannibals)
---
In some traditions, humans overpowered by greed could turn into wendigos; the myth thus served as a method of encouraging cooperation and moderation. Humans could also turn into wendigos by being in contact with them for too long.[15]
---
You‚Äôre 25 years late man.
---
You buying Inert Flux too? ;)
---
Used to live there but had too many super mutants sniping my water purifiers.
---
It‚Äôs parked outside of Whitesprings. Sorry about the grenade in the passenger seat. And the fire.
---
Want some weightless wooden three star.... oh wait sorry I mean one star.... 
---
(Lesson learned, next time I gamble I make sure there‚Äôs enough scrip left with the Purveyor to sell that s**t back immediately)
---
Just don't play in survival, since I can only imagine lvl 50+ people there.
---
Ok buddy here's a tissue
---
Ya except I've bought more useless camp objects than wepon or armor paint cause thier so unappealing.
---
Now if only melee players had even 1/3 of that reach lol. Captain Back-pedal and his jump shooting is a bridge too far.
---
This game is FAR more enjoyable playing casually compared to hardcore. If you like Fallout 3, 4 and NV you'll probably like this, as long as you can stand every quest and plot being spoiled ahead of time by the fact no one survived...
---
It's still buggy and broken, but not at all like it was at launch. It still doesn't really have much endgame, but that's not a problem if you aren't looking for that type of gameplay.
---
If you can spare the change for it, it's a decent way to chill out for a few hours after a hard day. I won't lie, I was hoping it would be more, and was really really disappointed with the game but after changing(aka lowering) my own expectations and treating it as just a casual game my enjoyment has gone way up. But I also don't play everyday anymore so there's that too.
---
The entire consumables array needs a 'playability' pass. It is a horrible stat-altering bankruptcy case.
---
There is no benefit to complex recipes or drugs. 
---
* Complex recipes should, satiate **significantly** more and/last longer/buff more than simple food/tea/juice. 
---
* Drugs should have more benefit/impact that easy food ‚Ä¶ especially considering the risk of addiction
---
* Diseases should still have 25/50/75% impact for a duration (like 10 minutes) after a diseases cure based on a perk card. (Endurance)
---
More like Spider-man, "Everybody gets one".
---
Agreed, if done well I think a BR mode for this game would be perfect and would bring a lot of new players, furthering the life of it too.
---
Do you mean Monday 3am morning when you say Sunday night? If not, there's your problem.
---
‚ÄúJust hear me out on this‚Äù. This was suggested like an hour after these things released and isn‚Äôt even controversial
---
This is one of those things I actually think is a good idea but it is being rolled out in a haphazard way.
---
Spoilage is something that should need management. The problem is nothing you'd have to take time to farm is of significant enough benefit to bother.
---
My advice if you're looking to take pylons is to of course have high energy resistance, but also utilize perks to max out the effectiveness of your healing items.  I usually take at least two, and I swap in max ranks of Refractor (in Perception), Chem Fiend in Endurance and First Aid in Intelligence.  Using Chem Fiend and First Aid together really makes your stimpaks much more effective.  You get the initial shot of healing, then the residual effect lasts much, much longer.  Swapping Lone Wanderer in Charisma for Field Medic is also good if you're part of a team.  
---
I personally unload a dozen or so rounds into the Impostor, then jump on the roof of the shack, inject stimpaks and shoot at the mobs until the event is complete.  The goal of being a conduit is to not die while the other participants take her out.  You really can't do both unless your build is really, really strong.  You can either opt to let others take the conduits and act as DPS, or make yourself as small of a target as possible while maintaining your own health.  Grabbing pylons and running into the shack so as not to make yourself an easy target is nothing to be ashamed of.  You're helping immensely by keeping the boss vulnerable.  Just make sure you shoot it or hit it a few times (while it's vulnerable) to get loot off the carcass, but not so much that it starts gunning for you.  I swap out a few DPS perks in order to maximize my survivability as a conduit, so I just just shoot it sporadically to get loot credit.
---
If you find that your build is just not well equipped to handle a steady stream of energy damage, opt for trying to take down the boss as quickly as you can.  Once it goes down, the players acting as conduits stop taking DoT damage.  You're still helping everyone out.
---
Level 90 dying 3 times?
---
I am level 112 and tank her with my melee build all day?
---
Use maybe 3 stims (auto stim) and 4 rad away?
---
LOL
---
Very helpful post.  I have the ability to start it,  but I'm waiting until I can get a group of people together to complete the event. I commonly play only solo though,  so it might be tough
---
Blocked off area maybe for PA Legendary Vendor space? Fingers, toes and eyes crossed...
---
Could be a perk that tightens shotgun pellet spread. I think there is one in agility.
---
Well, if they ever figured out weaponized cockroaches, I think they'd then be the buggiest weapon in the game.
---
Definitely. It would bring some of fortnite and Blackout players who miss fallout or just straight up new players to the franchise
---
Ok here comes the overhyping
---
If I had an hour of sleep fro every time I was about to log off and get decent hours of sleep ‚Ä¶ **Death from Above!**
---
2 Hours later if have an hour of loot sorting to do before I can quit.
---
I "hate" this game.
---
Skeet shooter in P affects the spread of shotguns
---
Two-shot lowers accuracy and increases spread: I have a two-shot 50cal that covers an area very well but is pretty useless against one thing alone.  Have you tried the Skeet Shooter perk to help with the spread issue?
---
Their last inside the vault/9.5 patch notes said it would be delayed, no ETA.
---
I've done that too. Run across someone's camp. Check it out. Notice broken turrets. Repair them. Continue on my way.
---
What time? I don‚Äôt have a mic but I can beat the crap out of some robots none-the-less.
---
Oh hell no dude, the lever action is great! I have the plan for it, a skin for it, i use it all the time! Besides, i have so many resources in my C.A.M.P. that i couldnt sell it if i wanted to lol.
---
...I was asking you if you could confirm if it was a thing, as you made the comment on the subject.
---
I'd guess they were trying to make fun of you for not running an over optimized min-max build. And if you don't want to there's nothing wrong with that, some people are just assholes...
---
Nothing in this game requires an optimized build, hell I doubt you even need perk cards to get through all the content.
---
For a non speculative answer though you have to ask the person(s) who said it.
---
Whoopieeeee! Here's a cookie you elite Fallout player.
---
Sure, what time?
---
Found in treasure map loot
---
Super mutants make some pretty impressive contemporary art sculptures with the flesh and bones of their enemies.  Wrapping meat into a nice cube or hanging ball with repurposed chain link fencing shows some skill.
---
Sucks. But this is the kind of team-awesome that will save this game.
---
You just needed a Bat-Signal for buddies.
---
You know, that makes me think here should be a map wide "siren" that you can sound for caps to call for help from fellow vault dwellers.
---
I ran into this myself a few weeks ago.  Its bugged on XB1, I had 3 hard crashes in a row trying to enter it.  Dunno if Bethesda knows about it, I'd submit a bug report.
---
Yeah, same. I don't like people sending me invites.
---
Don't recall that. Yeah, it was laggy as hell on major servers (Archimonde was a nightmare) but outside of horrendous lag, the game functioned as it was supposed to. Fallout 76 did not.
---
I'm glad people naturally sort this out. First time I tried it, I was the only one who would even try being the conduit, but I always died pretty quick. Now every time I've done it since, I've been able to just focus on taking out the bots and going full force on the sheepsqautch the second that it can take damage. I've got some good guns so I haven't failed the event since the first time.
---
How do you sneak up on the Queen though? Gotta have all sneak cards, bonuses, etc. Stacked sneak bobbleheads when it was possible. I would've thought her PER would be too high to allow such a thing
---
There are lots of bugs with the scout quests right now, and getting photos to register in general is very difficult even when it's working properly
---
&gt;have 15 charisma, 15 intelligence, 15 luck all explosives character
---
&gt;need to have party to reach full potential
---
&gt;people like OP doesn't want shared perks and a free travel location on the map
---
bethesda needs to have a party search option
---
The Paperbag ~~Banana~~ Pistol. Stick 'em up!!
---
Joining your server now, GT Daemonizare
---
Why not just make the lights brighter? For us people with certain types of colorblindness making things darker would make it almost impossible to see at night. Even with my pipboy some places the dark colors blend together too much making it already very difficult to see at night
---
These work on the legs right?
---
Something tells me all of his mule characters are unclothed women lol
---
Oh don't get me wrong the lever action is my favourite gun and I love using it but I didn't go enough perks and I have non legendary version of it. I think I might need speed demon to improve the reloading because at the moment I'm only good in stealth and yet somehow my stupid ass is decked out in heavy armour thinking chameleon armour would always have me covered. As I said I screwed my character up heaps haha but I'm learning
---
No problems whatsoever on the ps4 except for the one where you have to get hit with a nuke
---
It‚Äôs as if that was their intent all along ü§î
---
You cant give legendaries to her you can only get scrip from the machines
---
Suppressor lowers range by widening pattern
---
1911.  AR15.  Saiga 12.
---
Suppressor lowers range by widening spread
---
I've killed more than 100 queens and it's bugged maybe 2 or 3 times.
---
It doesn't say which piece it applies to unfortunately.
---
You cant place a foundation so a real camp is near impossible
---
I can tank all three pylons with 555 energy resistance, the First Aid Perk and liberal use of Super Stimpaks. I saw someone else solo the entire event by swigging lots of Nuka Cherry with the Cola Nut perk. To also be able to apply damage to the SheepSquatch, I suggest a Vampire weapon.
---
Take skeet shorter perk and mod your shotguns with mods that does the best accuracy out of hips. Now your shotguns are like  Sniper Rifle haha, that's how I play with them :)
---
I found mods at modus but the didnt work for the leg, so let's hope it does
---
Do the Lyin' Lowe quest.  Final boss fight brings in people from all over the map, some of which WILL die.  There's a mad rush to revive people due to the scouts quest, but the boss fight definitely drops people dead.
---
you can take them out of your machines and reset the price, adding more is simple. just add more and set the price the same. removing some is the same as adjusting the price, remove them from the stack
---
this occurs only in like 5% of encounters, as hordeing doesnt happen alot, also the splash radius was reduced with the TSE nerf patch so this isnt a big deal anymore
---
Lincolns repeater rifle as the lever action rifle? May not be lore friendly but
---
Honestly bothers me more that we are always looking slightly farther down than we should be üôÉ
---
never knew this, I'll be more accepting of it then, sorry lol
---
thank u for the info
---
I blasted him with a full mag of my 50 cal for giving  me the big super :(
---
There are 3 slots (chest, arms, legs) and it's really a gamble each time unless you have all 3 slots of a certain mod, as they won't stack and you'll have 3 different piles.
---
I'm not. That's the only way you can view stats on and legendaries they might be selling.
---
Why does the material they make consumer desk fans from have any bearing on the material of a state of the art man-portable tactical nuke?
---
I'm still stuck on the first tier, revived an ally never completes, and the objective to clear Dolly Sods (assuming it means to kill everything in the area around Dolly Sods Campground/Wilderness/Lookout) which I've done like 3 times and nothing ever happens.
---
Activating a pylon makes you a conduit where you receive damage (literally his first line). When a conduit dies, the pylons deactivate requiring someone to activate it again. It's best to at least grab one conduit *unless* you're low on stimpaks or tend to die and forget to use one. Then it just makes everyone change gears and refocus on pylons.
---
For the fight, a cryolater is recommended for at least one person to use as a utility once he's vulnerable. This slows him down to make it easier to hit and his attacks are easier to dodge. Everyone else can do the damage.
---
The only other things to watch out for are the masses of suicide eyebots. They'll explode on proximity and they show up in groups.
---
I'd love to join and do a bit of RP.
---
Not me, I created a personal points system.  One point for each light I turn off, door opened, and shutter closed.  Five points for any amount of resources taken.  Twenty points if they are there running around frantically undoing what I did, then leaving the server.
---
I could see this.
---
I have a foundation with two staircases on it, below my base, completely ruining the look but I can't remove them because somehow my entire base will fall apart if I do.
---
They're just floating stairs attached to nothing, but they're now a vital part of my base that can't be removed, thanks to some jerk that joined my team.
---
you on?
---
That one took me a couple tried but I realized I had to have the nuke drop directly on top of me. It's easy to do you just need to be in the area where the nuke is dropping then look at your mini map and fine the biohazard symbol and then stand in that area and look up.
---
I examined lots of legendaries with out players being at their base.  Inspect doesn't always work but most of the time it does.
---
Unless i'm going to look at plans, I've pretty much stopped going to camps where the guy isn't sitting there, because I'm not going to toss 2-10k on a legendary I can't inspect. Oh, bethesda, will you ever do something that just works?
---
Wait when did bobby pins go weightless?  Used to be .1 lbs, then .001 lbs... is that considered 'weightless'?
---
Pretty sure Packaged food/canned goods don‚Äôt count as Meat or plant based. They are separate. So you should be fine.
---
i agree adjusting prices should have been a thing
---
I did at with my x-01 and t-51. I just took all the remaining pieces off and restarted the game and replaced them, that worked for about a week for me then I ended up using a paint from the Atom Store for my suits and they haven't dissapeared in a couple of weeks now.
---
Give it up Bran Stark, we all know it‚Äôs you
---
There's one right outside the door of the station where the purveyor is located. Are you sure you just haven't exhausted your daily scrip amount? It's 150 a day. If you're scrapping directly with the purveyor, check their scrip amount down the bottom right of their trade window. If you're using the scrip machine then it'll tell you the amount bottom right and It'll tell you if the machine doesn't have enough scrip on failed scrap attempt. Maybe they haven't implemented that same system as the machine with the purveyor, Just grayed it out so you can't attempt to scrap at all.
---
I have about 4 builds on my main, all using the same general special setup. I am primarily unarmed, but I am speced to run 2h and 1h also. Although not to my max potential, I prefer to run with traveling pharmacy so I only have the 2h and 1h cards at rank 2. I have also recently started to spec the toon to be able to run heavy guns for the queen. I am finding I like heavy guns more then I though and am slowly drifting away from unarmed. I am level 134 or so. 
---
Experiment and don‚Äôt get caught up in the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for a build. Have fun, because while it can be a pain in the ass to spec into something else, you can always change your perk cards around.
---
In that case, you'll definitely have an easier time finding one chameleon piece as opposed to 5 weightless ones. I bet if you posted something on 1 of the market subs you could find a piece for cheap, especially if you aren't overly concerned with secondary effects.
---
Explosive Tesla Rifle, is that even possible as a roll?
---
500 caps for a two-star anything is pretty low, much less a max level explosive weapon. 1000 would be a bargain for it. Itd be someone's ideal weapon
---
2-3 I believe
---
Do I really have to explain the lore and story of Fallout to you?
---
Only use them in dire need if I don‚Äôt have required junk to fix to 200%
---
weird, I run around naked with just a ski sword but never encountered that before.  I am also curious.
---
So that‚Äôs why my mine has straps while my male teammates didn‚Äôt üòÇ  He was worried it was going to fall down because he didn‚Äôt have straps!
---
But everyone needs my fachnsaut balloons to make their abode more cheery~
---
I want a pair that say "I'm SPECIAL!" across the backside.
---
I usually never end up buying stuff from those types of stores. They either just have garbage or overprice their legendaries that aren't even good. 5000 caps for a lvl 5, 1 star instigating hunting rifle? I understand people not knowing what certain weapons should be valued yet, but come on XD. Its level 5 for crying out loud, and 1 star.
---
My X-01 helmet disappeared over the weekend (I think), while I was exiting I notice a void, walked to the front of my PA and noticed my helmet missing.
---
I've been trying to do that for a couple of months. It let's me build it with the materials and then doesnt show up. It's just a bug.
---
I've done this. Probably last patch, but I doubt they changed it.
---
Always keep mine unlocked. Have so much water idk what to do with it.
---
As to \#1 I agree crappy design.
---
As to \#2 I agree
---
Bloodied builds are very useful at getting the I'm poster's health down, but they will be no good in holding the pylons!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve beaten tons of people in this highly competitive mlg shooter thanks to my repair kits /s
---
Viper flux is replenished easily and quickly whenever someone nukes the area around fissure site prime, and the trade-off is the multitude of bonuses the weapon has that OP mentioned
---
Tested with no mutations at all for base line then without cards and then with
---
Ultracite Gauss or Prime?
---
I don't even make anything anymore because of the pain in the ass of it spoiling. 
---
I only carry ionized meat now for ease.  Sure I don't get buffs, but it saves my sanity.
---
Because it would be real at that point lol
---
Hmm, I guess I'll ahve to revisit them again. After I find some more mod plans for them.
---
100...
---
ok...
---
thank you. My character goes through water like crazy.
---
Proof or GTFO. That read like some bullshit YouTube copypasta
---
Is this still available?
---
I must have scrapped a million of them but had to buy at least two of them.
---
Taking out enemies that you brought is just good manners, giving you free shit is another thing. Yes, it's just water and I leave mine unlocked but this just sounds douchy.
---
You seem to be missing most of the rifle perks.
---
Adrenal Reaction does sometimes work with Strange in Numbers, but it does occasionally bug out!
---
Its can repair an automatic heavy weapon multiple times after one trigger pull.
---
I cook the more complicated stuff, and eat it when I‚Äôm not in combat and at low health or hunger
---
Swap green thumb for master rifleman unless you‚Äôre collecting flux?
---
You have to remember less then 5% (generous number) of players will take the time to visit a trade reddit or Facebook page. So they don‚Äôt know what the going price is. All they see is how much they cost at the robot vendors and what they perceive the price is based on their in game experience and rarity.  
---
TL;DR There are 2 different pricing points in this game: Subreddit market/Facebook market and the Bethesda ingame pricing. Most people use the latter of the 2.
---
Just found your guide recently.  Very nice!
---
Got any plans to update it with scout armor?
---
Really? I usually use the full strength meds and sell the weak ones.
---
yeah thats a planter I was talking about the square beds we saw in the preview and got in fallout 4
---
I keep everything unlocked.  I made my camp like a rest stop
---
I think you're exaggerating. Most of us use Reddit mobile and hit downvote arrow accidentally. The community is actually pretty good compared to other subs imo.
---
perhaps. but if i spend my caps to come see you which incidentally increases my thirst. the least one could do was have a drink. good manners goes both ways with being a good host.
---
Currently, only if you're a completionist.
---
You can get badges by doing the dailies, so you can still get everything from the Vending Machines.
---
I've noticed this with the "flying" bugs specifically when right next to them. 0% in VATS, outside of it 100%.
---
Max out all of the rifle man perks. Pick up tormentor in luck and tenderizer in charisma
---
I gotchu girl. Upvotes for a great question and great answers.
---
Yea I've scraped so many wepaons that it's so funny I have looked at the possible mobs on the plans and went WTF when did I learn that, quite a few times. I know I don't have them all since I see a few from phonix that still say plan not known:plan. So I'll look again. Since I have over 5k of 38 and 3k of 44 sitting in the vendor @0 caps
---
I've repaired people's turrets if I see that they're broken.
---
Oh really? That sucks. Have you tried already?
---
I have that too I would but more but can‚Äôt inspect
---
what do you mean from vending machines? like mods for the backpacks?
---
no worries I'll be 6 pounds of unusable shit bombs lighter now thank you!!!! In the little bag they go
---
I wondered why my 3* explosive shotgun wasn't selling... A nerf is killing me price wise.
---
I got up Saturday morning and figured I had an hour, maybe two to play before my wife got up and I would have to start being productive. She gets up, takes a shower, and as she's wwlking back to the bedroom to get dressed I said something like "I'm gonna make a quick tour of some camps and then I'll get ready."
---
2 minutes later, "So and so has launched a nuke!" Welp, I guess a few more minutes of killing glowing bois won't hurt. Half an hour alter I'm about to log off, and I get a team invite from one of my only RL friends that plays, and since I haven't seen him in a couple weeks I accept, throw on the mic, and ask him what's going on. "I need to revive you for this merit badge thing." Sure, why not. I haven't done that yet either.
---
Just as we finish reviving each other, "so and so has launched a nuke!" Check the map and see it was dropped on Prime. Ah well, I'm probably already in trouble, what's another 15 minutes killing the queen before I log off. 
---
tl;dr: my short, 1-2 hour play session got extended "just a couple more minutes" until it became a 6 hour play session. Thankfully my wife is awesome and understands that sometimes you just need to decompress and hang out with friends.
---
If you picked up the quest telling you to go get the DNA without doing anything else at VTU, then its glitched - you'll not have the ability to turn on the power to analyze the DNA. Normally this pops up randomly in the bog when you fast travel.
---
You need to start the quest by reading the mission 099-01 orders at the fort, no other way to begin.
---
I'd imagine we'll need to complete a few to rank up once they add Squirrel rank
---
Why be shy? Just look around and maybe there are traders how really loves his job and do much for a good trade or costumer service. Ever costumer of my shop, gets a free Nukashine at my Cliffs Side Bar, to celebrate the Deal. Even if he doesn't buy something he gets a free one. Many players love services like that :)
---
So just look into peoples camps if they're there ;)
---
Every publish needs to jump on that pvp band wagon for battle royal apparently but yea was datamined and currently a few hints have been found in game currently without data mining , they look like orange stash boxes and I know two of them and they have audio recordings. Also you need to do it to unlock all content in game since things are locked unless you play this mode.
---
It gives you something to do.
---
I‚Äôd question a few of your 1 pt perks in perception.  I run this so perhaps easier to comment on why I like it:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f246fb&amp;d=sb2p02pd2pk2pp2pl2ek1c72ar2ao0a04a32l71lt2lk2lv2i12ir2a72&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2345cf10
---
Had not played sniper for awhile.  I‚Äôve started rotating characters each week to shake things up, and this is still a pretty solid build even though I haven‚Äôt played in a few months on this character Comments:
---
To me perception seems to be required 15 for perks listed.  The long range I have read only works without VATS, not sure how truthful that is, but I don‚Äôt miss it.  Also makes it easy to swap to an auto build without much perk changing (ground pound and 2 pts on each auto rifle, with conc fire and tank killer)
---
Agi I switch out action person and the stealthy sniper boost on occasion, but honestly anything that doesn‚Äôt go down in one shot will for sure go down in 2 (with obvious exceptions) so this seemed to be an easy thing to avoid.  Gun fu is so great btw.
---
Int is iffy.  I‚Äôm running nerd rage/fa but I just picked up an explosive lever and am debating what to do with int.  8 for rage/demo, or just demo, but what to do with that lone point?  Perhaps endurance...
---
Luck also I rotate in grim reaper sprint and am testing 4 leaf clover.  I so wish I could do 15 luck Bc there are so many great vats perks, but I can‚Äôt convince myself to sacrifice agi or per, and the others are at bare minimum as it is.
---
High capacity, refrigerating etc
---
Yes sir I picked up a bloodied swing speed reduce weight one yesterday so they are definitely in the drop pool now
---
No, but from what I saw they aren't super easy to install. I rather not mess with game files atm
---
You have to be heavy on the trigger with it but what the hell it plentiful.
---
They were thirsty.
---
I will trade you a 3 star bloody grog for it
---
/r/therewasanattempt
---
To be honnest even when I have resource nodes I leave them unlocked. My camp uses powered doors and when I have purifiers they are unlocked also. Only time I locked stuff is when I was free out of the vault
---
how do you get those?
---
NO! Wait! They got the idea from **me**, I just didn't vocalize it anywhere! I think Beth is listening to me when I play the game.
---
I'm not trading it for any lol
---
Sounds like we would be the perfect team!
---
Or i could not worry about it because the threats will despawn when you leave, or supposing you and i are there together (why else would you be at my camp) i can just kill them.
---
yah that would make sense...you think if you do em in advance they'll count? I would think so right
---
I don't blame you ive dreamt of legendary bone hammers since i found one at lvl r5
---
From a Yao ming or guai
---
I can be, just a sec
---
Yeah same here I'm not a melee build so I just keep it as a thing to mess around with
---
Free shit isnt just good manners. Some people sell water.
---
And here I was trading scrip for garbage ranged weapons!
---
There are upgrades to the backpack such as armor plating, refrigeration and high capacity.  Once you unlock all of the mod plans I suppose there's not much incentive to keep getting badges but until then there's upgrades to hunt.
---
Yeah
---
I‚Äôll get skeet shooter.  Just all things being equal the TSE doesn‚Äôt compare to the double barrels.  It sucks.  I‚Äôll take the suppressor off and see if that helps.
---
He means at the scout camps there are tadpole and possum vending machines to use the badges.
---
Cant add u...
---
Psn dj5150119 
---
Mention FC
---
I have 3x max rifleman and max tank killer. Bloody mess maxed and covert op maxed. I use this with a suppressed instigating gauss rifle with 25% faster rof. Hits for over 1200 which feels like plenty lol. Hope this helps you a bit.
---
Campfire quest at camp Adams north of Poseidon plant.  Pops at night.
---
A couple of the possum badges are nearly impossible to complete though. Musician is bugged.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing a visual quirk where people in their beds or chairs look like they are standing and their legs are going around like in the old cartoons, maybe it‚Äôs that?
---
Its super fun cause it only needs bone to repair the cheapest material ever
---
Given how many of them are currently bugged/broken, I don't really know. I'm just waiting to see first before wasting time on them
---
Remember this is a Bethesda game. Just like survival is in beta so is player vending. If you look at it in this light everythingakes sense.
---
I do agree the interface and functionality could use some tweaks. But with each tweak we get another bug.
---
Oh you know - bring a bottle of water with you and don't be reliant on others for your own survival.
---
I do that shit in real life man, come on.
---
Nope.  I'm all about showing up to people's camps, saying hi or something and then seeing what they got.  Met a few cool people that way.
---
Pretty much
---
I consider the free water a complimentary gift for you stoping by, and perhaps not finding anything you want.
---
Yeah, thats my thinking too, bashed out the easy/fun ones over the weekend myself just in case
---
Right!
---
Dad?
---
Glad to hear it‚Äôs working for others, but mine clearly isn‚Äôt working. *sigh*  So much for my dream of joining the Seneca Rocks Freefall Club. :)
---
Do you have a source for the max damage per hit being 190? 
---
This is the first time I've seen this, and can't find anything else about it.
---
I also get stuck zoomed in sometimes and can't pick up anything. This has been a problem forever. I hope the recent gatling fixes doesnt mean theyre ignoring this one.
---
oh no way, cool ill check it out
---
I could give up like this because I too have had the body disappear or I got things for rewards that I didn‚Äôt really want BUT I like to say, ‚Äúyou never know unless you try‚Äù. 
---
But I get your frustration and it does really suck when the body just disappears
---
I'm lvl 211, so probably not your guy, but have taken a little bit of time out of my daily play to help a few other players out with their quest for a backpack.  I made a handful of bleedout syringers with short scopes and given them away, let me people heal me after I take off all my armor, stand in a river and shoot my feet to death with an explosive rifle, made s'mores for people, given away extra Sugar Bombs, etc.  
---
If you need anything, my name on PC is Shankwell.  I'm more than happy to help you out if I can.  Send me a friend request.  Helping others is probably my favorite aspect of the game.
---
what is this?
---
If they pick your locks, they become wanted, if you have turrets, the attack said wanted player and after this the wanted player can attack back.
---
sorry yeah Monday at 3am
---
I'm in. What time?
---
yah they looked tough
---
I usually have to fire a few shots to get it to spawn.
---
Since I have a lvl 45 combat rifle I think I'll go ahead and put a 38 auto receiver on it. Since I have 30 perk points I haven't spent. I'll just spec out commando and see if my AAE +ffr +weight reduction will serve as a disctration from my shotgun/Melee/hvy build I'm currently running
---
Yea that happens on all of my weapons....
---
*gleefully giddy*
---
I'm a bit further along the line!
---
what time zone are you in?
---
okay guess i'm wrong then. /s
---
3 People, 1 google auto-translate, endless confusion.

*Coming to cinemas near you in the fall*
---
Yes!! Nuka colas are great for this! Exactly what I do! Thank you for posting this, totally forgot!
---
My all rise went up to 8 pounds with the last patch. I do believe it's a mistake that needs to be fixed.
---
most likely 10 central standard time
---
I personally eleminate all threats. And if you need water there's some in the machine.
---
Search through the fo4 theory crafting, nothing has really changed regarding criticals.
---
That being said I have found that most of the critical perks become limiting in returns as your luck score rises beyond 15. I run a unyieoding vats build and have a luck in the 30s. At this point I don't need four leaf or any of the other crit chance perks. I still fill a crit bar in a few shots.
---
Some mods, yes, but this one you literally copy a file into a folder and edit your falloutcustom.ini file to load it. Super easy.
---
Quick question how do you make ultracite ammo?
---
Got like 60 of them and just giving them to the robot vendors.
---
I was hesitant to buy this same mod thanks for responding! Happy burning
---
You spend like 5% of your AP points, and 3% regens on your fall back down. Its really not a spend some to get some situation.
---
Here is the upbeat swing song from the Speak-Easy Jukebox.
---
[https://youtu.be/dMBD5mP7FPg](https://youtu.be/dMBD5mP7FPg)
---
Wear a mask, that might help.
---
No no no, I'm getting hot markers. No damage.
---
Oh. My bad.
---
I did 5 of them to get my armor plated plan, but to do 5 more is going to take a small miracle. :)
---
There's a lot of harmful stuff going on at that event. Activating pylons causes a dot, standing in fire hurts, being shot by protectrons hurts, being shot by anti armor gutsy really hurts, being hit by the imposter kills. All good fun.
---
Yikes. Can't Bethesda release just on piece of DLC without game breaking bugs? At this time the answer appears to be no.
---
I see Dense at the Watoga bot all the time
---
Eastern US
---
I feel like its a tad too dark now at night, cant see anything when I'm playing in a brightly lit room. Maybe I should turn up my brightness.
---
I always do the question emote. 
---
My favorite is when they badger you to trade, request items you use, then get mad when you don't wanna trade them. Lol. 
---
Granted some people just like to admire outfits and character design and like to get 360 view of the outfit - another reason I wish there was more emotes since I feel like most of the basic functions in the game you can communicate with them fairly effectively.
---
Screw them, I'm selling them stuff not feeding them for free :) All they do is browse my machines hang out at my camp not buying anything and drink my water. I'm not the apocalypse version of Barns and Nobles cafe.
---
Lol I'm specced commando and NEVER use my best guns...been running around trying to burn up plasma cores for the last week. They just won't go away.
---
Yeah I got a bloodied one the other day with script, I regret trading it in for script
---
East coast. (Florida)
---
I should have been specific:   Combat armor dense disappeared
---
Yeah, its not a race anywhere just have fun
---
PA SMASH! PA MAKE SCRAAAP!
---
does 10 central time work? (11 your time)
---
I did that super low level too. However i had 5 plasma grenades. Turned that cave into a wendigo rave
---
Yup. Sometimes ammo for me but definitely fast traveling. I also have been using the money I get to come on here and buy myself or my bf rare outfits I‚Äôve always wanted and player vending has made that possible for me! Very thankful to have it
---
does 10 central time
---
work
---
I might lock one (otherwise I get cleaned out constantly) but it‚Äôs nice to have a few purifiers for thirsty guests. Gotta offer someone a drink when they come see you, right? :)
---
each night in game, you can spawn an event at camp adams to gain possum badges, sometimes
---
I will say my purifiers are left open and ready for whomever, not like I'm going to miss that water when I eventually come home. 
---
But when I am at someone else's camp and I sneak off some of their water and run away, I fee like I done stole something.
---
I can do 11 eastern
---
Friendlies in survival? I always got shot on sight when the mode was new. Has it settled since?
---
I‚Äôll help you out later this week I‚Äôm super busy but each keycard is a nuke
---
Only game where a shotgun can just curve every bullet away from the enemy in front of you with none of them landing. They're designed really weird. Throw in Two Shot Explosive and you better be at self-damage range to accurately hit anything.
---
Also wanna continue to mention Energy Shotguns need to be able to use Shotgun perks...
---
ah, you are right its always the Marine armor mod
---
If the SB would even be that close though.
---
As far as I know you can't get drills or syringers. Never seen either with legendary effects. That being said it wouldn't surprise me if they somehow put them in the loot system for her since wood armor can only have one legendary effect normally.
---
May I ask what challenge? (Can‚Äôt really play that much now since of real life problems :/)
---
you never know with r/fallout eh
---
It's the survival team challenge, get a legendary weapon
---
okay cool. message me ur psn. I need to get a nuclear key card but that‚Äôll be easy
---
Psn is onepompousa55
---
Slightly off topic but a sniper style skin for the gauss rifle would be great.
---
Yeah, I play solo 99% of the time. The first time I teamed up with a crew was while at Whitesprings. They ( there were 4 of them) invited me, all higher levels ( I was a lvl. 70 ) I had no legendary anything, a shack of a camp but I had a steel extractor and was sitting on a pile of steel. I let them craft a 1000 rounds each and was given a great set of armor, brick building plans, modded t-60 armor and a fusion generator. I don't go looking to play with them every time I'm on but, we all did the imposter sheepsquatch event together and then later the real sheepsquatch event. So all good stuff but, when I get an invite and can't even see where on the map they are it's junk. It has to be right?
---
Fool proof way to get a camera in likely minutes - log out at wavy's, then log back in; walk about 100 paces forward and if there isn't a dead tourist next to the car in front of you, repeat.
---
Took me 3 jumps.
---
You don't need to. The event is announced to the whole server. Within 1 minute everyone (or at least, enough people) will arrive. Just hide on the roof until they do.
---
If people still don't know, you can use the camera to find the Sheepsquatch body if it moves or disappears on death.
---
Like the idea of wepaons skins.
---
When you add them + Bethesda = skins like
---
1. Airsoft bb (-90% damage to everything)
---
2. Plastic guns ( one use exploding removing said gun from inventory)
---
3. Moder weapon skins ( with included bug that they all do 15 damage and are chambered for 7.62 x 51)
---
4. New shimney skins (gold plated) that causes the gun to appear invisible and the shot comes out your mouth.
---
I have no issues with adding skins, but let's wait for Bethesda to fix some bugs fist please.
---
I think that‚Äôs my 11? Not sure. Psn:is jafar_quenton_7 just in case.
---
Oh, okay. That's odd then... it always resets with vendor caps for me.
---
Crap, is this in demand? I just offed a 3* in the exchange machine...
---
Reminds me of the [Sexy Lingerie ](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/1064245) mod from fallout 4
---
Thank you, ok in that case I think I have 8 nukes to launch lol
---
it is! yeah that‚Äôll work
---
But then they couldn't sell us skins!
---
There's a lot of stuff going on in this event. Taking all 3 pylons is required to be able to damage the imposter. Each pylon puts a (stacking) DoT effect on you that can't be mitigated in any way (that I'm aware of, anyway). So bring lots of stims, and usually best to have a NON low health build take them. Usually 1 person per pylon, but an organized group may stack all 3 on one guy and have them go hide and stay stimmed.
---
There also seems to be random fire patches that get released;  I still haven't figured out the deal with those, but they seem to be an AoE DoT. The Imposter herself is like a souped-up Assaultron, so her melee is brutal and her head laser is a death-star.
---
Add in the endless bots (including some of the nasty colonel gutsies, and the eyebots explode when killed; this can be used to your advantage if you can gun them down early, as they'll hurt other bots and you can often trigger a chain of eyebots to explode and kill the whole group of them) and it gets pretty chaotic.
---
i can make like 32 diluited ones with just 8 so i don't run out of stimpanks and the radaway i need diluited to not supress my mutations
---
I have heard mixed things on this... Although I notice it does increase small amounts BUT with player vending I THINK the items in the vending machine take up some budget as well. So it's hard to get an accurate reading on it. 
---
Another reason I want a % of total budget used rather than a simple line bar.
---
Just reach build limit and no one can build or remove anything
---
buy cheap serums and selling them higher priced next to whitesprings.... its like the stock market but better.
---
i find this really funny, as you made like, all the same mistakes as me. I am clad head to toe in chameleon/weightless armor, using my non legendary lever gun, and it never occurred to me to get speed demon. Everyone has there own play styles, and all you need to do is take a look at yours and see where itll take you
---
i did. they lost their range with this nerf. they are only good at close quarters.
---
Scrapper + WestTec
---
Perhaps a sliding metal door so I dont have that one wall made of brick perhaps?
---
It seems it would be an easy thing to have a "Team Settings: Allow team members to build in your C.A.M.P. yes or no"
---
My good in-game friend calls Wendigo "winnebagos", on purpose.  I find her humor hilarious.
---
Still bugged
---
So no one has any solution to this bug ?
---
Is it because we wear stealth armor ?
---
Remember to turn pacifist mode (non pvp) back off if you do engage in pvp or even switch to survival mode. You still need to manually turn off pacifist which is super dumb
---
I didn't downvote  you, but I absolutely despise the sheepsquatch event lol.   Others who have my mindset may have downvoted you just for posting about it, which would be a dick move.
---
k ill add u later
---
Getting upgrades for the pack or getting some new camp merch
---
You could have that..
---
I said give you the ADJUSTMENT of camp size and shape footprint.
---
I tried to do the hound and behemoth challenge last night, and there must be a radius on how far an enemy travels from a spawn point because I couldn‚Äôt lure either of them close enough to each other to get the pic. The only way I see it happening is if a pack of mutants randomly spawns near a behemoth and what are the odds of that happening?
---
Ill buy or trade to get a bloodied one or bloodied with swing speed if you see another one
---
Well they do let you put a silencer on it, which is funny. The penalty is massive though.
---
If you're a plant farmer, get carnivore anyway.  You'll get the benefits of the plants, you'll just get an even better benefit from the meat... and without trying I always have plenty of meat to cook.  Just kill stuff as you come across it and pick up the stuff.
---
plz plz plz save me and fix this xD. i dont think it was like that when the game first came out.
---
these days when you lock onto something in vats, you can be toutching them and not be able to melee.
---
therefore its better to simply not use vats for melee which makes combat a little clunky at times.
---
ty for addressing this! :)
---
I would but alas I'm on PC. I usually run at least 1 a night if I can.
---
You don't know how to read
---
Ill buy or trade for a bloodied or bloodied swing speed if you see another one
---
I'll have to look thank you
---
Maybe I misread it wrong but whatever the price was for the 3 star ranged legendary, lol I‚Äôm not posting this out of spite
---
Are you coming right now or just wanted to add me?
---
It's not even in my list to craft
---
Damn. It's all good.    Do you happen to remember where you found the plan like what event or what area of the map the event was in the even
---
I once saw this camp near vault 76 that had about 20 maybe water purifiers, all locked, level 3. I didn‚Äôt really understand why they did that considering they were a level 300 and something. 
---
On the other side, I understand people having maybe 1-3 or some small number like that locked. Not even gonna bother. 
---
I don‚Äôt lock anything of mine because I‚Äôm a high level and I‚Äôm not too worried about anything. Now, when I was a lower level, I locked EVERYTHING. Just simply because I didn‚Äôt really know a whole lot yet. And I‚Äôd get people coming up and threatening to destroy my generator or whatever because I wouldn‚Äôt let them in my house. Weird people man..
---
I'm coming. My camp was destroyed. On my way
---
Bought a 3 star from mole miner, nothing popped up and then I got disconnected from server. I checked again and all the scrip I had was pretty much gone.
---
So weird this is what I was trying for two days about 2 hours each day and never found them
---
Well I disagree. I like to cook up food for the buff of melee or crit damage etc.  I like the seared venesen not sure of spelling and the yaui guai ribs and mirelirk one as well. But nothing taste better than a scorched beast steak, lung or brain. Considering all the ammo I‚Äôve used since the game has come out I enjoy every single bite!!!!!     :)
---
Sure :( what do you want from me? I honestly did get disconnected right after purchase of a 3 star legendary ranged weapon
---
I'm Ps4 otherwise I'd help you find one since I'm a tad bored at the moment.
---
Ah good think I have keycodes then lol
---
Paddleball
---
I can help you now. My gt is stoj1710 and I was planning on launching a nuke now.
---
I downvoted because your answers are already out there. Just need to do a quick search.
---
alrite, last bit of questions, do only possum badges reward backpack mods? and also, where the heck is/ are the vending machines? the only one I can find is the one in front of the pioneer scout camp by the bulletin board...sorry for so many question just trying to understand all this lol
---
Damn. Thanks!
---
The nerf to explosive shotguns killed the range on them. Past that range of 72 they drop off incredibly hard.
---
I used explosive shotguns for 600+ hours and have entirely dropped them. They just suck at any range beyond close quarters.
---
Just stay in the Morgantown area and wait for the three events (FTP, BOB, CC) to start.
---
The kiddie pool at the back of wavy willards water park has about a quarter inch of water in it.   Run in there with a buddy past the scorched and straight to the back by the big rocks / pool and stand in that pool.   Very easy right there.
---
That my good person is an understatement.
---
Yeah...I regret selling my 1* quad tesla.
---
The last psychopath I accepted a friend invite from still stocks me, it's been 3 months of continued harassment, it like a bad blind date, where you try to let them down easy, and they think you are bonded for life.
---
I have calibrated monitors and it's pretty darn dark at night.  Most people do not have their brightness &amp; contrast set properly.
---
Umm buy everybody's legendaries and gamble at mumbles?

"Whitespring bots not attack nearby player when vehicles explode if the player didn‚Äôt cause or add to its explosion. "
---
 Get a better teammate or teach them how to shoot.
---
"Instanced loot so that opposite level players get something close to them"
---
As long as each person tags the mob it is instanced. Only time I haven't seen it is in a nuke zone or event like sbq.

"a player accidentally strikes a whitespring bot to allow them to holster their weapon and not cause them to fight said player. "

---
I was going to say this, but you beat me to it.  You are correct.  That extra piece of junk is what you would see when you have the scrapper perk active.
---
I used to fear the sheepsquatch, then i discovered the powerof  bloodied/unyielding and now i can kill charge and kill it in 10 hits or less (i counted). And it can kill me in 2, but i swing faster

My characters randomnly grow beards as well. They are clean shaven normally.

Yea the same for me. It resets 20 hours after the first vendor interaction.

1: tadpole badges unlock the backpack, possum badges are for the upgrades
---
2: There are two vending machines on each side of the bulletin board, one machine for each type of badges
---
side note: there are two camps, Camp Adams which is west of the giant teapot, and then Camp Lewis which is east of Grafton
---
I'm looking for an AAE Gat right now. But I totally agree, my little AA gat works wonders.
---
Another thing I have found odd is for the last week or two my wife's vendor caps have been resetting a full hour or two after mine. They always used to reset about the same time is this a known bug or is the reset time for regular vendors the same for everyone? Thanks for any help in return
---
No worries thanks bud I'll try some more
---
I did the same thing but I used the poisoning syringer (I don't remember which mod that is...but the one that does poison damage)
---
Bos events treasure maps, sbq drops. Player vendors.
---
And yes you can craft all t series my main can craft a full try most of type and head and chest for t51.
---
Pistols are trash currently so everything is better. I need to level my alt 20\~ times to respec out of them. :(
---
They use the same bullets Rifles use and just wastes them by needing to fire more often at far less damage, and the only Pistol type that seems to kill anything are Pipe ones which are basically slower rifles and if you aren't doing headshot crits with Pistols you basically do nothing. You also need perception for VATS but AGI has all the perks for it. ;s
---
I‚Äôm fine with spoilage but I shouldn‚Äôt *need* good with salt to make it last longer than that event that just popped up
---
Nice reference! Is Castle Rock in WV?!?
---
Man, I thought my game was just being funny when it did that to me too. They changed it? That‚Äôs kinda dumb imo
---
Yeah, but reddit rules says "no witchhunting".
---
dude im so dumb, I just found it. thanks for the info though big ups
---
lol?
---
I did the same thing and when I realized what was happening I ran down the hill never planning to go back. But then I heard a bunch of commotion and checked my map. The whole server was now up there taking care of business. I get back up, took care of a pylon, got a shot or two in the robot and the thing died and disappear ed in the pool of water. Other times I've tried it the situation has been chaos resulting in a failed event. The only other time I was able to complete the event was after teaming up with some good guys I met at Whitesprings where we planned who'd do what.
---
I.... didn‚Äôt actually know this. I knew I could do it in some places but hadn‚Äôt clicked I could do it everywhere.... oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I honestly just want to have like a repair shop of sorts since I've invested into the 200% repair perks on power armor, weapons and armor
---
That's what I was going to say.
---
I have a T45, T51, T60, X01 and a Excavator üòé I have the X01 and Excavator on me while out on the wasteland. I only wear the armor when needed. I would love to display the armors at my camp! Hopefully Beth can work that out. You have to work on stash and bulk your items..

Is that sent marine LL also assasins? The one for 10k

---
They have perks that increase the effect of food and drink.
---
I live on corn soup and raw melons, primarily.  Raw melons are some of the best food you can eat with Herbivore mutation.  They're actually more beneficial if you don't cook them, but they weigh a lot.  I have two melon plants in my camp that I just eat straight off the vine when fast traveling back home to top my food/water off.
---
I did discover during my adventures with the Tadpole cooking badge that Brain Bombs don't expire.  It's a great food item, but acquiring the ingredients really isn't worth the time.  You can make a bunch all at once if you're willing to devote stash space towards saving all the irradiated Sugar Bombs you can find, traveling to Big Maw to get loads of brain fungus, then travel to the complete opposite end of the map for Mothman eggs, pop on a three rank Super Duper card and craft as many as you can before your eggs and fungi spoil.
---
I still have yet to ever make a Fasnacht donut or sausage.  The ingredients require way too much effort for no special payoff.  I honestly don't ever expect to make a Cranberry Meatball Grinder unless I happen to get three pieces of scorchbeast meat by accident.
---
Complex recipes shouldn‚Äôt spoil. Some of them take significant effort to craft.

My Sniper alt 1shots everything with 95% accuracy VATS headshots from 9000 miles away and he's not even using a legendary. It's just a Lv.50 "The Fixer."
---
This is a knife.    :)
---
Sadly, I am all out of Hella Flux The only Flux I have left is Dude Flux.
---
Way too many bugs.  This one will wait.
---
The silently floor slithering ghouls or spawning standing/walking dead  of Whitespring will need to be fixed first, as well as a number of other RNG issues.
---
I remember being at top of the world train station, level 19, and and i heard the roar and ground shake, looked out the window to a sheepsquatch lvl 50 hanging out up on the rocks, so i proceed to shoot him approximately 800 times with a sniper rifle for about 20 minutes until he died. The half health enrage to full health had me yelling "OH COME ON!"
---
All I got was some quills, some meat, and a broken rifle from it.
---
You're not licking him to death, are you? ;)

You're having trouble counting to 10?

Walmart will absolutely pricematch their own website (as long as it is something being sold directly by walmart).  I've done it.  I too have had problems with their staff not knowing this and I have had to educate them on their own price match policies by making them (or making their manager) bring up the price match policies on the Walmart website where it says what exactly they price match.   Walmart will also pricematch Amazon now (and they have for about 3 years...shortly after the time that Best Buy started their own price matching policies for Amazon and a few other online retailers.)     
---
I should send them a bill for training on something they should have already known....
---
I will neither confirm or deny that
---
Flux it, man. Any port in a storm.
---
Get a backpack and slap a refrigeration mod on there. It slows down food spoilage by A LOT. I don't think anything I've cooked has spoiled since I made it two play sessions ago.
---
Nah, its sort of hidden if you're not looking for it, took me a while to figure it out too.
---
If they're small ones, nothing. They fill up and stop making more in a few minutes. On my main, my 3 purifiers are all unlocked since I'm in the middle of no where. On my vendor, I have 1 purifier locked for me and 5 public ones I hope people take from if they need it. Always having some water for myself means I have 5 to put in my vendor at 0 caps to encourage taking my water. I'd put it all in there, but we all know there's that one jerk out there that'd take it all and immediately take it to the closest NPC vendor to get a few hundred caps.
---
I‚Äôve been collecting plans that I don‚Äôt have. I‚Äôll also buy items that I can use to craft items at a profit. I‚Äôll also pick up stuff that Ive never gotten around to buying, like a Hunters Long Coat.
---
yep. I have a lot of fun and play mostly alone. I do enjoy the times I can group up with friends too. but 90%+ of my play time is alone and I have a lot of fun.
---
You can get to the Harper's Ferry bot without firing a shot or being attacked. You just have to take the right route.
---
I recall.  I've played uninterrupted since beta.  It was absolutely ridiculous at first.  It did vary a bit by realm, but it was down days at times.  I think I ended up with almost 2 weeks credited in the first few months.
---
This is especially true with scammers ‚Äúbuying‚Äù junk. It happened to my friend once. I never accept team invites when trading junk for that reason.
---
Definitely gonna keep the capacity mod and just slap good with salt on as needed but I‚Äôm not hunting down rare-ish ingredients to get plus one intelligence for 30 seconds lol
---
No just wait till it lands and with the Stealth Boy upgrade in powerarmor just crouch. If multiple people are their its fairly common to lose her as she agros someone else.
---
"I'd say you have a face only a mother could love... but your entire family died in the Great War.  Zing."
---
There are far too many legitimate reasons not to accept a random team invite to ever do it.
---
never happened to me, maybe because i was like lv 60 wandering around before the 1st month... i bet i look like "i need no shit from you kid gtfo" xd
---
If so, I'm interested...lemme know.
---
I have a few designs i can show you, but realistically you just need to build 2 stairs then switch-back...sadly i have no pictures to show as an example...  
---
There's a few prebuilt designs that i use for workshops, would be more than willing to share my knowledge...would be willing to show you directly if you're on ps4, otherwise i'm still down for design tips...i'd just need to show video or pics
---
I played since alpha through about 6 months ago. Maybe some realms were down and I absolutely remember getting credited for the INSANE loot and mail lag (upwards of 5 minutes at the most ridiculous times of day). But the game was functional, something that absolutely can't be claimed about day 1 of Fallout 76. As much as I still enjoy playing it, it's still rocky.
---
I leave everything unlocked and my machines right next to my purifiers.  I‚Äôm obliged to handle your mole rat problem if your rocket turrets are working overtime and while I‚Äôm trying to shop in peace.
---
I've experimented with the idea of buying different quantities as well and it isn't consistent. With the same 20 screws example, I tried buying 19, 16, 10 and it didnt work, but it let me purchase 2 or 5 at a time. The closer the number got to 0, the less consistent it let me by even in groups of 2 or 5. Eventually I resorted to buying 1 at a time for the rest, but the server crashed anway so I was cheated out of my screws
---
And the recipe will require sheepsquatch meat, spices, raw intestine, frog eggs, wine and razorgrain flour, half of which will spoil by the time you collect everything.
---
Benefit: +10% melee damage, exactly like yao-guai ribs or glowing meat steaks that require raw meat and a piece of wood scrap.
---
An ad hom means that you are out of arguments. Have a nice life.
---
How about a skin for the sledge name the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre using it wrong‚Äù. It looks exactly the same as the dragon but you swing it by the barrel as a melee lol.

---
you can just plop down a a vendbox and set prices to 0.
---
I‚Äôve only got two but use just one, both unlocked, right by the overseers camp. Always nice to get new players dropping by :) and they certainly get used lots which is nice.
---
Probably a new bug
---
Those current mods don‚Äôt add stars anymore. That was a bug they fixed in patch 9. I wish they‚Äôd make use of the fourth and fifth star though. Otherwise what‚Äôs the purpose of them being there.?
---
Shotgun Shells, Shotgun Shells, Shotgun Shells, and Cheap Star items to recycle.
---
Plastic.
---
Very cool! What are the chances..
---
I‚Äôm seeing it, but still not believing it.
---
I went to a base on the first day we had vendor machine up.  Came in and noticed their generator was dead, so I fixed it then realized I was locked into their generator room with no way out.   Like an fool I just unlocked the door and promptly became wanted.  
---
I still fix things but I move around when coming into a camp.
---
I didn't downvote you, but:
---
1) All of the answers to your questions are literally in the notes/terminals/holos you get during the quest.  Mostly at the cabin where you activate the event.
---
2) A fair number of other people asked the same questions when the quest first came out, so a little googling would have gotten you the answers.
---
So, there's probably people downvoting because of those two.
---
Well I‚Äôll be darned. Thanks!
---
What's your in-game name? Any thing Game of thrones related or the name Brandon?
---
That's irrelevant.
---
I sold one for 25 caps. I‚Äôve had several I usually give them for free. Not very rare
---
I should plop down a camp across from yours and open up my own shop called [CURSE PURGE PLUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN5ZZ64P4PM#t=3m5s)!
---
my plan is to use gun. if that don't work, use more gun
---
I didn't play 76 at launch, I can't speak to that.  But my experience since the beginning of the year has been fine.  I can count on one hand the times I've been disconnected (and only 1 time at SBQ).  I've never seen a 'realm full' message, or had to wait 90 minutes to get in.
---
At this point, I'd say 76 is significantly better than WoW was at this age.  Granted, that's not saying much :P  But except for the occasional missing legendary drop (every few days), and more than a few bugs that should be easy to fix (so why haven't they been?), I have few complaints.
---
sounds good
---
Some dirty mole minor was giving away HJs for 5 caps at the back of whitesprings golf course.
---
Sir edgelord, how art thou so edgy?
---
That is a real possibility. Whomever coded FO 76 doesn't appear to understand Best Practices...
---
You literally can not be hurt by players in adventure mode if you don‚Äôt choose to hurt them, do something that would make you ‚Äúwanted‚Äù, or claim a workshop that someone then contests. You can turn on pacifist mode and the only thing you‚Äôll need to do from there are avoided the incredibly rare player targeted nukes and don‚Äôt defend any workshops that become contested.
---
Gave it one more shot and got it thankyou!
---
I only use this weapon during SBQ - ( ultracite gatling laser ) and it behaves the same. 
---
Sometimes works well and other times it fires a few rounds and stops. Then I reload and it fires a couple more then stops etc.
---
I put it down to partially filled cores but when I make ultracite fusion cores I thought they were all supposed to be 100% charged.
---
Still haven't figured it out.
---
Yes. People used to build all around the workshop so no one could steal it from someone else using foundations so they made it so you can steal workshops without ever being near the workshop table. Just stay in the general area of the workshop now to steal it from someone else.
---
Think I was just unlucky, vendor had it this time, never checked them before the Pioneer challenges
---
That‚Äôs how I play the game and I have a lot of fun
---
I may avoid it until the Patch to fix the Patch is released.
---
Explosive Tesla is a legacy but it removes the arc effect
---
thing is, i'm a high level. but and i have 2 dromedaries but i'll go through 25-30 waters in a 3 hour play time. that speed demon just takes it right out of you.
---
Thanks! Yeah it's my fav!
---
U proved it is with ur childish remarks...time for bed. No more talk.
---
very wholesome
---
I have one but I only use it when things get up close and personal, in a cave, or when I've got a large hoard that needs a lesson in manners.  There is a reason I named my quad explosive combat shotgun "Breach and Clear".
---
I actually have a mutants only vendor that you need marsupial to reach that has the good stuff
---
Another dude (who wanted the Garb of Mysteries to look nice) playing a female character that wants to find a good group - why they don't publish an LFG icon, I don't know.
---
All of my toilet paper goes towards ‚Äúgifts‚Äù I leave for people whose camp I had to glitch warp into. Leave your doors unlocked!!!
---
Pointing out that your post is a waste of everyone's time is childish? Oh well. I can live with that.
---
Preach brother. I‚Äôm about to ditch Class Freak for this very reason. I can live with 15 less carry weight. The only reason I got class freak was the ridiculous +50% drain on Food/Drink with Speed Demon. 
---
Seemed pretty logical to me. Have a mutation with negative side effects you‚Äôd like some help with? Use Class Freak that reduces the negative side of mutations by 75% at Rank 3. But no. It only works with some mutations. 
---
Can they at least find a way to start explaining what things are actually working as they are intended and what things are bugs? Did they not intend for the Stabilized Perk to work with Heavy Energy Weapons? If so the Perk should say it. Did they not intend for Legendary Energy Weapons to drop with Anti-Armor? Explain that and take it out of the damn loot table Bethesda.
---
Use best gun, get better gun, get gun
---
food isnt bad. carnivore lets me eat whatever i want w/o cooking. purified water is harder to come by. i do use 2 dromedary perks and 1 fireproof for SB sonic attack
---
I keep one unlocked and it's one if the bigger ones so people can get 3. But I have like 5 and I have them for a reason, so all I have to do is run back to camp and get like 17 waters and I'm off again.
---
I really wish Bethesda had created a refrigeration mod for power armor so we could get that ability without the needing the backpack. It's frustrating when I want to use my power armor for combat and fast travel getting rid of the refrigeration simply because we can't have any of the backpacks benefits while wearing power armor.
---
Even then it would only help me so much. I really wish that vendors and stash counted as refrigeration so I could actually sell more high grade food and drinks. So many people already sell weapons, armor, and plans but not much for high grade food buffs because of the spoilage rate.
---
You've been a huge waste of our time...think about it.
---
I lock mine but put purified water in the vending machine. So I can get what I need and visitors can get water if they need it. I think that‚Äôs fair.
---
I remember I used to do that, haha. At least when I had the patience. I see the ideology behind it, just seems weirdly easy for someone to stealth somewhere and just take the base while the owner has no idea. Could just hide up somewhere with marsupial or something.
---
As others have posted and if you at my posts for the few days.
---
The queen is getting easier or easier. Yes there are issues and bugs with the fight.
---
Some pointers.
---
1. Always play in a team/with firends. If you don't have someone inline with ya. Send a friend request to the person that dropped the nuke.
---
2. When prepping for the fightake sure you enter your page then move and go to a stash/vendor/ container and open it . This regesteres you as you are currently with the server aka in pa.
---
3. Nuke drop protocol. You can drop the nuke where ever you want o but if your dropping in the queen. Drop it so that drop site v9 is not in the best zone. If you are dropping it place your drop site centered just below the sun dew Grove as long as the prime fissure is blinking and partially covered the queen will spawn.
---
Other helpfull info.
---
If your not Melee it hvy weapons. Tag the queen each phase ( at first and after she regens). And then go after adds.
---
Melee - if she's in the air. Go after adds.
---
Hvy wepaons. Priority is queen revive mates around. Then adds.
---
I usually care 25-35 stim packs with me for each fight. And as hvy weapons 5-8k ammo for each heavy weapon. If I'm running support or Melee more stim packs less ammo. And I go after adds till she's on the ground then pound her
---
I started doing queen fights regularly after I hit 75 d currently 170 ish. And run them asany times as possible.
---
Oh for this that want to do multiple queen fights. If the server has all 3 silos up and ready. Go ahead and launch 1. Do the fight. nd let people know that you'll be doing another one as soon as the silo is cleared. Usually you get multiple people asking to help or saying they will stay for another fight. My personal preference is to lanch aax of 2 per server back to back as quickly as I can clear the fight and the next silo. Then server hop letting people know what's going on . On PC right now with over 200 people in my friends list.
---
I do admit that I have a problem and should be looking for a sbq anonymous group for phyc eval. But who cares I'm having a BLAST
---
The first week plan will be:
---
Stand back in awe of the millions of flashes and booms from the entire server unleashing hell on anything with a red health bar.
---
Second week plan:
---
Develop good strategy to compensate for some people not carrying their weight.
---
Third week plan:
---
Beg people to join my server to play event.
---
My guess:
---
Your expected response: "What's a wheelchair build?"
---
Their unfunny reply: {Some GoT-related response such as "The Wall" or "The Six Kingdoms" or something.}
---
Dude the worse part about that Casual Shielded lining being completely unobtainable in game I s all the newest underarmors they have released on the Atomic Shop are Casual. Haha. 
---
Spent Atoms on your new fancy Tinfoil underarmor? Hope you don‚Äôt want to upgrade it!
---
Usually when I get team invites it's a few minutes before I'm gonna log off and I'm trying to wrap up a task before doing so.
---
Two tips I haven't seen mentioned yet:  
---
If the Impostor is trying to melee you....run backwards.  Preferably in a circle, so that other people have an easier time shooting it - the relatively flat area near the B pylon is nice for this.  It's not too hard to keep stepping out of her range, especially since she stops walking to attack you.  Speed demon is helpful here too.
---
If she's firing the head laser at you, get something between you and her.  She can't turn her head much, and that something will block the beam-o-doom.  The B pylon is handy for this, since you're already running backwards in a circle near it.
---
It happened to me a couple days ago just once I had the marker on me
---
