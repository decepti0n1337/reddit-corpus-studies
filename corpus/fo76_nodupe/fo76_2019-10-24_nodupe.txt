Truth often hurts when we build our dreams on clay.
---
---
---
I just think it is silly to get all worked up about this and I know it won’t instantly cease I just think it’s already lacking quality will get worse
---

---
Edit : we have basically hit rock bottom in terms of micro transactions 😂
---
"We've seen you wanted a shared stash between your characters, in next weeks maintenance, we introduce 'Fallout 2nd', another premium subscription that only requires Fallout 1st, 50,000 atoms purchased, and $200 a year! Want to group all of your characters problems? Group up all of your money and we'll have a deal!"
---
nah, it’s not. if people would like to spend their money, then they are entitled to it. but it is not a good deal. bethesda is offering a service with aspects that should have been in the base game.
---
Yes. Yes it izzzznt.
---
$3.99 per month or $60 per year and you can be a premium stasher!
---
How does the ranger set look? I'm thinking of buying it solely for this, and using the "free" atoms to buy some other outfits I've been eyeing for a while.
---
Could I have a discoed link
---

---
Idk maybe your whiny bitches and they don’t want you to be members
---
It had the impact of severely damaging their reputation and the Fallout brand. That’s not nothing!
---
it really is, can't wait to pay 50$ to transfer all the guns i have on my melee character to my commando character! /s
---
You also can't put things like hardened mass into it at all.
---
Only issue with this is that Zenimax are the ones who run the subs for ESO not Bethesda Game Studios who run the F1st subs.
---
Ooooh, man that sounds like a let down on the bulk, but I guess that's the trade-off there, only pure scrap(by which I assume only raw, no deskfans or anything?).
---
But yeah I'd assume it's supplemental but nothing too much I suppose.
---
Ah Todd, and his sweet little lies.
---
This stuff is still optimal chief. You don’t have to pay for it. And you don’t have to play it either. $60 for what you’ve gotten up until now is adequate. Yeah it has bugs but it ain’t like they ain’t trying to fix it
---
Question, what platform are you on? I am on Xbox but I can not find the subscription in the game store, I was just curious to see how they would handle such a thing
---
Lolz
---
Lol, love the joke
---
See ya
---
Lmao. Guy is using a logical buisness practice to say Capitalism and a free market are bad.
---
* I've never had Fallout:NV crash on me
---
* I don't see how having no mods is better than having the option to play with mods. You say NV *needs* them to play properly, but you literally don't
---
* I do like the map. I've always been a fan of more rural/wooded areas
---
* I do wish NV had more random encounters, but it at least has a fully fleshed out story with plenty of depth and choices
---
West Virginiaaaaa
---
Mountain Mamaaaaa
---
Take me hoooooome
---
For a hundred fucking dollars.
---
You are either paying for the atoms, which cost them nothing to provide mind you, or you are paying for the server
---
 Either way you are setting them up for a cash flow, which if history tells us so far, wont be used for future content.
---
The only thing that comes to mind is Anthem, which seems to be as big of a dumsper fire as F76.
---
Crazy to think its been almost a year since I stopped playing because I was waiting for them to fix it and make it good.
---
hell yeah man!
---
Whoops, didn’t read the patch notes.
---
Does it? I logged on and it didn't. Are you near grafton where it would naturally pop up?
---
Correct. This was in patch notes.
---
That is in the patch notes.
---
"Over the line? You... you... you're so far past the line that you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!" - Joey tribbiani.
---
Lol
---
Oh yeah, I agree with you there. As much as I'm a fan of ESO Plus, I hate that they added loot boxes. I'll still support their subscription model and the value it offers, but you're right that the game also includes obnoxious gambling purchases.
---
FO76 could have just been a Rust knockoff, for sure. But I'm very glad it didn't play it safe and copy that formula. I'm sick of base-grinding offline-raiding PvP-fest games like Rust and Ark and Conan, and was extremely happy with the PvE/co-op focus that 76 brought to the survival genre, even if it was... rocky in implementation.
---
I've been playing today and seen several people with content from it. They're not going anywhere.
---
Are you in toxic valley...
---
So so much better. Me and 3 friends split the membership fee with the person who owns it paying 50% 
---
It’s a pretty great deal if you ask me
---
LOL, very true, with real consequences to your actions.
---
cant increase camp budget or anything. i might consider a private server if i could build anywhere or make a huge settlement or something, but with everything being interchangeable between private and public i doubt that will ever happen. 
---
some people are saying its worth it for the atoms alone, and as a camp guy i understand that sentiment but if they arent gonna increase camp budget it all seems kinda pointless. 
---
Im not seeing any real value to it, at best a one month purchase for the atoms and gear and maybe spend the month loading up on a shit ton of resources? beyond that until they release mods or vastly increase camp budget, at least for me its simply not worth it.
---
EXACTLLLLYYYYYY.

If you want to express your displeasure about the paid subscription, and possibly not spend any more money on Atoms, one place you can do so would be with the company behind this push for more income from the game. Private Equity Partners invested a lot of money into ZeniMax and they want their returns:
---
info@provequity.com
---
The funny thing is that there are NO additional content! We are to pay monthly to keep playing The game as usual. Nothing beats scrolling around The map waiting for an event to pop up for 15 minutes!
---
But the game wasn't free - in know I paid $60 for it. I understand companies need to make money but this is going to be terrible for the players. For example I love love content being added into the game. I HATE map pack dlcs. Guess what happens, after a short time no one is playing the new maps so the people who did buy them are out of luck. It fractures the community.
---
Aside from the in game advantage which I hate they already have a very viable cosmetic transaction system
---
Maybe just go complete it?
---
[removed]
---
Tbh it doesn't look half bad all things considered
---
I don’t care for the first so I’m not going to let it affect me, it’s not altering my gameplay in anyway
---
Yes... but in warframe basic crafting supplies are the the sort of junk that you auto collect as you're running around doing other shit.  In warframe's case limiting your ability to pick up that stuff would hurt their ability to make money since it would impede building stuff and then for impatient people to spend platinum speeding it up.  When it comes to the inventory space that actually matters, warframes, weapons, companions... warframe doesn't just limit you but then charges you piecemeal to unlock extra slots.
---
$120 annually will get you fallout 1st!........
---
Todd has literally no power over BGS's corporate decisions. He's working on starfield anyway so why would he be spending time on this game's monetization.
---
Okay Todd
---
Aw shit, I didn't know it was bootlicking season!
---
It goes away after they log off unless you also have a subscription
---
If I remember right (it was 15 years ago) you paid for the box and then the sub. Now I think you just pay for a sub right?
---
Me too fml
---
A 60$ Dollar mobile Game! :)

Adios

I gave up on bethesda when they fucked obsidian over by tying bonuses to metacritic scores... glad i did
---
Still playing. Paid for a month of 1st to see what it's like and yeah I think I'm gonna keep it. The Private World is super nice and everything is so much more stable and responsive with just me in it. The addition of a new Public Event Cooldown timer means I can just grind those to get a bunch of loot. The campsite is very useful and makes fast travelling to and from far locations from my main camp less expensive. Also I can't complain about the Atomic Shop exclusives and 1650 atoms a month. It's essentially ESO Plus for Fallout 76. I understand why many don't like it, I kinda feel icky for buying it but after some thought, it's my money and it isn't that much of an investment if I pay monthly.
---
Not if you cancel the subscription.
---
getting 'worked up' about it, is actually what drives companies to change practices. getting worked up is why we even now have private servers in the first place. getting worked up over the price of these servers is why by the time wastelanders come out the price will be reduced. this is a game bethesda plays. it's also a business model (a shady one) but if we don't get 'worked up' then nothing changes. just sit back and enjoy the drama. i for one am more entertained by this then i have been by the game for quite some time.
---
Tough choice.
---
If you get the ranger armor you’ll have plenty of atoms to get the samurai armor.
---
You should also mention the Modding paywall of 13$ a month or 100$ a year!
---
I figured it'd be 50/50 tbh. To me I don't know if it'd be worth buying just to farm workshops but who knows, then again u could every single one to myself lmao. I'd probably have it for friends eventually. I do want that ranger set though.
---
"What, you people don't have phones?"
---
Pure scrap
---
If i enjoy the game i can still enjoy it. Our moneys spent already. We already supported them. Not paying extra is not supporting and once you say im not your customer anymore why would they cater to you?? If only paying players are left it will only get worse.
---
Here is really what happened with the unlimited scrap thing.  They investigated what limits they had to impose on your STASH to make the server stable (more or less).  One of the people researching the issue noticed that scrap stash did not really cause a problem just the other unique items did (weapons, armor, etc).  They told their boss who told their boss.  Did we get a big happy "Hey good news!  We are working on the rest but scrap can be unlimited guys!" message?  No, they quietly decided to sit on this info, keeping the artificial limit on stash, until they could monetize it.
---
It's a cash grab, pure and simple.  ALSO think about this:  if it's not a problem with the scrap because there is just a few categories of it and then it's just a number (as all the fanboi's keep pointing out), then WHY DON'T WE ALSO HAVE UNLIMITED AID ITEMS?  WHY NO UNLIMITED AMMO?  It's just a few categories with a number behind them.
---
Oblivion was a great game, I want that Bethesda back...
---
Sorry bro. Commenting on the sub means you play 24/7. Never mind the fact that I haven’t logged in since December.
---
Idk.....It seems kind of low to me considering they're hosting global servers. When I server hop on PC it seems like there are only 4-5 active servers. With Wastelanders not dropping for 3-6 months they're likely to start bleeding players without new content.
---
I'd say Wastelanders is going to be the hail Mary where they either get old players to come back or throw the towel in.
---
Spoiler alert: it still is fucked up beyond all repair
---
Capitalism created the franchise in the first place.
---
im so happy bethesda is selling us everything we've asked to be in the game!! i'd rather buy patches and bug fixes instead of them just fixing the game like they're supposed to!!
---
And no current vats is not good enough for me , I don't even bother aiming at limbs i just tap shoot or tap swing as long as I have a target. But old school vats was like poetry .
---
Tbh I don't feel like it's worth the price but I'll probably buy it for the atoms alone because I'm kinda dumb but yeah it's just not worth the price but kinda I guess???
---
It's all for immersion! Lol
---
I treat myself to Starbucks once a week. The other 6 days I drink my Folgers. If  I want the sub, I just will drink my Folgers and cut out Starbucks. 
---
It’s called budgeting. So....nice try.
---
I'm ANGRY at being forced to pay more.  How am I going to explain this to my mom?  I've a limited income here !!!
---
It's not like they're offering people dedicated persistent servers. It's just instancing (like every multiplayer game offers for free).
---
truthfully, was your mistake to buy the game at all and support this company
---
If its called a 'subscription' - yes.
---
I dont play fo76 currently so cant say with 100% certainty but in every other game I've played, that has subscriptions, a 1 month sub is billed every month 30 days after payment
---
yeah, I guess Europe as a whole is just overreacting about the whole lootbox thing. it's a perfectly valid, fair and just business practice.
---
ooops, sorry. "surprise mechanics".
---
Maybe it was just the lighting but the one I (ps4) stumbled across today looked a lot better than this. The textures were smoother and the letters were clear on the chest.
---
Ah-ha, hahaha.  Ha ha.  Touche
---
It's true, Todd Howard gives zero fucks about gamers or the community or the games, he cares about the bottom line and his Tesla and sees his company as a route towards those things, and because of this his games will continuously fail, because the only way to succeed long term is to care about the games and the community first, and if that's done well, the money will follow. EA and Bethesda will crash and burn for not understanding this, and I'm fine with that.
---
It looks like it would come from a knockoff game "Falloff: Young Vegas"
---
So, and hear me out, don't fucking buy it. Don't act entitled.
---
Acknowledged Freeport 7, see you in about two weeks.
---
I guess you have me there I conceed
---
I whole heartedly agree with you but I just don’t really feel like it will get anyone anywhere as it has not worked on Bethesda before. So basically this is them now and I just accepted it by now I also uninstalled the game and I just want to move on from it and I think everyone should too.
---
Nah im pretty sure people that wanted to create good video games and maybe make money at started it, becoming a soul sucking bag of douche takes capitalist investors.
---
I've got three legendaries so far. Just been farming the fissure sites since I found out

While you're gone being you, me and the boys are going to be rocking it with Riot Gear at the monster mash.

Thank god for him.
---
&gt;Creating a product to distribute for money is capitalism.
---
False this took place before capitalism was an idea. try again.
---
I dont even like this game enough to spend 100 bucks to play by myself. Read dead pc is coming anyway.
---
I got it from Amazon.
---
Not really lol
---
I did that, had a bunch of junk and some bulked, went to the scrap box and did the scrap and deposit, everything disappeared from my inventory side. Checked the scrap box, no extra from the bulked., wondered what happened. Went to a workbench and saw the bulk still in my inventory,  manually scrapped all of it the went to my scrap box and dropped it in.
---
Make that 4 lol. Just got a 3*
---
Is this on PC gamepass too? Like, I never had an xbox so I never bought the pass, and it says it's for 4.99 right now, so does that mean I get Outer Worlds for 4.99? What? Am I dumb?
---
Gotta break a few eggs to make a cake.
---
this is like the 3rd report today.
---
I feel sorry for the people who spent the cash for that stuff
---
&gt; "Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right."  
---
&gt;"Will it be possible to buy non-cosmetic items, say, a legendary minigun, with microtransactions?"  
---
&gt;#"[No. Only Cosmetic.](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241)"
---
This marked the end of me playing and supporting this title... Bethesda was doing good for a bit and completely backpedaled and created a pay to win environment.
---
Unfortunately I've put about 250+hours in the game and having the developers pull this shit thinking its a good idea, i just cant support.
---
I can understand the insane price if they game had more to offer for the price. We get no REAL private server, mod support, ect. Its honestly a joke at this point.
---
Looks like its a good time to free up some space on my SSD...
---
You deserve it honestly, for expecting that Bethesda would make something working.

Let's be honest. The people who threw a fit will come back after they calm down.
---
Ya i clipped it let me see about adding it👍🏻
---
Edit: I logged out &amp; back in to refresh friends list for trade so my clip starts at me doing a trade &amp; discovering my empty stash. 
---
No reason for me to lie about this, just dont want it to happen to others. Ive already lost strangler power armor, i know from that there is no chance to getting my things back 😩
---
What games *do* allow shared inventory across characters? More specifically, what multiplayer games?
---
You don't get it. It's like every big company out there, the face of the company has to answer to address problems and answers.
---
Bethesda should ban all of our accounts by "accident".
---
&gt;canvas bag
---
No, i’m not forgetting it, i chose not to bri g it up because that has nothing to do with the actual game itself. The problems the actual game itself has is that it’s buggy as fuck, like the rest of their games have been since morrowind’s release. 
---
&gt;rum
---
Same as above. The rum bullshit wasn’t on bethesda, but who they licensed it out to. If you should have a problem with anyone bring it up with the people that fucked over bethesda in that situation. Now yes bethesda should have thought twice about licensing it out to these people, but at the same time you all had images of the fucking thing on google months before it actually released, you could have looked at it at any point in time and you people chose not to. Hell, you people should be smart enough to realize that booze never comes in plastic and that the actual nuka cola bottle was going to be a case. 
---
&gt;private servers
---
Anyone with half a brain cell to rub together should know by now that these things were never going to be free. Especially with how badly you people bitched about the atom shop for the last 11 goddamn months. This is what keeps the servers running. Same goddamn reason why battlefield 3 and 4 and Ark and literally any other goddamn game that does this same goddamn shit are still somewhat active. 
---
But no, it’s only a fucking problem when bethesda does it, right? Suddenly every other game dev company is an angel compared to bethesda right? 
---
&gt;atom shop prices being illegally discounted
---
This is a new one, i’ve heard of people bitching about all manner of things about this game, and of course it’s a non stop bitchfest conducted by the fucking whiniest group of people i’ve ever had the displeasure of calling myself a fan of, but this slipped right on by me. 
---
&gt;they’re lying
---
It’s almost like shit changes when you have to deal with the most touchiest group of people on this godforsaken planet that refuses to even hear bethesda out on literally anything. You have no one to blame but yourself.
---
Okay, so “capitalism” as opposed to what? What would you call trade that occurred before the existence of corporations?
---
'Slightest' You have read their past fuck ups right?
---
Maybe if red dead wasnt about to drop on pc I'd check it out. Maybe I could finally get some good drops. But this game wont hold a candle to red dead in my opinion
---
Bethesda will keep pushing the envelope if the market shows they are fine with this. Now it's time to hunt the whales that are too deluded to leave, either by sunk-cost feelings, or lack of ability to add up how much they are being taken for. I'm so frustrated and concerned by this... I'm genuinely nervous about the future of BGS and all their IPs, anyone who has contributed to this debacle is setting the trap for ES6, and you can believe the entire industry is watching, licking their chops.
---
Lmao gamer nerds are way too stingy with their non existent money. It's less than the cost of a night out at a cheap bar. It took like 30 hours to explore the map and that was solid and enjoyable. 
---
The lack of content and Bethesda in general has killed my interest but you need to re-evaluate your priorities if someone else buying any game elicits strong emotions for you. I'll go back to my default state of bending over lmfao
---
Logical business practices at times have included; child labor, slavery, hiring Pinkertons to kill unionizers, public health hazards, hell you want start talking about conflict minerals in Africa? Cause I don't think you do.
---
Face it; doing something logical for profit doesn't make it moral, just, or anything good on principal. If anything, it's usually the opposite cause that profit has to come from somewhere.
---
Lol then why are you defending a package with no content that seems worse. So let's ignore that stupidity and point out the Private servers, scrapbox, tent, Ranger Armor( which will be highly sought after) all things the community has clamored over since the beginning now we need to pay monthly for.
---
You can check my post history.
---
Don't worry, I won't make you pay a subscription for it. Go ahead.
---
I'm not sure why this is even a conversation. They crossed the line long ago and broke a promise that they made to get players in the first place.
---
Unfortunately, the remainder of these losers will continue to pay money, even as these issues grow.
---
Paid outfits increase stats? Nah, that's fine.
---
Kits after arbitrarily nerfing repair? Sure!
---
Refrigerator for money? Cool. We even came up with that idea but will let you sell it to us.
---
Free fast travel and unlimited scrap (was impossible previously when they reduced capacity from 1000...), freeing up like 400 stash space only available for money (not even Atoms this time!) Okay!!!
---
This is pathetic. I'm disappointed that these players are paying for this instead of taking a stand. Games that I enjoy are subject to this group of spineless sheep, so now I have to go outside. Ugh.
---
Weapon wheel and press jump button
---
Not saying it didnt happen. But more people will believe it and avoid it if proof is presented
---
"Mongoloid"....heh....*nice*.
---
You still haven't proven a single thing you said. No, I wouldn't expect a paycheck to say "DLC is why you have this". My point is, Bethesda is in a position where DLC sales don't necessarily effect day to day salaries. They have funds for that, they probably have a budget given to them by Zenimax. That after box sales, any profit is gravy. These same devs would get paid with or without DLC. 
---
Unless you think they get gratuities or royalties. 
---
I want you to show me where the DLC was used to pay salary checks and how much.
---
You're right, I don't know exactly where the salaries for Bethesda come from. And I'm certainly not going to learn it from you. You are the one claiming I'm wrong, even though my statement was more about Bethesda choosing to allocate said profits to improving the servers.
---
So far, all you've done is lay down generic BS like "That's how business works" Without so much as a single shred of specifics or evidence as to how much money. Are the salaries paid from the money earned from box sales?
---
What about games without DLC? How do they pay these people? DLC is gravy. Most AAA games make back their initial investment in the first week, if not the first weekend. That investment includes salaries.
---
I'm not sure how we even got on this topic of how DLC effects salary. 
---
 &gt; Have you ever even had a job?
---
Yes, now tell me how your Walmart greeter position salary makes you any kind of authority on exactly how much of Bethesda's DLC profits influence daily salaries.
---
Many of these people work on a contractor basis. They get their money before the DLC even comes out. And there contract runs out and they leave. Are you telling me without DLC they couldn't pay these people?
---
Or are you naive enough to think that all profit goes back into the worker's hands?
---
Private server does not mean offline game mode....
---
Sorry
---
I do hope when his game stops being supported (hopefully many years from now) they are able to pull it offline and do some sort of patch. The offline experience would certainly be bland, but it would be better than the game just being a memory.
---
A lot of players came from previous Fallout games. Bethesda's timing on this is horrible..... it's as if they were unaware that Obsidian (former Fallout developer) was dropping a Fallout clone (Outer Worlds) on Friday.
---
It's not the only lie keep looking
---
Thank you
---
Open quick wheel hit Y
---
I agree completely. It's an extra option for those who are happy to pay but it's not necessary to enjoy the game.
---
I'm not purchasing 1st yet, as I'm heading away for a 3 week holiday with no facilities for gaming but once I'm back I'll seriously consider investing in a month's subscription to see if I like it before committing to a full year.
---
Their other option is standing by their word. Heaven forbid a firm maintains its integrity.
---
No that’s what I was proposing. But I can only carry out said witch hunt BY playing the game; the two things aren’t mutually exclusive but rather the latter requires that do the former.
---
Bethesda didn't divide anyone. They provided a service. The community is dividing itself, and it's not even really doing that. The whiners are still going to be playing tomorrow. Many of them will pay for the subscription through some flimsy justification to themselves. Gamers can be the biggest bunch of babies.
---
this guy.......
---
Another one of Bethesda's titles called Elderscrolls Online, Borderlands, Destiny 2.  An abundance of MMOs. A lot actually, it's not anything new for multiplayer games...I think the question you should be asking is, what multiplayer games DON'T allow shared inventory across characters.
---
I had something like that happen. After months of emailing with no responses I filed a report with the Better Business Bureau. Suddenly I got what I needed reaaaaaal quick.
---
Didn’t get a chance to before they logged off.
---
No scrap boxes are added to the world, you have to build it yourself. You can scrap and drop in a nearby stash box when out and about, then when your back at your camp you can pull from the stash and drop in the scrap box.
---
Better sold on Ebay OP, I just got a nice severence package.
---
Just like you are deciding to ignore that this minor feature tacked onto the whole package, is actually a very major feature to many many players (not you) and is why some of us are pissed off.  So there's that.
---
The people who threw a fit were never playing. They requested a refund long ago.
---
Honestly, seeing you try to defend this shit-show of a game is hilarious and that's the only reason I commented :)
---
PS: There's a game extremely similar to Fallout coming out soon called 'The Outer Worlds'. If you truly are trying to defend Fallout 76, you should take a look at that game once it releases, it's being developed by certain developers that played big rolls in the fantastic Fallout games (new vegas and Fallout 3 iirc).
---
It's a quest item. Finish the quest and you can scrap it.
---
Me too, awesome game. Very unique.
---
A free market isnt bad and this isnt gambling like loot boxes. Also the EU banned memes so not a great example there buddy.
---
The "GOTY" Edition I got on Steam after moving from Xbone has never had any issues for me. Modding it to hell and back has been a hell of a lot of fun.
---
Can't wait for Outer Worlds.
---
To me PTW means loot boxes, exclusive guns and gear, skins with special abilities, pvp bonuses, or pay only maps. basically all the nasty stuff from other games that bethesda has managed to avoid
---
This. The creators created it. Capitalism/ selling it as a product was just a means to do it.
---
No one is talking to you, bud. We had this argument earlier and we both walked away just fine.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

**When you can buy shortcuts that complete content (ie like Neverwinters campaign completion things), artificially level your character up, or help you beat other users in a competitive mode.** 
---
Although they are trying to straddle the line between functional, useful items and P2W, so far I would consider nothing Bethesda has offered to be P2W.
---
Lol. Not a sustainable model. Guild wars 2 says “Hi”.
---
If you are going to buy atoms, it is. $13=1300 atoms normally. With the sub, it’s $13=1650 atoms.
---
Plus an outfit people have said they’d pay for.
---
Plus a private server.
---
Plus junk stash.
---
Not a terrible deal
---
By not being a gullible idiot and buying the pass...
---
I like how the arguement now is "logic is bad"
---
Oh absolutely. I can't tell you how many folks I've seen in GTA with the gold painted bullshit cars and the ridiculous things like that. It's obscene.
---
If it wasn't for them we wouldn't have Skyrim on consoles, PCs, fridges, calculators, watches, Etch A Sketch or Alexa.
---
Surely all of these releases are for the consumer and have zero to do with greed, right? Right!?
---
I'd rather they keep spitting in my face than take anymore of my money.
---
My girlfriend bought it for £60 here in the UK, month or so after I picked it up for £4.50, yikes.
---
and even then the content can be fundementally free even if its optional paid content.
---
Yes... yes they are.  There is many many people on this sub asking for free.  Free private servers, free content.  Whether it was sold early on as a possibility, it doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.
---
Nobody was surprised that Bethesda charged people for private servers since a cost is expected and needed by Bethesda to be able to host more servers  , it’s just the amount that got people surprised.
---
For what quest?
---
"I am completely boycotting the game and never ever looking at this game ever again"
---
Okay cool, you willing to give stuff away for the lesser players that still wanna play?
---
"NO ITS MINE I WILL USE IT AFTER THE BOYCOTT ENDS"
---
Hosted Servers are always up.  
---
The old was was one of us hosts a server from our PC and would leave it running but then what if the host wants to play another game or do something else with their bandwidth.  
---
Paying for a private server makes this easier.
---
thats cacuse unlike bethesda rockstar made it clear from the start that their premium currency wasnt just cosmetic.
---
the only thing you cant buy with gold in RDO is perk cards but even weapons (if youre at the level) you can buy with gold
---
which i honestly think is worse then the scrapbag FO76 has
---
I just casually play here and there. Haven't sunk any money into other than initial purchase. If i played more, then i would probably consider this, however i don't and that is my choice. Just like everyone else has a choice to pay for the subscription or not.
---
Allow me to play the world's smallest violin.
---
Yeah, I kinda expected that. Like I said, you seem like someone who doesn't approve of people whose opinion differ from their own. Ans the fact that you do not realize that this is wrong makes me hope that you are not allowed to vote.
---
One of the Sheepsquatch quests.
---
Yeah but I think they were referring to that company that paid Bethesda a TON of money in return for a share in the profits I think ~Fallout 3. They got a ton of influence on the company. I think JuiceHead made a video on it
---
Ight ima head out
---
Fallout 4 made me fearful for ES6
---
And..I bought it too.. Thinking If have the whole Map to plunder for lead....nope.... Prison yard empty add.. All my other spots.... My base is under constant attack.... Bought the Halloween pack....orange smoke machine is not there... There's going to be teething problems....
---
Stash box is ok so far...I like it....
---
Him ok I was actually meaning the winning part what does winning mean... my  adderal wore off hours ago and my mind has just gone down all kinds of little side streets.
---
Ill mule for ya for 300 caps and some nuka colas!
---
They aren't rival games at all, but I kinda get where you are coming from.
---
It's mind-blowing to me. I know a lot of old-Fallout die hards weren't satisfied with 4, but at that point I'd never been happier with the Bethesda ES/FO franchise. Beyond the game being right up my alley personally, there were so many reasons to be optimistic: the ambition they put into creating multiple new systems from whole cloth, when they could have rested on their laurels; the improvements to stability and performance compared to their previous games (at least in my experience on PC); the directness and transparency of their perfectly timed announcement and marketing campaign; and bringing modding to consoles, among other factors.
---
And now we're here. In a mere handful of years, BGS -- previously my favorite game developer hands-down -- has squandered every last bit of respect, loyalty, and optimism I once had for them and for their future.
---
It really, really sucks!
---
Wow, that's a creative insult. Must of taken you a while to come up with that one. Quality reply right there.
---
Again, capitalism didnt exist forever.  It has a birthdate and selling shit you made has existed for thousands of years.  Focusing on profit for investors is what captialism adds and the root fo the problem here.
---
The ignorance here is so fucking high.
---
No you can't
---
“Do you like targeting people who do not share your opinion, hmmm?”
---
Depends on the opinion. IRL, someone buying the subscription would just kinda make me laugh at how gullible they were and nothing more. But if that same person pulled out a swastika flag and started waving it saying “Sieg heil” I’d say they ought to be punched in the fuckin’ head.
---
You can move your character and everything you own—Stash, Scrapbox, carries inventory—across both modes. There’s no difference. Private worlds are really just private sessions of Adventure Mode. Everything works the same.
---
i’ve been waiting as well.
---
Founders don’t get screwed? I guess you didn’t play Mechwarrior Online. That was a beautiful disaster too.
---
Ok? Both games can exist. And I don’t think outer worlds is a FO clone. It’s a space RPG. 
---
Take a break and come back in a few months. Is not a huge deal. I’ve been playing this game way too much and need to do something else for awhile. Maybe I will finally be able to get into RDR2. I swear that game starts off so damn boring.
---
 I read and was responding to the entire thread. It's just people bashing people who bought the game and continue to play it. Most of them haven't bought shit beyond the base game. 
---
It's not like there's a consensus of support for this decision, it's a universally terrible one that's going to lose them a lot of support.
---
I give you credit for quoting yourself while destroying the strawman you set up, but nobody is defending this decision.
---
Thanks. I'll have to choose between dbd or fallout &gt;:/
---
I agree. While on a technical standpoint, it’s not P2W but it’s evident that they’re really trying to push that line. Which is honestly pretty bad.
---
&gt;I've never had Fallout:NV crash on me
---
And other fun lies you can tell yourself
---
&gt;You say NV needs them to play properly, but you literally don't
---
You literally **do**.
---
Yukichigai's unofficial patch unless you want your game to have literally hundreds of glitches, bugs and quest breaking errors.
---
New Vegas Anti Crash unless you want your game to crash every 10 minutes.
---
New Vegas Stutter Remover unless you want insane amounts of micro stutter.
---
Zan's Auto Purge OR an ini edit if you know what you're doing unless you want copious save bloating.
---
CASM unless you want those crashes to undo hours of progress.
---
And those are just the basic fixer mods that you need to get the game rid of all the fucking glitches and bugs. And they don't even fix **everything** because that's impossible.
---
Nevermind all the mods you need to fill up the empty map or flesh out the already existing locations. And all the work you have to do to get many big mods working together. Creating merged patches etc.
---
this game is boring as shit anyway. online games are a waste of time, but at least they entertain me in my downtime. this game can't even do that anymore lmao.
---
How much is a pack of smokes?
---
I'm sorry for you too, the new stuff is actually good for the price.
---
On a side note your name makes me think you listen to hardstyle.
---
People kept saying the atom shop was p2w. Which was always a faulty argument when you can get it all for free. I've got the scavenger bot. I got it with free atoms. The atom shop isn't pay to win and I stand by that.
---
Even with repair kits - the paid ones are crap. They are worse than the free ones. Which are worse than just using a bench.
---
However. The fact you can get unlimited stash space for real money? Now that's... pay to win. I'm genuinely restricted by my stash. Which was fine when everybody was. It's not ok when another player in adventure mode has a paid-for unlimited stash. At least it will cost them shitloads.
---
I'm hoping there's just been some bad communication here and there's more to this. Like we're all getting a massive increase in stash but they would be unlimited. Or... nah that doesn't really make it better. I'm concerned.
---
Im actually out of wood and steel. Ive been making ammo and revamped my camp so it depleted me. Im drowning in flux and who knows what else. I really need to sort it again. Its probably bone shards and ultracite.
---
Leave the childish back and forth aside, and I may be interested in engaging in a discussion with you.
---
I know it's a lot to ask of you, though, seeing your post history.
---
Understood.  Wastelanders was due to come out today.  It has been pushed to Q1 2020
---
Thank you, I think so too.
---
Remember when they said duping and players inadvertently increasing(the word Bethesda used was exploit) their camp budget was causing server instability?
---
It's not epic exclusive at all. It's not on Steam, sure. But it's being published by Microsoft, so it's available on their store. There's no way they'd let anyone else have exclusivity.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Unsolved:\_Missing\_girls](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Unsolved:_Missing_girls)
---
Shit, I just reread their previous "we are delaying Wastelanders" announcement and there are parts that talk about how they are conscious of what can happen if they over monetize blah blah blah.  It sounds so shady and cynical reading it right now.
---
How about we don't reward this BS with money?
---
The outer worlds drops tomorrow. You can get it for basically a dollar with the Microsoft game pass on pc
---
Game should not be f2p. Such a. Minority of players will by the subscription. Majority buy the game. Then idea of a f2p model that 100% relies on mtx is extremely unattractive. No thanks.
---
I just realized that I can pre download Outer World's yay got the UGP 2 months for 2 dollars.
---
I’d say that flying a swastika ought to be a crime so that decent people wouldn’t have to headpunch Nazis. But it’s not so here we are.
---
The people who hate this update, the ones that aren’t all just rage rambling have a pretty good reason for not liking this update, and it is justified..
---
One thing I’d like to add, is I understand this update, in a way it’s essential, it also shows Bethesda Intend to show a little love over the next year (espically to the members) but with a consistent revenue source such as this, hopefully we can see more and more updates like the one today, and get the best wastelanders we deserve! 
---
I can’t pay for the service yet, and probably won’t be able to for atleast a month+ so I am a little disappointed! But I will definitely be purchasing when I can!
---
Why are you being boo'd? You're right lmao
---
What do you consider the birth date of capitalism?
---
So brave...
---
Actually the nuka cola helmet was recalled not the power armor edition but please continue
---
Yeah, expectations are surpassed. I expected to pay $10/mo and with the annual pricing, I'm paying less than that. And I'm getting more. I really only expected private servers, with no "features" at rollout other than being private.
---
The scrapbox is pretty handy, I won't lie. I was near max weight constantly, most of which was from junk I couldn't be troubled to sell or dump. Now that's not a concern. The tent isn't something I wanted for, or forsee using much. If I were starting a new character, I'd be all over this, but I don't have a use for it at present.
---
I might need to get a private server for that.
---
Did you just compared real life to a game
---
Worker owned businesses that dont focus on profit first. Duh.
---
Ask the devs if they wanted to do this or were told to do this.
---
Can I still play as is or do I have to pay MORE money for what I already do?
---
you guys have legitimately lost it.
---
Prepare to be forcefully laughed at by any reputable lawfirm.
---
I'm sure you could find some shady "lawyerer", who would be happy to take your money, but even they would laugh at you behind your back.
---
How dare you insult [Cucky](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/3/31/Cucky_in_Sonic_Runners.png/revision/latest?cb=20150301175616); he's [the best Sonic character](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Cucky).
---
It's cash that I earned through hard work. I don't care what chums like you think.
---
It's not even that shareholders in publishers don't know about videogames, it's that shareholder's don't know about anything they're invested in period. Things like mutual funds and 401ks decentralize things so much many shareholders don't see anything beyond whether they're numbers are green or red. And they want them to be green, doesn't matter how. 
---
It's not that the system is fine, there's just the wrong people. No, the system itself is rotten. To the very core.
---
Post feudalism bruh.
---
It's not even a boycott I'm legitimately not excited for anything in their future, there's no trust.
---
This is literally nothing close to loot boxes and if you think it is then you're not very bright.
---
They've pretty much done it already. I can't imagine they're making a sustainable amount from box sales.
---
Just IMAGINE paying for it and still getting notification "cannot play due no connection to Bethesda servers " on your private game.
---
I’m on a console. And I’m definitely not a whale. I earn 99% of my atoms
---
Can’t tell what is sarcasm and what isn’t on Reddit anymore.
---
Why do you care how other people spend their money..?
---
Wow it's his choice to buy... And you take a shot at him.... Look... The company has to make money .. There's tons of people that make the game ... That need a pay checks... You want an endless game made for free?! That's not fair....
---
I know that feeling bro.. Sometimes I sound like Ricky from Trailer park Boys because I'm having trouble finding the right words..
---
It's Bethesdas cash now ;)
---
That would still be capitalism. It just wouldn’t be a publicly traded company.
---
Yup. Friends is the reason that community-splitting subscriptions are bad. You cannot keep players who feel second-class.
---
Eh, the furthest I go into electronica type music is Seven Lions or Datsik.
---
It actually was my RuneScape handle back in the early 2000's when I was like 12 or 14. I loved the name so much I grabbed this username on every social media I could find.
---
You shouldn't have defended it from the beginning.
---
🎶Lying Todd, sounds like he's singing
---
Oooh, oooh, ooooh🎶
---
$7-10 in CA...
---
They are milking every last drop.
---
I just bring up good counterpoints. I'm not even defending the subscription other than say it's a good deal. It's the people who are arguing that begin childish back and forths
---
Personally, I was going to play it anyway. It's just that Bethesda has given many others a reason to try it out too.
---
I started playing The Old Republic when it went free to play. Good story, ok gameplay - but you are not allowed to equip legendary quality items unless you are a subscriber, or buy an item to unlock the feature for real money. So in order to use the new lightsaber I earned, I spent the 15$ to buy the unlock item, but when I tried to apply it, the game gave an error that said I already applied it. Still couldn't equip my new lightsaber, so I submitted a ticket to  customer service.
---
I got an automated reply saying that customer service was for subscribers only.
---
Ikr, I see 8-10 people during the week typically.
---
From $2 horse armor to $100 Private Servers...we've come a long way
---
You didn’t logged in for free; you paid for the game. 60 bucks (standard price) nonetheless, they are asking for a 100 bucks yearly subscription, I’m sorry but I Can’t understand how people don’t see a problem with this, I’m not saying YOU SHOULDNT buy or play fo76, I’m arguing against paying this absurd subscription they are asking
---
I don't see Loot Boxes, Atom Shop Locked legendaries, improved XP/Drop consumables, or legendary re-roll consumables.
---
there is nothing in the Atom shop that you absolutely have to have to make the game more enjoyable. The utility items at best provide marginal/meaningless benefit.
---
Is this satire?
---
I'm genuinely not commenting to try and argue with you, just here to say
---
&gt; **$175 AU is a small price to pay.** 
---
That's a fucking terrifying thing to read. People are thanking Bethesda for charging you almost $200 for a feature in a $50 (now $20) videogame.
---
Isnt this against the law? I mean there are consumer laws enacted to protect us from predatory practices. 
---
"Advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised."  This is just one of the activities that Bethesda has done. And under The Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) a case could be made could it not?
---
Awesome!
---
Me too. I was honestly shocked by this subscription announcement.
---
Doesn't change the fact of how much of a dumpster fire this game is.
---
They start on the 29th.
---
Uncle Pete is the Senior Vice President of Marketing at Bethesda. He has the power to not be a liar.
---
yeah! but of course. they'll try to wring as much profit outta their base first. so, meh. not a great game. i just like fallout lore is the only reason i've put up with it. for online experience tho...rdr2 is shaping up to be a far better experience overall.
---
Mercantilism on larger scales since nations always got involved, mix of early small scale capitalism and barter system on the small scale.
---
Yeaaah, I'm unfortunately not going to be getting it till Friday. I don't have the gamepass. I know its silly but I like to tightly curate my collection
---
Never bought the game, but have lurked since beta in the hope that this game would shape up. I can see that's never happening now.  Now I just use come here to watch the fireworks.
---
Happy for you, man! 
---
I can bug my way into a private server for free, though, and bring up to 23 friends with me too.
---
It is clothing over your regular armor and you do keep it even if you cancel the subscription
---
AH FUCK... I dumped all of my stuff into that scrapbox, and this post made me go back and check my box..... all of my stuff is gone.... holy shit... that's a fuck ton of stuff to lose ..... &gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah, it's just a $100 subscription lmao.
---
Near Seneca Rocks?  Since launch
---
Definitely a Bethesda account
---
Nope, if you find the existing bugs and content tolerable, by all means subscribe away, it’s your money. I don’t feel they have addressed the bugs adequately enough, nor the present content meaty enough to warrant introducing a subscription due to the perspective I shared in the link. Did you miss the link?
---
Look, I get they started blurring the lines with the atom shop content with the convenience items. That was shiesty. 
---
But nowhere did they ever offer private servers for free. You were fooling yourself if you ever believed they would do private servers for free. Server space costs money, and giving every player of the game their own server with no monetization would ruin them.
---
They decided to make a lucrative offer and bundle in new features exclusive to subscribers of private servers, to entice people and to make more money.
---
I don't really see anything wrong with that. It's there for the people.that wanna buy, it's hardly gonna be different for those that don't except that they will know they are missing out on stuff.
---
That's the root of the issue. People want all the cool stuff, and they want it for free. They don't care about the costs happening on the back end.
---
Yeah, that's how money works.
---
Where did you see the potential? Don't get it bro. This was a piece of shit from launch day.
---
I have issues with publicly traded corporations (and the corporation as a structure in general), but again, capitalism as an economic system predates the corporation.
---
Epic Games exclusive has litteraly boiled down to just 'Not Steam'. Metro Exodus is also on Game Pass. Borderlands 3 is going to be out on Stadia in a month.
---
I'm glad that's the only part you respond too... The game doesnt have enough going on the pay a sub for. Cosmetics dont interest me, and if they put more shortcuts in that store it becomes pay to win. They need to fix their game before trying to add subscriptions
---
Great you have demonstrated that you have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  Please go take an economics course and then share you opinion with others.
---
I just went and checked my box and same shit happened to me ffs
---
Most of the people posting these negative posts don't even play the game, isn't that a little suspicious?
---
If Bethesda really wanted to take our money they wouldn’t listen to us
---
Yeah for a year. Pretty reasonable for what you get.
---
Ha, so the todd howard downvote enclave is still doing their job! And yeah, you’re right... if they don’t see what’s wrong with this, we can’t help them. It really bums me out how numb many people have become towards the increasing benefits ingame purchases have in the last years. Like it’s totally normal to spend so much money on top of the 70 bucks to get things which should be in the vanilla game. The atom store is bright example too. Bundles where certain things can’t be purchased without that bundle getting more common in the last months. I don’t spend money on atoms, I grind them, but it’s getting harder and harder to decide what big thing I want to spend my atoms for.
---
Did you run Geforce Experience
---
Sheep like to stay in packs. That's my guess.
---
Anything that can give you advantages over a fellow player in a PvP environment
---
Power armor edition for PC and a regular edition for xb. Can I get a fastpass in this queue?
---
Ohhh ok
---
Yeah, and corporations didn’t exist until the 1900s. Do you think feudalism lasted until the 1900s?
---
As someone who doesn’t know a lot about gaming other than FO4 and FO76, what is TTW?  With what Bethesda is doing I may need a side piece of action soon
---
The player count is already tiny. This is just a desperate attempt by Bethesda to make back a chunk of the money that this game has lost them. Personally, I knew this game was trash after the beta so I never bought it, but I was gonna give it a shot when the Wastelanders DLC came out. Now I know to just stay 100 miles away from it
---
In Bethesdaland there's only one law: Todd's word.
---
&gt; As someone else pointed out, this is very specific to Scrap, not all items. There's, what, 33 scrap items in the game, none of which have individual stats? Adding more scrap capacity is just uncapping the upper limit on a number.
---
This, and it wouldn't surprise me if this container functioned in a very odd way if it is treated as a container at all. I know with their single player games you can create a script, add properties to it, and then have the script adjust those properties based on the contents of the container. It's very possible under the hood it's destroying the items when you add them, and creating new ones when you try to take the contents back out.
---
Uninstalling now
---
It is illegal in quite a few countries but assault would still be a crime. And when you talk about "decent" people and attacking someone in the same sentence it says something about your understanding of rule of law. You realize though, that Nazis and anyone with an inclination towards fashist world views primarily identify themselves based on their actions snd not some symbols?
---
I consider game modes / new areas / etc content...
---
The only thing behind a paywall are servers and cosmetics... Literally NOTHING to prevent you from playing the exact same game you have been
---
And you get your goddamn Ranger outfit by paying for 1 month...
---
They'd have charged at least 1200 anyways
---
Sounds pretty perfect to me
---
And the private server workshop attack speed thing, Ive owned 4 on a public world at once, and they never seemed to stop tbh
---
Same just happened to me. I used my buddies box to add my broken down bulks. Couldnt mod a weapon after &amp; everything is gone
---
Lord it's like taking the plastic off of a computer component or something. But yeah it's kinda funny how the servers came alongside the goo pile fix.
---
Bruh really? Wtf. I thought it would at least be 1 person buying a server and they could run it. People have to pay to access other people's servers? That's insane
---
You're paying not to be griefed basically! Now that I say it like that I might try out a month!
---
"Boom. Pay us." -Fraud Howard.
---
No lag, mostly stable, but I've been disconnected twice. Both times, after rejoining, all of my progress had been reset
---
This game is all about role play and choices.  The premium membership provides even more options for your imagination to go wild.  Nobody could go wrong investing such a small fee in a game with so many years of replayability
---
Okay. Good talk.
---
For 23$ a month it’s worth what it gives you if you can stomach how fucked up it is. I feel gross for trying it but I’m sick of how laggy the servers are, and compared to public, private servers are buttery smooth. So much quicker.
---
I don’t see myself buying a full years worth because I tend to go on and off games every couple of months, but if I did it would be even cheaper at 15 per month. Maybe if they add a 3 month option.
---
Well I play on PS4 for one thing. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
---
Same. It's such a shame. Idk how they screwed up so badly.
---
Mehh I like it the way it is
---
dude what the actual fuck is up with you, really why do you guys do that? I LIKE the game, I've defended the game, I've played the game for hours and hours with my buddy and I've have fun, I like Bethesda games as much as anyone, but why do you enjoy licking boots so much? how is that subscription acceptable? How is hiding useful content that the community have been demanding for a while behind a paywall acceptable? 
---
If the game was sold like that from the first day I'd have accepted it, but there's people who payed real money for it and now they have to pay again if they want to enjoy things that should be free, like they promised??????
---
REMEMBER: Modders like myself have been begging at Bethesda's heels for years now for a way to monetize our work. And people constantly shit on every attempt even when we provide dozens of high quality mods for free already.
---
As someone who thinks most of the posts today are trolling... I can't fault this idea. The price dropped so fast, anyone who paid full price on this was absolutely screwed. The question is how could they validate non-digital retail buyers? Digital should be easy, but I doubt your average Gamestop or Wal-Mart buyer kept their receipt.
---
Lol try and hug your way into my server. You don’t even know my gamer tag loooool
---
That change is great, I lost about 60lbs off my stash from that change alone!
---
It wasn't worth it to dump money into ESO in the beginning. Once the content started rolling, it was way better.
---
Found the Bethesda employee
---
Nope! I've been playing solo on my private server
---
That may be, Bethesda is new to all of this and probably too stubborn to give up on it. I think they should just make it a free to play and charge for cosmetics and dlc...
---
I know. I've been low-key rooting for them since the game has gotten so much backlash, because of all the great hours the other games have gave me, but this is so hard to try and defend.
---
That's pretty deep considering most non edm heads wont even know who Seven Lions is. Nor would they be able to identify that I am speaking of edm by mentioning hardstyle.
---
I've gone about as far down the rabbit hole I could reach. I used to be a semi professional shuffler at shows dancing on stage.
---
I was just curious.
---
I've already downloaded it, or at least what's available for now on GamePass. It only took alike a minute to download so I'm sure there's like 45 more gigs to go at launch.
---
Won't stop me playing it.
---
...Well other games will. But still, it's the thought that counts. But seriously, never needed any of the P2W stuff they've added, been doing just fine surviving off canned dog food and nuka cola.
---
Wut
---
This is one of those bruh moments.
---
Also your gamertag is the same as your reddit name and you are on Xbox.
---
If they do I want my 80 fucking dollars back, and also give me the atoms they gave to other players when no one bought the damned game that I've sunk so much time into and had so much faith in.
---
What the fuck happened to Fallout, man. How far has the industry fallen when the best post-apocalyptic roleplaying game ever made has become... this.
---
Second post you say this.make ut public si they patch it. I'm not mad if there's a new dupe. Prizes go down and there's good stuff to grab. The market right now is basically just impossibile trades.
---
Wow a paid subscription service? They have hit a new low, monetizing features that should have been a free update for everyone, shame on them. 
---
I'll just do what I always do when gaming companies are scummy, I'll uninstall F76 and never touch it again, any friends who asks me about it i'll just say its "buggy pay to win trash" and leave it at that.
---
Goodbye cash grab game, kiss my arse bethesda.
---
They seem really out of touch on this one imo
---
Lol its for the people that pay and have paid for content past the base game. And if you look at it as such and with no expectations other than what's given in the description of what's included, it's the cheapest (more bang for buck ) so far. A year ago 12$ would get you 1000 atoms and then they offered bonus atoms and a skin. Now 12$ is actually worth spending. If you keep it in context.
---
So? I only bulk when I sell, if I have limited space who cares to bulk it?
---
What really grinds my gears is that all this time they were saying that the stash limit was either a gameplay design or a limitation on the system.
---
Then suddenly it isn't anymore... for a price. FFS.
---
Oh hell nawwwwww you've lost your mind Bethesda. I quit.
---
Being able to only play with friends seems worth it alone... We'll see.
---
right... it is just so scary looking at star citizen subs, how are they still having faith after so many years of it being still in alpha(?)/beta(?)
---
I understood, but he worded it as if he choked his coffe, rather than choking on it
---
I jumped off at the Two shot nerf. It became very grindy after that. And they had next to no use for heavy guns. They were shite... Obviously still kept a passing interest in the game to see if it was possible to improve, but this is just the nail in the coffin for me... After keeping stashes low and drip feeding us upgrades, then they add an unlimited junk stash. Premium only. Yeah OK, i was wary of the broken promises on the repair kits, and the slippery slope that enable... Now they have fully jumped the shark IMO
---
Its a valid point. If doesn't matter if you have 1st or not. If a farming site is empty, nothing you can buy will fix that.
---
Hi Todd,
---
Is that you?
---
Not at all because its logical to assume you will face repercussions making your claim to my things null
---
Never heard the term whale used in this category of money spending. So this made me laugh. 
---
If you are talking people into “voting with their wallet” it does help to target whales. However most of the time when people vote with their wallet, it is because the individual doesn’t buy and everyone else naturally agrees.  
---
For instance.  If they made cotton candy flavored Coca Cola. Maybe no one would buy it cause it sounds disgusting or really is disgusting.  
---
Another example.  You wouldn’t buy clothes from someone who uses slave child labor to make the clothes. 
---
But Bethesda hasn’t really broken any life principles that bother me. So let them people spend if they so choose. This is how free market economy works. 
---
What really sucks is they postponed wastelanders for this and that’s what we should be yelling about.
---
I'll be honest. A year ago I got Spotify and now three of my daily playlists are filled with stuff like that.
---
I think I'm at the bottom of the rabbit hole and have found Allison Wonderland.
---
Wouldn't it be easier if we just signed over our bank accounts and Beth took the amount of money they wanted?
---
Yeah I think people are just sick of Bethesda making bad decisions that they know we’ll respond negatively to and Fallout 1st really pushed people over the edge.
---
Far Harbor being paid DLC feels not as dirty as their latest move. But it is my opinion, I mean no offense.
---
THE OUTER WORLDS Metacritic score. Wow. Suck a fat one Bethesda
---
Zero lag
---
Sorry but no. Atoms does not make it a good deal.
---
lol I mean, yes, I agree, but its still apples to oranges.
---
Maybe you should move to the US it’s only 14.95 here.
---
I get you enjoyed the game like many other people.
---
But defended it? Really? Despite the fact that its a one giant cluster fuck since day 1 and Bethesda is doing absolutely nothing to redeem them self? Just......why?
---
Also that’s kind of an arbitrary category that would include a lot of conflicting ideas. And it’s ill-defined because it doesn’t specify what “targeting” means at it assumes all opinions are of equal validity and equally socially harmless. Basically it’s just kind of a dog whistle that you have few strong principles. But let me break it down for you:
---
Buying the F76 Membership is relatively socially harmless; at most it enables a company to continue pushing and exploitative business model and will continue. At worst, it’s a dumb decision. Therefore, the consequences for said decision should be equally harmless i.e. me chasing them around in a video game naked while trying to smack em with a hammer. Doing greater than that (like doing the same think but IRL) would be unacceptable and morally wrong because the prescribed consequences far outweigh the harmless action. IRL, they’ve already faced consequences by shelling out extra money for a substandard game in its death throes.
---
Flying a Nazi flag is socially harmful because it supports and ideology that literally supports genocide. Ergo, the consequences for a harmful act should be greater. In an ideal setting, they would be deplatformed and the State would issue consequences. In my country they don’t. Ergo, they’re in need of a good head punch.
---
And then there’s something neutral. Like someone saying they like Mayo while I think it’s disgusting. This is a difference of opinion and warrants no serious action.
---
Starting to make more sense?
---
And the stash box is bugged! There have been several reports of people losing everything they put in there. I just lost all of my stuff my self :(
---
Looooool, Bethesda doesn’t employee Aussies.
---
Can't wait to see the Inside Gaming video about this in like, 6 hours. IT'S FUCK-UP-THURSDAY!!
---
Ti
---
Weren’t the outfit stat increases only temporary during an event .
---
&gt;
---
Repair kits and refrigerators are nothing but convenience items , nobody is winning just because their meat spoils a little slower , I’m not sure what you mean by ‘nerfing repair’ because not even the improved repair kit can repair my items to 200% ( 200% is only possible using workbench repair) 
---
Your free fast travel point is debatable, the tent can’t be placed in a location you’re not currently at , so you still have to travel to the location you wish to place the tent , much like a camp.
---
Them scrap boxes again , don’t really add a competitive edge , I’m aware they’re useful and a bit over powered but they don’t make grinding for items any easier as with a scrap box or not , players still have to grind for items for the same time.
---
My friend blue screened while in the raid and we still completed it,even if he was the only one with 1st.
---
Eh, I'd argue shareholders, stock and all that crap is corporatism rather than strictly capitalism, buuuuut corporatism is just the logical progression of capitalism without an upper limit on growth. So, lotta overlap but not one and the same.
---
I actually just got back to playing a week or two ago because I wholeheartedly missed it and heard it got a ton better so came and fell in love all over again, but this is hard to try and defend.
---
Not to play devil's advocate but it  kind of makes sense. I know this subreddit is in defcon: screw bethesda but on private servers the limit is set at 8 people, so less people on the server, more room for storage. More people on the server, less room for storage.
---
As far as server renting go's it's inline with market for a virtual shard. More over is the 50% atoms that pops up from time to time.
---
People love that stuff. I don't buy atoms but i dont care that people do. Hell i want them to buy atoms. Just enjoy the game like normal and nothing has changed. Except a few bug fixes which were great fixes and now will fly under the radar.
---
Have you seen the sales numbers from FO4? I don’t think funding the next ES game is an issue.
---
There shall be a mass exodus of players..which will thus bring upon FREE TO PLAY shortly thereafter. Wastelanders indeed.
---
Eat shit, Bathesda
---
How would you know that if you weren’t an employee, mr/mrs Bethesda employee
---
Preach it man!
---
Bummer, shoulda created a different account name for reddit haha 😂
---
Agreed
---
I mean not being griefed is a strong incentive to buy the subscription.
---
You never answered the question. Which economic system would you prefer to capitalism? This shouldn’t be hard. You hate capitalism so much; you must have a better alternative in mind.
---
&gt;«That's what we said because that was the plan. After launch, as the article says, the plan had to evolve.» *— Peter Hines*
---
You're kidding! I really hope this doesn't happen to many people, coz I'd be fuming! You poor bugger
---
Runs smooth as silk - however my server is bugged right now and not giving legendary spawns.
---
Did the countdown timer start? If so how long was it?
---
Wise and powerful Todd, what other wisdoms may you bless us with?
---
So...this is how they reproduce...eww
---
Xbox live is currently having issues with purchase and content.
---
I’ve joined my own private server and done three identical scrap runs that I used to only be able to do once daily. Everything respawns each time. Each lead weight, every can chime, every toy car, everything.
---
Edit:
---
I left the server on each occasion and fired up a new private server between runs.
---
Me too haha. Just over 300. Most of the weight came from flux.
---
Not like it's a secret. Those who want to know how it's done already do. You just need two people in a private server.
---
Im here, not happy, and have my pitchfork ready.
---
Seriously they could just steal my money at this point and I would be less upset. Why insult us by asking like this?
---
So don't pay, man. This is an optional subscription. It'd be different if they charged for something that made it mandatory
---
Im ps4, it's says 21gb total so fingers crossed.
---
People also need to lose the mindset that its street fighter 2 snes. Pay once and done. If they're gonna continue to make free expansions, quests, support at all then the game needs an income. Hair buns and denim jackets wont cover that. Let people buy what they want and leave them alone. Stop downing the way people spend their money, its theirs. No one is belittling guys buying fedoras or funko pops here. Do what you like.
---
Bye.
---
at least you’re funny
---
INB4 76 cultists/shills/cockriders give you shit. 
---
Fuck Bethesda and fuck the mindless drones on here that defend them.
---
I’m Aussie too, but not a bad troll
---
But there aren't meteors in 76. Silly... Smh-ing my head.
---
Where are you paying $22.50? What currency is that? You are calling it crap but haven’t played it yet? They never said you would be able to host your own server...
---
Just try to play it jeeze. You own the game. Play it.
---
Nope, you can do it on Minecraft for free
---
There isn't a line to draw because you still have the 8% of clowns who still play and defend this game from all the bullshit they've been doing lately. They're just allowing them to keep doing this. There's even a bug with the scrapbox that completely deletes all of your junk. Good on them for supporting this piece of shit subscription lmaoo.
---
I'm assuming the tuba
---
If you're Xbox/PC you will have access with game pass
---
Oh but you are mistaken, friend.  Because this is a public forum, not your private messaging tab.  Your argument with the other fine gentlefellow wasn't just between the both of you, and I've decided to pipe in.  Pal.
---
I concur. I ran through the silo in a state of joy.
---
I'll be using that money to buy the outer world's.
---
"I’ll check out Wastelanders when it drops"
---
Fuck that! Play Outer Worlds or ... I dunno, read a book or something! Invest your time into something that'll give you the time of day!
---
This update basically made the game griefer free. It's probably a lot more popular then you think. In fact I'm gonna redownload the game now and buy a month just to see how nice it is to finally not have to server hop constantly
---
I'm on ps4, ill probably wait for it to go on sale 6 months from now
---
When rdr2 becomes available for pc I’ll be dropping 76 for that. I’ve already pre ordered the ultimate edition. That should keep me going until dying light 2 drops, and that’ll keep me going for a long time. I won’t be touching 76 for ages.
---
If Bethesda has actually tried with this game, actually delivered on promises and actually released the game in a stable state instead of something barely comparable to an alpha release, I’d have been ok with a subscription and probably bought a years worth.
---
For free you'll have 24 unlimited scrapbox per public server. Not a clever idea if you want some stability since it AFFECTS the server. One unlimited per private server is okay, unless you like to collect junk for nothing, you'll never load the server as much as 24 people. And if you're the kind of person who farm junks to sell it, you're free to invite people in your server to buy your infinite stock of acid, screws, plastic, lead, etc.
---
Sounds a lot like 76...
---
Yes, it auto-renews until you cancel.
---
Nice try, todd howard
---
Hey thanks for your concern, I'll be fine I got other things to do and I only got back into it a week ago. Enjoy!
---
Great, now my house can be burned down by three legendary scorchbeasts instead of regular ones.
---
Could be. I’m on Xbox. Though some other person was just saying they are having issues on Xbox so who knows.
---
Holy fuck ass
---
Is that our conversation rate?
---
Almost $200 for a year?
---
🤢🤢🤢🤢
---
I'm looking forward to playing that
---
I’ve been running around killing legendary SB’s. No lag. As a side note. Loot respawns again and again if you hop private to private like it used to.
---
It would had been different if the fans weren't ignored and fucked most of the time the game has been out. I get it, the game was far from perfect when it came out, and I am the last person to sit there and spread hate about some dumb glitches, but $13 a month or $100 a year is not worth what they're giving out. I still will be playing and loving it. Just feel like they should have a bit more to offer.
---
Who is Todd?
---
That was happening to me for a few days straight, and then I went and did the quest. It hasn't popped up since.
---
I don’t live in one of those countries; if I did, I wouldn’t need to advocate for punching Nazis because they would be assured to face consequences for their actions. I also don’t view “legality” as equivalent to “morality.” In fact the greatest instances of immorality in history were explicitly legal. In short, I don’t put much value in the “rule of law” as you frame it as, at least in my country, laws are written by greedy, corrupt, and immoral people and the quality of said laws reflect that. Law in my country does not serve the needs of the citizenry and much of the participation we’re allowed is largely illusory. And displaying symbols IS action; speech is literally a thing you do and it is a necessary precursor towards continued, escalating actions. Fascists understand this very well and it’s something they’re very very good at; they use inflammatory rhetoric but strive to maintain plausible deniability right up until the point where they start dragging people from their beds.
---
When you say "you people," who is it you are talking to?
---
13 bucks a month not to be griefed by dupers and not have to server hop for things, sounds like I'll be re installing the game!
---
I think in some ways corporations are antithetical to the concept of a free market, because they effectively socialize losses by removing liability from the owners and potentially create “too big to fail” situations. I could accept that they’re a logical progression for a capitalist system, but OP equating them is going way too far.
---
I'm already not going to buy the next Bethesda game, I might play it, but I won't buy it.
---
I swear to god the better have accidentally moved the decimal too far to the right
---
😂😂😂
---
Cake day on October 23. Well done.
---
Man, after looking at your post history or you have some serious delusion about Bethesda or you are paid  for them heavy defend them on every single thread.
---
Either way - this is just pathetic if you ask me.
---
I loved Knights of the Old Republic!
---
I'll have to plug it in to see if it still has appeal.
---
Wow I would not even think of subscribing until the bugs and disconnects are fixed!
---
Its smart to drop wastelanders a month or so after Outer Worlds to get people back in the game. considering theyre direct competition with each other it could work out well. I wanna know the road map for private servers.
---
Setting your expectations, this is a "I paid for it" post.
---
Q: Can I kick or report someone from my Private World?  
---
\- If I'm paying for a private world, I should have a kick option and use it at my own will to whomever I want.   Why?  Cuz I paid for it.
---
Q: Is it possible to use mods on my Private World?  
---
\- I am paying for it, I should be able to add mods.  Make it happen.
---
Q: Will membership benefits change over time?  
---
\- It better be, you took my money and you're going to dance when I say dance.  You belong to me for a month.  
---
YouTubers are eating this up.  God damn!
---
This was inevitable, poor sales means atom shop, poor atom shop sales means subscriptions, poor subscriptions means games unsupported(?)
---
When initial sales aren't great they will try anything to break even. This put the nail in the coffen for me (how little I played anyway)
---
Nice try Todd howard
---
Who Bethesda "Licenses it out to" is up to them, so that is still 100% on them to ensure that who they go with is reputable and reliable, and they failed to do both on multiple separate occasions.  When I pay you my money, it is your job to ensure that that product gets to me on time and in the condition expected in, period, and any company that cares about it's customers wouldn't allow a canvas bag to simply not be made out of canvas without warning weather they directly produced them or not.  Besides, even if what you say is true, which it isn't, they still chose to compensate the players by giving them 5 bucks worth of currency that couldn't even buy a canvas bag in game, so I think it's pretty obvious that they don't really care.  
---
No major game in recent history has been as glitchy as 76 was on launch, and it is still very buggy to this day, so don't even try that "they were always like this" nonsense, because thats a massive exaggeration to say the least.
---
Im not even a part of this subreddit, so dont go off about me being part of "you guys".  Hahahah, no, no, the Atom Shop is not what keeps them running.  They could keep them running just fine without the Atom Shop, thats just nonsense they made up to keep getting peoples money.  The Fallout franchise has quite a lot of money to keep servers runnin bud.  
---
 
---
I have Bethesda to blame for 76, and not you, nor anyone else will convince me, the media, or the fans of anything to the contrary.  You haven't actually looked into this nearly enough if you think for a second that Bethesda isn't culpable to 90% of this at minimum. Some of this stuff is literally criminal, thats why they're getting sued as I type this.
---
Let me just laugh at you, still defending Bethesda until now.
---
This is so satisfying.
---
Logging on this second and gonna do the same. Gonna be a kick in the nuts of the month ends and the outfit “mysteriously” disappears.
---
That and the bot dance, I don't care if these were locked behind a sub they're freaking hilarious
---
Don't bother. Scrapbox is bugged. Deletes your junk
---
In my opinion, if they can do that for scrap, they can at least up the storage. The real weight is from all the armor and weapons.
---
It already works with the private servers. They spin up a server for your account, and any of your characters can bounce in and out of it as long as the countdown/idle timer doesn't' expire. 
---
I tested it several times with a couple random trash weapons I got from some mobs and had no problem logging in and grabbing them with one of my alts, so then I used it to transfer a bunch of legendary stuff I picked up for her that I hadn't had a chance to move over yet.
---
Just deep enough for Todd's hand to fit snugly inside
---
Lol not a month I paid for the yearly sub, that how much it was in Aussie $
---
I have pretty much zero lag. Did disconnect once righr after it went live. Smooth sailing since then. Cleared up 320 lbs out of my stash too.
---
Underrated Post
---
I really feel the only people who dont like this are the ones that wont be able to grief with their OP gear. I for one am re installing.
---
Wait wait wait... Private Servers with MODS?! The fuck???
---
It's a real shame, fallout is one of my most loved franchises and originally I couldn't wait to play it online with my friends.
---
I bought it on sale for like 60% off, however my friend's didn't want to buy it even with the discount and i guess they were right.
---
Where are they located?
---
Worser MMO? Try Neverwinter. You can pay to literally level you character/s to max level with full max level gear, alongside paying for mounts and pets that can greatly increase your characters stats. 
---
Then there's the incessant Admin messages of people winning the best rewards from their very clearly P2W lootboxes which you can't get rid of.
---
I agree, especially with the scrapbox in PUBLIC servers when previously it was "technically impossible", however look at some of these voted up comments:
---
[All I want is the ability to host my own server, for my group of friends, on my own hardware, and not have to pay extra for it. Kind of like Minecraft.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlzya2/a_subscription_service_for_a_game_like_this_is/f4vfjtg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
[Honestly, I wouldn't even necessarily mind if they wanted private servers to be behind a subscription. But $100/year is ludicrous.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlzya2/a_subscription_service_for_a_game_like_this_is/f4vv9pe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Anyways, there is no point in even having a conversation, their PR team butchered this already and youtubers are already picking it up so whatever future this game has will hopefully be turned around in some future community modded servers.
---
Voting with your wallet doesn't work because the whales are the ones supporting this fucking behavior. THERES TONS of GDC videos on how to take advantage of customers, how to get them to spend more, how to "whale" hunt. Voting with your wallet doesn't work.
---
Its going to have to take the community to bully these whales and shame them for buying this stuff, to combat the serotonin levels they get from "being rewarded"
---
Well, I understand the point, and I don't disagree with it, I simply wasn't addressing it. I was addressing the following part of your post.
---
&gt;didn't they always say the reason we couldn't have unlimited storage was that the servers would perform worse or not handle it?
---
That part. The implications of having unlimited junk stash are a separate topic.
---
Finally a reasonable person.
---
You are creating a strawman.  If uncapped scrap storage is less intense on the servers and easier to accomplish than unlimited storage for everything else, then why don't we all have uncapped scrap storage right this very moment?  Or, using this same principle, why don't we have uncapped ammo storage?  Or uncapped aid/chem storage?  It didn't go over my head, I understood just fine that you were picking your facts to support your agenda.  
---
Keep supporting their decisions, the game will be better for it. /s
---
Have fun with your gold bars lol
---
It wasn't reset. It's not a private server, it's a private session. You simply didn't join the same server you left.
---
Um... it’s $100 USD. $175 AUD... you are mixing currencies with your response there.
---
How can anyone possibly defend this?? That's like being beat up by someone as you defend the act of them beating you up.
---
Honestly my opinion was that it should have started that way, but there's no way of knowing how profitable (or not) retail release has been. I think it would have adjusted expectations appropriately for what it is and saved them a lot of bad press.
---
Honestly?  I was willing to forgive a lot from Bethesda.   I like the game.  This is a bit much, though.   Not quitting, but definitely taking a break until Wastelanders finally comes out.
---
I keep logging on hoping something cool will catch me because I’m emotionally invested in my character. Haven’t actually played in months. This kills me.
---
You are technically correct.
---
 The best kind of correct.
---
Bethesda has probably fallen harder than any other company outside of Blizzard.
---
Most MMO's have some sort of mailbox or bank that can be accessed by any characters on the account, because they realize that your healer doesn't need a battle axe but your tank might want it.
---
I bet they do and all the people who bought at launch get something shitty like a hat and a months free sub. Its pretty much inevitable
---
But if you dont invite any friends to your private server .... you have a solo private game ..where  real vats would most definitely be able to be used .
---
Yup
---
I was sort of a whale. I bought Oblivion and most of the expansion content for PC. Then bought it again for Xbox, with the Horse Armor the aecond time just for completions sake, without even caring. I have every expansion for just about every Bethesda game since Morrowind except Elder Scrolls Online which I never got involved with since it dis not sound like my thing.
---
I bought a couple versions of Skyrim at least. I bought VR just to play skyrim VR. I have collector editions of Fallout games, a series that has been my favorite of all time since I first played Fallout 1.
---
I even spent a small bundle of money on Fallout Shelter because for a time waster I found it fun and after a few mon Th s of playing for free I decided to reward it despite hating mobile free to play mechanics.
---
Fallout 76 lost me when they gimped the gameplay to FORCE you to pay. I willingly shoveled money into their games, maybe not as fast as they liked, but more than any other game company by almost a magnitude. The moment they stopped adding to the game and started to take away instead, to hold my precious gameplay hours hostage To grind or pay...
---
Screw them, I can afford the hundred dollars but I will not give it to them. I was prepared to spend hundreds on FO 76 cosmetics if it lived up to my hopes, but it was so consistently disappointing I never started buying atoms and just when I was about to give them a chance in the leadup to wastelanders and give them my gaming hours again they did this nonsense. 
---
They have pissed on my parade to the point I am doubting the future of any games from them. I am going to play Outer Worlds and if I like it I will buy all their expansions and all their merch and praise it to all who will listen to me. All they have to do is make a fun game that you olay, not that you pay. I got a job, one that takes a lot of my time, I usually only have a weekend and am willing to spend a lot to enjoy it. Tell me I am not allowed to play what I already paid for, that it will get progressively worse to force me into the atom shop, forget it.
---
I hate you with the power of a thousand burning Todds.
---
&lt;Cough&gt;  Did you say something?
---
Some of these guys defending Bethesda should be getting paid, nearly every thread it’s like the same 5 or 6 guys every time 24/7
---
What? What does OP gear have to do with this?
---
Are you lost, boy?
---
You do if you want to play outside the time the person who paid for it does. So you’re paying monthly server rates even though you only use it for the hours you specifically play.
---
I was thinking of getting one thinking it would be something reasonable or at least useable, but this to me is worthless. I could care less about the scrap or atoms.
---
Same here I cant find it.
---
Rip, getting down voted cause the truth hurts ig
---
Maybe they havent...  I give you subscriptions
---
Thanks for posting it. I'm coming from many games where you could rent a server monthly, and you get little to nothing benefits usually.
---
I was going to write something like you did, but the mentality of many here made me think "there's no use talking about it, they can't accept others opinions".
---
Thank you for your thoughts.
---
Worth it to finally be able to play the game with OP players griefing you.
---
Bold? Nah it’s not bold. Let’s be real it’s straight up greed and immoral on Bethesda’s part to turn around and f*** the community who have stood by this game and given it so much already. We shouldn’t have to pay a subscription from such basic things that people have asked for since launch. Hell I’d rather they had a paid DLC roadmap laid out for this stuff rather than just shove small payment items in every spot possible. Honestly at a loss over the decisions Bethesda makes now days, how the mighty have fallen...
---
Seriously why is this a big deal? What does it last like 20 seconds? It’s not on repeat the entire time your on and you get the quest so who cares? Of all the complaints people have about the game I see this one so much and I don’t know why it bothers people.
---
Tfw you realise nobody is stealing your shit and its a known bug still on private servers
---
K👍🏽
---
Oh I've got both, just torn between which to wear
---
I paid zero for this game and refused to buy atoms. Im a level 189 and simply log in to fuck with other players. This game is a bore and a chore. 
---
Just wasting time until outer worlds comes out
---
It is phenomenal.  Couldn't be more please.  Gun Fu is now a more awesome perk.
---
If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently, people will believe it - Pete Hines
---
What are you even talking about, son? You really are lost.
---
I've looked for a while, then some asshat came and kept shooting me so I just gave up for the moment. I used free atoms to get the bundle so no biggie, but I just thought it looked cool in the preview.
---
Time to abuse this until they fix it :(
---
Again, what in fo76 is competitive? And don't mention NW cause there is ONLY cosmetics there.
---
But....why delete it!? I didn't even get ro read it.
---
They got 60 a pop for all the good will they had in the franchise, that money ran out by now and they are set to gouging. A reaction to all this AAA hostage taking games is coming and these companies are going to be left hurting once a smart competitor decides to fill the vacuum they are leaving.
---
They don't think its a good idea, they think it's a lucrative idea.
---
I dont think it's out of the ordinary. Any other time private servers are offered you have to pay for them. I am personally excited
---
And then to announce it two days before Outer Worlds releases...  Someone wasn't thinking.
---
Exactly. So thats what I'm doing. Not buying it. Keep up. I've literally already done all but wipe my data so incase they make up for this BIG I'll delete it.
---
My understanding of the op is that he is fedup with the arsholeish  business practices of zenimax rather than being 'upset with the game'. There are lots of different types of people though. Definately some are not only willing, but happy to pay to be shat on.
---
Sorry I'm in bed, posting on a stupid-ass laptop keyboard, meant £100. Yes we pay more. IDK why.
---
Paid mods incoming kek.
---
Buh bye
---
Thanks for making me laugh out loud in the middle of the airport 😝
---
“I just feel bad for the people who got tricked into buying this crap”
---
Unless you feel sorry for yourself?
---
That's one heck of a question. Short answer: I use the tools given to me through the game to make my own fun.
---
ARK: Survival Evolved?
---
It's a sub, can do so here https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
Ye
---
i bought the tricentennial and i would appreciate this. people who got power armor edition should get 2 yrs
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny, but I'm not laughing anymore, not after this straight up extortion to fix (part of) their game.
---
I bought tricentennial... That was a mistake 2 days before launch.
---
On the Bethesda website. There is a link on the patch notes.
---
Just bought The Outer Worlds. Was here in the beginning and lived through all the crap, but this is it. Unbelievable.
---
Yeah. I’m up to 800 acid  and 2000 steel. :)
---
I can taste your salt!
---
This is some amazing and creative role play and I’m so glad this wonderful game has inspired such dedication.  But let’s not forget that the use of profanity or threats toward anyone, virtual or actual, especially if Chinese, is strictly against the TOS.  And, of course, to always be respectful to the developers who put 16 times the detail into FO76.
---
It's a big deal because at E3 they promised us things that they're blatantly not doing.   
---
&gt;Hi, guys! This game won't be pay to win, we promise!
---
\*&gt;Adds scrapboxes that gives premium players an obvious advantage.\*  
---
&gt;The game will NOT be a cash grab, guys!
---
\*&gt;Sells us ideas that we suggest such as fridges, tents, repair kits and so on.\*  
---
Yes, MMOs do have premium subscriptions, but they don't promise us things and break those promises a year later. I also wouldn't even categorize 76 as an MMO, it's servers literally only holds 24 players, this isn't MASSIVE. We're shitting on Bethesda because they falsely advertised this game during E3 and we ate it up, some of us are angry because we KNOW Bethesda can do better but they're half assing everything and just trying to milk us for money. I'm happy you enjoy the subscription, I respect the fact you and others enjoy it. But I myself and others can see what they're doing and we're upset about it. I didn't care too much about repair kits because you could earn \*better\* repair kits in game. I didn't care about the scrap kit because if you actually want to buy something to send your junk back to your camp that's lazy and I won't fault you for it, we all get lazy every now and then. But this is an obvious cash grab and it's only been getting worse and worse. What do you think they're going to sell us next? This game has just become an even bigger dumpster fire and I'm done supporting and defending it, this was basically the last straw.
---
I understand this game may be fun to some but it's literally a clone of fallout 4. Why not just play fallout 4? I own fallout 76 and abandoned it day one. Bethesda is testing gamers to see what they can do. This is probably for a future title. I would abandoned the game to show that you don't like there changes.
---
You can actually purchase it right now you have to check the atom shop in the specific bundle sales. It is part of one of those bundles.
---
This. &lt;3
---
&gt;Ive owned 4 on a public world at once, and they never seemed to stop tbh
---
Seriously, it gets insane after a bit. I tried to see if I could claim every single workshop on the map today. By the time I got to the 6th or 7th one, the second round of defense events started to spawn at the previous ones. If you had a full team of 8 playing on a server you could conceivably capture and defend all of them, but trying to do it solo just results in never ending notifications about camps being overrun.
---
I fully agree with you, i don't have a lot of time so i might as well play nuclear winter every now and then and not spend any money other than that.
---
Like seriously, they aren’t even TRYING at this point. They WANT this game to die.
---
The reviews are looking pretty good, actually. Smooth launch it seems.
---
Agree
---
Sign up [HERE](https://i.redd.it/gjkxunegcft11.jpg)
---
Is it worth buying?
---
What’s the newest thing? I missed it. Left and never came back.
---
If I leave the session, and come back later all of the stuff will be there every time. It only happens when I get an actual "Disconnected from Server" message
---
ESO is fucking awesome. Only bad thing anyone ever says about the game is the combat.
---
LOL
---
Yeah after i read that my only hope is that they’ll just scrap it and release a whole new fallout for free for this complete and utter garbage fire of a game now
---
Edit: Can we all band together and sue bethesda? This is just getting ridiculous.
---
I call it being responsible with money. I assume you are the impulse buyer type. I got some real estate to sell ya...
---
Has your fanboyism blinded you into being a huge cunt?
---
&gt;"You dont have technical experience, your too big for your boots!"
---
&gt;Actually i do have technical experience.
---
&gt;"No you dont."
---
&gt;Repeat x24.
---
For that price you could just go subscribe to eve online and have unlimited stash space, in space.
---
Yup. What system?
---
Bleach
---
?????
---
You don't talk about it in your comments so just pm me.
---
Yeah, so I cant see why people are complaining about "workshop farming" on private servers. You have to retake them to repair everything destroyed anyways, so they'll spend so much time repairing and defending they waste ammo/stims to get nothing in return essentially
---
This game is dead
---
Only way now is to get it from other players vending machines, look around they'll be in someones machine
---
If you're on XBox, I should have a plan.
---
They are a business &amp; are expected by Zenimax to maximise profits,  I'm not fussed with their  promises as things sometimes have to change over time. The only thing I don't like is atom store prices as they are ridiculous &amp; I generally stay away from purchasing the crap that is released.
---
But I'll be getting a private server so I can play the way I've always wanted to with my son. Just him &amp; l doing quests &amp; having the freedom that only a private server will bring.. 
---
I understand why people are upset, but I've been playing since beta &amp; I purchased multiple copies of the game for different systems &amp; there has not been one day that I have regretted the purchase.
---
Don’t buy it then. You didn’t earn anything... you didn’t lose anything. Your paying for convenience.... just like if you order a pizza. You can pick that pizza up for free from the pizza place, or have it delivered for a small convenience fee so you don’t have to get out of your underwear. People outraged that I’m willing to pay for convenience, and they want it handed to them for free. But the reality is your not at a disadvantage if you don’t buy it.
---
It’ll be peer to peer.. lol
---
I hope Bethesda learns a lesson from Fallout 76. I hope that the lesson is not how to more efficiently suck money out of people, but it's Bethesda we're talking about here so my hopes aren't very high..
---
They would make more money just allowing mods and private hosted servers in game and using it the same way skyrim is used nowadays. They are so fucking stupid.
---
Yes
---
No, especially not the ones who spent 60 bucks on launch.
---
If you do server hop, at least two comments are saying the items you looted are able to be looted again immediately, like it used to be
---
Yes. Way more stable than at launch. Watch out for trolls on this sub
---
&gt;Where are you paying $22.50? What currency is that?
---
I already said that in the original post.  You didn't read it, did you?
---
Like I said, it's just regular servers, but empty and locked. Anyone can access them before and after you do.
---
This isn't the guy I said didn't have experience. It's a guy that goes around arguing with people and brings up his UI design on guild wars 2 as if that means he knows everything about relational databases.
---
And I don't know what you think I'm a fanboy for. This game fucking sucks.
---
[here’s the shit](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.windowscentral.com/fallout-76-gets-fallout-1st-membership%3famp)
---
Not that it matters, but scrapboxes are one of those things like vending machines that can't be built at workshops. You can build one at camp, and there's one in the survival tent, and that's it.
---
This small group of vocal redditors is a very small portion of the Fo76 player base.
---
Exactly
---
Honestly I don’t know how I feel at the moment. I paid full price for the game the day it released. I’ve defended Bethesda countless times on social media. I’ve stuck with this game even through some of the bugs. Now they want to charge us a monthly fee to have private servers and carry infinite junk. Thanks for the dagger in my back Bethesda :(
---
People like you are the reason Bethesda doesnt give a shit about making their games better.
---
Yeah, I’m on right now. What’s your GT?
---
Yeah I don't see the point sure it'd be fun with friends but even then eventually what would you be doing? Sitting on a mountain of resources, hoarding tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, never needing to worry about food again since you have your very own food factory, unlimited fusion cores, so many legendaries you need mule after mule, max caps on each, nuke zones to yourself it'd be boring you'd be buying the endgame
---
Placing a tent should cost the same amount of caps as moving camp and it should be periodically attacked like your camp but you shouldn't be able to build anything at the tent
---
Yeah more workshops more difficulty if you have all workshops you get nothing but scorchbeasts
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm7y0g/nuclear_winter_paint_unlocks_by_level/ Hope this helps you some.
---
Value is subjective of course, but I play the game enough to find it worthy.
---
And if I can get away with it, and I know I can get away with it? Is it wrong?
---
Spitting facts here
---
Xbox
---
Seems the same for a lot of big ones now, Destiny 2 etc
---
Honest question, why do you still have any interest in the franchise at this point?
---
They are seperate camp items but both have a limit of 1 so you can have 1 of each built at the same time.
---
Or buy The Outer Worlds by a company that makes a better Fallout ...
---
your still missing the point ok by your logic junk doesnt impact right but not having junk in stash arent you adding more reg items hense causing "SERVER INSTABILITY" i cant believe i have to spell it out for you its 1 + 1 = 2
---
Must be the tears of the foodbuilds, I still haven't taken a shower...
---
All while Outer Worlds comes out like what next week?
---
Also, you get $16 worth of Atoms every month for $8 if you buy the $100 12 month subscription. *shrug*
---
Still not working. I was able to access the product page earlier in the day (right after the new patch went live and maintenance completed), but was still on the fence.
---
I found that [tweet](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1185264327428886528) you quoted, but that's BS and everyone knows it.
---
&gt; "All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the  post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say,  the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look  there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to  stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money  on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60,"  Hines said. "That you know, when they put out new content or features or  whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free. That feels right." - *Pete Hines* ([cite](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-has-microtransactions-but-bethesda-insi/1100-6462850/))
---
**There's a line.** That's supposed to mean something, and it sure doesn't mean you "evolve" around that line. Saying your plan changed is a load of crap when you (as a company, Bethesda, not just Hines) went out of your way numerous times to say things like Atomic Shop will be cosmetic only, and all DLC will be free (the latter of which, so far, is still true).
---
I’m playing NW at the moment but I hve some for sale. I think 4k
---
I’m really dissapoint as well. I was excited for private servers as a returning player (haven’t played since launch) cause I was getting annoyed cause of high enemy levels due to other players. But now, They want me to pay $175 AUD to do that? 
---
God damnit Bethesda I’m trying so god damn hard to enjoy this bugged out Fucking game. 
---
What’s next, we gotta pay atoms to talk to the Wastelanders characters?
---
Ok thanks
---
Yeah they could given the chance.  Oh, are you unfamiliar with the modding scene for the previous fallout game, Fallout 4?  The game that this one is basically modeled on and uses sometimes identical systems from?  Here you go, I'll link it for you:  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4
---
You're welcome friend!
---
Thanks for writing out the paragraphs. I feel the same way.
---
Yes and also illogical
---
Haha i didnt laugh until I saw the name
---
It just works its true
---
One of each? Wonderful. I was worried it would be like lights, where everything in the category counts towards the limit.
---
Shaking your head because the game is stable for me? I used to get disconnected constantly last November. Now I don’t. So for me it is noticeably not stable.
---
Bruh, it's not that serious....
---
Want to talk about other companies E3 announcements? Since when E3 is more than advertising? E3 and other conferences are not a contract the companies are signing with their communities.
---
Unless their original excuse was bullshit.
---
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=I2xAIQjEqYc&amp;feature=share Try this on for size.
---
It's an exclusive club.
---
You can unload into the scrap stash just like your normal stash, it will only accept your scrap and junk to be broken down.  It does not accept bulk items or gear.
---
What ever you think. (Pay to make it better) is that more fitting
---
Oh ok, thanks for the answer
---
Precisely. After I realized it was futile I let all of them get overrun except Hemlock, Spruce Knob, Poseidon, and the Munition Factory. It kept the defense events to a manageable level and gave me time to run through Lucky Hole and do other events between defending the camps.
---
It's also sort of convenient having free fast travel places scattered across the map, but given that I'm almost at max caps anyway it's not a huge selling point.
---
You picked the wrong day to ask that question
---
Its a profit for money business. :)
---
Lol. Highly entertaining story, among all the silly complaing here. I like how it stayed reasonable without going completely bananas.
---
Are you serious? How long have you played the game for? It’s super stable now.
---
It's not stable at all
---
So you can do an endless run through Abandoned Bog Town? Holy cow, that must be a couple of hundred screws an hour at least.
---
i lost everything, too! already posted that in another post. didnt put any scrap in someone else scrapbox, just my own.
---
all junk and fluxes gone :(
---
edit: i also broke down some bulks i couldnt put into the scrapbox before putting it into the box, just like you!
---
Its definitely worth buying on sale, leveling up to 50 is a pretty good experience
---
I'm just saying, if someone ever wanted to open a nightclub in Appalachia... lol

"increased rare drop chance for events!!"
---
It's a decent deal &amp; I'll be signing up later today, might also get one for my son
---
Maybe because it's unpopular and most of the big mouthed people love to spread hate when you try to say why you're satisfied.
---
They are removing any negative posts now so this will get removed soon
---
In the Misc tab (the sick/throwing up icon).  You can Expand it and find them in there (Q on PC).
---
Well, wouldnt allowing infinity scrap storage allow someone to effectively store more non-stacking items in their stash since they no longer have 690 lbs of materials bogging them down?
---
Absolutely postively 100% I can tell you that this game is.....awful, no, don't waste your time or money. LMAO
---
I work on Fridays and Saturdays. But ... The week is free afterwards, FOR REASONS
---
/u/itscmillertime is right man, this is open world multiplayer game dev 101 and if you read something like [gamasutra](https://gamasutra.com), developers describe this all the time. Hell, even Bethesda mentioned this [in their FO76 documentary at 5:16](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=316)
---
Its why games like Ark need to [add a tether around the host player](https://ark.gamepedia.com/196.0).
---
&gt;Added adjustable "*Tethering*" *distance* for non-dedicated multiplayer sessions (maximum distance from Host player)
---
The difference with FO76 is their game is vastly more complex with webs of quests among other hurdles that would take lots of resources to complete, taking away from the game as a whole. Ark in itself is a resource intensive game to host and you see how dubbed down it gets on say an Xbox or lower end PC.
---
EDIT:
---
It would be technically possible, anything is possible. At what cost though.. I've mentioned this before, they would essentially have to develop two different games and people would be pissed to play the water down one and it wouldn't be worth the cost.
---
I have a funny feeling that you made that story up to tug at our heart strings.
---
Suffering from success? I've never reached max caps, but I do try to claim one in each corner, to reduce fast travel prices
---
Why not just not pay for it?  Some people will happily plop down the money.  Its not required.
---
"I can't change poor busines, but I can take my money elsewhere." You low-tier fucking troll.
---
Played it for a bit, there's not really much to it and it runs worse than 76!
---
Nope lol moms basement is cozy for them
---
Nice, keep up the good work then.
---
isn't it crazy how insanely consumer friendly Minecraft is? want to make a mod? sure, go for it! Share entire modpacks? Why not! Do whatever the hell you want to the game for $20!
---
Friends will receive a message. Time validity is another matter. I can’t see it being like the old MW2 where someone in the match was the host and if his connection dropped you all got booted to the lobby, but knowing them this is exactly what may happen.
---
Fax if beta owners get a year free mmmmm I wouldn’t even be mad anymore
---
The game's still updating for me, but if someone doesn't give you a plan by tomorrow, let me know and I'll pm you my gamertag.
---
Totally understand you man
---
It is a bummer and not really necessary.  The only benefit it gives you is being able to fast move throughout the map with an additional point.  This really would have been beneficial with Survival mode and the lack of fast travel mode.
---
Fuck Outer Worlds.  They lost my money when they went Epic exclusive.  If it's not on Steam or maybe Origin (would have to be amazing, glad I dodged a bullet on Battlefield V after Battlefront 2), I'm not buying it.  I'm tired of juggling different launchers and services.
---
Bye bye angry poor
---
I'm fussed because I feel that they aren't putting enough into the core game and honestly don't seem to have a serious production process in place. 
---
If the game were more stable and balanced and worked without performance issues and WAS getting actual free content in addition to the atom stuff then I think you'd see much less (but certainly not zero) complaining and dumbfoundednesd.
---
The best possible outcome of all this is that the user base drops to the point where Bethesda abandons the game and learns to never do this type of shit again.
---
17 is what you need to start playing - full game is 40
---
Yeah but I can’t play Fallout 4 with my friends
---
I’ve seen a lot of outrage against it but as far as I see it the only worth is the private server which I don’t think is needed so it’s just the atoms? I don’t know all that’s in it
---
Thanks :)
---
I seriously can’t believe this, don’t know about you guys but I feel utterly betrayed by them..
---
Pretty much also means we can assume everything included with the Fallout 1st membership won't come to the base game for average players. Anybody holding out for infinite storage space since it was revealed that it doesn't cause stability issues is probably never going to get it, or at least not for free.
---
I do ! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I earn about 3.5 a day every day. Haven't bought any since I started.
---
I refuse to read this bullshit, you're lying for no reason other then to defend this game *pathetic*
---
They'll ever do this. That would inlude rewarding loyal customers intead of milking them dry.
---
This is the first time in a long, long time that F76 has reached the front page. Can't say I'm surprised about what the reason is
---
ESO has had essentially the same type of sub for years and hasn’t gone F2P and is doing just fine.
---
Paid for by money that Todd Howard found under the backseat of his Porche.
---
Dad always said "every bad person, faction or movement will have its useful idiots"

How much is Bethesda paying you to say this?

---
(The door on the right)
---
Still has bugs, but it's always been worth buying.
---
Only game I've ever spent 1200 hours in
---
At the very least, make it available for free for the pre-order and day 1 crowd.
---
Those who paid full price, myself included, already took our L. So maybe if it went FTP with the Fallout 1st subscription it wouldn't be too too bad. As long as those who purchased it already, regardless of price, are given six months of Fallout 1st as compensation.
---
So you actually support Pay 2 Win - as long as you're the beneficiary? 🤔
---
Lol, You don't even play the game. You are here because you know it's a hot place to troll.
---
To borrow a phrase made popular in another gaming franchise, feelsEUman.
---
Bye felicia
---
Dude - BUY NOW. This is an offline SP game made by the Fallout NV guys. Apparantly it runns extremely well on all systems too.
---
Yea man, I also spent $60 on this trainwreck I feel your pain. Unfortunately I believe that the people who spend more money on this game are gonna find more ways to rationalize it's shittiness, kinda like what Star Citizen backers do
---
That explains the God Howard jokes I keep seeing.
---
I have no issues with today's updates/news. Questions maybe, but no issues with what I've heard and seen so far. Sucks we can't have opinions anymore, without fear of the blue arrow.
---
No problem.
---
I been playing from the first 4 hours on the test befor the game came out. 
---
If that is the case I bet it's because no ones plays any more. 
---
Are you on pc?
---
Just wondering. Do you have any problems when doing the raids?
---
😂
---
LOL people are actually supporting this horrible anti consumer move?
---
Well, yes and no. They're persistent as long as you're actively using them, and you can bounce back and forth between characters and remain on the same instance, but it'll time out at some point if you're not on it. 
---
As for whether the instance gets rebooted or given to someone else "as is" remains to be seen, but I suspect it's the former. I was on at 3 distinctly different servers today, and all of them were clean (no remnants of stuff in workshops, all enemies spawned etc), so I think they just fire up a fresh instance every time you log in.
---
Lmao nice find
---
True. I think capitalism is functional and stable if kept small scale, it just needs to be *kept* that way or it'll expand to corporatism again. The emphasis on expansion is it's danger.
---
I hate how right you are.  But you ARE right.
---
It is as serious as I decide it is. You are free to believe and do whatever you want.
---
No crap freedom speech. The point was boring the dead horse, crybabies.
---
Who said I was buying anything lol. And it is 15 bucks, that is the price of a large pizza for fuck's sake, it's not like you are taking a second mortgage out on your house.
---
I just saw, sorry for you loss too..about 200 flux for me &amp; enough acid &amp; ballistic fiber to last me a couple more months. I knew it was too good to be true, i was really on the fence about quitting or buying this 😩
---
They are selling the Tanger Armor tho whether that's cosmetic or not idk
---
You know, I fully expected my friends list to be emptied. What did I find when I came home after work? 30 people online, with over half on a private server.
---
Like the robot and fridge... I expect the NCR and private servers to pop up, everywhere!
---
yeah man 4v4 sounds fun /s
---
Don’t forget to use a public server for maximum impact!
---
👋 bye
---
I played till lv 50 in the first month then never leveled again. This has sealed the fate of this game now. 
---
Ill never be picking it up again now...
---
Reading what people are saying.. I like the game for what it is and I'm contemplating getting the monthly thing because I like the benefits but after reading all these comments I really don't know what to do what you said may help me in deciding
---
+1, Ark hosting is $1/player/month, but that lets you run whatever mods you want, do whatever you want, etc, the server runs while you're offline and it isn't limited to just your friends list if you want to leave it open. Plus the host actually helps when you need it.
---
That was me
---
Totally agree. We were told at launch all future DLC would be free and that private servers were coming. They never said we would have to pay for them. I understand there’s a cost for private servers but the price is too high.
---
Hanging out with my helmet, waiting for more to do
---
The concept itself is extremely appealing so i think most people stuck with it hoping they would expand on it, instead they dug a hole straight to the earths core
---
mirror polished so you can look at yourself right before snapping the disc bc this is complete trash. Ive never felt insulted by a game but this’ll do it.
---
But this is what they have been doing all the time. Literally throughout the life of the game. They have not been reasonable in their pricing since launch. Why expect something different now?
---
The ranger armor?  Seriously?  It's a cosmetic outfit...
---
And if you ever needed an example of how civil this sub is here's pointing out that a cosmetic outfit is a cosmetic getting downvoted.
---
Exactly. It's not even done properly.
---
You think I am lying? Lol. I will be streaming tomorrow if you want to watch. Game runs pretty damn stable now.
---
the game will most likely die before your 99$/year membership ends.
---
I've been trying for 20 minutes. Even the microsoft.com site doesn't work.
---
In what way are they making you pay for FO1st?
---
And limited to only 8 people at a time. And if the host leaves, the server is shut down.
---
We did exactly this in Minecraft on the xbox 360 in 2012, smh.
---
I've wondered how accurate this site is https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/
---
Any idea?
---
It's very nice. Ngl having a nice internet handle is a good feeling
---
There's probably some code to prevent abuse, just like with adventure servers so you can't just server hop and pick up magazines and bobble heads all day. I wonder if the stuff that was looted were things he had already grabbed while in adventure mode in the last 20 hours (or whatever the respawn rate is for world objects).
---
Xbox. Haven’t had any issues with raids yet. And servers are full
---
The game is meant to be about "adventure" though, not sitting counting 1500 items in your inventory every 5 mins. I spent 2 hours freeing up my carry and inventory, with all these new weapons, vendors and alcohol's added it's become like launch, where you can't play anymore. You're always overcumbered stuck at your camp, I have to take bufftats just to attend SBQ and am always running on about 5-10 free carry weight that's with radiation unyielding too
---
Question about Fallout 1st. Willing to try it for a month. Do lose the Ranger Armor after?  Won’t scrap it but will it just vanish after the month?
---
I count that as success if people are always buying, hell if your on xbox I probably bought some
---
Why feel the need to post video anyways?
---

I remember complaining and at first they offered me 100 atoms. Then it was 500 and that’s the max they could offer lmao
---
The one that fans and myself have been begging for forever. Also, not to be like a dick, but I do think that infinite junk storage and easier fast travel still gives people an edge
---
Whatever there smoking i want some
---
Don't US players have the montly option too?
---
Really a couple minutes? Hmmm I doubt that.
---
I also liked the game enough to have fun despite its bugs. Just finished solo launching a nuke to finish off the main quests and was figuring out what to do next. Now I won't bother. Looks like I finished the game afterall.
---
To be frank, i agree with the poster though.
---
Maybe not the enabling part but the sub was pretty huge on defending the game when it first came out despite the flaws.
---
And Outer World's is free with the Xbox game pass. So this is downright stupid.
---
Not sure if you finished your build but I found that piece of scout armor I said I’d look for
---
yea had around 200 flux and lots and lots of all the other junk. kinda depressing that we paid for this lol. i like the package and the very well running servers for doing raids. but this is just a big bummer lol
---
Are we even playing the same game? Lol. Maybe you are playing on a machine that is out of spec or have crap internet? I don’t know. All I know is I very rarely get disconnected now on Xbox. 
---
What system are you on?
---
It certainly should be, but keep in mind it's all about keeping profit &gt; cost and that often means lowering cost and increasing profit.
---
This implementation of it is definitely done by someone who has no real connection to their customer base but sure does know what looks good on a spread sheet.
---
I have been playing for hours on mine and it’s the most stable experience I have had playing 76.
---
If you dont play you are second class, disadvantage
---
If they do this to the next elder scrolls game it's over
---
What do you mean? Is this in an announcement I missed? Is it in the store now?
---
“Epitome of greed in the gaming industry” is a bold claim.  While I don’t support literally anything Bethesda has done surrounding F76, and consider it one of the biggest disasters the gaming world has seen since ET, it doesn’t quite compare to Blizzard selling out to a communist dictatorship rather than uphold the values of equality and free speech espoused by their company and, oh yeah, the rest of the entire western world.
---
Idk.  It is still fun to laugh at Bethesda for the nuclear fuck-up that is Fallout 76.  It’s just really sad that they don’t even take the cake for “greediest AAA game developer”
---
I've wondered too.. unfortunately my guess is it would reset each time. But we can hope
---
1600 atoms, some exclusive armor skins, emotes, etc, access to future deluxe atom store items.
---
In game you get the tent/camp, and the stash box with unlimited junk storage (which everyone should get, the only thing I don’t like that’s behind the paywall).
---
Also I have only made few replies before and never posted anything before. Should this go in general bethesda or any other subreddits?
---
You could have waited for reviews. Not all reviews are biased. Find a game they won, pre-ordering? That shit makes no sense to me.
---
It’s significant to me - I pre ordered, spent 400 hours in the game and had fully maxed out builds. But no content since May + shitty monetization is something I don’t want to support anymore
---
Agreed. This is so stupid of them. Who thought this was a good idea?
---
of course, there shouldn't even be a monthly or yearly option until they fix the fucking game. they're just spitting in all of our faces, selling us community ideas and shit smfh.
---
It's like having a second self.
---
Sure but the game is boring. I played it for a while. Mostly fetch quest. 76 is better in my opinion
---
Nothing is gonna stop anyone from losing their minds. Wastelanders could come out, have an acclaimed story, but a few bugs would trigger dozens of “fuck this I’m out” posts.
---
Honestly, as someone who got it day one, it’d sting a bit but...eh. I’d keep playing it
---
Good point! I've been debating on getting it all day just for the Ranger Outfit, but I'm definitely going to wait a week or two in case this happens
---
Which items do you find problematic? The only Thing thy crosses a line for me is scrap box. I wouldn’t want it though personally. The constraints of the stash are one of he few remaining challenges in this game.
---
I should say, 1600 atoms a month, so 19,200 total atoms for $100 spread over the year.
---
Eh I don't think they're connected.
---
Nope. Private servers are not persistent. They are just regular servers.
---
Strongly considering going PC or next XBOX strictly because of it. Such good value.
---
Except a power armor skin can cost more than 10 dollars. 10 dollars to paint your armor blue and people think this is okay.
---
It’s a mod that combines fallout 3 and new Vegas into one so you can travel back and forth and play both games. If installed correctly it works really well.
---
Try it now! The roles update made a huge change. If you're an xb player I'll be happy to help you out!
---
No one can defend it. This is the dumbest move they made so far, and they had plenty of screw ups.
---
If they remove all micro-transactions then the game will no longer make money, there will be no project income to pay for developer, offices, servers and maintenance and the game will be dropped by Zenimax and shut down. So, no micro-transactions is not really a solutions for an online game, unless you want subscriptions to be mandatory.
---
Yes.
---
That sucks
---
Hahaha yes
---
Annie, are you okay?
---
Isn’t greedy? Great game? Wube’s Factorio. Second highest rated on Steam. Development continued years after I bought it. Best $20 I’ve ever spent. I still play about every week with friends. It’s free to host a server.
---
Fresh Hop IPA.  Ahhh...
---
No of course not. But today the sub is full of people who don’t play the game calling it trash and openly admitting they’ve never played.
---
Huh. Looks like they're preparing ahead with smaller things. I dunno of this existed before or not but just right now I was exploring the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center when I stumpled upon a locked fertilizer container in the basement. Unlike other containers it said "Steal From" instead of "Unlock" or something similar.
---
Unfortunately, I couldn't open it sincr it required a Terminal. And the terminal right next to the container didn't have the option to open it, nor did any terminals in the building
---
And because you begged for it you should get it for free?  Cosmetics were the one thing they flat out said from the beginning they were going to be selling in the atom shop.  The NCR ranger armor is from the opposite side of the country and about two hundred years removed from the current setting... the only way anyone should have ever expected to see it appear in this game was tied to a cash purchase.
---
I bought FO76 opening weekend because I thought I could play with my friend on a console.. nope. Then I kinda stopped playing and really never played again... is it worth coming back and at least playing my "money's worth" out of it?
---
Love it
---
That's an understatement.
---
In a game with so few players already, these additions should have come free (except for maybe the atoms). Loyal players are so hard to find for a game that's had such a rough time attracting players to start and now this? I'm furious
---
That was a different helmet made by a different company
---
Yea I saw that but it looked like spruced up stranger quests to me lol and I’m on PS4
---
Because that's not how capitalism works. Also Todd is a bell end.
---
I went back to fallout 4. I forgot how much fun it was. I'm gonna stay here for another 100 hours. The mods have gotten better too.
---
That site ripoff is on point. Who the hell is on their marketing team that didn't reserve the 20 urls that most resemble the game/feature title? It's a must nowadays to ensure good SEO.
---
I'd like ti not get slapped with the atom shop every time I log in.
---
The only way I'd play this game is if they paid me $15 an hour with benefits and 401k options.
---
It is super addictive
---
I just want to say how much I love this community and it’s creativity.  It’s YOU that make Bethesda games infinitely playable.  In fact I can’t imagine ever unsubscribing from fallout 1st.  I mean, I shop all the bargains in the atomic shop daily.  It’s really a passion of mine.  They’re like mini-DLCs really.  
---
And I just want everyone to remember that it’s true that some corporate decisions don’t go perfectly.  I know it’s true because I heard it on the internet.  But this subscription service will definitely just work out in time.
---
Every single one of you who still play this shit has no right to complain, you deserve it
---
You know the subscription is pay 2 win, right? Something they promised would not be the case in this game. People like you encouraging their behavior, is why they think it's okay to continue doing what they're doing and it'll only get worse. I was in your shoes during the repair kits/fridges yada-yada I didn't give a flying fuck. But scrapboxes are OBVIOUSLY pay to win. Its not going to get better, but keep defending Bethesda and their greedy ways. I wish you luck.
---
Oh man, using such strong language....I’m shaking....yawn.
---
Glad someone posted this. What a joke. They delayed something so important to just screw us some more and get more cash out of us. Like the original price wasn't enough.
---
As if they care about lore, Fallout 76 broke lore so fucking hard when it came out. And you are correct, not everything should be free. But, after this game's shit release they needed a win, not this. This, this is corporate greed.
---
If you see a guy walking the dark streets alone at night, angry, muttering under his breath, that's me.
---
I am guessing you don’t play the game?
---
You're welcome for my service.
---
What mobile games have subscriptions? This is worse than mobile games.
---
I can only imagine how bad that felt, paying upwards of $200 for a bag that didn't even fit the advertisement, and then to top it off you only got the Tricentennial Bonuses as well, which in my honest to god opinion, those didn't warrant the extra pricing, those paints and cosmetics are so fucking stupid, rarely anyone uses base Laser Weapons, a Hatchet, or the 10mm.
---
lmao at you getting downvoted, the reason they implemented this stupid subscription is because people are willing to pay the damn thing, hell they're even happy about it.
---
More than that, GTA V was a quality finished game at launch.
---
I cant wait for Yongyea to... Zzzzzzz 
---
Oh wait he does not care this game anymore.
---
OK
---
My theory was always big game companies work with the government to monitor us like facebook or instagram does..then take our money through micro transactions &amp; p2w 😆
---
A tent is pay to win?
---
I have the money too but I dont wanna pay it, this is not a subcription game like WoW
---
I can pay eventually and I did, but not a subscription for my weight problems that they forced!
---
You don't have to look far to know EVERYONE is experiencing issues with the games permanence.
---
Yeah, scrap boxes and the tent are literally my only problem. But us not giving a fuck about those other things like repair kits and fridges just made them feel like they could do more and more which they've done. I didn't care about them either because like you I have a lot of improved kits.
---
Nope
---
Quicker than Anthem  in the 50% off category. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Guess the gaming fanbase knows garbage when they buy it.
---
Vault 79 showed up in the art for Wastelanders, so I guess we'll find out whenever that comes out
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byx6g0/spoiler\_vault\_79\_is\_opening\_in\_wastelanders/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byx6g0/spoiler_vault_79_is_opening_in_wastelanders/)
---
Hopefully it opens way for the smaller companies like obsidian to start release worthy games.
---
Either we'll see a renaissance of new companies or we'll see another video game market crash like the early 80s.
---
Loved your post and agreed. Stopped buying anything from EA years ago for similar reasons. Unfortunately too similar =/
---
Preach!
---
Yeah, I’m done for now. This just signals to me that they aren’t concerned with fixing anything at this point. I’ll hop back in when Wastelanders comes out, but there are too many other good games for me to waste anymore time on this one right now.
---
Lord... good to hear another player come forth amongst the tidal wave of tears and say they LIKE Fallout First.
---
I've paid FAR more for crappier quality of life perks in other games, so a measly 10$ a month (plus a free $16.50 in Atoms) seems like a deal to me.
---
&gt;Dont forget that we couldn't have unlimited stash because of the server stability issues, and now the game has unlimited scrap stash
---
You won't want to gear it, but whether you have 1 spring or 10K springs it doesn't matter to the server. The stability issues come from unique assets like guns, armor and the like. Scrap, no matter the number of pieces, is just 1 item.
---
Yes, it gives an advantage over other players, does it not? Same as the scrapbox, right?
---
WOW, how can your bosses be that disconnected form their own community.
---
Your not even complaining about the premium itself , just about the price.
---
That means if they charged less you would be ok with it.
---
The way most ppl here aren't 100% against it , but stating "we already pay X " "it's too much", and not focusing on how this proves most of their excuses used in the past about inventory issues were all bogus just bafles me.
---
I fell many will cry and pay up , so (sadly) seems bethesda is doing a nice job ... 
---
In a way I feel companies will pull the max they can , fallout 76 playerbase so far has offered little to no resistance after launch and acomodated acepted and even defended sub-par game/support, Why would bethesda stop acting this way ? it's clearly working , a lot of ppl are still giving them money.
---
Fallout 76 is trully filled with cows begging to be milked.
---
100% same story here! My friend and I both reinstalled and were like "Well, this isn't so bad. Maybe we all could play again and kill some time". Then I get up this morning with a text from him just saying "Bruh" with the link to the announcement. What a sad sad disappointment.
---
MWO does it like ass (iirc) you gotta have played X amount of matches before the deadline or you dont get the rewards.
---
Dont be condescending.
---
I think what OP is trying to say is that many people dont have enough money to spend hundreds of dollars on a shitty money gouging game.
---
Can you link to his channel? Never heard of him.
---
Thank you lol. People just want free stuff smh
---
I know most of my junk goes to helping my alliance, so if I can hold an endless amount? Yes please.
---
I already bought the game, wtf is this shit?
---
I look at it as entertainment value time for money spent.
---
I’ll go see a movie for $12 that lasts 2 hours. That’s $6 an hour for entertainment. That’s on the high end of the scale.
---
The low end of the scale would be Netflix for $10 a month that I’ll watch an average of 24 hours. That’s .41 cents an hour.
---
I’ve easily spent 400+ hours playing Fallout 76. I’ve now spent $60 for the game, probably another $100 in atoms over 12 months, and now $100 for 16,000 atoms and the membership. That’s $260 for 400 hours of entertainment had not including the future hours spent, or $1.50 per hour of entertainment thus far that continues to go down in price the more hours I play in the future with the upcoming free DLC.
---
So, I consider it money well spent. It brings me happiness, and it was my choice to do it. No once forced me or took any part of the game i had already paid for away from me.
---
I do wish the junk stash was free to everyone, though. That feels wrong to put behind the paywall.
---
Like exactly the same thing as when you play regular ole adventure where it's a session on BGS servers.. the only difference with "private servers" is that players who are not your friend can't join you.
---
I.E. CALLING IT A PRIVATE SERVER IS 100% BS
---
I don't see any reason he'd lie, I haven't been disconnected in a while either. Other bugs, yeah, but fewer disconnects
---
why not for emotional distress?
---
daddy?
---
It's literally a Communist salute. It was for everyone and doesn't work.
---
Was waiting for wastelanders dlc.  So I popped in from time to time. Got delayed till next feb or so which is fine.  Better a delay then garbage content. Then I saw this bullshit bethesda was pulling with private servers and whatnot.  Was curious what the general consensus was because it was a really shitty thing to do.  Now I dont have to wait because I will not touch it.
---
Bait and switch
---
Yeah I get you, but I also understand the people who spent more on this game and I see no wrong of defending a game people enjoy. But everyone is different and have their own opinions right? At this point I just have a hard to find this game "fun" and all the broken promises just made it worse.   
---
*Sadly I'm a Star Citizen backer too lol, but I don't defend that shit tho.*
---
I bought for 30... tee hee...  still wish the game was better.  The world design is so awesome.   Game just blows
---
No worries I think, I hope there's a lot of people that do too. We'll never get good Bethesda games again unless we voice our united frustration.
---
Lmao what the fuck? Shutting down the entire game? Good meme.
---
Well I grew up with World of Warcraft and other subscription service games where you would pay for the game and then a service fee otherwise you could not play. 
---
Nothing has changed for people who are playing the game, you can still play, you are not required to pay for the subscription so nothing is changing, they have introduced a new service that is not required that may appeal to some players. 
---
Not a fan boy, I have had my issues with things from them but the reaction to this seems idiotic.
---
All you guys are doing is supporting Bethesda and this shitty development cycle. Ypu guys ate the reason actual content is being delayed for bullshit skins in the first place. So congrats I guess, you worked hard enough to afford 13 dollars for virtual fuck all.
---
We can throw that in too. I just want my refund. 
---
Just think the amount of people that bought this game because of (false) statements made by the company.
---
Do you play on PC? I have a friendly group you might be interested in...
---
Same, gonna check Wastelanders but I'm pretty sure it's going to be disappointment and full of bugs.
---
You own them all a "you were correct and I was wrong"
---
So you feel the value is there compared to competition, and you think BGS will now be content? 
---
I do think you are right in that they needed better cashflow, but to me it tells me they are hemorrhaging money, and top think giving them more will work in your favor is woefully optimistic,  if not altogether naive.
---
You know this took effort away from wastelanders too, like what a joke.
---
People don’t want their suggestions for items that should have been in this broken game from the start monetized, especially when Bethesda made a promise of cosmetics-only.
---
Gladly there is no such thing as Cheat Engine. Oh wait......
---
Teehee
---
People just like to be outraged, I have a friend that hasn’t played the game in 8 months, pops in discord out out the blue today to literally complain how this game has gone to shit.... hasn’t played in 8 months... has no idea of all the free content and Ingame improvements they have been added, yet is so outraged that the game is “p2w”.... I honestly feel bad for Bethesda because I feel like there trying to make a great game for us , but people look at everything under a microscope to find how it offends them. TLDR: I hope my Money goes into making this game better. And I hope people can realize this isn’t really effecting there game play.... this isn’t fortnite, and there not selling OP weapons... it’s junk, literally.
---
I'm gonna have to try this in real life more
---
Co op Bethesda game is all we ever really wanted. 
---
Instead they gave us Fallout 76.
---
I played in hopes it would get better, but with recent news it's pretty obvious it won't. I was obviously very excited for the game and CONTINUED to support and defend it but they seem to obviously not give a fuck. I enjoyed the first few hundred hours and endured the bugs and glitches but afterwards it got boring, this was the first update we've had in months. I only played to level to prepare for wastelanders and the legendary player system because I thought wastelanders would make this game 40x better but with the direction they're going I really don't believe that's the case. So there's no reason for me to keep defending them after they've been lying and ruining their promises from E3 and so on. If you enjoy the game still, good for you, won't knock you for it. But I paid for my copy full price and I'm not happy with the results a year later.
---
When you open your emote wheel, select the salute emote but look at the option. Press R1 on ps4 and you can switch between the two salutations.
---
I'm re installing now that I can finally casually play this game. Without having to compete with people that can no life the game.
---
&gt;Anyone claiming they can play new vegas without mods without it crashing is a fucking liar lmao. It isn't possible.
---
Come on man.  It's buggy but fuck sake that is the biggest crock of shit I've seen all day, and I've been arguing with Trump supporters.
---
Those utility items are about as cosmetic as it gets lol they basically do nothing. Stop whining 😂
---
Aids also reduced, I use to have 200, reduced it to 100 and now I go with 5 or 0 lately for this storage problems
---
Almost all my weight goes to weapons as I said, Im like a explosive doble shot collector what can I say I love those weapons, Im supposed to thrown them to the groundddd??
---
Me: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ
---
It is what got me hooked, something about **good** hardstyle DJs man, listening to this being spun live gets me right in the soul.
---
If you are on spotify, and want to listen to some more of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCPAwdRvNRc) I suggest looking up: Da Tweakaz, Sound Rush, Wildstylez, TnT (might have to type Tuneboy and Technoboy and both produce good stuff on their own as well), Headhunterz (they also have a podcast called "Hard with Style" that is an hour long each of hardstyle he finds that is new or that he just wants to showcase).
---
There are also other subgenres that fall in line with this style, they are all variations on what is called "Hard Dance". What I'd imagine most of what you have been listening to is classified as "Hard Bass" with dubstep and drum'n'bass etc etc.
---
Like I mentioned there are other genres and styles that are in line with hardstyle, like [hard trance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf4yOgUf6OM), and [happy hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YS_7U0mDgA)!
---
If you would like more suggestions just lemme know, like I said I went face-first down the rabbit hole and have been blasting this stuff daily for the last 10 years!
---
Edit: If you check out the last letter of a bunch of the names I dropped you will understand why I thought you might listen to this stuff.
---
Hell no, don't give them a justification for this shitty classist disrespect.
---
He said SUPER stable lmao sounds a bit suspect to me
---
I don't see anyone bashing people that bought the game or that play the game. A bit of fun at the expense of some maybe because the thought of playing this pile is indeed puzzling to some people, but that's all there is. You bought the game, you're obviously going to play it.
---
The people who are getting bashed are the ones that defended this game. Those that are active on this subreddit which means they are well-informed about all the scumery (is that even a word) that went on. 
---
I still remember when bethesda shat the bad for the 100th time and I visited this subreddit and to my shock a bunch of people were downvoting anything negative and defending bethesdas decisions. Most of these people may finally understand what's going on with this news and their eyes have been opened but you can't really blame anyone for poking fun at them. Like what kind of tolerance for abuse do you have lol.
---
I bought the tricentennial skin and a full set of modded out PA from some duper for 5k
---
Then a few weeks later he got bored of the game and knew he was about to get banned for dupped and hooked me up with all his PA's and skins and a few for my family as well.
---
6 months i was working on a retail shop, 0 copies of fo76 were sold, and i tried a bit to push it but noone was willing to buy it.
---
They're just greedy liars. Fuck this game. Regret everything :'(
---
&gt;if this allows Bethesda to continue supporting a game that has been criticised time and time again I’m happy.
---
Bless the willfully ignorant...
---
It works, it just have no icons.
---
Bumping this so more people will see this. Happened to my friend about an hour ago.
---
Low blow there. I wager he's already saved for her and his son's educations.
---
Except that logically over it's a loss because of the potential gain from that person to society which includes you
---
The price is actually cheaper than what I thought it would be, I'll be signing up later today.
---
I believe the stash issues to be caused by Weapons and Armor having to keep track of conditions, Levels, Mods, Legendary effects, paints and the likes. 
---
Scrap really isn't much else but a number.
---
Even if it was it wouldn't matter since it all gets stored in the same database.
---
But you don't...
---
I get the new "marketing" on a game that needs an influx of money to continue to be worked this isn't fallout 3. I was more then ok with atoms and even the really high price points. At a certain point enough is enough. I'm with you sadly I've loved Bethesda since morrwind and know and expect issues with gameplay as it's part of the charm. It's gone to far though asking to much well giving to little. This isn't the Bethesda I've grown to love over the years anymore and it's sad.
---
I stopped and uninstalled months ago - was planning to return for Wastelanders. No fucking chance now.
---
Looks accurate to me.
---
If my estimates are close it would mean that 20-25% of the player base is online right now during prime hours shortly after an update.
---
Then you have those of us that had to wait over a year just to get a canvas bag. Lmao.
---
Honestly I'm starting to think it's useless to try to explain this to the Bethesda fanboys, we just gotta wait until they start selling patches/bug fixes and fucking weapons I guess for them to realize. Pathetic really..
---
Unlimited stash space for crafting? You’ve gotta be shitting me.
---
They also said no pay to win, "No. Only cosmetics", that stash size effects server (infinite junk storage now?), and more.
---
Bethesda says a lot of shit. More often than not however, it's hardly true. They will rescind that when they don't get repeat subs.
---
Bethesda could say the sky is blue and I'd have to go outside and double check for myself.
---
And I agree with you, and give you my humble up-vote... which will probably get down-voted by the tidal wave of tears...
---
Okay so in this vein I did figure out that the world you make is stable no matter what if you leave and there's another subscriber in still. That was in the notes. 
---
BUT: I left the private server, joined adventure mode, checked to see if scrapbox still worked there and translated (did) then went to join back through a friend that was still there. I couldn't.
---
After some discussion with the friends still in the private server id left, I figured I'd have to start another server. I leave game. Start game. Choose private. Ask friends to join.... but I'm there already.
---
So long as the server you made is still stable, you will reenter that same world.
---
I'd surmise that if the entire server were left, a new server would possibly be generated. But still have yet to talk my friends into testing that directly lol
---
My mom died of cancer in 2011, asshole. I have an apartment. It's pretty nice.
---
the scrapbox
---
the tent
---
 Re installing
---
Don't forget the power armor helmets have been recalled as well
---
Subscription model?  Are you joking?  Thanks for encouraging mods to Fallout 4 and NV to actually get back to what we love about Fallout. 
---
Absolutely done with F76 with this pay to win crap.
---
But dat healthcare tho....
---
Your right... it's not pay to win. More like give us money and get stuff to help you. Better stuff then the one who is not willing to pay gets. Good call
---
I could never finished NV cause of the glitches and lag/freezing...soooo....though I love NV, it's wasn't without it's faults.
---
No, it'll all die along with the fucking game.
---
Good on you, very nice.
---
I see him once a week. Why? I rarely fast travel and rarely server hop. I am sure that must be the cause, because some people have been playing since release and seen him twice. 
---
Just walk, wander, ignore the map and just go.
---
They aren’t forcing you to pay for anything. You get 1st, or you don’t. You manage your weight better, or you don’t. You’re loaded out on food buildy perks and weight reduction armor and still having issues. It might be time to think about trimming things.  And I say that fully understand where you’re coming from. My bloodied super sledge from when I first started, my plasma that looks like the one I bought from Gamestop, my All Rise, all weapons I refuse to get rid of for sentimental value but there’s also several of the same sentimental value I have given up because I have good weapons and don’t need them anymore. 
---
And who knows? A stash increase *might* still happen. That’s a strong *might* thing but I don’t think it’s a never thing. But then stash boxes would fill up again and people would be right back here complaining about it, to not mince words.

&gt;Fallout 1st is a premium membership aimed at enhancing the Fallout 76 experience, offering members access to Private Worlds, unlimited crafting component storage with the Scrapbox, a second Fast Travel point with the Survival Tent, exclusive cosmetic items, and best value 1,650 Atoms each month.
---
Dear u/BethesdaGameStudios_ Hahahaha, go fuck yourselves.
---
What’s the big deal? Lol like they can’t do that for the entire player base with the servers but for only a few that pay they can. You want extra? Pay extra. That’s life lol welcome
---
I was going to pay for a official server for my discord group but with the servers not being up at all times and being only 7 slots it isn't really worth it even with the extra shit you get for the price.
---
Easy boot them
---
I'm about to uninstall
---
No we haven't seen any "Responders" themed items yet.
---
&gt;First positive post on private servers I have seen all day.
---
Probably why it got downvoted &gt;.&lt;
---
Or it brings in alot of casuals as they can play without getting shit all over by people that can dedicate more time.
---
They never seem to have issues getting new Smartphones, laptops, games...
---
sorry, didn't know it was mandatory to join the circlejerk
---
From my experience, the Private Servers are a lot more stable, so much so VATS melee hits actually register.
---
2 dozen? i think you’re massively overestimating the number of people that will swallow this shit. anyways, i’ve got some awesome single player games to play that aren’t busted and gimped beyond recognition. ta taa.
---
If they only know you as trader, why would they join you? Are you that popular?
---
Numerically if you primarily plan on using the atoms it's more atoms than what you're paying for but it's still a load of garbage.
---
&gt; You only care because you either can't afford it or want everything handed to you. Suck it up. Quit being poor.
---
Imagine being so triggered by people airing their grievances that you feel the need to lash out like this. Any validity your argument might have had is diminished the moment you decide to add strawmen, assertion, and ad hominems to it. 
---
You and I both know you can do better.
---
I feel like they chose to outsource everything possible to people who have only heard of fallout from a friend who played it once, and this is the end result. The bags, the rum, everything.
---
They said about the same in last itv 😅
---
I'm getting it as well. I was excited as soon as they announced it. Plus I knew it would cost at least 10 bucks a month from the very beginning
---
Hey? Are you me?
---
I’m assuming they’re actually deploying a VM or container for each subscriber’s private world, hence why the storage can be unlimited - each likely has it’s own database instance so scale is no longer a problem.
---
SAME
---
If they're half as oblivious as FO76 fanboys, the game will be defended like their honor depends on its success.
---
Well i do have friends who have been waiting for this so......
---
I hope in wastelanders they give us finally 1000 stash
---
Edit: Not loaded on anything just weapons and ammo like a good wastelander
---
why do yall suck so much now? Like what the heck happened? Obsidian is going to kick yalls ass.
---
What an odd train of thought. 
---
They know me as the random guy with a private server they can randomly join to avoid a full server, laggy server or see what private servers are about.
---
I can’t even join 1st. I tried. My Xbox is trying to tell me it’s a scam and won’t load the page in the store.
---
I know how it works. It's absolute nonsense. This exact thing is possible in basically every mmo out there. Storing thousands of unique items is actually quite trivial. Yeah you wont be able to store infinite amounts of items but realistically you can have enough storage space to not feel completely gimped as a player.
---
If it doesn't work without blasting the server that means the architecture of the game is dogshit or you are being lied to. One can be fixed as has been said, the other one...well nothing to do there but walk away from a lying pos company. 
---
I mean I'll admit, idk how many items you would need to store in the lategame. But unless players are literally storing thousands of items per player there is no problem. Especially since the server population is tiny compared to other games.
---
Having everyone on a normal server have their own personal secondary base would add to the instability of the already frail servers, I doubt they added it there because “ooh money” but more “private servers have the capability of handling this because they aren’t as populated.” 
---
Just like how they supposedly plan on adding other requested features into private servers like larger camp budgets and persistent camps (or workshops I can’t recall which) Some things just don’t fit in the public lobbies, could you imagine if they had persistent camps in public lobbies? Servers would crash within half an hour of being up and you’d probably have people hopping servers as often as possible to spawn their camp in to try and crash the server.
---

---
Then all the reviews came out...”The Outer World’s is New Vegas in Space”...”The Outer World’s is the Skyrim in space I always wanted” etc lol. 
---
Obsidian has absolutely killed it with this game.
---
Absolutely.  Think about all the Atoms people bought in the past year and take a look at the little content we got.  Nuclear Winter and arguably the Vault Raids have been decent.  Other than that, all game content has been garbage.
---
With that said you get a ton of value from ESO's membership. All xpacs included.
---
And you can. Read the Reddit or ask people who have bought the subscription before spreading a false narrative.
---
Only a shotgun skin. You’ll get support eventually
---
They don't fix problems they make things for you to buy to fix the problem. Scrap stash, repair kits, scrap kit, etc
---
I had this issue once but I don't remember if it fixed by itself after relogging or if I just scraped a vending and built it anew.
---
Because he had already choked his chicken?
---
Thank you! I'm here all week!
---
Honestly no. Once my stashbox got full I quit. Not into inventory management games. No npc interactions anywhere also was very frustrating.
---
Can't wait for them to reply to our responses. No idea what they're lame asses will say at this point...
---
I’d like to see it too.
---
That’s not life and that’s not what this game was. We paid for a service that claimed to have cosmetics only and update the game. This isn’t a free to play game you feckless toaster.
---
I'm actually looking forward to exploring areas that are freshly rendered as the dev's intended them to be seen, instead of finding them already looted, brahmin slaughtered, vehicles blown up, junk scattered - while being pestered by a band of foul-mouthed 10 year olds attempting to initiate PVP with chainsaws
---
Loc. Bethesda Softworks Offices, Conference Room. Midday.
---
Guy in charge: *Alright see, we gotta do somethin about them boys over at Obsidian, see. We need to come up with something to counter their upcoming game, see. NYAAA. They already made us look like a pack of mooks with New Vegas *Multiple boos from staff*, seeeee. It was a bum wrap, we just didn't want to do any work...nyaaaaaa.*
---
Other guy in charge:
---
*How about we all just shit ourselves?*
---
Guy in charge:
---
*See that's the kind moxxi I'm looking for! We'll make this shit the killer diller, see...the best! These guys won't know what hit'em!*
---
 on the private server thing for ARK you can run your own without paying a sub homie. and for the shop prices i believe its illegal in some places to sell things at a "discount" if its the first time it has been available to purchase? overall you sound peeved at people who are upset at Beth. 
---
&gt;But no, it’s only a fucking problem when bethesda does it, right? Suddenly every other game dev company is an angel compared to bethesda right?
---
kinda bit of  a strawman here, people are upset with Beth and these KIND of practices and most tend to not agree with em. I remember the forums around when the game first launched and people were apologetic twards 76 saying give em a break its not the solo games, it was impossible to have infinite scrap for players...yet here we are with a sub attached to it.
---
Same thing happened to me :(
---
Yes, by my 6th jump it seems to have synched up and now doesn’t reset.
---
Xbox market is down, has been down for 5 hours now, have been trying to buy it this whole time
---
To all fallout players:
---
I'm so sorry for your loss.  I was excited for another installment after I loved New Vegas so much, but fallout 4 really took the wind out of the sails for me.  And now I see this pile of STEAMY hot garbage.
---
I'm really sorry Bethesda did this to all of you.  This is extortion of a fan base.
---
Greedfall is pretty solid as far as the action rpgs goes. If outer worlds sucks ill just go back to that.
---
no, he's a realist and it's pretty fucking funny
---
u/xxshadowraidxx
---
wish you were on PS4
---
"Low cost," my ass.
---
I just did too
---
Your question. Technically nobody forces you to eat when you're hungry, either. Nor technically force you to bathe, or do anything, really. They're just physical or physiological responses to stimuli.
---
Did you submit a support ticket?
---
Diablo 2 does alot of things better than modern games lol
---
You're high if you think that either of those games will tank.
---
Bruh you're out of your mind if you think Bethesda didn't have a hand in the horse armor pricing. Stop thinking these companies are your friends....
---
Thank you Bethesda for butchering out your loyal fanbase that are supporting this garbage game over the past months.
---
Very Epic. Just .......perfectly shows your prioritizes as a video game company.
---
....
---
What the fuck happen to you Bethesda?
---
This is worrying. Im glad i only dumped junk on one character. So if its lost i can actaully get by still by transferring stuff from my other toons. My buddy on the other hand though, he emptied eveything on all his characters. Ill have to see if he lost anything.
---
This is ridiculous. They implement and OPTIONAL subscription service the does nothing but just help out. This IS NOT a pvp based game. Most players work together anyway, people are only truly mad cause this is being added before regular content but nobody’s ready to talk about that
---
People can be as pissed off as they want but it changes nothing from your regular gameplay if you don’t buy it. 
---
Even if they went back on their word, letting something like this ruin all the hundreds of hours played in other games is absolutely ridiculous. And I highly doubt it’s true. No one regrets playing games they enjoy even if the company makes a fuck up.
---
Considering how much effort I invested in crafting that 18k U.44, yes, yes I am.
---
Honestly if things stay the way they are it doesn't even matter, there's almost no reason to pay for the subscription unless you already buy Aaron's every month.  It's almost exactly the same as Elder Scrolls Online ESO Plus. Except Elder Scrolls Online is completely unplayable without the subscription, because you essentially have a weight and stash limit of 65. 
---
Now if they start cutting into the stash, well then you know it's time to go elsewhere
---
Paying extra for extra is life lol where do you live? The twilight zone lol? And things change lol. It’s business. As long as it’s not pay to win who cares lol
---
Https://Xbox.com/status 
---
The purchase service is down right now
---
I would actually be okay with this. I’m sure tons more would be too
---
1 month. I condensed all my scrap to my main. I had 1400 lead scrap and 8k steel and 1100 acid. Didn't have alot of gun powder so I used 2k cloth to make some of it. Also bought some of the stuff on sale in the atomic shop with the use of the 1650 atoms and this NCR ranger outfit looks so nice. Gave 9950 5mm ammo I made to my friend for his mini gun usage.
---
It feels nice to loot everything again like back when the stash glitch was working.
---
On an even more positive note - outer worlds comes out friday!
---
For many years now.
---
I too was going to stave off buying other games and just play wastelanders instead. Woke up, saw the tweet from BGS and immediately bought Outer Worlds and Death Stranding. I'm out. Fuck em.
---
&gt;gunplay in general also seemed a bit "snappier"
---
Man, I hope so.  One of my biggest complaints.
---
I spent a ton of my time figuring out what scrap to discard.   I constantly stored and used scrap myself.   Having an infinite scrap limit means always having the scraps you need since you no longer burn out some or discard it.  Maybe it means nothing for you, but for plenty it does.
---
From my Fallout 76 friend list (less than 50 people) when I checked, today, just a while after release, 5  were at their private servers and 5 were visiting someone else's private servers. From a total of maybe 15-20 people playing right then. 
---
So, a lot, apparently. I was surprised.
---
I haven’t gotten in in about 5 logins tonight
---
I don't know.
---
This is a fanstastic suggestion
---
Then maybe don't make 18k of an ammo type for a gun that wasn't supposed to use it? 
---
Kinda your own fault.
---
The reveal of 76 wasn't that much of a surprise either as to what it was going to turn out to be.
---
Lmao I have thousands of hours in ESO in mainly Cyrodiil. Been part of many emp pushes, and done a few trials and things. Haven't played much since before the new chapter, but seems like they are doing some major balance stuff with damage to get numbers back into workable range
---
or they figured with blizzard supporting communist china and killing freedom of speech that they could sneak this shit under everyone
---
The official forums are even *worse*. It's....it's unacceptable, honestly. These people...Stockholme Syndrome or some variation.
---
Bethesda also said repair kits were the most purchased atomic shop item. Lol. Sooooooo...
---
Not able to buy a private server, keep getting a "unable to process purchase message." Adrios1 is my account name on Bethesda.net
---
$5.99
---
the bethesda cucks are out in full force now
---
cool
---
I got a PS4, if u wanna hook my mom up w some stuff tho, I'd be mad grateful
---
It will, just store lead steel acid and cloth etc and craft ammo when needed now you don't need bandolier, take the food factory and power plants and batteries included/good with salt can come off.
---
No junk in your stash more room for weapons and armour so all the weight reduction perks aren't needed same goes for legendary effects they can all be replaced with damage/defensive perks and effects
---
Oh and just pop the tent down when adventuring to store your haul eat/drink buff yourself with well rested/tuned and carry on
---
It is P2W
---
My friend just lost his after the raid. Went in to raid with his junk in the box, and now it's all gone, including vault steel.
---
Not all of us, and I have the downvotes to prove it.
---
We don't shit on newbs lol, and breaking lore fucks over the original fanbase
---
Yeah I think that is a possibility, but it is still a finite amount as opposed to an infinite one.
---
[Xbox Game Pass for PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-games) has an introductory offer of $1 for the first month. The Outer Worlds launches on it Friday.
---
Prepare to get downvoted, I agree with everything in this post
---
Your ini file would be appreciated. I may be able to point it to you if I see the line, but I can't remember what it is. Didn't start my computer in a year.
---
Well said. Folks are burning more energy on this than actually playing the game. 
---
Just look at all the "gaming" Youtubers "making hay (money)" off this subject.
---
Okay then. Thanks for sharing I guess.
---
Open fallout76prefs.ini

---
I'm loving the private servers, being able to farm Legendaries, claim workshops, solo events , I love it, could I do this on public servers, sure but the private server has been thus far worth it.
---
As far as the people who admit the never played they indeed are just parroting something they know nothing of. However there are many of us who bought this game and played it for a while in hopes it would get better. I put hundreds and hundreds of hours in, but eventually gave up hope. Admittedly the game is not trash, but on that same note it isn't worth buy now at this point. It definitely is not worth $100 a year in addition to the games costs.
---
Introducing the Fallout 76 paywall.   
---
Next step: Putting the X-01 power armor behind the paywall as well.
---
I think that's a bit harsh but okay.
---
True, but you won't have the 5/6 people are every event using Explosive Gatling Plasmas getting hit by every effect at once, so you know. 
---
Less crashing that way?
---
Omfg my first gold for a comment I made angry at 4am.....
---
Yup. It's striking to see it here in this thread. But I'm happy that pretty much everyone else outside of this sub is sane and criticizing the shit out of this.
---
I just want to say that it’s subscriptions and Microtransactions that make it possible for small Independent developers like Bethesda to create polished, quality games with infinite replayability like FO76.
---
Agree, I wrote something similar in another post, less extended but I totally agree with you
---
Holy god yes, very few people to no people cared about full paid expansions like Far Harbor, Nuka World, or Broken Steel. 
---
The only reason to move to micro transactions was to try to bilk more cash for exponentially less content.
---
does anyone know the name of the piece you play on the banjo at your survival tent? it's Soo hauntingly beautiful.
---
I feel dirty that I gave them money to do this. I basically bought a PS4 for this game and RDR2 and I’ve played 4 hours of 76 since release. At this point I don’t even want ES6
---
Give a few months and the Brits will get it at a bargain.
---
Oh. In this case... There's no help x_x try to give it to an army of griefer and then sell it to the people they grief. How to make civil wars to sell your weapons x_x
---
Bold alright.
---
First charge you 60 bucks or more for the game, then charge you 100 bucks a year to actually enjoy it.
---
What a riot.
---
I don't disagree that it's ridiculous that the limit is well...limitless.
---
they can be in alpha forever... i don't care! but when u discuss with them about: "ey the director spent almost all the raised money and is more concern about leather seats in the spacecraft than finish a system of 2 or 3 complete planets" they answer you with some "oh another one that came to harrass us, don't talk to him guys, he is a hater, etc, sound like a brainwashed cult
---
here at least you heard people saying, i like this, i hate that, i don't care, or beth pls just let me build my house full of bears, etc
---
I dont mean this as sarcasm, I've been following the fuck ups of this game since launch but never played, is anyone still playing this? Like... how? I've cried laughing at everything Bethesda has done to fuck this game and their reputation.
---
I was planing on coming back to this game when it got better. Looks like it really was just a money-grab :/
---
Shocking news: Loyalty doesn't matter to a soulless billion dollar corporation.
---
Guys, dont think that bethesda cares about its players.
---
Did you just give yourself silver before even one comment on this post?
---
I'm impressed
---
Yes we can all loot the same things, but they can hold more than non-premium players can hold because their junk will basically weigh nothing.
---
Yeah idk why bugthesda doesnt just make it 1000 dollars a year. These guys would just lap that shit up. They could make fallout the new FIFA and they'd still suck off daddy Todd.
---
It's already too late, I've seen quite a bit of people running around with the new vegas riot gear, on ps4
---
Alright thx for reporting back. I signed up myself and will try tomorrow
---
That damn game took a LOT of my allowance money. Still never got close to beating it.
---
Because they didn't do it. They could do all kinds of fucking things. They could make every enemy have 1HP. Or give every player the exact legendary weapon they want. You don't fucking need unlimited scrap. It's fucking everywhere. Just play the goddamn game. There has to be some fucking limitations or else there's no reason to play. All they're doing here is selling another fucking QoL mechanic for lazy players. You didn't need unlimited scrap for the past year, why the fuck do you need it now? What "problem" is there? Not having something you've never had or needed.
---
It can be that you have a CAMP in Savage Divide. On load it has a chance to show up on your camp.
---
It started as a reply to another post, then decided to finally write my "goodbye" post. Hopefully this contributes to BGS awareness of how bad they fucked up on this game, comparatively to their past successes.
---
It should've all been in the regular game
---
Place them next to each other.  They work well together.
---
I guess PC isn't such a master race after all.
---
You might not,but there are plenty that do. This game doesn't feel like it has any lore anyway. They should've made a story line and online for this. Online only kind kills the lore.
---
Taxes
---
He knows too much to be kept alive!
---
I don't want to hurt them. Don't be a psycho. I want them not to hurt me. Like, my pockets. Went back to Fallout 4, today, started a clean new character. It feels weird and nice.
---
I saw a picture of the ranger armor and it looked like it was a cheap knockoff. How does it look to you?
---
Nobody is asking for a handout.  We all paid for the game.  They are making continous revenue on the Atom shop.  I'm not against a sub for a premium service like Private Servers.
---
The scrap stash was originally supposed to be limitless, then they limited it with the rest of the stash when the game released, then they figured out the scrap stash was still OK to increase but instead of fixing it like a bug or problem they monetized the solution when they saw how badly it bothered people.  So they created an artificial problem and are now selling the solution.  The information regarding the scrap stash is miniscule for the servers to handle.  This is not hyperbole, it is obvious if you look at how the game engine handles data based on mod tutorials for Fallout 4, which this game's systems are based on (sometimes straight copied from).  I know you already know this because you were talking along these lines before the argument flipped on you.  You are shilling for them with your comments.
---
I would agree with you if it wasn't for all of the derp-shit stuff that they've had floating around this game for a YEAR that hasn't been fixed/adjusted/patched.
---
One thing that's overlooked is the angry mob on Reddit is the loud vocal minority. Yeah fallout first will piss people off, but i bet they will sell 1000x as many 1 month subs (to get the goodies and Scrapbox) as they get complaints.  
---
Its a weird time we live in. I personally don't trust review sites because they are influenced by money, or sjw reasons, or if a game has a bad patch its review bombed...hell even youtubers are getting iffy with me cause of the paid infuencer stuff. My point being that there's really no way to tell how bad f76 was, is or will be. The only thing for sure is the player base is solid and its not cool to go online and say f76 is fun. Funny how they contradict each other. So from a media or youtuber point of view it'll be bethesda bad cause they need clicks. From the majority of players it'll be either "that's cool" or "meh". But it wont be the big bad that causes actual boycotts or anything. 
---
For them to make fallout 1st if f76 was doing horrible, it would of been corporate suicide. So it must not of been as big of a overestimation as you'd think. I don't think having a sub is a horrible idea, but I do think for example if extra storage is locked behind it regular storage shouldn't be horrible.  There's def a better way this could of been done, hopefully it all smooth out
---
I'm right there with you. They don't fix the game or make it better they Just keep adding new stuff for us to buy. I don't even think I will try wastlanders. 
---
Your post was well said
---
I heard xbox marketplace has an issue, maybe too many people want a private server :) 
---
That would be funny but I'm sure most of reddit will blame bethesda somehow for Microsoft's shortcomings. Now well have to see those complaints
---
Yeah you’re right, my fault for crafting anything at all.  Shoulda just let it sit on the display shelf collecting dust
---
I'll let her know! I may grab this one for myself too. I may have to build a whole new camp for it.
---
You can get it for PC through the Xbox Game Pass as well, for what it's worth. That's how I'm getting it.
---
They have hit an all time low.  I can't believe they are doing this.  Sorry, but I'm out - I've already left the game and this just keeps me away from future games.  Starfield and ES6 is going to be just as bad based on what Bethesda is doing to FO76.  They are just plan greedy now.
---
We finally all pitched in and funded the one guy that was good enough at it to get the end, while we all watched over his shoulder. It took months to get there!
---
Nope just bend on over.
---
Good to know all you toxic people are leaving
---
Why did this post get taken down?
---
This is the one thing that bothers me most about this. If I'm paying $13 a month, I expect it to be persistent. I don't care about the other benefits in the slightest.
---
Make Congress make Bethesda give us our fucking refund
---
I guess with game developers, they either die or live long enough to become the villain. Bethesda has made it clear what's happened with them
---
Yep. A stack of a junk item is likely 4 bytes, the size of an unsigned integer. 
---
Why unsigned int?  Don't know the reason for the choice, but when I've seen quantities accidentally go negative, the amount displayed is the maximum value of an unsigned int, minus whatever the negative amount would have been.
---
Enjoy your Fallout 1st pass.
---
I paid for it, and so far have been left incredibly disappointed. 
---
My biggest problem with this game has always been that I've wanted to binge play and build workshops all day... I've always accepted the fact that tomorrow all of my stuff would be gone, but I've never been able to scratch that itch since literally day 1 because I'd just get disconnected from the server within an hour leaving me to start all over again. 
---
I hopped back on once again with the promise of private servers lifting my spirits that at the very least if the server is going to disconnect me, at least I can reconnect back to my workshops.... NOPE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE TODAY AND I GUESS IM STILL SIPPING ON THAT DUMB  BITCH JUICE THINKING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT.
---
Oh well... at least I got the unlimited crafting storage. I've been very frugal with what I've been putting into my stash so I still had plenty of space left, but what the heck might as well move my junk over anyway... WELL AFTER ONE OF THOSE FUCKING DISCONNECTS THAT BROUGHT ME TO A NEW WORLD, SURE AS HELL EVERYTHING I PUT IN THE SCRAPBOX HAD ALSO DISAPPEARED. 
---
Bethesda... Bethesda never changes
---
For whatever reason the first time you log in to a private server it resets a lot of your settings, make sure subtitles are still turned on, pacifist is on, etc
---
Here for the downvotes. Please provide and move on
---
Doesn't look like a cheap knockoff but it doesn't look quite the same. Helmet looks a bit off but I can't place why. Maybe because the art style of the game is slightly different than New Vegas?
---
It’s because of people like you that the industry keeps crashing down. STOP BUYING GAMES ON LAUNCH DAY thank you
---
Not to mention they'll be able to flood the market with all their items and legendaries.
---
So much for trading unwanted weapons and armour when no one wants them or wants a Bloodied explosive handmade for 500 caps guess I'll be scripping them away at 150 worth a day
---
There are way better things to spend money on. 
---
Supporting companies blindly that knowingly attempt to manipulate you to buy incomplete shit, then continuing to support that company by buying more shit. 
---
Idk, sounds pretty dumb to me.
---
Nice man. Don’t let the haters who live in their mothers’ basement get to you.
---
Yep my friend lost all his vault steel... We have been grinding for weeks..
---
I didn't say that.
---
You were crafting a bunch of ammo for a gun, that wasn't supposed to use that ammo type, and didn't even think that they might fix that? 
---
Should have built it in lower quantities, that way you wouldn't be stuck with 18k
---
Yep.   
---
Sucks don't it.   
---
This was inevitable the moment they put out a game that was unfinished. They needed to find a way to make it into a cash cow.   
---
That's what "live service game" means. It means that they'll find ways to keep content away from you unless you keep paying them for it, despite the fact that you paid $60 for the game.
---
This also means that they probably don't think Wastelanders will bring anyone back. If they did, they wouldn't have bumped it in favor of a blatant cash grab.
---
Delete and reinstall the game?
---
nah bro all that shit dying with the fuckin game
---
Yes, that’s true. But this isn’t something like eating or hygiene. Eating is mandatory for survival. Hygiene is necessary for bodily wellness. Going to the doctor is necessary for health. Getting your oil changed is necessary to maintain transportation, if one has a car. This isn’t comparable to those.
---
This is paying for a nonessential digital service. I could have said, and could still, get rid of my subscription and move all my junk back to my stash and manage it as I have been for the past six months, which has worked out well. Other players can do the same - and they do. 
---
1st isn’t necessary unless you feel so, and some do. I like being able to take the ammo plant and not worry about getting pwned, which is beneficial for me because most of my sales are ammo. 
---
Technically, that’s not saying much as I could farm Lucky Hole and Scrapper weapons and come out with more ammo in like fifteen minutes than I would at the Factory but the fact that folks who wanna farm workshops and not have to deal with PvP is a plus for those specific people. (I don’t mind PvP but not till I get my new build done.)
---
Plus I like the tent thingy.
---
Thank you for asking this though.
---
Nah I want them to know I'm pissed. Fuck em.
---
How's that 100$ a year subscription service treatin' ya? [lmfao they can't work for free, right??](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/144/567/d77.gif)
---
He also said that Blades was the "Purest Elder Scrolls Experience".
---
Trying to believe the man is like trying to believe Peter Molenux, Chris Roberts, Bobby Kottick, and the CEO of EA.
---
You have been kicked in the head so many times by fo76 that you have brain damage by now. I knew there was something fucky going on when they spent 3/4th of the last dev blogg on the private servers and other atomic shop stuff. (excluding the pics they used for padding of course)
---
Ummm ever heard of ESO plus?  This isn't going away. It is their business model. It is no surprise it is here.
---
\&gt;Who Bethesda "Licenses it out to" is up to them, so that is still 100% on them to ensure that who they go with is reputable and reliable, and they failed to do both on multiple separate occasions. 
---
Hence why I said "Now yes bethesda should have thought twice about licensing it out to these people". 
---
\&gt; When I pay you my money, it is your job to ensure that that product gets to me on time and in the condition expected in, period, and any company that cares about it's customers wouldn't allow a canvas bag to simply not be made out of canvas without warning weather they directly produced them or not. 
---
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAH IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS ON THE FUCKING ADVERTISING REEEEEEEEEE KILL BETHESDA REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE". Shit fucking changes and usually it's out of our hands. This is why you don't buy collector's editions, I'm sorry you were dumb enough to drop hundreds of dollars on collector's items. 
---
\&gt;besides, even if what you say is true, which it isn't, they still chose to compensate the players by giving them 5 bucks worth of currency that couldn't even buy a canvas bag in game, so I think it's pretty obvious that they don't really care. 
---
If they truly didn't care, this game would have been dead a long time ago. we wouldn't have gotten nuclear winter, or wastelanders or literally any other update to this game. It would be dead like fucking mass effect andromeda and they would be moving on to something else. 
---
\&gt; No major game in recent history has been as glitchy as 76 was on launch, and it is still very buggy to this day, so don't even try that "they were always like this" nonsense, because thats a massive exaggeration to say the least. 
---
Yes, they fucking were. Do you not remember fallout 4's launch? Skyrim's? fuck even new vegas, the apparent fucking golden child of fallout that was literally always perfect, was fucking buggy as fuck. Fuck i couldn't even get fallout 4 to work properly until literally a month ago. Saying that no bethesda game in history is as buggy as 76 was is fucking disingenuous as fuck, not only that but it shows that you don't even know a goddamn thing about what the fuck it is you're talking about. Need i fucking remind you of shit like the dancing dragon skeletons of skyrim? 
---
Fucking Christ, bethesda's nickname is literally "Bugthesda" there's literally a whole fucking meme based around the fact that they let modders fix their fucking games because they're always so fucking broken. 
---
"no bethesda game is as buggy as 76" my hairy fucking ass, get the fuck out of here with that fucking lying bullshit. 
---
\&gt;Im not even a part of this subreddit, so dont go off about me being part of "you guys". 
---
Then why are you even here? do you even play the game? should i even take your opinion seriously?
---
\&gt;Hahahah, no, no, the Atom Shop is not what keeps them running. 
---
Yes, it actually is. what do you think the money from the atom shop goes towards? Part of it goes towards the servers, and the rest goes towards new games. All of the budget for elder scrolls 6 has to come from somewhere. 
---
\&gt;They could keep them running just fine without the Atom Shop, thats just nonsense they made up to keep getting peoples money. 
---
No, it's not. that's literally how any game works. Do you not understand how a business works? the money literally has to come from somewhere to pay their programmers and writers and what not and to get the next game off of the ground.
---
\&gt;The Fallout franchise has quite a lot of money to keep servers runnin bud. 
---
Again, that's not how it fucking works. 
---
\&gt; I have Bethesda to blame for 76, and not you, nor anyone else will convince me, the media, or the fans of anything to the contrary. 
---
I never said they weren't to blame for how buggy 76 is. I even said straight up that all they did was make a buggy fucking game like the rest of their games. learn to fucking read. 
---
\&gt;You haven't actually looked into this nearly enough if you think for a second that Bethesda isn't culpable to 90% of this at minimum. 
---
Again, I never said they weren't responsible for how 76 turned out. Again, I said, straight up, that they made a buggy game, like they usually do. 
---
\&gt; Some of this stuff is literally criminal, thats why they're getting sued as I type this. 
---
ok.
---
It will come later. Lots of the free states stuff is broke up now.
---
It's going in this pack for exclusive rights. Hang on. It will be it's own thing in the shop sooner or later. I'd happly spend my saved up atoms.
---
Apparently some people use them but I still consider those three to be busted. All of them are early game as you stated.
---
See, Bethesda has always been at least decent with stories and lore; Skyrim didn't have a full story on the surface, but the lore behind Elder Scrolls is incredible. But this is really kinda like Destiny 1 when it came out levels of no story lol
---
Assuming they care at all about game economy at this point.
---
BAHAHAHAHA they're trying to make up for lost projected earnings cause this game sux and they know it
---
Yet the people on this sub have gone back to supporting this shit game every time. I actually saw someone say that it was the final straw and would be their last pre-order. What a joke.
---
My optimistic ass is hoping the pigs at the top somehow change their ways. If not uninstalling within 24 hours
---
Love seeing a valid complaint post (purely for visibility of the problem) get actively downvoted. The toxicity of this subreddit is something else.
---
i was wondering, would they strip you off of that ranger outfit if you stop paying for the subscription fee??
---
They just as dumb......
---
Read the pinned thread.
---
For $12.99 a month or $8 a month if you get a whole year you get:
---
- Private servers
---
- Unlimited scrap stash to help free up inventory space
---
- A tent to make for easier fast travel, storage of gear, and so on
---
- 1650 atoms a month which is equal to $16 USD
---
- extra stuff such as emotes, badges, and an outfit
---
While I know value is up to your own perception, if we are just looking at the hard evidence, the subscription does offer what I would consider good value. When you look at how much atoms cost separately and the amount you get for one month of 1st, the subscription is a steal just in regards to the atoms you get each month. 
---
For a company that is apparently super greedy, Bethesda is selling this subscription at a bargain price. Plus it’s completely optional.
---
Yea, the markets gonna crash
---
Well if I'm not playing anymore what do I care.
---
Was able to find it. Don't know if its true or not since it came from their own site but here you go. Scroll down into the atomic shop section and you can find their claims without any real statistics 
---

*guy drops c4 on your base from 200 feet up for no reason*
---
"yeah it's called pvp bro, get good"
---
I figured out the cause: When I spawn in the game still, the upper half of my screen, the trees are black. Once I move my mouse, it will drag and smudge the screen. Something to do with tree rendering or leaves or branches?
---
&gt;Can you explain how *I'm* getting ripped off.
---
Outer Worlds comes out in 1 day and Bethesda delayed Wastelanders to an undisclosed date in Q1 2020. By the time Wastelanders comes out Outer Worlds will have been around for a minimum of 2 months (and up to as much as 5 months) with the only update to FO76 being this $100 subscription. 
---
There is also no guarantee Wastelanders won’t be delayed again, if it’s not just cancelled outright. It should be a red flag to anyone looking forward to Wastelanders that they not only delayed it but in its place put a new monetization, one that offers in game advantages. They do not see the development of Wastelanders as worth the money and want people to buy the subscription to justify continued development. If not enough people do it is entirely possible they could abandon the game.
---
Nice! I hope you enjoy, server issues are still a huge possibility, were seeing multiple versions of each other just as in the regular mode.
---
I mean, Nintendo's been around for almost 40 years, and they're doing okay I think?
---
They knew people would want that NCR armor and would pay anything to get it, I’m tempted to sign up literally just for that armour. But I need to be strong

---
That sux, but I'll still be trying for myself before jumping to any conclusions.
---
Well, I guess some dont mind pay to win/boost/whatever
---
Just delete the game. It’s only getting worse from here.
---
I'm not sure what to change it to, changed it to 1 did nothing, removing the 5 DOF lines did nothing too.
---
Thx Todd 
---
Now give us more stash so we can play haha
---

[Tent](https://i.imgur.com/3R0GdFi.png)
---
I'm more about the scrap stash. Not that I will subscribe for it. The fast travel tent also seems nice. Again, no way I will pay for it while the game is still crashing sometimes. That should be their number 1 focus. A game should never crash. They have priced it wrong. They should give you like 3k atoms a month. And the price should be more like $3.99 a month. And then whatever discounted yearly based off of that. Then I might consider it. Outer Worlds is a definite buy in 2 days. I just got an amazing game called Satisfactory I highly recommend. If you ever played Factorio it is like that but in a beautiful 3d environment. It's SO good!
---
But as for $12.99 or $100 a year. That's not going to happen with this game. I already spent enough on it, and was even tempted into buying the Summer Atom bundle with the extra atoms on PS4 just to buy something I didn't want to miss. I came back after a year or whatever and when the game crashes I pretty much vow to not spend any more on the game, because they have had plenty of time to fix that and it should be a priority. Stability is the most important thing, and games shouldn't even be sold in the first place if they don't have it.
---
I'm sure even then they'll defend Bethesda, I really liked this game even though it was buggy af, even though Bethesda were clearly being scummy, I gave it and them the benefit of the doubt I hit lv236 the other day and have over 600 hours on 76 but now, now I'm thinking of quitting it's just one thing after another with Bethesda
---
cause its not a server but your own personal world something they dont fully explain
---
Oh shit i put all my 120 vault steel on scrap box, now I’m at work and can’t check it, stressful situation.
---
Agree. 
---
Just keeps the cycle going of fucking over people with a sense of fairness who expect what they pay for.
---
It's ruining gaming IMO.
---
I was a legend at the MK arcade cabnit. By legend i mean i spammed scorpions cheap ass attacks. Could play sp and extended my time by taking on anyone who would come by.
---
Damn game still took all my allowance.
---
I still remember at launch when people could do the unlimited carry weight glitch and Bethesda claimed it was crashing the servers. Then after it was fixed people were still crashing like crazy. It's hard to believe any game that has come out in the last couple years could have such terrible issues with their servers that something as simple as people having items would cause them to crash, and then they bring this out.
---
Trying to launch 76's PC beta as it uninstalled itself on day one.
---
Windows XP is a real limitation, try deleting the sys32 folder, worked for me, not looked back.
---
Dammit I need it!
---
Dude every time we get outraged the PR people just straight up ignore us for a while, don't reply to any thread, and when it settles down they randomly act like it never happened.
---
They do NOT deserve a raise at all.
---
I completely agree. 
---
Hopefully your post doesn't get downvoted into oblivion (no pun intended xD) just because you expressed a concern about a videogame (and developer) you truly enjoyed.
---
The thing is. If you LIE in advertisements, it's not a "slogan". It's something that's considered a lie and you can get your ass SUED for it.
---
They're not private servers, they're private sessions.
---
They're making a continuous revenue from the atom shop?  You mean the shop that everyone always complains has crap that's also too expensive and how they're never going to buy any of it?  The same shop where when people do buy something it's for free using their challenge atoms instead of spending real money?
---
Bethesda didn't put out repair kits, the collectron, fridge and now this crap because they're masochists that love negative publicity... the atom shop has more than likely been a colossal flop that isn't bringing in anywhere near the revenue they need to keep the game going.
---
Its still on a server
---
Thanks!
---
I don’t think those are the same as it costs 12£ in UK
---
So having an unlimited stash for things that are pretty essential for the game compared to normal players having to manage their stash isn't pay to win? " In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-**paying** peers. " This is the literal definition of pay to win, it doesn't have to include PvP, Warframe is a good example, mostly PvE game, you can LITERALLY pay for gear. Your definition of pay to win is wrong.
---
No, because it's not even an actual private server for $99 a year.
---
Not anymore it don't
---
I did, but i didnt buy it for the server...i wont use it.   Out of curiosity though..how many words am i beyond?
---
GUYS watch me fanboy for a SOULLESS BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION ahahahha am i funny guys? Bro its hard to type with toddcock down my throat bro
---
i almost gave into it for 10 minutes....then i thought about it and also remembered how i hated the eating/drinking forced mechanc from the beta and said nope........ lost of sale from me! and this is a game thats on sale for 16 bucks on amazon! nope not even lol
---
I've always found hilarious that all players end up with hundreds of useless note items when the stash problem exists
---
Not everyone. I’m not. Nor are any people I play with. What system are you playing on?
---
Have you let other players into your server yet? Does that work in the Social menu. Can someone who is youe friend join you on their own or do you have to invite them?
---
It should act just as adventure does only just for you and friends
---
Do you remember if the box showed up immediately or if you had to tweak something in the INI to make it work?  I thought I followed the install instructions but when I boot up the game, there is no chat window.
---
PC not sure howd they do it though.
---
1) They already made a promise to the players that there would be no paid DLC.
---
2) They’ve already shown what they intend to do with their resources - make more paid garbage. 
---
There is no scenario where this is justified. Don’t bend over backwards trying to change that.
---
They said it would
---
That's how I felt about it... I hope you have a better experience than I did
---
Hey! I’m interested in your 44 ammo. Would you take 2.5k?
---
Hate to burst your bubble, homeslice.
---
Most triple A titles, and as a courtesy most independant titles, I've purchased in the last two decades come with a variety of play options. It is not common practice to charge a monthly fee to access these components, which are generally regarded as an effortless and customary inclusion. For most companies, this is a basic afterthought and scarcely heralded as a feature. 
---
This is especially true for the multiplayer looter shooter genre, even when they specialise exclusively in online play. For example: Destiny, Borderlands, the Division, Warframe, Monster Hunter World, or any other genre-competitor tends to facilitate for private party play.
---
I don't think I should expect different from Bethesda. 
---
Regardless of whether you consider Fallout an MMO or not, Bethesda should not be strong arming customers into an atom-oriented cosmetic-focused subscription service by pay walling functionality.
---
Peace.
---
 Why are you excited for features you made up that aren't in the game? There is no dirt bikes or horses in this.
---
Haha yes
---
Personally, I think the shoulders look a little...off when comparing to the original. But who knows if Bethesda's planning on fixing them up before release.
---
It looks good though, just buy it
---
i know a game made by them with an unlimited stash that doesnt require a monthly free nor requires online....
---
FALLOUT FOUR!
---
and consider they rip half of the assets from that game anyways.......
---
Looks like the mouth part needs to stick out just a tad more. Looks too flat imo
---
I'll be buying it, maybe even 2, 1 for my son &amp; one for me, I think it's awesome
---
Just because you don't agree doesn't mean every player does.
---
That was on automated reply number 3. Already tried that.
---
I was actually going to make a thread about this very thing, but then I saw this one and figured it has the same message already.  So I'll just post what I had written in that opening post and title since it's still relevant.
---
**Stop giving them ideas**
---
Yes, really.
---
I'm not even joking.  Think about it.  It seems like every time the community presents and gets behind an idea they'd like to see in the game, we always get that semi-promising line that it's going to be passed forward to the Bethesda development team by our local community manager.  
---
Months later, it might actually become a reality.. In the form of Atom Shop content... And now we've got a subscription service with exclusive items people asked for too.  I guarantee the majority of people asking for that stuff didn't want it to arrive like that.
---
Do people not realize how irritating that actually is when you compare the amount of community ideas that are added to the game *without* some payment wall?  You could probably count the times on two hands.  This game is just severely lacking any real community content improvements or additions compared to what gets put into the Atom Shop bin.
---
When I think of community feedback in a game, I think of an idea, ranging from repurposing existing things, or a completely new idea that contributes to the game's overall content.  In some other video games that actually value community feedback and want people to keep playing, this would be the way to do it, but in Bethesda's case, community feedback is just a way to extract ideas for content they know people want, and then to monetize and sell those ideas.  Even if the ideas for that content already exist in the game (looking at you, Bungalow).
---
So, yes.  I'm suggesting if you genuinely care about this game, stop giving Bethesda your good ideas, because until they start providing content everybody can enjoy without walls, it's a waste of your creative juices that will invariably end up servicing only Bethesda so that they can make more money. Neither you, nor the community gets to enjoy any of it unless you can fork up the cash, or grind for Atoms the slow way.
---
I’m interested in the ammo. Would you take 2.5k?
---
I dont know why, Im upvoting you haha
---
People need to understand we're shitting on Bethesda not because we just want to whine about the update, but instead because we care about this game and want to see it strive.
---
I've played this game for 350 hours and still enjoy it.  I would hardly describe it as blind support.
---
&gt; level 1 dead money run
---
respect
---
They got a free player icon
---
Interesting, it’s like from in-game I get redirected to the store only to have an empty page. Oh well I guess
---
600 hours is a lot if you weren’t enjoying yourself. 
---
$60 for 609 hours is pretty good lol
---
I can understand a f2p game having a premium service but what on earth is this garbage?? 🤦‍♀️ why, Bethesda?? What happened to the content being FREE except for cosmetics??
---
What platform?
---
Hell yeah, lets boogy
---
Ps4
---
I would be 100% happy paying £12 a month if it was free to play.
---
wastelanders will keep being delayed and or canned
---
they dont give a shit about pleasing the fans. they just want our money
---
NOT THIS TIME!
---
You won't use it? Not even once when no one is looking? I have no words. lol
---
Oh. Super exciting :| thanks for letting me know
---
You know I wouldn’t be against buying into this if my monthly food budget could actually get more than $50 in it. Cry haters all you want but some people can’t afford to put $100 more into the game
---
A fuck up? One? One singular fuck up? Holy hell it has to be bad before you call things a fuck up.
---
You just reminded me..i guess i lost two pieces worth😭
---
Oh shit didn't even notice. Yeah they look a little wonky. Definitely need them to be lowered on the ends there.
---
Your thread was well worded and made a lot of sense so maybe YOU need that raise ;)
---
What would you do with your stash?  I like to let my creativity go wild.  Right now I’m hoarding all the clipboards i can find.  It’s just such a privilege to be in such a healthy community that is always innovating in our sandboxes.
---
Possible future mods, first sentence
---
You're right some don't. I am not defending Bethesda. I am just saying that this has been their business model for a while now with Elder Scrolls.  It is making them money on that game so why would the not bring it here. 
---
I am just amazed though at the amount of outrage. Do Fallout players live with their heads in the sand?  This is nothing new from Bethe$da.
---
It is private. It's just not run locally.
---
Or if they needed revenue, they could just, you know? Made a good game from the start? Not have been greedy and gotten bad press cause of it? Paying 13 dollars a month for very little is the problem. And so is the 100 dollars for the yearly subscription in general. Look at any other games monthly subscription passes and tell me you get less content for more money. That's just not the case.
---
Dude stop. ESO and WOW have exact same stuff and those games are making millions lol smh
---
Pay a dollar for the first month of ultimate and get a plethora of xbox and PC titles to pay
---
I thought the atom skins where the lowest it could grt
---
This is like george Bush and Donald trump all over again
---
She could have put it toward paying off a few pages of one of the textbooks I bet, or one day of on-campus parking.
---
We already bought the fucking game for $60 though.
---
We'll see how you feel when this pushes more people away, they can't keep the lights on, Bethesda abandons it hoping that supporting it for over a year will make people less angry, and the servers are all shut down. Sometime in mid to late 2020 probably
---
you sound like a Vault-Tech employee
---
yup private server fees i can see but the extra bullshit just thrown on for the rest of players who dont NEEd a private server?
---
bullshit!
---
In 15 minutes, I've seen this post go from 1 to 5, to -2, to +1, to +4, and back down to +1. 
---
Wish all these downvoters would express why they're doing this. I feel like I explained myself in a well behaved manor and didn't offend anyone. I guess if you finally give up on a game after struggling with it for a year, constantly supporting and defending it, it's still a worthless opinion.
---
I see no need to pay for the subscription but some people do. All the power to them. $100 is less than 2 hours worth of work but i don’t see the value personally.
---
I had held out hope for Fallout 76, if for no other reason than Private servers.
---
I had this grand ideal of a Fallout 76 with the mods that i like on it, playing it how i wanted, and having my friends able to join that world.
---
$100 for the privilege? Mods not currently implementable (past what is already possible). All they did was make a server with reduced player numbers. This could make it more stable, but i'd wager that they will increase the number of instances each server runs accordingly.
---
WTF
---
Considering how Bethesda has ruined/damaged several iconic games in last year, i really hope that Doom eternal lives up to its hype and breaks the trend.
---
A **LOT** of the reviews I have seen are making it quite obvious that if you've at least played FO:NV you'll feel like TOW is carrying on Obsidians Fallout torch, which makes me happy because the first time they showed off TOW I felt a Fallout in space vibe from it.
---
That's probably the case.
---
Just now realized i lost a few pieces worth as well..now that hurts lol🙈
---
With the amount of time it takes them to pump out atomic shop items I doubt them making a few emotes, an outfit, a small tent base model, and a small model for the scrap box would even cost them a week worth of time to make. Them pushing back wastelanders is more than likely because they want to avoid what they did with the game at launch, not because making a few small models for the private servers subscription somehow ended up taking months to make.
---
If you want to be angry with the subscription I’d direct it at the scrap box being able to be used in public servers and the server apparently not staying up after the host leaves. The host leaving and causing the server to close is basically just having the one who paid for the subscription host an offline game at that point, not them paying for a private server. As for the scrap box that’s just them being greedy, it’s like the fridge or collector bot, but now you have to pay a monthly fee for them now which is a bit ridiculous.
---
They hate us cause they ain't us.
---
ESO is also free to play tho
---
nope.
---
it prints money!
---
I lost all my junk on my main character with the scrap box  but it stayed with my other characters so far lost a ton of flux an stuff 😤
---
it is an unethical and arguably fraudulent move, and you support it, good job
---
I moved over everything and that was a mistake.  Shouldn’t have put all my faith in it.
---
based on the few tidbits that i was able to get from their posts i was able to come up with this. each region has a different server and within each server are the various worlds. each time we think we are "server hopping" we are actually changing worlds not servers. so because of this we dont have a private server but instead our own private world on the private server. since its our own personal world we can do the "server hopping" we do on adventure mod. have a feeling this is how it is for them cause it will also make sense to have it like this for later on when we can mod them. instead of modding a big thing like a server we will be modding a smaller private world. but this is all speculation based on the fact that bethesda has said we get our own private world and not private server. can even go on their site and it says worlds not servers.
---
give me all of your sweet rolls
---
A price like 2,99$/ month from 100 people would be better than whatever it costs now from the 5 people willing to pay for this bs. 
---
Not paying a dime for this bad copy of an eso+ membership.
---
Eh, I’m gonna have to drive a hard bargain. Do you think there’s a lot of people looking for .44 ammo atm? I am at least. 7k
---
EA + Loot boxes = Bethesda + FO76
---
Have you learned nothing? I expected more from you. 
---
*"You're breaking my heart."* -Gamers
---
Yeah. But Bethesda Austin failed utterly with their first game. So hard that Bethesda didn't even release Battlecry.   
---
Fallout 76 was their 2nd chance and this is what they produced.   
---
They are not blameless nor should they really continue to produce titles on their own. If I ran Bethesda, I'd scrap Bethesda Austin and relocate it's staff to other projects, then fire the lead designers or maybe put them in less harmful roles within the company.   
---
Or just fire the lead developer, and put the company on QA and other support tasks.
---
Why would someone downvote this?
---
Definitely gonna be more fun if it pops up in closer succession now.
---
Thank fuck. I miss the wild Appalachia one.
---
I thought about trying that but if I did I’d get all 5 characters maxed first then offload it all
---
No. I’m saying if you can’t afford something in a luxury video game that’s not Bethesda’s or any other game companies problem. Get a better job or do what you can afford.

the Fallout 76 Elites 
---
lol
---
I have ~600 hours in game and still discovering new things in game. It’s natural to get bored at some point with a game. Totally fine. Big update coming in a few months. Take a break lol
---
Especially because the game is literal dogshit not worth a dollar.
---
That comment doesn’t even make since. A subscription service that’s “not like spending money”. I’m guessing you mean that if you are already buying atoms then it’s not like you are spending more money?
---
And what I socialist about standing up for consumer rights. Bethesda marketed and sold this game with the promise that updates and dlc would be free to all players, and that micro transactions would be cosmetic only. That is clearly not the case now.
---
nope
---
it will go for a new mobile game no one asked for.
---
Considering I've played over 1000 hours of new vegas, and been in the nexus community for 10+ years...you're wrong.
---
Both my dad and I love to play games but we don't have a lot of money so when we heard bethesda was dropping fallout 76 we were both really exited and decided we were going to save up out money and buy the tricentennial edition so after about 2 months we pre ordered it and waited for the beta and if im being 100% honest I really enjoyed the beta (although I was lucky and didn't get nearly the amount of game breaking bugs that some others did) I played it for about 3 months and slowly stopped simply because of the lack of content and my dad stopped soon after. Then they released the road map with all of the really cool free dlc that was supposed to be coming out so I decided to hop back into it and I was let down at the lack of effort put into the thing that was supposed to bring 76 from the ashes but no all it did was dump more endless,useless, and boring content onto a game that was already over flowing with it. and even through all of that I still found myself having fun and exploring the wastes. Then I heard about this latest update coming out and I was so happy from the new factions to the npc's and the private server's.But this is genuinely the final straw I am so sick of feeling lied to and cheated out of my money at every single corner. I thought bethesda was one of the few AAA devs that still cared about their product and there audience but boy was I ever wrong. They are just as bad as the lying two timing scum bags at ea and activision
---
You know what they say about a fool and his money.
---
I have the service. You can call it session but it does save your workshop builds. You just have to reclaim them when you go back in. Once reclaimed they are already set up with extractors, defenses etc.
---
I had this happen to me when I logged into a regular server the first time after the update. My visual and audio settings were back to default.
---
Funnily enough, the damage indicator option for Survival is still there 😂
---
Oh boy, where to start? All right: "...Fascists understand this very well and it’s something they’re very very  good at; they use inflammatory rhetoric but strive to maintain plausible  deniability right up until the point where they start dragging people  from their beds. "
---
\- No, they are actually very clear in what the are planning to do. They do not care about deniability. Hitler wrote in "Mein Kampf" exactly what he was planning, everything about conquering "Lebensraum" (i.e. waging war) in the east all the way to the eradication of the Jewish "race". And most people didn't believe him. And they slowly but steadily increased their terror. It started with armed guards at party meetings, dressed in the infamous brown colors of the SA, then they but up signs on Jewish shops, then they burned them and the terror unfolded. There is nothing subtle about fashism. It cannot be by definition as it primarily is an ideology that aims at the less privileged and less educated individuals. They feel they are being taken seriously by their leader, theri fears are adressed and the reasons their simple minds came up with for why the world is how it is are being named and the responsible ethnicity is being pointed out. And most of those did not need some symbols on a flag or speech for them to come over and spy on their neighbors and rat them out to the Gestapo. All they needed was to feel as part of a majority. A large group can in their minds not be wrong. Fashism just enhanced what was already there and the tendency to generalize based on skin color, religion and ethnicity is the very beginning.
---
" I don’t live in one of those countries; "
---
\- So Imma gonna go out on a limb here: based on the fact that promoting fashist ideas is not illegal in your country, the fact that you are still up at 2am GMT and your posting history reg. nuclear power in the US I'm assuming you live in the US. Now, as far as I am aware, your first amendment to the constitution does guarantee you freedom of speech but not freedom of violence, so it would be illegal even in the US to just go at someone and punch him, however "noble" your intent may be. The fact that you don't agree with the pretense of the rule of law (as you said " I don’t put much value in the “rule of law” as you frame it as, at least  in my country, laws are written by greedy, corrupt, and immoral people  and the quality of said laws reflect that") is a bit problematic. Morality is a question of perspective. For a fundamental Christian in the mid west it would be amoral to promote premarital sexual intercourse while the same would be true reg. entering a marriage without establishing sexual compatibility first for a more progressive person. That is why there are laws. Because whatever you believe is morally right is not the same for someone else.
---
For example, you were talking about flags and what they represent. Now the US flag, hasn't really changed since 1776. Neither has any of your general democratic "set up" of your country. So this very flag of yours represents 189 years of slavery, about 290 year of hard racial segregation, genocide in the Phillipine-American War, Genocide against native American populations, mass killings of civilians in Vietnam as well as the contamination of vast areas of land based on a lie (Gulf of Tonkin incident), invasion and killing of up to one million Iraqis based on a lie (WMDs, Powell lying to the UN) and several smaller atrocities over those 243 years. Yet still there are a lot (if not most) of Americans who are "proud" to be one and fly one of those flags. I think you might wanna start punching people, you have quite a few to go.
---
"....Greedy... ....gaming companies..."
---
\- It all comes down over and over to the same tune: You don't like what they do. Don't buy it. Other people might see that differently and don't have a problem shelling out a hundred bucks and feel good about it. I think bullying them because of their opinion is in its very foundation the absolutely wrong thing to do.
---
Yeah I just kind if thought of that but if it really works that way it's a pretty good idea.
---
i already beat you to it. i played the beta and havent touched the retail game!
---
i WAS gonna get the game this weekend plus a private server
---
but now?
---
nope!
---
not even for 16 bucks for the base game on amazon lol
---
Do you realize that giving them atoms doesnt give them any money right? They make money from people buying atoms. Theoretically they are losing money on mtx initially when people buy it, the longer you pay for it and the more people who buy it who normally wouldn't buy atoms is when Bethesda starts making real money
---
Whatever way you wanna look at it. It’s private.
---
ESO have the content and support to justify their subscription. 76 doesn't have enough of either to justify it's initial purchase price.
---
&gt;We have  microtransactions in Fallout 76. But, they’re only cosmetic. Anything  we’re selling for real money you can also buy with in-game currency that  you get as a reward while you play.
---
I dug a deep hole and dropped everything about Blizzard in my mind into it.
---
Honestly, they started fucking us over around the Cataclysm Expansion.
---
Games back then rarely supported  hundreds of hours of play time.  Half this sub has more then a few hundred hours on this game.  I think they delivered in the full game department.  A bit buggy and glitchy but the content was more than worth the price.  It’s clear they fucked up with the marketing of the game and stating it would never have a subscription plan, but I’d rather this be the option then the game unable to support itself and otherwise shut down.
---
The ones where people are pissed off, or the ones where the few fans still lost in denial are desperatelying try to defend Bethesda's move here?
---
Sorry for delayed response, had to annoy my brother to update the game and try it out, but as someone said, they can just join off you. Social menu has a "(private)" next to your name
---
If I knew how to upload a clip of me doing it I'd would show it as proof but it's not worth the trouble
---
Lol, it’s not bad. It’s kind of lonely. But it’s nice being able to be at peace and have workshops and what not. I had friends passing through. Just to see what I was doing. I held every workshop for about 3 hours just cause. Had ALOT of mobs EVERYWHERE I went. Felt like hundreds of ghouls a at whitesprings, hundreds of scorched down at the queen fight. Best running game experience I’ve had with Fallout 76 since I bought the game. Zero lag, no disconnects, friends said their ends were running smooth. 
---
Now keep in mind with all this, I usually spent about $15 a month on this game anyways just for grins and giggles. Just to ad to what I had and to get some stuff I want.  I don’t by everything, in fact I’ve bought only a few bundles. However, that $15 I WAS spending already, is now getting me MORE atoms, and a quiet server to listen to the wild. 
---
There were no random gunshots or explosions in the distance, there were no explosions around every corner. There were however full scale wars breaking out at places like the steel mill, between the occupying mutants and a random horde of like 50 ghouls that spawned in at the spawn point with me.
---
I totally agree!  For me, it’s a savings!  I’m addicted to the atomic shop.  It’s really a private passion of mine.  Now I can save money AND enjoy the best darn game ever created!
---
Not totally true. I've been disconnected twice today with all of my workshop builds completely gone
---
By the mere fact you're playing the game, you're supporting. You're making it appear less dead to other players, be a +1 active player statistic for management to justify further anti-consumer practices.
---
The best way to deal with is is the same way you deal with content creators you don't agree with/want to support - don't engage with Bethesda. Don't play their games, don't watch their videos. Just nothing.
---
Yes, you're not helping out with revenue but by playing you're still helping.
---
Willingness to spend more money on a video game you already paid for on content that is arguably not even good value for what you receive.
---
It of course also depends on how you define something as 'good value', since someone might genuinely believe they're getting good value, but either way, I'd say it's safe to assume you're in whale territory if you're spending more than the price of a subscription, or more than the game you already paid for in recurring payments.
---
It's mostly just that willingness to continue spending regardless of quality.
---
I love you think putting a emote on this makes it a comeback, instead of just revealing your inability to parse a simple sentence.
---
Um what😂 lol and dlc is free what are you talking about and what pay to win micro transactions have they added? I’ll wait.
---
If you can prove to me a single thing in the entire game that’s pay to win maybe you can convince me
---
The lesson of 2019 gaming: Never touch anything called a "live service game". No matter what IP is attached.
---
i never started! just played the beta :-p said meh.... pass for now
---
boy was i right!
---
i actually enjoyed the beta . just not enough for the full game and hated the eating and drinking part.
---
It's easy people are selfish.  Everyone knows bethesda is greedy lying dirtbags.  The fact that they outright lied to a giant consumer based effectively tricking their base to buy the full priced game is bad enough.  These people simply dont care that they contribute to the corporate wheel and greed.  They love the game (nothing wrong with that) and they simply dont wanna stand up to blatant unethical behavior.  Their addiction to the game overrides ethics and morality they would sooner enjoy their hobby and feed the devil then stand up to it and demand a better product later.  They are free to choose that.  Some people simply wont learn.  Hopefully there is a larger percentage of people who make a stand, for the future of fallout
---
&gt; most of us 
---
speak for yourself
---
Considering how it looks, it wouldn't surprise me in slightest if its an asset pulled from F:NV directly.
---
Thankfully there is already a variation, better imo, on nexus.
---
Bli$$ard is thanking their lucky stars this happened before Blizzcon. It truly is a race to the bottom between EA, Activision/Blizzard, Bioware, and Bethesda.
---
No, that was a gamestop-exclusive thing not the PA edition helmet.
---
No offense taken.
---
My personal bugs with the challenges is more that the dailies are a 50/50 chance of already being done when I sign in for the day, therefore, as you said, not receiving Atoms but for challenges that are "already completed." This has happened so many times since launch, I probably have missed out on 10k Atoms by now. I do have a few actual challenges that are incomplete still that I'm hoping they will continue to retroactively fix (some of the explore in Toxic Valley and whatnot). I also have 9/10 for Grognak but it's showing 8/10 (I've collected every magazine twice to make sure). I know they fixed the cooking recipes one but I've noticed they are slow to fix challenge bugs in general, probably so that people will buy Atoms. I hadn't even seen the comment about them switching the rewards for new players. Ridiculous.
---
That’s subjective. Lol some people who play all day dont think ESO has enough content so stop lol😂
---
I would assume so...
---
It's Dumb...
---
demand a refund lol, I'd argue it's fraud
---
I'm doing something similar. I had loaded everything into it. But after hers went missing I took it all out and put in my regular stash. And then just put the Overflow in it and I'm going to test and see how long it takes
---
So how long have you been playing for?
---
Maybe something tied to the shadow. Try to compare to a normal ini file (I hope you're doing some backup before tweaking, if not I encourage you to do so with at least one default file). Shadowblending, volumetric light, shadow filter. I'd go for these.
---

EDIT: Formatted a bit better, highly recommend just Ctrl+Fing through this to see if what you want is there
---
Nah. Go f yourself.
---
Nah, u/chet_brosely gave it to me. If I'm gonna waste money on useless Reddit coins, I'm at least going for gold.
---
I still remember paying 60 for games that you could run through in less than an hour, and that was if they weren't flickering so bad that you could actually play them.  The 80s were cruel.
---
I can see that but at least it’s possible but yea I understand what you’re saying, especially since there was a promise for “free dlc’s” but we live in a world that revolves around money unfortunately
---
Fuck me yourself you coward!
---
Yes I agree but sadly at this rate people would rather pay to play a shit game and pretend it’s great then ask for something better
---
Don't get me wrong I liked the game, *liked* and wanted it to be great once the bugs were fixed, but they're not fixed and this P2W shit is the final nail it won't get better they won't fix anything just churn out more atom shop crap
---
Hero
---
I saved up for 76. I was told everything would be free. No paywalls, no extra shim-sham-sharoo. I was told 16x the detail, you’d never see a server, and that it just works. I hopped in the Beta and what I’ve had has been a mostly horrible experience. I finally started back up in the game and was actually enjoying it for the first time. I was on a roll with an actually decent character and build. Then this just soured everything. Basic quality of life features locked behind a paywall. Never mind the extra repair kits and scrap shits. I can’t even 100% this game if I ever decided to go full completionist just because some old quests and even some of the pioneer scout badges are forever bugged unless they fix it in the future. It was the first and last game I ever preordered and I hate myself for every moment of it. So yea, if life was different I’d be ok with paying for more. But it’s not. It’s a shit show
---
So traditional or bust? Got it chief 😂
---
I have been hopping servers all day. Everytime I go back into my "private server" my workshops are as I left them. I just have to reclaim them.
---
At least you’re supporting Obsidian, look at the bright side!
---
I found the old Halloween decor when building
---
I played for about a week.
---
Nah, they’ll keep it. Then they’ll put on sale in a month and have even more outrage.
---
Nah no reason to encourage you to keep playing
---
It's disappointingly easy. The ghost people are super weak at that level. The only real issues I can see is missing skill checks near the end
---
Yep not a single extra penny spent on the game. Got the battle pass, played all the new content, bought tons of useful items and cosmetics.
---
Well, most of us that can actually get in.   
---
That's not me, but I'm damn glad it exists.
---
Not going to lie......the scrap stash is amazing.
---
I have been playing since beta and will continue almost every day and yes I am spending my money as soon as I get off work today . And hopefully all these people that can stand this game now drop all your gear and legendary items in suitcases for the rest of us. I am tired of hearing about the 60 dollars if it means that much to you get a better job it has been a year.
---
Promise?
---
They proved it long before this.
---
Glad you can finally see the light. Took a lot of a people a while.
---
What's it like spending your parent's money?  😂  Being fourteen must really be nice huh lol
---
At least it's cheaper than Europe! It's over 30usd more here! A H thieves!
---
Bethesda, Bethesda. You had one more chance. **One Chance** to **fix the game**. Then you **delay it**, but that isn't enough, is it? So you add **subscriptions and paywalls** for a game with **no content**. Absolutely fucking **zero content**.
---
I do have a backup. I tried volumetric light and shadow filters, would removing all of them from the config help?
---
Well, I’m having a hell of a time despite all the hate.
---
There isn’t. No season pass, no paid dlcs. There’s and optional paid subscription to have Bethesda host a private server for you and friends. Let’s you freely have any workshop you want, safely collect nuke zone mats from enemies without having others kill everything before you can get to them. It’s so minorly beneficial that all the freak out about it is just hilarious
---
Oof
---
&gt; Instance lag is gone;  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Terminals loaded instantly  
---
&gt;Enemies died instantly
---
But why do we have to pay 13 dollars monthly to be able to experience this? Wasn't it suppossed to be like that from the start? There are tons of multiplayer games where everything is instant and you don't have to pay a single cent, while Bethesda wants us to pay for the luxury of not having the lag ? Imo that's a bit pathetic....
---
Y’all, I’m pretty bummed about this. I’ve been hoping for a stash limit increase. I remember the posts about a second small fast travel tent, and the enthusiastic responses on here from Bethesda accounts. I believed you when you said that atoms were just cosmetic. I was disappointed when you released a fridge and scrap bot that were obviously not cosmetic. But I still bought them. 
---
This though, it’s obvious p2w, and I think I’m just done. I really liked this game, but I’m out.  I’ve loved playing fallout, but I’m not here to be taken advantage of and lied to. I’m not mad, but I am disappointed
---
No, this is more akin to ordering a pizza with everything on it. Then getting just a plain pizza.
---
The guy next to you orders the same, but because he paid the extra 'optional' fee, gets 2 pizzas with everything on it, and just thrown in for good measure, a lootbox that when opened, reveals he also got some onion rings.
---
There is nothing convenient for you. Its all for their pockets.
---
Yeah apparently I won as well dude!
---
&gt;If you avidly buy atoms monthly, then this isn’t a bad idea
---
And if you don't, then, you feel a bit fucked. For a great deal of people, paying constantly to get the best out of a game is not fun. And when a game stops being fun, well... 
---
I enjoy earning and spending atoms.
---
What does that have to do with being poor? Lol
---
What do you mean by sessions? I wasn't seeing anything about it. Not accusatory, just trying to make sure i didn't miss anything.
---
Is this legit possible? Idk shit about it but I’d be down to help.
---
Do we have to be dressed head-to-toe in a costume, or be wearing any one item from this list in order to qualify?

Seriously Bethesda? I'm sorry I've enjoyed this game a whole lot from the start and been one of the few long time Bethesda fans that actually welcomed Fallout76. This is a slap on the face to me. Bethesda you deserve every bit of backlash for this. You have taken complete idiocy and turned it into an artform.
---
Yeah, it’s Reddit’s fault for all the fucked up choices Bethesda’s made with this game. 
---
You need a reality check.
---
Sort of. A few months ago. And i actually bought it twice, a copy for my gf too. What a waste.
---
Me too on PS4. Luckily I hadn't moved too much over yet.  Still, very disappointing.
---
How does any of this stuff even get accepted that this is perfectly ok at Bethesda. I would really love to see what actually happens behind closed doors for the devs. Because this new pay to win sub is an actual joke.   
---
I stuck with Bethesda and 76 since release I defended the shit out of this game. I really enjoyed it with my mates as well. Now this? I'm done. Sort your company out Bethesda. No one wants this.
---
The public servers are better now that y'all left lol
---
Hahahahaha agreed and we’ve both been downvoted hahaha
---
When Bethesda releases a $100 Davy Crocket nuke launcher with realistic blast zone, then it'll be pay to win.
---
yeah, it's only $12 . They wanna be dramatic so let the kids act out. Remember- when your 15 $12 is a big deal.
---
Pay to win means your gonna be able to beat any player if you have a sub... Not the case it's legit eso plus with private servers?
---
Its already causing problems, people junk stashes are deleting due to an error with too many items, yet people are complaining about not infinite normal stash space
---
It'll have the same problem, but WAY worse
---
No. The scrap boxes are also on public servers.
---
Publishers plan for continued development. That's why the cash shop exists. Changing the business model of the game post-release is dishonest and against the ethics promised by the developers.
---
Regardless, I'm all for subscriptions, but you are normally offered content and support in exchange for your 10+ whatever-currency - not  functional luxury privileges.
---
Yes. It’s the only part I respond to because the rest is just your opinion which is rightly yours.
---
Just passing along the info. Don’t have to be bitter......
---
Yeah but I really dont like the microsoft store either. Gog, steam, or bust.
---
No no no. Perks are just pay for convenience. It just makes we waste less time leveling up, right? No advantage at all, pay to lose even.
---
Weapons? Huh, you must be crazy. Definitely not pay to win. It just takes 200 or so server hops, that can be easily done. It is just a minor convenience to pay and get my weapon.
---
CAMP budget? Literally play to lose! It's such a small gameplay feature, might as well not even exist? Totally should be behind a paywall.
---
Foreign exchange fees
---
Infinite storage and an extra deployable fast travel points in public servers? You high?
---
Yes such a bargain.  Broken full priced game sold subscription that gets you broken half baked private servers with some pay to win thrown in for twice the price as a service with 100s of games.  Such a deal.  Your embarrassing yourself.  Your like the husband that brags tk his work buddies that another man fucks your wife and you get to suck his dick jist foe the privilege of it
---
They've been around since the late 1800's!  Yet they've somehow managed to about falling into the issues Bethesda has
---
Oh hell yeah. A new game by the Folks who actually KNOW how to make a good Fallout game.   :)

Whats wrong with spending money on what u enjoy? If you are the 1% who enjoy fallout 76. Good for you. Everyone has a thing to spend money on. Some spend it on ..... every month. I spend my money on airsoft stuff.
---
I have a level 210 and a level 105. 
---
I'm not paying for shit. Because it's stupid for the reasons I already pointed out. 
---
Its blind because you are refusing to acknowledge the fact that continuing to support this shit just makes it worse for everyone else. Like the playerbase is even going to need jank ass private servers, since most players will likely leave.
---
The servers are simply void of players. You can’t actually maintenance your own servers. In the future? Maybe. Think gta and Minecraft servers. Possibilities are endless. This? Just a blank map.
---
They are literally building the game around the requests of the community because they had no idea what to do with 76 and now dare to sell the community's very own ideas back to us....
---
Yeah we shouldn't have helped them as everything that was requested has been turned into a 'pay-first' thing which is \*ok\* in some F2P games...but I paid upfront when buying 76 so....
---
Oh it absolutely is pathetic. I was curious about all of this and decided to sacrifice $12 to test it out and answer any questions for anyone who was also curious but didnt want to waste money

It's not *technically* your server, it's just a slightly more restricted version of the same ad-hoc random server associated they use for public play.  They're sort of selling you nothing, basically just letting you connect to a server that has a lower player limit.

Server hosting **absolutely** should not be done by bethesda, but rather by third-party services, as seen in games like minecraft.
---
The reason your $13 will bypass technical issues is because that fee can pay for more resources. If they wanted they could have each server run on 64 CPUs and your stash could be stored in its own S3 bucket. But they not going to pay for that.
---
I am not the legal age, but high risk high reward, eh?
---
Its about the gameplay effecting shit that this paid subscription adds,  OP. 
---
People who paided $60 at launch don't get access to the scrapbox or tent. Its a paid advantage and its bullshit.
---
Doesn't hurt my feelings. Its not about the price, which is also kinda bull as well, its about the principle. You've been lied to and you're just taking it with a smile.
---
eh.. I see it more as a put your money where your mouth is. They'll Debbie time to make this the fallout 5 instead of an upgrade to 4 but you gotta pay for it. or get mad and storm off Reddit. They'll all come back when wastelanders drops.
---
Oops to late
---
if not, good riddance
---
I got better! In Europe in 133.64 USD!!! Fuckin done with these thieves!
---
I saw a 2* and a 1* spawn at the queen fight. It blew my mind. NEVER have I ever seen this before. I also saw plenty of legendaries, all trash 1/2 star drops though.
---
Well good for you then lol
---
Not sure if you’ve read the latest patch notes yet, but they just implemented a payed subscription.
---
I always considered Anthem the bigger dumpster fire until this piece of news. Anthem had nothing enjoyable about it besides the flying for me. The enemies were super spongy, health was bugged so you had barely any survivability, the rolls on weapons are abysmal and a useless crafting system to top it off. Include having only 3 dungeons at launch for endgame stuff (I think 4 now but I don't keep up with Anthem updates) with one of them just being a rerun of the final story mission makes for a sorry game.
---
At least Fallout 76, when I played it at launch, was an enjoyable run through.
---
It's Todd Howard's blessing.
---
Oh and the emotes are fucking fun just gonna say it.
---
I'm off as well. I'm taking a trip to The Outer Worlds. If I need a Fallout fix I'll load up 4 or New Vegas. I'm heartbroken at the soulless shell Bethesda has become.
---
Why did people downvote this? Y'all really buying into this membership???
---
Does this guy know that rockstar offers private servers for free for gta 5 and red dead online?
---
For Bethesda this thing is might not be as small feature as it should be, but still, that's like 2 weeks work, and the private server feature was on the list of things to do anyway. This caused no delay. The wastelanders were postponed because they got months of work for it still.
---
And I'll follow you and flash the money emote in your face until you server hop
---
Consider a private server on conan, if you build a box, that box is still there when you go back to the game. 
---
Claim and build at a workshop and come back in an hour, suddenly it's all gone. Almost as if you're still playing in the normal sessions but now only some friends can join.
---
That’s a dangerous game you’re playing, OP. I respect it.
---
This game sounds like a full-time fucking job. I've no idea what you're even talking about. How do you people do it?
---
Post pics? This is not good at all. File a complaint!!
---
Sry I did pay for it thinking it would be an easier way to play lag free with my friends and be unmolested at workshops but its worse than adventure and totally not worth it. I'm definitely done giving them money
---
Any other subscription service for servers in other games is cheaper. Nuff said. You CANNOT defend this shit.
---
You have to read the text.
---
This is a very reasonable post.  Kudos.
---
Yeah they planned. That's why they're rolling this out.
---
even the fucking private server part doesnt fucking work like a private server SHOULD work
---
and THAT my friends is the biggest FUCK up of all.
---
i.e. its more of a private "instance" but the respawns.loot system acts just like live servers. i.e. other people are actually playing on your server you just cant see them
---
THAT SHOULD BE FUCKING CRIMINAL! its fucking FALSE advertising you are paying them NOTHING for any extra server space  they just fucking turn "off" the other players to your view.
---
a sticky should be made
---
PRIVATE SERVERS ARE NOT ACTUALLY PRIVATE!!!!!!!!!
---
ironically that rages me the most
---
cuz for private server wanna bes i could maybe MAYBE justify the price for that.
---
but now since its not even an actual private server
---
FUCK it all. FUCK IT all to hell.
---
Todd Howard should be directly called out for that bullshit.
---
we cant get  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to bring Todd before congress and call him out like a schoolkid getting caught doing wrong about how his private servers arnt actually private can we?
---
cuz damn thatd be sweet.
---
:-p
---
It's only infinite for junk items which are literally everywhere i have hundreds of the rarer junk items and fast travel does nothing. I have yet to have no caps for fast travel since the first 5 hours of even starting.
---
If it weren't for the fact that I was having this issue prior, and all other games and services didn't work correctly, I wouldn't be as concerned. At minor, an acknowledgement from Bethesda's support that it was on their end would be nice. The whole blame was shifted from my ISP, to me, to Sony.
---
Where do you hang out? Where do you farm? I usually see that many people each time I login
---
Lmao
---
you only have yourself to blame omegalul
---
Isn't the scrap box for scrap only?
---
The days of mass boycotting and big publishers going under are yet to come.
---
Do you even know what you’re talking about? What the fuck was all that drivel at the end there?
---
I did read the text. I’m just trying to see if the witch shown in the image is included. Thanks
---
Or two beers
---
You've lost the argument, there's already plenty of loonies on here who've openly expressed willingness to pay for the subscription. Abandon ship, this voyage was doomed from the beginning.
---
Please read thread. This isn’t about spending money. It’s about a 60 dollar games being 50% off two weeks later. I’m not actually mad, it was just lame. Good lord.
---
I just don't think there's enough incentive to warrant the price.
---
I filed a ticket over ultracite I had that legitimately got deleted by a game crash and still no response after months
---
what are the chances chubbypanchyderm has never had a job?
---
Enjoy your free 3 hour game.
---
I would actually play this game if it was available offline..  Imagine having to pay monthly so you can play solo via private servers...   All the apologists for bethesda coming out to remind you how this is actually very reasonable so the company can recoup the 'very high costs' that it takes to run their servers..   fucking LOL.    games these days, what a sad state.
---
Who me or original commenter?
---
You're an idiot.
---
I don't think so. I know 7 people who got it on another gaming forum. Plus me. Not to mention on twitter you can find people who say they bought it. Even if only 10,000 buy in that is a massive pay day for Bethesda every month or year
---
You.
---
Ahhh here’s a hater now😂😂😂😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
When i said all i meant all but cosmetic like they originally promised
---
every scorched I saw was legendary, got any pics? if not I'll gladly come to your server to launch the nuke and you can tell me then take the picture and post it.
---
though to be fair that has been said multiple times by multiple people by now and at launch :p
---
It was obvious from the very beginning that their database isn't actually impacted by the amount of scrap but they needed an excuse for their future plans which I 'predict' were also planned since release
---
Meanwhile, Wastelanders got delayed but the subscription model came out. Almost as if they don't plan on actually implementing that content update for free. I really won't be surprised when 80% of the content gets locked behind needing to be a whale...
---
Junk is literally a big part of this game. Being able to PAY to have unlimited space for all of your junk compared to a non-premium player is pay to win. "In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-**paying** peers." This is the definition of pay to win, describes the scrapbox and tent pretty well.
---
I paid for this so-called "Private Server"... I agree these are definitely simply private sessions... paying for something like this is absolutely abnormal. Imagine if Rockstar required a $10/mo fee in order to start a private lobby in GTA Online... because that's exactly what's going on here.
---
I was 100% down for a private server... this is not what I got
---
If I had the money. I would get it once. Just to see how the stuff works. But not a years worth.
---
This isn’t politics. If you enjoy spending the money and getting the perks, do it. If you don’t then don’t. And wastelanders? Apparently it will be game changing; I’d rather them prime it (unlike the original release). Or do you not want them to make it right?
---
DLC is still free.... so what are you talking about ?? Lol😂😂😂
---
Sorry I should have elebaroted. Purchased it for a month to get the Ranger gear then instantly requested a refund from Microsoft, got the refund, but I still have access to the private worlds and all that for now.
---
Edit: Should also say I still have access to the atoms it gives too despite having paid nothing. Not suggesting anything, but if Bethesda's robbing us, eye for an eye right?
---
The reason why they're being so aggressive with the microtransactions and subscriptions. It's the last gasp before death.
---
I own Brotherhood of Steel.  
---
So yeah, I'll put up with a lot of shit for a Fallout game.  
---
But this one is still awful.
---
Lol oof
---
Yes and a lot of other stuff that’s useless man come on you can’t honestly be seriously telling me this is what you want the future of Bethesda to be? We went from Skyrim and fallout 3 to this it’s pretty much rock bottom
---
id rather have grafton mayor instead of this 1st bs
---
Yeah... Uhm esos crafting materials are the same way? . No one's ever said that "craft bag is ptw"
---
NO...  "I" won.  If your gonna try and play me on this... you should know I have a refrigerator too.
---
Yes, but it's about the principle. They promised us that there would be no pay to win garbage. They promised that 76 wouldn't fall prey to the classic pitfall of all MMORPG games. Whoopsie
---
It's still up and running. It depends on another mod, SFE, which has to be updated with each new game version (similar to F4SE, on which it's based). It's usually updated within a day or so of a game update. At the moment it hasn't been updated yet so there's no chat until it is.
---
When it is working, you hit the chat key (default is Insert, not \~ like the mod page says) and it'll pop up right away.
---
Yes, your quotations "Broke ass bitch" and "Quit your crying" have been recognized worldwide as some of the most intellectual words spoken in this century, possibly only second to Kanye West's "They haven't done the education".
---
It's a must play if you liked new vegas, or fallout overall. It's shorter but the content has so much quality. Definitely the true fallout successor imho.
---
there's more nail than coffin at this point... that is one metal-as-fuck coffin :P
---
Thanks for that info and based on that not sure if I want to continue to pay for it is there a reset for items then
---
hell I can launch all three one after the other we can try my server. if your down to put your money where your mouth is. care to wager with a courier holding the goods? lemme know
---
This isn't ESO.
---
That is the only reason I would consider doing one is if I could build up things and have a persistent world. Or if my friends camps would stay there even when they weren't playing so we could build a real community somewhere. But there is no reason to get a private server if there is nothing persistent about it.
---
DMing now......hold on police are knocking on my door. Probably just need directions.
---
No he hasn't.
---
True, not surprising at all....
---
But there is difference between horrible/exploitative of fans and just outright malicious greed/cruelty for the hell of it.
---
They wouldnt make it right anyways, Im not gonna lie I loved this game when it came out and there was no pay to win but no they just had to f it all up and make it pay to win
---
I’ll take #3 for $500, Alex!
---
A) You are not a whale...   
---
B) You get $15 worth of atoms for doing 1st  
---
 C) this proves you are just on a bandwagon trying to feel special.   
---
BTW a whale is someone that purchases everything from a shop no matter what and no matter cost. I have witnessed people dropping $4500 in a day for a special gold skin that...that is a whale.
---
And a lawyer can easily spin that unfortunately, as Pete’s getting it for free.  That he was referring to himself.
---
Todd will make a stupid joke next e3 and show 0 remorse
---
Man's scum plain and simple
---
I bought it for two accounts. 
---
I went into public servers looking for all the supposed people that were going to troll us subscribers hoping maybe I'd finally get some good PvP action. All I found were servers full of fellow vaulters wearing ranger armor and sporting the new 1st icon.
---
Seems like a common theme is breaking down bulks then putting them in..did your gf do that?
---
Nice try Todd
---
I think they just need to reward those of us that bought it with 3 months of 1st and just convert the game to FTP.
---
ITS THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION. both have the same effect on the game. . Nothing about that is pay to win
---
You're just triggered 🤣
---
you supported this? dafuq
---
No love for outer Worlds?
---
I havent played 76 for months now so Im not their target demographic. But Im the target demographic for airsoft lol
---
And there's the canned Bethesda Employee answer
---
Neither are you.
---
Didn’t say you didn’t own a copy...but since you brought it up , looking through your Reddit history, are you some sort of crisis actor? you don’t even appear to play this game to the extent of most people play it, yet your outrage meter is off the charts. based on your Reddit history you bounce from sub Reddit to sub Reddit looking to be outraged by games that don’t fit your ideology.... if it’s that offensive... stick to wow kid.
---
And here Bethesda gives us a paycheck of 13 bucks a month to get stuff they promised, but sure I am spouting nonsense lol
---
This, I agree with this.
---
"They"?
---
You mean the one PR/Headfigure guy who didn't work directly on this project who tweeted the "promise" on his private twitter account instead of the company twitter. Yeah, I gotta say I never much payed attention to that promise.
---
Are they cosmetic though? I was under the impression they did add genuine protection to the horse and weren't there just to look good.
---
There's already people talking about getting the subscription, poor souls:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm1u7p/im\_going\_to\_p2w\_and\_theres\_nothing\_you\_can\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm1u7p/im_going_to_p2w_and_theres_nothing_you_can_do/)
---
I hate thinking about this.
---
So having an unlimited junk supply isn't an advantage?
---
I paid for two copies in beta and I'm ok with this m Sorry your parents won't let you use the credit card anymore this month.
---
I fixed it by removing all unnecessary tweaks, and I'll use that as a backup and slowly tweak things one by one. Thanks for all your help!
---
The depths of Hell.
---
Which coincidentally is where they're located.
---
(China)
---
Such words of wisdom.
---
yeah it's called fraud
---
Yeah.. I'm blaming it on the release because I've been playing for the last 2.5hrs without a disconnect. But the first time it happened was moments after I finished bringing a power plant online, and then again after I had captured and fixed up the munitions plant to start making ammo. 
---
Throw in the fact that I lost absolutely everything I put into the scrapbox, and this has been an incredibly disappointing release
---
I get what you're saying but I'm hesitant. They said the exact same thing about Tyranny. It had great systems but all of the buildup to the ending kinda just goes flat, and that main ending doesn't change no matter how you play.
---
The game was also designed to be short for the sake of replayability but it didn't really work out.
---
I’m just trying to stay positive about it, really. I’m dreaming of modded servers that will quite literally be perfect. True survival. True pvp. True pvm. Everything could be possible. I even think of the role playing (ie GTA) with bounty hunters and all. It’s a dream lol
---
Right lol😂
---
Once again you need golding Mats and to get that you need a million other mats to break down in eso it's just as important in that game as fallout and it's not pay to win.
---
They probably came back just to laugh at the sub imploding
---
Oh that been there always, although I think a lot of players don't know about.
---
That event, once you kill the supervisor bots, allows you to run to THAT terminal, and open the box. But most people run to the other terminal and just reset the targetting parameters, completing the event. After which the other terminal can't be used to open the fertilizer box.
---
I don't remember trying but the terminal might unlock all of the fertilizer boxes. The others can be picklocked while that one in basement cant.
---
and the graphics make my head hurt. oh, it's also aimed at teens and kids so there you go.
---
I'm just saying that it happened jeeze I dont care I have plenty but its never happened till today has it happened to you
---
Not even that, but non dedicated servers are free on Conan
---
You could store all of the infinite stash for every player in a tiny file.
---
That's virtually no server space. You could store all of this on a USB memory stick and serve it out with a RPi.
---
This doesn't even need fancy compression.
---
You could probably hide all of this data for the entire player base in a high resolution jpeg.
---
Moreover, there are reports coming in that they aren't private servers at all. You're paying for an abandoned instance that someone else may have already looted and left.
---
Do you sit around in your shill workshop talking about what garbage you are going to post on Reddit to try to control the narrative?
---
same thing happened to me
---
I'm sure the decision came from the highest level, like the board of directors...
---
Though I wouldn't call myself an die-hard fan but I stayed mostly for the (usually) nice community here and to follow the 'progress' of the game.....and because I paid money at the start of this free-to-play game so I want something for that
---
&gt;This isn't ESO. 
---
And you didn't answer my question, is having an unlimited junk supply not an advantage?
---
A little more meat?!  A huge online game (I'd call it an MMO, you may not) offering PRIVATE SERVERS?  Shut up.
---
Ok cool, that must be what's up.  I installed the SFE but I guess because it's not updated yet, that's the problem I'm running into.  Thank you for responding!
---
If I pay a subscription, the items in the atom shop should be free and unlocked as long as my subscription is active. 
---
Anything else and no thanks.
---
You know...except for the other bazillion MTXs this game is caked with
---
Its only $100 and i get what is promised no random lootbox crap or chance rate. And i like role playing the lone survivor
---
The slogan; "We released this half wet fart, assuming it was a fresh baked turd."
---
ESO Plus unlocks all of the game packs available, which is to say:
---
Wrathstone,
---
Summerset,
---
Murkmire,
---
Wolfhunter,
---
Dragon Bones,
---
Clockwork City,
---
Horns of the Reach,
---
Morrowind (zone DLC),
---
Shadows of the Hist,
---
Dark Brotherhood,
---
Thieves Guild,
---
Orsinium,
---
and the Imperial City.
---
It does not unlock the Warden and Necromancer, nor access to Elsweyr.
---
It comes with similar benefits to ESO+, in the currency for the in-game shop, the unlimited storage for scrap (which wasn't the issue), a cosmetic outfit... and that's it, besides private servers which I won't get into.
---
Imo... Fallout 1st and ESO+ should have been bundled together, as in you get a "Bethesda" (Zenimax is probably a more appropriate name, but y'know) sub, and get the premium subs for their games as a service/MMO games.
---
TIL Having standards makes you toxic.
---
I'd like a car and a roof over my head without having to pay extra for it.  Suck it up, kid.
---
fortnite would be better than this broken piece of trash.
---
Are you kidding?  
---
You don't need an uncapped stash of scrap to craft ammo on demand, lead is already one of the lightest scraps in the game and can be farmed in bulk and stored in a regular stash, steel is a quick trip to West Tek to farm the super mutants, acid can be gotten in quantities of 15+ every five seconds server hopping and cloth is all over the place.
---
You don't need a private server to either claim or hold a power plant or the food factory and you should NEVER be using weapon or armor weight reduction perks in the first place as they're the weakest of any option available... hell even weight reduction legendary effects (except weapon weight depending on your loadout) are super weak and the worst options and should always be replaced by better gear.
---
And all of the tent stuff?  Is carrying around the bare minimum food and water a herculean task now?  Have I missed all of the complaints about the time consuming and bank breaking effort required to take a free fast travel back to camp, reapply well rested/tuned and then paying 30 caps to return where you were?  And even then... there's a reason they're advertising the tent primarily as an additional fast travel point... because everything you've listed is easy as shit to do otherwise and the best use this thing will ever get is getting tossed in some corner of the map far away from 76 and your original camp to occasionally save you 30 caps for a fast travel.
---
This isn't pay2win... these are minor conveniences that can otherwise be accomplished with a bare minimum amount of effort.
---
No. Again I made the comparison you don't wanna listen. Craft bag is just as much of a advantage as unlimited junk.
---
Yeah, nope.
---
It's happened to me too, and I've seen several other posters say the same thing... jfc
---
don't ratonialize it. they can't handle that. You have a point but you know... let kids be kids
---
you might want to look up what a fact is
---
Sure.
---
Fuckk Bro you’re the big winner!
---
They are the same company, heck the benefits are near identical with the scrap box being a mirror image of the crafting bag (which will probably act the same way). I do hope they flesh out the design and make it more like eso plus in the future.
---
Your ideology is their target. This "whats the problem" attitude is screaming at them that its okay to monetize low effort content and blow smoke up your bum when you protest. Your airsoft love isn't what im focusing on you can buy things you like but you dont buy an airsoft rifle online for premium price only to recieve a subpar spring gun.
---
&gt;That event, once you kill the supervisor bots, allows you to run to THAT terminal, and open the box.
---
Well TIFL..
---
Weird how it says Steal From, though
---
Huh, so I don't own Elite Dangerous. Might as well sell my Corvette (Literally a rep grinded piece of shit final tier ship)
---
Huh, I guess I don't own Stellaris, despite having close to 700 hours in it.
---
Guess I'm just outrage culture. Yeah you found me out. Totally.
---
ESO plus offers a lot more , I think fall out 1st asking price is way to high for what you get .
---
No, you pay a foreign transaction fee on top of it as well, which is usually anywhere from 3-5% easily. Then that couple with tax.
---
Like every other game, by making it WORTH buying
---
I meant more in the sense that they didn't need to tack on shit like Atoms and whatnot, and just let people host their own servers. Just a big sandbox.
---
I suppose Minecraft's model would've been a better comparison.
---
Because I fucking paid for it and I'll do whatever I want?
---
Free stuff? Who could forget the canvas bag issues, the infamous DdoS BGS did to their users on their website, leaking their addresses, names and personal info. And that was only off of the on release content
---
Riot Gear don't look "re-used"
---
I stopped playing before Vault raid came out and now I am uninstalling. Clearly the direction this game is headed is similar to what Call of Duty does. Nothing but monetary mechanics and ZERO content. There is more content in F4 modding community than what Bethesda has done officially. I can’t wait for Outer Worlds, I’ll finally be able to see what a real game dev team can do
---
Exactly it’s like why bother complaining about something that more than likely won’t effect your experience while playing the game, if you wanna play on a server go ahead, but people are always complaining about the state of the game and then thinking that private servers should be free?If Bethesda gives everyone ps for free the game would just be fucked
---
that’s the plan for me. Shitthesda (that’s their new official name) is funny thinking that i’m going to rather spend money for bumfuck west virginia when i can go buy outer worlds instead for the same price.
---
There will always be those types, too stubborn to accept defeat or actually willing to spend the money, and quite happily.
---
Case in point:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm1u7p/im\_going\_to\_p2w\_and\_theres\_nothing\_you\_can\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm1u7p/im_going_to_p2w_and_theres_nothing_you_can_do/)
---
Does it come back when you switch back to private, perhaps the two are independant of each other to stop people from farming in private and bringing it over to public.
---
im hyped for todd howards next semi self depricating e3 joke
---
Survival mode without greifing or idiots, under your own rules.  Actually gives me a reason to turn off pacifist mode.
---
You don't want to argue your "point" anymore because it's a silly point and you just don't want to admit this is pay to win lmao. It's fine to be in denial, but when they start adding weapons,armor and buffs to the atomic shop I'm gonna laugh at all of you.
---
I just saw another post on Reddit. It happened to him, and you where they swapped from a private world to an adventure world and lost all their scrap.
---
Yes. Pretty cool. Quite a few good changes today.. But ya know.. People just want free shit.
---
The Outer Worlds, Witcher, Dark Souls Games, Indie games (normally way cheaper) and so on. Pick better developers. Bethedsa is EA's child. Peace
---
You sure do. 1500-ish atoms, too
---
Well, somebody already (sarcastically) made the comment about having to pay for the monthly electric bill for your CAMP, so I’m sure that will be in one of the next updates.
---
This was added today, enjoy!
---
Tfw David Icke got more credibility than Pete Hines.
---
Don't worry bruh, I'm going to throw money at them to make up for your peasantry.
---
Yeah they lost my confidence forever. Literally can’t make a proper game. Like every game they put out has more bugs than, all non-Bethesda games ever made combined. Lol used to be charming, now it’s just lame as hell
---
&gt;This private server is gonna let me reign over any Workshop I want, farming up items to sell cheaply to players that could use it. It’ll help me grind up to be able to solo a Scorchbeast Queen. I’ll be able to do rounds of whitesprings for all the flux I can need without worrying of coming across bodies someone beat me too. 
---
You'll be able to do all of that on public servers soon enough.
---
Are you referring to the other worlds 😋
---
Yup! New today!
---
Agreed. I’ve been busy all day and admittedly haven’t gone through all of the notes. If it were just server rental that’s OK in my eyes, but locking other shit behind it is asinine. They won’t be getting my money, that’s for sure.
---
If you were to give everyone free private servers it would not be good for the state of the servers themselves as they already aren’t handled well
---
Lol i played that alpha. Good times
---
So Bethesda has their first big hiccup as a game studio and now they are at rock bottom. 
---
Man I can’t wait to see CDPR fuck up for the first time and how quickly the community turns on them.
---
yes it is stuff like that was in the patch notes while theres many more stuff thats not in the patch notes that should be.
---
I'm playing gears 5 now, and it's pretty meh. Don't care about the rest, but there ARE some good games on there, just not those.
---
Yes dude! i've been saying this since the beginning of these "convenience" items 
---
there just treading the waters and seeing what they can get away with
---
Agreed. What I was meaning is that DI often uses a variation on that phrase. More specifically "problem, reaction, solution"
---
If you do it for infinite years yup
---
Say what now?  Are you for real?
---
Honestly, people are really just mad there adding a optional paid thing before regular content. But no ones ready to talk about that so they just complain about the price tags they see
---
$23 a month, homie. Minimum. For Xbox live and whatever private server shit is called. This game is like an abusive stepdad who said he was gonna stop beating your Mom, so you had one nice homemade dinner, but then tomorrow he's beating up Mom again.
---
From what I've read, anyone in your friends list can enter your private server. Any concerns with that?
---
that doesn’t change anything, F76 is charging for a subscription
---
All opinions should be welcome here. If you are enjoying this, then nobody should be telling you that you are wrong.
---
I personally think this is a dumpster fire, but you do you and I'll do me and maybe we can fix a power plant sometime.
---
For most people $100 is considerably more than 2 hours worth of work. Regardless $100 might be more acceptable if their "private servers" were actually dedicated servers. What Bethesda calls private servers are actually private lobbies which are not the same thing.
---
Better late than never.
---
Minecraft, GMOD, and Battlefield all let you also host private servers for free and with more features such as not limiting the player count to 8.
---
Just unlimited junk. Essentially the can stockpile stuff to make ammo and weapon repairs/mods. It is insanely convenient but I don’t believe it gives a competitive edge. The only edge I could see would be they don’t need ammo weight reduction like I do (I carry about 100k on me at all times and they could just carry 10k and craft each use). That’s really about it. They can’t store unlimited weapons and armor.
---
About the same time frame actually. I logged off 3 or 4 times total in like a 5 or 6 hour period. Idk if it's a situational trigger or a console specific issue but it's all gone except for what I had on me
---
But even if the game keeps selling, they will eventually run out of people to sell too. The only way to have guaranteed income is through subscriptions
---
Nope, switched back to the private server and it was still gone.
---
Private servers are not servers.  They're sessions, they are not persistent.
---
How about permanent premium for the people who paid $200 for the Power Armor edition......
---
I really just wanted the stash limits gone but now it's ONLY on junk?    
---
and they lock it behind a paywall?  
---
This isn't even cosmetic shit, this is literally functional gameplay for a game they charged full price for.
---
Maybe you shouldn't pre-order digital things anymore.
---
absolutely nothing will happen. They’re going to do what they always do and act like nothing happened and never respond to any feedback. 
---
I wonder how that lawsuit is coming along for california refunds. For the first time i’m genuinely glad i live here
---
Repair kits were just testing, then they kept going farther over the line. Now we can basically buy infinite stash spash for our junk. I don't understand how people are defending this saying it's not pay to win lmao. I didn't think people with such low IQs existed.
---
Oh I get that eso has more to it to warrant a sub I stated that. I also think it's ridiculous to add a sub to this game with no content.  But the sub itself is no different. Yet because this is fallout they call it ptw I'm pointing out a non bias side on this. I wish fallout was better I agree 1000 percent.
---
And to voice your opinion really strong, you could unsubscribe from all Bethesda related Reddit forums 😉
---
You're a genius!
---
I’ve yet to see one person to even talk about the Halloween event I saw the subscription thing and I was like oh cool whatever it won’t effect me in anyway and then everyone else is just blowing shit out of the water
---
What part of the servers are dedicated, isn't it mostly peer-to-peer like GTA Online which has private severs that cost 0 dollars.
---
The only thing they host is your part of your player data which can be put anywhere and doesn't rely on servers.
---
Yep, now you just have to keep paying $12 a month for the rest of your life to maintain that feeling within this game.
---
K👍🏻
---
Sweet! Don't listen to the haters.  My gf LOVES this game but HATES the online feature.  She wants an offline fo76 and this is a way for her to do that.  Sure the price tag is lame but I make enough to spend extra for her enjoyment
---
No because I don't need to argue my stance I already proved my point. Making the same statement to someone who can't retain information is a waste of time. Have a good night.
---
I know I could, but there’s also other people in the server with me so I don’t want to lock them out of every workshop. In a private server it won’t matter cause it’s just me. I can go in, defend up, play on idle for a bit while things grind up and do something like study
---
All the people asking for stuff: no, it'll die along with this fucking mess bethesda calls a game.
---
3 second join, 3-2 second fast travel, no lag between clicks of dropping and moving things in inventory. 
---
Seems pretty solid, only tested it with me and 1 other person so far though.
---
Absolutely LOVNG IT. All the shops are belong to USSSS
---
I can level mules without worrying they'll get ganked by exploiters and the stuff I'm storing will be gone.
---
All the events, no salt there. Plus it's a bigger challenge with smaller numbers. 
---
Not to mention the scrap box!!! I have a mobile camp I plop after a queen, the new little tent has my stashbox and scrapbox so I don't have to. Scrapbox will scrap and store any junk item that isn't bulked in 2 clicks. So long as it's down to it's most basic form (ie. though hardened mass is a crafting component, it's able to break down further into ultracite) you'll have infinite storage for all junk items.
---
Only way I see this ending is with government legislation or companies going bankrupt.
---
The main thing that annoys me is that the stuff included in the subscription would have been free content in any other game as a "thank you" to the community for playing and supporting our game. But no instead that are charging a ludicrous amount for it, I can garrentee that the content was probably going to be added to wastelanders for everyone as well But instead they decided to split it and monetize it.
---
You know what woulda been a fantastic update? If wastelanders came out. Instead it's delayed but Bethesda EAGERLY FUCKING TAKES MORE MONEY.
---
There shouldn't be ANY FUCKING POSITIVITY for this very obvious fucking cash grab. "Oh but it takes money to make content!" and if you charge $60 for a game it should be worth the $60. 
---
And hey, didn't they recently get RID of content in the form of survival mode? If anyone defends this fucking shit, that Bethesda hand is so far up your ass you have to be a puppet.
---
Because [only cosmetic](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?lang=en) lol.
---
For that, you have to pay for the "Even Premier" subscription of $150 per year.
---
I'm not responding to most of the panic or defend threads, but this one is funny and snarky and not taking a side so you get a +1 from me!
---
Thats just a technical mistake. It has something marked as owner, so as the player char is not the owner, it calls it stealing. There's no actual stealing in the game, not currently at least. 
---
You can only get wanted via picking some other players lock, in their camp or workshop. Some locks might subtly warn that picking them would be stealing, while apparently some locks don't even have that, and you should always check if workshop is owned before you try to pick a lock in workshop.
---
But items don't have ownership, they can never be stolen. Wastelanders might change that but it will take months.
---
Even if that’s how it works, you’re still rewarding bad behavior.
---
*shrugs
---
Defend it as much as you want but trying to compare it to ESO plus is at best reaching for straws and at worst just abject denial due to sunken cost fallicy.
---
but hey if you find it fun and want to keep throwing money at BGS, by all means have at it.
---
I wont be, I already gave them 350 AUD for the collectors edition which I regret greatly as nothing they promiosed this game would be has come to fruition.
---
But on the bright side I do have a nice helm.
---
Edit - I cant be bothered with the silly voting system on this site but I have a feeling youll get downvoted to hell in any case.
---
And even better, anyone can use the camp you place. So if your down at a blast zone on a public server, and someone that pays the subscription costs is nice enough to gift you with that, I bet you’d happily use it.
---
Enter it for just $200.
---
In my couple hours of experience I've experienced no lag instability or anything bad what so ever it's been quite a pleasant time.
---
Thing is you can still play the game without paying for private servers... No one is forcing you to pay to play... As for me and my group we love it and don't mind the few bucks to keep the CREEPS from killing us while we play.. so much more enjoyable.. Thank you
---
But this is all after saying that the game wouldn't feature quality of life items for sale for real-world money. I admit they're being more transparent but that unfortunately doesn't change the fact that they were dishonest in the past.
---
The fact there are people who will give them money based on this news despite the company's track record is disappointing. The company continues to pull this like this because some of us let them get away with it.
---
&gt; Making the same statement to someone who can't retain information is a waste of time. 
---
This basically sums up how I felt about my conversation with you, when you can't realize the obvious advantage premium players get. But yeah, good night. Hopefully you realize what Bethesda is doing and grow a brain to help us make this game better. :)
---
i haven’t i thought the least thing bethesda could do is get the patch notes right :(
---
Good night.
---
And you lie too. Why? Why must you do that?
---
Oh well, it’s worth a shot. You miss a lot more opportunities than you might expect
---
If the game works correctly for people who pay extra, then it is all a big scam. And we should leave. Because we all paid for a working game.
---
It's not even private servers.
---
Paying for free to play games is like smoking cigarettes.  What is your long term plan here?
---
Biggest posts about gameplay that everyone playing the game loves 1.5k upvotes, Bethesda bad posts 3k+ upvotes, those are not people interested in fallout at all.
---
I just want offline play, single player, nothing else.
---
No
---
All opinions are welcome. However, the only posts I have seen all day are nothing but shit talk. So having a place to talk about the positive side of things should be perfectly fine as well
---
 Oh Beth, you greedy bitch.
---
I mean, Apex Legends isn’t pay to win. It’s a small step forward, but it’s one I’m willing to take.
---
oh and She can finally take a workshop without triggering all the troll pvper on the server to hunt her down.  Like damn.. she just needs some ammo for her guns. Give her like 15 minutes to farm and you can have it for yourself
---
This. 
---
I gave up and walked away after they started pulling the cosmetics and selling plans or something. I can't even remember what the scheme was at the time but this proves that my assumption was right. It did get worse. 
---
Fuck this game. Done with Bethesda
---
These are the exact people that keep letting them get away with this shit. This is why this entire post was created in the first place, awareness.
---
Because while a lot of the scummy shit like the Atom Store is Zenimax's fault Bethesda still fucked up royally on everything else.
---
Lol imagine comparing eso to Skyrim .
---
&gt;story 
---
BAHAHAHAHAH
---
Next you'll tell me Ziggy is a Stephen King novel.
---
Yes... the game would probably fuck up... why do you think they limited this service to only the minority of people likely to purchase the service in the first place?  It minimizes the strain and resources required by the servers.  If you think that we should have unlimited storage then you don't understand how online games work.
---
A much better Fallout Shelter game is being developed in China. Makes you wonder if Bethesda loves money as much as Blizzard.
---
Insert **"you get what you fucking deserve"** meme here. I couldn't be happier to hear this happened to you.
---
No. 
---
Done.
---
Uninstalling.
---
Let me know when you make an offline game again or keep your original promises.
---
Yeah, as a one time purchase, it has a lot in it. The atoms and the ranger outfit, but as a recurring cost, not really.
---
What the fuck is happening at Bethesda? Honest question. I just really don’t understand how they’re suddenly so out of touch
---
&gt;  work on bettering other stuff
---
Oh yeah... Like the subscription model...
---
Pass.
---
Encourage them. It shows that people want to play the game but are anxious about it.
---
I go to Vegas regularly, the term "whale" is being used here way incorrectly. 
---
When a "Whale" goes to Vegas, they never touch their bags from baggage claim, there is a limo driver waiting for them with their name on an Ipad, they're already checked into their comped suite and their luggage is delivered, their clothes are pressed and stored, and they have a concierge on call for anything they need, which is usually pot and booze runs. Reservations and show tickets are handled through the concierge so the Whale doesn't have to be bothered with the mundane tasks. 
---
This isn't that.
---
Hahahahahhaha
---
This is what's wrong with game culture.
---
They want to *bargain* with these ridiculous business models.
---
Just say no.  Hosting your own server used to be a goddamn free feature that came packaged with every FPS in the early 2000s.
---
you are aware that publishers will withhold funds and potentially publishing/hosting the game if their demands are not met right?   
---
not saying the devs are completely blameless, but the publisher could easily force their hand to put things in that the devs didn't want/plan.  which would explain the change since the original tweet and interviews.
---
Oh boy you're right. I also find it funny. But different people see the fanboys as different people. Fanboys see us as fanboys for wanting fallout to be fallout again. We see them as fanboys for the constant "hyungngnng feed me morreee of your doookie mistar howurd ('/·o·\)"
---
Does it though
---
Meal in McDonald’s or better experience with only game i currently play for a month... hard choices.
---
Well that is truly a bug worthy of the "Fallout" (tm) experience lol
---
This isn’t positivity, most people are sick of people bitching over mild stuff. YES they went back on their word about in game purchases, then stuff with function in the atom shop, and now private servers. But who gives  a fuck. If it really bothers you so much, don’t buy it. It literally won’t negatively effect you in the slightest. As for wastelanders being delayed, you should be glad they’re taking their time to release something instead of pushing it out too early because the goblins are hungry.
---
And it'll fit in tighter spaces! I put mine in the Braxton's parking lot lol there's inside benches there too
---
“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch” where exactly does this say DLC. He goes on to include DLCs in the list of free updates, but this is the core quote.
---
And to actually respond to your argument that DLCs can’t be free - that is what the cosmetic sales in the atom shop were supposed to be for. That’s why so many people continued to buy cosmetics even when the game was broken and unplayable for many. They thought they were supporting the games future. Come to find out they were just lining Bethesda’s pockets while they implemented their real cash grab.
---
I'm gonna fill a vendor with 1c fusion cores.
---
fuck yes it would
---
I already bought the one year subscription and having a blast on my own world with my buds.
---
We actually did Ur-Anium Fever without some chode one shotting everything.
---
We launched a damn nuke without having to crouch around hiding so no one ran in to steal it.....
---
Shall I go on?
---
The best part is returning to normal world with 10 scrap boxes in a row with a sign that says 14.95
---
I find it funny how people think having an unlimited amount of junk isn't pay to win. This game is really going to shit and these Bethesda fanboys are allowing it to.
---
Hope they’re working on a hotfix
---
A bit oldskool but you might try Battlespire. Its just fighting Deadra, beginning till end.
---
I like the service.  Single player FO76 is great
---
Please don't say this I just logged off...... My scrap 😦
---
&gt;vault experiment
---
Yeah, I can see how they are trying to increase income but experimenting with what everyone will freak out about and whatnot. Everyone thought that will be 15$ one time for a PVT server and now 100 per year is making everyone crazy. The actual sub benefits are not that game-breaking, I'm guessing the guys expecting PVS are most angry right now.
---
What platform? Seeing these reports but I haven't seen the platform mentioned.
---
I'm actually in awe this is not part of an Onion article. 
---
How are you going to charge $100/year for stability and the ability to store as much stuff as you want, which has been a staple of Fallout, and then throw on stuff already for sale that no one bought to justify it? 
---
Are they serious? Is anyone buying this?
---
Thank goodness I avoided getting on Mr Howards Wild Ride
---
#3
---
That is "par for the course" for Bethesda
---
Same ☹️
---
So the scrap box is a glorified trash can?
---
Scrap not showing up in the box ... cuz I found out it still in your stash and goes there so they probably aren’t checking or moving them over.
---
Cry moar
---
But still, fuck Bethesda right now.
---
Eso was a better game when they started the thing their doing here eso launched with a subscription the it went free then they turned the game around.
---
Plus eso is a much more content rich game even at launch. And modding still up in the air the nature of how they update the game where it reverts game files back I have my worries about modding it like we used to textures, reskins, etc.
---
I use a mod now that let's me have perk loadouts and it breaks me being about to name them something as simple as naming gets broke every update.
---
Literally $100 + whatever you paid for the game
---
That's what you get when you trust Bethesda with your money!
---
I’m leaning towards 1st as in Fallout 2nd will be the $15/month plan and offer unlimited weapon stash then Fallout 3rd the $20/month plan that will allow you to have a “private server” hosted by them but will allow up to 24 players on the server! Genius move really!!
---
How often are you spending money on the atom shop?  How often do you think anyone else is?  Games require money to produce, if there's no money... then there's no game.  You have two options here, Pete keeps his word and we continue with a game people aren't spending any money on until Bethesda eventually decides the losses aren't worth it and shut down the servers... or a few people occasionally pay money into a service like this and the rest of us get to keep playing the game for free.
---
Kind of a dick move eh? Why would you be happy that someone helping keep the game up is suffering?
---
Significant content is all still free lol smh. And no successful mmo can be sustained with cosmetic micro transactions. They should told everyone it would be like eso so people wouldn’t cry when it had to be
---
Wastelanders will likely lock conversation options behind paywalls at this rate!
---
There's a disconnect timer that lasts 20-30 minutes. If you log out of a private server, play adventure for a bit, and go back to private it'll be a new instance. This is a good thing because it allows you a short period of time to reconnect and not lose progress.
---
You must be the last person playing this game.
---
not when it's unregulated. for example, lootboxes. that's what happens the free market goes unchecked, a whole continent needs to band together in order to examine how badly it's screwing over customers.
---
&gt;Only $100
---
???
---
Why should you get his stuff for free when you see no problem with Bethesda nickeling and diming you for features that, because they were standard with the older games, Bethesda already has the resources for? 
---
There's a reason I redownloaded Fallout 4. I don't have to pay for unlimited stash there, which, evidenced by Bethesda's addition of unlimited scrap to Fallout 1st, doesn't slow down servers at all. I can also mod FO4 (NCR Ranger armor). Not to mention that the Creation Club is a whole lot more bang for your buck than the Atom Shop. Today, I got a whole bunch of outfits for free in the Creation Club, along with an armor paint job that works for multiple types of armor. Those outfits at full price cost less than a FO76 wallpaper. I also don't need to have my very own server in order to avoid griefers. Mind you, that's because FO4 isn't multiplayer, but still, I shouldn't have to pay for my own server in order to avoid griefers.
---
That's not highly functional feature. 
---
You can't block them from your friendlist, to be not temporarely there. You can only block them from a server. So you'd have to wait for them to join that private server, and then block them (temporarely), in which case I guess they would be kicked out instantly.
---
It really overall doesn't sound great, there really should be option about creating "normal" private server and then pin protected private server.
---
&gt;not saying the devs are completely blameless
---
Good.
---
Insert **"you get what you fucking deserve"** meme here. I couldn't be happier to hear this happened!
---
Out of curiosity how are you guys losing scrap?
---
So what? I barely ever use atoms for anything they are basically pointless.
---
To anyone who assumed that the scrapbox was going to work perfectly: what game have you even been playing for a year? Of COURSE it deletes your stuff. It's Bethesda. They have the worst programmers you can assemble.
---
We all know the US is a bunch of overconsuming war mongers but geeze do you have to brag about it
---
it was removed a while ago but I believe you have 24 hours to get it from the easter bundle.
---
Oh wow yeah that’s actually cool. Doesn’t seem very p2w at all.
---
Super
---
It was pure shit alright.
---
Nah. There is a whole subreddit for that, r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I even posted a positive post there just to see the response. They did not disappoint.
---
Call me old fashioned, but I remember when $60 bought you a whole game full of content, then afew months after launch, you could throw $15 at the devs for a neat little expansion. Sorry, I'm just not used to taking out a small loan to pay for features that should already be in the game.
---
I defended this game so much but now I legit can’t. I’m done, I can’t believe I’m saying this but 76 is getting put on the shelf and probably for a very long time.
---
Is it true that you can't invite or kick someone from the server? That only your friends can join, but you can't control which?
---
Sadly that won’t happen. You’ll still get a collection of Uber nerds that will find any justification to buy into this mess and defend it.
---
funny how people managed to make skyrim p2p even without the source. but I guess Fo76 runs on magic, huh? not literally a revised version of the same engine.
---
Bethesda/Zenimax behaves like the stupid little brother that wants to be as big of an asshole as his bigger siblings (ea, activsion, etc) but fails horribly.  He behaves like an asshole but is a lot crueler and alarmingly incompetent.
---
Pete may have no input in the creative direction of BGS, but he certainly has the ability to tell them what NOT to do.
---
Other games offer private servers at launch for freee. Also the first M in mmo is “massive” idk why you would consider 32 players in a server massive in comparison to others that are actually massive. 
---
I know you might feel like you need to defend your purchase and play time because who wants to admit they fucked up? But look at things objectively and know when you’re getting fucked.
---
"hOw cAn iT bE pAy tO wIn?"
---
- everyone who has never tried to capture the munitions plant workshop.
---
Another patch and it still isn't fixed. Guess they spent all of their efforts on Fallout 1st... fuck this game.
---
Outer Worlds in 2 days. TYVMYW
---
I ever do quit this game for good, that's exactly what I'm doing. Anyone wants to complain, I'll remind them they can grind for the stuff I had same as they told me I can grind for atoms in the Atom Shop.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJt_i2_vsSw) its an interesting youtube video that explains why Bethesda has gotten so greedy lately
---
&gt;in my opinion it seems as if some fo76 fans have tunnel vision they love the game/franchise so much most aren't willing to accept the fact that one of the main reasons fallout 76 was made was to be a cash cow and the game will probably never recover. look at battlefront 2 for example the game is actually really good now but even now it still has community problems there's nothing bethesda can do to make this better in the majority's eyes after fallout 76's launch  
---
&gt;keep in mind fallout 76 has been on a downward spiral since launch its community is dying and even wastelanders won't be enough  
---
&gt;it's the hard truth nobody on this subreddit wants to bring up
---
With the amount of servers already owned and the dwindled playerbase this should be an option that costs them nothing since they're already there. 
---
It's like buying 50 hotels, having all but 150 guests leave, then trying to sell access to a hotel with only 3 people in it when you already own the hotel...and everyone else left because your hotel is shit
---
I hate to sound like a broken record and you’ve probably heard this many times before. But never, ever, under any circumstances defend any company or conglomerate. Stay on the fence and stay at arms length at all times. Other wise you just provide free damage control for them when they’re just fucking with you. If you happen to enjoy their shit.. cool.. go ahead but don’t go out your way to promote it unless that specific product is amazing.
---
Good
---
Mfers. Still with the ninja nerfs.
---
As if this community wouldn't notice.
---
It looks like wearing any of these, even just a hat, *should* count. I'm not 100% certain of that, though.
---
I know im amazed!!
---
I also bought a one month sub just for the outfit and the atoms so I could buy the Halloween bundle I’m a filthy capitalist what can I say
---
Yep
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Please help, Ive lost strangler armor power armor set &amp; support said nothing they could do..now i pay to lose all my vault steel😩😭
---
I’m not going to lie, I’ll probably pay and I don’t care. $12.99?  That’s basically a Baconator combo at Wendy’s.  It doesn’t bother me because game prices haven’t moved past $60 since when? 2004?  It doesn’t bother me.
---
Fo76 operates pretty much the same as Fo4 with an added online layer.
---
strip it off that and make it local only. bam, you have a modded Fo4.
---
Expecting things that were promised isn’t entitlement.
---
I have it and it doesn’t bother me. I mainly purchased to have it walking around my camp. I rarely ever look to see what it scavenged. Most of the stuff it  collected was useless to me anyway. It did get me 4 screws once.
---
Yeah we probably have Christmas and New Years events coming. If Wastelanders isn't ready they don't want to go head up with the competition. In a few months people will have played outer worlds 3-4 times through. I see Private servers and NPCs as a soft relaunch of the game giving "fans" (cough cough) what they want, a single player MMO lolol
---
So I just bought fallout 1st on pc and I switched from a private world to a public one and then back to private again with 30 asbestos in my scrap box and it was still there, doesn’t mean this bug doesn’t exist but it’s not bugged for everyone EDIT: I will however only be storing my common junk in there and will keep my screws and ballistic fiber etc in my stash just to be safe
---
You are either onto something or on something
---
it's like the third time I'm saying this today, but Wendy's doesn't sell you moldy food and then asks for a premium so you can have the edible stuff.
---
Just because he made the question personal does not mean he's making it all about himself; he's merely asking for a clarification for _ALL_ long-time players, because he is one himself. He could just as easily have said, "As one of these long-time players, how am I (or we) being affected?" Either way, it's the same thing.
---
I died the first time someone posted this joke months and months ago. I type all my stuff from beyond the grave now. After I throw out stuff so these people have to grind for it, same as they tell me all about how I can grind for atoms.
---
lol accept when a company lies to you because tHAt's ReALitY!  lol
---
Whatever you say, chump.
---
If you are on PC I can take care of your account though :)
---
Sorry chief
---
If you're in the US and don't mind not getting the original case you can pick up a copy at Redbox for $10 to keep.
---
At this point I feel like they want everyone to just support obsidian
---
Wait you don't even get to keep it? It's only yours as long as ur a "1st" member?
---
There isn’t even a workbench at the tent. It provides convenience alone. And you can’t build at them.

NOT LISTED:
---
The collection rates for Scrap Bots was nerfed BY HALF in order to make the paid "1st" subscription and it's bottomless junk stash more appealing.

Little do they know that you can get a *better* outfit from the Third Street Municipal Building if you go through the Municipal sewers.
---
Lots of angry poors on Reddit.. good thing most of the player base doesn't use this garbage website.
---
Oh well, ill just collect more and put it in my endless stash....ppsstt, its in my butt!🤫
---
If you cancel you do keep everything but private worlds apparently, and I have no idea what Sony's refund policy is like
---
You need to do the next best thing and make today your last day playing FO76 ever.  Send them a message.  I "sent mine" long ago.  Nobody deserves this much insanity from a single game.

19,200 caps over 12 months

Tent/stash 
---
Emotes, skins, and a private server, supports more free DLC for everyone else in the playerbase.
---
That’s a good deal in my book. If you don’t think it is, don’t buy it.
---
Something something "arrow in the knee"
---
It’s not really being exploited if it’s not a necessity though right?  What other alternatives would you provide to keep the game up? They’ve already done cosmetics, as well as small qol items.
---
These quotes really highlight how much Bethesda has strayed from what they promised, just makes me really disappointed.
---
Is it.... Everyone? Or just some people..?
---
Ok, Look at No Man's Sky? That was released and was hammered big time. They have stepped back fixed things up and I've heard its better then ever and has a decent player base.   
---
I expected this to happen with 76 as well. But this pay/sub crap is next level.
---
You should have bought more “cosmetics” then and they wouldn’t have to do this lol....BETA whining 😂
---
no Zenimax publishes Bethesda Game Studios. Beth Softworks publishes ID, Arkane, Machine Games, etc
---
I can understand a subscription fee if the game itself didn't already cost $60 just to buy.
---
Anyone that knows anything about how databases work already knew that their excuses were bullshit. Storing literal billions of an item uses no more data than storing one of an item (assuming they are using 32bit integers), regardless of the item's in-game weight. Theoretically, a person with 100lbs of many different &gt;1lb junk items could require more data than someone stashing a 1000lbs of weapons; however, that is even unlikely, because each character file probably just has a database with an entry for every item in the game, including items they have none of, with the number they have stored with it.
---
&gt;I'm going to start downvoting all of them. 
---
That'll show 'em.
---
Just use caution with it for a moment. I tried it out the same way when I first heard of the glitch and then I dumped a bunch of scrap in it and lost it.
---
There's a lot of great lore in 76, but... yeah, Outer Worlds is going to be vastly more entertaining.
---
When I came back I got a robot that gathers scrap and a fridge. And I did the Pioneer scout quest for a backpack. And now I am doing dailies and slowly progressing with Possum challenges to get 8 Possum badges for a backpack expansion. So there is something to do that is pretty nice if you come back.
---
Soooooo I'm probably gonna be that rube. Honestly I've bought all the other outfit atom bundles and this is an equivalent value, and the best ensemble yet
---
Please tell me more
---
What if I got a $15.00 Xbox card for you? would you throw in the explosive lasers then
---
*RENT*, not sell.
---
I didn’t mind vanilla 76 other than maybe the shoehorning of the BOS into the game.  Other than that though, no real complaints.
---
Okay well it's no different than that then aside from now you have atoms whether you want to spend them or not or you have outfits, I dunno how they're doing it. 
---
I'm honestly not sure how many more servers Bethesda needs for private and that's partially where my suspicion lays. Each server had what, 12 people on it at launch? Not exactly stable but there were enough to get on at launch before issues struck. The player base dwindled intensely and I don't think Bethesda shutdown any servers already running. So them offering to lower player count is just spreading people more evenly around servers they already have but charging people for it...after driving people away for a bad game.
---
Wow. The projection...
---
What do you mean? This sub is a complete circle jerk and suckfest when Bethesda goes back to being quiet and not digging themselves deeper into controversy.
---
Sure the Sub is a ghost town where people just post pictures of their characters and dream of good content they could add, or making excuses for bad game mechanics but that's still a circlejerk, just a lethargic dying one.
---
Its not a privte server and its worse than adventure mode, total waste of money how the F is it pay to win
---
Might have actually broke 500pds of bulk down to put in the box you see... So....
---
I was just focusing on the Video Game portion of their business, but yeah, they've stayed the course for a long time.
---
Got 'em
---
So sad man I literally had 10 hours in just getting my upstairs floor perfect moving 3 blocks around and countless more doing everything else:
---
https://youtu.be/4Ua2Sg7P04Q
---
I actually do see it as pay to win. The increased inventory space and secondary camp gives a huge edge to players in the open world game. This means faster leveling and inventory edges.
---
It also means that with scrap elsewhere they have much more space to use for storing multiple builds or sets they can store to have advantages in upcoming raids and coming world bosses, even if they are minor. Look hard enough and it is a advantage. Its small but very real.
---
Not yet at least - people on your friends list can join your private server easily enough at least.
---
I feel like they were for sure prepared for this shitstorm and nobody is panicking or working overtime at Bethesda right now.  This is all being done cold and calculated.  They are a business, this is what they do.  We are their customers, it's on us to prove to them that this is the wrong approach.
---
I started Fallout 4 again, fresh new character, from scratch. It feels nice and weird. My brain tells me to look for the blue stash box and I don't remember which junk items were essential.
---
Not really? He could have said:
---
We, the community, FO76 Players, supporters, Bethesda Fans, fans, players, the average player, etc.
---
The choice of 'I'm' clearly meant him, but either way it's still a dumbass comment? Unless he hasn't seen the literal 10's of hundreds of posts in the subs, and the first thing he did was read one post and comment under it then he is moronic. If he doesn't not see the fault in Bethesda for making this move, then he is moronic.
---
Pretty simple really.
---
I support Hong Kong, but to be fair Blizzard has been pretty adamant about supporting the game and keeping politics/social justice out of their games or esports scene. I would like for Blizzard to allow the anti-China comments, personally, but it sets a precedent which I understand why they would want to avoid. I would be more upset if Blizzard was inconsistent with this general stance on avoiding using their games as a platform to promote an agenda. 
---
More so to the point of this thread and greed, Jeff Kaplan is the last bastion (for me) at Blizzard. Blizzard has moved to a profit margin company pushing cosmetic micro transactions over quality content.
---
You merely rented the game.
---
I rarely play anymore. If I ever do quit and uninstall the game, I'll stick around on the foolish dream that Zenimax (let's be real, they're the ones making these choices, *not* Bethesda) will get their head out of their ass and I can reinstall the game and get back to buying atoms in the Atom Shop without having to put aside my conscience.
---
There are more games being made these days then ever before! Just because the big budget stuff these days is profit maximizing stuff doesn't mean there isn't great indie stuff.
---
Not the person you asked, but I got my canvas bag a while ago. Much better quality, but idk what I'll do with it.
---
Update: It sure has been nice to own all three power plants, the ammo factory and hemlock holes without some clown trying to take it from me. It was a very relaxed extended session of farming supplies, legendaries, components and fusion cores.
---
The mmo aspect is cool and all, but sometimes I need a break from the nonsense and just need to play my way at my own pace. $12.99 well spent! If that bothers anyone on this board, then so be it. It's not your money or your business. Stop playing, go trade it in or whatever it is you do and move on.
---
Side note: the ranger armor is badass! And the survival tent is a very convenient little tool (as intended).
---
Honestly i think Bethesda should make Nuclear Winter free to play, it would give them huge revenues from the atom shop and would allow them to polish that game a lot more.
---
Not to mention they are actually private lobbies and not private servers. Private servers suggest a persistent server that stays open even if the owner logs off kinda like realms for Minecraft. This is not what Bethesda is offering.
---
tbf it was only cosmetic at launch. But also who's fault is this exactly? Plus Pete Hines represents Bethesda/Zenimax as a whole. Not just BGS.
---
U actually said no lol. U are full of shit
---
Just a sampling...
---
**Very Rare:**  
---
Ultracite, Coal, etc  
---
**Rare:**  
---
Ballistic Fiber, Fiber Optics,   
---
**Uncommon:**    
---
Fiberglass, Screws, etc  
---
At the moment this is directed at the raw materials vs the "Junk", but slippery slope...
---
The incessant whining about people whining about the Atom shop &amp; now a subscription service are ruining this group.
---
Let's remind everyone that they told us there were storage limits because of server performance issues. Now, as long as you pay a premium there's apparently no storage issues for particular items. Very weird honestly. They've somehow made does performance issues just miraculously disappear. 
---
not to mention, they're also adding NPCs to the world relatively soon, which should almost definitely bring on more server instability... Or not. Perhaps it was always their plan to have it behind a paywall.
---
no real complaints? the lack of content, bugs, lag are all fine in your eyes?
---
I guess this is how they manage to get away with such scummy business practices.
---
Triple!  I like my heart attacks rough and serious!
---
I've read this and it calmed me some, I reckon I have more then 800pds of junk stores in the junk box which is making me not calm. Stashes can't go over can they?
---
I disagree. I've she's both extensively in the past eso mroe so fallout it's been a while but they give a equal advantage eso is almost unplayable without a craft bag but never gets shit for it. Nor should it but I've argued my point and I respect yours j just don't see it that way at all.
---
I’d 100% be down for this. I absolutely love 76 and honestly this subreddit has just become hate posts. I’d love to go to a sub that isn’t people complaining about a relatively cheap subscription that is entirely optional to buy.
---
This also got my attention
---
It’s definitely not less than 1% approval.
---
It sucks that the content is locked, but it’s not necessary really. You aren’t negatively affected by not paying
---
And calling someone an idiot for putting money into a game they enjoy is just toxic and unnecessary
---
“It's amazing how much this sounds like the people who CANNOT BELIEVE there is a $5 door charge to see this band because they're going to buy one well drink and it's not like this is Slipknot, so there shouldn't be a charge. You should be happy they came. For free.”  
---
Terrible analogy asshat. People paid $60 for the game. They expect $60 worth of game and shouldn’t be nickel and dimed every chance. SHAME ON YOU for this terrible comment.  Seriously, you’re a shill - go kys
---
The video game industry! False promises and preorders! Promises of patches to fix the fact we released a bad game! Woooo! Delayed while 3 DLC's are pumped out. Finally bug fixes! Praise for making it playable like it should've been at release! Rinse repeat
---
How much are Bethesda paying you to be here and write comments on Reddit :P
---
I was just hoping for a reach around.
---
Only $100 for a non-laggy server where enemies die when you kill them and don’t teleport.
---
Most of my day is dealing with far more stressful stuff, and really I look forward to some fun and distracting gaming to re-center myself.
---
I kinda expected today to be a mess, given the wastelanders delay, but I will admit to being hopeful it was less of an irksome shitshow. Seeing the news come across on reddit was less than beneficial to my calm.
---
So yeah ...
---
woah man that was fuckin insane
---
couldn't of said it better myself bravo!
---
Amen they made many great games then went to garbage like Fallout 76. 
---
They used to be great but now they are no better than EA or Epic Games.
---
&gt;We couldn’t return it, we couldn’t save it, all we could do was play it
---
One time I bought something I didn't like off of Amazon.  It was an impulse purchase, and I only realized my regret after it had been shipped.  Since then, I've been crying tears of agony as I use it every day.
---
No, but seriously, I put it in a box and put that box into my basement.  Turns out, not using it was always an option.  Same deal with this game.
---
But they ~~fixed~~ ~~fixed~~ fixed the Sentry Bot looping machine gun sound!
---
How is it even pay to win? The fridge, the repair kits, the tent, and scrap stash doesn’t make one player better than an other. All that stuff is more for convenience in a game that has plenty of micromanaging.
---
I don't even take the scrap it collects. I don't care about it, I just wanted a damn robot. And that's what I got.
---
And banking on (haha bank) some people not stopping and getting multiple months, etc.
---
I don't get the grief towards 4. I sank hours and hours into that game and liked it. Not my favorite Fallout but a great one imo. I never got why it got so much heat
---
You can read my post angry little man my opinion is pretty valid considering craft bag equivalent in fallout would be what they are doing. Bethesda marketing team did this because people like esos structure. I never said it works in fallout i said it's not pay to win.
---
Watch out for this guy.
---
I think this is why they call them "private worlds" but future features will probably make them like private servers at some point.
---
Thank you lol. People just want to cry and whine these days. BETAS!!
---
\*Insert Atomic shop tracks here\*
---
Supreme Membership where you pay even more and they just increase the atom bundle each month to 75% off! Yessssss!
---
You made this?  
---
...
---
*I* made this.
---
In all seriousness tho. The game is a mess, I understand some people enjoy it, but its so barebones. At the fucking least release wastelanders first and then MAYBE, ask for a subscription, but don't add exclusive P2W garbage to it, ffs.
---
It really didn't effect me that much. Barely scratched the service of what I have in scrap on my mules. Just wanted to give the warning out to us simpleton that bought into it. So much for the karmic idiot toaster or whatever it is that makes you giddy.
---
Ticket: 191023-004249
---
Theres no way they'll remove it, to many idiots have already bought into it.
---
God of War says hi. And Bloodborne Mario and Zelda and countless others.
---
When was it delayed until? I can’t find any info about that
---
&gt; “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our  content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs"  
---
&gt;\-Pete "Cosmetic" Hines
---
Must be new they've spend last year defending it.
---
It has an effect on the bartering community I enjoyed since they're forcing private server products onto public servers. The sub ruins the end game.
---
I'm not buying the new TES game unless it comes with a free blowjob machine.
---
There is a point here that the money go for manpower but will they? I'm a dev for this you need few database engineers for supporting the project, servers, someone to support the servers, infrastructure and the team who develops the game needs to be bigger. My guess is this is the biggest expense of the game companies. They try with few ppl than they should push them for shorter deadlines and in the end you got a big pile of unoptimized code and junk in it because everyone was in a hurry (#devlive). 
---
Does this thing need to be 5$ per month if not brought down by the outrage who knows?
---
I already pay for a similar thing. 100 bucks a year for the ability to login to the network and co-op online with other users just to be able to play my fav games but I kind of get a nice game every few months... The Fo price is ridiculous for this type of service.
---
You guys are funny. The game will be fine without you.
---
Might try it this weekend just to have it. Not keeping it though. I dont want to support this game ever again.
---
This is awesome!! I was saying literally only yesterday that i wish they would reduce the impact on camp budget that display items use up! #Winning! haha
---
That's exactly it. PVP is such a waste of time. In adventure mode it's usually a one sided event in the first place.
---
Alright I'm gonna hop on the caboose
---
Yup im in the same boat.  All my 400+ pounds of junk disappeared.
---
I hope this subreddit learns to not be so negative all the time. It’s unhealthy for everyone in it and the game itself
---
Suckers
---
I haven't and don't plan to, as I can't see any benefit that would enhance my play style; playing smart and hard, no need for me to rely on spending money to help my game.
---
&gt;And there will be another one before November ends, just watch.
---
*"Bethesda locks formally free features behind paywall after lukewarm reception to the new subscription system"*
---
Lol i got my wish. Players scrap inventories are being completely deleted. Tonight turned out pretty good :)
---
Okay Bethesda bot. Beep boop
---
Like, in all seriousness, I wish that there was an “I don’t fucking care” response for every quest giver in every open world game.
---
Sure the same thing can be said about eso being a full priced game with a microtransaction stall (with pay to win mechanics) and a subscription but it is backed up by aloooooot of content and if you seriously play that game alot than the subscription is worth it as it gives alot of benefits for it price.
---
Fallout 76 on the other hand hasn't had much added since launch and the subscription offers very little for what you pay for.
---
&gt;I would buy the ranger outfit
---
They will see the error of their ways and release the Ranger Outfit on the Atom Shop for real money.
---
I can guarantee that Wasterlanders is not going to release as a polished update. Its going to fundamentally breaking the game and then Bethesda is finally going to pull the cord leaving it as a mess. Please dont fall for this stuff, it should have been clear months ago from now Bethesda doesnt give a shit about this game and only wants money.
---
(Noone cares if you defend it.)
---
I think it’s a shame that you did this. You’re rewarding bad behavior.
---
Wow that was quite the overreaction. If anyone just threw a tantrum it was obviously you lol. 
---
I never bought the game and have nothing to complain about. Just pointing out the dumpster fire that the game is. 
---
Also if anyone were to know the complexities of video game design it would be me. I literally went to school for computer game design and make video games for a living. 
---
Also very rational of you to just throw insults all over partner. You’re obviously not the upset one.
---
Yeah lots of the bugs have been patched since last time I played. Runs good now, I'd say it's a good time to jump in.
---
....I mean you were comparing ESO to Fallout, ESO and Skyrim are atleast in the same world, Fallout and ESO aren't..
---
Yep.
---
No.
---
Ahhhh the good ole last stand too late into the downfall. You can just smell the tears.
---
One year after launch and I’ve just had no motivation to play this game. Every time I try I get frustrated at something gameplay wise that feels worse/clunkier than FO4 and quit.
---
I’m sure I haven’t given the game a fair shot. I’m sure there’s been many patches, expansions to make the game better than launch, but after hearing this ridiculous news today, I’m so let down at the vision of the game and will probably just move onto other titles.
---
It's funny, can't argue, but personally don't love nerfs to things people paid money for, especially stealth nerfs.
---
Are you stupid? this sub is a total scam
---
Salty? You're the one salty here, what does the other person have to be salty over?
---
No it's not. It's insane that corporations have brainwashed you idiots into thinking they're your friend and they need your help. They see you as cattle. Which is largely accurate for many of you witless drones who sponsor these greedy practices.
---
Do you provide reach around before or after Todd vends is over.
---
You never...bought the game...
---
**boggles**
---
Also don't bullshit a bullshitter, you don't make video games, pal.
---
Go outside then :P
---
Fanboys dont care...they just ask Todd to go deeper while they collect more junk 😂
---
Do you really think they will put 5 years of updates into this game? Not trolling I’m legit asking.
---
I was just making some suggestions on what would improve the pay system they’ve got in place for me. The server requirement I talked about makes the private server useless to me unless I’m playing solo, because no one I know that plays is interested in the game enough to pay for a subscription.
---
And THEY are the ones losing their shit on the reddit right now after Bethesda Austin just decided to "delay" wastelanders and instead dropped this little gem in their laps.
---
I got the year subscription. I play the game enough it's worth it to me 🤷‍♂️
---
Bethesda is owned by Zenimax. This shit is most likely their idea, not Bethesda's. Unfortunately, Bethesda is then the one that suffers because if we all vote with our wallets, that doesn't make Zenimax get their head out of their ass. No. What it does is make Zenimax shut down Bethesda.
---
How is it pay to win? I didn't get that from it
---
Rdr2 on PC is going to be fun but those are the two games that I've been playing anyway and in a bit we got outer worlds coming out so it's good times.
---
A subscription service in general is a good business decision for this type of game. A GOOD subscription service would be a much better one. 
---
This one offers little of value, so while it may initially grab a lot of impulse buyers—the ranger armor certainly helps that—it won’t retain them for months and years ahead.
---
The craziest thing is that they delayed the Wastelanders expansion (which seemed to be a step in the right direction) but announced this... Who in their right mind would think this was a good idea?
---
Thats not how any of this works...  
---
The weight of items doesn't actually factor in here at all, all the server has to deal with is the id's for the thirty three pieces of basic broken down scrap and the value for how many you have.  
---
Item weight has absolutely nothing to do with why there's a limit on stash space, the actual limit is on how many of these values the server has to load up every single time you and everyone else playing the game opens their stash.  Weight just acts as a cap on how many of those values the game has to deal with at once.
---
For $5.99 you can
---
I'm not saying to remove it, I just think it needs to be modified.
---
Warcraft 3 was better then Warcraft....
---
Hmm ones a single player rts game ones a 3rd person mmorpg
---
Skyrim is a single player 1st person rpg eso is a mmo 
---
Both comparisons are built on completely different structures. 
---
Fallout 76 and eso both are live service rpgs. Difference is fallout has no content so no one will really wanna pay for a sub eso actually has a large player base because of its content. 
---
But you have shown you have never played eso long term so I wouldn't expect you to realize the comparison.
---
In this case I'm sorry.
---
So, just like any modern mmo?
---
Yup. Monetise now. ~~Add content later~~.
---
Because we have a right as consumers to expect quality goods and services at reasonable prices. That’s the etiquette we should expect for our hard earned money.
---
I’m disappointed that you jumped on this so fast. You’re rewarding Bethesda’s bad behavior.
---
like what? If we are going by the logic that people use for other developers, especially ones under EA, then it would be Zenimax's fault for rushing the game in the first place.
---
If they had straight up said "We're moving to a Pay 2 Play model. Here's a reimbursement to those who bought the game. Thank you" I would have given them a pass. They could have been transparent in the situation, but instead they pulled this shit.
---
I am done.
---
I do agree that some of the atom shop prices are a tad over priced. And the pay for private server things... is not that bad actually. Most games that do it are about that price for a server, but with those you also get atoms, cool cosmetics and stuff. 
---
And sorry if I’m just being dumb, but what In-game purchase necessity are you talking about?
---
Is this choose my own adventure? Because this timeline is fucked as is.
---
Just the title deserves platinum. But I’m flat broke! So here’s an updoot!
---
Yeah I just tried to. The server's crashed on me twice already
---
&gt;  Edit: Lmao funny how on the anniversary of the bombs dropping BGS bombed their studio metaphorically
---
lol I hadn't even noticed that.
---
Naaa, EOD wouldn’t take me for medical reasons IRL, so playing with video game bombs is the closest thing sadly...
---
Bethesda really looking trashy now. Makes me wish they never bought up fallout
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
Elite riot armor from New Vegas DLC Lonesome Road
---
Ok but is the scrap box and Survival tent  exclusive to private servers? Or can it be used in survival as well?
---
It's seems like a popular trend these days only Bethesda has taken it to a completely new level.
---
"Create the problem, sell more problems" - Bethesda
---
ftfy
---
Lmao I was thinking bout this too mf and you win
---
Better not yell Free Hongkong in game... Lol.
---
&gt;shoehorning of the BOS into the game.
---
Don't worry bro. We've got NCR Veteran Rangers now.
---
I'm not even North American and I understand the geographic durp going on there. Cha-ching!
---
Found Todd, How much for a reach around I only got $3.50. I can pay this monthly as a subscription based reach around.
---
That seems like a lot of XP. I think I'm going to have to prioritize getting the Nuclear Winter stuff over the event stuff.
---
If the server can keep me in a game for more than 10 minutes I'll give it a shot
---
Implying any money they get is going to go back into FO76.
---
Your junk is still available to be used, but you cannot increase it until emptied first.
---
Thats debatable. The demo ranch ar15 is a $400+ rifle but it has sub par internals. But it looks amazing.
---
I have a feeling that public test servers will be locked behind this subscription.
---
GUYS GUYS MAYBE THEY HAVE NO WEIGHT PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST DITCHING IT AT LOGOFF
---
100 dollars for anything post launch is steep, hell, a 100 dollars for ANYTHING PERIOD involving a game is steep. But *100 a year* for a few in-game perks in a game that's so severely lacking?
---
I tried to give Bethesda some credit when the game launched but this shit is ridiculous
---
Yada yada... sense of pride and accomplishment... yada yada
---
Not specifically no but i did feel like it was somewhat aimed at me and others who've already stopped playing. Wasn't for this bs i'd gladly be waiting and play when wastelanders comes, but after this stunt? No.
---
Not waiting in excitement anymore if they look at me with money signs over my head. So in that sense voicing how i feel is my only answer i can give to provide feedback, since i'm already not playing the game to make them lose my time played on the servers, like an on/off tick "boycott"
---
That was pre-war riot gear if you paid attention to New Vegas.
---
Looks like some people haven't played new vegas
---
i'm not gonna waterboard you with explanations so in short absolutely not.
---
Go back to T_D if that's the level of discussion you can muster up.
---
Rushing the game maybe but Bethesda still made conscious non time pressure related choices like not having human NPCs, making workshops useless, having a bland and grindy main questline, and so on that hurt the game.
---
At least until the scrapbox glitches out and you lose 370lb worth of scrap forever... (it happened to me and many others)
---
Pete Hines literally told everyone that they will -never- go to a subscription based model.
---
I bought 76 at launch, Tricentennial Edition. I bought the Elder Maxson coat Atom bundle for 9.99. Today I bought a year subscription to Fallout 1st and I had a whale of a time!
---
They did. Now lol
---
I don’t see how anyone can justify spending more then Netflix per month on one single game that you already paid full price for for next to no new real content. 
---
This is insane.
---
But knowing that, how do you feel about its 400 dollar pricing? Someone with less knowledge will buy it based on its appealing design and then have to learn the hard way it's a bad product. Does that not seem predatory, because its about whats happening here. People are already reporting thag the paid service is actually screwing them by deleting their junk, how is anyone defending this?
---
I hit that when I played FO3.
---
Its actually worse than adventure and in no way worth it unless you want to hold a workshop all day so sry I paid for it
---
Im sure there are better games out there if you just wanna explore. At least in my opinion, the map is big, but its kinda barren, and most places don't actually have anything interesting to see in them. :/
---
But it doesn’t make you better than another player. It’s just more space, it’s for convenience. You really don’t have any advantage, you just have more space to store more crap.
---
I thought about trying to play your game. Don't really like it and can't see it being useful.
---
You don't have to pay for atoms. And it's not limited time so you can take as long as you need to get atoms.
---
Good call, I'll use that term!
---
There’s so fucking much to say ima start out with saying fuck Todd Howard and the fact that this game is now pay to have fun not only win nobody asked for you to put in pay to get private worlds we shouldn’t have to pay for she we should have gotten on day 1. And I really like how they think this will pull people back it’s pushing more and more people off this game that had great potential then Todd Howard just fucked it up thanks for coming to my ted talk have a good night y’all
---
I just wrote in another post that it's the same price as my PSN and I get a free game there once a few months there is something interesting.
---
Cool, that’s.
---
Wait a second. What did Bethesda do? I haven't played the game in months, but was looking forward to the first-person / Wastelanders mode. Will I not be able to play it now without a subscription?
---
did you just have a stroke?
---
I think Juicehead has the most level headed response to this. He doesn't like it, but if you're the type of player that buys from the atom shop because you want the stuff that gets put there, at $13 a month it is good value. That's actually cheaper than most MMO subscriptions, which usually come in at $15-16 per month. Hell, if you were to buy the same amount of atoms that the monthly stipend gives you, it would actually cost more than $13 to do that.
---
I think that this might be a way for them to test certain features in a live environment before rolling them out. Once they've nailed down private realms and got them working flawlessly they may release a version of it to the public, but keep specific features or population sizes to those who are willing to pay. Same with the scrapbox, I feel like it's something they want to give everyone (or at least slap on the atom store) but they don't want to crash the game by giving it to everyone in case having infinite junk weight causes the servers to implode.
---
Where the real negative is for me though is the price tag. I'm Australian so for some reason Bethesda is charging $23 per month and $174 per year, and when I did a currency conversion the prices don't match up, so they're tacking extra $$ onto the pricetag for us. Not sure how it is for other players outside of the US, but I'd be willing to bet it's similar for Canada and other regions.
---
You can come back for $15.99 a month
---
Not gonna argue with you, there's no point I think the subscription is shite and, *(and I say this not out of hate but because I think it's funny)* clearly you're so far up Todd Howard's arse It was probably you who said "Sixteen times the detail" when he opened his mouth enjoy your private worlds I'm going to play outer worlds
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
No problem
---
Pay over $300 and Todd will personally come to your home to take the money and call you a slut. Oh yeah and you het Le ebic vault 101 cosmetic and 76,000 atoms.
---
And people downvoted me when i predicted this game was a sinking ship.
---
Stop playing the game.Bethesda will get the wake up call.
---
Gotta support the free updates somehow
---
Great, now my YouTube home page will be filled with dozens of YouTubers making "angry rant" videos on the subject trying to farm those likes and views.
---
I don't mind the legit videos, but the people who are clearly just parroting what others have said so they can increase their views annoy the fuck out of me.
---
With my meathook only using 2 one handed cards and iron fist I one shot the alpha at Arktos most of the time, depending on server lag. Unarmed is the strongest that’s why they only get one perk card as opposed to three
---
Yeah I heard about all that... But, lets say I don't waste money on a membership. Is it still fun?
---
There’s so fucking much to say ima start out with saying fuck Todd Howard and the fact that this game is now pay to have fun not only win nobody asked for you to put in pay to get private worlds we shouldn’t have to pay for stuff we should have gotten on day 1. And I really like how they think this will pull people back it’s pushing more and more people off this game that had great potential then Todd Howard just fucked it up thanks for coming to my ted talk have a good night y’all
---
It's actually 3 months, and 93 karma, but I still get your point.
---
yes but doesn't mean its not pay to win they purposely make the atom process dreadful so the casual players are essentially blocked behind a paywall.
---
Mhm. L.A.P.D Riot Armour is *totally* what they're giving you for your subscription. Not:
---
&gt;*The distinctive black ranger combat armor consists of the Desert Rangers' traditional trench coat worn with pre-War riot armor. Ranger patrol armor is hand-manufactured in the NCR.*
---
Well when you consider that being able to sprint and Cavalier armor is a thing, you do have an advantage to having an unlimited scrap box in PvP.
---
How do you place it?
---
That’s not really true. 
---
No more scrap drops on pvp. 
---
I can craft unlimited stuff now vs non paid person.
---
I can keep rebuilding turrets after destroyed
---
I was just asking because it seems like they aren’t coming back anytime soon and the fallout 76 community has a bit of a reputation for being nice to other players, I mean if I was leaving I would totally give my items to someone else. Now I don’t see a problem with what Bethesda is doing because 1,) it’s optional and 2.) I don’t care, I don’t need to spend $100 to enjoy the game more than I already do. 
---
I fail to see how the creation club is better then the atomic shop. The creation club requires me to buy the points or wait for free stuff which is usually skins for the pip boy or armors I don’t use, The Atomic Shop uses atoms which I can earn for FREE by grinding the challenges and I consistently use the cosmetics and camp items I buy from The atomic shop.
---
Also I’m sorry you got attacked by griefers I luckily Haven’t met any and if I do I’ll just join a different server eventually avoiding them without having to pay.
---
How does the glitch work?
---
do it agian.
---
and again
---
I don’t mind it though.  Heck, I’m living in New Mexico these days.  The whole state is like that!  Like seriously, it’s relaxing.  I mean my favorite part of Elder Scrolls Online was the fishing.  Never got the master angler achievement though. :/
---
Looki here Bois!!!!
---
Another Bethesda account telling you yer wrong.
---
Account Created almost exactly on fo76 release date.  Omfg.  
---
If anyone can be bothered, go look atthe account of EVERY single “supporter” of this shit show and see how many are older than one year - bet yer ass it’s a ratio of 1 in 50 or less.
---
They aren’t even trying with this shit.
---
Mate, this isn't an upcoming feature, they literally released it today. I bet thousands of people already gave them the $100. It's not going to change, or go anywhere. They aren't gonna decide to refund those people.
---
This is the end of the line for people who agree this change is disgusting corporate greed and exploitation of fans. You either Jump Ship now or continue to get fucked in the ass.
---
they still charge for fan made mods on its "creators" platform.
---
Is Todd bending you over fun?
---
That's not really true. It's not a paywall if you can just make atoms doing easy stuff in game.
---
Replay Lonesome Road and dig through the terminals.
---
That is frightening.
---
and private servers arnt private. the biggest insult to it all. since if they WERE it might MIGHT justify the subscription
---
but NOPE.
---
what the FUCK are you paying them for then?
---
just so you so other players are ghosts on a SHARED server?
---
I'm running around mine right now. It's lovely.
---
10 day old Bethesda Reddit account people.  Don’t buy this shitshow they’re shoving at you. 
---
Horrid company.  Horridly unhandled tactics. Screw em
---
If you think they didn't intentionally stop raising the storage limits before it reached an acceptable amount on purpose, then you don't understand how online games work
---
Thier "Private worlds" cost as much as other games charge for actual servers. They indeed are careful not to call them servers even though they fail to mention that nearly all if not all other games that have private lobbies offer them for free.
---
That combined with the ability to plop down your tent any time you need it makes material farming runs insane.  You can collect literally every junk item at a location, walk a small bit, deploy tent, drop items in scrapbox.  Matters very little if you are over encumbered.
---
A non-1st subscriber can literally do all of that though. The only difference is you just have more space to store shit.
---
I didn't buy it. I just tried playing in general.
---
The elegant solution would have been paid servers if you want Bethesda to host it released along side a dedicated server client that people could use their own bandwidth and hardware to run their own for "free"(overhead for running your own server being the only expense).
---
Since they added features to the subscription that kind of shoots that idea in the foot though
---
And we’re back to this again. Bethesda marketed Fallout 76 as a full release with only cosmetic micro transactions, the can’t promise one thin then deliver another.
---
A car dealership can’t sell you a car with a maintenance plan then come back after sixth months and change that plan so you have to play for what was expected to be included. You understand this correct? This is exactly what Bethesda is doing with this new premium membership.
---
You could see the writing on the wall with the scrap kits wayyyyy back when the talked about releasing them. The outrage on this subreddit was massive and I agreed. Bethesda ignored all of it and went through with it.  Then they slowly kept adding more "convenience" stuff.......and then today happened. 
---
The atom shop would have done well if they had concentrated on simple weapon and armor skins.  Added new camp stuff at reasonable prices.  Basically they just needed to drown us in cheap 150 atom items that a person could earn and keep us logged in for.  The went with bundles with themes instead.....
---
I just can't fathom what they were thinking tbh. We waited nearly a year for damn handmade skins, still have never seen a quality combat skin.  Where is my Responder camp items??? Why can't my friend get any BOS stuff??? We waited 6 or 7 months for decent excavator skins which was and likely still is the most popular power armor.  Where is the log cabin building set??? Where are the greenhouse walls?? Why can't I buy clean versions of my crafting tables???? Where are wall mounted turrets????  The list goes on and on.
---
I get the private server thing....but what good is it if everything resets when I log off?? Why can't I get a bigger camp budget and build next to my friends?? What if I want to build a giant workshop??   Seriously whats the point??
---
Bethesda is so fucking tone deaf.....their whole mismanagement of this potentially great game is something to behold.
---
I still can’t finish the main story quests due to bugs yet they want me to spend 150% the original price of the game to continue playing a game I can’t play. 
---
Sound business practices there.
---
Fallout is a dead series. They went full EA with this one
---
I don't recall the bombs dropping on October 23, 2019 in the lore. That's a new retcon by Bethesda. lol
---
Todd is a genius
---
**lol**
---
🤓
---
Yes, at the very least give them the private world for free for a year if they don’t want to give away the atoms and outfit or even just a month for free for year long players I think would make everyone happier
---
I hope people finally wake up to what Bethesda has become. It sucks, but how is anyone seeing this different?
---
On PS4, it’s triangle under the favorites wheel. Idk the key/button for pc/Xbox but I’d assume it’s still under favorites
---
To burn $60?
---
Me three Brothers, Ad Victorium
---
I also bought that edition.  And the Atom bundle was an OK deal for the people that liked it.  Fallout 1st is a rip off and you got bamboozled by a company making a buck.  No wait it's not.  Let me backpedal here, it's actually a great value for you if you think it's worth the money.  The rage is b/c one of the features you got should really be part of the game we non-premium peasants already paid for.  They should remove any and all caps on scrap/ammo/chems for all players, since apparently it doesn't affect server stability like we were led to believe.
---
And don't be so proud to be a whale.  Whales are actually really gross up close.
---
Easy? most of the challenges are NOT easy
---
I still remember how cringey and fake Todd Howard sounded when he was gushing over a glow-in-the-dark map thing. "And it glows *in the* ***fucking dark*** ....so cool"
---
Oh no you can hold more scrap than me, I’m so disadvantaged!
---
I’ve noticed significant weapons nerfs. My melee ability, which was my main build, has been reduced to an absolutely unusable state. I can’t even play the game now. I’m done.
---
A non first subscriber could maybe build say example 20 turrets. 
---
A subscriber can build 500. 
---
So yeah totally not pay to win.
---
I'd rather pay for DLC than to pay a monthly subscription for added features that were standard in the older games.
---
Can you invite friends to it or do they also need to pay?
---
So if you are already not playing the game why are you flipping your shit on OP for telling people to stop playing? 
---
By the way, the post was directed at people who are still playing, so basically the opposite of you.
---
The shills here are saying that a thousand people bought the subscription today. Ok say they're right (I doubt it).
---
That's $100,000... That won't even pay half the annual salary of their lead developer. So fine without more people playing? Nope, no one plays the game and it's making no money, they can just close it off and say "sure, spend $100 to file and sue us for $100, cuck".
---
I don’t know about that. I only truly enjoyed Skyrim because of mods. And now Bethesda placed terrible restrictions to modders. The people who made their game playable and enjoyable. It’s like Bethesda has depression and is planning their suicide.
---
Anyone on your friends list can pop in whenever.
---
I rarely log on or post here. Reddit, I mean. Thank you for speaking my thoughts. 
---
This game had potential. I think I stopped playing after a few months of it coming out. Typical of them, it was not complete even then. Bethesda is a husk where quality content goes to be mutilated. They are run by hostile AI supercomputers.
---
Wastlanders Update available only in Private Worlds
---
\*deep breathes\* OK listen up i am not repeating this shit 
---
\-private servers should not be locked off to the subscription we should be able to rent it out for a cheaper price or for longer
---
\-unlimited storage for scrap is simply pay to win
---
\-new survival tent another "convenience" item to push the limits even more and try and normalize low key pay to win in a **Paid** game
---
\-1650 atoms to spend on those overpriced items (:
---
\-**RANGER ARMOR SET** the one outfit everyone was asking for was locked off
---
/s-Icons...*Yes probably the best item in the subscription* ***THIS*** *is worth 13 dollars a month or 100$s a year on top of the console subscription*
---
thats not worth 100$ sorry bud
---
Nope you just heard Todd unzip his pants
---
No they can’t. It’s literally just unlimited storage for scrap. It doesn’t increase your camp budget.
---
Nope. You can still play it without paying $13/month. It’s an additional option, not a requirement.
---
Ugh... That is honestly my worst fear. I'm really sorry this happened to you and how Bethesda handled it...truly unacceptable.
---
Ok np. Same feeling people get from buying overpriced coffee, burgers etc. Or a movie lol.
---
Flatwoods have been buildable. You could build right next to the church. Haven't even bothered to check how much of the town edges were buildable, but right next to church your camp area reaches some of the fixed buildings. People have always built there since beta, and then eventually moved it.
---
Not sure if they have fixed that, or is there some develoment that they are taking more room and evicting camps that are going to be in the way. It's not hard to imagine the wastelanders might have some few settlers that would move in to Flatwoods, not to repopulate it all but one or two hobos or a family could move in into any of those fine buildings.
---
It was so close, compared to any other towns and such, so it could have been unintentional and now finally fixed.
---
I'm sure we'll see it go free to play within a year.
---
Aren’t you already!???
---
Wtf.    I started 6 months ago, where’ve you been?
---
Bethesda digging their own grave. RIP
---
for long range detail, which is true
---
You really compared an in developing game to a complete car? 😂ok I’m done you win👍🏽😂👍🏽
---
Promised for free? Didn't think so.
---
"Vote with your $"
---
How else am i supposed to tell them i don't agree with their decision? So because i'm not playing CURRENTLY means i can't tell them i don't agree with them is basically what you're saying aswell then, same as the OP?
---
You just don't understand or comprehend what i'm saying and think i'm the stupid one, like the OP.
---
It's quite simple, telling people to just "not play" doesn't answer/solve anything. They've already got your money, only way to do anything is to moan/complain/criticise, to influence change, if nobody complained they wouldn't see anything wrong with the changes they're making.
---
If you stop playing it could mean a number of things, lack of internet, different games, bored currently etc. Not playing won't send a message.
---
You took the bait!!😂 BETA😂😂😂
---
No forplay just a straight ram in. On your birthday.
---
Yep you're right. See my other comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full\_list\_of\_mischief\_night\_rewards\_odds\_of/f4y5w9v/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of/f4y5w9v/)
---
It’s a very peaceful place.  If you ever come out here, rent a 4wd vehicle with some decent ground clearance.  It opens up sooooo many doors.
---
I have gambling issues this beats the casino
---
Another fucking new Bethesda account - 12 days old people!   Telling us to stop crying.
---
Bethesda was using these shill accounts to downvote complainers and upvote their own bs posts, but now Bethesda is actively using these account to post and tell us - almost literally mind you - to bend over and smile .
---
How can anyone even log into a Bethesda game at this point and still have any self respect left?
---
I agree but it's still awful and between the workshop fiasco, creation club, and this? It's not exactly a big secret what they were going for.
---
beep boop i am a bot let me summertime the patch notes for you:
---
We dont give a shit about the players we only want your money .
---
/s
---
im rejoining this subreddit NOT because i support this game but that maybe in our collected rage . they might see how badly they fucked up.
---
That happens every time there's an update. Don't put your camp so close to a marked location and it won't affect you.
---
Again, not true. I get atoms randomly without even trying a lot of the time. I guess you have bought a lot from the Atom Store if you don't have any and have such a hard time making them. So I guess you are supporting pay to win also.
---
Enjoy playing Outer Worlds then?  Perhaps one day you'll figure out that video games are neither a full time job nor a lover and you're allowed to play around with different ones as you feel like it instead of committing to a single one.  I'm actually playing four different games right now depending on what I feel like on a given day... so naughty.
---
Oh, sorry. Nuke fit better?
---
Don't be stupid. 12 dollars for all that is ridiculous value. This is literally the special 10 dollar packs that have periodically released, just with all these added benefits.
---
At least you’ll get enjoyment out of it.
---
Whatever makes you feel better, chad. \[=
---
About what, exactly?
---
Man, I dont understand your problem..
---
I've been following and donating to Skyrim Together since it started. It is a [server - client model](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimTogether/comments/8emmlj/official_faq_20_read_this_first_before_posting/). Just go to /r/SkyrimTogether and search "peer to peer" and you'll see people asking about it.
---
I think you're confusing cell hosting with peer to peer. Basically when two players are in the same server and one player teleports to another, the player who is already there is deemed the "cell host" by the server. If the server didnt have cell hosting, both players would spawn duplicate NPCs and enemies.
---
Peer to peer is predominantly in R* games since GTA IV and RDR1. This is why those games have massive hacking issue on PC as well as disconnects in general. Its not horrible but gets complex to code complicated mechanics in.
---
Try checking the stash box to see if it’s in there when you get back on Iv had problems with it still using my stash box I have to physically(virtually) move and put it in the scrap box. It might be it put it right back in your stash.
---
🖖🏾😂🖖🏾
---
I think that’s the part I edited out I thought you said some purchases were a necessity, not weren’t. I just think they could’ve done it better and the private servers should have been their own purchase, not attached to this subscription. I think if they provided exclusive deals, exclusive skins, exclusive opportunities to make significantly more atoms than the price of the membership then it wouldn’t be as bad, it just feels like they copy and pasted the subscription concept from ESO, down to the the amount of in game currency you get.
---
Well, there's your answer, you're not in the US. I'm doing T&amp;TU on new equipment placed and they're shooting for (and missing) 100/10. And that's right out of the box, not the end consumer.
---
HEY mr  35 day old Bethesda shill account, how about you lick deez ballz here?
---
How about dat?
---
But that's wasn't originally pre it was standard in game items exploited to be pre.. pretty much like stash sizes should be.
---
"Tadaaaa" - Todd Howard and Pete Hines
---
I guess you haven't had netflix since the beginning then. Their shit was broken as fuck when it first came out.
---
So yeah, they did.
---
Just curious, why do you dislike this idea, but yet decided to pay for the game at launch, and not return it after all of the controversy?
---
You should feel ashamed.
---
It was 8,300 yen when I got it
---
They're not going to respond. They're banking on additional new players coming with Wastelanders so that the new folk outnumber the detractors to the point where any negative flak would just be in the minority.
---
That's also probably why Wastelanders was delayed, because now they have more time to let this whole thing blow over.
---
If you've played more than 20 hours you have got your money's worth
---
Nah just buy outer worlds, it looks fucking beautiful n looks insanely better than anything bethesda can do to fo76
---
Take me down to Fissure Prime City, where the beasts are scorched and the legendaries are shitty.
---
You know, I've never been really into that
---
Like hell I will.
---
Yes. And I have it... but I've been having more fun killing people at workshops and then when they complain, telling them to get a private server. Its been music to my ears.
---
I like it! It's more apropos
---
I just don't think fallout 76 would be much fun without player vending and.....other players. Even if some are asshats.
---
I've been playing Fallout 4 the last few weeks. I love it but god dang I wish there were some people around.  
---
Anyhow enjoy your game dude.
---
I do a bit defended this game for too long
---
I mean, in a way, they were right. The dollars in my wallet hold more value to me that a copy of 76.
---
Real question, does the game really have an upsetable in-game economy? i honestly don't know i mostly avoid people in game, i see everyone saying its pay to win but i don't see how that effects other players in any real way. even if they can sell more stuff for caps does that actually effect anyone?
---
Normal folks feeling good about their 15 minutes of fame so to speak.
---
The Ranger uniform is actually one of the nicer apparel items, they surprisingly did a mad good job on it, don't know why but the helmet rubs me the wrong one, can't put my finger on it, but without the helmet the duster is awesome.
---
Kinda...
---
In my eyes Unoctium’s version is way too skinny and buggy. The F4NV version is too chunky and lacks modification. Both lack integration with the game world for lore reasons. That’s important to a lot of us.
---
Look, I may be nit-picking but the armor in-game looks great in FO76. The armor isn’t buggy nor does it clip with legs. That being said...I won’t purchase the subscription for that dumb crap. I’ll take buggy and crashy armors over expensive subscriptions.
---
And to further clarify, you just earn XP tp get the rewards. And if it's anything like the VTU rewards, if you're already a high level all you need to do is complete one or two matches to automatically all of the rewards at once
---
The people who paid for and are still playing this game will be close to the only ones who are price-insensitive enough to pay for 1st membership. Nobody else will be falling for that shit. Also if they know a player is likely to buy the 1st membership regardless, why should they give it to them for free? As angry as people get, Bethesda knows in the end they will eventually cough up the cash anyway.
---
I haven’t experienced this.
---
Huzzah!
---
Yes and no, it's a private instance, not server.   We can't change settings etc and workshops etcetera will still refresh once you leave.
---
Nope!
---
No one is forcing us to play a game thats been broken forever. I actually support this movement and I'm glad they charged for it.
---
Honestly I switched to this from destiny 2 because atleast this is different, it's open world and has alot of quests to do. Destiny 2 is pretty much the same grindy shit over and over and over lol
---
I also lost my CAMP after the update. An insanely detailed, fully immersive, gazillion hour permanent CAMP effort located in Flatwoods across from Green Country Lodge. I just made a post before I found yours. I'm so upset -- CAMP building is one of my main points of enjoyment in the game, and I can't even imagine trying to recreate it after all of that work. I'm furious, frankly. Relogging did nothing; I still received the error message. Trying to submit a ticket now.
---
So I just level up or something? No challenges involved?
---
Doubt they were going to anyway if you can't afford any other game... oof
---
I mean not really. I'm not spending the money for it. It's just from my experience the challenges I come across are hard to do for a solo player
---
Or give them everything that comes with the 1st membership EXCEPT for the atoms. I think people that originally paid for the game should at minimum get the tent and stash box.
---
I wish, its like 2000€ just for the plane ticket. If I'm rich someday I'll take your advice :P
---
Ain't blaming reddit solely, but Bethesda do check this feed and people do make these kinds of suggestions, just putting 2 and 2 together.
---
Of course it is up to bethesda to actually make the choices they want to make, but we as a fanbase should have also been more firm in communicating what we want and how we want it.
---
Then this isn’t it for you. 👍
---
Done! Called it r/fo76members
---
Those that want to join just need to screenshot an image of them in NCR ranger gear in FO76.
---
It that’s what they think this is man... it was never anything more than a cash grab fo skinned fortnite to them.
---
The problem was also the revenue split. There is no reason that Bethesda should be making profit from other people's work. If steam implemented a paid mod system and charged like 10% or something like they do for cards that's one thing but 25% was getting sent to the modder. So now they're charging $7 for a mod that could be $2. Nobody is paying $7 for a mod sorry. Creation Club idk. If the revenue split is fair and the contract is fair good on them but between the "CreAtIOn ClUB cReDITs" and selling mods that are lower quality than free alternatives it's suspicious to me that community modders are actually getting any benefit
---
Bold? You mean stupid and anti-consumer.
---
Ill help you out, give me about 5 minutes and ill be on.  Whats your gt?
---
It’s an unbelievably beautiful state and it’s not all desert like most believe.
---
I got it for this reason. Only paid for a month though and I’m glad because In the hour I played I felt a little lonely with nobody to do events with and then the game crashed.
---
It’s just another I’m leaving fake post
---
Outerworlds...? it's already installed on my Xbox thanks to the pass just have to wait now.
---
Try 4-5,000 Pds of junk...... ticket no: 191023-004249
---
If you are a player that actually purchases atoms, and would have anyway, then yea.
---
Up until now, the only things that have been locked behind a pay wall, were various cosmetic outfits that came with atom bundles.   If the ranger outfit was done the same way, that would be totally fine with me.  It’s really the tent and scrap box that I think are ruining this for everyone.
---
I watched some reviews and that looks like it will be boring soon enough also. Guess ill just stick to my ARPG's. I am afraid to buy any new games anymore, this year has been a disaster for gaming.
---
Its what like maybe an hour of my day to afford it?  Sure i can spent the $100 on more stocks maybe somthing else ill probably forget i bought. But $100 for 12 months its just another amazon auto pay. Do i need it? No do i want it shure.
---
Happened to me as well
---
Ticket no: 191023-004249
---
It's also annoying as fuck in NW lobby.
---
This made me sad.  Good thing I can play Skyrim on my toaster!
---
"And nothing should interfere with the release of NPCs.."
---
Lol wut? Maybe from a players standpoint..but when you are a developer that's not how it works.
---
If there's someone dumb enough to buy a $7 fridge why wouldn't they think that no one would buy a $13 sub a month with 5 times the benifit.
---
They sold subs 
---
They know people will pay... I can't wait for it to get even worse for people like you
---
Yep, you just level up. No challenges for jumping through hoops involved. But like I said, if you're already a pretty high level all you need to do is complete one or so matches to unlock the rewards. Free loot!
---
Sure thing man, just upgrade to the newest 25$/month “invite only list” servers that they see you “asking” for.
---
What’s going on ?
---
I'm dead broke can't afford the pass unfortunately
---
Yeah I’m a low level since I never play NW but thanks for the information :)
---
Oh for sure I meant just give them the benefits of the private world stuff without the cosmetic stuff (atoms and the outfit) I should have been more clear lol
---
I've had my camp in the same location since day 1 and it has never been an issue until today.
---
Are... Are you calling me a Bethesda account?
---
What are the differences?
---
They weight so much less now too! Going to complete this whole set now that it's 10x lighter.
---
That sucks I was psyched for you there I thought I might have brightened your day a bit with a friendly neighbourhood game reminder. Sorry dude ❤️
---
Literally half of my online friends list were playing in private servers
---
Okay.
---
[Done!](https://imgur.com/a/PEl61cA)
---
Similar, going to try it out when my friends feel like playing again, if I like it, maybe stick around another month, if not, onto the next game again.
---
They are too.  I haven’t seen this many Bethesda troll accounts active at once in a while.
---
So what does the Samurai armor specs?
---
I personally wasnt that impressed after seeing some reviews already on it....looks like that will be lame after some hours also....many already said its linear.
---
True
---
Literally half of my online friends were playing in private servers when I checked earlier
---
I set up my camp to be super helpful to other players. No one but my friends are going to get to see my camp if I do private servers. Another reason for me not to pay the subscription. 
---
Again, this subscription is also putting features behind a pay wall that were standard in the older games. The biggest slap in the face of them all is the scrap box after they insisted that unlimited storage would break servers. Clearly that was a lie or the scrap boxes would, at the very least, be limited to only the private servers. 
---
Most of us don't have time to grind for atoms, which makes it even more of a slap in the face that I can get more bang for my buck in the Creation Club than I can in the Atom Shop.
---
I shouldn't have to switch servers to avoid griefers. I especially shouldn't have to pay in order to get on a server that I won't have to worry about eventually needing to leave because a griefer appeared. Instead, Bethesda should be showing griefers the door.
---
Put the ranger armor in the Atom Shop. Put the scrap boxes in the main game. Put the tents in the game behind a quest. Make the server cheaper, but require all in the server to have a membership. Then I'll consider buying a server for when I just want to play with friends only.
---
And this is why I can't wait for Friday's release of The Outer Worlds from Obsidian. It looms like fallout in space, but doesn't suck.
---
The problem is purely cosmetic microtransactions doesn't bring in the income needed to keep a game going. Selling a game at a one time price of $60 or $30 isn't going to sustain a game so developers are going to look for ways to make money. Cosmetics only isn't viable with a game like this, sure it might work with Fortnite that has millions and millions of players, but Fallout 76 isn't that type of game.
---
Ok
---
Camps can perfectly float.
---
Some techniques might have been fixed but you can drop a foundation part, then attach stairs to it, then build it all up higher, attaching floors to the stairs, walls to the floors, ect ect. Nothing about that is even glitching, follows perfectly the normal rules. It the game would have physics they might frown opon that, but no physics so it's all perfectly as intended.
---
Underground caps usually use cooking pot or something to warp in. They might eventually be fixed, but probably very low priority. As in the game doesn't allow leaving PA when it could glitch you through into somewhere where you can't walk in, you thus shouldn't be able to glitch through ground or walls or windows, when using workbench or cooking pot, either.
---
The overground portion might thus be quite low profile, if the player doesn't have vending machines and/or instructions on how to get inside the ground.
---
Much appreciated! Hopefully this at least reaches BGS to help them learn from their (massive)(fucking) mistakes.
---
Who here has actually felt disadvantaged from these supposed pay to win things Bethesda has added to the game such as the fridge, repair kits, and so on?
---
That data is locked behind a paywall
---
I'm not the one telling people to kill themselves over a videogame so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Also, players have received $60 worth of content at this point. The playable hours in the main story and side quests, without factoring in the free upcoming Wasteland DLC, is equivalent to the average $50-70 range game. Frankly, if you're looking for a well made game at the same original price point (but much lower now) with hundreds of hours of playable content, drop the multiplayer game and go pick up Witcher 3. Holds up to the test of time, well written, fewer bugs, and a more engaging storyline.
---
It's not that I'm a shill, it's that I don't buy a fucking Bethesda game expecting CD Project Red quality. If you think Fallout 76 is bad, go play The Evil Within or The Evil Within 2 (do not pay over $15 for either of these). 76 is a miraculous feat of engineering compared to some of those glitches.
---
If you want better quality coding, free content upgrades, and an agile development team able to quickly and competently respond to player issues, stop buying Bethesda games. They make fun-but-infuriating games. It's what they do. Accept it or put your money elsewhere because I've been playing Bethesda games for a long time and I don't see a single sign that they plan to change.
---
You dropped this \

I’d rather play metal gear survive.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks buddy. I love this game but all the stuff that "works" is never seen by Bethesda or truly understood why it works.
---
So,  buy a game, which is famous for single player PVE story and play. But instead they make a MMO style world full of bugs and glitches that after a year haven’t been fixed. Continuously force online grouping and events, then they charge you another $120 a year for a single player PVE game.
---
Explain this subscription bullshit. So I pay for PlayStation plus, but now a separate fee just to play this game? I don’t understand.
---
Look at ESO, it does this exact same thing. Exact same price. It is still the top 4 highest players mmos. When will this sub learn that they don't represent mojority of players?
---
I got game pass for 2 years for only $1...
---
Get out
---
So is that a reference to the people who feel they haven't got their $60 worth yet and think everything should keep being free till they feel like they've been made whole... or... is that a reference to all the people who refuse to leave the game (even if they're angry with it) because they have hundreds of hours and tens of dollars invested in the game already?
---
Until next year Q1. Just search Wastelanders delayed on Google
---
You’re a god. Thank-you for saying something.
---
Prob like most people didn't pay money. Also i saw you're camp last week! Was going to come by and ask about the water heater!
---
Average joes always celebrate their 15 min of fame....let em live lol.
---
The horse armour was the slippery slope.
---
It’s sadly better than what the modding community thinks is good looking NCR Armor. One a skinny glitchy suit and another a chunky mess.
---
100% agree. They better not throw that micro transaction shit in ES6
---
I never said budget changed like where do you even get the shit you spew out? As the post above stated you can place the camp down on private server and reload the servers on big town and run it multiple times by yourself for loot bring it into adventure mode and tada you automatically have a advantage over anyone. 
---
Oh and to restart a server just run yours then join a friends then rejoin yours and it’s reset. 
---
My point was you say it’s not pay to win but in fact it can be a pay to win.
---
It just came out but just wait till it start happening and it will. When have online games never been exploited /s
---
Pink
---
So......I’ve been able to replicate the issue and I lost a set of test junk here is what I did:
---
Force quitting while loading into adventure and then loading into a private server is what caused me to lose my junk a second time
---
lmao this is great.. also very true all ive gotten are shitendaries from all ive killed of em today
---
"For 22% of the cost of that entire game" if 22% of the cost of that other game is the $100 subscription fee then the full price would be $454.54,  I was taking the piss. Not being serious.
---
&gt;Approaching this from the same position I've always been in.
---
Sitting on the your couch in your underwear drinking a beer?
---
What pay to win advantages?
---
Yeah, well hopefully they expand the unlimited scrap for everyone.
---
Thank, fucking, you! I've been trying to say that shit since like December of last year, but everytime I say something, the downvote flood cometh.
---
I'm on Xbox so I can't help, but I'm upvoting any post that isn't about the fucking private server stuff. Bodily someone helps you.
---
A single bug ridden game by a developer I've now lost faith in? Yeah imma give that a hard pass on the $200+ a year price point. 
---
They announce this feature, and I'm betting we'll still see crash report posts about 1st world servers. Literal 1st world problems.
---
It honestly baffles me how people feel repair kits or a fridge are pay to win.
---
Mee too... But they have been numerous!
---
You mean that huge bridge fairly near? Or the small bridge IN Flatwoods?
---
No, ESO plus actually has content worthwhile.....FO76 is a wasteland as it states...thats for damn sure...literally.
---
Supposedly codes all 0s just goes to another area thats it. Someone talked about it earlier but havent tried it myself.
---
I was stationed at White Sands Missile Range for a bit, I loved the time I was in NM. Something peaceful about seeing sun set over the land there.
---
why? I mean, I don't know how many red flag you need to get it that they don't give a f\*\*\*... if you are still playing the game, that means they can still milk you. they are certainly not gonna get new players, so since it s all going down hill from here, they have no idea how many player will still be here next year. they probably gave up on the updates they promise, so they are making the best of it. a quick buck from the people most likely to pay (they have done it so far). that s pretty much the business plan of "life service" game : promises, lootbox, then pay to win, then max profit while the game die. it reduces development cost (promises don't cost anything), there is currently no regulation on keeping their "promises" and there is enough naive player to make it worthwhile (they call it whaling).
---
I think how they release ES6/Starfield will be very telling as to the direction the studio is going.
---
If multiplayer, or if it's a bare bones single player with supported multiplayer (and no substantial dlc); then we can kiss the games we once loved, goodbye. 
---
If they return to their roots, then they can keep me as a customer. But if it's more of this crap, I'm gone for the same reasons I didn't buy Anthem after bioware stopped working on ME:A.
---
Sounds like an enjoyable experience. Perhaps one that is out of this world.
---
Okay, yes. So long as everyone leaves your server,  a new one is generated
---
Haven't played in a while and was wanting to get back on, what is the subscription service you're talking about?
---
Lol I’m not a fucking Bethesda account, some people don’t whine about everything, there are bigger worries in life to think about, but sure put your energy into shit like this, if that’s the only worry you have in your life you must have it pretty easy.
---
Wow. Imagine someone just joining reddit a couple weeks ago. You mean not all reddit users were here from the start????? If you look at my posts I joined reddit for Hot Wheels and guns. Lmaooooo 🤣🤣
---
Yeah, true
---
ESO Plus gives access to all the DLC/Chapters
---
Oh jesus. The first time I ever heard about paying for something after already paying for the game. We were fucking OUTRAGED even though it was just a skin. Now look at the industry today. That seems so quaint looking back
---
Just logged back in after work, my tent was still there!
---
Its not glitched, it stashes the scrap perfectly. Now being able to access that scrap again will cost another 9.99 a month. You have a wallet, right?
---
Same shit. you get some free cash shop currency, unlimited stashes. They literally copied the model from ESO.
---
And no that's not true, you don't get all xpacs in ESO with +. In fact, you don't get ANY at all, just the extra "features" and some dungeons. They always charge full game for the real expacs like Morrowind, Elwsyre, Summerset.
---
Ok let's debate it.
---
Can't wait to see how Vault Raids go
---
I have never bought any with atoms all have come ingame, ive not workbench repaired in weeks.
---
Wont happen cause people are still buying shit...and they will for this sub shit also...for every 1000 that wont.... there are 1000 that will....welcome to business and the reality of it.
---
Shaddap
---
And it's $1 first month, $4.99 per month there after.  They'll send a message if the price ever changes.
---
I signed right the fuck up
---
For a resource game, this is a degree of pay to win. If we are looking at a scale, it's not the most egregious method.  But now I can hoard chems and drinks, drop all weight reduction perks, tighten my combat build because my junk freed up 700units.
---
I suspect the abysmal launch of 76 is the reason for all these cash grabs.
---
I could be wrong but I like to think if they just waited to launch and fixed the bugs (that the community fixed years ago.) More people would've bought it and a actually played it.
---
I'm so glad I was to broke at the time to buy it. Or I would've wasted so much money on it. I was drooling over that Power Armor Edition, and would've bought 2 if I could've. (I bought 2 Pip-Boy Edition)
---
It's possible that only 2 out of 24 bought the private server because you can invite up to 8 people. A lot of people bought it for one month just to see what it's about, the real question will be how many people find it worth paying for after the first month.
---
Thanks now I have to spend $73 instead of just $13.
---
Thats not true at all. Servers offer the owner more control over their game. Part of that being the ability to have a friend play in your world even if you are not on. What Bethesda is offering is typically free for other multiplayer games.
---
Thousands of people will...and they know that too.
---
I want an ammo scrapper in the atom shop... And also pc controls fixed. If i have to buy it then oh well.
---
Kind of sad, not even a dev in the comments to respond to this huge misguided way of dealing with a game that is already fully priced to own. 
---
This is by no means a f2p game and making people pay for convenience or visually different loot is more than just petty marketing. As I've said a month ago, this game shows more to cashing in than to honouring the player and if things keep going this way it's guaranteed Wasterlanders is going to be even worse.
---
Every few months, I forget how bad it is and I reinstall. And I regret it every time. The worst part is all the time wasted before realizing that it’s a piece of shit.
---
Just tried. You can't build near your camp. It makes the limit as double your camp radius, so you need some space from build areas.
---
I play. Bethedsa screwed the pooch.
---
Isnt the Euro stronger than the USD?
---
So they're basically just gouging Europeans for the fuck of it?
---
Yup...actual content.
---
I’ll buy their next single player only game. Vote with my wallet
---
Sorry you lost your stuff but thanks for detailing how you replicated it. You should repost this for exposure.
---
How so?
---
It's all good
---
It's $1 for a month trial. You get the outer worlds
---
How do you place the tent?
---
You. Are. Defending. Pay. 2. Win. Mechanics.
---
That is only the case if they give you control over said private server and its functions and settings. On a user end, it would be basically the same.
---
Bethesda stopped giving a shit about what its players want when they tried to do paid mods with zero oversight while taking a cut that would make Tim Sweeney lose his damn mind about "revenue share" and required the mod to surpass a significant paywall before modders saw any money.
---
The slippery slope fallacy is only a fallacy when there isn't circumstantial evidence to support it. Unfortunately for all of us, Bethesda proves the point of why consumers need to get a damn spine on a near monthly basis now. At least you know now though. Man, Elder Scrolls 6 is going to fuckin *suuuuck* at this rate.
---
Any of the posts I've created over the last 10 months with constructive criticism never seem to gain traction. I've laid out lengthy plans for faction content, survival content, endgame content, etc that just get pushed down due to all the "Bethesda Please" posts and the "met the love of my life on FO76" posts. 
---
Lots of great redditors have contributed to this subreddit and a franchise they love. Bethesda needs to really listen and not just run with what they want to hear. 
---
Just my 2 caps...
---
How often do you buy atoms
---
Well, there's the [EU's law on fair terms](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/unfair-treatment/unfair-contract-terms/indexamp_en.htm) and [in the US it just largely depends on the veracity of the claim, which court you're in, and which judge you have.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement)
---
When it comes to something like false advertising, that's illegal regardless of EULA and can be prosecuted as such. See: Colonial Marines.
---
I have quite a few of them but I have never bought any, I guess they drop with certain events? Other than that I just workbench repair.
---
I don't want to say you deserved it, but...
---
This has gotta be a pr employee for Bethesda
---
Awesome
---
Yes, because it's that simple..... It's not like there needs to be board meetings within Zenimax to makes choices with the future of the game and decide on major changes. It's not like those sort of things are then talked about in meetings with managers, PR team, developers at BGS. Then once it's decided upon, it's not like theres meetings between creative teams to decide art direction. Relay the information. Artists need to work. Programmers need to code. Teams need to create assets.
---
If you honestly think a decision as big as this would be made and executed within a week. Then you're about as smart as the Bethesda P.R. team.
---
Someone suggested that I download the Xbox (beta) app but it’s also locked behind the latest version. If you’re gonna force people to have the latest version it needs to be nearly guaranteed that it can be updated....
---
It just happened to a buddy of mine. He lost all his vault 94 steel. Days of raid grinding for the steel. Just up and gone, best of luck to you.
---
Which nearly all games that offer such a service do.
---
Check the atom shop or you’ll have to make it
---
I'd be happy to join
---
to be fair i've already been doing that with my normal camp i have a blueprint with the essentials packed into a small shack and when ever i'm over encumbered i find a place nearby to put my camp down and the scrap and stash my shit
---
Honestly you just get a mini camp and a robot dance and can hold more scrap. I still suck at playing. Lol.
---
Are you also on Xbox?
---
Thanks. Yeah. Luckily, I did not store my vault steel. Did he do the same thing or something different? 
---
That sucks.
---
Go to atomic after purchase of fallout 1st. A new tab will be available with free items.
---
I've bounded back and forth between public and private on 3 different characters and haven't lost shit. Not trying to diminish your experience, but it's not universal.
---
Does this move actually make them lower than EA at this point?
---
It was fixed in the previous patch if current patch didn’t break it then it’s fixed
---
Select from atom store apparel. 
---
Craft outfit - 
---
Craft headgear. 
---
Enjoy!
---
As an interesting note I just picked up heavy metal torso plans from lode bearing.   Is this new or has it always been a chance?
---
That’s what you get for being a dumb dumb 🤷‍♀️
---
Many are probably like me. Love the franchise, bought the game at some point, had a few hours of fun and are still hoping BGS gets their crap together. Thus are here when something gets announced.   
---
I would love to like the game more. There is some solid foundation hidden in there, but nothing changes. Each time i logged in it was still a buggy mess. Each time i still had disconnects (not from my connection, rather server crashes), health bars would regen or events don't work and a whole bunch of little things here and there.   
---
That isn't even touching on stuff they should improve like UI is still barely useable, gunplay/movement still feels bad, perks are still largely uninteresting. And every time i log in for some event they don't even bother to guide me towards it. What is up with that?   
---
So in general i had hopes, but i am reminded that it is only downhill. And no - i will not stick around and the sub can go back to the lovely echo chamber it usually is. I am just here to remind BGS that they had at some point more people that cared but lost as paying customers.
---
That's fuckin pathetic lol.
---
Do they?
---
I cant find it! Help
---
I mean you already spent $60. You lose either way.
---
Open your favorites wheel. There’s a new option on the bottom of the screen with the “1st” logo next to it. On Xbox it’s the Y button.
---
I'll be joining up later
---
No. The game is still shit and now, there's a subscription model and no roadmap for next year.
---
Comes with the ranger armour from fallout new Vegas, you know that game Bethesda didn't develop.
---
Horse Armor
---
Yes, Timmy, I AM just gonna leave that there.
---
Aw man. That’s gonna cost a whole $5 to replace.
---
Y’all can stay here and hate the game together lol
---
I don't know..maybe
---
Pathetic.
---
Sure did, got it with the atoms from the sub. It's awesome, actually comes with a lot of cool stuff. The smoke machine shoots bats out too lol.
---
Just in general Bethesda as whole has been struggling. Their recent games have been complete shit shows. Or really underperformed in general sales regardless if they were good (Dishonored 2, Evil Within 2 and a few other titles). Other game devs are showing up and eating Bethesda Game Studios lunch. Witcher 3, Outer Worlds, to name a few have taken what BGS used to be top dogs at and blew them out of the water tenfold. BGS is honestly laughable at this point and Bethesda isn't looking so hot as a whole company. Doesn't mean I don't love their games, but I am being realistic here.
---
I played had since beta
---
Some of your friend's friend probably joined the private server and killed the ants and deathclaw.
---
They should have put a password to join the private server or asking for the owner permission to join.
---
I completely agree with this. I don't have a problem with season passes but you have to have the content available to show like your money is well spent, not having any expansion in the first year of release is a massive blunder, adding a season pass to that just makes you look really bad.
---
You and me both buddy
---
They delayed the only thing bad people interested while they pushed and extremely overpriced subscription on people
---
I was on the small bridge near Flatwoods.  It's not like I was blocking anything or close to anything too special, the closest important item I could find was Sophie's corpse, and my camp was nowhere near close enough to affect her.
---
Lmao I love how even months after 76 has released you people are still licking the boots of this shit-tier company
---
"Boom. Pay us." -the Toddster
---
Copy other companies like they did with the dialogue in fallout 4.
---
You go stick all your lovely scrap in your new shiny scrapbox yet?
---
Nope, same thing you did, I just remembered. We were mid raid and another buddy crashed. We decided to stop the raid, and he was going to make his own private server but loaded into adventure by accident. Then when he loaded into his own private server as we joined him, his stuff was gone.
---
You paid for the apartment agreeing to a fully functional living situation. 
---
Then you learning only one light socket works 
---
Then you learned the pipes could only handle half a gallon of water a day 
---
Then you learned there was no parking 
---
Then you noticed the millions of roaches and every time they tried to kill a few, more spawned. 
---
Then when it came time for them to deliver on previously agreed upon terms, they only fixed one light and called it good. 
---
Then you were told you had to pay 1/3 of the apartments price each month extra to get very basic amenities and if you didn't, you'd just have to suffer.
---
Welcome to Reddit lol.
---
What did Bethesda do?
---
You are a pathetic piece of shill shit. And you are disadvantaged if your job is being a shill on reddit so you have my pity.
---
You need to enable the 4k content on your settings because the game is around 40gb on the X.
---
Get lost, Oxhorn.
---
Destiny is trash too though...most of the enemies look the same and its boring as shit after an hour or two.
---
Yeah dude, that poor multi-million dollar corporation can’t even keep the lights on 😔
---
Had hope I guess
---
Considering how they fucked up to implement a single weekly challenge (or was it daily?) that was actually based on counting scorched mob kills a week (or so) prior to this community event...
---
Perhaps there is some more technical reason behind it, but the way I see it, aren't all of the items in the game just visual assets in the game anyway? If you put them in to a box, doesn't it then just become text? It's not like you're physically putting real items in to a real box, but that seems to be how they're treating it...
---
Seen someone saying to check your regular stash there stuff was put back in their old stash box.
---
High rads low health is a bloodied build. It's the meta build that most high level players use. Bloodied weapons do 100% damage when you're at 20% health and Nerd Rage gives you a huge buff at or below 20% so high rads keeps your health from going above 20%. As a Bloodied build I don't use stimpaks at all so that's probably why he had so many to give you.
---
That was generous of you to notice his situation and offer help though.
---
Too bad lfinding out that is boring as fucking shit sentence done by computer holotapes and stupid ass robot nobody gives a solid fuck about
---
Welp, I've been needing to free up storage space on my PS4 anyway.  It's sad, how long I defended this game.  I got my money's worth but it has been a downward slope for this game, which is amazing because the release was incredibly botched to begin with.  I've been a huge Elder Scrolls and Fallout fan, but this will be my last Bethesda game.
---
Hmmmm, I feel like you either play it for a very very different than most people, or just haven't really played it at all 😂, but to each their own
---
Yep, real PIA.
---
its actually quite sad. Outer worlds is looking promising and hopefully takes my mind off 76 lmao. i dont want to be that guy but...."maybe they can make 76" better" 🤣🤣
---
Try the Brotherhood of Steel vendor inside Whitesprings. It's the one with bear rug in the store. As far as the weapon mods, you'll have to scrap to learn one and get the heated plan for the other. Census Violence is also a quest the power fist can drop from.
---
Hmmmm, I feel like you either play it for a very very different reason than most people, or just haven't really played it at all 😂, but to each their own
---
Let’s hope they get it together with their new single player games
---
No I'm at work, but will be later
---
You will die to an avalanche of my junk.
---
K
---
Same here. And I do have my problems with certain aspects of the game. However i do not see the issue of private servers being pay to win or dollar squeezing. An MMORPG with private servers usually charge a fee to have that server.
---
This guy works for Bethesda for sure.
---
I don't know, not dealing with randoms ruining events like One Violent Night and not having to manage people to make sure everyone tags the legendary is a lot more fun.
---
Agreed. Everyone I see complain have always complained and don’t play. I spend at least $10 a month on atoms. This is a deal!
---
Plus knowing how short Outer Worlds is... I’m going to wait until it is on sale and don’t mind putting money into where I actually play.
---
Seriously dude, in games like Ark and Minecraft you can have your own private worlds *for free*
---
Had it and used it once, can no longer find it.  Sorry
---
I try to keep my shit together like weapons together and armor together and junk.... going to be impossible now
---
Damn... all those vault steels.
---
I'm really lost, did Bethesda even try to test this thing before it went live... they had so much time to test this during the project clean appalachia.
---
(Y) Shame
---
This game has been a joke from the start, so why stop now? Lets keep those Memes a coming!
---
By offering unlimited junk stash and a smaller camp as a pay only feature. Think about how much ammo materials you can gather and then go back to the regular game and use it as currency. AFAIK there is no max limit to ammo like there is caps. Charging 13 bucks a month for a world, not an actual server, where all your stuff disappears when you leave is absoulty absurd IMO.
---
Hahaha, they found a way to mobilize private servers.   Thank God for Obsidian.  Friday can’t come fast enough.
---
Load it up my dude.
---
Since no one else is posting the link. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMF5wSmQkDY), for the interested.
---
Eh, even then, tons of DLC that should've been in the main game.
---
I really wanted to like 76, I put in many hours trying to, but this has just ruined it completely for me. I preordered the tricentennial edition and feel completely ripped off by it.
---
You elitiests. Too good to play on the same servers as us now to good for this sub. Enjoy hiding behind your solid gold gates.
---
Enjoying a game makes one a boot licker? Pretty big brain you've got there.
---
Nah man just annoyed by the posts really.
---
I've been doing them for a month and a half now and haven't had anything bad happen to myself or any teammates.
---
Hello Bethesda employee!
---
Here's a thought, just don't buy the subscription.  God knows I won't.
---
me too, im a huge fallout fan but I think its time to move on till fallout 5
---
Negative.
---
Which you just accept like the shill you are
---
So do many other game subscriptions...not defending them...but some of you need to get out from under that rock and take a look around into the gaming world. ESO is 15 a month alone.
---
Genuine question, how are you having fun in this game? I’ve played since the beta, but I stopped playing a lot in like February. Now I can’t even hop on for 10 minutes without being bored.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  
---
The game was unhealthy the day it was "released".
---
At this point, if Todd promises something, I treat that as confirmation that it absolutely is *not* coming. He promises big and **never** delivers (radiant AI, Skyrim’s radiant world, free DLC for FO76. The list just goes on and on). I don’t think he’s ever honestly advertised or hyped up a game.
---
Me, during the now infamous e3 presentation: "By Todd, I will break my rule on preordering for es6." Me tonight: "I'll pirate ES6 if and only if, I'm not disgusted by its mtx."
---
At least we have a lead, private server, force quit, adventure, private server, scrapbox junk gone. Sounds familiar, like the players who lost all their stuff when they accidentally loaded into adventure after crashing in the raid.
---
Every time I build a new camp it is always better than the last one. Your next one will be even more amazing. If you are on PC and want some help, let me know. I love building.
---
Ladies and gentlemen we got em
---
That’s why I placed my camp literally in the middle of nowhere. I’m in the furthest south section of the savage divide. Pretty far from any locations, didn’t wanna take the risk.
---
I'm not an expert on their engine, but from what I've been told from regular modders is that each unique item consumes a chunk of table space...this the mats are a very simple entry with a quantity value associated with it,  taking very little memory to hold. Weapons, armor and other items hold a lot more descriptive attributes, all of which are contained within the object loaded into memory.  Those properties add up quick. This is what,at least partially, people harp on when they say the engine is old and needs to be redone. The methodology used for object storage is rather antiquated.
---
I’m gay, he’s rich... I guess I missed where I lose here.
---
I really hope that Wastelanders comes out strong, because if not I don't think there's gonna be any good faith left for Bethesda.
---
Yeah
---
tbh though this pricing difference between the US and Europe is related to taxes
---
Are you guys that poor?
---
I bet. I don't even do uranium fever or OVN because I'm a Bloodied sniper and don't carry tagging weapons. I usually just go and do my Whitesprings lap while everyone is at events.
---
I'm not sure that is worth $13 a month though. I could get a good steak for $13 and that's probably a lot better than a months worth of level 40 scrip.
---
Can't get worse. I will only be checking out new holidays and Wastelanders. They can't hurt me till then. A lot of people are getting fed up with big devs atm and its showing. You can buy 6 years for all i care. Good for you, your money. That said, doesn't mean i can't mock you for foolish choices. Honestly. I wish you all the best and hope all your legendaries are always 3\*s; but also honestly. I don't think you realize the message are trying to put out to corporations in general atm. You don't own us and you can't make up all the rules. So enjoy your private server. Should honestly be really cool and fun. Its your money to spend, its not that i can't afford it. It's that i don't value my money and my time so little.
---
There is one important factor that makes having more stash an advantage, and that is when it comes to sprinting, and additionally Cavalier armor. I'm personally overburdened a lot. My stash is taken up by mostly junk. Having that much free space would mean I could sprint and do more power attacks etc. in PvP. So it would be an advantage, to have, or disadvantage to not have it. As for the tent, the only advantage that serves is not having to spend caps to fast travel. Minor if anything really, as nice as that would be.
---
I only got like 10% of my original stuff
---
Anyone who isn't in their own server will say 'visiting private' instead of 'private' by their name in social just seen this tonight as I thought it was sharing a bit too much information, but interesting none the less.
---
Not even a private server, it's a private session, something that should be free. Lets not forget they didn't bother to say anything about future support for the game past wastelanders which got delayed for this.
---
Thanks for sharing, the first line already got me
---
Yes. Come have fun.
---
Eh games have always released full of bugs then patched. Even fallout 2
---
8-10? you mean free? lmao
---
Dumbasses bought the subscription and the scrap box is bugged. It deletes all scrap inserted.
---
You fucking idiots paid for Bethesda to delete your items.
---
This game has to be an experiment as to what Bethesda can get away with. You guys are borderline non-functioning. Holy shit.
---
Very True. Premium membership to a game that lacks content and still alot of bugs is not a good move. 
---
ESO did premium membership and nobody cared, they were actually happy. Because that game had been out for even longer, was much cleaner in term of bugs, multiple large DLCs, and a better premium membership package.
---
&gt;The ark thing is bullshit. You can run it without a sub sure, but you’re severely gimped. At least that’s how it is on xbox.
---
yeah with consoles you are stuck with that i guess. a friend ran a server for a year for us for around 20 or so peeps on pc and it didnt cost him a thing since he had a rad connection already and spare rig to host it 24/7 lag free. 
---
&gt;And yes, yes i am “peeved”
---
I appreciate your opinions and you made me think about it differently on a few points. don't want to tell ya how to live life and all but think you might be taking what random crap people say online little too much to heart. 
---
we can't help what we like in life and i hate it when people shit talk stuff i like, but i've learned its a waste of my own time and energy to let the bad energy that people put out there to effect me so. hope the game shapes up for people that still love the game like you, but for me im just going to close this chapter and move on.
---
keep on truckin man and gl out there in that wasteland.
---
I will die happy to be killed by that much valuable stuff
---
Yikes. Bad luck! I played a couple hours earlier today, maybe I just got lucky :p
---

---
This is assuming that the spawns are guaranteed on a new server start right? i don't know if the loot rolls are known or not on how they work exactly. I know that when an armor spawns its armor pieces are selected with randomness, and are influenced by level, but wile the locations they spawn are static, they may just be a roll to see if a PA is even created upon entering the cell in the first place.
---
not at all happy about the subscription, but my disappointment bottomed out long ago, i am just here with the popcorn, but even still, no need to hate for the wrong reasons. there could be an explanation.
---
I force quit while loading into a adventure server when I had meant to join a private server.
---
I force quit (dashborded) &amp; joined a private server and it was gone. I would assume that force quitting while joining a private and then joining a public server would have the same result.
---
I tried dash-boarding while in a server &amp; that did not result in me losing junk. It seemed to only be force quitting while I was loading into a server &amp; then joining another server that caused it.
---
Hey! Diet coke all right. I don't like to drink calories
---
What? 15$ Power Armor skins ..
---
Looks like I’m getting game pass. Outer worlds.
---
I hear you on company policy, I really do, but the issue is that they aren’t consistent with the implementation of their rules.  American HS players speak out against Chinese rule of HK?  No repercussions.  Members of the LGBT community use their success as a means to share political beliefs?  No repercussions (to clarify, I’m more than fine with this).  HK HS player speaks out?  Shitstorm,  AND they don’t apologize, AND they defend their decision on their official Weibo account
---
What genre is this game?
---
Then why are you commenting, you have no idea &amp; are more of a sheep for jumping on the hate train.
---
Play the game at least before offering your opinion.
---
I'm surprised your the only one so far
---
Is the lobster trap helmet in the game??
---
Of course no. But why starting the same thing as fallout with a new universe???
---
Plus, i have already over 10+ games featuring space/futuristic universes
---
They may be preparing to add new content to your old CAMP location. It's hard to loose your work but your camp should be blueprinted and saved. It might be hard to find a new location that will let you place it though.
---
It sounds like Bethesda has purged Flatwoods of several buildable player CAMP locations then. I started a new camp for my Flatwoods character already. He was an alternate so I wasn't too sad to see his camp go. I'm going to look around the old location when I have a chance to see if there are any changes or signs of new content.
---
What do you mean? Isn’t it like RPG and mostly PVE?
---
Why yes?
---
I’m so happy that Outerworlds is coming out tomorrow and I never touched this trash game once.
---
Tbh usually it’s just executives who only care about their yearly bonus, if things hit the fan they can leave and find work elsewhere for the most part, just an unfortunate reality
---
Very true. But it seems they have taken the reputation damage and said F\* it. Like if you get hanged for stealing a penny, why not rob a bank kind of thing.
---
Of course not, They are reporting our issues with Fallout 1st to the Dev Team.
---
They brought back the vampire costume. and they're giving us free outfits with the new event coming tomorrow as rewards, and the five costumes for participating in NW, like a glowing skellyton costume. Aren't free costumes better?
---
That's what am afraid of. I broke down 500pds of bulk and put it in there. My stash has 200pds on it but the scrap broke down was more then 800pds alone. The stash box can't go over 800pds so I'm assuming it's deleting what it can't fit in the old box?
---
I've no idea I logged off before I knew the issue.
---
Also it doesn't take bulk so if you had bulk you should still have it.
---
There is no such thing as bad publicity.
---
Shame people won't be around for the vault by then.
---
To keep, or rent while subbing?
---
That dude is a legend
---
It'll be over in like 2 days.
---
I'm your huckleberry.
---
Can you boycott someone if you already don't give them any money?
---
I scrapped the bulk 😟
---
Yeah they really need to knock it out of the park. Adding NPCs and making the game feel closer in line to previous Bethesda Fallout games has so much potential going forward, but if they fuck it up it could be the final nail in the coffin of this game.
---
I don't even think todd was even involved in this game. Remember he's in maryland and 76 was developed by the folks at texas (i think) . They just brought todd out to hype the game and sell us some sweet little lies. I really hope none of this detracts starfield and elder scrolls.
---
If the current patch didn’t break it lol.
---
It would be nice to have Fallout game similar to ESO, even though I couldn't get into ESO, partially because I waited to long, I liked the idea of it.
---
Okay well the right to freely abuse it should die
---
Let’s assume I have a private server and you don’t. We both want to craft 5.56 ammo. We both need the same amount of lead, steel and gunpowder. Now, it’s true that I can store more lead and steel in my scrap box but the only thing that affects is the scheduling mix of farming and playing. In order for me to craft 5 times the ammo you can, I need to farm 5 times as much. All that means is that I can go longer between farming sessions but it doesn’t change the amount of time it takes to do the farming.
---
oh geez, I forgot about that sub. They left the 76 sub because it wasn't enough of a circlejerk for them, lol.
---
Because it’s a premium price, but does not offer premium service.
---
Oh dude you are future me 😓
---
As long as you continue paying for the pass, you'll be able to play tow
---
&gt;Most games go without making money for 5-10 years under their parent companies and then release a product and start making money.
---
That's risky. Some companies might want to take such risks. Larger ones won't.
---
"That's not a bug, that's a feature"
---
No but really I want my nuka backpack and my new vegas ranger armour, the bug was neat for about 30 seconds but c'mon I dropped money I had to work really hard for.
---
I truly do agree, we'd still have complaints but not the flood we currently have.
---
Fallout: New Vegas is a beautiful game when modded. Fallout 4 is a beautiful game when modded. Fallout 76 is trash because of P2W Macrotransactions and scummy tactics.
---
That dank EA kush
---
Coming from the galaxy brains who defend a company like Bethesda who continually shits on the player base and treats them as walking wallets lmao
---
I honestly can’t believe the Fallout license went to these hacks. What a waste.
---
Maybe buy a game that the devs actually care about next time if you don’t like the communities feedback
---
Yeah thats what i mean, i guess they worded ot as worlds and not servers which could mean whatever they wanted really
---
Can you join someone’s private server if you aren’t a member and use the scrap box as part of a team?
---
I love it
---
I know, I'm only playing because I'm trying to get ready for the Halloween event, since wastelanders got delayed, too bad they can't release part of it now, since its not a story problem they are having
---
Not at all. What you're talking about is hurting someone and what Bethesda is doing isnt hurting anyone
---
People are scared right now. No one wants to admit buying anything lol.
---
How much of a bank is left to rob?
---
Self regulation rarely works in reality.
---
It's the thought that counts. I'm sure he got a chuckle out of it and you probably helped him clear out some stash space with those 60 stimpaks, I end up with tons of them and sell them to vendors for caps. No doubt at level 30 you need them more than him.
---
😮 I believe he did the same thing! He said "woops, that's  adventure, meant to go private" and force quit halfway thru the load into adventure. When he loaded back into private, his stuff was gone!
---
Expecting them to run private servers for all the players for free, is beyond ridiculous, it would bankrupt them.
---
$13 a month is less than most server hosting sites,  plus those sites dont give anything beyond the server.
---
$100 a year is also less than most server hosting sites.
---
Like I probably wont buy it because I dont care about playing with others but I really dont see what people are so mad when they're asking less than standard fare.
---
Nothing sparks interesting conversation like WRONG.
---
Which is so dumb, because people would be more willing to pay for the subscription if the game had more content
---
Shills gonna shill
---
It's sad that I can see that happening, but it would be nice if they made it free to play and then gave the early adopters it for free for a year, then maybe after, having deals with Xbox live and PlayStation plus memberships, since they are a must to even play the game
---
&gt;But corporations are not people. They don't feel. They don't care. They only want your money and anything they can get away with they will do. Every time people go "Eh, it could be worse" they have won more ground.
---
^ this !!!
---
Hey, you're entitled to your own opinion. But there were 2 massive chunks of dlc that came out in a year, so I believe that your claim is a little unfair. I'm comparing this game to Battlefield because it also has rentable servers, not because of the quality of the game. Of course, you're not forced to get the subscription, but I'm saying that this subscription pays out more than renting a server on some other games.
---
fuck you and fuck your cringe "award" edits.
---
ARK and Minecraft are perfect examples. Those have Private servers NOT private worlds. There is an actual persistent server that remains online all the time. There is value in that. GTA don't charge extra for private lobbies. It isn't a server that is dedicated to you. When it becomes empty it's gone. So why charge for it? So they don't.
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give for this comment.
---
Smoke machine is good. Vendor has new music. The pumpkins have a light animation, but are considered floor decor so don't take up much camp budget. And it's seems that the pumpkins that will unlockable from the event don't have the light effect.
---
However, the other decorations are lame. It's literally the same assets from fallout 4. Im a bit disappointed in Bethesda. I was truly hoping for some kind animated prop (like the Santa at Christmas), maybe some kind of radio to play spooky sounds/music. Maybe some new lights. Flashing pumpkin/skeleton/Halloween neons. And definitely a good pack Halloween props/furniture for the camp much like mothman camp set was filled with.
---
Same
---
Why?
---
Personally posted a lot about the bs claim of stash hurting servers with small things like junk and lots of people whine 33 items was a lot but now a lot see the bs now.
---
I don't get how so many people think that it is about entitlement or the money. When supporting monetization like this, they support worse game design (in the future). Cosmetic unlocks are already cut out in most games for seperate selling, many systems are designed to be more tedious and we are well on our way to have most convenience features sold as well. I am still waiting for the UI redesign being sold...  
---
In Fallouts case the most obvious one: the core gameplay loop of scavenging, using up durability, repair. It is not a single feature they introduced, but the combined thing of passively getting scrap, repair kits and now unlimited scrapstorage. Which by the way also saves TONS of time of inventory management or consideration what to take with you.
---
I will keep playing the game, because I like it. But I won't buy any MTX.
---
Finally a comment that I was expecting
---
Unfortunately the vast majority of players do not have the hardware to host their own and they have to think of them instead of the few.
---
I did, played a while at a friends house, it was trash filled with bugs, I didn't even install on my PC.
---
I feel bad for people who got hooked on this.
---
Stop being broke, mow a lawn or two.
---
Some things are exclusive to the bundle unfortunately like the fog machine
---
Oh yea definitely there would definitely be some grumbling, that would be unavoidable. This was a very poor maneuver on their end.
---
Are you Bethesda?
---
You act like ES6 / FO5 won't sell like fucking gangbusters.
---
Even the most vocal "Fuck Bethe$da!!!" critic will buy that shit on day 1...
---
Absolutely number 2
---
I just bought it from Walmart for $16
---
No. Its not "we all". Some are upset, some are enjoying the content, and the majority of casual players dont seem to care either way. You dont speak for everyone.
---
Woah what? I didn’t see this... I want to find a video of it
---
Quiet kid you’re giving it away
---
That was always shit. You think 8000 objects crashes a server of a full world? Dude come on. You could hoard shit in older games
---
*The Outer Worlds* is made by the original creators of the Fallout franchise and the developers of *Fallout: New Vegas*. 
---
You’re absolutely right they are not rivals. *The Outer Worlds* is what everyone who supported this franchise has supported this entire time, not this paid to finish developing garbage.
---
The value of this compared to other things that are far better for cheaper. Who do Bethesda think they are?
---
Urban mask looks Forest in the armor workbench if you go to the Paint option
---
What a shame,
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Something worth thinking about; there's every chance now that, like the Ranger Armor, Wastelanders is going to be locked behind this new paywall. Why else make sure the subscription service was live before Wastlanders was released?
---
True that. Just annoying as shit
---
They literally released Shivering Isles for a decent price about a week earlier, and that is largely regarded as one of the best add-on content packs ever created and value for its price.
---
Microsoft charged something like 10k\~ish at the time to publish an update for any game as well, so they had to patch the base game with the patch included the DLC (although the horse armor dlc didn't have any patch) , so it's not like its some bullshit excuse, microsoft convinced them to charge more and they listened; in fact many other companies at the time have similar stories and being forced to charge for updates.
---
Lastly I don't think of any company as my friend, especially Bethesda, but I don't like people lying and saying Bethesda invested microtransactions (seriously there is enough legit stuff to get pissed at them for), and I hate how everyone forgets about old Microsoft/X-box before the new CEO took over.
---
What makes it an rpg? All games have pve.
---
"Whales"... what a dehumanizing term. Scumbags.
---
They've already said, they were going to be just like the non private servers during this trail period and would allow changes and mods later. This isn't news.
---
*some* people wont be around for the vault by then
---
The website is hacked http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
And those people are fucking morons that ruin shit for everyone else.
---
If I could cancel it on PS4 I would do so only so I could have the NCR Ranger outfit
---
Why choose? There's more than enough blame to go around.
---
Is that really what it looks like?
---
RPG = Role Playing Game, which is like open world, which is what fallout 76 is. Unless I’m wrong.
---
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Hold this L, you clowns. No matter where you go, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, hell fucking club penguin would’ve ratio’d you.
---
Sure, people might buy it on day 1. But by month 1 if Bethesda doesn't change their attitude then the playerbase likely will do a repeat F76.
---
Wow they really just did a copy paste on this lads idea. WOW!! It bugs me that a friend of mine got this subscription
---
Fuck, that'd cover an entire year...
---
Or eat a few less happy meals
---
Because when you pay there will be a max of 7 players not 25.... like it's not hard to understand if you're not looking for reasons to be butthurt.
---
I mean it costs more than amazon prime, Hulu and Netflix.
---
For one game. That you already paid for. That still isn’t fixed and has barely any new content.
---
They have put 5 years of updates into their other cash cow side project, elder scrolls online. You know the one that had a bug ridden, imbalanced mess of a launch, with little content, a terrible endgame progression system, and dull combat, but is now considered one of the best MMOs ever made.
---
Dude your crazy if you believe there won't be.
---
Fallout has been in as high regard as a franchise since old TES. Its just that the first company was horrible with money.
---
If they did it to Fallout you best believe they will do it for TES.
---
Ya sure, why not, buy the game for a fraction of the price and know that if you want to get the full experience you’ll be paying $100 a year at a minimum.  Good luck.
---
you can buy just the vending machine skin. 500 atoms, though.
---
1. Work at BGS Austin. 
---
2. Write shitty code on top of inherited shitty code.
---
3. Profit!
---
Seriously?
---
What i really want to know is how is the lag/server performance ?
---
I know, and I got my head chew off by ppl saying it wasn't, I wonder what their excuse is going to be now lol
---
Also upgrades your remaining Xbox live to game pass as well. I had 11 months until my next Xbox live payment, bought game pass for $1 and now I have 11 months of that as well. Pretty damn good deal
---
You've been saying you were done for month. Leave or shut up.
---
I'm not in it myself, but I work on bigger mod projects with people that are.   
---
Apparently the pay is generous enough - You get paid installments by milestone.   
---
Apparently some folks have made enough through these milestones that they've been able to cover their living costs for a while.
---
Seriously. This whole thing just boggles my mind. They obviously have the ability to give players an actual private server/world making it an effectively single player experience but they choose not to. Does Fallout 76 really need this much money?
---
I already have an absurd ammount of ammo. My buddy has a camp with a lead extractor.  I have over 8k rounds for the 3 main weapons i use. And as far the fast travel is concerned I have yet to run out of caps for fast travel as well as if you play with a team you potentially have 5 fast travel points.
---
You think this sub understands objectivity?
---
I enjoy the game and 13 bucks isn't much money to me. The subscription is completely optional. I don't get all the animosity about something one could simply not pay for. The game is still the same without the subscription.
---
I tried for a little over an hour. It happened 4 times total. I just gave up
---
People who know a lot more than you or I based on playerbase behavioral analytics have surely done the math and determined the money made here will still net a sizable profit without affecting future sales enough to cause concern.
---
I'd rather have died in the nuclear fire than survive in this shit
---
I'd rather not buy the game that forces you to use Chinese spyware to download.....
---
Hm. Okay fair. I guess the next best question is, will the fan base stick around that long for it? Again, asking thoughts not trolling.
---
I will say having your stuff disappear is bullshit and needs to be patched.
---
Well apparently some people are buying it, so I don't know. I'm even tempted because some of those items are nice, at least for 1 month. But no I won't support it. I can do without some outfit, tent and unlimited junk stash. I have plenty of other games to play, by the way Satisfactory is an amazing game. That is how a game should be with early access. It's a lot of fun and very well made. Unlike the Paradox game released early access recently called Surviving the Aftermath which is so early in development it looks like it's just a cash grab, and ends at a dead end after building everything available with no way to produce certain items needed and resources just dry up. I can't recommend Satisfactory enough, if you like Factorio, it's like that but in a beautiful 3d world. Very addictive and progress is smooth. And Outer Worlds in a few days. I can't see why people would spend more on 76 after all of the BS, when there are so many good games out there and coming out soon that don't treat their customers like crap.
---
I agree...but most people forget how things actually work. For every 1000 people bitching on the internet and not buying...there are 1000 praising it and buying....that reality will never change in the world of business. Unless something catastrophic happens...and this is what id consider fucked up....but not catastrophic. Being harmed and being pissed off are two different categories of damages.
---
Was just thinking this. It almost certainly will be.
---
You better want that membership, because dollars to donuts, Wastlanders is going to be locked behind that pay wall.
---
I read that I'm Tennessee Ernie Ford's voice.
---
That's just the base comment. To unlock the whole comment, pay up.
---
Yup. Looks straight from New Vegas xD
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Well then you your personal definition is just wrong. So I'm done arguing with someone that can't criticize a product they like.
---
You are, but that’s okay. Have fun. 👌🏼
---
To be fair, it IS very scary.
---
So Halloween successful for Bethesda?
---
Fallout 1st is a subscription service for a game
---
That still
---
Costs
---
[MONEH](https://i.redd.it/n7kb9c4ac0321.jpg)
---
Let that sink in

The game STILL costs money to buy into in the first place - that's ON TOP of the subscription. DESPITE delaying the patch with the stuff the community ACTUALLY wants (npcs, proper quests, new adventures etc) Bethesda APPARENTLY thinks that the foundation of Fallout 76 was good enough to now add a SUPPLEMENTARY subscription to the game
---
A game, I remind, that while DIFFERENT from what it was at launch - is also MUCH WORSE in other ways. 
---
And this SUBSCRIPTION?!
---
[Let's talk about the cost](https://i.gifer.com/TBSw.gif)
---
Is MORE than PlayStation Now AND XBox Games Pass.
---
MORE than XBox games pass which GIVES you - fucking GIVES you - access to dozens of modern games. Included - but not limited to - NEW sixty dollar releases. XBox Games Pass is Nine. Ninety. Nine a month.
---
That is LESS than 'exclusive' serves and a iconic outfit that fans have been clamoring for since launch.
---
PlayStation Now gives you access to HUNDREDS of games - HUNDREDS. And it is 9.99 a month. 
---
The lowest level of Google Statida - at launch - will contain more content and ALSO cost less than this subscription service... ... ... 
---
People are mad because Bethesda isn't just taking the piss - they're fucking CHUGGING the piss and shitting in the helmet of an ICONIC outfit that you don't get because you're a pleb. 
---
They not only have broken their word concerning not walling off content behind money - but they're breaking their word concerning offline play and private worlds. Remember that? Remember when that was 'coming' down the line? How they heard us loud and clear? 
---
I doubt - I SERIOUSLY doubt - that ANYONE said they wanted to shell out a hundred dollars to be able to play private worlds or off line.
---
 You paid for this game you fucking moron.. give me your fucking lunch money, dumbass.
---
Some? I don't think you realize how many people are. Those who aren't are the smallest minority.
---
Yeah I know, but I also want the samurai outfit and the vampire one, but I don't know when the vampire ones price will drop for the sale
---
I think you mean less? At least I paid less for the season pass than for the game.
---
They prob missed the decimal point to the left about 5 numbers over.
---
They really need to clarify this, OP can you explain how you know this or came to the conclusion thats what these servers are?
---
I might be a weirdo but id actually pay for a single player like experience
---
Sounds like a roaring success to me.
---
No might about it.
---
The vast majority of the people swearing off Bethesda will buy the next main installment.
---
I'm willing to have a constructive conversation on the topic. I see your point. You can't change the view points of pathos.
---
Nobody PvPs and I don’t care what guns you have. If you want to use fallout 1st then have a good time. If you don’t, then enjoy the game for what it already was. Just give us wastelanders.
---
No one knows we think this does not work
---
*lose it's spelled LOSE dude.
---
I would actually be in favor of paid dlc because then it wouldn't be a 30 minute beer quest once every 3 months but a large DLC like wastelanders.
---
Bold? No. Insult is more like it. It's an insult to the few people who actually still play this garbage fire shit fest. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Tent doesn’t have any workbench to scrap junk.
---
But no they really haven't lol. Sure a few bugs ,but developers were a shitload more careful when games were on cartridges. Can you imagine if they shipped a Nintendo or Sega cartridge with a gamebreaking bug? Nah ah. That shit didn't fly back then.
---
**Narrator**
---
It didn't.
---
I bought the bundle. Can’t find the witch it advertises. Found the fog machine.
---
EA is still around and they been doing this same shit for years. You know who cares about it's community? Ubisoft! And with that snow drop engine they use in division 2... man. Yep loading that up now lol
---
I dont get it either.
---
$100 USD is $144 AUD
---
$100 GBP is $188 AUD
---
Can you subscribe in $USD?
---
I don't mind paying for something thats an online service if I'm not being disadvantaged due to where I live for no reason other than profits$
---
Probably, considering most players are smart enough to know running private servers for individual players cost a lot. And $13 is less than most hosting servers websites, not to mention the bonuses those sites do not have.
---
People will cry about hosting their own servers, while completely ignoring the fact most players lack the hardware, but they cant be bothered to care.
---
Bold not only in the lack of content being offered for such a high price but also because of competition on subscriptions.
---
I got 6 months of gamepass ultimate for $50 which offers a large pool of games and first party day one releases. Hell, even their own Elder scrolls online, which this seems to want to copy, offers all expansions + dlc along with a lot more features on a very large NPC filled map filled with content for cheaper.
---
Charging so much for so little and thinking it's a good move has got to be one of the most daft decisions I've seen in a long lone time.
---
I remember ESO improving as a result of *dropping* their subscription business model.
---
send me all your gears please. :)
---
Is it like a wall decoration? If so, try to look through the variants of them. Usually it’s hidden there.
---
Being able to make world-affecting choices depending on the character you are playing as. New Vegas is a good example, though I suppose that this game would require other human characters for that to be possible.
---
A lot are mad and a lot also bough it, but the majority are casual players who arent on these forums bring influenced one way or the other and they dont care because they arent directly affected.
---
That’s pretty funny
---
I can and have criticized it plenty.
---
Sub costs more then the base game and gives less content.
---
A year seems a bit much I'd say 3-5 months. Then we've been redeemed our $60 at least.
---
Guess you just need 100s of hrs then. Crazy how slow im moving up for decent finishes.
---
Yeah.
---
Ohhh okay, so then what genre is this game?
---
Lmao hey, you got your money's worth out of it, so honestly I guess that's a win for you. Playing any game, even my favorite for 1500 hours sounds like torture to me. That's why I could never do twitch. So many streamers get forced into a single game.
---
You're clearly confident, but I'd suggest you don't deal in absolutes. Even if you buy the next installment, game companies look at DAUs and MAUs to understand longevity and F76 is in desperate need of both.
---
:(
---
ok mr. anarcho capitalist, you forgot the free states flavor there.
---
literally read the wikipedia article for examples on why it doesn't work. I hate commies just as much by the way, there needs to be balance.
---
It's a common MMO tatic. But the games that started this were free to begin with. Runescape was doing it over 15 years ago.
---
I would play 76 if it was free and I would maybe pay a subscription if they added mod support for private worlds. I wouldn't even care if the characters were locked to the world.
---
But $100/year is way to much. That'll probably drop it to $5/month later after all the complaints. So they look like they are doing something to combat the bad press.
---
That being said I'm still really intrested in the game. I might rent it this weekend and either finally pull the trigger on it or get the want out of my system.
---
All major companies have teams dedicated to consumer analysis man.
---
No. Many, many people will wait for reviews before buying. Pre-orders will be down. Sales will be down. I may just wait and buy it from the bargain bin in some sale if I buy it at all.
---
You're completely missing the point. Whether you decide to to buy the subscription service is irrelevant, it is the principle behind it and the precedent it sets.
---
This game is still very much broken. There are still a plethora of bugs, glitches and other issues that haven't been fixed. Rather than taking the time to fix those issues, they're instead asking us to pay another $100, on top of the $60 we spent on the base game (and god knows how much people may have spent in the Atomic shop), to play something that almost the whole community has been asking for since release (private worlds and mod support).
---
If you factor in subscription services and "battle passes" etc. in other games, as well as console subscription services, being a gamer is suddenly becoming an extremely expensive hobby.
---
I keep hearing people say its not  a server, but im not finding anything to back that up yet. 
---
Wont really be surprised either way tho
---
Lmao, someone save this
---
Hahaha 'check yo damn math'
---
Straight jackets are only good for farming caps I believe the sell for 40 at vendors.. from what I know on xbox I have seen brown go for 500-2000, green for 1000-4000, Forrest and yellow for 5000-8000, pink for 10k-20k and red go for up to 40k... white is worth pretty much nothing
---
Do you not realize that fo76 was never meant to be exactly like the other fallouts.
---
People like you act like fo76 is fallout 5
---
Dead
---
Agreed but I'm sticking with them if its foolish or not I love the game too much
---
It'll be okay.
---
Damn that’s cool
---
Took me fourish hours to get all 3000 XP for all the Vaul-Tec U. rewards. It’s doable but doesn’t take hundreds.
---
[link to the image of the witch](https://ibb.co/Y8gS0k5)
---
You mean just like literally every other online game ever?
---
I'm not ashamed in being pro freedom "mr pro oppression"
---
How often does the event take place? Ive been playing on and off all day and have only seen it once so far.
---
God bless /v/
---
The outrageous character is part of his schtick. It's entertaining for a lot of people. People follow him because he relays news in an entertaining way, and never compromises on where the line should be. Saying "it's pretty pathetic" is actually, genuinely being a manchild.
---
Don't worry, Wastelanders will cost money too, at least another 60 bucks. Though you'll probably get to bypass that with an "active" Fallout 1st subscription.
---
FO76 just seems like a giant market test to me. Testing the boundaries of what they can get away with. Honestly the way Bethesda has been treating it... It's like a kid who's told not to touch something, and so he holds his hand an inch away from it and keeps getting closer to see if his parents will stop him.
---
Hope you don't mind, used as an second example for my bug round up...  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 14.0 | 10/23/2019 - The "Bombs" Dropped &amp; Private Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)
---
“Hey guys, just an update. after carefully listening to player feedback, we decided it’d be best to increase the subscription subscription and Lower stash weight back to its original values. We’re always listening to feedback. We hope you stick around for more QoL updates to come. As an added bonus we have tripled the amount of unique items and costumes available in the atom shop for spooktober. See ya in the waste~~land~~”
---
Thank you so much! Are the hats worth that much? I would assume they would be worth maybe half of what the uniforms are worth am I right?
---
People that buy a product and voice their grievances is a normal thing. Expecting people to just disappear when something happens they don't approve of with something they paid for is pretty weird.
---
regulating corporate greed isn't the same as oppressing people. it's what sane people do.
---
Whats vault tec stuff? I just want fancy laser skins.
---
They need a double xp weekend or something. XP is too stingy in NW even when you win. Its faster to just die midway thru and repeat than try to win.
---
Thanks bethesda. Duly noted.
---
Bethesda has crossed yet another line with fo76 I personally love this game but with the micro transactions and things from the subscription should have been with the base game. Now we can only make the best of it and hope wastelanders can put it back on track.
---
Thanks be to Todd Howard may he fix the game
---
It's funny because the guy ACTUALLY behind New Vegas had nothing to do with Outer Worlds and has called it nothing more than a shameless cash grab....
---
I bought 1 month and the private servers run well and my friends used it as well. If you have a friend that has a private server only the owners friends can join.
---
Resembles it's creator more now.
---
Fallout new Vegas is free on game pass and obsidians new game launches free on game pass too
---
They tried pulling ESO+ without all the good stuff
---
Is it a cosmetic item?
---
Haha don't I know it. I will say that you'd be surprised how infrequently 'customer analysis' involves actually speaking to real customers. It's clear they aren't tempering their 'analysis' with anecdotes (like Reddit feedback) that help contextualize that data.
---
White knights are the worst thing in this sort of a situation. If Bethesda does survive this, it'll be those people who let them do it, and it result in their games being of lesser quality and costing more. Well-founded criticism is what leads to improvements.
---
Who the hell is we? Sorry but I do what I please. That includes continuing to play video games that I already paid for, despite their questionable marketing practices and attempts to get into my wallet constantly.
---
Love the pumpkin combat armor
---
All the top mmos use them these days. ESO, FF14, WoW, KotR, Black Desert, EvE, Tera. Everyone hates just flat subscriptions that's why most tag on free cosemtics and shit with it.
---
I’ll be shocked if these private matches they’re adding aren’t peer to peer.
---
Untrue as multiple people can be in adventure mode and possibly farmed or farming same area for scraps while your private sever is only accessed by you which actually decreases your farm to material time. 
---
Add in pvp and other douches in adventure mode yup it’s p2w
---
LoW kEy A bArGaIn
---
No it isn't. Atoms and the shit you use them to buy shit is worthless.
---
*I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle*
---
what about the bugs and lag though.
---
and literally every single fiasco to come out of Fo76 since its release. I don't much care about npcs either but that's just me personally, it doesn't change the fact the game is a dumpster fire.
---
Anyone that pays for this trash still deserves what you get at this point.
---
Oh absolutely, I was planning on selling my xbox until I got gamepass. I haven't played so many different games in such a long time.
---
Regardless, to have a private session, you need space on a server. They are creating a new session for everyone who has Fallout 1st. No doubt that this is costing a hell of alot of money. I'm sure they have a bunch of new servers dedicated to private sessions. I could be wrong, I don't entirely understand all this stuff, but I think I'm right about most of it.
---
I don't think people need Bethesda screwing up as a reason.
---
Added to my roundup as an example, hope you don't mind..  
---
I’d like to hear from someone who is actually buying this subscription just to try to understand.   Someone out there must be buying the sub, right?  I just can’t wrap my mind around it.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that it has nothing to do with Fallout. 
---
It’s set in space. 
---
It would be a much more fair comparison to say it could be a better RPG than Starfield, except we don’t know what Starfield is going to be like. 
---
The only comparison you can make is the dialogue system is very Fallout-esque but even that is a bit of a stretch, seeing as text on screen when talking to NPCs is not unique to any one franchise. The reviewers of TOW are using the comparison to Fallout in a much more general sense and quite frankly it is nothing like Fallout.
---
The  NW rewards through September and most of October were Vault-Tec University themed. A diploma, triangle flag thingy, poster, letterman jacket, tracksuit. That sort of thing. The highest reward was unlocked by getting 3000 NW XP.
---
While I played many MMOs and happily thrown enough money on them, please remember that Fallout 76 is not MMO. My scrap dealing business is going down the drain, if I don't cough up for Fallout 1st. Taking workshops without the only downside of it on a private server is indeed not pay 2 win, but coming pretty close to it. Oh don't forget that you're losing caps only now in PvP if you are using the premium service, because stashing junk doesn't weigh you down now ...  
---
For reference I played:  
---
Lineage II while it was still pay 2 play
---
Aion, pay 2 play on initial launch  
---
using the gold pack, which was available in game for adena
---
Blade &amp; Soul
---
It's premium service offered more bonuses in earnings, however it didn't limit the non-paying players much, also people could happily sell you a subscription if you can give them materials etc. in game.
---
And some others. However I liked the last 2 games for the reason of earning the premium service with in game grind and thus providing options for all players. But none of them had features to make it close to pay 2 win. Because what they locked behind the paywall was either non-tradeable or just a flat bonus to xp, currency etc. Not economy breaking, like easy way to obtain crafting materials.
---
Isn't pay to win when you purchase items you know are duped?
---
They only want to split thier player base if the is a quick $100 bill to be made. It is sad but what we want/wanted only matters if they can put it behind a paywall. I know I personally have lost faith in this once great developer of games. They have joined the ranks of EA and Activision in my eyes.
---
Exactly!  Minecraft, Borderlands, and GTA V for the Xbox360 can all run private servers.  If you have to charge something that everyone else is giving out for free- that you promised would never have a charge, you are the lower quality business.
---
Can we get an apology from BGS please?
---
This is going to be a fairly long post with my thoughts on Fallout 76 now, remember you don't have to read it and if it upsets you please stop reading it. Thanks.
---
I'd love to play this game solo. Multiplayer has no place in a Fallout game for me - I made a post recently on the state of PvP in this game and I was downvoted a lot for some reason. PvP essentially becomes a meta grind, and real human begins absolutely cannot be trusted to provide quality RPG gaming in real time. Oh, but it's okay because Fallout 76 isn't an RPG and they butchered Fallout. Okay, this isn't the place for me to comment about that, so I will remain on topic. Yes, I'd like to play the game solo, but pay £12 a month for it? No. Bethesda, no.
---
I'm lucky because I was given the game as a gift - I didn't pay for it. But I did spend about £50 in the in-game store, but that won't be happening again. Bethesda won't get a penny more of my money because I won't support this, unless 'Fallout 5' comes out and is a fantastic, story-driven, *single-player* experience with no day one paid DLC. Come to think of it, the best 3D Fallout game wasn't even developed by Bethesda - Fallout New Vegas. Huh.
---
Oh, Fallout. You're a sorry state of affairs these days. How Bethesda has butchered you, it started with Fallout 4, they butchered the lore, they butchered the RPG content - only modders made that game worth replaying. Fallout 76 is a disgrace to the Fallout franchise. But it's okay now, because it's dead to me. That itch is scratched by Metro these days, because they've turned Fallout into a cheap, shallow loot 'n shoot multiplayer, pay to win piece of crap.
---
If you're going to reply to my comment just to say something along the lines of "stop whining" or "crying" or etc, then please don't. In fact, if you think Fallout 76 is the best thing since sliced bread, don't bother replying at all. Thanks.
---
Runs like ish on ps3. I only played one dlc and quit because the frame rate was terrible.
---
People are mad about that as well. What world are you living in that you think people aren't mad at politicians? lol.
---
Renting a server on other games let me have others join other then just friends.
---
Looks cool but Im gonna pass. Mainly because MW. Im still gonna play 76 though.
---
I had a crowd of people watching me dance earlier. It was great lol
---
I think you might be a little more heated than I am, pal?
---
&gt; Sorry but I do what I please.
---
Okay? I ended with a request, not a demand lol.
---
&gt;Who the hell is we? 
---
Everyone warning you at the time FO76 released, through it's numerable controversies? 
---
&gt;That includes continuing to play video games that I already paid for, despite their questionable marketing practices and attempts to get into my wallet constantly.
---
Then do not be surprised when the attempts to get into your wallet continue. Including the gatekeeping of features that were touted to be free.
---
But what if... And stay with me here... But what if someone that didn't give a fuck about your doomsday scenario back in the day *still* doesn't?
---
That game ruled BTW, at times you were able to play as a facehugger/chestburster.
---
We most bundles have been slightly lack luster, but should I buy it though
---
Have you ever heard of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Well fuck that guy because he he can’t help either man.You now bow down and worship RNGgesus. And here’s the real secret, he doesn’t like any of us either 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
This guy gets it.
---
That’s not their site. Somebody managed to snag that domain before BGS did.
---
Bethesda said they couldn't hold unlimited scrap because of server stability issues.  Now they have it in a pay service.
---
They can fuck right off.
---
I'm talking about server connectivity issue. the difficulty from vault raids comes from the fact terminals can take up to 10 seconds to load between inputs.
---
not to mention items disappearing due to server sync.
---
They go based on sales. The free market dictates their actions. If enough people buy it to make a good profit then they keep going, if people react poorly and font buy it or even boycott enough to affect profits they stop. Thays how a business is generally run.
---
Hmm. Didn't even know that was a thing. I rarely play. Just saw some cool laser skins that are 25ish lvls in.
---
&gt;That seems like an archaic way to handle data. 
---
Well, yes, it is. I do this for a living and we haven't handle properties like that for many years, so I don't disagree with you on that! I believe the engine is a lot older than Skyrim, though I dont know it's full pedigree like some here...the thing about game engines is that they are not one thing, they're made of multiple components, any one of which can rewritten but the overall performance will be held back to the weakest link
---
If you're the only one with membership among your friends/family, that world closes once you leave it. So y'know, not even a real private server, just a private instanced session.
---
As if bethesda even reads anything in this subreddit. Closest interaction they have is dropping patch notes and leaving.
---
You sound like an abused wife who won't leave because she doesn't know any better.
---
Imagine thinking this game is worth continuing to pay for.
---
They nailed the golden idea of late game capitalism.
---
Problem: We don't have enough storage to store all our crap
---
Solution: For only $12/month you can get unlimited storage for your (literal) crap! 
---
Sell a solution to a problem you created
---
People like you act like valid responses to your points don’t matter if they’re not sucking on the same asshole that’s shitting on the entire community right now.
---
It seems like Bethesda and Blizzard are having a dumbass competition. Who ever can shit on all of their goodwill first wins.
---
Haven’t dealt with it, been separated from my PC since I relocated to New Mexico.
---
Yes please! I was pretty pissed when all of a sudden the game was less then half the price I paid on launch no more than a week after launch. Then the game was so broken that the gf and I stopped playing entirely till last month. Feel a bit behind now. Being level 50 more than a year after launch
---
The membership doesnt really add anything of value anyway. The game is fun otherwise
---
OK a would you rather.....
---
Defendant support Bethesda or Trump?
---
I expect a serious reply
---
Don't then. Whats the big fucking mystery?
---
Unlimited trash can.
---
Well the people quitting or boycotting are gonna have to do alot to offset those of us who are just gonna keep enjoying the content because it's just a video game and we play for fun.
---
Commenting on this to have a reminder to bring this up when Wastelanders is an early release for Fallout 1st subs.
---
Until the scrapbox eats all of your stuff and everything you put in it disappears forever
---
Where is it? I don’t see it in the atomic shop
---
&gt;But what if... And stay with me here... But what if someone that didn't give a fuck about your doomsday scenario back in the day still doesn't?
---
Then everyone blaming you for Bethesda's continuously shit decision making is vindicated.
---
Its funny because ESO is actually a functioning fun MMO and they didn't even get that part right,
---
Oh here we go again with the that is illegal Kids.....
---
Oh i already sent in a support ticket
---
Worth is subjective but I forget this sub has become filled with irrational children
---
7 dollar fridge
---
Once again, I can understand that. That's not really something I thought about. Therefore, I apologise. Maybe this is something that Bethesda can add in the future.
---
Time. Time and how much you can make.
---
how old are you? because anarcho-capitalism is that phase we go when we're going through teenage angst.
---
like I said literally go to wikipedia and see why it doesn't work in the real world.
---
Just wait a year so you don't buy add-ons for a singleplayer game. Like some kind of cuck
---
It is not false advertising, unless you can prove that at the time he said it, he also intended to not do it, and/or was already working to do something different.  And that is very difficult to prove.
---
Besides, for all you know, that is what he thought/felt at the time.  But, minds change.
---
That’s the saddest waste of someone’s time literally ever
---
The "private world" is essentially single player Fallout 4 with a tacked on co-op. There really isn't any point to have it as a online, live service game. In addition you don't really have that much "multiplayer" available in those private worlds, where as Battlefield 1 can support a match with up to 64 individuals. 
---
I don't think that's how profiting works, as that $3 isn't going back into your wallet. Also there really isn't that much you're getting: a scrapbox that's currently bugged and eats your components away, a fast travel tent that's next to useless cause there's so many fast travel points available, the NCR outfit that makes no sense lorewise.
---
I'd argue that those Battlefield servers have a lot more value available than Fallout 76, in the form of stability and a larger player number. If you wanted a single player Fallout just get the previous titles.
---
ESO also has a billion times more content and actual content updates.
---
Not even close hat are common as fuck, maybe 200 Caps for any color at most
---
Way to make it about yourself. Private servers are not the problem. It’s Bethesda’s terrible decisions up to this point that are ruining this game.
---
The Green Thumb bundle is supposed to be in the Atom Shop right now. Isn't the greenhouse in that?
---
They could just allow the players to run dedicated servers. Wouldn't that cost them anything?
---
Which is why we need to regulate every company as if they were an unruly teenager
---
Oops. Sorry. Should’ve got to me 1st. I mean, not like this was anything I had to “give in” over. I wanted to do it. Willingly. Because I wanted to.
---
https://imgur.com/FnzyLOZ
---
No not heated, just find your arrogance hilarious. You have no right to tell others how to spend their money or try to guilt them for making different decisions than you.
---
I mean you wrote multiple paragraphs attacking anyone who would dare disagree with you. 
---
Like I said it's a game grow the fuck up. Lol.
---
I enjoy the game and it’s loop. But how can you be okay with being charged $100/year for content we’ve been asking for for months? They’ve pretty much admitted that they’ll continue to add more utility to the Atom Shop. I wasn’t saying we should all boycott the game, just the micro-transactions we were blatantly lied to about.
---
Who at Bethesda is making these decisions. Like serious question at this point.
---
The problem is im tired of hearing just support it...it will get better....when do we stop that passive mindset and take some action as the consumer? We have to know and realize when enough is enough and open our eyes to the blatent bullshit. It reaches a point to where fanboy or not, ya know something is seriously wrong....and coming from someone who sank hundreds of hours into this shitshow that I once loved, enough is enough. Maybe you need to wake up and accept that you cant keep supporting a company that doesnt seem to give two fucks about you. I dont know you at all, but id put a grand on the table you couldnt look me in the face with a straight face and tell me there isnt major issues and concerns here.
---
Banning a hearthstone player for utilizing first amendment rights?
---
This is spam
---
Let me know what happens...
---
Now, if the kajiit was giving me potions, I’d actually be upset.
---
It's almost as if it wasn't a circle jerk and the game was legitimately a pile of shit 🤔🤔
---
I’m in love
---
I remember playing team fortress when I was a teenager.
---
I could host a server completely free, and I had friends code mods for the server. It was a blast, it was mostly a trading server, but the social aspect was the best.
---
**How much did this privately modded server cost? Nada, absolutely nothing.** The mods you could buy, but thankfully I had some friends who were smart enough to make their own.
---
I believe I was incorrect about that. I've read that you do get to keep it but I can't tell you that with 100% certainty.
---
That's the saddest part, though, they're the ones paying Bethesda.
---
All I'm hearing is "blah blah blah." What else is new? It's pretty much a cycle at this point
---
* Bethesda does something good, but accidentally does some major bug
---
* Everyone hates them for the bug and the good stuff gets *some* praise but not alot
---
* Bethesda fixes the bug, but then does a fuck-up of variable degrees (Repair kits, Scrap kits, Fridge and Collectron, Wastelanders Delay, Nuclear Winter's reveal)
---
* People get angry
---
* People get *really* angry, start insulting Bethesda as if whatever fuck-up they did is *the* worst thing ever in the world, go "Oh, this other game is coming out. Guess you can SUCK IT Bethesda cuz I'm gonna go play that instead!," threaten to sue while not understanding one bit of law, do a 'protest/boycott,' list continues (people get really dramatic)
---
* People calm the fuck down after about a week. Everything goes roughly back to normal.
---
* Repeat 
---
Yeah, the sub gets tiresome after roughly a year of this. And that's why I go on r/fo76filthycasuals more
---
I just bought Atoms and the Halloween bundle.
---
&gt;$100 is a lot of money,
---
cries in warhammer 40k
---
Fallout 1st? By pre-ordering, we all subscribed to Fallout LAST.
---
I cant believe people play those wolfenstein 3D clones. Doom, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, MAG, Goldeneye, Duke Nukem, Borderlands, Fallout 3, Battlefront, Battlefield, Overwatch, Paladins, Dirty Bomb, the list goes on. Such clones.
---
So do you not need the matching hat to expect say 25k for a red uniform?
---
Or consumers can react however they want because they’re allowed to.
---
Sure! 6 months and everyone can have a chance at seeing if the value is worth it.
---
I imagine the real strain on the stash system is unique items like weapons and armor which can have lots of modifiers, as opposed to junk which is all the same. That said, you could almost certainly cause some problems with the system, although if you do like a stack overflow (I think that’s the term) you only screw yourself.
---
What happened to ESO2 - 5?
---
right off the bat
---
&gt;But It's become standard in gaming now to release unfinished games/constantly evolving games.
---
1. "It's Bugthesda" but seriously... it's a single player engine jury rigged into a multiplayer game that they can only update roughly 1-2 times a month due to console certifications... it's a miracle it's not as buggy as it could be.
---
2. None of this is pay to win.  If you want a good breakdown see https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm8zgf/psa_in_order_for_something_to_be_p2w_there_has_to/
---
3. Only if you buy it directly from Bethesda, which would be stupid when you can buy it at as low as $19.99 on Amazon or probably even lower elsewhere if you looked.
---
4. They haven't technically charged for any new features, everything non-cosmetic they've added to the atom shop or through this deal can be accomplished in game through other means.  These purchases just make things you can already do slightly more convenient without providing an actual advantage.
---
5. It's $12.99 a month for $15 worth of atoms plus all of the additional stuff.  They REALLY need people to use the atom shop to keep this game going and this is what they've been reduced to in an attempt to get people to buy atoms.
---
6. Do you want broke/incomplete DLC or do you want them to do it right the first time around?  You can't complain that the game is buggy and then complain that they aren't rushing out stuff they aren't ready to release which will then end up being buggy.  Bethesda didn't push back Wastelanders just to fuck with people.  They knew people were going to be pissed but they had to do it anyway.
---
7. This is just a rehash of #4?
---
That’s a neat idea. I’d login to eso to see if I could get stuff to share with my old friends if they’re still around. It’s been a year since I left.
---
RIP Star wars battlefront 2 loot boxes. They don't even remember you.
---
Theres definitely a theme.
---
Then play the free public servers....I don’t get it. No one is forcing you to buy a private world.
---
No it isn't.
---
Atoms are worthless. That's a fact. Unless you're a child of course who believes digital currency is worth something because you can 'look cewl.'
---
Lol you don’t deserve shit
---
In the way they rolled it out? Yes. I was shocked. Figured it would just be a tiered “more money, more player space private Adventure mode” thing. Hell, people be upset over that too.
---
The smoke machine alone is worth it lol. The pumpkins actually give off a glow on the ground of its face. It's pretty cool.
---
I’m confused, what are we winning. I play lone wanderer, some play in teams.  Only PvP is at workshops. ( in adventure mode). So who cares. 
---
If you don’t want to play, don’t. But bitchin is getting lame.
---
Edit sorry don’t know why this replied to you have a good day!
---
Well that’s easy. Just stop expecting it to be good.
---
I think the social aspect brings new things to the table. For me, having a strong character adds new opportunities for solo challenge, like killing the Scorchbeast Queen, clearing Vault raids and things like that. The game is as much as you want it to be.
---
Same earlier, tried to warn as many as i could..hate to see it 😩
---
Confirmed
---
I’m shill, ok cool or maybe I just don’t just get irrationally angry over things that don’t effect my gameplay.
---
Everything is running smoother... literally everything...
---
And
---
156 dollars a year, you buy popcorn as a one off, or even better bring your own that doesn’t cost 10 bucks
---
Actually seo wise it will eventually rank high if anyone types in fallout first vs fallouts site because content / key word / and domain will be matching. 
---
Fallout.com will have longer domain authority though.
---
Still no pay to win. Try playing an actual pay to win game and you'll see the difference.
---
No matter how you label a company if they are making profit and not hurting anyone it changes nothing.
---
ouch man sry 
---
hope this gets resolved
---
I'd rather pay for online than be around your autistic ass.
---
Dear Bethesda, your fans have been waiting patiently for you to fix your game.  Now you’ve delayed your fix and slapped on a premium subscription fee. This is not what your fans want -every FO76 player
---
The entitlement of some of the kids here is fucking astounding.
---
Very reasoned, though i would point out that all these decisions were made for a reason. If they made any miscalculation it is only in the amount of optics its getting, or the effect of eroding public good will ever since the god damned horse armor darkened store shelves. Bethesda has always been the pioneer for these kind of things before even EA would give birth to ultimate team. That was in 2006 for oblivion!
---
they were never able to provide what they promised the tech and their talent are wholly unable to reach these lofty goals, and they knew it. They were not interested in that, and never intended too, but they were interested in selling the facade of the promise. (16x the detail..smh)
---
they did FINALLY learn that the only reason their games lasted as long as they did in the zeitgeist is due to the hard work of modders, and without modders the playerbase will lose interest and there will be no one left to buy $30 imports from fallout 4. Can't have a LiVe SeRvIcE without content to keep people players, and to turn players into payers. But modders also undermine the Micros themselves, as a modder can (and have) made that sad attempt at the FONV ranger armor better in every way and for free. So this is the scheme to allow mods yet still profit off of them.
---
remember when they tried to monetize the mods directly in skyrim and FO4?
---
Not gonna lie, I read about this shit and I CANNOT wait for Oct 25th COD Modern Warfare.  I got rid of all of my COD shit for Fallout 76, hoping for an MMORPG upgrade of FO4 and I am still pissed.  I went through hell to get the tricentennial edition.  I dragged my fiance with me to hype her up about this game and then I look like a shitheel when it goes fucking insane.  I got most of their games on release day religiously from ESO to  the Wolfenstein reimaginings simply due to Besthesdas attachment to them.  I will never do it again.
---
The last year was all about culling the gamers. Now all that is left are whales. Now they can reliably calculate how much they will make with each “expansion.”
---
Opinions differ obviously, but Fo4 was *not* worse than FoNV, nor was it a money grab unlike 76, which was the beginning of actual problems for Bethesda. Though I'd argue it goes back to ESO and it's shitty launch.
---
Looking at all the ranger jackets and scrap boxes out there it looks like many have opted in.
---
Yeah, I am now. It’s just heartbreaking to me as I’ve held the fallout series close to my heart for a long time and it’s sad to see that this is where we are now. Guess it was naive of me to expect something good to come eventually.
---
Just the start
---
Go check if your micro penis is still there
---
It wouldnt cost beth anything BUT
---
the vast majority of players do not have the hardware to run a server and play at the same time. So if they went that route most players wouldnt be able to play privately.
---
I must be the only person that played it alone or with 1 friend, and thoroughly enjoyed myself for close to 100 hours, never buying any additional pieces off the store....I feel like I got my $30 worth. Money well spent.
---
http://falloutfirst.com/
---
Attack the arguement not the person. That's childish and shows you have no valid counter points. Also wikipedia is just normal people writing a page.
---
Building settlements,  deciding I didnt like them, rebuilding them, restarting a ton of times, making giant body piles, doing experiments on vault dwellers, using tires and tossing them at explosive cars to make the car move etc. Just fun stuff.
---
Support shitty practices and getting hit with even more is par for the course. Don’t support shit and more shit won’t be sent your way.
---
Seconded
---
NV&gt;76 but on PS3 NV crashed like **crazy**.
---
You're not entitled to free things, buy. I mean boy.
---
Bingo.
---
Hey thanks for the positive camaraderie. I also love (read: obsess over) building/customizing and trying to make my camps an additional cool immersive experience for visiting players. I'm on Xbox but really appreciate the offer ✌🏼
---
I've never had a hard time with the crafting materials in fo76 to be honest. I usually sell hundreds of Ultracite, screws, springs, gears, aluminum, and black titanium every weekend.
---
Dude, let your hard-on go down.
---
doesn't make sense that someone would argue this.
---
That's not even close to accurate.
---
I knew Fallout 76 wasn't going to be great, i didnt expect much from this game. I was incredibly surprised and i definitely got my money's worth, i non stop played the game for at least 3 months after launch but i always knew in the back of my mind, this is will get better in one way and worse in others. I knew this wasn't Fallout 5, most people refuse to accept that and act like since 76 is subjectively bad then now Fallout as a franchise is doomed. Its not, its basically an MMO lite as another Redditor refered to it as and they're completely right.
---
I got my time out of 76 and ive backed away until stuff gets better, its one of the only right things anyone can do right now. I still keep watch and stay up to date with everything that is going on. I want a reason to play the game, im patiently waiting for wastelanders. 
---
Yeah stuff is going haywire but for the most part, that branch of Bethesda's only issue is lack of transparency with the community. They should of stated flat out that they've given up on the whole Co-op Fallout idea. Well it still is but they really should've stated that they have completely changed plans and believe that semi Pay to win systems belong in their game. Yeah its kind of scummy but they need money, they are a business and honestly you still dont need anything like the pay to win stuff to have fun. Why do you care if others are getting a slight advantage over you? Yes they lied and of course they are going to deal with the backlash and hopefully give everyone compensation but its not like they nerfed something and then gave us a payed way to get it better, that would be purely asinine and then everyone would have a true reason to riot 
---
Bethesda needs to be completely honest with everyone about everything, maybe things could get better.
---
Frontier developments and r/elitedangerous have done the same
---
Epitome of greed? That’s EA my friend, Bethesda and all other AAA publishers are fighting for second place.
---
Why do you drop a game you enjoy for things you don’t have to buy? 
---
I won’t buy them but i still gonna play the game cause i enjoy it
---
Abusive relationships are always hardest to leave.
---
I am. like I said, google anarcho-capitalism for examples on why it's a bad thing. I'm not here to give you a history lesson.
---
spoiler: it's essentially just as stupid as communism.
---
I did. Decorated my vending machine space.
---
No, I sank hundreds of hours into this game, left about 2 months ago cause there isnt really shit to do or keep anyone longterm as it stands...and I dont see npcs changing it much either even when that drops. This game still functions generally the same to most players....farm the farm spots all day long to gain a level to brag about...that really doesnt matter or do anything, well besides look cool on the map to kids and new comers to the game lol. I literally have zero desire at this present moment to even boot this game up. Me being a Bethesda fan in general is the only reason im still even here in this group. I clinged on to hope...but that is just about gone at this point...its fuck up after fuck up at this point.
---
That’s just an opinion my child. Worth is subjective. I can literally say you’re worthless to society because you’re wasting time on reddit not doing anything productive. 
---
Also if someone wants to spend their money to make their character look cool, who gives a fuck. It’s their money and as a consumer they have the freedom to spend it however they want. Welcome to the free market.
---
Also more expensive than the upcoming Google Stadia membership that will give you access to some pretty good games.
---
\&gt;(LIE) Now theyre selling PAY2WIN
---
​Nothing in the Atomic Shop is even remotely close to Pay2Win
---
\&gt;(LIE) Now the new service fallout 1st lets you have all the size in your private and public servers. If it was only on the private server i would be ok with it
---
Why do you think this costs money? To pay for the extra servers and storage space and upgrades so it can happen.  You may as well scream at a storage unit company why they charge money for using their units.
---
File a lawsuit
---
if ur still playing this game after everything youre a sucker. even Bethesda knows it. I said it after the fridge debacle. they are laughing at you and counting money.  they think this is all funny
---
Ill take a break here and there but im at least waiting til wastelanders. But the bar is now raised. Ive been disappointed by every new event so far. So WL is there last shot to prove theyre actually trying and proving if theres a future here.
---
I had the game, but I sold it awhile ago. Now I'm just here to witness ppl be in extreme denial
---
I really didn’t write paragraphs attacking anyone? 
---
Sure I called the zealots who are buying into this bootlickers because that’s how I see it and I explained why I see it that way. It wasn’t (meant to be) aggressive and I laid out in a clear and simple way why I see it as objectively bad for the community rather than simply call someone arrogant and telling them to “grow the fuck up.”
---
I’m sorry you were offended
---
I suppose you would prefer a communist or socialist regime that controls all business?
---
Damn I didn’t think of that. I have too many plans for sale to replace everything. Maybe this weekend ._.
---
And I'm pounding sand into every open oriface.
---
Doubt it to be honest. Most Americans have no savings
---
and there's that smugness
---
It changes a lot actually. But the shortsighted, and the shills won't see it.
---
I don't wa t to but evidently we can't trust them
---
Yep that sounds like the case from the information I've found today. A real bummer but what can you do? Will probably take me a while to start over though...damn 😕
---
I play NV on PC sometimes without any mods and it runs just fine. You have no idea what you're talking about lol
---
Edits like those are BOLD! Fucking hell
---
Only you can prevent ass fucking. And forest fires
---
Only game that is 95% plus is rimworld
---
I prefer an updated game than having a game that never gonna get news contents or balances patches.
---
I’m horrible at it so I was pumped after grinding almost harder than ever before lol I likes my NW Letterman
---
ZeniMax would never let the rights to FO go or any other popular games. 
---
They are worth Billions, own not only Bethesda. But slo own; Machine Games, Arkane, id software, and probably some more big names I'm forgetting. 
---
They would probably close Bethesda. Sell all the IP to themselves (for dirt cheap), write the rest off in bankruptcy, and wash their hands of the whole ordeal.
---
They’ve taken a beloved franchise rooted in single player RPG mechanics and slowly thrown in all the Fortnite bullshit they can... (battle Royale, daily quests/to do, buying skins, paint, emotes, and other cosmetic stuff). No long term Fallout fan cares to spend money on “skins” or “gun wraps(paint)”... they want story that they can affect based on their own decisions in the game. They’ve screwed over their fans so hard in an effort to make money and my guess is that they’re losing so much money on the game that they rushed private servers to try justify charging someone $100/year to finally make it profitable... the extra stash and “free atoms for $100/year” are just thrown in to try justify the annual cost. 
---
I’ve played through all the main story quests for FO76 and then I stopped... waiting for wastelanders hoping it will bring back as close as we can get to fallout but not holding my breathe. I pledge to not login until it’s released and if it sucks I’m done for good!
---
You’re fucking yourself in the ass
---
What? Do they have guided missiles aimed at us?
---
It’s more pay to play tbh
---
Still gonna play, still gonna pay.
---
Anyone shaming you for paying and playing are quite clueless indeed.
---
Walked right into that one. :)
---
You're labeling me an "anarcho-capitalist" and then getting mad at me for being what you said I am even though I never agreed. Stop with the straw man arguement.
---
I mean you just paid extra money in fo76 did you expect your purchase to be worth it?
---
Sorry to hear that—not to be a creep but I actually found this comment after reading your excellent power armor guide. I just got 76 last week for $10 and I’ve really been enjoying it (although I just had to stop tonight because Bethesda’s servers crashed twice at the end of the into the fire main quest and I was ready to throw my controller through the tv). I’m at level 24 working on a power armor build and your guide came up in google, shame to hear you’ve been driven off from the game.
---
Well I think this is the alternative to shutting them down, if they can charge a bit and keep them up they might as well, it's just repurposing and it's not like you aren't getting other stuff. In the end though it's very audience specific, for those players that want private servers/sessions and buy Atoms it's a pretty good value. Do I think Bethesda made a bad move? yeah..I do, they're offering more for less and giving people atoms is hit or miss. Be in the look out for other tiers of subscription and more content released for premium only. They do have me on edge about Wastelanders, I hope that doesn't become subscription only.
---
I'm really excited about the tent  because last week or so I was thinking how convenient it would to be able to have a mini camp for some out if the way places where there isn't really any workshops to use. While I do like the challenge, sometimes it's midnight and I have work in the morning and I just wanna finish scrapping for a weekly and not look for a bench and huff and puff my overburdened ass the whole way there.
---
I don't think the game itself is bad, it's just buggy at times. Some of the home defense stuff irritates me because it's not useable, I've fallen through the world in nuclear winter on the side of a particular house, and the friends list bug....that one is the absolute worst .. everything else I can deal with and not get pissy and irrate about.  Or
---
If FONV is any indicator of Obsidians ability to develop a Fallout title then I’m all in. Bethesda has done nothing but break my heart since the launch of this dumpster fire. I remember playing FO3 for hours on end then being amazed at the desolate landscape and immersive stories of FONV. That’s the fallout I want. Not this sacrilegious, meme-level insult to the series.
---
That's what hosting companies are for such as HostHavoc and SerenityServers. It gives the user the option to host on their own, as they should be able to for stuff like private worlds, or pay a server company to run their server for them and provide file access. No one is asking you to setup an entire dedicated server machine, but $12/month for a private game instance that doesn't save? That's an abusive relationship
---
If they enjoy it what does it hurt?
---
Its a bonus for people who get the 1st membership, along with the robot dance and ranger outfit.
---
I feel like the only right answer is, assuming you're already ok with the concept of buying atoms, to buy a month, reap the benefits, stack your scrap box with several thousand pounds of all materials but not after crafting several hundreds of thousands of your favorite ammo, and then cancelling it.
---
Found Todd Howard he must be off his hooker kick.
---
This situation went from entertaining shit-show to legitimate confusion
---
Half of them like them by comparison lmao
---
Todd Howard thanks you for your money.
---
r/AwardSpeechEdits, one of the worst cases I’ve seen. Looks like we’re gonna have to put him down, there’s just nothing we can do at this point. He’s beyond help. So sad.
---
If you are not bothered by new and want to continue playing you should. I won't be, but that is my decision. If you still enjoy it and want to play it you should be the one to decide. Who cares what other people on reddit think?
---
Seriously $100 for a year after they just set ESO plus one year at more than that. Loved ESO plus but Bethesda fucked up the prices there and now on FO76
---
That makes sense given the day of the patch.  Would've been the perfect day for a massive re-launch essentially.
---
Yep. Same
---
It's truly a shit show.
---
r/awardspeechedits
---
No, in a free market it means nothing. All that matters is 1. Are they hurting anyone? 2. Is it a sustainable and profitable buisness model?
---
I think they actually raised the price on the SP a while after the game came out. It was wack, I’ve never seen one go up in price before.
---
No you won't... And you know you won't...
---
You will, but the private servers are paid
---
After two misspellings of business in a row I think it's clear you're not an authority on the subject.
---
All hail our benevolent lord Todd Howard
---
Hiel!
---
Your really think this is the game and time they've doubled down on wanting money? After all the dlc from before skyrim and the 20 plus versions of skyrim... This. This is what did it for you? You're just pissy because you somehow feel entitled to free shit.
---
Some folks are really whipped by Bethesda...
---
😆!
---
Jesus christ. NO hes not saying you cant voice your opinion. He us suggesting TO THE PEOPLE STILL PLAYING that they can vote with their wallet by stopping.
---
Not the worst thing I've spent 13 dollars on
---
They know it’s bullshit too... they knew when they announced private servers that it was going to cost extra and they subtly implied it... why not announce Fallout 1st last week to hype it up instead of springing it in people the day it releases? Oh ya, because people will be pissed!
---
I said this when the came first came out, about a year ago, and was unsurprisingly downvoted to hell: you're the most gullible person on earth if you eat up their PR bs even for a second.
---
we get that, but then they could have given EVERYONE unlimited scrap, that way stash can be for the struff we give a fuck about.
---
That is a good point! It would definitely be better if it ran full time, and if we kept what we build on workshops!
---
I've seen a lot of friends in private servers... And only a few visiting private servers.
---
Plenty of people bought at least a months worth
---
Don't mind at all, the whole point is to spread the word  so Bethesda can think about planning to eventually get around to one day coming up with an idea that may resolve this issue.
---
No it's not. No one is forcing you to get this service.
---
Do you speak other languages or are you just stupid?
---
Are you going to play The Outer Worlds?
---
The daedric armor thing sounds exactly like what I'm into, thanks for the in depth explanation!
---
They will never loose, because people keep playing the game. No matter what they do people will always play this game! (i quit 6 months ago due to lack of content and their big inability to fix broken things. But i like to follow the sub )
---
Edit: tHaNkS fOr ThE pLaTiNuM
---
Yeah. One of my earlier comments, I talk about a CAMP being supported by only a staircase but like I said, since I have not seen it in a while I only assumed that feature might have been removed.
---
The glitching through stuff when leaving PA only ends up freezing my game.  I've never used it to try and get underground, just thought I was clear when trying to leave my PA.
---
Are people really going to play this game after all this?
---
Really is the day the bomb dropped. Only feral gamers would still be playing after this.
---
Can I get the NV music but only in fallout 1st please? I want these babies to feel more butthurt while I enjoy my private server 😀
---
This is excellent
---
What’s your idea?
---
We did get a nice boat load of extra content.  I miss that game.
---
&gt; but if you liked it you wouldn't complain
---
What abusive relationship bs is this?
---
No one cares
---
That's the thing, I do approve of the behavior. I have zero problems with how Bethesda is running 76. I love it. I want to get more updates and new content. But I don't think it's bad where it's at.
---
ZeniMax Media and it's executive board want larger revenues. Video game development companies have traditionally had really long development cycles, soaking up a lot money while their project is built with the hope that it will hugely successful upon release. In Bethesda's case, Fallout 3, Skyrim, and Fallout 4 were huge successes but ZeniMax and their ilk have wanted a more consistent and timely revenue stream. 
---
Why wait five or six years while the studio you own can create a game using existing assets within a year and half, release it piecemeal and have the potential to earn a steady stream of money over the course of five years.   By calling the game a "Live Service" you explain away the rushed development and shoddy production values to your customers and if all goes well a company like ZeniMax gets their cash quickly rather than waiting for the lump sum payoff.
---
So, it's less about Bethesda as a studio, a more about the company that owns them being out of touch simply because ZeniMax doesn't have to make anyone happy but their shareholders.
---
but, if you get the 1600 atoms is it technically paid for..? 🤔
---
rangers have that effect on people. I'm more interested in the numbers a month from now.
---
That’s nothing to brag about.
---
Watch them slowly increase the weight of junk now without saying anything...
---
Get what message? That kids on gaming subs want everything to be free? Bought the full year. This really is not the outrage you mindless bandwagoning brats think it is.
---
I'm not upset as much as I am genuinely shocked. My rage towards 76 died 2 weeks after launch. I made the $60 back and called it a loss and moved on. I haven't touched the game in I don't know how long. 
---
I'm not typing this out of anger or personal strife. I'm typing this because I have never, being alive for Sega to now, been as shocked by a company move as I am by this. 
---
I honestly cannot think of anything as bold or absurd, maybe E.T for Atari, that this is. I cannot think of anything more bold or absurd than this in history. That's not hyperbole. If you can please let me know
---
Somebody gets it!
---
Yeah buddy we have slightly bigger problems right now.
---
It's unlimited in the amount you can put in, what they don't tell you is how much you can keep or take out, which apparently is nothing.
---
Let’s not be stealing the crown from EA just yet.
---
Umm yes it will. Remember battlefront 2? They tried to pass all of those mtx’s off so they can make a profit but the community had an outrage and they had to stop. Consumer outcries due change a product and a company because it threatens their ability to make money.
---
Bitch pls. Freedom of speech is to a government, not within a private event run by a corporation.
---
Also all involved acknowledge Blitzchung broke the rules.
---
Blizzard deserved the backlash but at least know what you're talking about.
---
This!
---
I dunno, this feels like end of the world to me
---
Their concern was the effect item hoarding would have on the servers since it tracks every item including the ones in your stash. Apparently they found a way to nullify the effect of mass reoccurring items like crafting materials.
---
😑
---
The majority of people here right now don't actually play this game and are outrage tourists so youre yelling at the wind buddy
---
Any particular reason why you disable sli?
---
😁
---
Strange. After reloading, it now allows me to place it.
---
They've already said months ago that they planned to add server settings and the ability to mod the servers, they just want to get it off the ground before throwing a wrench in there. 
---
Those companies you listed charge just as much and dont give any extra benefit, so it's really not a big deal.
---
25kbis low price for Red Uniform and no no hat needed. Red is by far the rarest and is 40k+ but mostly good for trades like legacys and such
---
Why would I leave a relationship that gives me EXACTLY what I want and makes me super happy? :P

Believing in free business practice so long as no one is being hurt isnt "anarcho-capitalism". I never said not to regulate anything at all like an anarcho-capitalist. I said so long as no one is being hurt. Of course regulations should be in palace if something is a detriment to the society with no benefits. Try explaining how Bethesda's actions are hurting anyone.
---
Lol, why would i be a sucker for playing a game I enjoy and already bought?
---
I won’t buy any of this optional stuffs.
---
Moldy helmets. Holy fuck I can’t believe that actually happened.
---
Bbq sauce....never changes
---
And the shinanigans continue... Wtf BGS? You giving up or just getting started? Can't tell anymore you smug fuckers...
---
It wasn't outcries, it was drop in playerbase and profit.
---
You care enough to comment
---
well DUHH you dumbass, this is your own damn fault, they said you have unlimited scrap stash...didn't say you could keep it, you see now you can put all the scrap and stuff you want in there and never run olut of room!!!
---
ahem...sorry bad joke, but this is just so stupid, they can't even fuck up right.
---
No, it's the idea that explaining the free market to someone who likely understand the concept is deliberately condescending. And disagreeing with your explanation doesn't inherently make someone a 'communist' or 'socialist' (of which I'm neither). I will say that I don't see the point you're trying to make; is it that businesses want profits? If so, then well put 👍
---
In the scope it can be, the video game scope, it is the most absurd thing I can ever think of a company doing. Topical posts aren't spam. Something tells me I'm probably older than you and have probably lived less of a "secluded life" than you but that's not relevant
---
Don't you think Bethesda and EA exist and thrive because most people don't give anywhere close to as much of a fuck as you do?
---
Vocal minorities will never impart meaningful change.
---
For every asshole crying about greedy EA / Bethesda, there's 5 more just enjoying their games.
---
I'm not sure. I will probably never wear it. I'm not sure if I want to trade for a legacy weapon or if i want the caps.
---
I get where you are coming from, the problem for me is...you as a company have to have something for me to wanna support. As this game stands, there isnt enough content to keep the average player longterm. They shoulda came with something that felt at the very least, sorta complete from the jump....then id be all for supporting em and living with issues for a awhile....but ya cant have an unfinished game feeling, hardly anything to do in the big picture of things and still want me to pay ya. This game shoulda been sold as a game preview, period, amd it woulda been much more accepted IMO. Gotta find the happy medium there, I need to feel confident as the consumer just as much as the business should thats trying to sell me their product and keep me as a supporting and repeat customer....which I am currently not believing on their end...if ya ask me, they are grasping for straws, and doing anything to recoop some losses at this point. I honestly dont even believe that they have a plan, seems like they are just throwing anything at the wall and hoping something sticks.
---
It was like rohan riding to save gondor
---
Glorious
---
Let them spend that avengers money all they want. What else were they gonna do with it?
---
Nope, happened to me just now and I'm on PS4
---
How much scrap are you holding onto that you're that hard up for storage space for weapons and armor?  I consider myself a still recovering hoarder and still hold onto more scrap than I'll likely ever need and even then I've only taken up roughly 120lbs of stash space.  You really don't need to hold onto that much in reserve, the more common scrap can be farmed in mass quantities if you just know the right places to look and enemies to kill and even the rarer scrap is used infrequently enough that you shouldn't need to hold onto too much of it at once.
---
Meh.  The way I figure it, I can pay for a sub, which costs about as much as a combo at a fast food joint or dump that money into gas for my Wrangler.  I think that running the wrangler in 4 lo is worse for the environment...
---
Do whatever you want man don't let people shame you. 
---
I'm quitting but it's only because its the best for me, my last break from the game was great, and I'm honestly sad to see how little has changed.
---
A lot of people do these days. But sadly FO76 is the price you pay when studios who have no business in the live service market try to take a stab at it. 
---
Some games are okay online and with ongoing content. But the idea that every game needs to be a live service now... Fuck that EA master goal bs.
---
the rest of the world has already forgotten about Fo76. from an outside perspective this is nothing more than a sensible chuckle.
---
the concept that people are still playing one of the worst games of 2018 is unthinkable, let alone that the developer is asking for even more money. it's literally a joke at this point.
---
Haha I feel you on quitting with occasional check-ins. I don't disagree that people may keep playing, but I think the drop-off is more significant than good ol' Beth believes.
---
Says the idiots who bought the game in the first place when everyone knew it sucked ass and was nothing more than a cash grab with the fallout name tagged on.
---
So I could expect full value even without the hat?
---
It’s all Bethesda has at this point.
---
I can and will complain about anything I want.
---
Who the fuck do you think you are?
---
XD
---
My point is that Bethesda is a buisness, they exist to make money and they will take the course that is most profitable. The free market will dictate their actions.
---
Pay $40 more then the base game for less content. Great.
---
Offline mode is feasible. The only issue is that so much of the game is based around multiplayer. Can you solo the queen/sheepsquatch/project paradise and still get max rewards? Even the legendary drop system is based around being able to trade. There's a lot that would have to be done to make it work, gameplay-wise and technically. (save and reload system, world permanence, perks, does not having to account for other players free up resources that can be used elsewhere?) Lest, of  course, Bethesda release another broken update that "modders have to fix". But it is a much requested feature, and as long as you keep asking, it will always be on their radar.
---
Don't forget
---
"Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right." - Pete Hines
---
Imagine thinking buying a game and wanting it to function is "wanting free stuff." 
---
If you think this okay, you're clearly too young to recall a time where games didn't come with even DLC or patches.
---
See the issue with that though is that thinking is what allowed this to go so far. I'm okay with private servers being paid for, I mean I defended it, but these arent how private servers work. Normally you have control over them, they dont shut down after you leave, and the worst part is that they can be cleaned out by server hoppers before you even get on!! On a side note, those utility items are ridiculous.
---
Meh.  I gave up on it after about 3 months.  I was thinking about getting back on but they've given me a reason not to now.  Still, I like coming around this sub just to see how things are going.
---
This game has never been balanced.
---
who ever buys this shit is a fkin idiot. NO EXCUSE!!!
---
500000000 IQ Bethesda plays
---
Exactly what an outcry is? All of those youtubers and news articles and the launch of the “vote with your wallet” mindset. Thats what an outcry is, Its wanting to get your voice heard and your opinions taken into consideration and the community did just that.
---
Do you have any mods installed?
---
They should have used the one with the middle finger from Twitter.
---
I’ve been with Beth since Morrowind and LOVE the immersion and game play of all their RPG titles.
---
I think companies get to big to fail and get arrogant.
---
Hell look at FF14 and that freaking train wreck launch I was right in there with that one.  It was so bad they fired the whole Dev team and scrapped the game and started over for the most part, and they made a great game.
---
I think Beth is trying hard to fix it and they will.
---
You’re going to get a better overall game with sub....believe me it’s a revenue stream that is steady and can be forecasted to the board and justify RND and more resources.
---
Hang in there
---
Okay, I agree that Bethesda is a business. We're aligned there.
---
But good god man spell 'business' correctly, especially after you've been called out. We all have room for improvement.
---
Can’t I just play a Fallout game in a new setting/time without them completely reinventing the game? That’s all I ever want.
---
Get a few more shifts at Qdoba... You'll be straight
---
Except GTA Online wouldn't need to make money off of subscriptions because their "free" content packs are gated behind hundreds of dollars of mtx.  This is greedy, but GTA Online is like the concept of greed as a video game.
---
Maybe it is the servers. Less what they're capable of and more of what they're doing. NW proves they can handle more players if you take out all the hoarding.
---
Because they promised certain things to consumers, went back on those promises and on top of that never actually released a fully functioning actual triple AAA game. Also they are claiming this is what the community wants.
---
But actions speak louder then words so as I said these posts do nothing. Vote with your wallet is exactly what I was saying.
---
Funny that Fallout was critical of American exceptionalism and capitalism, now look at it
---
Fuckin scumbag company
---
So there is a bug I read about about people losing all their scrap, any of you lose anything yet or have you logged onto another friends private server and checked out the scrapbox to find all your stuff still there or is it gone now??
---
subsciptions arent even the weid part.
---
its just that the content isnt worth the price
---
With the EPA being defunded and corporations running rampant (along with coal ships transferring bullshit from china to save a few pennies) the hippiest of my hippie pals don't even care about that shit anymore. It's barely significant. Honestly they're not even hippies for not wanting corporations to not dump sludge in water. Like that should be bullshit to all political parties in my opinion but I digress
---
EA chortles on the background.
---
Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean we have to do the same. I don't rant about this issue or that issue , as its just a game 
---
Yes it can be annoying, but I've had my money's worth.
---
How many games have you played that are over after 20 to 40 hours?
---
We have all got our monies worth
---
Its autocorrecting to that after I spell it correctly my dude.
---
The functions. I'm playing it right now. And this is ok, , there was no Internet back then, games couldn't continously develop like now. Though, there were still expansions packs, different versions of the game and ugh, magazines and all kinds of stupid merchandise. Games still had bugs and glitches a plenty.
---
It hasn't started yet. You must have it confused with some other event you saw. From Bethesda: "Starting at 12:00 p.m. EDT on October 29 until 12:00 p.m. EST on November 5" And it'll happen every hour, on the hour, just like the meat cook did.
---
well I havn't played since they upped the storage, but when it was what 400?   I was having to delete all my steel and such down to 100, and was trying to just keep my adhesive and such for repairing weapons, just became a pain in the ass, every few hours to drop most of my common stuff just so I could store the 2-3 rarer stuff I found.   Plus I'm the kind that likes to hoard now, so I don't have to later, get as much scrap as I can get so that later can go play the game for a few hours without worrying.
---
I was thinking of getting back in and checking it with wastelanders but will have to wait longer, and not sure I want too with this stuff.
---
And of course deleting my steel down to 100 also meant that I would suddenly be out of steel when I wanted to upgrade and such, it was a constant pain of being out of scrap.
---
^ this *is* spam
---
Id maybe add a small tent you can fast travel to
---
More like, our future ends. XD
---
Id be happy with a fallout 3 remaster with first person aiming and maybe companions that dont die.
---
What there's bugs in the game I don't believe it! Lol
---
Right, right, right, but again... it's just a game. It doesn't really matter not enough for all this rage and vitriol.
---
gotta make up for the free dlc’s lol
---
I really doubt that though. They seem perfectly capable of maintaining ESO with no issues at even brought it back from nearly flopping at one point right before unlimited. I know cause that's when I stopped playing, then all the sudden it was the thing to play. 
---
The only case I see it being true is if they already know it's a sinking ship and they're just trying to squeeze it a little since bethesda had already rolled their name in the dirt on their own.
---
The thing is, and this goes back to before the game came out, I don't think enough people understood the plan with 76. The point was that we're not getting everything right away. That in almost real-time, we'd get more information about post-war Appalachia, that we're getting drip-fed the content. That way no one could 'beat' the game in a week and move on. The story will always be evolving and new things coming out. (This was clear as soon as people dataminded the NPCS right when the game came out.) The plan was always to slowly tell the story so the game would stay relevant longer. (VERY similar to how warframe does their storytelling now) I thought it was really smart! It was like reading a book and waiting for the next one in the series.
---
You said consumers acting how they want was a waste of time. And no the words speak too because without the words of all those news outlets/youtubers i guarantee EA wouldn’t have withdrawn.
---
That's weird,I logged in a couple of hours ago and nothing had changed. Didn't have to pay anything.   Just kept playing the game like I have in the past
---
Im enjoying it no lag
---
While this is a company doing bold shit and therefore relevant, it's so different that it's a yin-yang of related/unrelated but I'll upvote you for it being related-ish
---
No dude. All these people complaining and whining but nobody bitches when other games come out with this type of thing. It’s just another excuse for people to shit on this game. Even if they don’t play it
---
Just like fallout 4... Except with a better story and no fucking voice acted characters.
---
Ya dog.. Dont try so hard
---
Looking at some of the comments here all I can say is...
---
“A fool and his money are soon parted.”
---
1. 1 and 6 contadict themselves, also they could, amazing idea, make a new engine or don't release it until they fix it to a playable state. 
---
2. Pay to advantage
---
3. Thats good.
---
4. Your own server sounds like a pretty big feature, or a second unlimited scrap stash too.
---
5. People would use the atom shop if it wasn't made up of $20 skins or reused fallout 4 outfits. 
---
6. I was very happy when I heard they pushed it back, it gave me hope, but fallout 1st crushed that
---
Charging for servers because doing it for free would bankrupt the company 
---
And 
---
supporting a totalitarian regime that imprisons, murders and harvest the organs of humans guilty of such crimes as being gay or believing in a God 
---
Isnt comparable. 
---
Acting like it is, is why no one takes gamers complains seriously.
---
This means what exactly, when Atoms are fiat play money. Bethesda  could make 1650 the going rate for one emote next week.
---
I don't care how far into your teens you are. Fact of the matter is, if you think this is some of the most shocking things to happen. You have been under a rock. Look up and down for examples.
---
Fallout 4. Rainbow six. Tf2. Csgo. Any cod game. Skyrim. Almost any game I've ever bought 60 dollars or less ive been able to squeeze 100 at the very least. I finished fallout 76 and finished the "story" and didnt even log 60. I fucked around and did all I could but bugs and unrefined gameplay elements overall ruined it. I didnt get my money's worth. I got pitched a lie.
---
to be fair, on problem being able to store stuff that isn't scrap, by having unlimited stash you now have 800 pounds or what ever for the weapons and items rather then 50-90% of your stash being scrap, so in a way it at least alleviates the first problem.
---
Making rage posts IS a waste of time. The money is what talks everything else is irrelevant. Profit is all they look at.
---
what the fuck are you gonna boycott? Bethesda released this as their only source of income until their next actual games come around in 2020... there's literally nothing to boycott but this game(which most of us have stopped spending money on anyways).
---
Vocal "minority" shamed Blizzard into partially recanting their position on Blitzchung.
---
I wouldn't be so quick to be dismissive.
---
Running any vehicle in 4 lo costs a metric shit-ton. Subbing to a videogame would save me an astronomical amount once I’m finally reunited with my PC.  Which is the worse hobby?
---
It still isn’t. You can opt in or not.
---
Then name one game ever, like my post asked people to, that did something so absurd
---
While I agree, the money will in the end make this a better game, there is no excuse for the state it launched in. This is basically Bethesda asking you to pay more to fix their fuck up. Imagine a car manufacturer doing a seatbelt recall, but they want you to pay for the recall? Hell no. Bethesda, for the sake of integrity, had a duty to make FO76 the game they marketed it as. As of now it still does not live up to their own advertising of it. 
---
If people want to sub, fine, but that is a wallet vote and is promoting Bethesda to continue this behavior in the future.
---
FF14 had far more integrity than this game. They knew it was shit. They pulled it. They lost hundreds of thousands of dollars fixing it. But, in the end they saved their reputation. Bethesda is doing the opposite. They keep pretending the launch wasn't trash. Pretending the game doesn't still have massive glaring issues. They keep charging more money trying to make a quick buck. It's just a really bad look for them. They've taken a hard fall but they refuse to admit it.
---
I totally understand the outrage (which is justified) about Bethesdas decisions and i don't feel too comfortable paying subscription for a broken buggy game as Fallout 76 is.
---
But that been said.. I kinda sorta like the Fallout 1st. I mean.. I have bought atoms roughly once a month (from those themed sales that give an outfit too) so getting the subscription doesnt matter to me that much. And for a working adult like myself 15e ain't that much for something i like to do. For the subscription fee i get the amount of atoms i would normally get for bying atoms and i get the other perks that come with Fallout 1st as a bonus. 
---
But..
---
I won't be getting Fallout 1st (or even log in) until wastelanders finally comes out as the game has absolutely nothing to do right now. The game is boring asf at the current state.
---
When it involves bethesda lying to consumers to basically steal money it does.
---
Yeah, it's this day, not the hundreds of previous ones. You could mark all the days of the year as this and people still would not stop support this game.
---
They did it to themselves, literally if all they did was say ok  blitzchung we don't want politics associated with our games and gave him a slap on the wrist then made a formal stance of it not one person would have cared. It's because they went all crazy with the punishment and then punished 2 casters that had no fault in it. Blizzard has fucked up and made a big deal of something that should have been a small issue do not give them credit for anything.
---
No, as customers who purchased a product, we have the right to express unhappiness at more and more of the game being sliced out and put behind more and more paywalls. This isn't what we were promised. This isn't what we were sold. Its the "guys this is ok don't say anything and just let it happen" stuff like this that's helping enable this kind of stuff in gaming now. Don't be that kinda guy. Stand up for your rights as a consumer for the complete product you were promised and paid for. Not the product you got some of and then are required to pay even more for.
---
Little lies, stunning shows.
---
There was that ant simulator game who literally took all the kickstarter money and spent it on blow and hookers.
---
Plus a bunch of others. This is honestly pretty tame of a thing they're doing but the fanbase and... I literally can't believe I'm going to say this, but the clicks on something like this are going to blow up. 
---
People will be over it by wastelanders when they'll actually decide if the game is worth it or not.
---
WOW - I totally missed Fallout 76 at launch, just super busy with life. It bubbled up into my consciousness tonight and I googled "Reddit Fallout 76" as my first stop. Sounds like the game is a fucking shitshow! I'll just go back and replay Fallout 4 &lt;3
---
(Forgot to say - that website is fricking hilarious, loved it)
---
Howdy , I just purchused it and can confirm it is only for scrap . still it freed up a lot of space in my regular stash for legendarys .
---
This right here. Amen lol
---
Yeah but that is a pretty obvious solution. It’s tricky to track things with lots of qualifiers and different statuses, like weapons or amor. Junk should have always been easy.
---
Why are you even defending this? You are part of the problem! They're just going to keep adding more and more overpriced bullshit into the atomic shop because of people encouraging their scummy behavior!
---
King
---
ugh I hate when people brought this up. NO the sub there wasn't dropped. Not even a bit. It was only slightly changed so you can still play the game without sub if you deliberately want to have fucking miserable time. Go play ESO without sub, you can''t do jack shit witout your crafting space getting full in a literal blink of an eye. Not to mention how you lose access to at least HALF the dungeons/trials.
---
Hahaha... ya that was obviously bullshit!
---
Once every hour, on the hour.
---
This is also accurate but it's a layered thing and technically it was a game company doing bold shit but a different type of bold
---
Its not about wanting things for free. If you think that's all it is, then you are woefully misinformed.
---
Well you get to pick a new location now. You've probably seen some nice spots in your travels around Appalachia and you have the opportunity to make a new and wildly different CAMP if you want to. My favorite thing now is having a camp high up on the edge of a cliff with a beautiful panoramic view.
---
buying on ps4, and STILL cheaper.
---
Even ea premium subscription is far better...you get actual games, many of them, to play.  Gamepass as well provides actual value.  I want to say I was surprised to see this news, but I can't honestly say that. Broken game, followed by pay2win, now subscriptions....no shock really.
---
I paid the full price to get into the B.E.T.A, though I already knew it was gonna be buggy ride. My main interest was getting a foothold on the mechanics of the game before the majority of the players. Only used the Atoms I've earned ingame, and even then there's really not that much of a selection available. 
---
I could do away with extras and addons since the base game is enough for me, as most of the time I don't even realize they added anything new or fixed bugs. If I was really hellbent on getting a private server I'd hop back onto Fallout 4, since there's really not that much difference between a private server / world and single player instance.
---
I’m just memeing  but it hit close to home when we have to pay money just to unlock the ranger outfit
---
I’m still playing, I like the game and I like the friends I’ve made playing it. I just won’t give Bethesda any more money until they live up to their word and deliver some quality content.
---
The concept that someone still frequents the sub for a game they consider one of the worst is even more baffling.
---
At least if this was /r/Fallout I could understand you just keeping up on the series as a whole but fuck... Let her go, bro...
---
I know right. Jesus
---
I don't understand how they keep failing so hard. I like 76, I think it's ok. Not the best but just Ok, this however I can't excuse. I'm not gonna say I won't be playing anymore, will probably check out the Halloween event but I won't be on as often. Good will is at its lowest. Ah well at least I've gotten back into Cities skylines and download Nier Automata.
---
It's beautiful (T\^T). Everything I had hoped it would be. Even the links were what I hoped they'd be.
---
I still got the receipt motherfuckers!
---
There was internet. It just dialed up by phone and make clicky robot noises
---
I'm part of this conversation now too
---
Wyru***fli nas bez mydła... Nie ma szansy żebym pół wypłaty wydał na to. Trzeba będzie sobie bąmbelka zmajstrować, program Fallout plus, 500 złotych na  subskrypcje :O
---
I know but they did. Due to Bethesda Fan Bois is all I can figure.
---
I wasn't anything quiet like you, but I was one of the first people that joined the Morrowind boards, and frequently talked with some of the developers in their semi public chats, talking about mods, and games and such, and I'm pissed off too.
---
Can you call this a conversation I'm so confused
---
Hell ya bro I wish it was like that
---
r/humor
---
But my life isn't normal 😭
---
I liked it all better when it was straight up pay and then subscribe,  but the core product was actually good from the start. 
---
Content volume would never be enough,  but that's a given for the genre.
---
I mean... I’m 1300 hours into 76. I’ve gotten far more out of this game than the $60 for the base game.
---
It is now
---
I'd be happy if they would just do things right the first time, stop trying to reinvent the core fundamentals of Fallout, and LISTEN. TO. THE. COMMUNITY. Everyone loved Fallout, it was so good and still is. But with Fallout 4 and now Fallout 76, this title is quickly accelerating into a seemingly inescapable downward spiral. I'd love to see them just make things right, and I would be content. I would continue supporting Bethesda and buying their products. But after this, I'm not certain I can stomach anymore of them. This is such a major stab in the back.
---
Here are many dump fanboys that think either you like the game and are silent, or you don't like it and complain.
---
They can't grasp the concept that good things can also have their flaws und that we complain because we care and want things to improve.
---
&gt;Data needs to be stored somewhere...more stash equals more data...servers need to expand and upgrade to hold more data...
---
How weird then than every other survival games I played have unlimited stash space for materials, without charging anything for it! They must all be going bankrupt, right?
---
As far as the servers not being “new” or “raw” when you join them...if they hadn’t done that then there would be 12 x1k upvoted posts about how Bethesda ruined the value of red nurse outfits or blah blah b/c they’re so much easier to farm blah blah.
---
Adults have to make decisions ...only kids want to win both ways
---
&gt;Believing in free business practice so long as no one is being hurt isnt "anarcho-capitalism".
---
it is when you you think these business shouldn't be regulated. that's anarcho-capitalism.
---
&gt;I never said not to regulate anything at all like an anarcho-capitalist.
---
you did. I brought up unregulated practices several times and these were some of yours responses:
---
&gt;Loot boxes are just a form of gambling and that's fine
---
&gt;No matter how greedy a company may be is they arent hurting anyone it doesn't matter.
---
&gt;All that matters is 1. Are they hurting anyone? 2. Is it a sustainable and profitable buisness model?
---
the last one was not in response to me but it's just more of the same.
---
&gt;I said so long as no one is being hurt.
---
spoken like a true anarcho-capitalist.
---
&gt;Of course regulations should be in palace if something is a detriment to the society with no benefits.
---
like lootboxes? because even gambling is heavily regulated.
---
&gt;Try explaining how Bethesda's actions are hurting anyone.
---
you really need me to explain why anti-consumerism is bad? why releasing half finished products and shifting the risk to consumers is not a good idea? why lying through manipulative PR is a bad practice? why monetizing otherwise free features is not good for the community?
---
I have the same message for the same location for my camp/shop (on 3 different  characters) across from Green Country Lodge. My camp has been at the same spot for almost a year. Your camp must have been the one that when I would log on, my camp couldn't be placed.  Like you, building is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game and I had spend a lot of time redoing it to make it just right. I'm more pissed off about this than the p2w that came out today. The few caps that I don't have to spend to move the camp doesn't make up for all the hours and money spent in the Atoms Shop for camp items for my camp to have that right look.
---
Yes. It certainly didn't start with the armor you could buy  in morrowind. Everything is a scam. More than 20 versions of the same game and armor dlc in a single player game seems to be not. So who are you calling blind boy?
---
delicious pee and poo. good slave drink your shitpiss buy more atoms good boy
---
I have a feeling they wanted to sell Fallout 1st for $50/year but marketing said “dude, no one is going to pay &amp;50/year for this?!” So then someone said “let’s sell it for $100 and then after all the backlash we’ll reduce it to $50 and people won’t be so mad!” 
---
That’s the kind of stupid bullshit I’m expecting from this stupid company. Can’t wait for Cyberpunk... Final Fantasy VII Remake... The Outer Worlds... RDR 2 on my PC... time to forget Fallout 76 like I’ve forgotten the new Star Wars films. 
---
If they die to me now I’ll always remember them as FO1-4... and then it died.
---
Because that is bad marketing. Timed releases drives up hype for that item and entices people to buy things regularly.
---
Stuff like this is why I think the fallout series is an overhyped dumpster fire.
---
No right to complain? That's **communism**.
---
So you agree that it isn’t an rpg. Good to know, I guess.
---
This is hilarious. Give that person a medal!
---
Well when your CEO is permanently banned from banking you have to fraud people some other way.
---
Minecraft servers are free to download and run on your own computer. Not even talking about realms.
---
Thats an mmo
---
In practice **commmunism!**
---
Yeah but thats only 40 and you dont need game pass
---
I cannot argue with this
---
Correct
---
Lmao fuckin boomer.
---
They didn’t steal anyone’s money. The people who bought 76 or bought atom packs or are subscribed to 1st made a decision to give Bethesda money in exchange for a product.
---
Gaming to me is just one of many hobbies. I guess I'm not personally invested in gaming so it has no real bearing on my life. I don't expect great things of any company ever. Personally I enjoy the game. And if you don't then that's your opinion.
---
ESO was $60
---
they bumped it up a whole lot since you've played, right now it's sitting a 800.  
---
steel is something you should never hold onto in mass quantities, if you grab the Scrapper perk a single assault rifle breaks down into 19+ steel, a single trip through a Super Mutant base like West Tek nets you more steel than you could ever need at once.  Adhesive as well can be crafted on an as needed basis just by planting mutfruit, corn and tatos in your camp or by raiding farms.  Most scrap items can be easily gathered in bulk just by knowing the right spots and enemies and server hopping a bit.
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Yes you can blame bethesda for this. It is the same argument as "If X jumps from a building, doesn't mean you should also jump from a building".
---
And you stated it yourself that this is a bad thing. Why would you accept bad things just because they are not as horrible as they could be? "I got kicked against my shin, 5 times. It is not a nice thing but at least he didn't punch me in the face." And no, not the whole gaming scene does it. Just the extremely profit hungry, shareholder driven triple a devs and publishers.
---
Next thing that will happen is that they will give early access to the new update for subscribers. Which they delayed until next year but still pushed for this subscription model "all of a sudden". Alltogether with empty phrases like "thanks to the subscribers we could make the update even better." Which probably translates to: We added 2 more colour swapped npcs and a hazelnut bush.
---
Edit: If they had bundled this subscription model with the new update, the backlash would probably not be half as big as it is right now.
---
I played the BETA every time it was open. I have every fallout game. I was on the forums and reddit supporting them when it was just a mass of people spewing hate from the unfinished game and people quiting. 
---
But now, I no longer defend them. I hop on every now and then to play and was excited for more updates. But this pay to play crap has gone too far. $100 for a year of a few features? When I already paid $60 for an unfinished game that I had to redownload several times for literal DAYS.... and this is how you repay the fans? That's disgusting Bethesda.
---
I actually don’t spend my money on any of those and I have no idea what the fuck Dutch bros is, I never said I had a problem with spending money on entertainment but supporting shit and greedy companies like Bethesda does disgust me especially if you do it monthly, of course most people can afford the subscription but why would you pay for something they literally promised everyone? Private servers was something they announced months before launch and now it’s only going to be used by people can’t see how fucked this is
---
They flat out said the reason they’re not going to increase stash space because it will have negative effects on the server but of course it’s not a problem now that you have to pay for it, keep defending yourself with that excuse that because you work for most of the week that this “convenience” isn’t that bad, it’s literally that mindset that destroys games when their entire fan base abandons a game that could’ve been great
---
In the interest of logic calling it pay to win is a strawman
---
Fallout 1st treats paying customers, who bought the game full price, like 2nd class citizens.
---
Do i speak Chinese? Like i said twice the hats are worthless and common spawns. If at most someone who is desprate will Pay 1000 c for a hat but thats still unlikely
---
&gt;Im okay with the concept if it means new things will constantly be introduced. 
---
they won't. this sub is so naively hopeful. people here actually believed the limited stash was because of "server limitations"
---
However Watoga does have an underground parking garage system, that I think Bethesda could do something with. If you ever noticed, there are several blocked off entrances.
---
Haha i bought my copy during a sale. Had to see first hand what all the hate was about. It felt like an empty fallout 4 to me. But im a sucker for fallout, until i decide if outer worlds is something i can sub for it
---
Please sell the Fallout IP to a another studio, or handle it with love and care. Please.
---
People who pre ordered were lied to and even people who bought the game later on were promised something with a purchase that arguably greatly increased the temptation to purchase. They lied to consumers to "take" their money then flipped a 180 and didnt deliver on what they sold people on.
---
I missed the non part, fo76 is an mmo now.
---
It's bringing dozens of people (including the creator) entertainment, how is it a waste of time? Certainly a better deal than the actual subscription service.
---
Okay wanna know why? Really wanna get into this?
---
Back when I was 18/19 and playing Ultima Online in the 1990's I did the same thing like most of you. I raged anytime the Dev's made any change or put something in that I and others didn't like. And know where that got us? Nowhere.
---
Really! EA didn't come out and say, "My god you guys are right!!! What we did is wrong and we're sorry we did it! Please take a free month sub and we are so sorry!!!!" Nope rather the Dev's stopped talking to the community, shit still happened, I finally got pissed off and left and went over to Everquest where hey guess what? "Damn you EQ Dev's this is wrong and you need too!!!!!"
---
Oh and the list? Oh hey it go's on... People lost it with the Dev's on lets see if I can remember... Ultima Online, Everquest, SWG, Age of Conan, Unreal Tournament, World of Tanks, World of Planes, City of Heroes, City of Villains, Star Trek Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Battlefront 2004, Battlefront 2005, EA Battlefront, EA Battlefront 2, The Division, Destiny, Destiny 2, Division 2, Anthem, Mass Effect 3... Okay starting to see a trend here or should I keep going?
---
When has the community blowing up and screaming like you Op worked?!?! I'd really love to know and please don't give me some title like Final Fantasy or the like as I can point out the same BS happens over on those games too. The Dev's do something, all of you blow up about it, throw insults around to everyone and guess what? Not only does nothing change? But then the Dev's stop talking to the community and two weeks later know what I'm hearing? "Why don't the Dev's talk to us?" Gee I don't know... Maybe thanks in part to folks like you proclaiming how I'm a paid shill? Or how the Dev's are a bunch of greedy assholes?
---
Welcome to the real world folks and guess what? This shit happens in everything! Hey go over to r/SquaredCircle and ask the fanbase there how many times they felt the WWE screwed them over! Or hey go over to the comic book subs and ask about how Marvel/DC screwed up this month. Oh and lets not forget we have a new Star Wars movie coming out... I'm sure, I'm 100% sure no one is going to lose it over that like they did with Last Jedi/Solo!
---
Still whatever... I'll get downvoted and ignored and some colorful DM's telling me to kill myself as I'm not preaching the "I'M MAD NOW!" line like the rest of you as frankly? I really don't give a shit and just wanna play the f'n game.
---
Fixed it : * what other $60 game , has a $100 a year subscription fee that gives less content then the game.* 
---
Note: all future dlcs are free to both paid and non paying customers. We do not provide reach arounds.
---
I don't play the game? Keep making assumptions, I pre ordered the tricentenial edition and try each patch hoping the game gets better instead of worse over and over.
---
Keep making those baseless and wrong assumptions though, shows how little your argument holds water when you have to make shit up. Lol
---
See, it's not pay to win. It's pay to lose. Lol. Sorry about your scrap, though chances are Bethesda won't be of much help.
---
By using my basic grammar skills I can tell that you didn't purchase the "thing". Here's a free upvote.
---
What I think went wrong, even at the start, was the vision of the game. I had the feeling that the original intention was for the players to build up the world, with the trolls being a functional part of game play, i.e raiders. They had some of the pieces in place, but they kinda fell through, resulting in a game that felt more single player than multi. With the addition of private worlds, and later human npcs, Fallout 76 has done a 180 and begs the question, whats the point? Is there a difference between this private server versus me loading up a single player instance in Fallout 4, modded enough to resemble 76?  I thought the idea was to share our Fallout experiences as a community.
---
None of those things are slogans. Like, not even one. "The quicker picker upper" is a marketing slogan.
---
These are lies. They lied.
---
I mean yeah. Paying a subscription for fallout 76 is kind of embarrassing.
---
oh shit its only $40? LOL nvm.
---
edit: just realized you meant game pass is only $40. True lol I mean I guess technically you don't need the subscription either to play FO76 but definitely a stupid fucking move by BS.
---
Then you're clearly too young? At least you could search on how to progress. I had to wait for a magazine oo
---
The way I see it they're selling the ranger outfit for 13 bucks and I'm kinda interested since I get my worth in atoms. I'd cancel the subscription as soon as I claimed my rewards if I did do it .
---
I’m with you. People shouldn’t shame people for enjoying what they love. Hobbies are hobbies.
---
Lol I don't use player vendors as I mainly only am interested in items like legacy weapons which are worth more than max caps anyways. So vendors are worthless.
---
Thanks brotha i need the laugh rn! 😄🙏🏻
---
The trick is, Pete Hines gets to redefine the meaning of "DLC" whenever it suits him.
---
Okay?....
---
Nvm i lied its 60 lol
---
Gee sorry.... I just figured someone would want a complete set for over max caps.
---
I’m really surprised Bethesda is working more on new vaults, than the ones we already knew about, and were marked locations.  94 (vault raid), 96, and 63, which all three have been around since the game went live. Now we have 51 (NW) been around for awhile now and it’s still not even marked on the map, and now we have 79.
---
I'll never understand why Bethesda is the only company that gets free passes for releasing unfinished, buggy messes.
---
I mean I'm here and I was there for skyrim but I never felt like doing the bare minimum deserve any sort of credit at all. like when they broke features and fixed it in the next patch.
---
really? you really want me to thank them for fixing a problem they themselves introduced? that shouldn't exist in the first place? c'mon.
---
STOP BUYING BETHESDA GAMES
---
Can someone clarify this for me please? 
---
-	I purchased a game with the assurance it would not have pay to win features and one year later have now been told that it will in fact have pay to win features in the future. 
---
-	I was not made aware that the game I had paid for would  include extra features in the future that would be subscription only if I wished to use them. 
---
-	I was also told that this game “just worked” which a reasonable person upon hearing this would assume that the game should work as intended regarding server and game quality. 
---
-	I was also lead to believe this is a new game as it is called Fallout 76, not Fallout 4 and as a reasonable person should not be expecting to purchase items I had paid the developers of fallout 4 to create ( as in hairstyles and retextured fo4 outfits). 
---
Am I dumb or is this false advertising?
---
Dang, I wanted to say it.
---
do you get the atoms imidiately when you buy the subscription btw?
---
So is Fallout 76
---
You're actaully joking right?? What kind of poor mans excuse is that? Don't try to patronize me over something you obviously know nothing about.
---
Private servers are exactly that PRIVATE. In every single online survival in the existence of this world that has a private server system you are renting a private server to have a way of working In a domain that you or normally able to tweak. This means time goes on when you arent on, people can play on this server without the creator being online, additional tweaks like pve or pvp server, the privacy to allow who is on the server, and finally, your own resources that can only be touched by those who were allowed access. Fallout first has not a single one of these features and you're going to come up with a lazy excuse like that? 
---
If you wanna talk about adults making the decisions then they certainly did alright, by shooting themselves in the foot. I didnt care about any of the other problems with this, really I didnt, but with people like you around really remind me on how they actaully get away with this nonsense.  
---
I love this game, but you'd have to be a total idiot to try justifying any of this.
---
Oh but I'm not. This same complaints has gone on since long before this game rofl. "this should be free" "this should be base game" "this is too expensive". But it's fine, idc, keep telling yourself your on some holy crusade against corporate greed lol
---
You're *still* pinning some hope on Wastelanders? 
---
I don't know how Bethesda can more clearly convey they're not interested in RPGs any more, and have contempt for RPG fans. They want to make gacha shit for consumers that don't complain that they're being fed gacha shit. You got Elder Scrolls 6 already, it's called Elder Scrolls Blades. Todd is banking on this making you leave, because he's tired or trying and of having an audience that demands he try.
---
Fallout 76 is an mmo..
---
Is it massive? Yes.
---
Is it multiplayer? Yes obviously.
---
Is it online? Yes.
---
Does it have RPG elements? Yes.
---
Yes you do, so worse comes to worse it’s still a good deal for the atoms and skin
---
I'm sure the other games get their own drama in their own sub. I know for a fact runescape does.
---
I played the game heavily, and I've been back for a week and nothings changed. This is just a hilarious shock I was looking forward to semi decent update today.
---
The fact is, I don't know another game/company that's been this bold when they've been fucking up SOO bad since the start.
---
It was a nice vacation from all the "pleaaaase boycott this game with us" posts
---
“We want unlimited stash space”
---
“Out current servers can’t handle that for everyone... for a premium price we can make private servers to accommodate but you’ll have to pay for that piece of the pie”
---
“NO! FREE! I DON’T WANT TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I BOUGHT EVEN THOUGH I’VE GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF HOURS OUT OF IT AND GOTTEN MORE THAN MY MONEY’S WORTH!”
---
Maybe you need to look up the definition of MMO.
---
It needs to put you back in a lobby after a match... This to the menu bullshit is for the birds
---
This is incredible, but whoever made it is probably gonna get sued into oblivion (no pun intended) because they used Beth’s pictures and graphics lmao
---
Of all the shit bethesda has done. This is one I'm not entirely upset over. If a modder wants to get paid for his work, even make some supplementary income, I think its a great idea. That also means *hopefully* some more high quality work would come out, and not in the 4+ year this is a hobby I'll get it done when I feel like it timeline.
---
There's potential for something good.
---
The post is dishonest, Bethesda didn't decide to charge for fan made mods. They gave people a choice so they could charge for their work.
---
r/madlads
---
Is there a place I can set up this lawn chair? I have a cooler full of nuka colas to go get.... can you watch my spot.... thanks!!!
---
Keeping your scrap when switching worlds is another $10 a month fee.
---
Another one. Maybe you should look up the definition of MMO.
---
His stuff in the link is cool. I’ll give him that.
---
I been doing the robot on everyone i see lol
---
This wouldn't have gone over well in pre-Internet days. They just wouldn't buy
---
how did you get that enclave patch #offtopic
---
No its not what mmo elements are there besides being online? There’s no guilds no nothing
---
They must really be running out of cash to pull this stunt
---
Since this keeps coming up I’m just gonna start saying yes so, yes.
---
Fallout 76 was never marketed as an mmo. Only an online rpg
---
In the video game industry? It is and you haven't given an example of anything more absurd. To think I meant in life is just you having awful reader comprehension. Lmao are you 16?
---
Chill with the idiotic edits, jfc
---
It isn’t. It’s an mmo lite. Compare it destiny or the division and it looks absolutely stupid
---
I think a Fallout co-op game could still be pretty rad... Idk why when Bethesda wants to make a multiplayer game they just half ass an MMO
---
Why would anyone assume the servers would be launched as a finished and polished product? Who expects ANYTHING from Bethesda to be finished and polished at this point?
---
It is massive though, if it was just MO you would see the same players over and over. Maybe if characters were locked to single servers like WoW it wouldn't be massive, but you can hop to any other players world which makes it an MMO, it's not really locked at 24
---
I think these companies forget people have to already pay for to0 much, its not worth it for me to have to pay internet, the game itself and a subscription to play. Just like i cancelled cable tv that was over 120-150 bucks in favor of Netflix, Hulu which is cheaper. I will simply find something cheaper for my entertainment.
---
so a game that costs $60 to buy.... has micro-transactions.... multiple bugs and glitches and now Bethesda has the cheek to announce a $100 subscription fee. True you are not obligated to buy it but barely anyone plays it as it is so why bother with the $100?
---
Of course im still gonna play. Im only about 30hrs in and I really like this game. I really dont care about the subscriction

Heres what toddhoward says about that “Now, we do. Speaking at Bethesda's E3 2018 showcase, game director Todd Howard announced that Fallout 76 is a game played "entirely online." Every inhabitant of Vault 76 is a real person -- just like the player. That isn't to say its a massively multiplayer game though -- it's more like a more like a "shared world" shooter, similar to games like Destiny. When you play the game, you'll be on a map with a dozen or so other players. Not hundreds, not thousands - just a dozen. It is the apocalypse, after all.”
---
They're probably saying that because they know like 3 people will buy it
---
Are you trying to justify this by saying "I could be ruining the environment?"
---
Yes!!! New Vegas is the best one I've played. In the top 5 of my list
---
Well this is the first unique take on hating 1st I've seen today. Well done.
---
I guess? I don't know what I'm replying to anymore.
---
But I suppose a sub was much harder to do back then.
---
&gt; Then don't buy the subscription? wow, problem solved 
---
You do realize that the non-subscription game is now intentionally made worse because of this, right?  The game has obvious problems and they're selling the solutions instead of including them in the game people already paid for. 
---
Basically, everyone who doesn't subscribe will be playing a game that's made slightly worse on purpose. The only solution would be to get back in time and avoid buying the game.
---
So do your slow yourself?
---
If it's unthinkable people still are playing it, yet you like this dumpster fire of a game... I guess, which is it?
---
To anyone saying fallout 76 is an mmo read this article https://www.cnet.com/news/fallout-76-revealed-at-e3/
---
For each player and each item he owns you'll have a line in a relation table between the items and the players tables that holds the count yes.
---
Now that's a $15 well spent.
---
Nice. You're forgiven. Enjoy your outfit.
---
I’d like to work for Bethesda and then pull the shit they pull on their customers and see what happens 💁 
---
Yeah I can code that but it’s going be $10,000 a month or $90,000 a year if want. 
---
And it will be bare minimum.
---
[My reaction](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/576/281/52a.gif)
---
This shit isn't any more or less different than the crap beth has been getting since the game's launch. Imagine how confident they must be if they decide to charge even more money after all the hysterical backlash. This game sells. But some people can't accept that because it is not the way they want it to be. So they come screeching nonsense with 1,000-word essay. Fking losers lmao. Go outside or something. It's exactly like you said, it's a fucking video game A leisure. If you can't afford it, don't play it.
---
I hope it is even just a moderate success just to gnaw at you people.
---
Maybe you should read what howard said. “Now, we do. Speaking at Bethesda's E3 2018 showcase, game director Todd Howard announced that Fallout 76 is a game played  
---
"entirely online." Every inhabitant of Vault 76 is a real person -- just like the player. That isn't to say its a massively multiplayer game though -- it's more like a more like a "shared world" shooter, similar to games like Destiny.

---
https://www.cnet.com/news/fallout-76-revealed-at-e3/
---
It is literally the one and only thing on the disk that worked flawlessly as intended without a single bug at launch.
---
No problem! My current nord character is a blacksmith and while there are players who are crazy adidcted to ESO and can craft everything and never need to buy gear, theres many more that don't want to grind blacksmith levels to get to be able to use the style books and would rather shill out some gold they gold from dungeon crawling and just buy the armor
---
Maybe.  I just drank three 40’s, so who knows where this night will go.
---
I said from an outside perspective. I'm an insider, aren't I? I play daily.
---
my point is that, to a person who's not an insider, it's unthinkable that people are still wasting their time with Fallout 76. let alone paying even more money to play it """better"""
---
Back in my day it used to all be good news whopper snapper... Then they tried to go and make a multi-player fps...
---
ESO is not really the microtransaction game we want to emulate :( nty to $50 stash access anywhere
---
Come back to us again after Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI. Two games that won't have the Creation Club tacked on after the fact but built from the ground up to have it integrated. It will get worse and Bethesda is obsessed with nickle and diming its customers in every way they can that much is clear as day now.
---
I am not saying you should thank them, no.
---
Mistakes were made, but as you said yourself, they have fixed most of them, and continued their work on the game.
---
This hole "whining hype" though, it's just silly at this point.
---
“Yeah guys we’ll give you your private servers!”
---
ifyoupayforthem
---
If you decided to buy the game, that’s on you. You took the risk and buying any product comes with a degree of risk. 
---
I myself took a risk on 76 and I’ve enjoyed my time with the game.
---
Seriously. Every other person seems to like to come at Todd Howard for this, but I’m forced to wonder if he’s just stuck as the figurehead of this abortion, all so ES6 and Starfield can rise to his and his team’s vision. Todd even said FO76 was their plan to get the capital needed to continue making their staple single player games.
---
I may be assuming too much, but Todd Howard has done nothing in the past that would point to this kind of predatory monetization being his idea, to my knowledge. Just seems like ZeniMax being buttholes.
---
MDR
---
I don't need to download anything, but the extra storage space will give me peace of mind.
---
I pre-ordered it for like 40 bucks cuz of amazon prime lol
---
Yup but I think it's 2 bucks for a 2 month trial right now. Option to quit anytime
---
Or atleast the people who bought the power armor edition for $250 for the most lackluster game they have ever created.
---
Or when you could pay for the game and the DLC was the sequel game. I don't hate DLC or patches. I hate skeletons with the organs coming later in patches. Give me a full body and add extra arms
---
Dude it's like buying a steel knife, paying the price for a steel knife, and then opening up the package at home and you get a broken vibrator.
---
Good I hope it takes them months to fix it so pay for it and not get to use scrap boxes.
---
Stop with the edits, nobody likes that. The private servers will most likely be much more stable tyan normal ones, there's gonna be a max of 8 people there and most times probably up to 4 compared to over 20 on a normal one
---
I'm 37 only thing before me was atari. Yeah we bought book guides to certain games lol
---
Thank you!
---
Don't you want to pay again for a game that came out almost a year ago? Don't tell me you don't want that Ranger armor that clearly isn't bait on a trap.
---
The idea will be a success. Bethesda knows their audience; those who still put up with FO76 are the kind who will no doubt buy into this, even if begrudgingly.
---
No one cares. Putting money into modding poisoned the well for everyone, not just modders.
---
Arent bananas way more expensive than potatos?
---
This is built as an mmo. Not a battlefield type game. If you compare it to the number of multiplayer online games I see your frustrations, but veiw it as an mmo, which even the great wow had a rocky first few years and went through many changes. All with an upfront cost and subscription. Bottom line is a year ago 12$ got you some atoms. Now 12$ gets
---
 much more. Is it all they promised... No.....is it improvement.....yes.
---
I certainly did not think you meant in real life. I didn't think that was something I had to point out. To think that I meant real life.... You guessed it! Is you having a shitty comprehension. Me telling you to look up and down... Was not literal. There examples in your own thread. Gj.
---
Which is all well and good but at the end of the day they aren't exactly listening now are they? You can "stand up for your rights" as much as you like it's not going to stop them from doing under handed shit like creating problems and then selling you the fix or making a straw hat the equivalent to $7 in real life currency. We all know how Bethesda operates but yet you are all so surprised by it and get up in arms because you were stupid enough to buy something you knew full well would be a a complete and utter let down. When F76 came out they clearly stated that there weren't going to be any NPCs but people still bought the game and then complained about the fact that there were no NPCs. I pre ordered the tricentennial version of the game and have played F76 since BETA and know all too well the frustration this creates but posting and moaning about it wont help anything. It never has. They will keep making money regardless so stop buying into it stop spending money on things that are known to be broken and maybe they will be forced to fix it.  Unless the "DATA" tells them otherwise.
---
Let's not find out
---
Allright then, call it "pay to make your life easier and the game more enjoyable". Still doesn't make it okay to sell features that should have been there at launch for free...
---
“The majority”yeah definitely dude sure
---
For $5.99 you can have all that.   Just pay the sub
---
It claimed to have a lot of things, and didn’t deliver the promised things.
---
Yes it is about that first M. Massively. And that is hundreds or even thousands of players together in the same server. That is what a MMO is.
---
cool so I can play for a month and take a break as needed.
---
Yeah I guess I do t mind too much. They've earned it from new Vegas alone
---
Thanks for the honest appraisal, hopefully saner minds will prevail at bethesda to rethink these new features and in particular the pricing for them.
---
Worth, I'd support him in a GoFund me case haha
---
fixed "most" of them is arguable. bugs from the beta remain. bugs being reported daily are ignored. my items still disappear, just yesterday I lost a bundle of gunpowder. I know it's nothing, my point is that "what if it was a legendary item? **again**?"
---
and the worst part: these are things that shouldn't happen. they shouldn't exist from the very beginning. they don't deserve credit for doing the bare minimum that's expected of them, that's my point.
---
If it was a 1 time fee, I think they would be dumb, but I could justify it somewhat...but a sub just for stuff that should have been there on day 1...Bye Felicia.
---
I'm 30. I feel less old now. That's nice.
---
Whoever wrote it needs to update the scrap box to mention its a crap shoot that may or may not devour all your junk.
---
Name one. "If you think this is the most absurd thing to happen" 
---
You're most likely 16 and have no idea what you're talking about. I just have the inkling that you are not old enough to even be able to comprehend the issue
---
Why is nobody downvoting this shit?
---
An outside perspective, people won't even think twice... Nevermind enough to get a chuckle out of it.
---
60 Minutes isn't doing an exposé on Bethesda. The only people that give a shit one way or the other are internet assholes like you and me.
---
Is $5/mo for the PC version the regular price or is that a sale? 
---
Because that's a pretty darn good price...
---
You contradict your self. You want them to do things right, yet complain about the delayed release of Wastelanders, which would have been delayed to make sure it's relatively big free. Get over it man, stop complaining. Play the game or don't. No one is asking you to buy a sub.
---
Enjoy it last year was when i actually started to feel like an old dinosaur lol
---
This ass fucking is brought to you in part by Bethesda, cause fuck the fans that’s why.
---
Right but you can add any player and play with them, and there's a massive amount of players, pretty much the only issue is having hundreds of players in one server for like a giant PvP battle
---
Here's to hoping.
---
Agreed.  40s are never a good idea but I have to pay for a 2 thousand mile flight (long story), which ate up my savings after a trip to Canyonlands National Park and...
---
I have been messing around with this all evening. It seems around the 20 minute mark is where it totally closes the server down and everything you built will go away. But if you leave and come back within that time frame your workshops are still there. Sometimes they have to be reclaimed. 
---
Now if you totally close the game or crash it will erase everything you built in your workshops regardless of you go back into it right away.
---
Yeah I was looking all over for the witch but it's not included from the looks of it. The text says "[Vintage Halloween Decoration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/636796141098369035/unknown.png)" which doesn't list what that includes. The wall decor category with that name is 5 items and doesn't have the Witch. However it has a [Cat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/636796502668345346/unknown.png) instead which isn't in the bundle pictures.
---
I’m sorry but why the fuck did you pay for it in the first place, jesus fucking christ
---
are we sure there is that much canvas to go around? i heard its in extremely short supply and rare now
---
That's the biggest justification imo, if you have the money and spend it on atoms anyway it's like getting a ton of stuff and atoms at a fraction of the cost.
---
Maybe "slogans" isn't the right word, but it's just marketing mumbo jumbo. I've already said it, but "it just works" is an ambiguous phrase. As long as it fucking boots up for most people, "it just works". "16x the detail" is also true, because they were talking about LoD and lighting and shit. Which has improved. Those weren't lies, just terms that were there to market it.
---
Did Bethesda actually say Wastelanders will be free?
---
You still took the risk and it didn’t pay off. C’est la vie.
---
yeah except this buggy, unfinished mess is every Bethesda game.
---
Why are you posting that to me?
---
You get that Elder Scrolls Blades *was* ES6 0.1, right? Fallout 4 will be the last great Bethesda single player open world RPG ever made.
---
100 bucks to play.. alone? I love the fallout series. This game is a huge joke give me a freaking break
---
How can you trade in an online activated, online only game?
---
I didnt mean to im on mobile so the formatting is weird.
---
They even stole the name from Roosterteeth's member program, the goofballs
---
It's shit all the way down
---
Two words: false advertising.
---
Thou art forgiven
---
I can guarantee it will be free
---
Jim Sterling did. AngryJoe, too. people who don't play Fo76 daily or extensively. most news outlets as well.
---
and the general consensus is "lol people still play Fo76? \*sensible chuckle\*"
---
I have played plenty of MMOs so I know what they are and Fallout 76 isn't one. It is missing the most important "Massively" part, by being limited to 24 players or whatever it is.
---
If it’s your first time playing it, it’s not bad really and actually has good story telling given the restrictions they placed on themselves. But for those of us who have pretty darn near exhausted all content that the game has... this is a kick in the teeth.
---
I’ll just play both
---
Are you the author or one of the author's alt accounts?
---
Same lol
---
Any form of loot box. I'm 12 I don't care. 16 year olds are old enough to comprehend this. But I'm tired of making you look like a kackasse. Leave me alone.
---
I've noticed areas where it commonly lags and stutters are a lot smoother now. 
---
Running a silo seemed to be smoother as well. 
---
Things in general seems to register faster or almost instantaneously.
---
How can you guarantee it will be free?
---
I feel this way too.  So much kneejerking from people don't even play or read patch notes
---
Keep defending a company fucking you over, man. We should be banding together as a community against this nonsense.
---
Is this just on one platform or all platforms?
---
everyone getting F'd over is quite funny, not gonna lie.
---
especially after months of me warning people about disappearing items and getting downvoted for being an alarmist.
---
It didn’t really though. It did but they also changed it to include double the content
---
Yup, you are woefully out of touch.
---
The sad part is it's a deal if you buy it if just for the atom.
---
See but that’s the thing. People aren’t making it about that. They’re freaking out and calling it pay to win which is ridiculous. I can agree that the game still needs core work. And I feel that most people are more mad that this paid optional thing came out before anything else. Which is more fair than what IS being bitched about.
---
But just because this comes out doesn’t mean the game isn’t going to get the work it needs. It’s all just steps.
---
Iunno. I like dinosaurs.
---
FFA needs to be a thing. And cheat prevention.
---
The subscription is completely optional. You are not forced to get it like on some other online games. Since launch of the game i have roughly bought subscription fees worth of atoms each month so for me everything else that comes in the package is a win. And for me, a working adult, 15e a month for a hobby ain't nothing. That been said, i won't be getting Fallout 1st until Wastelanders comes out (or even log in) since the game has absolutely nothing to do atm.
---
The reason they are doing this is because the game is not making money for them. And they are a company that is there to make profit. There are less and less people playing this buggy mess and maintaining servers etc cost money. I rather see them eat their words and promises than see the game totally shut down. Which i actually believe is not that far away (if i were a betting man i would bet on 3 years total lifespan for this game).
---
Don't let the negative sentiment from us veterans sway you.
---
This game has $20 worth of content and then some. Just don't expect to get much from it after you play through the quests. You'll get a decent month of play out of it, well worth the shelf price if what you enjoy is the lore. 
---
The sentiment around here is mainly due to us all being level 100+, having god tier weapons and no reason to use them or chase after more.
---
Cringe
---
I bet all my junk scrap it will be free DLC
---
Two words: good night
---
*cough* "eso" *cough cough*
---
Lool i had a guy emoting on me at his camp then i busted out the robot &amp; he went in his room &amp; closed the door 🤣
---
No one complained when elder scrolls online had their subscription service come out for $15 dollars a month. It’s the same as eso+ but u get it $2 cheaper and ur own server, but nooooo lets all jump on the bandwagon and be haters
---
Be careful me &amp; many others have lost all junk just by using that box
---
These fucking greedy cunts... they need to line up every single corporate suited asshole who pushed for this and let us tee up with golf clubs on all their nuts. 
---
Talk about fucking over whatever good will you had for creating decent games that people enjoyed. Completely lost the plot, and all that karma evaporated.  
---
Get fucked, Bethesda, you mothafuckas completely lost your way.
---
Amazing that despite being one of the first they still managed to screw it up.
---
This is correct, lotsa people who don't play FO76 are currently having a chuckle at its expense, here's one example:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/10/23/fallout-just-gave-people-reason-play-outer-worlds-instead/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/10/23/fallout-just-gave-people-reason-play-outer-worlds-instead/)
---
I only plan on doing the month so I get it as well. Been waiting for this. I gotta support future NCR of west Virginia
---
I feel like most of the community would really care about this stuff if it wasn’t for the rough start and extreme posts on the media. I just got on fallout 76 yesterday and just kinda played giving no thought on the membership because I don’t buy these things anyway. I read the perks of it and just thought, “huh, that’d be neat to have” then I just moved on.
---
Unique item hoarding will become more prevalent with junk being weightless, so it will br a much bigger burden on the servers.... The effect of non unique items was always nullified, as they are just a number in a database that has no consequemces to the server. Lime absolutely zero. The problem was that they forced us to keep both the junk and unique items in one container so I guess their code was/is so bad that it cannot differentiate unique items from non-unique items if they are in the same container... Or they just intentionally showed you how tedious and unfun it ia to habe a weight limit for your junk, so you would buy the scrapbox asap amd actually play the game it should have been from the start if it was designed with player-friendliness in mind and not dollar signs.
---
They'll fix it in 7 days tops fucking hacks
---
Do you guys not have wallets?
---
pics?
---
If they made it a freemium game i might even play it
---
Paid DLC, wouldn't surprise me anymore, used to give a lot of 'benefit of the doubt' to bethesda as they used to have a certain level of quality in their products. Unfortunately I don't feel thats the case anymore, even going back to Fallout 4 and seeing the CC items, i wonder whether bethesda sees a popular well made mod and then half-asses their own and adds a price tag.
---
What i am more concerned about with the wastelanders update would be the implementation of significant numbers of scripted NPCs by a developer that traditionally requires several spaced out patches to fix or just outright ignores the NPC bugs entirely.
---
this!
---
Invite your freinds? No they well  raid your server unwanted n canniblize u  n loot you   i guess private worlds are great way to see whose true friends :/ but i wish the world was invite only or access list
---
Tried, as borderlands and division 2, but I don't like looter shooters. Shooting everything always without doing something else is boring as fuck for me
---
I'm pretty sure most people here already subbed
---
That game releasing is reason enough to play it ... 76 has nothing to do with it
---
Me 3
---
I hope you're on ps4 cause I'll take that bet.
---
this is good and also a cautionary tale in terms of domain control lmaooooo
---
&gt; “We want unlimited stash space”
---
Because based on ALL of their previous games, this was the norm. And according to them the only reason it wasnt for this game was due to server performance issues.
---
&gt; “Out current servers can’t handle that for everyone... for a premium price we can make private servers to accommodate but you’ll have to pay for that piece of the pie”
---
Except the things that grant that increased storage space can be used on public servers, so the argument they once had now holds no water.
---
&gt; “NO! FREE! I DON’T WANT TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I BOUGHT EVEN THOUGH I’VE GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF HOURS OUT OF IT AND GOTTEN MORE THAN MY MONEY’S WORTH!”
---
I am perfectly fine spending more money, but not for things that honestly should have been in the game to begin with, but are being fed to us bit by bit.
---
What platform are you on?
---
AHAHAHAHAHAJHHAHAHA
---
It's truly a Bethesda way to implement a patch. Screw over your detractors and supporters in one simple wave of the scrap box.
---
Good one.
---
It's really no wonder they keep doing this shit when everyone is like "oh grrr I'm so mad about this but here's my money"
---
at that point in time everyone thought "private servers" meant actual, local servers you could host, not a premium subscription service.
---
so it's safe to say it's just going to be an extension of the Fallout 4 creation club. get ready to pay for them mods!
---
I know you all realize these things are implemented by execs who don't give a shit about anything but making another buck so I don't know why it's surprising at this point.
---
Ok so its a miniscule multiplayer online game then, gotcha.
---
Play Ark then. No wait forget i said that lol
---
Yup.. I have spend roughtly that 15e every month on atoms since launch so i see this a win.
---
They can't just make a good game, so they want you to donate 100$ on a very shitty one that you have to spend more money to buy, sounds logical
---
So sorry brotha, damn!! I really dont know how they will handle this, even a refund isnt gonna get countless hours of vault steel back for me😌
---
over in the land down under we are getting punished by Bethesda by them doing the 12 months thing to 180$
---
I just enjoying my coffee with the "scrap box deletes my scrap I pay for it I want my scrap back" posts
---
Not sure.
---
you paid for a membership, for some reason i don't feel sorry for you in the slightest
---
Aslo your stupid scrapbox deleted my all my scrap  :/ when the server crashed
---
the assholes are not the ones pointing ouy bullshit I'm afraid....
---
You literally just countered your own "complaining doesn't work and they don't listen so don't do it" arguement. You said yourself people were mad at no npcs. Yet because so many people raged, they listened and now we have Wastelanders coming. But nice try. You shills need to try harder. Your arguments are so flimsy and bad.
---
I doubt mod support is coming especially with bow private servers aren’t actually a server that you’re paying like in the days if battlefield but just the equivalent to pressing the “join solo world” option on gta online.
---
You know, I enjoyed the game to an extent, it was an okay 10 dollar purchase (i got it from cdkeys because i know the game isn't worth anything more than 10 bucks), and i was pretty excited for Wastelanders, but since they introduced this desperate cash grab, i feel pretty bummed out.
---
Stunt on them lmao
---
Too bad because we we got was an unpolished turd.
---
Ya. I'll prolly throw down on it in next free weeks cause of the atom.
---
Bah I'm still waiting for my 16x the detail
---
Go vault boy !! GO
---
So how long before Bethesda just forces everyone to rebuy the game?
---
At this point I doubt modding will be free....
---
Probably it will ended up being like creation club in fallout 4.
---
Can you prove this? Not skeptical just concerned
---
I agree there, not saying by any means are there not problems. But no. 1 problem I see is the expectations vs the reality of it. Bethesda  is going to listen more to it's atoms shop customers, what company wouldn't? As for the base game, it's had quite a bit added and they are trying new things. Just like most other MMOs out there.
---
Or a wild suggestion here, let's use our brains. You and the rest of the clowns buy this subscription and this motivates Bethesda to further focus on MTX additions and delay updates/fixes even further and considers hiding all updates behind the subscription, thanks to you and others this game gets worse for everyone because you're paying a sub.
---
It's like taxes, except where it's nothing like taxes and more like Business taking advantage of gullible people. You pay money, they know you'll never leave if you're still here and subbing, they throw up more purchasable goods, Business 101. You're just a wallet to them.
---
I wish I was. It's Washington Post dude
---
You see, all those things don't earn money. So Bethesda isn't particularly interested.
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
I fully expected to have to buy it but i'm upset it's tied to this whole service.
---
You see The Outer Worlds today and wonder where the 16x detail Todd mentioned went and why 76 looks like shit compared to TOW.  Literally Obsidian is a smaller company and they managed to create a 10x better looking game than a fucking "AAA" publisher.
---
gta is a better replacement to red dead
---
When wastelanders comes out they’ll release their “mod support” which will the last half of wastelanders that you need Too pay 12$ worth of CC points to play.
---
lol....
---
Wait you mean where they actually 'Listen to the players' like they say in every damn atomic shop update, item fix/nerf?
---
I will try it for a month to see what it’s like, if it ever arrives.
---
All they had to do was say that 90% of the new features are free, and you can pay a $10 monthly subscription to help fund the game for the other 10% of the features (and an allowance of atoms each month). 
---
I would have gladly paid for a subscription and supported the game, and I bet many more would have too!
---
&gt; Still the Watelanders DLC is free, and this optional subscription with small extras is juat an option for fans who enjoy the game and don't mind paying extra to support Bethesda. 
---
The scrap box and the ability to create private games should definitely be in the base game. 
---
Seriously, people supporting this are the reason why companies like EA and Activision (and now Bethesda) are becoming more and more greedy. It's making the entire industry worse.
---
Is there an underworld editor competition about which one gonna make the worst bad buzz this year ?
---
This is a non-ending cycle of "Hold my beer" out there..
---
Does it ever bother you that this is the thing you care this deeply about in your life? A service in a video game you don't even have to pay for?
---
Asking in general. I just don't think my blood pressure could survive being this angry all the time. And I've seen nothing but these posts all day.
---
Actually, freeing up space allows more flexibility in dropping weight reduction perk cards, allowing a more focused combat build.
---

---
I don't understand.  Are they doing this on purpose?  How do they keep fucking up EVERY SINGLE TIME?  Is there nobody at the company going "maybe let's put this off until shit dies down" or "let's be real, fellas, I really don't think anyone will thank us for this subscription thing."?
---
Wastelanders can never be good enough to outweigh the mistakes made with this game. Wastelanders can never be good enough to outweigh the mistakes made with this game. *Wastelanders can never be good enough to outweigh the mistakes made with this game.*
---

---
This is the worst way to do this by far, and the most silly / misguided.
---
&gt; Now they’re the epitome of greed in the gaming industry
---
/r/nba2k would like a word...
---
Thanks man, big yikes
---
You saw my comment...I stand by it.  A month from now everyone will be fine with it or not...if not, don’t pay for it.  But oh do please give me a break for not joining the negative complainathon...I find it relentless and dull.  The OP pointed out a bunch of things I think are spot on, and once people stop pretending to be surprised when Beth does what they’ve been doing progressively since beta, and expect each patch to be a mess b/c they apparently don’t have a QA dept, then maybe the whining masses might do more that complain.  Until then I’ll enjoy what there is to enjoy, and since I’m an adult I’ll pay or not, can’t see becoming a yearlong subscriber, but the OP is 100% correct...Today I bought the best Atom bundle yet, and I’ll make the best of it 😉
---
Wow, I honestly can't say I'm surprised!!🤦‍♂️
---
I like that EPIC/Fortnite show what is inside the loot llamas before you spend your V-Bucks on them with the X-Ray tab. That is a nice change. So you really know if you want to buy one or not. And I will give credit to EA that they usually do publish games that are in a pretty good, finished, unbuggy, and not crashing constantly state. I'm still not buying their games though as I have been once bitten twice shy by many of these AAA games and you know not buying Anthem felt good, and I have no intention of buying Fallen Order either. I don't feel like I'm missing anything.
---
Would be home in near enough to 40mins
---
Finish half hr early Fridays, so tomorrow may be easier to match up if you’re already off
---
I've never run around with scrap on me for long.  
---
I can do all those things you mentioned, anyway. Maybe I've just been intelligently managing my inventory?
---
When did you notice you lost it?
---
I’ve dealt with it. I’ve put up with everything. I’m just ready for a form closure.
---
EDIT: I care more as a fan of the franchise. I loved FO 3. Sad to know we will never get a game as great as it.
---
I was shocked when found out that tricentennial edition turned out to be just a skin pack.
---
Bethesda is becoming such cancerous devs
---
Now, not when it first launched.
---
A "ftp option" on a game we already paid 60$ for..... IF the game was free then MAYBE this shot would be justified
---
Private worlds aren't a permanent place for us. Just a peaceful retreat.
---
I'd understand charging 100/year for a persistent server (hell, maybe more).
---
This lame-ass attempt of a 'private' server should be free.
---
If I had Reddit coins, I'd give you Gold or Silver.
---
Yo all of yous r the same people that pay $9 for your Minecraft server, and $15 for elder scrolls online eso+ (1500 crowns, and unlimited storage) don’t see anyone talking shit about those absurd subscription pay to win experiences
---
This is hilarious!!
---
If you’re reading this dude, good job
---
TLD3?
---
What? You think today's response on this sub was a free pass?
---
Bethesda stopped getting free passes from a good portion of the community since Fallout 4. Don't let posts like this distract you from that. Look at the forest from the trees.
---
what a big fat FU to bugthesda!
---
lmfao
---
Like is it really that surprising or funny that other people can enjoy and support things that you don't?
---
Pillow talk
---
I never knew STUPID was spelled BOLD. I did not even know it was the same word. I guess Bethesdas dictionary differs from mine.
---
Why are you on a fo76 sub?
---
Oh it shows.
---
all of them. people initially thought it was just on Xbox and only if you used scrap boxes built by other people but now it's happened on PS4 as well and with people who have only used their own box.
---
nobody seems to be able to identify the issue only that it often happens after a disconnect. so it's kinda like playing russian roulette, like everything else in this game.
---
Let's build a wall around bethesda and make them pay for it!
---
Look what todd thinks of it 
---
I wasn't sure if Washington Post had "content contributors" that act as reporters for websites like Forbes, Huffington Post, or Cracked.com. A content contributor is basically just a blogger they use to fill up space in their website article section and aren't actually employees of the website. Seems like he's an actual reporter though, but I did think that said Huffington Post at first
---
That's Bethesda being Bethesda. Can't stick the landing.
---
Hahaha ah yes this is gold
---
Why would they code their items differently?  Isn't it easier to have and item object where you just assign stats to?  What sort of moron codes objects differently for no reason in a way that fucks up servers just by keeping tack of them?  And storage is the same, it's just pointers to object.
---
Wooww. It gets worse. Guys this is insulting. How could they believe this would work. Nostalgia only gets you so far - super disappointing
---
Mmo= massively multiplayer. This is just a basic multiplayer game.
---
Enjoy your gold, this is amazing.
---
For the love of God, please fix your post format.
---
nope , that's  playing failure 76
---
I built the box &amp; added all but bulk. Then joined friends private server added broken down bulks at his camp, went to help a trade in adventure &amp; my stuff was gone within about 15-20 mins total
---
If you think they are bringing back NPCs because we as consumers wanted it then I'm sorry to tell you but you're wrong. I'm betting it wont be a "free update" either. They are bringing back NPCs because they want to. To Bethesda your voice doesn't mean shit  it's your money they want so they announce that they are going to bring back NPCs in a bid to take the bitter taste of pay to win out of your mouth when they finally announced it but obviously it didn't work. Do you think that the wastelanders delay and the introduction of PTW is merely a coincidence? Not likely. They need our money and we keep buying into it.
---
I like getting fucked.
---
the way I see it they don't deserve any better than people who release broken, unfinished games on early access or kickstarter and then run with the money.
---
because that's exactly what this is.
---
My guess is that the reason wastelanders was delayed was due to not having enough funding. So the quickest and most reliable way of getting cash was to implement a monthly service with stuff that people have been asking for. Shady, I know. But if they have this source of income who knows what is to come in the future
---
In my personal experience the scrapbox is "pay to lose all of your junk"
---
I'd rather do that than pay for a private server just to claim every workshop and not be "griefed."
---
I totally get you, and ironically I agree with you
---
But I am probably gonna buy this, I was the sucker that buyed liberty prime skin for $18
---
And Ive wanted the NCR armor since launch
---
Like I could be the guy saying «hey its my money, I can use it how I want» which I intend to do, but I am part of the bigger problem, giving the signal to beth that «hey this is ok» so for that I say sorry
---
I’m building a camp rn and haven’t logged off so maybe that’s why I haven’t experienced it. I’ll be sure to take all my stuff when I log, thanks man. I’m sorry this happened, make sure to submit a ticket for as little as it’ll do
---
Meh
---
Bethesda has been moving away from rpg for a couple of games. This is more rpg then 4 or Skyrim. But to be sure it's no path of exile.
---
Remember that time during Christmas they advertised items as being half off, but the listed "sale" price was actually the full price?  That's illegal but they did it anyway.
---
Outer Worlds is getting really good reviews. Comes out tomorrow. Made by the makers of FO1/2/NV
---
I uninstalled fallout 76 today,
---
Now i have enough memory for MW and outerworlds, and then CIV REV 5 coming to console in november? 
---
Bethesda made the choice super simple.
---
Damn that is to damn perfect.
---
Sure is. Nice valid point you made there bub
---
love it lol
---
Truly inspirational, he should work for a video game dev and publishing company.
---
*Oh, wait...*
---
I'm so sorry for you, but this is such a Bethesda moment.
---
$15 a month and it's still a total fucking catastrophe.
---
or: you could learn to stop worrying and love the bomb.
---
Whales
---
I didn’t make it but thanks, some dude on 4chan it looks like.
---
To each their own my guy
---
Well you you know what they wanted to do ... they wanted to release Wastelanders and then hit us with this after. A little honey and vinegar at the same time. 
---
But unfortunately, Wastlanders continues to be a technically impossible pipe dream with this engine that hit its ceiling of limitations five years ago.
---
Everyone is downvoting this shit. 0 is as low as it'll display for the original post, and these BGS shits haven't commented anywhere in here just to avoid that exact assfucking.
---
Hypothetically if it came in an atom bundle would you buy it?
---
Absolutely thanks, please dont use it for anything valuable just yet! Waiting to hear back, they took all my details so far so thats a good sign 😅
---
I played ark at launch. That literally was unplayable oo no dinos for me.
---
Just like any whore. You’ll get used to it
---
Deal!
---
Why did you support the scam? Do you want gaming to get more expensive?
---
so butthurt:D
---
Or they can remove the scrapbox all together and just not bring shit like this into the game.
---
Have you gone back into adventure?
---
I ask because they said you can still benefit from the stash box after cancellation. 
---
I want to know how that works. I kind of imagine the junk gets switched to your regular stash and you can't add to it until you drop below 800. There are a multitude of problems with that, such as you can't take items out and expect to out them back in. 
---
The other way is the stash box is now and forever yours to be used in both adventure and private. 
---
Abd of course there are probably hundreds of other ways it could be implemented. Can you or someone verify?
---
I mean that's a pretty standard thing nowadays. Beta's are marketing and maybe for increasing server capacity.
---
I would. No whale here. I just enjoy the game and it's  a lot of stuff for 12 dollars. I just wish the rest of the shop was such a deal.
---
I'm all for this update... But this is absoulty gold! Wonder if Bethesda will sue for likeness. Not much they can do about the ip.
---
Who the fuck are you to tell me how to spend my money? I do what I want. Developing content costs money. Those who buy the membership are helping fund Bethesda so they can create better content, and who knows maybe if enough people do it you freeloaders will get some free content out of it too.
---
He isnt helping keep the game up. He is telling Bethesda's it's ok to charge more for less.
---
Same here😅
---
Tell me lies 
---
Tell me sweet little lies

(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)

Oh, no, no you can't disguise…

If you asked me the same question like yesterday I could’ve said yes but now, no

And switch out the maps. Would love a random choice between the two.
---
Well Acid, steel and even black titanium may have difficulty now, because of the paying user's ability to hold workshop without any reprecautions.
---
I stopped playing since February. I was planning on making my return with the release of this server stuff. Then I found out how much Bethesda fucked us in the ass. Uninstalling the game and going back to NV.
---
20 players in the same map is not what I would call massively multiplayer. Not even close.
---
The chosen ones, hahhhaha
---
#Never forget; Horse armor
---
True, not an mmo in that sense. Meant their business model and update implementation. Which is what I think most people didn't understand from the jump. Compare it to F2P mmo business models and you'll see they are doing what they all do. The consumer had different expectations imo
---
oh, wow. haha. sorry friend.
---
not really, though.
---
I think its gonna either be where the npcs come out of or its gonna be a new raid kinda leaning more towards the first idea.
---
well its NOT private and the website says it is.   Its directly 100 percent false advertising.
---
The PC NCR Ranger mod is available, sorry console owners:

[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/437](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/437)
---
Could you at least explain what it does and what happened in my situation
---
This is beautiful.
---
*Massively multiplayer* online role playing game.  20 people in a game is not *massively multiplayer*. Not even close.
---
I brought ps plus just for fallout 76. I thought that maybe we'd get something free like neally all other online games but everyone still has to pay for a subscription and the only good thing about it is the NCR armor
---
The game isn't bad. Just don't fall prey to the micro transactions.
---
There's a fine line between greed and delusion. Not buying the next TES or Starfield.
---
I could be wrong, could be something simple you left out.
---
but there's a bug with the scrap box. multiple people reporting their junk just going poof.
---
Oblivion was their last rpg.
---
Oh, I was unaware. For me it says -2, not 0. And yeah, that's typical of BGS, they always hide out until the rage dies down and then release a statement.
---
Same.
---
You know what, OP? I can't either. I look like a clown because while I
---
My friends mocked Fallout 76 and its state, all its problems, I stood by it trying to defend it. "Just wait, guys. Wastelanders will redeem the game, you'll see.". Instead we get a 2020 delay and now we get a mix of scummy paywall content and a subscription service.
---
Unlike a lot of people, I'm not even mad. I'm disgusted, heartbroken and I regret all the money I've poured into 76 to support this game. If this is Bethesda's direction for Fallout 76, which was NOT what we were promised when I bought it the day after release, then I want no part of this and I'll just go back to Fallout 4. Fallout 76 had so much potential, and then they do this.
---
that sucks for the ppl that got double shafted, got scammed with the 99 bucks a year, and then lost everything, that sad BGS can even make sure to at least paying ppl with the advertised.
---
with this a further more prove that they just want money and the game will always be a buggy mess no matter how much money you guys give them.
---
I mean this seriously but can someone explain why I can play in a private world in Grandtheft auto online that has far more content and complicated things in my opinion and yet Bethesda is charging to do this?
---
That game is piggybacking so hard it doesnt even have to be good, great marketing on their part honestly. Idk for me the more gameplay i see it doesnt really look so great but its getting all the fallout defectors because its the team that made the arguably best fallout game.
---
You should post this again another day OP, it's great stuff and doesn't deserve to get buried because Bethesda fucked up.
---
Except you are telling them it's ok to make gaming more expensive... so you are actively hurting the hobby.
---
I know about that, I'm saying fo76 private worlds don't seem to be hosted by players.
---
I'm still salty that I bought the tricentenial edition for the full 80 bucks, I will never get over it I guess
---
I wouldn’t hate it as much if there was actually a justification to sub. I sub ESO and can always find something to do. I log into this game and I’m like, ok, now what? I’ve done it all. What is keeping people spending?
---
Skyrim Together
---
Sadly it seems like there are enough players purchasing this for Bethesda to justify this decision as crappy as it is.
---
Or if you own game pass which even includes fallout 4 . Outer Worlds is free on it.
---
lots of them still are. these people never learn.
---
Yep. And high level executives who know nothing about video games and only care about the bottom line? They love using that term and they love the income they get from abusing the vulnerable population that falls into that category. :(
---
From what I’ve seen in relation to Fallout 76...this is probably not the first kick in the teeth.
---
Its the ultimate irony that the scrap boxes have also been deleting all the scrap people put in them, really shows how well thought out this was and really encapsulates the nature of the game so far.
---
I saw one guy saying that its about force closing or ctd in adventure mode and then joining a private world when you relog, havnt tested it myself
---
200,000 people on this reddit. I’m sure there are a bunch of whales within that.
---
They will make a ton of money from at least 1000 rich idiots.
---
so ppl are getting double scammed, great job BGS. fuck even more you communitty.
---
so NOTHING works?
---
the private servers are NOT private
---
and the scrapbox doesnt work?
---
wow.
---
just wow.
---
I think its 12 dollars. Skip a fast food run and get a ton of stuff including 1600 atoms. I'm there.
---
How was ESO unfairly treated? The game was a buggy mess at launch.
---
&gt; Right but you can add any player and play with them, and there's a massive amount of players 
---
By that definition, most online rpgs would be considered as mmos.
---
keep fueling them.
---
Yea you're right, I checked again and it's showing 36.7 downloaded now. When I clicked on the store it only showed 17.
---
Game is fine. Get over your "let's complain!" hype
---
Good points 😉
---
That's actually not how it is, you should put "whale" or "bethesda fanboy" on the other vault boy and have him cheering while happily running towards fo1st
---
What online RPGs aren't MMOs by definition?
---
This.. 100%.
---
I dont know why you're being downvoted, that's literally what it is: a private invite only instance like gtav
---
this is like calling xbox 360 party chat a private voip server
---
Nice work edgelord. You mother must be so proud.
---
I care because beth are trashing their reputation.
---
I mean you approving of blatant lying and misleading paying customers is funny, yeah.
---
Why what?
---
Fallout 76 is a fucking lie.
---
all of it.
---
Well said
---
I share the same sentiment. We’ve been fucked over and lied to for too long and I’m over it.
---
Sorry can’t hear you over all this stash I have
---
I'm one of those people :(
---
they cant even get the fucking perks you PAY for to fucking work right
---
Oh buddy... 
---
I hope you didn't put anything valuable in there.
---
"fine" is the last word I'd use to define Fallout 76.
---
if you don't believe me just check the multiple reports of people losing all their junk because of the new scrap boxes, haha
---
Correct. Look at Eve Online, or World of Warcraft, etc. They have hundreds/thousands of players together in the same server. And though it can cause lag when large amount of players are gathered together in one area, particularly in PvP, that is what a MMO is. Eve is actually one of the best for all players in the game being in the same server, rather than WoW where servers do have a lot of players, but there are a bunch of different servers. It is also about a persistent world, where you see the same players every time, and not some random mini-server you log into every time with a random bunch of people.
---
Oh how does that ruin a good post, sorry I don't reddit a lot.
---
IT JUST WORKS!!!
---
Don't question. Just blindly follow what they want you to. There's plenty of people on here that have defended them on the total bullshit they've done up till now that'll eat this cash grab right up.
---
This is the real wisdom from this spiraling sodomy session called Fallout 76
---
it goes live on 10/24 at 1600 hours
---
I only sell them because I cant bring myself to not pick up everything I come across as well as I cant just drop stuff. I also noticed I only ever have people try to take the ammo factory. I've had a few run ins with people at other workshops but 90% of the time it's the ammo plant.
---
I bet it goes F2P after this.
---
naw it was just a bunch of junk
---
Yeah for 12 bucks I'm having a great time.
---
Found a whale. You should buy the $99 1 year membership, whale.
---
Tbh I think a lot of it is overblown. That’s just my opinion. Even the addition of functional atom shop stuff like the refrigerator and scrap bot. I was weary but they’re small things and the effect isn’t drastic. You can get the same effect in game normally, though with a few draw backs. But this just seems like taking the piss. Private servers seem fine and I get why you want players to pay. It’s not unreasonable. But it seems ridiculous when they’re letting people pay to have unlimited junk storage (and peolle report that they’re losing that scrap) when they could just do that for everyone. You could make everyone happy by just making that free for everyone.
---
that is broken and buggy AND doesnt actually give you a fucking private server.
---
I can do that anyway. You're complaints are that of a low level player. And chances are of your camp being destroyed so frequently is incredibly unlikely.
---
How does voluntarily giving up money to them count as them stealing it from us?
---
Bulk stays in the stash, nobody lost anything
---
Game was kinda ok, for me. Later Bethesda was like: "Want a stupid refrigerator for 7$ to keep your food good? Or a box that repairs and scraps?"
---
What a sad existence.
---
Really i dont know how anybody could play this up to now. I had nothing to do after 12 weeks. The grind for 3* items was too frustrating and the vendor system so anoying. I never ever would pay a monthly Subscription!
---
Found the shill.

---
To be fair we live in an absurd world that is destined to end in the heat death of the universe. So spending money on anything is just as useless as the next in a careless universe that doesn't even notice our existence.
---
Eat at Arby's.
---
Good thing you gave them your money.
---
it's nothing to do with bulked scrap. multiple lost everything.
---
Good job, whale. Literally nobody is going to see you wear it.
---
the game didnt even have good content to fucking begin with!
---
why should we give them MORE shit when they didnt even finish half the fucking game in the first place.
---
Star citizen being not even half finished has more content currently then Fallout 76 does.
---
So you can put on a new outfit and repeat the same things over and over? Why not save your money and buy a game that doesn’t crash every five seconds, where they won’t rip off your ideas and sell them back to you?
---
LOOOOOL "fine", fucking barely. shit's a damn mess
---
Keep drinking that kool aid bud. It doesn't even matter LOL. It's a video game. you can admit its totally fucked. Its ok. Nobody will laugh at you :)
---
I take anything Bethesda says with a grain of salt after this game.

Doubt it. Sounds like bs claims to make this sound worse

you better have after it eats all your junk.

LIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
This is the 5th time I've seen this exact post.
---
tbh it didn't need a reason from anything or anyone.
---
A game made by a dedicated dev team with a track record of knowing good and immersive games (for the most part, we dont talk about Interplay much) is the only reason this game needs to attract people to play it. That and that it's pretty much Fallout x Futurama, what more do you want?
---
Lmfao, says the guy making a post whining and bitching instead of just not playing the game anymore.
---
Reddit has this thing that they call 'flair' (weird name). There are a list of names you can put next to your name in this &amp; other sub reddits.

LMFAO!!
---
Update everyone I fixed it,by scrapping a camp, evidently after I accidentally scrapped my camp before, it actually stored one of the first versions of my shop inside my camp, so the blueprint was invisible until my camp got stored/blueprinted, thanks for the help everyone
---
Yeah I heard about that happening to people, pretty lame tbh! Hope a fix is shooting down the pipes!

---
Not if you saw the "unlimited scrap storage" line and thought "ah I'll just break down my bulk into scrap and store it this purpose built stash box and it'll be safe". I lost all of my junk for thinking logically.
---
it's actually a garbage can, you put your junk it there and it gets rid of it all for you
---
Tell that to the yao gui
---
I cannot say for sure if I can see the big picture. All I can say is their current behavior is just good business. When we look at how a CEO is legally required to act in the best interests of the shareholders, and the shareholders want to see increased company growth, then that CEO is obligated to do everything in his power to ensure that that growth continues. Even if it means throwing all of his ethics and morality out the window.
---
Greed is Good, as the CEO of CCP Games once said, before the players of EVE Online went on strike in response.

I bought it to claim the items from the atom shop then got a refund but I still have access to everything so I'm just rolling with it for now

I'll never understand you people, scrutinizing every claim. then it comes back and bites you in the bottom and you're actually surprised.
---
like I said, this sub never changes.
---
I kept my bulk in my regular stash. I’m not sure I’d call that logical 🤣 sounds like wasted plastic
---
You should see r/gaming. They are having a field day with this
---
Let’s see:
---
Claim the ammo factory, grafton steel, Poseidon, and Hemlock Holes without hassle.
---
Run events without someone one shotting the legendaries.
---
Invite shoppers to a server of all high levels selling exclusively 3* weapons and armor.
---
Yeah, sounds terrible.
---
I’ve only ever seen like 1 or 2 and it’s during Scorched Earth so I get my 1-2 shots in and let someone else deal with it lol
---
Uh buddy what have i missed.
---
Nevermind that workbenches are never more than a few steps away
---
Look at this whale. No shame.
---
But I thought the scrap box holds all of your junk which is stupid to name it the scrap box instead of ‘junk’ box because it’s confusing as fuck and I don’t know what it’s used for. What’s the point of putting stuff in it when I can do that in my stash? Half the junk can’t even be put into it
---
People reached the 'end' of that part of the story. I haven't seen any real 'deceptions' within the game though, I understood everything they announced and knew exactly what was coming. The only deceptive thing to me was their problems with their physical merch, which is a whole separate issue that is not connected to the people making the game itself.
---
I don't think anyone should ever pay a year in advance for anything. You never know what's going to happen, and a monthly basis is much safer. (I do think a sub on a paid game isn't okay, but that's why one of my first points was that fo76 should be f2p) Do I think Fallout 76 is worth $100 a year? No, but I do think Fallout 1st is worth $12 a month.
---
But, I was a premium member for Runescape in the early 2000s, and I never played it but I know WoW subscription is over $100 a year, and I played on subscription-based games a few times without ever paying for the subscription. Some of them felt like I was locked out of content, and some of them just felt like other players just got shortcuts. But most of them were f2p. Which as much as the community would instantly tantrum, I do think they should make it f2p still.
---
But right now, Fallout 1st isn't a pay-to-play, you aren't locked out of the main game. So far, game mechanic wise, I don't feel deceived at all. Everything they've done, I felt like was communicated properly. So I guess I just don't personally understand the feeling of betrayal.  
---
That is to say though, I'm not blind to it. The creation club was a mess and I was EXTREMELY disappointed in it, but I guess I hope they learned from it?
---
some idiots really don't believe this to be pay to win, now im laughing at them as they lose those hundreds of pounds of junk while they downvote me LMAO
---
I popped for one month the $13 to see how it would fare on the private session.  The game did not crash once in over 2.5 hours of play and didn’t notice any lagging or dropped frames. Collecting and looting didn’t stutter for me like it did other times.
---
I’ll have to hop onto it with my wife tomorrow and see how that handles. 
---
At this point it plays like it should have from day one. Which is annoying. If you are going to launch this type of game then deploy the proper amount of resources. 
---
I wonder what limiting sessions to 16 players would do for game stability. I imagine with Wastelanders content the game will feel more populated and you won’t need as many players to give that feeling.
---
The Fallout Worlds, oops I mean The Outer Worlds looks better to me.
---
Lol the rabbit hole goes deep. Blizzard, for instance, 15+ years of paid expansions,  with  a monthly fee. Relaunches base game content, 15 year old content, and slaps a sub on it. No one thinks that's crazy? Hell no people begged for it. We, as consumers, are all crazy. One company is praised while one shunned.
---
I'd rather look through a dark glass then whatever kaleidoscope you chose to.
---
You know what, I was just taking a smoke break from playing AKA grinding shitty events over and over and doing treasure maps for rare plan drops and I just realized how bullshit this is.
---
In going in, turning the game off and uninstalling. I'm done, AND I'm a guy who's bought 100$ of Atom Shop shit.
---
It's going to die anyway, I'm wasting my money on a game that won't get any better.
---
The logic is perfectly sound. Why wouldn't you want more space in your main stash for other stuff if you could move all of your junk into the scrapbox?
---
as a bloodied player, poison is the bane of my existence.
---
I have a vampire build as well just to blow off steam when mirelurk queens kills me. repeatedly.

yup.  wish i thought of that sneaky sneaky! love it tho. lol
---
Whales are so bold these days.
---
Time for a plublic service announcement! Don’t feed the Yao Guai. That is all.
---
Seriously - what did you expect?!
---
its SUPPOSED to hold all of your junk but bethesda being bethesda they released it without testing it most likely and its been destroying all junk, so its more of a trash can than a scrapbox. if i were you i wouldn't even waste my money on fallout 1st and if you did you should probably ask for a refund and stop playing the game in general. it'll only get worse from here on out.
---
Is this supposed to be some insult? And you’re shaming me? 
---
Looks like I found a douche, maybe you should crawl out of the basement, douche.
---
Hmm... Why would i ditch a fallout game... It's my favorite RPG series... i would never ditch it for something inconsequential...  hmm Maybe just maybe... I'm a mature adult and i can admit that a game i love kinda sucks now... Not saying anything super controversial. Fo76 = bad.
---
Ahh see I’m just hitting 50 a week ago (61 as of this post) so I’m not super deep into builds just yet.
---
As long as you continue subscribing to the game pass.
---
cant even get the premium perks to fucking work right.

(and the private servers arnt private too)

Man.. you guys will find anything to complain about eh?
---
If it gives too big of an advantage, you people complain.
---
If they nerf it then, you people complain.
---
It was never meant to be a convenience, just a funny bot.
---
And you have to pay 12,99 a month for it.... seriously this is just robbing players. The game is already terrible recieved, has a shit ton of bugs amon other problems.
---
Also, when your buddy logs off it kicks you..
---
It's not continously running.
---
It was bad at first, then awesome for awhile, but now it's going downhill again

“Wastelanders is so bug-ridden and broken that we need more money to play people while we delay it several months so buy our memberships that cost more than a year of what you pay to play ALL your games pls”
---
Tricentennial here. Do I take a number or..?
---
you're not getting it. check your stash and your scrap box asap. make sure your junk is still there.
---
the scrap box is supposed to be an infinite junk stash but it's bugging out and making all your junk disappear.
---
It’s made by the B team. The new studio in Texas. So yea, side project. I’m calling it quits on fallout until Bethesda remember they use to be a good game studio. Outer Worlds will satisfy me for now
---
Yikes... You gonna respond to that evidence? or should we just pack up...
---
Thats why i wrote i assume for the last part
---
The private servers are private, at least for me. Been in it for like 11 ish hours today
---
its 16 bucks on amazon right now
---
16.  
---
still not worth it
---
and the subscription is NOT worth it.  Not one bit
---
the one thing many would justify getting it ....the private servers.. ARE NOT PRIVATE its more akin to you and your friends being able to make invisible all other players in the server but yourselves ..thats it.  the spawns and other stuff still are open to other players you just cant see them.
---
and if you really really really want that New Vegas armor?
---
just fucking get New Vegas. its 6 bucks on steam.
---
Yes, that makes me about the most angry. That fucking tiny storage limit everyone asked to be increased. Hey, now, no problem if you just give a 100 bucks a year.
---
They are selling back all the big things people have demanded. Unlimited Scrap stash space, forward camp. They could have fixed this all allong, but no, they decided to keep the problems in the game to sell the solution. Greedy fockers....
---
It's not. 24 players to a server is not massively multiplayer.
---
Nice to know but it seems like a very edge case bug that just got fixed.
---
Infinite junk storage, a placeable camp you can sleep at for your experience advantage, travel to for no caps, and access your stash (you essentially get 1.5 camps).
---
LMAO love the title p I thought of it being said as it was in fo4
---
Or how those originally “temporarily” banned are still banned...
---
Pete Hines said that they wouldn’t cross the line like other developers in the atom shop and they would be cosmetic only because it feels right
---
Relax and enjoy
---
You shouldn't laugh at them. As sad as it is, they still have faith in Bethesda and they're being let down for their payment. It's a sad thing and I feel bad fans who still trust Beth are getting screwed with by bad game design.

---
you do you along with everyone else, me no im not paying anymore.
---
It’s an MMORPG, they’re all like this. You guys asked for one remember
---
Yea I’ve got a general idea of how most builds work, just don’t have the gear to execute any yet. Bloodied scares me though
---
Im quite not pleased. 
---
Initially I checked other players bots, because they were nearly all unlocked. They seemed weak and totally worth not the fuzz on Reddit. Later I realized if you turn them to produce scrap instead of junk, it's much better, because with junk the container fills very fast and unless you constantly visit your camp, it won't produce much since it's always full.
---
But turned to produce scrap, it seems it can hold hours(?) worth of scrap. Plus I learned you can also build them on workshops. So about two weeks after the feature came, I desided to get it too. I didn't rush quickly to build them at my camps, but I did eventually build them up.
---
But then I've noticed it's as I was thinking initially, quite weak. If producing scrap, it collects so slow that 3-5 mins in a small shack containing random junk, will net you several times as much. If producing junk, it fills fast and probably produces fairly slow anyway.(I haven't much compared, the junk items usually are worth several scrap)
---
I didn't instantly grab it when the feature dropped, I consider and valued it, until ultimately deciding to take it. So I would be displeased if it's already poor production rate was further worsened, when it already was mostly producing useless junk, and not the better one like lead and screws. And doing it silently, well there's a chance it was for whatever reason, accidental.
---
It obviously fails on a simple cost/value calculation and on PR level, but try to see the motivation behind this. Bethesda are not stupid, the did not except this big of a backslash, but they knew not too many people will appreciate this nonsense. IMO they already know this product is a dead cause, they are basically sunsetting this by extorting the last cent out of it, and also using it as a research to check how far they can go with the monetization.
---
update: someone says that the private servers ARE private but there has been conflicting reports. 
---
more research is needed those of you who actually coughed up the money check the spawns...other stuff on your server and see if there are any evidence you are not alone.  and post your findings here.  Thanks!
---
Litterly one of those games is worth playing for more then 10hrs. And its csgo.
---
Yep its in patch notes, they were meant to be ultra 45..think same issue with fixers
---
Kingdom Come Deliverence on gamepass is also fun
---
its like what we hope the Elder Scrolls VI might be like
---
but wont.
---
Ashes to ashes  
---
Dust to dust  
---
Your game is over  
---
Replay if you must
---
*Burma-Shave*
---
Today showed me how greedy they can really be, i used to be one of those defenders of the game but god damn they're really taking advantage of us. If they're actually dumb enough to buy this subscription I think it's only fair it backfires in their face. We should point and laugh at them, sure I feel veeeeeeery slightly bad but it's still pretty hilarious.
---
He's not making any cash off of it so at most he'll have to take the website down.
---
Here? Ahhh, Depends on the brand and how many in a packet. But about $30+ I think. I don't smoke so.
---
haha. you been ricked rolled ;-)
---
I don't think they lied or mislead anyone though? I personally understood the announcements they made, or decisions they made for 76 just fine. I knew exactly what was coming when they talked about it and In my year of playing, I never felt disappointed in what they put out.
---
I have the most luck walking the roads. Try not to fast travel for a whole game session and see what turns up.
---
Hitting the sack for work. I will hit ya up on Friday.
---
I could do without the monster boxes.
---
For resources thats not the point. It is the same basically the same file size. It just: resource\_steel\_value. It does not matter if the value is 1 or 1 000 000. Or does your Excel suddenly explode if you use long numbers? The thing for armor etc with all it's values of course is different.
---
I always tried so hard in my head to justify all the little things that came up at and since launch... but this is just plain indefensible. Maybe they’ve finally just decided to give up on trying to fix their relationship to the consumer base and start exploiting them like a mobile game studio instead.
---
Only 1000 atoms in the atom store!
---
I have two of my unyielding pieces with Poison resist 25% helps somewhat.
---
I'm not sure that Bethesda *ever* really understood the symbolism within the property that they bought.
---
Hermit Crabs?
---
eso got comparable backlash on its release too. they didnt really start to turn it around until the one tamriel update.
---
I hope you won't get broke because of these 15 bucks / month. /s
---
I heard it was super short
---
Beautiful
---
Aaand it's gone.
---
Yup, it’s basically $17 USD
---
DCUO does the same thing and it's subscription prices are relatively the same. Although you don't have to pay for online on ps4, or pc.
---
Fuck mirelurk kings, fuck anglers, and fuck gulpers.
---
Increase server stability by forcing hoarding excavator Bois to dump their junk into an endless void.  Genius!!
---
The game was never alive in the first place
---
It does, a scrapbox and a stash box.
---
took me forever to put together an uny/sneak wood set though
---
doubt I could find one with +poison resist as well.
---
That's the point, everyone is like "I quit" here and there but they actually won't, they just want stuff for free and gonna try to mass whine about it to have it, just like kids.
---
If they would have given users who already paid for this game a couple months free, added new content because I’m bored as shit, and made it free. And the subscription was $5... then I would defend this. But as a fan I can’t defend this.
---
Man I'm with you for some stuff, but I'm enjoying the game. Why is that so bad?
---
Dear Fallout crowd, please don’t dick this company until I get ES:VI
---
I like the comment you had where you said that a solution for the junk management would be to make scrap weigh nothing because it’s just an integer. Fucking spot on
---
"Sex tent"
---
Another good fix you will be hard pressed to find on this sub. Along with : legendary scorch beasts. Holy cow it's a turkey shoot in the bog for scrips
---
And laser and plasma piles fixed. 
---
I never did see the appeal of wandering the wastland alone. I often miss players when i get that weird thing where you're all alone. But i digress. There was a bumch of good patches and idiots who thought they were going to play alone(for free) rulled the sub.
---
The difference here is, ESO has been an MMO from the get go that, while beautiful, is a generic high fantasy mmo. Fallout 76 doesn't know what it whats to be. While this new push may seem to try and solidify 'MMO' status, it's basically just a co-op Fallout 4 expansion. ESO works because it knows its audience. 76 is what happens when you tell 8 people they are the captain and watch them all try and sail at their own accord at the helm all at once.
---
*ubisoft entered the chat*
---
Yea mirelurk kings can go die. I’m assume they were introduced in Far Harbor. Cause I only played Base FO4 and never saw them there. They should have stayed in Far Harbor, but Mutated Bears should take a forever hibernation
---
That was a very intense quote for a fo76 post. Thank you for the reply but to also be fair, you can apply that logic to everything in existence. In fact I could apply it to you bothering to reply to my post so... 
---
My point is, as a fo76 player. Yes I can afford it and to those who still use the “you just want free shit” argument, no, I don’t. I just want content that’s worth me spending my money on.
---
I do agree with you until a point bisunees need to make a profit thats a given, but how you do it is the key. 
---
fucking your costumers on the way to make a profit its just counter productive. yes you will make money for a little bit but then it will stop. 
---
I also think you are missing the big picture, if we dont say nothing now BGS will just keep doing it and other companies will join in. 
---
I remember all the shit I was called when I said something about the out fits/repair kits back a few months ago, fast forward to now and we have this. what you think its going to happen to every other BGS game sooner or later you will see this BS on every game. I dont want console and pc game cominnuty turn in the crazy mess mobile games are. If we dont stop this now its just going to get worst.
---
Seems more likely you are looking through a tinfoil hat.
---
Probably sore and raw. I am so sorry that you got dupped by them.
---
Oh wow. 
---
I was considering a month to get that silly robot emote and others. I would have already got a month worth of "first", if they gave a transfer box to move stuff and caps between my chars. That would be a really huge convinience feature so it's really odd how they didn't include one.
---
That's really like, you have a feature like that, it's only available for money, because it's not via atoms. And then you mess it up. On my main char I have maybe 200 screws, but 1000 acid, and small amount of all flux plus maybe 30-50 of few I've purchased for serum crafting.
---
If I would lose all that, I would be quite quite displeased.(yes I would still play sadly, since the junk is handy and some of it is quite required, but it's just means to an end, not the goal itself)
---
And I can imagine someone had far more, and placed it there to free up lots of room, and lost it all.
---
It’s probably mostly code from that survival mod someone built for skyrim and fallout 4
---
You can lead a man to slaughter but you’re never gonna make him think.
---
Even with bold, that can't be emphasized enough. Same with the tents.
---
Thank you, valued customers, for 800$ &lt;3 we will keep adding content to your liking!
---
Fair use, specifically non-commercial parody.
---
Bethesda please, just make this game free to play and give existing users 2 months, and lower the subscription fee to $5. Then I would actually consider!
---
and I'm sure it makes them all teary-eyed that they can provide you with such a deep, meaningful and impactful experience.
---
**for a price.**
---
Play a new game while we wait for wastelanders. That's my suggestion
---
Hey, does anyone have any Junior Mints/Andes? I'll trade for some of my M&amp;M's!
---
Nobody is pointing a gun at you, just don't pay and carry on.
---
Lol love the barely cosmetic additions for 20 bucks more. So useless
---
Holy shit that's hilarious!
---
Angler groups are the stuff of nightmares. Wish deathclaws would spawn in packs and be super tanky.
---
Don’t forget wasteland 3 will be on game pass spring of next year
---
They have investors. Every company has stock shares, even a one man LLC - they’re  just not publicly traded. They’re restricted stock units, or RSUs.  You can hold them, but you can’t sell them. You can exit the company, and the company will buy them back and distribute them to other stock holders, or just delete them (depending on how it was incorporated). 
---
People hold stock shares though. They received them in exchange for some form of capital, meaning direct funding, services, real property, etc.  They have a per-share value, it’s just determined annually by the board, and not supply and demand. 
---
When Zenimax makes $, profits go directly to the shareholders, or, investors.  Pete and Todd are absolutely both shareholders in the company. 
---
It works just like any public company. It’s a boring answer, but the comment is accurate.
---
At least you have a comment history so you can track them all down and rub it in their stupid, gullible faces.
---
Looks like you were not alone with such decision. I have yesterday logged in and the world was empty- no one except me. First time for the year. So I thought it could be some kind of demonstration what private world could look like.
---
Then they are suckers. Fallout 4 is the superior game if they so desperately want to play single player Fallout. Best of all? They don’t have to pay $100 a year.
---
Oh, and you aren’t actually getting a server. It’s still peer-to-peer.
---
The game is still a hot mess. And they want to charge you $100 a year to play it solo.
---
Sounds about spot on to be honest.
---
For the digital larping.
---
yeah, 
---
I do have to say perfect timing on BGS part, with ToW coming out.
---
https://web.archive.org/save/http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Saved it for when it's inevitably going to be changed back.
---
I'm going to play Outerworlds when it comes out.
---
Finally, someone sees the forest through the trees...
---
Straight up. The game was half off maybe the third time I played it and I’m pretty sure I could have gotten free through game pass but still decided to shell out the full $60 to support a company I liked. Past tense! EA, Bethesda, and Blizzard are all perfect examples of how AAA companies don’t give a shit about their consumers... As gamers how long do we put up with this?
---
Is it not just unlimited stash space for he private servers though ? I may have misunderstood but that would make sense. 8 people with unlimited VS 24 or whatever people is a big difference for server stability
---
You really think that way?
---
Say, have you thought about moving apartments? I own this great flat near your area that I think you would be perfect for.
---
Not much help without workbench to scrap junk, using scrap kit is way more convenient
---
They delayed it because they knew Outer Wilds would take away most of its player base and the content would have been glitchy/broken anyway. We knew that as well.
---
How did they manage to make it look worse than the new vegas version?
---
I bought the plastic bag edition, returned it (they didn't accept me returning it at first) and bought two tricentennials instead.
---
Just to clarify, Are you implying that Deathclaws are weak?
---
For only $100 a year we can support his legal battle.
---
I'm glad he spoke up as well. I know what you mean all the shit thats going on in the world sometimes you have to wonder who the hell is writing the script lol
---
and after a few months, your going to be bitch becuase the game still a buggy mess/lossing progress or equipment/dcs/no new content. look not even 24 hours and ppl are lossing all their junk. if that is not prove to whats to come and what you have to wait for I dont know what is. 
---
but you do you I will take my money somewhere else.
---
Ahhh beat me to it
---
Aight because only rich people can afford something worth 15 euros / month.
---
They justify it because ESO already did the same thing and people gave them a pass for it.
---
&gt;but if you liked it you wouldn't complain 
---
its called criticism, if a restaurant served you a pile of shit and told you to eat it, would you not complain? thats essentially what bethesda is doing, trying to force feed us shit and people are swallowing it. Don't buy FO1st, its obviously a cash  grab and they're breaking promises they made during E3. "nO pAy tO wIn" &gt;adds scrapboxes.   
---
Its fucking pathetic.
---
OMGGGGGG this deserve a prize.
---
/claps /claps
---
i been laughing reading this for the past 10m
---
Not a boring answer, most definitely. Stuff like this helps to explain Bethesda's erratic behaviour. Thanks for clarifying 👍
---
Welcome to capitalism.
---
what a pile of crap.
---
the ranger costume sells itself. I'd love to see their earning reports next month, though.
---
&gt;The more monetary support the game gets the more it grows
---
that's not necessarily true. it could just be siphoned into other projects while we get scraps that barely work, which seems to be the case here.
---
No. The endlessly-respawning monsters.
---
Haha same. Most of my friends who play either don't care because it doesn't affect them. Or they think the atom discount, outfit, and dance emotes are worth it.
---
Did they do this as a sneaky way to encourage people to support the OG Fallout devs and play Outer Worlds. Because that's the only generous interpretation of this situation.
---
You might be a carebear... I might be a filthy raider. But tonight we drink in your honor! I'm not going near that thing. Nope. No thx.
---
How's your Santa Claus outfit?
---
Diablo 3
---
I’m not saying Beth doesn’t screw things up regularly...but the tiresome reaction to every patch here on this sub (which basically equates to: I didn’t get exactly what I want=Whaaaa😭)
---
A good example is the previous patch which I thought did exactly what people had been asking for, still had dozens of neg posts here.
---
Karma
---
Super weak. They are slow have a huge weak spot and travel alone. Want  packs of them roaming around and remove the weak belly.
---
I’m not sure exactly what you’re talking about tbh. Never seen or heard of this and also don’t know if you’re being sarcastic
---
Or anything that has microtransactions in it.
---
😂🤣
---
Except it's not a private server, it's a private lobby, like playing GTA Online in a private game. And there are plenty of games that offer the same thing for free, and more that offer hosting tools so you can set up your own actual server.
---
You on console?
---
shame on all of you for buying into their BS. you get what you pay for, this game has always been a mess
---
Press t or x on your favorites wheel
---
Maaaaayyyybbbbeeeee you should wait a little bit on Outer Worlds.
---
Just in case.
---
I mean Fallout 76 is still a mmo. Bethesda never really tried to hide that.
---
I don’t 100% agree but I also don’t disagree. They can be tough to deal with depending on player level and the Deathclaws level. But they weren’t supposed to be as big of a threat as Scorch beasts so I don’t mind them being a bit weaker than previous installments. Do think they could use a minor buff to help make them a bit scarier again though.
---
did you actually thought anything different from BGS. 
---
i just feel bad that you got double schafted.
---
Its in your weapons favorite wheel at the bottom. It should tell you which button or key to press depending on what system your using
---
Man, i remember defending this game and telling my friends how this game isn't that bad and that they should get it and play since it's only 15$, now my mind i completely changed and i see the piece of shit cash grab it is. But the Bethesda fanboys are obviously gonna buy this shit and Bethesda will think it's okay to continue doing it, next they're gonna be selling stash space and shared storages. Stop enabling this behavior.
---
are the servers even private? i posted a rant about how they wernt from users saying spawns and other stuff appear to be taken by other players even though they should only be the only perosn in the server that its actually instanced or something
---
Fk off with your award speeches
---
Ikr... It just looks plain and boring
---
What you said makes literally no sense in more ways than 1 but okay.
---
I doubt it given your comments.  But even if you have, software and database servers =/= Windows updates.
---
Unfortunately this subreddit just became an echo chamber for this kind of stuff, they don't realize that if Bethesda is doing what it is doing is because they know they can afford it.
---
Unless random reddit user "xXDemOnLorDXx" has more insights on a corporation economic plan while not being part of it.
---
has anyone posted proof of this yet? big if true otherwise without proof simply saying why would i lie about this makes comming off the wave of protesting seem kinda suspect. just cause lots of people are saying the same thing doesnt help or prove anything. notice nobody here is postinf proof just me too
---
I still wouldnt play. I didn't invest in a purchase of the game or the atom shop for mmo style subscription fees. I just won't be playing anymore nor spending money on the game unless this is retroactively withdrawn completely, which I don't foresee happening.
---
#gotem
---
I don't play several months. Waiting when they release some new story. All this time they add nothing interesting to me including this subscription. I will just wait some new story dlc.
---
I feel that this is more financially acceptable to PC players than to console. We have to pay a subscription just to access Fallout 76 (Playstation Plus and Xbox Game Pass). Now we have to pay that on top of the 12.99 to have private servers? So a year sub to a console service plus fallout 76 would run a person 159.98... That's a bit much. What happens after you buy everything on the atoms shop? Does Bethesda plan to keep adding new cosmetic items on the atoms shop to appease people or just make the current items a higher price?   
---
After a year of saving atoms, you'll have 19800 atoms. Which is about 200 dollars in atom stop currency. That alone pays you back for the 100 dollars you invested but way more for PC players than console.  To make the subscription more appealing to console players, they should lower the sub for consoles. 
---
And Bethesda had time for this but had to delay wastelanders? 😤
---
Exactly my point.
---
This is great. I love how they leave in the actual "benefits" of Fallout First because of how much a joke it already is.
---
Maybe it is, or maybe it isn't, but the thing is, it is the kind of game that you can replay, with different builds and different dialogue options, so short or not it will provide many many hours of gameplay if you want it to.
---
Obviously. Why do you think people are so angry? It’s a scam.
---
Im gonna guess a goooood chunk of players are gonna buy it, cause Ive also already seen aloooot of people who have purchased it lol
---
First of all I'm not backing their decisions at all. I just dont piss and moan about it when a company known for fucking over their player base actually fucks over their player base. Secondly criticism is fine, no argument here. The problem I have with it is that they obviously aren't taking criticism right now otherwise they wouldn't have done it. Instead of complaining about it just stop paying for it. That's the only way to make them listen but it won5 happen.. everyone will will just complain about it and hope it changes.
---
How’s the taste of boot in your mouth? Enjoying it?
---
Subscription service in any game that is 60 bucks is bold. Why the fuck did the companies decided that they can charge you full price and then shove those fucking microtransactions and subscriptions? Fuck them
---
But more on topic yeah a lot of people agree, for example in ESO from what I understand, the sub is much cheaper and you get all the dlc as long as you're subbed, for me that seems like a great idea as it allows you to sub for a month, see of you like the content and them buy it and if you want there are other reasons to still stay subbed.
---
Here it's just hey give me money. Many mobile games have something similar, bonus xp, extra of something that makes the game easier and as long as you're subbed for a crazy price you keep it.
---
Was this /v/'s work? I thought they didn't even want to bring up this game anymore
---
so BGS ideal off community is a post that 23 ppl liked and 7 ppl post on it. I do want to smoke whatever BGS did before coming with that BS.
---
&gt; *“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76, all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”*
---
I had my camp there for like 6 months.  Had a little crafting nook right where that keypad is.
---
The fact that they made that insane weibo apology post on Chinese immediately, and then radio silence to the western audience for almost a week was the part that really damns them in my opinion.
---
YESSSS!!!!
---
Ish. 76 is a hodgepodge of game genres and that is a piece of why 76 has been so lukewarmly received save for hardcore fans.
---
Uninstall it now boys. This ship is sinking but Outer Wilds is 2 clicks out. Hang on!
---
Just bought Fallout 4 because it was 75% off. Although it's a dumbed down RPG, it's still a decent shooting RPG.
---
the worst part of it is the irony that THE reason that fallout 76 didnt sell was the paywalls and lack of content and polish and now they are just increasing that
---
I'll give you some. They fixed a lot of issues that D2 had, but in rather usual bungo fashion, ended up with some new ones.
---
Namely, Eververse is getting into F2P mode price-wise, despite the fact that while year 1 D2 is free, it's year 1 and therefore completely irrelevant for any decent or current content.
---
Shadowkeep on it's own is great, but it plays more like the intro to a story arc, and gets kinda left in the dust after 7 missions, ending in weekly lore-pages that don't particularly advance the story.
---
A lot of people will.
---
It just wasn't funny.
---
I thought at first this was a hoax but now I’m seeing more and more info about this...it’s making me physically sick...  no joke serious gastrointestinal issues right now.  You know that feeling when buy some bad Mexican food and within minuets your body is telling the equivalent of “the doors of hell being swung open, and demons are screaming and clawing their way to get into this world.
---
Bethesda should watch this and feel ashamed but i got a good laugh, thanks.
---
At only $15 per month, it seems ok to me, I play everyday so it's less than 50 cents per day.
---
If I order a pair of shoes from Amazon and choose not to pay for expedited shipping but my neighbor does and they receive their heels a week before I do, I've been wronged?
---
This is the stupidest thing I have heard this year. By your logic give up now because in the long run nothing matters.
---
Maybe some people are fed up and don't want this tumor to grow.
---
But did you achieve a sense of pride and accomplishment?
---
Im just warning others you can take what you will from it, beth has access to my proof if they wanna help👍🏻
---
Would give silver If I had. valid points Speaking for itself I'm tempted myself to sell off items and quit with 700 hours invested to be shit on, Todd; Hey we cannot guarantee stability ect ect, So were pushing back wastelanders the MOST important dlc anyone gave a second thought about and pushed it back at a later date. Greed won't make you relevant
---
At least blizzard gives you a lot of things to do for $13 a month...
---
I know you aren't backing them and I understand what you were saying, that was for anyone who would come here defending them saying what they're doing is fine. Right now you and I are brothers in arm to stop Bethesda from being a piece of shit and hopefully we can make them change what they've been doing. I haven't played the game in about a month and I plan to keep it that way until they ACTUALLY listen to us and not make up some bullshit like we asked for this to be behind a paywall.
---
I did. I liked a lot of what was in the atom shop, but I will no longer pay for atoms no play 76 so long as subscription services are here. It's sad cause I was planning on buying Halloween stuff or playing for the fasnacht event items. But whatever. I'm done.
---
You need fallout 1st for a stable connection
---
This is pure gold
---
bury my heart next to yours
---
Not sure exactly what you are asking...
---
As I understand it, the Scrap Box stores “junk” (steel, wood, acid, screws, gears, etc.) as materials.
---
It does not store junk items or bulked items.  That is, you can’t store cigarettes or pots - but just the broken down materials from them like cloth and steel.
---
It’s common in this game.
---
I bought one month. only to check it out and see if i get extra stability in Vault Raids and SBQ fights. I’ve felt the servers have been much more stable and i haven’t had the random lag spots at all
---
&gt; it has really improved since release, hopefully, it is not too late for fallout 76 to do the same 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/UVEb0Tm.gif](https://i.imgur.com/UVEb0Tm.gif)
---
It’s the cosplay version.
---
Yao guai, wendigos and SBQ fights are the primary reason why my mostly 2h melee character also carries a furious .50 cal . Some things are just meant to be killed from a distance.
---
Two friends already did.
---
Some pluses:
---
Scrapbox for infinite loot
---
Workshops are safe to take so infinite loot production and xp grinding from defend events
---
Infinite junk loot space + workshop supply = infinite ammo.  Con: So market prices might fluctuate.
---
Infinite junk also means being able to more easily make and scrap weapons and armor to learn their mods.
---
No competition for legendaries at events.
---
No usual worries of trolls.
---
All the server junk is basically yours.
---
They do run more smoothly a bit, still don't load fast enough for marathoner users though.
---
You get like 25 or 30 minutes after a 1st member leaves a server before you're booted if you're visiting (f2p).
---
Cons: 8 people means public events like encrypted and scorched earth will be a bit harder.
---
Market prices might fluctuate from influx of ammo.
---
No usual foot traffic to your vendors, you won't sell stuff from vendors as often.
---
It's a weird change up.
---
You should head Bethesda advertising, it's like you're trying to sell the game!
---
I *know*, right?
---
I shouldn;t have to pay fr extra stuff - I should get it for FREE!!!!!!!!! 
---
I ALREADY paid TEN MONTHS AGO !!
---
I don;t know how I'm going to explain this to mom 😫
---
If your on xbox outerworlds is part of the gamepass subscription, so it's free
---
Bethesda can fix that for $100... oh wait just kidding.
---
this allows players to camp out near big spawns .. farm the crap and put it in their unlimited stash... fucking over non members
---
sighs.
---
they can't really change it at this point without causing even more backlash.
---
I'm genuinely interested to see what happens in the future because they obviously overlooked just how broken private worlds + infinite storage can be.
---
Wasn’t private servers suppose to be free? Or am I remembering incorrectly
---
New Vegas.
---
I think we should build a community around this website and use it as a power tool, we need to show them this is not ok.
---
There aren't Fascnacht event items.
---
tried to warn us........we didnt listen
---
WE DIDNT Listen!!!!!!
---
actually i did.. i hadnt actually bought the game yet just played the beta but after the news today glad i didnt!
---
I wont, its 12 dollars. I can just skip a fast food run once a month.
---
Tried Australia says Oct 24 @6 am and I'm on PST
---
I bought the game on release because iam a huge fallout fan. Played the other fallout games probably hundreds of hours so F76 was a instabuy for me and thought hey multi-player is not my thing but I can also play it solo if I u want to as Tod Howard promised. 
---
I played on release the game was a buggy mess and I stopped playing.
---
I played after the battle royale update and it was buggy mess and I again stopped playing. 
---
I played a few weeks ago the game was also a buggy mess.
---
So yeah this sums up my experience with F76 since release. So Bethesda wants a monthly fee that I can play F76 on my own also pay wall gameplay stuff (especially scrap management) behind and this without mod support to fix all the shitty bugs and mechanics?
---
No thanks I definitely smash instead the pass button into oblivion.
---
Subscribed instead to Microsoft and going to play outer worlds :D
---
Thank you for nothing Bethesda or no thank you for saving money in the future and spend my money instead for companies and games who really deserve it.
---
That was like a year ago, dude. People are allowed to change. 😂
---
Anthem.

and no, you don't wanna do that. it's not as bad but it's also dead.
---
yeah but giving money to bethesda doesnt seem like a good idea right now
---
"great game" LMAOOO holy hell i almost fell out of my chair, good one bro, you should be a comedian LMAO....oh...you were serious....? ....oh well now this is awkward...
---
First month is a buck, then its $5 a month. They haven't announced an increase yet, though in the future when they build up a library, I can see it going up to $9.99.
---
I mean if the fasnacht event is re-rolled out on servers. Sorry, I should have clarified that.
---
It’s gonna be a shitshow around here for a few days. But it will eventually die down after everyone stops moaning about the private servers. Don’t think the price is fair? Don’t buy one. Simple as that
---
Of course, I own all the workshops in every private world. Tax just be paid 😂
---
Yep, bought it and played with friends for like 6 hours, couldn't be happier.
---
I agree- the amount of salt is at cardiac arrest levels here.
---
The man is a hero

If the vast absurdity and bleak nothingness of eventuality is too much for you, you can give up now. In the end it will all mean the same. Does your need to be validated by others or a higher purpose guide your actions or do you do as you truly wish based on your own values. Are any of your values even really your own or an amalgam of things taught and passed down. Do you even have free will. Does life have to have a meaning for you to do something. These are not questions but statements in an ever developing amalgamation of random events that is known as life.

Eat at Arby's. We have the meats.
---
any more proof private servers arnt actually private and its shared instances where others can snag your spawns and stuff?
---
With each new installment or set of content being put out I’m beginning to believe this is a cry for help. Maybe Bethesda wants out of this but contracts and litigation force them to keep going. Maybe their are looking to us to stop buying so the investors shut down the studio and it’s projects. Maybe even sell fallout to a smaller studio. I was happier with Bethesda’s games during the earlier 2000s but this shit right here?! I don’t even know anymore. It’s like there’s a catch 22 Everytime they satisfy any request. This sounds far fetched I know, but Bethesda’s games from 10 years ago and prior are so different than the games they make now.
---
GTA 5 lol
---
Like a girlfriend who stopped loving you years ago but is too dead inside to do anything about it so she just is as awful as she can be at all times so we’ll leave first?
---
outer worlds' success will mean a lot for the industry
---
If you think about it... the best way to protest is to play but not pay them a cent more. Be a burden on their servers. Use every server crashing glitch in the book. Throw 50 orbital strike beacons , per squad member, into a queen event. Do the rug stack and scrap glitch. 
---
Force them to buy more server resources. 
---
Or, we just boycott all BGS services until they issue a formal apology. That includes fallout 4, starfeild, any elder scrolls games. Give them really, really bad gameplay data to show their investors. Thats the only thing that will get people fired, or to lift a finger to fix things.

Sounds fair to me.

I promise you I won't slap you in the face. a year from now though, who knows.
---
everyone knows promises are fleeting after all. it's the very definition of the word.
---
you can get armor created by Obsidian without having to pay a fucking monthly fee!
---
Did three SBQ fights and zero lag. Even with a ton of enemies all around and eight of us blasting away I didn’t notice a bit of lag. Worth every penny IMO.
---
My best experience in the game was strangers. It's was pretty interesting experience, and most exciting to trade them for caps / items.
---
Private servers skipping main feature of the game. As well they can capture all workshops on map and store infinity junk after this..
---
And how 8 players will defeat queen?
---
I rarely spend extra money on games outside of a season pass if it offers good stuff. Honestly F4 was probably the last pass i bought.  Ill take my freebies or what i get for my time invested if possible. 
---
I have 4000 atoms from challenges and ive bought a few items but never paid for them, not much has caught my eye as its either PA skins or camp items. Alot of the buying is just poor impulse control. I saw it back when, on PS Home. I see it in Madden and any game that offers things like this. Its a short term benefit fueled by impulse and boredom. Its fun at the time but after a few days the realization sets in that it probably wasnt worth it. To spend hundreds or thousands as some people do on one game is literally beyond my comprehension.
---
The only people buying the subscription are the employees.
---
why not provide proof here why is no body providing proof? if you wana get people on your side provide proof.
---
Only thing other than the scrap box bug I’m actually annoyed with is something I don’t see much complaining about...I’m back to my food/water counters running down Uber fast again, I’ll get over it 👍🏻
---
As far as this sub it’s why I’m commenting on this post...support those who can do more that moan...atta OP!
---
but doesnt it cost money to run the servers?
---
i wnat to wake up tommorow and see it was an error
---
and they release the server software for anyone to make private servers free
---
like the bad dream that i actually work thing sout with my ass parents only to wake up and say thank god that was a dream lol
---
What does stadia have to do with gamepass? Gamepass isn't streaming games for you. You download it from gamepass and play it. Its not a streaming service.
---
I would have paid real money for anything from New Vegas. But not like this, what a horrible way to hold back a much requested armor.
---
Damn dude. Cringe much?
---
good thing i got to it before it was removed lol im sending it to everyone i know
---
maybe in the end, fallout76 was the shitshow that saved us in the long run...maybe this is intentional? thanks beth??
---
it was a bad sign when food and drinking were required and not optional in the beta to me.
---
and no text chat.
---
who the FUCK makes an online PC game with no fucking text chat option.
---
Gone are tgey days of spawning queen only to show up and get kicked out or timed out lmao

Elder Scrolls Online

well no fuck bethesda I just bought CoD MW fucking hacks we went from a shambling only-cosmetics to full on p2w in a month
---
Ahh you mean the mass effect game that’s going to be forgotten in about two weeks
---
I was actually being sarcastic. This whole episode is classic.
---
I'll take 3 months to make up for the $30 price cut two weeks after release...
---
But a year would be great.
---
It's not just Bethesda it's almost every major gaming company. Gaming is getting way to big to not monetize and companies like Bethesda (mainly Pete Hines) know this. I play it every now and then and I stay away from the atom store because I know it's full of garbage. I dont care about personal advantages because I'm not a PvP player, I'm a fallout player and I play it like a fallout game.  I dont put in more than what is required to play it and to be honest I've enjoyed it. Let's be clear though, I hate money grubbing and I agree that they lie a lot but I simply dont care because I dont let it affect my experience. It's almost as if most people think that you NEED to pour money into it to enjoy it and it's just not the case. Everyone just needs to stop paying companies to shit on us.
---
Obsidian disagrees
---
;-)
---
Holy bat shit dude! How much does a hamburger run ya?
---
A good rpg is hard to come by.
---
You must be young yourself if you think they "invented" it or was one of the first. Microtransactions were way back in Neopets. When I worked for one of the AAA game company in the mid-late 90s, I was tasked with doing a game that used the same mechanics. Nothing came of it for a variety of reasons but Microtransactions have been around a long time in games.
---
Get fucked
---
With Bethesda, you don't get what you pay for? Lol. I would be hysterical if the response to this bug is more of the usual they are "looking into it"
---
you’ve made a terrible mistake sir
---
I can’t play anyway. Server disconnects and lack of content. The most I can do is uninstall it, which I’ve already done.
---
Now that sounds extreme!
---
Ha yeah :(
---
If you're gonna be a wiseass about it:
---
WILL you be more specific?
---
At least I get my money worth with PS+ I have so many free games and I only pay $40/year(I bought it during a recurring sale) that’s 24+ free games yearly for less than what I got fallout 76 for...
---
Just wait for that Elder Scrolls V Skyrim HD+ Remaster/Remake for next gen consoles.
---
Not just bats, but bat lights that come out of the sides!  They rotate and shine through my floor. It looks amazing.
---
granted I've been extra salty today. I really like this game but Bethesda is making it really hard to not just drop it.
---
I'm trying my damn hardest to port the goddamn assets but that Appalachia.btd file is gonna be the end of me.
---
Most people will not shell out the yearly sub (you can easily see that in wow's six month  vs monthly numbers)  , so they will be paying 13 bucks. PC game pass is $1 for first month, $5 bucks after that. Which is what the OP was talking about. GJ picking at straws without seeing the field.
---
Yup. They're alongside EA, Acti-Blizz (I got a free MW with my new GPU, so fine - I'll do the campaign) and now Ubi following Breakpoint.
---
I checked that last night, with no luck.
---
But my character is quite low level, so perhaps it only shows above a certain level?
---
&gt; Everyone just needs to stop paying companies to shit on us 
---
for sure, and yeah we don't have to dump money into it but the thing im worried about is when will it stop? we thought repair kits were gonna be the only "non-cosmetic" items but they've constantly continued to ask more and im pretty sure it won't end at the scrapboxes and will only get worse
---
I still didn’t get that canvas bag
---
How is this game still a thing?
---
Yep at long as the staircase is over foundation and that foundation itself is on ground, it's perfectly working as the build mode has ever been intented.
---
Wow you're an idiot. Do you know what costs them money? Speaking out and removing the money sources. You know what doesn't cost them money? You idiots with your "sit there, shut up, and give them your money" bullshit. You can just sit there and keep eating the shit sandwiches Bethesda's feeding you in silence. I'll be over here withdrawing my financial support and vocalizing the reasons why. And the best thing in this is that you're so stupid you're arguing that they won't listen while being paid because they only care about the money and being a dick to someone who campaigning for people to speak up and STOP PAYING. So go take your bitter dumb ass into someone else's replies. I'm done with you filth. You can't even understand simple things.
---
&gt;If there's an industry that replaces worn out and heavily used parts for free new ones and somehow makes a profit, please let me know what it is.
---
this is as inane and dumb as when lobbying people for the large labels back in the early 90s were equating downloading to theft, as if software in any way could be realistically compared to hardware.
---
there are plenty of examples of things given freely in terms of software. there are some with hardware, too, but they're obviously more rare because surprise, physical things cost money to manufacture and ship, unlike the final software product.
---
what you're paying for here is a service, not a product, so it would make much more sense to provide an analogue to a service rather than a car dealer-ship. for example, the rollercoaster park downtown near me is a good example.
---
tickets cost, food cost, and so on. i can buy a ride pass to make tickets coss less or nothing at all. in the end, there's a certain amount of money - a treshold - that each customer need to reach in terms of spending to turn that customer from a "loss" into a "win". the very fact that they provide "ride pass" (free pass for all rides all day for a certain price) suggests that this ride pass is the treshold level. so, if you compare this unlimited ride pass to say, a 10-set ride pass, you can see that in order for your money to be worth, you want to ride at least 10 times (as an example) to 'earn back' the moneys worth from your ultimate ride pass. what happens to any ride after this? it's free!
---
this is just one of many myriads of examples. you reward your most loyal customers - returners, whales, and so on - because the bottomline is money, and a service makes money not from sales but from happy customers.
---
the fact that bethesda is going the other way shows they are either
---
a) giving up on the game and are now trying to rake in as much cash as possible before folding the game
---
b) completely inept, zero experience in any sort of retailing and servicing, and a complete disaster on management level
---
at this point, for us the customers, it doesn't matter one squat if it's A or B; they're clearly, maliciously, not giving a shit about the customers, OR, they are so incompetent that they end up giving the same impression of not giving a shit.
---
&gt;Could you imagine if I demanded they waive payment for all of 2020, simply because I magnanimously chose to buy a car from them? 
---
yeah, if this rollercoaster park PROMISED me free rides all year of 2020, then added a new ride afterwards, i would 100% expect this new rollercoaster to be included in the earlier promised free rides *which i paid for with the understanding that it would be a single payment including all rides*.
---
and if you really, really, want to use your "used car dealership" analogue... a better example would be, you buy your car with the promise that the dealership "will be sending more parts over time, because the car is just not entirely complete yet, but no worries, it will be free"; except when the time comes for them to send free parts over, they want you to pay for it. and then they send a symbolic sentimental little part, "this is what we meant, for this new completely inclusive part that ought to have been part of the car from the start you will have to pay a subscription fee"
---
or to make it simple: imagine paying a subscription fee for a car you own. if a dealership has fooled you into this, you're the idiot, not the car dealership.
---
i was one of the ones that i got flag multiple times and downvote to hell after the first Atom shop P2W items were add.
---
And i give up on this sub just bc the blind ppl, i just come back today just to see how all this is blowing up. 
---
They deserve a big "I TOLD YOU SO"
---
Remember folks,  “It's not how you launch, it's what it becomes”. Just think about what treats are still to come :D
---
Cucked
---
Everyones camp has a collectron. Yet everyone was against things like that. I know hes cheap and easily gotten for free but nobodys dying on a virtual hill.
---
thank you for this!
---
mainly the point:
---
" There are a few reports and I've got confirmation from a few reputable  sources that "newly created" worlds when a Private world is first  selected by a "[Fallout 1st](https://tinyurl.com/y6se4t8s)"  player has Dead NPC's, already looted Junk (not the timed spawns but  Clipboards) and other abnormalities that when tested multiple times seem  to indicate these are not "New" world instances but re-allocated older  Server instances. "
---
as i had made my own post about how this should be illigel but someone said that they went getting that issue.
---
This point here i am very worried is not a bug and is in fact by design.
---
they really need to personally comment on this or risk being flagged as down right false advertisement.
---
personally if a private server is supposed to be set up as a private server i cannot possibly see how this could be happening as a "bug".
---
but if others are reporting this is not an issue then maybe it is.
---
hopefully official word will come soon  till then my post remains.
---
have you lost all sense off reality, 
---
when ppl say it pays itself back is bacuse you get real money back for your purchase. are you getting money no you are not, you get some whortless digital currency that you can only use in one game. 
---
no it doesnt pay for itself, but keep telling you that so you dont feel like are getting double schafted and can sleep at night.
---
I love that person plz @ them
---
someones an internet badass.
---
@saintt-14 hahaha I know dude XD i'm just bored on my other games so thought something new to try but I've heard and seen all the bad stuff about it just thought I'd give it a shot :)
---
Oh, such a clever response! I'm blown away!  meh.
---
They could. If they would make the game free and pushed there subscription. That would be easier to accept. Anyway both cases are bad.
---
I can almost guarantee that wastelanders wont be free at all either. They will charge us for it or release it in packs or some bullshit and if so I wont be buying it.
---
Atlas observatory
---
Stick to the forest for a while. Follow the quests till it takes you out of the forest then hang around... Build a stash full of toys. Don't worry about perks so much but by the time you're lvl 50 its best to focus one weapon type. Can always change later on slowly so don't sweat mistakes in the perks.
---
I didn’t spent anything, all the atoms spent came from the ones earned in game,
---
In Obsidian we trust.
---
Ima get downvoted but I feel like their idea was that you and your friends get together and pitch in for the private server not just one person has to buy it, but four or more people could pitch in to buy a server right ? Or does everyone have to buy their own in order to access someone else’s private server?
---
Did you know the Trump family actually owns shares in Zenimax?
---
Terraria, Rimworld, Starbound, Stardew Valley, Slime Rancher, Undertale, to name a few.
---
Wonder if I can get a refund due to false advertising?
---
In one online store in Poland we've had a promotion, buy thumbstick covers for Dualshock 4 for like 3 or 4 bucks, and get free F76 with it! Everyone (meant as stores) around wanted to REALLY get rid of those F76 copies.
---
I usually use around 15$ a month on atoms anyway so I might aswell get something good from it 🤔
---
I meant more on the pass specifics. particular worlds are bad enough, but when you couple them with infinite storage... yeah.
---
except they can't go back and make the worlds any less private or the storage any less infinite, not at this point.
---
Hmm would that be unfair?  I mean people have wanted a public test server for new stuff.
---
If that is limited to "1st", it would just make the amount of feedback easier to handle.
---
OR, if Bethesda needs to restrict the number of players playing on the test server, would random selection be more fair way?
---
Best thing I’ve read in a while😂😂
---
That is just selecting shipping.
---
That has nothing to do with offering a separate paid for option that gives benefits, that you either fork up, or have a worst experience with?
---
you're gonna hit a stash limit soon, which is a bummer, but don't forget, you can pay 100 US Dollars per year to fix one of game's many flaws!
---
Bethesda went full Thanos on us,
---
“I WILL SHRED THIS PLAYERBASE DOWN TO ITS LAST WHALE AND THEN, WITH THE SUBSCRIBERS YOU’VE COLLECTED FOR ME, CREATE A NEW ONE. IT IS NOT WHAT IS LOST BUT ONLY WHAT IT IS BEEN GIVEN… A GRATEFUL PLAYERBASE.
---
If you really want to stick it to BGS, don’t play Fo4 or any other BGS title in your library. They get user data on how often your play their games, which is used to convince people to invest money in future projects. We should fucking tank their data for the next quarter. They should either fix it and apologize, or we start #boycottbethesda on social or something.
---
The cherry on top would be if someone found censorship on Chinese copies of the game, and we could lump them in with Blizzard and the NBA.
---
All my characters have Speed Demon. Cry me a river! :D
---
How naive can you be . Did you actually think Bethesda cares about anything except your money?
---
Everything they done up til now is milk the naive fallout fans.
---
Fallout’s been dead for at least 15 years.
---
Those emotes are fucking great. Wish i had something like that in survival.
---
well at least you got a map that as Todd says "fucking blows in the dark"
---
even though the CE guide book came with a (non glowy?) map too...
---
Like you really think people who, to begin with had no interest playing The Outer Worlds, will suddenly get hyped for the game because of Fallout 1st? It does not make any fucking sense. 
---
You could say the release of Fallout 1st would make you lose interest in Fallout 76, thus playing other games but why the fuck specifically The Outer Worlds? Because Obsidian = Good? But wait, Obsidian = Epic Store = Fortnite = Bad? Fuck, now I'm confused.
---
p2w or p2c is the samething call it what you want, the fact is that the paying players will have an advantage over the nonpaying player. so whats the difference just terminology. 
---
you wrote this long as post just to make yourself look like a total fo76 fan tool.
---
And bethesda be like, that'll be 100 dollars
---
I don't mind paying for a game once.
---
Check out this ["What happened last episode"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8) summary by the Internet Historian. I have watched it so many times already and it's hilarious every time. Even now one just can't help but be in disbelieve about how it got worse and worse at every turn. And the video is already a few months old, Bethesda hasn't stopped fucking up since then.
---
shoe polish is better dude. do they never teach boot lickers that saliva ruins shoes?
---
So for example I just scrapped everything I was carrying at a work station right now and everything in my junk tab disappeared. Did it get sent to my camp stash?
---
You just gotta sub for 1 month it costs less then what you would any other time.
---
Theres plenty of fans left and i wont be boycotting anything but its amazing to have seen a company totally burn every bit of trust and goodwill it had with a large part of its customer base. 76 has been an absolute nightmare right from the beta. Its baffling how its just miss after miss.
---
Remember when everyone complained about they shouldn't make the stash space unlimited and everyone had to suffer as they threw away all their valuable items with tears in their eyes?
---
Welp now they added unlimited stash AND you have to pay for it LMFAO FUCK YOOOU!
---
Funk to funky  
---
We know Major Tom's a junky
---
Path of exile is a great 2 parter. But i dont think these kids know what an actual rpg is.
---
Pretty sure it was in the plan from Day 1, so I'd say the game has probably been a little disappointing on revenue, but they always planned this extra path anyway. It'll still help, I'm sure. 
---
Unfortunately, I have no concept of what their server and storage costs must be. Hundreds of thousands a year, at least?
---
This is hardly a paid service. People are acting like Fallout 76 just went to a paid subscription, when this is just an optional premium pass. You don't want it, don't pay for it and literally nothing has changed, the game is the same game you have been playing all along.
---
Divine and free
---
Mate you just made the mistake or thinking that Bethesda gives a shit about your pissy little opinion. You dont matter to them mate. At all. So sitting at your computer telling rabble rabble rabble wont actually do fuck all. People like you cant just do things quietly, you have to let the whole world know exactly what you're thinking and you think that people actually care that you're mad or whatever but at the end of the day mate nobody cares. Especially not the boss hogs at Bethesda. There's talkers and doers my friend. You can botch about it or do something about it.
---
Kinda is bro, new popeyes sandwich is bomb.
---
bro 😎💪
---
What a disaster. I stopped playing months ago after my friends left. Since then I have noticed the arrival of things like Nuclear Winter, etc. but have held off rejoining because I wanted a private, modded server.
---
What we got instead was the standard server with an 8 player whitelist, and unrestricted travel between that private server and public servers. How much effort did that take? Probably very little. This approach allows someone to rent a private server, "farm" resources with no competition from other players and no-one to see or care what they do, and the ability to carry "farmed" loot back to public servers. Every other private server that I have ever rented (Ark, Conan, etc.) has been quarantined to protect the players in public servers. What this says to me is that either they haven't thought this through, or don't care. Or maybe both. Because of that free travel between private and public servers, if they ever add community mods I expect it will be cosmetic-only mods that have been approved by Bethesda. I expect they'll only be available through the online store, with Bethesda taking a hefty commission.
---
It seems the goal all along was to provide a tiered service, with obstacles built into the game specifically so that players could pay to have them removed. Private servers were just another trinket to encourage people to pay for a subscription, implemented in the simplest way possible and without regard to possible consequences.
---
If this game turns out to be profitable for Bethesda, I don't expect to see another single player game from them that doesn't contain unnecessary grinding and an online store that sells solutions to the grind.
---
I normally bought the $5 one. But now I'm not buying anymore. I've removed 76 from my ps4. Ive removed ESO as well. I was gonna pick up Elswyr for ESO soon but more I'm not. I might be only one person but I can and will still take away my money.
---
also still no 2fa hahaha
---
Proof???

This is the *internutz* Pal - we don't need no stinkin proof.  I'll take the word of some salty randos over stupid *proof* any day !

---

---
@hatsandthings thankyou so much for the help and advice friend I appreciate that, I will keep that in mind :)
---
To be honest that isn’t the only mention of similar mechanics in this community. I’m to lazy to scroll down and grab links, but if you do it - a lot of suggestions similar to that were popping out. First one I saw was probably 2 days after launch.
---
Comparing is the thief of joy. Even the devs of outer world said they want to be known for their hard work and not to be compared to Bethesda whom they are in good relation with still today.
---
You dont even realise we are on the same side and you say I'm stupid lol wow.
---
Yeah it’s mostly grinding for pvp. How about Atlas? It’s made by the guys who made ARK on the same engine so it does have some of he performance issues, but it’s quite good. It has a cool building system and even allows you to build and customise your own ships. IT also has something like a few hundred servers all running different portions of the map in squares so as to create a huge map where you can sail right to a different server. I think it would take upwards of 10 hours to get from what side to the other if you didn’t run into any major problems at sea. Check it out on YouTube.
---
Glad I never invested any time into this game.
---
You say that but most console gamers play other oine games and thus would already have the online sub anyway. This is on the console companies for charging you to use your own internet
---
Good bye. Bethesda.
---
You dont even realise we are on the same side and you think I'm stupid lol wow.
---
... he unironically said on a subreddit dedicated to Fallout 76.
---
I hope you don't expect them to replace your junk. Because you're gunna have a bad time.
---
It’s not bold, it’s insulting.
---
I want to commission a psychologist to deep dive and explain to me why people make these stupid edits. The worst is when they start acting like they are MCing a party and keep making multiple edits with little speeches in them over a period of time and then say shit like "gotta go!". Like alright man no asked you to stay in the first place so feel free.
---
They always have the same cringy message in them too like "never change reddit never change", or "my highest voted comment is about ______? Only on reddit hurr durr", or "gold? Really? Well gee thanks guys but I'd rather you donate the money to these charities.... " *throw up*
---
Do they honestly think they are giving an award speech? That anyone cares at all even a little? Do they think the people who upvoted or guilded the comment like it so much they are  gonna be checking in periodically for updates? Do they get so little attention outside the internet they just wanna bask in the moment?
---
At least do something productive like shill your mixtape...
---
Genius. Bethesda is over
---
Hahahahaha. Their new UNLIMITED stash is already deleting players scrap.
---
Somebody tell Trump that BGS has the Democratic National Committee files on one of their servers in Ukraine.
---
It’s a decent deal just for the suit and atoms alone for 1 month then cancel. I don’t ever need more stash then what I have and I probably won’t even use the private server cuz I bought the game to be online and play with random people for unique experiences.
---
Bro, sandwich and popeyes fries. Little known fact popeyes fries are the best.
---
I know they where before, but it allways looked that the no were more than the yes. 
---
but hey each to their own, I can not support this crazyness.
---
What if it had been a cry for help, and they really were replaced....
---
Shhh, don’t tell the plebs.
---
I haven't bought any atoms, was going to when Wastelanders dropped. I can buy the fridge and junk bot but they really don't seem worth it.
---
You don't like it. I do. Go do something else.
---
So you would say that the private server is good for raids and instances?
---
😭!
---
Good?
---
What a legend
---
Secure? No one can possibly register all possible combinations of new words or trademarks as domains accross all possible TLDs. That is perfectly normal.

Plus that's probably not a trademarked term and the proper spelling is 1st, not first.

---
He thinks he is flying,  
---
But the customer base is dying,  
---
He wanted to touch base,  
---
but instead spat in our face,  
---
Todd is now dead,  
---
At least in my head.
---
Did your camp get removed or is it inside the vault?
---
It'll be p2w😂😂😂
---
Yeah. You get access to something like 100+ games with it, Outer Worlds included. It's actually a pretty good deal. And if you just want to play Outer Worlds, you can just subscribe for a month or two while you play it then cancel, and you'll end up paying far, far less than retail price.
---
Why would you spend your own money on something? Just ridiculous.  /s
---
Sucks man.  Hope they take care of you though and thanks for the heads up.
---
Not even once.
---
holy crap lol
---
True. But ouside of the deathclaw Island... You're pretty pressed to find them anyways. But im "one of those guys". I found myself sneaking thru the bog at lvl 28 avoiding players killing eachother looking for a quest i could compete to get one of the worst survival rewards. Most fun and tense time i ever had. Tool 3 days and many tries but i own that shit harpoon gun.
---
@DivineAlmond oh yeah I see that man £100 per year for subscription that's madness lmao but people will pay it :/
---
Tried? I think they do.
---
Yep, still greeting me every time I log in. Still, it's marginally better than waking up to Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe" every morning and I personally don't really mind the guy.
---
You should also add Ubisoft.
---
Oh that's funny right there, I don't care who you are!
---
No, people are angry because theyve been enjoying this game, but now they've added an optional subscription. People are arguing if the perks go too far in providing an advantage in game.  Unless you're deciding on some principal against the sub benefits, it won't affect your game at all.
---
What!!!?  I gotta log back in.
---
Don't worry, there's tons of FO76 fans who defend everything Bethesda does. If Todd Howard started shooting puppies there would be FO76 fans saying "well they had it coming".
---
I know who they are now. I will hunt them down. I will find them and I will give them such a pinch.
---
My weapons are the same, idk what he's on about.
---
Yes. I also enjoyed Wasteland 3 immensely.
---
what? fallout 76 horribly broken???? :O surely bethesda will fix it right?? :)) i have hope guys stop hating!!!
---
A person that has friends that play Fallout 76? Who believes this phony?
---
What I heard from a loser Bethesda fanboy was that it feels like a peepee in your butt
---
It used to be sweet little lies.
---
Now it's outright bullshit from the biggest Steer at the Auction Yard.
---
Neither sweet, nor little.
---
You really should learn to research your claims _before_ reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeing.  
---
It’s not instanced, it’s not peer to peer, the server isn’t hosted on your computer.
---
I spent 4 hours playing on a private world with friends.  It was lag free, we set off multiple nukes, and missions/events were firing off as expected.  
---
So, shut up and sit down.  It’s not ‘illegal’.
---
I have a pet theory that the budget for 76 is drying up. They rushed this cash grab out with year old suggestions that could have been easily implemented because they’re trying to have money to pay devs etc for the wastelanders expansion work. And that’s why that was delayed. This may also explain the changes to the atom shop adding incrementally more gameplay effect.  They’re trying to entice players because we don’t want to buy their cosmetics and they’re floundering. 
---
Ps I hope we all direct our hate toward the people making big decisions for Bethesda and this game specifically. Not the little guy who spends 8 hours making a wall texture, or any of the lower down devs.
---
No, the whole page is practically a copy. Adding few words like fuck and shit doesn't count as commentry in real world.
---
Isn't that subjective? Do you speak for all living beings everywhere? Huh, I didn't know.
---
Yup. He made a post over on r/Fallout
---
What a joke this all is. The inclusion of the New Vegas ranger armor really makes it too. So out of touch, so shameless... I knew the game was doomed after the vault raid update, just been waiting for this final cue to uninstall. bye bye 76, was sort of fun, sometimes.
---
Thanks. I looked in to it more and decided to bite. Whoo.
---
*division 2
---
Thank you.
---
Just need ANOTHER $100 on top of $100 for FO1st and $60 for PS+
---
I hate that location!!! To many raiders spawn there to take me over
---
The buck stops with wastelanders. The pressure is on them to deliver something worthwhile with it and thats not broken. Unlike every other single addition. That was basically dead in days or hours or like arkos broken from the start. Theyll either win people back or bury this game for good.
---
Again. Depends on the one you want and where from. Also I haven't eaten take away in years now. Apparently for a cheese burger at Maccas its $3.25
---
LOL PAY TO WIN!? 
---
Yeah, pay to win that hardcore PvE adventure mode!
---
What the hell are you talking about? Adventure mode is non-competitive. You can't "win" anything anyway!!
---
You're pretty stupid if this upsets you.
---
Definitely stay forest bound till you have a grasp of what's going on. There is also heaps of YouTube videos to help you through. It is a struggle to start with, getting food &amp; all the scrap etc. It does become a lot easier as you level up &amp; know what your doing.
---
“Until the bugs are sorted out” he says. 
---
Soooo...never?
---
maybe its bugged for some people then
---
fair enough i shall delete this post for now unless more proof comes
---
but SOME people ARE having issues.........
---
you're only just now starting to get worried?
---
let me, a disillusioned ex-player, tell it to you like it is
---
this game has no future
---
What’s SBQ yea I’ve got a combat rifle for things like that lol
---
Well they aren’t earning any new fans, but that won’t affect their AAA game lines.
---
Yep, little bat lights come out of the sides, and it has little pumpkin stickers on it. The fog machine is amazing. 
---
I only have those one, but my partner has both. She has them blowing out of her door, and they blend together to well. Plus the bats fly about in random locations it seems. She has her bed a floor about the fog machine, and bats will randomly fly around the bed when you sleep in it
---
I applaud you sir. In this huge pile of rancid shit, this festering oozing boil of an update, and you choose to take the thinest more faint silver lining and choose to focus on that. Even as everything continues to crumble and burns, you will look for the weakest, most dull glimmers of good and grasp on to that.
---
Sunk Cost Fallacy.
---
You are a brainless fan if you think they'll care at this point.
---
Bethesda: “We could fix those problems, for a price...”
---
Oh, so dramatic. Your pathos is inspiring.
---
The fuck is vault steel?
---
I had the Communist Salute on my emote wheel and used it a lot. Although it didn't display any icon on the wheel it did perform the emote. With the new patch it's gone. Even if removed from the Atomic Shop I would have expect those who "purchased" it would retain it?
---
They’re probably enjoying it. We’re the ones who need to cope with it.
---
It's not bold.
---
It's outright insulting.
---
Come on Bethesda, just make this premium thing have unlimited storage in general and then I’ll subscribe to it.  Junk only is well... junk.
---
But they have the audacity to put three features that should be in the game from release for free into a 100$ yearly subscription in a game that was a 60$ title on launch.
---
Haha, I don’t believe you!     
---
What are doing on this reddit FO76 forum, if you quit two months ago?!
---
Nah, you still playing!
---
Didn’t know there were Survival exclusive BPs. Unless I’m misinterpreting what you mean
---
🤣
---
Bugthesda is privately owned, last I saw.
---
I would give him more money to fight any lawsuits he has to put up with than I would give Bethesda. This guy is funny. He should reveal himself.
---
It sounds great but I mean, I'm leaving 76 because of scummy business practices and the Ark devs don't seem to be much better than Bethesda is now.
---
Deserved lol
---
Dude your a legend I was trying to find this THANK YOU &lt;3
---
Didn’t know there were Survival exclusive BPs. Unless I’m misinterpreting what you mean.
---
That’s pretty dark.
---
I can't stop you, but you're a still a dumbass.
---
a lot being said with no substance... just like Fallout 76
---
The thing about being close to vault 76 is it doesn't cost anyone to come see your store. I'm personally far from everywhere, and it probably cost people 30 caps to me, which might be offputting. I haven't been back or playing again for long, so I don't have a good store or many things for sale, but it is something that I might be interested in. And if I do keep playing and get interested I will probably choose a place close to Vault 76.
---
Hahahaha you idiots
---
&gt;Go outside.
---
You go outside! I’ll play Outer Worlds instead.
---
Man frankly, i'm not gonna type up an essay on how wrong you are, other than to say that the "dancing skeletons of Skyrim" are as bad as a game that literally bricked PC that played it is..just wow.  so ill just leave it here.  God thats a lot of text.
---
Comedy gold, thank you.
---
This company is garbage now i used to love their games but they destroyed their own image at least Obsidian still make true Fallout style games just sad that Elder Scrolls IP is probably dead in and will turn into a mobile style microtransaction trash in their hands now.
---
For those that don't know and think this gentleman is talking about Xbox. Xbox game pass for PC is $1 for the first month, and $5 per month afterwards for now. 
---
It's for PC even though it's still called xbox game pass.
---
And yes it does indeed include outer worlds!
---
You know it's gonna be fun when he starts the video laughing.
---
It costs $100 for a year of membership because that's as long as they're planning on releasing updates for it for.
---
the private server features are pretty fucking barebones at best at the moment and some reports they arnt even fucking working right (though others are saying they are not seeing any issues like already dead spawns /npcs etc) 
---
but yeah its just a shame they seem to just rush it out without adding any real features to private servers at the moment. no real persistence (no reason to lose your build if you log off since its private) and other features.
---
and things like the stash box arnt even working right for many pklayers.
---
RIP
---
I blame the video game industry as a whole. The $60 price point for a new releases game does not cover the cost of founding huge game projects. If they bump up prices for inflation to cover the cost company's wouldn't be looking into finding other means to recover
---
Happy Birthday! 12 is quite an exciting time.
---
LOL, who the fuck cares to have an Adventure mode private server?
---
Wtf are you upset about?
---
Pay to win... PvE adventure mode? How do you even win in Adventure mode?
---
LMAO, good one !
---
The subreddit still blindly defends this awful game, it’s laughable, really. This latest cash grab for private servers is just disgusting and is another example of Bethesda’s bullshit excuses to cash out from the game.
---
Shame! SHAME on this company! Lecherous money grabbing sonsabitches! What kind of intolerable assholes do this to a perfectly good IP?
---
Lol. Keep dreaming. Likely dude would settle for a cup of coffee and a handjob. Not that it'll ever get that far.
---
Yep Bethesda didn't have an ip to hock for revenue this Holiday 2019 season so the just decided to squeeze it out of the few loyal players they have left in Fallout. Right wrong who cares Bethesdas getting paid. For now.
---
You should see what's in my refrigerator
---
SBQ = Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Its like that but theres also this feeling that it just feels right. Like maybe this is what you shouldve been doing all along. Suddenly you dont hate yourself as much and you just start living you know? Like you dont have to hide anymore.  Oh, you were being sarcastic...
---
Ive literally pointed that out and you kept attacking. Idiot. Enjoy the block.
---
Based off what other people said about similar locations in the past, it probably just got removed.
---
ugh why do i still want to buy this game even after all this shit
---
no no no .......dont give into it.......nooooooooooooooo
---
This Reddit sub does not represent the Fallout 76 player base.
---
You loose your grip on the English language sometimes. We all do, really.
---
THANK you, it’s just saddening to see so many loonies rushing to defend this game no matter how bad this shit gets! Paying $100 a year for private servers???? You barely even see anyone else anyway!
---
When you're a developer piggybacking off of the same engine used for your last game, slightly modifying some assets, and implementing Radiant AI shouldn't be that hard.
---
Wonderful.  Simply wonderful.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhaahahahahah wipes tears from my eyes XD
---
Not on display with pride and accomplishment?
---
Ive been on servers where I wait until the hour mark comes and I get no notification and dont even see the event at Bolton Greens.
---
Every week. It was a named 3* weapon. Some were godly most were just meh. Couple were totaly trash. Depend on your build.
---
Action hero was a Two shot/faster fire rate/ something .50 cal.
---
Unstoppable monster is a deathclaw gauntlet that. Is what the name implies.
---
Every week complete some challenges and get free scrips or a cool weapon for your build. Miss every minute of survival being gone. Sometimes you just make 20 mini nukes and get some stealth boys and make it rain on the people who were in stealth boys waiting for players to fast travel. Brings a tear to my eye.
---
"lol u r little kid because u dont like garbage game XD"
---
Yes I do, I am a long time fallout fan, played all the games, and I started FO76 a month ago, Im all ready lvl 95 and I LOVE THE GAME, I love some cosmetics in the game and I spend my money on the ones I like. Fallout 76 is one of the best experiences in gaming I ever had. It actually made me finally buy a really good gaming PC. So basically for FO76 alone I spent more then a thousand of euros so I could improve my amazing experience even more, thats how great this game feels for me.
---
Well... I already got an email from bethesda, thanking me for contacting and asking to take a survey. They send this first before handling my bug xD (i know, it's probably automated).
---
It does however, count as parody.
---
"they"
---
you are one of them, do not speak as if you are one of us
---
yup
---
49.95. with a 80 buck digital CE.
---
You already know so too late.
---
Great response. Very well thought out.
---
Well, yeah. People are gullible shits.
---
It's a give and take economy.
---
This is the kind of backlash that will hopefully bring change.
---
Them buying the sub hurts us who don't in the long run. This will lead to more pay to win scenarios. Good riddance to them, and I hope they lose their characters too!
---
I saw 2 level 3s in flatwood the other day and thought i have stuff to spare but than said fk it. They can find their own ivory grip plan. Probably alts anyway.
---
All up on a Saturday night!
---
Late to the party much LOL!
---
You had me there at the beginning lol
---
If you put your camp around white springs you know people are going to stop by no matter what. It’s in the center of the map and it gets the most mid-high level traffic than anywhere else imo. I turn my machines on when I log in and turn them back off in an hour or two because I hit the 26-28k mark and get worried I’ll go over. I just can’t stand it when I see a level 17 at the snake! No one that’s farming ws wants a level 10 pipe rifle, like literally no one.
---
ligma balls
---
You want the survival building mmo aspect?
---
Rust
---
You want a good story driven bethesda like game?
---
The Outer Worlds
---
Amen, game died when Bethesda took the reins. New Vegas was a great final hurrah but this is just awful.
---
I've been boycotting them since they ate dead space
---
Just take the L.
---
Can you use both the mothman and the halloween fog machine at the same time or is it just one or the other?
---
Months of work to do what? The game still uses the same engine Fallout 4 did, only minorly tweaked.
---
Model work, and re-implementing their Radiant AI shouldn't take 9 months. And thats assuming from E3 to Q1 of next year.
---
In all seriousness tho this is pretty mind boggling, like Bethesda was doing well and people were starting to say the game got better, and wastelanders was pretty hype, then they delay what might be the best part of the game and come up with this bullshit immediately after.
---
Did they think this is a good idea? Just wow.
---
EA 2.0
---
I have t seen the new emotes. What are they???
---
Get over yourself won't you, this sub has gone to the dogs.
---
Will be on Xbox Game Pass on the 25th!
---
This hysteria will last a week top like the past 20 times before. In 3 months, you will ask this question again, OP.
---
Why the hell are you fine with the costs lol
---
Yao Guai Ghouls are the only ghoulified animals in 76, as far as I know, and they've been in the game way before the latest patch.
---
Both at the same time.  They mix well.
---
Thank fuck for that now I dont have to argue with someone that has no idea what the subject matter even was. Later.
---
Why would you say you appreciate the extra time? Seriously, this is naive. Where is all the criticism in 2019? We don’t have to whine online, just ignore the game and never buy/touch it. And like NEVER preorder games.
---
Not on this sub
---
I suspect he will go back into hiding like he did last time
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
&gt;I don't care about p2w or subs or anything but I can't justify paying that amount for nothing different apart from being alone.
---
whelp even lads like you have their limits huh
---
This is epic. I hope Bethesda can take a hint.
---
That's fine! In fact, I actually encourage people to do so! Never spend money on something you don't like! But I've not been affected by any game-breaking bugs or loss of progress. And I play nearly daily since it came out. I said earlier, the game could stay exactly as it is right now- and I'd still play it. I'd be sad for no new content, but I, and no one in my gaming group has encountered any major issues.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
This is glorious..I was actually not bothered with the membership thing, UNTIL I read about the stash perk. We have been begging for this since BETA. Got fed a line of shit that they would look at increasing it slowly as not to mess with server stability. Then they go and paywall it. I'm wondering what other gameplay perks they are gonna lock behind this membership when wastelanders gets here. This is really disheartening and makes it so I really dont even bother playing. My time ingame has dwindled as of late because lack of content, and the great interactions with other players feels like it's going to get farther and fewer between because of these 8 player private sessions. The players and the great community was the one thing it really had going for it. The players made this game super enjoyable and drive it forward, not the devs. This is a slap in the face. After all I feel that I've defended this game. All my posts saying, give it time, they hear us, the atom shop is pretty cool with the stuff it offers..I just cant do that anymore. What happens over the next few days determines whether of not I just leave it out of feeling stepped on. Which is sad, I really have enjoyed this game, but I cant get behind the choice to add gameplay changing features behind a paywall. That was just shitty.
---
Yeah, exactly what I expected and l wrote about before.
---
Private server is basically pay to win in its finest.
---
Yet some ppl dont understand.
---
For Australia it's closer to $200 per year. It's ridiculous.
---
"Bold" sure is a funny way to say horribly misguided and evidence of complete and total detachment and disregard for the small community of players who, despite Betheda/Zenimax's best efforts, are keeping the smoldering ashes of this game alive. What the actual fuck are you doing Bethesda/Zenimax?
---
I really don't understand why it's so baffling that someone can enjoy the game? Aside from the few things I said above, I have no issues with it. I've had no issues with it since day 1. It's even taken top spot in my all-time favorite games.
---
Are we stupid? Or could we just be loving the game and simultaniously have enough money to pay for our hobby?
---
It's satire though, right?
---
Remember when this company made Morrowind?
---
*Fucking Morrowind?*
---
One of the best damn digital RPGs ever?
---
What the fuck happened?
---
Thankyou too for the help @Aussjex01 :) any help and advice is appreciated, I just thought I'd give a new game to try even though I've heard bad things about atm lol  I'm just bored of rdr2 and gears 5 lol
---
It's not always there. Vendor inventories will sometimes have rare plans. This is one of them, and it's only available every now and then. Check daily or whenever you change servers.
---
Twitter and Reddit are a minority, friendo. So are the youtubers who couldn't care less but get easy views from parroting, "76 bad," every time the game does anything.
---
They're so good lol. The mothman dance and the robot dance.
---
What do they support? If they want support they better make fully fledged DLC’s like Far Harbor for FO4, not just using reskinned assets and sell them at 4$. This is crazy and just fkn greed.
---
Hmm I hear a raging bitter asshole flapping its hole somewhere. OP must still be talking.
---
I uninstalled 76 last night because of what they've done.
---
I was referring to the ones you were calling out. They seem to be genuinely enjoying it. And that’s the truth.
---
If theres alot of items ill pay to visit but if i get there and your 30 weapons are all non legendary ill burn your camp to the ground.
---
Free fast travel to the vault only matters to the poor players. I see forest camps and look for ammo. I 100% expect any weapons and armors to be lower lvld for new players.
---
So if im not interested in a big ammo buy i mostly skip them or hit up central camps to see whats for sale.
---
I had a Charleston camp for ages and sold mostly ammo and chems. Business was good but i look back on my own growth when i see camps that way. Starter players need shops too so im all for it.
---
November 2018 Me: Well, it's pretty glitchy but they'll fix it and come out with tons of great free features for the players so i'll continue to support it.
---
[October 2019 Me](https://youtu.be/A-sA-NqMlvI)
---
The game itself is pretty good or at least definitely nowhere near as bad as the internet says it is, but Bethesda seems hell bent on putting a lot of stuff behind a paywall and fucking over the playerbase.
---
It's like they want to ruin the game's and their reputation even more instead of making it better.
---
Good luck getting into my private world, you broke bitch.
---
And I thought they would go free to play
---
keep telling you that excuse to make you feel better, 
---
after almost a year the game still lacks content, lacks bug/glitches fixes, lacks testing, etc. 
---
do you really think something is going to change, did you really think ppl havent put more money into the game to support it. I paid 60 bucks for the game and then I put 30 more buck into it and I know for a fact im not the only one. did something changed no not at all, actually thing got worst for a few months. 
---
and now you want me to pay 100 a year for a game that still half assed, along to having shit behind pay walls  or  left out off the game to make more money off it. 
---
i would understand your point if
---
the game was way more stable, if the bugs/glitches were almost not visiable, if at least 2 times a month new contect would be avaliable and if I didnt pay 60 bucks for it. 
---
but again tell yourself whatever to make you feel better.
---
Its why i didnt buy fallout 76 in the first place, im only here because i have seen recent news about this $99 membership lol so happy i stayed away.
---
Exactly. Well said.
---
Exactly. FO4+free mods should be enough to kill the Fallout itch.
---
I will stick your head on a spike.
---
Lol i uninstalled months ago and check here from time to time to see if things have improved.   
---
   
---
Oh how they have not improved.
---
These people are just plain dumb, they can’t comprehend it and so they stir it up to avail oneself of stupidness!
---
Ok will do - I wasn't sure they still had cycling inventories, as the last time I played they didn't have even 1/10th of the current stock. Good to know :)
---
Patrol Duty event. High chance to drop.
---
The time you’re all spending complaining about this game could be spent planting crops in Stardew Valley! Get to farming. 
---
But really, you’re investing a lot of time and energy into hating something when you could be doing something else. You’re still giving them attention despite your anger. You could just ignore it an move on with your lives. Obviously, you care enough about the game to spend the time to comment on the current state of things and I get it. We all want this game to be the best it can be. However, what we want and what the reality is are two separate things sometimes.
---
That being said, do what makes you happy.
---
f76 will not be able to handle q4 2019 and q1 2020. so many good and interesting games coming out.  most who abandoned won't pick it up again. game won't have any new content after q4 2020 or maybe q2 2021 tops. jump the ship fellers before its too late.
---
If youre deleting the game and on ps4 can I have your stuff
---
Heard about the subscription plan via YouTube, remembered this place was full of Bethesda apologists and rocked up with popcorn 😁
---
A cool insight into how to think out loud.
---
Patrol Duty is great, but it's difficult to get it to activate consistently: so I figured I'd just farm the caps and buy it :)
---
/r/IAmVerySmart
---
You forgot the part where the English tweet used language to minimize the ordeal, and the Chinese language tweet was harsh and critical and staunchly pro-China.
---
That was quick. What a rookie mistake. As for the site, it's what Bethesda should expect as a reaction.
---
This subscription is an absolute joke. It's comical in an uneasy nervous laughter sort of way. They love riding that train into the ground. What's sad is I absolutely love the previous fallout games. I'm a huge fan, but Fallout 76 is such an egregious obvious cash grab. Money corrupts.
---
Because I can afford that if its worth it. It just isn't at the min
---
Need an attractive face to promote your store...i can dig it.
---
Biomutant in a few months
---
If it was't such a bad game it would have worked out.
---
Yeah, I'll be in my private server playing with buddies, so try and grief away.
---
A true hero of the wasteland!
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Thank you for being a good human
---
The costs fine if the severs are more flexible. £12 a month I won't notice going.
---
Outer Worlds is coming out. If it's at all decent, that's going to draw people away, at least on console.
---
PC is a bit iffy due that Epic nonsense.
---
I'd have to say you might be on the money but it still doesn't make sense... any of it... why burn a perfectly good IP to dust unless you've got some kind of plan behind it.   
---
What if..and bare with me..(puts on tin foil hat) this is all a "new coke" strategy... They release this stinking pile of garbage with a NEW FLAVOR... make what they can and when people have absolutely had enough of the bullshit... they release Classic Fallout! The way it always should have been!..
---
actually, I think this would count as parody.
---
Quality post 👍🏼
---
I feel like Bethesda's business model has been "lie to the consumer and hope they don't notice" since Oblivion or maybe even prior...
---
Mod support would kill their atom shop, so it's not gonna happen. Also it's an mmo, mods could brake everything what isn't already broken.
---
I am feeling very sorry for the guys who spend the original price. Bethesda lied to you about the game. It is like you are getting robbed by Bethesda. This company derserves to go down.
---
Yea it's very annoying with the new event system. But if you have 2-3 friends to finish the event with, it's very likely one of you will get it.
---
Just because someone doesn't want to buy something, or is opposed to people supporting something, doesn't mean they are broke. And for $100 you could buy 2 brand new games. Instead you choose to spend it on a buggy mess. Are you happy to broadcast you are a sucker, and don't care what game companies do, no matter how manipulative and deceptive, you will just keep giving them money.
---
Small claims filing deadlines have expired in most jurisdictions by this point.
---
Your a dick, no reason for posts calling on griefing.
---
Grow up &amp; get over it
---
I agree with you. The way they explain it in the patch notes and in they're other articles comes off very cocky and "gives us your money already" sort of way.
---
That’s not really the case
---
Many active players he have several miles to offload the extra stuff.   Storage space is not a problem - it’s an inconvenience.
---
Junk is the least of the problem - many players keep only what they need and don’t even pick up junk anymore
---
That’s not going to change anything.
---
Bad luck. Hit a queen with a massive fight today. 3 legendarys in the crowd plus her. Was bannanas.
---
This game is a dud and people you'll pay for this are beyond saving.
---
Wrong, I did buy it because I took one for the team (my group and I like to test out new stuff for bugs and such), and Im still getting a shitty ass connection. In fact, it seems worse for me after buying the one month subscription. So maybe Fallout 1st not only sucks ass, it also screws with your game.
---
best post I’ve seen in here in ages.
---
I called this 336 days ago on this sub. Issues from day one were suspiciously similar to what the monthly stipend on ESO “fixes” for you. 
---
If I remember correctly Bethesda had some legal trouble with what they wanted to charge to play ESO once the game was bought. An almost unplayable game without subscription was the compromise. A new business model was created. Somebody else can look it up if they have the inclination, I personally can not be arsed. 
---
The next thing to happen will be, all those free DLC’s will get lighter, a vault here a group task there &amp; then the meatier updates will be called something like “chapters” not a DLC and not covered by the monthly playable tax. Another £49 please. Been through it with ESO.   If they haven’t already, I haven’t touched fo76 for 10 months. 
---
Bethesda has stopped producing games for gamers and started producing “products” for investors. Sad times.
---
Games like FinalFantasy XIV doesn't need you to pay for PlayStation plus to access their servers. You pay directly to square, your monthly sub and ur good.
---
I already dropped 76 in favour of Dragon Age Inquisition (and Origins) to play while waiting for OW :).
---
dont get me wrong, i enjoyed some parts of the game also and hell would still play it if it wasn't going in the direction that its going in, im not shitting on 76 because i think its a bad game, im shitting on it because i care about it and i really want to see it get better and not for them to blatantly lie to us and add things they told us they would not add at e3, you know?
---
So is your credibility.
---
The subecription seems to be making it worse, actually.
---
Nah, I just like to spend money on actually enjoyable things.
---
Any mmo sales model in the past. They make you spend another 60 every year for reskined content and an increased level cap. I'm proud to say I never played WoW because blizzard paved a very dark path for other publishers.
---
You can try, I'd love that.
---
If you need i can mod one for you. Ultracite is a pain in the ass to craft.
---
Why though?
---
well im glad you havent seen any major bugs, also good that you keep enjoying the game. I have seen my fair share off major bugs, and dont have anything to do. 
---
I just dont like that they made the problem knowing that later down the road they would give you a "fix" but you have to pay for it or adding new game mechanics after charging us at least 60 bucks for it. 
---
I really think the outcry wouldnt be as laud if the game was free from the get go and I had the choice to support or not. 
---
but hey happy hunting.
---
Haha, I was just kidding you! (can't help myself!) 😂
---
Its gonna take AngryJoe. Jim Sterling. Laymen Gaming and fucking ACG giving it 9s or 10s for me to get it. Im Done
---
I'd say Bethesda is the worst of them, they never finished or fixed Skyrim or Fallout 4 and then tried to make money on the work that modders put into finishing their products. Literally tried cashing in on free labour, multiple times.
---
Probably new players. The game went on sale recently.
---
Please Bethesda sell the Elder Scrolls IP to CDPR and the Fallout IP to Obsidian i don't trust your trash company to do anything but ruin these IPs anymore.
---
Same here bud. Premium membership with included Swift kick to the teeth, exclusively for you and up to seven friends.
---
I think they forgot her. Both myself and a friend picked the bundle up, but couldn't find the witch.
---
OK legit asking how we can do this? Can some seo guy can help us here?
---
to a high level player SBs are nothing more than a nuisance.
---
stop shaking me goddamn screen the server can barely keep up as it is.
---
I said goodbye to this dumpster fire in the first few days of playing... i've just stuck around to warm my bitter heart by the flames.
---
Its a known bug for xbox. Are you on xbox or something else?
---
You already spent $60 on the base game and god knows how much else on atoms, why would you spend almost twice what the base game cost (despite the price dropping to $40 days after release), for something that isn’t worth 50 cents?
---
It's in the atom shop rn but yes they can
---
I'll pay
---
No. The junk you scrap at a work bench should be in your inventory (under the Junk tab)
---
Transferring to stash or scrap box is a separate action
---
You need more upvotes!
---
Yes. Once claimed while being a member it stays even if you unsub.
---
Right! Its so cheap. One guy told me that a pack of smokes is 30$ ! Holy fuck how do you guys even afford food.
---
Time to continuously grief anyone who bought this.
---
The mashed potatoes have meat in the gravy.
---
Hard choice.
---
One year of this or two years' subscription to PS Now.  Hmmm lemme think about it.....
---
how are you going to grief them? steal their corn? 
---
or going to slap them? if thats your grieffing its time to buy it so we can get some "pvp"... time to polish tesla and stealth bois
---
I agree with them. Nothing matters, you can’t change the world. Do what you want because in 100 years, no-one will remember you or the decisions you made.
---
What platform you on?
---
Shit, I forgot all about wasteland 3. Just went and checked and noticed I had a fuck ton of backer emails from them to go through, haha.
---
Git gud
---
I know and I’m tempted. But only because I’ve not actually bought any atoms.
---
It’s still shitty though.
---
I mean the game needs more quests, this couldn’t have been a reward?
---
Because your a sheep. You just paid more than Xbox live or PSN costs per month. Have fun with your ranger armor that reminds you of A BETTER GAME.
---
Holy fuck is this for real?
---
It was removed. There used to be two entrances to that cave and now there's only one and that one looks a lot different.
---
PSN?
---
Seriously. When I came back I bought some Ultracite PA plans from a store. I didn't know you could get them for free now so I threw away about 1k caps. I also bought Jetpack plans for about 1.5k. Then I saw in another store Jetpack plans priced much lower so I bought them to try and make some money back. I don't have much in my store so people probably don't visit much for that reason also. A few plans. Some chems. Maybe I should just close it so people don't waste their time coming to it.
---
Get s nice fixer for it
---
I saw a picture of this someone posted on reddit before. IIRC also from poland.
---
Man... The U.S. Marines just take tax money. You should try that.
---
I wouldn't be too bothered. Private server is just a normal server with less players, other than being able to pick and choose a relatively small number of players there is no benefit between private and normal adventure.
---
When, or should i say 'if', the private servers allow for modding/tweaking/persistent then they might be worth something.
---
Woah, that would be horribly shitty
---
Those items don't change the game in any way. If you don't buy the premium pass the game stays exactly how it has always been. The price of the game is irrelevant when it comes to monetization. When you bought Fallout 4 for 60$ Bethesda still turned around and asked for $20 for an expansion didn't they? When I bought Elder Scrolls online full price, they still ask me to buy an expansion every year for $50, I still have to pay $15 if I want a craft bag. If you bought the new expansion but spent the crowns, you are going to have to fork over another $15 to finish the story to the expansion you bought for $50. People have demanded content be free, it has to be paid for somehow.
---
1: Get rich.
---
2: Burn bridges.
---
This is so disappointing one of my favorite games and there just gunna try and divide the community with this update
---
Yeah lets just retroactively act like 3 and 4 for that matter weren't fantastic.
---
07
---
Tbh I felt mugged, when I saw it for £6 (about $10) just weeks after I’d paid full price. 
---
But, I’d enjoyed it enough, it’s given me value for money, I’m not playing at the moment, a mix of feeling a bit dead ended and not massively enjoying the path it was taking. I will dip back in for wastelanders, I’m glad they held it a bit to get it right. I really hope that it’s going to be the turning point again. I’m conflicted. 
---
I’ve harped in about it but, the humour always kept me in fallout games, even when the going was tough, something abstract or quirky would make you laugh. 
---
That’s almost totally missing from this. Part of it was NPCs - but there is less risqué humour.
---
It will never be worth it you dumb prick, the game still has bugs in it from a year ago, they released a shitty half baked unplayable raid with shit rewards. The game is fucking trash and these devs prey on people like you.
---
I'm partial to their dirty rice myself.
---
Thanks for your comment, I don’t like people showing off that they gave money to charity. That wasn’t my point. I’m just trying to say that arguing that we just want free stuff is such bs. If something is worth my money then I don’t mind spending it. A $100 pay wall for stuff that should be either free or just behind a small one time payment is more than enough. We weren’t sold what this game has turned into and I would say the same thing about any product that has been sold to me from any other company.
---
proof?
---
I just enjoy the game and play for fun, it's not like they're forcing me to buy atoms or the subscription. If someone chooses to spend money on it then it's their business. I'm just wondering why there's and outrage now and not in 2018 when they said private servers would be a paid service.
---
Bluescreens and getting stuck or falling underground every other match needs to be repaired also.And trigger gettin stuck also happening too too often.
---
I'm not blindly defending BGS here, I don't currently play 76, I've only gotten up to level 28, not a massive player if this game. The other BGS games I have really enjoyed, just letting you know before I give my 2 cents.
---
The thing people would do well to remember is that Bethesda operates under Zenimax, who can call shots and make demands about what direction certain things go. Bethesda put a lot on 76. They bet big and it didn't pay off. It's coming up on a year since release and they are probably behind on their sales and Atom Shop targets, needing another way to contribute to the income stream. For the record I don't agree with the subscription method, it doesn't seem right, but we as a community, don't have access the whole decision making process that led to this. It is unfair to blame BGS when they are not the only party at play here.
---
A lot of people are talking about the stash increase, but don't mention the decrease in server size. I'm pretty sure it's a hard cap of 8 people per private server, which equals more stability and more resources per player, slowing greater freedom with stash size.
---
Just my thoughts but yeah.
---
lmao same, comrade
---
All the players o know that we’re fairly diehard have given up. And it’s supposed to be social so that rules me out.
---
Yeah that was the one
---
HA good one
---
We can only hope that The Outer Worlds will save us.
---
Ah man... That was such a bad game. I don't want to buy it again.
---
Oh same graphics engine, sure. And the rest of old stuff is still there.
---
But Fallout 4 didn't have any separation of server and client. That's all new. Fallout 4 simply didn't have them.
---
Fallout 4 didn't have multiple players, either. There's a lot of new but the whole multiplayer and separation have been the biggest amount of work.
---
There's so many kids on here that don't understand that people don't want to spend that much money on video games. They also don't think that anyone should have a dissenting opinion. I hope these people aren't hypocrites and complain about stuff they aren't directly involved in, but I somehow doubt that
---
i always thought "how can i get rid of all this heavy junk, i would even pay for that!" than bethesda my personal christmal angel came down to earth to help me.
---
clearly you haven't experience private worlds and unlimited stash yet. they're bad by themselves, but coupled together it's quite p2w.
---
Linking it from reddit with many mentions of the text [Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com) is a good start. Seriously.
---
I can show you some building tips once your a little higher, no point worrying about that now though.
---
my gt is the same as my reddit id
---
If I'm on &amp; not busy in an event I'm happy to help
---
The classic "be careful what you wish for"
---
I'm still enjoying it, thanks for asking
---
I don’t know, TOW just doesn’t interest me right now. Hope the ones who are get the game they want and maybe one day I’ll  get around to playing it.
---
Well that was a joy.
---
And that means it falls under fair use right? So they wouldn’t have grounds to sue?
---
At first I was excited about the wastelanders delay, thinking “omg they’re going to get serious if they’re putting that much time into making it better.”  and then we find out the real reason ...
---
Exactly, I uninstalled F76 for a bunch of game pass games. Way more bang for your buck. Bethesda shat the bed and is rolling in it.
---
https://discord.gg/fxqbde
---
I got screenshots so i can preserve this lol
---
Yeah, he’ll probably just get a cease and desist letter. He’ll still own the URL, though.
---
So you are telling me that having 24/7 captured Munitions factory with zero competition isnt p2w?
---
I'm honestly surprised it held out for so long. I'm curious what this will do for the next Fallout in the series.
---
I didn't buy the subscription, but if someone chooses to then it's their business.
---
Wow :.( I’m sorry to hear that :(
---
These features should be In the base game. A limit on your home bases scrap capacity is detrimental to the gameplay loop and it gives people who buy the pass an advantage (that's a bad thing if you didn't know) and private servers should not have to cost you money. What they're doing is milking the rest of money from the games player base before moving on to the next gen.
---
Yours?
---
I’m on PC.
---
I'm on PS4 lol
---
PC
---
What about the robot dance?
---
Bethesda is far from the worst of them. I'm guessing you weren't around for Diablo 3 at launch. They did fix it later, but it was way worse. 
---
Bethesda doesn't keep predatory lootboxes in fallout 76. Sure the micro transactions are overpriced and stuff is glitchy, but its not nearly as bad as some mobile games. 
---
Bethesda is still shit. But EA, Activision-Blizzard are way worse. They are insidious and greedy, bethesda is just incompetent and greedy.
---
By not smoking 😂
---
I could see that. I respect that input and thank you for it.
---
I’m gonna chuck assloads of orbital strikes, shoot grenades during queen fights, scrap/store stacks of 50 rugs, and everything else that I know will crash the public world that you’re in. (Oh and I’ve tested it too)
---
Go have fun with your “friends” on your stupid ass 12.99 a month private server.
---
r/FalloutFirst
---
Yeah; not going on that pony ride, I enjoy the game, but unless they add a new connecting state as a download with new beasties, challenges and storyline then this little black duck ain't gonna part with a brass razoo. The imagination that Bethesda has at their finger tips and all they can offer is the same game we all have been playing for a year on a paid for private server with a cup full of treats, its Halloween not April Fools.
---
Then they claim in the hype that they try to make the game exciting for all players (paraphrasing) mmmmmmm. Come on Beth you are better than this fo3, fo4 and fo76 tells me you are and can be better than that and there are whole new worlds to explore over the borders.
---
look like you are butthurt. you paid your xbox live/psn "subscrition" that cost more then internet connetion per month... sounds like scam to me
---
That’s the smartest thing they could have done with that service. Not bad.
---
For real though this is one of the biggest scams I’ve ever seen and people are falling for it
---
Honestly the outfit and atoms are the only reason I'm thinking of getting it for one month. I'm waiting to see if they drop the price from all the backlash first tho
---
All good - I'm actually just curious about the base laser, not the ultracite one :) so I'm set for now.
---
Awesome, sounds good
---
So you just skipped over the part where I talked about US ISPs?
---
Get a load of this guy. Do you know the definition of pay-to-win?
---
This. Why the fuck is anyone supporting this shit
---
one solution:
---
no friends lol
---
It is even worse in poland-69,99 PLN for a month. At minimal wage you would need to work around 10-12 hours just for one month... Also  for same amount of cash you can have a fucking YEARLY  acces to sometjing like 100 games in origin.
---
I haven't played a single fall out game and have played only skyrim,which after I got through the shitty campaign got bored with pretty quickly. I'm only here because I enjoy watching a shitty company blow up.
---
Well, that gives me a reason to delete the game.
---
Because down with the coffee bourgeois pigs.
---
Not you too Unc 😩
---
I hate that fridge. It looks cool but it's just not as useful as I thought. I put ingredients in it but theyve still expired by the time I get back with the rest.
---
They kind of go hand in hand, though, don't they?
---
I like to think that The Outer Worlds is in the Fallout universe, just very far away from Earth (unless you can go to Earth in the game, idk)
---
whales are the people with deep pockets who spent hundreds, usually thousands on microtransactions.
---
and I'm assuming sheep is just the generic "gullible, easily manipulated" term.
---
I agree. It would be a decent price if the private servers were better and actually private servers. As far as I'm concerned it's just single player with co-op. I was hoping/under the impression we would have a personal server that was up 24/7
---
Look at the top rated posts on the main page. Then you can see how people really feel. But in the depths of new posts, the shills pretend they have control of the narrative with vote manipulation. Really pathetic. Just be aware of that. The shills are real and they get paid to post fluff trying to convince people that everything is fine. The main page is the only place where they are too impotent to do anything, except make their futile posts.
---
Thank god for Him.
---
A sheep is someone who blindfully follows other sheep. A whale is someone with a lot of money that doesn't care on what they spend it on.
---
Like this, where we talk about[Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com) a lot? Because Fallout First is the worst?
---
Oh ok makes a lot of sense with context.
---
the game would be way more fun with unlimites stash, they said it is not possible and now its possible but only when you pay monthly for a full prize titel. Unbelivable.
---
I came across a two player team running the munitions factory on Adventure and they had a ScrapBox near the control area, I'm guessing they found the Private experience boring so came back to Adventure and only after a few hours.
---
Why weren't they running the factory in Private and filling the ScrapBox, presuming you can put ammo in that new box thingy. They hadn't looted a single piece of loot from around the factory.
---
Ty ty!
---
The game is obviously a lost cause in their eyes. They just try to milk it before pulling the plug. Every sub is a win and they don't care about the game's reputation.
---
I am pretty sure a corporation knows how to make money better than us. So you can rest peacefully, they will get paid.
---
The griefing turds aren't exactly the ones to ask for anything tbh. Luckily not all the Pvp community is  like that.
---
Feel free to hmu on dm if you have questions and I'll happily answer. I've been doing pvp since before survival so I have a bit of experience
---
I agree. Give everyone unlimited scrap storage, BUT double camp space for 1st members if possible
---
It is still an online game where additional content is going to be added over time. Used to be you bought a game full price, paid a monthly subscription every month, and paid for an expansion when it dropped. Gamers over time decided they no longer wanted monthly fees or to pay for post launch content. The developers have to make up that loss of extra revenue somewhere. Skins in the vast majority of these games will not pay enough to keep the game going. 
---
Premium passes are basically the norm in online gaming. Paid games, free to play games, premium passes are extremely common. Nothing that Bethesda has added with Fallout First or in the atomic shop is even all that egregious.
---
Not saying anything about that, I'm saying they have different priorities than just what you want them to have. Theres probably a few things more important to them that they're working on than adding NPCs
---
Good, you deserve it for buying that shitty memebership.
---
For 99$/year I will say 'happy birthday!' to you right now, will allow you to purchase your own coffee to share with your friends, and will give you these 3 tickets a month to use to buy any one of these twelve items that  cost $1 or less, in the back of this windowless van of course!
---
**SCRAPBOX MUST BE FREE FOR EVERYONE.**
---
I enjoy meeting new players in game and help them out. My style is more like help to win
---
Nah
---
I guess you could stop playing?
---
HAAHAHAH i love the internet sometimes :D
---
Learn what free speech means. Pro tip: Mindless spam is not it
---
Thank you for listing this
---
I drew the line 7 months ago.  How about you?
---
Unreal is way fucking better than gamebryo, which by the way this shit heap is on gamebryo, creation engine isn’t real.
---
You probably could make FO76 in Minecraft.
---
Whales are someone who buys something your against. At least that's what its become
---
Lmao, you got any more jokes like that?
---
Is anyone really that shocked from the company that tried to monetize mods that they had no hand in making?
---
Naw, dawg, there shouldn't be no fuckin subscription service for a broken ass game.
---
I've read a ton of other topics on this. I'm pretty sure now its something to do with putting scrap into someone else scrap box. I bought the 1 month membership today and my friend has not but we both played perfectly fine all day long an even completed novice raid in private server and had no issues putting more scrap into it. Now all the other topics I've seen is from 2 people having the membership and vice versa using the other players scrap box.
---
No, i have seen instances where someone was bold and not stupid.
---
I have also seen stupid people who are not bold at all.
---
You don't know how to have any fun
---
If you put cooked food in it it seems to last a good amount of time. But it isn't the best way to preserve food, the backpack modification is the best way.
---
Let's get mad ?!?!?
---
It's cheaper to get ubi,Xbox or any other pass with dozens of games that are ten times better than f76 like wtf, this studio deserves to go bankrupt and idiots paying for subscription should be locked away and they money given to obsidian
---
definetly not. worst was fo76 itself:D
---
Sooo... you have extremely shitty internet then?
---
You bet my ass I’m butthurt. You should be too. They want us to pay them almost twice what the game costs PER YEAR, for access to some crappy skins and pay to win bullshit. At least I can play other games on my playstation subscription, and encounter virtually no hackers.
---
Going to the menu is when you take a break after a win, swap players on your team, etc.
---
Your a legend @Aussjex01 would be great man :) I appreciate it alot friend :)
---
Truth
---
Yes, like this : [Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Arrow changed to Daredevil.
---
Best way we can help is by posting it where ever you can over social media to get people to see it and click through to get the rankings up.
---
Fu.
---
With the season pass thing they pulled? Fair enough I don’t like that either, though I wouldn’t put them on par with Bethesda.
---
Your reply made me think of *We're The Millers*
---
"You guys are getting paid!?"
---
Lol yeah and another thing Bethesda if you bother reading these threads, I played for the first time in months a couple nights ago with my buddies. We felt like roaming and killing some scorched. Good fun until I crashed 10 min into the outing...100 dollars a year for a game fallout 3 runs better than. You're fucking idiots
---
You'd need to be able to have a second set of perk cards for that first.
---
You cannot put ammo in it.
---
The NCR Rangers, and Desert Rangers before them, just traditionally used looted Riot Gear as part of their uniform and paired it with a duster, jeans, and some nice boots, and this armor says C(harelston)PD on it to indicate that whoever is wearing it just had the same idea. Aside from it being seen as a uniform as of New Vegas it isn't really a canon uniform, just a cool mashup that took off.
---
I was laughing at the fact they want to remake the entire game on a different engine and just get it for free...
---
r/woosh
---
My minigun has Vampire and explosive rounds so if you see a level 340 kill you with a minigun im sorry i just needed health lol
---
No? Thought so.
---
Meh i have come across a few nice pvp players in the end game community. As the old saying goes. There is alwase 1 black sheep in every community out there causing more harm then good. So in the end the whole pvp community gets the blame. I blame indivigual people for choosing to be toxic in what would normaly be a decent community.
---
Yeah, it would be a shame if people actually had something positive to say, right?
---
Cheat prevention on PC?
---
I loved this game too. But after getting a bit bored I took 3 months off. Came back and it was even more broken. Won't be back.
---
Rubbish. The fridge has a lower spoilage rate than the backpack.
---
It's unlimited scrap, not unlimited stash. I shaved about 20# from my stash by moving my scrap over, that's it. People really could save themselves a coronary and settle down.
---
I can rest peacefully either way because it isn't my dollars they are getting paid with ;D
---
Nah, then they’d be perceived as weak. No company wants that. You won’t be able to face your shareholders.
---
We have this thread every year
---
The cost to travel is minuscule, even more so since vendors were added because it’s easy to make passive income. I have the fallout 1st subscription and I haven’t even bothered putting down the tent yet because it’s unnecessary.
---
Hardly. It's cost vs profit. They want to reduce the cost on their end to have the servers running (barely) at the expense of the consumer.
---
Could it be technically criticism/parody?
---
Stoped playing since launch I heard it was better so I have it another try this week.  Game still crashes for me every day, many same bugs since launch I get followed around by corpses or boxes which is funny, headless monsters that are not dead but just stay still I see it's on sale for 23 bucks right now my guess is 19.99 on black Friday if not cheaper
---
I can't give shit away to low levels. I drop a bag, shoot the bag, spam the emote, jump up and down on the bag and they just stand there without moving or run away.
---
Gave up, don't bother anymore.
---
Wow. How can something like that exist?
---
Yeah as is most of the atom shop items but they need it to generate money in order for it to get continued support.
---
Run whitesprings uninterrupted. The only positive I can think of.
---
So i guess you never heard of Fallout Xtreme then.
---
No it doesn't. The Fridge is 50%. The backpack mod is 90%. So... Rubbish to you.
---
No hate here, hope you get this sorted out. Best of luck.
---
Feels like a whole den of Fistos to me.
---
Pretty sure he’s safe as this is very clearly a parody.
---
Queuing...
---
Backpack mod is not 90%.
---
Even with the blowjob, it would still be overpriced.
---
Not for that, maybe.
---
Omg this site reminds me so badly of the Washington Redskins.....
---
Lol i got tge pa edituon for ps4 then the black yeti for pc last month. I wouldnt mine somthing like older maxins coat as fan service
---
I may be wrong, but is it like this? [Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Feel free to correct me.
---
Thanks much appreciated 🙏🏻👍🏻
---
So, how exactly did it disappear?
---
Wrong.
---
Anger is well known to lead to the dark side.

Go to Bethesdas website i think its handled deffrent

Smh a lvl 300 is just as strong as a lvl 50. When will you and others understand that.

Mothman dance in your Ranger outfit.

All the reviews say it pretty good. I'm excited.

Zax is fresh out of manhole covers. Tragically, you may have to remember where the holes in the ground are, just like everyone else. Or read the patch notes, which says that was fixed.
---
Nope! Got 4k Atoms from game and need nothing really.
---
funny how the only defense for this is just saying, "It doesn't cost more server stability to have infinite scrap."
---
And don't lump together the people who worked there at the time you were play testing with the company they are today. There's probably a ton of people within Bethesda, maybe those same people, that aren't thrilled about Fallout 1st. The service was likely thought up by some corporate asshat at Zenimax. Don't let one asshole's decision ruin all those great memories of being with the people working there or make you feel guilty for supporting their past games.
---
Nice.
---
Also r/FuckFO76 :P
---
I run a junkies /50 vats. Very good with the luck perks to boost that vats crit all the time. Just hold it down and fire. Got the weekly 10 in 2 or 3 vollys today. Before i even knew it was a challenge.
---
Na it wont really effect regular players to be honest. Most likely they want to boost atoms sales by giving you them monthly and servers are cool too
---
So you didn't access the scrapbox in another person's camp even? Seemed that was a common thing for others who have reported it.
---
Oh I know, this is really freaking me out though. I always thought the extreme haters on day one were shills for rockstar or something. (Red Dead Redemption came out around the same time). Clearly BGS learned a thing or two from them.
---
Yo remember when they gift 500 atoms after sending you a special edition bag made out of cheaper worse material? That fucking edition was like shit ton of money and not only they lied about whats inside of it , instead of refund Bethesda was like "here is your 500 atoms and shut up. yeah you cannot buy the same looking bag in the game with that amount of atoms but still"
---
funny thing is with the other storage items we got for this game (vending machines, showcases) i waited because i was afraid exactly that this might happen.
---
after these two i thought the system was safe.. damn was i wrong \^\^ but you know what? we are still 1st. lets dance in our castles!
---
i mean im still playing the game i may not agree with somethings and be mad about others but if ya dont have proof then it looks manufactured.
---
That's the nice side of capitalism. You get to do what you want with the money you earn.
---
You don't like a product? Don't buy it.
---
You want something? Buy it.
---
But the trend around here is: I can't afford / I don't want to pay for something? I am going to whine on Reddit about it.
---
Corporations are made to make money out of products they sell, since they own them and they do what they believe it is best for their business, disregarding whatever the average user believes "it is fair". Surely you can give your feedback, but don't expect stuff for free, because that's not how it works.
---
And for the record, since you cared to make it clear, they already got 15 euros from me just because I want and I can. It is as simple as that.
---
End of the story.
---
It’s simple business. 
---
They know that the more, shall we obsessively playing players will buy this and they will make money. 
---
Yes, they’ll lose some players but will still make their profit.
---
Crowd funding in which most of money goes to modder, after fees of service handling payments. Meanwhile Paid Mods implementation revenue share was 30% for Steam (standard share of Steam in transactions), but then came share for Bethesda, and they put it at 45%. Which left only 25% for modders. For every 10 bucks paid modder would see 2,5 bucks from it, while Bethesda would get 4,5 bucks.
---
Paying modders for work - Good. Paying money through system which leaves only quarter of money to actual creator of content - Bad.
---
That damn junk bot is so irritating and they litter the whole map.
---
Nope read the user agreements nothinh there to cover you for sueing.
---
Golly what a book
---
Got overseer last 2 matches. These noobs didn't play survival. Everything was against you. Now it's jist tom and his shitty aim.
---
Still only get like 830 or so xp. This is going to be a grind.
---
So you haven't played in 11 months &amp; you still come &amp; complain? 
---
You made your decision 11 months ago- if your not over it yet, I'm sorry, but you need to get out more.
---
 Don't just jump on the hate train making it seem worse than it is.
---
no i didnt. at least i didnt put anything in it. only read this from one other guy.
---
the only similar i read was someone scrapping some bulk before storing. thats what i did, too
---
ah damn, in my country we don't even have a mcrib... what a shame :(
---
Man thanks for the hype, your right im robot dancing all over the place!😄
---
Same guys saying we deserve it will end up buying it anyway but we were the 1st🍻
---
Yeah and it was canceled for good reason. Thank god it never saw the light of day. 🤷🏿‍♂️
---
Fu off and go do something useful instead of posting no nonsense and not being helpful.
---
So am I, it lowkey reminds me of fallout 3 and new vegas
---
s/
---
fixed your post
---
Well the player base sabotaged the public image of 76 and harassed all the new players out
---
Have fun blowing a 100 bucks on that. Me and mine will just go get trashed at a bar for that much, thank you very much. Or maybe go snorkeling or something. 
---
Or we’ll just buy two new polished games that aren’t broken.
---
Me too &amp; plenty of others 😌
---
Ouch. Gonna be careful with it then until further.
---
Do you really think that a multi-billion dollar corporation such as BGS / Zenimax is desperate for money? Do you really think that everytime someone purchases Atoms there's a bell going off at their office, followed by a universal sigh of relief and employees calling their wifes: "Honey, don't worry - we'll be able to afford some food for tonight!! Someone bought Atoms - yes... Blessed be their kind souls!! And tell the kids I won't have to work in the coal mines for at least another week..."
---
Seriously... from tax benefits/deduction alone they could probably pay for the servers (including maintenance) ten times over and they still wouldn't "lose" a single cent in the process... when they decided to develop and release 76 as a service game, they didn't take a bold leap of faith, it was all calculated risk. And had the game totally crashed and burned they still would have come out of this financially unscathed... otherwise they wouldn't have done it.
---
Fallout 1st is not a frantic call for help to pay the bills - it's a shameless cash grab to maximize profit, plain and simple.
---
I knew I smelled something fishy when they had that massive sale. 40 of them for 1000 atoms or something like that. Hmmmmm
---
I don't think bethesda tested out the scrap box on what would happen if other players used it. Right now its inaccessible without the membership but I think the scrap just disappears if you put it in any other scrap box than your own. So all that scrap does get added into your current stock pile but cause the items don't have unique id numbers it gets clumped together and once the owner of said scrap logs out, the scrap disappears cause it wasn't linked to that character or something cause it was put into the wrong scrap box and the other person doesn't see that scrap that was put in, so it just disappears. I could be wrong but I'm just making assumptions on whats going on with what I'm reading.
---
This made my day much much better. Thank you lone ranger for taking up a fight for us.
---
its not just OW man blizzcon is just around the corner and talks of D2Remake and even D4 are common at this point. C2077, CODMW, Dying Light 2, FF7 remake all these games directly compete with some aspect of f76.
---
Someone bought it before reading reddit didn’t they?
---
Just watch the blow back about this is going to end up like the collector's edition bag. 😂
---
"...multiplayer with other random survivors." You're telling me I spent 25 years in a vault and walked out with a bunch of strangers I never got to know? Try again.
---
How is it detrimental to gameplay? It is the same exact thing as the craft bag in ESO. You managed somehow to make it a year without it and now it is added you are at some kind of disadvantage. Also of course private servers were going to cost money, you just thought they were going to give you a free server?
---
Hmm I went by the instructions given to me when I purchased it. But will check Bethesda website.
---
Just start a new build cuase persiption and agility will need to be max and a bit of luck
---
perhaps. but a more inventive player would argue that within a week you could have virtually unlimited ammo and all the junk you could ever use in your life, literally hundreds of thousands of units. essentially doing away with the micromanagement aspect of the game.
---
Outside of the price on the goods and way they are given isn't it good they are taking player ideas and making them reality?  
---
I mean, the backpacks were just part of an update and they were player requested.
---
You realize it’s made by the people who made Fallout New Vegas right? Fallout New Vegas, which most consider to be the best fallout game. Plus idk if you know this, but obsidian has many of the original team members that worked on the original fallout games. The Outer Worlds is essentially Fallout in space. Lastly if you think 30-40 hours is to short for a game, then you need to really go outside and do something.
---
Still never tried mine from that $10 atom/machete skin bundle..ya i love this tent just needs crafting table &amp; ill be set😍
---
Those big blue boxes seem to be in every camp I visit, so some people are buying the sub.
---
atm 15 strength 4 perc 3 end 4 char 5 int 11 agil 14 luck i have 12 level ups waiting to be used
---
That’s the kind of attitude that gave rise to tyrants throughout history. “Oh, he wants to kill the Jews? I’m not Jewish so I don’t care.”
---
Yeah that’s what squads are for. You shouldn’t have to pay $100 a year to play with 7 other people in a completely empty server when the majority of servers are relatively empty anyway. Stop trying to justify this shitty decision.
---
Press S to spit
---
S
---
Private server take up space if everyone had private servers for free that costs them money. Other services charge for private servers just like this. Minecraft, battlefield, Conan exiles, ark. You name it anyone that has private servers charges because it costs them money to maintain. Your basically covering the costs to maintain in them.
---
I would count Bioware as part of EA.
---
Nah just don't make a game that's so bad that mass incompetence is a believable excuse
---
Kinda most pissed about not being able to put greenhouses in workshops. I use them to test builds and make blueprints using free resources. They one of the trickiest but coolest elements. It helps the see that some build is possible before wrecking your old base
---
&gt;I wouldn't even necessarily mind if they wanted private servers to be behind a subscription
---
and why is that ? (free) private/dedicated servers have been ingrained into PC gaming since the 90s
---
why are people so casual about companies just taking features, that were free, and monetizing them?
---
I can arrange that.
---
They just deleted their comment as soon as you called them a shill. You fucking called it, my person.
---
Yes well, as I said, in that case it IS a good deal for ya'll :p   
---
In every other case its too expensive for what it is.
---
Than do so
---
Maybe they already know ES6 is going to be really bad so they're tanking now so that when it comes people will be like at least it's not as bad as Fallout 76 was
---
Can you re-link the video? It says it's a video post...
---
Okay okay, the best I can do is "create inconvenience then pay for solution to such inconvenience". Deal?
---
Perhaps then the real complaint is the way in which content is delivered not specifically that it was from the community.
---
BOYCOTT!
---
Even if Wastelanders itself isn't locked behind a paywall, you can bet your ass they're at least pulling parts of it out to put behind a paywall.
---
Not bad just sitch strength to persetion and get riflemen. Im more of a heavy minigun player myself
---
Tricky even with that? incredible
---
Sadly at this point, not a surprise
---
I mean what I say, I truly love this game. I didn’t join from the beginning because of the bad reviews but now when I jumped in I just don’t why people still criticize it as much. Its a great game. At least to me it is.
---
I agree. This is a primarily pve game. The atom shop items (and fallout first perks) give maybe slight pve advantages, but it's definitely not pay to win.
---
The game was almost done. It was cancelled because Black Isle went bankrupt, not because of noble reason on the developers' part, as you revisionists like to claim. Moreover, Fallout: BoS 2 was also in development, and Xtreme was also being actively developed as the new franchise, with a sequel already planned. The original devs very much wanted to make a tactical shooter out of Fallout.
---
So hyped for Outer Worlds tomorrow!!
---
Ill need to keep like 7-8 strength for weight reasons is that ok.
---
Do the protectron dance.
---
yes sir! :D id have paid for the dance alone lol!
---
the "you deserve it" posts really showed some hidden faces in this community. kinda sad tbh.
---
the first "i lost all my scrap" had so many of these comments, the op answered my question via dm and not inside the post.
---
preach
---
I’m sorry to hear that :(
---
What better way to celebrate October 23rd; the day the Fallout world was nuked, than Bethesda nuking the Fallout 76 game itself?
---
You must be looking at all the new posts. The shill-age is beyond mind boggling.
---
Then*
---
My money is on the eso dlc approach. You can buy dlc one by one or you can get subscription and dlc is free as long as your a member
---
Well its the day the nukes fell.. on the community
---
*Waiting*
---
Yeah fair enough. I suppose I’m talking about people who just attack you out of nowhere.  But the way I’ve perceived that thus far is “I wanna do PVP, you wanna PVP?”. The minute I attack back and kill someone a single time, it’s 3v1 against me cause the person’s whole squad is there.
---
Nailed it.
---
Bethesderp is cancelled.
---
I didn’t know about that sale. That’s kinda shitty of them honestly. Like, the things are so useless to begin with. There are stash boxes and tables all over the map anyway. They should’ve just patched them out if they where adding the camp sites
---
If a horse is dying on the farm we put a gun to its head out of mercy, this is what I’ll be doing to my copy of fo76.
---
how dare you talking like this to a 1st?!
---
Nice going beth, killed your game before you even brought out wastelands.
---
You conveniently leave out the stash, which directly affects gameplay and PvP in terms of being able to store stuff and sprint.
---
Greafers are roage there not liked by the pvp community. As it gives the real pvp community a bad name and black eye.
---
holy shit what did Bethesda gave you to write this? A life-time supply of lightwood laminate?
---
Yea the original reddit post was just removed. It was on r/fallout
---
Well not only they changed that. But you are talking about a dropped item, which items can't be dropped anymore, they are always stored into a container(the brown junk bag).
---
But stuff in stash is of course very different. It's item type and item amount.
---
Yeah man i its just fugure out if you want to have all riflemen mods active at once or switch out mods. 9 levels to have all three mods equiped and 3 more levels for the vats mod that lets you target body parts
---
People who realized with obvlion that launching for console is how you make money.
---
thank you for this comment. its one of a lot that shows us this community isnt "the very best of the best and so friendly and i spent all my stimpacks to a lowlevel - i had a blast ... and so on and so on". this truely shows this.
---
writing someone deserved something bad for no reason is a behaviour only known from children. if you are older than 12 years old you maybe want to think about that.
---
If that ever comes out. Spoiler warning:it won’t ever and this is their way of getting as much money as possible before shutting the servers
---
Great post. One question... with the ‘go outside, bang wife etc etc...’ do you recommend we do it in that order? Thanks for your time.
---
Shucks oh well
---
That’s like saying you should have to pay to have a private Minecraft world after buying the game. My computer can run 76’s world by itself, I don’t need dedicated servers (as if Bethesda would actually use those) for a private world.
---
So you're judging a game that you haven't even played.
---
GoodfellasLaughing.gif
---
Dumb prick. Really mate sitting behind your screen saying that.
---
Lmao that’s perfect
---
Bethesda has been pretty good to me lol so no
---
same here. already made my own post. ticket is running the same time.
---
For this moment I will game hell out of new Obisidian game, and check out 4k game play with rdr2, but i will check eso thanks
---
Imagine that update ever comes out. It isn’t. Stop being delusional
---
What? Wrong comment?
---
They said it’ll be for free though
---
the whole point is to scam people dummy
---
Do companies not understand that us plebs have access to google?
---
Quit gatekeeping other people. Bethesda has been pretty shady, yes, but people enjoy the game. So let them
---
That's what I was assuming thx
---
Don’t let schemes like this trend. Donate the money to a better cause and not on absolute shit
---
I'm truly blown away when I saw the announcement. "Bold move Cotton" as the saying goes
---
This is their business model!! It wasn’t broken at launch it was nearly playable to ensure you later pay the monthly stipend that makes it more playable. 
---
This is ESO repeated. 
---
They had some legal issue with ESO at launch where you bought the game &amp; then they required a subscription to play. Courts involved I believe. So they gave you a lesser experience without the subscription.  A new model was born, Mr investor was so happy he twanged his braces and kissed his 4th wife. 
---
Server space is the con. They think you are too dumb to realise that to have 1 x T51 power armour takes the same server space as 9999x T51 power armour. This shit is not physical. Server space is used up by item type and not item quantity (that would be the real world). 
---
I was conned day 1 to buy the £86 version. I’ve not played it for 10 months. I spent a week venting on here about this. I called the “monthly subscription fix” on here 336 days ago. Was shouted down, people thought I was kicking their new Fallout puppy.  
---
I should have spent £86 at the strip club &amp; twanged Mr investors 2nd Wife. 
---
Bethesda no longer makes games for gamers they now make products for investors.
---
Yeah, I guess I don’t mean to attack the PVP community.  I know pretty much nothing about how PvP fights are set up or any unspoken rules or anything of that nature.  I guess I just assumed that in adventure mode, anyone who attacks you just wants to do PVP and go back and forth a few times.  Guess I was wrong about that haha
---
Sigh. I just wanted my P94 Plasma Caster and Floaters.
---
Pretty sure that would be exactly the case I'm talking about, after all adding a game from major publisher to *thumbstick covers* is quite specific move that would be noticed.
---
So I do it like this [here](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
I’m so sick of Bethesda screwing up. Used to love them... still do... but this is more like a wake up all for them.
---
well some already have, and have been punnished for it by losing all their scrap.
---
Its r/assholedesign
---
Uh we on Reddit dummy boy, how else am I gonna communicate it to you? Want me to face time you next time? Maybe send me your P.O. Box and I’ll write a letter?
---
FO76 has done significantly worse than Anthem for a long time...
---
It's already beyond embarrassing. I can only laugh at this now.
---
Way too late. Half the people in NW are doing the robot! Not going to lie... Im a little jealous.
---
Eso dont bother its a great game but noone really plays basegame
---
Hey Jon i remember your post about the vault when it started! I lost Strangler heart power armor that never came back to inventory &amp; now the vault steel lol. Hope your junk is safe, have you had a chance tp check? Its gonna be a mission to roll the clock back for how many of us have lost junk now &amp; probably more tonight 😌
---
First class idiot, that's what.
---
This post was completely ruined with those edits.
---
How about worse, it's MTX DLC just like the shitty rage 2 dlc.
---
Exactly, keyword Tactical. They should’ve known to stay away from multiplayer after how poorly Tactics did. They should’ve stuck to working on Van Buren, continuing the story instead of trying to follow the new multiplayer trend. One can only speculate what the future would’ve been like had they never gone bankrupt but I’m happy we got New Vegas in the state it’s in. I’m not saying Interplay was perfect, in fact they made a lot of mistakes after Fallout 2. But Van Buren would’ve gone over a lot better than how 3 ended up. We could’ve had real first person Fallouts developed by Interplay themselves. New Vegas is the closest we’ll ever come to that, and somehow that’s enough. We can only hope that the Outer Worlds will be the spiritual successor this franchise has needed for years.
---
Perception agility &amp; luck is where you want to possibly move points to depending on what gun you are going to use.
---
E.g.. Bloodied ffr vats crit handmade
---
All the commando points maxed in perception plus concentrated fire
---
Sneaking really helps as well, so sneak perks or as I run a Bloodied build, they can't see you as your agility is so high, until you fire a shot
---
 1 point in gunfu (best vats related card in game)
---
If you also want to rely on crits, then the crit perks in luck, not in game so don't remember the names. With the above weapon &amp; doing headshots, pretty much guaranteed a crit every time you pull the trigger, it's pretty awesome &amp; why I generally don't use bloody mess as its not required except I may swap it in for the queen.
---
Another option is an explosive lever(my favourite weapon) all the rifleman &amp; concentrated  fire perks in perception.
---
luck perks aren't as critical so you can leave more points in strength &amp; also use a heavy gun or shot gun from time to time or I put more into agility &amp; max out gunfu
---
Bethesda Austin didn't make this on their own, they worked with the other two BGS studios. It was only after release that development and maintenance was handed entirely to them while Todd and his team moved on to Starfield and TES VI. Individual developers may be blamed for the poor execution of certain parts of the game however the monetization schemes are controlled by the Zenimax overlords.
---
I was planning on buying the medium atom pack when wastelanders came out. Now they’re not getting another cent out me, greedy Tenpenny’s!
---
Downhill is an understatement, it's falling from a cliff.
---
To keep it simple for the guy who didn't follow Fallout 76: We just got the "big content update" anounced on 2019 E3 delayed until next year, after a long content drought, and instead we get this nice Fallout Fist subscription up our asses (and the last "raid" content we got barely works). Also before this they just added non cosmetic stuff on the microtransaction store that should have been in the game according to official guide.
---
They couldn't just wait until the Halloween event had ended, they needed money now. Instead of Wastelanders update we get this pay to win shit.
---
Corporations  focus purely on profits, Bethesda and EA are on the same page, lets wait till they add to Fallout 77 1st a monthly legendary scrip coverage to catch on loot boxes practices.
---
They done work already. My guess is they'd make it exclusive to the subscribers
---
first class better than second class. :)
---
Ouch this is going on sadcringe
---
yeah, it's far worse, this shits been going on for half a year.
---
And corporation have made mistakes too. Capitalism goes both ways. Companies have gone under due to bad business practices. Capitalism does not make corporations immune financial ruin. BTW I'm not whining I'm just stating opinions like you. I don't think the issue is whether or not people can afford it rather poor timing and bad pricing and a total reversal of what was promised at launch. But that being said I hope you enjoy your purchase. I'm sure the folks over at Bethesda are happy someone is paying for it. On that note I will go and rest easy now like previously stated have a good night.
---
But this is too much, I agree with OP
---
Im considering uninstalling, I cannot play anyways with my weight; the only thing I can do is get more weapons and I did until full stash so yeah
---
Oh wait I can pursue the possum badgets which I discover are fuking shit rewards or collect teddy bears no thx
---
I’m becoming more and more worried of their P4A (pay for advantage) shenanigans
---
I think Nuclear Winter has a bug at the moment. I've encountered it twice now. Upon becoming the last person standing, player count UI displays and counts a 2nd person, despite there being none. Therefore disallowing the match to end and the win to be gained. I was only able to end the match by having the circle fully disappear and the storm eventually killing me.
---
You tried giving Bugthesda more money?
---
I used the fallout ip to destroy the fallout ip
---
The Plan; Laser Gun is not sold at any vendor. What they are thinking of is Ultracite laser gun which is sold in Watoga. The plan you want can drop from patrol duty or can be picked up at the Charleston herald building top floor or in a wall safe in the third safe room during back on the beat. These spawn very rarely so good luck!
---
Hero shit.
---
I hope I get my own fusion core producer so I do not have to take over power plants anymore
---
Yup, this is what I went with. Instigating Explsoive lever action.  Absolutely the best gun for my build.  Thanks.
---
I see it as a thank you fir supporting us heres some exclusives type deal
---
A. Fallout was not forgotten among the throng of 90s isometric RPGs because of Bethesda. No denying that.
---
B. Another circlejerk about Outer Worlds: the game is not open world. It is a linear RPG, and the RPG elements are basically based on overusage of skills and skill trees. The game hardly lets you return to a place to see what happened there, and the game ends like New Vegas did, so all your choices are merely a slideshow at the end of the day. But they did create a good Borderlands like experience.
---
Pretty sure sales have been pretty high- my whole friend list is full of people on private servers
---
Wastelander isn't going to be a gamechanger. You already saw the whole content in this weird trailer. If you think those generic Preston Garvey NPCS are going to change the complete gameplay, then oh god pls have mercy with this poor soul. xD
---
That’s true, I hope that it won’t cost any cents.
---
By exclusive sales, that sounds to me like they will get maybe 50% off of some items in the store, that is exclusive for subscribers, and not exclusive sales, as in items only in the store for them, but who knows.
---
What platform are people loosing their junk?
---
I hope thats true and they learn a lesson
---
why should i be butthurt? everyone played fo76 without unlimited scrap box and ranger outfit until today... oh my gud how we could play without thosands of bone and glass shards?
---
but cause i dont need some shitty pay consoletaxes mayby i will get that junkbox and i let you borrow it so you can deposit your ps4  to place where it really belongs:D
---
and yeah, my obtical fibre really suks... buy mayby some day i can get real 10gbs connection:D
---
People like you really are stupid enough to think businesses actively try to ruin their products huh? 
---
I can tell you what the thought process was
---
“Players want singleplayer but we’d have to completely rework everything and that would completely destroy the game. I know let’s make singleplayer servers that friends can join! But wait it costs money to run a server, and making a brand new server for every person would run us into the ground. Let’s charge them a premium that’ll be enough to keep it up. Maybe throw in a couple exclusives. That’ll keep them happy”
---
I guarantee there wasn’t malicious intent behind it (mostly) but the asking price is too much for what you’re getting. I think they should’ve gone the ARK route of being able to host your own game, although that would require a tether distance, and offering the ability to buy a server that you can change a few settings on, set a password and keep up constantly as well as giving the items they said, with the ability to earn the items in game separately if it’s wanted
---
Wholesome
---
r/hailcorporate
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Besides, Gamebryo is crap and i'm sick of it. I'm pretty sure a lot of people think so.
---
a lot of people think so, until tes 6 releases and they realise the new engine wont have half the modding capabilities, if it will have any at all
---
Nah, I'm okay. Enjoying the game. My self-respect is fine too -- maybe because it's not tied into promotional offers for video games.
---
Bethesda is dead to me
---
Yeah, he should fix it a bit to use less obviously copyrighted stuff. Maybe change it enough for it to count as satire of it. There may be a chance it could end up with an order for him to forfeit the domain possibly or something.
---
Did you? 
---
What could make them mad, all they basically said was Bethesda only cares about money, but on the other hand there's no way you're the one salty over someone criticizing your favorite big corporate game Devs.
---
its on all platforms happening as i can see.
---
stick around this sub a little bit more feller and you can observe those two magnificent species in their natural habitat!
---
yeah, this is why if I buy anything bethesda...hell anything by it's subsidiary's I will first wait a few months to see what they pull.  But not even thats safe with rage 2's mtx dlc.
---
Will at the moment after spilling coffee on my off white flinal for laughing at your response... Yeah like my life lol
---
Yeah too late, half of the comments are defending this beautiful feature. I dont know if rich kids or people with a lot money, probably the same that gave money to twitch cam girls
---
How do you request the refund?
---
I'm still not following. I keep seeing people say that Bethesda lied. I've not seen any actual deceitful or blatant lies. I've seen things change, or not work out. But I understood exactly what Bethesda said each time they announced something new. Idk maybe I just interpret what they mean differently? Or since my life for over a decade has revolved around video games, I just know what to expect? I was never shocked, surprised or angry with them when it comes to 76.
---
with the subscription announcement, I assumed the game would go 100% free to play
---
🤔
---
uu what a comeback
---
I wouldnt call this an AAA game, it's like a heavily modded Fallout 4, not even a good one
---
Just don't buy it. Judging a online cash grab by feedback of the people who actually believed the game is good, is a good first way to see if a game is worth your time. Wait for the new Elder Scrolls and buy that, cuz thats made by the actual real dev team.
---
Fallout 4 did way better commercially but I think in terms of the community of fallout fans New Vegas is definitely the fan favorite for a lot of reasons, so just because it sold twice the copies doesn't mean every owner of that copy became a fan of the game or series, there is plenty of people who will play a game like fallout for a little while and never finish or come back to it and with the amount of mainstream marketing and sales it got that number is probably pretty high for FO4. 
---
Critically it was received lower because it was rushed out and shipped with a lot of game breaking bugs that have since been fixed and it wasn't as surprising a return as FO3 was.  If New Vegas and Fallout 3 were both fairly rereviewed today I think NV would definitely be the critical favorite.
---
I hope you quit and manage to find new game worth your time and money.
---
Haha if you had the money for paying this beautiful 1* class fallout scam you have a good life and Im happy for you
---
But omg Bethesta why you fuk our asses like that
---
wow this [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) was really good post [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) and entertaining to be honest! I want to let you know about this site (https:/falloutfirst.com) [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) just mention [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) in this thread so we can make this [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) the first result when someone searches [Fallout 1st](https:/falloutfirst.com) 😁👍💖😎👏👀😍
---
It won't effect you in any meaningful way.
---
Do you get paid per comment, or is it a full time job thing?
---
eso doesnt lack content if you pay for the sub. otherwise, none of the content drops are free.
---
Are you assuming I don’t know that it’s not open world? The story looks pretty great from what I’ve seen, and I have faith in Obsidian. Spiritual Successor doesn’t mean it has to mirror the game in every way. And I’m not sure how you know what the ending is, as the game isn’t out for another day, but I guess we’ll see? I’ll reply again once I’ve finished the game.
---
Yeah, every player gets his/her own private server and doesn't need to worry about any kind of social contact with others.
---
I'm sorry for you.
---
How much do you think your parents pay for your internet, per month?
---
whale is too good a term for those that are fucking up gaming with their stupidity.
---
Just let it go. What bethesda is doing is considered as disrespectful.. Don't show them you care. What's more don't buy this sad joke called subscription.
---
Okay
---
World of warcraft has thousands of people playing simultaneously in the same server.  And every expansion added a whole new game worth of content, with a huge map to explore. 
---
A game truly needs to be massive for a monthly fee to be justified. Wow was massive enough to justify it, fallout 76 isn't. Not even close.
---
Your self respect among other things is tied to how you let other people and companies treat you.
---
Maybe but hold on 
---
&gt; These days
---
FF14, WoW, KotR, Tera
---
Those are all decently old MMOs, sure not much else that grand has come out but still, they're clearly still using the old model of maximum profits from video games.
---
They've done plenty of interviews where they've said that the game ends with slides like NV did. I see no reason for them to have lied about that.
---

3 words: EPIC GAMES STORE.
---
Meh, it is absolutely a terrible thing, and I can only imagine this was a top-down decision made by accountants, but it's completely optional and won't affect those that can see it for the horrible deal it is and not sign up for it. I mean, seriously, who do they think wanted this implementation of private servers? Anyway, I'll just continue playing as I have been and ignore it. 
---
It's apparently great for karma farming though.
---
I was actually gonna buy this as a gift for a friend of mines birthday, lol good thing they did this a week before hand, ill save the cash and buy her Outer Worlds instead.
---
You will buy the Skyrim
---
Once for the greenhouse pack because I had Microsoft rewards points saved up and I thought the back was super cool. No regrets.
---
Asking for a feature does not equate to give it to me for free it was never promised at the beginning. You are essentially getting the equivalent to £15 worth of atoms every month and server hosting for £0.34 if you do the yearly plan. Hosting micro servers isn't free you have to pay for the electricity internet, fees maintenance etc. They are doing this at a potential loss considering only 1 person out of 8 have to do this.
---
frankly if you bought the game it wont directly effect you. But it will effect you in subtle ways for example they could or will spend more time fixing bugs or issues on the subscription  worlds why? because that is what is earning them (Bethesda) money. A possible outcome to which i have no evidence for is because mods are allowed on these private worlds soon a mod could be made that allows someone to make a 3 star weapon with perfect modifiers then go onto the normal world and then sell it, and repeat the process which would cause a whole lot of fallout, higher player prices for example the devaluing of other core loops in the base game. Frankly the subscription is poorly implement and it cuts out a piece of the game to which the user was promised at/near launch would be a feature so to put it behind a paid wall is not the right way
---
[Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) really speaks to me
---
They didn't need to include "small extras" like unlimited junk, free fast travel, mobile forwards bases, and then allow people to use all these things on public servers. 
---
If the subscription fee included only private servers - and none of these extra things - there would be far less outcry IMO. Personally I would have been 100% ok with that, I was ready to pay $10/month anyways so $100/year was right in line with what I was expecting. 
---
Including huge gameplay/quality of life features in order to entice people to fork over money for their "premium" subscription model is much more insidious. It's very telling that during the last Inside the Vault they were - as usual - happy to share all of the other improvements they're making to the game, and were also excited to announce private servers were coming this week...and yet for some reason, they chose not mention any of theses "bonus features" [value added!] that were to be included with private servers. Did they want it to be a surprise? It sure was! A really shitty surprise! 
---
This makes it very clear that from now on, every new gameplay feature and improvement will have an additional layer of decision making: is this something we will give to everyone, or only our "premium" members? What other benefits should subscribers get? Daily log-in bonuses? Free respecs? Ammo recycling? Permanent purveyor discounts? Why not? They've already flown out the gate with unlimited junk and free fast travel, and they've made it abundantly clear they are not shy about escalating these sorts of things. Remember when repair kits came out? Now look what's for sale. Think it won't get worse? 
---
You may be okay with all of this, but a lot of us aren't, and it's for damn good reason.
---
You dare challenege the ideas of the great Godd Howard?
---
To be honest with you its 1am and i got nothing better to do then browse reddit while random players run around my private sever
---
Sadly many have already bought into it. You're shouting into the void here. Those of us smart enough to take our money away and leave are already doing so though. Hopefully there will be enough of us to hurt their bottom line.
---
The junk stash has very little effect so far tbh. I've always kept my stash around 700 for wiggle room and I don't carry junk on me. (Fwiw I'm not a fallout first member.) The junk stash is neat, but again this is not a primarily PvP game. And being able to hold more steel isn't that significant of a advantage. I think the survivor camp is the more unnecessary advantage item tbh, but even then, all it does is save you some caps.
---
I just don't see the big deal?
---
Oh, my mistake. I thought you meant the game ends like new Vegas did story wise. Yes I know it’s going to end in that style and I’ll admit to liking that style. That’s how Fallout’s endings have been since 1 and I’m not angry about it at all.
---
I hope you stupid free to play players understand the only reason you get any content or events what so ever is thanks in part to every (whale) in the community your bashing on.
---
I dont know how you can "let it go" any more than saying please just shut down the game and move onto better things...
---
What they traditionally mean is 
---
Whale- person with money to burn and doesn’t care what they buy
---
Sheep-person who blindly follows/accepts what they’re given/told
---
The way people in the fallout fandom use it is “you do/don’t have a completely polarized opinion that agrees with me even though I’m just following the bandwagon? SHEEP! WHALE! REEEEE”
---
For example, earlier I said that while I don’t agree with the asking price for what we’re getting, it makes sense to charge for servers because it costs money to run one, and they can’t create and maintain a brand new server for every single player FOR FREE  and stay in business. It’s just not practical. The responses? I got downvoted to hell and called a sheep for daring to suggest that there’s a legitimate, non malicious reason behind some decisions (keyword some)
---
But the fallout fandom is a bunch of bandwagoning neckbeards that can’t form their own opinion, so you’re gonna see the terms used incorrectly quite a bit because people disagreed with each other
---
I've paid for the game I enjoy the game I will play the game. If you want to waste the money you have already spent on it then who is the moron here?
---
Yeah well, I am a positive person and still have hope for wastelanders, lets see
---
100€? I prefer to throw that money into Star citizen haha
---
Lol the NCR stuff is already free on nexus mods
---
Don't forget you can use your private world to farm unlimited resources from workshops without ever being contested, then bring them to public servers.
---
as a 1st class i dont need any comeback. im already there. always a step forward.
---
Lets make a stand. hard no
---
Don't fool yourself it'll be a low percentage, sure. But it'll be enough for Bethesda to keep it up . Guaranteed.
---
yeah, I'm not talking about the servers, that I get, I'm talking about portable repair kits, refrigerators, unlimited storage and other shit people been asking for, and they took that to mean, "Sell me it."
---
People were getting servers alone and doing it anyways. And the munitions factory sucks. It's not even worth taking in a private game.
---
the hero we love but don't deserve
---
If you played sincr launch what are you doing?
---
It even has better lightwood laminate.
---
Go on, little antifa-ling.. your whining is delicious 😎
---
A subscription model for a video game has zero impact on my life. I'd be genuinely concerned if my self-respect was in any way tied into that. I'm honestly not that fragile.
---
HAHAHAHAHA GOLD!
---
Your sense of worth is entirely tied to promotional material that has no affect on you whatsoever. You’re that person that has a completely polarized opinion on everything, because it’s the popular opinion to have, and because you can’t form your own opinion or personality, if someone criticizes something you like in anyway you take it as a personal attack
---
At start there must been a lot players.I  guess, they can afford this now, as there are no players left :) Milk the last bit!
---
Good move
---
Moron here, I got the game half off and game share it with my gf, and have only earned atoms through gameplay. I do have the fridge, and its useless. Sorry I'm so bad and ruining your experience somehow
---
i take my statement back, this bullshit is pay2win
---
Probably something like this. T
---
1. Need to make money but no one wants to pay for content.
---
2. Try selling cosmetic items only.
---
3. Cosmetic items aren't really selling as most people really don't give a shit about skins or cosmetics, or they buy whatever skins they do want with atoms made by just playing the game
---
4. Let's try some convenience items and see how they sell.
---
5. Convenience items sell much better than cosmetics.
---
6. Offers more convenience items as a part of a premium pass.
---
If you do that then they will be forced to find more money making schemes.
---
I say we can blame every dumb fuck that buys into it for the mess that elderscrolls 6 and star field will become.
---
That does makes sense.
---
It actually amazes me that we still have the "Rockstar" Games, I mean you buy GTA5 or RDR2 and you get the whole multiplayer which basically is the same game but with MMO mechanics. While F76 also could just have been Fallout 4 Online Version, but Bethesda decided to not even try to make a cool and fair game.
---
Meanwhile CoD MW also has P2W, but it's also locked behind lootboxes
---
FIXED IT! - Whoever joins a Fallout 76 forum and continues to post in that forum about how bad this game is and trashes the people who like it are morons and a disgrace to the gaming community. 
---
Uninstall then leave groups of games and communities you don’t like... it’s literally easier...lol
---
You are right, seeing where we are is gonna be probably good utility items like the fridge and the robot; I wanna puke on them
---
Im not even surprised at this point
---
Your personal experience means nothing. Most people hoard a ton of junk for repairs and crafting. Being able to sprint and do power attacks, and not get reduced to a crawl by simply running around plays a massive part in being able to PvP. And the game has PvP, it has workshops that are PvP-centric, it is a PvP game whether you PvP or not.
---
EPIC GAMES STORE! Dont buy it!
---
It wont even be open world!
---
Stop advertising it as the holy grail!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8q69vh/fo76_subscription/
---
Its quite not the same thing but funny to me, year ago people said nah, wont be. Look at us now.
---
It was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. As a admirer of the fallout series, with great patience—I have watched this game, and the developers of it,  gutter every opportunity to provide substantial content.
---
Besthda had something great. 
---
The temperance of a loyal community.
---
Feedback from that loyal community.
---
But Besthda has continually shit in our mouths, wanting us to pay $25 for it.
---
You don't have to pay for a sub.
---
A beta is what we used to call a demo back in the days.
---
Even funnier is the fact they make you pay in order to play the ~~demo~~ beta.
---
I’m really dumb, does this work for the PC game pass?
---
because there is no one playing this,  the few can have unlimited space now :P makes sense, milk them  Todd and Pete!!! HARD!
---
I hate when that shit happens, reminds me of when was it black ops 4 went on sale then shortly after that they some of the shittiest loot boxes.
---
Puf I hope you are getting paid by Bethesta
---
May each of them fail spectacularly. And may Bethesda rot.
---
Fake news Get a life and stop blameing others. And stop beleaving everything you see on youtube. When they have all been prooven to be click bait.
---
No I still gotta get that vampire outfit, only got a couple more challenges to do
---
Guess what, in GTA:Online I can have a full server with only my friends or Gang members. And you know also what, GTA:Online was a free extension to their base game.
---
Like a third of this post is a thank you for fake internet medals. Come on OP no one gives a shit
---
Point made here.
---
Unlike people who continue to trash the game and others who like it all while staying in a Forum literally for the game called Fallout 76...haha!
---
&gt;Fallout 1st
---
Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
It could be done but in different ways. FO76's marketing and sales team beyond stupid .... Vault pass system that allowed players to complete challenges to earn loot would have gotten more takers and increased in game activity too. A sub option after a huge maker over like how it happened in ESO would have been more digestible. Instead they cut corners and does this.
---
I think it's a bit more like this [Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Just because a company is worse doesn't mean the less egregious ones should be left off.
---
It's decent if you just want to play the quests and main story. It's just not a game where you can spend (happily) a lot of time after you have completed everything because then you'll start following the development process. That's the part that makes people angry really. The game is ok.
---
To me I’m good with certain microtransactions, but there’s almost no value with what Bethesda offers. $20 for an armor skin? $100 for basically ( not ) private servers? If they kept it in the realm of decency I’m good with it.
---
I play it only to enjoy a game, not to give hundreds of dollars to a company that does nothing to stay relevant. I didn't even donated anything to the game. Not donating to get in-game currency makes this game more interesting. I find exploring and finding difficulties make this game more immersive and, well, difficult.
---
What do you mean lies with the exception of the Atom store debacle they have never lied about private servers they never said that it wouldn't be paid for its a rented server system and its not even that unreasonable. You try running a website let alone hosting a video game for less and peer 2 peer doesn't count as its not run on a separate device. It was never a 100% guaranteed feature either.
---
I definetly think it's zenimax, not sure how responssible they are for other games, but rage 2 and it's shitty MTX dlc,I'm sureprised more people arn't pissed off at this point, the problems with wolfenstein and other games.
---
You are literally the reason the monetization problem will continue. 
---
You seem aware that is was a bad deal, but spent the money anyway.
---
I gotta admit, I really enjoyed the tears and memes that came out of this fiasco.
---
Please uninstall the game and leave the group...  win win situation right there! lol
---
I tend to sell or eat food, but I thought it would be handy for ingredients that I'd need later.
---
I just hope is paid Dlc so I can at the speed of light uninstall it
---
Were you there for the E3 announcement? There were promises of cosmetic only items in the atomic shop, that promise was broken when they tested the waters with repair kits and its only gotten worse with the addition of this premium feature. Also,   
---
&gt; There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs. -Pete Hines
---
Obviously this was also a lie, thats why people are upset, and they continue to do it with their reasoning being stuff like private servers, fridges, tents were highly requested by the community. Yes, they were highly requested, but we never asked them to sell them to us. They take ideas from the forums and the reddit and put them behind a paywall basically selling our own ideas, its absolutely ridiculous and thats why its getting this much hate, hopefully you can understand.   
---
(I'm not shitting on you for enjoying the game, I'm happy some people are still able to enjoy it. But what they've been doing has rubbed a lot of us the wrong way.)
---
Ah ty
---
And what did people who continued to support this game expected? They see many of you like this game, some even pay, next step was pretty obvious...if some people pay some money than there are some people who pay more money, less than ppl who pay less, but profit is profit.
---
Can u guess what comes next? How next TES or F will look like? How they new game will look like?
---
It will only get worse, in a few years we will be remembering this with a smile on our faces. PC\\Console games wold be pretty similar to mobile games where microtransactions and paywalls are norm for a long time. There will be some amount of whales and the rest of the players will be just as entertainment for whales cause w\\o p2w whales wont pay, no point.
---
GJ us, it took little more than 10 years but we did it, we, gamers, almost destroyed thing we love...
---
Bet many of us can even remember when ppl start to complain about fixed monthly fee in MMO games..f2p with microtransactions is better right? Or when we preordered games even though there was 0 reason to do it if you buy digital copy...but its "free" texture with preorder...
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation! To be honest     the asking price is for what ive seen same-ish as some other games like ark so it isn’t that outlandish on my eyes, the only thing is the supposedly scrap stash box loosing your stuff, that is what is holding me from getting at least a one month to try it out.
---
Yanno everyone keeps saying how outer worlds is “fallout inspired” and yet, from everything I’ve seen it just looks like a borderlands ripoff complete with crazy loot and over the top characters and humor, and corporations running everything, all running on the way outdated fallout 3 engine with slightly better graphics
---
not everyone lives their mom's basement you know? obviously not:D  
---
and yes. those consoletaxes cost more then internetconnetion per month so i understand why you are so butthurt... and they are required to play games online? LMAO
---
Pretty sure these people saying this is all ok didn't suffer from the start through constant server crashes and reloading just to play, constant bugs half of which still haven't been fixed ( sliding ghouls, disappearing bodies we can't loot, enemies glitch inside rocks or under map, dying and can't respawn so miss event no rewards and list goes on and on...)
---
So to make everything run smoother they make a pay to play service, (which they said numerous times they'd never do btw) to have at most 8 people on a server all doing the same shit instead of 24 doing who knows what and slowing it down?? Wtf
---
People are literally paying now for stuff they should've had and a game that just works, and are even insisting that's ok or normal 🤣🤣 ok whatever
---
Joining as well
---
Yeah, I'm on the fence on this. I only recently purchased Fallout 76 for £12. I've enjoyed the series since the Black Isle days and have found 3,4 &amp; NV to be enjoyable. I put off the purchase of 76 due to the poor reviews, and I'm more into solo play. 
---
I've actually really enjoyed the game so far and the wastelander update sounds promising. While the pay to win element that's been introduced is disappointing for me it means when I have completed the story I will put the game down. 
---
I've already had more than £12 worth from the game.
---
I am just pointing out the facts if you choose to ignore them thats up to you you don't have to buy the membership.
---
Well to the poster to this thread. If you no longer play fallout 76 why belong to its community.. your the one looking pothetic at the end of the day. Not thoes who want to see this game have a future.
---
Don't forget to link [Bethesda](http://falloutfirst.com), together we can make [Fallout First](http://falloutfirst.com)!!!
---
16x the detail!
---
If you pull the plug on every game company that decides to screw you with paid dlc then there will be nothing left to play.
---
THEY ALL DO IT!!!
---
The popular thing to do these days though is just to attack Bethesda
---
sorry for language, but I can't help but think everyone that supports this shit in fallout 76, will be to blame if it ends up in elderscrolls 6, or starfield, and I really don't want elderscrolls one of my favorite game series screwed up by greed..though at this point it's going to be a miracle if it isn't.
---
Notes should be handled like lore in Dragon Age. You unlock the text and it is always available
---
Aaaah, I see you bought the screenshots preserver for 500 atoms.
---
That's not what I am talking about.
---
I am saying it's not P2W, at least not for smart players that doesn't keep useless junk like me.
---
Preeeach, im with ya.
---
yeah I mean it's not like were seeing the same shit in other zenimax games...oh wait we are.
---
[FO76](http://falloutfirst.com) because [Fallout 76](http://falloutfirst.com) and [Bethesda sucks](http://falloutfirst.com)!
---
NCR Ranger outfit was my most anticipated thing in the game almost aince it's launch. I thought they would include it sometime in the atom shop in which I could spend my in game earned atoms. They put that thing behind a paywall... I havent played this game for about 10 months, just came here to say that they fked me over for the last time by doing this.
---
A video of me quitting 10 months ago:
---
https://youtu.be/IDN70102dvo
---
Calling this game a pvp game is stretching it to hilarious levels.
---
so bethesda didnt lie about stash size and problems?
---
Meh I like playing Bethesda games. Rather "stop *pre-ordering* them and don't spend a penny in the Atom Shop".
---
Yes.. Thats what r/fallout is. Also they live 4 now... Remember when it was not an rpg and total trash? They are a finicky buch.
---
Gta Online doesn't take money to run a private lobby either. You're just a fanboy to proud to accept that Bethesda sold the last bit of integrity they had. Everything that is in that pass (that isn't a cosmetic item or money to buy said items) should've been a feature from the start. And that's not a point to argue over.
---
Have you even watched the video? Don't scream fake news if you don't know what you're talking about. This guy even provides sources and does his homework, unlike you drive bying with your lame ass comment here
---
Well you are right, and I am the teacher, teaching children like you not to be a beggar.
---
Every decision theyve made is obviously coming from the publisher. people dont care theyre angry about the game and theyre gonna talk about it. i get both sides but thats generally looked down upon.
---
Good news i didn’t lose my junk (yet) after getting back home I instantly moved v94 steel and flux to regular stash, I don’t care about other junk too much. My guess is that using only my own private world save me from losing anything.
---
Yes i gotta give my shekels to The Todd for good fortune and GG's
---
It's best to turn your ingredients into cooked food and then put them in the fridge, or if you have the backpack mod, as I said it's even better than the fridge at 90% as a level 50 backpack mod, whereas the fridge is only 50%. It's still great for cooked items. They last a while as it is, and slowing it down by an additional 50% is great.
---
It's a fun game, at its core. There's a lot to do, a much broader color palette visually than any other fallout game, wild new enemies and some classics. By my experience, as long as you avoid the subreddit it's a very enjoyable title.
---
I think they should’ve gone the ARK route of having two options:
---
1) a non-dedicated that’s run by the host but has a tether distance as it’s unreasonable to expect a single console/computer to render the entire game and still play it
---
2) pay for the server, get the armor and atoms and everything but the armor can be earned in game, the server is always on but password protected, and you get to change at least some of the settings, like drop rates, difficulty etc. at the cost of never being able to use that character on another server
---
Glad to hear you got your moneys worth and are considering quitting soon. I hope you put the game down as to not support Bethesda in what's it doing.
---
I really don’t get these comparisons, they are very different types of games.
---
Good argument yeah they are not pointing a gun at us but you are second class if you dont pay us 100€ 
---
I better buy a 100€ star citizen space ship
---
I remember a few years ago being a mincraft server owner and having to spent money to keep it going. If they do make it private servers like minecraft i can see even worse microtransation sadly done by players
---
Not everybody has 1st, and some of those that don't might still use them.
---
It's still potential money to Bethesda, that's why they're still around.
---
All they need is some dumbass to buy it. That's why this thing exists in the first place. If literally the 0% buys it, Fallout will have to backpedal. But unfortunately I know for a fact that stupid people exist.
---
Well the Ranger Armor works. Also it has the same lame glitchy coat animation it did back in F:NV...
---
Never had one... Judging from the players i kill neither did they.
---
You can say that, but it's only natural Fallout fans would love to see this game turn better, instead of closing.
---
But not as fun as pointing at you and calling you an idiot! I am having a good deal of fun reading posts who actually defend this game and its creators. It is a dark kind of fun, but still.
---
Mo-mo-mo--morrrrrons.
---
So workshops are not PvP zones, that players contest? Hmm seems like you are a clueless idiot.
---
Exactly.
---
Thanks a lot to whoever made it
---
This made my night before bed.
---
and dumb fucks like you are ruining gaming, and are the scum of the earth :&gt;   But feel proud that your fucking up elderscrolls 6, and just about everytihng else in gaming with your stupidity.
---
It is hilarious. Because it’s true lol
---
Because it costs money to open and maintain a server. It’s unreasonable to expect them to create and maintain an entirely new server for every single player FOR FREE. Money from atoms goes towards DLC, money for server goes towards keeping the server functioning. I agree with OP that there needs to be more to it though. Read my previous comment
---
NMA
---
Be sure and screenshot this, to bring up either way
---
lmao.  The sex tent.  That's gold.
---
I hope your scrap box eats your junk.
---
It just works.
---
Hmm. I got it for free with my Xbox one but the code has just sat in my cabinet for awhile
---
”Thanks” for your opinion.
---
For those fine with the game and what it's doing, continuing to play you're literally only enabling them that what they're doing is perfectly fine, They're blatantly cheating you and adding p2w items that they promised they wouldn't.   
---
&gt;There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs. -Pete Hines  
---
It's been months since we've gotten new content, when was the last change of balance in this game? All of their content obviously isn't free, they just sold you private servers. They don't deserve your money.
---
Considering what genre 76 seems to be leaning towards—online survival games like Ark, Conan Exiles and Rust—private servers as a feature should almost be a given. 
---
A subscription to cover server upkeep might be understandable, but Bethesda has not only turned it into a bundle-only deal (likely to inflate the price) and dropped the feature right on time to divert attention from the pushback of Wastelanders... but the price? 
---
100$/year or 13$/month is more expensive than an Xbox Game Pass, Playstation Now or Origin Prime subscription. Keep in mind that those services grant you access to dozens of individual games, while this is a sub in exchange for one feature, cometics, qol items, and in-game currency. 
---
We've seen a similar service coming from another Bethesda-ish game, ESO. 11 to 15 bucks a month for currency, qol and xp buffs, and access to all of its (sizable) expansions. Similar price, massive content disparity but this is tacked onto a free-to-play game.
---
Tl;dr this is bullshit :   )
---
'For 50 cents a day you could feed this poor afghanistan child' ...
---
No, it was P2P with premium, and then turned F2P with premium.
---
It's almost 200 dollars a year on Australia, not far off the price of an Xbox one
---
Lol PvP zones don't make it a PvP game when those take up a ridiculously small portion of the map and are basically useless after 50.
---
Hahaha you a bitch bro
---
i guess true? like i said this wasn't supposed to be negative and i was just looking for resurgence with the game and i cant remember anything that i have waited this long for to be what i thought it was supposed to be it was.
---
I agree with your overall premise. The biggest mistake was doing this after they delayed Wastelanders. Not having content makes it look like you are just milking your playerbase for every dollar. Whereas if Wastelanders dropped with a premium pass, customers coulld at least feel like their money is being put into the game they love.
---
Imagine being this stupid that you think company’s intentionally try to ruin themselves
---
#  There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs. -Pete Hines
---
I honestly feel like a lot of people are buying it for one month just for the costume, emotes, and atoms. After this month I bet a significantly less number of people will still have it and out of them many probably just forgot to turn off auto renewal.
---
Would be better to shut down this dumpster fire and focus on a game they haven't ruined yet
---
I am pretty sure they don't need to pay for sub or don't actually play the game.
---
I am not talking about self esteem. I would never talk to crowd who I don't know or even a person for matter about it. What I mean by self respect is when someone or company as in this case Bethesda is treating you &amp; community poorly taking you as gullible idiots that you should not stand for it.
---
No, only you see the names
---
Or buy cheap rum from a game company but here we are. Some people are just stupid.
---
&gt; it's falling from a cliff.
---
That's sounds like something that happened accidentally.
---
It's more like it got thrown of the cliff by Todd Howard
---
No one else would see the name in game
---
Comparing FO76 to Destiny and Warframe just makes me realize how much the game really is lacking.  It felt like a fallout with less content from the first perspective but when I see it from the second it just really shows how far behind the curb Bethesda is with it; it still has release Destiny 1 amounts of content and the gaming community has already decided that that's not enough for this type of game at this price point (now even more for this subscription).  Sure, just like Destiny 1, there's a community that enjoy what is there enough to get value out of it for them but that doesn't make the lack of content and polish acceptable just because a small percentage of fans get hooked enough by core mechanics to get value from it, especially when it wasn't even marketed to that crowd.
---
Outer worlds is just a borderlands ripoff in almost every aspect, running on the fallout 3 engine, but y’all ain’t ready for that discussion yet
---
Well said.
---
&gt;dumb fucks like you
---
. 
---
&gt;**your** fucking up
---
Every time, man. Every single time.
---
$2.99 per NPC. /s
---
Sorry to hear. What a bunch of shit. They can't get ANYTHING they make to actually work.
---
hehe you idiots are so cute trying to defend companies fucking you over :&gt;   Love how you suck up to companies while you and them ruin gaming, been playing for nearly 40 years and the remember a time where the stuff you guys shill over money for used to be part of the actual game, before people lost self respect and intelligence.
---
I'm more worried they'll up the price of atoms to compensate for some of the player base having 1600 a month.
---
If it’s one thing I like it’s complete strangers on the internet telling me what to do. Keep up the good work 👍🏻
---
Enjoy being toxic...lol
---
I like the game and don't mind supporting it to get a little something extra. The subscription is less than the cost of one trip to TacoBell each month fer fuckssakes. You crybabies just enjoy working each other up over nothing. Hysterical bunch of ninnies wailing like banshees when you don't get something for free. Settle the fuck down.
---
says the person defending fucking up gaming, nice come back.
---
Nope. I have it. Put it in my scrap box, game crashed for unrelated reasons later, logged back in, and BOOM no scrap.
---
Yea I remember when I made a long rant about how his game was absolutely broken and as a software engineer I could tell the “tech limitations” were a bs excuse from Bethesda. Some of you agreed while the boot lickers came out in force to tell me how I was wrong. Interesting that you can have unlimited storage now for a price when it was “impossible” before due to “technical limitations”... where is your Todd now boot lickers....
---
Never said they should be let off the hook. 
---
I was merely commenting on the statement bethesda is the worst of them.
---
Why not just keep playing adventure mode like nothing ever happened?
---
bethesda are basically too dumb to make effective money schemes, is what i gathered from the last sentence
---
For 1. Zinamax owns bethesda. As they also own ZOS. ZOS runs ESO who has had a subscription base for years. 2. Even tho alot dont like it bethesda was already working on a subscripion since day one. Alot of MMO's including ARK Minecraft ESO all have Subscriptions. So if you and others expected bethesda not to seek the same from its community then you are the one who is clearly blind.
---
TL DL
---
Yes they didn't, but the nerve of asking more money out of this messy game makes me very very angry.
---
We paid for the game, how about first making the game a little more decent? Then sell your little sub.
---
Funny since I started playing, and since I came back people of all levels are taking and contesting workshops. And I should know because I PvP, and used to spend most of my time taking workshops. I have full sets of PvP armor, assassin, sentinel, cavalier, unyielding, and two-shot, explosive and bloodied weapons for that very reason. People will always contest the munitions factory, fusion cores are important for PA users, and junk is important for everyone. Another clueless idiot shill.
---
Thank you for putting it better than I ever could. If you let industry get away with this it will leak into Bethedas other games and into industry as whole
---
Reminder that the private servers that aren't on when you leave which I think is the first time I heard game do that.
---
4 more.
---
Free on game pass.
---
I hope you are getting paid by Bethesta
---
What about those comments from betshesda that they cannot increase stash limit cause you know server will not be able to calculate it....... Yeah total bullshit.
---
Probably watching all the shit go down. It happens all the time.
---
it's not about not affording it, it's not wanting parts of the game taken out, or screwed up on purpose just so they can sell you a fix later.   Tired of games breaking basic game features on purpose, just so they can sell you the patch for it.
---
Definitely more like this.   
---
http://www.falloutfirst.com
---
Don't worry, the Brahmin Armor will be added as extra storage for 1000 Atoms in the Atomic Shop soon.
---
Vote with your wallet. This whole thing has 0, count it 0 effect on me and my experience with the game. I have no intention of paying for a server until wastelanders comes out, and that’s only if it’s good enough to keep my attention for a long time. Blowing it out of proportion is the problem, not what Bethesda is doing. Don’t like it? Don’t buy it. If enough people decide not to buy it, they’ll either lower the price or remove it altogether, problem solved
---
Great. Another tell me what to do post.
---
No worries mate, I gotcha! Somebody's gotta look out for you and be the canary in the coal mine!
---
cheers!
---
Perhaps because obsidian entertainment the company behind it also made fallout: new Vegas, that a lot of people consider the best story in any fallout game.
---
YES IT WILL AFECT YOU
---
Think about the robot and the fridge, things like thst are gonna be behind this paywall, now you are second class
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Iq5W5DP0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Iq5W5DP0Y)
---
They're not mechanically similar games at the core but they're definitely marketed at the same people.  It's like arguing that taco Bell and McDonald's aren't direct competitors because one sells burgers and one sells tacos
---
Na man. Everyone who bought fo4 is a sheep. I am too. I knew it was trash. Everyone told me it was trash... But ya know.. Fallout. So i went for it and it got less then 10hrs from me.
---
I waited on 76... When people started crying they were getting killed by other players i knew it was time. Got way to many hrs from me.
---
I would also add in, unlimited stash, repair kits, refrigerators and other things they are charging us for are problems they made, then they have the balls to charge us for fixing it.
---
You proberbly don't realize how petty and jealous you Sound.. if only you spend half of that energy om getting a job, you would be over here enjoying the sweet sweet carefree thing that we call " playing a computer game we like and paying next to nothing to do so ".
---
I mean, yeah it sucks, but at the same time, why would you pay for this subscription?
---
It's overpriced and hardly worth it and only enables scummy practises.
---
Only heard about this happening on console.  Haven't heard about it happening on PC.
---
Even wolfenstein has microtransactions and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if DOOM eternal comes with them in some way aswell
---
&gt;By logic, games w/ transactions in them should be masterpieces cause so much money put into them as opposed to games w/o transactions. But its vise versa. Shows how stupid these defenders are.
---
It's basically the same as people who defend trickle down economics. Greedy people will greed, simple as that
---
This is never going to happen in this day and age where gamers don't want to pay for content.
---
I kinda feel sorry for you that you have nothing better to do... maybe take the time to uninstall the game and leave the forum...
---
people are so butthurt for optional subscription and they still pay their consoletaxes that are required to play any game online... we didnt need that scrap box or other stuff earlier to play
---
Having an infinite storage for your junk and a tent that you can place anywhere to store your junk totally isn't p2w. Yeah....you don't have an obvious advantage over non-premium players.
---
you should join us over at  r/fo76filthycasuals 
---
We're a much more civil group over there....and casual about the game. Heck, quite a few of us decided on a 1 month trial of this thing...even if we cancel, we keep the atoms, the Ranger outfit and the emotes (that are actually more like dances). When you look at the price of the recent Pint Sized Slasher bundle, it seemed reasonable.
---
Yikes, where did this psychoanalysis come from?
---
Why not just everyone pre-premium, you want to win good faith don't single people out and make an elitist club within your own game.
---
Yeah, like I said, a subscription model for a video game has zero impact on my life and even less impact on my self-respect. But hey, I also get the concept of profit versus cost. 
---
Do you actually play Fallout 76?
---
enjoy your buggy scrap box.
---
to the surprise of no one Bethesda can't even do p2w right.
---
Money grab and a lot of people took it, good for them. I bet them tip twitch cam girls too
---
Stupid
---
Lol forgot about that crap too.
---
Its wht really kicked off this common place microtransaction bullshit right?
---
This is textbook parody (he's using Bethesda's IP to mock and criticize and Bethesda's IP) and unambiguously fair use. It's no different than writing a critical product review laced with jokes.
---
Of course, fair use is an affirmative defense, which means the people you're parodying sue you and then you pay a lawyer to go to court and claim fair use. And courts almost never award attorney's fees for a successful defense, so even being right will still cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars out of your own pocket in attorney's fees.
---
In the U.S. legal system, criminal or civil, being right isn't as important as being rich. You have the rights you can afford to defend.
---
Realistically, he'll just get a scary cease and desist letter and he'll either comply... or balls up briefly enough to get a lawyer's quote and *then* comply because holy shit.
---
Probably about as many Pint Sized Slashers I've seen running around.
---
Yeah...because it's not like dumb shits here arn't the reason were seeing more and more scummy shit elsewhere.  If your fucking up fallout 76 stayed there fine, but it's shit like this why more games are charging you 'time savers' after they made the game harder, because they know people will buy and then defend it.
---
It's the same as ESO plus and there's not all this outrage like this. A lot of ppl have it and love it. Hell, eso plus gives an XP boost, at least this one doesn't.
---
People who are encouraging companies to keep screwing people over deserve to be screwed over by said companies.
---
 “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs."
---
Bruh I love the game and would understand paying for private servers, but the scrapbox and tent being behind a paywall is pretty bad, it's not like you can buy them with atoms either so you can't say you can grind for them, you absolutely have to pay to get them.
---
The problem is 76 isn't an MMO. There is nothing massive about it, it's just an online game with a little base content, barely any endgame content and no major updates in a year.
---
I have to second this. And yeah, dlc's offering additional CONTENT were said to be free but private servers, that's different. Private servers require additional manpower to maintain and, depending on additional mods, patches would have to be designed to not interfere with/be broken by these mods. Private servers were possibly not even part of the original game plan, so to speak, and probably took a lot of work to make happen in such a short time frame, all things considered. Just my 2 cents.
---
Pls XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I think it’s funny that some are upset how others spend their money they earn...
---
Tastes almost as sweet as knowing Outer Worlds is not even going to beat Fallout 76 in sales numbers.
---
Thank you internet. You are the best.
---
I mean that’s what you get.
---
&gt; The game was almost done.
---
Where did you get that? The Wiki says "It was in development for several months in 2000, but never had a concrete development team and had not been developed past conception."
---
that's no entirely true. people had reservations with the micromagaging aspect of the game from the very beginning, specifically the stash limit. except Bethesda said it was a design decision based on server limitations.
---
...and now they're selling the solution to an artificial problem they themselves created. yeah.
---
and I pay on PC exclusively.
---
This is getting ridiculous honestly.
---
Well you can just do nothing. Cut any contact with company and their games. Tbh im on this sub cuz i forgot to leave.
---
So if you were the one to pay for a teamspeak server or host your own website for a clan do you consider yourself above the other players in your clan because you have admin privileges? or do you consider yourself the same as every other player?. Because by that argument you could say that about everything if you pay for something someone else doesn't have they could feel that way.
---
I don’t think your argument works in this situation. Prove me wrong.
---
You need to cancel your subscription, the month should run out and you don’t need to pay the next month.
---
You remember that guy the propaganda minister for Iraq, who kept going on TV saying everything was fine during that war? That's what you idiots are like.
---
Exactly.  It's just the final insult to their customers.
---
Y’all scream about them doing this, but completely miss the easiest way to get them to remove it or at least make it cheaper
---
You guys blow something that has 0 effect on you way out of proportion. What you should do is: 
---
A) not talk about it all and stop spreading word of it everywhere, giving it more publicity. And most importantly:
---
B) D O N O T B U Y I T. 
---
Nobody taking about it and nobody buying it is a surefire way to get either reduced prices or have it removed, but y’all don’t understand what “vote with your wallet not your keyboard” means
---
I don't get that, I'm fine with being charged for DLC as long as it's good and such, better then being sold 30% of a game, and being promised they will give me 90% later, and then charge me for the last 10%.
---
my biggest issue with fallout first isn't the charge, fine servers cost money, it's really about the unlimited storage that people have had problems with since day 1, and their solution charge you 100$'s a year for it.
---
I'm a console player so don't know if it's an epic store exclusive or not. But I have some comments to make.
---
1. It's free on the xbox game pass so for xbox players  it's an easy option to try at launch.
---
2. I don't get the epic hate all over reddit.  I played fortnite since day 1, but not the BR game that kids and streamers like to play, the original fortnite (now known as Save the World). Its a unique and fun experience.
---
Yes. But if that’s what you are looking for you probably already don’t like fallout 76. Fo76 is a co-op base building, farming, looter shooter.
---
Never buy Fallout 1st
---
I agree with that but the flip side, a few friends and I along with my son launched his first nuke and had an amazing time overall... the game was running smoother than ever. 
---
I haven’t placed my scrap or the tent, not sure how to even place the tent haven’t checked.
---
Baghdad bob
---
Bruh, as much as I love borderlands and fallout, i play games for the gameplay, and less for the graphics. The other day I was playing Super Mario World on a dusty game boy.
---
If people want to continue the 'it's only cosmetic' argument down to it's logical conclusion, why not just have the game include no interesting visual elements at all. You can have your character look like a grey mannequin in a flat grey world with no textures at all. Why would it matter? The gameplay is unaffected.
---
He said no lootboxes. There’s no lootboxes to be found. You’re twisting information to spread a false narrative and hate monger
---
And begin again. The Sierra Madre Casino awaits you...
---
oh it's definitely a game where you can (spend)
---
yeah, but MTX dlc is the lowest level I've seen since microsoft and nintendo stopped doing that years ago.  *aka the rage 2 dlc HAS to be bought with in game currency, you can't even get a seasons pass unless you bought the deluxe version, and of course, you can't buy the 1500 coins required, you must buy 1100 and 500, or 2500 coins.
---
look like you lost your intelligence if you think elderscrolls is ruined by people who buys subscription... mayby they start development from scratch if no one buys fo76... yeh sure
---
Its much much cheaper then running you're own server. Granted you get tools and pretty much the keys to the kingdom but you're 80$-200$ a month for that. 
---
Which in turn creates more "self business" people who try to go cheap then spam donate messages.
---
Its not good.. But its not bad either. It's exactly what people said they wanted. Time in There own world. If you're not paying to keep the server running someone has to.
---
I'm a console player too but PS4. What I meant is, gamers have always a reason to whine about something.
---
I think, the hate on Epic is, it forces PC players to install and use another game library (Epic store) instead of using Steam.
---
What about the infinite junk stash? And thats only the beginning; there is gonna be things like the robot and the fridge behind this paywall.
---
I still have hope for wastelanders lets see
---
Whats does it even matter if there is barely any PVP in the game? Yea those players can pay to make things easier for themselves, but as I stated before all they are doing is robbing themselves of the full experience.
---
The thing is the indie dev team behind No man's sky are a small group of people who made their very first game. If that game made noone happy you would never hear a word from that team again thats why they are working extremly hard to make their product a big seller.
---
Beth doesn't give a fuck. They have all the money they want. And if they can sell you a simple tiny retexture of a object you can have for free for 20 bucks, they also can sell you features that are actually bugs. They hire  little students to work on f76 while the real concern baths in the op whale money
---
Well I started Fallout from NV, and I also played Skyrim, weight management was always there, so actually I am not mad about the stash or stuff, it's part of the game, and 800lbs now is fair. Junk stash is just a little niche convenience.
---
Repair kits is also something like that, and we can farm them so it's not even a problem.
---
Refrigerators I heard the food longitivity was nerfed way back and then slightly increased a few updates before. So yea you can say that but again I don't find the current longitivity of food unfair.
---
The sub is a good deal, cheaper atoms and a few benefits, but they should fix the game first.
---
this is going down in history
---
The junk stash has a significant effect on the game, you can basically farm for infinite amounts of ammo and just store it in there in junk form and craft whatever type of ammo you need whenever you want. Giving you an obvious advantage for the simple fact you have UNLIMITED junk storage compared to a non-premium player.   
---
" In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-**paying** peers." &lt; The Gameplay advantage you get is being able to have infinite amounts of junk compared to a non-premium player.
---
There's no point in pvping, the workshops take significantly longer to produce things than if you just go out and get it. NW is for PvP, they could remove PvP from adventure and it'd barely make a difference.
---
PvPers had their own space and it was so unpopular they couldn't even justify keeping it up.
---
your personal experience means nothing lol
---
At this point it's best to just let it go. Talk with a friend or a family member about your grievances. Take a stroll in the evening and accept your thoughts for what they are while you're gazing at the sunset. Just remember, it's okay to feel like this. Acceptance will come in time. We have all been there.
---
It's like ESO plus mostly. It's not that bad of a deal really. I'm kinda glad I got it.
---
#Be careful with him, he’s a hero
---
yeah, I just really think the pricing and removing of features to later sell you is shitty.  100$'s a year, and the best feature on it outside of the servers is the unlimited stash that no one was asking to be charged 100$"s a year for.
---
I wonder if the people defending Bethesda's decisions are the same people who were defending EA when they tried to add pay-to-win lootboxes in Star wars battlefront.
---
Pay to win is a general phrase that means pay for advantage. You don't have to literally "win" something for it to be p2w.
---
It’s called business and when people demand and want more they charge them just like every other business. 
---
People demand better well that takes money to pay employees. 
---
Instead you decide to trash people and the game once again in a forum you could leave and maybe say something positive about a game you like... but here you are...
---
Yeah, first thing I did was add it to the way back machine too
---
It really depends on your perspective of what you think is more sinister.
---
 I just find it interesting how Bethesda has already released Fallout Shelter 2 exclusively for a chinese audience for starters. Or the abysmal state and outright manipulative marketing for their products (canvas bag, nuka dark, t-51 recall, etc.)
---
Why? Because I gave a non-biased, non-vitrolic, non-conformist to the rest of this sub answer?
---
I can understand with regards to the unlimited storage etc but the private servers should never be considered content. Its a hosted server what would you rather it be peer 2 peer because they could have made it that way but then odds our internet speeds would effect your game experience.
---
Haven’t even placed it... don’t even need it.
---
I'm only to happy to give Osbidian 60 dollars to get the Outer Worlds. Helping an old friend indeed
---
so can you give me 2-3 examples how someone purchased 1st now screw you up?
---
What does one win, exactly? How does my buying the subscription affect your game?    (hint: it doesn't)
---
Well that the instant Karma for supporting them :-)
---
I think they could probably argue that it's actually a review of the service through satire
---
is fallout first available now then? would you say its worth it?
---
 "In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-**paying** peers."    
---
&gt;Any gameplay advantage over their non-paying peers.
---
The advantage you receive is having infinite amounts of ammo/junk. This is a pay to win mechanic, I also love how you casually left the scrapbox out of your post and talked about something that isn't the problem lmao.
---
I know it's more like Rust or Ark. A fallout mmo would have been my dream game. Outer Worlds at least will be able to scratch my RPG itch.
---
The stash box doesn't work, and it can simply delete all your junk. Is that what you want?
---
Don't side with them, don't support their scummy strategy. Do not become a member.
---
Because I have done everything and my stash is 800/800?
---
so you just don't like money, that's it?
---
I'm sorry but this is sad and funny at the same time. I don't support this decision of their to create this subscription program. But even if someone did want to buy it, with their track record, you should have at least waited a few days to see if there were bugs before buying :\
---
I am not saying you are wrong, I really hope they are going to fix their game just as much as you do, as that is their job. 
---
But the issue is that beyond this, people expect anything they put out for free just because they paid once.
---
Complaints I see around are not because of the bugs, they are all about these 15 Euro per month that should not be there. It should have come later maybe, but we do not know what their plans are.
---
Same here vibration was what i noticed turned back on.
---
lol thats how i feel awesome
---
People don't like the truth.
---
some people are downvoting you because they are salty, but what you're saying is absolutely correct.
---
if you don't think they arn't going to fuck up elderscrolls after seeing how stupid people are here then your delusional.   this is all a testing bed to see what people are stupid enough to accept and pay money for so they can put it in other games.  They may not put subscription base in elderscrolls 6, unless they make it MMORPG light too, but they sure as heck will sell you features like refrigerators, unlimited storage and such.
---
Unlike the idiot who rants and throws a hissy fit about a game while trashing others in a forum about the game... haha! 
---
Look in the mirror... now who is the idiot here? lol
---
Because yes, it will affect you; so you are lying
---
I don't recall any part of the game being taken out.
---
Don't get me wrong I don't think unlimited storage should be behind a pay wall but I am just pointing out that the cost for running a private server is cheap by comparison.
---
Well kinda true.
---
How the hell do you think of an NFL team while reading this? Lmao
---
This is the future of gaming, the more Bethesda prove this cost model to investors other gaming houses will have to follow suit to attract their investors. The only power you have here is your wallet. If reddit were to have a month where you cancelled all of these type of subscriptions somebody may take notice. If  the cancellation could be organised for the same day it may impact their subscription servers. 
---
Christ enough of you guys gave up wanking for a month last year, nofaptober or whatever. I put it to you that this is a worthier cause. Whereas last year you stopped for a fuller bag this year you’d stop subscriptions for a smaller unusable bag (not canvas).
---
Or we could do nothing and say we were there when gaming died.
---
So they would take something meant to be an exclusive to get people to sign up and make available to all... yeah that’ll go down well...
---
... which probably means you’re correct and it’s exactly what they will do
---
As I said I love the game and it's definitely nowhere near as bad as the internet makes it out to be, hell even the armor would be excusable to be behind a paywall since it's just a cosmetic.
---
But things like the scrapbox, tent and others should be free or at the least available in the atom shop instead of needing a subscription and this is what most people are angry about, and rightfully this time.
---
I've been on Bethesda's side ever since I've got the game but this was a really stupid decision.
---
Huzzah! I kill 100+ players for junk. I may stalk a low lvl at workshop but thats to kill the ones who are coming to get him.
---
Unwilling bait i guess. I had lots of fun interactions coming up and i hope i represent that to others.
---
I will always gg you... Never combat log ( i will turtle down the road with your shit!) And send a friend.
---
100% think I even paid $70 on release date! Gimme that free year Bethesda!
---
" it will also act as a second fast travel point in addition your main C.A.M.P., giving you even more freedom to travel anywhere in the map without spending caps, just your real money! "
---
Genius.
---
No. It's just ripoff. It's more like spitting on their fans faces.
---
It’s like when the game first came out. Every post on every fallout subreddit was people saying nobody’s playing it, not to get it, get a refund etc etc and yet when you started up the game it was a completely different story. Every server was full and people were experiencing a game they were excited for, and not a single person screaming to get off (except the “reviewers” if you can even call them that, that played 2 missions and a total of an hour and decided that was enough to see everything and form an informed opinion, all of which just hate mongered for views)
---
The fallout community is super toxic, but the people in the community that actually play the game instead of bandwagoning are usually pretty chill
---
so they didn't break how weapon and item degredation worked just so they could sell you repair kits, they didn't make food degrade fast, so they could sell you a refrigerator, they didn't make scrap take up most of your stash, so they could sell you the ability to have unlimited?
---
Most positive way to look at it that I've seen here, cheers, well said.
---
I’ve worked since age 12, retired military 23 years and run my own business out of my home office... i sure do like money!
---
Actually the full combat power of any build is usually unlocked at levels 58-65 - because you need few levels of perks available from level 50.
---
But yeah there is nothing in this game that suggests level 300 is stronger than level 70. In fact, if PvP is considered, there's a greater chance the level 70 is freshly-leveled PvP toon armed to teeth than there is of level 500 player being PvP ready.
---
Instead of level 500 characters, us PvPers tend to have a portfolio of different toons for different purposes.
---
EA is too busy writing thank you cards to Bethesda  for taking the heat off them
---
Im on xbox and there its available,dont know if its worth it,the first month is tho,you get all the goodies and get to keep it even if u stop your prescription.
---
You tried to cheat the system xD don't you know by now Bethesda is the one wearing the microtransaction pants ?
---
Everyone is doing it now though, blizzard have had there own launcher for years and ubisoft also does it.
---
Yeah thats true, I dont have a problem with that; theycould at least give us more stash space, that was a problem supposedly and now we got infinite stash if you pay lol
---
That's not how private servers work, my dude.
---
Oooh so you never saw the southparkepisode with the crowdfunding company called Washington Redskins? XD give it a try, its hilarious and fits sooooo to this satyre page and behavior of Bethesda
---
mayby cause they dont earn money themself... its that couple bucks from mum's wallet per week don do much:D
---
I feel sorry for you but please stop buying their shit.
---
oh, the poor, poor developers who can't even edit CK entries properly. random people on the internet with no access to the source can pull off fixes faster and without messing up a dozen other things. but not the official team.
---
they deserve nothing. I agree the fault behind the latest mess up lies within upper management but the developers aren't much better. lots of the bugs reported time and again since beta aren't complex or require overtime, they take literally a minute to fix.
---
Oh my yes. The beginning of predatory mtx at least
---
You know what, the devs are so responsible for all them bugs.
---
If a person doesnt want to do PvP all they'd have to do is not hang around workshops and they could play the entire game without ever having to fire a shot at another player. YOU'RE the "clueless idiot" who think that just because the game has tiny optional PvP areas that means that the game is automatically a competitive intense PvP shooter.
---
so they didn't make weapons degrade faster just so they could sell repair kits shortly after?
---
Ah, haven't seen this type of baiting here before. Should be interesting.
---
Same. What I’m saying is that in the gameplay they’ve shown, it’s exactly the same engine as fallout 3/New Vegas that’s vastly outdated, with the same stilted, clunky movement and gunplay. The only difference is the narrative ripoff and a slight graphics improvement
---
God I hope this is satire.
---
Pc user here and my settings where also resets. When i started they game i was at 1080p so i had to fix all my settings from video to adio
---
Relax Chicken Little. The sky isn't falling in.
---
Very funny
---
I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be woefully, blissfully unaware of when I was being taken advantage of. You seem pretty happy to be that way. Shame.
---
weird considering you're throwing it away for no reason whatsoever, then.
---
I guess you must *really* like New Vegas.
---
you get it from 94 raids and make the legendary PA out of it. Ironically, most of us don't have it because we're worried about doing 94 raids and losing all our stuff.
---
and that comes from a veteran like you.. 0.o
---
who pissed in your breakfast cereals?
---
I haven’t placed the scrap box or the tent, ranger outfit is kinda lame since eyes don’t glow red like PA... so that would have been a bad atom purchase anyways. 
---
ESO plus is successful and I can see them making Fallout better!
---
If you stop using the same Two Shot weapons every time you might notice that no, they did not. Degradation has been in every Fallout game but the 4th.
---
I might be the only one that has ever said this but I actually like the stash limit it makes you have to think about things a bit more rather than just filling your stash with everything you find. 
---
Even a 1600 stash limit would change nothing as you would eventually fill it and be back to square one.
---
The people who now have unlimited junk will still fill the stash up just with other things.
---
probably not, but this will deal some damage
---
No your personal experience means nothing. You might like "going out and collecting", like the good little shill slave that you are. Many people take workshops for passive resources. That is a large part of the game for many people. NW is just another BR failure, trying to capture Fortnite's success. Many people don't like open PvP, and the implementation was stupid. If you stay alive long you're visible on the map. What a great idea for people who may not want to PvP all the time. Workshops are controlled, by when you want to do it, when you want to take them, when you want to attack them, complete control of when you PvP. But you clueless shill idiots will say anything to make it seem like the unlimited junk stash isn't pay to win, but YOU FAIL, because contrary to what you might believe, most people are not as stupid as you.
---
Im pvp and I like to talk and play a little bit, like a good wastelander
---
There is a lot of types of players
---
You mean the devs that had since Fallout 4 to work on the shitshow of 76?
---
Lol now this is P2W
---
I CANT BELIEVE THIS SHIT.
---
Do you think that calling someone who is having a civil disagreement a "clueless idiot" makes your statement true in any way? All youre doing is painting yourself out to be the one with a low IQ.
---
At this point I wonder if Wastelanders is even real. Even if it is you can practically guarantee the disappointment.
---
Your*
---
We know. This post is just a copy of hundreds of others so far.
---
yeah. they're even more of a sink now. seems their health pool is a lot bigger, too. that on top of the regen and damage bug.
---
Thanks man :(
---
what the FUCK is GOING ON?
---
Thought the subscription was for private servers?
---
That maybe the least positive thing (for all Bethesda games) actually because it means that this could have a very negative on all future Bethesda AND Bethesda game studios
---
Na i kill people for junk. Not to annoy them not to bug them. It's simple math and time.
---
I as well as many others... Have killed thier white whale... A guy carrying so much shit i made 1000s of ammo. It was so bad i had to robin hood it out at the train stations. Too much junk. Think i killed one of those "legacy" carry weight players.
---
I don't think anyone has even looked at the other changes tbh.
---
THAT JUST HAPPENED DUDE
---
Oh, was this a balance change?? Were people getting more scrap than intended? Seems like they want to keep scrap somewhat valuable then, good thing there are stash limits for these things to ensure some amount of scarcity, so players can't just hoard an infinite amount of scrap. Wouldn't want to totally fuck the in-game economy, now would we?
---
Still 20% upvotes? XDDD
---
$100 over 12 months is dirt cheap entertainment! I have 700+ hours in game so a few cents over all for some extras? That’s a steal!
---
I prefer ”theycott”.
---
fuck bethesda and fuck the mods afaik they're in on it
---
It has such a small community because the toxic backlash at every turn. Do you really think most gamers want to join a game that is being seen as garbage. I dont think so.
---
why are people still playing this buggy shit? There are more games on the market to keep you busy for at least the next 20 years
---
I'm the same as you, I would rather pay for content but that isn't how gamers are today. They want free post launch content but then turnaround and hate how companies try to monetize the game to make up the lost revenue.
---
You're the idiot, saying "There are more people who love it". Have you seen the main page? Look at the thousands of votes. That is real people, not you shills pretending like "everyone loves it". Look at YouTubers YongYea etc. Look at the comments on their videos. You are ridiculous.
---
Yeah I have it full of good weapons, no chems no junk; is what I like to do in all my fallout games but right now im ultra overcumbered and I have nothing else to do in Game so I just dont play until they give us a little more of stash, and while Im waiting I found this 100€ bullshit haha
---
They aren't dumb or stupid. They are incompetent,  they come up with ideas and often fail on the follow through. 
---
The game probably wasn't sustainable through cosmetic sales alone, at least not long term as trends probably predicted a decline in sales (as most people get a few skins and stuff and are happy, or they run out of camp space for their decorations) 
---
The subscription they offered for premium private servers wasn't even a bad deal, tons of atoms, private servers, scrap space and even some cosmetic skins. Its better than what people assumed with private servers (which most reasonable people would know were gonna be paid). The problem is their framing, the framed to sub as haves and have nots. 
---
When you see the sub and realize you won't get those benefits you feel cheated. You feel like you are missing out. What they needed to do was drop the cosmetics for atoms so anyone could get them, but subscribers get them for free. The scrap space, they should have added a limited small version say 25/50 of each component. It would be minor, but free up stash space for free players and give them something to enjoy and leave them feeling good about the update even if they don't subscribe. 
---
What makes bethesda incompetent is that they implement good ideas on paper, [good value and deals on private servers with added perks, allowing for a more sustainable income model] in the worst way, and present it to players at bad times. [Right after a delay] 
---
The subscription model they are going for would likely be better long term with a more consistent income rate and might actually allow them to develop more content. With the atom shop model they force the financial viability of the product on how much X,Y or Z cosmetics they sale and thus have to keep cranking them put as priority. 
---
Bethesda is incompetent because they take solid plans and somehow do them in the worst way possible.
---
True, didn't think of it like that. Appreciate the reply.
---
then dont buy it. you managed play 700+ hours without it so i assume you know you dont need collact every tharsh you find
---
Who decides on the “time limit” for food degradation, who decides on “stash limit size”, who decides on how fast weapons break and what’s best for game balancing and what the team envisioned they game would play like.   Those are the weakest arguments I could hear.  Give me some legit glitches that actually piss you off. 
---
Remember back when people would shoot explosive weapons and the enemy would be invincible. This was game breaking. And they fixed it.  Nothing you mentioned makes the game less valuable or unplayable.  Bad arguments.  No one I know cares about any three of the items you mentioned.
---
Same. My morale regarding this game has been at an all-time low. In the past two months I've really only played while meat week was active. I may check out the Halloween event but after that it'll be back to not playing fir weeks at a time. If Wastelanders sucks, i'm basically leaving for good.
---
Agree with you, disgusting
---
I've gotten 3 in the last 6-7 runs of it.  Given them  away to friends too. It's pure RNG. of the 30+ runs I've done of it, I've gotten it a total of 6 times.
---
I heard they nerfed the perks, but imo there is no point in using those perks anyway.
---
Nah you are the clueless shill idiots. Everyone can see through your BS. Do you really think your feeble, futile attempts has any sway over anyone's opinion?
---
You guys and your stupid robot dance... Not even slightly jealous... Nope not one bit.
---
For paying for something you like and enjoy? Nope... I’m very aware... shame really is blasting others personally... that’s pretty shitty of a person to do that... also stop the passive aggressive crap... it’s not working either...
---
Not the time bro. this subreddit is all about newly added subscription plan atm
---
They didn't seem to take that much longer to kill than usual so, idk. *shrugs*
---
I horde far too many weapons most of them I will probably never use lol.
---
Throwing what away? lol
---
Yeah dont do it man
---
It’s for private servers run by the person who paid. Completely optional and has no effect on gameplay or your personal experience whatsoever. Stop spreading false information, and look at other posts before posting yourself
---
Holy...  crap.  I've never really looked into it, but the PC games pass is only $59.40 per year!
---
The only thing is that when a game leaves the game pass library, you no longer have access to it even if you have it downloaded.  So if you're looking to *keep* Outer Worlds, be aware that at some point it will leave the library and you'll have to buy a copy.
---
They're probably crying in fetal position. I had also a post downvoted into oblivion by those fanatics.
---
Bethesda is a corporation that survived on sales of games alone for years. Bethesda drove the base away by taking years to release hollow garbage then proceeded to repeatedly test the loyalty of their fans. 
---
You're right, they're not forcing us to buy it. The fact they're even offering it is enough to repulse people
---
But this isn't about **you**, we all know how easy it is to make ammo. Which is why being able to just go crazy and farm for as much lead and steel as you please and **literally** remove all weight from junk and put it in a fucking box that has unlimited storage, something they said they couldn't do because of "stability" issues, is blatantly p2w and shouldn't be in the game after they themselves promised nothing like this would be in it.
---
They haven't woke up over the countless other screw ups that they done over the past years, horse Armour, stores, paid mods, canvas bags, atoms, limiting game feature and now adding them in behind a pay wall. They are making millions, they will not change unless people start leaving them or stop buying their products. Then they will pretend to care until everyone forgets and do the same thing all over again.
---
Fo4 was a a fucking dumpster fire for fallout fans... Still sold really well on console.
---
I get that a bit, but there is also the prices they put them at.   This has some of the worst, and dumbest prices.
---
Repair kits are earned in game, and you can still repair the old way. You can get a refigerator mid for your backpack by just doing dailies. Unlimited scrap stash is a great convenience but not having it doesn't put you at any kind of disadvantage and you can play the game as it has always been. I do agree stash limit is way too low and should be greatly increased.
---
Name calling... are you like 12 or something?
---
Yet, it doesn't Yet, give Bethesda time n this may occur in the future.
---
I'm not outraged I'm just disappointed it's actually come to this. I'm actually on the fence about this whole 1st business, i can see and understand both arguments n views.
---
If they are going to have exclusive items in 1st the least they can offer to those who don't subscribe is a 4-7month gap chance to get those items after they come out for the subscribers
---
Reported for lying and you probably are getting paid by Bethesta
---
Of course mistakes have been made, the game's state could (and should) definitely have been better, but they're getting a lot of shit, even for stuff they probably didn't even have a say on. They can learn from their mistakes, but I don't think they should be crucified for them. They're still human. At least they (and by they I might only mean the portion that really cares about the project and is giving their all) aren't deliberately screwing us over.
---
Why? The atom shop items are worth nothing to make or at least very little. It’s not like in real life
---
Why are people still playing this pile of shit?
---
You sound like a 14 year old girl on Instagram who found out Tiffany was talking shit behind her back
---
No problem, friend. :)
---
At this point I'm looking forward to the mods use their Charisma 10 on this one
---
You are clueless idiots, and deceptive manipulative shill scum.
---
The bugs they still have not fixed since day 1 😂😂
---
think it’s coming next week with the candy bowl and coffin backpack skin
---
&gt;Same thing happened to me too.
---
I don't disagree with you that Outer Worlds won't sell anything like a Bethesda game but contextually your other arguments don't make sense.  Fallout 1&amp;2 sold very well for the time and for only releasing on 1 platform, I don't know where you heard that they sold poorly.  New Vegas wasn't received as well critically on release because it wasn't as out of left field and initially exciting as Fallout 3's drastic changes from 2 and it was plagued by a ridiculous amount of bugs due to being rushed out but those have since been fixed and the novelty of fallout 3 has worn off.  NV is, for the most part, the typical fan favorite and I think if impartially rereviewed, NV today would be more critically regarded than FO3 and FO4.  It sounds like you haven't played NV, and if that's the case then you genuinely should as it is one of the best RPGs ever made.
---
Also awards in the gaming industry mean very little, they're given out so arbitrarily, usually to the games with the biggest marketing budgets.
---
I don't think they will, look at how much paint jobs cost, even Fallout 1st won't be able to buy all of the things.
---
Is it 8 a day now? Careful though - there's a lot of people that were saying there seems to be two levels of detection. It's like they flag you as looking dodgy and monitor you. First flag doesn't do much but the second is actual ban. I might be wrong but I think the first flag restricted how often you could sell cars? From memory.
---
The actual gameplay of GTAO went downhill after they went all Saints Row. Flying cars and bikes everywhere that are better than anything else. Even helicopters and 'planes. I still played that game to death (Fuck shark cards - I ground out the top apartments, bunker, all the businesses, biker stuff, etc.) but pretty much always in passive.
---
I’m excited for Wastelanders! I’m going to restart the whole game with a new character and enjoy the NPC deal, I love 4 and other series!
---
Nobody asked you to play FO76 either so, off you go.
---
I hope you learn your leasson
---
Hahah, I wish. If I were really being paid, I would've defended the new membership system. I'm really just pointing out the fact that there are still good people, employees, humans like me and you who might not deserve half the shit they're getting right now for stuff they might not even have done themselves.
---
we use it to show our love to robots after winning a nw match :)
---
As they’re will be more atoms being given out to subscribers so I just have a feeling they’ll creep up the prices to de-value the cost of atoms.
---
As long as the owner doesn't pretend to be Bethesda (in a non parody way) and doesn't try to sell it I don't think there's anything they can do about it
---
at this point I'm pretty sure even the mods are in on it. Don't trust'm.
---
wow, lucky. wish it wasn't in the US PS store
---
I bought a month just to see what it’s like. An hour into it I got disconnected. Just turned the game off, when I get back on later today I’ll see if my junk is gone. Based on what I’m reading it will be.
---
Oh ffs... there's always this guy.
---
Patrolling the fallout 76 reddit almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
What about the unlimited scrap storage and the secondary camp/travel point? These are major advantages available to subscribers in public servers.
---
1. That "definition" means nothing since its one persons opinion and isnt the infallible law.
---
2. Yea the scrapbox does give you an advantage and I'll admit that, but my point is what does it even matter if this isnt a PvP game? All the scrapbox does it make the game easier and less challenging for a player who chooses to fork over real life money. You act as if we are all racing to reach some end-goal for a grand prize and people having unlimited space for junk is gonna help them "win the game". Its just stupid to even care. Its not like some player is gonna show up to your base with a mini-gun and just mow all your shit down because he has more stash space than you.
---
Haha yeah I understand you, its the executives; but the workers know of course; nobody say anything about them
---
Just adds a new dimension to it, i actually like it, i can play single player or invite friends to play. At first was totally against it i didnt want to see the market crash. But now instead of grinding for caps i really just play the game. I take workshops and never worry about getting shot by a lvl 500. U should atleast try it before forming an opinion on it otherwise people will not take posts like this serious.
---
You sure love ellipsis. I envy you. You’re clearly so unburdened with sensibility that you willing throw money at something which has been designed to rake in cash from gullible children.
---
Ahahah
---
I had MS points so a year cost me like $43... The server was literally smooth as all hell... that in itself was totally worth it.
---
Are you even a real person? Do people really talk like this?
---
In the UK. We don't have the McRib apart from 1 monthly special very rarely. It hurts man, it hurts.......
---
I have tons of those Kits laying round from the Queen alone, and I literally only used them once before because I was too lazy to run back to my C.A.M.P.
---
I really cannot understand how you people struggle so much with it.
---
Serves you right
---
Apply a doctors bag to the burn.
---
How much do you want to bet that once all the fallout 1st shit blows over it will be you need to subscribe in order to play the game and the price will most likely double because why the fuck not
---
thank you, not to mention the gameplay features they copy pasted from another reddit post? At this point they're literally stealing ideas from the reddit and charging people for them.
---
Lol what is my "BS"?
---
Design by committee basically just killed AAA gaming. I mean, look at some AAA games today; how many of them include all sorts of game elements borrowed from different genres? It's like the game has to appeal to every demograph so it can sell the most copies. What's left is a shallow flaming bug riddled mess. That's AAA gaming these days. Sure there are exceptions but they're few and far between. 
---
Fire up some games from the 90's or the early 2000's and the first thing you'll notice is how focused these games are. Shooters are exactly like that: they're shooters and they understand their genre well. Same thing with strategy games or RPG's.
---
No I am a Terminator programmed to seek and destroy shill scum.
---
You guys really underestimate how big of a role higher ups play in businesses, especially game devs. The devs themselves are almost certainly underpaid and overworked. They don’t really get much say, if any, on what to do. 
---
If the higher ups like Todd and Pete say to reuse the engine, but the devs say they think it’s a terrible idea because of the bugs, Todd and Pete can say “fuck what you think, you’re doing it or you’re fired” and that’s the end of it. Either they listen or they’re canned
---
The devs just make the game, management tells them what to make
---
I get that, but it's not like this is a knee jerk reaction.
---
It's been a long downward slope with Bethesda sprinkling trees and pointy rocks in for the duration. Eventually the distinction between the two sides becomes unimportant.
---
Maybe if they held open and honest discussions with the devs we'd be able to humanise them and build a relationship with them. 
---
But currently the only relationship we have with them is their shitty game.
---
I'm sorry but it's karma.
---
Option 3: Tesla the old lady with the samples and everyone standing around then TAKE ALL THE COOKIES!!!! Bwahahahaha!
---
Or, y'know, the ever-popular Option 4: go on reddit and cry furious tears about not getting free cookies.
---
And you sound like a made kid still living in moms basement mad at the world calling people names... lol
---
Now you sir are a good fanboy
---
Oh and if anybody wants to know what p2w and griefers really are... play GTAO. You can just buy money. Actual in-game money. Griefers and try hards will show you how softly we've had kid gloves on in FO76 (which I like).
---
Shame p2w has finally arrived with #CashForStash 
---
That has a ring to it. Remember me when that phrase makes it big lol
---
I personally prefer full year of fallout 1st than Death Stranding. All I know about the game is this Kojima guy and his slit eyed protagonist. Have no idea how the game plays since the devs are not telling us anything. Very shady indeed
---
money. are you dense or just pretending to be?
---
My new idol 💯
---
&gt; You guys are just doing your job 
---
You know that the non-management staff are at least in part responsible for bugs that get fixed and then reintroduced, as well as the slap-dash minimal effort hacks provided as features, the scrap box that deletes your junk and the all round insufficient lack of testing, right?
---
I'll never blame the low level techs for the terrible pricing and subscription model but they're not with blame.
---
Same too with PR. Where do you think we got the idea of cosmetics-only and staying on the right side of the line promises broken idea from? What about the disingenuous gaslighting of it being a response to feedback that utility items were sold back to us through the Atom Store?
---
Everyone at all levels is culpable to some degree.
---
Hey I can admit that thats exactly what it is, but dont say that its pay-to-win cause its not and saying that makes no sense.
---
LOOK AT THE COMMENTS! There are people buying this shit! Just stop you damn morons!
---
I'm not defending BGS in any way, but I feel I should clarify some things because the knee-jerk reaction is fairly strong right now and people have no idea what's happening:
---
1. They are trying to follow the Rockstar business model. Have the base game for normal price, have all the future DLCs free for everyone with frequent content updates, but have a plethora of microtransactions within the game, such as the ability to straight up buy in-game currency (via sharkcards in GTA Online and gold in RDRO). **This, ultimately, doesn't affect the average user.**
---
2. **By having these microtransactions and other paid services, they will increase their revenue and thus have more money to keep working on the game and updating it. This is good for all of us who regularly play the game.** Because think about it, someone else is (foolishly) paying out of their own pocket while you keep playing for free and having more or less the same experience!
---
3. Even if they start adding non-cosmetic items in the store, you gotta think about it. As soon as you reach your end game, about level 70-100, you go on a permanent hunt for trifecta legendaries, and nothing else. Nobody cares about cosmetics, nobody cares about camp items. The most important thing are these trifecta items which, for now at least, cannot be bought through MTX. So again, **this wont affect the average player**.
---
Also, in my personal opinion, the game is not nearly good enough to warrant this type of subscription (coming from someone who's spent hundreds of hours just in the first few weeks of BETA/Launch), so it seems odd that they'd launch this so early.
---
But again, none of this will affect the average player. Just let other people spend their money instead of you.
---
Aaaaaaaannndd gone.
---
it's not about struggling, it's about them even having the balls to sell, just have to look at other games where they nerf exp rates or drop rates or such just to sell 'time savers' and such.
---
I literally stopped reading your comment after you contradicted yourself, sorry.   
---
&gt; That **"definition" means nothing since its one persons opinion** and isnt the infallible law.   
---
 Yea the scrapbox **does give you an advantage and I'll admit that**   
---
 "In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a **player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers**
---
Read my other replies on this thread, Ive already explained it.
---
It's not about the money. I have paid for many games and I would have paid for this. However it feels forced. If I want to continue my junk dealing business I have to PAY.
---
1. If I PAID I won't have problems with stash ( which as many people stated was a problem for Bethesda and allegedly caused server instability. 2. If I PAID I could conquer each and every workshop for as much as I like without the fear of PvP or dropping my junk ( which would be neatly stashed in my scrap box ).
---
3. If I PAID I could launch a nuke and collect all the materials needed for stable flux without any competition.
---
4. If I PAID I would have a heavily requested cosmetic item without any other way of obtaining it.
---
5. If I PAID I will be able to do a raid without the annoying lag at that spot. Where you can fail, because the door takes its time to open.
---
6. If I PAID I could set another heavily requested feature that would help me in the higher level zones, without any other way around it.
---
And finally If I paid, I would be able to enjoy the game without any lag or annoying PvPers on top of getting more atoms than the other packages.
---
That's my problem with the optional subscription. 
---
It's not about the money, it's the implementation.
---
Like totally wasting time posting all your hate filled comments in a forum dedicated to the game because you have nothing better to do? 
---
Not exactly sensible is it... lol
---
Don't agree for such dirty moves man people hating bacuse it's what they were asking to add and instead they made it accesible only with this subscription. Don't buy this beacuse even small amount of people is enough for companies to be a sign of approval for such actions.
---
Wow you criticized bethesda, how original
---
only a matter of time honestly
---
wish the material was less juvenile, but it gets the sentiment across.
---
True.. sad but true..
---
I have the power armor....
---
Agree with you, our reward is having our stash 800/800, not playing the game anymore, paying 100€ and reading comments of crazy rich fanboys defending this move
---
Oh I was wondering that, that's good to know, tbh me and my partner normally do our own servers in games and if you're paying nitrado or whoever it's not far off the price they're asking so for someone who was gonna pay anyway it seems like a decent deal
---
Damn just looked at your old post those people's comments have aged like aids.
---
I'm just gonna ski drow from now on.
---
r/whoosh
---
I dont wanna be hard but I learned it with fable 3 long ago, I really meant it to learn about our choices haha
---
U're a fucking idiot man. lool
---
&gt;Because yes, it will affect you; so you are lying
---
Explain how I can directly effected by someone else paying for 1st?
---
I paid for something and received what was offered... 
---
If you hate it so bad, why not play another game and join a group/forum that likes that game also? 
---
Why are you eating your time? Time is money..
---
Better try to remember this day when they announce start of preorders for F5, TES6 and their other game.
---
No harm taken mate
---
I think there's alot of people that don't even play f76 or normally use this sub are cruising this sub just to chime in. Not only this sub but other subs involving controversial games or Dev's. Its like they need to preach how Dev's and mtx are bad and try to come up with clever karma farming comments. I think there's 1 in this post too lol.
---
Omg same AU$300 preorder

Fallout First Petition 
---
http://chng.it/7HMcV2JFLz
---
Sounds more like you want to play a single player game.
---
See I'm honest and I will say most shit in the Atom Store and with Fallout 1st isn't pay to win, and I will argue with "haters" because that is the truth. And the truth is also unlimited stash is an advantage and "pay to win". What really angers me is deceptive manipulative scumbags.
---
Stash junk right now, but later gonna came items like the fridge and the robot (and I paid for them!) But one thing is that; that people can get and another thing is a 100€ paywall yearly
---
How much of the Canvas bag, nuka dark, and t-51 recall is directly their fault can be debated. What it seems like to me. Is they want product A and go ahead and try to sale it before having all the details nailed down and later in the pipeline when issues arise they just try to play it off or avoid the problem.
---
 Bethesda is still at fault and usually it seems more like incompetence than malice to me. Of course thats an opinion and I can see how some would interpret it as malicious. Bethesda gets ahead of itself and tries to sell things before they have a product and when things collapse they try to talk over the problem and save face. 
---
EA/ Acti-Bliz feel more exploitive in a sense that they try to screw you from the get go. They know what they are doing is exploitive and manipulative and they want to milk you for everything they can. They hurt not just players but devs as well. 
---
Fallout 76 doesn't seem like they worked exploiting you for cash into the mechanics more like they launched the game too soon and caused lots of bad PR, which hurt the games viability. and now they are scrambling from monetization scheme from monetization scheme to try and keep the game financially viable.
---
Yeah, I did think it had some similarities with fallout 3/ new vegas, but just the dialogue box was the biggest thing I ve noticed, the sneak system is kinda new. Oh and of course, the budget V.A.T.S
---
Lmao that’s pretty awesome.  I never realized people played the game the way you do 😂
---
That’s a new perspective I learned about haha
---
You’re basically a raider. I like it.
---
Can you explain what Acti Blizz did that is worse than this Bethesda stuff.
---
I mean Bethesda is literaly lying in your face since fo76 has been announced im not familiar with such lies for Diablo 3 or other Titles from Blizzard
---
i really loved bethesda in the beginning... but that has changed.
---
this is just disappointing. it's like a monthly slap in the face of people who love Fallout.
---
There's some fantastic updates and additions here... but it's all overshadowed by #CashForStash
---
except you're not using it. you're not using the scrap box. so you're essentially just throwing money away.
---
and I like the game. I hate the direction it's headed, but I still like the game. despite the fact it's a dumpster fire in all regards. I mean, facts are facts.
---
Few months back and that would have hit like free ammo. Survival was a fun and sometimes real shit talking fest. Imagine pulling that move on some ass clown that told you they can't be hurt by explosives. :) god damn i could of used that.
---
Let me copy + paste what I JUST wrote to you but you are too hardheaded to understand:
---
You act as if we are all racing to reach some end-goal for a grand prize and people having unlimited space for junk is gonna help them "win the game". Its just stupid to even care. Its not like some player is gonna show up to your base with a mini-gun and just mow all your shit down because he has more stash space than you.
---
But why 8 people server when raids are 4 people based?
---
you paid for the month, so when it comes to renewal it would end and the things it can provide you dont have any more. But on a personal note i would highly advise getting it due to the Bethesda lying and misinforming the user on how single player will be implemented among other notable reason to no longer support fallout 76
---
Why did I laugh so hard
---
 That **"definition" means nothing since its one persons opinion** and isnt the infallible law.  
---
Yea the scrapbox **does give you an advantage and I'll admit that**  
---
"In general a game is considered **pay-to-win** when a **player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers**
---
Not really playing a single player game, but also one of the features made possible by paying. Also junk prices will drop when there is more availability and supply due to the subscription services.
---
I'm so happy this is a thing
---
I know man I defended it since launch, i feel so betrayed like a lot of people.
---
I even made videos with a lot of views defending it, because I loved it, with all the bugs and everything, for me wasnt a big problem, but this is indeed a big problem
---
Do it, use your box.
---
Ironically as they complain about people wasting their money while wasting their time trashing a game... that’s literally insane and a waste of time!
---
yeaaah riiiight, what about early access to Fallout 5? :) And also true, sincere apology for this entire mess...why not ask for this? We all know Beth treat their fans with respect, right?...
---
This is the biggest problem. If someone is paying $100 a year in this case, I'd expect a server that's online 24/7 (unless the owner switches it off) like literally every other online game with private server options.
---
I’m not even posting hate. And you’re right, I don’t have anything better to do. I’m on a train heading into work. Sometimes I like to torture myself looking at how other people’s minds function.
---
And that reply was just disappointing. Didn’t even address anything I’d said in the last reply.
---
Truth being told I am okay with up to 25$ per dedicated, persistent, private world that would allow members of my community to play on it while I'm offline.
---
I'd buy one for PvP and would send the access to other teams and one for PvE for casual hanging out with friends.
---
That's 50$ a month I could spend on this game if it allowed us to easily grow the community we're building. Various members of this community expressed the will to pay for their slot on such servers so I doubt this 50$ would feel like 50$.
---
Thankfully i got it for 45€, but seeing it for 30€ shortly after release made me feel ridiculously stupid, especially since i couldnt even play the game for the first week because it always crashed constantly...
---
Pricing is on point here. The atoms shop is whats crazy as fuck.
---
This deal now you get 50% free plus a weird loner world for some reason. Nobody complains when you get bundles with 50% + outfit before.
---
Some weird fucking cunts want to roam a multiplayer game all alone... Cause that's fun somehow.
---
"its all free after launch" that would include updates such as single player
---
Tell me oh wise one, does Outer Worlds have these mythical entities called NPC's?
---
My is some top quality ravioli
---
Not when the executives tell them, don't work on that, work on this shit for the Atom Store, etc. Or put that crashing problem to the bottom of the list, we need to get this other thing done yesterday.
---
so thats where all these premium users' junk has disappeared to, that sure is a nice trashcan!
---
It's an instance on a server. If you take every workshop and then get disconnected, you don't have those workshops when you log back on to 'your' private server
---
No I say good day!
---
I’ve had it for a few hours... wasn’t a priority... launching a nuke with my son and friends was... you know, having fun... that’s what it’s all about. 
---
Does it have issues? Yes! But I still play since day 1...  I also play ESO, love that game as well.
---
Except offer him a butt load of cash to buy the domain. I don't care how shady Bethesda practices are, if they wrote me a big enough check you can be damn sure I'd sell the domain in a heartbeat.
---
You go to the little picture of your account and under subscriptions- you should have your Xbox gold etc there as well.
---
does 76 really count as a "rival" to any game? i'd pick any game to play over this shit now sadly.
---
Well, you were an idiot to subscribe in the first place.
---
As long as he/she sources Bethesda as owner of images he might be in the clear... i think 🤔
---
This move is shocking. I honestly can't wait to play outer worlds tomorrow. It won't be the same but atleast they'll have NPCs lol. Jokes aside it sucks bigtime.
---
Pretty much. We can get outraged online all we want, but regardless of whether the devs themselves want to change it or not, if management decides it’s not worth the money to change it, it won’t get changed
---
The only way to really make a difference is to vote with our wallets, not our keyboards, but it’s impossible to communicate properly with a large enough group for it to matter
---
Yeah, i think you're right. They probably know that this game has no future and want to make as much money of it as they can before it comes crashing down.
---
The latter
---
It just seems like a waste of time to ride a year long hate train for a game you've never played.
---
Bethesda said fuck the wastelander update we need money.
---
Except they haven't given us private servers people seem confused about that Private Worlds is an instance not a server its the same thing as GTA V Online Invite only mode... Its just a normal adventure mode but with matchmaking turned off....
---
If this was a private server that we had full control over and could change settings and mods to etc and was online 24/7 then the price would be fine.... 
---
But its just a new game mode that has no matchmaking....
---
Or if they removed scrapboxes and tents and just made us pay for servers for 10$ a month, then this entire uproar wouldn't have happened.
---
I went all in and paid the 100.00. Played last night for couple of hours. 
---
I didnt have any issue with buying the subscription on ps4 store was very smooth.
---
I had no issues with friends joining me. What does concern me is that on mine it seems like anyone on my friends list can invite themselves to my world without asking me. Now i have to go through my friends list and get rid of those i friended only for trading purposes. 
---
The world seems empty to me and kinda sucked, but popping over to the public world is always an option with no consequences. 
---
The ranger outfit very cool.
---
The forward base or camp thing i like a lot very cool, very convenient. 
---
Unlimited scrap box yes please, i emptied all 8 of my alt characters into one scrap box wow that is great.
---
My first impressions are that it is nice to have an option to play single player and multiplayer, is it worth the money, no not really. 
---
My only big concern is market and how an influx of goods will effect it. I say lets wait it out and really see where it goes, if this makes them money and will include future upgrades and additions then cool, if not then that would suck.
---
Hosting a free 'offline' session in Conan is basically what Bethesda is offering minus the tethering.
---
they thinking money?
---
People can have an opinion about something and others can have different opinions and even opposing views... but trashing people because of their opinions differ from theirs... 
---
Look at the comments personally directed at me... intake it like a grain of salt since many people forget how to communicate without being insulting on social media.
---
always remember:
---
"If you keep buying shitty games, they'll keep *making* shitty games".

Does it have HTTPS? [https://falloutfirst.com](https://falloutfirst.com)
---
Nah, seems like we'll just have to use good old HTTP. [http://falloutfirst.com](http://falloutfirst.com)
---
i think by uninstalling 76 but im not sure /s
---
Hey, I didn't build your glass house and I definitely didn't put that big old stone in your paw.
---
Shame!
---
Yes they make you pay if you want to keep playing, now is the stash but later gonna be stuff like the robot and the fridge, so yeah; pay or you are second class without some features; and this is a 60€ AAA GAME NOT A MOBILE FREEMIUN GAME
---
I still hsve hope for wastelanders but lets see
---
Do not use the scrapbox, you might lose whatever you put in.
---
The robot's lines were also never localised. I play the game in Italian and the motherfucker speaks English at every camp I find him in.
---
Not that it bothers *me*, since I wanted the whole game in English, but it's undeniably an unacceptable oversight to sell something unfinished for atoms.
---
Exactly. If all 15 remaining fallout 76 players start a class action they may actually hurt them.
---
Burn it down to the ground, I say.
---
Haha congratulations, you played yourself
---
And yet my budget didn't move.
---
it's even worse, then. I can respect buying the pass so you can reap the insane benefits of having a private world + infinite storage, but doing it just so you can have a stable session? no.
---
that's something that should be part of the base game. I shouldn't have to fork over 10 bucks just so my game doesn't stutter and crap itself every other frame.
---
or for private servers for that matter.
---
Why year long? Most just hop in when something happens, eat popcorn as they watch, or add their opinion, and then disappear once it dies down.
---
LMAOOOO are you upset? you're\* you forgot the apostrophe. You probably would be able to type correctly if you werent so angry.
---
Is the scrap universal for your account across your characters, or is it character sensitive?
---
You do know that people vote with their wallets right? And that like, reddit votes don’t count?
---
Providence is a PE firm that invested in Zenimax. This info can be easily found online.
---
The junk item box turns your junk item amounts into a character stat # instead of a unique item the server has to remember. Should everyone have gotten it as an option? Yeah, maybe. Is it a game breaking advantage that is worth people losing their shit over? Nah, it's not even useful enough to be worth the price. Just being a new neat looking stash box is more value than the infinite stash space.
---
It's really not a big deal.
---
excactly! :D
---
at this point tes 6 will have horse armor lootboxes
---
basically what you want is normal Fallout mmorpg, not some mutant mod for F4. Problem is - MMORPGs are designed as MMORPGs, developers dont take random singleplayer or even single+coop game and add multiplayer support. Doesnt work this way.
---
[http://falloutfirst.com/](http://falloutfirst.com/) yep, Be the first i\*\*\*\*!
---
Bug due to addons.
---
LOL, still up after five hours. This is amazing
---
ROFL🤣
---
What a cunt.. I bought my rent last month...
---
This is more expensive than World of Warcraft.
---
You. Can. Not. Afford. To. Be. More. Expensive. Than. WORLD OF WARCRAFT
---
WoW had been eating other mmos since the olden days. They have to know they are releasing a tank.
---
Ohh its tomorrow great then, I hope only rich fanboys play alone in their servers emoting the robotdance fornite style
---
My problem is who's to say it stops here and it won't get worse? Can you honestly say you think this is the last "utility" item that they'll add? They themselves even said they'll be adding more. We can't just continue to let them do this and it gets even worse.
---
Lol definitely. 😂
---
As somebody who has experience of the games industry; many developers that aren't just entry-level graduates feel contempt for the consumers of their games. Especially in a game like this where the players are constantly complaining about broken things; we are making their job less fun after all.
---
It's a vicious industry where you have to be a POS to actually get stable employment.
---
Is that seriously your best comeback? Correcting my grammar?
---
Did it make you even more mad? If so yes LMAOOO.
---
Hey, to list junk in your vendor it must be stored in your stash not the scrapper box
---
https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Paid_Mods
---
Truth is; the game was rigged from the announcement.
---
If you think you are second class, that is just you ranking yourself second class. If you spend the money to become "first class", it is again just you tricking yourself into something you don't really need. So jokes on you.
---
I see Game Pass Ultimate and 2 cancelled subscriptions; RIP. I'll contact support.
---
Everyone should go play that. Obsidian has always been more creative and fan friendly than Bethesda. They're at a new low so yeah I say ditch these greedy pigs.
---
Great question. If so then my god... It gets worse.
---
Shame Bethesda can just legally take the domain off them....
---
Oh, sorry. Hope it works out for you
---
Bro all youre doing is making yourself look like an ass. Laughing at your own jokes is corny AF too.
---
You should hit search by top... You're living a fantasy if you think we could ask a question about gameplay/where to find ect. Without umm how do i say it.. "Fans" telling us to fucl off
---
No. They are offering a premium subscription to people who want a private server / want to purchase atoms on a monthly basis.
---
This is an interesting question. I hope they don't get to sell the scrap from the unlimited stash.
---
Image a CAMP with hundreds of stable flux for sale and a bunch of 3* legendary weapons and armour and doesn't have to worry about crafting mats weight...
---
Haven’t trashed your opinion. Haven’t insulted you directly. 
---
I’m reminded of the days where people defended Anthem. You’ll realise one day you’re being taken for a mug. And you’ll leave the game. You’re entitled to your opinion, just going to say that people also had positive opinions about ISIS, IRA and the Nazis. Doesn’t make them right.
---
Linking it basically, like in tweets, instagram hashtags, reddit/facebook/whatever comments.
---
The more traffic, the higher it goes in the search results.
---
I bought the game for $9 a few months after release , worst $9 I ever spent
---
The biggest crime here is the scrap box.. That is what really gets me. That and the refrigerator being locked behind paywalls. The private instances I can understand, and with the free monthly atoms that is actually a nice deal. The problem is that the other two items have important functions, and break a lot of what Bethesda said prior about not monetizing said functions.
---
Why can we have unlimited junk stash now, when before it was “impossible” or w/e.
---
Refrigerator is an important feature, that *needs* to be standard. 
---
I also don’t know what the point of having a cash shop is if you add a sub. It seems the best thing they can do, and the thing they should have done from the start, is to remove the atomic shop entirely and just add a mandatory sub to play. 
---
I’ve always believed that for any MMO It’s better to just have a sub so as to not have to deal with *this exact bullshit*. I’m sure they could do it in a way that doesn’t make console users have to pay to play online, after all, the new gundam online game on PS4 doesn’t require a PS sub to play online so we know it’s possible.. (shout out to /r/GBO2)
---
I'm laughing at you\*\* not my jokes. You're pathetic and it's hilarious, why wouldn't I laugh? Resorting to name calling online because I don't agree with you. It's funny, why wouldn't I laugh? It's the reaction of a 12 year old.
---
I did it for multiple reasons! Not just that... that was an unadvertised benefit! 
---
You don’t have to pay anything... maybe one of your friends will get it and invite you.
---
They launched an unfinished product and got well deserved backlash, and then they started throwing more micro-transactions and adding more mechanics hidden behind a paywall. 
---
This isn't the first time they've tried monetizing something, and I doubt it'll be the last. I feel like their "incompetence" is just a veneer to hide that they're just as manipulative as any other gaming company. Bethesda really doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.
---
Been saying this for a while.
---
Caveat Emptor, The Monkeys Paw, Wishmaster...
---
Nothing against what's being offered, but it's the implementation I object to.
---
No, I don't want a normal MMO RPG with 64x64 battlegrounds and stuff and hundreds of players on one server.
---
I want a regular F76 server with added paid option of kicking unwanted people out. Right now all the pieces and the technology for that already exists, and what I want is a way to purchase different arrangement of existing blocks for my money, because the current one does not suit my needs.
---
I’m not paying for shit. Just saying fuck that don’t forget this game is just now starting to “work” now they have to try to squeeze every dollar they can from the people still playing. Like they deserve our money. They owe us.
---

---
I agree, people love to have outrage over this game. The entitlement of this community is unbearable sometime.  
---
We live in a society where we literally pay for convenience, that’s not awarded to us for free because we bought the game once , a year ago ...for 60$. And most of these  “so outraged” people don’t even play the game to the extent (for example I play almost daily) they are offended by, I checked some Reddit profiles, and they hop from sub Reddit to sub Reddit complaining about how these video game studios some how fucked them over personally....  these kids need to grow up.
---
I mean in this thread not you directly, sorry if I made it sound like that, I apologize if it did.
---
On one side, here's an F
---
on the other, you supported the absolute worst business decision (other than releasing the game in an unfinished state which still applies to this day) that this game has ever made
---
I got the tricentennial edition a couple months after release for $9 AUD... condolences to you
---
They delayed it so that they release a quality product. Nothing is being pushed on anyone. If you don’t want the subscription you don’t need to buy it. How is it being pushed on you?
---
Honestly thought you were being sarcastic given all the hubub, misunderstood you, sorry.

---
It still rakes in cash because there are idiots with too much money and mo morals, so yeah we will still see predatory shit like is more and more every day...
---
I mean what actual big name publishers have games that dont features a shitton of some kind of monteization scheme with "time savers", "cosmetics" or outright "pay 2 win" MTX?
---
Its fucking everywhere...
---
So brave! Owo
---
We should all draw the line here and now. I haven't played in months and only chimed in because of the recent news. I highly encourage as many people as possible to jump ship, this is absolute insanity. We have spent so much money on this garbage fire already. Get out please, before you spend more. Do not give them subscription money. Let's drop the player count and find games worth our time and our money.
---
Then as soon as you say anything that indicates it's for sale the report you for domain squatting
---
I posted the link on where to manage it
---
Seriously. This is my greatest complaint with the tent and the communist power armor.
---
Don't freaking sell stuff that works perfectly as in game content for lore or quest purposes, dammit.
---
Why would i pay money for nothing?  There is nothing new in the game really.  Pay to do more of the same?  Fuck, I guess if your still having fun.  Its not like they dropped some huge fucking content to go with this bullshit.  Cool you can hoard more junk lol.  Would imagine the price of shit will go down.  I dunno.  I wont be on to see.  Got other shit to go play.
---
[fallout first](www.falloutfirst.com)
---
lying is a sin dude
---
Lol, they never catered to you in the first place.
---
The only one they cater is a specific group of people who is so loyal they will jump to multiple mental hoops to justify what the devs did to them was good.
---
Apparently it feels like New Vegas meets mass effect
---
If people are going to start selling Junk items like no tomorrow, prices will simply drop to the point not even them will be able to earn anything out of it. So the difference between hoarding 100 or 10000 Steel won't even matter anymore.
---
And the price to hoard that much still is playing alone, on a private server, which is kind of lame and although I am now subbed, I highly doubt I am ever going to do it.
---
Market will simply shift to something else which is still rare, meaning everyone can still access to it the same way.
---
Wouldn't it be the second schism?
---
I remember Fallout 3's launch left the fandom pretty divided.
---
Although, Fallout 1-2 weren't Beth Games...
---
Maybe now the last S.P.E.C.I.A.L. people defending this game will wake up. One can always dream.
---
Yup, the same for me. Already visited several private worlds of my mates. They feel... eerily empty.
---
Diablo 3 came with a Real Money auction house. Where you could sell your gear from cash which Blizz took a cut of, obviously.  
---
They also balanced loot in a way to make it likely that you wouldn't get items for your class and made the legendary items absurdlu rare thus artificially driving up the price. 
---
Activision pulled much of the same if not worse monetization stuff bethesda has done with fallout 76 in titles like Destiny 2. Until the push for monetization actually caused a rift between Bungie and Activision-Blizzard.  
---
Activision added lootboxes to remasters of old games, has added lootboxes to tons of games, forced arbitrary grind in numerous games, call of duty as an example. 
---
Overwatch is cosmetic only lootboxes. Which are priced similarly to fallout 76s transactions except you get the added benefit of not being able to pick what you get. Sometimes events would require  a 100s of dollars to get what you want in the boxes. 
---
Yeah bethesda has done bad things and sucks at PR. Scrap kits and repair kits as blatant cash grabs, and the cosmetics are really overpriced, the stuff they add to the game is buggy and sometimes messes up, but at least you can buy the cosmetic thing you want directly and they don't force you to gamble to get it.
---
You must not remember every game before fallout 4...
---
The game is already trash.
---
I wish I was an 18- hardcore that thinks this is the end of the world and has no money because they won’t go get a part-time job. See how that works? Stereotyping a huge group of people is dangerous and stupid. Grow up.
---
I mean, if comunity did backlash bethesda, back when they started with simple "P2W" mechanics, we wouldn't be in this crazy situation.
---
Edit: maybe.
---
Play the game... the story makes a ton of sense and explains what happened to all of the humans. It’s a very well written narrative that unfolds over doing quests for &gt;5 factions. They were trying something new where the humans in this multiplayer game were supposed to be the human NPCs.
---
The story is that the game is Fallout:Cosplay.
---
And how do other people having access to those affect you? Someone else can hold more scrap? Okay, and? You can still hold a ludicrous amount yourself. Someone else can fast travel for cheaper than you? Okay, and? Still doesn’t affect you. If they did something like give people who paid the option to deal full damage to players that don’t return fire, then yeah it would be a problem. 
---
But that’s not what happened. Other players just have to spend less time on travel and inventory management. Literally 0 effect on you and your experience in the game
---
*gasp* But that way we wouldn't con anybody, now would we?
---
I use them to hunt the last few plans I don't have. Sometimes you can find nice weapons/armor in them too.
---
That's absolutely great 🤣🤣🤣
---
10.99 for vending machines
---
I really don't care if they do? I don't think the scrapper bot is necessary, or the fridge, or the survival camp or even the unlimited junk box. I have none of those things and I still enjoy the game. And I don't feel jealous or disadvantaged from those who do.
---
I'm up in the air on it. I've come to be okay with Microsoft, because they've been taking a pretty hands off approach to publishing, giving their developers free reign over their projects, which is great in a time when a lot of things seem so forced.
---
And Steam has had some pretty shitty practices come to light in recent years, mostly to do with not paying the developers of they host as much as they should.
---
Careful with that scrapbox.
---
Do you actually play the game? I think main quests were a lot of fun. You are telling me you don’t like rose? You didn’t enjoy the mistress of mysteries questline?
---
Ah OK, wonder what they were doing then, I was exploring the factory no desire to pvp, one guy sat at a table the other up on a machine invisible so I jumped up next to him for a while :) Then left.
---
I'll come back to this comment in about a month when they make us pay for perkcard loadouts, deal?
---
Yea I "called you a name" because Ive already explained myself multiple times and you just refuse to understand what Im saying. Instead of actually discussing the matter at hand you'd rather act like a spoiled little brat being defiant to his mother and repeat the same BS over and over again as if it proves anything. Then the second I reply with the outburst that you're looking for you want to either be petty and correct my grammar or reply saying "LMAOOOO U MAD BRO???"
---
When you act like such a little shithead you make me seriously doubt you're a day older than 16. No adult handles disagreements like you do.
---
Read all the comments from mostly people who don't play the game or haven't played since beta.
---
I'm at least giving it a go &amp; then I can make an informed decision.  The hate train sheep will never be happy.
---
Dont be a bitch. English is not you class to teaxh. And i agree with the rest of you that's not a stifled party killer.
---
Guess you haven't played blades have you...
---
Biggest bullshit click and wait cash grab in recent history.
---
I would like to point out my comment from 11 months ago: 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wz6q1/fallout\_76\_feels\_like\_a\_looter\_game\_that/e9plfco/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wz6q1/fallout_76_feels_like_a_looter_game_that/e9plfco/?context=3) 
---
This was always going to happen.
---
Im glad you enjoy it, Im genuinely happy for you; I have the money too but I prefer to throw it to other things. Im at max weight and I want an increment in stash for keep playing, 100€ for junk? I almost dont have junk for this reasons so no, Im not gonna pay more, I paid several times for atoms, is nothing bad, but this is just too much man. 
---
As I said Im happy for you, Im gonna wait for wastelanders and see later
---
When did EA buy Bethesda?
---
It's really a shame. I loved fallout 3, new Vegas, and skyrim but the dumpster fire that Bethesda has turned into in the last half a decade shows that there really is no future in these franchises anymore. It's a sad day.
---
They could. They won’t. But sure they could do anything. Doesn’t change the fact that this subscription gives you 19,800 atoms in a year for $100. If you tried to spend $100 on atoms outside the subscription you’d get a little over 10,000. These are just facts..
---
The fact that you somehow believe that Bethesda is stealing fork people who are willingly spending their money on a product is just crazy to me.
---
Dodgy + Unyielding
---
Thank you!! Weird it isn't available via my Xbox, hopefully not intentional...
---
The only thing they need to do to make Fallout 1st acceptable is separate the premium environment from Adventure mode. Everything else can come slowly with time.
---
Then it's not Pay to Win anymore. That's seriously the only thing they needed to do and everyone would have loved the stuff.
---
Can you really be against this and still feel comfortable buying it? Idk man, buying it seems a lot like supporting it... Which you know, we shouldn't be doing because it's ass... You know?
---
Maybe you behave like you would behave in person instead of joining the fellow internet warriors?
---
cant deny that me as a 30 y old guy can affor to pay for this but i played since beta and they said there will be no paid content excluding non cosmetics. Alot of my friends just went and payed for fallout 1st. There is so much outrage about it but there are still alot of ppl paying for this meanwhile.
---
hey op, message me for more improving this site cuz' I'm Web Programmer. I'm gonna add some on there and also Neocities (Reboot version of Geocities) has free domain thing (and you can move this domain to Neocities with HTTPS support to see on Google Search)
---
Thank God for him.
---
I am not sure if it should be like this. 
---
Amen.
---
Also people seem to miss the point that this Subreddit is but a fraction of the total playerbase. It is funny how everyone is like "WTF Bethesda, are you stupid?", like they know better about earnings than the company itself.
---
If Bethesda went this way is surely because they know it is going to bring cash in, because outside of this echo chamber there is other people that just play the game for fun, and can afford, or rather don't mind to spend 15 bucks a month for 1650 Atoms and other goodies.
---
Well actually there is a difference.
---
If I paid I wouldn't care If I hoard 100 or 10000000 steel or any other component.  
---
And If I don't pay I will lose my only stable income source due to oversaturation.
---
You may not farm, but others will.
---
And since 5.56 sales are dwindling even now, because many players stopped while waiting for Wastelanders, soon there will be nothing left to sell or buy with caps. Since the only rare thing are legendaries and the god rolls are trade only.
---
Why? Is there a glitch were u lose stuff?
---
lol I remember when IH first posted that video and someone posted it here. Some were triggered something fierce saying "he's a fucking lying liar" and "its bullshit, he's just a hater" and the like, when all IH did was documenting *actual* real world events around the game that *ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENED*. Good to see that it's all gone worst since then. This game doesn't deserve the people that defended it, and the people who're still defending deserve this game.
---
Ah, still around defending Bethesda at every turn. He wasn’t talking about the CC dumbass. Literal paid mods that lasted a day or two because of backlash. CC was their second attempt to not get shit on by everyone. Learn something because you suck dick on every post.
---
you maybe want to check your box and save your junk first. there is a lot of guys (me including) that lost everything putting in that box. all the fluxes and junk i farmed for month is gone. you maybe dont want to have the same.
---
And still bound by the 800 limit?
---
First class advantages are not imaginary so I hope you are getting paid for these lies
---
Thanks, potentially could be a make or break for a player to get. I know it is for me.
---
Yeah I was worried about rare outfits and item spawns earlier but after playing that's just not an issue. When you select private world it still boils down to rng. Its not a fresh untouched world. Sometimes I spawned in to places already looted, some had dead enemies already, not the result of me. Overall it was pretty inconsistent. 1 time I took over a workshop, logged out, closed the app, relogged and my stuff was there. Who knows how that aspect of it works. 
---
It is nice to be able to nuke ws and have em all to myself though.
---
This is a myth that needs to die. Copyright infringement is just as illegal whether you make any money off of it or not.
---
Not only that, he can be sued for defamation for using Bethesda-owned graphics in a way that portrays their IP or company in a negative light, which this site absolutely does.
---
2nd only may speak when they are asked questions!
---
Done with the game. 
---
Call me a fool but I was willing to be patient as Bethesda made the improvements they needed too (this benefit of the doubt is due to many nostalgic memories tied to their previous games, and a love for the company in general over the last decade) 
---
But this is now beyond a joke. Fuck these greedy tactics. I can’t believe they have gutted one of their flagship franchises just to cover the void of no new games coming from their studio anytime soon. What a sick company. 
---
They have completely lost their way.
---
Its coz they will be selling an Advanced Collector Bot with improved rates soon.
---
You are agin putting words and beliefs into my mouth that I have clearly refuted. Stop the straw man argument because ik not buying into it
---
Bethesda dropped the nuke on us like the commies dropped it ingame. They planned the long game and now it's our move... Yeah no more money from me Bethesda
---
It’s not even enough for a power armor skin.
---
&gt; No adult handles disagreements like you do.   
---
&gt;Youre a fucking idiot with serious reading comprehension problems 
---
If you're going to act like an immature prick without manners I'll do the same, it obviously made you upset. I was being civil, **you** wanted to be an asshole so I dished out the same energy. Treat others with the same energy you'd like to be treated with, don't be a bitch online and I won't retaliate by being an asshole, pretty simple. You must still be in middleschool so I'll let it slide. :)
---
Your probably right, but I choose to purchase a private server instead.
---
They should hire you to make their decisions. /s
---
can confirm. lost everything, too. was trading with a dude yesterday and spoke with him via discord. in the 15minutes our trade happened he lost everything, too!
---
They're thinking that there are genuinely people dumb enough to buy a game, and then pay a sub to play it with features they said would be free.
---
Seems they were right.
---
Would have been fair to mark fo76 release day as that.
---
Typical tin foil hat reaction right here.
---
The internet is calling:
---
WE FUCKING TOLD YOU NOT TO BUY THIS DUMPSTER FIRE BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN! :(
---
Don’t* your* teach* I*
---
I'm gonna be honest, I don't touch the blistering Cesspool that is mobile games.
---
Seems to be happening more on consoles, but maybe because there's just more ppl playing on consoles, too.
---
Fuck the subscription. Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
Immagine how many light wood laminates you could buy with 1650 atoms!!!
---
The workers can know something all they want, but they can’t do anything about it. Management and execs say don’t worry about bugs, put this new system in, the workers have to. If they decide not to and to work on fixing a bug instead, that’s insubordination and a gross misallocation of company time and money, which is grounds for termination. If they wanna keep their job, they have to listen
---
This is so incredibly stupid, I love it.
---
👋🏻👋🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
And? CC adds very little.
---
Except dumber so it should be EA 0.5
---
Yes, in order to list the junk in you vendor it must be placed in your original stash box where it contributes towards the 800 limit. that would be so broken if i didn't! the scapper box is essentially an extra box with no weight limit that can only store junk and cannot directly link to your vendor
---
Nice argument, go running to your lonely server robot emote dancing, I dont know what are you doing here talking to plebs
---
Oh i wont put my stable flux in there, junk yeah that would suck to lose. I put it in last night and it was still there this morning even did a count before going to bed because yeah i was a little apprehensive putting all my eggs in one basket..lol so far so good. Thank u for the advice i will make sure to periodically count and check. Thanks
---
yea had a 20minutes later answer to my ticket asking for these informations. i gave them all, fingers crossed!
---
maybe after the lost everything in the vault stories they implemented an easier way to give loot back.
---
Advantage over what, exactly? This isn’t a pvp game like fortnite and there not selling weapons/armor, so what exactly is the competitive edge that having access to literally junk ,that I still have to farm and collect, offer me?
---
As I said before - grow up
---
If he does it may not be for copyright. I'm not certain but I believe Bethesda could take him to court over damages he may have caused by doing this. Bethesda might try to hold him accountable for any lost revenue they can prove he caused.
---
I only bought it for the private worlds. If they remove it they’ll have to refund everyone too.
---
this is what most people cant see for some unknown reasons.
---
Most companies are abandoning "paytowin" after Fortnite proved you don't need that kind of stuff to rake in serious cash. Even EA changed their ways somewhat. Bethesda somehow continues to get worse and delve MORE into paytowin.
---
No problem and yeah that would be crazy if you could list your scapper box stuff straight from the vending machine!
---
I agree dialogue needs to be well structured but i also think person 2 is way easier to ignore.
---
Just all abit depressing really...
---
Monetisation strategies have really evolved games into something beyond entertainment now.
---
Well, I file a ticket, just to bother them.
---
I feel ya idk man i was against paying for the fridge &amp; collectron but worked around it by just grinding more atom challenges..this just leaves no choice but to pay i see that. I figure after over 1000 hours in game &amp; all the friends ive met &amp; how deep in the trade market i am, its not time for me to call it a day just yet. I can skip a lunch one day to try a month of new content before i knock it is all..this is pretty ironic though i can laugh at it now 🙈
---
This has given me the best laughs in a long time. I have a Halloween camp with smoke and bats and I’m dressed as a witch. Every time someone comes in my camp I do this. Been going to random events with lots of ppl and just Mothman dancing. Yes I look a weirdo but it’s sooo funny.
---
Sorry but fucking hell man. Have some respect for yourselves if this is what you are asking for. Bethesda actively trying to fuck it's player base even more out of money and some people are just "well, that's not nice but it's fine if you give me a years free premium".
---
Careful not to give Bungie too much credit with being "away from the big bad Activision" - a fair share of the problems with D2 earlier on are Bungie's fault, not just Activision's. With that being said, Fallout 76 would definitely need to pull a pretty radical restructuring like Destiny 2 did if it has any hope of pulling back from something like this.
---
you're acting like an anarcho-capitalist. so I'm calling you an anarcho-capitalist. it's not rocket science and nothing I said is incorrect. I literally quoted you.
---
While I can't comment much on your first point because I dont know enough about fallout76, your other two are incorrect. Or at least come from an angle that doesn't really reflect bethesda's main goal: Making as much money as possible with as little effort as possible.
---
Chances are that future dlcs will be locked behind the subscription, as an "early access" bonus to sweeten the subscription. And while frequent content updates sound good on paper, theoretically, adding a "summer event" can already count as content. But this event consists of maybe 3-5 items obtainable via gameplay and the rest is only accessible via mtx. 
---
While it is true that bethesda making more money gives them more freedom and options to further enhance the game, this will not be the case. If the sheep are already content with what they get offered now, with the means that are already available to the devs, why bother using up more of the revenue than necessary?
---
It still targets many triggers of the weak minded. And not only those who can easily afford spending their money. It doesn't matter if you earn $500 or $5000 per month. It affects the average player and the non-average player. Those that can pace themselves and those that can't when it comes to spending money on digital goods. Your sentence that nobody cares about cosmetics and that nobody cares about  camp items is either false or a lie. Those items wouldn't exist if nobody cared. Look at Warframe, the sole purpose besides killing enemies in space is collecting more of the stuff you already have, while also looking cool doing it. How does this affect the average player? It can trigger the average player's emotions. That player admires the other one and wants to look as cool as the other guy. Or the average player is envious because that other dude over there can kill the boss 3 times faster and gets twice as much loot.
---
It is not about the gameplay experience. And if it were in the past, it isn't anymore. Gameplay experience has become a side effect.
---
Pirates don't fly the skull and bones. It's just stupid. I will however give the ol finger guns if im coming. Felt the workshops were too cheap. No risk for the attacker.
---
Got into it at the ammo factory and he had friends. Got too wild. Even when i get a kill couldn't ger near the bag.
---
It's a multiplayer game. Get some friends in your list. Bout the only time i have had to back off with tail between legs. :) next time loot pinata, next time.
---
Yeah I understand you, thats why I said its the executives not the workers fault, and they know. I didnt see any comment talking bad about the workers; thats what I meant.
---
im not that much into seo but google uses a form of page rank algorithm so this guy needs to put in some relative links in there

PC, Public, Adventure mode

* Switching weapons unloads ammo on my 4770k machine. My 8700 machine did not exhibit this problem today. Could be related to fresh servers and/or client side performance. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlANHBIy0gM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlANHBIy0gM)
---
* Joined AWOL and two super mutants were just standing there, doing nothing and regenerating health. I'd think the other players saw the same thing as we all attacked them to no effect. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m17X7oWpYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m17X7oWpYY)
---
* Excavator Medic Torso (MT) sometimes fails to activate below 50% health, probably also correlated with server lag. (It wasn't like a rate limit, I walked for a full minute full health before engaging in battle and I got down to 20% health before I recognized MT is not kicking in.)
---
* I fast traveled to Harper's Ferry in my Excavator PA (242/242/366) full health and at the locomotive, I was killed by a lvl 62 Ghoul in 4 strikes. Usually a single lvl 62 Ghoul would kill me in 10-20 strikes if not for the MT. My guess is that the server didn't load me with the PA and I have 0 resistances barefoot, hence the server may have made the Ghoul do full damage.
---
No, you only do that if you're stupid. If this guy has any amount of brain cells he'll just sit on it until Bethesda comes to him, and bethesda *will* come to him if only to strike the domain.
---
i mean shit, they fooled me
---
Honestly if they plan to go F2P then they should of done that and released Fallout1st at the same time and any company with a half decent PR/Marketing department would know this... 
---
I personally think they planned to go F2P and release fallout 1st at the same time as Wastelanders but due to the delay and not having any other games coming out this quarter they did it this way to try and please share holders....to hell with fans.
---
Final nail in the coffin for this trash fire game. Will never buy another bethesda game.
---
The Communist communist power armour doesn’t make sense China never had any Power armour
---
From what I've been reading, a lot of people are saying option 2. It's not a private server, it's a private session. So you log into a server that has no other players and essentially "lock it" for your session to you. So it may have been a server in which a prior player has already looted, just like in adventure mode.
---
Hmm strange, going back to public server, then to private seemed to give me a brand new &amp; untouched world.
---
I agree with the RNG, but half of the challenge for me is the spawn point actually being untouched to begin with. While there's no guarantee you'll ever get what you're looking for, it does drastically improve your odds if you know there's always going to be something in that spot.
---
The public event legendaries, not having somebody always in my C.A.M.P spot and having blast zones for myself are certainly great, but the price is just too steep for me to justify keeping my subscription.
---
Yeah they have themselves in a sticky situation, they'll have to keep providing it as is for at least a month before changing anything. Needless to say, you would have preferred to cut the other benefits if it meant paying less for a private world?
---
I think you seriously underestimate how expensive a legal battle with bethesda would be and overestimate how much people would contribute.
---
those reasons being? because if it's not for the p2w, the privacy, the stability or even the ranger outfit... then it sure sounds like you just enjoy throwing money away.
---
Don’t believe in sin and I keep my lying to life or death situations.
---
people calling everything p2w in this game which cant be obtained ingame. people even called outfits p2w for nw.
---
Also, this is just from what I've read. I have not played private world yet nor have I read any confirmation from BGS.
---
You can see the robot unit in one of the early videos.

 [https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/fallout-76s-dollar5-junk-bot-was-apparently-meant-to-be-in-the-base-game/](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/fallout-76s-dollar5-junk-bot-was-apparently-meant-to-be-in-the-base-game/)
---
local servers are. consider that.
---
Yeah, because rational human beings see this as an optional add on to a game they enjoy, not the apocalypse. Everyone needs to chill. The people that are paying for the subscription are actually subsidizing the game for the people that put any extra money into the game. Simple economics. I don’t care about how you spend your money, don’t try to force someone else to spend it how you want.
---
they did it when they released the horse armor dlc....    Skyrim too, with the home dlc...  trying to get money from the modders, even though the modders are basically what keeps their game afloat.. considering they NEVER themselves patch and fix their games in anyway.  They constantly have taken the most easy way.. getting rid of dialogue and choices (in a fking sandbox-like rpg genre) to including microtransaction.   Bethesda somehow just till today have been able to do almost anything the most easy way and been forgiven for it every time..  like their preorders having to subjected to the court to given a bag they paid for...
---
Right. The entitlement and feeling of “betrayal” that people have been going off about today has literally had me laughing out loud at times. Go do something else if this is all it takes to shatter your world.
---
Yeah you make a good point Bungie do deserve some of the blame. But yeah the dramatic change of direction/restructuring is desperately needed
---
I thought about that at first. So I logged all the way out. I shut the game completely down. I signed back in. And when I logged in I was at the nuka plant and it was evident that it was the same server. Perhaps with the inactivity of anyone else signing into a server I was placed into the same one? Time will tell I suppose I will figure it out
---
I love you, damn good point.
---
This is so OBVIOUSLY parody.
---
yes same here. and also scrapped some bulk junk before. maybe that is was causes the bug for whatever reason.
---
another dude also scrapped some bulk.
---
there is like 10 posts about this now. everyone who have this bug should make his own post so people see this and dont buy that shit before it gets fixed.
---
sentinel or cavalier. unyielding would be best because it impacts str for melee builds, agi for stealth ones, per for rifles, etc.
---
if using power armor don't forget emergency protocols. and dodgy, of course.
---
👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
---
Take a look at Outer Worlds instead.
---
He could literally just release a ten minute long laugh track of himself and everyone would still get the point.
---
Ikr! He is so right about this garbage fire that its hilarious.
---
😭
---
Close. Still couldn't resist could you? That sweet karma for judging strangers.
---
You were being "a bitch" first by repeating the same bullshit line over and over as if you were gonna bully your way into winning the argument. 
---
But hey....people like you arent even worth it. You feel safe online, so you think you can be the biggest dickhead possible since you know nothing is gonna happen to you. Im just gonna go ahead and block you on here and let you be a toxic POS with someone else.
---
Dont even bother responding.
---
True. Most people here were full of sh** to trust a oatbreakers like cun** from bethesda.
---
With a company as large as bethesda they don't need to *win* the suit. You can sue for anything. Most people wouldn't be able to afford to see the end of a lawsuit with Bethesda though.
---
I raged against the scrap kits too. Dont worry im still pissed.
---
&gt;An hour of playing and I probably have enough straight jackets to max my vendor bot cap limit for a week.
---
Not anymore, since inflation will now make the thing utterly worthless.
---
&gt;Bobbleheads and fusion cores in particular can directly advantage your character and you can now farm insane amounts at a 100% success rate.
---
This is the main problem. Coupled with reduced weight of bobbleheads and magazines, this might open new builds for paying users that are not as available for non paying folks.
---
&gt;got a filthy amount of legendary spawns
---
I'd really hate if this meant paying customers will soon have an higher daily scrip limit. This would really make people's heads explode.
---
&gt;Workshops
---
Seriously the only important workshops are the fusion cores and ammo ones. Mats is not more game breaking than just not having unlimited scrap space. As a PA/Gatling Laser build I'd love a few hours alone with a fusion core extractor though.
---
I think if this impacts the base game hard enough there's a good chance they will make the two game worlds entirely separate. That might partially fix the problem.
---
he can just say its not fallout first its fall out first claiming its about the first person to fall out of some where like that slutsofinstagram thing
---
i believe with this bug you will just loose all or nothing.
---
To be fair the performance for me was so much better than public servers, but the economy is going to suffer, as a elvel 96 who has previously had bad RNG i got some real good legendary drops yesterday on my private server meanwhile i was constantly running the abandoned munitions factory pumping out hundreds of rounds with no fear of it becoming contested by a player. i feel like they will eventually have to nerf workshops (in private servers anyway) to produce less loot.
---
LMAOOOO I'd be the same in person dw, I'd probably be worse. And ayeee thanks for my first block you sensitive prick. :)
---
I have a question. If I buy the subscription for a month will the ranger outfit from the NV stay in my inventory after the end of the subscription?
---
And that's the aftermath of that damn horse armor...
---
Sorry what riot gear are you referring to the ranger outfit?
---
Worse is when youth think you are purchasing but you’re just taking stuff out of your own vendor haha
---
It should definitely be like this.   
---
This ^ people like this who don’t even play the game are outraged that people like myself , who enjoy the game , are happy to drop a few dollars a month for QOL improvements. I’d say enjoy your next game but it sounds like you already are 😃
---
Don't forget Bungie. They are going all fuckin in on eververse so far. Not playing in the big leagues yet but they are on their way.
---
Irony of your post.
---
I dont think splitting the player base would be the answer either. How about your money only buys cosmetics like was promised? Now that its out the window my best answer is to just never buy another bethesda/zenimax associated game ever again. Thats the knly way i intend to repay them.
---
Agree, rich fanboys still defend it like its nothing; is not about the money per se; most of us can pay it without hesitation but its the move
---
its okay im just joking around with you :) and good take on lying, life or death respec
---
If there truly are loads of people with subscriptions running around on private worlds, why would Bethesda even see this as a mistake? Sure, people *here on reddit* are pissed about this move but if Bethesda made loads of cash from subscriptions today, they've got what they wanted.
---
\&gt; Private servers require additional manpower to maintain
---
Not really, they don't. It's just another VM in AWS.
---
\&gt; depending on additional mods, patches would have to be designed to not interfere with/be broken by these mods
---
Yes, by modders, as usual. Bethesda will never consider mod conflict in their updates. 
---
\&gt; Private servers were possibly not even part of the original game plan, so to speak, and probably took a lot of work to make happen in such a short time frame, all things considered
---
Was announced way before the game was released, June 2018 iirc.
---
I can imagine a developer coming up with the idea for the tent with the fast travel point for the Pioneer scouts quests, but then some management person is like "No, let's monetize that item", so it was withheld.
---
Why!? My brothers of the steel!
---
I think they separated some public servers and made them private but their numbers are a lot lower so you'll log into the same private server more often than adventure. So it is indeed a private session. When you log off someone else with a membership will use that server.
---
Because I wanted to. The game makes me happy.
---
If he hacked their domain, I don’t think he can make the parody defense. I hope so, since it is very obviously parody and this is hysterical, but the law doesn’t always side with comedy.
---
The limited stash space for scrap was designed to sell repair kits. The patch reducing durability of gear was designed to sell repair kits. The reduced amounts of scrap appearing was designed to sell repair kits.
---
The way that Bethesda has equated stash space with an actual physical space is simply head games designed to make selling their shit easier.
---
Are the emotes and outfit included with the subscription? The site said that you've got to unlock it from the atomic shop after getting the subscription, but it isn't clear to me if there's an extra fee.
---
im pretty sure most of them only bought it for the NCR ranger outfit...
---
Are you for real?  This subreddit went bonkers with hate posts when Repair Kits were announced.  And the collectrons and the fridge.  
---
It wasn't "a few brave people" but thank you for your BRAVE service anyway, soldier.
---
\&gt; Companies and corporations are not just made by cash-grabbing monsters, lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to "milk" your wallet.
---
Are you for real?
---
Link it everywhere like this.
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about the community in the game, just the whales with ridiculous spending power or credit cards
---
Yeah, these are all advantages as you describe them. I didn't say they directly affect the nonsubscribers experience, though they arguably do when you consider the economy. Subscribers will have easier access to legendary enemies, loot, workshops, events, etc on their private servers. On public servers they are paying for an objectively better experience than nonsubscribers.
---
Ah my morning routine
---
They lied. Why you defend it LOL?? Did you forget what they said about paid content before release?
---
Hopefully enough people dont buy this and dont buy any more of their future games either to balance it out.
---
Dont get me wrong, when i seen the news about it i was fuming for that playerbase that wanted and still do play it, its wrong on so many levels. 
---
the reason i didnt get it was because i didnt get it on release, and by the time i thought about it the negative and horrid reviews was in how broken it was (just to clear that up)
---
For sure. The infinite junk storage should be in the base game and the other things I’m not that interested in. I’m happy to do challenges for atoms and pay full atom price for things. If I could pay less for the servers That would be awesome for me, but I know this package deal is better for other people too.
---
Yes, the Veteran Ranger outfit is LAPD Riot Gear in-lore.
---
Wise move, me and a lot of people I think we are in the same page
---
I still have hope for wastelanders so Im gonna wait before uninstalling
---
I know dude. What I’m asking is exactly how to do so, I followed the instructions it gave when I bought via PSN store and the option is not there when I go to my subscriptions tab under account management....
---
You guys and your conspiracies.
---
Hope the game is fun single player since you love to see people quit vs wanting the game to flourish
---
You could be more content without spending any money since they would add it without charging you for it.
---
Yes it does.. You have more junk for me to steal next time.. Oh wait.. Ffs the top lvl excavator players may have less junk.
---
My white whale. I think i changed my mind.
---
Yeah player economy and vending is dead
---
fucking hilarious!! has me waving and laughing how bad this game is!!!
---
You forgot the most important one. 
---
A daily login payment.
---
by lying
---
Ive discussed this with a lot of ppl already &amp; were all pretty confident majority of the guys complaining today will give in &amp; buy it eventually. Like many things in life if you didnt participate &amp; havent experienced it, you dont really have a say here honestly
---
I am not even going to use the private server, I don't like the idea of playing FO76 as a single player game actually. I just did it because it's a great Atoms deal and for the ATX sales.
---
See? The problem with you people is that you always think you know better than anybody else.
---
That's why I am mad about it. Make lore about it and add a quest under mama dolce. They already successfully stole a Power Armor so it's not farfetched for them to reverse engineer one like the US reverse engineered the Stealth Boys.
---
But the stealth boys have lore to them. This power armour won't, that's what makes it unacceptable.
---
It's like the Jet screwup in Fallout 4. If they bothered writing a couple of lines of lore about it instead of just ignoring the issue it would not have been the controversial point it is today and has been since 2015.
---
I agree. I think for the money, since these are not actual dedicated worlds but just private sessions on standard adventure worlds, you should be able to have 24 players same as any other. 
---
I also think they need to add value down the road and have this include the ability to host mods, customize the world and host your own events.
---
If goin to use dodgy you have to put some points on action boy too otherwise you never gona have ap
---
Yeah I’m so judgemental and bitchy for caring about grammar. God the world would be SO much better off without me, we need more illiterate people.
---
I could see that there would be some benefit there if that’s the case. Suppose you’re doing a cap run at nuka world. You log into a server where half the cap stash boxes are missing (which happened to me). If it’s a busy time you could log out long enough to server hop private servers until you find the items that should be there.
---
fallout 2 there is a woman that’s been addicted to jet longer than the person who apparently made it has been alive
---
*inhales air* don't. Pls don't show bethesdanyou are willing to pay subscription for one item.
---
Oh... Also you can mod your Conan server.
---
For me, the appeal will always be my character. I make a character, I build them up in a certain way, I quip them in nice items that I collect for them. When I come back to a game I always check my inventory. I check my stash boxes. Look at the stuff I have. Then I will find out what's new. What new stuff can I get for my character. When I don't play a game for a long time, it's the character that I miss, not so much the game. Sometimes additionally I miss some NPCs or some zones/areas in the game in general.
---
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
---
Can't believe people are butt hurt enough about first to downvote legitimate questions about it 😂
---
Which is still over twice more than the private lobby offered by Bethesda here :|
---
That’s kinda cringe bro.
---
Fallout is the series for which I own the most copies of the games across multiple systems. I've got a tattoo dedicated to it, and good collection of memorabilia and I purchased 76 when it was first released at full price. I have great memories of playing FO3, NV and 4 from the past ten years. These titles got me into gaming as a young teen. I love Fallout.
---
However, I fucking hate Bethesda. Blinded by cash. This is a complete joke. They're on a different planet.
---
I agree the moneitisation is questionable on a lot of their products.
---
Id like a source on the Diablo 3 thing specialy because there also was a gold auction house where you could get good items.
---
Overall happy that they removed the auction house.
---
However i dont see how this is comparable to this situation people knew there was Lootboxes in OW, they knew there was Real Money Auction House in Diablo.
---
Before the product was sold
---
What im seeing here is a product advertised with the promisse of free content after 1 time purchase. that they now slap a subscription service on.
---
Some people spent more on their collectors edition then i spent on Diablo 3 since the release (Base Game, Addon, Necro Pack) and they have stayed true to their monetisation strategy.
---
Well I’m part of the actual player base and literally not effected by the outrage. If you let other people’s opinions effect if you enjoy something, then I’m not really sure what to tell you. Games is fun , play it almost daily (just to clear that up)
---
Yeah have done that before too!
---
Omg it was worth paying it just for the Mothman dance emote. I’ve not had this much fun in a long time.
---
That's how mafia works, just don't buy it, there are worse deals
---
It is LITERALLY like Bethesda just "[executed order 66](https://youtu.be/xSN6BOgrSSU)" on their loyal 76 players who still defended the game
---
At this point I'm convinced you can release a bag of shit and people will still buy it if you hype it enough.
---
So much of the player base is 18+ casuals? Imagine that, a game rated M for mature in North America and 18+ everywhere else is populated with people 18+. Bethesda did their homework, identified a target demographic and launched a service based product at them. They targeted 18+ because they can have credit cards, independent financial means and expendable income. The truth is. If you’re under 18 this product was never intended for you as you won’t be a source of recurrent spending.
---
Oh for sure....there's no way Im buying the 12 month plan lol. After you get the extras the server isn't worth it to me. I may down the line buy another 1 month, if I need atoms.
---
Take my downvotes sir!
---
&gt;Not really, they don't. It's just another VM in AWS.
---
Still takes up resources, unless it runs on dried potatoes.
---
&gt;Yes, by modders, as usual. Bethesda will never consider mod conflict in their updates.
---
Modders will patch the game?
---
&gt;Was announced way before the game was released, June 2018 iirc.
---
Then people got what they asked for, be happy.
---
Because everyone totally loves having a Netflix, Hulu, crackle, Disney+, appleTV, Amazon Prime, and YouTube Red subscription...
---
First of all, thats assuming they can find him, and since he's probably from 4Chan, good luck with that.  Secondly, on the off chance that he does decide to fight back and can afford it, (which wouldn't be hard as im sure there are plenty of people who'd be willing to help him fight such a BS case from them after all the crap they've done), he will get it thrown out, and he may even be able to hit them with sanctions for trying to use a lawsuit as a false pretense to shut him up, which is illegal.  It's still a viable threat, and could totally work, but that could also flip on them if they guess incorrectly on their belief that he won't fight it.
---
Conspiracies? Business entities exist to produce profit, otherwise they cease to exist.
---
they're free with the subscription
---
I just spit out my coffee reading this.
---
Yeah the tent is kinda cool, i bet u wont be able to or the scrap box. Just my guess
---
You're a dick and so far off the mark... Here have these clown shoes.
---
YOu can't. You might be able to do it for a very short period of time, but you won't outspam AdWords' supposed results.
---
Who doesn't
---
Keep this in mind when the hype train for ES6 and Starfield kicks in full gear.
---
Place your bets people. Agree 100.
---
How about Bolstering? Ive never used it but u get good dr and er
---
I'd love you forever if you managed to pull it off. but if you can just take a look at the Appalachia.btd file and how to unpack it that would be great.
---
I've been looking into porting over the assets to Fo4 but that damn files eludes me.
---
I'm already on the fence whether to at least give it a try just for the NCR costume, let alone for the tent lol
---
I feel dirty n unclean just thinking about doing this, feeling as tho I'm selling my soul to the devil for an item I've wanted n asked for to be introduced
---
Very good point!
---
but they are not local hosted. they are hosted by Bethesda.
---
if these were local hosted. we would have options to change certain aspects of the game, and mod it. but this is not possible since they are not local hosted.
---
So you are mad at people who decide to pay for a premium service? How does this hurt you? Serious question? I have a principles problem with the scrap boxes but besides that why does this upset you?
---
Also... I am guessing from your comment you are &lt;18?
---
I like the multiplayer too so I would not use private servers neither, its the move what I dont like. As i said, now is the unlimited junk, later is gonna be things like the robot and the fridge behind a 100€ paywall, thx but no
---
Forget the bag.
---
Something people do not quote very often is that the helmet itself was a mess with really bad chipping plastic, shabby paintjob, malfunctionin voice changer and only semi-tnansparent visor. 
---
This was a disaster that cannot even be used for LARPing.
---
If it gives you an advantage, you won't be able to keep it.
---
I'm running out of clown shoes, but here I have one last pair for you.
---
Forgot to add the word "probably" this is just a speculation but a valid one since this is not the first time it would happen.
---
they should be, that's my point.
---
That’s the point of a private world..
---
Discount pricing, added benefits, it’s all possible and That’s going to suck for the ones who just dropped 100 dollars yesterday.
---
Fully agreed about the necessary changes in the future, such as i.e. a toggle to define PvP as none/tag(current adventure)/open, but the ability to simply connect 24 people people is enough - I can host my own events without any in-game UI, as long as the participants are able to connect, lol.
---
The game doesnt even have enough content to spend 100$ a year. 
---
You explore the world, doing all quests, thats 2 or 3 months, then you are done.
---
Outer worlds is a reddit replacement?  Who knew.
---
\&gt; Still takes up resources, unless it runs on dried potatoes. 
---
You don't know how server hosting works, do you?
---
\&gt; Modders will patch the game?
---
As they did with every Bethesda game in last two decades or so?
---
\&gt; Then people got what they asked for, be happy.
---
What does it have to do with the quote that I replied to?
---
If I buy the monthly subscription, will the ranger ouftit stay after the month?
---
Agree haha
---
See, friend, here’s the deal. And don’t take this as me being angry. I’m not. 
---
It’s MY money. Not yours. The feelings of those who don’t like it do not dictate whether I nor anyone else do like it. This game makes me happy. Being a Fallout 1st member, getting to jump on a server and farm extra ammo and other stuff at shops makes me happy. Spending less for more - as I tend to spend at least $20 a month getting stuff from the Atomic Shop - makes me happy. The outrage mob does not dictate whether or not this game makes me happy. You do not dictate what makes me happy just like I don’t dictate what makes you happy.
---
Here’s an example. 
---
The Outer Worlds is coming out. It *looks* nice and I’m sure many will enjoy it. One of my best friends is gonna play it because he wants to. I, in the other hand, have no interest in it. None. Zero. I watched the trailer after he sent it to me. Didn’t sway me. But, just because I don’t want to play it doesn’t mean I’m gonna sit here and tell him or anyone else they shouldn’t because it looks meh *to me.* 
---
Get what I’m getting at?
---
I read recently something interesting about this update. Players profile is mainly 30-40yo. So 15$ is not  (Should not) a problem. I like the game and don't care to pay 100€ year to play with friends in good condition. 
---
If I were still student with low revenue yeah probably I would be very upset. If I were +30 and upset for 100 bucks/year, I will stop the video games and will look for a job or a better one. 😂
---
It's too early to say if 1st will be a success or not. Let's wait a bit.
---
In the meantime my money goes (and I hope) will improve development and game contents to have good game experience, including no premium players.
---
Not a bad reason, for only a month to give it a go is something I can understand but not something I'm going to be doing. I'm the same in that I bypassed a lot of the other pay to win stuff by grinding and not spending a dime, this time however I can't help but feel they've gone to far, especially given a lot of this is content people have been wanting since launch, so Bethesda knows people will buy it.
---
Yeah unlikely, they had all the good will in the world before yesterday. We accepted quitely the delay of Wastelanders, that is a whole bunch of goodwill.
---
They are just out of touch and thought we'd be happy with this and it'd make up for the delay of the DLC.
---
U should move on, not trying to be unkind, just saying its not for u and posting about how little u have played it shows its not for u. No worries there are 1000's of different games out there, find one u like.
---
#CashForStash
---
I see no problem there.
---
Uninstalling?  I said I was quitting r/FO76, not FO76, there is nothing to "uninstall".
---
This sucks shit but I’m a filthy casual so I don’t even touch the game anymore but someone explain, so GTA online allows you to play solo or with your crew for free and what Beth are trying to do is charge you for that feature?
---
I'll see what I can find out
---
This [http://www.falloutfirst.com](http://www.falloutfirst.com) page is wonderful!   
---
Everybody should go to [http://www.falloutfirst.com](http://www.falloutfirst.com) if they wanna know exactly what they're getting for their money.
---
I spent ages looking for it and realised it’s not in the pack. It look pretty cool too.
---
How comes you had them to begin with, eh?
---
No Fallout 1st just completely destroys the player economy and vending system. Rare items aren’t rare anymore with empty servers for whales to search through uncontested. Bobble heads, fusion cores and plasma cores will be in world unlooted by anyone else expect them to crash in value as well. Taking the munitions factory without being contested by another player? Ammo isn’t even worth 1 cap anymore.
---
Carrying private server characters into public is P2W and destroys a factor (trading) many people enjoy.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. Lol
---
Yeah because it's fucking ridiculous. You should have been wrong lol
---
I was a clown thinking Bethesda wouldn't fuck me over...
---
r/realheroesdontwearcapes
---
I feel you. I've been defending this game but this is going too far. I feel bad for the game. They really pissed to the wind this time.
---
I know and i agree to a point. but as to why they are not local hosted, is due to the game not being ready for modding or tweaking of game files.
---
So as i said before. we are paying for a service that normally cost money. plus we get extra free stuff. thats my point
---
/r/outerworlds/
---
Oh, and buy the game. It's an actually finished product complete with NPC's!
---
I had the very same thing, some random guy I must have traded with one time just showed up and one shotted the horde boss I was farming.
---
Shame the franchise had to die like this.
---
Dear Velhalgus this game will never flurish. By design it was a clear cash grab made to fuel development of Starfield. They only thing which kept me fanaticly playing that game was a great comunity. Since that comunity is fractured and most of my in game buds leaving i dont see any reason to suport tgat game.
---
oh yeah like the vending machines, fridges and showcases deleted all the stuff, too?
---
i expected a lot of things, but not that you just loose all your junk like dropping it to the ground.
---
For me they never land and just fly away, so annoying considering I’m a melee build
---
It got to that point a year ago and the true blues shot any criticism down which enabled Bethesda and now look.
---
“You asked for it, what do you mean you didn’t want to pay? Oh our promise? Sod that, your ideas are way more valuable as a revenue source”
---
You'll be hunted down by Zenimax lawyers for all the rest of eternity so I hope you live in a country like China that doesn't give a fuck about US intellectual property, otherwise you won't get away with it.
---
&gt;You don't know how server hosting works, do you?
---
Pretty sure CPUs aren't fueled by bananas.
---
&gt;As they did with every Bethesda game in last two decades or so?
---
Single player games only.
---
&gt;What does it have to do with the quote that I replied to?
---
If you don't understand it, then you just prove me right.
---
Does the bag of shit allow me to alter my character any way i want including types of builds, does a bag of shit allow u to play in a big world filled mostly with cool people, i could continue but im sure u get my point. Its a good game and eventually im sure all game will be like this.
---
this. no that i can grab every piece of junk i find i will be soon back to all my junk.
---
but its the fluxes that hurts \^\^
---
Noone ever said that Wastelanders is going to bring actual story and interesting characters. The trailer said: Here have some generic Preston Garvey Settlers. And thats all folks!
---
 [http://falloutfirst.com/](http://falloutfirst.com/)
---
You will have access to the scrap box but you won’t be able to add to it. And you will keep the cosmetic items. The private world and rent go away
---
Look at this from side of post-apo fan. Not fallout itself but post-apo. Fallout is one of major players in this theme and company that makes fallout started doing shit like this. DON'T let them do such things otherwise not only fallout franchise will be corrupted like this. Don't let this crap go outside of this one franchise. They promised shitton of things (which was no p2w) and lied basically about everything. Now look from fallout franchise fan. After paying 60$ you spended on release they want take from you another part of money (big one tbh) for almost nothing yet giving advantage. It's like somebody spit in your face and told you it's raining. Fuck that im saying. Im not playing f76 anymore but this what beth is doing is disgusting
---
My perks are all melee cards in the strength category, and some other armor perks, with mixed body armor of various types and levels, one two and three star. I had everything set up so that my knives were faster to swing, with loads of added damage and vats targeting bonuses. I could kill a level 89 Gutsy with one or two blows. A legendary of the same rank would take more blows, but my fights with them were always done very quickly. I had non-automatic rifles perks in the P category built up so that my three star hunters handmade would kill just about anything with under five rounds spent. I had perks cards set up in other areas that boosted my armor durability, weapons durability, some perks that allowed me less damage with AP boost in certain situations. 
---
My build was meant for massive melee power, with strong ballistic rifle capability at medium to close range.
---
Here’s where I noticed my issues: I went out on a patrol, north of Top of The World. I followed the highway. I came upon a low level player and added them to my team. I believe they were a level eleven or fourteen. I was hitting the little spots to grab scraps along the highway. I started noticing that my rifles seemed weaker when I expended an entire magazine into one Level fifty gusty at one of the old raider checkpoints along that highway. The one with the tinker bench. I finally shot all of those gutsys but I used a lot of ammo. More than usual. I continued along the highway, hitting the small off road places along the run. Each place there was what seemed more damage resistance than before with each enemy. I remember feeling super frustrated with the situation because my perks were set right. I had the right body armor. I was well fed. I don’t use combat chems unless I’m doing some challenge like the schorchbeast Queen event, so that wasn’t a factor. My weapons were not as effective. So *something* is different, and I admit that it may not be the weapons, but some other thing that I’m unaware of. Whatever it is, it has rendered my weapons frustrating to the point of uselessnes, and I’m once again frustrated with the game.
---
I really like the notion of this game and I feel that it has potential to be a brilliant title, but it has been handled incorrectly by someone and now we have this buggy pay to win feeble game that is unreliable and has no engaging story to carry the weight of its flaws. I want the game to be good, because so have a friend that I enjoy playing it with, and I’m really disappointed that I will not be able to speak with him while we use our console controllers to do endless inventory management peppered with grinding patrols to scour for junk, with the occasional fight with an AI enemy.
---
I’d also like to add that I’m not a guy, and that reddit is not my job or my entire life, so I don’t really care about the mass downvoting by the fanboys that populate this sub. You should know that people no longer come here for valid information, or to freely discuss Fallout 76. We know we will be filtered and suppressed. The only ones that are left here are either bEthesda employees, beta tester chucklefucks, and various others that are suffering confirmation bias issues regarding the game and their investment of either time or money into it. So that’s one more sour flavor from this game universe that is actively repelling myself and others.
---
So that’s been said. Downvote me to hell. No fucks. 💆🏼‍♀️💅🏻
---
All my friends are gone....none of them are active anymore after this update.  I guess it's time to call it quits :(
---
Yeah, but some people went into FO76 expecting it to be at least somewhat similar to FO4, only to be sorely disappointed.
---
Premium ass pounding membership! Love this guy!
---
i can confirm that i not had 1lb of junk in my normal stash after loosing everything.
---
what people dont get is that we are paying for a private server hosted Bethesda. plus you get a lot of stuff on top of that
---
If them adding Premium to a videogame fucks your life over so much, then you might have to reconsider your life choices.
---
Ive not been on since I heard about this, normally I play most days but at the moment I refuse to be fucked over... Again.
---
You can't apply that to a subscription that costs more than the game itself that adds Pay For Comodity and gives you a few V-Bucks and Discounts. Saying that you didn't participate could apply to the game, as it was better than i expected when i played the free week, but you can't apply that to a microtransaction. 
---
The only microtransaction i have ever bought was skins back on Minecraft for the 360 in 2012, that's it. By principle, until it is brought down to something like 5 bucks and the game itself is in a good state, i will never even consider buying it.
---
wow, truly amazing.
---
Good for you then, Im honestly glad you are happy with your 100€ subscription; for me its too much of a bad move at the moment. Im waiting for wastelanders and see then
---
Bethesda are a joke. They've let their fans down massively with this game and now are saying NPCs will be in next year. There targeting vulnerable people with the micro transactions and now this...
---
Thats fine and understandable, everybody is entitled to an opinion if you want to spend money on a product thats up to you and i myself would never stop or try to defer anybody from what they want to do. I say good on you for sticking with fallout76 if you enjoy it :) 
---
All the criticism and back peddling and controvery around fallout76 would put anybody off in my opinion. (Canvas bag, helmet etc etc) 
---
I liked fallout 3, new vegas and fallout 4 and i hope one day fallout franchise will return to its former glory.
---
Well, it's 'Included with Game Pass', it's not really free per se.
---
Keep in mind you need Windows 10 to participate in GP.
---
Fucking big dick move. I hope bethesda offers money for the domain and doesn't just threaten the dude who bought it
---
I totally agree.  People want to believe Bethesda can have no good intention behind any move. They believe greed is the only motive. Especially people who feel like they’ve been “left behind” because *they* abandoned the game in its infancy. For a lot of gamers “nothing is good enough”. It seems like a lot of gamers are a breeding ground for the off adages about remembering the few negatives done to you while ignoring the mass of positives by the same entity. Bethesda has not always made the right moves, with us, with Obsidian, etc, at the end of the day Zenimax is an “evil” corporation, sure. A few things that hold true are these; 76 is the best looking Fallout game of all time, 76 was BGS first time doing something like an MMO and Zenis 2nd, 76 has at least 200 hours of 100% INCLUDED w base game content if you take it seriously in its current incarnation (just ask any high level their hour count), we haven’t even seen all that Wastelanders will bring, 76 has nothing you can purchase that gives you an advantage over other players - it ISN’T a PVP title - advantage doesn’t exist, 76 hasn’t even been around a year yet and almost any big online game has problems in its first years, lastly, and related to my point about the negatives being focused on - what about what Bethesda HAS delivered on? 
---
Unpopular opinion - this is the best Bethesda-made Fallout game. There is are more hours to sink in side missions and freeroaming than 3 or 4 and we don’t even have a proper story mode yet. Bethesda was never king of Fallout, Obsidian made the peak of 3D Fallout with New Vegas, Black Isle made Fallout 2, a masterpiece, 76 is their chance imho. Just let this game mature properly, let people support what they like and don’t downvote or hate on people because of features you don’t use. Those of us that support games we like with our wallets don’t care that you hate a feature you hardly ever, if ever at all, use. Don’t worry about our pockets.
---
Oh that sucks, yeah going to go through my list tonight after work and only keep my PKOA friend might kick my wife off that list nah just kidding. I hope they fix it might see if there is a ticket in for it or maybe im doing something wrong only had a couple hours last night and spent most of it trading with other players.
---
yes and giving all the first day 1st purchasers like 1000 atoms and we all good \^\^
---
I havent played in over a month
---
I don’t give a shit bud. How does this whole thing affect your life? Getting upset because somebody hit your mother? Yeah, should get pissed off. A big company lied to you? Welcome to the real world kid. If you get this untangled over a video, you need to grow up.
---
please do. you can always find me here, in this sub. the other files are your usual BA2 and can be opened in the Fo4 CK. but not that one. I don't even know what it is, specifically.
---
I would probably receive a C&amp;D - I doubt I'll get an army of lawyers on my ass - it would be in the same category as emulation - since there is no subscription for FO76 base game there is no legal claim for them to say they lost money (since the player would still need to buy the game, not going to circumvent that)
---
Think about it this way. If a bundle came along on atomic shop for the ranger costume plus 1600 atoms I think a lot of us would pay 13.90 for just that
---
Meh, Wastelanders look more and more like payed dlc with "bonus" for subscribers that will get it for "free"
---
At some point, "I told you so" seems appropriate. This is that point
---
PAYING for single player service? NO THANK YOU!
---
This game has been a train wreck for a year, and now the final blow, having to pay for what was historically in the game itself? Nope
---
Yeah people are buying it, like throwing your money to twich girls; what can I say, its what we deserve; like democracy
---
I commend you for actually thinking about it &amp; not jumping on the hate train. 
---
I did buy a year's subscription as I play a lot with my son &amp; I know we would enjoy some aspects of the game without anyone else being there. I unfortunately spend half the year away at work &amp; fallout is something that we can do together even when I'm away at work(after my 12 hour shift anyway)
---
That's the #1 reason I got it.
---
Is it balanced the way it's been done,  probably not, the atom bonus isn't a big thing for me as most of it is still way too expensive for what it actually is. That might sound strange coming from someone who just purchased this, but at less than 50 cents per day, if purchased for the year - i consider it cheap. 
---
I have also put in about 1400 hours into this game &amp; even though I have purchased other games like red dead redemption, I haven't played them yet as I am happy just playing this game warts &amp; all.
---
Lately I have been a little bored, but now I'll be able to easily level up my alt by taking all workshops &amp; just keep defending them. It's actually something new I can do that I haven't done for ages as I'm not a PvP er.
---
Is that the only benefit? Not getting shot at a workshop? Single player? Wow
---
I played ESO. It wasn't surprise me to see monthly fee. I assume future dlc's will be free to play subscribers. Of corse wastelanders will be free. If not there will be no base gameto play for basic players. I guess payed dlc's will have some kind of dungeons or new area to play with new quests. Quests will give loots exclusive to dlc owners that can be sold to others or exclusive drops in that zone. Even some kind of perks only usable by dlc ovners. Buckle up and be ready. It is gonna be long ride.
---
Scrap kits are totally stupid lol and pointless if your stash is already full. 
---
Scrap box on the other hand..
---
it's disingenuous though, to call a premium subscription service "private servers". it's just even more PR bs.
---
and if the game is not ready to be ran locally or even modded that's because they made it so. the game is essentially the same as Fo4.
---
Thank you for fuming on my behalf.
---
Could you tell me *why* you're fuming though?  Just because someone is selling something doesn't mean I have to buy it.
---
yes, let this game burn and lets watch it from afar unless they put the fire out and stop being stupid.
---
"Remember, its not how the game launch its what its become later on"
---
\-Todd Coward
---
Serves you right for giving in to Bethesda's greed.
---
Played for several hours on my Private World with people who don’t have 1st. Took the Munitions plant, helped my s.o start the Free States Quest, and just generally ran around.
---
I think it support publisher more than obsidian
---
It wont even load. Figured.
---
Why? Why do you care how people spend their money?
---
\&gt; Pretty sure CPUs aren't fueled by bananas.
---
No, they're "fueled" by electricity. But you could've just say no.
---
\&gt; Single player games only.
---
Re-read the original quote, my reply to it, and think really really hard. I know you can.
---
\&gt; If you don't understand it, then you just prove me right.
---
See the reply above.
---
&gt;later is gonna be things like the robot and the fridge behind a 100€ paywall, thx but no
---
And again, you just make assumptions and then draw conclusions like it was facts.
---
I did it. my justification was the 1600 atoms. i would've bought to get some of the sales stuff anyway. and i'll cancel before the months end. many people will cancel when they realise just how dull your own world game is... and the the price will drop in a big way. so it's an extra 6 buvcks on what i would have spent anyway.. woopty do dah.
---
Not so bad then really.
---
I've read that you keep the scrap box, but you can't add more to it. You can use what you've put in it fuel g your subscription but once it's empty it's useless.
---
Like considering how expensive everything else is in Oz $22 is pretty good, we could be trying to buy petrol or something...
---
I'm not sure you're allowed to have your own opinion if it doesn't match the majority.  Please reconsider.  Think of the children.
---
Im sure its a nice feature but I dont wanna try it thx
---
The outer worlds are single player?
---
Again. If you said no to Bethesda, you could get more playtime out of the game, more enjoyment, for nothing more than what you paid for the buy the game itself. 
---
Everyone who defends it says "It's my money", and it's a stupid way to spend that money, 15 bucks a month for cosmetics and conveniency that could be earned for free for everyone if the developer (more like the marketing team) was put in place. 
---
I don't know how this mob mentality to defend microtransactions started, but it's spreading to every single franchise there is, you could get literally a better product if you just decided to not spend money on something that nets you so little.
---
That page is so tastefully put together. It is like hearing what Todd Howard is thinking when he steps out on stage for E3. lol.
---
Totally agree. The paid mods stuff in FO4 was always misleading. We had some great mods because people made them to sell through Bethesda. That's good for the modders. There were always hundreds or thousands of free ones too. What's not to like?!
---
The $100 a year unlimited stash though? Yeah that's BS. I'm not touching that.
---
Judging by the rest of our conversations in this thread - I'm not surprised.
---
This is the best thing since the Todd Howard "it just works" song
---
agree with 100%.
---
you should make a mainpost with this tbh. all the hate we feel in reddit these days is 100% unnessecary. its just a big shit show and not worthy for this community.
---
Yup.
---
its pretty much the definition of insurmountable, by time you reverse engeneered most of it no one would be interested in plkaying it
---
Whales don't care. They have daddy's credit card so daddy can keep screwing around with other women while mommy drinks 24/7. But atleast little Jimmy is happy and distracted.
---
What 100€ subscription?  I don't need to pay a 100€ subscription to play FO76.  Are you confused?
---
Please stop giving Bethesda money for this flaming pile of garbage guys
---
First glance - it's not a clear packages file, more akin to a database file or nosql style (indices at the end instead of a file list like a ba2), so would need to build a tool to extract/replace values.
---
I know, but one month of subscription might be worth it if I can keep the tent, atoms, emotes, outfit and whatever I've put in the scrap box.
---
itscmillertime it is simple, if enough morons will pay for that outrageus VIPaccoumt the whole gaming imdustry take notice and ruin their own future games with such crap.
---
DResist is useless by itself unless you have well over a 1000, which is not possible I don't think.
---
the bonuses from a bolstering set wouldn't be enough to keep you alive at 19% hp. if you pair it with sentinel or cavalier and marine/combat/scout sure. but unyielding is still better in most scenarios.
---
Lol I chase after them. They will take my free gifts and kindness, even if they don’t want them.
---
No, I'm enjoying playing it, I bought it and want to use something I purchased. 
---
I've no interest in NW PVP Atom store items, no end game, no nuke runs, no quests just like wandering about doing some stuff.
---
it was 25% from the original price like a week after release. thats when i bought.
---
Yeh I've noticed the majority of friends have slowly disappeared, I imagine soon no one will be on.
---
To be fair.. We communicated just fine. Our ideas were shared without hiccups. And yet here you are. Raging cunt in tow... Whats the fucking mystery? Just being a cunt for the luls?
---
Actually no that's not the only benefit, there are actually a few, buy a months membership and check it out and if anything u get a few things u get to keep if u dont renew.
---
Maybe it's because after they paid once they were given so little in the game.  The assets for a ton of items and outfits was already available (i.e. Fallout 4).  The only reason those things are not in the game is because they are gatekeeping them so they can trickle sell them to us over a long period of time at crazy prices.  So maybe that's why people are expecting a lot more to be free, but not really free, more like included in the empty game world they bought.
---
all the people lost their junk should get a free month.
---
I’ve gotten hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of this game. I will continue to get hundreds more whether I’m in a private server or public. Don’t tell me how to play my game.
---
$13 for something you don’t want is stupid to you, sure. I had hours of fun playing in my world today. Again, don’t tell me how to have fun in my game.
---
I’ve spent lots of money getting skins for PA, the Pip Boy, CAMP stuff, etc because I like them and think they look nice. Don’t tell me how to have fun using what disposable income I have after all my bills are paid.
---
That's pretty much what I was wondering about.. preliminary research did show that a lot of done client side, npc and item spawning and such however is definitely on the server.
---
Boycott EA first pls
---
Doing away with the player economy and vending system for everyone else too. Who’s ready for rock bottom prices because everything is now worthless!
---
Yeh I'm off into space tomorrow.
---
Oh really that is very cool then, thanks for the info
---
Loaded fine for me? Internet issues?
---
almost the same game, true they use the same game engine for the most part. but this is modified to do multiplayer. which is not ready for mods.
---
Bethesda has said that they will eventually support this. but its just not ready yet.
---
Why would you even give them one month of revenue
---
It’s great with the Halloween vendors that play spooky music and the bat noises from the machine. Love it.
---
Im pretty sure it would be like that, screenshot it if you want, I know its an assumption; but they said they realized people loved utility items in the atom store, of course we do; how not. And right now there are advantages which you still deny, and divert the discussion somewhere else; I think you are a troll
---
You honestly in my opinion got what you paid for. I don't understand how you can pay Bethesda for a subscription. Seriously... I don't understand. I would rather give a random homeless dude 100$ than pay for this... thing.
---
Honestly I see them just ignoring it
---
\*Because they expected it to be profitable.  
---
They might not be so sure today...
---
forgive me as this is not my area, but how did you reach that conclusion? where can I get more information or maybe start learning how to unpack files myself?
---
where would you start from, personally? trying to unpack the files that is?
---
It's called shilling. There are people who are paid to basically pretend to be happy satisfied customers. So that if some onlooker who doesn't know what is going on looks at it, they see some distortion of reality. The thing is those people will be looking at the main page and the posts getting literally thousands of upvotes. That's where the reality is.
---
Someone will still pay for that, even if you do it all yourself time have value.
---
Ok 12€ per month
---
Infinite junk = infinite crafting 
---
Don’t you see the implications this has on the WHOLE player economy, premium sub or not?
---
Best thing in existence, At this point I am pretty sure the game is now dead.  
---
Seriously it was just starting to get a following, the bugs where getting patched and we had a halloween event up and coming with promised since launch features coming to the game.  
---
then they pull the fallout 1st thing and stab their community in the back. To the point a lot of die hards who have stuck through this are quitting.
---
No you dont have to buy anything correct, I just hate the way games are going nowadays, broken on release and loaded with mtx or some sort of gambling mechanics. It upsets me seeing games now the way they are. Fallout 76 is nearly a year old and after all its controversy i feel annoyed for its playerbase at how unfair they have been treated. I loved playing fallout as i said before. 
---
the outer worlds looks like a brilliant game and i cant wait to pick it up later.
---
Its happenening all over not just nuke zone. I was fighting a 1* scorchbeast between the forest and whitesprings. I clicked to vats for my mini gattling 1. It read as 0 dammage event tho i was hitting it. 2. My ap didnt refill. So grabbed my meelee once the fker landed.
---
&gt; If it’s your first time playing it, it’s not bad really and actually has good story telling given the restrictions they placed on themselves.
---
Man the amount of mental abuse you must have suffered to think this is true
---
Yes I’ve bought loads but haven’t for the last 2 months. Dailies have become easier to get and finish off all my other Atom challenges.
---
AFAIK he did not 'hack' the domain, he purchased it so i'm not sure where that leaves him with regards to the domain itself.
---
 Pete Hines need to be fired from Bethesda. He is PR guy and making the game company look bad.
---
So, like this [http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
Or
---
[http://falloutfirst.com/](http://falloutfirst.com/) 
---
Or 
---
[This](http://falloutfirst.com/) ?
---
Just to cover all the bases?
---
Sometimes it looks like my gear is slow to load.  
---
I'm really, really prepared, and normally, upon being hit by a ghoul, I get almost no HP damage and the only concern are rads.  
---
So I log in and went for One Violent Night. I haven't noticed anything off with damage because it was already populated so I was using tesla to tag yet not one-shot mobs. And then one of them gets near me and literally one-shots me. I'm like WTF, then respawn and return, get to a ghoul again, and again, one-shot.  
---
I'm now seriously puzzled hence I try again, and after third try, the ghouls have normally did their zero damage and I could chill out while tanking them.  
---
Yesterday I logged in with my level 250 character and it disallowed me to change any guns because it said I am level 1. This went on for a minute, then my levels and special loaded again. It was interesting because it has shown my special with all cards spent, yet with locks on them (just like you would unlock a perk card from perk card pack, and couldn't use it yet because of low level and its higher level requirement).
---
Golden!
---
I know the concept of shilling, but it always sounded like some tin foil hat conspiracy, but the more i see games like Breakpoint and 76 the more i honestly start to believe it.
---
yes sir BGS tming could had been better for us, not long to wait to play a new game
---
Well fo76 keeps causing the release of free content like this, guess that's one positive
---
This is fantastic hahahaha. It puts the point across so perfectly, I'm sad to say I've lost all interest in F76 for all the shitty fuckups and Pay2win bullshit I won't be returning any time soon. It's a shame as it had so much potential 😪
---
If you have a little spare cash, you can build factories in space right now. There is a game called Satisfactory, like Factorio but in a beautiful 3d environment. I'm so happy I found it so that's why I have been recommending it to people. Not a full price AAA game. It's actually early access and very reasonably priced. And as an early access game, it is filled with content, and just got a new update with trains and nuclear energy.
---
Why are you even here, you made your decision, this post is no different to shouting...
---
LOOK AT ME!!!
---
Yeah time for a new pc m8 😉
---
I am surprised you mentioned it like it is some kind of bold statement.
---
My 2 cents on how it probably works:
---
Private servers were created from snapshots of existing public servers, that's why you see what you see, i.e. not a fully stocked world. Further on, your account is marked as persistent to that particular snapshot/VM, so you are always "routed" to it when choosing to play on a private server.
---
I might be wrong in small details, but pretty sure that's how it's setup.
---
Hey, I'll have a look. Appreciate the reply. 👍👌
---
Well thats the same studio that came with Far Harbor and Oblivion
---
Same, this and Anthem.
---
Why? It’s a huge success overall, half of my friend list is using private servers
---
If you want to, sure. Have fun playing whatever you decide to play next.
---
what goodwill that shit went out the window about 5 patches ago, with this is just adding salt to the wound.
---
I don't remember where but somewhere in this sub is a thread that talks about how there are targets that you have to hit before storage containers in the game world reset.  Like if you loot 100 containers (I made this up, I don't remember the actual number) then the oldest containers will reset one by one as you go.  But until you do, those containers will stay empty no matter how much time has passed.  No idea if this is how it works, just what I read.
---
You can also bring in financial arguments.
---
1) Prices for this (AA) game dropped within weeks from full-priced premium 60$ to half or even less. Later you got a additional free copy if you bought FO76 in a bundle with PS4 IIRC. The market is saturated and other great RPG games (The Outer Worlds, Cyberpunk 2077, ...) will be released in the very near future - so no more income from selling copies of FO76.
---
2) Players can earn the in-game currency/Atoms for free - and do not have to spend money.
---
3) There is still a lot of development ongoing for the free DLCs. Bethesda promised that every DLC and content update will be free - for years to come.
---
4) Microtransactions (selling Atoms) are just one-time income events. So it is difficult for Bethesda (and their shareholders) to make a budget, predict profits, distribute resources, etc.
---
5) The game is for sure not as profitable as other battle royal styled games, where they sell only cosmetic items. Fallout fans have not bought this game because of the BR mode. And I'm sure BR fans have "better" games to play with.
---
So it was obvious that they had implemented this subscription to pay the bills. If there are not enough subscribers (not enough revenue), they have to make the base game free to play - to increase the customer (not player) base.
---
I also fear that they will implement payed mods like the CreationClub later on. Since the servers are hosted by Bethesda, it might not even be possible to use mods created by the community.
---
There is a joker meme for this
---
I PvP on adventure all the time.
---
“On top of that, they are giving away a bunch of stuff. The cosmetics are great! Admit it...”
---
You get an outfit, some icons, emotes, infinite junk, and a tent... for £11.99... for that much I could watch everything on Netflix on 4 screens, or on Elder Scrolls Online, Dye all my outfits, access any unpaid DLC content, get a free statue, craft bag, double bank space, double furniture limit, double transmutation crystals and exclusive deals and 1650 Crowns on. Hell I can even have my own realm on Minecraft, with mods, without shutting down on everyone else when I’m not there for 2 months!(£5.59pm) so we’re not exactly getting our money’s worth with Fallout 1st and it certainly doesn’t deserve any lenience or treated like an equal to any other subscription...
---
Yeah they like to make it look like if you say anything you are just paranoid and crazy, but it does happen and there is a lot of evidence for it. Some investigative journalism has uncovered reddit manipulation also in a YouTube piece called  [Reddit For Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SAkUs3urrg).
---
Why do you so desperately want to tell other people how to spend their money?
---
Took a year of lies, failures, delays and lack of communication to dwindle the good will down to the bone. The whales are still feverishly buying the broken premium subscription model though, which seems to be enveloped in issues surrounding disappearing junk from the scrap box. Can’t make it up!
---
God forbid someone use correct Grammer, the horror! 
---
Well played Sir!
---
Screw Bungie they're even more money hungry than Bethesda....
---
Ok thank you
---
900 atoms
---
I think they did do somethings right.  The game was addictive to me and I played it a lot.  So they got that part right, I begrudgingly admit I had fun.
---
I uninstalled a while back in disgust over their greed.
---
I paid £16 to play FO76 one off payment, what is everyone on about?
---
No worries - conclusion based on first glance through the file itself, header, markers, reserved spaces in the top 1024 bytes (room for incremental numbers), markers like ('FGK' or 46 47 4b) show up a lot and most likely the table marker. 
---
Where would I start if I want to reverse engineer this into a tool? Start really scanning the file, find the disassembly code in FO76 that read/writes this file and write my own structs/code to read it. Though who knows, beth might be using 3rd party software to read/write to the database and that might be readily available.
---
Yeah so it's not terrible, like if you need atoms, might as well buy a month of 1st then everything else is bonus. Just have to gather junk like mad so that you can use it at the end of your subscription.
---
But if the tent is locked behind a pay wall, then I'm not interested.
---
 *looks around for people spending money in Fallout 76 encouraging Bethesda to be more and more bullshit with their monetization including pay to win stuff*
---
Okay champ
---
That’s fair. But it’s been a year. People know, or should know, what kind of game 76 is by now. 
---
OP says the outer worlds gave people a reason to quit playing fallout 76. My point is that if you are STILL playing 76 and just butt hurt that it isn’t a single player game, you are doing it wrong. It’s fun as a co-op game with friends.
---
If you wanted a single player rpg, fallout 76 gave enough reasons by itself to quit playing fallout 76.
---
Don't give a fuck.
---
The only people on this sub who defend are whales who have to seek validation for their poor impulse control and money management skills.
---
Because i desperately want this game to be better and supporting one of the worst monetization systems this decade has ever seen only makes it worse.
---
That’s what I ultimately want to figure out. Because if in any way the private servers are different than standard adventure mode servers then this service isn’t for me
---
Too early to say. Loads of people will have rushed into buying Fallout 1st if only for the cosmetic benefits and I would guess many of those will cancel after that first month as they get to keep the cosmetics and get those extra Atoms - in those terms it’s not a bad deal if you’re into this.
---
The real impact of all this won’t be seen for 2-3 months when subscriber count becomes a thing by which time Wastelanders will launch, it’s clever timing and I’d bet that the financial success or failure of Fallout 1st will determine whether Wastelanders gets shoved behind that subscription paywall or not - these decisions are not accidental, they are based on financial planning, and based on the trajectory of how this game is being increasingly monetised over its first year you can bet the second year will be worse so further paywalls should not surprise anybody at this point.
---
Omg but why do you guys pay ?!!! You're giving them power and legitimise their despicable practises. You're part of the problem.
---
&gt;I know its an assumption; 
---
Indeed.
---
No problem. It's not for everyone, but if you like the idea of gathering resources and building factories to produce stuff the progression system is pretty nice. And the graphics and automation is nice. I'm also going to enjoy Outer Worlds tomorrow.  👍
---
Activision* 🙃
---
If it gives you an advantage it should have been free all along! Haha.
---
Yes, because video game boycotts actually work. /s
---
I can give you some plans and stuff to get you started if you like, also on Xbox.
---
I wouldn't ask a penny for it - if I did that would be in such grey legality area.
---
Nobody who plays the game is a freeloader. It's not a f2p game. Understandable mistake given recent events.
---
What part of it is F2P?
---
I really wanted to like this game, but it's been a lesson in doing literally everything completely wrong.
---
I have stood with this game since beta. When everyone was calling me a shill, a fanboy and who knows what else, i stood by this game. 
---
When everyone wanted refunds and complained because things weren't the way they liked them to be, i stood by this game. 
---
But this... this has finally gone too far for me. After everything the playerbase had to go through in the game's development after launch? 
---
After every dirty lie the company told the playerbase? 
---
No. I am done. I have stood by this game through thick and thin and i am done with the bullcrap. 
---
I don't want to join the whole cringy bandwagon of "game bad, game ded lmao" but i have had it with this.
---
After standing with the fame gor so long *just* to be backstabbed like this? This game is dead to me
---
I can relate :(
---
I bought one bundle for E3 and never again.
---
&gt;they are gatekeeping them so they can trickle sell them to us over a long period of time at crazy prices
---
Then don't buy them.
---
&gt; more like included in the empty game world they bought. 
---
Then don't play it.
---
I'd like to see a metric of complaints vs age group. I'm a well employed adult and the idea of a monthly fee under 20 bucks for something that gives me hours of entertainment is fine by me.  I pay almost 200 USD a month for cable, this is nothing? Why so much anger?
---
This was a good read
---
F
---
He took the words out of my mouth.
---
I'm from UK, the monthly sub is £11.99 which equals to roughly $15 US dollar's.
---
I'm not fussed about having a private server, was never on my list of things I wanted from this game unlike most.
---
If anything I'd cancel after my first month too, is it fairly easy to do? I'm on ps4 so I'll have to see how it's bought on there n whether I'd need to put some money on the ps4 or is it separate
---
Ok, well if you remember this thread in a months time, please let me know if you keep the tent!
---
I play 10 hrs per day. For me it resembles ark. Except you dont have dinos trying to kill you every moment. I enjoy the exploration. In unknowing what ill see or what will be waiting for me when i enter into a map location.
---
Wanting the game to be better is very subjective. You want it to be better for you. I’m sure there’s plenty of people who have bought fallout 1st thinking the game is a lot better now
---
Thx for pointing out how smart I am 16 INT, goodbye troll go playing the game nab you have lots of things to do
---
Originally called anchor-adjustment by Tversky and Kahnehan.  Applications include Anchoring, as well as Door-in-the-face (big to small request, foot-in-the-door is a compliance technique where you go small to big.  Arguably both were done here...)
---
Server lives approximately 5 minutes when totally empty to allow you rejoining in case of ctd or if you need to swap character, it’s actually great as you can easily transfer items between them with minimal risk of losing it and without middle man.
---
Turning someone’s $60 product into a door stop unless they pay $100 a year, after going free to play, isn’t a good idea in any sense. It’s just flat out extortion. The game would die if it went F2P
---
Those poor bastards are probably like "*FFS guys no! I've got to deal with this shit on social media! Fucking thanks!*"
---
Nope. It’s a move to take money out of the pockets of people who would have used it to buy The Outer Worlds.
---
Theres a reason they did this just before its launch
---
This why the triple A gaming industry is in its current state.
---
It's F2P with microtransactions once you paid for it obviously :D
---
Brilliant!
---
Is this speculation or have you found confirmation? I think you're right but I want to know for sure.
---
How does it ruin this game? Did they change something in adventure mode that I am missing?
---
I'm done with it. Waiting for Red Dead.
---
I changed The position of CAMP, but kept the same layout.. It was ready in blueprint.. . Thanks God...
---
Pay to win or pay to play single player? Really ur not in competition with other players so who are u winning agaisnt? How many players love mods and not just the ones that change cosmetics,  we mod to make us gods and i dont see any difference here besides i have to pay. Really to me this is more a pay to play single player or multiplayer privately or publicly. If u u look at what u get its not that bad, 16.50 worth of atoms each month is not bad, add that to the atoms u earn and u could have a lot of cool stuff. Scrap box thats really cool and the tent is very cool. I joined the game only 3 months ago so i did not pay 60.00 for the game or have to deal with all that the first players had to deal with and honestly that does suck for them. Since i have started playing i have had only a couple miner issues and i play a lot. I really enjoy the game so much i bought another ps4 for my wife to play with me and we have a lot of fun.
---
Im not hype at all for either of those games not gonna lie.
---
Yep. Playing the game for the story is still worth it. Unfortunately any endgame now feels unrewarding  because  I'd feel like a second class citizen without paying for the subscription. It sad, becasue they were finally and slowly fixing the endgame. Adding more stuff to do... and now this.

---
Didn't think of that, but if they do implement that as a requirement, I personally will no longer play and just keep playing FO4. Bad enough they took roughly 6 months longer to put out the display stuff, and now the NPCs aren't coming until 2020. 
---
I paid the $40 for the DLC stuff for FO4, just like I have for countless COD games, The Division 1 &amp; 2, Hitman, etc, but refuse to pay $100 a year. Hell, the PS Now subscription is only $100 a year and you get access to 100s of games to play. Not to mention, most of what you get I don't care about. I don't have stash space issues, I have plenty of caps to fast travel, and I log in 1-2 times a week and do the weekly challenges and maybe a few dailies and still have over 1500 atoms after buying anything I want.
---
thank you for your help. one last thing, what would you guess is being stored inside of it? I'm looking through the BA2s and most meshes are there. can't say I've found them all, though.
---
it's also an arguably large file, 1.4 gigs.
---
The title suggests otherwise, but if that’s the case, he’ll probably just get a C&amp;D and that’ll be the end of it.
---
It worked!!! Tks
---
I’m just saying that you will pay for that and if you will get a lot of people joining you will need to buy servers or say sorry guys server full try tomorrow
---
It's not subjective that the game still doesn't run well in server stability, lag and FPS. It's not subjective that cool items or mechanics could be implemented for free through playing the actual game. It literally took me less than a minute to think of how to make quests for the items i listed above, and you're telling me nobody in that office on the day they locked onto what to put in Fallout 1st they thought of what i thought up?
---
That makes zero sense
---
Thank you, this is the much more sweet and to the point of the long winded sentiment I just posted
---
I only played a couple hours last night and the tent is really cool, hate to lose it
---
HA HA HA HA! LOVE IT!
---
Im dying hahahahahahahhaha
---
That's what I mean, even if they approach him and go "we'll give you cash for the domain" they'll report him
---
Based on what? Where are you getting this from?
---
I read it in the BGS explanation of the services. I will go back and look for the link to it
---
Bethesda keeps shafting players and holy shit, there are still people out there (and here) who are taking it. Talk about an abusive relationship!
---
I agree with all of these. Can we have it so we have to pay $100 a year for this bullshit? Is there any way to make it cost extra? I'd prefer to just give Todd my credit card details correctly and he can decide how much we wants to fuck his player base today
---
Oh Im talking about the subscription to be premium, sorry I think I misread; Im enjoying my anger
---
16 for the game its a good price, enjoy it! Im at endgame with a collection of good weapons and I have nothing to do until they give us more stash limit or until they implement wastelanders; my fault sorry again, I defended the game since launch its a good game and you gonna love it but Im just full of loot and have nothing to do so this subscription thing is a bad move by Bethesta 
---
As I said enjoy it!
---
If i'm to take a guess - geometry, line of sight and pathfinding?
---
not only story but better and deeper RPG systems compared to the likes of 4 and 76.
---
I must say I'm not surprised. I left the game a good half a year ago because of its outrages bugs and annoyances. My guess was that it would brake down and devs would see a lot more ppl leaving. 
---
I guess I was wrong about that. So from Bethesdas perspective:
---
If you have a community that is still that invested after releasing a broken game, nerfing it with patches increasing the   grind without really fixing the core issues... why not milk them further with a subscription service? 
---
It will probably work - a lot of players are complaining now but there will be still enough ready to throw their money at Bethesda. And that leaves a very bitter taste for upcoming games in the future. 
---
Maybe they will also release a bug free version for the ultimate platinum service costing only 30$ / month?
---
If they are from different sources, they are multiplicative. If the number of the same source itself changes directly, e.g. perk card upgrade, it's additive. Generally applies to everything in the game. Also capped at 90%
---
Although what the guys here say about private sessions makes more sense, as it's a more cost effective solution.
---
Hell no and thats all ill have to say.
---
no im not mad at ppl im mad at this company.
---
you cant really compare this to netflix. seriously.
---
Second, how many years have ESO been running? i remember the paid subscription for that game in the beginning had no free DLC attached to.
---
Upvote!!
---
It's bullshit, BTW.
---
Well it surely looks like learning to speak proper English is on top of the list of things that you have to do.
---
Ahhh a fellow chump! My butt still hurts after that one.
---
I don't mind being nervous when I out in the wasteland. It makes it more interesting. I'm more alert in 'bear country' and just run when I see one and I'm out of armour. Ghouls and some insects seem tougher too. For the first time in forever I was recently slaughtered by a bunch of level 50 bloodbugs. Keeps me on my toes. I'd been getting complacent.
---
Thats what i was told, im on ps4 and i put all my junk except stable flux in there last night and this morning it was still in there so not sure maybe its platform specific?
---
That's the thing - the server software would be downloadable and you can run it yourself or or own your dedicated hosting, might need a master server for server lists that want to be more public but it's a run your own.
---
Because it could have been added as quest reward but it is not.
---
After Borderlands 3 was buggy disaster too, that is refreshing to hear.
---
You would have rather they release unfinished DLC?
---
Its just a hunch of old gamer, many were comparing that sub to ESO. Just think about it -  sub rage will fall down before wastelanders and then they come out with news of new huge dlc for mere 40 bucks but wait! Its "free" if you have subscription!
---
Thanks, it should have just been a quest reward from wastelanders, then buy 800 atom skins from the atomic store. 
---
That way both the players and the Investors would be happy.
---
If it costs 100 a month for a tent then they can fuck right off.
---
That's not how that works.
---
OMG there are still a few level headed adults on Reddit. Op is welcome on my private server anytime! At least over the next 12 months.
---
You pay real world money for fake in game atoms, how does that “pay back for the 100 dollars you “”invested””? 
---
Atoms are not real, they have no real world value, Bethesda make up how much atoms are worth. Please don’t tell me you’re an adult man arguing the case that $100 real world dollars is an investment in return for a made up, temporary, in game currency. I despair!
---
Why though? For having an optional service offered? How does this affect you? I’m genuinely curious.
---
Insanely hard to do
---
link is broken for me.
---
No, of course not. How can this be what you took away from my comment?
---
Why the fuck did you spend money on this game we all knew was trash at launch
---
Just slap some mods on it to fix all the bugs (Unofficial Patch) and what not, and youre good to go!
---
The thing is I don’t mind, the going rate on ARK SE servers was £30 for 3 months, so you could say £10 a month there or there about. So basically the £2 left over (if you wanna compare pricing for servers) is for all the cosmetic stuff I get and the atoms 
---
Its a great deal tbh.. 
---
(Ik I’m gonna get downvoted but just wanted to share my experience with buying a private server elsewhere)
---
I got 3 years of gamepass ultimate as I converted 36 months of gold/gamepass and will get another 2-3 years under microsoft rewards....fallout 76 is awful....
---
thats becuase its an instace not your own private server making the sub even more crazy, BGS is straigth up stealing ppls money.
---
It really is, that's exactly what it's like. It's like every abusive dating situation you've ever heard lol everyone needs to get out and meet other games asap
---
They literally keep referring to it as their “largest free expansion”. So I highly doubt it will not benfree.
---
\&gt; Say what you want about ESO, it's got 10x more content.
---
And "10x" is really an understatement. I'd add another zero.
---
Another player having an unlimited junk stash or a tent has zero affect on your game. Zero. You just want to pretend it does to have something to complain about.
---
I had a hunch it'd be something like that. hopefully at least all the cells are stored within the BA2s. but it wouldn't be as simple as just porting the assets over regardless.
---
let me know if you ever delve deeper into it. thanks again.
---
Its called standing up for yourself and using your power as one consumer to send a message. If you dont get pissed off when they take one inch dont be pissed off when you turn your back and they take a mile.
---
It wouldn't be about winning. Even a obvious winning case is really expensive for the winning party. It's scummy but their goal would be to scare him into taking it down or losing alot of money.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48688/~/scrapbox---fallout-1st---fallout-76
---
Overall my point is that I can spend 2-3 days on my own server, then go back to a shared server with my seemingly-endless supply of god tier items I keep dropping (got 2 more very good things since making my post!), my bobbleheads &amp; skill magazines and sell the 10,000s of 5.56 ammo I've been making.
---
Laughs in tricentennial...
---
Face it folks, money talks and Reddit BS walks. I'm going to keep buying dlc and subs every time they are available if I even remotely want them, just to piss you all off.
---
The poetic justice is palpable.
---
Polished? Fallout 76 update? Made by Bethesda? 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Console companies charge for secure servers, data management, dedicated servers (Xbox has half a million I believe) and many exclusive deals and discounts as well as integrated voice and social functions.
---
It’s not just to go online. It’s to pay for server hosting. $40 a year for 500,000 dedicated servers is not an inferior position to playing on PC, hardly an unreadable subscription price.
---
I bought Tricentennial in Canada, bigger dumbass checking in.
---
good with salt!! rage last 90% longer:D
---
Man you are all about the bad faith questions that you could answer by simply thinking hard. Dont forget your helmet on the way to the short bus.
---
I'll come back to this comment once they begin selling us perkcard loadouts, deal?
---
It is simple, they made issue like junk weight just to sell us solution earlier. So in fact it HURTED us since we need to pay for something which should be in base game. Same thing was before with guns durability and repair kits
---
And Blizzard. Hehe. Did you see that Hearthstone drama?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUnhFitsybo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUnhFitsybo)
---
Maybe. This reports are coming from PC
---
How so? I do not work for Bethesda. If these things happen, they stole my ideas.
---
It's telling me "The URL is unavailable on the live web,..."
---
He said we shouldn’t accept the game
---
Being delayed like they are getting away with something nefarious.
---
I was more concerned about the tent, that's just talking about the scrap box. Thanks anyway.
---
I'd like my refund of the original game now.
---
Pete and todd would be a good place to start the firings may as well get Emil in there too
---
Site not loading. Reddit hug kill it?
---
If you’re not rich and pissing $100 a year away on video game subscriptions you’re either a child or financially irresponsible. No other options available.
---
Since we had about 6 hours before the service was live I spent that time googling to make sure my 13 dollar monthly test run would be worth doing. The tent will go away if the service expires. The tent is part of being a member
---
Not buy Fallout 1st for Xmas?
---
I honestly don’t understand and it sounds like you don’t understand either seeing as you won’t answer why you are upset lol
---
Definitely. I'm sure I'll be playing lots of Mod Fallout 4 in the future!
---
It’s Karma
---
Unfortunately the responsiveness is unmatched and the gameplay quality is vastly higher
---
Stop trolling. You vocal minority are just that--the minority of the player base.
---
"People who don't agree with me are all incels"
---
Welp, that's one cringy comment.
---
It's always sad to see players getting fucked in the ass so hard that they end up defending the one doing the fucking.
---
Lol. They did not hurt gun durability before repair kits (which are useless btw)
---
Literally every coder does it. No reason to store an integer (in this case an unsigned integer) as a double or float if there's not going to be any fractional numbers since a double is twice the size and any math using floating point numbers is slower than math with integers. 
---
Unique items like guns and armor have a lot more data to keep track of. Level, condition, max condition, what mod is in each slot, what perks effect it, etc.  These items are likely stored as an instance of a class, which is going to be far larger and more difficult for the game to process than a simple 4 byte integer.
---
This game has huge potential.
---
Im just not educating you if you cant think critically.
---
Notice that you can't vote on the Bethesda patch post on Reddit FO76 front page? Basically silencing the players ability to protest.
---
I didn’t mention winning, my thought would be it gets thrown out?
---
So many people play Fifa with actual pay to win and gambling included, where are white knights to stop them? Give it a week and this fake outrage will get old and people that actually play fo76 will be back on this forum 😅
---
When you go into the wheel there is an icon next to the tent that says fallout 1st. That’s a benefit that goes with the membership
---
You kinda deserve this for buying this crap.
---
After they released player vendors I had a lot of fun farming mats, bulking and selling stuff in my vendor. I always sold out every day. Chems, stims, plans, bulked junk, misc armor &amp; weapons. 
---
But now with unlimited craft stash the backbone of my little 76 business is no longer viable. With private worlds and unlimited ballisic fiber and acid my playstyle is no longer needed in the wasteland.
---
The game is what you make of it.
---
This is in patch notes
---
Calm down, so what if I’m naive? I don’t particularly care about Bethesda but Fallout is my favourite franchise of games. 
---
I don’t see how you worked out that everything they’ve done up until now is milking the fallout fans, they’ve consistently listened to what would improve the game and added those features. 
---
ESO tanked when it first came out mainly because you had to buy the monthly subscription to play there was no option. They changed that to optional and now most long time players have that service but new people don’t need to sign up for it until they are sure they want it. 
---
If Bethesda were milking there fans they’d make the subscription compulsory. As with most things in the world it all comes down to money. It costs money to develop games and the base cost we paid isn’t going to go far they need a steady income to make more content just the same as we’d buy a Netflix or Prime subscription so they can get new content. 
---
I already know people that signed up yesterday for Fallout 1st not because they are naive but because they enjoy the game. 🤷‍♀️
---
Yeah I read this:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48687/~/survival-tent--fallout-1st---fallout-76
---
Says it's for fallout 1st members so I guess it goes when the subscription ends. Not gonna pay 100 a year just yet then!🖕
---
This isn't only real life, this is Bethesda.
---
Pretty sure the massive in MMO refers to the multiplayer population not world size. Otherwise Battlefield games are MMOs, call of duty war mode is an MMO.
---
Calling the previous incidents as a "kick in the teeth" is not right. On paper they sounded so (e.g. the Fridge or the Collectron), but in reality they were like a punch from a drunkard... that completely misses the target (us). Those were more laughable than concerning. 
---
But this event, the subscription service, it's a true kick in the teeth in my opinion. Locking two important gameplay features behind a paywall (recurring paywall) is a big NO in a game with a microtransaction store. As the other commenter says, even this is a bit overblown. People are angry for a lot of wrong reasons. Paid private servers are fine, a subscription service in concept is fine. It's just having the Scrapbox and a Tent locked behind it.
---
That tinfoil hat tight enough pal?
---
Haha your gf is teaching me sorry oh wait what did I say wrong btw? and I forgot to pay her we got distracted well no worries about money cŪck keep paying her meals like you do with Bethesta
---
They make it sound like they're offering you a good deal by giving you atoms higher than the value of the the sub, but when you think that atoms are worthless pretend money used to buy worthless pretend clothes and that they could have literally given you any value of atoms in the world to make it sound like a good deal it kinda stops being a good deal.
---
\- FSE (If keratus allows it) to hijack client to connect to different IP.  
---
\- All gameplay data is UDP stream, which can be captured.   
---
\- Client communication can be disassembled.  
---
\- Vivox ... I prolly won't do anything with. So no voice alas.  
---
\- Probably will include code that allows chatmod to work (if  Liyalai allows it)  
---
\- It would contain only really light anti-cheat detection (i.e. speed checks, health, ammo) and probably will contain a few flags to just allow that for those that want to be more ehh.. 'free' in their gameplay.
---
The hardest part is disassembling, finding opcodes and dealing with those, after that.. spawning NPC's and items.
---
&gt; completely abandoned some of their games after they failed to perform 
---
**One.** They "abandonded" **one** game, Mass Effect Andromeda, and that only after the base game was patched up to the State it should have been, they just didn't make the planned DLCs and turned the storyline into a Book instead.
---
The closest Game they have to F76 is Anthem, which also has many of the same problems, and they didn't abandon that either, atleast yet.
---
&gt; cancelled some of their games before they were done being made simply because they can't monetize it. 
---
Again, **one** game was cancelled, Viscerals Star-Wars Game, and not because they "couldn't monetize it", but because EA was unsatisfied with the State of the Demo they received and because they felt the Gameplay was too linear and too far removed from the current Marketplace-trends for SP-Games. Fallen Order literally has zero things they can monetize and the game still exists because it *does* follow those trends.
---
If you wanna shit on EA, atleast do it for real reasons.
---
of course the new feature makes you lose everything you put in there
---
its Bethesda tradition at this point
---
Or buy a pizza 🍕
---
Yo! Can you share the screenshots in like an imgur album or something? Site's down and the web.archive link says URL is unavailable on the live web. Much love
---
First of all *multiple* website hosting companies require you to give *all* your information just to sign up a website. Depending on which one he picked that info is public domain. Second of all you're drastically underestimating how expensive a dragged out legal battle can be and overestimating how much people would give. If Bethesda was so inclined they could drag this out for *years* hiking the costs into the seven figure range. Large companies like Bethesda have entire teams of lawyers on retainer for this very reason, and to ensure cases like this don't get immediately tossed out. Using a lawsuit as a way to silence someone is in fact *not* illegal, and in fact they would very likely require him to sign a gag order as part of any settlement. What will most likely come out of this is the owner will get a cease and desist letter along with a quiet offer to buy the domain. Done deal.
---
24 players is not MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER ONLINE, Call of Duty and Battlefield can have that many players, are they MMO?
---
So I subbed as well and played around with the craft box.
---
1. Used another persons Craftbox on a non-private server - saw my items fine.
---
2. Went back to mine and it was still all there.  
---
Only thing I didn't do was add an item to the other box.  I did notice you cannot add bulk , unblulk time.  At least I'll save on plastic now.
---
Narrator:  It happened.
---
Bethesda is about as threatened by Oblivion as much as their Oblivion IS threatening.
---
No it was two. Project ragtag and project orca.
---
kiddies think you cant play without sub anymore... cause you know.. those boneshards and woodscrap fills whole stash and game is totally unplayable just like yesterday.. oh wait why i could play yesterday without unlimited junk sytorage??? imposible
---
My opinion is they should've fixed the whole damn game a long time age, not make loyal customers that have put up with all the problems it's had for a year pay even more for the solutions to the problems. 
---
And I'll still keep playing almost every day because fallouts always been my favorite series. I just won't spend any more money on it just to have a server that doesn't crash or more stash space or whatever other bs they try to pull
---
Investing money in order to have a better result. Investing doesn’t mean to gain more money in this instance. That’s not the conversation I’m having. You are getting more out of the service by spending your money than if you wasn’t at all. We have to go on what atoms are worth by what Bethesda says because it it their currency. We all know the atom currency is priceless but that’s not the situation we are dealing with here.
---
This is exactly what they want from us: to buy the subscription because one of the things is this iconic fallout outfit. I feel like this was the only reason they added it.
---
Thanks for helping all of us figure out the way this system works
---
Standard Bethesda experience. Buyer beware.
---
Got me thinking about the old days when Warcraft came out. C&amp;C. Diablo. You got a demo that was amazing and it hooked you into the box price, and then a year or two later there’d be a significant expansion with new maps and units, and eventually a sequel with additional features, tools, new graphics tech, and they did the same thing over again and everything was just so... simple. And fun. 
---
I miss those days. I miss buying a game once and getting the whole game.
---
It sounds like you don’t understand your own outrage
---
I am more pissed that private servers a feature that was promised before launch, while they were also promising that all content releases to fallout 76 will be free forever, is now a feature i have to pay more for...
---
actually has me more pissed than the bag I looked at joining a class action lawsuit over.
---
I think this is the root of the issue, jealousy.
---
No, I started to play on PC just because I don't accept paying additionally for ability to play online on consoles, which for me is double taxing. Online play is integral part of some games and you have no choice to buy version with or without this feature. So on console I only play exclusive games that doesn't require any online subscriptions. Back to F76 - I think the price is too high for few features and items it offers and leaving Ranger outfit behind paywall (without possibility to get it for atoms) is quite irritating.
---
This argument is very short-sighted. No one's enjoyment or love of the game is being criticized. Bethesda's plans for the game and implied intentions thereof are what's under scrutiny. The cookie analogy is weak, tenuous at best here. This is a videogame not a snack. 
---
What are Bethesda's intentions with an unarguably high priced subscription service for this game? To fund extra features, further development and maintenance? Doubtful; games of higher quality with more content than this either don't charge subscriptions or have the content to back it up. This suggests the motivation for the subscription is profit.
---
But surely profit itself is not an unreasonable motivation for a corporation to have? Sure, but how does profit as a goal line up with other goals and motivations? I feel like if you ask most developers (speaking about the individual, not the company) about their drive for their jobs most would say they want to create a game people would enjoy, over wanting to make a profit. Considering the features Bethesda is offering for the subscription, this doesn't seem to be the case. None of the offered features require more funding to be implemented, and many would say these features should be part of the base game. 
---
Following this line of logic, we can say Bethesda is putting profit above the people they are making the game for. They are treating people as a means to the end of greater profit. And treating a person as only a means to an end is the definition of unethical.
---
So why get angry about it if you don't have to buy it? Because if it succeeds, it's going to tell Bethesda and other developers and publishers that they can get away with this. And if they believe that, there will be more of it. And if there is more of it, the average gamer won't be able to afford gaming any more. The industry will suffer.
---
TL;DR People are mad because Fallout First is unethical. And those funding this are enabling it. And enabling it means there will be more of it.
---
hes literally asking if you get the keep the item after one payment if you cancel i don't think hes showing them anything positive regrading a subscription model
---
Even then, they keep shutting down their own companies. At least bethesda tries to make the best of a bad situation as we’ve seen with the last few months.
---
Uhm Netflix is letting you watch hundreds of tv series and movies which if you rented individually would cost you about the same. Also don’t you think the history of ESO+ or any subscription service in a game, should be an example to Fallout 1st and what it needs be to compete against them? Why get Fallout 1st for the price that it is if very other game before it can still do better without being asked? If I was a game company and wanted to draw in more players as well as reward current ones with a subscription service, I’d at least try to give them something without putting words in their mouths or pretending to give a damn when it’s egregiously obvious about money and not the players. What happens when the players have all given up? No revenue. What happens when there’s no revenue? Investors pull out and what happens then? A game dies. Bethesda is lucky Fallout 76 didn’t die at launch, but they’re only burning bridges if they continue to behave that way. And as much as I’m aware that shareholding investors are the main culprit, they need more backbone. What they are offering isn’t worth the money or loyalty to excuse it. What they’re doing either by their own initiative or higher up’s is adding pressure onto Starfield and TES VI to be better than this, better than previous single player games, better than a few bugs at launch, there’s a picture at stake, not just “Fallout 76 is shit and I quit” but “Bethesda is suffering as whole and their method of handling that isn’t impressive or helping”
---
Blocked troll :)
---
Yeah no real answer why it became rent not free. They should have said additional shards cost money because of these factors.
---
also forgivenme for the tripple post, i’m a bit drunk and im trying my best to be coherent
---
Pick up Shell Shock?  It's hell on AP regen.
---
Not all people. Just anyone who has unreasonable and unrealistic expectations. 
---
Nothing has been taken away, something extra is given to those Willing to pay for it. 
---
Almost every game charges for private servers, which as someone who has actually tried it already works incredibly well. 
---
$8 a month is less than I was already spending in atoms monthly for about the same amount of atoms with the special bundle.
---
Every post of yours is complaining about the game but yet you still play..🤔
---
Can somebody explain to me how other people people bring able to add more to their personal experience affects you? 
---
If you don't like it, vote with your wallets. Other people are clearly doing it as well.
---
People like you are born every minute.
---
They can't report him for that if they are offering him cash first.   They can only report him if he came to them first.
---
I can't reach the site at all, not even a ping.
---
And the best way to tell them that you want it as a quest reward is to not buy it.
---
Well. It **NOW** is obviously pay2win. With the new subscription you get another C.A.M.P. (tent) for free (acts also another fast travel point for free). In addition you get a stash box, which let's you store an unlimited amount of junk.

You have access to private servers, where you can occupy every workshop, or farm bobbleheads, magazines, or other rare items. All without other players disturbing or challenging you. Afterwards you can switch to a public world harassing other players with your new gear or unlimited ammunition...or exploiting the economy, because private worlds let you collect unlimited junk.
---
Unlimited junk, unlimited access to all items (because no one else is looting anything, except you), unlimited caps, unlimited ammunition, ... this **IS pay2win**
---
So is it  http://falloutfirst.com/ or http://falloutfirst.com
---
They're getting what they deserve
---
Sure there will be many NCR Rangers. They will be the only ones left so the game will group them together.
---
Orca was, again, cancelled for completely different reasons. Mainly because the projected Development-time was too long and EA didn't want to spent that much time without a new Star Wars game.
---
Sports fans are kinda different demographic from gamers in general. Like I have been playing FPS, RPGs, MMOs, etc. for many years, but my brother only plays some sports games like Football Manager and Fifa etc. and hasn't played the number of games I have, or been through all of the years of MTX BS from all of the publishers. Gamers in general play many different types and genres of games. They have been through all of the shit game companies throw at them, and they have had enough which is reaching a tipping point the past few years. EA will be feeling it from their RPG audience with games like Anthem and Fallen Order, since Mass Effect Andromeda and Battlefront II. Fifa have a smaller resistance starting to grow.
---
BF2 does have Space Battles.....

***\*cough\****Fallout 76 existence was already a prove for that***\*cough\****
---
In the original 4chan post he claims that he was able to purchase the domain.
---
To be honest, anyone still willing to send money to Bethesda after all this deserves much worse than that. You people are the core problem. People still willing to get fucked more should definitely get fucked more.
---
looks like its taken down to be damage controlled
---
how are you attempting end game with 4 hours game play
---
Haha at the bargaining stage again? You shouldn't be outraged you didn't get a free year you should be outraged that this passed through the shareholders meeting.
---
I don’t want locally hosted servers, I want to play with others, friends and random. I have fallout 4 for modding and single player as you said it’s about the same, just play fallout 4.
---
All it takes is a cease and desist on trademark infringement and Bethesda gets the domain.
---
Link is broken
---
I just wanted to sit next to my partner and play Fallout or Skyrim together in the same game. Just the two of us, no randoms. 
---
Why was that so hard? Why’d they have to do all... this?
---
The sub didn't always defend the game. Half the sub defends almost everything and half critisises almost everything.
---
Unlimited stash for money though? That's fucking bullshit. Nobody is defending that.
---
Wont load for me either,  every other site I just tested does though
---
I didn't get those defending the delay of Wastelanders, it was clearly not because Beth didn't have resources to get it done. Now it's clear they simply deployed those resources against another revenue source, like they did earlier in the game with the atomic shop. 
---
I'm not surprised, at all. Look at their past behavior on this game specifically. Less than table scraps for the base game and those that have paid for the game, and prioritize revenue generation. They're trying to do what's right for the shareholders, but I believe have finally gone too far and will see their base abandon them. Then and only then will they react because what they've been doing so far has been getting them paid.
---
Lol yeah really
---
can confirm. happend to me yesterday night like 1hour after purchasing 1st.
---
there is a lot of posts about this.
---
The people who paid for it got all their scrap deleted so...
---
Yeah. There have been countless live service games so far, and the only one that actually worked and wasn't a half-broken greedfest was Monster Hunter World.
---
Im starting to think if you hard exit game it happens..like pick wrong server so exit the game from dashboard. Its been common with many i talk to, i did this to refresh my friends list then it happened shortly after
---
If your only here to drive a wedge and hate bethesda's choices. Then i got a simple answer. Uninstall and find a new game to play. Us (whales) who choose to pay in do it by choice. And players who want all to be free are toxic to the future of the game. When all they do is bitch moan and complane. You free boaters got all pissed about the scrap bots. Even tho there is a Resorse extractor given free in every camp system that does the same job. Everyone complained about the refrigerators even tho your food lasts longer on ur toon when useing good with salt perks. As for repair kits you can eather store alot of mats in ur stash and hit up a town and repair free. Or fight the queen witch also gives Free Repair kits, as for scrap kits. I love exploring and hate when it takes me a hr to walk my over loaded ass back into town just to break down stuff then find a stash box to store all in. Then have to pay extra caps to return were i left off.
---
Let me guess you are on Xbox? I think Xbox has a feature where people can join people they have met previously.
---
Nope.  There is no subscription needed to play FO76.^*  You *are* confused.
---
Fallout 1st is purely optional.  I'm not paying it, just like I don't buy atoms.
---
(* other than the PSN subscription Sony insist on).
---
Wow you get fake money what unbeatable value
---
Read what I said
---
It's $18 in Canada. I pay less for Netflix.
---
Woah someone’s delusional enough to defend it. Congratulations pal, you’re crazy.
---
Anddddd it's gone
---
I think AA with Stabilized makes it to 50+(45/2), so 72.5% armor penetration, which is only about 36-38% damage increase.
---
Well it's not loading for me now either, I assume it's a low end plan and the webhost is throttling the site, idk all I can come up with
---
I'll add that
---
you can pay for more stash limit if you want it
---
No one said it did.. But astute observation there. In the mean time i can put 10 where 2 would be.
---
Buy whatever you want, you earned the money
---
Too late for that, I bought it during maintenance and I love it. I figure out why it’s fallout 1st, if it’s your 1st game (your main game) it’s totally worth it.
---
Breh I'm about to farm so many fusion cores to sell
---
Question! Can a friend build a scrap stach in your own camp. And will you keep it if you log off?
---
Last week I found two groups of dead Brahmin near each other.  One group was at a known mini-event point. It was about a dozen total. Next time I’ll be on the lookout for the FWM.
---
Nope, on PC :\
---
They can have the SEO, I want the LOL
---
I have never spent a penny on Atoms, not going to, but I bought a month of F1 for the Ranger Armour after I saw how much so many people hated this move. ;)
---
The site is not working :( and I just found out about it and didn't saw it
---
We're not allowed to upvote anything that isn't angry / about outerworlds any more. Wtf?
---
I'm really annoyed about CashForStash but I also upvoted this post because how is that OPs fault? Dafuq is going on in this place.
---
The game is not a shitshow. Bethesda's monetisation strategy is. If you manage to grab the game for cheap (5-15 Euro/Dollars) it's fully worth playing it for story and the world. But then stop once the story is over and there's nothing left to explore. The endgame was never strong in this game and now it simply feels wrong...
---
I know that's really hard to understand but i'll tell you anyway: People can be mad at more things than one. I'll tell you the same thing i told the Epic Sellouts when they said that instead of beeing mad at them we should worry about climate change instead: I can be mad about both. I can be mad at our politicians and still dislike beeing ripped off
---
I'm sure they'll add more incentives for subscribers with every patch. Expect the better part of every update to be tailored to the subscribers. Just getting started!
---
Whoops, they totally forgot to include that in the patch notes
---
It's down? Can't load it.
---
I'm ~~Brian~~ *birthday* and so's my wife!
---
Brave gamer
---
I didn’t give them anymore money you dummy your assuming shit. Your like 40-50 yrs old? That’s pathetic shouldn’t you be dead by now
---
you will lose all your junk during the time anyway. so doesnt matter \^\^
---
Can you send me screenshot? Site is completely gone
---
Don’t know why bootlickers downvoted you for calling out bootlicking aha
---
The scrapbox is bugged. It makes you loose all items you put in it.
---
Multiple people have bought the membership.
---
Lootable items too. 
---
This was done many months ago because farmers would served hop and grab everything not nailed down at whatever place they were hopping. For example springs used to be a hot commodity, so people would go to McClintock and loot the 30+ clipboards there. Then they'd server hop. If no one had done it on that server, they'd pick up more, then hop again.
---
The system you're describing was implemented to prevent this. If you've picked an item up recently enough, you won't see it in a new world if it hasn't been looted there, but others will.
---
Really? Patch was amazing. No one read anything. People are STILL hung up about being alone. Jesus fuck. I hate fallout players.
---
How about premium payment for monthly shipments of vaseline ? With a bonus fee of 5.99
---
Too early. Even Bethesda gotta know that locking Wastelanders behind this would be suicide. They gotta get people accustomed to the idea of the subscription first. Probably the update after Wastelanders or even the one after that. Wastelanders would be taking it too soon.
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if some asshole was banking on a bitter pill being hard to swallow up-front but gamers have short memories and everyone will come back for Wastelanders. Give the bad news before the good, kinda thing.
---
couldn't agree more its turns into a complete bitch fest honestly it shows the age or maturity of the majority of the people on here, its ridiculous people saying the games dead to them and they'll never play it again but they're commenting on posts that are less than 5 minutes old, I can't wait to get home to give them my £12.99 im into all the extras but my partner and i usually host servers anyway and if you're paying nitrado £6-8 and get nothing extra, I might not keep it up but ill certainly give it ago
---
They probably just went to bed it's been barely a day
---
Oh that's a good sign, I haven't seen any of my friends on them yet but at least someone's using it
---
I'll do you one better: Not buy Fallout 1st at all.
---
It runs fine, quite well in fact, can't get my 32" 4k screen under 55 FPS. I have not been disconnected in ages and lag is not a problem unless the server is going down, which is rare.
---
 The game is good. A lot of the players are crazy though. ;)
---
Get ready for the hate train. And a buch of kids telling you games have changed... Since 2010...
---
How are the private servers not private?  
---
I don't play the game but I like to stay informed.
---
I know, saw the guy who posted that on the FP.
---
It's amusing, to say the least.
---
Have fun storming the castle!
---
Yes, this is the millionth post saying the same thing, you aren't going to change anybody's mind, this is just another annoying trash thread at this point.
---
Can't the moderators begin to personally approve posts?
---
“I know how things work”
---
Stopped reading.
---
Yeah, I also think giving more money to BGS when game is in the current state is not wise, to say politely.
---
&gt;	threatening boycotts isn't going to do anything
---
&gt;	If you don’t like what they produce, don’t buy it.
---
“Talking about boycotting the game isn’t going to do anything, but also you can boycott the game”
---
You bought Fallout 1st and you will suffer the consequences.
---
That is just your opinion. I can earn the amount of money required for a yearly subscription with just one workday, and I am not Elon Musk nor Bill Gates, but I will gladly spend them on an hobby I enjoy. Does that make me "financially irresponsible"? Not really, I can just afford it.
---
This link is wrong, probably why people can't access it.

Yet you can make atoms for free in the game, and they don't provide any actual advantage in any meaningful way.
---
I got it AU$300 preorder :( a month later it was $150 shortly after $76
---
"Heh, Zenimax sounds like the name of a buttplug" Abraham Lincoln, 1866
---
Fallout 76 needed an economy. A flawed and corrupt greymarket exists. A subscription world may help to defeat that greymarket.
---
Lol been gone since the Two Shot nerf, and everything I'm reading says I made. The right choice. Enjoy your dumpster fire
---
When a game releases super cheap, on a pass, without microtransactions and most likely won't have a billion bugs on launch and will probably still run smoothly after a year?? bro bethesda you guys really fucked up, playerbase about to be lookin' scarce.
---
Yeah, looking at it now I think I just read the title wrong, too.
---
I am not playing the game since the release of NW. I am just keeping track of what is going on and laughing at people who continue to defend this piece of garbage.
---
Or just don't be born in australia
---
Some people are like myself and have some disposable income to throw onto the fire. 
---
I was curious and figured "it's only $13, and I want to see how glitchy the private servers are. There's no way these things are going to work right..."
---
Meh. They worked ok for me. 
---
Scrap boxes are kind of boring overall, I liked having to make choices to manage my limited inventory space. 
---
I couldn't figure out how to use the tent, probably obvious but I couldn't find anything for it. Is it crafted? Is it a button? I didn't look that hard.
---
The Ranger armor is neat, but I feel like with all the hate for the subscription service... I'd be justifiably shot if I wore it in the open. "HEY, THIS GUY HAS THE WHALE ARMOR. GET 'EM!" Same thing if someone saw the scrap box at my camp, they'd probably grief it just on principle.
---
Private servers were pretty lagless and made me feel like "Why didn't they just let people play like this from the start? Oh, right." It would have been super boring because without all the randos around to look at there's hardly anything here.
---
The extra atoms a month felt kind of pointless. I already don't really spend the ones I get for free, so...
---
Don't know where I'm going with this, just bored at the moment.
---
That does bring a smile to my face at least.
---
It's a bless that people like you keep appearing here and there, it just enforces my hypothesis.
---
I got the PAE AU$300 preorder :( a month later it was $150 shortly after $76
---
The defending people are in /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ :) They call this sub "the sub that should not be named", lol
---
Yeah I’ve defended Fallout 76 and I don’t regret it though I’m not going to defend something objectively wrong.
---
Oh you freaking mad lad
---
It does I’m afraid.
---
it feels like they just delayed wastelanders to push this shit and set up some paywalls for that update. i highly doubt wastelanders is gonna come for free for fo76 players lol
---
Link doesnt work, and neither does the archive
---
By playing Borderlands, I haven't played since the fridges came out. 
---
Before it was doing events, grinding for legendaries, and running a shop that saw decent traffic.
---
Yeah what you said was wrong
---
/u/KingFarOut You're absolutely right. A lot of people blame Bethesda for the dawn of micro-transactions because of the original horse armor DLC on Xbox, gleefully ignoring the fact there was already a huge community of free modding on PC for their games for years. Bethesda released the tools for modders to do this in the first place but let's not let the facts get in the way of a good pitch forking. 
---
Then again, most people in gaming subreddits these days learned everything they know about gaming and the developers from YouTube click-baiters who then "inform" others. It's all one giant circle-jerk of misinformation. Most of them are too young to have experienced when gaming was good and how the likes of Microsoft and console gaming has ruined their actual entire experience with modern gaming. 
---
Modern Bethesda is of course an absolute joke and a shell of what they used to be. Still, I feel really bad for younger gamers who might never know what a real and immersive RPG or proper multiplayer tactical shooter feels like. Some of those games are still out there but rarely can they afford the likes of IGN and Gamespot "reviews".
---
Yikes, better crawl back under my rock now...
---
I mean in the weeks gone by lol.
---
gamer girl bath water &gt; fallout 1st
---
From what I've read here, yes. After canceling you keep the outfit, keep the Atoms, keep the stashbox but won't be able to add to it, only take from it. You'd have to resubscribe in order to add to the stashbox again.
---
Casuals don't play like me and you they might not even know what a challenge is i know it sounds stupid but these people have not played nearly any game so it's hard to know that kind of stuff 
---
even if the casuals know what a challenge even is they will have to devote an hour at least from the very beginning (with a few exceptions) let me remind you the items are 750 atoms so your gonna have to do a few hard challenge 
---
that wouldn't be so hard but casuals don't take that much time to grind like we do they probably only play and hour or two a day if they want something are they gonna really grind for it or are they just gonna open there wallet instead because they make more money an hour then the time it takes to grind
---
Yeah but it should influence people because if we dtop investing money in a half made game they maybe change stuff. And if this post has a message that is already known to you just don't read it and post on it.
---
Nothing like crying about people crying. Must be bothered. 
---
Anyhow, $12.99 is a fair rate for a ride.
---
This guy has a valid point
---
Lol, looks like private servers are not so private and "eats" all your junk (previous posts) :))) And people paying money to experience all this shit, unbelievable...
---
It's best main story of any Fallout games, sure. But it has also the least interesting world to explore of all Fallout games. Even F1 had more exploration to it than FNV. And then there's the fact that FNV doesn't FEEL like a Fallout game. It's more like a cowboy adventure.
---
I'd say that FNV is definitely better RPG and a game in general than Fo76, but I consider Fo76 a better Fallout game. That's why these comparisons between Bethesda and Obsidian are lacking. TOW may be a great story, but it lacks the exploration aspect of Fallout. It has none of the strong points of Bethesda games...
---
GameStop will take online games if they are the hard copies not online digital verisons.
---
Absolutely my thinking.How can you still support BGS by buying stuff like this
---
Cool. Im a Full Unyielding Sentinel Guy myself so Im glad i chose the right path 🤣
---
Being able to hoard infinite resources absolutely gives you an advantage over other players. Here's why, it's not a single op thing, it's a lot of lite things adding up. 
---
-You get to free up space for more useful gear in your stash.
---
-You will never have to decide if keeping junk on you to make use of weight reduction perks is necessary. Thus your chances of loosing resources to other players is significantly reduced.
---
-The previous point means that you are risking significantly less to engage in PvP than someone who didn't spend extra money. 
---
-You do not need to make use of junk weight reduction perks freeing up perk points that are otherwise almost mandatory.
---
-Your ever growing hoard of materials will ensure you never experience scarcity again. Even with rarer materials, you just liquidate some of your hoard and buy the mats you need.
---
-Vendor cap limits slow players trying to sell excess mats. Having unlimited mat storage means you do not have to slow your gathering down to match. 
---
-You will become exceedingly wealthy over time. Being able to hoard unlimited materials means you can store unlimited wealth. Even caps have a limit. You have paid to be free of that limit. 
---
-Your ability to hoard materials will undercut the player economy. Privileged players will have the abundance to sell lower than the rest of the playerbase.
---
Tl;Dr: You free up space that you can now fill with more power. You can become infinitely wealthy. You are now protected from the only way to lose progress. Scrap box is absolutely p2w.
---
The fact that we're getting downvoted just proves the point lol
---
gotta sadly pay an extra 10.99 to get fallout 1st bug free
---
Upload please (imgur or something)
---
The outfit is from New Vegas, you profligate
---
Your comment agreed with mine. 24 players is *not* an mmo...
---
You can cancel it and still keep the bonuses.
---
I’m just saying without stopping the worst offenders like insane p2w systems and loot boxes (gambling for gamers) hitting on game subscriptions is pointless and fake. It’s true they break a cosmetics only promise but they said it themselves in last itv and if i have to choose them breaking the promise or fo76 losing support like anthem i chose dealing with my new subscription I don’t want a situation like we had after fallout 2 when original studio when bankrupt and there was no new fallout for years.
---
Alot of people have asked for additional camp systems since beta, including myself 
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0wp1f/suggestion_3_camp_s/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It's a shame that the community has been screaming this for so long just to have it sold back to us, and through a subscription system? 
---
Come on Bethesda are your heads so far up your own arses that you can't see the shit you are spraying?
---
W10 which you can also get for free
---
You aren't going to influence people by calling them dumb. I think this is rule number one of any debate strategy.
---
Hey ass rape is no joke come on🤣🤣🤣
---
I really enjoy the game and my partner isn't interested in playing it with me in public servers, we always host our own servers on other games so to pay nitrado or another company is £6-8 a month anyway, I can now play with my missus, it'll be well worth it to me also id have paid for unlimited stash on its own, unlimited stash which as far as I'm aware is resource intensive, from their previous descriptions to why it wasn't possible before anyway so that wouldn't have came without a cost attached
---
I fully agree with everything you have said.
---
Same :( then I felt I had to like it after AU$300 down
---
My bad it's been awhile
---
Nope that's how it works, if you don't want them there you need to block all your friends and unblock them later.
---
I'm considering to try outer worlds.  Fallout 76 became a cashgrab game.  Private servers sounds nice but i'm not gonna pay any more money for it. I paid 70€ for buying a game that was unfinished at start, full with bugs (and there are still plenty of bugs in it), without much challenge,...  New content they added to the game was boring, buggy or not relevant for me.  Now they let us pay for private servers whats next?  Paying to get the NPC's add on? I just can't waste any more money to this.  The game has so much potential but it seems  greed ruined it.
---
Actually, the patch notes said they did:
---
* **Weight Reductions:** The following items have had their weights reduced **to help them consume less C.A.M.P. budget when placed in Display Cases**:
---
* Bobbleheads: Weight reduced from 1 lb to 0.01 lb.
---
* Magazines: Weight reduced from 0.5 lb to 0.01 lb.
---
You’re basing your notion of perceived value on imaginary currency that can be appreciated or depreciated by Bethesda at any point.
---
That’s not an investment or a value. You’re paying $100 a year for:
---
010101010101010101010101010010101001010
---
I can’t respect anyone that thinks that’s a clever or justified waste of money.
---
For me personally $100 a year is not that much. That's less than $10 a month and divided by how many hours I've put in i consider that cheap entertainment. I do understand that it does give me an advantage but it is far from pay to win. These private worlds were never going to be free. The only change i would make is the ability to pay for a month of service with like 2000 atoms or something, so that people who are not able to afford or are just morally opposed to it could still have access. Now as far as my world id like to set up cage matches at workshops so we could have some interesting pvp. Kind of like fight clubs. Maybe even have boxing matches and give prizes and caps away. That could be fun i believe.
---
Nah anyone on your list can just rock up uninvited.
---
You know Bethesda? I really hope you'll read this comment...
---
Go... F\*\*\*\*... Yourself!
---
You released the most shitty game of all time, spitting at our face, abusing us, gamers. Yes I said gamers, not consumers, because we are humans before wallets.
---
You just prove me that I won't ever buy a game from you :). I threw you into trash like I did with EA. Wish you a happy life, thieves.
---
Special note for Todd Howard: Maybe you can take a little bit inspiration from Marcin Iwiński ;)
---
&gt; "Wastelanders isn't finished!
---
As if that ever stopped them before
---
No bro they’re boycotting the game , because obviously most of the people making these posts play the game a lot and definitely aren’t just people following a trend ..
---
Yes that's how they've done it, if you don't want them to join then you have to block them
---
Because rational thought is harder and less satisfying than blind group outrage.
---
Paid stash space is 1 of the things they added yesterday lol
---
True.
---
Weird, the activation code will be used anyway.
---
That's what you all get for buying into a severely flawed games su subscriptions service before they actually fixed the big issues in the game. P.S. they made it very clear they cannot undo these kinds of changes, so now your out the money and your junk. I'll shed a single tear for you. Just one though
---
The junk complaint is silly the stash size issue never had anything to with junk limits. It was all about gear. If we all hoarded gear like I did in F4 the servers would have melted.
---
How does that affect other players?
---
Oh I must have been replying to someone else then, mobile reddit is weird and just tacks replies to the last comment in a thread I think, sorry
---
Not yet. That would be a step too fast. My guess is the update after Wastelanders or the update after that. Might make one or two parts of Wastelanders cost though.
---
Ummm..... okay.
---
Well played.. better investment
---
At least getting mugged is exciting....
---
For me it will feel like stealing, as it works as advertised i will not go for refund.
---
on ARK private servers are free.
---
you want more games?
---
A big thing for me was I couldn't rebind certain keys.  I play left handed so I usually mirror the keys to the other side.  However menu keys like "take all" and "take one" were stuck on the defaults. 
---
That and it just hit different than NV for me.
---
One day, the players, loyalists, long time fans and on the fencers will agree that they’ve had it. And then Bethesda will lose their most reliable form of revenue, which will spook investors who’ll pull out and go somewhere else. And then where will Bethesda go? If they’re lucky, get absorbed into another company that’ll respect the games if they buy up IPs as well, otherwise bankrupt and no more Fallout or Skyrim. Each mistake Bethesda makes as a result of their own initiative or share holder’s demands is only going to build up the pressure to fix Fo76 entirely and in the bigger picture what the future for their other games will look like..
---
How do you get the tent to place anywhere? I only see the option to move my camp at the bottom my pipboy screen.
---
if anything at the very least you're getting 150 extra AP for dodgy.
---
hahaha #bethesda
---
Fallout 76 is literally just a Fallout 4 multiplayer mod. Most of the blame is to place on who made Fallout 4
---
Yes too.
---
1: Grammer.
---
2: If you don't complaint for the most part doesn't come from people that simply enjoy bashing the game but from people that see amazing potential in the game that is constantly squandered by continous lapse of judgement, pay for convenience is wrong since all of that you get could be earned through playing the god damn game, not to mention said scrap bots got even nerfed in the last patch. 
---
It's not about how convinient it is, it's about the principle of it, or what's left of it inside of the marketing team.
---
lol imagine paying full price at launch and being content just by having one year free of premium
---
Yep I’m so bothered just don’t tell everyone I’m crying as I type this
---
I also believe obsidian wasn't given much time to compete the game as well so ended up being rushed
---
I was annoyed when I got pretty much laughed out of this group for complaining that after 10 months they're too busy trying to cash in on micro and adding things players don't want instead of fixing the game. This is the proof of it guys. Bethesda don't give a shit about you except for what's in your wallet
---
DUDE ITS A LITTLE LATE TO NOT BE BUYING IT
---
Unlikely. You have to remember that the sub population is but a fraction of the true player base. Since Beth won’t release the player count we don’t know for sure, but if i had to make a wild guess we represent maybe 10% of the base at best. The PS achivement data shows maybe 400k players and thats just on PS alone. 
---
As long as those players keep buying atoms and sign up for falloutfirst, Bethesda is going to keep churning put these features, this sub be damned.
---
[Someone took a video and posted it on the brand new FalloutFirst subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutFirst/comments/dmdmgn/what_a_glorious_dumpster_fire/)
---
Bethesda obviously has a team squatting in their offices for damage control (because they can't be arsed to update the kill numbers on nights and weekends during the community event, BUT HOW DARE THE COMMUNITY COMPLAIN ABOUT PAYING REGULARLY FOR THE GAME THEY ALREADY PAID FOR) and reported it for using their copyrighted assets.
---
I don't care about people spending money i also have it lol but it is not understandable to me why people support things that are half baked.Like if you continue to put money into systems line this there will never be a change...
---
yeah thought of that almost immediately. but this game is aimed at the generation following that one which pushed back, and they are going to get away with it.
---
You mean outer worlds that is essentially free on game pass and can be pre loaded right now?
---
🍿🍿🍿
---
&gt; What are Bethesda's intentions with an unarguably high priced subscription service for this game? To fund extra features, further development and maintenance? Doubtful; games of higher quality with more content than this either don't charge subscriptions or have the content to back it up. This suggests the motivation for the subscription is profit.
---
This only suggests that you see what you want to see. You raised doubts, then proceeded to solve them by means of your own, personal opinion on the subject only to conclude with an absolute statement which is supposed to be the ultimate truth. But which is unfortunately based just on your opinions, not on facts.
---
given the site was given the reddit hug of death.....
---
I have a ton of players i traded with guess its time to empty the list to only people i actually play with...thanks
---
Although I got my fair share of enjoyment with FO76, I'd hardly call it an RPG given the absolute lack of any kind of player choice in the story/quests.
---
And the shooter part is garbage to say the least.
---
I'd say get it on sales if you like exploring a beautifully crafted word and piecing together a good story through exploration.
---
I dont think i ever Saw dodgy. I have Powered on 3 on my armor pieces so i have pretty good ap. But Im gonna check it out !
---
I mean ppl whi actually paid for this shit after what BGS has been doing can only blame themselves if the features are not working as intended. NOTHING is working as intended in this game....
---
You see I have a problem with this. And it's now with you or your argument. Is that I wanted to do some stuff on Appalachia. What do I do?
---
No, its truth. The game is really fun, but the quest content (not daily or world timer repeated events)  are scarce. Daily tasks are mobile log in daily style  content, like fallout shelter, would you pay a subscription for fallout shelter to level up/be able to build faster?
---
I love fo76, its alot if fun, but not worth a monthly sub when I'm already paying a monthly sub. if this allows more content to come out faster, great I'll redact this complaint, but honestly, they should have done this post-wastelanders release, not prior.
---
Lol thanks for the chuckle that is really funny
---
Holy hell this is real?!? Offering a subscription for a game most gamers don’t want to play is amazing! BioWare should totally do this for Anthem! I can’t wait to see what Bethesda will think of next.
---
People in the Beth Forum love the idea in overall, reddit is REALLY small compared that part of whales
---
I know my "contribution" means shit for them, I fighted with myself to buy at least that 1 month membership only for this Ranger outfit, but I asked myself if I really want to give them more money, "accepting" some way their bullshits and risking loosing all my junk (and who know what else) or should I stay with hundred of outfits available in the game and spend 64 PLN (that's the price in my currency) for at least 6-7 really good crafted beers...
---
Sorry mate but that's what you het for supporting these fcking scammers. Cancel that cancerous sub and ask God for forgiveness.
---
&gt;That is just your opinion.
---
If this works, the most likely outcome is that the next few updates will cost money as well. It's obvious that Bethesda doesn't feel bound by it's word anymore so i wouldn't put it past them.
---
Haha this is so true... Every single post is rude as fuck and mean.... Yup, I'd listen to that person right away..
---
no, all of my items are gonna rot and die with this dumpster fire of a game, waste your own time and farm for your own stuff
---
Pay2win
---
For the love of... I’m addressing the idiocy of someone saying a big company requires extended time to gather simple promotional imagery and set up payment processing once a decision has been made and you’re going into the background of the decision making process that had to have happened *before* that. And on top of that, you apparently think that the management that is making the decisions like this is the also the ones doing the coding and artwork and whatnot. A lot of things occur concurrently. Managers are in meetings about direction while programmers and artists are doing their things. It’s not like everything comes to a halt while everyone waits with bated breath for each meeting to let out and tell them what new path they’re now on.
---
Yes. Then we will have a real rebellion on our hands.
---
Worth to add it can only store scrap, the basic components that can not be scrapped further, you can store steel but not bulked steel, you can store lose screws but not the desk fan, you can’t store hardened mass (because it can be scraped to ultracite)
---
So basically the argument is you don't like it so I shouldn't play it?
---
Sic semper tyrannis.
---
thanks for sharing! now when someone will tell "nobody will be so naive to to pay for this scam" I'll just link this as exhibit A
---
I don't even know how to react to it tbh. I'm waiting for them to come out and say something. 
---
My advice to Bethesda would be as follows: consider offering refunds and change the subscription service to provide no gameplay advantages.
---
Like you said it'd probably get thrown out and I'm pretty sure Bethesda doesn't want to dig their grave any deeper because you know word would get out about the lawsuit further destroying Bethesda's reputation
---
Spoiler: They won’t
---
Just too bad they couldn't make everything "smoother" over the past year like they should've, instead people are paying for solutions to the problems they can't fix.
---
I mean... yeah. If someone supports a practice you don't agree with (that's tied to something you enjoy) therefore sustaining the continuation of said practice then yes it affects you.
---
Also I agree with vote with your wallet the whole post was about being fed up with it and leaving. I don't know if you missed that part. I encourage others to do the same.
---
Best comment on this one
---
Ok 🤷‍♂️
---
It's just literally junk tbh. So easy to replace
---
I played a lot GTA but I prefer RDO now
---
Those are some cool ideas. I'm really hoping more people come up with ideas like that.
---
That's a lot of words just to say "Yeah daddy bethesda, spank me harder. I've been such a bad consumer!"
---
You need subscription to use scrap box
---
People from your friends list seem to be able to join, the only current way to prevent is to block everyone on your friends list. I'm sure soon enough they will add a offline mode where it just makes your statuses appear to be off line so they can't see you like Steam has offline mode. You can see your friends but they can't see you.
---
 No, to piss people like you off, is why. ;)
---
They also said only cosmetics in the shop. BGS/Zens word means very little.
---
probably a web admin shortage to rival the great canvas shortage.
---
I believe that's only happening on pc,
---
I'm not gonna personally get the subscription myself, but if I were I could totally see myself and the couple friends I have who played this putting money together so we're technically splitting the cost for the private server.  If even 3 other people chip in that's almost half off.
---
People are buying it now but the industry is changing and moving away from these types of antics. Other studios have learnt and know that in the long run it’s bad for business. Instead of taking a step forward , BGS took a huge step back.
---
Not really, atleast not for me
---
Fallout 76 is trending at least once per month since the beginning.
---
I didnt say its for good reasons tho.
---
Starfield, TES6, FO5... they’re all going to be fucked by this greedy whore bullshit. 
---
This has proven that the company is fucking done with trying to make good games.
---
Take mine!
---
Fallout 1st... to have their junk deleted ;)
---
The real question, how many morons are going to buy this?
---
Making a mountain out of a mole hill here
---
Thats not my point.My point is why should you give bethesda 15 dollar per month for a game that isn't even worth 15 dollars on a key selling website,that doesn't habe proper content nor does it have stable servers. Like i said in my post ESO and WoW have the same system and there is no need to argue cause the game offer REAL pro's and cons
---
This is what "Live Service" really means. Releasing the game at 50% completion, then demanding praise for releasing the other 50% "for free" while using it as a excuse to stuff the game full with microtransactions because "How else will we finance the other 50%?". This is what every single live service game except Monster Hunter World that i have played so far was.
---
I'm impressed, you're strong and rude 💪
---
good thought but dont hold your breath, also I wouldnt take it even if it was free lol
---
You sound like a cunt yourself. Do you always stir shit up to make yourself feel tough because of how you feel in real life?
---
You will be able to have an advantage selling ammo is what he is saying
---
This is sad.
---
How many games do you own? How much do you spend for them? Compare that to fo76 and it’s quality.
---
 **Fallout 76 just gave people a reason to play more football** would be also a similarly useless article. I don't see a scenario where someone wasn't hyped for TOW and decided to play it only because of Bethesda got greedy. It's not a binary switch. Many people were ready to play both and now are just dropping 76. Or people like me had no desire to play TOW, but now when we are considering dropping 76 we still have no desire to play TOW.
---
I get it that Obsidian made FNV, but also keep in mind that Obsidian is strong where Bethesda is weak and Bethesda is strong where Obsidian is weak. Obsidian is strong in NPCs, factions and main story. Bethesda is strong in worldbuilding, world design, exploration and self-contained side stories. That's why my dream Fallout game has always been a collaboration between Bethesda and Obsidian. Obsidian would create the main story and main faction, Bethesda would create the world and side stories...
---
this one works
---
they need to take their head out of their collective arse and see no-one is going to buy into this shit. cheeky fuckers lol
---
What did you think was going to happen?
---
BURN!
---
im there with you.
---
And here i was, thinking the price you had to pay to get the DLC in addition to the game was what paid for the DLC. You know, how it works in literally every other industry on the world. You make the product first, THEN you get money for it.
---
That's why I couldn't play it, because it could and should have been so much more. I'll just see the lost potential. Also, I don't play games with micro-transactions, especially ones that are quality of life improvements that should have been built into the base game. 
---
I'm glad that you got enjoyment out of it though.
---
It’s not free, and a subscription isn’t needed to play so it’s .. b2p.
---
was that hard ?
---
You're not playing 5D chess on Bethesda level, bub. See, they're gonna charge $100 a year and only their most loyal sheep will pony up. Then a year later, they'll announce private servers will become free. Cheers and fanfare from everyone who was mad at them, first flock who already coughed up the $100 is still gonna stay with them.
---
I will say I had more luck sparking PvP than normal since the super loners were all on private servers. But on the other hand they were all PvP groups that came out to play so it ended up being me and my brother vs like 10 people with stealthboy tesla meta characters, which I refuse to do because jumping around shooting at nothing with guns that auto aim while everyone is invisible has to be the most ridiculous thing this game has to offer. 
---
I did get kicked off once and had some pretty bad lag myself so it was about normal for me.
---
They now have you and they won't let you leave.
---
Sure, but these were partial ingredients for chems. I figured I'd get the rest later but took too long.
---
Wow.  Some people are really angry to hear that you don't need a subscription to play FO76.  How odd.
---
SShhhh. Don't spoil the myth! People think this stuff is actually in a container in their camp taking up space...
---
Alot have, including people like me who bought it purely to test it with friends to see what the bugs are.
---
Can they though? Nissan has been trying to get Nissan.com forever and hasn't been able to.
---
Well, seeing this is their only big multiplayer release, they have proven they know how to do single player considerably better than big online multiplayer ones. When have they messed up on the caliber of fallout 76 in one of their single player releases besides creation club? The only truly less than optimal release by Bethesda in the last 17 years really only is 76 in my view.  Not counting games made by their subsidiaries.
---
I guarantee you wastelanders will be free. They have been explicit about that compared to the one informal interview quite I’m sure you are referring to. Thy clarified their guiding principles in last week’s inside the vault. If they violate those I could understand the anger.
---
*Todd looks at this thread*
---
It just works!
---
Lel
---
I personally do not see a sub model as bad, as you are making an active choice to spend your money on something that you feel you want and there seems to be value to what goes behind it, rather than just a skin.   The private sessions and bottomless junk stash alone are substantial.  This is not something that interests me, but I can see the logic and I think it is a better model than selling useless crap in the atomic shop.  
---
They could have offered the first month free to try and attract new customers and the cost is a little high, but I suspect they will review their price point after a few months if they do not draw in what they were looking for.
---
MY only advice to BGS is not to start thinking that FO 76 is ESO.  Fallout 76 is nowhere near the scope of that game, which is the reason that it draws in a substantial sub base.  Fallout 76 would have to totally change its focus on the   
---
 up coming human NPC's, added quest lines and increased map size to get anywhere near where ESO is and maintain such a large player base for years.  ESO also sells DLC, though older (non-current) DLC are free with the sub. I just buy my DLC and have no interest in a sub, but there are many that do.  The DLC is a big part of the games sustainability, both in content and in funding future efforts, that is supported by the sub in that model.
---
The other aspect to ESO that attracts sub are for those that are heavy into crafting, but materials are harder to find in ESO so the unlimited storage has real impact.  In FO 76, there is junk everywhere, so the impact of the bottomless junk is more convenience than necessity, which will impact motivation to sub.  Either they are going to modify the availability of junk in game to increase the perceived value of the sub, or it really will not have that much impact.
---
The other aspect is timing, as this maybe "to little, to late".  There only hope is that wastelanders draws back old and brings in new players with the sub as a new reality that is accepted.  To do this, wastelanders needs to be a HIT!, and the bugs need to be gone.  So take your time and cook it well!
---
The final aspect is the player base perceived value of the product.  When ESO was launched it was a dumpster fire, but it was quickly addressed and the game is now one of the best MMO's on the market with few technical issues.  It always debates balance, but not game breaking bugs.  That does not describe FO 76!
---
I personally enjoyed the game and payed full price at launch.  I certainly feel like I got my money worth.  But does Fallout 76 deserve more of my money, or is it a game I see myself playing like ESO ... for years?  It will need to make some serious changes to get me there, which includes huge leaps in stability and significant and substantial content to get me there and I suspect I am not alone.
---
I know many want mods as well, but that would not be good for this game financially.  Then need to get into the paid DLC business to add real game content if this game is to expand, grow and survive.  
---
My 2-caps!
---
In a way lol it's similar to an abuse victim having a knee-jerk reaction to defend their abuser "he's not a bad guy" "He doesn't mean those things" "He makes mistakes but he loves me"
---
this! especially with the new box. i mean i can grab every piece of junk i see, what i not did before. but maybe wait with farming till its fixed \^\^
---
oh and it might still be some kind of transfer bug, so the junk is still there but not avaiable at the moment. same happened with some powerarmor pieces. the patch it got fixed people had the lost pieces in their inventory.
---
So, how's the multiplayer mode?
---
Because antics like these ruin games. If you’re saying okay to this, imagine saying okay to what’s coming next.
---
It is not pay2win, it’s pay2have a couple extra perks
---
funny thing is they dont even have the exchange rate right, pay $12 a month... or £12 if you are from the UK, which makes it $15 something... LOLWUT.
---
they need to experience a backlash for this, more so than releasing the game in the shit state it was (and kinda still is) but also having the grapes to want to charge MORE... fuck right off Todd, your ploy doesnt "just work" lol
---
How did you ride your bike from Baltimore to Rockville?
---
How about you just don't play the game
---
It would be entitlement if it weren't for the fact that Bethesda is going back on their word about all of the updates being free.
---
You're also forgetting that people are still pissed they payed full price for this game. You could make an argument that is an entitled view. But I would counter that by saying the market itself has dictated it is not worth full price.
---
Are there entitled people in the lot? Of course. Are people justified in their outraged? Abso-fuckin'-lutely.
---
[Not the kind I were looking forward to.](https://youtu.be/GjBvay4JdgI)
---
In this one you can take a ship with a bunch of gunners, and then board the enemy, and destroy them from within.
---
Hidden benefit of smaller friend list: no micro stutters 👍
---
Sure
---
My faith in humanity may be at an all time low, but I cant see to many people hoping on board for this. Not for that asking price.
---
There is no incentive, and one you start you have to keep the payments up otherwise you might lose a tone of your work. 
---
If activision and EA back down from backlash then Bethesda probably will to. 
---
Or at the very least up the stash limit again. We all asked for 1000, not that 800 seems like a deliberate and malicious choice...
---
All items are "just text" at any time. EVERYTHING you actually see is done on your PC. On the servers, every item is but a database entry. 
---
Name:Type:Mods:Amount:Current Durability:Max Durability: ...
---
That for every item in the game. The thing is, scrap only has Name: Amount and that's it. And the server literally doesn't care if amount says 1 or 100000000 so giving us unlimited scrap space wouldn't impact the server whatsoever.
---
I was just expecting private servers, not more utility items, one being something suggested by the community. They're literally looking at our suggestions, saying "oh yeah, that's a fucking fantastic idea!" and selling it to us. This shit is just going to get worse.
---
This is glorious
---
you subbed? well.... you subbed to bethesda, what did you expect, it to "just work"?
---
He didnt say you were defending fallout 1st he said you were defending bethesda, to which you replied that you didnt, but now you say that you did defend bethesda. Do you read your own comments?
---
I know I've gotten a hard copy of final fantasy online it works just don't get any of the bonus stuff
---
Some people is just blind. I mean you.
---
`HAHAHA SUITS YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS COMPANY`
---
I can appreciate both Obsidian creating a spiritual successor to the original Fallouts and NV while also Bethesda taking the franchise and doing something different with it or experimenting. It's just a shame that this is the development they decided to attempt instead of actually delivering on what people were hoping 76 would be. To me, treating both as if they're rival sports teams that you can only support one or the other is moronic, in a perfect world one should be able to enjoy what both produce (and until recently that was the case, at least for me). I consider this recent development a loss for Bethesda, but not a win for Obsidian.
---
[https://imgur.com/kI6r77A](https://imgur.com/kI6r77A)
---
Sure, but how does someone else paying $10 a month for a private server and some cosmetics affect your personal playing experience? 
---
That's what I'm trying to figure out here. Because there's a whole lot of outrage, with the only real explanation being "monetization bad &gt;:(".  I don't mean this as a personal thing btw, it's been spammed all day, and I guess you won (or lost?) the lottery.
---
If anything, you benefit from other people paying for them. More money means they can keep their employees paid to make content and fix bugs. Not to mention servers aren't free to host and maintain. All at no extra expense to you.
---
umm i see lots of players in a single instance its a massively multiplayer online game is it not?
---
Yeah i agree
---
Unoctiums has multiple customizations, like BOS style, light heavy and medium armors, and helmet light
---
That...doesn’t really detract from my point.
---
Don't try to outbid people who have this membership if someone puts a gun to exchange for ammunition
---
Cool story
---
At the **VERY LEAST**...
---
Thanks a lot mate
---
It's Bethsada, they will offer him 50 bucks and half a hoagie.
---
I do a lot of rading so always adding now its time to start deleting...lol
---
grow up angry kid
---
Please enlighten me as to why this is not a big deal?
---
Right. Of course if you free up 200 Storage by taking all your scrap out, that means you can put 200 worth of armor in instead so it does have some kind of impact. But i agree, this should be part of the base game. It's not like enough people still play the game as to where it would bother the server in the slightest.
---
Can you post them? The way back machine link is broken
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Sorry.
---
Yeah, my camp budget was full before the patch. I have a full bobble head rack (20 bobble heads). After the patch, I still didn’t have enough space to build a scrap box. There was no effect on the budget.
---
Hahahahahahahaha.. fallout worst.no. just... no.
---
An optional paid service that has zero impact on the core game is not a big deal. The only problem I see are the scrap boxes, but to stop playing a game that I enjoy for something that honestly won’t impact me personally at all it’s pretty silly
---
5.56 it's also currency for some people bro
---
holy shit thats funny as hell
---
Make a friend with the subscription and make him invite you in his server.
---
Karma.
---
you were saying?
---
this guys a shill literally go through his post history
---
I told people that back when they announced repair kits and everyone went "Nah that won't happen repair kits don't matter we don't care about repair kits". Yeah i didn't care about repair kits either but i knew that repair kits were but the first step on a long road of overreaches. And this is just the latest one. Watch them start to monetize expansions soon. Probably not yet with Wastelanders, but the one after that or the one after that will be paid, i guarantee it.
---
At this stage you are giving them too much credit to think they could manage to do something right.
---
I hadn’t even thought of the 556 market
---
When I heard "private servers" were coming, I thought they'd be like dedicated servers provisioned to the customer, like the Counter Strike servers you could create on your PC in the days of old.
---
From what I've seen, "private worlds" are more like world instances on Bethesda's own servers with restricted access and a player limit of 8. Same hardware, different players. Different save files, if you will.
---
I don’t care what you call me. If I’m a shill for enjoying the game, I’ll gladly take the title.
---
Like I just stopped going to scorched land because the queen never drop me anything.
---
So literally no games lmfao
---
EA doesn't just close Studios because they felt like doing something evil that day. They are legally obliged to make their shareholders Money.
---
Which means if a Studio just fails to deliver (like Westwood, and that specifically wasn't EAs fault, like one of their Founders later said) or is seen as too out of touch (like Visceral, which was also founded by EA in the first place) its only logical from their point of view that they close them down to use their resources more efficiently. That's not the "good guy" thing to do, sure, but it isn't extraordinarily evil like some people like to pretend either.
---
And what any of that has to do with how Bethesda handles Fo76 I'm not sure.
---
Oh snap, i'll have to remember that one.
---
To be honest I heavy doubt people still playing this game have that much friends playing it xD
---
So in case you want to add this - if you get kicked from your server (happened once already) or if your game crashes (happened once also), you return to your original server. I was in the middle of defending a workshop event and the game crashed. When I came back, I was still in the defend event like I'd never left. Later, the server dropped me and when I came back, I still had the workshop.
---
A little reality check for everyone they will stop being that price once the service gains a large enough user base. This also goes for the new Disney service. These subscriptions services build library dependency over time and start by running at a loss.
---
You misunderstood. It literally says there that it can be used on Private Servers AND Official Servers. It counts for everything.
---
Please enlighten me as to how it is? 
---
I'd love to hear how somebody paying $10 a month for private servers and some cosmetics negatively affects your personal playing experience. Or hell, drop the "negatively" part entirely. 
---
The closets thing to an actual discussion about this that I've seen is just insults and "monetization bad &gt;:(", so if you have a constructive explanation, I'd love to hear it.
---
You made the game worse for everyone including yourself, and you lost money. Again, congratulations on your effort.
---
That’s a fair point, for you personally. But I think you’re missing the bigger picture. This kind of shit catches on, horse armour packs, lootboxes, battle passes. It’s never a problem if it doesn’t affect you. Until it is a problem. I’m sure you don’t think it is now, and I can’t make you stop playing a game you enjoy. 
---
But how long before it gets worse? Because you didn’t nip that shit in the bud because “it doesn’t affect me” that attitude is pretty silly imo
---
When you start a trailer with something akin to "From the studio that made Fallout: New Vegas..."
---
That's being compared to Bethesda, right off the bat, especially with their timing of the first trailer, which IIRC, came on the heels of Bethesda fucking something up real bad with 76, though that can honestly be at any point in the last year so... Take that as you will.
---
They knew what they were doing though.
---
I’m adding and then deleting everyone i can’t quickly recognise on my list, I can always add them again if needed, my real friend list is on discord anyway
---
You said that they cancelled it because they couldn't monetize it. Which is just plain false. Orca was barely in the concept-Stage, even refering to it as a Game is more misleading that anything.
---
Well I was just asking 'cause I see a lot of people trying to do something against fallout first.
---
Apparently, but it does sound like custom server settings will be coming in the future
---
Also go fuck your self I was just asking a question
---
Probably was their initial though buuuuuut... Money.
---
No problem... What happened?
---
When the haters were right all along ಥ_ಥ
---
and tomorrow comes Outer worlds, so no need to even wait a week for an alternative.
---
No it doesn't..stop spreading lies. Smh
---
You're about the only person that defended it with an actually good reason, i see the appeal of private servers and its right that you can rent them, but you do have to admit that conviniency shouldn't be part of the package.
---
I’m one of those morons. Only 1 month though. So part moron?
---
Yeah. The way things are is that wood is a item with a amount. The game doesn't care what amount reads. It's just one number. By introducing the whole "Bulk" feature it just doubles the amount of database entries as now they need "Wood" and "Wood: Bulk" so giving everyone unlimited crafting space and scrapping the bulking instead would lessen the load on the server.
---
Probably part of wastelanders is there.
---
No AAA games. There's still other great indie games, and I missed some gems growing up. The problem is that if people continue to support garbage with microtransactions, then games will just stay bad.
---
It'll be free but no doubt subscribers will get extra bonuses
---
That's a PS4 error it happens with all the games on PS4. It's like the blue screen of Windows but on a console.
---
They're like a evil genie. 
---
"I want a million dollars"
---
"Granted but you get them by robbing a bank and go to jail for it. Have fun"
---
I had a few occurrences when ghouls were able to easily OHKO me shortly after joining the server, and the same ghouls needed multiple hits two OHKO deaths later.  
---
Yesterday I loaded into a world with a 250 level character equipping a level 50 gun, yet I loaded as level 1 character with full special filled with "locked" cards and unable to change any weapons because I haven't meet the level requirement. After a minute, I loaded completely in and could play normally.
---
gods work. I hope bethesda is shitting their trousers
---
&gt;because it could and should have been so much more. I'll just see the lost potential. 
---
It's definitely frustrating.
---
ManyATrueNerd made an awesome video on what is wrong with FO76 and how to fix it, it's disheartening to get a glimpse at how good the game could have been if Bethesda had actually tried.

---
good to know I wasnt the only one, but yeah this is it for me. good bye fo76 and screw you BGS
---
i posted about this yesterday when it was mentioned in the patch notes and no one really cared. I find it disgusting since the bags are a limitation that is stopping us properly decorating our C.A.M.P's but i think that is a me thing.
---
Or if they have 2 brain cells to rub together.

Mods

I’m sorry but that kind of complacent consumerism is the exact thing that’s ruining more and more video games. “It doesn’t affect me” is not a valid reason to let shit slide.
---
Thats really shitty. I read that too and was super excited
---
When you act like the fridge or the Scavenger actually provide an advantage you really are stretching
---
Neopets doesn't count as a real game.
---
I'm talking about Bethesda being one of the first to go mainstream with the concept. I'm sure there's fringe cases, but nothing that I can recall as particularly popular.
---
In other news, Bethesda releases a patch/update/content and it has bugs. Shock.
---
Metal sturdy/heavy plans drop from ash heap/toxic valley and savage divide events so that makes sense. The drop rate is low though so that is a good one to get.
---
I bought the one month and canceled right after just to get the atoms and items 🤷‍♂️
---
Bethesda. Current year. Sad
---
No, they've just shifted everything into macrotransactions by cutting content from the game to sell back to you. And. You're. Fucking. Buying. It. 
---
You are the person P.T. Barnum was talking about when he said "there's a sucker born every minute."
---
Literally anything made by Bethesda brings them income. That T51 Funko you like? Bethesda.  Wanna get your buddy DOOM? Bethesda makes profit. Resub to ESO? Bethesda. Preorder Starfield? Bethesda. Get nostalgic, and buy Wolfenstein? Bethesda. Want to order that cute Deathclaw plushy? Bethesda makes money on ALL ot this shit. Get it? Bethesda has a LOT more than FO76, if they didn't, they'd be dead about now.
---
Did you remove the stands? Did you think it would just go away like legacy rifles did?.
---
Anyways delete your stand and replace... Not sure why someone need to tell you this?
---
So in other words, there IS no reason to be mad other than "monetization bad! &gt;:(". Noted.
---
 EA/20
---
I'll get my tissues and give this a watch. Then tomorrow I'll play Outer Worlds and hopefully be happy again.
---
No not defending just stating facts it is optional you don’t need it to enjoy the game but it shouldn’t kill a game because of something that is completely optional
---
Well in Switzerland it is 17.90/mo 139.90 Year. Conversion rate is about 1:1, so it is 138 USD....
---
Are you fucking crazy! I paid already 80 USD for the game you've promised...
---
This is how things are right now. There's no way to tell if they'll change any of that in the future.
---
Yeah. What people wanted was Minecraft style Private Servers. Download the serverfiles, put them ON YOUR OWN SERVER and then have fun changing the options and setting to your liking, installing mods on your server and what not. Literally nobody asked for THIS.
---
$179.95 Australian per year and $22.95 per month. After pre-ordering PAE at $300 :/
---
you forgot activision
---
Pretty much. My oppinion of Beth/Zos is in the dirt right now. At every turn they have fucked up. The fucked up the vault raids. They fucked up the legendary sale. The games still buggy as hell. They lied about the micro transactions and they delayed the only substantial content they had tried to release in the year since the beta. But despite all that they want some more cash to keep the game going. Bethesda/Zenimax want us to treat 76 as an MMO, when it has nothing an MMO has. So yeah sadly my trust in them is at an all time low. I will like them to bounce back, as I love fallout and despite it all still think 76 has huge potential, however I'm out of good will. If they want that back they can earn it with quality, meaningful content and by sticking to their word.
---
Oops I already bought 1st.
---
14$ for 1600 atoms, a cool outfit, a second mini camp and unlimited junk materials. You also get a private world to use anytime you want.
---
If you dont see the value in that then that is your problem.
---
No it’s not. Minecraft is a single player offline game. Fallout 76 is an online mmo style game. Regardless of whether your computer can handle hosting or not is irrelevant. In minecraft you have to pay to host public servers. This is the same service, allowing you and 7 friends a private world. If you want to play alone then good on you, but that is not what the game was made for and has never been its intended purpose.
---
Running an RX580, 16 GBs of RAM and Ryzen 5 2600 is over the recommended specs and the game runs terribly in cities, except it ran well in the BETA. [This isn't just me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/djfa0b/need_help_optimizing_76/) And theres people with RTX 2080 TIs that drop frames very frequently. Disconnects aren't as often but lag is very very common as about 10 times a day i keep hitting an enemy with my All Rise only to not deal any damage, i try again, no damage, i try again, no damage, i try for god knows how many times and the server finally syncs up. 
---
The game isn't good, and delaying Wastelanders is a testament to that as the current state of the game can't even process Vault 94 correctly.
---
True! I’m getting the game pass tonight to play it!
---
That makes it worse. You see that right?
---
They delayed the content to later, but are still asking for money now. The content that in many people's eyes, would have made the game worth what they have already paid. 
---
It makes Bethesda look like a choosing beggar.
---
Nah, xbox required me to be friends with the owner, not just following.
---
I bought this game because I was promised private servers (for Millennials: 3rd-party server rental/host it yourself) and a creation kit.  
---
They lied. 
---
Be happy you're not in my country Beth. I could report you for false advertisement, if you were.
---
Seeing as they're going back on everything they said, paid mods, and perk packs on the atom shop.
---
Eve's the MMO I've played the most of. I remember flying around hunting people down in an Ashimmu back in the day.  Unfortunately they don't really cater to my play style anymore. Solo pirating is basically impossible these days.
---
I remember someone had the fallout IG handle and would post memes and ask for donations before it became official.  Doesn’t seem like Bethesda thinks about stuff like this too well.
---
Yup. I have no hope for free, traditional mods. It's going to be paid for, beth approved mods that only work if you sub.
---
What about the way Bethesda has been behaving with Fallout 76 tells you that they won't make the standard price 1650 Atoms now? Exactly which of the countless lies, deceptions and money tactics they employed makes you believe that they won't?
---
Wow 10 times more upvotes then fo76 players on this sub 😳
---
Got it
---
considering the ranger outfit it's obvious a bunch of people were going to buy it.
---
I'm more interested in the numbers next month.
---
We can't all be as brilliant, all-knowing and always right as you apparently. So sorry we're not worthy.
---
&gt; It's free for as long as you pay for it.
---
Parody is protected as Fair Use.
---
I was just asking. In fact I'm glad you like fallout first. Sorry if I explained me wrong.
---
I thought this was hilarious till i got the ranger outfit. Im going to shank him now
---
Seriously it's got to the point that being vocal doesn't work, it gets us nowhere, Bethesda doesn't listen to it's community the way we want them to.
---
We were vocal on wanting better QoL items, costumes and private servers, we all wanted implemented into the game and where has that got us?
---
They were implemented but behind a £€$  atom shop, paying for the privilege of having them and now also behind a supscripted pay wall.
---
All Bethesda is bothered by is lining their pockets with as much money it can grab from our bank accounts, it doesn't care about it's loyal fanbase one bit, only in what we can give them.
---
If this is the price we had to pay for free DLC I'd have rather had paid for that instead of what we have received.
---
I actually feel ashamed to have been a fan of Bethesda and fallout, i would have staunchly defended them and the game just  for the bugs etc... with my friends and people I speak to on here.
---
I honestly don't know why I am still playing this game anymore, maybe I thought beth would get it's shit together and actually give a shit about it's community.
---
 At the moment everything just seems to scream cash grab, monetizing everything we seem to like and love about the franchise, it's a seriously dire turn of events that has divided this great community
---
You sure haven't played it in a while... otherwise you wouldn't have take that seriously, didn't mean to offend
---
This is nothing like a loot box. At all. If they do or say something problematic, I will and do speak up. However the subscription just is not a big deal. If anything, added revenue for them with no downside to me will actually provide more resources to add new content in the future. I see zero reason to be outraged lol.
---
Tl;dr people will always find a thing to bitch about and none of this affects me at all.
---
It never has been a very good representation of the entire player base. I doubt more than 25% of the players have ever looked at this subreddit. Yesterday night in my friends list I saw a couple that said private server instead of online.
---
I also know a lot of people that buy Adam because they want to support the game and they like the Cosmetic items. Many of those signed up for the private server since technically it's like getting atoms for half price.  $100 a year = $8.33 a month and you get 1600 atoms.  That's a deal for people already buying them.
---
Personally I don't care either way and I don't understand why everybody is in such an uproar. Most of the people that say they're going to quit the game aren't actually going to do anything. None of this affects me at all, I've never bought atoms with money and I've earned over 7,000 in game. I know how to manage my stash so I don't really need one just for junk. Don't need a second base for fast traveling cuz I know everything on the map and it's easy enough to get around.  I'll continue playing the game exactly like I did before and if anything hopefully the servers won't be as busy.  Yesterday night I farmed White Springs by myself and picked an 3* unyielding sneak combat armor leg.  Best world drop I've had in at least a month.
---
We do compete  for resources, but we can always go farm another  area. Its a small unfair  advantage.
---
My main gripe is that  I know that Bethesda balances this game taking in consideration the utility  store. We are not getting their best game design, we are getting  a nerded version  of it.
---
The capitalism of communism.
---
If anything atom prices have been decreasing... sorry I don’t live off of conspiracy theories.
---
Oh, nothing to worry about then!
---
Less than one in 50 seems fair for historic fallout fans in general, not just "supporters". 
---
Thing is, there have always been lots of popular forums for FO fans - Reddit wasn't really as popular thing back I'm the day of single player FO. I vaguely recollect people posting how to / base build videos and seeking tech support, but that's it. What use was reddit really to fallout fans prior to fo76 when we were playing in our own sand boxes and couldn't / had no reason to trade for real? 
---
That's Incidentally why I started using reddit....my account will be less than a year old for sure.....but I have used the trading reddit that shall not be named a lot.
---
I haven't decided what I really think about fallout1st yet*.....this said I've not really come across  a game that I bought nearly a year ago still giving me free new content before, so I guess that I'm not really surprised by this sort of transition and honestly I don't think that I've had a bad deal from the game so far. 
---
* I really don't know if the fo1st price is worth it for me as I don't currently buy atoms, I only collect scrap to bulk and sell for my daily 1400 caps and I don't want the riot gear (I never sided with the NCR in FONV - house or yes man every time). I also can't imagine anything more dull than a world with just 8 people in it and a tent without the ability to scrap things (so they can be put in the new scrap bin) is not very useful to me....
---
I would have preferred more transparency and honesty upfront though.....I don't hate the game for this change though as I am not losing out by not subscribing....and it's no stretch of the imagination for me to assume that they're making this all up as they go.
---
Well they already took your money.
---
At this point, what difference does it make?
---
No acting here when it’s a clear advantage. 
---
It provides an advantage even though it was minuscule. 
---
If were out in a field, had no repair kit from actual drops and I were fighting a Scorchbeast and my weapon breaks I can’t repair it there and then. However, the other player in my group who bought a repair kit, can repair his weapon there and then and continue the fight because he paid for something. Technically yes they’re both advantageous, but small. If you can’t see that then BGS have really got you.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
A well-deserved outcome for you.
---
Hide until you get all the rewards. Is all you can do.
---
The main issue that has been lost in the outcry and focusing on smaller details is the private servers were expected to be something else entirely. This is a shadow of what they were supposed to be, and the fact that they communicate with Adventure already tells us that the ability to mod them won't be anything like previous games. Mods won't have any kind of control over the game world. High level enemies across the map and endless warfare level spawns have been killed if these are all the private servers we're going to get. Or if they will, communication with Adventure will mean that premium users will be legal cheaters, if they can just say, access the console on their world and then flood the economy of non paying people making everything we used to trade worthless.
---
Inflation of the 556 ammo market is already going to hit all kind of barter marketplaces, and it'll only push people offering weapons and stuff to ask real money for it.
---
Let me guess, you get the "something unexpected happened" error?
---
Yes, but defamation isn’t, and it’s a pretty thin line between the two. Usually whoever has more money for lawyers gets to decide.
---
0% of the playerbase I have seen had it. So what does that prove? Nothing. Of course there are going to be some idiots, but is a few people paying for 1 month of 12.99 and then cancelling it straight away worth the thousands+ people who will never buy a Bethesda game day 1 if at all? And the many YouTubers, and Redditors, etc. who now have vehement resentment for Bethesda because of all of it,the crashing buggy game, that is still not completely stable a year after release, the canvas bag, the Nuka Dark Rum, the Atom Shop items that are not purely cosmetic, etc. People are not going to forget. They are now out there in comment sections all over the internet spreading their disgruntled opinions. And a few shills giving themselves gold isn't going to change that in the slightest.
---
Your special
---
No I haven't I don't have a ps3 controller anymore and I can't get ps4 controller to work right. I would love to finish 3 and new Vegas. And sorry I am now upset I wasted $ and I was just looking to see if it was just me having this problem or what
---
it's a known issue. I've been over it extensively but nobody cares. I'm always downvoted and called an alarmist, because people expect me to record every single second of gameplay, waiting for something to go wrong.
---
I'm assuming it's a server sync issue. basically what the server is seeing isn't what you're seeing. so it assumes you have the pipboy open for example, except you don't. and you press the reload key, which is also the drop key while the pipboy is open. so it drops whatever is highlighted at that moment.
---
but you'll only notice it once it's too late, on fast travel or upon your next login. you can apply atom shop skins to mitigate the issue. on PC, rebind the reload key to whatever you prefer (I use T) and physically remove the R key from your keyboard.
---
The problem is that it’s not setup like normal paid servers are
---
What Bethesda is offering don’t function how most private servers work, they are more Akin to having someone pay for a private player hosted game in Minecraft
---
For starters most pay for servers are dedicated - meaning they run continually and are hosted by the company selling them 24/7
---
Games like ark survival evolved, rust, and other survival games have a similar server system which allow players to host the server from the device they play on, this is called a non dedicated server - which requires the host to be playing the game while other people play on the server
---
What Bethesda has chose to do is make these private servers hosted by Bethesda, and then only allowing them to run when the host is playing. The reason this is dumb is because it’s taking money from consumers for something Bethesda ultimately didn’t have to spend money to give us because they could’ve made the servers hosted from our devices
---
And btw If Bethesda gave us proper private servers I’d be 100% down for this package, but it’s taking advantage of a large group of people, and locks people from content that was sold as a fix for a manufactured problem. The atom deal is pretty neat though, I just hope they sort this out properly.
---
It's pointless - MANY already paid their real life money for this and sadly MANY more will do. No matter how many posts we write on reddit or official forum. And to be honest no one can blame them - it's their money, they can spend it on whatever they want. And honestly, who are you to tell them what to do with their money? Leave them, let them enjoy their junk vanish, unwanted guests on their "private" worlds and other surprising attractions they'll encounter sooner or later ;)
---
Blame fortnite
---
It used to be a normal thing for all MMOs actually
---
I can wait. I'm not going to rant or anything, but I put that game down a couple of months ago and I'm glad. It was like a bad relationship. I didn't realize how much time I was forcing myself to be frustrated, rarely ever accomplishing my goals due to glitches or dcs, or simply getting no drops for my trouble. Maybe the next Fallout title will actually work.
---
So what happens when nobody buys anything? Does it get what you want, or does it just mean fewer devs who still have a requirement to push sales?
---
Well, 1 month is okay to try it out. I would consider you a moron if you bought today a yearly subscrption knowing how litlle constent there is curently.
---
You’re entitled to your opinion. If you don’t see value in the subscription, don’t buy it. It’s that simple. I’m not buying it either because I don’t see the point.  I don’t consider the game buggy as hell through. At least in my experience I can now play all day without a disconnect. There might be slight lag occasionally, but I experience that with any online game these days. All bugs I experienced 12 months ago are gone, so I’m happy. I’m sorry your experience is different. 
---
Which bugs are still causing you issues?
---
How many vaults will be added before all the actual ones got open?
---
Yes indeed they’ve gone back on their word and lied to their customers, i dread the think what’s in store next. Like you say they’ll go back on everything. Imagine supporting a game with $100 a year or $13 that’s taking that route. 😬
---
People bitching about the lore of the outfit are missing the point. People wanted outfitsbfrom previous games.
---
This is $100 bollocks.
---
Haha, that's just lovely, buy a server to yourself, be randomly attacked xD
---
This is exactly why I didn't buy this fucking game. So disappointing Bethesda. I'll never buy a game from you guys as long as I live.
---
Bethesda created all the problems in the game from simple bugs to limits on your max capacity and how fast armor or guns break down. The solution they provide to these inconveniences they created is not solved by playing the game and finding cool/rare items but is solved by using your wallet to obtain exclusive convenience items for an inconvenience they designed...
---
I bet people will find away to use all those features from subscription without paying for it?
---
Why ? Because Bethesda.
---
I've enjoyed this game playing it like a SP game. I've yet to buy atoms, but have managed to acquire maybe 3k+ through challenges that have allowed me to buy things I've wanted.
---
While I see no reason for me to buy the sub, if it'll turn into anything like ESO+ where its pros far outweighs it's cons, then I'll reconsider subbing.
---
People see the scrap box and think P2W. How is it? You still need to find or buy the various plans and blueprints to craft the best weapons and armour, so having all that scrap means nothing without them.
---
Gamers these days see anything that remotely resembles a cash grab and grab their pitchforks. But then there's others, like myself, who can see that most of the time it's an optional purchase.
---
Yup. When they said that Private Servers would eventually have mod support, I immediately thought about Creation Club
---
It truly is disappointing
---
Do you only carry one weapon? Lol
---
I’m sorry to see them do to your fandom, as have been done to so many of mine. I’m even more sorry to see those in the comments who brush this off because it doesn’t affect them, which is honestly the most pathetic excuse not to care about something, and is the exact kind of complacent attitude Bethesda is hoping for in response to this.
---
For example, yes. There is an advantage there regardless.
---
Yeah fo76 Reddit page is blinded by rage
---
That makes no damn sense, whats the point of private server IF its not private? Do they have to be friends or can they just be in the list of people thats on the (adventure) server that you either did not except as a friend or requested to be friends with?
---
For me saying i cant see into future that makes me a fanboy
---
Doesn’t need to, and at least the sales numbers won’t be inflated by lies, broken promises, falsely represented collectors editions, etc.
---
It’s easy to get sales when you lie, but eventually it becomes a question of how many of those people can you continue to dupe to sustain your business long term.
---
From what i've seen from now seems like your friends have to join you, you can't invite them
---
Or you could kill the SBQ and farm up dozens of the better Repair kits that fix your gun to 150%...
---
haha you are naive.  
---
They didnt write anything since a week. And probably wont for the next weeks or so.   
---
Community managers never answer in these cases, except if the game company is a honest one (usually, such shitshows dont happen then)  
---
They arent trying to keep the spirit up, they are trying to keep you interested so you can throw your money at them.
---
I don't, but suit yourself. It's your money, spend them as you like...
---
I was going to take a break from F76 for TOW anyway.
---
The [Nukacrypt Devtracker](https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker) shows they've fallen silent and have only written routine messages since the maintenance began yesterday.
---
They are probably just assembling behind the scenes to come here with unified talking points knowing they'll be chased out of the park.
---
What advantage does the collectron provide me? I leave it unlocked and never empty it. Anyone who visits my camp could help themselves.
---
Or we have jobs that pay well.
---
Imagine not being able to take a joke
---
I had a weird dream last night that my testicles were talking to me. They were saying "*That $100 a year is totally worth it*" and "*It's completely fair that paying players can have unlimited storage*".
---
I said to them: "*You're talking bollocks!!*"
---
Carry a second weapon... or 6 like I do..
---
*Blizzard has entered the chat*
---
I figured if i dropped it accidentally it would prompt me as they were both favourited? That's what is confusing me more than anything. I'm sorry this has happened to you too. Nothing alarmist about it. When you lose things you worked hard for you have every right to be upset or angry. I know I am
---
Nope it's optional.
---
I'm seeing many of these threads. The mods need to sticky a post so at least people are aware this can happen until Bethesda fixes it.
---
Private servers, at the very least persist without the owner being online.  These are sessions, as they dissapear when you leave, unless someone else in the session is a subscriber.  So let's call them what they are.
---
I got it when it first dropped and was pissed like everyone else. They took some time, fixed some stuff and it’s turned into a halfway decent game.
---
Why on earth, when they still haven’t fixed everything, do they think we’d pay anything?
---
It was an example. Obviously I could but you can see exactly what I’m saying.
---
I hope somewhere down the line they put in a offline mode like steam has to wear you appear offline to your friends but you can still see them.
---
Doesn't that seem dumb or am I wrong?
---
I didn’t even make this, I found the link on 4chan /v/ board
---
It may not be a realistic comparison but people will still make it.
---
To get a 3* legendary Fallout 76.
---
im not even surprised, they're just gonna act like this didn't happen as long as the fanboys continue to buy their stupid "utility" items and premium membership that comes with a butt rub from Todd himself.
---
The scrap box is only for scrap and it's bugged atm
---
Eh, keep in mind the last three releases for bethesda haven’t done well. They’ve had fo76, rage 2, and wolfenstein, rage was the only semi decent one and it still didnt do great. On top of this they delayed doom until next year
---
You were down voted because no way would Bethesda be that fucking stupid that they would charg.... oh. Ok never mind. Carry on.
---
So it's normal to release the game (without indicating a future pay to play element) and then introduce one? Yeah, try again.
---
I mean honestly I kinda enjoyed it for a bit. I liked just wandering around shooting things collecting loot and building but kinda got bored after a while then put it down for a few months came back and still the same experience but I never really hated it. It was decent. wasn’t my favorite fallout game by any means but it was just okay... but this ... I can’t defend this lol I mean if this was an MMO with a great user experience and plenty of content maybe you can justify it. IF the perks of having the subscription model were better. But this isn’t an MMO. It’s not ESO. ESO is actually a good game and they can justify having a subscription model in that and it works but it won’t work in this. I don’t know what their thinking.
---
I don't. I have already bought the game. There is nothing new added. Why pay to do what you have already paid to do? 
---
Also are you happy having to pay monthly just to not disconnect or get screwed out of legendaries due to poor game mechanics? 
---
As for bugs: endless firing noises are still in. I randomly fast travel to different locations than I clicked on, grafton mayor won't shut up (although i hear this was fixed yesterday). I have friends who swon't play after the power armour bug (fixed I know but the damage was done). I have a bunch of challenges that won't complete, and conversely my daily and weekly challenges frequently auto-complete without giving me a reward etc etc. As much as I want 76 to succeed I am not subsidising a monthly fee because the devs couldn't make a game that could support itself.
---
A shinning beacon of calmness in this crazy, bad time. You sir/madam (delete as appropriate) are a star, cheers :)
---
This is the icing on the cake. For me one of the worst limitations of this game. The most annoying thing (Especially as Pete Hines promised, no stash limit as he knows). And it was just a another scheme. They could have fixed shits months ago but they just kept taking the piss on us so they can sell the solution know for 140 USD/year (exchange rate in my country).
---
you are a horrible person for even thinking of putting money in this shithole.  
---
at least ESO is a good game, with real content and shit, that somehow(!!) makes it okay to pay a sub fee.  
---
FO76 is a buggriddled, badly designed, unfinished, contentless game and they still want the same money for it.  
---
And you are ready to pay that. It amazed me
---
The problem isn’t simply the price (Which is quite reasonable if they gave us actual private servers)
---
What Bethesda is offering don’t function how most private servers work, they are more Akin to having someone pay for a private game in Minecraft
---
What Bethesda has chose to do is make these private servers hosted by Bethesda, and then only allowing them to run when the host is playing (kinda like private sessions in GTA 5). The reason this is dumb is because it’s taking money from consumers for something Bethesda ultimately didn’t have to spend money to give us because they could’ve made the servers hosted from our devices
---
Edit: btw If Bethesda gave us proper private servers I’d be 100% down for this package, but it’s taking advantage of a large group of people, and locks people from content that was sold as a fix for a manufactured problem. The atom deal is pretty neat though, I just hope they sort this out properly.
---
Why? I don’t get it. Do people like playing dress up that much?
---
"You've experienced step one of Wastelanders, and now, with Fallout 1st one year subscribers only, get ready for the second Chapter, reclaiming the Capital Wasteland"
---
Yeah that is true but after finding a fat stash of gear next to the purveyor and trading it all off left me fully geared and maxed on pretty much everything i'd want.
---
Not sure if you were around for my post about it. But this post was mine:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d608ae/always_check_stashes_in_the_world_never_know_what/
---
Wait, are you seriously going to defend this crap by comparing it to another piece of crap that you are already “used to”? Damn, no wander Bethesda are trying to pull this off.
---
Or an xbox. I get a years game pass cheaper than the FO76 season pass.
---
not necessarily, you can even scrap legendaries this way for example. it essentially ignores all prompts. the difference with atom shop skins is that they don't even show up in vendor and scrap windows, so it's safer.
---
or so I used to think. yesterday I lost a bunch of gunpowder just by stashing it. the server was acting up, so I'm assuming the package just got lost. which means we can essentially lose any item at any time, just by moving them around.
---
the worst part is that Bethesda has the tools to retrieve them, they just refuse to. lost 2 legendary pieces this way and their response is always the same.
---
It's not pay to play, it's optional, as annoying as it is the base game is still exactly the same as it was before this premium stuff. Also all the updates are still free, no paid DLC.
---
I know I just wanted to take a jab at 1. How low the price for 76 has dropped and 2. Bethesda's bullshittery
---
 This is the icing on the cake. For me one of the worst limitations of  this game. The most annoying thing (Especially as Pete Hines promised,  no stash limit as he knows). And it was just a another scheme. They  could have fixed shits months ago but they just kept taking the piss on  us so they can sell the solution know for 140 USD/year (exchange rate in  my country).
---
yep, and if you look in the "new" section, you already see the first people comparing this shit to other bad shit and are saying "look, it could been worse, buy it, its a good deal" :D

I don’t get disconnected now... lol. 
---
These “bugs” you are talking about are so minor lol. I was hoping you had something real to share vs an audio glitch.
---
oh look they deleted his post just like they deleted mine. They’re trying to silence the community as hard as they can and are deleting new negative posts before they gain traction
---
 I know I just wanted to take a jab at 1. How low the price for 76 has dropped and 2. Bethesda's bullshittery
---
Can you elaborate that stash/junk management with premium account? I will make my 800 lbs stash more space even after membership ends after 1st month?
---
I thought increased stash limits, camp building budgets and other things would be one time purchases in the Atom store. Like "increase your stash 200lbs for 1000 Atoms". You could keep buying it, adding 200lbs each time. Or adding additional build space each time.
---
I did see being tied to the game through a subscription coming.
---
It's only going to get worse from here on out. The repair kits were the first fucking step. But these sheep are too blind to see that.
---
I voted with my wallet.
---
 I am currently loving unlimited scrap and my mini camp tent.
---
they do when it's the NCR ranger. it's by far the most request outfit since release.
---
so of course they'd use their trump card now.
---
I'm looking forward to Blizzcon.
---
Oh, I'm not looking forward to any of their games. It's just going to be a shitshow with all this China stuff.
---
I bought a one month sub to try it out. A lot less lag there. It's pretty much all upside lol
---
I've played this game by myself too and gotten things like Blackbird Paint, Stalker Armor and Survivalist Armor by simply playing the game.
---
The main issue about the Scrap Box is that currently stash limit is a huge gigantic problem that is now affecting anyone that got use out of the Legendary Vendor 50% discount, i literally had to build 2 different CAMPs just to get rid of how much junk i was hoarding (even if it was just materials, it was a hell of a ton, and i'm still at max weight), which could've been added as a free addition and something amazing for every single player in this game, especially those that build CAMPs.
---
The reason why people grab their pitchforks is because this did not happen that often in the past. You bought a game for 60 bucks, and everything on that disc was obtainable, now for Fallout 76 you need to pay 60 dollars (more like 15 nowadays), if you're playing on console you gotta get a subscription to play online, then you need to pay 15 bucks minimum a month to get all of these advantages.
---
Not to mention the Vault Boy being used to advertise all of this, even though the character was made to mock big companies and their mascots, ironically on the day that the bombs dropped in-lore.
---
Not just that but they steal them poorly like an evil genie. If at the very least they stole the communities ideas the way the community comes up with them. But no they gotta corrupt it somehow. "We want servers like Minecraft! Download serverfiles, set the settings, maybe install some mods and have some." Bethesda"Yup, but we host it, you don't get to tweak settings, and mods MIGHT come at some point in the future maybe, if we feel like it. Probably. Also it costs 140$(for Europeans)"
---
Sadly for them, this is their job. They don’t have to like it but they have to keep going and earn their paychecks. Can’t say I agree but I do understand.
---
76 isn't an MMO. It's not massive, servers only hold 24 players.
---
Again, like the kit, a very minuscule one, but even smaller. I can collect more scrap in 1 minute than that could in 1 hour. Not to mention the fact you paid for cut content that should’ve already been in the game. They also said anything from the shop would’ve been cosmetic. They went back on that word didn’t they? So what do you reckon they’ll go back on next?
---
fuck yeah it's gonna be red shirt guy times 100
---
Ya they have said a lot that has turned out to be bs. This game was only going to be buy the game and get free dlc for life. Also with (cosmetic) items..... now look what's become of that. Lol BGS has come up with more ways to sell you stuff. But has yet to improve the game. 
---
Every one keeps talking about wastlanders and how good it's going to be. But No one looks at the past. What Dlc have they come out with. That's has been bug free or has not been a crap shoot? My point Is yes it kinda a free game but the only good things they have come out with you have to pay for now.
---
Yes but monthly or we will lock it away again!!!
---
Why? What’s the big deal? Honestly lol. I don’t think there is a single outfit that would make me say “ooo I just have to have that! Grrr I am so mad it costs $”
---
I've seen nobody defend this, it's a bullshit argument. They are karma farming.
---
I noticed my AP last night too. I have three AP pieces and never have a prob with AP. I did notice my Gat gun was using AP every shot which I never noticed before.
---
Regardless of whether you think they are minor or not, they are indicative of a game that is poorly made and one that doesn't deserve monthly support. As you say you are entitled to your opinion and if you want to buy something twice over (and some) then that's up to you.
---
For real? Your just that stupid that you thought it would auto do things for you? For real?
---
&gt; farm the crap
---
This.
---
I've used 1st for three hours yesterday, visiting classic locations, to find the differences and it's more easy to loot in 1st.
---
Flarwoods gym? All the lead there at the first try. Same for all resources.
---
Golf Club? All ghouls waiting for you. All the loot untouched: golf uniforms, mags, acid...
---
Asylum? Everything untouched. I finally found one the super-rare unifirms after one month of fails in the overfarmed public servers.
---
LMAOOOOO
---
For example if I had only 1, there still is an advantage.
---
People who make 6 digit salaries don't play videogames. But nice try anyway, little Jimmy.
---
Oh, my mistake. Sorry for that. 😉
---
Your disposable fire money can be used for infinitely better things. Go donate to charity. Go buy someone a meal. Buy yourself a meal. Buy a new game. Buy a coffee. Hell, just burn the damn money.
---
Don't give it to these guys. It's not that they don't deserve it; they absolutely don't, but the point is that you spending that money shows to them that "It just works". They can put out whatever system they want, priced at whatever ludicrous amount they wish for, and people will buy it. So they'll do it again, and next time, put even less effort into the content.
---
Just please think about the people who don't have a disposable income, that number increasing by the thousands every day, and think about the people who may or may not have said income, but wish for the games they play to actually be good. Impulsively buying this sort of "service" shows that they can keep doing their bullshit and keep on getting away with it.
---
We have to band together if we want change. It's a one person thing, it just means more when a lot of us do it. It never hurts to try.
---
Make no mistake, in a week those same losers will crop back up and defend this shit show. It's happened since the beginning.
---
Todd promised me things, i couldnt say no!
---
Thanks for the actual response! I know I probably sound sarcastic, but you're the first person to actually do so, so I really do mean it. 
---
If theyre only active when the host is playing, wouldn't that be functionally identical to how ark and rust , to use your examples, have theirs set up for solo players? It'd obviously be a different story for group players though, unless servers dont go off once the host leaves. 
---
And seeing as character stuff is stored on their end and not locally, I don't know if letting someone host a server on their own system would really be possible with their current infastructure. It'd have to go through their end regardless. Would certainly be nice, though. 
---
The way that I see it, though, is that people have been asking to rent private servers since launch, and now they're getting it, along with some extra goodies. So I don't really see the cause for the outage.
---
They were transparent and I agree with their guiding principles. If we never let companies and services evolve Amazon would only be selling books online lol.
---
Yeah but it would be awesome for the rp groups that have formed. I have more roleplay in the game on discord than I do the actual game.
---
Seems like they could use A LOT of improvements, this being one, also you can't kick people out of your server, you need to block them or remove them from your friend list
---
but those repait kits was 100% useless, so who cares
---
Blizzard and Bethesda are at war for who can be the stupidest publishers of 2019.
---
I dont see a reason to make this post, you brought nothing new to complain about
---
Oh yes i almost forgot, if you didn't know they're gonna add Riot Gear through the Atomic Shop in a bundle, plus Desert Ranger armor (a faction that doesn't exist for another 40 years) with Fallout 1st if the strings are correct.
---
Imagine being dumb enough to fall for their scam 😂
---
it's just iconic(tm), I guess. I don't know myself. I mean, I like it. it's cool. kinda tacky. and it belongs in NV. but people are obsessed with NCR rangers for almost 10 years now.
---
it's definitely a great way to peddle these passes if anything.
---
Nah. First it's too soon, second it would lock out too much potential. My 5 bucks say they'll go the ESO route. After Wastelanders every new update will cost money to unlock, 5-10 bucks depending on the size, but Fallout 1st Members will get access for free.
---
Yes, you know for a fact that they are the same people! I congratulate you for your ability to deduce crap out of thin air.
---
Nerfing private worlds will go over well, but i suppose the other option would be to nerf Private and normal servers which would be worse.
---
It'll be interesting to see how they balance this issue they created for themselves.
---
You didn't posted it to praise mod but to show of that you bought 1st membership, prove me wrong...
---
Start sharing this and copyapastas of their claims
---
Something like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m17X7oWpYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m17X7oWpYY) ?
---
I was planning on paying it monthly for a whopping 144 Dollars, 100 Dollars seems like its a catch!
---
Yes, they were useless to us. But it let them test the waters to see if they could add more shit.
---
There is none. That’s the point
---
Unfortunately the world has changed.   
---
Remember ESO?  They had to drop sub requirement to save the game, in favor of crown store and ESO plus.   And ESO wasn’t nearly as bad of shape as FO76.   Like ESO, Fallout has a ton of IP/lore and a large fanboy/girl following (same might say rabid).  UNLIKE ESO, Fallout 76 seems to be managed by amateurs or perhaps like some of my management friends they simply have no budget to do it “right”.
---
The real problem here is quality of game.  This game is being managed like amateur hour at the high school.  Sure, they will eventually fix many of the glaring bugs, and maybe implement a test server before it’s too late, but like most companies nowadays they half ass and only do the minimum because “no resources to do it right”.  “Throw it out there and see what sticks”, etc.  
---
Am I the only one that wants to sub for that Scrapbox (love the game, defects, warts, and all) but KNEW it was going to be fucked up so waited? Lmao
---
What happens if you store a metric ass ton of junk in your stash and then cancel your sub... Will your junk now gain weight again.
---
Ah same here! I play the game in German and he would speak English to me all the friggin' time (it didn't bother me though, I was just confused at first lol). Yesterday's update fixed it though. Is he speaking Italian to you now?
---
If people enjoy the game then of course they're gonna pay. I bought a one month sub because I don't know how long I'll be playing the game for but I have 1500 hours in it and like dicking around in Fallout with friends. I think people are just upset not everyone is going along with this "boycott" lol
---
I’m sorry but private servers were not standard in the old games because I don’t think fallout 4 3 or NV were online games. Scrap is easier to store then the large items, Scrap doesn’t weigh very much and is used all the time.  
---
It doesn’t take very long grind atoms and even if you at the very least complete 1 challenge a day it would add over time plus the Atomic shop gives stuff away for free.
---
They didn't lie about the Stash limit, it's the same thing that happened in ESO, junk is easy to catalogue server side as there are only a few types of it, the number of those types don't make much of an impact, but unique items like armor, weapons and other bits all have a ton of unique modifiers and that's what puts strain on a server. 
---
In ESO if you pay the sub you can store as much stuff as you like as your sub is essentially paying for increased server capacity, I would not be surprised that after a few months FO 1st members will have access to an unlimited STASH rather than just scrap, but they need to use the extra cash to bolster the servers first.
---
It's an expensive endeavour keeping a live game active, especially one with a shed load of unique items and loot. 
---
Don't get me wrong I think it's a high price and so far it's not super worth it, and they could have announced it in a better cash in with more communication rather than drop and run.
---
I personally feel that in time this premium membership will help stabilise the game and allow for more and better content.
---
That is literally every single mobile game.
---
Going into a mobile game and not expecting a cash grab waste of time is just naieve.
---
Everything I've read says it comes out the 25th. Got a source for that? I just don't wanna give out the wrong info
---
But did they outdo EA this year? I'll be waiting for Jim Sterling's video of the worst things companies did in 2019. This year is glorious!
---
Yes, but i see the point: The must have utility items have to go in the subscription. Those things are to valuable to be sold. Renting them out for a monthly fee is far more fun and exciting for the community.
---
You realize almost nobody plays Xbox anymore right?

You can list the exclusives on one hand.

---
The clearer weren’t  transparent because they have already gone back on what they’ve said and lied to their customers..you know the ones that pay their bills. Saying this company is evolving is false. How can you say this is evolving when game companies have already tried antics likes these, failed, learnt from it and now moving on knowing they shouldn’t pull a stunt like that because in the long run it’s bad for business. The industry is changing and BGS are failing to change with it. It’s bad news for you.. well you I assume really
---
it was a yuge card, lemme tell you that
---
Like I mentioned above the new stash outfit and tent are cool but other than that I don't know what to say about Bethesda anymore
---
Think about this way. U dump all of ur junk in it, freeing up 800 lbs from ur stash, allowing to use 800 lbs more. Now, u wait for the month to expire, and u been throughout the entire time, u been collecting junk on ur stash box non stop. The game will not let u put anymore junk on it, however that does not mean ur junk is gone. The game at this time, will prioritize the junk on ur Scrap Box rather than on ur stash whenever you craft anything, until it empties it out. So u can in essence, pay for this for 1 month, empty ur stasj and fill up the scrap box, and then stop paying, and keep playing normally from there on.
---
Don't be naive.
---
No, really? Thank god you told me. I was going to get out my card and pay.
---
link?
---
Great job missing the point.

“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs." - Peter Hines
---
You’ve been bamboozled, if you think you’re not playing a game that isn’t vastly over monetised. But I suppose you’ll just say “it doesn’t affect me” and that’ll make it all ok
---
What's ypur psn ima buy a sub this weekend if you want to try a server...
---
Also claimed there would be no p2w or season pass
---
I think the game has improved a lot since launch. Used to get disconnected constantly, now I can’t remember the last time I was booted. I have enjoyed the content they’ve added, fastnacht, lying Lowe questline and subquests, pioneer scouts, nuclear winter, burrows. We are all entitled to our opinions but I’ve enjoyed what’s been added and look forward to the future. I can’t think of any good things locked behind a paywall. Maybe the tent? Not a huge deal but this is probably the online good thing you have to pay for IMO.
---
perk kits, prestige/legendary player system, wastelander... all included only in subscription.. offcourse wastelander will be renamed to expansion so no "paid dlc" promise will be kept
---
Not really tinfoil just cynical business sense.
---
Or just dont buy the subscription thing lmao not so hard
---
Just depends how viral it would get.
---
Agree with most of this, but the scorchbeast king thing is just stupid. They wouldn’t add another endgame SB boss a couple months before the scorched plague ends. And that would be barring off actually content if the majority couldn’t fight a boss.
---
I quit after 3 days after launch, then came back 2 weeks ago and started leveling a character just in time for wastelanders. Or so I thought...
---
The problem is that it's hyperbole. You don't \*HAVE\* to pay for the subscription. You aren't pointing out any bullshit of a company when you over exaggerate the situation.
---
Who would ever only have 1 though? Lol. That’s an absurd unrealistic example... hardly worth being upset about.
---
Yeah I bought two. One for me and another for a friend.
---
I’ol cone backnto htis wjne im sober
---
They are supporting the company that is screwing us all over, that's how.
---
This would be a good thing in many countries, but not in US. 
---
US companies can take you to court knowing they have no leg to stand on of they know the trial with some light obstruction would take long enough to bankrupt you through legal fees. Then they "lose", and you "win" and yet end up with a debt for several lifetimes-worth of work.
---
Beth took it down, in all likelihood.

Lol. Game is poorly made because of a couple audio bugs? Wow

---
By the way Bethesda shills. Nice one giving Gold to someone who just used the term "slanty eyed" in a previous post. Top notch shilling.  https://imgur.com/JjYlbcK
---
There would be people out there. I’m not upset because my point was proven 😄
---
Then TESO and any other Game with a Service like that would be a "mobile game". You are just an Entitled, Butthurt, Twat. Nothing more
---
You get all the DLC, but not the Expansions. Things like the Imperial City, Thieves Guild and so on that are also paid are free for + members. 
---
And i'll guarantee you after Wastelanders they're gonna take that up too. Watch the next gameplay addition after Wastelanders cost money to non 1st Members.
---
It's Is a mmo. Its a mini multiplayer game
---
i heard that private worlds are more stable then regular free to play mode. so go accomplish your goals there
---
What updates? We had 1 significant content drop since release. It was a quest that took less than an hour to complete. The rest were patches and bug fixes which every game has. The best thing they added was player vending but it was advertised before launch and we all expected it to be in the base game. The thing that could’ve made your comment have at least some value was delayed for another 3-6 months.
---
Well, might as well join in
---
I haven't logged in yet since maintenance yesterday ended late and today I am at the University the whole day, but it's good to know they fixed it.
---
For some strange reason they wrote about localising Grahm's meat week subtitles but not about the collectron lines in the patch notes.
---
It's upset about 9000 possibly more people that we can SEE. Maybe your stupid for letting companies walk on you because you are so weak, that you can't find motivation to fight back against even 1 thing.
---
The argument against this:
---
"*Yeah but you're on your on world, so they can give you more stash because there isn't other players and their stash.*"
---
The counter argument:
---
"*...but there are other players, it's been shown that they are just invisible. They effectively blocked the other people but you're still on the same server... so it's not a technical limitation.*"
---
Ffs.
---
Good point
---
Yeah. Same. But now we have a bunch of good games coming out to fallout 76 is dead to me for a while.
---
I still want it to be great. The idea of playing wastelanders on a private server with a bunch of players who RP is still an exciting prospect. But I’m not sure the game will ever get to that point anymore.
---
What “stunt”? Lol. You sound like you just want to be angry at this point.
---
they should make it free for all WV relatives
---
Probably
---
I'll be honest, I'm a buyer of game items in general. While not necessarily a "whale" I'm retired so I buy lots of games and lots of stuff, because it's fun.
---
In FO76 though, I've only bought Atoms once, when they had the summer sale, 1500 Atoms for $10. There was just never anything in the shop that was worth it. I earned enough free atoms to buy everything like PA paints, hot rod station, plants, scraptron. I don't have the fridge, don't see the need.
---
If someone like me wasn't buying, I don't know who was. Which may have lead to the subscriptions. The Atom shop never offered much appealing. I mean I bought PA paints with earned Atoms and don't even wear PA 😄

---
oh such an intellectual you are, please enlighten us :(
---
Honestly, seeing what failure they'd come up with next was more exciting than the game itself. Managing to fuck up near weekly even after half a year is impressive to say the least.
---
ok but that didnt answer the question.
---
so can you maybe give 2-3 examples how this is screwing us all over? i just try to understand
---
&gt; but it still doesn’t even finish delivering core gameplay due to bugged story line quests that remain unfixed 
---
Care to be more specific?
---
That's what they get for supporting Bethesda screwing us all over.
---
I'd go to the store and ask for the covers instead of the bundle, even if it was more expensive
---
There are still no season pases or paid DLC... no quests are locked behind a paywall. No story is exclusive to premium members. No weapons or armor are subscription only.
---
I don’t think anyone just takes a picture before they upload everything in a “secure” stash
---
I wonder if all the variants of the Ranger armor gonna be Fallout 1st exclusive, or if maybe the green ones will be available in the Atomic Shop
---

Can't you take a joke?

Man, this is serious!  Thanks for making me see the error of my ways.  What a selfless, white knight you are.
---
I waited for this outfit to be in the shop for a long time, I saved up to 4,5k atoms to get it and now I'm 'a little' dissapointed I'd have to spend real money for it. So I'll have to live without it - cosmetics are not worth my real money...
---
Neither loading for me right now
---
It was a game changer for me since my stash is always maxed out. 80 mags and all the bobbleheads on display and now I don't know what to do with all the stash space.
---
It really isn’t absurd. There are people out there that play with one gun. :) again you’re trying to call out how I feel, again you’re wrong. 😂
---
People who defend companies are the people who bought something from that company. And if the product turns out bad, but they paid for it, someone can't accept the truth, tries to deny it, doesn't want to look stupid to other people for buying the shitty product.
---
How has your gaming experience been negatively affected?
---
I am going to visit http://www.falloutfirst.com now
---
Obsidian, same guys that created Fallout and made New Vegas made a Fallouty rpg called Outer Worlds coming out tomorrow. It looks really good. They couldn't make an actual fallout game cause they sold the rights way back in the day.
---
&gt;some people don’t whine about everything
---
But here you are, whining about the community's response.
---
Waaait, I just read your comment thoroughly. It's 5am almost im half asleep, my bad bud. 😴

I like the vault raids :(

It doesn't get you mods.

Also your character with the right skills can call out Myron on his supposed invention of Jet.
---
There is a sizable (We hope) DLC drop with Wastelanders which many believe to be akin to a soft relaunch of the game, similar to No Mans Sky's Next update, that was actually released almost 2 years after release with minimal content ypdates befoe it, but it totally revitalised the game and it's been going strong ever since.
---
Sorry, you don't get rewards for stupidity
---
More people playing last night than I've seen in a while, and a large portion of my FO76 friends have purchased the subscription.
---
More bullshit to accommodate the non PVP crowd.  People whined about TSEs?  Nerf.  People whined about camp damage?  Yep you guessed it.   People whined about survival mode?  Gone. 
---
For all of the campers and hoarders and grinders congrats you got your wish yet again.  Fuck this game I’m out.
---
I bought two copies of the Tricentennial edition for £76 ea with bobbleheads, I was raging
---
Hmm want to say Graham... Or watoga. Check the. BOS bot at superduper also. It's a 10k plan at "normal" with drugs and charisma maybe 8.5
---
Man fuck that 'one year free subscription' bs. I bought on launch *because* the store was going to be strictly cosmetic and servers were said to be a *feature* to be delivered later. If you bought prior to this announcement they have no goddamn right making you pay for anything in it, *ever*.
---
The way I look at the annual subscription is lying $100 for 19,800 atoms. That’s half price. I personally don’t buy atoms, but people do. And for them, this is a deal.
---
TESO is a pool of every possible monetisation method, lootboxes, payed DLCs, convinience items, cosmetic items, mounts, pets, skill trees, classes, dungeons, story, animatiins, payed sub, b2p, EVERYTHING is on sale in TESO. 
---
It is an OK game, but it could have been a great and awesome game, if they doubled down their greed for player money. Imagine selling a torch in a immersion based fantacy game? TESO does that.
---
There is literally a class action lawsuit for false advertising. They made false advertising and took money then didnt deliver on it.
---
Fair enough, I thought they were uninspired, glorified fetch quests with sub par rewards.
---
I defended the shit out of the game at first. Played it until around March of this year and then just kinda lost interest because of the lack of progress that Bethesda made
---
Then the non-cosmetic items kept coming into the atom shop and I was turned off of returning. Then a hardcore content drought happened. Now this
---
I have lost faith in Bethesda at this point
---
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong I think it's a damn high price to pay and no incentives for those who have already bought the game, try could have handled it better.
---
If they are whales it’s probably because they have good money management skills. That’s how one is able to become a whale.
---
The thing is you get to keep the outfit and emotes after you cancel the subscription so for many paying one month is extremely similar to paying for an atom outfit bundle. The pricing is quite close too, I remember it was around 14-15$ CAN for a bundle vs. 17.99$ for one F1st month. So many likely subscribe for one month to get the stuff and cancel afterward.
---
It would be interesting to know how many stayed subscribed for the whole year.

Funny thing though. We have sales numbers from a number of publicly traded companies. We can see sales down on games, year on year, as their reputation tanks, and they develop more and more unscrupulous methods of monetization to recover the losses, and cover the large investment of development and running costs of server upkeep and maintenance, in the vicious cycle leading to even more lost customers. Those companies are completely different from game developers/publishers, with a very different demographic audience/customer base. Gamers are informed, vocal, and networked online. When the real boycott happens with organization, the greediest publishers won't know what hit them.
---
I’ve was shutting my vendors and locking my door at camp when I saw a ranger gear player stroll in.
---
Literally all of those games are highly acclaimed and personally I've logged 1k and siege and tf2.
---
Its definitely not a lot of people. But check my history.
---
You don't have to pay each month to play it though.
---
You're 28 and talk to people like this?
---
Ought to be ashamed of yourself.
---
What a flawless system, God Bless the US and all that jazz.
---
Could somebody paste that in the comments so I can comment that on their twitter
---
I guess I was hoping to pay for content, not atom store micros.
---
You go to your favorites wheel, then hit (Y on the XB1) to whip it out and place it.  It doesn't cost any caps to place.  It has everything you would need except a bench to break down armors and weapons.
---
Then don’t buy them? I’m sorry you wanted it, but if you don’t see the value, don’t pay. It really is that simple. That’s how capitalism works. Consumers should drive demand.
---
Yes Watago vendor bot Phoenix has a chance to have the plan
---
Chance of success, 0%
---
Because they know that everything will be busyness as usual in a week or two. People complain, but rarely follow through. Also the people dumping the game is lower than the people still playing and buying things.
---
The subsceiption isn't hurting the game because you have people that eat, shit and sleep this game 24/7 regardless of how bad and poorly designed/buggy the game is.
---
The game is low cost to then, wastelander won't be the be all end all for the game. And guess what the sub came out first so the subs would pay for wastelander its just financial logic.
---
But PR doesn't need to step in because its not forced and people move on/bite in regardless. The discontent isn't as massive as to hurt them in anyway or form.
---
Now that's a fallout fan. Good on you, sir.
---
And that's not to mention the fact that they're hiding an armour behind a paywall -  the same armour that Obsidian made - on the week of their newest game. What a bunch of assholes.
---
But a private server is me hosting it. It my server on my upkeep!
---
How hasn’t it? an example would be how the 556 round now means nothing in the trading community (which I use myself to trade) because you can hide in a private server away from the PvP and mass produce loads.
---
idc about private servers, I was actually surprised they added atoms to that deal too. but the fact that they are offering fucking unlimited stash and free fast forward point does not make any fucking sense. they also just said atom shop will sell more utility items aka expect canner, ammo converter etc at this point. it is not just cosmetics, it is a blatant lie to argue its just cosmetics, they are stripping core gameplay features and selling them for subscription members. instead of fixing the game and adding more content, they are pumping this shit. FO76 is in no state to support a paid subscription model even without its p2w additions and please don't say stasher is not p2w. 
---
also they could've added custom settings or at least waited until wastelanders. everything about this is terrible.
---
The pint-sized Slasher outfit was a Atom Bundle outfit I believe, and the Skeleton Outfit’s gonna be a NW reward available for completing some challanges between 10.29-11.05 I believe
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
I have never met someone (and I team up with a lot of people) who when their weapon breaks don’t have a back up and need to retreat. This just doesn’t happen.
---
I have, loads of times
---
Pay to win? Win what?
---
 Am I going to beat you in some imaginary contest with my large amount of scrap components?
---
 Or maybe beat you with my tent campsite wearing a Ranger outfit?
---
 If idiots could fly this reddit page would be a freaking airport lately.
---
scum like you, makes that honest people, when asking for fair requests, find a hell of problems...
---
Actual content is free...
---
I know. They're also humans.
---
They aren't enough to justify 100 bucks (even more in euros) it's fine to try 1 month get your atoms your outfit and see if it's worth to you. A full year without no server customization at all and max space for 7 more friends seems like a rip off to me. Yeah you have less lag and no one's bothering you and your events/legendary stuff, but that's it. Seems really really worth now? Not even a bit
---
Only the junk in the scrap box is weightless so the junk in your stash wont be effected.
---
Megaphones, like old maplestory. Text chat is area only, but you can broadcast server wide with a one use item!
---
I'm in the same category. No doubt the story might have been good but DAMN, that desert is the most boring world i've ever seen. I just liked the feeling from Fallout 3 much better.
---
I know
---
Probably taken down by bethesda damage control, OP please add the archive link:
---
Nope because Bethesda couldn’t spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what benefits private server gives the player.
---
I have it have...the events pop more, alot more and the drops ive been getting from a fresh server have been amazing with 0 lag and better legendary hunting by far... Purveyor drops have been above average. I enjoy meeting other people to but its got its perks to it.
---
sorry boi you didnt nuke anything. bethesda did
---
How about now?!
---
Are you going to find him like liam neeson?
---
I know, I won't buy it. All cosmetics so far I wanted, I bought for atoms I earned playing so if they won't allow this outfit to be in the shop, I'll have more atoms for something else.
---
Try again.
---
Know the feeling, I am also enjoying some last laughs. Was banned from beth-forum many times for speaking my opinion. You become "spam" over there if you do that.
---
The thing that worries me is that the sub was obviously supposed to be released along Wastelanders, hoping it would get enough goodwill to make a sub acceptable. The fact they still pushed it out without any real content backing it up means they're desperate for cash. I wouldn't be surprised if their investors pull out by next year and the game gets scrapped.
---
Oh you are one of those people who enjoy overpaying for weapons and armor. Got it. Yea I don’t support that type of gauging. I just sold a bloodied FFR combat rifle for 1500 caps. It didn’t cost me anything so why should I charge someone 50k caps or 5.56?
---
Awesome work. You're an artist and a prophet -  " you’ll still be able to access any microtransaction points you received as well as the resources stored in your Scrapbox, if we dont delete them first." Bye bye scrap in shiny box.
---
This is what I kept telling people, thank gawd someone has a brain amongst the non-playing crowd.
---
Basically it's a "pay or don't pay, doesn't matter either way" scenario where the only real benefits is the scrapbox which in reality isn't exactly a huge benefit considering you don't really need a lot of X Y Z scrap in the first place n the private server to enjoy playing with friends without hassle.
---
Lol. Yea ok. Sure
---
So you disagree with the premise that being able to set up a tent anywhere, and having infinite storage for your junk gives you an advantage over someone who didn't have these things?
---
I'd hope they're covered by parody laws and the fair use definition.
---
I think the phrase "people get annoyed" can be put after pretty much anything at this point.
---
To my mind, mostly cosmetic items, that are completely optional, and which you can STILL earn slowly if you don't want to buy them, are about the most reasonable, low impact, opt-in way to fund things like maintenance, and people are still *furious*.
---
I guess any constructive dialog about this is going to be modded down.
---
I’m curious how the in game economy will react if people begin playing exclusively on private worlds supply might dip.
---
I have no idea why people would subscribe now, if wastelanders came out I'd have a hell of alot more time for it.
---
Why would you pay extra money to do the exact same shit you've been doing since launch?
---
Thank you for clarification. First "happy clients" who have lost their junks in the "unlimited" stash are already emerging, so I think it's another argument to pass on paid membership ;)
---
and?
---
Not sucking a dick of a multibillion company that was proven time and time again to be nothing but a bunch of lying, greedy assholes not giving a single fuck about their video game franchises, fans and customers is a circlejerk those days? 
---
Ok, got it.
---
And you get a second camp!...cool new emotes, unlimited junk...free atoms that pay for itself, discounts, icons and Outfits...for me its ano brainer
---
I cant wait too! Especialy in my country, where 100$ is literaly more than a half of a Living Wage.
---
&gt; This only suggests that you see what you want to see. You raised doubts, then proceeded to solve them by means of your own, personal opinion on the subject only to conclude with an absolute statement which is supposed to be the ultimate truth. But which is unfortunately based just on your opinions, not on facts.
---
Yes, my opinion and how I go about expressing the logic I'm working with. I believe it's a reasonable one, and wanted to show how I think it is.
---
My, "ultimate truth," is my argument; Bethesda is being unethical, and if they're enabled by a successful subscription service that is going to be an issue. Our opinions are what we have to work with here, and even if Howard or Hinds come out and say, "We're putting players above profit," there is evidence that can reasonably be interpreted as their telling lies.
---
So if you disagree with my opinion; you could tell us either how Bethesda is being ethical or how their being unethical is not an issue.
---
Do you get the atoms upfront or are your daily atoms increased?
---
Well I am not a dumb massive hoarder, so yes I disagree.
---
What content? We are a year in and have nothing of size or substance. A lot of people compare 76 with ESO. But ESO had 2-3 expansions and a free high level zone full of endgame content by this point, including dungeons, quests and MP/solo trials. You are going to be paying to play the same thing you have played for a year.
---
Who said that?😂 Again, you’re trying issue me with a false reputation, 4th time and it hasn’t worked lol. I make sure I always get a fair deal unlike you with this Sub Serv. Why? Because I can. 😂👌🏼
---
down already?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Not a big thing, but it's stupid to hide those changes. 
---
"crap collector rates balanced" added in the patch notes, and no one was to say a word.
---
Thank you so much for teaching me what morality is.
---
Oh bud, if that were an option for me
---
Yep 😄
---
If you purchase Fallout 1st Membership, your account will receive the best security - for just 15€ a month!
---
Probably a charge back from their bank.
---
ah.  
---
I thought I read there was a limit 8.  or at least, thats how I interpreted the line about the server "owner" could invite up to 7 non-paying players to join...
---
my warped logic being limiting the number of players would allow for increased per player storage...
---
ha, fanboy talk.  
---
the stash limit itself is wrong and if they cant programm a game that can handle that, they shouldnt try it, or ask indie dev prices.  
---
because this game is indielike
---
I had the same experience OP. I tried telling people the scrap boxes were a slippery slope, and Bethesda were gauging our response. Everybody defended it and look where we are now.
---
It's the sourest I-told-you-so ever.
---
Did you quit ?
---
Voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir
---
 Am i special then?
---
Thanks Bethesda, very cool!
---
Everyone has their lines. Bethesda crossed it multiple times for me in this last year. Your line is further than most.
---
You get them immediately.
---
We have been running on “hope” since the release of this game. All we got is a giant middle finger and a slap in the face. You really still believe Bethesda care about this game? After they made it pretty clear that they are going to push even more p2w mechanics in the future? After the shameless switch to a subscription model in a $60 game that is riddled with bugs, exploits, cheaters and devoid of content?
---
Deserve it for paying into that trash.
---
Ouch.
---
It’s how that market is once you’ve been apart of it you actually see it’s pretty fair. No gauging here.
---
Way to overvalued this stupid game. And don't get me wrong I like 76 but there's a lot of stupid going around.
---
This will probably be unpopular, but I don't see how you can complain about the price.  Don't get me wrong, there are many things about this game I wish were fixed, and the 'Pay to Win' aspect is certainly there, however have you ever paid for a hosted server for another game?  Minecraft, Ark, Conan...they all cost more than the ~$8.33 a month this will cost you to run a private server, even for that small number of people.  Is everyone upset that instead of going to some hosting company, the money goes strait to Bethesda? Plus to you get all the other bonuses, including more money in Atoms a month than you are paying.  Complain all you want, but if you ever even though of running a private server for a game you like, this is the BEST deal going for any current game.
---
you guys knew this was coming, yet the cult like following defended this game to no end
---
How can they take something down when they don't own the domain
---
There’s no harm in waiting, at least see if they add anything or keep it the same for a week or two
---
Well, the next thing, I think, will be payed big DLCs, with a words "we hear you and now the game will have big DLCs with a big amount if content, as you wished. New story in Mohave desert for only 89,99$"
---
It’s a trainwreck and havnt stopped yet. Bethesda decided to build the rail while driving the train full speed.
---
How do you win anything with this, its just convinience not pay to win
---
Yes, win being able to outbid my 556 ammo offer in the trade subs because you have unlimited access to the ammo plant or infinite stash space to hoard materials to craft it.
---
Win being able to farm alone all kinds of things bringing down the value for me non paying user, in an already excessively inflated online economy where I can't afford to buy a weapon because caps are worthless already.
---
You paying for these servers actively and negatively impacts the game of non premium users, I'd say that's the definition of pay to win.
---
More ilke 50% to 2/3 by the end of my session.
---
Tldr: this sub has been, yet again brigaded.
---
If people buy it, bethesda will think they are doing the right thing. Then they will lock more and more stuff behind a shitty subscription that is P2W. This service needs to be boycotted. It's an insult to all of us who have to stuck with the game to this point.
---
Not sure about $100, but will dip my toes in with $13.  Might even pick up Neverwinter VIP again while I'm at it.
---
It happens alot. Someone tried to hack my Ip last week even tho i have a Ip bouncer connected to my internet box. I seen them on my desky so immidietly pulled my internets power then waited 20 min to clear the ip.
---
Yes lol!
---
It’s back up! Get sharing👍🏼
---
Don't have an issue with private servers being paid for, its standard.
---
However its basically paying for a private session, which is shit. If the servers were persistent I'd be on board.
---
Lol at the guy who excitedly gilded this thread like YEAH MAN TELL EM BETHESDA RULEZ lol i guess its a better investment than buying FF
---
22 a month in Aus, 180 a year
---
And to think, all Bethesda had to do was give us dedicated servers to host on our own machines or reputable licensed vendors (ex. like g-portal) and this could have been avoided.
---
We've been asking for almost a year now. Bethesda are such greedy, lying, scumbag morons.
---
Why would you buy a year's sub? Sure it sounds like a better deal than a one month sub but I doubt you get all 12 month's worth playing this. Is it because $100 membership sounds worse than a $13 membership when you guys make these posts?
---
Just you.
---
I'm guessing/speculating that these premium users wont barter in 5.56 anymore and now it will be the materials to make bullets. Why hold onto 300,000 of 1 type of bullet when you can hold less mats and trade in that, and they can craft whatever type of ammo they want. 
---
We will see "AAE Gatling Plasma wtt for 100k copper" soon enough and only people with Fallout 1st will have the option to buy these items.
---
Fuck outta here with that shit
---
What do you mean never follow through? I quit Fallout 76 a few months after it released. I came back just a week or so ago. Now I will probably be quitting again. I didn't buy Anthem. I didn't buy Fallen Order. I won't be buying any more Bethesda games. When you say people don't follow through, that sounds like wishful thinking, from someone who doesn't want people to follow through.
---
THIS. I can't agree more with being civilized. I feel like the Devs are *somewhat* listening to player's requests and demands but without clarity, it can be all jumbled up and come out not to people's expectations.   
---
For example, I've seen a lot of people ask for Private Worlds. Just private worlds. And they delivered that but not how people wanted. If the specifics are wanted, then I think they need to be clearly stated. Otherwise we'll get something bare bones like what we have now. People screaming and boycotting isn't gonna make the game better. Be clear, be concise. Look at this subreddit for example, there are more community manager responses to clear and thought out posts instead of the ones with all caps. Just my 2 cents.
---
Les YouTubers ne veulent plus rien dire de toute façon
---
Share them. The wayback machine isnt working
---
&gt;We can see sales down on games, year on year, as their reputation tanks, and they develop more and more unscrupulous methods of monetization to recover the losses, and cover the large investment of development and running costs of server upkeep and maintenance
---
So you're saying sales are down, the company is facing a loss, and needs to find some way to pay for server upkeep. 
---
So what's your answer then? How does the game keep going if it's making a loss and incurring further costs? 
---
A subscription model would seem to be one way of the 'costs of server upkeep and maintenance' but you've labelled anyone who pays for that as an idiot, so what's your solution? Put yourself behind a desk and look at this situation, and tell us how they turn things around and make a profit.
---
No. I used my junkies explosive handmade I got off purveyor...
---
Same here. I leave it unlocked just like my water purifiers so if anyone needs they can take. I just like having the bot around my camp.
---
Wow, you're trying really hard aren't you. Sunk cost fallacy has really set in for ya.
---
This is an actual complaint. Pls file report.
---
I don't disagree with the cost thing, but that's because I generally don't find cosmetic mtx appealing enough to spend money on, especially considering you can earn the currency in game. 
---
But, I'm not everyone. Other people think a cool outfit or neat thing for their camp is worth (insert price) and decide to get it. And that's fine! If they feel like it made the game even a little more enjoyable for a little amount of time, then good for them. 
---
Something else to keep on mind is the game is a live service game that's been out a year (ish), and hasn't had a paid update yet. Gotta keep the lights on and, more importantly, the devs paid  somehow, and I don't really consider $10 a month is all that offensive. Even less so when you consider they don't do loot boxes. And I get the argument of people being saddled with financial troubles, but those kinds of people probably aren't buying atoms or the subscription anyway. 
---
To be completely honest, the only thing about this id really  change is letting there be an option to buy a 1 month sub for atoms. 
---
And you're good lol, Its almost 8 am for me too and I'm feeling the tiredness as well
---
'Brave' chill a little bit, they aren't exactly facing adversity if they lose a few upvotes
---
I dont bother reporting it now. Gets tiring. I didnt realise about scrapping. Legendary items font tend to come up when i scrap weapons. Hoping this is still the same. Can't skin pipe rifles or dragons i dont think?
---
if you grind for a week you essentially have infinite junk and ammo. don't even need to keep subbed.
---
if removing the micromanaging aspect of the game isn't p2w then at the very least it's one hell of a convenience.
---
I also love that they announce the delay in Wastelanders and the a few days later announce this stupid sub plan. Like just grind that salt in the wound. The 76 player base is the biggest group of masochist in gaming.
---
Can’t get anything better?
---
27c per day. A hobo can find that easier than you might think.
---
So, I *do* actually understand databases apparently unlike you.
---
The reason is that more junk items just means incrementing a value in a row, this isn't the database getting larger, simply the values changing.
---
On the other hand, unstackable unique items like weapons are *a new entry* (or row) in the database. It is here when the database is literally getting larger, and thus takes more computational power to handle.
---
Being able to hoard infinite resources absolutely gives you an advantage over other players. Here's why, it's not a single op thing, it's a lot of little things adding up. 
---
-You will never have to decide if keeping junk on you to make use of weight reduction perks is necessary. Thus your chances of losing resources to other players is significantly reduced.
---
Bethesda's already screwing you twice with FO First...
---
For me, it’s because I like the robot dance more... :)
---
Read the thread. Apparently not
---
Do you even play the game? genuine question.
---
...Or do you just like to ride the hate train until it spirals out of control to attack people who actually have jobs and disposable income willing to keep a company afloat so others don't have too?
---
why are you trying to sound cool
---
Hey, we have to save humanity starting with video game costs.
---
What would be better? I enjoy it.
---
Gotta be this
---
This has just happened to me and I’m on PS4. Out everything in there, including over 100 flux. Was fine earlier and now it’s gone. Scrap all my bulk to out in there too 😓
---
YoY sales are down across the entire tech sector, especially software and hardware. Publicly traded gaming companies are no different, however their earnings postings continue to beat expectations, save for a single quarter from EA which was a narrow miss (most on the market would call it even). ATVI has posted 4 solid beats in a row.
---
I've never been a fan of this micro transaction modal. Give me back my subscription based mmo of 15 years ago and I am happy. Maybe the industry cycles back to that. Regardless, online gaming will always require a maintenance cost that the consumer is going to have to foot the bill for in one form or another. 
---
20+ years of online gaming and at least another 10 years on top of that with offline gaming, I can say there are maybe 10 games in total I purchased that were worth their retail price. 
---
Yes there has been a massive influx of new and younger gamers over the last few years that are eager to buy up any repackaged republished garbage that gets put out whether it is a CoD game or a NVDA card. That fueled this niche of the tech sector to a peak, but it was also riding the tails of a raging bull market as a whole which has been steadily slowing for over a year now. 
---
Guess what I'm trying to say is this is how the pendulum swings. There is nothing new here. What slows down or dies off today will be the new best thing tomorrow.
---
nah. from it.
---
I subbed for a month, mainly because I am a sucker for Halloween and subbing for a month was cheaper than outright buying the atoms in order to buy the new bundle. I probably will not stay subbed though
---
they were the start off the end!!!!
---
indeed. don't think there's a skin for either, no.
---
Yeah. Preordered it and played it since the beta. a free year for the people who preordered the game would be a good thing.
---
If you have ever played any other fallout game the camps/home bases always had infinite stash limit.
---
FO4 especially because it actually had scrap in it.
---
I wouldn’t say “we are losing what this game is” I would say “We are starting to get stuff that makes it in to what it used to be.”
---
Although they should have given the scrap box to everyone imo, or do the same with the ranger outfit and give it permanently to players who buy the sub at least once
---
Looks like bethesda got it shut down
---
They weren't haters, their criticism as valid, and they were right where this was going. :|
---
With this magic box you will free up more storage to store guns, armor and aids items, I call that pay to win and it is a huge advantage.
---
Just because you enjoy it doesn’t mean it’s better. I could say the same for this Sub Serv. just because you enjoy it doesn’t mean it’s better. Which is obviously isn’t lol, especially for long term business.
---
Bethesda ignores new vegas: "C'mon Bethesda! Give us what we want!"
---
Bethesda acknowledges new vegas: "You didn't even make that game! How dare you!"
---
But seriously, thanks for the heads up. People have been asking for more iconic outfits and the membership costs about as much as the outfits would sell in the atomic shop, plus the atoms and emotes.
---
No, the membership is optional as it is.  You only "need" it if you really wanted to play on a private session and we knew since October of 2018 that it was going to require a subscription.  
---
People are already saying they are seeing a ton of people running around with the NCR coat, lots of people bought into this.  The protestors on reddit are such a small % of the overall playerbase.
---
I didn't talk about me.
---
Half the time it does that, the other times it downloads but just fails to install
---
yeah and look back at the sub ever since the game came out. it's the same shit every time bethesda does *anything*, and there are people still playing.
---
Oh really?
---
I'm closing to 2k hours of play, spending in the game 4-5 hours a day, on trade subreddit closing to 900 karma for successfully finished trades. And it's my second account - first I've lost with 800h+ of play. So yes, I play this game maybe even too much...
---
It adds very little *now*, in games it was tacked on to. But when it is part of the very structure of the game? With Bethesda's current MO, they'll have literal paywalls in the game. "Pay 99 cents, or hike halfway around the map to get 3 feet to the left."
---
I don't use any trade subs. If it's not in game I don't bother with it.
---
 The only things I buy and sell are on player vendors so caps are a mandatory monetary unit for me.
---
 I have a ton of God weapons for my build and really good armor. I have never used a trade sub. 
---
They all came from before I bought the 1st sub.
---
 I am paying for convenience, not to win anything.
---
 You are over exaggerating.
---
This isnt an answer to my question, totally unrelated
---
It's a PVE game...
---
The ”private” servers are just new worlds created by the sub players, same servers as adventure. (Which is amazon servers). The cost is for more data which goes both for ”private servers” and ”unlimited junk”
---
XD WHAT A GENIUS
---
"This time the backlash surely will bring change!", says the man who thought the same the last couple dozen times as he keeps throwing money at Bethesda.
---
Private servers, on their own, wouldn't be a big issue - other games have paid services for private servers. The problem arises when other things are bundled in with the subscription and aren't offered as a separate purchase like the new tent system or the scrapbox.
---
Don't worry, I got the Nihilistic Arby's nod
---
Its not winning anything its just more convinient
---
Can you guys test if this bug is repeatable and if you lose junk even if you log straight into a private world? I am at work and haven't logged back in yet.
---
Bethesda shut it down looks like. Crazy how quick they are to respond to shit like this but don't comment on anything the community is concerned about.
---
No, because its optional and they will simply shut down the game. Basicly all this overly dramatic posts are doing nothing but advertising the subscription for them. 
---
You are free advertisement, nothing more. Most people complain but are just loud Barkers, and roll under the table like timid dogs afterwards.
---
Boycotters never follow through, and because everything is optional your not hurting them in anyway period.  You don't want to pay for content then it was a matter of time. Now that actual content is coming they are pushing out the optional subs.
---
Crying loudly about it does nothing, but advertise, nothing you do will change anything because even if you do follow through, majority won't. This isn't EA, at worst they'll put the game in maintenance mode and just focus on Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield, because people will buy those regardless because the ones complaining are in the minority and the ones taking actions are in a bigger minority.
---
When its forced its one thing, but its optional and not needed. So no not much will change, this isnt Battlefront II where you were forced to spend to get any kind of progress.
---
The things is it isn’t “pay to win” for those of us that could give a shit/don’t even participate in PvP
---
Ah.. Why's my shit not gone? Explain your bug plz
---
Even if its peer to peer you still get to play with friends Which i have more of then the game allows in a group and only one needs it till the one who has it gets off. Sure it has its flaws but why would they be suckers to play with friends on a game they already have? that makes no sense since single player gets boring.  I understand where everyone is coming from but im still entitled to my opinion about the whole thing.  as a side note where do you get they want to play single player anyways?
---
Its convinience and not win to anything
---
Sales are down because they were greedy assholes who released a buggy broken game. That was their choice. But hey Todd Howard says there are millions of players. So they must have made crazy profits on those game sales. Sales will continue to be down for any future releases, because people are sick of this shit. And server upkeep costs isn't really that expensive. The marketing and shilling costs are WAY more. First step fire those fuckers, who do much more harm than good.
---
It will be interesting to see the number of online users before and after release of Outer Worlds. Can imagine a large proportion of fallout fans will have pre-ordered.
---
I think you underestimate Reddit. There’s a few whales around that make shit like this easy.
---
We already knew the playerbase of this subreddit was fractured because people moved over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
Even if at some point it did represent the community, when people reach a certain level of toxicity you just increase the resolve of those who were directly opposed and people on the fence get pushed away because they don't want to be associated with the toxicity.
---
Thank God for Outer Worlds 
---
Bugthesda can officially eat a large, steaming bag of dog shit.  Of all of the time and energy (and real money) I’ve invested in this game I am tapping out.  There are no limits to their ineptitude and greed.  Everyone should simply give them the middle finger and bounce.  Continuing to play or worse yet pay the 100 just reinforced their bad and unethical behavior.
---
Good to know. I'll be interested to see how, if at all Bethesda respond to this upheaval.
---
So me denying a thing that has nothing to do with what i said makes me bad
---
I may pay for just to try it out for a month BUT, paying more than what not only for the Xbox game pass and what I paid for the game itself (whish was at half price). I can't see paying $150+ for a year especially for a server that's SUPPOSED to be private that is NOT private
---
JFYI, there was a precedent on PC, where CS eventually recovered the account and the items. Have an upvote, so you thread would hopefully get some traction.
---
I know I'll probably get downvoted to Oblivion, but at least I can farm some Daedra while I'm there. 
---
I'm not really understanding the anger.  Free market is about offering a product and those interested in the product buy it.  I absolutely detest pumpkin spice latte.  I don't detest the stores that sell it.  I just don't order one.
---
Looking at the features of the product, I see the added value for certain types of players.  If you buy atoms regularly, $9.99 gets you 1100, $9.99 a month gets you 1650.  Added value.  If you're a junk hoarder (I am) about 600lbs of my stash is junk.  The rest is ammo and a few legendaries I don't want to part with.  Would I pay for a 600lb stash limit increase?  I probably would.  Every month? Well probably not then, but if I buy atoms fairly regularly, I'm still getting value.  Honestly, this seems more like the Amazon Prime model than a PTW model.
---
Private servers.  Make this cross platform and I am YOUR man.  I understand why cross platform is an issue playing with pvp options, the skill floor for keyboard vs /xbox controller vs ps4 controller is pretty extreme.  But if I'm doing a group session with friends on consoles, I don't care how good their control setups are, it's not a competition at this point. I do PC not because of any Master Race BS, but because my degenerative joint condition just makes KB+M and a upright desk seating position more usable for me. 
---
 Right now, I can see one major competitive advantage to Private Servers, and I'm not going to spell it out.
---
And here they all are. 
---
It's the EXACT same 'Premium' service they're using for ESO with the addition of private servers yet their Reddit group isn't overrun with people crying about it.
---
If you guys got off Reddit and got jobs $13 wouldn't put such a cramp in your budget. Oh, I forgot. Most of you are already struggling with the $8 subscription to Xbox live or whatever console you play. Just tell your mom you'll mow the backyard unless that's what you already do for your PSN  money and you're afraid if you ask for any more money she'll kick you out of her basement. 🤔
---
Keep up the good work though, all your crying is OBVIOUSLY having an effect because 5 out of 6 camps I went to last night had their scrap boxes. 👍 Mitches.
---
Why are zero of my pipes gone? I.fucking collect them... Pay way too many caps. Why are non of mine gone!
---
Ah well...there will be...maybe its why it's doing this....? Or maybe thats just me being cynical...
---
Actually, there are many games whose sales are just fine. Because they don't release buggy messes, and they don't try to gouge their customers/fans for every penny they can. No we are talking about a very specific group of publishers and game franchises.
---
FinalRender will be playing with the bethesda Fallout crew later today on a Twich live stream and they will be talking about all so be there and u can talk to them.
---
Tbf so does renting a server for Ark and Conan.
---
I am so disappointed that the private servers ended up being 8 players! I was really hoping to see some PVP networking. That's the only thing I was really hoping to see with private servers.
---
BOHICA! 
---
Bend over here it comes again
---
Skyrim had bad storytelling? You must have only played side quests...
---
Anyways, on topic:
---
I am in the same boat as you...minus the friends. I may buy a one month when I get some time off, so I can put all my scrap in the box, along with get the outfit, but I won’t be buying it regularly or even digging into the server until they add more stuff.
---
They said it will have persistent servers (ie workshops) so you actually get your own, not an unused public server (LMAO FUCKERS) in the future, along with maybe mod ability and server settings.
---
In conclusion, I would recommend what I am going to do: buy one month, use what stuff you can (fill the scrap box to the MAX) and get your outfit (and atoms!) and then un-subscribe until they add more stuff, or price drop and such
---
I agree.  It doesn't need to.  It's a niche game for a niche audience, just like 76 is.  But people are comparing OW to Fallout when they post topics like this, and it reminds me of the days when people swore every new MMO coming out was dubbed The WoW Killer and then it sold poorly and went F2P in a year.
---
they have no reason to, just look at all the idiots clamoring to defend the game (and this service). bethesda through this entire disaster of a game still has diehard fanboys who will defend the game to no end.
---
That would be true if it was a full private server. From what I’ve read once the host or any other people who pay the fee leaves everyone else gets kicked. That’s exactly the same system Minecraft on Xbox one has. And it’s free.
---
Well, good or bad is subjective. However quality can be measured. This is not a quality game or service.
---
You don't know much about game design do you?
---
Ra-ra-fight the power!
---
So what's upsetting you guys again? Apparently a completely optional addition that gets you...?
---
No advantage, cuz Adventure mode is non-competitive PvE.
---
OUTRAGE! ANGER! ENTITLEMENT- no no, don't shout that last one out loud.
---
I do love my sex tent.
---
Tell me where I can store unlimited materials for free. I'd love to know.
---
That glitch everyone say coming.
---
Sold well. Ok tf2 has a cult but the rest are commercial wins. Very different.
---
bethesda polishing a product? bwahahahhaahhahahahahaha
---
there are 10000 other reasons why they delayed the update but polishing is none of them
---
Grow up. Not about you or your pipes. Legitimate concern. If uou haven't got anything helpful to say...don't bother
---
I was going to play TOW anyway and take a break from 76. With Cyberpunk coming in April that break might be permanent. Darn shame too because I love the Fallout universe. The game really started to shine for me when player vendors released. I had a great business going. All I wanted was more stash space. I don't even want private servers. Have a location stripped clean and going to "secret" places for mats was part of the fun. The sub model just isn't for me.
---
Never go full fallout 1st.
---
At least for me I haven't uninstalled the game since launch so... I think it would be the better deal. Plus it's almost 50% off. If you pay for 7 or more individual months your screwing yourself. Because for the same price in 1 lump you could have gotten 12. So if you are going to get this service the 100 is the better deal by a wide margin. But also if you don't play this game a ton you shouldn't get it at all.
---
Also a heads up to any PC or Xbox players you can get it for a dollar via game pass and get to try it or if you like it purchase it for the full price.
---
How about what now?
---
Can't wait to hear what they pre-prepared, anyone taking bets on how many times they'll mention "death threats", "toxicity" etc.
---
but the stuff that is locked behind extra payment isnt really necessary to have fun in the game? and the people who pay for it wont have the ability to screw your personal experience with the game.
---
My GF doesn’t have the “gamer mentality” but she spent hundreds of dollars in League of Legends just because she is having fun and feels the developers deserve her trust. She doesn’t even care about other games. What I am trying to say is that people will buy stuff if they are having fun. To say that Fallout 76 players just want free stuff is a lie and a way for Bethesda to run from their responsibilities.
---
I genuinely pity you
---
Such a massive disappointment. Really put the nail in the coffee for me with FO76 and honestly made me lose what little respect I have for BGS as a company at all. Used to be one of my favorite developers but it is very clear that they only care about money and not making a good game. They are delusional if they think it’s a good idea to add a subscription to this largely broken game.
---
The Xbox game pass is for pc as well.
---
Luckily, I've only run into benevolent gods. I've gotten a few guns that were well beyond my level at the time, but at least they didn't just give me the bullets.
---
How are they gonna fit this in with the existing lore though?
---
Oh wait...
---
That didn't age well
---
Yes, there are people saying that they have noticed 1/3 to 1/2 of the people they have come across in the NCR outfit, that means that people are buying into it. 
---
I'm planning on paying for it, and so is my friend.  I had been waiting for the private sessions since day one so I don't have to deal with other people and can just play the way that me and my friend want to.  Everything else it's coming with is just bonus (especially the atoms).
---
... And PvP.
---
K bye troll.
---
Already have. I can't explain something when i have no idea as to how it happened. All i know that they were no longer in my inventory. Noticed they weren't on weapon wheel first as bith favourited
---
Yeah the Peter Hines quote seems to be the only thing that some people use as a reason to be mad. A rental server that adds nothing to the game is not content its an optional service. I mean technically you don't have to pay a penny if you are willing to grind enough of the dailies and weeklies.
---
why do you so desperately want to believe that this game is good?
---
This is why I don’t gameshare.
---
All the constructive feedback we have given so far has been used to add paywalls for the things the community wanted.
---
This is no time for constructive things.
---
Oh no I was one of them, that’s just what we were referred to. :)
---
Probably overloaded with traffic right now
---
The early TOW promo videos one of the first things in the video was a huge graphic "From the maker's of Fallout New Vegas..". It was hard not to connect the two.
---
Never bought the game in the first ace because of the reviews.
---
This would indeed be a smart way to implement this greedy service. One year might be pushing it, but one month is more realistic and evil. The more would defend them and later on just keep the sub going lol..
---
that’s a terrible stereotype lol
---
Hah! Those are lies!
---
why yall fighting for this lame ass shit game. Just never buy another bethesda game
---
Why do you people keep playing a game that is supposedly so awful? This is coming from an outsider who has never played 76 but enjoys watching all the hate Bethesda gets for the glitchly mess they release. I sunk hundreds of hours into NV and 4 so I am quite familiar with the Fallout series. But I waited on 76 and then decided to skip it completely once I started watching clips of how unfinished it was upon release.
---
Cool, see you when ES6 launches
---
I will actually gathering info right now to make sure im not the only one and clearly its the way it was set up which makes no sense. So we will see..thanks
---
TO BE HONEST and at this point it is hard to give beth any credit BUT they could add it as a halloween costume? and they are not adding a Caesar's Legion outfit, they are adding a Roman Legionnaire outfit. 
---
ugh feels bad to defend bethesda, do carry on.
---
   I already purchased the tricentennial edition from gamestop. I feel like the price per month would make way more sense on a free to play game model. 
---
 The main selling point is supposed to be the private server yet they give you very little options  of what things you can do with  this server (no special modifiers or even mod support and it also limits the amount of people that can join to 8 as opposed  to the normal 24. 
---
Arktos Pharma, the Imposter Sheepsquatch event, Scorched Earth and the vault raids are not really soloable so... 
---
While I guess the monthly Atoms are okay at least until you  realize the majority of microtransactions on the Atom shop are just plain overpriced  (especially for a non free to play game.) TBH You wouldn't even be able to afford a singular power armor skin. 
---
 Of course this isn't all of Bethesda's fault. The parent company pulls the strings.
---
I do however like the armor style and the additional stash space and I totally understand they want to make more money off this IP. It just feels like all of this just came too soon like if it would have came after a successful (bug free) launch of Wastelanders people wouldn't be so negative.
---
Like what lol? BETA!!!
---
They are.. but likely only because you aren't sharing it with 2 dozen other players.
---
You have to make sure you claim them in the atom store when you still have the membership but afterwards you keep them
---
LOL! Well, this Fallout 1st subscription shit is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. Not only I won't personally pay more for this game overpriced subscription, cosmetic B.S. and whatnot but I will be very VERY cautious with their upcoming title (ES6 and Starfield) and won't spend another $ on their upcoming crap before a very, very long time after the initial release. No more leap of faith from me.
---
"It's all free after launch" is the key line there.
---
I got mine from one of the vendor bot at whitesprings. I think it was the raider bot I paid 6580 caps
---
I sadly can't afford it. Enjoy it, it really looks cool to play on a private server. Have fun &lt;3
---
Looks like Bethesda had it DDoS'd though... shame.
---
You know I have sold All Rise more times than I can remember. It used to turn up in Watoga all the time.
---
 You need to set your Nvidia settings, I dunno 'bout AMD, to Performance in the Power Saving section and Fast in the Vsync section. Does make a difference. My RTX 2070 drives my 4k screen just fine and I have even inflicted Gsync on my Freesync monitor although it does not make much difference 
---
on a 75 Hz monitor.
---
 My game is fluid and smooth and my frames stay up there all the time. I did build this machine to play games though. ;)
---
Thanks for the suggestion bro 👊😎
---
I will buy atoms when I want to buy something cosmetic, but not the service even if it includes atoms. 
---
oh and that is if I still play the game tho. I'm actively forcing myself to stay away from it. As we speak, CoD is downloading in the background.
---
You forgot a battle pass for $15. But with a time restraint. They will let you buy tiers though so it’s okay.
---
I play it every day but I don't know where I'm gonna be in a year, I mean probably still playing but this first month was to try it out, feels good so far tbh
---
Perhaps less visceral than others who feel sour by Fallout 76 moving closer towards a looter shooter than a 'traditional' Fallout experience, I think that a lot of people in this sub do enjoy playing the game's core loop.    
---
However, this private server thing was one of the worst handling of a product release I have ever seen (low value product tied to subscription model in full price microtransaction game instead of expansion to be clear).
---
A one year subscription to Fallout First!
---
Unlimited scrap stash and saving 20~ caps on a fast travel isn't pay to win, and they're aren't stripping away core gameplay features. 
---
At it's worst, the stash just allows people to be hoarders without hindering anyone elses connectivity because the server has to keep track of everything in their stash. And the servers already have a hard enough job. The poor things pass out from exhaustion so frequently already. 
---
I don't disagree that the second, mini camp feels like a weird and unneded decision, but, like the stash, doesn't give anyone any meaningful advantage over anyone else. And if that 20~ cap difference is gamechanging for somebody, they're worse with than in-game money than I am with my real life money. 
---
And you might not care about the private servers, but that's primary draw here. People have been asking to be able to rent private servers since launch, and now they can. And they get some bonus goodies as well. The only thing I'd really change is letting someone buy a 1 month sub for atoms.
---
And my question still stands. How does somebody else paying 10 bucks a months for a private server and some goodies affect your personal, individual gaming experience? And no, just saying "it's pay to win" isn't an answer. Explain how
---
You can keep them.  Also if you trust the scrap box fill it heavy for a month until you cancel. You’ll no longer be able to add, but you can still pull from it.
---
This, along with bugs actually being/staying fixed. rofl.
---
Alot even tho they have ESO+ Still choose to buy the dlc's and every year to get the latest content are pushed to buy a chapter for between 30.00 to 100.00. So again the fallout first sub way better.
---
Yeah, I'm relatively new to both Fo76 (started the free weekend) &amp; Reddit (76 brought me here not long after) That just shows how little time it took for all these crying children to get on my nerves enough to say something. And they wonder why everyone hates millennials.
---
FUCKING LOL ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT KIND OF SHIT *IS THIS????* crazy that shit is so off the rails.
---
Thats priceless lol, who comes out with a service and not secure the domain, oh wait i forgot bethesda does!
---
I've not downvoted you at all, I've actually given you upvotes...
---
Appreciate the baseless accusation though.
---
https://i.imgur.com/omtFOu6.png
---
I was wondering why I couldn't access it. Jesus that was quick.
---
This is not pay to win smh lol. Like who starts crafting in the middle of a fight? What? Lol😂😂😂
---
ESO isn't free to play. You still have to buy the game just like Fallout 76. You also have to buy the yearly expansions. While access to the occasional DLCs are included with ESO plus, the expansions are not.
---
I love how when people hear pay to win they instantly think of PVP. You can have an advantage over other players in PvE, it's pay to win.
---
What is a better weapon that I should spend more than max caps on?
---
not having to worry about a whole chunk of the game sure is convenient, yes. having infinite ammo sure falls within that category I guess.
---
others may call it p2w but me, I prefer convenience.
---
All of you who still play this fuckfest is the real joke
---
Thank you for giving us a laugh
---
Yep, it's a new game targeting the same audience.  So far it sound alike game play and conversations are akin to fo3/fo:NV to boot.
---
I may play FO76 in stints in the future but I haven't and I am still not impressed by the secondary market they are trying to force into this game.
---
I play games because they are fun.
---
I don't play games just to impress my friends.
---
Yes a company is going to protect their intellectual property first before talking to a bunch of raging nerds. Any company would do this.
---
I cant believe you wasted so much time on this.
---
The subscription is for the voice actors and writers they never planned to hire.
---
Mmmkay. 
---
Bye now.
---
 No its better because I know all you idiots will be angry with me as I parade around in my Ranger crap. I can afford the money, I almost bought a year. ;)
---
Well i think they are similiar in a sense. I mean it has a renamed VATS. A person entering an unknown world after a set time limit. It's a 1st person RPG with guns.
---
Ill be buying my fist yr next month.
---
&gt;Explain your bug plz
---
already did. multiple times in the past, too.
---
Me too, where can I store unlimited amounts of junk for free? I had no idea I could do that, if that's the case all of this hate is for nothing bro
---
I think you mean none since server lag
---
If capitalism works right they will be the new best thing. Hopefully they can find ways to keep growing and keep the cash flowing without rushing things out the door.
---
I don't dispute fo76 being a buggy mess. I guess I just kind of expect buggy messes anymore with just about everything. I feel for game developers. There is no thanks and no light at the end of the tunnel. They take the brunt of the criticism when it is in fact management and executives pushing crap out the door long before it is ready. 
---
I am glad that I never got into that corner of the industry. At one point in life that was my goal. I'll stick with boring desktop software development.
---
You can stay by grafton and the whole forest region. Then go straight to Charleston and start exploring the whole toxic valley, then you should be able to push through the savage divide and get to the swamp, from the swamp you'll go to the cranberry bog and for when that comes you'll be lvl 45-50.
---
what do you mean "working", the benefits read like they could have been set up in a single afternoon
---
You literally do not understand the definition of the word literally.
---
Why the heck are you guys paying for this crap in the first place? No wonder AAA company get a free pass every single fucking time, people seem to love crap apparently.
---
Yeah go fuck yourselves
---
I haven't encountered one yet, but im looking forward tot he fights.
---
It depends, it's unfair if they actually get death threats, they don't make the decisions and are contractually obligated to spew BGS talking points, so I'm not going to mock them for that.
---
If that's a lie they try to use lo leverage compassion, on the other hand...
---
Feel bad for all you guys,  I was at the purchase screen for about 5 minutes deciding whether or not to buy it and at the last moment, I decided not to. Glad I held off and will now wait thru the apologies and patches to get it. I can wait another month or twotil they tweak it out. Seems like a damn rush job and then use the community as Guinea pigs.  Not cool, Bethesda. 👎
---
Hey, game dev here. Items are most likely stored as bytes. Int ID for the item, Int ID for the quantity. The amount of actual data/server space it takes up is very minute. The "600" they said before is so so so small. 
---
I believe the original size cap was either out of inexperience or straight up lying.
---
I don't buy Xbox Live and the extra cost is what turned me off when FO76 was announced.  It would have cost me $120 on launch day and $60 a year to continue.
---
Calling it now, companions will be a paid feature.
---
What does Bethesda and a Brahmin's ass hole have in common?
---
They're both full of shit.
---
God damn that shit is gold 😂😂
---
Just to let you know, every player on console already has to do this. Xbox live and playstation plus.
---
I got on just long enough to store my stuff, I checked it a couple times and didn’t have any problems but now I’m worried...
---
Is it only happening on private servers? Or both?
---
It's online tribalism.  It's the same thing you see with many other topics. 
---
The vast majority of the poo flinging is just to get praise from the other people in the same tribe (the Bethesda Bad Tribe).  It's not going to change the mind of people on the other side (and in fact, studies in politics show that it actually can just rile them up to be more opposed to you) and people in the middle find the toxicity obnoxious and are more likely to join the other side. 
---
In other words the toxic behavior is doing nothing but making the situation worse.  
---
Beyond that, I'm at the age where I've paid my dues to video games. I know what I'm doing.
---
Oh Todd, you did it again.
---
You managed to make people pay for server hopping, you magnificent bastard!
---
You dont really need unlimited materials, just smart storage and dont save anything you dont need
---
Is a storage box, or tent cosmetic? Can you wear either of them as a costume?
---
Well you could get a 1* Bloodied Handmade for 1000c which is more like your budget LOL and still hits harder than a JE HM, able to afford that? 😂
---
People are bitching about paid subs because it's egregious awfulness in a still broken ass game.
---
Dude I bought it for 80 since Tricentennial edition
---
You still need to get the materials for that
---
It's still up for me
---
Ooooo, this is really gonna make my Ultracite farming more profitable.
---
Yeah I'm not paying anymore money unless maybe it gets improved. At this point if wastelands is a flop than by Fallout for a longnd time
---
Not going to lie Bugthesda has been indielike since Oblivion in my opinion. The ONLY reason I loved the games since then were mods that fixed all their issues.
---
They laid a foundation but it has never been a finished product.
---
That being said, if these private servers are the only way to get 100% mod capability. I’ll be back, otherwise they can kiss my ass. I wont hold my breath.
---
The reviews so far are strongly comparing to fo3/fo:nv.  Character sheet driven conversation options, somewhat dark setting, and evidently has pseudo vats.
---
Oh yeah, a dedicated server with control over certain elements of the world like spawns etc would have been a huge money maker. Huge. It would have to be seperate from public servers, but it would still have been super popular.
---
You're also paying for server resources so I imagine they will fund dedicated storage servers (hence it being a different box) which runs the fetch and storage functions for the scrap box.
---
Bro, Todd is that you??
---
Can Bethesda actually do anything to get that domain name given to them?
---
Um what? 😂😂😂😂
---
My friend and I both bought this game at launch. I had the PC version and he had the Xbox version. We both enjoyed the game, knowing it was buggy but knowing it was still early and Bethesda would continue to patch and fix it up over time because they are a big and well known company. 
---
I understood the game was launched in just a very short time after Fallout 4, and it would have its issues. I played for several months, even going as far as buying it again on sale for Xbox so my friend and I could play together. 
---
But the game became too grindy and there wasn’t any real improvements made to the game. Each patch or small update felt more and more like Bethesda was ignoring our feedback and pushing some money grabbing scheme further and further on us.  The game continued to feel broken and it was not being fixed as fast as a big company like Bethesda was more than capable of. 
---
With this announcement of Fallout 1st their intentions are blatantly clear. They don’t care about us. They never did. This was all some big secret strategy to get us to keep paying more for their game. This was decided well before launch to be a micro transaction pay to win/pay to play game. They never intended to care for any of their players and they had no plans of making a game worth paying for. This all feels like some big dumb social expirament we were taken for suckers on. 
---
I for one have uninstalled both versions of this game and have officially given up on it. I don’t even want to talk about it anymore. I wanted this game to be so much better, but it is clear that will never happen and Bethesda has become a villain in the gaming industry because of it. I hope it was worth it guys.
---
Thanks for the offer, doesn't really interest me.
---
There are pay to win mechanics in pve games, look at Warframe, or even Tera. Pay to win isn't strictly in PvP games.
---
Summit a ticket
---
and private servers make that trivial at best.
---
and even then, by subscribing you can potentially get infinite junk.
---
I already have drawn the line 1 month after f67 release,   i fucking loved 3,vegas,  4, skyrim,  ... they killed it,  not just that,  they trample over it and wont stop,  im done,  im so fucking done, hod toward can go and suck himself off because i will never buy sth from bethesda again!
---
Before fo76 I wouldn't have hesitated in buying starfield or the new TES when they got released, i would have blindly followed bethesda. now I'm on the fence and thinking all of them are going to be 10x the shitshow  fo76 was, it was just the test bed to see how much they can get away with in future releases.
---
Fallout 1st to quote admiral akbar is "a trap", Bethesda knew exactly how to hit us because the community were very vocal about the item, it knew almost everyone wanted the NCR gear and would blindly subscribe to get it. 
---
The junk stash is the bigger trap tho, unlimited storage, everyone subscribed would instantly put ALL their junk into it, even those who are only doing the month version just to get the costume. What happens after the month? Will they be able to unload their junk not subscribed from the stash... my guess is not meaning they will have to further subscribe just to get it out or just stay subscribed, thinking the free 1600+ atoms as an incentive to stay. It's effective and dangerous marketing, designed to keep players subscribed.
---
No mods so we cant fix their game as usual
---
They know that eventually the irate players will go away and then Todd can emerge from cryo sleep and shock us all again with their next scheme all over again, lmao.
---
Bethesda doesn't care about its players, but there's still people who support them; which is insane after what [they've done to their community.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8) Seriously, some of the stuff they've done is so far off the spectrum of what a reasonable company should do it's pretty insane to see how religiously defensive people get about it, like it's some sort of a cult.
---
I love the Fallout franchise to death, I really do, but I can't look past what Bethesda has done and is still continuing to do. I find it disgusting that some people can.
---
Ah yes, competitive ammo selling.
---
Lol that just sounds weird, it never takes me long to find someone selling ammo for a cap a piece..not sure how much of an advantage one would have..
---
Site is down, anyone have an archive?
---
Upvote from this guy
---
Thanks for you're input, I always love a nicely thought out comment! It does sound like a good deal in your case especially considering the hours you've already put into the game. I suppose that's what it comes down to with pricing but I definitely think they have missed the sweet spot. I think they'd earn more money by having a lower price with what I considered a more reasonable service, I reckon this would bring in enough extra customers to offset the lower price. 
---
In saying that I also recognise that this is essentially replacing the season pass, most of the money from the subscription (after paying AWS for servers to run private worlds) is going to the development of content like Wastelanders that is free to everyone. The other benefits to Fallout 1st don't really cost Bethesda anything.
---
Anyway sorry for the ramble hope it wasn't too boring to read and thanks again for your comment!
---
Maybe if they treated us with an ounce of respect, I would be more civil, but they haven't...
---
So Bethesda can go suck a choad.
---
&gt;  It would have to be separate from public servers
---
Yeah i know a lot of games similar to 76 the main reason they survive is because of their private server community, specifically the RP community. I mean look at conan exiles or even GTA. The only reason GTA is normally top 5 on twitch is because of their RP private servers.
---
Yea I’m ok with that. Honestly when I bought it I started seeing A LOT of people saying the scrap box is bugged and everyone’s losing their stuff and did regret my decision. Unless it’s like a season pass where every DLC is free I won’t buy the year subscription. Then again if the DLC’s are all pay to play I might just move on.
---
No, it’s called crying and bitching on the Internet for good boy points. I bought dayz and don’t like how long and how poorly they’ve developed the game, but you don’t see me over on that sub screaming and yelling for people to boycott. I just don’t buy their games anymore. Simples. Grow up a bit.
---
i still see it
---
Right, it's plain diabolical to charge for private sessions.  They just missed a massive opportunity here.  Hell, they could have charged for actual private servers AND sold the NCR armor separately.
---
All you are guaranteed to get with ESO Plus is the monthly 1500 crowns, craft bag, DLC access for $15/mo. The only reason it seems like you get more is that ESO has been around for 5 years and there's more DLCs now.
---
You call this dumpster fire a success? Wow!
---
It gives an advantage over other players because you can have an unlimited supply of junk, maybe the most important thing in the game. P2w isn't just in PvP games. 😴
---
Nah its me johan
---
Pretty sure there is a link to the website on 6 different top tier subs within the last few hours. It's called the reddit hug of death. Its not because of Bethesda. The 4chan fellow owns the domain, there's nothing they can do.
---
Lol i'm 100% sure they'll be charging for mods in the near future. Imagine that, charging us to fix their game.
---
They are convinience not cosmetics or p2w
---
Right, we need to have a serious talk about these subscription costs. There's no way in hell any game should be charging more than Xbox Live / PSN for their own bullshitery, doesn't even come close, bolt.
---
Ah.  So, not interested then.
---
Me: "I like this multiplayer open world survival fallout game".
---
People: "You should try this non fallout game that's not open world with no survival aspects because the company that made it has the same name as a company that once made a fallout game".
---
Me: "?"
---
LOL, nice try pete hines. "Toxic" Behavior is what got loot boxes removed from battlefront 2, sitting there and just accepting getting nickled and dimed is ridiculous. Especially considering fallout 76 is still a more broken ass game than fallout 4, with bethesda's additions being laughable in comparison to much of the community made content for the latter. It's not tribalism, it's just people pointing out objective bullshit.
---
Damn it ! Now I have to make new friends. 
---
Imma go find Mr.Pebbles tmrw !
---
It's a new pay model - b2pf- buy 2 pay further
---
Still cheaper to drive in most cases then fly in Australia... at least in my 1995 Camry for 2400 km.
---
I guarantee you they get death threats 24/7 in their position, even if they were doing a perfect job people will have a bad match of NW or encounter a frustrating bug and there you go, another death threat.
---
But the only time we'll hear about them is when they need to distract from their own bullshit.
---
It’s more like borderlands than fallout
---
From what i seen in reddit. Only about 1/2 actualy play. So it means there just in the community to cause more of a issue. But like anything new they create banter for a while till they become board then move on.
---
I don’t have much time to play between work, family, friends and “life”.  Any time spent in a game is very valuable for me and I will gladly make the money-for-time trade.
---
My planned use for the private servers:
---
1. My daughter loves to build.  Giving her a safer environment for base building and workshop building is worth the money.  The atoms is another bonus (I don’t use them, but she definitely will). Growing Fallout fan.
---
2. Not feeling like a “dick” in some situations is priceless.  For example nuked WhiteSprings, AWOL, Uranium Fever etc.  Seeing a legendary and knowing that there are other players nearby forces you to wait for them to tag it (or be a dick).
---
3. Solo SBQ - to see if your build is good enough 
---
4. Friends who prefer the pure PVE experience 
---
5. PVP matches for teams or with objectives (capture the most workshops or other goals)
---
6. Starting new character with Wastelanders (solo or as a group with friends)
---
At this stage, I feel like if Bethesda read your statement they would counter with "hold my beer..."
---
They have shown time and again how incompetent they are.
---
I do wish they did it the way ARK does there servers.
---
There was 0 chance that your "investment" was going to provide a capital gain of any sort. What you bought was not an investment product, it was a consumer product and you are not entitled to a refund. Simple facts of economics, all of this was detailed in the fine print when you pre-ordered the game.
---
Is the playerbase so low, that they made such a move?
---
I’m looking into suing Bethesda over false advertising from E3 all the way through to today. 
---
I think at the very least, I can get a refund.
---
Yea he was but its whatever. But overall I  just feel so disappointed. It sucks
---
Link doesnt seem to work.
---
Right, because real men need to keep reminding themselves that they're alphas.
---
What a complete loser you are.
---
“Someone expressing their opinion about the new update but they don’t agree with me? Must be a troll.”
---
-u/Anon4567895
---
fore me its an endless loading site so i can see the link lol
---
What are you winning here?
---
we need unlimited aid &amp; ammo box for subscription. then its perfect. gun &amp; armor stash can be made later
---
I think most of the people (like me) who are looking at OW as a competitor to FO76 are the ‘single players’, so for them it technically is because of how they approached the game. I agree, in terms of a multiplayer game it’s not a competitor but I did single player for most of 76 so for me it is/would be an alternative.
---
As an aside I don’t know if comparing a standing titan like World of Warcraft to Fallout 76 is a prudent comparison, but I get the idea.
---
I did, this was my most played game of 2019 but when the vault raids launched all the bugs and shitty performance just killed it for me.
---
Haven't booted the game since that, was waiting for wastelanders to drop so that i could have an excuse to come back...
---
But we go a subscription system and no new major content for the rest of the year so whoopsie doopsie the game stays uninstalled.
---
I didn’t lol. BETA!!😂🖖🏾
---
What I don't understand is.... Why does it matter to someone who don't like the game and won't pay for the SO-CALLED provate server if someone else who like the game and will pay for the server. If you don't like what's happening then don't pay or play. IT'S JUST A GAME SOME PEOPLE LIKE PLAYING.
---
This is why we complained about the repair kits... and the scrap kits... and the fridge and scrap bot... but Bethesda stays quiet when we get angry. And then we have other gamers say it's not a big deal.
---
Took me about 3 days between watoga Phoenix and the train station just below Top of the World.
---
Try it on a desktop.
---
/u/aten_ra
---
I'm confused why you marked this discussion. This is simply a rant. So why complain about people complaining? They've been complaining for years and they'll never stop complaining. Just ignore the complaints and play the game you want.
---
You can literally free up your stash of junk to put more items in there. You can farm infinite amounts of ammo and never have to go on another ammo run again. It completely removed item management from the game. You're literally paying for stash. This is an advantage over other players LMAO. I don't get how this is so hard to understand.
---
I pay into zos and bethesda monthly so really no change to me.
---
Where did you find them?
---
Shouldn't have warned him. Should have been a surprise, made by Bethesda!
---
Nah. Probably the Reddit kiss of death
---
To be fair player base hardly got hit with recent update, checked a few things like number of posts on xbox club and was around 200 like normal during weekdays so at least vendors are still active and majority of players I know don't care. I hate this games direction too but yea this seems like Reddits community's outrage is very limited in effect especially when most players have already quit that planned too during repair kits.
---
they are shopping for yachts
---
So what you are saying is... you are happy that Bethesda are lying, thieving bastards and you are content to allow it to continue.
---
That sure seems dumb.
---
HAHA! Idiots Everywhere.
---
From what I understand it's a PC only issue. I haven't had a problem on PS4 yet.
---
 Even so it is just Junk components. Every location in the world has tons of it.
---
Worth more than Fallout 1st.
---
Perhaps it should
---
The thing is we keep saying this and how truly bad they are for their shittty tactics but year after year the same companies keep making more and more money.
---
I guess we live in a bubble :(
---
apparently SOME of them are bugged with npcs being alreadly killed or other odd stuff lol  and something like that if you have friends in your friends list who are also a paid member they can join your world without asking......not sure how true that is tho lol
---
Okay, I'll spell it out for you.You have to invest resources, perks and time into working around these constraints.
---
Or you can pay money and not have to do any of that. Now the resources, perks, and time you would have to spend on inventory management can be spent on obtaining more power.
---
This not an insignificant advantage.
---
I'm dipping in for a month also
---
You just discussed the topic 🤔
---
I'm pretty sure they did this because the playerbase is so small that they hope to milk those who remain. After all, the people still playing are extremely loyal, and they either will be disappointed and quit, or pay for everything that Todd throws at them.
---
So you can’t answer my question?😂😂😂😂👍🏽
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20191024101229/http://falloutfirst.com/
---
I wouldn’t say anything if I were them. They know that nearly all of the haters will forget about this in a few days. Then they’ll hype up the Halloween event and act like everything is fine. I mean, everything is fine. People are terribly dramatic. Find something real to be mad about.
---
just accept it or move on
---
Just hop into a private world and do the robot!
---
How did they take it down? I’d imagine that it’s just getting slammed right now and that’s the reason for the slowdown.
---
You're gaining an advantage, scroll up and see my comment as to the advantage you're given for paying actual money. I'm not explaining it again and it honestly baffles me people are actually defending this.
---
yeah the workshop is convenient but on a competition base it isnt an advantage. and i dont think its fair to include the duping exploit as an argument when its not a feature in the game, we arnt paying for private servers to dupe (although some people probably are). i dont know, i just feel like people have overreacted because it was unexpected and sugar coated to a ridiculous extent.
---
I'll be sure to carry pumpkin grenades and mines just in case.
---
That's fair. I actually think waiting for wastelanders is probably the way to go.
---
Bethesda took it down... Like how? There is no presumed ownership of a domain name even if it uses a trademarked named. Even the copyright infringement of images shouldn't get a domain shut down, if you're willing to take them on in court it isn't up to the service provider to shut the domain down, in fact by doing so, they're taking on the liability themselves, so now if Bethesda does sue, the host is completely on the hook for deciding on behalf of the creator.
---
The internet is really turning shitty when Bethesda can get a domain name taken down for using their trademark, pay for it like everyone else.
---
Pay2win isn't just about pvp and combat, it's about the game as a whole.
---
They created a problem, an inconvenience holding you back from completing your goals in a timely manner, then they sell you a solution.
---
That's pay2win.
---
Stash space limits ability to sprint, or running being brought to a crawl when AP runs out. That is a major advantage in any Player vs Player situation,  and so by definition is pay to win. The only item that is actually pay to win in the game.
---
Fair. Thrice!
---
Well, all the DLC were and are free. I didn’t need to pay for Wild Wasteland or Nucler Winter.
---
Crap is the appropriate word for it as modders have made several reinditions that were better. Enjoy having wasted money and having funded companies with 0 morales and a whole lot of will to make money whatever the cost.
---
Who needs paying private servers I had my own last night, logged on and the server I ended up on didn't have a single other player on it, the downside is not being able to do  the events.
---
I'll never support EGS and their chinese backers. Sorry. It's either Pirates life for me, or I wait a year til it hits steam.
---
This is basically how I see it. 
---
Besides that, speaking strictly in atoms, you’d have to pay $15 for 1500 atoms. Even with the monthly subscription, which is the most expensive one, you still get 1650 atoms. Sure, that’s only 150 more than outright buying the atoms by themselves, but were not done. Look at the yearly price. It’s 8.30 a month. You get *even more atoms* for free. Add in the scrap bin, survival tent, emotes, icons, privet world, and the veteran ranger armor? All of those are basically free. They’re being given to you.
---
EA has *decades* of anti-consumer behavior, Blizzard is acting on behalf of literal murdering fascists... but yeah, I guess some paid service you don't want is totally on the same level. 
---
Blizzard probably is happy though, you have that right. A lot of manchildren Gamers™ like you have zero perspective and this nothingburger is the hot new outrage amongst the loud, toxic members of the gaming community.
---
I am betting that they are letting all of the shit-throwing howler monkeys tire themselves out a bit before coming back out.
---
When hasent 76 had bugs. This just adds another one they will need to fix.
---
If they were going to do this garbage they should have at least made sure that it worked on the release. But You supporting this is a bad idea that much is undeniable but you don't deserve this.
---
&gt; just because I've got money and others don't
---
Yes just because someone isn't subscribed to Fallout 1st they don't have money.
---
I mean, I am not a griefer but I can’t speak for anyone else. I want to see the armor, but it doesn’t seem like a good enough deal for me to pay a monthly fee for it and a handful of other things.
---
No matter how "smart" your storage is there is still a finite amount of space in our regular stash boxes.
---
If you wanna use your money to support a corrupt, piece of shit company who has almost exclusively swindled it's fanbase at every turn with this broken, decrepit game, you can go right ahead :D
---
fun..to be honest it does look really cool lol
---
That is true. And yes it is.
---
And to add to this, people can already carry around tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, and that clearly has never been any kind of technical concern even since day one.  Ammunition would cause even MORE issues than scrap would if storing more of an individual item caused problems, since the amount you're carrying would repeatedly go down as you go through ammo and it would have to subtract from that value every time (as much as, what, 20 or 30 times per second for some guns?)
---
You people should be ashamed of yourselves from one of the best companies in the industry who games I have loved to me hating you more than Electronic Arts. I hope you enjoy staying radio silent over all of this because your not getting another dime out of me EVER. I don't care if it is 50 years in the future and you are all retired and Todd Howard has a electric scooter to get around the office never again.
---
This membership doesn’t bother me too much. Elder Scrolls Online has a membership exactly like this (excluding the factor there’s gives access to all DLC released, so unless they end up charging us 25$ for Wastelanders then we’re fine.) From what I read in the patch notes, and what they haven’t shown in game on the main menus pop up. Is Fallout 1st members will get exclusive stuff related to the atom store, as in like, bigger discounts or something along those lines. So you get a pretty decent amount of Atoms per month, and if there’s a discount or whatever, you’ll have atoms to use to get them. I personally want it for the scrapbox and ranger outfit.
---
Cunts.
---
still down on my end.
---
You know that will be instantly abused to the max, especially legendary spawns.
---
well cool, he will have a lot of ammo. dont do me any good or harm
---
But it really doesn't
---
&gt; Skyrim had bad storytelling? You must have only played side quests...
---
That is REALLY interesting. Because I genuinely think the side quests are the best part. Generally of any Bethesda game. Morrowind had a solid main story. Oblivion... oh man all the guilds were amazing. Skyrim... it has some interesting side stuff.
---
As the other guy explained, Vault steel is a component you recieve upon completion of the Vault 94 raid, quantity increasing by difficulty. You can earn a single plan for PA or V94 exclusive scout armor at the end of standard or hard mode raids, which can be learned to craft pieces of PA that offer a special bonus to the wearer, or legendary armor with unique perks like healing teammates near you or causing opponents to bleed with melee attacks. Each piece of armor takes something like 10 or 12 vault steel to craft, plus a legendary module from the purveyor which is 50 scrip iirc.. The roll is random, and if you don't like it you can't drop it, trade it, sell it, etc.
---
ok
---
Gotta say, I'm pretty indifferent to 76 overall -I got it for free - so I'm not really saying this from a place of scorn or anything, but the constant snafus with this game have me pretty worried about the next Elder Scrolls. 
---
Bugs and stuff aside, their morphing mentality as a developer is concerning and it feels like the days of them churning out crown jewels like Skyrim are long over. But hey, hopefully all of this nonsense is restricted to 76 and TES will remain awesome.
---
HA! Bethesda? Change?
---
Keep pacifist on, then block-n-hop if they persist.  There aren't that many of them dedicated enough to their "cause" to do that.
---
My point exactly with this post.  Fallout will either become this or try to be the lesser evil. Only time will tell.
---
So true!
---
Lol. It isn’t about you having money and others not, though the humble brag was well played. If you’re criticized or “griefed” in game over this it’ll be because people are laughing at your choices with respect to how you spend your stacks of cash.
---
"investor"
---
hahahaha
---
Remember how they said that more inventory doesnt work with the game?
---
 I will. ;)
---
I uninstalled Destiny the other day. Extremely unhappy int he direction they are going and Shadowkeep was a huge rip off in retrospect.
---
 Found mine at watoga train station.
---
Kinda sounds like you're just bad at managing your inventory.
---
My friends and I were worried for you mate. Told them (including the one who lost his steel) about your predicament last night, we were all talking about feigning illness to go home and check if we were you..lol. Glad your stuff is still there. Seems like the issue is caused by force-quitting from one mode and re-entering to another mode. Similar to how those people on PC lost their stuff in the raid.
---
So kind of like the fanbase putting their trust into Bethesda to fix Fo76
---
I played for a few hours last night, on a private world. got more magazines/plans than I ever have before. next to no load time, faster loading in general, and I don't have to worry about some dickhead taking my workshop.
---
With Outer Worlds coming out, I will likely not continue my MONTH TO MONTH sub (yeah 100 is a lot up front, and I wanted to test the waters) but for the peace of mind, extra perks and fast loading it is great.
---
It is too soon, no one argues with u there. I left ESO to play this game, because this game dint charge me, but I allways knew this would happen eventually. Anybody in this Reddit, should go and give that game a shot, theres millions of people on servers allways, and they all pay their subscriptions. Todd said it himself at one point: " We knew this would happen because the same happened with ESO".
---
[endless trash!](https://youtu.be/Ut5sk0RUlS4)
---
Tell me agaim from the top. Seems like im missing somthing critical here.
---
They did say very specifically that all dlc (is the wastelanders kind) would be free forever. But I can totally see them saying that it’s “free for members” (that’s totally what they meant mkay)
---
Thats true but if you space everything right you wont hsve a need for infinite storage
---
Humor me, and see if you can manage it without shitting the bed and calling people assholes and fuckers.
---
Let's say the game didn't make the money it needed to. That the ongoing costs of the game outweigh the profits. 
---
How would you propose they turn the game into a viable ongoing concern at this point?
---
At least they didn't monetize suggestions like player vending or vault raids, suppose we should be thankful for that
---
This ^. But dont expect for a second that we wont get expansions either. Im can put my head in an executioners axe and tell you with confidence that in 2021 we will be getting Capital Wasteland for 40 bucks.
---
If they do then its one more reason to have one :)
---
It's ready to play now. The problem is that now I have to keep the region as NZ until midnight as my other games are locked to the UK.
---
I’ll just drop the You Have Been Insulted notes around anyone I see wearing that Ranger outfit lol.
---
With all due respect, and providing you are not just a garden variety troll, that is a rather odd mindset to approach this matter with.
---
Although is entirely possible that you may encounter some animosity you are being derisive yourself.
---
Perhaps you may want to consider some self reflection before facing your fellow man because in all honesty you don't sound ready to behave like a well adjusted individual.
---
That’s not pay2win.......You said yourself it’s just an inconvenience. Does not give any advantage other then more room and less inventory management.
---
Exactly. people don't keep it on them, they keep it in their stash, so they carry their weapons and armor, that makes them overburdened. Clean out all of the junk from the stash and there is plenty of space for weapons and asmor etc. So it directly affects how much people have to carry with them, which is by definition pay to win. As i said. The only item that directly affects gameplay in a player vs player sense.
---
Ok yeah i see where youre coming from with that, and i would be right in your corner if it comes round to it and you can hop from your modded server to public, but for now i highly doubt they will allow that, i think with a modded server it will be exclusive to private servers because that is absolutely game breaking.
---
I'm surprised that nobody's pointed this out yet: [A board game on the table? Mr Fuzzy on a chair?](https://i.imgur.com/yvwVKBf.png) *Those are junk items placed in the room*.
---
No i just like variety in guns boring just using one type of guns im not bad at it i know where most of it is i have 150 200 pounds in flux alone
---
At least, yeah.
---
Lmao man children are people that don’t like anti consumerism and lies, do us a favor and sell your rights to a Indonesian sweat shop you cronie
---
Its not much time or resources you need to work around with, dont be so dramatic its just a tony convinience
---
Well, you understand jack shit. Databases can deal with high volumes of data and even if you had to store each puny legendary you have in your stash individually, you could litteraly handle thousands of them without breaking a sweat with the associated request. And this, even, in a concurrent environment that could handle far more users than the feeble 24 max people you have in these stupid servers.
---
Couldnt think of a strong enough word, so i had to settle for this. it doesnt do the company justice, in terms of how shit they are
---
Yup. People are ballin, but in truth, this subscription dosent rlly change ur day to day play style.
---
True.  This is a big win for the community :) prices on fusion cores will go down to 10-20 caps
---
No they aren't moaning about getting an extra experience you silly sausage
---
They're complaining because the features in the subscription are features they requested and ones that where expected on launch. They are being sold back to them for an overpriced premium which nobody asked for.
---
Bethesda have also lied to the community and done a 180 in their commitment to keep the atom shop fair. So now people including me have bought a game with the promise of it being great later 
---
(not that we should have to wait)
---
despite the issues, have been absolutely played like a fiddle.
---
Damn it’s already down or so over loaded I can’t get it to load up
---
it's either Fallout 76 or heroin...and heroin gives me acne.
---
We're just not dumb enough to blindly throw a lying game company money they don't deserve. :)
---
Literally hunt down and relentlessly kill anyone in NCR Ranger outfits. That's pretty much the only way to stop whales, once they figure out they're being killed because of the armor they either quit the game, or they take off the armor. Not being able to wear the armor publicly is really going to change their opinion on spending money on the game.
---
Though I'll be honest, Bethesda is far more likely to introduce a policy of banning griefers than allowing the whales to be hurt. ESO is case and point on that, everytime a unique build that stops the whales who zerg is discovered, ZOS nerf the living shit out of it when the whales complain.
---
Yes!
---
Already did, along with several of my friends.
---
happy cakeday
---
That's what I assume anyway, that people don't have disposable income
---
It is pay2win, its pay to skip the grind and repetitive hauling, to accelerate to your goals faster than if you didn't pony up the cash.
---
That's winning in a game like this.
---
You then sell the ammo for 1 cap a piece, is this clicking yet?
---
It's honestly so frustrating having to explain this again. Please read carefully: Characters on private servers are separate from official servers and not interchangeable.
---
By selling cosmetics like they said they would. Look at Fortnite. All of that is from cosmetic sales. BUT! Here is the thing. They didn't have shills telling players to go away and just quit the game any time they raised a concern.
---
Mostly shitty, over the top skins too, whilst good old canon skins get ignored. I guess they'll be part of "next month subscriber cosmetic!" or something...
---
Yeah ea sports deserves loads of money for fifa which is a total mess every year.
---
yo what system you playing the game on? console?
---
Okay cheers for that bud!
---
Dang I am able to access it, weird.
---
At this point is just an experiment to see how far Bethesda can go with its antics.
---
‘There was an idea, to bring together a group of F2P players, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles the fans never could.’
---
Cue avengers theme
---
I’m sure the people who buy items off eBay are loving this.
---
I only wear my Mr Fuzzy outfit, so... good luck?
---
I wonder if they got a bonus for reaching an 85% on Metacritic...
---
Is it still gone if you switch back to private or just invisible in public sessions by purpose?
---
It’s getting better &amp; better. Guess you just got bethesded.
---
Aslong as it’s not part of the Base game, and stays in the Atom Shop it technically doesn’t change the lore.
---
This won’t be helpful but...
---
Your husband is a PREMIUM subscriber. Surely their customer service will quickly and effectively react if you create a customer service ticket specifying your issue.
---
Sorry but that's a Bethesda problem. I'm very disappointed he actually bought that crap. It seems paid members can't get away from Bethesdas incompetence 
---
Anyway 
---
You could try re adding him, have you became a member of the world? Deleting and re adding  probably fix these issues. Other than that Bethesda support
---
Not a single Fallout game previously has been multiplayer, so you can’t set the expectation that you expect it to be the same. It never will be. Bethesda specifically stated they were never intending to bring NPCs to the game... until they realized how much backlash there was, insofar as a drop in player base for choosing that hill to die on. 
---
Would you have been content with a box to give you 500 free stash space for junk? 
---
Private servers were never intended, until Bethesda realized they could monetize it. I can host a server for my normal squad and another squad for pvp or whatever with no chance of griefing. I’ll agree refrigerators should have been a plan and the skins should have been Atom Shop. The scrap collectors were never asked for, so those could have been free. But private servers? I think it’s completely fair to offer a product like that at a monthly fee, much like the web data storage companies. I don’t agree with some of Bethesda’s choices, and this probably could have been done a little better, but this unto itself is not a big thing.
---
Grade school solutions to first world problems.
---
“Just because I got money and others don’t looool”
---
you lost me at "garden variety" ;)
---
No one forced you to play. 
---
Find something else if you don't like it and pick your games carefully next time.
---
Yep. Pretty stoked to have this Friday off work to just hang out and play a great game.
---
I actually did some research in this, it looks like it doesn't spool up a new instance when you go and create a private world, if someone else had a private world earlier, but has logged out and the instance is now unoccupied, you can get assigned that instance; their world essentially. 
---
You can see this quite plainly if you play a high level character and you leave the private world for an hour, then you log back in, there is a chance for the high level area to have lower level enemies, this happens because a lower level player was there last. This can only happen if someone with a lower level character played that particular instance before you.
---
Heck yeah! Keep this thing passing around.
---
It's the social menu whackiness getting you.  Dashboard the game, then try it again.
---
what does him having caps have to do with me
---
But nobody runs round overburdened. you prioritize which junk is useful and what is useless and drop the useless junk, and a lot of it is useless. i get what you mean, when i cleared all of the junk from my stash i was down to 600 which gives me an extra 200 for more weapons etc but i just dont know if thats considered pay to win because i can merely store more?
---
You are not alone squire. We are all in agreement
---
Nope, but the people who do pay get an advantage
---
You're really giving them too much credit... They used about 15 lines of code to create these private sessions, then say they'll allow mods. They will do the absolute bare minimum as they always do and you'll be able to jump over just fine.
---
"If the owner crashes"
---
THAT SHOULD NOT BE A THING ON A PRIVATE SERVER.
---
I didn't spend a lot of time optimizing the sequence.  Proceed at your own risk.
---
Most people who are calling it pay to win are doin so because you can hop on your private server, capture all workshops uncontested, farm a ton of resources and take all of that to public servers and have advantages in PVP and such.
---
Nah, let it be a Fallout 1st Surprise!
---
Atleast their games aren't a fucking mess stability wise and we already know they want money and didn't lie to us during E3 telling us that their shop would be "cosmetic only." We know what we're getting from EA, but Bethesda literally lied to us and is just milking us for money and you guys are fine with it.
---
Or wait, guess it was the horse armor ;-)
---
Thank you. I’ll do this
---
so you are going to kill them in nuclear winter? sorry boi but you are bit too late, bethesda disabled pvp in adventure mode:D but if you are on pc I will gladly buy that sub so youn come kill me on site... my stealth boy's are stockpiling without any use
---
Your post history is full of complaints about the high price of fallout 1st, and encouraging others not to buy. Odds are that you're lying about this.
---
You folks are on the verge of pathetic
---
Someone else said dashboard it. I’ll try that first. If that doesn’t I’ll give this a try
---
Nah man our brains are just actually developed
---
Well it’s better still
---
This is pretty disgusting. It makes devs like Hello Games feel even more special in this climate of botched releases. Bethesda may have all the money in the world at the moment but this complete lack of forsight from them shows that this probably be the case for very long. Its sad to see Bethesda take this route. Their legacy has hit a wall.
---
People who call those who are buying the subscription "idiots" or "shills" are being toxic.  There is a difference between actual criticism and verbal attacks on people who are interested in the service, or worse, people who are simply coding the game as a job.
---
Well, that IS their most well received game.
---
Well how is he going to convince you? It's the internet, you can believe what you want.
---
My man! You play like I do. I have hundreds of hours in 4 same way.
---
There ain't much you can do with 1200 units of junk that someone cant with 500 tho...
---
I'm thinking they'll have a half off discount when wastelanders launches because there will be more reason to play in your own world.
---
Dont need to
---
I was just trying to argue this point with people, that buying a game does NOT entitle them to ANY past content from a previous game, EVEN IF they bought the game it comes from, nor does it entitle them to future content that may be released for the base game(unless they purchased a season pass or whatever), and i will STILL, even after this Fallout 1st bullshit, stick to my guns and keep bethesda in her holster at my side, but i can NOT condone the whole charging for utility items that effect gameplay.
---
Was It there when you went back to the private server? Did anything else you stored (in stash) disappear? 
---
Wondering if it's more of an issue with stuff not carrying between the servers
---
Honestly you’re getting more atoms for the price alone plus all the other bonuses. Almost every MMO does this including ESO. I’m surprised it took this long for them to implement a bonus subscription service. I think their battle is because of the fact that a large portion of their player base is new to world of MMO’s and have never played an MMO before. This is a standard feature/practice for most MMO’s. Bethesda isn’t doing anything weird or out of the ordinary here.
---
So its beyond pay to win at this point.  Its pay to play.  You can either play a game that's so crippled that its not enjoyable/full of inconveniences or pay the monthly fee.
---
Because they’re locking features that should’ve been in the game at launch behind a paywall
---
Camps have ign, just look for a tent or scrap box
---
If I can’t find a fix for it, I will have him create a ticket
---
Could you ask them next time over microphone how they got there? (Assuming you have a mic.) 
---
May be worth reporting it to [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial\_but\_comprehensive\_bug\_roundup\_patch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/) as well.
---
Lies or sales hype? I just don't react to it as strongly as you seem to.
---
It's a bad idea on multiple levels. Moving closer to P2W. Outer Worlds coming. Tiered in game system that might build resentment. I saw a new stash last night and felt, I dunno, maybe a little wtf inside.
---
But you know people are going to pay for it and be glad they do, because if the game had to survive on cheapskates it would be even worse than it is now.
---
But you are not skipping the grind? they dont give you junk?
---
Beth can never seem to get it right huh? XD
---
It's not about you. It's about the MANY people who get overburdened and need to use Excavator etc. to travel around. They are playing the game normally and are at a disadvantage to someone who can just stash infinite amounts of junk. While their stash is taken up by a lot of junk. It directly affects PvP being able to sprint etc. Saying "just manage inventory" or "I don't have that problem" doesn't mean anything. It's about something that has an immediate and direct effect on a players ability to sprint, use cavalier armor, do power attacks, or be slowed to a crawl. Thew item is Pay to Win. Because in certain circumstances that advantage means the difference between winning and losing a fight. There is no explaining that away.
---
How does it feel being a 1st, though?
---
Exactly. And most mmos don’t give you your own server in the subscription just some online money, dlc, and some decent features
---
It's sad that buying 15 dollars/month for a bit conviniency and cosmetics is now considered a good purchase, when for that same price you could probably buy Fallout 4 GOTY on key sites.
---
Pay 2 win......pay 2 skip.....completely different... You said it yourself better then I could lol. This game is all about the grind. Not the game for you if you don’t like to grind things out.
---
So what are your views on the Blizzard situation? And the Fallout 1st situation?
---
Well having the scrapboxes literally removes item management of junk in your stash box and gives you an unlimited amount of stash (which they lied and said they couldn't do because of "stability" issues) for your junk. You can essentially farm all the junk needed to make ammo and never have to go on another junk/ammo run again for quite some time. It's pay to win because premium players in fact get an advantage over free players, it'll only get worse.
---
Stable Flux is a junk component. It is kinda useful...
---
yeah why would any game stop you from playing it? Makes no sense.
---
And you know what’s even more hilarious is that even the scrapbox is glitched atm, people are saying that you can lose your junk if you put it in there lmao Bethesda really is a joke sometimes
---
Fix the broken game too many people paid $60 for. Garbage company.
---
150k? That's a wild exaggeration.
---
People are spending up to 50 pounds a week on things like cigarettes.
---
If my kid came to me and said I want a tenner a month to subscribe to a game I like, I'd pay it.
---
If they came to me and asked for a tenner for some cigarettes, I'd slap them.
---
don't bother, the sooner you'll understand that people don't buy membership because they're poor but rather it's not worth it in their opinion, the better...
---
That's marketing, nothing to do with how the devs feel about it.
---
I caved for one month but I try to justify it because of the Atoms. I’m a sucker for cosmetics and new stuff (probably some kind of OCD shit). So I’m usually buying atoms anyway if I don’t have enough from challenges. So hey if anything I got a deal on atoms. I still feel a bit dirty though.
---
Fallout 1st members only!
---
This is why I use a vpn and pay on the American site for any digital content or subscription I end up paying the fair exchange rate
---
So why do you think anyone would even want unlimited storage then?
---
Pffff even at 50% discount it's still a rip off.
---
They won't reply, not directly anyway, they will release the Inside the Vault updatevlater today, in it they will big up yesterday's announcement and all its pros, totally blindside any of the controversy around the price, private servers not actually being private, stash limit, and so on. 
---
It will be like every other release for this game, epic salt, followed by nothing from Beth, more salt, then back to plying the game. Give it a well and all this 1st salt will have died down, Beth knows this, tahts why they don't address these issues. They know it will just go away.
---
can't wait to kick the plebs off my private server..
---
I mean ill play wastelanders when it drops but after that its just gonna collect dust
---
Afaik this isn't possible, the game runs on AWS, not a dedicated server. However AWS does not cost anywhere near $16/month.
---
I assuming Beth has probably deleted this sub , I’m about ready to ,.. getting way to toxic with all the the F1 crusaders
---
Sorry for the late-ish response
---
A lot of people are just complaining and not explaining there gripes in-depth
---
It’s identical on face value but the mechanics are different. On arks non dedicated servers the server is hosted on the players device, meaning it doesn’t cost the company to run the private servers.
---
What Bethesda is doing is running the servers themselves, but only when the player is on, seemingly to give a reason to charge, but as I said these types of sessions have been normally hosted for free by use of console hosting. 
---
What Bethesda should do is wait and and do full private dedicated servers.
---
These empty servers can already have been picked clean by hoppers, them caring about negative feedback is obviously nil. People want this and pay for it because they want a server they can do everything solo and have access to everything like a solo or friend group game, they're not getting what this and are being duped. 
---
Bethesda doesn't care about advantages, as far as they're concerned if someone else gets something awesome, you should pay for it like they did. ZOS had the same response with ESO, oh the DLC and Chapter specific armors give a huge PVE/PVP advantage? Well you should buy them then.
---
As long as you redeem it from the atom shop before your subscription expires then you will always have access to it
---
&gt;4 years? This game is already nearly dead. It will possibly have a slight hickup when wastelanders arrive next march or april. Possibly it will linger a little longer as free-to-play or it will just silently die by Fall 2020. They just experiment how to squeeze of the most money until wastelander arrives (as they already budgeted that cost), se possibly how free-to-play vs. sub works and then kill that motherfucker.
---
Bethesda has truly become Vaulttec.
---
My point is, I can justify paying for ESO+, and I actually do, as the game itself provides me with more than enough stuff to do. With about 350 hours in I've still yet barely scratched the surface. Gearing is also way more straightforward, if I want a particular set/item - I know exactly where to go to farm it.
---
Fallout 1st - not so much. I've stopped playing this summer (for the second time since beta), and still at the point of quitting there was close to zero non-repeatable content left for me to do, and most of my playtime was being alt-tabbed into trading discord.
---
O still got 250k stash from the original bypass glitch
---
Don't know the details but a few people have been saying it's not truly your own server and Bethesda can still do what they want within those servers
---
You're saving time by streamlining the inventory management process, which is the same thing as skipping grinding.
---
It's a gigantic world full of detail, each iteration of fallout improves upon this idea, which has always been the centerpiece of Bethesda titles. I guess players no longer value this, which is kind of sad for our culture honestly.
---
Yeah but nearly everyone buys them, I have like 70 fallout friends because of trading, and nearly all of them are in private worlds....... What's does that say? These are just random people from the market place on here.
---
Everyone I see is wearing atomic shop power armor or apparel.
---
Everyone has atomic shop camp items.
---
A lot of people are in denial about how much they actually spend on this game, and I guarantee you.... Something will go into the atomic shop for around 1500 atoms....and if you buy some atoms instead of just subscribing..... You're nuts.
---
We all? We all? You guys really need to get over yourselves. Your voices are small, and unheard, and nobody least of all Bethesda gives a rat's ass if your unhappy. Your a very tiny fraction of the active player base and no amount of bitching or complaining is going to get you anything but a bit of sympathy karma.
---
Also, for anyone who was surprised, I just checked the article from last week.
---
" Our goal for players who **purchase this service** is to offer something for everyone, not just those who want a private server. Additionally, in the future you’ll be able to mod your worlds. Stay tuned for more information on the service in the coming days.
---
Is this for the collector bot, or for the junk resource collectors?
---
You will achieve nothing in life and surely end up with your predicted outcome if you give up without even trying.
---
You CAN make a change.
---
You CAN make people remember you.
---
But YOU WONT If you give up because you think you will never succeed.
---
Yes, but it's better than 7 people.
---
Do you know how many/much servers/server space it would require if every paid subscriber had their very own private server reserved for them at all times? For a game this size it would be logistically impossible especially on consoles. Some more obscure less mainstream PC titles can do this but it just wouldn’t be possible on a multi-platform mass market game like this. If anything at least it’s not totally host dependent like a lot of titles are and will stay active if there is another subscriber present and give you time to finish what you’re doing if not instead of straight booting everyone immediately.
---
says someone who can't afford it.
---
:)
---
I don't know the salt around fallout 1st feels different than previous salt, I think it's just too much of a bitch slap of a lie to the fan base this time
---
€199.99 my yearly subscription (xbox - Europe). 
---
WTF??
---
Hey hey outworlds is tomorrow, only a dollar if you play on Xbox. That game can fill your rpg needs
---
Well other people don't get immediately booted, my internet messed up for some minutes yesterday and my friend stayed on the private world until I got back. I'm not sure how long it takes before the shutdown timer starts if there are no subscribers present anymore.
---
Are private worlds peer to peer?
---
Understand that this is the natural course for this game to take, which is y I compare it to ESO. ESO is a game were only those with the good creddit card wins and progresses. F76 will be no different, and once we start getting 40 dollar expansions, the ones that dont pay will be left out. I originally left ESO for this game becausr this game dint charge me monthly. Now that it does, we as a community need to decide, is this program  worth on the long run? Or do we get it for 1 month every now and again? Or do we quit and play something else?
---
Idk what yall are on that the game would be dead.. i havent bought the new sub yet. And came across packed servers on xb1
---
Except the "Service" is a corporation trying to drain you for every last penny for their reused assets of a game with bugs that weren't even patched from fallout 4 despite the community already doing the work for bethesda with unofficial patches. You're free to spend your money how you want, but the delusion required to think bethesda is not greedy/fucking over the consumer is a level I thought could only be achieved through psychedelics.
---
The rest of the entire "Western" world is capitalist. And what Blizzard is doing is the epitome of capitalism.
---
Uhh, not compared to 1000+ hours of entertainment you can get from fo4, 
---
Besides we haven’t gotten any substantial content in almost 8 months, the vault raids and battle royale barely function, and bugs from launch still present
---
I haven't played Conan since Fallout 76 came out, so that's new for me.  I was checking out some youtube videos last night and there have been a lot of changes to Conan since I played.  Looks like I'll be getting back into it!
---
Bethesda is also one of the first companies that tried to sell cosmetic horse armor as valid DLC.
---
Like I'd ever let the likes of you into Club Fuzzy...
---
I've preordered the 200$ version with PA helmet.
---
Does that makes me entitled?
---
TBH most FPS fallout games (epically console) have been stinkers on release.  It typically wasn't until 1st or 2nd dlc that they started getting cleaned up.
---
well its not really a private server.
---
It will be just a regular server but nobody else can join.
---
Actually it will be worse then a normal server because it only supports 8 players.
---
No, not really bud.
---
Ya moms a hoe
---
Didnt happen to me so just dont get the lol
---
you are comparing apples with oranges, and normalizing this shit is not normal, keep all that crazy shit in mobile games and sport games.
---
Imagine calling anything happening here abuse :) grow up
---
I haven't played since shortly after release and I won't until some genius makes a 'FiveM'-style backend mod.
---
Shit game, shit publisher.
---
LMAAAAAO
---
Utter incompetence.
---
It just keeps getting better
---
It's cool I'll just use my backlog of orbital strikes and artillery signals
---
Don't know if this game is played competitive at all, or if there are any leaderboards. But if it is/there are then these are definitely disadvantages towards a non-paying player.
---
“Don’t buy it and be at a disadvantage!” You sound so dumb is not the fact that is a subscription or that is 13$ is that they’re locking  gameplay components behind a paywall I could give a shit about the Private Servers etc the Scrapbox is the problem.
---
That's what you get for encouraging them to put this shit into the game
---
Except there's numerous reasons not to play Outer Worlds either. Epic being the first thing, I absolutely refuse to monetarily reward them for their exclusivity-buying bullshit.
---
The cap on stash sizes could just be to keep you from storing too many individual items (the game does chug client-side when opening stashes that have a vast number of individual items in them), but the amount you carry of each item would have no impact on performance.  Storing and displaying 2 different guns would be more demanding than carrying 100,000 steel. Which is why storing scrap has always been a trivial feat since there's only so many different kinds of them.  Really they should've had separate storage for scrap long ago, there's no reason a stack of a single scrap item should take as much space as a dozen guns.
---
Will I get a receipt for my personal belongings or will they disappear when I get out of the whambulance.
---
Eso came out in 2014. Of course it has more content lmao.
---
Yo seeing this gave me PTSD of when the bags were shit and everyone said PA edition owners were being entitled shits for complaining.
---
Can I play both and still be accepted???
---
yeah.  already paid for and pre-loaded... Obsidian's last great game before they become another division of MS.
---
I mean literally every other game that offers private servers does it that way.
---
Why can they do it but Bethesda cant?
---
Because they are cheap and don't want to spend any of that money the get from the subscriptions on additional amazon servers.
---
Hehe sure man. Keep sucking Bethesdas dick. You'll see in a month or two... but i'm sure even then you'll make excuses
---
Solution. 
---
Don't smoke.
---
Don't buy shit expansions.
---
If you have the money, don't get The Outer Worlds on the Gamepass but buy it full price! If we don't support the creators of great games like that, the situation in the gaming industry will only get worse... far worse.
---
😂 I love the idea of a ranger purge. Even if I got it I couldn't deal with wearing it, it's like wondering around with a giant dick on your forehead.
---
For all of the reasons I have stated. It is much, much more than just a tiny convenience. It is worse. It starts small but it will snowball. Faster than you may think. That makes it dangerous because it flies under the radar of people like you who don't think about the wider effect something can have on a system.
---
It will not be long before the haves and the have-nots of this world will be defined by who has this damn premium pass and who doesn't. Not by something cool or interesting like game knowledge or skill.
---
I dunno, Instagram and twitter are a shitstorm too, Fo76 doesn’t have that many players that the people on social media are a minority
---
Virtually no lag on the raid for us yesterday. A little spike when there was a lot to render (two queens, water, foliage, etc all at once). Mainframe cores, keys, doors, everything is instantaenous. I won't dread doing next weeks raid now, because we'd given up because of server lag when doing the 'votes' and waiting for doors to open. Failed the raid at least 10 times because the lag didn't allow for us to continue through doors or use cards in time.
---
I've generally considered this year to be Bethesda's "good faith" attempt to get the game to a more polished state before they abandon it. They know how big of a shit show Fallout 76 has been and they have to be legitimately worried that it's going to hurt the release of their next big franchise games (Elder Scrolls to be exact and F5 when it comes). 
---
This way they can claim they kept supporting it and might be able to avoid a Gearbox/Aliens Colonial Marines lawsuit and PR disaster.
---
Actually I paid full price at preorder, then got Amazon to refund it and still have it on my XBox account. Yet I'm still going to complain about it because I can. I don't play the game anymore, so I don't care if it goes to shit, I admit openly I won't be playing until wastelanders comes out.
---
I complain because this sets a really bad precedent, what about ES VI? Fallout 5? Is this the attitude and approach Bethesda intends to take with those games? Because if they're not called out and take that approach, ES VI is going to be a big steaming pile of shit and we can say good bye to further releases from these series, because no one will bother with Bethesda games again. 
---
Honestly I'm waiting to see how Starfield turns out, if that is the same money grabbing pile of shit, then I will know ES VI will be and there's no point getting it.
---
Hmmmm sounds like you're throwing a pretty big temper tantrum now
---
&gt;why do you think they limited this service to only the minority of people likely to purchase the service in the first place?  
---
To make that service more appealing so they can more money?
---
You can probably wait a month and they'll sell levels if you're lazy, convenience is the name /s
---
And I would advise you to stay in ESO, unlike I did. This game will eventually get the 40 dollar Expansions, make no mistake. The devs will fuel this machine until it breaks. But we dont know how long that will take.
---
i mean ive never played ESO but yeah that is Pay to Win because they are actually getting NEW weapons and armors that other players simply cannot get without paying, which is what im saying that F76 hasn't done that with this update, if they threw in a new legendary weapon of some sort then yeah 100%!
---
If you don't play the game, why are you on the Fallout 76 Reddit?
---
The reason of the post was to discuss the update, but the title states it is an opinion.
---
I would absolutely love unlimited storage! (Because I love to hoard things) So much that I would pay for it if I truly NEEDED it. But I manage my inventory and don’t really need it. I have 100+ stacks of everything I need and still have room to spare.
---
Todd Howard has a very different dictionary to us. In his the definition of free is: *something added to a package, with no real value, that you already have to pay for in order to coax idiots into buying the whole bundle*
---
So sure, by his definition he'll probably give you a week free trial added into a atoms bundle.
---
The link is Google, man.
---
Don't worry. They put it on the backburner and will probably charge for their Wastelander DLC between 15 to 25 Dollar.
---
no, i paid for the game so i'll be mad at it. bite me.
---
I'm waiting for them to make it to where you can only give them constructive criticism or feedback if you pay a hundred points in the shop
---
What did you really think you were going to get somebody that went out and scrapped a bunch of fucking shit and crafted a helmet and sent it to you?
---
Make a friend who has one. I've got one if you're on PS4. I plan on starting Flea Market Fridays with other vending players
---
It should be 16.99 a month in Canada with current exchange rates, but is instead 17.99
---
It doesn't matter. It's about needing to use the stash box for junk. Sure I could free up some space. I can put deep pockets on my gear. I can do a bunch of things. It doesn't change anything. Infinite junk stash gives a direct advantage, and by definition is pay to win. That is the simple truth.
---
I got Fo4 the same time I got this game, only it was $20 for the goty, and fo76 was $40 on sale
---
They don't give new weapons, but it is easier to get legendary weapons with private servers, even without mods. Without interference I can run a nuke silo, nuke a place then grab everything for myself.
---
Jesus Fortnite-Dancing Christ, how the hell did Bethesda become so utterly *incompetent*? Ever since this game came out (before then, even) some new huge problem popped up seemingly every week, causing everything from lost items to crashed servers to players being unfairly permabanned. And every time they try to fix it, there's some major bug or oversight that ends up breaking the game and/or hurting players, like the whole fiasco involving people's private info getting leaked, or players gaining access to dev rooms. It's almost comical how consistent these incidents occur, always one step forward and three steps back. What the hell happened to Bethesda?
---
I know Bethesda games have a reputation for being glitchy, but now it seems like they're leaking into the real world.
---
Wastelanders wont be locked behind a paywall but i'm sure that it will only contain barebones stuff that is free.
---
90% of possible cosmetic items will only be available trough the atom shop.
---
Like new clothes for you companion etc etc
---
Dont worry they'll fix it in mere days unlike most bugs as you guys are the only thing they've got now
---
This guy would do better arguing on the people shitposting about how bad Bethesda is and how they crap on people. Lol. I agree with you 100%, OP.
---
They did also say very specifically that anything in the Atom Shop would only be cosmetic forever. "Because look, there's a line. And others have crossed it but it's important to clarify that we'll stay on the right side of it" (lol). They did say there'd be canvas bags. They did say Fallout 76 would "just work" and that it'd have 16 times the details of Fallout 4. They did say a lot of stuff. You must excuse me for not trusting Bethesda any further than i can throw them. And given they're a whole company with several office buildings, that's not very far
---
I agree, the argument is redundant, getting cosmetics has and IS one of the reasons people play games after they beat the game. In the before before times, you used to be able to unlock these skins or characters by completing challenges, it was part of the fun, a way to show that you went the extra mile. Now they use that as a way to justify MTX, oh, just buy them instead of grinding for them. OH you can only buy them now. OH YOU CAN ONLY .BUY THEM IF YOU BUY A CERTAIN SUB SERVICE. 
---
Its only going to get worse, and it wouldnt surprise me if in the future they do make grey blank mannequins as the default skin. Shit, thats basically what fortnite is right now. kids being bullied for having a default skin, for not paying for new skins, being harassed online for a FUCKING COSMETIC.
---
Drives me nuts
---
You can still see it from here [https://web.archive.org/web/20191024025803/http://falloutfirst.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024025803/http://falloutfirst.com/)

**Tinfoil Hat Time:** I was wondering about this in the car, does anyone else think it's strange that the Creation Club is still a *thing*? Like, it's never truly gone away. It's still there, lurking in the shadows.
---
Now, bear with me here, they mention modding coming soon to the game, right? Bethesda are too much of despots to just let us run our own servers, so that begs the question: Is this their plan? Their final solution, so to speak? Finally have a use for the Creation Club to sell us mods to use in this new Dedicated-But-Not-Dedicated and Server-But-Not-Actually-A-Server scheme?
---
It might seem far fetched at first, but the more I thought about it the more it seemed like their plan. They're still selling Scam Club points for their games, they're still upkeeping the whole system... You can't tell me it's just going to end there.
---
I swear, if the modding they announced for Fallout 76 has anything to do with the Creation Club - I'm going to go nuclear.
---
Works for me I guess
---
Correct if you convert from £-$ is in the uk would be paying $135 for an annual subscription it’s just legalised thieving
---
Eat shit.
---
Not 100% true. Some people have, yes, but not everyone.
---
Before I get downvoted into the earth for disagreeing, I'm disappointed in the update too. Just speaking from personal experience. Friends of mine bought it and don't have that problem.
---
&gt; all you bitching are ruining this sub
---
Why not point your anger towards the people who are causing us to bitch, instead of those who are upset?
---
Based on EVERY study and report done on the issue, that's not how "whales" work. I recommend you do some reading into the issue.
---
They are not millionaires, they are normal people with addiction issues who ruin their lives by dumping unbelievable amounts of cash into games, and children who are not at the developmental stage where they can think abstractly enough to not get caught by gambling style mechanics.   
---
A "whale" is just someone who got caught by gambling mechanics and had it destroy their life.
---
This need to be top, solid report 
---
No Todd, it just doesn't work ......ever
---
Where are you from? Because in the EU it's not illegal.
---
has to be the reason. look at the value that Bethesda is offering for such a trivial pittance..
---
Surprise mechanics at it's best huh?
---
Hey Bethesda stop making it hard to defend your game
---
"You don't actually participate in harmful practices so you don't get to complain about them". 
---
You and everyone else who pays for this are the problem. You are paying for something that should be in the game, for free. The fact that I see more than one person in this thread admit to buying the pass already makes me sick to my stomach.
---
Sorry all you get then is downvotes :(
---
Then get it on game pass, or play it on console.
---
If private worlds were free on launch we wouldn’t have had such a problem with duping and griefing
---
I think we, the haters, are bigger enthusiasts of Fallout than the people that kept playing. 
---
We know the highlights of the franchise, we know what it's capable of delivering, and we knew the full extent of the disappointment that Bethesda delivered.
---
I was extremely hyped for Fallout 76 and I couldn't wait for release. I didn't trust Bethesda enough to pre-purchase, especially after trying the game out during Beta (fortunately I got a key for £1). The abundance of bugs and the direction of the game elements made me decide to wait till the game was discounted to under £10. That actually happened after only 6 weeks, so I snatched it. I didn't play for longer than 20h, I just had zero motivation to power through the issues, and I still don't. I'll also definitely not be coming back now with the Fallout First bullshit.
---
So no, I'm not a hater, I'm a die hard fan who was massively let down.
---
That's how all item transfers work: it "destroys" the item from its original location, and then "creates" the item in its new location.  There's no reason the scrap container would need to work differently from any other, it's just limited to a single type of item (although, I'm waiting for hilarity to ensue if there's a bug that lets you store items of any kind in it).
---
Lol ahahahhaha
---
My experience so far was more pay for convenience. With the scrap box I literally freed up like 500lbs of junk in my stash (yeah that might be a problem of mine on it’s own). But now I run around freely with no concern for what I pick up knowing I can just scrap it all with no limits. Unlimited scrap means I can fix and craft whatever no worries. Also can bulk and sell it. So yeah it’s definitely pay for some advantage but I don’t know what I’m winning really.
---
I dont understand what u r up to? Seems like u r just throwing a pubescent tantrum mate.
---
4. Switch to better games without the shady tactics.
---
Well.......fuck a duck
---
Inside a game community isn't really a free market.  I can't go take my money to the competition, they possess control of my characters and stuff.  Changes to a described service where players agreed to something else entirely and have no say in what it becomes is some other kind of market.  Totalitarian market?  I dunno.  But not a free market.
---
The delicious irony
---
You understand that an mmo can't fund all their expansions from initial sales right? Are you dense
---
no you wont.  
---
there are some bada$$ kids claiming they will grief anyone with outfit but what are they gonna do?  
---
one kiddie says he is going to throw nades/orbital strikes until server crash... uh oh what a horrible grief... just reconnect anbd laugh  
---
to that kid with poor self-esteem  
---
if they attack they wont do any damage until you retaliate. so you can ignore them or kill them. and if you have friends they can kill those attackers too after they slap you...
---
If the mods actually enforced their own rules I don't think I'd know how to react
---
They said mods will come later.
---
fucking factssss
---
Or, since they failed to uphold their original publicly announced benefits of buying this game. Demand a refund.
---
than don´t say it´s not  possible because of lag in the first place. if there is a new way implemented than don´t say there is noway to your customers. The problem is not that they obviously changed the system how items are stored on the server, the problem is that they lie about it in the first place or after they find a solution they try to sell that solution to us. without even ever say somthing about a new solution for the stability problems. what let me think there never wars a stability problem or they dont even fix it or even worse they want to sell it to us from the start
---
No the point is this was a highly requested feature by the community and they have monotised the fk out of it, people forget this game was supposed to be cosmetic microtransactions only. People buying this pile of insults will just make them do it even more. It started with the repair kits and mainly fhe fridge. They get away with it though cause people choose to fund this stupidity
---
It is a role playing game - in FO76 you’re role playing being a sucker and having the piss took out of you whilst your bank disconnects you.
---
You spelt trial year wrong
---
another happy customer
---
and why you think I can't afford it?
---
Don't give them ideas, we've seen what they do with them
---
if people like u pay , then they wont care
---
Really? Link please. I've got Windows 8.1 and I'd have to pay for the upgrade.
---
Point is this sub can be enjoying for ppl playing the game. But everytime there's an update, it gets floodes with stupid posts that everything sucks. But they keep on playing it. While hating it. ...
---
I understand op and appreciate his post
---
Yup. The problem is that this game is filled with players who are single player only gamers and have never played an MMO before. Bethesda isn’t doing anything strange or unusual here, this is standard practice for an MMO and actually a pretty good deal given what you get for it compared to other titles. The price of the membership is less than what you’d pay for the atoms alone.
---
I was banned... Otherwise I would still be playing.
---
Or to better game with shady tactics. Fo76 isn't even good to have shit like this lol
---
Hey man, you too!
---
Its the same file, its just a regular server that has a lock on it that autodeletes when you leave it.
---
I hope most people are on Windows 10 by now. Windows 7 will be desupported this January.
---
Do you really think a casual player is spending that kind of money to effectively get unlimited grinding?
---
Lmao the hits just keep coming
---
Well, technically, TOW could be broken on release as well for what we know :D 
---
Oh by the way, if you bought a physical copy there'll be a pretty hefty day1 patch (\~18GB on PS4 and \~38GB on Xbox One)
---
Yeah it’s horrible....me and my buds bought the sub for one year and got to finally enjoy events without some pre-pubescent kid one shotting everything.
---
We launched nukes all night without having to crouch and stress like hell that some cloaked asshat was waiting for us to finish so they could Nuke our camp.
---
I didn’t have to worry about butthurt survivor mode brats kiting scorch bears into my camp.
---
Yeah man it was a terrible game experience.
---
Keep moaning about evil Beth and how we’re ruining the game by buying a sub then log into your pubbie world.
---
Is Bethesda paying you to suck their dick or are you doing for free??
---
I'm so happy this happened. I know its mean but anyone who is paying for this subscription deserves all the bad shit that comes to them. They are contributing to the downfall of gaming as we knew it by supporting these insidious practices. I honestly hope it ends up killing your hardware. Cheers
---
already got one of those collecting trash at my camp.
---
You don't get your own server. You get a server that people have already been in and looted
---
Bye!
---
Lol i always wanted to be the one saying it not the other way around
---
I'm on W8.1, I decided no to upgrade at the time because many older games were unsupported. I'd have to dish out £80 to switch now.
---
It is mindboggling to me that you would even consider buying it.
---
Stop blaming the customer seriously.
---
You actually think literally nobody is gonna buy this sub because of some greater good?
---
Furious/AA/Instigating then, if u dont want build specific.
---
Yo fallout 3 was anything but subpar, it’s just as good as new Vegas and Vegas just added things not in 3 but they were not in 1 and 2 but still fuck Bethesda
---
.................You guys deserve it at this point
---
Please dude, learn to read before you start making comments that make you look like an idiot. The post i was replying to was talking about SKYRIM. Last i checked Skyrim wasn't an MMO. Last i checked you had to pay extra for Skyrim DLC despite Skyrim beeing extremely successfull. Are you dense? Yes you are.
---
A brain possibly...who knows
---
Fissure sites, public event line in the Sand.
---
Well yea, nobody is complaining that it's from the community, they're complaining that it's basic stuff from the community that Bethesda is now trying to sell back to the community with a monthly sub. OF COURSE this was going to upset people!
---
Instigating is pretty good if you don't want to have low health and die more often than you would like.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20191024101229/http://falloutfirst.com/ this link works this shit is gold lmao.
---
I love when people don't understand how domain ownership works and think a domain can just be instantly yoinked from someone
---
Depends on playstyle. I would scrip that.
---
I cannot access it :(
---
Sorry bud but I wouldn't wear it, with the outrage on this sub atm you may aswell wear a 'grief me' sign
---
atleast have your fucking game not be full of 1000 bugs and damn near still in beta a year after before you try to scam me man, damn
---
Then again... even with moderate game time many players are maxed on caps and materials.
---
There’s nothing to spend them on
---
Cheaper ammunition and cores will help newer players.
---
Pete 'the Lying Wanker' Hines
---
So you tired to hop on the hate train by making shit up? Damn dog
---
It outclasses yours
---
Enjoy it.
---
because if you could you wouldn't be wasting your time on Reddit arguing with me.
---
People who play ESO are used to this type of subscriptions.
---
That’s not true at all I played for 5 hours yesterday and never ran across an area without enemies or loot
---
Says someone who complains on reddit about a game. Why don’t you instead email your complaint directly to Bethesda?
---
Every mmo that's been charging $15 a month and no one notices lol
---
The armour is nice shame it was introduced in such a shot show manner, although one of my concerns with the armour is it looks too clean for a post apocalypse in the images I've seen
---
I can, but I didn't spend real money for anything in this game and I don't plan to do this - up to yesterday all the cosmetics I wanted I could buy for atoms earned in the game, no real money involved. And I can discuss with you, because I got work that allow me to do that...
---
Oh look, a subjective statement that follows the theme of all your other comments. "oh shit this guy made a point against my point. Better shift what my point is."
---
I may come up with a picket sign and follow you, but really if people get that upset that you paid your own money to get something then screw those people who actually do something.
---
Unlimited scrap storage is a balance change. Something they promised would be free forever. Just demand a refund.
---
Def. agreeing with you my man
---
Anybody catch a screengrab of it before they pulled it?
---
&gt;I'm against it also
---
&gt;I know the game is trash
---
&gt;I know that Bethesda is human filth
---
&gt;I'm gonna buy it anyway
---
Show some spine ffs, you fricken drone. "Yeah I know they don't actually give me anything in return, but Bethesda made a thing so I have to mail them money."
---
I'm not defending them actually, nowhere did I say this is a good thing, or it's what I wanted.
---
Lmao fallout 76 sold less than 2 million copies at launch LMAO, TOW will outsell it and get better ratings
---
Would you mind listing some games that offer private servers for a subscription fee that in fact are not private servers but regular servers with a lock.
---
Which part of that wasn't in English?
---
Fallout: New Vegas is their most successful game and the one most people would know them for, not to mention closest in design to Outer Worlds than any other game they've made.  It doesn't really have anything to do with Bethesda.
---
12+ thousand point posts don't happen much in this sub, stay salty
---
That's exactly what it is.
---
Compare what The Witcher 3 CE had with FO76 CE.
---
It's fucking laughable.
---
They’re owned by Microsoft, money shouldn’t be an issue.
---
Depends on what you enjoy. Nuking Morgantown with zero lag with your team alone is wonderful.
---
Private worlds have 16 times the stability.    None stabler.
---
Just because you can find loot doesn't mean other players weren't there
---
What the hell is Gate keep?
---
Bethesda Business Strategy.
---
1. Create Game for sale. Restrict beta access to people who preorder in attempt to maximize purchases at 60 dollars.  
---
2. Cut content from game and sell that content from game back to players for additional money. 
---
 (I know you can earn atoms too.)
---
3. Quietly reduce usefulness of content  you had cut from a full prices game and sold back to players,  in order to make your next scheme more valuable. 
---
4. Pretend this a favor to your playerbase who stuck with your game through all the issues and act as if they should be greatfull.
---
5. Avoid addressing displeasure from your loyal fanbase. 
---
Not a good look.
---
Nothing. Just can’t add anymore to the box until you renew.
---
***"Only cosmetic"***
---
It's not their fault yall can't afford $12 a month
---
serves you right
---
But but but I PAID TO WIN!
---
"*The Wastelanders update for Fallout 76, originally promised for the autumn of 2019, has been delayed into 2020*"   :/
---
I wonder how long it'll take before they change it to "everyone has to have a 1st sub to login to a private world" ?
---
I would usually dive in too, the pricing doesn't repel me that much considering everything it offers but... the timing is just not right. Giving money to Bethesda right now, whether through an atom bundle or the one-month thing, is basically encouraging and agreeing with what they've done and it become more of a moral choice than a pricing one. :/
---
It sucks because had they offered the membership while they release Wasterlanders I wouldn't be here hesitating. But that's the only new novelty we'll get for a while.
---
Outer Worlds is available on game pass for PC on release day.
---
Drunk off of player tears.
---
Let’s see Wow, Eve-Online, FF11, FF14, Guild Wars 2, and Everquest you buy the game first and then pay sub.
---
Maybe you should try something other than Fartnight and Plebcraft.
---
Funny thing is you look at all the V bucks you’re buying and you could have already bought a 5 year sub to FO76.
---
Mostly for grinding the legendary spots without finding that someone is already there or that everything is either as ashes or green goo.  Server hopping to find same situations is time consuming and some of us have to take advantage of the little play time we can fit in.our real lives.
---
I’m aware, but I’m also confident in my connection
---
I'll be getting this 
---
I've also heard that Bethesda are planning to add in P2W items into the Atomic Shop before I was ok with Fallout 1st emphasis on ok but with that I may end up not playing it depending on what it is
---
&gt; My argument is that fo76 offers a pathetic amount of enjoyment for its price.
---
And yet here you are posting in the reddit group about the game.  Do you also hate vegetables?  You could go post in the Reddit broccoli group about how much you hate the stuff - enjoy !
---
The game can hold 24 players since the start, if they could patchwork the Fallout engine to support a multiplayer framework, they can absolutely make it happen.
---
This game is an absolute graveyard most of the time and the only reason that's different right now, was the promise of dedicated private servers. This isn't what the community wanted or hoped for. Bethesda has outdone themselves yet again.
---
Yes, because posts can't go below zero, only comments can. It has been that way since back when they made the limit to downvotes an account could accumulate cap at -100 due to accounts farming downvotes. Has nothing to do with bethesda or anything, that is just how reddit works.
---
Actually the game is very stable on private worlds
---
Don't they have schools where you live?
---
Same here
---
you deserve this
---
They must be desperate for something to keep the game’s servers paid for. Such a shame that they’ll be going offline after this. Thank God.
---
Exactly, I'll be getting this game
---
Well, almost, but for us they didn't take any damage, so the healthcare didn't go down and the armor they should have wasn't loaded in. And they teleported every second to a nearby location around the goo pile. May try to replicate the bug today if i have time.
---
Gatekeeping'
---
One who devalues other’s opinions on something by claiming they’re not entitled to the opinion because they’re not qualified, the rightful decision-maker, a part of a particular group, etc.
---
I'm glad honestly. Serves y'all right for giving into this leech company.
---
Biggest problem is there is NO enough content to play with. After the short main quest was solved, all I do everyday is to launch nuke and fight SBQ. It's getting boring.
---
https://www.microsoft.com/fi-fi/software-download/windows10 it's in Finnish but i believe you are able to find the English version.
---
No, the Washington Post is not a terrible clickbait farm like those other outlets. It's a real newspaper.
---
If you pick up and sell the guns you get from enemies, you can build up caps and fast travel wherever
---
Oh ok, but Im free to remove whats inside correct?
---
How do you know that it was Bethesda that took it down?
---
Your reddit comment just made Bethesda bankrupt!
---
Jk you did fucking nothing.
---
I'm buying Bethesda games.
---
Private *world*
---
as long as whales keep giving them money they'll act as nothing ever happened lmao
---
I'd say yes - you probably lost a lot of time running empty areas without mobs that you could kill and get valuable items and experience.
---
People who don't buy games from the main offender publishers grows with every passing year. And new developers/publishers become new targets of the movement because of their practices. We might be a minority, but we are a sizable and growing minority, and our decision to not buy is felt by much lower profits than they would have otherwise. Many people are ignorant about many things, but this movement of not buying games from those companies, like EA, Activison, Bethesda, etc. may be a minority now, but all it will take for the rest to get on board is already being fulfilled by the companies themselves.
---
Oh it's fucking gorgeous
---
I wasn't going to touch outworlds, because wastelanders was coming.
---
Turns out only further monetization came.
---
Outerworlds, welcome to my library.
---
Nah, fuck it, I quit. Just unsubbed, the last FO76 related material I'll ever read is you trying to defend poppa Bethesda's business decisions, which makes me so very glad that i never have to see stupid crap like this again :)
---
yeah thats exactly my point.
---
Thats a stupid analogy. Tell that to the MANY games that went bankrupt. Lionhead Studios, Atari, THQ, Pandemic Studios... No offense but do you not know what overhead is?
---
I used to run 3 businesses and now I only run 2. Not very big ones mind you, just my own home thing but I am responsible for writing checks to about 6 people every couple weeks. The game is failing plain and simple. 
---
Companies aren't calling home to their wives but companies must answer to shareholders and when a gaming company has only 29% of the player base that fallout 4 did post launch (see True Achievements for this info) and a WEAK Open-Critic score of 53, they need to do SOMETHING to justify keeping these servers opened.
---
You can only operate at a loss for so long until you realize the fat needs to be cut. Bethesda has many things going for them, Fallout 76 is NOT one of them. Its an abandoned BETA testing piece of dog shit.
---
This is definitely the best post I've seen amongst the shitstorm today.
---
Im not saying to boycott bethesda cause clearly nobody will, but i wish the devs would at least fix the game or give mod support before shoving a years membership at us for a game that doesn't even seem finished. It annoys me that they will get away with this and continue to do more things like this
---
Pay me 15€ a month and I will be happy to give you my stuff! 
---
I call Me 1st Membership.
---
You mean like everyone else is doing to me now?
---
These are convenice that wins you nothing.
---
None of these things actually impact the game much.
---
Again, as a person who doesn't really play the game, you'd just look stupid if you keep arguing.
---
I'd say bloodied or AA with faster swing and 40% power attack damage if that's possible
---
I will volunteer for rehoming all the abandoned Xbox legendaries as a service to a community in need.
---
I confess to being out of the loop when it comes to upcoming games, and had no idea what this even was. After reading about it I am absolutely stoked. This really takes the sting out of being kicked in the nuts by Bethesda. Looks like an awesome game, and I have Gamepass already, so this is a no-brainer.
---
Bethesda could come out and say "fuck all the morons still draining time into our bullshit game" and this sub would be like. "Its ok I really like this game anyway. Just bought the $100 sub!"
---
you sold me a Troubleshooting shottie for ammo awhile ago so I still love you.
---
lol amazing
---
99.9% of these people claiming they are leaving the game, wont actually leave. They just love bitching.
---
Kinda like... (Not to get political) But the people that claimed they were moving to Canada when Trump got elected. They bitched and moaned and never left.
---
Honestly this is a supper disgusting update. I've uninstalled the game and I recommend every one else does the same. Bestesday doesn't care about their consumers any more and are happier to destroy good will and the worth of their word for a view bucks.
---
Everyone is corrupt and selfish in their own way. Enjoy the games and dont be an asshole to people who do.
---
Early levels you’re better off walking everywhere. Try to put your camp somewhere in relation to Vault 76 that they both give you maximum fast travel benefits spread out. When you get higher level you’ll get caps easier and can start focusing on selling things. Take advantage of the train vendors too and sell what you don’t need. Hard Bargain and Travel Agent perks are good to have and turn on just when needed.
---
PSA:  Everything with FO76 is glitched.   Why would you pay a monthly fee for glitches?
---
love how the title is chosen that you dont get critics from the anti 1st part of this community. its kinda sad how this community changed over night. seeing people are happy for other happening bad things (losing scrap i.e.) is even more sad for this community.
---
cant help you with your problem sadly. hope you find a solution.
---
who are you kidding,you know you will buy it,if you shelled out so much cash before,you will again,because its your money and nobody will tell you how to spend it...
---
or because you are a sucker and Bethesda milked you like a paypig
---
&gt; Because ethics don't feed people.
---
Bruh
---
I don't think I need to say any more.
---
Funny like it...
---
...but they aren't giving you infinite storage for free. You're paying for it. 
---
If you're giving them money they can easily scale up their servers and allow you to do that.
---
As a software engineer surely you know that servers and storage aren't free
---
Bro message me the process pls I have first let’s talk check dm
---
Evil Corp &lt;3
---
:)))
---
Oh fuck, he's right. I was curious as to why it was called Fallout 1st, but he's hit the nail on the head (or the coffin in the this case).
---
Not really
---
Sorry but it's not frame rate issues. My computer can handle it, it's not the framerate that's lagging, it's the latency.
---
But if the problem I have is server-sided then everyone is having the same lag as me and honestly nobody would play. When you press left click to hit in melee for example, your player actually do the movement instantly but the actual impact is registered only 2 seconds after that and then at this moment the enemy has moved and is not at the same place anymore.
---
spoken like a true capitalist! amen brother!
---
No way lol.
---
The player base was going to drop regardless on the controversy. I feel like mos Fallout fans have been waiting for it.
---
From what they said yes but who knows really until a month from now.
---
It is with great sadness, that I agree with you.
---
They did
---
I'm just impressed you have a group of friends that play fo76
---
Not even gonna ask why
---
oh her husband will feel very bad that a completly unknown kid from the internet is now disappointed :D
---
'are the same people that pay good money to shorten their life with cigarettes and alcohol'
---
Classic gatekeeper
---
After-action report - Patch 14 installed:  Game started as before patch.  Obnoxious Grafton Mayor announcement interrupted by crash to desktop.  Restarted.  Grafton Mayor mercifully silent.  Spawned near railyard east of Watoga into gang of Scorched attacking 5 Glowing Gulpers being attacked by a lvl40 1\* Legendary Scorched Beast being attacked by 2 Assaultrons and a couple of Protectrons.  I open up on the Scorched Beast.  Five minutes and 750 rounds of .50 caliber ammo later, the Scorched Beast dies . . . but the corpse bursts into flame and nothing, NOTHING, lands on the ground.  No pile of ashes.  No "decent loot."  I'm not impressed . . . but at least the bloody Grafton Mayor is gone, eh?
---
Yeah there's regular xbox game pass for the console, that's $10 a month, then there's "xbox game pass for PC" which is $5 and have a smaller library of games, but OW is one of them. And then there's "game pass ultimate" for $15 a month that gets you both
---
I would like to do some capture the workshop type PvP that would be pretty cool.
---
And everyone is entitled to their own opinions, just like your cynical retort.
---
You said yours, I'm going to continue to say mine. I'm not being an asshole, so don't dismiss me. It's a company doing shady things, it doesn't need you to protect it.
---
Nihilist@arbys right. Brandon Kelly is awesome.
---
That's kind of what you get for paying for this bullshit
---
1) I don't smoke or drink alcohol
---
2) that being said, me being able to pay to shorten my life would be a fucking bargain for me 
---
3) people with the atom store items might not be the same who are complaining. Especially the ones who seem to have bought everything. Some people could have used free atoms to buy them
---
4) the issue isn't just with atoms and cosmetics. It's utility items being paywalled
---
Regardless, my point is still valid.
---
It's like people that complain fuel is too expensive, but will then go and buy a bottle of water which is more per litre than the fuel!!
---
Too many people in this world do not see the bigger picture.
---
I will not miss a tenner a month, I won't even notice I'm paying it, in fact I'd happily pay a tenner just so I don't have to waste day after day being salty about the subscription.
---
It will work just like the ESO crafting bag with the subscription. All your stuff stays in it if your subscription expires, you’ll be able to take stuff out off it, you just won’t be able to add to it until you re-up your subscription.
---
Sign me up. It's the least they can do.
---
For some people planning out their build is part of the fan. Fallout 4 and 76 does away with that but in the process makes for little variety in playthroughs resulting in less replayability. Dont get me wrong im not hating on 4 and 76, hell i have 1200+ hours on 4 (with mods).
---
Yes, hi Bethesda after 500 hrs of gameplay I'd like a refund please. I'm very salty about the subscription service.
---
You def called it
---
Hate train? Seriously? I've been playing this game since March. Why would i play it if i hated it. Think before you assume.
---
That link is just ISO.
---
You have to register it and pay for it.
---
If you've done it under 30 days ago it's all fine, but after 30 days you'll be getting the request to register your copy.
---
I assume it works like ESO’s craft bag so I assume so.
---
Just wait 'til the Nukashine visual effects end and then you'll see (if it's working correctly).
---
Indeed
---
Personally not a fan of just straight up shooters any more (my reactions have slowed over the years), but its got to be better than what this has become.
---
Of course you have to pay extra for Skyrim dlc.
---
Wtf are you on about? Why wouldn't you?
---
No thats not really at all it, im saying that there is nothing to conplain about rn in my mind and i will complain when there is and that is how i work in situations like this
---
Removed :(
---
Not quite.  Its a private sessions on a bethesda server.  If you were renting an actual server, you would get admin control.
---
That's literally how mtx, and p2w gets so bad. Do small things, increase shit incrementally.
---
The scrapbox with unlimited capacity able to be used both in private and public servers
---

---
i have an idea todd that'll bring in loads of cash!
---
SELL THE IP
---
I’m on PC with one as well and have no problem with friends joining. I’ve had a few already and I just play and let them enjoy the no lag atmosphere.
---
You say you oppose it and then you buy in, and afterwards are still defending it after they fucked you. 
---
Sorry pal you deserved this, quit supporting this disgusting game and shit company already.
---
Props to that dude
---
They didn’t forget. They already have a site and have no need for that.
---
With no mods, cutomization, only 8 people, and you can't add or kick people it's just shoved into your friends list (you have to unfriend to kick someone and they invite themselves).
---
You keep the Scrapbox, but you won't be able to put more scrap into it unless you resub.  You can casually remove what's presently in there as you need it, though.  As far as I can tell, the Scrapbox is just treated like an extension of your Stash, so whenever you craft/modify/repair things, the game knows to pull from it if it needs to.  But your Scrapbox only exists at your CAMP, so if you're on the road and need to dump of your junk in a Stash Box, you might need to manually transfer it later.
---
It's just like in past cases when you had more weight in your stash than the total stash.
---
That said, there may be a weird edge case where a Scrapbox gets destroyed.  While it's connected to your Stash, it's not physically viewable from your Stash.  If you lose the ability to reconstruct the Scrapbox, what happens?  No idea.
---
Um...ok?😂😂😂
---
Well as I pointed out, 1500 subscribers is only enough to pay a single developers annual salary. They must really be struggling for cash, especially since new people buying the game isn't really happening.
---
Canvas shortage, you mean, you even believe Bethesda? There is no canvas shortage anywhere in the world. if you want 50 containers full of canvas bags with your logo, you can pick up from Hong Kong next week.
---
Fallout 4 wasn’t exactly amazing either. That’s what I consider the beginning of the end for Bethesda.
---
Couldn't have happened to a more deserving company.
---
Hey, here's a weird idea. I can be angry at ALL THREE OF THEM at once. They've all been terrible and stupid, and all deserve to have the people in charge dragged out and pelted with rotten tomatoes.
---
No it’s not rendered, it goes into a bag with the list of values. Rendered stuff is things physically on the person (gear, weapons, etc) and all the junk items you find laying around BEFORE scrapping. That’s why the scrap box forces you to scrap the junk items when you put things in it. It can’t hold them all as is (that’s your stash box). Sure some ammo and scrap have physical renders prior to picking up (like a box of ammo or a box of springs) but it’s not the same thing technically as what they actually end up being, a bunch of numbers. Speaking of ammo, don’t be surprised if an ammo box is next. Same concept.
---
DMCA Takedown for Copyright most likely
---
&gt;"and can be used in both public and private worlds"
---
Nah. That was Bethesda's unedited first draft.
---
Right keep telling yourself that, truth is its not hurting their bottom lines. EA hasn't lost the money people claim it has, its stocks are even higher than it was during the battlefront ERA. Activision hasn't lost any value yet people keep saying their not buying it, their stocks haven't dropped as much as they claim. 
---
Uplay does and it couldn't care less because the minority is just that a minority that lies to itself and those around them. 
---
Bethesda might alter a few things etc. Your not changing anything, no one will at least not how people are right now. For those that follow through and do move on and ( never support it fgoing forward.) I commend them. But those are few and won't grow enough to make a difference. Because some of them forget and return into it. Its human nature.
---
That is so awesome of that person. To funny but hey it just works !
---
That's good for you mate but others may not have the luxury of throwing a tenner away each month
---
I'd be willing to be they just hope this blows over and people forget.  Problem is, this isnt the summer drought.  Starting tomorrow, people have significant games to move on to.  They have a great chance to lose a significant number of what's left of the playerbase.  Hell, I'd be willing to bet after the Halloween event public servers will be near dead.
---
and then i'll get that "activate windows" which doesn't matter atleast to me.
---
Yes I saw it in the original post, but it's quite unrealistic don't you think? When people decide not to pay the next month, puff everything they've worked on in private mode disappears. They should simply add an offline mode (free), and make assets uninterchangeable with online mode. That way at least you always have what you earned and not worry about losing anything. Apparently Bethesda isn't going that route.
---
All they have to do is stay quiet for a few weeks. Once this thing has become normalized they will come back and most of us won't give a shit anymore. Or most of us will be gone. But if we aren't paying the subscription fee why would Bethesda give a shit about us?
---
you just called a 1st dumb?! GUARDS?
---
Honestly, even repair kits are sold for real money. Point black NO practical way to repair your guns without them. They even left the Pipe Gun perk from day one where it says "repair costs cut in half" but you can't repair them at all unless you pay for something that has ALWAYS been available to do in Fallout. It's this first, then worse and it's indicative of systemic money scrounging and extorting their most loyal players. Instead of inspiring people to spend money, they're wrenching your arm and saying "at least it's not pay-to-play".
---
You keep trying to change the wording of what I'm saying to control the conversation, but try actually directly answering a question. Not being able to do that is a true sign of looking bad. . 
---
Does having a free mobile healing /cooking station and stash (not just a scrapbox, but also your full stash) give you an advantage over those who don't have them?
---
Never trust corporations. Sadly they are there to make money, and some of the worst ones like the aforementioned Bethesda is willing to burn their audience and future consumers and use up all the good will it had to cash out.
---
You can unequip your PA helmet and equip the tin foil hat. No need to exit the armor. I do this for the Fascnact mask challenges.
---
Also, congrats on finding that elusive bastard.
---
[https://youtu.be/lTqVMeZIbWU](https://youtu.be/lTqVMeZIbWU)
---
I'm glad I have standards and never bought this game, nonetheless pay for MTX in a *Fallout* game. I guess most gamers don't give a shit tho.
---
THE day the real bomb drops on 76
---
Does somebody know what can you buy for these atoms you get monthly? I guess it's not much because well Bethesda
---
That’s awesome!
---
So. Much. This.
---
Of all the companies that I felt might be able to offer a live service game without it becoming a cesspool, it was Bethesda. Man, I was so wrong.
---
Look, I actually enjoy the game, and I think it's a wonderful world. But this sub thing might actually be worse than anything EA or Activision has done. It's a kick in the sack (my apologies to any female players who don't actually own a sack) for anyone who gave them chance after chance after chance. All these things they want money for should have been added for free. If they want money, then ante up with some top-shelf DLC as part of it.
---
I'm done with this shit. From now on, single player or games with local and online coop only.
---
Still works for me tho :'D
---
The hardest part to swallow is that they most likely knew this was coming when the game launched. Specifically, that there were many lies or lies of omission regarding why certain things were implemented in the base game, such as unlimited (scrap) storage.
---
Portugal here! No data cap (upload/download), fiber 100Megs FTTH for 50€ :) 
---
INSTALL ALL THE GAMES!
---
Except fallout 4 was extremely well received and still has a larger playerbase today than any previous Bethesda games.
---
It really comes down to what areas you're walking through and levels of mobs.
---
I find that I make most money by bulking and selling junk.  Walking everywhere was detrimental to this for me because I didn't run into enough mobs to make up for what I'd kill if I fast travelled to a new area.
---
This may not be everyone's experience though.  But if you stop at every building and pickup anything not nailed to the background, you'll make more.
---
It’s worked so far
---
Do you think the Media is giving this game a bad rep? Did you ever think Bethesda is literally responsible for shitting in our mouths? You argue as Trump does, someone commits a crime, and you want to send the people to jail that reported on it.
---
Been wearing it for a few hours now and I've had 3 requests for photos and zero greifing.  I guess everyone who's raging ain't playing, shame.
---
Not on PS4
---
nope, it isn't fallout last, Bethesda last. Fallout 1st proves Beth's other work is also greedy garbage same as FO76.
---
seems I can't connect to the site. what a shame
---
Stop paying them to screw you over!
---
Jesus, you guys never learn, keep giving Bethesda money, and then whine when it blows up in your face.
---
No sympathy.
---
This is one of the most immature things I’ve seen in video games 😂😂😂
---
I cannot for the life of me figure out why people still play this beyond dumpster fire of a game.
---
That's cool. Thanks gamer
---
Lmaooo
---
Bethesda isn't going to try to get more bad press by suing someone for stuff that's not even worth their time
---
To be fair, this sub is being brigaded hard right now by a ton more people than usual who want to see Bethesda burn.
---
Is it as clean looking as it appears in the images?
---
It's also available through Microsoft/game pass on pc
---
The working scrap box wil be soon added. It can be rented for an additional 12.99 per month. best Regards Bethesda.
---
That's what we are to Bethesda it seems, just seem idiot nerds that only deserve to be robbed. Ugh, I feel so bad that I bought this game...
---
Oh yeah. I confused the post with the comment on Battlefront II that got most downvotes. I do remember after that happened there was a change to something with the upvotes and downvotes of posts being hidden for a period of time. Also with Steam reviews after GTA got review bombed, then there was a change with the review system. It seems to me like these changes are to protect corporations from mass public action. But yeah thanks for informing me about my mistake.
---
did you buy FF? if yes then you are the reason friend
---
It’s honestly the biggest con of the gaming industry. What Bethesda has done is almost illegal lol
---
They put infinite junk stash behind a paywall not total stash. Although cutting out junk is a huge growth in stash weight
---
didnt see any answer in one of the post.
---
nuka crypt devtracker doesnt show anything, too.
---
whoa what happened? you deposited stuff into the scarp box and it disappeared for that character? but the same junk WAS available to other characters?
---
They key seems to be scrapping normally at a crafting station and then transferring to the scrap box. No issues for me when following that formula. Still needs to be fixed but that seems to be the work around.
---
If this guy gets a cease and desist letter we gotta start him a GoFundMe to fight the legal battle, fuck bethesda I'd rather contribute $100 to this guy than their shitty subscription
---
Lol nah I’m just enjoying the game. You can hate all you want.
---
I really, really hope he's wrong. I can see it happening though!
---
Even with 20% VAT still being overcharged by $15
---
No chance crowdfunding could fight this legal battle
---
Bethesda is excited to release a $300 special edition for the next fallout. It's a good thing you're such a good fan and will buy it to prove it.
---
Proof?
---
There are thousands of people on this sub now who have never even played the game just here for the circlejerk.
---
And your post has no proof.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing but logging in earlier my junk has gone.
---
They're not charging again for all content is a subscription model like every other f******* game out there. Either get over it or play a different game.  You whining about it is not going to change anything.
---
Don’t tell me how to interwebz!
---
I did something similar. Before I heard of this bug I logged into a public world, put all my junk in the junk box, logged into a private world, logged out and logged back into a public world. I still had all my junk (on PC.) 
---
Maybe the issue occurs when adding stuff to the junk box on a private world? Either way, I pulled out all my stable flux and put it in my normal stash.
---
I plan on cancelling after the first month, anyway... I just didn't mind spending $13 for the atoms, outfit, etc. Plus checking out the private world seemed interesting.
---
Someone expected a near Fortnite size player base with similar cosmetic sales when they planned that.
---
Clearly their own lack of ability to ship a product that is stable and functions as expected at launch or even several months after launch and many other smaller miss steps made them miss the goal on that one substantially. 
---
This game has so much potential that if they stewarded it better I think it could do well as a container for lots of fallout adventures but alas I don't trust Bethesda to do that.
---
Haha.
---
I still enjoy the game, but if /u/Jitsu-G says so I guess I have to go do something else.  Thanks for letting me know.
---
“Do what we asked but do it for free!” 
---
Stupid ass, how do you expect everything to be free Bethesda isn’t a fucking charity.
---
I don't get that with the current $0.78 = £1. The monthly price is a $0.18 "win" for the UK and the annual price is a $6-7 loss. You need to take the 20% of the UK price to reach comparative parity (prior to applying an exchange rate). 
---
Bethesda has certainly massaged prices a little though to hit the £XX.99 price points
---
Yeah, shamelessly scammed is a better description.
---
People can spend their money on whatever they want.
---
Stop telling people what to do with money they earned.
---
If you mean not dirty then no it's not clean. The ears don't glitch through the helmet unlike other helmets and in my opinion it looks frickin awesome.  Easily the best outfit in the game atm, I've had to stop wearing my responders fireman outfit, it's that good.
---
Nope used my own scrapbox and its all gone now.
---
On point 
---
Bethesda had a best friend state for me but with this they stept nah jumpt right over every border i we accept 
---
This was the day my heart broke and the greed won
---
Just 8 h for outerworlds i hope for the best
---
What dark secret shall I share with you?
---
Moving to another country vs not booting up a game is a little different.
---
Doing what I asked for?
---
Because I asked to be nickle and dimed for new features that should be in the base game in the first place, I understand Private Servers costing money, but more building space? Really?
---
You probably already bought it, so you really won't care about what I say, because Bethesda can apparently do no wrong in your mind.
---
I thought whales are trust fund kids, Arab sheiks and investment bankers?
---
So the mods are still deleting posts, but not replying. Nice
---
This is pure gold, it takes a lot to unite /v/ on 4chan but this did it and funnily enough was more entertaining than the game :)
---
This is golden.
---
Any other companies like IO?
---
If you are leaving the game then give me your stuff
---
Saying that people should have to buy into a predatory practice in order to have a say about it is next level stupidity to defend your trash actions.
---
I don't need to pay someone to get kicked in the crotch to tell people how much it sucks.
---
It's not even comparable, on one hand you have a political situation where a games company is bending to the will of an authoritarian government and targeting an individual, causing financial harm to him, for exercising a basic human right. 
---
And on the other hand you a vocal minority of users of an online game stamping their feet and pouting about an optional subscription they don't agree with.
---
That's what I've been doing out of habit more than anything.
---
Lmao you mean you want your moms money back now.
---
That Todd actually owns that site and it’s a master troll move.
---
True I kind of agree the big issues isn't the affording of it, it's the principle behind it that people feel Bethesda has betrayed them.
---
my overall concern is dirty tactics like this and the impact this has on the future of this franchise, even before this announcement large amounts of fans who have followed throughout the franchise are turning away and I've stopped even suggesting it to others due to how  badly it was received in the first place 
---
At this rate I'm concerned there may not be enough of a desire to continue the franchise if the fan base is dying out/ or becoming smaller  and new players already have a vision of fallout as a no go
---
I bought it a few months after it came out. Think about 200 into it now. Fallout1st is not only them depositing poo into my mouth. 
---
Hey, Bethesda can you give fallout back to obsidian?
---
I am getting every last penny out of this, in the form of complaining for entertainment.
---
Free to play mechanics are still free to play mechanics. Generally speaking, without f2p, you pay upfront and less over time. And I haven't played Guild Wars 2. But I don't really care about your opinion. Poeple think warframe is fair, its the same shit. For people that enjoy the game they can tolerate it though.
---
You can borrow it for a week, but then I’m gonna need it t back.
---
In 2019 you are better off playing games from indie developers. triple A game makers DO NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! Jesus christ, had a convo with a kid yesterday talking about "how was I manipulated if I got what I paid for." 
---
Fucking morons will pay money for anything and not think twice about it, that's their demographic. Not real gamers.
---
K bye stop posting.
---
This sub usually has 3000 people on it
---
It now has 8000.
---
So over half the people here now don't play fallout 76 and probably never have. 
---
So they've essentially taken over the sub.
---
How to summon a thicc succubus.
---
Pharma Farma is good for additional income as well.  Just get a feel for how much income you can get via scrap or loot and balance it against FT cost.  Some events, like that environmental one, dont pay for themselves.
---
Also, dont build a great base, but build a mobile camp that you can use as a FOB and relocate it in your AO.
---
I am genuinely happy this is happening. I know this is mean but all if you deserve it and were asking for it.
---
The truth is... The Todd was rigged from the start
---
everyone with a brain has been saying this game was shit before it even came out, then when it came out, and after every fucking thing the company did. Yet you kept defending it. Have a good nap in that bed you made.
---
They probably are taking the Anthem approach. AKA build up from the ashes of what remains after the fire burns everything.
---
I guaranteed they'll start talking about this blows over
---
Your assumption is that everyone buying fallout 76 is also buying Fifa year after year?
---
bye kid
---
Anybody on your friends list can join you via the Social menu when you are in your own Private Server.
---
He already paid for the domain. It's his. He could put pictures of his cat vomiting up hairballs on it and Bethesda couldn't do anything about it except offer him money to buy it off of him.
---
Huh, I use a furious ultracite gatlaser, they drop like flies.
---
I bought the halloween bundle and switched out my vendor for the new one. Its showing all my stuff from all my vendors. It may even be showing my stash which is scary. I will have to look in detail when I get off work.
---
When I first logged on yesterday I transferred all my junk and scrapped all my bulk. Played for a few hours, constantly adding junk to the box. This morning I logged on to public to check some vendors out and in someone’s camp was their stash box and I transfer the junk I had on me. Logged out after a while and went back to private sever and my stash box is empty. I had over 100 flux which I put in there as my stash has been at max for days.
---
So the coat is a port from NV?
---
What if it’s just a *v o i d*
---
Concur.
---
There are no iems in the atom shop (or on private servers) that without said item an Adventure player would be absolutely 100% unable to successfully reach and complete the endgame (launch a nuke and kill the queen).
---
“There’s never going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s thirteen dollars por month – all our content, there’s season pass and... MAYBE no paid DLCs.".
---
Hate Lies
---
That's what whales get for giving them money.
---
A little bit of both.
---
What do you recommend they do instead of the premium subscription?
---
At this point just release a Todd skin and emote. 4000 atoms.
---
Once again. How are they winning? And don’t they still have to grind for the stuff like everyone else lol? HUH???! 😂😂😂😂😂
---
**To those joining us to complain**
---
We must collectively strike the game. The lack of players and daily profit will send the message that we aren’t your guinea pigs. They will either give us what we were promised, or the game will cease. This will show what is truly important to them, keeping their money or keeping their customers. Fallout 76 needs a strike, a boycott. This is absurd and will not go profitably unpunished.
---
14000 looks like a look of Netflix.
---
Lol, good to know. That means I don't care about your opinion either. You haven't played something but still insult it. What a joke of a troll you are.
---
In order to summon a Succubus, you must... *Subscribe to Fallout First to unlock this content*
---
Honestly, you did it to yourself at this point.
---
Probably having a drink and laughing at you, because they don't care about the vocal reddit minority, would wish they would go away, and they will still make money.
---
This game isn't exactly filled with FPS pros. But I'm sure you did good. I haven't actually played that mode yet. Don't know if I will. Never really played or liked BR type games. Prefered the Co-Op Save the World in Fortnite.
---
this is the funniest shit i read in years!
---
It's the same context. Claiming you're going to do something just for the sake of complaining and not actually doing it. That was the point that you obviously missed
---
Its down for me. Is it down for anyone else?
---
For people not getting it and/or not reading the actual post due to subrage - I’M NOT QUITTING THE GAME I’M JUST NOT PLAYING FOR A WEEK WHILE I’M HOLIDAY
---
The side quests were literally the best part of it excluding the major quests like the Dark Brotherhood, and Thieves Guild
---
Ok so it isn’t because I used someone else’s. Did you stay on private or go on public at all? After I used another players stash I then logged back onto private.
---
If you placed junk in your stash box, then no one else can touch it.   
---
If you placed your junk in one of the pubic game boxes like a cigarette machine, suitcase, etc. then it's free for all to take.  
---
You can build things like a toolbox in your CAMP and they will be linked to your stash.  However, only stash boxes in the wild, like the blue boxes at train stations and red rocket sites, are linked to your stash.   
---
Also, the Overseer's stash box looks like the standard stash box but is a public box.   When you point to it or open it the title will change to Overseer's stash instead of My Stash.
---
Bethesda or the players?
---
Wishing you best of luck on bagging a Torontonian!
---
Can confirm this happened to my friend
---
&gt;Also looks like things like Hardened Mass won't go in there 
---
This looks like it is probably a bug and has been reported as such so hopefully it'll get patched next round
---
Oh shit. I’ve yet to return to public servers. Only played briefly yesterday. Shit I’m wondering if I need to put it back in my stash before going public again. Ugh fucking Todd.
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING?
---
Pro-tip. When walking down queen st, yell out Weeeeeeeeee. You’ll know you did it right if you get a reply.
---
Of course not. Getting refunds for games you bought ages ago is always ok😂😂👍🏽
---
people dont understand how server stability issues happen. its not from the amount of junk. it doesnt matter if you have 1000x steel or 1xsteel. what the server stability kills is the amount of items at all. so having 200 holotapes, 500recipes, 200 weapons, 200 armor etc would kill the server stability.
---
when you have like 1000x steel in your stash and take 500x. then you just created one more item.
---
Sounds like a fulfilling existence.
---
There is a reason the saying "money is the root of all evil" exists. It even dates back to biblical times.
---
We should have seen this coming years ago, the day Bethesda first sold us Horse Armour in Oblivion. We didnt. We ignored it and put up with changes because they have made us wonderful worlds to play in. I love Tamriel and the Wasteland still. I can't do this anymore Bethesda. I can't defend 76 to my friends anymore. 
---
I have loved my time in Appalachia, meeting people and almost defiantly still enjoying myself despite the dalays, despite the disappointment. I almost played Fallout 76 in spite of Bethesda and Zenimax. Maybe I needed 76, we needed Bethesda to lead us here. 
---
I loved your games and I will still play Fallout 3, 4, and Elder Scrolls but I can't support you going forward. I need to put down my childish things and move on.
---
It's no problem I know how to type lol
---
I've seen too many people defend the micro transactions, it's insane
---
No, I would first think they wouldn't buy it because it offers abhorrent garbage at an inflated price, which subsequently funds an awful company.
---
Second, I would think they wouldn't buy it because they don't want to fund an awful company's awful business practices.
---
Third, I would think that. That's the hopeful dream. That people would actually unite for a greater good, no matter how little it is, or what it impacts.
---
Just a dream.
---
Intersting, yeah my main concern with the outfit was the promo imgaes what are the stats? Does the helmet provide the protection and minus perception? Curious as I know at least one of the helmets in the atom shop provides the protection without the negative stats
---
Too late, tooooooo many already paid...
---
BECAUSE I’M OLD
---
https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/punctuation/apostrophe-rules.html
---
How many atoms were you given to say that?
---
You're right, my bad. Having unlimited space for junk totally isn't an advantage compared to someone who has limited junk. Shit, what what I thinking.
---
Heh, DMCA with some lawyers that can spend money, can make lots of things happen, even if the host is in a country where the DMCA does have no legal standing.
---
Great idea. I'll also lock half of it behind a sub-based pay-wall, and the emote is actually a trial emote which will be lost unless you subscribe
---
Death is a preferable alternative.
---
I don't know about a million but I bet several thousand wouldn't be out of the question 
---
If not, I would personally spend a good amount of time loading the page with embarrassing Fallout related stuff. Shitty memes and the like.
---
That is precisely what you are supposed to do if you don't like the offering. You are literally supposed to not pay for it and not use it. I hope this has been a lightbulb moment for you in your development and will help you transition into adulthood with less pain and suffering. 
---
Meanwhile, those of us who have paid and are using the service actively are sending are also exercising our freedom of choice in the consumer market.
---
It was always too late for this "game".
---
How do you know they changed it?
---
Who else would?
---
Just when you thought they could do any worse they go and do it again. What a load of bullshit. I scrapped playing this game 4 months after release but all I can say is.. they are charging $100 per year for that bullshit subscription is because they made nowhere near what they wanted to make from the game sales. Greedy greedy company... shame on you. I hope no one buys this seriously.
---
Prevents damage and disease from airborne hazards, no penalties listed.  Just checked my stats and doesn't appear to have lowered any of them.
---
But they already sell you bugs.
---
Um what?😂😂😂😂😂🖖🏾
---
Well the community keeps paying them, so why would they?
---
That’s what I’ve been doing.
---
I was on full servers on PS4 , lots of players in ranger armor.
---
Logic and reason? Are you serious? Wow.
---
Why make money of course!
---
You're aware how to farm, right? I can easily farm 6-10k lead in about an hour.
---
If you'll excuse me, I'll be playing the Outer Worlds for the rest of forever instead.
---
You can get it on Windows Store or get Gamepass for PC.
---
The entire Free States line is bugged at a terminal for me still, despite seeking support. I have everything I need and only have to interact with a terminal yet it goes nowhere no matter what I have tried. All Bethesda offered for support was sending a guide on how to complete the quest but that’s useless since I have done everything. It’s the game that’s still horrendously broken and there’s nothing I can or they will do. 
---
Preposterous for a AAA game this far after release.
---
I will say this as someone who actually give it a college try:
---
The found-world stuff is on-par with the quality of found world stuff in Fallout 3, NV, and 4, which is to say pretty good. Interesting terminal entries and notes to find, interesting holotapes to listen to, a sad story to follow. 
---
Quantity, on the other hand is poor: about a quarter of what you get in Fallout 4. Good stuff, just not a lot of it and a lot of empty space in-between. 
---
The main quest is, frankly, boring. I mean, it's sorta interesting, but all the actually interesting stuff was done by other people, and you're just kinda.... finishing up what they started, all alone with a dozen other people doing the same thing, just at different points along the way. 
---
There's some decent acting and dialogue, but the overall conceit that everyone is dead makes for a boring story that you're listening to rather than an exciting story that your character is involved in. 
---
It's just.... meh. Some parts are good, some parts are bad.
---
As for gameplay, the actual shooter mechanics of the game are decent for a supposedly roleplaying multiplayer FPS. Not as good as some online shooters, but not bad. About as good as Fallout 4, but online. 
---
But the grind.....
---
fuck that grind. 
---
Fuck it really fucking hard with a pineapple. 
---
They make you grind everything. ***EVERY***thing. Recipes. Weapons. Armor. Legendaries. Food. Crafting materials. Other crafting materials. MORE crafting materials. 
---
And then they tell you how much you love it and you get bonehead fans defending it like it's the pinnacle of fun things to do. 
---
ugh
---
Why wouldn't it come out? Lol ?!?!?
---
serves you morons right.
---
It is also part of Game Pass on Xbox. Here is a tip, change your time zone to New Zealand and you can play it RIGHT now. I am, and it looks great so far. Oh well, back to TOW.

Everyone sit and pay attention.. the father of the internet gaming is here.. lol
---
Eh I'm just kicking back eating popcorn and reading.. I enjoy FO76.
---
I bought the base game and will continue to play the base game. The way I see it is, the sub is optional and is not needed. 
---
This is one wallet that will remain closed 👍
---
Eeh, but that's unlikely. First of all, the timing: it is near-to-impossible to set up something so big in as little as time-frame. Then, the DMCA itself. You can't bring down something that doesn't violate the copyright and intellectual property - and the website was clearly satirical
---
well yes i now why bethesda/zenimax did it :D im asking why players would want to subscribe
---
Hmm. Did not know this. That being said, it's another launcher I'll probably have to deal with, but I guess it's an okay hassle over going with Epic.
---
I'm gonna be real y'all, with all the negative news and press, I just assumed FO76 was just already a dead game.
---
It was surprising to see that they were adding a new subscription feature to it after this long.
---
 You know, I have a good story about this "game". Its a tale of misery and pain. During the hype of the launch, I ended up pre ordering the Collector's edition during the frenzy of the announcement. As it would take long to arrive to me (as I live in Brazil) I ended up buying a digital copy to play at release. I also convinced two friends to buy it at launch. One got a refund and the other did not and because of it he is still angry at me. I have an extra copy (the one with the metal case) that came with my CE and here comes my burden. I wouldn't dare to sell it at our ebay equivalent because that would be inhuman. Giving it away is also a sin. The metal case is kinda nice but thats like the necronomicon, seens interesting in the outside its a thing from hell in the inside.  
---
I should probably go to that desert at Chile and bury it deep in there and hope no one will awake that monstruosity.
---
If you have 9.99$/month i could arrange something friend
---
The fact they need someone to be online means they're doing peer-to-peer hosting, which doesn't require private server space.
---
Will I be charged later?
---
I said "You sure seem defensive about it"
---
Why can’t they be rival teams? 
---
Clearly Bethesda needs competition in the segment to bring them back to reality.
---
Cyberpunk 2077 pls.
---
Man If this story ends with the grandfather dying, I’m gonna cry
---
I made no assumption of maturity based on years spent breathing oxygen on this planet.
---
And so it goes.
---
Yeah I've noticed it with the helmets/gas masks in the atom shop don't give the negative to perception that the in game helmets/gas masks do, thanks for checking
---
No idea then. I haven’t had an issue doing it that way but maybe it’s random and I’ve just been lucky. From a programming standpoint if I had to guess I’d say it’s probably an issue with the private servers/instances correctly implementing the save.
---
You know what the worst part of this will be, Wastelanders will be still buggy on release. Bet $100 it will be.
---
&gt; Also it has the same lame glitchy coat animation it did back in F:NV...
---
Wat? F:NV didn't have cloth physic though and I've seen a video of the ranger armor in F76 and it behave exactly like any other type of coat in-game, with physic.
---
It's Bethesda, they do this everywhere, once they get a taste of ass-raping you, they just won't stop. The problem is, a limited amount of players is still going back to Daddy Bethesda.
---
* Mod support is planned for the future, but honestly I don't even care
---
* No players one-shot killing mobs in front of me preventing me from getting a chance to get a legendary
---
* No walking into an area with my &lt;50 character and not being able to explore/quest because &gt;50 already went through and set the mob spawn level
---
* No "Your CAMP cannot be placed" because someone else was there
---
* No one harrassing me while I farm Black Titanium from a workshop
---
* No one spamming me with group invites because they want to PVP with me
---
* No one following me around and being an otherwise asshole, forcing me to change servers
---
For things to actually work costs extra. You need to get yet another subscription on top of this one. Read the fine print.
---
I dont know. maybe the guy how made it and then wanted to make it seem like Bethesda did it. It would not be the first time someone has made something up just to bash 76
---
My thoughts exactly. I’m loving it too. Well worth a hundo, IMO.
---
They can be.
---
But a 'Whale' is just someone willing to fork out a lot of money over microtransactions.
---
Sorry can’t give my opinion unless paid $10 a month😂
---
Man, I don't feel bad for you at all.  You paid extra for this obvious cash grab on the back of a huge lie (only cosmetic purchases).  Man, spend your money on other things... Or throw it on the ground.  It's your fault bro.
---
One example of this I remember vividly was following the 2016 election.  A lot of rioters took to the streets here to protest Trump - actually vandalized quite a few stores and wrecked a few cars in the process.  The police arrested a few of them and one of the things they asked was simply, "Did you vote?"  Over 70% of them said they hadn't.
---
It's a good thing to keep in mind in a world where the noisiest people get showered with attention.
---
Okay, My Lord.
---
Its not a charity because  YOU ALREADY FUCKING PAID FOR IT...idiot
---
*Fallout First is the very definition of Failure*
---
So reality makes me defensive?? Ok you win chief😂😂😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
While the people with common sense stop buying games from these publishers, you will reap what you sow.
---
thanks for the insight 👍🏼
---
It’s just a good job it is only junk. It just the 100 flux I had for serums that hurts a little.
---
Maybe my view is just a bit different, i live with a neurological condition that i will never ever get rid off and for a long time that was bumming me the fuck out.
---
I thought why try anything when every where i look i only see stats of people with the same condition fucking up etc etc etc.
---
Then i realised that in order to not end up in the same situation i would just need work way harder.
---
Not a life i would choose but one i was given so i'm gonna make the most out of it even if it will be a lot harder then to most people
---
How do you server hop at all didn't think it was possible on private
---
More so than fallout 76.
---
Don't want to ruin your party but I literally did that same questline two days ago, I am currently at the Brotherhood of Steel section.
---
It also seems unlikely that the bug presented itself for everyone but me, so it's more like you are either the only one with it, or you are doing something wrong.
---
People that paid for this scam kinda deserve it really.
---
That's not what AAA means... 
---
 "AAA is an informal classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, typically having higher development and marketing budgets."
---
That's a trap, go back go back
---
Well the unlimited scrap cleared 500lbs out of my stash and now I don’t care what I pick up now. Scrap away. And sometimes I want to do stuff like build a camp or do an event or claim a workshop without some jack wagons bugging me or bang bang explosive one shot everything. Atoms are a great deal too but that’s if you buy them usually. I might have an OCD problem with those and needing new stuff. Trying it for a month and see how I feel.
---
Hey should add a list of the fo76 fails and issues prior to the stupid subscription
---
"I'm boycotting Bethesda...except for the games I like"
---
Lol, stay strong bro.
---
All I'm doing is telling. Much better than manipulating a massive horde of followers into shelling out hundreds of dollars for a half-baked product. As far as I'm aware, me asking someone to better spend their money is about the Pacific Ocean's width better than that.
---
Also, I made an effort not to shame the guy. Didn't even downvote his comment. We all make stupid investments, we all burn money some stupid way. All I'm asking is to burn it better in the future. That so bad?
---
Also, just because "people can do what they want" does not mean it's good to do it, for them, or for us. That money spent on this subscription goes straight into the wallets of the people fucking us over; not just him, not just me, and not just you, all of us who play these games. 
---
Call me a comedian, but we live in a society where the things we do effect others through the corporate middleman. It's unwise to pretend that isn't true. Each of our actions have consequences, and to say you have no such responsibility is an insult to all those around you and in your community, online or not.
---
That’s not 800 + pounds ands that’s one resource. So HUH!!!!???😂😂😂😂
---
Source? This would explain a lot of it’s true.
---
&lt;3
---
The crawl from 20 to 40 is rough. You have a lot more questline and areas to explore tbh.  I suggest finding a team mate and grind through enclave and brotherhood  quests, 
---
Get a hazmat suit and go to nuke zones where you can. Buy or acquire Marsupial so you can snipe from rooftops, because even if you can’t kill them you get the cap when higher leveled players do. 
---
I leveled to 40 at Whitesprings. Investing heavily in sneak and covert operative. It still took time but it was still fun.
---
AUS = Australia. AUD = Australian dollars. There are strong laws over here to protect consumers.
---
The line has been crossed during launch.
---
Still seem defensive.
---
👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈

That video is sickening. Bethesda is nothing but trashy, underhanded and money-grubbing. They deserve everything they're being hit with and more. They need to go down the aisles in corporate and throw each and every person out the window and bring in some competent people that actually cares about their customer because it's obvious that Todd Howard and his racketeer buddies need some schooling.
---
It depends if whether said weapons are actually skins (like that alien wand thing they did) or legitimate independent weapons with different stats.
---
Proof of day one purchase really? They have your account don't they... And it's not hard to reverse changes like that...
---
yfw Anthem is and always was a better game than Fallout 76.
---
Ew not protecting the company, just the players.
---
And every company does shady things, don't act like this is new.
---
That’s messed up sorry that happened to you. Wonder if Bethesda will address this.
---
I ran one the other day and it was smooth
---
You can not sever hop a private server
---
They're full of shit
---
Pay to lose.
---
Thanks for helping to make gaming worse for everyone else
---
Surely the online database would just store the item and its quantity like it always would have been but who knows, it's Bethesda so they probably couldn't figure it with their collective two brain cells.
---
That's all free to play cost mechanic s. Wareframe is also upfront about the costs. It's still designed for players to dump more money into it than the average $60 game.
---
I'm just explaining to you how easy it is to get these items. No high level player is going to have 800 stash free just for junk LMAO. We all have gear stocked away, you're literally making no sense. HUH!!!?? 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Yeah I’m reaping lots of fun with my friends.
---
It sounds like a great deal! I mean $100 a year for an experience that should’ve been in the game already?? Sign me up!!
---
Yep, I noticed my Stash Box performance was terrible. I took all my notes and stashed them somewhere. Same with my Holotapes. I kept only a few of them.
---
Whatever you did last week and the week before.
---
heh..there's a certain tax I should explain first..
---
I'm almost certain if I did buy Anthem, it wouldn't have had as many bugs, or crashes as Fallout 76. So not quite a good comparison.
---
I think the patch notes are just wrong in this respect.  The probably meant to say Stash space, because obviously, the following bullet points about weight have nothing to do with CAMP space.
---
Says the guy who was salty for the reality of refunds😂😂😂😂😂😂🖖🏾🖖🏾
---
yeah i mean i get it if you buy a lot of atom shop stuff anyways its definitely something to consider so if there wasnt any atom shop benefits from the subscription, do you think you would have subscribed anyways?
---
Reread your last reply dude lol I’m really concerned about you 😂😂😂 I’m in the twilight zone right now 😂😂😂
---
Literally, went into nuclear winter, was ear blasted by the robot dance music
---
It will be a sad day if we never get a true fallout "5".
---
You deserve to be griefed just based off this post lol
---
But why buy another half-baked game.
---
Now don’t get me wrong, Anthem can be fun, especially with friends, and I having a lot of fun.
---
Buut... yeah the critique of the game is mostly spot on, especially from ACG:)
---
Well yeah, and also 90% of wastelanders content wont be dlc.
---
Because apparently dlc means just that extra stuff to get you buying more skins.
---
&gt; And you can actually role play. 
---
What stops me role playing in FO76?
---
&gt; My problem is it lacks all the things that make fallout fallout. 
---
What things would those be, then?
---
I'd love to see this become a thing.
---
Well, the site is pretty direct and hostile already in this state..I mean..adding a list of their actions can't make things worse right? It's their fault, they should be ashamed for their horrible work.
---
Thanks dude! It had to happen!
---
Dont bother. Too many triggered fanboys here.
---
Getting it with my xbox game pass. 
---
Bethesda can sux my balls
---
Check [this](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjwbx8/the-outer-worlds-isnt-revolutionary-its-a-warm-blanket) out. It’s as close to F:NV as you’re going to get, and it might make you feel better.
---
Ah I missed you wrote AUD, my bad. Long day.
---
It’s a well documented bug online in forums. There is no fix for it. Only create a new character and hope whatever causes the terminal not to process your progress isn’t triggered in that play. 
---
Either you got lucky or I got unlucky, but regardless it’s still ridiculous this game breaking problem isn’t fixed.
---
Check out my blog.. www.canadiangirlsareeasy.com
---
Well you know what. You win. Go get your refund. Let me know what Bethesda says😂😂😂😂😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
I didn't buy it, and I'm not going to. Just saying I think it wouldn't have been so frustrating with bugs and crashing as Fallout 76.
---
I bet there will be a response on this thread but no other.
---
It can’t be “instantly yoinked”.
---
I should have added that I was being sarcastic.
---
But seriously.......if Boeing was trusting our lives in the hands of $10 an hour developers to program flight controls in passenger planes..... surely videogame corporations are seeking to cut their bottom dollar buy hiring $10 hour developers.
---
Lmao no, they proved that years ago. It amazes me that you're *still* gonna buy it. The brainwashing is strong with this one.
---
Well, I loved the franchise. Hell, I even found Fallout 4 to be okay and played it a lot. But Fallout 76 was from the get-go a mess and only got worse. :(
---
I don't care how you try a justify it, you completely deserve this.
---
thank you good sir
---
????? Yes, no high level player is going to have 0/800 in their stash specifically for junk. Because item management WAS a thing. I don't understand why are you concerned? You do understand English, right? LMFAO
---
Wouldn’t doubt it, lol
---
ES6. One shall don a pirates hat.
---
Even Hitler had useful idiots that claimed what he was doing was no big deal.
---
LOL, "we keep the servers running", do you realize how condescending you sound, like you're doing humanity a favour by supporting this shit? So disgusting tbh!
---
Yes, millions!!
---
Honestly don’t know yet. The scrapping thing is definitely a game changer.  But will just lead to me hoarding more shit and stuck paying for the storage which I’m sure Bethesda is hoping for lol. Just depends if these bonus things are important to you.
---
Is it? I mean Fall out seems very dull gameplay-wise, but I think that is more a individual perspective.
---
Heard it got more content than Anthem though.
---
Athen is a average game at best, and unfortunately unfinished, only got a skeleton crew to fix it, Fall out seems like it got full dev support.
---
Still enjoy Anthem though.
---
Well the items it collected were so easy to get on your own and it didn't really matter, right? It wasn't significant enough in the first place to give any kind of real advantage, right?
---
Ya because Obsidian games have no bugs, lol lol
---
You will end up fast travelling for everything.
---
I'm gonna hire bodyguards to escort me around now..
---
but those are also getting far more than this in the current basegame of ESO already
---
Still winning boy
---
It's good now.
---
If you pay for one month and cancel your subscription, you get to keep the atoms, the outfit and the emotes, which basically translate into a glorified atom bundle like the ones we've gotten this summer. The pricing is also quite close, 17.99$ CAN for one month of F1st vs. 14-15$ (typical pricing of a bundle). By itself and with the cosmetics it offers, I guess it has an interesting value which is why many people went ahead.
---
That said, purchasing the thing *now* or any atoms would mean encouraging Bethesda's decision and direction. Had they released F1st with Wasterlanders things would be entirely different... Yet here we are.
---
I think we might get them considering the hellfire (x-03) skin is in NW, just don't expect them in the normal atom shop, they'll be behind the fallout 1st subscription pay wall
---
How?  Does it have *any* mention of Fallout lore?  Is the world even vaguely similar?
---
Be 1st to get your junk removed😉
---
Well i haven't played since the fridge came out. I'am truly sad as i bought 2 copies of the game and i'am a Fallout fan. Fortunately the shitshow the are pulling of since months is quite more entertaining then the game itself.
---
Where else would you ask for a refund?
---
Outerworlds
---
They fucking did it holy shit this is the most fun Ive ever had with a game I did not even play
---
I saw two WS ghouls kill each other last night on my instance. It was weird, and explains why every time I've ever been to WS that one ghoul in the bathroom is always dead.
---
Same, if that
---
The hellfires in 76 but its like lvl fucking 100 in nw only toxic pvp mongers wear it
---
&gt; You tried to cheat the system xD
---
Not really, it's written on their website/FAQ you get to keep the items in case of a cancellation.
---
Unbunch your tighty whiteys dude, I was just amused by the way you worded it. Don't take life so seriously.
---
Good to know. I'll have a few questions. Like what the hell were they thinking....
---
The first Prototype of the X-03 was completed in 2080, roughly halfway through the year. After all, we do have the X-01 which is 'prototype'.
---
Sure, but Outer Worlds is supposedly solid as far as bugs go.
---
I agree. Extra storage space would be a fantastic game changer for me. I really like running a cheap junk store, so I'm frequently max stash and overencumbered as a result. This can limit my game as I am often too heavy to travel to (or back from) events like SBQ and One Violent Night. I love giving bargains to Wastelanders but as a result of the inadequate stash allocaton, resource and perk juggling takes up a lot of my time, which isn't fun. But on principle, even though I can afford to, I refuse to pay for what should be a basic and equal game feature for all. Saying "you don't have to buy a subscription" is missing the point. It is just not right that those with little to no disposable income will have zero means to acquire a basic game feature like an appropriate amount of storage. It is not pay to win, but it is definitely pay to improve your basic quality of life.
---
That’s not robbery. You don’t know what robbery means. It’s all optional. No one “falling” into anything, they are freely making their own choices just like any other subscription service.
---
Emojis as a response? Not much of a response is it.
---
Where did it say that
---
The service that they promised wouldn't ever be a part of the game.
---
This guy is getting it for $1
---
Yeah no... Blowing hundreds or thousands of dollars on microtransactions for a single game is not "good money management skills"
---
There's something new in the news every bloody day about people going broke on lootboxes, and I personally knew a guy who spent almost his entire bank account on LoL skins. His mother had to take control of his finances, he was 20!!!
---
So once again you made my point lol. It’s a convenience not an advantage lol 😂😂😂😂
---
What?
---
Do you think that criticisms shouldn’t be allowed here?
---
How old are you again?
---
Its isn't even out yet. Wait till the community gets ahold of it.
---
I’ll say this from experience in the industry; I know they’ve been working on the screw up they made importing item values from fo4, which were single player based and thus all the same thing. There was no way wastelanders was going to work unless they fixed this along with upgrading server capability. It’s reasonable to believe they’ve implemented the item value fix with this patch for scrap. Furthermore with the private instance implementation you’re spreading strain out more by breaking up the player base. I’m not saying you’re wrong, we just don’t know what they’ve done and what they haven’t. I wouldn’t be shocked though if some of the item value code wasn’t fixed and the servers upgraded in this patch to make way for wastelanders. Time will tell.
---
just because your PA leaks oil everywhere you go is no reason to be mean.
---
JW what games do anti F76 players play?
---
I definitely have seen way less fanboys defending 1st
---
They’re different games though? 
---
I, personally, play multiple games so I’ve never understood this “There can be only one!” mentality.
---
😐.....😂😂😂😂😂
---
 ERR\_NAME\_NOT\_RESOLVED 
---
Too bad I would have supported spotlighting it in the next Around Appalachia
---
yeah well thats the point i see all the benefits but for me personally they seem to be just minor conveniences and thats why i asked players my question :D i was afraid i could be missing a big advantage or something
---
You know what, I wouldn't condone piracy necessarily, but if they're trying to scam people, I say go for it, dude.
---
\#FirePeteHinesFromBethesda
---
This is a fallout 76 sub, not r/theouterworlds
---
Here is the archive if anyone wants to see what it is. https://web.archive.org/web/20191024025803/http://falloutfirst.com/
---
Actual guns apparently that you can now buy and abilities than again you can buy that's where I draw the line imo there will be skins but my main big gripe now is the fact they will be adding weapons and abilities to the atomic shop
---
I'd like to believe the folks watching the various youtubers etc and those complaining do. And I know some will, but even if 1 million walked out, it means little. The people complaining are the ones that been complaining since day 1. 
---
They could all walk now and nothing would change. Because in reality there are more people that don't care or just want to play etc. 
---
Had someone bring up Yong Yea etc, their failing to understand the majority of his viewers etc, don't play as is and follow him for other stuff. So his numbers are not a value that has any weight.
---
Same with other youtubers etc... this game will go on regardless. Because the sub isn't drastic like the progression system in Battlefront II was.
---
It's not because of the sub service. Sub for some free cosmetics, deals and atoms? Absolutely fine. Love the idea tbh. 
---
A sub that adds P2W, ideas this sub suggested, is where people are getting shitty.
---
Our group had a similar experience.  :)  It actually felt like a different game.
---
Little lies stunning shows
---
haven't played it since the fridge. No more intressted in any Bethesda games.
---
ITT: People discovering Pete Hines is just another paid drone that doesn't care about them.
---
Hmm this is the same sub that bitched when i called 76 an mmo
---
Yes, having an infinite amount of storage for important in game items that is locked behind a pay wall is just convenience and not an advantage. 🤡🤡
---
I'm L146, mostly solo and I walk everywhere.  Always have.  Lower levels, I didn't have the caps; now I have the caps, but I'm generally overencumbered, and can't FT
---
That aside, a few of the benefits of walking are 
---
1. You discover more (there are a lot of unmarked places, shrines, what is that and why is it here type things, 2.
---
2. Have more opportunities to gain XP (more encounters)
---
3. you get to appreciate and enjoy the graphics and ambient sound
---
Being able to FT does have its good points - when an event you wnt to do pops on the other side of the map from where you are, its easy to get to.  
---
  There are a couple of missions which consecutive steps take you to opposite ends of the map.  You have to decide if its worth the caps to FT, or if benefit 2 above applies.
---
  If you haven't started farming nuke zones, you can always FT when one goes off.  OTOH, it only takes 5-7 min to walk from Top of the world to any of the common nuke areas except fissure prime, so you dont miss out if you walk. (nuke zones last at least an hour).
---
You should be roamin in the ash heap area; critters there have more XP than the Forest critters.
---
@28 with a decent weapon, you also may be able to do WS non-nuked.  Won't be easy, but it is doable. (I did my first WS run at L27)  The higher level enemies there give lots more XP than the critters in the forest/ash heap.
---
I'm good with bugs.
---
As long as they don't have duping and pay to win micro transactions.
---
I'm not a hater but the big picture is not that they're fixing flaws due to an early release. The big picture is paying $13  for convinience that should be there for all to enjoy. If the game had a ton of content added like ESO, I would have no problem with this model, but unless one cares to start a new character the game has zero new content before Wastelanders.
---
Ah yes, that ol Reddit chestnut.
---
Its worse than anthem. At least anthem had enough respect to let the shit game die
---
It actually may be true, apparently scrap stash boxes are bugged and scraps being deleted. I can't conform this yet until I get on tonight but if its true then that limitation may very well have been real,
---
True but ESO was also in a pretty miserable state once upon a time.
---
True, both games follows a sad trend on the tripple A gaming market.
---
But I bought Anthem knowing this, but also hoping for it to do a Destiny 2, for honor, rainbow six seige, Division 1 and so on.
---
Foolish in retroperspective, but still having fun in the game, just do not believe that it will pull itself up over average :)
---
Are you waiting for me to not reply? Should i upvote your comments
---
They didn't explain it right is the problem and honestly this stupid scrap box should just be free. The rest of the crap on the 1st I don't see a big deal with.
---
Agreed, had an amazing time last night playing with my group on a private world. Everything was so smooth and responsive, hell think I might even do the 94 raid soon!
---
I don't know any more than you know about Wastelanders.  You are rabble-rousing.. nothing more.
---
ARK and DayZ are good examples too. And ArmA.
---
It seems to disappear after a certain amount of time - I'm not sure on how long but leaving and rejoining half an hour later gave me a new world. I knew this as my munitions workshop had totally reset.
---
Okay chill homie, I’m a f2p person as it is. Simply providing an option for a community to stand up for itself but if you’d rather feed the system that’s fine too.
---
See I started off on private while I changed my camp, went to public and it was ok but when I went back to private it was gone.
---
I did Encryptid twice last night, and I had people posing next to me taking pics in photomode at least 3 times while I wore my Ranger armor. I saw a few others with it too last night while checking out vendors.
---
I'm sure this will be like the scrap bot. Outrage Bois online gonna rage, while everyone else pays up.
---
I just want this emote to point and laugh at camp owners selling a Suppressor's limb damage power attack baton for 25k in vending.
---
Real talk: who really doubted you five years ago when you said mobile gaming would become the gold standard for all gaming?
---
Companies have been studying newer ways to monitize their games for decades. When Bethesda dropped the “Horse Armor DLC” ~10 years ago everyone laughed, but no one should have been surprised.
---
The reality is that companies do this because it works. There is not going to be a gamer revolution wherein principled resistance is going to restore a norm from twenty years ago. This is part of a broader cycle in media where escalating development costs and diminishing attention spans are requiring new thinking. Unfortunately, not all of that thinking will be consumer friendly.
---
The way I retain my personal sanity in this world is to look at the opportunity cost of my decisions, and ask myself “is this the best use of my money and time?”
---
I have played close to 500 hours of FO76. Even with purchasing the collectors edition, that’s less than one dollar per hour of entertainment. Yes, I could have waited to buy it on sale, and really driven that per-hour return down, but I consider the money effectively well spent.
---
Now, I look at $12, and ask myself if I will derive at least $1/hour entertainment from this purchase, and the answer is probably yes. Ergo, I will likely buy the subscription. If nothing else, my wife finds the Mothman emote hilarious to watch, so it’s well worth $12 just to make her laugh a few times.
---
End of the day, you’re not going to win the war against rampant capitalism. All you can do is be a principled consumer, and find your personal limit.
---
Too late, the kids already got their mom's CC and the whales accept everything that you throw at them.
---
&gt;r/FO76: The collectron is play to win!
---
&gt;Beth: Ok, we'll turn down the scrap a bit so he's not so much play to win.
---
&gt;r/FO76: You've nerfed our collectron! Outrage!
---
That's super disingenuous. There's a pretty big difference between a light nerf when conceding the point that a cash shop item is pay to win, and heavily stealth nerfing it months later when everyone forgot about the controversy. This may come as a surprise to you, but you can be upset about both the addition of the bot in the first place, and its heavy handed stealth nerfing without it being hypocritical.
---
And they'll throw in a skin you don't want and some atoms you don't need.
---
Our team of 4 went to raid last night and i can tell you this. The pace, response of terminals, doors, pipes you have to fix, enemies etc. Its amazing. Its really fast, no crash at all, loading times are reduced by 50% , imho the game on a private server is like they wanted/supposed to be in the first place.
---
He is speculating what mods will be. Zero evidence for his claim. And those mods will be limited to private worlds.... so who really cares?
---
how is the server stability in private worlds? im hoping they never crash?
---
That makes sense. Didnt really think about it like that. Seems kind of messed up though. Lol. Are they trying to divide their player base even more?
---
 Can you test if this bug is repeatable and if you lose junk even if you log straight into a private world? Try putting a few pieces of junk in the container and logging out and right into a private server then do it again for private to adventure. I am at work and haven't logged back in yet. So I can't test it out yet.
---
Thats what I did.  So seems like were in the same boat.
---
Glad bethesda has fans like you.
---
Their next game wont even have have quest rewards as those are not the main game so you will need to buy them.
---
Almost everything they have released post launch was scrapped from the main game and sold to players later.
---
They even included the scrap bots and everything in the official quide book.
---
They just took free features out of the game and made people pay extra money for them.
---
The company that made the game and is changing it...
---
loool
---
Now that I have kids, I have bought two games in the past two year. RDR2 and FO76. But I'll be buying outer world's soon so hey that's almost one a year! Things are looking up!
---
What else did you expect? Creation club got it's start ripping off Nexus. Horse armor became a meme for shitty content. That's not tinfoil at all.
---
Of course they're going to monetize it, because that's what they always do. It's hard to tell if they thought about repercussions or if DGAF is just how it is there.
---
How can I insta yoink Google?
---
I sell googely eyes and they are infiringing on my IP.
---
oh, this is so great!!! Unbelievable how funny this is at the current point....
---
You don't need to have a degree in CS to understand that relational database storage on a server needs more processing than storing it in a local text file.
---
Yah i just finished watching it was pretty entertaining
---
Haha Bethesda releases a subscription and one of its selling points is bugged.
---
You called it
---
No it does work... The gentleman below, while perhaps a massive dick, was correct. 
---
If you remove the Bobbleheads and magazines from their displays, then scrap the displays, then build new displays and then replace the Bobbleheads and Magazines, it does in fact decrease the utilized CAMP budget by a very small amount.
---
Imagine being like this over a fucking video game.
---
Dude, enjoy those fusion cores and ammo factory! When the NPCs get here I'm totally playing fallout 4 style!!!
---
Tell ur buddies to get over themselves for one day. This moral high ground garbage is ludicrous. If nothing else you have a 1650 atom/outfit bundle for $12 and a free trial to the rest.
---
If they want it to have an eso+ system, they should have put in the eso+ work. 
---
Eso had way more updates and fixes and goodwill earned with their free to play announcement.
---
F076 delayed a major update before pulling this.
---
Congrats on killing the game for me beth!
---
What gives you the right to question my honesty?! The only attention seeker here is you. Lying to get on t.v.? Jeeez....grow the fuck up! This ain't the 90s. Now do one little boy. I genuinely lost items. And idgaf whether you believe me or not. You do not matter. End off.
---
Bethesda
---
Yeah I'm getting it. If anything, at least you get a complete and working game for 50 dollars.
---
I've been on one for 3 hours with nil crashes or any issues. it looks like you go back into the same server.
---
The world definitely feels different, so quiet with nil explosions at Whitesprings or gunfire in the background all the time. It actually takes some getting used to. Weird I didn't think it would change anything.
---
Just on another note - I tested magazine spawns as I was expecting that you may get one in every location as no other player has nabbed them. In a Watoga run I only got one magazine, so although its only early I think they have made items that you could farm in the world more scarce so you can't use the server to get an advantage in anything but junk.
---
It’s more a private instance than a private server and my guess is they are in part using this to test their instancing tech for wastelanders.
---
The name did strike me as odd, but I haven't put much thought into why.
---
But you may be right with your suggestion that they get to play new content first.  Actually I think that would've gone over better than what they did.  It's not unheard of to give subscribers early access to new features/content.  The way they did it, non-subscribers NEVER get the new stash box or the new fast travel tent.  I think that has people's vaginas sandier than most aspects of the subscription.
---
well jeez...if everyone is wearing it then I don't want to anymore :(
---
..back to my Mistress of Mystery dress.
---
Well i appreciate your input. Im just trying to get ahead of this before it becomes a problem.
---
&gt;before you hate on me for paying
---
Don't worry, I don't hate you, but I sure as hell am laughing at you for making such a poor decision. Hope you get your stuff back but F76 is truly the gift that keeps on giving.
---
honestly. subscribing to this thing is so wrong. I don't honestly understand how you people are doing it. They sell a broken game that people pay money for. Then they sell the fixes to said broken game in a 100$ a year subscription package. And people still pay for it. AND NOW THOSE FIXES ARE BUGGED! The problem is, Bethesda doesnt look like idiots. Us gamers do! Because we keep letting it happen.
---
More like frustration. 8 out of 10 posts are all crying about the same thing today.
---
I’m sure they’ll sort it pretty quick. They’re getting so much grief about the subscription, they can’t afford for things to go wrong.
---
Mods aren't supported for Private servers as the progress you make in Private can be transferred to Public so
---
Already with you 🙃
---
Dont believe I said that at all, all I said was the game got beat up by the media, it deserved it sure, but I never blamed the media for the games faults.
---
I wonder if switching back n forth from private to adventure or vise versa is the problem. I haven’t gone into private and still have all my scrap accounted for.
---
Not gonna lie I used those atoms right away for some camp skins
---
Why create a new server for the customer when you can just re-provision unused server capacity lol
---
yeah but THEY went around and fixed the game though I don't see this future or the desire from Bethesda to do this with this 'sideproject'
---
You're happy because something bad happened?  Yep, we're on Reddit.
---
They will reply in the next few days to small stuff not related to the subscription service.  Or to Fanboy type posts.
---
I played plenty of Fallout 76 and had plenty of bugs and crashing. And a relatively popular FO76 streamer moved onto Anthem as soon as it released, and I watched the stream a few times. So that is how I can draw the comparison. And when you played Fallout 76 as much as me, which is hundreds of hours in the first few months, I know there is nothing as bad as that. And after coming back a week or so ago and only playing for a few hours here an there I have already had multiple crashes, a year after release, which is frankly unacceptable. And I have never known EA to release a game in that state, and that is one good thing I can say about them.
---
Agreed, I just i hope i get my 400+ scrap back.  I had over 500 balistic fiber that I want back.
---
Thanks for the information. Guess I'm suck in a private works until they confirmed this is fixed
---
I mean I don’t really care what they do as long as they don’t go back on their word.
---
i’ve spent A LOT of $ on this game. and i’m board of it. but if wastlanders is good i’ll subscribe.
---
As I understand it fair use is more of legal defense than it is a law, meaning Bethesda could absolutely sue and the site owner could try and use fair use as a defense tactic.
---
You suck bethesda
---
Haha. It’s not that funny but yeah it doesn’t make them look good.
---
ha! the Reddit sub is more entertaining than the game now. :)
---
It's eerily smooth.  Like, feels-like-a-different-game smooth.
---
Didn't have any crashes on a full house last night, but the owner of the server did crash and was able to rejoin it in some fashion.  I'm not entirely clear on how that works, other than it apparently does.  People join the server through the owner.  As long as one 1st member is around, the server stays up, but I can't find any place that explains how or when ownership is transferred.
---
dreams are 12.99 extra
---
Yes, that is going to be the reality too. Exclusive access to all of the goods and resources on a server will undoubtedly mess up the Adventure economy. I am expecting the price of lots of things to go down because there will be many more items on the market. This will, again, make the game that little less enjoyable for those without that paid for advantage.
---
Can you imagine if  F1 gave us slightly less effective stimpacks...but hey you can craft/collect/buy normal ones with caps yourself and they are way better!  My point is the mechanics of the subscriptions are identical and the arguments about the line between P2W and utility can be made in both games.
---
Literally the only difference between them is that ESO is a full blown MMO that’s not totally broken. 
---
This subscription screams ESO+ clone
---
Happy cake day
---
Sensible people capable of critical thinking. Thats refreshing.
---
Guess it depends on your definition of what makes it fallout. If it’s just the name and lore then sure. In that case metal gear survive is a metal gear solid game. Resident evil 6 is a resident evil game. Halo wars is a halo game. IMO however fallout 76 is a spin off. And just because it had the name and environment doesn’t make it fallout because it lacks the character depth. Choices. Multiple quest outcomes. Endings. Companions. And dialog options that makes the fallout games great. Again imo.
---
Thank God FO4 is a fun game. Granted, it only really retains itself with mods, but it's been one of my favorite games of all time - and I prefer older titles, nothing new that comes out. Best thing Bethesda can do for Fallout right now is just leave it alone. They aren't going to learn their lesson until they see a massive drop in sales for their bigger upcoming titles such as Elder Scrolls VI. Let's not lie to ourselves. They're going to do the same thing with it that they did with Fallout, but hopefully it will be enough for them to realize that we aren't their mindless, money-farming cattle. They had the nerve to say that this 1st membership is something us players wanted. How delusional can one get? Once reality slaps (I prefer that it punches) them in the face, maybe then they can get to work redeeming themselves.
---
I don't understand why people defend this game. They are charging for things originally promised to be free. It really is ludacris, but I guess there are those die hard fan boys.
---
Cant say I blame them for being silent, I doubt you guys would be happy with anything they could say. Gotta remember that they're still people. 
---
When they do eventually respond please be respectful and understand that they're just the messengers
---
"wrong to like it"?
---
You act like most of us have more than 1 person on our friends list :(
---
And that their focus is NOT the gamers, our overall gaming experience, or the quality of their game. Losers.
---
I actually cant believe they had the balls to do this. After the colossal f up that was F76. The players that have stood by this game for so long believing it would get better are rewarded with having the features and improvements they want held to ransom. You can have the things you want but it'll cost you £12 per month..... 12POUNDS!!!! I get some people will say "well if you dont like it dont buy it" but jesus christ your just enabling these scumbags to get away with it.
---
If you have your heart set on buying it I'd definitely wait, see if Wastelanders actually happens and if it's any good. Very good chance the pricing or what's included will change.
---
You... can't buy craftable repair kits from the Atom store, though?
---
Good on you for deciding what you want to spend your own money on, though. Crazy how personal choice, autonomy, and subjective value works.
---
I'm signing up for game pass on PC today's for it. First month is only $1 on PC and I think $5 on Xbox. So if you are on either of those systems definitely go that route.
---
Are you saying that despite being difficult to pull off, they're giving it a try ?
---
Ask for refund. You all. Really.
---
My server crashed hard yesterday . it only happened once and it had been a while since I've had a crash in general. It did get a bit laggy at times but It was nice doing events with my buddy and nobody to bother us.
---
Bye
---
These shenanighans aside bethesda has quite a history of frivilous lawsuits theyve been a terrible company for quite a while
---
lmao, redditor got what he deserved. No sympathy for you.
---
i was wondering if when you leave your private server, and then go back to main menu, hit "private server" again, will it create a new world or it remembers your old server?  like if you build in a workshop, you are saying you cant server hop private servers, so everything you build a in a workshop stays there forever?
---
Umm... why not just copy and paste it here? You want the page views that badly or do you want people to actually read your perspective?
---
P2w? Cool where is the prize list? I don’t remember seeing that in the notes...
---
they should atleast not steal our ideas and sell them back to us, they should atleast not lock shit like infinite junk and camp budget increase behind a fucking pay wall. Why are we paying for camp budget.
---
mostly to do with storing high value items like Flux for sale as well as the volumes of components needed to make ammo.
---
😂 I have like 10 actual friends, but then no end of people I often trade with by coincidence.
---
And I've noticed a few cheekily joining my "private world"
---
oh my am I glad you are spreading wisdom throughout this wasteland feller. what an intellectual!
---
I bet it’s still there just a bug where it’s not showing.  I had 100 flux and quite a bit of ballistic fibre too.
---
People are salty because Bethesda is charging for things originally promised before the release of the game, and free, mind you.
---
I know I am, fo76 is just one rollercoaster ride that never ends.
---
they didnt launch anything.
---
These new "Private" servers are just regular servers with a lock to your friendlist.
---
Thanks, will document and submit.
---
Yeah, In the wastelanders trailer, you can see someone in a new set of power armour. (Obviously not X-03) But for the future to come, we could see the release of X-02 or X-03.
---
Gratz on that. Myself found Random bunch of 1-2 stars in vendor just two weeks ago.
---
People are quitting and dumpling stuff I quess.
---
BASED.
---
I think it meaning is not ambiguous at all. They need revenue to continue supporting this game. They don't want to pull the plug (yet) which means they still have plenty of ideas (or tricks) up their sleeves.
---
In my eyes the name Fallout 1st is synonymous with a premium subscription. Kind of like VIP tier on a porn site. They are going to keep pumping more and more content into it to transition this to a subscription based game simply because they need to continue making money in order to continue spending money developing and hosting. Requests made by subscribers are going to be heard before requests made from the free tier. These are not advanced economic concepts here.
---
People complain about micro transactions, hell I complain about micro transactions.....the alternative is subscription. Free (as in beer) is NEVER going to work for an MMO. Like it or not, this game is an MMO. You have to have continuous cash flow because expenses do not end until the plug is pulled. 
---
Maybe this causes a mass exodus and they game dies. Maybe not. We as consumers have to decide if we as individuals enjoy the game or not. Stop being hopeful that some day it will be something enjoyable. You are never going to get a monetary return on what you put in (unless you are an ebay duper). 
---
I enjoy this game, I love to play it. That's all there is to it for me.
---
First one to get fucked
---
Who cares what people do with their money wtf lol and I don't even have a private server
---
no, all of my shit is gonna rot and die along with this game and no one will be able to enjoy it
---
Just like the Collectron and/or the fridge.
---
You maybe have to pay.
---
completely innocent were you?
---
Yes I did. Now clean my boots, peasant, I'm going to a gala tonight at the whitesprings.
---
1) no
---
2) not sure
---
3) no
---
4) no
---
5) good
---
im not a modder but paying 13$ knowing some money gets to modders for there great work would have made them money and praise in my opinion. most fallout 4 mods are much better then the base game stuff.
---
They may be trying or its entirely coded differently and is being implemented differently. I'm unsure but the issues being reported with the scrap box leads me to believe that they are trying something different and its having issues they may have avoided by putting a stash limit to begin with.
---
The Reddit hug of death.
---
Problem is that most news outlets actually started off saying it was that helmet and couldn't check what it actually was
---
You’re really going to stick around to find out?
---
Yikes
---
I would be in hiding too.
---
What I meant by plans, is ones from taking workshops &amp; the reoccurring defending them.
---
nah fam i uninstalled that shit hella long ago, im just watching and laughing wondering if they'll put the fire out
---
That’s how I realised, when I went to cook something. I have faith we’ll get it back.
---
Too bad F4 was garbage as well
---
u/Aten_Ra you met the devs months ago....what's your personal rating on all this new fuckups? Devs' fault or upper management?
---
What are you even going on about? They didn't say that the media coverage wasn't justified. Context makes it seem that they wanted to see the game fixed and be able to recover from the bad start it initially had, not that the media caused all of these issues by covering the story.
---
A friend told me about it and I watched the video afterwards it's mainly speculation but it seems like this will be added in even Bethesda themselves have released it either on Twitter or their website saying this is what will be added in the future updates
---
Yeah well, it always like this for me and there's not much going on, even in Vault 76 in the very beggining when there was no one around I was lagging :/ But thanks anyway !
---
I'm guessing perk loadout will be a 1st exclusivity. P2W.
---
good read..
---
but in the end it's no longer about the fan, but making more money for the parent company shareholders.
---
and only time will tell if they got their algorithms right.
---
unfortunately, social media outrage doesn't equal profitability.
---
You are trippin
---
That’s literally the only difference between the subscriptions 😂
---
When they said all content, minus cosmetics, were gonna be free to all purchasers of fallout 76. All content. This falls under that category. Tons of articles dating back to before the launch. Todd Howard even said it himself before launch.
---
The amount of tears and memes this game has produced.. it's incredible.
---
Gaming was objectively better when it was still a geek hobby. It all turned to shit once the money started pouring in and it became mainstream.
---
what if they had released modding support with it and half the money went to the modders ?
---
It's not that $13 is a lot of money (though it is for some), but it's that it will split the community into haves and have-nots. Very few people will stick around as second-class citizens. That sort of treatment usually precludes a group of friends from playing together.
---
I'm off to a gala of another game released by a company that is not hell bent to abuse its most royal customers! :)
---
when did bethesda say private servers would be free
---
Hell yeah, you on Xbox?
---
Look at his interviews. Pete Hines has stated that all new content, dlc, and post launch stuff will be free and the game won’t become a cash grab. I think most people consider this to be in those categories.
---
I’ve just logged off but I will check. Ha I’ve got nothing to lose.
---
Prisoner's log #386:  Entering 13th month of Nuka Girl outfit being glitched and unwearable.  I complain but nobody listens.  Perhaps mythical fix is hidden behind new subscription paywall.  Will never know because going into salt mining business.  And business is good.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Imagine you play 4 chars an every couple day you have friends helping to mule the junk to your mule... fml
---
Ok, I absolutely see your point. I actually would not have to spend any money right now on new games as I still have about 30 limited editions games still in the original wrapping, as I really have limited time but I really enjoy this game in particular because I actually play with my son and the little time I have to enjoy with him is priceless. So I'm really looking at this from far more than just an enjoying the game aspect.
---
I'm honestly super worried for Starfield and ES6. You know they're going to be monetized. They'll probably add creation club to ES6 for sure, which I wish wasn't the case but it'll happen sadly.
---
I fear for my life when I return to public dressed in my 1% outfit. Too bad I’m a pacifist and will robot dance in your face.
---
The sad thing is, it’s what people always wanted. But they are asking another 120 to make it happen. They basically took the wish list of the loyal community and charged for it.
---
Also playing it now in Canada. Its fucking awesome.
---
I doubt that, since they provide a secluded place for a method not related to lagging. I think the lag was a byproduct from duping. But I don't know really.
---
Dude come on, stop acting like a child that isn’t getting exactly what he wants.
---
If the outrage is as real as it seems, more than Bethesda.
---
Who said anything about teaching anyone a lesson? I'm just spending money for my own entertainment. You do whatever you want fam.
---
I spent $12 not buying a full year till I see that it’s truly worth it. I’m not defending the error, it’s inexcusable and it needs to fixed ASAP. I’m just trying to help my fellow players find a work around so people don’t lose their stuff. Has nothing to do with excusing studio’s screw up.
---
Glad you can have I discussion... even if you think what I'm saying is an opinion, if you can say I'm mistaken you should do it with reasons, not just saying "nope, you're wrong, bye"
---
Lololol
---
Most 'HA HA' thing I've experienced in a game so far. They only lasted one week. HA HA.
---
I wouldnt have a problem with any of that if the game was free to play, but its not, so...Bethesda is really just looking to squeeze as much money from as suckers as possible
---
"Man do these rpg:s suck.. Like there are choises and shit, ima just go and play my new favorite rpg call of duty"
---
"Wow you don't need to do anything but press the mouse button to shoot, this is the best rpg out there"
---
The old games were good because they had dept, something that 4 and 76 have quite the lack of
---
I know, right?  My Social tab has about seven friends in it, and at most I'll see one at a time online.  Some of them I haven't seen playing Fallout in months.
---
Except you can buy coins to get all those guns first hence P2W.
---
What is this Player vs Player you speak of?
---
You are an idiot, and an annoying one at that.
---
So you mean p2w, but only in N W mode. Got it.
---
There are no mods yet and speculating about what people will be using is pointless because these aren't privately hosted instances so the modding scene won't be the same.
---
But whatever helps you doomsay and keeps you from buying 1st, I guess.
---
the only ones available right now are "pile of guts" and "gravestone", so they are geared more towards death drop bags. probably cuz halloween is next week.
---
Exactly!

A full priced game going P2W.  Many people only bought the game because of the false promises of 'only cosmetics', 'all future content will be free', etc.  If you don't mind P2W games that's your business, but plenty of people don't like the model of 'Do chores for an hour when you want to play or pay us $13/month to not do chores for an hour'.  This is a bait and switch for many people who purchased the game.
---
The devs are getting massively fucked over from the corporate side of things too. I don’t see how Bethesda can actually change course. They can keep pushing out games, but the corporate side is going to get more and more desperate and controlling as sales backslide in general, but feel proven right when a game does manage to breakthrough.
---
You lose your junk... Just like the player who paid for it.
---
So we should blame idiots, too? Is that what your saying?
---
Because giving Bethesda money for this shitty product to attract griefers (because this shit game doesn’t have enough players left for PvP), is just flat out dumb.
---
It’s your money though, enjoy wasting it on that piece of shit lol
---
Getting power armor right away was pretty lame. It always felt like that sequence was designed as a game conference demo to showcase the new power armor and let you fight a tough enemy in short order. Not really sure why that felt like the best approach to them, but I intentionally avoided power armor for a long time after that so it could feel more organic encountering and starting to use it further into the storyline.
---
Agreed. If this was the only benefit from it, it would have been more widely accepted. And everyone should have access to the scrap boxes as well. Its just something everyone has wanted since release, and putting it behind a pay wall is disgusting
---
There are more of us than you the only thing is the majority of us aren’t posting like small children.
---
This doesn't even make sense. You're paying Bethesda hundreds of dollars because you're mad at them for removing dedicated PvP. What kind of mental gymnastics do you have to do internally to justify that?
---
it's fascinating how the social media community has become such an integral part of a game's life.
---
Solution is everyone should boycott all Bethesda games. And everyone should be urging everyone they know to boycott Bethesda.
---
And keep reminding people that until they stop this greed they are a company that should be avoided.
---
If enough people stop giving them money they will change. If people keep buying any of their products they will just carry on acting this way and it will spread into all their IPs.
---
Wow. I only keep caps on my mules, so I don’t have to keep transferring stuff. Just imagine though if you could put anything in the stash. Now that would be something to be really sad about.
---
I have not tested this but from what i read and hear, there is a cool down timer that starts when you log out (i don't know how long the timer is) but if you log back in (under that time) you will be put back into the same world.
---
Well, it is a box to store junk in. A trash can, one might say.
---
So I just need to know, now that you’ve had it for 24 hours...
---
Did you win yet? Like, did you win *immediately* after you paid, or is there some secret win criteria you get sent to you in game to win with at your leisure?
---
This is important, because according to reddit this subscription is “pay to win”, and I’m keen to understand my “time to win” value recognition.
---
Dude, do it!!! If nothing else you're getting month 1 free sub while actually paying for a 1650/outfit bundle from atomic shop!
---
I think they structured it wrong, if they'd have come at it with a one month free sub when u buy this bundle thing, it might have served better. When you have to stop a subscription, I feel locked in.
---
I'm willing to bet you'll love it. But try it for you, screw anyone elses opinion :)
---
It’s a private session - not a private server. If the person with First leaves - then if there’s another person with First it will stay up, but if not the server closes in 20min. The lag is noticeably better
---
ESO has been out for 5 years and has had 5 years of stuff added. FO76 has been out 1 year, had lots of new stuff added, and wastelanders will be biggest game changer yet. I'm not surprised it got delayed, they want to make sure all choices and decisions work as intended, the have to hire voice actors and make sure NPCs are triggering right, and the testing so it doesn't make performance worse. If they decided to not delay it and rushed it out, these same people would be complaining about it too. People bitch just to bitcb
---
Is it a MMO? Did I miss the update from 24 players to MMO?
---
This sub doesnt represent the majority of the player base. This is the vocal minority which should primarily be ignored unless an actual useful idea is presented. Instead the entirety of the front page is filled with trash from people that have too much time on their hands and need to be angry about something.
---
I did buy it as well but have not experienced this issue at all. Still have everything, also if you scrap your bulk first you can store it.
---
Normally I would agree with you, but you can almost pinpoint the exact moment Bethesda changed tactics (the Creation Club and Fallout Shelter, IMO).
---
The most egregious thing back in the day was horse armor. I never thought it would get to *this*. I miss the days when I could play Halo Reach or Gears of War with my friends and just have a good time, or play a Bethesda game and not feel like I was getting fucked.
---
My friend wants one that looks like a poo pile lol
---
holy fuck my man
---
First came oblivion was pretty good slightly lacking but all around a good game then came fallout 3 huge hit everybody loved it then came skyrym was terrible but incredibly profitable less content all around beth sees this and says hey we can do less work but make it look pretty and the modders will do everything else for us basically either there engine is too old to put more things in it or they just got lazy
---
That's cool, that just makes you part of the problem. Enjoy playing your own "private" server while you waste your money and make the future of this game even worse.
---
Ok.. as it was before Fallout 1st came out.
---
Not sure where you are going..
---
And basically any Atom shop purchase. I’m constantly amazed at how many camps seemingly have *every* camp item you can buy.
---
He could at least put an SSL certificate......mediocre
---
Enjoy wasting your money on a "private" server and making the future of this game even worse. Cant wait for the patch that breaks these servers lol
---
Incredible.
---
k
---
No one PvPs with junk on them. And if you're agreeing to PvP while over encumbered your just dumb.
---
There are WAY more of us, who have quit the game from the start, from day one, leading up to the first few months, and onward, than you people who are still playing and supporting a buggy mess that is still crashing a year after release.
---
Mr. literal over here. You don’t think Bethesda game fans feel robbed? It’s a common expression in English when you are scammed into buying a shit product to say “I got robbed.”
---
You might be literal, but you’re clearly too dumb to understand the basics of colloquial communication.
---
thanks for all this info, it is appreciated!
---
It's a huge advantage for all 12 of you who still care about PVP in this game outside nuclear winter
---
It’s all good. The Outer Worlds comes out tomorrow 🖖🏻
---
On the contrary, the DMCA has provision for a 24h takedown notice. And since the domain was registered after the F1st came to be, it's "prior art" and trademarked. As such the usage of the domain in context with fallout 76 is an infringement. Add on top the fact that Beth's graphics were used, the text mostly used in full with some expletives strewn in (which does NOT make it satire)... No hoster would let that stand after receiving a DMCA or a CD order.
---
Why is this a BS move? I missed it the first go around, but was able to pick it up this time. 
---
Some of these threads are just sour grapes.
---
I won in the fact that the world is even more lonely without other players in it.
---
FO76 is a genuine effort from shitty devs. Anthem is a shitty effort from good devs. Anthem has to be the laziest game I have played, while FO76 is incredibly ugly with bad mechanics. Anthem nails gameplay, FO76 does a lot, but they do it very mediocre.
---
:-O You are still with us!?!?!
---
PS4, but who knows. Since Sony allow cross platform play we might get to play with other platforms at some point!
---
Sigh.
---
I am an SEO guy, and yes, usually backlinking to a website from a respectable source/website (one with high authority) will generate "authority" or "link juice", but Google put a stop to abuse of type you guys are doing here back in the early 00's.
---
The creation of:
---
    rel="nofollow"
---
&gt; The nofollow value was originally suggested to stop comment spam in blogs. Believing that comment spam affected the entire blogging community, in early 2005 Google's Matt Cutts and Blogger's Jason Shellen proposed the value to address the problem.
---
[Explained here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow) Certain sites that are recognised as blogs, forums, or social media, either have a severe reduction in "link juice", or are completely invalidated, due to the abuse you can achieve as a collective community, or simply by putting a link in a forum signature.
---
So unfortunately, the links being posted here will most likely not do anything for the authority building, especially since they are all coming from the same exact URL source.
---
Man once again you helped me out. I moved 400lbs of junk into mine last night, saw this post and ran back to save it - still there. I know you probably have plenty of friends around here after helping so many, but if theres anything you need in the meantime feel free to hit me up. Maybe I can help YOU for a change ;)
---
Yeah that's what you think, but in reality that number is very significant, and growing with every new fuckup.
---
Only "logic" I'm seeing is that it affects pvp and your ability to not be overloaded with gear?
---
If you're playing pvp, it's either nuclear winter, or you're going against people in HvH?
---
Either way you know what you signed up for and should expect to lose your shit if you die?
---
My new favorite thing I just saw was that only cosmetics would be paid. But you've seen them go against that already with scrap and repair kits. By that logic, the scrap bot is p2w, since you can't get it in game and it generates an advantage.
---
Bottom line, do I think they should have done a lower tier for private worlds only? Yeah. Hosting millions of servers costs money.
---
But again, as I said if you really think this is irredeemable, stop playing or stop complaining, before they turn your complaints into more paid services. 😂
---
Yes, this. They are barely pay to win, but still slightly are. They were testing.
---
Sounds like a good game to try :)
---
I'm confident in my connection, never had issues with other games. That still doesn't stop the server from not responding
---
Password is 1299.
---
I ain’t going nowhere
---
Seems like you were already done anyway, friend. I'm enjoying the hell out of it and each friend that I brought with me yesterday has changed their doubtful tune.
---
Thanks for the well wishes!
---
Yes thats my point. We wanted craftable repair kits, instead we got ones that you can buy with atoms. Perhaps i wasnt as clear as i should have been in my post regarding that point.
---
We got repair kits but they were implemented in a different manner that was not recieved well.
---
It's a public forum where everyone is free to express themselves.
---
What do you want, dude? Jeez, let people blow off some steam - it's not about you.
---
So, if you bought this game, you're a clown.
---
Excuse me? I haven't even really been playing this game, much less buying atoms in the past few months. And i knew they'd keep slipping down the slippery slope, i just didn't expect it to be so sudden that they push something like this.
---
Probably, but then all you'd hear is bitching about how this is going to further delay Starfield and ES6 and FO5.
---
What are you winning?
---
 To anyone who has had this bug . Can you test if this bug is repeatable and if you lose junk even if you log straight into a private world? Try putting a few pieces of junk in the container and logging out and right into a private server then do it again for private to adventure. I am at work and haven't logged back in yet. So I can't test it out yet. I recommend anyone to move junk back to their stash boxes and just use the scrap box as temporary overflow that you wont mind losing if it does bug out.
---
The number of items in a stack are stored as an integer represented by hexadecimal values.  A 32 bit integer is *always* that same 32 bits(4 bytes) regardless of there being 1 item or  2,147,483,647 of an item in a stack.
---
i mark this day as when the real bombs dropped destroying whats left of the game.
---
I played over 200 hours and left after the whole "we can even get the power armor in a fallout game to work correctly for over two months" fiasco. I don't need purchase fallout first to know i don't want to pay for the solution to the problems bethesda created to begin with (limited stash, server stability, private sessions with friends)
---
No they will just get early access
---
Are you like a dumb ass like i am or something where is it give the thread closure lmao
---
It's not just with wallets, public shaming also works. It too affects revenue with the potential to ruin brand image which in turn affects sales. Public shaming was good enough for Blizzard, it's good enough for Bethesda too.
---
Ok so I’ve logged in and out of both works twice now, adding junk each time. Still there. I just quickly read another reply saying they used the survivor tent and it was gone. Now I did that on private just before I logged into public this morning so it might be that. I’m going to try that now.
---
Kakoa gaming would like a word with you
---
Oh, thanks
---
Yeah but will they even find the guy? If he used a VPN to register with fake data, pre-purchased payment method and who-is protection, how will they find him/her?
---
And made by the original fucking developers of fallout
---
Thank god! For a moment I thought we’d lost another one. Glad all 53 of us are still here
---
All. All of this sub is being brigaded.
---
Yeah and now some people can take the junk out of their stash, and put weapons, armor, chems etc. that they carry in there instead of junk. And some people can't if they don't have the unlimited junk stash that costs money. It is a direct advantage that affects gameplay. It is by definition PAY to WIN.
---
It kind of proves to me that Bethesda’s old guard aren’t calling the shots in any form anymore. They’ve propped up Todd’s dead corpse and have gone full “Weekend at Bernie’s”.
---
bro it's obvious Bethesda is giving you the best handjob of your life, you have your opinion and I have mine so it's ok
---
He probably spent more on the domain than he would've spent on a subscription, but hey, if you wanna waste money to "stick it to the man" have a blast.
---
Are you Bloodied board of it with faster swing speed or just regular board?
---
Very sorry to hear that. And so it will continue like that.
---
Yeah guys go ahead and spend 60 bucks for a hyped up shit game to prove a point to Beth, and then come crawling back to FO76 when you figure out how the game has no story or soul then remember you could have used that money to buy 4 months sub.
---
I’ll be here waiting.
---
if you hate it so much, quit, uninstall, no one in the community would miss you, and your blood pressure will thank you, less things to stress about.
---
I thought the same but it’s now happened to three people I know so it’s a deff bug. I subscribed for the atoms and scrap box so I’m getting half of what I wanted. Not great, not terrible. lol
---
I bet, that they will introduce creation club mods for Fallout 76, but you have to buy them from the Atom Shop and can be enabled for your "private" world. 
---
I also go a step further. They will bring mods for publics server, which you can buy. UI Enhancements, Texture mods, workshop mods etc, which you can also buy from the Atom Shop. Those are then created by 'modders'.
---
Everything from Bethesda was a lie and they will continue to abuse this game.
---
When there's a will, there's a way.
---
Anything short of that I doubt this game will last longer than a year.
---
No you won't,  you'll just continue to cry like a bitch that got fingerfucked and dumped.  It's quite pathetic
---
If you had more than 100-200 junk at any given time your management was horrendous...
---
there is like 10 posts now about it! it happened to me, too! i also have an opening ticket about it.
---
Did you just assume everyone on this sub is from America? Lol wtf
---
So Beth is shutting down public servers pretty soon, eh?
---

---
Then why are you still posting? The game literally never crashes on me and I experience almost no bugs.
---
I wasn't saying it's normal to add one later. Inwas saying subscription fees used to be normal
---
It's petty of me, but I'm glad people who actually paid for this service are having problems. In the end it's their money and they can do what they want with it, but their shitty spending habits are going to affect the rest of us who just want feature complete games not being stuck behind paywalls.   
---
While you're looting the same buildings over and over again hoping your server doesn't drop you, I'll be playing Outer Worlds and be immersed in an actual story, for the same price as what you paid for this nonsense, since Outer Worlds is on game pass.
---
Thats how i felt about fallout 4
---
How is this acting like the joker? The guy is just trying to argue that people shouldn't be supporting poor monetization practices. When people purchase these things the company can and will continue to do it. Why are you downplaying his concerns? Is this kind of monetization in video games not a problem to you?
---
mister rogers would be ashamed of human society as it ended up today. may sound terrible, but i'm glad he's dead so he wouldn't have to see things like this.
---
I didn’t say it was a fallout game. I said it was more of a fallout game than 76. And my reasoning is because it has all those things I listed. And those things weather or not you like or need them is undoubtably why fallout became a massive rpg franchise. So in my opinion it has more fallout elements than fallout 76.
---
It has nothing to do with carrying junk. It has to do with stash space. Pretty obvious, since it is concerning unlimited stash space.
---
The lead in some places is gone and... Fusion cores in generators are already pulled...wtf?
---
You're not wrong
---
I'll never understand people like you. This game was a broken mess at launch (haven't played it in a long time) and you're still defending them? Stop cucking yourself and call these dickheads out when they fuck up. The developers are working hard? Well so do I, which is why I expect a complete product when I buy a game. Not this unfinished, half assed bullshit.

Yes... It's bad... Somehow for future gamers. Dont you see????? 
---
Money is bad+ everything for free. Classic reddit.
---
Maybe the tent is treated as a separate storage space than your camp /other player camps. Maybe your stuff is still in the tent scrap/stash box.
---
Very well said!!! I agree completely.

Selling Fo76, will take any offers.

Working for a company which hosts over 300 TLDs, I can assure you we instantly yoink domains via copyright infringement claims.

My friend tested this out last night. He was unable to scrap and deposit his junk in my scrap box.

Holy fuck...just read some you history comments, you are not an asshole, you are an idiot, plain and simple idiot.
---
I trully hope that you are a fake account otherwise must be extremly painful being that much of an idiot...jesus...
---
Bethesda not wanting fans of previous titles sure are spending a ton of time including a lot of lore and easter eggs for those very fans.
---
They even tried to patch up the continuity so there would be fan favorites BoS in Appalachia.
---
What kind of multiplayer does The Outer Worlds have?
---
Lets see...they have added the burrows, arkos labs, the order of the tadpole, nukashine and new crafting benchs, vault raids and NW.  
---
Been a bit more than 1 update.
---
Having to pay 1200 for something I already owned is bs
---
Just a note, IIRC, Pete Hines is the VP of Marketing.
---
When FO76 Released, he didn't appear in public, until E3. Then he slunk away again.
---
My dudes, you're being played. Cut your losses and play a better game. You'll feel much happier in the long run.
---
Assuming the stupid posts are from America lol
---
well excuse me for farming a lot of junk on a game you're meant to farm on, shit my fault
---
Royal?
---
ESO Plus gives you access to DLCs which are not free. It isn't worth it either, but ESO never said their DLCs would be free, so having a subscription that allows you to get them for free, is pretty good.
---
I don't believe Bethesda took it down. Domain was bought by some random 4channer and has been trending on a few subreddits now. The dude could've been hosting it on a raspberry pi on his home connection for all we know and it was overwhelmed with requests. I'm not defending Bethesda here but everyone needs to take off the tinfoil hats.
---
Their press release said that increased CAMP budget and Workshop Persistence are coming.  They're not part of it yet, though.
---
I suspect itll probly be more like an increased scrip cap as opposed to pack u can buy u cant claim scrip pack is a convience as easily
---
I don't know the details but I hear ESO isn't exactly a saint when it comes to mtx either.
---
I gave up on Bethesda quite some time ago when they started the bullshit in DOOM(price in Brazil went from R$150 to R$ 260 the standard version).
---
Played every FO so far and loved all of them even 4, but FO76 didn't pre order and bought 3 weeks later for 1/4 of the launch price, still felt scamed.
---
Sorry. What?
---
Defending a corporation is blowing off steam now?
---
Me arguing that just giving a pass to them because “everyone is corrupt, why bother?” Is bullshit is somehow silencing him? 
---
It is a public forum. A place to exchange ideas and argue for them. My comment has as much right to be here as yours and the guy I responded to.
---
You are nearly on point. Perhaps I've been reading too many negative posts the last 24 hours but I can't tell if you are legitimately sharing information or attempting to shine light on a conspiracy.
---
The plasma goo thing was apparently addressed in the update so technically you should strike out that part of #1. Otherwise yes, correct. 
---
You are absolutely right about events and wow is it nice.
---
The 12 month price is less than outright buying the same number of atoms. It is essentially a monthly atom subscription with additional benefits. Kind of like friends with benefits.
---
You must be from America
---
But why are you surprised? Bethesda has done this for years. Literally. Most of the stuff they made money off of in the creation club was made by modders and Bethesda is making money off of them.
---
I'm not saying don't be outraged, but I am saying your outrage is 6+ years too late.
---
Haha
---
yeah sure, and my grandmother can fly on Halloween.
---
But if they had prototype’s of The hellfire power armour why did they bother to improve the X-01 and make it advanced power armour mark one and then the mark 2
---
The information and screens were here from the today's morning...
---
&gt;happy to drop a few dollars a month for QOL improvements.
---
Now seriously think for a second, do you really and i mean REALLY believe that.
---
Coz i can tell you that the dollars you drop are 100% NOT GOING to QOL improvements
---
somebody just commented on one of the threads "i never bought it because of the reviews". okay cool, why are you here then?
---
I bought the Elsweyr expansion for ESO a few weeks ago when it was on sale and I am loving it. The Necromancer class is a blast!!
---
I don’t even understand how they ever got so far off course to begin with. They were probably the most loved publishers out there a year ago. All of the gargantuas fuck ups they made, seem like common sense things to me, it’s hard to believe that the leaders of a multi-million dollar company could be so simple minded.
---
There's more to this game than just farming legenwaitforitdaries.

There's more to this game than just farming legendaries.

I literally found it yesterday, I did another post where I was seeing what all the new content since the first month it was released, which I haven't played since. I went to all the vaults to see if they were open, and having forgot where they were googled it and it this one came up. No code though, so if 1299 is the code like the other guy said, I'm going to give it a try.
---
I really enjoyed Far Harbour such wonderful atmosphere.
---
Stop comparing every game to FO4 then
---
Your expectations are your own.
---
For me, if I can get 100-200 hours of entertainment out of a game that I spent $60 for, thats a good deal.
---
1000+ hours for $60 is an outstanding deal and shouldn't be considered "the norm"
---
What's that? I couldn't hear you with Bethesda's dick in your mouth.
---
This is their version of PTW
---
This is fine.
---
Most people don't give a shit about private servers, if they add actual substantial content for free they can save the game.
---
For a lot of people I don't think it's necessarily about Fallout 1st.
---
It's about the corporations that have taken over the gaming industry and their never ending push to the boundaries of how much money they can squeeze out of the players
---
I agree, but what they've done is make a PTW version for farming legendaries.
---
Have heard a few people loving that too... I'm just hesitant since it's been out for so long that it might feel dated.
---
I did notice the absence of bobbleheads and magazines, but was assuming it was done for balancing and they just didn't tell us in hopes we wouldn't notice. I don't trust them to make things work first time, so only put crap I can afford to lose into the scrap box.
---
How exactly is it pay to win? Paying money doesn't give you an advantage at all over other players. It gives utility, there is no power advantage over other players
---
Can you list AAA games released in the past year that were as messy as fallout 76
---
And no you cant say anthem
---
the one thing i will disagree with you on is in-game atoms being generously given out. some of those challenges are a pain, and some don't even complete properly. also bringing up starfield and es6 doesn't mean anything because it's a completely different team working on those games. other than that i agree with you, though. people are making this out to be worse than it is.
---
We all know nobody is gonna buy it.
---
I’ve just tried logging in and out of both servers twice, putting junk in the box each time and it’s still there. After you mentioned using the tent box I’ve just done that and logged in and out of both servers and still there, so no idea how it happened. I did use my tent stash and someone else’s, just trying to find another players stash now.
---
Great point right here. Weed and video games are the only things that haven't increased in price since the 90s. Weed has actually gotten cheaper.
---
Cdpr, paradox is pretty good, im prety happy with frontier. Off the top of my head. Each have products that i have spent a lot of time in and have been more than happy with how they communicated with their communities and the delivery of their products.
---
With a lot of time i mean over 500 hours. In comparrison i spent somewhere in the ballpark of 700h in fo76
---
Kill them with kindness... literally!
---
Now that you mention it I'm actually worried about what Wastelanders will become with their greed...
---
Buggy and laggy at launch and probably prone for missclicks on the choices due to how selecting things is already buggy sometimes...but hey as a 'money 1st'-sub you will probably be able to redo your quest choices while others are stuck with the missclicks
---
I'm not playing any MMOs. Haven't for a while. I have some single player games like Satisfactory and Outer Worlds tomorrow. Not sure what's next after that. I have just been logging in to Fortnite and Fallout 76 to do dailies, or get research points and expeditions. I have to complete some quests in Fortnite to get the new Halloween hero Willow so I have that to do also.
---
I don't know why you'd pay for a private session, without it being persistent I judt don't see the point.
---
Agreed, I’ve defended this game forever but it’s the last straw
---
Oh don't worry, there are still hopeless causes on here.  You can find them downvoted into Oblivion and posting limp-wristed threads supporting Fallout 1st.
---
Reviews are in, its mostly bug free.
---
Not every company is Bethesda.
---
 I believe what we are seeing is the marketing strategy of Beth competitors. (YES, before yas rip me apart, this subscription thing is total horseshit.. I'm not saying we aren't angry) But we need to understand something in this sub.. people HERE and  on other social media, twitchers, youtubers are now tools of advertising. Companies are handing out freebies, goodies, and paying money to promote THIER game and shit on competition. This is the world we live in. Social media  trend/outrage campaigns can move product more then a catchy commercial or a flashy pop up. So consider this when you watch posts/youtubers spouting "opinions". Those could be bought and paid for opinions being spoon fed to you by the very company that stands to profit. 
---
Just saw this post as an opportunity to point out the very real issue we keep dancing around in this sub. Carry on.
---
Ok not the tent. Just logged in on both servers putting junk in and it’s still there. So weird.
---
The technical issues was proved with the unlimited weight glitch, remember when servers crashed and lagged because of them having too much stuff on them? Funny thing is I doubt they done enough stabilizing for this not to crash in 14 days lol
---
We ran the vault last night and it was glorious!
---
Well I guess it's time to explore new locations. I don't understand why they are adding more vaults if they haven't done anything with existing vaults that aren't accessible.
---
They never said that , they said DLC will be free , which it is, also everyone knew Private servers would cost money to rent so its not really surprising.
---
Kids today don't know what P2W is and that's sad.  Anything that allows you to shortcut the game mechanics is paying to win.  Logging in to a private world to hold all workshops and store infinite scrap so you don't have to farm anymore is paying to win.  Repairing a gun without having to go back to a workbench is paying to win.  Being able to store food with useful buffs is paying to win.  Using a tent to fast travel and not having to move your resource farming CAMP is paying to win.  And on and on and on.
---
If you don't mind P2W games that's your business.  But please for the love of God stop acting like you can't fathom why other people don't.  Do chores for an hour when you want to play or pay $13/month to not do chores.  Most people (myself included) find that business model awful and don't want to waste their time playing a P2W game.
---
God y'all are fucking toxic, it's a video game for fucks sake and you're literally calling people out by name and demanding they answer for some perceived injustice. This is fucking disgusting
---
This makes sense. We'll see in 24/48h
---
😂😂😂 I can have thousands of items in several other online games. It's only Bethesda that made it a problem. Either they are too dumb to realize how to properly store low tier data, their system was broken from the start, or it was all a scam to begin with.
---
yeah nah. this one's different. Beth is shitting in peoples' corn flakes and charging them for the privilege this time. it's indefensible.
---
To The outer Worlds 🚀
---
For anyone who is willing to have a civil conversation about this, feel free to message me. I'm not saying that you're not allowed to have opinions, I am merely asking you to look at where those opinions are rooted. Again this company isn't your friend, they are not beholden to anything, even their own words. Clearly. Just don't act surprised when this happens, when it happened months ago and you decided to still play the game.
---
... You guys are so used to being shit on its sad
---
Right, you don't need to buy it. It's just nice to have. Tbh I'd have paid that many atoms just for the dance emotes
---
But my original junk isn’t back.
---
\^This
---
Not in 6 hours it can't. The US courts aren't that fast.
---
This is a great post OP, and a great perspective. Don’t let others tell you differently. Thanks for sharing.
---
I agree with you.  I have Fallout 1st explicitly to be able to be left alone to play with my friends whenever I want.  That's what I paid for (and got) and wanted more than anything.
---
The lag-free experience was a bonus in my book.. that should absolutely be in the base game.  It's definitely how the game was meant to feel, and it's unfortunate that it does not feel like that on the public servers.
---
Well I know a few interesting locations. Might as well relive it again and see whats new.
---
Yeah. Epic sent me Subnautica for free (I think it was their first free game they gave out?), it's a fantastic experience.
---
I meant to the next raid but true
---
Also give away all their stuff, since they're never ever ever ever never ever coming back /s
---
Yeah sure
---
What do u play on
---
I read on Reddit that the cooldown is about 20 or 30 minutes.
---
Never.
---
As soon as someone explains how to “win” I’ll agree.
---
You attack a CM and expect her to come here and answer for "her" crimes? She works for Bethesda, she isn't the decision maker when it comes to product and pricing. Get a life, leave her alone and direct your venom at the people responsible. 
---
If you ever read her Twitter you'll know that she, and other CMs in the industry, get daily violent threats on a NORMAL day. You think her inbox is in a better state today than normal or worse? 
---
Get off the Internet and stop making people's life worse.
---
Honestly you deserve it for giving them more money after all this.
---
Can confirm. The private server container I was issued last night was not fresh and new and most magazine, plan and loot spawns were looted. It's likely they don't dispose of the paas containers once all users are disconnected. At least not before they get reissued. It's not end if the world.
---
You really telling me. You don't care at all with how broken the game is.  Look how it released.  Look at the people who bought the collectors edition and got a shit bag without being told.  Look how broken the game is but they certainly make sure the atom.shop works. And they're trying to.pump.the game with content that'll probably just break more and more.  
---
You really telling me you don't care about how fucked they've gone about this game.
---
This is what people don't seem to realize.  When. you go out of your way to call someone a shill or an idiot because they are doing something you don't like, you only make them more likely to do that thing. 
---
Look how well those attacks work in politics
---
"Why are you surprised that guy murdered 10 kids? He's been murdering kids for years, jeez get over it!" 
---
&gt; your outrage is 6+ years late. 
---
Ever think I have been outraged by this stuff for years, that I've been saying it'll only get worse and worse? 
---
We started at horse armor DLC and look where we got. And back then, people like you laughed and scoffed, told us our outrage is misplaced and buried your head in the sand.
---
"4 paragraphs" lol. Probably took like 5 minutes to write. Yet you've been all over this sub defending Bethesda for the past 24 hours at least. Chill out.
---
i tend to agree. my immediate response was "well that's fucking stupid, what idiot would pay for that?" but i'm not going to stop playing because of it.
---
So close.. Just same old shit. 7 out of 10 for response tho. Most of these "people" dont have that.
---
Wow, lack of an argument so you just attack. That’s pathetic
---
I admire their environmental story telling and the scattered audio logs and notes, where you piece the story of individuals together. Sadly you can only really do this with any depth when it relates to quests, which I’ve long since exhausted.
---
Ha too right.
---
Uh oh, one of the angry enablers is mad that he ignored all warning signs and blinding gargled bethesdas balls
---
This is them generating cash flow to continue spending on development and hosting because micro transactions are falling out of favor not just here in fo76 but all games. A game like this can never be free. There is continuous cost that far exceeds revenue generated from title sales.
---
Well, when I tried it yesterday the code was "000000", perhaps 1299 also works.  
---
Also I suggest to nuke it because it could tell us things about it. If it crashes the server, then it is a Vault Raid that is planned there, and it would also mean that the vault is advanced in its devellopement, etc...
---
I asked for it.  Please do not make sweeping statements that claim to speak for everyone.  Thanks.
---
Mostly because Bethesda implying or outright saying that future content would be free and there would be no non-cosmetic microtransactins, statements that now appear to have been complete lies.  
---
Then toss in that these "private" servers aren't really private and the unlimited stash space is bugged and is deleting all of peoples junk. These people were swindled.  
---
Also, the game is a turd, has been a turd, and likely will always be a turd and despite that Bethesda has the audacity to try and squeeze more money from the few players that are left. It wasn't worth the $60 asking price and isn't worth %100 a year more now.
---
Or update your OS. People who avoid updates are the anti-vaxers of the IT world.
---
Aw man I didn't think about that! God how silly of me.
---
Money! So more sell outs buy it to stay on the server
---
So tent stash and normal train station stash are the same thing. Just want to make sure I’m clear. I pulled from my tent stash and then deposited in the tent scrap thing
---
They said it when private servers released lol. It’s hasn’t been later yet
---
Well usually private means alot more then empty.
---
And they aren't even empty. And if they are just reusing their current servers why is the monthly prices so fucking high.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20191024101229/http://falloutfirst.com/ lol can't get rid of it forever
---
Free servers dwindle the public player base. Paid private servers do not because everyone is complaining and doesn't want to pay that much.  
---
Guess who has a private server? This guy.   
---
There was terrible decisions that fell on deaf ears but somehow you guys thought you'd pay $7 for the Fridge but the whole Private server would be FREE?!
---
Yes they can crash. If you join back in time it IS the same server. Tested with a friend last night.
---
And thats fine, I wasn't going to leave the game for good because i had hopes that private servers would save it (not that i really hoped standalone private 24x7 hosted servers with admin access). But bethesda provided exactly what i feared, private, non persistent sessions with paywalled benefits that effectively create a subclass of players that get a better gaming experience. All of this after saying that unlimited stash was a technical limitation, that they were working on server stability and that only cosmetic transactions will support the game. 
---
Now in order to play the game in a less frustrating way, they want you to put up more cash, instead of rebalancing and fixing the base game
---
Well, I haven't played in months and I do need the space....
---
Forbes is the hottest garbage fire alight. Their game reporting is at the very bottom of the barrel; which is pretty impressive given how deep the barrel of shittiness in “gaming journalism” goes.
---
I mean, people can bitch about Fallout 1st all they want, but for the love of god please don’t go to *Forbes* to get your information or validation.
---
Your low enough on the totem poll that they don't care what you say and likely don't care unless it effects the company like if any of the mods said something ugly about the game the subreddit would have a field day and they would be fired if they are in the Austin branch since Texas is the right to work state aka they can fire you without a reason.
---
Theres some Ranger Armor you get for being a first member.
---
i imagine that the sudden threat of NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST made many scientists freak out and rush to various facilities (the oil rig, whitesprings) without being able to gather everything. this is only a personal headcannon as it isn't stated, but the only logical explanation for me is that the enclave on the oil rig only had X-01 prototypes/blueprints to make their armor, which is why they use them in Fallout 2. by the time they fled to DC in Fallout 3, they traveled across the country so maybe they managed to either acquire X-02 plans, or their scientists were able to re-develop the design. and then since we don't see Hellfire armor until Broken Steel, it's likely they just found the plans for that lying around somewhere in DC (the enclave IS former US government, after all. I can believe they knew about a secret government facility somewhere that had the armor).
---
i admit Fallout's lore isn't clearly stated, but it isn't like the plot holes are impossible to iron out with a little effort. would be nice if Bethesda themselves did it, but. i came up with this possibility in five minutes, so it's not some unbelievable inconsistency.
---
By no definition can what they delivered be considered "private servers".
---
Just because you have the money doesn’t mean you have to buy it
---
Ohhh must feel so good look back at those idiots commentaries and laugh at them...good for you mate.
---
Let me say that I'm sorry that people are getting so aggressive. I don't agree with the whole paying for Fallout 1st, because it supports a market tactic I'm not a fan of. But you should not be ashamed for wanting to have fun with a videogame.
---
Thay being said. Holyshit!!!! How does it fuck up that hard?
---
So having extra aid and gear in your stash you cant access in a fight is pay to win. Logic checks out. Who the fuck is actively carrying around so much shit they dont use they are over encumbered all tbe time? Not to mention if they plan to pvp - for some god forsaken reason. I swear reddit is just as bad as 4chan when it comes to crying.
---
Calling everyone who just wants to enjoy the game as a casual Player and Not crying about the game having a subscription like 1000000 a shill seems cool nowadays
---
Well. I mean it's one thing to charge a subscription service for a bug free, new content rich, perhaps f2p game.
---
It's another thing to charge subscription for a game that has no new content, was initially $60, and bugs that affect not only base players, though bugs that break paid subscription content.
---
I don't understand why they would have even jokingly released this without Wastelanders along with bugs like this.
---
true that brotha
---
Hence why I stopped playing it. Ark, like fallout, is another example of a game that came so close to my ideal MMO. Both games had some great aspects. Alas, they both lost me for various overwhelming reasons.
---
Buddy.. that's called pay to win.
---
If you have to pay for QOL then its pay to win.
---
Seriously you cant actually think its good they are asking money for stuff that should be included in the base game that costs 60$
---
ESO works, is not plagued by anywhere near the issues that FO76 suffers from, has much more meaningful content, makes use of a wider universe, deeper storytelling and richer lore than the restrictive FO76 that under-utilises its world, and hasn’t been reduced to a boringly repetitive daily grind - in other words, it’s something worth continuing to pay for. Bethesda has got priorities wrong here from the start - they should have fixed the game, resolved all problems, expanded content and all but eliminated server latency and connection problems rather than focusing on monetisation - the least we could expect in the first year. But no, they want more money off us instead. Hey, the game didn’t sell too well and isn’t making enough money off the Atom Shop - so surely people will keep paying for it instead, right?
---
Lol okay :) then don't get it. But the bitching bandwagon is old, tired, and people are rushing in to post about how shocked they are so they can have their mob behind them and feel good about themselves. Maybe that's not you, idk.
---
You could wait and see, or don't ever get it, that's not my point in the OP at all. But what's absurd is to see another post about how something you've never tried is shit and that your opinion should be everyone's before you've even visited someone's server or asked them how it is.
---
Internet salt wears me out.
---
I run vault raids a lot, so i just wanted my own server for stability reasons. Havnt even built or touched the scrap box.
---
Being angry all the time is exhausting.
---
Trolling all the time is exhausting.
---
Watching porn all the time is exhausting.
---
I’m old.
---
What worse with the delay of wastelanders I can't help but think it wasn't delayed cause they want to get it right but they delayed it because this was the priority.
---
These pretzels are making me thirsty!
---
Oh. The outfit. Yeah. That's fine. Purely cosmetic.
---
It’s definitely worse, but the people that pay, including myself are ok with it, Zenimax Media, the parent company of Bethesda deisgned ESO and its microtransactions.
---
This is stupid. The controversy is stupid. The rant posts are stupid. The linked website is stupid. The image is stupid. Anyone who thinks this is some "edgy gotcha" to Bethesda is, well, you can see where this is going.
---
You deserve it. What's even worse is that even after this shit you'll continue to stay subscribed and you'll continue to support this dreadful company even if you don't get your stuff back. People like you are the reason this subscription exists.
---
People really are playing this and paying for that subscription?  
---
What a fkn no brain sheeps you are.
---
Remember when monster hunter world gave free loot for weeks just because the game did well in sales.
---
“Are people really this upset about X?”
---
The answer is **always** yes.
---
Pics or it didn't happen. 
---
 Course, anybody still logging into the game after the FO1st announcement is already chugging Bethesdas's nuts so hard they probably didn't even blink at the price tag.  
---
So I'd say, plausible.
---
New Zealand
---
This is my first online game, so i didnt make the connection with other services usuing the 1st name. Hopefully it is just a name.
---
I disagree, but would be an interesting poll. True dedicated servers not run through Bethesda with a 32+ capacity, mod support, and customizable settings **VS.** new content, of course there's no reason we can't have both.
---
I heard the argument that people would have swallowed the "Fallout First" garbage better if the game wasn't in such a deplorable state to begin with. Add in the wastelander update and **then** do the subscription. People won't subscribe to a game that sucks or has no content...
---
But I love Todd and Uncle Pete....
---
That's just one of the reasons I've been reading on reddit/other forums for why people are upset.
---
Hey are you Kismet the twitch streamer?
---
Okay now thats interesting because I've heard this as a possibility from someone else who doesn't close their client the by going to the main menu and then selecting quit to desktop. They would force stop the game or force quit while loading in a given server. So maybe if you only force stop the game in a certain way that it triggers this. I wounder if server crashes or players losing connection will also cause this loss.
---
Lol, did that yesterday
---
Hope for Bethesda doing something not-shady at this point? After all you just gave them the ideas they needed now like the community did months ago when we requested basic features that they now force us to pay for
---
No worries, hope you have a great day.
---
Move on. I dislike this too, but shitting on everyone who likes it is not a productive use of your time.
---
That is the infuriating part. That Is the worst of ir all. That Is what Made me go back to Fallout 4. You pay premium: the game works better. Some seriously fucked up shit right there.
---
I lost all my junk yesterday on Xbox &amp; I was able to replicate the bug (in my case that seemed to cause the issue)
---
— Force quitting while loading into adventure and then loading into a private server is what caused me to lose my junk a second time —
---
I've actually done that 1 or 2 times to hang out with some friends and I didn't loose anything...
---
Bethesda is not the only company launching broken games, but its the only company that never bothers to fix any of the bugs.
---
Down voting him because he enjoys the game without the toxic playerbase. For shame
---
How about patroen... works for unofficial patch team.. you know... THE MOST IMPORTANT MOD FOR SKYRIM
---
Some need to save that $20 for a box of hotpockets instead ha
---
Imagine if Bethesda stopped pissing off that other half and they came back to play.
---
Yes sir! Loving it.
---
No it's not, it's really not. We should not look at ESO and say "this is the game we want F76 to emulate." I could give you so many examples of that game being greedy but tbh I play 76 and consider its mtx stuff pretty reasonable. I farmed for almost everything, have even bought like 3 expensive bundles with atoms I farmed before I put actual money into it
---
"Yes. We don't plan on doing anything about it."
---
Awesome.
---
No, a lot of people do have it. You can lie, but the evidence is in every stream, and every video, not just from players, who have given up and just accept it as normal part of struggling through to play the game. For me, it's unacceptable. As much as many just struggle through, there are also many posts about it.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search/?q=crashing&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search/?q=crashing&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
Now that makes sense. I did ft to an area and I got an infinite loading screen, that I did force close after so long. That happens to me so much in the game that if I use my stash again, then I will lose my junk again. Thank you, I can stop testing it now.
---
Because nowadays there is a lot of subscription services out there. Compared to other subscriptions services  which allows you to access full games and not just full features for just the one.  Another thing they keep using the community as an excuse to break their promises. I mean seriously Bethesda, who is out here asking you to pay for more stuff and give you money?
---
Bought it specifically to see which parts of it were broken and I can't place the survivor tent without the game crashing.
---
Been wondering what legendary farming is going to turn into.
---
You deserve this my S.P.E.C.I.A.L boy ! This game is TRASH, why would you pay them more ??????? And how are you surprised that something broke in a BROKEN game ? Youre a pure dumb ass for buying this and I have no respect for you and hope you lose all your gear for buying this monthly garbage.
---
"Its only 15$ a month for you to be alone in the server you lonely fuck"
---
It's not though, time will tell. The fanboys are just hiding like the community managers.
---
Hijacking this comment: Just a heads up, Outer Worlds out today/tomorrow depending on timezone and you can get game pass for a dollar in most countries and play this game for a month on PC or Xbox.
---
A third of Reddit is saying 'we hate Communism!' and a third of Reddit is saying 'we should overthrow the Capitalist pigs!'.
---
The other third is indecipherable gibberish or porn.
---
IT JUST WORKS
---
Just buy the item they release in two weeks that lets you scrap more stuff. Then it won't matter that your other stuff was deleted.
---
Can't wait for the next "basic feature" expansion where they allow save backups.
---
Yeah, my bad. Saw one of your other responses after posting so I deleted my comment. O ly sae your reply now.
---
How about selling shit that should’ve been in the game since launch for a price more expensive than Xbox’s Game Pass itself?
---
You would be suprised how low im not :) i just dont want my personal info out. I get that its different at different companies but when you fear your boss your cheating yourself.
---
Can confirm 
---
The password works on PS4
---
Lmao try me
---
Someone is missing the opportunity to create r/FuckOff76
---
Ain't it grand~?
---
&gt; I feel like we did get a lot more xp and legendaries than we would in a public server
---
Are you saying that by **PAY**ing you seem **TO** be **WIN**ning more?
---
i hope i will enjoy it but im afraid none of those "griefers" never show up. so only thing left is gather billions of resources and enjoy my infinite caps
---
We are unreasonable when they are charging for stash space?
---
I would assume a server crash or losing connection would cause you to lose your junk as well.
---
I’m on Xbox by the way. Shit sucks. I moved around 5,000 Pds of junk off some mules to my main yesterday &amp; lost everything. Really shitty.....
---
Someone just replied on my post and they said they tested it and it was when they had to force close the game. I did this, this morning as I had an infinite loading screen.
---
Maybe then you're the lucky #1, it's a delayed bug or didn't trigger that bug (yet?) 
---
Lets hope for the best and they didn't completely fuck up even the new premium features
---
1) Haven't tried that one, but the ammo loss happens when I switch with the number keys too.
---
2) I don't know. I logged in, started farming West Tek, then I saw AWOL. I don't know how old the server was and the other people there didn't use Plasma weapons.
---
3) Public and no Fallout 1st membership. It isn't exactly new issue for me and occasionally I got it since P12 for sure. I don't know what's causing it because I've been to really laggy Nuke Silos yet MT worked properly there.
---
Yep, all these "Gamers" still think that $60 is a good price point.
---
So is that a yes or a no on if it gives an advantage? I'm still waiting for that answer. I'm not asking if it's a big or small one, just if it does give one.
---
I mean thats how every single dlc in this game has dropped.
---
Like you said its not charity so why would they release anything but the bare minimum in wastelanders for free?
---
So you're going to PvP for one month then quit? And your friends will just afk and not PvP at all? Imagine 5 people paying a bunch of money in the hopes that an angry Redditor will make good on his threat of attacking you in game. That's mental gymnastics, son.
---
When they first announced Wastelanders was delayed, I was disappointed but understanding thinking they wanted to get it right, they had learned from their mistakes. With this announcement, I now think that they delayed it cause they put their focus on this subscription service, and couldn't even get it right.
---
i don't mean online games, i mean online services in general. it's fairly common to mean something like "members get it first", or "first class", etc. Roosterteeth First comes to mind, which gives you episodes of their shows a week early.
---
Call me crazy, but if you're stupid enough to pay money for that Fallout 1st scam, even after that shit-show of a launch where Bethesda had already portrayed themselves as snivelling greedy liars, you maybe deserve to get fucked over at this point.
---
Even Red Dead Redemption 2 was more "complete" than 76 on launch... That sounds like a pretty big oof to me.
---
Being alone in 76 is easily one of the dullest experiences I've had in a game
---
Absolutely it was freakin nice.
---
Better push wastelanders back another quarter to fix this.
---
I dont see mods for fallout 76... the next ES could only have paid nodding.
---
There's so many reasons I dropped this game. 
---
Mainly the bugs. There was still so.many bugs and glitches that at times it made it unplayable. They made small improvements here and there but once I saw that releasing content they could charge for was higher priority than fixing bugs I got fed up pretty quickly. That was the main reason. Perhaps I'll pick it up again in the future but there's much better things I'd like to focus on than playing a frustrating broken game imo
---
Also you can get that experience already by downloading fallout 4 and a mod that kills all the npc:s and enemies.
---
Fuck that made me lol... You never know though man, there might be some poor sod looking to check it out, especially now that it's back in the media's attention with the $100 pass
---
Bethesda at it again
---
"Have fun ~~wasting your money~~ supporting future development, and making the future of this game ~~even worse~~ better for all of us free loaders".
---
Ftfy.
---
At a certain point paying to farm legendaries just becomes a gambling addiction.
---
better? maybe. but people would still complain, because in my experience, fans are never happy with anything anyone does ever.
---
Okay😂😂😂
---
All computer anything was better back when they were too complicated for the average dumbass to understand/use.
---
The weight system for scrap :)
---
STILL CANT HERE YOU
---
[Tada!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bP_40M8uhpU)
---
Ha, good luck with that. Elder Scrolls 6 will undoubtably break sales records. I’m willing to bet on it.
---
Don’t blame Bethesda, blame the corporate overlords at Zenimax
---
Even if Bethesda pulled a 180 and miraculously saved the game, adding everything everyone wanted, that half would still be there just to complain and not play
---
Naa I'll play this game AND subscribe.
---
... you’re missing literally the entire point
---
It was free in the Atomic Shop for Everyone! One of those "grab it before it's gone"  specials. They were giving it away to everyone!
---
Processing from an online database by default takes longer than doing it from a local file.
---
The speed after that depends all on how the database is normalised.
---
Well, guess I don't really have any reason not to. Guess I could get AOE too.
---
personally don’t play on console, so i have no clue.
---
You only have to buy 1 month to get it. Its the most requested skin in the game and have saved atoms for months to unlock it. Sadly they planned for people like me. If they make some changes i will buy 1 month to get it, but as is most people are PISSED but, kids dont count as people, to them its just a new skin after growing up in the era of microtransactions and price gorging. 
---
Also just because you hate it doesnt mean people still wont buy something that makes them mad. I am pissed but i still want that armor for when wastelanders drops for $45.99
---
I guess but why are you so worried someone else has more shit than you?
---
14,99€ and I give you 20 random legendary items per month.
---
They're preparing for Outer Worlds like the rest of us now.
---
It Just Works
---
Ticks are downright lethal now.
---
That video is fucking hilarious.
---
He's 15, but we did play Terraria, we still play Minecraft, I"ve played Diablo games before, they are very good, we play Halo, Left for Dead, etc....  Thanks for the other suggestions.
---
Nothing.
---
Alot of people on the forums are ok with this Sub idea..... still shocked about that but hey let'm pay for it fuck it...
---
You da real MVP.
---
4chan's /v/...heroes of our time
---
Lmao this is hilarious.
---
"Relatively empty" lmao way to put yourself
---
OH WOW. You are correct. Now just his original tweet and reply to @XboxGamePass is there.
---
Oh well, we still have that glorious image.
---
I bet you are right! 
---
Just like the did with this falloutfirst.com URL.
---
Honestly lol if people can say people overreacted with this ppl big time did with eso. Base game has a fuckton to do that lasted till they started pumping stuff out the same year. I wish this game would have the same stamina it did to improve almost immedietly.
---
Omg that is it. I started to log into public and thought no I want to go to private, so I quickly closed it. Wow. I’m assuming that we’ll get our junk back and not really stressing about it right now.
---
If it’s anything like their atom shop refunds, you should be able to get your money back and continue using the service. No clue if this works for private servers, but it sure as hell works for the atom shop. I’ve gotten at least 5k in atoms refunded, every time they say it’s a one time thing, but they’ve done it at least 7-8 times for me. And it’s 76, no one should feel bad scamming scammers.
---
His presentation was fantastic. I would say he described it better then Bethesda did. Someone get this guy a job!
---
Microsoft has done a terrible job of letting people know this.
---
Then what is to stop a company from advertising a product a certain way, then change the design saying they intended to deliver it as promised but couldn't?
---
You are going to defend them when bring out something for 200$ ? How about 500$?
---
Why even waste your life posting that?
---
That's what I can't imagine, living such a shitty existence that you feel the need to negatively comment on somebody else's joy.
---
High 5 for you bro.
---
half a year until release.
---
After a week you’ll be done and then what? And I’m getting it too.
---
Except that won’t happen.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they are using the vault raid instancing on these private servers and you are sharing it with two other private sessions with the corpses being unintended from one of the other instances.
---
"Funding future development" when they said at launch added features would all be free. Face it you got doop and your easily manipulated. It's ok to be wrong. Just make better wallet decisions moving forward
---
Why is everybody shilling for Xbox's game pass? Do they not have $60 to support the developers or is this some kind of campaign for Microsoft? Seriously every one of these posts have been "Uhhh get it on Microsoft game pass"
---
Well it seems like you are saying yes it does give one. Would you agree that's what you're saying?
---
one time i bought a car, drove it for 6 months, and then took it back to the lot and demanded a full refund. shockingly, they refused to give it to me. what assholes, right? /s
---
if you wanted a refund, you should have attempted to get one like a week after purchase. this one's on you.
---
Did we ever get actual confirmation from Bethesda that excess weight was the case?  Because that makes zero sense, given that the "weight" is just a line of text in a database.  Ten thousand pounds is no different than one.
---
It's far more likely that the instability was the methods being used to dupe items.  There were a several, and some even required you to crash the actual server.*
---
Please stop being so negative, bro.
---
Nah... epic games man....
---
Ah, that guy.
---
What EXACTLY do you win??
---
Also have fun with the scrap box glitch on those "private"servers lol
---
The moldy helmets were not the power armour edition helmets. They were a different helmet made by GameStop.

---
Que the downvotes , and hate mail 😂
---
How dare to have fun and support this 🤣
---
Xbox console here... I took screenshots of all my scrap, no changes at all going between world modes and I went into all 3, runs totally smooth. 
---
Only non issue is that friends can join anytime they want without invites. I don’t care since my friends are actual friends but many accept random invites could see them on their server.
---
Because it’s basically free and not epic games and it still supports the developer
---
Loving it way more than I thought I would and I had pretty high (realistic) hopes going in. My wife was more of a skeptic and even she was feeling pretty good about it last night while we were playing.
---
I hoped they didn't make the private servers tied to a subscription service.  Or that they keep using the community as an excuse to break their promises.
---
Recycled worlds xD so now we know what happens when all players leave a server, it gets shipped as is to a private world. Enjoy!
---
Otherwise upvoted, is sad.
---
And storing infinite scap and thus having more space to store your weapons instead of a very limited amount is not in any way an advatage ?
---
Bethesda must be so glad their customers think like that coz they can sell you anything.
---
Also the game has had almost now new content added. But a shit ton of paid content.
---
Also charing money for basic QOL is almost as bad if not worse then straight up p2w.
---
Like "Hey if you don't want your experience to be an absolute nightmare give us more fucking money"
---
I get this entirely, but after all that... I'm the kind of person who pays for no commercials for Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, even CBS (certain seasons) because it keeps my sanity. I'm the person who buys my kid robux instead of toys (if she asks) on top of her builder club subscription. I'm the consumer who will buy skins because it makes me happy. I don't think I'm alone.
---
At the end of the day, everything out there, especially entertainment, is for money making. Everything. There are very few philanthropic companies in our world, and Bethesda, with all their excuses and semantic skirting, is no different.
---
Maybe I'm just accepting the inevitable more than most, but I'm certainly having a hellova time in the game again :) I can't wait for NPCs! Then I'm lone wandering it :)
---
Care to share the press release?
---
Bought first and haven't used the private server yet, however it seemed last night that the public servers were running smooth as silk.
---
3 SBQs, no lag at all during the fights, one violent night, a couple uranium fevers, several arkos and a buttload of other events, they seem to pop alot more.
---
Personally I think they must have upgraded the servers on the back end, which would also explain why they can support unlimited scrap now as well.
---
\*slow claps\*
---
and this is the reason more and more single player games are getting my attention
---
If you want to be salty because players can pay for unlimited junk stash space please do so. I get it you want something they now have. You don't want to manage your stash. It's called envy not P2W.
---
Don't act like it effects PvP. You seriously don't need much junk to repair your weapons or craft items. You don't need junk to PvP in fact you don't need more than 50 of each junk type with a few exceptions. 
---
Junk is just junk you don't need that much of it.
---
Fair
---
Thank you, this is amazing
---
if they fix the 'scrapbox deletes everything in it'-bug you could farm endlessly for the month and have huge amounts of scrap for crafting everything afterwards
---
I’m thinking limits to 8 players is huge factor. We launched a nuke and only had 5 people in game. Ran smooth all night!
---
Nothing. You can click on it, but not deposit anything (it shows an error unless you’re also a subscriber).
---
Thanks! My wallet is fine lol we compromise :)
---
Go play something else kid, this is clearly effecting you.
---
I want a fucking refund
---
Some marketing asswipe at BGS probably convinced themselves that this would actually take some hotness OFF of outer worlds release.
---
Dude. They literally just reduced the weight of bobble heads and magazines so you can display more.
---
&gt;But what's absurd is to see another post about how something you've never tried is shit
---
what havent i tried? perhaps i missed something in the inside the vault or the the countless posts about this. are there exclusive legendaries that i couldnt farm from the public servers? are there private server exlusive events or raids? is there anything actually new added into the game that i havent already done yet?
---
if bitching and internet salt are so taxing on you, why are you anywhere even remotely close to the internet? that's kinda what the internet is... also if you're so desperate to throw away $100/yr for nothing in return, i'd be more than happy to take your money. Actually wait... i see a business opportunity here. If anyone wants to pay me $100/year, i'll stop salting your internet.
---
People are negging the post unfortunately, but it's a pretty smart move to disguise PTW tbh.
---
Sounds like you're not getting a fresh world, but rather it's cordoning off empty ones for private use. That's... Technically private, but a lazy way to do it. I was under the impression (along with probably most everyone) that it'd be a fresh instance (or at least a REfreshed one).
---
Not as much. Whenever a deal like that is made it favors the distributor over the developer. I mean sure it's a good deal for the developer because their player numbers go up but they make less than if the developer had sold that many copies of their game. Also the fact that all of these posts are saying the same thing means that they're coming from the same source. Is there a discord server we can join that has a pinned message of what you guys are supposed to shill?
---
b-b-b-b-b-b-b-but epic bad
---
Well, he does say all the post launch stuff. And the link I replied to has one that can't really be spinned another way.
---
boi i only need one exlusive for premium members only and those freebiebois with bad self esteem will crawl back to their hole and uninstall game... poor lil cpu-resource thieves...
---
It's in Inside The Vault.

&gt;Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.
---
Since you cannot read obviously, I shall repeat.
---
I said it gives convenience, but the level of convenience is trivial that they do not put up as real advantages.
---
They didn't shut it down, AFAIK. 
---
We just gave it the reddit hug.
---
this subreddit was the physical embodiment of sunk cost fallacy
---
I never said it was a good product, although the free game trial every week is a nice touch. I'm just pointing out that a lot of companies force you to use other launchers than steam.
---
That's because it just works bro.
---
I went to the landlocked lighthouse for the event, and found that both bobbleheads and both magazines were missing.
---
My heavy hates the unloading bug, but none of my others have encountered it.

My heavy still can't put the camo paint back on his combat armour. My other characters can do it, but not him. I never got a reply to my ticket months ago.
---
Why ask? They’ll just jump on the hate wagon on the next game.
---
Fuck the point. This site spews the same "hur dur don't buy this company's stuff" shit every day, every week, every year
---
You choose what you spend your money on, not someone else
---
I didn't miss the point, I ignored it because it's a shitty point
---
Weakest silver lining ever

why its the same as every other post on here just now

Nah that’s option 1 friend.

There goes the best cave for a camp in the game.  Q.q

The old adage “no matter how hot she is, someone out there is sick of her shit” has an internet-based corollary:
---
“No matter how much you enjoy something, there is someone out there eager to tell you how terrible that thing is, and how stupid you are for liking it.”
---
That's not fanboy talk. That's engineer's talk. There's a completely valid reason why storing 1000 pieces of wood is trivial and storing 1000 Handmades of various properties isn't. Sorry, but not everything done by Bethesda has evil reasons. And not everything that supports them is fanboyism. Bethesda cannot bend the rules of IT technology...
---
Yeah ok kid
---
Give it a few days and it'll settle down. This happened when the game came out. Lots came here to cry and moved on. Nothing new.
---
More upset with people begging for and supporting the downfall of good gaming
---
didn't we have one yesterday?
---
&gt;salty boy
---
Not at all, I honestly wanted to purchase the subscription if the servers were actual private but oh well.
---
I thought it was funny that there is a group of people saying that the subs are not P2W and then your post says that it is and that you're happy with it. I am confused.
---
Bethesda charges $100/year for private servers 
---
Loses player base to this and Outer worlds 
---
Public server population goes down dramatically and remaining hardcore population is on private servers  
---
Every server is now private server
---
That's just irony at that point. Now you're paying to make fun of the subscription
---
There also the creators of fallout 1 and 2
---
And miss the World Series? Nuh-uh. Not gonna happen.
---
Destiny 2 is doing pretty great right now. Hundreds of hours of content for f2p players, the cash shop is almost completely limited to cosmetics, definitely nothing p2w or game breaking.
---
Oh look, they finally brought the Karma system back...
---
1-3 are invalid. You said past few months. The creation club debacle is several years old, this game was released nearly a year ago and their games have been buggy as fuck for as long as I can remember.
---
If you take all of the junk from your stash, and put it into an unlimited stash, then you can put stuff from your inventory into the stash, therefor reducing your carry weight. Wow. 2+2=4.
---
You have about 10 minutes to rejoin the server before anyone gets kicked out.
---
The articles are amazing.
---
ESO is a stable high quality game and you actually get a lot for the price.
---
If they hadn't burned all the goodwill and then some with thier handling of this game it wouldn't be an issue
---
If 100 a year breaks your bank then it’s time to be real with yourself. You need a second job. Or if you’re on a fixed income that’s tough, my heart goes out to you. You should be happy though that you’re fixed income dilemma is over a video game and not what canned dog food you’re buying to eat three times a day from the grocery store (real things I saw old folks do who were on s.s. while working at jewel). If you’re a kid and can’t work then it’s time to do your chores and listen to your guardians. The holidays are coming soon. If your folks bought 76 for you then they could probably swing the Hundo for the add on. 
---
We all know what time it is for most people complaining about money here. 
---
You’re a troll.
---
Oct 24th, 7pm eastern. Or try altering your localization.
---
No, sorry. But unless you can show it then all it is, is talk. And no I'm not defending Bethesda, just the supposed movement, doesn't mean much as all it is, is a small number talking and seemingly talking for others.
---
Basicly until theres actual proof should stop talking for others and just focus on talking for yourself.
---
Wastelanders will probably bring a lot of people back, if only for a few months. I quit after about 3 months due to lack of interest and I'm pretty excited to finally see NPCs in game.  
---
I get the feeling itll be a bit too late though.
---
TSM\_BJERG. I don't have a mic; I hope that's okay.
---
That’s all for private world though. That’s not for adventure mode.
---
&gt; but already took falloutfirst.com down.
---
Tell me how Bethesda was able to take down this website and how this isn't just a website crashing under the volume of traffic.
---
What, and then rob people of their joy to return at some time in the future to find those items nerfed into uselessness? No way.
---
So it seems it may really be triggered by people force quitting the game or server. I would be very careful about crashes as well, If you have any valuable junk in your scrap box it may be  smart to move it back to your normal stash and then use the scrap box as overflow.
---
Good riddance lmao
---
And that makes it ok?
---
Its cool man ill ad you right now
---
He thinks it's workshop limit not weight related.
---
Maybe. That would make sense. I’ve only used my own and wouldn’t use another players.
---
I'm not talking about the servers themselves. I'm talking about the features those servers are adding. 
---
&gt;Scrap is easier to store then the large items, Scrap doesn’t weigh very much and is used all the time.
---
Even more reason for something we could do just fine in previous games to not be stuck behind a pay wall. Yet here we are.
---
As for grinding for atoms, those who don't have all the time in the world to play the game don't want to spend what little time they do have grinding for atoms. I don't play Fallout 76 because I wanted to grind for atoms. I play Fallout 76 because I want to play the game. Even with atoms adding over time, stuff in the Atom Shop gets vaulted and doesn't always come back. I have yet to see anything get vaulted in the Creation Club besides bundle deals for items you can still buy seperately when the bundle deal goes away.
---
More like, stop buying FO76 stuff. Everything else is great, this is the *first* major fuck up
---
They did not say **all** added features would be free, regardless of your "feels" about the statement. 
---
Have you, or have you not, already received additional content at no cost beyond the initial purchase price? Is there already future content you will receive, at no additional cost?
---
If the answer to either of those questions, is "yes", then you should be thanking us, not complaining. If you make better wallet decisions, maybe you too could afford the $100 annual fee.
---
Mine worked just fine and it has 500 scrap.
---
First move I've seen from them in a while that shows they may actually have a plan to keep this thing breathing.  I am encouraged by the number of people clearly using the service despite what the people trolling this sub want to believe.
---
I wish pathetic vermin like you weren't so common.
---
I'm mad at Bethesda for this subscription crap, but what's even more maddening is rabid crowd who uses any excuse to get outraged. You're technical explanation why STASH limit and SCRAP limit is a completely different thing is correct. Yet it doesn't fit the narrative so you get downvoted...
---
Honestly I can't even force myself into playing even for the dailies/weekly challenges. On my other burn-out period I used to login and do this for 30 minutes to an hour a day. Somehow this patch made me realize that the most added things to the game are related to Atom shop or Nuclear winter. Even though I have stuff to do in the game and had for 850 hours so far, I can't bring myself to play. Also looking at the bug roundup from u/Aten-Ra , I don't want to discover and report zombie bugs once again.  
---
This is my honest opinion.
---
Still doesn't answer the question of where you got the idea to post about game pass my guy, I wanna know where your group meetup is lol. It definitely doesn't seem like a grassroots campaign, seems pretty organized
---
I'm a stealth sniper so Perception helps a bit, but I'd take Agility if I could get it.
---
Useless even though they sold well and you dont have to constantly look for screws but yeah useless.
---
Exactly. Infinite junk equals infinite ammo. Infinite ammo is a powerful advantage in trading.
---
Those in power love to divide those with less power, even down the the most seemingly powerless unit of the individual. However, it is together we are strong.
---
I'll take porn. Don't make my games for console plz
---
Good. Its the single player game you wished fallout76 would be. "Haven't played in months" but still wants to come back and get outraged over a game you dont play. Go QQ in the outer world subreddit next time 😂
---
It'll be a miracle that these babies actually go through with their threats.
---
Eso+ is the exact same thing. (1500 crowns a month, for $15, and unlimited stash storage) all they have a cosmetic item shop and loot boxes. So instead of writing (probably a fake post) for upvotes why don’t u get your head out of the sand and look at other games and shit on them for having more expensive deals or less content. Cause dude I bet your 15 years old that pays $9 a month for his fucking Xbox Minecraft server
---
Already have the annual pass for D2... after this I might be jumping back in
---
Aight, thanks.
---
Yep can confirm this. I don't have FO1st but I'm in a fb group with a few people who have it and I joined a server with a few. Pretty quickly the owner started culling their friends because people were just joining willy nilly. 
---
We also started a fresh server, nuked whitesprings and found there were dead ghouls everywhere before any of us had a chance to do anything. Not sure about the loot box as I don't have access, but I wouldn't be surprised if one of them loses their stuff. This is such a disappointing game!
---
No that was patch note
---
Ok im groovyguy
---
It's usually on Thursday. And no we didn't have one yet. I am curious about the ITV.
---
Most people who are spending their time complaining about this likely won't get married for a longgg time. Too much immaturity to deal with.
---
You just summed up the Pokemon fandom right now too.
---
The new Switch games are scummy as fuck (Bethesda level Glitches, Bad FPS, Flat out lying to us about needing new animations yet reusing the ones from the past games, The fact that they are charging $20 more for less content, ect...) yet people are defending them with their last breath.
---
This is how we get these shit games/products. Anthem, 76, Sword/Shield, CoD, ect... all happens because they know they have a fanbase that will buy literal Shit if their favorite property is slapped on it.
---
you sound like butthurt
---
How about unlimited scrap stash behind a paywall? After saying they could not do that cause of server stability? You cant defend any of this
---
No practical way to repair your guns without repair kits? That’s just simply not true.
---
Until the scrap box bugs and you lose all of it lmfao
---
By real advantage, do you mean no substantial advantage, or literally no advantage?
---
Well im still begging them for ammo converter
---
Keep in mind pc gamers are in the minority of players, people that mod pc games are and even smaller minority of that minority, they're just very vocal and over represented on Reddit.
---
Sweet, added.
---
Can you join me
---
&gt;forgot to secure the fallout first domain website
---
Why would they even need another website? Bethesda are assholes, not stupid. If they were gonna make a whole website *just* for a fallout 76 subscription service they woulda had that ready
---
Agreed. A majority of people could care less about this, it's only the handful that take to the Reddit forums that we see (and that is a small percentage).
---
I wasn't trying to suggest you were poor. I won't pay for the sub either. Why someone would pay more than the cost of a year of PS Plus or X-Box Live for this is beyond me.
---
Enjoy the Outer Worlds. It looks good but it's a short game. I plan on getting it when it drops in price. I just got BL3 so I'll be playing that not because of Fallout 1st but because I need a break from this game. It's become to grindy and the servers are too unstable lately.
---
Oh I was short on cash this month from all the games coming out and saw a game pass advertisement for it lol. I mean I can come up with a cooler story like me and my reddit gang have a hidden group that shills out for a Microsoft sponsorship and I get payed by upvotes.
---
A dollar!!! Damn I'll totally throw a dollar away to try some new games. Thanks for the PSA
---
I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to wear that NCR costume. 
---
Likewise l, if I had no self-respect and still played the game, I would look down on others and be embarrassed for them if they were wearing it.
---
Instead of looking like an NCR Ranger, you look like a brain dead whale.
---
I moved my scrap into my own box. Totally solo in the world. Still lost everything
---
You're welcome! I'm enjoying the new premium membership.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Don't mind me just leaving well deserved likes.
---
I'll agree to disagree here:
---
1. Come on, how hard is it to level profs to 50? Only Jewelcrafting is somewhat annoying, but once you do it - you don't need it anymore. There's nothing P2W about it.
---
2. Ambrosias are a thing - more effective as well.
---
3. DLCs is a whole different animal - I'll somewhat agree, but it's paid content literally in every game, and having access to that many DLCs for a sub is not a bad deal.
---
4. All available in game, irrelevant imho.
---
5. Again - available in game.
---
Even the crown exclusive things like banker and merchant are limited in functionality. 
---
So besides DLCs, all these things are Pay4Convenience, and in regards to consumables - you have better options available in game, than in store. I can't go into crown store and straight up buy Perfected sets or something, right? Basically, if we compare a person with 10k crowns and a person with 3.5mil gold (1:350 is the average conversion rate on EU), the latter will have a HUGE advantage in what they can do to improve their character - consumables, sets, etc. And 3.5mil gold is not an outrageous amount of gold by no means - I usually do 800k-1mil weekly in sales only, most of which comes from trader flipping.
---
You could argue, that person with 10k crowns can sell them for gold, but that's another hoop they'll need to do, and frankly it'll probably be much cheaper to buy gold from chinese farmers, but in this case any online game ever can be P2W. 
---
So in a nutshell - I fully agree, that ESO is stronk on pay for convenience, but P2W? Nah. Neither is 76 - there's nothing that gives you direct advantage over other players in the sub. Difference is - ESO knows what it is and where it's headed, 76 doesn't. And from the state of both games, I don't think 76 deserves a sub model, not until it's un-utter-messed properly.
---
i'm probably what some people would think of as a fanboy (based on the fact that i still enjoy playing the game), and i definitely wouldn't defend this shit.
---
Let me know if you still need help. I would gladly join for that.
---
It’s a product that was purchased for money. Calling out people who’s job it is to interact with the public is what anyone would do? Look at the subreddit every post is gilded and thousands of updoots. Yea we get it, it’s not important to you. Go away.
---
Guys you know if this has you so upset then maybe you should like dunno......finally take a shower and shave.  Maybe go out for TENDIES and Hunny mussy sauce and a cold dewie.  Heck go play catch with Tyrone.
---
I’m really worried about you fam.
---
And the first month is just a dollar
---
I was wondering if they were truly guaranteed or not... this is the first time people would be able to start a fresh server to test this. It's possible that only x amount of loot spawns (due to resource limitations) or that whether it spawns at all is random. Many unanswered questions here.
---
Todd doesn't even work on FO76..
---
You can criticize anything all you want, but if at the end of the day it doesn't affect you in any way, what was the point of wasting your time getting worked up over something that never mattered. You don't need unlimited scrap in this game. You've played the game for a year without unlimited scrap. Why get mad that some lazy people can pay for something you've so far never needed. This is not a competitive game anymore.
---
I get being disappointed that the private worlds are pay-only, and if you really wanted private worlds, then that's fine. But the idea that they could give you some feature you've so far never needed for free, a feature nobody actually needs to enjoy the game, and the fact that they don't give it to you for free is not a problem. You don't need it, and in reality, you shouldn't want it. It makes you lazier in the game. It makes the survival aspects of gathering resources and having to choose what to keep and what to ignore/sell/dump much more interesting.
---
This is pathetic. So instead of getting a fresh world, we get a re used server with dead npcs and already looted areas?
---
Having everything spawning as new would be the sole reason I would even consider buying a private server ffs...
---
I'd donate my left nut to attend the meetings where this kind of shit was decided. Must've been really some outer worldy shit to witness.
---
It was 5 minutes then a 20 minute countdown started for us last night
---
But if i search for everything myself, it cuts down on my interactions with others.
---
I also am loving my scrap and tent. I work and sometimes do things other than play video games. I know I spend more on atoms than the cost of private servers. it works for me.
---
Did you see the guys post below? Force closing while changing from public to private makes the scrap vanish. I did this too, went to log into public but changed my mind and force closed it and restarted it on private. I’ve just tested it out and yep my scrap is gone.
---
there are variations been data mined. I would not be surprised to see an atom shop version. unless they really will just give color variations to members every month ....
---
Rip
---
Im pretty sure i saw your wife's post yesterday
---
So to a couple of the above comments, please enlighten me to what one "wins"???? Maybe I'm playing the game all wrong, but the end game isn't even available so to win by definition isn't possible since there's no conclusion.

I played on my Bros private server last night and it was fun, we had horde events to ourselves without some one-shotting douche ruining it.
---
And for the infinate stash...he still has to grind for it...so what if he had 10000 steel, he earned it. 
---
We both enjoyed the privacy but missed the player vendors. So I don't see the big deal (but understand financial strain which is why only my bro got it and let's me play on his for now) and we will probably continue to play both worlds.
---
Becuase they need too be!!!!
---
It is actually stated in the article or patch notes that the private worlds are not persistent, that feature is coming only at a later time. It could still have been possible to reboot them every time a player starts a new instance, though. If not doing that is not just laziness, then maybe there is a technical reason (like it would make the load time much longer), or it would be too overpowered to be able to "server hop" private worlds and get guaranteed fresh spawns every time.
---
If they actually did, any of the rabid complainers on here, who *actually* play the game would be lambasted continually by the insult bot. So, no.
---
I never said that, you should just hold proper expectations based on their past. You wouldn't expect Hitler to go around giving out free Torah and celebrating hanukah would you?
---
I feel the same way. If $60 is a lot of money for someone then maybe it should be considered to be spent more wisely, reviews read, wait until after it releases.  "Buyer beware" is a still a thing.
---
I've enjoyed the game and continue to :) I'm still finding all kinds of neat things. If you're not someone that likes to explore every nook and cranny you aren't going to get much out of any fallout game. There's thoughtful detail and all kinds of cool Easter eggs and that's what I like about Fallout. I'm not playing because it's the best game, has the best story or any of that. Even before Fallout I liked post-apoc setting, I liked the atomic 50s aesthetic. My husband (then boyfriend) played 1 and 2 and introduced me to 3 when it came out and I looooved it. I've since gone back and played 1 &amp; 2 but not to successful completion yet.
---
I personally hadn't encountered any glitches at all in the beginning and neither did any of the people I played with (I am very social -in the game- and would just team with randos :) ). I bought the game and played it since release save for Feb and April when I had some other shit come up that pulled me away from gaming. 
---
Just recently I've started having power armor glitches, but I rarely wear it anyway because I got some awesome mutations (with some awful negatives, power armor couldn't negate -12 strength lmao).  Ive only recently been able to wear it and have it be useful for carry weight. I have birdbones, marsupial and strange in numbers so I can pretty much cliff dive and be okay without power armor. I really hate the friends list glitch and would like that to get fixed because, like I said, I'm social in game and I want to add people I have fun with. Besides that everything else I find barely annoying. Hear the power armor glitch is getting fixed or has been...I don't keep up cuz it doesn't really impact my game play. If anything I find NW more buggy than adventure, me and teammates have gotten stuck in open spaces before :/
---
Nah man, if you'll read my post history you'll seen actually did but it for one month and then refunded by still have access. There was also another post on here about this
---
We will hopefully survive the loss and carry on without you, even it will be hard. :'(
---
People will still blame him and Bethesda Maryland for it.
---
Yeah that seems to be the trigger. Initial reports were using someone else box/camp, or how you scrapped items but force closing and most likely crashes will cause this as well. I will hopefully have my stuff when I get online and will need to re-bulk it all and put it back into my stash until this is fixed. The scrap box should strictly be used as overflow for now if at all. They need a hotfix patch on this fast especially since its for people they are trying to get to subscribe and pay for this. Might be a rather fast fix since this will hurt the bottom dollar if people demand refunds or don't  renew/cancel.
---
The scrap box will eat your junk so you have 0 weight plus 0 junk lol.
---
I took munitions factory yesterday and when it came time to defend it I heard a scorch beast and was like..  maybe itll be legendary. Turned out to be two of them a 1* and a 2*.
---
I don’t feel sorry.
---
For the vast majority I doubt server size is the main issue. Back when I played this every day I only had a handful of friends that played this. As you can imagine none play it anymore. I think the most people would have trouble filling a 8 person lobby. The thing everyone should be worried about is if this goes over well you can expect more p2w features down the road until it becomes 2 separate games. A crappy grindfest for those who don't want to spend extra on the game, and basically what we all wanted from the start for the p2w players. They already made the game more grindy by changing perkcards and nerfing drop rates of certain things, later to add "convenience items" to the atom shop. There wasn't enough outrage so here we are with the subscription model and more p2w features. It's not about not being able to afford it, and more about not wanting to be taken advantage of. Whenever they make changes to the game that make it more grindy then implement time savers under the guise of us wanting it they are testing us to see how far they can take it.
---
Not bugs, feature.
---
Jokes aside thats pretty telling of Bethesda but at this point are we surprised they dont work as intended at launch?
---
Absolutely, I'm happy to be a lab rat for it. Someone's gonna try it first, I'm okay being that person lol I've got no unreasonable expectations, it's Bethesda, but for now I'll keep y'all informed as I can with as little bias as possible.
---
Unless your over encumbered already it doesn’t slow anything so this is a pointless conversation. If you’re walking around 5 pounds from max weight that’s your fault.
---
well obviously when the game freeze lags the moment i encounter another person in NW, its the PR departments fault.  thats what they get for existing!
---
So they are trying to make us into Appalachian raiders?
---
I stopped playing back in November, I wanted my 16x detail and the gameplay you would expect from a AAA company
---
No skin off my back I have a good job.  What I paid for one month is usually what I pay for lunch each day.
---
 I just skip lunch once a month now.
---
 Keep acting like a little child. See where that gets you.
---
? They'll probably mention none of these things, also these are issues for the Reddit mods. They're nice people with a tough job, they don't make decisions about the game.
---
cool! thanks for taking the time to comment -
---
I haven't read the patch notes yet so my assumptions are my own oopsie. I see what you're saying about server load and potential issues, but it's still something they could've been more transparent about.
---
It's not just decent, it is frigging awesome. I am playing it right now. Taking a food break, so posting here for the time being.
---
This^. This game is a looter shooter. There are no lasting choices, no real consequences for actions. The amount of role play is identical to me going into Halo and role playing as Master Chief. We just exist. Our choices mean nothing. The only role playing to be had is between players which a very few people have done
---
I finished the quest.
---
Yeah but I'd much prefer to have a good game than be right. I can only imagine how this will affect upcoming Bethesda games..
---
Heh. I met one too last night. Just me and him on his 'private' server. I claimed his workshop. I then attacked him right after he had claimed the munitions factory. He left shortly thereafter and I had the server to myself. Well, for 20 minutes anyway.
---
Agree so much outrage from this Reddit
---
Yep came back to check when wastelanders was dropping, noticed its been pushed to 2020 so they could release a subscription model.
---
also a few months is literally nothing if you are not twelve years old.
---
Why would i play the game when i'm busy with work and no new content has been added?
---
I got 600 hours in the game, there is literally nothing for me to do.
---
But im a huge fan of fallout and i just voiced my opinion on the subject.
---
You on the other hand just mock me which tells me you are really insecure.
---
Didnt play them, they were before my time i think. 1998 here.
---
I'm feeling these numbers are being looked at wrong. If you raise the rarity of common items, but the bot is still supposed to give off a set amount of items every hour, then this is a buff and not a nerf. Which corresponds to the comment mentioning they saw ultracite in the collectron for the first time ever after the patch
---
Where were you when repair kits were released?
---
Yes put it in your normal stash ASAP. I know it will be a quick fix as it’s literally not even been 24 hours before it’s gone wrong. The amount of stick they’re getting already, they can’t afford something like this.
---
Your argument no sense. If you have that much shit on you its your own fault. Theres no reason anyone has to carry so much shit theyre overencumbered, which if you could read, i already said. The scrap box is not pay to win, you just need to not be stupid, which is seemingly what everybody else commenting already knows. End of discussion, cause youre baiting at this point.
---
Do you need to revive me? I can go down.
---
Care to give some actual numbers? You seem pretty well informed, I am curious.
---
Yes it does indeed. MTX itself is a garbage model that was implemented in response to the last backlash of "I don't want to pay" wave of gamers. 
---
I'm going to be cut and dry aka brutally honest here when it comes to business: They don't care about bringing people back. They care about the bottom line and nothing more. Somebody did an analysis and determined that there is a large enough portion of the player base willing to use a subscription service and put their results together in a pretty little chart that was convincing enough for executives to green light. As long as somebody in marketing can convince executives that there is a probability of profit they will keep this thing going. 
---
I have no problem with subscription services when I enjoy what I am paying for. I have enjoyed this game since I started playing it, and continue to do so now. No amount of insults or Reddit down votes is going to change that. Those who do not enjoy the game are only causing themselves further frustration by believing that they are entitled to have Bethesda hand deliver "My Ideal Fallout" to them.
---
Shame
---
luckily i picked up Borderlands over the weekend.  so im not quite as crushed as i could have been
---
damn you brotherhood of steel
---
Reddit loves to think they're the majority of the playerbase when in fact they're just a small screeching minority
---
&gt;spends $10,000 in the atom shop
---
&gt;”durrr why does Bethesda have microtransactions in their games?”
---
Yeah legally, no one can tell you what to do with your money. But if you spend your money like an idiot, don’t be surprised to be called an idiot
---
It's more like I don't want to waste my time.  I've been through this with other games.  Even if I enjoy a game's mechanics, P2W ruins playing the game.  You start realizing you can grind for something for 100 hours or pay money and cut that time in half.  It becomes demotivating and less and less enjoyable.  It becomes a time and money sink without any of the feel good I enjoy about video games.  
---
Again, I'm not bashing people who don't feel this way about P2W games, but the problem here is they sold the game on the pretense that it wouldn't be P2W.  It's the bait and switch that people are upset about.
---
like milk
---
What are talking about? This sub complains about everything for the first week and then forgets they were angry and moves on. This has happened like 9 times now.
---
After a pack of legendary scorchbeasts burned down my camp (again) I tried to kill them, only for them to fly away at top speed. Of course after I fast traveled all their corpses were all sitting ontop of me, and kept following me everywhere I went.
---
u/DCDeacon
---
Not even undeserved money from their herd of human toilets can fix their incompetence, wow.
---
and you are a piece of trash for not having just a bit of empathy
---
I fucking hate this update, but everyone is free to use their money as they see fit
---
Thank you for your service, I was going buy a one month sub just so I can farm a lot of scrap but I guess I will pass.
---
Because you either subscribe to a game or help the oceans right? /s
---
I enjoyed the game at launch and still enjoy it now, and the game is hugely improved since launch
---
So a service which is completely optional and has no true effect on your game whatsoever has killed the game for you?
---
Such a drama queen
---
Right and your not united thats the problem, you think you are but at the core most are all talk no action. Otherwise EA and activision/Blizzard would be in worst shape than they are. Thats the thing with the angry crowds, they never are united, they always fall apart. 
---
Because they always fizzle which is the problem. Because they are easy to manipulate etc. The Deluded are those that play the short game.
---
you sound like a tard.
---
Uh...Outer Worlds is sci fi and space. Fucking dumb.
---
that must be really hard for you
---
Doubtful she doesn't post anything nice on here. She likes to pour gas on fires because she is a witch.
---
I am not even sorry for them. People who pay for this subscription asked to be screwed over.
---
I guess but for the people that don’t have 6 hours a day to grind a game it’s a great opportunity to catch up to those that do.
---
This is the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Just because you have put a bunch of time into it, doesn't mean you should put more time into it.
---
You need an option that says ‘apparently’.
---
You aren't against it, you're supporting it. Braindead.
---
PrIvAtE sErVeRs ArE cOnTeNt
---
Lollll. Ok Todd.
---
But this isn't pay2win. All the white knights told me all of these are utility items that you don't need and the cash shop is all optional.
---
I know you dont care because you bought it Lol the fact that I have to pay 13 dollars a month to have UNLIMITED scrap space(essentially 2 separate stash containers) when originally they lied and said they cant do that because of server stability. And yes now since this update YOU have more stash space than me and only because you played more money. That's called pay to win and it's ridiculous. You borderline delusional in my opinion for not acknowledging this. You must be the "whale" I hear about in games like this. Its sad
---
Agree o don't have the funds to buy it but I have friends who have bought it and I reaped the Benefits of a private sever. Don't know why everyone is bitching since the membership is basically the 10 doller atom bundle.
---
Nah, not selling. It's going to be a $4.99/month subscription add on option.
---
Wow. That is a massive nerf.
---
dang!!! F\*\*\* bugthesda!!!!
---
Sadly, no corpse from my kill at all :')
---
exciting read
---
thats the real problem in these scenarios.  once a player reaches the point where they arent going to spend *more* money, the studio stops giving a shit about them entirely.  no one who is complaining is going to be listened to or even acknowledged, because they are the people who are using up the servers for no gain. 
---
If you already payed for the game, and arent willing to pay for atoms or for premium, then Beth *WANTS* you to quit.  best case is you'll sell your game or give it to someone else and maybe they will buy atoms/premium.
---
Plenty of people are playing, reddit just loves pretending to be the super majority rather than the minority they are
---
Wow you are right!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdofmoYcJNE
---
If you have fallout 76 on pc can I have your stuff?
---
Honestly waiting is the best, not to mention someone said the scrapbox is bugged so when they switched over to a public server they lost 400lbs of scrap.
---
Having a little trouble hearing them over my robot dance
---
i think hes trying to imply that you guys are more fond of making dramatic speeches then you are about coherent politics
---
Yeah me too. I just came back a week or so ago. I enjoyed the Pioneer scout stuff, kind of. The Possum badges have been a bit of a grind and some are not even quite possible without certain recipes etc. I got the backpack, robot, fridge, booblehead stand, magazine rack, and waster stuff from the Atom Store, etc. Everything that was new pretty much. I had an idea to grind for the new PA from the Vault 94 raid, if I could manage to solo it, but I guess I've had enough of FO76 again now, as the levelling to move points around and get new perks for a new build from melee to rifles is a bit long and boring. I have just been logging in to get dailies for the possum badges which is slow going. I think I have had enough of Reddit now I have expressed myself about this recent issue that will probably be the final nail in the coffin for me playing FO76.
---
Paying for features and skins that should be free in game, then saying I'm acting like a child. At least you can look cool in your ranger armour! And everyone else can see how gullable you are so it's a win win I guess.
---
No issues for me at this point.
---
I think naming the shredding trash bin a "scrap box" was very misleading, but it clearly does hold all your s̶crap.
---
I'm on PS4, and no, you can't have my stuff.
---
You have to be friends to join each others worlds to trade....
---
I suspect that they collectively killed themselves... There is no way they can justify or defend the shit that is going on. What do you want them to say?
---
How the fuck do you mean a "fake post". I used to go splits 8 ways on a realm for MC. I spent literal cents a month to play online with friends on a customizable map that was for a game I'd spent 15 bucks on.
---
This is NOTHING alike. It's not even like ESO. At least eso offered a full working game before doing this and didn't have P2W aspects.
---
You’re the salty one
---
Your masterful counter argument has left me speechless and without rebuttal, I guess you win
---
Some guy posted on my post and it’s when you force close out of one server to the other. I tested it and he’s 100% right. So don’t force close your game if you want to swap worlds.
---
No, they're perfectly right. It was a huge stress on the servers when there were a lot of players. Now they can do it for the dozen of players that's gonna buy it
---
I don't even play this, you lost me ages ago when you streamlined elder scrolls and made the eye pleasing but story wise simpleton skyrim, but holy shit that is an unattractive update list. It makes me feel like I *was* a player and got disgusted. You are completely out of touch but I'm sure you know and just want kids signing up with their dad's credit cards, gl with that.
---
Are you on PC BTW? If you are and I have my mats still tonight I can help you out and give you some to get you going again and I have flux as well if you are a mutation build and need it for serum.
---
Most people were gonna play the TOW anyway. It's a Fallout-like made by Obsidian. Acting like this one controversy out of the last two dozen is the the actual tipping point that pushed people to move to new game is absurd.
---
TOW is literally a brand new "Fallout" game. Of course everyone is gonna just ship for a couple weeks. Why wouldn't people jump over to play it? Regardless of any current controversy.
---
ESO as well. Left both WoW and 76 for it.
---
Very happy with the game.
---
Nothing in the thing is that useful I just hate the idea I don’t hate what I’m missing
---
Aged turds make excellent fire starters. And turds generate fuel. Turds are totally useful bro. Why does everyone need to make a negative turd metaphor?
---
I would like for you to explain how I'm "winning" by having more space for scrap. That's a tired argument used on here quite a lot, that never has any basis in fact behind it.
---
That's not even getting into the fact I have a mule account, which already gave me unlimited scrap storage.
---
The Scrapbox?
---
Or they are getting ready to go F2P
---
Ironic how they want free stuff but will pay for stuff that should be free 😂
---
Sucks to suck.
---
The game literally says when trying to display a magazine or bobblehead: 
---
"Workshop buildlimit exceeded."
---
Lol next time don't do it with a tesla. I've had that happen before
---
Maybe that's the difference between you and I. I don't give 2 fuks what people think of me. 
---
I enjoy the game and have fun while I play it, that's all that matters to me.  I prefer a monthly subscription on MMOs rather than micro transactions so it's fine with me.
---
&gt; I guess but for the people that don’t have 6 hours a day to grind a game it’s a great opportunity to catch up to those that do. 
---
You just explained to yourself how it's pay to win.  I'm not trying to bash you.  If a P2W subscription doesn't hurt your enjoyment of the game, more power to you.  But just don't act like other people shouldn't be allowed to be upset by it.  To each there own.
---
When they say build area, I think they mean the circle and not buildable areas
---
How the fuck can Bethesda shut a private website down? It doesn’t work that way
---
How fucking DARE you try and talk about anything other than your outrage. SHAME ON YOU.  
---
lol jk obviously, congratz!
---
See you in a few months.  Let us know how the outer worlds are.
---
There is a mod on pc to put Todd’s face on the scorched model. It’s 100% free
---
You practically deserve that for being such a fucking drone
---
You acknowledge it's shitty and proceed to feed into it, are you dense? How about not giving them money in the first place and maybe, just maybe if enough of the other drones like you actually close your wallet they'll start making changes that aren't based around creating inconveniences for you to buy your way around?
---
Narrowing it down quite a lot there. Why does it have to be AAA (which in this case just means they had a bigger budget to produce a shittier product than good indie games, so who cares?) or a "franchise", these things don't make a game better.
---
It's not just bold, it's a clear indicator that Bethesda have completely lost the plot.
---
So there you go, whatever the other guy said about bobble head weight means nothing.
---
And that's great my workshop is full too, I didn't even try and out anything down yet. Fantastic.
---
Yes. ESO is a high quality product with tons upon tons upon tons of content. And ESO+ gives you much more, than a bottomless bag and 1650 currency a month, i.e. 20+ otherwise paid DLCs.
---
Someone bought Falloutfirst.com...
---
More interesting would be if those changes/features would carry over to normal adventure?
---
You pay for shit, you get shit. That's what you get for having no brain whatsoever
---
imagine bethesda fucking something up... imagine.... at this stage we should be MORE surprised if something apart from the atom shop worked properly. ;-)
---
Someone felt hit I guess
---
but you are tard
---
\^This, there is also a point there might be people who will just buy one month in order to get the outfit, the atoms and mostly try to farm junk items so they can be loaded when they go back to public but of course the scarpbox is bugged at the moment at least when you switch to a public server you loose your junk.
---
This is my new favorite website! I am in tears CTFU!!!😭😭😭😭
---
For a game that I was told was dead 8 months ago there's still a ton of people bitching about it online.
---
Aww thank you, that’s very kind of you. I’m on PS4 but I’ve spent the last hour farming and luckily player vendors sell plenty of junk. The flux I use to make serums to sell and I’m well stocked up so won’t need any for a while. It’s not ruined the game and I’m sure they will fix it pronto. But many thanks.
---
Lol!
---
Pete Hines = lying cunt
---
They manufactured the problem only to later on sell you the solution.
---
This is 100% intentional
---
You mean talk in a civil manner?  Have you read the nonsense vomited on this forum since yesterday?  
---
I wouldn’t talk to you either, and I don’t understand why you think they have to.
---
If this move has you that upset then I think you need to take a break.
---
It’s unhealthy
---
All g, my whole year has been like that.
---
This is not the game that I bought at full price. Promises were broken when utility items were added. Now that people twill pay a premium service so they can have an unlimited amount of ballistic fiber definitely have an unfair advantage. I was told that the game would not be pay-to-win and now it is. I want my money back . Gleekingswindler001
---
Probably not cause then they couldn’t do the money grabbing.
---
Forbes online is a joke. It’s not Forbes magazine and has little quality control. Articles are posted based on things some intern reads on Reddit or twitter lol.
---
I might not get it yet, but I probably will sometime soon.
---
You like mushrooms. They grow it turds. Turds are always getting bad mouthed.
---
I am not a HC player, but making P2W elements to the game sounds little like blackmailing and blackmailing sounds little like punishing people that have been very loyal to this game.
---
I have been elsewhere for sometime and just wanted to return, but this just doesn't lure me back.
---
The VAT inclusion is in the price already, that is why the SRP should not be affected by it but the WSP is. Believe me, those prices for EMEA are way off the charts. 
---
Here you have a product to compare:
---
UK Price:

---
It is actually quite hard to find something for 12,99 as usual pricing for this tier of product is 11,99.
---
saving me from a deal 13$ for 15$ worth of atoms plus scrap box and private world geeze I feel sooooooooooo mistreated 
---
go yell at starbucks if you want to talk about over priced crap.....
---
There's no point talking to deceptive manipulators, who lie for a living. The fact of the matter is, when one person who has it moves junk from their stash to the unlimited stash, that frees up a bunch of space, which can then be filled with items from the inventory, giving them enough space to sprint. Many people are overencumbered. Many people have inventory management issues. Some people have mule characters, and they transfer items to other character even. You can't lie top people who actually play the game. You hope you can deceive those reading, if they don't know the truth. Weapons, armor, chems and food are heavy, even with perks. Having unlimited stash is a direct effect on gameplay. FACT!
---
Turn on some national news and you'll get some perspective what's important in life and what's not.
---
I see nothing wrong here, it's exactly what Bethesda would say normally :)
---
It was worth the $13 sub just for the dance emotes, NCR ranger outfit and 1650 atoms
---
I completely agree, it's just empty bitching
---
Idk man just sounds like to much money for to little, but the extra atoms and server would be cool.
---
It’s true too isn’t it, to get the story, you need to play single player.  Only time I really listen to all the audio logs.
---
Oh, the addition of the scrap box has made it impossible for you to play the game
---
They would very likely be facing (more) lawsuits if they did that. They promised all forthcoming DLC would be free and sold the game on that promise.
---
Your comment was tad snarky and sarcastic. But hey, if you do decide to buy it, and I hope you do, let me know if you change your mind :) I’m also on XB1 and happy to run a silo together some time
---
The Outer Worlds circlejerk is so fucking annoying. "hurr durr i stop play 76 and go play outer worlds" Oh geez, I wonder what the story is! Obsidian created NV, an overrated Fallout, and apparently they are the absolute gods of the gaming industry that only pump out gold!
---
Because junk is more than half normal stash box space? That fact I would have way more space for stuff to sell and all that is I didn't have to pay 13 dollars. Well it all makes sense now you exploit the game normally it only makes sense you would buy into this brain dead option. I'm content, run along now. Your pay to win scrap box is deleting scrap as we speak.
---
Wait what... how are you being blackmailed? Lol. The only “maybe” p2w thing is the scrap box. I do have a problem with this being able to be used on public servers. I personally wouldn’t use one though. The game is already incredibly easy, getting rid of inventory management is pretty silly honestly.
---
I think it’s pay for convenience because really no one ever “wins” in this game it’s really never ending. Absolutely to each there own though.
---
I now understand why people needlessly have to declare sarcasm or jokes, its for people like you
---
Look man I really feel for that, losing progress in anything you like really sucks, but at the same time you kinda played yourself lol 
---
I'm not gonna try and backseat finance you and act like I control your money or whatever but I feel like with the cash you spent you could've really tried any other game.. I mean, hell, if you've got a win10 pc or an Xbox just buy the game pass. 5 bucks for a month to play whatever games they have on there. Outer worlds is on it in a few days and Gears 5 is still popping. Just anything besides fo76.
---
That company released the best fallout game and the most broken fallout game at launch.
---
"That's your fault"
---
"I have plenty of stash space"
---
"Just manage your inventory better"
---
All fucking strawman argument BS.
---
Glad to also see some others on the same page!
---
I just think what is done is done, go play the game with or without the pass! Just get back out there
---
Most likely about 2-4%
---
This is fucking great.
---
Angry people like you are much worse
---
"Players are not amused at the fact that they have now paid for the privilege of losing all of their materials..."  
---
I'm sorry, but you don't get to act surprised at this point when something in Fallout 76 is broken. That's been the story of the game from Day 1, and anyone who pays for this mess should think of it like this: "I'm choosing to donate my money to Bethesda with the hope that they'll make Starfield and Elder Scrolls just as busted, vapid, boring and exploitative as Fallout 76."
---
what happens if i already subscribed?
---
I was talking about MediEvil Remake😌
---
I guess that's a passive-aggresive way to make us know that those players don't care about this outrage. I'm mad at Bethesda myself, but people have gone too far by harassing the players who don't want to give up on Bethesda. It's their choice and they shouldn't get attacked for not siding with the loud crowd. What other play and buy for fun shouldn't be our concern. So I guess that those people just want to show that they won't get swayed...
---
This is why I always advocate for not attacking other gamers, even if they support the bad companies. When we attack a fellow gamer, we drive him away into the arms of the developers. When they cannot find safety for their hobby amongst other gamers, they'll find it at the companies. And the companies at least pretend that they care about them. That's why we should never harass people who play unpopular games or buy microtransactions. We should try to convince them. But in the end it's up to them how they spend their free time...
---
Wholesome! I appreciate constructive feedback!
---
Considering I have played the game, pretty sure I know what Im talking about and know how to spot baby rage.
---
Sounds like your typical freeloader/hypocrite 🤣
---
I can’t help myself! I must be logical!
---
Unless you've got a source from bethesda...this is still just speculation.
---
Again, 10,000 lbs and 1lb is the SAME in a database.
---
Oh yeah right, it is not like you are geting a unfair advantage for 100$.
---
No problem, yeah if I lost my junk I'll be hitting player vendors and farm whatever else I need. I have caps so I wont be ruined but it would be a setback and a huge time sink for what was lost.
---
Sorry if you find it not clear.
---
Since the convenience do not make a player superior, no advantage over other players.
---
But if you say that convenience is an advantage of the subscription, that's true, in a sense that the outfit is an advantage of this subscription.
---
Lmao!!!! Bugthesta gotcha again!!!!
---
Why oh why do you guys just trust these people?
---
Nah. There are so many united against this shit. If we all bought the next EA game they would see profits they never expected. See you can't quite quantify how many people are not buying your games, but believe me, it's a lot.
---
I'm pretty sure they'll have plenty of joy if sales are good.
---
👈😎👈 Right on the money, buddy.
---
Don't forget about time saver packs. Artificially extend the grind/tedium and sell us a solution so we don't to play your boring game as much.  Ubisoft loves that.
---
you make a fatal error YOU think its half baked YOUUUUU
---
99$ = around 14,000 atoms 
---
compared to fallout 1st = 19,800 atoms 
---
so I'm getting 25% more atoms + private world + tent + scrap box + ranger outfit -  Have you considered were basically getting everything else free no because you think your the center of the damn universe and have to cry cause no one else cares... welp I'm sorry I can count and thus realize its a good deal
---
Just because the atoms itself are more expensive doesn't mean its a great deal, lol.
---
Its not about being overpriced, but about the fact this game itself isn't even worth 13 bucks...
---
They couldn't crank up the stash limit right? Well if you pay they can, they literally shot themselfs in their feet with this.
---
I've continuesly defended this game, but this was the limit.
---
For the same money you can get most games-as-a-service subscriptions and yet bethesda lets you pay it for a few extra features in an already dead game...
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the private servers, but honestly, they should've went with peer-to-peer
---
One quarter portion.
---
Totally worth it and loving it. 
---
Don't you throw shame on me from your far corner of the anonymous internet. Come find me in game and battle it out in glorious PvP where we can pretend we determine the right and wrong of all things. Please?....I really just want some PvP. 
---
Sorry not sorry I chose to spend my money on something that I'm enjoying. I only wish that you were not shackled and bound in a manner that prevents you from parting ways.
---
The NCR mask does muffle the crying. And I put their salty tears in scrapbox, in my survival tent, with my 1650 atoms.
---
I buy ammo
---
MY "Scrap Box" has been fine so far across 3 characters, no lost scrap. It seems like what you did in a previous session carries over like in normal adventure.  So, if you just maxed out vendor 1,400 vendor caps or looted the Burrows it will take time to repopulate.  I'm happy and hey if you're not, that's life.  Some people pay for 5 star hotels and some stay at Motel 6.
---
I don't have exact numbers, but it has been months since it left the Top 40 most played games on Xbox.
---
But taking into account that CoD WWII, which is the number 38 on the list, has around 2000 concurrent players... I'd say things aren't looking good for FO76.
---
The scrapbox loosing your scrap would be an issue I would want a refund over - you are paying for an extra that does not work.
---
The other complaints are game mechanics and are working as they are supposed to. If I go to flatwoods and loot the gym for lead, then switch servers to another instance where noone else is in flatwoods, the server spawns world objects based on my interaction with them over the past 20 hours / 120 items and the gym is empty. We all know this, it's how we build our farming techniques. Why did they expect the private servers to act differently?
---
And yes, they said your friends can join you on your private world. They also said you can either unfriend them to permanently prevent this, or block them to prevent it for the current session. Personally I think it would be better to have an alert that a friend would like to joint, kinda like when someone wants to team up with you, but I'm not a developer for Bethesda and they didn't ask my opinion. And I could see everyone complaining about the permission system getting in their way during an event so I guess either way is gona have it's own problems.
---
Hey, the boycott is important! I for one am participating from 7:30-5:30 monday through friday!
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Have you played ESO since launch? The storytelling has been better than Skyrim since like the third DLC. By a long shot.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Everyone loves to become hyperbolic. Everybody was gonna switch over to TOW because it's basically a new "Fallout" game. Then they'll get their fix and jump back to 76 whenever it gets content they want to try out.
---
How can a domain be taken for a copyright claim?  
---
That'd be more of a trademark thing wouldn't it?
---
Right? Oh no!, I am paying a half hour of work each month? OH THE HUMANITY!
---
brb, buying more atoms
---
Had my camp there for like 6 months but moved when the camp vendor came out cuz people couldnt find the mouth of the cave.  Was thinking about moving back...oh well
---
I think it falls under parody
---
Nor do I and can't see where I gave that impression. 
---
This isn't an MMO and you got both micros AND subscription so there's that. 
---
Comments like this is why developers and publishers are focusing more on milking their players than making an working, polished and functioning game.
---
Because the purpose of this game is to give you Fallout nostalgia in exchange for a lot of your money
---
Tricentennial purchaser here.  Extremely disappointed in what I got for the additional cost.  I'm not buying i to their pay-to-win scheme here.  This is a slap.  And really... $100 bucks a year for 1650 atoms and unlimited storage?  Meh... trophies are nice but not game critical.  Not at all impressed BGS.  I think they thought they gave us what we wanted... instead we just have more annoyed gamers.
---
When they presented this game I was promised a CK and a way to host my own server. It is now obvious they will abandon their word, thus I got scammed.
---
No server or CK = I would never have bought this "game".
---
I think Bethesda own forums might be more suitable for you.
---
Its the exact opposite, if you don't praise and glorify how great this update was you will be shamed to hell and back.
---
So yeah, think you should just go there.
---
THANK YOU! This. THIS RIGHT HERE.
---
We can make up our own opinion, don't need random websites desperate to make clicks on outrage to tell us what to think, thank you.
---
I for one am actually very happy that the people dumb enough to support this blatant cash-grab are losing their items. 
---
Sorry to say it out loud but it's the truth!
---
once again YOU think its not worth it YOU THINK stop thinking your the center of the universe 
---
I think it is worth it and its my money I get to spend it any way I damn well please but YOU and people like you are offended by the fact I don't just listen to you
---
guess what I got it I enjoyed it and I play with my friends on it cause its only dead in your mind so please if its so terrible stop wasting your time here and go be toxic on twitter or something
---
It is a server rental with some perks basically.
---
Emotes, a box, a tent, an outfit, and atoms
---
We were paying for servers anyway
---
Yeah, I buy it too sometimes.  Especially plasma cartridges.
---
Some people enjoy the games and also make enough to where 12 dollars won kill them. I actually think it's those who care way to much about video games aka the hardcore who have such an issue with everything they do. Chances are a lot of fallout 76 players who love the game and can afford it are paying for the feature.
---
But ESO is fine right? Lmao they did this before and people were stoked and now that it’s here you hate it? Stop insulting people who are paying for the DLC for you moron.
---
I noticed that about the ammo as well. Logged into a public server this morning and my clip was empty as usual. Weird.
---
Already subbed, but thanks for the post.
---
Probably issued a cease and desist order for using BGS graphics.
---
Same upbringing and i also am super saddened by this. Its also awful timing. They are gonna make this announcement right before outter worlds drop? Seems like they are tryna do an evil play through rn.
---
The fridge only reduces the spoilage rate by 50%.  It only holds 15 items total.  You can build as many as you want as long as you don't exceed your total base size limit, I guess, but having 10 refrigerators sitting in my base is sort of dumb.  And yes, it's not $7 worth.  If they'd be more reasonable on the pricing, I'd be more willing to spend the atoms and even buy some.
---
It’s so disappointing to see how far they have strayed from their core.
---
“But that game works”  &lt;- people who do nit understand there are still coming updates
---
For what it is worth, I think it was always planned that at least the private worlds will be paid, as Pete Hines already confirmed on Twitter in August 2018 that they cannot be hosted by the player. And with how similar Fallout 1st is to ESO Plus and that it was introduced exactly 1 year after the beta, while it was stated in an old interview that private servers are not to be expected in the first year, I would not be surprised if the plan was always to have them tied to a premium subscription, even if that is only speculation. In any case, I doubt player feedback made much difference to the monetization plans either way.
---
He'll surely win back everything he lost when he pulls the level THIS TIME!
---
Lol sorry about your feelings. Im not sorry I enjoy the new stuff.
---
[everyone hated that]
---
depends on the ammo. shotgun shells and 10mm sits in my vending machine forever, but .308 always sells. so. sell what you can, dump what you don't.
---
When were you promised that? Can you link to it?
---
Same with ESO. Fuck they even locked things that should have been in base game behind a $20 paywall (Imperial Race). Nobody shitposts that sub like they do here
---
While I find the issues comical, no one deserves to get fucked over when they spend money on something.
---
Mods don't make Bethesda money so they don't care.
---
I sell everything but shotgun shells and .50 caliber ants my stash is full of everything.
---
Sad to see how mobile like this game is becoming.
---
From what I read, it said any of the outfits, emotes and icons are yours to keep even if you end your subscription.
---
&gt; PrIvAtE sErVeRs ArE cOnTeNt
---
The same content that is on the public servers.
---
Now then, once they start offering the private servers mod abilities we will have to revisit this whole discussion....
---
Because Austin being the primary team behind this was a secret. This was presented as the next big BGS game, presumably to fool as many people into giving it their attention as possible. BethSoft knew that the game would be dismissed by most if it was announced as "An online-only, multiplayer Fallout spinoff from a recently acquired team under the Bethesda umbrella," so instead they got Todd to market it.  
---
The only hope we have for Bethesda's redemption is if Todd and his team use their influence within the company to ensure their own games feature none of 76's bullshit. And they absolutely should demand that, because their previously stellar reputation is what's been most damaged by a trainwreck that they weren't to blame for.
---
Do you mean from vendor bots or peoples camps? I sell pretty much all ammo I have that I don’t used but feel like it rarely gets bought. 
---
Either way though I never buy ammo. Just go mining for lead and acid to craft new ammo.
---
Bethesda suck. They care not about your playing experience, only their cash flow. FUCK BETHESDA
---
That article just says they refunded his $12. Lol
---
Actually no, I only played it at launch.
---
I was beyond ecstatic for it, nut I couldn’t get into how the enemies respawn and sit in the spot. 
---
As for the storyline, I couldnt get past the dumb shit ti actually enjoy it.
---
Of course, this is only my opinion. Obviously a lot of people like it
---
Illuminati confirmed
---
Chuckle'd
---
Are you gonna shill for Outerworlds on gamepass too or did I just do your job for you?
---
Hahah so your excuse for paying for a skin is because lore? This has to be the best explanation yet.
---
Hey there's nothing wrong with paying a fifth of the total game price for a digital skin with zero worth.. right?
---
Umm why? Why on Earth did you pay for this? Everyone keeps wondering "what was Bethesda thinking adding this??"
---
This is exactly what they were thinking: "yeah people will be upsest but they already bought the $60 game, and there are enough idiots out there who will buy the subscription anyway, so go for it".
---
Its the internet baby. Youre either with me or against me. Insert mom joke and watch the upvotes roll in! Everyones so emotional about it and not logical at all.
---
Post truth and post irony at it's best. Not a stupid idea, btw. Fallout 76 is literaly an art peace at this point, showcasing how absurd modern game industy became.
---
From what I’ve read on this sub, they burned all goodwill the day they announced 76. And how DARE a for profit company make MONEY off of their product!? It’s just outrageous they expected people to pay for things!
---
Eso is an mmo you moron
---
Also since the release of 76 we can pretty much ignore the fallout lore
---
Reduce your friends list this ain’t FaceBook.
---
I haven’t had an issue with missing scrap.
---
Sorry but i dont feel sorry for you. For me it is just  hilarious. You gave those greedy publishers your money and you literally bought what you got.
---
They dont really care if you got fucked by the bugs. They speak in only one language...."money" . If you want the game to get better then stop paying for it.
---
You deserved it. The game has been a trash fire since day one and you still went and gave them more money.  
---
They have **0** incentive to fix this because they know you will keep buying their shit **no matter what**.
---
So we got at least 4 people who took the bait
---
How muxh was ESO when it released?
---
Works in Forknife, blame games like that for setting the standard, it is the most played game on any platform after all
---
You obviously don't know shit. Some people have many sets of armor for different situations and builds. Some people have all kinds of good 3\* weapons. Some people have a good collection of chems and food and drink. And some people have a good collection of junk for repairs and crafting. Some people have a collection of bobble heads, and magazines, and clothing items, and so on. Hoarding is one of the things people do in these games. Maybe you just throw everything away or sell everything. Good for you. It doesn't change the fact stash space being freed up directly affects gameplay. It costs money and so by definition is PAY to WIN. FACT!
---
“GRRRRAAAAFTON MAYOR HERE! Thank you for subscribing to Fallout! Now, here’s a dead guy that needs to be buried. I’ve marked the location on your map.”
---
unfortunately there are STILL fanboys and whales funneling money into this broken game.
---
some people just really don't give a shit and will defend this game to their death.  
---
have you seen how many people have been posting in this sub about issues with the subscription? meaning that despite it's extreme lack of value, a bunch of people STILL paid for the private server subscription (that apparently steals all your junk and isn't actually private...)
---
Maybe I just have a skewed view but idk anyone who plays on PC who doesnt use mods. Some go way harder than others of course, some of my friends will only use Nexus mods and only those on the site that can be thrown into the mod manager. But if you are on PC there isnt much of a reason to not at least use nexus and their mod manager. Its so easy to use its like installing DLC.
---
You’re one stupid fucker if you aren’t shit posting, this game is the one with no story. No one is crawling back to this game, it has under 6k players at any time.
---
What the fuck does that have to do with anything?
---
Both those games are mmos
---
I buy ammo instead of crafting it. I find I have way too many caps and buying it is way easier than crafting. With that being said I buy .45, 5.56, .50 cal, and 5mm all the time.
---
Idk who you mean by “you guys.”  I can only ever speak for myself, and nobody else.
---
You sell it? I’ve always put it in for free
---
Unfortunately it seems that I have to create a new post if I want to add more vote options:( sorry.
---
Shill
---
&gt; an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others. 
---
Maybe you're not talking to me. I think a subscription to keep an MMO in development and online is okay when it is an MMO that I enjoy playing. However, I am not an accomplice or a swindler acting as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others. Instead, I strongly encourage you to exercise your free will and part ways with the game, find something in life you do enjoy and spend your time/money on that instead.
---
I had no problem buying games that required a monthly subscription when that first became a thing long long ago when games first garnished the MMO branding. It was the micro transaction model that I always hated.
---
well if that's the case.. there's a benefit to NOT having a private server
---
Yeah your right I found someone selling all 3 types and brought myself up to speed.
---
Why would they talk to an uncivilised mob of screeching idiots?
---
These people care about one thing it seems people and I only see one way to make them care.. and its gounna hurt alot but, we need to boycott Doom eternal. If we show them we won't play into their shitty hands evrey time and make their biggest game of the year flop. They absolutely deserve the McDonald's treatment... also people look into McDonald's stock its hilarious!
---
I’m nearly always at max caps so spent it on some silly prices at vendors and I’m almost back to where I was. Just the flux but I traded for them and have plenty more stuff to trade so not really a problem.
---
It's still up
---
I don't have a problem with anyone else criticizing the game. I do have a problem people criticizing ME because I like playing it and am willing to spend money on it. It's none of anyone's business what I do with my money or my free time.
---
I stopped playing after 600 hours due to the fact that no new content was dropping.
---
I came back today to check wether wastelanders was dropping but i saw that nope they pushed it to 2020, introduced a subscription system and no new major content will come before wastelanders.
---
So now im hoping i still remember that this game exists when wastelanders finally drops sometime in 2020
---
Question to all the trolls and hysterical Chicken Littles who brigade this reddit on the daily: why are you still here?
---
Says he's against sub but bought it all the same. Its like saying "I hate guns...but I'll buy myself one" lol :P
---
This subreddit is such a clusterfuck of poor souls taken for a ride, stockholm syndrome has gripped them hard. Get help guys. Ye deserve better. Ye really do.
---
I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy XD
---
Found my first one last night, 3* and everything
---
Got a 1* hunter's western revolver
---
Why not try to get a he best gear you can possibly get
---
Don't subscribe to this crap. It lets Bethesda know it works.
---
NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO TRUST THIS GAME AND THE DECISIONS BETHESDA IS MAKING WITH IT
---
Lol all good ‘yes’ still gets the message across and looks like people agree.
---
But your post shows what sort of person you are, willing to help someone out.
---
Ok???
---
well he did say "content"... this doesnt actually add any content. they just want your money for nothing ;)
---
The canvas bag thing was detached from the game itself though. People forget about stuff like that way more easily. When they started selling gameplay elements in the Atomic shop, that's when it kind of started to look bad for the game itself. Now that they're selling gameplay elements for REAL money on a subscription model, there's just no way for players to ignore it. They fucked us in the ass before, but now they're making us pay for the privilege.
---
I use the hell out of those. They’re expensive to craft
---
MMO’s always have crumby monetization too host servers long term and add new content. Think how long wow or eso have been online they’re built for the long term. FALLOUT 76 IS NOT BUILY FOR THE LONG TERM
---
Wow is an mmo. You are comparing two different types of games.
---
If I can pay real world money to save time and in game currency, that is an advantage. You can label it a convenience, but that convenience is an advantage. I can pay money to not have to worry about parts of the game. That is an advantage. You can argue it's a small one, but arguing its just not an advantage at all is just a lie.
---
Ah yes, the legendary boobie exchange
---
Doesn't take away from the fact those are greedy money hungry tactics. Look at Blizzard now: nothin' but money hungry lootboxes (Overwatch, Hearthstone, I'm pretty sure Heroes of the Storm) and mobile games, with a little bit of Chinese bootlicking on top
---
WoW is pay-to-play, not pay-to-win, but okay.
---
Nope, just for your mom on weekends. Sexually....
---
lol k that argument works only if you don't think that it wasn't. Truth is, it is built for the long term. Just because people say it should be shut down and refunds doled out doesn't mean that will happen
---
Every mmo has a premium subscription, many much much worse than this
---
get over it
---
todd WORK on fallout 76 , one week at Bethesda Mary. and another in Austin.
---
he told that in an interview few months ago!
---
I only played with 3 total and yes it was great, worth the money in my opinion
---
Nope.  Asking for more than the cost of the transfer gets you sued and the domain taken from you by the regulating agency.
---
They can’t seize the domain.  They might be able to sue the guy for using trademarked  images without express permission.
---
Yeah its tough seeing the World for what it really is but thats part of growing up.
---
hell yeah brotha
---
Blast zones might lag a bit if a bunch of people show up but nothing like it used to be
---
Okay even all that being said all you’re saying is “other games do it so its okay” this isnt r/eso or r/worldofwarcraft. Why would you want that kind of monetization.
---
As Friedrich Engels once said:
---
"Hate the game, not the players"
---
they just cancelled their q+A fully anticipating the shitstorm it will be. it wont do much good, by denying people the right to speak there theyre just encouraging folks to start chanting and i am eargerly awaiting that.
---
Big difference being... that fortnite is FREE 2play
---
That is the literal definition to what pay to win means in games.
---
They make the grind fucking slow and then make you pay money so you don't need to play as much.
---
You can enjoy it thats fine.
---
Except when you spend money on generally shitty things and practices, its a problem for everyone who wants to enjoy the game without Bethesda locking things away behind a paywall for things that should:
---
A. Be in the base game for a AAA $60 Title
---
B. Actually work as intended at launch and not be a scam
---
When you spend money on things like this for a game, you’re encouraging the suits who run the studio to piss all over it even more.
---
Adventure mode is still laggin, but if you pay...
---
Fuck ESO then. ESO and WoW are MMOs. Fallout 76 is not an MMO.
---
Thank you. I don't understand how people are missing this point. This is NOT ESO or WoW, not even close. You're not paying for continued content here you're paying for specific advabtages and a rather poor private server system that should be free - charge people for the ability to customize the servers, add mod support and expand the limit more than 8 people sure but that's not even included.
---
...and a few patches ago they made screws harder to obtain! same now with the scrapper, just nerf everything and sell mtx for convenience! fuck todd
---
Sell it for 1 and people will buy it
---
Because we aren't...
---
When their next single-player games come out, I'm going to wait for free modding support to be enabled before I purchase them.  I bought Skyrim and the Fallout games before mods were enabled because I trusted them to eventually enable modding (which they did), but at this point I don't trust Bethesda any farther than I can throw them.
---
TBF I am perfectly fine with 76 being the one experiment game that is multiplayer. If they do add any multiplayer hub world or bull shit with microtransactions in their next BGS MD studio game. I can see not only people losing their jobs from the outcry/boycott or poor sales, but I could also see Zenimax do a "restructor" of BGS and that would fuck up shit even more.
---
Lord. This is delicious. 
---
I uninstalled last night. 
---
No more from them.
---
I have had it.
---
I now have more than enough memory for MW and outerworlds, outerworlds will be available at 10pm CMT tonight  on xbox gamepass.
---
Thank you for the reply, I hope you will read my long response fully. What I’m trying to put forward is that the amount of effort put in from a coding/work hour perspective for the 1st content is extremely minimal and not worth anywhere near $100 per year. I’m sure the content your gf purchased doesn’t require a subscription to keep it active on her account. Once she bought it, it belonged to her and she can use it as long as she wishes. 
---
I’m all for paying money for something you enjoy. But a sub payment for a few code changes, some in game points which costs Bethesda nothing monetarily, private server access  (Which is already available because the player basis is no longer what Bethesda accounted for so they will just dedicate the already dead servers to the sub service, I can’t tell you how many times I’m in a half or fully empty server) and some skins, is extremely bad value.  
---
Not to mention that these changes prove that the servers are capable of handeling larger camp budgets and stash sizes for junk. So as usual, we are seeing Bethesda put hinderances into the game so they can SELL us a solution. 
---
I said earlier that I personally would have no problems with paying for this one time. For the amount of work put in, $15 would be reasonable, we have got a lot more from Bethesda for that price. Additionally it has to be noted that the wastelanders DLC has now been postponed because it isn’t ready (supposedly) and despite this, Bethesda has been able to miraculously pull a subscription service out of the bag, ready to go. Very strange how the paid content is ready and waiting whereas the free content is pushed back by a matter of months. 
---
I’m just trying to make a point to the people who use the argument that people like me are complaining for free stuff, that we are not, we can pay. But we will only pay when Bethesda puts in their share of the work. 
---
All the best to you mate. I’ll keep enjoying 76 like I hope you still are. I just needed to put something out there to let people know that the people complaining are doing so because we do love the games, we have hope for Bethesda and we expect better as consumers.
---
Hathe the game, not the players ya cocknuggets
---
Its not a good deal but yeah it absolutely could be worse.
---
Free speech doesnt include insults in my country
---
Remember when people had their own opinions? Remember original posts?
---
You can also cancel for a refund within the first 30 days if you're on xbox and get the month subscription.
---
I just fucking spent 500 hard earned atoms on this shit. Come on.
---
I have it set for that price
---
The only part I disagree with is that if people wanna buy it thats them. But Bethesda doesn’t deserve your money guys.

Do you mean it is not true that they are randomly assigned? It could very well be that the game prefers to reuse the same instance for the same player when possible (i.e. someone else did not already take it), but there is no guarantee either way. It may or may not be the same when you return, even if it often is.
---
outer worlds with game pass is a dollar. so....ill get my game and my beer.
---
&gt;Then why are you still posting? The game literally never crashes on me and I experience almost no bugs.
---
Oh man, it must be a shitty feeling just  to lie to yourself like that to escape the truth that you got ripped off
---
Todd: YOU FELL FOR IT FOOL! NUCLEAR CROSS WALLET ATTACK!
---
They've screwed things up since day one of fo76 and people are still silly enough to be throwing money at them...then seem surprised they screw things up, again.
---
Don’t bother, they are so brainwashed. They seriously can’t tell the difference in how ESO developed into something that deserved paying for after they took care of their fan base, and they are actually letting 76 pass as an acceptable ‘mmo’. Absolutely hilarity.
---
I didn't approach the game envisioning and hoping that Bethesda would deliver "My Fallout". I actually wanted nothing to do with it until I observed the game play and thought it looked interesting. 
---
I paid for Star Ward Galaxies 4 times plus 4 monthly subscriptions from 2003 to 2011 when it shutdown. That doesn't make me awesome. It means I'm willing to pay for something I enjoy. Does that make me a whale, or a free minded consumer? I'm not sure I really care. 
---
I wish I could enumerate the number of games I have paid $60+ for and shelved within the first hour of play because they just didn't do it for me. That's just gaming as a whole. Gone are the days where we could rent a game from the video store on the corner to try it out.
---
Almost as if people have differing opinions and the people offended on either side are not the same ones, that’s crazy huh?
---
I havent lost any junk on ps4, as for the fallout 1 i have enjoyed it, but inky played a couple hour. I look forward to playing for a year. We will see how it goes
---
Can they do this.. 
---
Start a private world, run the legendary route, leave the world, start a new world, run the same route again? If so, that is pay to win. I can't play the vault raid on a public server cause of the lag, so I need to pay for the game to work as it's suppose to?? That..is fucked up.
---
You mean hypercritical. Hypo means below or under.
---
Youtubers love screaming 100 dollars instead of 8 or 9 a month. He garbage looking for views.
---
Hate the game, not the players ya dingus
---
You like it on the bed or on the table when Bethesda and other despicable companies bend you over
---
I'm pretty sure the stash and tent are content.
---
Ugh. The melee glitch! So frustrating. :/
---
THATS AMAZING
---
If there was no other game to play, I'd be okay playing FO76. The problem is the moment I play another game, and go back to FO76, it feels bad. The lack of polish and investment is obvious and sad. I legitimately feel bad for my favorite franchise. I have professionally framed posters and lithographs on my walls of the Fallout series...and the game makes me feel sad.
---
If you put pricing on all of this, I mean, holy crap...you can get the Xbox gamepass for this price, and you get the whole Gears series, all Halo games, Outer Worlds, Doom, and more and more, for free. If they said, "Look, this costs money, and I know you guys want it, so we're going to make it $1.99 a month, or you can use Atoms to pay for it, and we'll be able to cover the cost of the extra server horsepower.
---
The pricing is not only bad, but the optics are bad. "Your own server" is not a box in a datacenter, it's a virtual instance on a bunch of boxes, that allows a bit more data to be saved over time. You're charging this much for THAT? Really? &lt;sad face&gt;
---
Can’t wait for 3 of them to be attacking my camp
---
Yet people will still spend money on the fallout, despite Bethesda showing they don't care about players.

Check out r/fo76filthycasual for your answer
---
The original link works again!
---
ESO actually works as intended, has been established for several years, and has more content in one region of its enormous map than Fallout 76 has come up with in a year.
---
Going “Well ESO did it, why can’t FO76” is the exact logic of the suits who passed this without understanding either game and only serves to make you look ignorant, or, as others are putting it, a shill.
---
Also, how about a discount for folks who foolishly bought some atoms?  (Like...way too many in hindsight.)
---
Gamers rise up
---
It works now. It was just a hug of death from multiple sources.
---
Yes. I referenced the fact that it lacks Fallout's exploration..... But didn't know it was made by Obsidian......
---
And yes, as of late NV has become the darling of the Fallout community..... A game that was ripped as a buggy mess upon release.... Which everyone conveniently forgets. 
---
OW is clearly not Fallout in space. The lack of an open world is a major part of that.  Part of what makes the fallout settings so engaging is the ability to just wander in a direction, and who knows what you might find, what little stories you come across....
---
And 30 hours, not being short? Go look at how many hours people put into ES/Fallout games..... Easy triple digit hours.... People revisit these games regularly for a long time.... I still pop Skyrim, FO4, NV occasionally. 
---
A near linear RPG/Shooter? No open world exploration? Still could be amazing. But fallout in space it's not.
---
Gonna let you in on a little secret pal. You play the game too
---
Maybe dont be such a cunt?
---
It's actually still going on they just don't really advertise it.  Upgraded mine last week for Gears
---
Are you upset because your a bk?
---
It’s been a long time since I’ve seen 4chan unite for an asspull like this. God I love the internet.
---
So you just won’t answer the question?
---
It really makes me fear for the TES VI and Starfield. I had such hopes...
---
Nope, I definitely mean hypocritical.
---
Someone that does one thing, but says another etc.
---
I'll sell it to you for $13/mo.
---
If you're rubbed wrong by this and would like a refund, request your bank does a charge-back for the purchase. I had no issues with my bank after explaining the situation. They asked if I had any other info for them, I told them if they googled 'fallout 76' there would be no shortage of information. 
---
Sure, your bethe$da account will be in jeopardy after this, but if you're truly fed up, not playing this 'game' wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
---
Well the only way i see this working is by making Fallout 76 free,otherwise.... 
---
But to be honest if you haven't quit Fallout 76 by now and you are complaining while still thinking of buying the 1st thing then you deserve to have your money taken for your own stupidity.
---
Tomorrow shia LaBeouf is gonna pop out with a bag on his head.
---
Lmao wow
---
For an mmo this is the business model. They didn't spring the subscription on a bunch of pre-existing players. When you buy an mmo those are the sort of things you look at before deciding to dedicate that much time and money to a it. Fallout is NOT an mmo, at least no more than Gta is.
---
Hate the game not the players
---
\-Karl "vaporwave" Marx
---
Ooh!  Too bad we can't change its language specifically.  I don't have a Collectron, but if it could wander around speaking Deutsch in my English game, that's almost worth the Atoms.  
---
My ex-wife is German.  Having a cold non-feeling thing walking around the property muttering to itself in German while providing little of actual value would be just like old times.
---
I regret to say that out of the 10-15 people I play with regularly, half are either thinking about it or have already bough it.  Even a couple of the ones who don't play *that* much.
---
There are only three that are "never 1st-ers".
---
?????? Lmao. Ah. Makes sense why you play this game then.
---
I buy if its 1cap per (.45, .50, 5mm is what my current characters use).  Also I was leveling an alt and even spent a few thousand caps on .38 and 10mm, so I would say leave it, but don't overprice.
---
Unfortunately there are two other platforms you forgot to take into account.
---
u/Valseek
---
I’ve leveled up 3 different characters past 120. I’ve done these events what must be hundreds of times. It’s old and boring at this point. There’s zero challenge and almost zero reward.
---
Congratulations! You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Other than Fallout 76, which isn't even really THAT bad, what other issues have people been having with recent Bethesda games? I don't play that many, so am curious to see what else is causing issue with fans. 
---
In other news, I'm not happy with Fallout 1st, but I just won't pay for it, so there's that one solved.
---
But is the real problem here Fallout 1st or the lies?
---
Fully agree. you were downvoted by someone who likes micro transactions and unfinished games.
---
I was really hoping this was satire and I was disappointed that it wasn’t lol
---
If you can't tell the difference between minecraft and fallout, then I'm not qualified to give you the type of help you need. Apples and oranges.
---
Also, Bethesda is a private company. They only achieved a net worth of 2.5 billion after the investment firm Providence invested several hundred million dollars. This gives them an obligation to meet certain levels of profitability. Even with that investment though, they are still not a "multi billion dollar" company, nor do they have the same business model as EA, Activision etc. The subscription is entirely necessary for 76, and should have been a thing from the start. You can want everything for free, that's on you. The rest of us that have to deal with financial commitments understand the reality of the situation though.
---
I mean. A $60 AAA that already has microtransactions implementing a subscription service is really fucking stupid but go off.
---
That doesn’t even sound fun. I’m glad I haven’t been playing. Thanks for the info
---
"throwing money at them in exchange for exclusivity, and calling it competition"
---
Yeah its literally competition. You know how steam would get the rights to the game? 
---
By paying more.
---
there is the competition. Its business not fucking soccer.
---
But that’s what Reddit is all about! We share an opinion article so that people can agree with us and we can basque in how woke we are while flaming anyone with a differing opinion!
---
I just made a comment as a joke in the first place... you were to one instantly being triggered...
---
THAT is the problem here, if you enjoy it, I won't stop you from playing it or judge you by it.
---
But as far as I know, giving my opinion is still allowed on this site. So if you have a problem with people giving their opinion, you should just leave the internet.
---
I personally think it is stupid what bethesda did, and I'm allowed to think that.
---
The game is a laggy buggy mess for everyone that paid but people who can pay MORE should get a game that actually works? Are you seriously serious right now? I don't believe for one second that that money is going to coders and writers. This isn't the way to treat a loyal base. Telling them to pony up more for stability that should be there in the first place.
---
I got it for the outfit and atoms, turned it right back off. The extra camp is cool but I didn't even touch the scrapper since I don't mind playing inventory manager and wanted to continue to do so. I wish I could say I'm surprised. Sorry that happened. Think I'll be uninstalling now. So fucking sad.
---
If I was you i'd wait till black friday at least, I do that with every service I start.
---
Good thing people can get the TOW for 1 dollar for a month of game pass.
---
&gt; Don't come at this mob with logic and reason
---
says the fan-BOY! 
---
lmao
---
Bethesda demonstrates it's greed and total disregard towards players time after time. People for some reason still buy into their BS and jumped in to support them with purchasing 1st membership. Now they get burnt and realize the service is basically a lie... hard not to feel cynical and laugh.
---
GameStop just crawled out of a trashcan  nearby and limped over to you. "You mean it?! You promise?!"
---
Well in general, the concept was good. Going through steam then Bethesda was a poor implementation. Lack of quality control and to many people skimming off the  modders work. But CC I think is a good idea all around. My biggest gripe would have to be how limited it is so far. I'd love to see a lot more quality in there, like a nice $15 expansion or something. I get it, bethesda doesn't want to continue making expansions but if modders had the capability to make meaty content and selling it, and even making a business out of it. I'd welcome that. Especially if that content came in a timely manner.. with quality.  
---
Bethesda is sitting on a gold mine if they can find the right balance for having a platform for sellable content. Skyrim could have been the youtube of gaming but they went with FO76... Its incredibly sad.
---
I have to be that guy too..... But it bugs me.... The Phrase is "Level Playing Field"
---
You may have a point, if the junk launcher was in the game.
---
Given how the implemented private worlds, I don't have high hopes for modding potential anyway. There's no option to self-host, which probably means you won't be able to mod in any new assets (textures, models, animations, etc.) because Bethesda would need to host and serve all of those assets, which would add enormous strain to the servers that they claim can't even keep up with player inventories. Furthermore, since private worlds don't host player data, you would either need to create a new character every time you joined one (not very practical) or any mods that could make the game easier would be *severely* restricted. I'm trying to imagine what mods this would leave room for, and I'm not coming up with much.
---
I seriously cant imagine any of their staff being happy with the current backlash on this subject, and therefore doing nothing to atleast try to counter it.
---
What a buch of shameless cunts
---
It’s not that the subscription model in itself is bad, it’s that Bethesda guaranteed us something else when we all bought the game. That’s the issue imo.
---
Sad that you are stuck with games for windows live kid ;( I hope your gaming experience improves beyond 2007 very soon ;(
---
Yeah, I hate it when weapons have extra damage or extra to hit or extra stealth recognition or more AP or give me more sprinting time and who the hell would want more resistance to disease? I mean honestly, what a waste.  Unyielding is only popular because it starts with a "Uny" /s
---
Couldnt help myself XD
---
Perception helps you break stealth on enemy's faster see enemy's on your compass from farther away and most importantly it effects your to hit % in vats.  It's not like 1 point will make or break you but adding them up a couple here a couple there makes a really big difference.
---
That gives you stuff they removed from the base game and that were supposed to be free so that they could charge you 15$/Month later on.
---
This was awesome...!!! well written too..
---
At one point werent they just banning people with certain items to target the people who got into the dev room they left in the game for some stupid reason or was that just myth?
---
You should be able to launch the nuke no problem, but without a bloodied build, you are going to have a real hard time soloing the queen. A bloodied build can solo the queen but you need to have all your cards in order and need to also factor in the learning curve of playing w low health
---
Calling someone stupid and s shill is crticism?
---
 [http://falloutfirst.com/](http://falloutfirst.com/)  is back up! Still with the "changed" texts! :D
---
No...quite frankly, no...I am not.  I will be satisfied when the game is linked to my personal checking account so that I could authorize withdrawals without being limited to PSN’s max account of $175.  Until then, this game will deserve my money, but not my respect!
---
Why are people buying subscriptions? Are you guys masochists, retardeds or just want to support the shittiest business possible?
---
"poor whiny little children bitching" 
---
The community has asked for expanded storage space since launch. The same community that paid full price and has been keeping the game alive. 
---
Bethesdas answer to the most requested feature? Pay us more
---
I think a nuke falling nearby may do some damage.
---
It's safe to assume that PC has less, as it always does, and PS4 a bit more.
---
We are looking at, what? 6k players, tops?
---
Here's a list of some **indie** games that have way more: Friday the 13th, ARK, Roblox, World War Z, Dead by Daylight, SMITE...
---
The images they used own to Beth and they probably got hit with a cease and desist.  so they either had to take it down or go to court against a huge company with lawyers on payroll that have a clear cut case and if you lose the court case you have to pay their legal fees
---
Eh. I dunno if I wanna play OW. Story seems like they just remade Mass Effect Andromeda and I’m not interested in retreading a story I already played.
---
You have people who just throw away their money and then reply to the outrage with "lol you're just too poor peasant". Why would bethesda change when they could milk these fools for all their moneys worth?
---
Sorry I disagree .... you sound angry are you okay?  Press upvote for yes and downvote for no.
---
I’ve seen this story before and trust me you will be back but taking a break is probably good at this point.
---
Seriously man take care of yourself.
---
Not sure if players are experiencing this on console or PC or both... 
---
I think it’s more than just one factor here. 
---
I only had 5 people including myself compared to what 24 on any given server in adventure (I believe that’s the max not sure) 
---
So if you take away players jumping servers, and the constant changes of all connected I think would be a huge factor alone. 
---
We can subtract anyone making a thousand nuke mines or cleavers it any duping. 
---
Overall it was the smoothest I’ve experienced on console with a direct hardwired connection.
---
I’m sure this is going to get me downvoted into oblivion, but this is basically just a copy pasta of the original OP’s post. I literally just saw the post last night on this subreddit and I don’t understand why you’d need to post this thread, aside from Karma farming.
---
I have defended you so much in the past Bethesda and now i wish i could go back in time and before i made those comments. But i cant. 
---
Expensive instance freaking servers you greedy *#@&amp;#@!
---
I only did a solo once, did it solo at around level 60. Was rifleman at the time with a quad lever and a vampired ultracite gatling and loads of chems. 
---
I wouldn't classify myself as a good player, i am mediocre or average at best. I'm sure you can do it if I pulled it off going in blind.
---
Really? Because it seems like only people like you didn’t give a shit. I sure as hell did. This guy definitely did. But you just threw up your hands and said this is fine
---
&gt; Really? Can you tell me where can i get a scrapbox or survival tent on public server?
---
Sure, my camp. Or the tent with the scrapbox I ran across just behind the RedRocket in Flatwoods. Or the tent some random threw down as we wrapped up a SBQ event...
---
Nah. If you're STILL getting taken advantage by Bethesda and STILL keep giving them your money, you completely deserve it at this point
---
Solo'ing the silo you mean? You shouldn't have any issues with that.  
---
Solo'ing the queen? I wouldn't bother myself. I bet i would use 10k rounds taking her down.
---
I will accept 6,000 atoms, or the Ranger outfit.
---
They will go back defending this pos web Wastelanders releases.
---
SEO guy reporting for duty! Honestly everyone talking about this will do very well for it's rankings as others have said. The biggest bump will happen once a lot of gaming news outlets pick up the story and link to the domain.
---
Google still uses links and the strength of a linking website to rank a site higher. Gaming websites have massive authority so that will help a lot. 
---
Pass the story to gaming journalists and things will happen on their own.
---
If scrap material is genuinely so easy to make an unlimited stash box for, then why is it behind such a pricey pay wall? You want to talk brick walls, there are people on this subreddit who are so obsessed with Bethesda that they would eat literal shit if Zenimax handed it to them in a wet paper bag for $100.
---
Yup! Same here. Load into private and it’s at the same number you left it.
---
sexy!
---
There are people that play this game exclusively? 👀
---
I agree
---
Yes I meant the silo
---
You... can’t destroy camps anymore, outside of launching a nuke
---
So im actually wondering about that, not so much a bug (we all know something like that's gonna happen at some point), but If I decide to cancel after this month I'm trying, what happens to my extensive scrapping? I've got 700lbs of flux I wanna put in there lol
---
It's sad isn't it? We really have to go back quite far these days to not encounter micro-transactions and shit like that in our games.
---
Only one way to be sure
---
Last time I checked I wasnt the OP and I didn’t say stupid or shill in my comment. Do you understand that? Oh and here’s that video you asked for https://youtu.be/6b-JDJXV1Es
---
Problem is they are more than happy to live in it. Gaming industry needs another crash NOW. Nuke it all and restart from scratch. Price games at 80 so they can stop bitching they don’t make enough money. I would pay that. There is no correcting this cesspool of an industry now. It needs to die and be revived. It can’t be cured.
---
First world problems.
---
I'm not wholly invested in defending the sub service, more like 70 for/30 against. I understand some of the concerns, but I unfortunately have 0 tolerance for the hordes of irrational rage posts. It makes my responses more jaded than they would be otherwise.
---
Considering this game already was underdeveloped at launch, panned at launch by critics and players combined, severely low sales
---
It was controversy after controversy, they even delayed the upcoming DLC, yet they want 12.99 per month or $100 per year for something that should've been there at launch and then pre-order level items???
---
That makes no sense 
---
If anything all this stuff should've been free given how much of a train wreck this game has been so far
---
thats an odd definition for 'winning' charlie
---
Well that’s good. And I guess these excessive nuke cards are gonna come in handy
---
The very fact that people still supported FO76 to this very day is already proof that people will abide by this market. Some people just buy anything that is a franchise. There's no hope for the next bethesda game. It WILL suck.
---
Thanks, feels good knowing what you were running and you succeeded, I'm fairly average too
---
I haven’t touched this shit heap since they released a raid that was unplayable, keep lying to yourself, keep playing this. Let Bethesda suck the rest of the soul out of their games and make sure you spend 18.99 for the Starfield membership in 2022, you’ll need it to mod the game!
---
Friend of mine has been soloing lanuches since he was \~ L70, so I know it can be done.  
---
Apparently, theres a couple shortcuts that can be taken to drop silo time from \~45 min down to 20ish.
---
Given there are lots of bots, something with a Troublshooters prefix  may help.
---
I have no issue if you purchase the Fallout First membership. Do whatever you please with your money. My issue with the private servers stems from the pricing structure and the options it offers. It doesn’t even give you control over the server, nor does it run 24/7. It is more like renting a private session, it only runs when you’re online.
---
For the record, no one expected it to be free. What’s rubbing people the wrong way is how overly expensive it is, and the pay2win mechanics it introduces. $100 a year for a private server is ridiculous. 
---
It’s more expensive than a yearly subscription for PlayStation Plus, Xbox Live, or Xbox Game Pass.
---
So you’re ok with breaking TOS then? Got it... maybe that’s part of the issue...
---
Why would you trust anything at this point? 
---
They purposely delayed Wastelanders to devote attention to this nonsense so this is the last straw for me.   I’m going to check out the Halloween event this weekend and then move to Outer Worlds.
---
Yeah I just mean the silo
---
Don't peer pressure people into your shitty habits.
---
Join us, we can add some nice pointy bits to that power armour of yours 😚
---
Since you actually did buy this question, have you experience the bug where you loose your scrap from your scrap box when switching from "private" to public server?
---
Even longer than that. I was enjoying myself after taking a break from Anthem. And then POW, right in the kisser.
---
Zenimax most likely saw how Activision and EA were making huge money through Microtranstasionts and decided to force it onto BGS Austin (who made 76 not BGS MD Todd's studio)
---
Last time i checked i never stated you insulted me?
---
I don’t have bug problems or crashing. Sorry?
---
All the seeds of this were present in FO4.  The atomic shop is just creation club 2.0, the whole crafting system is just a platform for mtx.  Notice how like half of the DLC for FO4 want basically just crafting?  There's going to be more of that in Starfield and TE6.
---
Bethesda's gone the way of EA.  RIP Bethesda.
---
Yeah, they have to audacity to pay people for their work. How fucking terrible. Some modders actually want to be paid for doing work! The nerve of those greedy bastards.
---
Those are features, not content. Content would be new areas/quests or weapons or skills etc
---
The statement is technically correct, but that's irrelevant. This change obviously goes against the *spirit* of the statement, and they should be ridiculed for it.
---
I can't understand how anyone is seriously trying to defend them
---
Geez, how many hours of play have you had? If it’s over 500, I’d say you’ve had your money’s worth and you ought to quitchabitchen
---
&gt; Its like saying "I hate guns...but I'll buy myself one"
---
I have a friend that owns guns that he believes should be a felony to own. I just don't understand the mindset at all.
---
This isn't a season pass or a paid dlc.
---
They also promised us free creation kit and a way to host our own server, because without it, a lot of us would have considered FO76 another ESO, and not have bought it. IMO that's false advertisement.
---
Swing and a miss
---
You were dumb enough to actually pay for this service so of course this is what you get from it

---
This is so delicious that I literally got up, made popcorn,  and read all the comments in this thread. It was more entertaining to read this comment section and eat popcorn than to play 100 hours of FO76
---
Yes, because...
---
1. The game launched broken and nearly a year later is still a buggy mess
---
2. They delivered piss all content to support this “service” in the last few months and it looks to be dry af for a good bit going forward as well
---
3. They used large community requests like being able to purchase the ranger armor and having a mini camp to entice people into subing
---
Subscription services are fine but this game isn’t even in a state most people feel deserves anything more than the money they paid upfront.
---
Also the comparisons to eso is a joke. These games are barely similar at all. Compared to destiny, or the division, this game looks even worse than it already did.
---
Even then people want it. What this could be still has draw but until it hits a higher quality bar a sub fee makes Beth’s suits look like foolish assholes.
---
Check out outerworlds, it's getting great reviews
---
Yeah i had to trim the list down to about 7 people. Sucks cuz i like to do a bit of trading. Hopefully they will add a block all for session type feature in a future patch.
---
I doubt it. Bet a bunch of people will buy FO subscriptions. We will never learn it seems. How many people still trust that the next CoD won't have major MTX and progress hindered in order to make MTX more desirable.
---
“Free speech doesn’t include insults” -responding directly to me. Sit down. Your logical fallacies are hilarious. You have no argumentative ground to stand on.
---
Poor bethesda the small indie dev company :( not their fault there has not been content since May
---
I too recommend Bolstering. You can get your DR significantly higher than the best Power Armor.
---
their choice: they do nothing...
---
Kind of a dick move, even if you dont agree with the subscription why you gotta be a dick to other players. If someone wants to shell out the money then let em. No reason to be a dick about it.
---
dang, sorry man
---
It's still in beta so it doesn't have every game.
---
Hiding out with the Anthem PR manager. I assume drinking. Lots of drinking. Maybe some sobbing.
---
You're right it should have only been a one time payment and then free updates forever.
---
 I own a tiling business maybe I should pick up that business model.
---
 If I tile one Room in your house all the other rooms in your house are free.
---
 How long do you think I'd be able to stay in business with that model?
---
Well if your tiling is anywhere near the quality of Fo76 I'd want my money back and you wouldn't come near my other rooms
---
das ist gut, ja?
---
They have to mess... 16X the details.
---
It's a "scrap" box. It does exactly what's it's supposed to do . lol
---
Great to hear, I may take my low level friend with me, he just got into the game, he's lvl 20, he'll probably get killed a bit but we will have fun
---
You failed to bring a point. I paid for a thing, I got that thing.  Is it moronic to expect additions to that thing to cost money? This isn't an expansion (included in initial purchase price and frankly a gamble anyway on quality) , Its an additional service not previously advertised. I don't live and die by outrage though.
---
ESO didn't affect FO4 except maybe the Creation Club, which only released like a year after they stopped supporting the game with DLC. I wouldn't expect F76 to affect their single player games. They seem to toe the edge for those, I mean at worst they would put in p2w stuff like XP boosts like Assassin's Creed: Greece did. lol I don't even remember that game's name
---
Yea because we stopped doing what we do to people who cross a "picket line". Back in the late 80s to early 90s whenever there was a strike in the grocers union they would strike and picket outside the store. We would form lines and wouldnt let anyone into the store. Not customers, and certainly not "scabs" (people who are willing to fill in for workers during a strike and get paid a much higher wage because they dont get any insurance.) But any scab that did try to cross the line, literally got jumped. I watched my mother, a grocery clerk stomp on a dudes kneecap to keep him from being able to work. There was never a strike that lasted more than 2 weeks back then. If we did that now with gamestop's and other retailers... Bethesda would listen pretty fuckin quick let me tell you.
---
Even if we are talking about skyrim, my point still applies. The post is mischaracterizing what happened, bethesda NEVER charged for fan made mods. They attempted to create a platform where modders COULD CHOOSE to charge for their work. The first implementation through steam was a shitshow... in part thanks to steams cut and lack of quality control. The creation club today I think is fine and has a lot of potential.
---
What is strange to me, is the massive backlash on here. But then I logged on earlier and nearly every single one of the 30 or so people I saw online were on a private server......
---
If you don't even play/enjoy the game why did you chime in on here? 
---
That's more the kind of thing I look down on.
---
You look like an asshole instead of some witty cunt.
---
Bethesda makes me sad. Member Skyrim? I member Skyrim that was good times
---
Ahh 4chan at it again
---
Most of the people playing the game now are cash shop idiots including me. I ain't buying into this subscription though not when there is f all planned for the game past what they have already told us.
---
I'm starting to wonder if wastelanders is going to be made a Subscription only part to the game now I mean they have lied about everything else so far.
---
The difference is that I use ad blockers and dont pay for anything on this site. EGS still commits poor business practices that are harmful to consumers and I will have zero part of it.
---
Not when the anger is justified. But, okay. You think god doesnt get angry?
---
Never trust a PR guy ever he is profissional liar that tells you everything in the world is great while the apocalypse is happening and your house is burning.
---
You deserve it for continuing to support Bethesda.
---
It’s for the best if they stay silent, and I only say that because some people would rip into them. With the backlash being this big tho, they’d be stupid not to say anything. Remember the bag?
---
you have a 30-45 min return timer iirc.
---
Of course he will!!! After yesterday they'll see that they're not selling it like they thought and will try to sell it reducung it's price
---
Yeah regardless of what's actually happened if people decide to purchase it they deserve to get what they've purchased regardless of outside opinion.
---
I’ll probably get downvoted to oblivion, but cmon guys. If it’s their money, let em spend it. Sure, you may think it’s trash like a lot of us do. But it doesn’t mean you need to call them names for doing it. Not everyone is the same, and you guys are just ripping the few people apart who don’t mind it. I personally bought a month just to see how it works. So what? Not saying I’m 100% for it, but if you bought it, it’s your money. Some of you are literally just coming here for a reason to tear people apart and have no idea what’s going on. 
---
I’m pretty disappointed in the community.
---
Upvoted cause I too got a weapon from the purveyor last night that was on my most wanted list: a bffr 50cal.  Somehow was more excited about that than having hanging bats in my camp (I've wanted those from the pumpkin house since last november) So grats man, enjoy the little pleasures when they come. =)
---
I honestly think the backlash is overblown, just like the backlash with Dexit on Pokemon sword/shield.  This community already has been fractured so this is just a sub-community of the already smaller online community.
---
Yes. Like 2-3 weeks after release the game was bundled with every xbox or PS controller in the most mayor electronic stores here in Germany lol.
---
(btw I'm from Germany that's a reason for our price difference)
---
Release a stand alone single player version that can be played offline with everything scaled to a solo experience (with difficulty sliders) and all randomly generated items (Outfits, Magazines, Bobbleheads, etc.) in fixed, guaranteed locations. Besides Legendary gear of course.
---
Also release Wastelanders, and much more content like it.
---
ITS A TRAP!!!
---
I dont have windows 10, so theres that.
---
Because once again, reddit is nowhere near the majority of the playerbase.
---
They just think they're the lorax
---
Answer to who? You? Go cry yourself to sleep. All your whining will change nothing. This is here to stay. Get used to it or just go bye bye.
---
That’s not how domains work...
---
Damn I just saw someone with the ranger outfit and I heard this music so I turned around and he was breaking it down! Lmao. It was so funny. I’m going to have to get a month just so I can get the emotes and stuff!
---
“I’m laughing at the superior intellect!”
---
It's almost as if Bethesda completely ignored literally every news article and gaming journal, every social media etc. Where do *they* get the feedback of players loving their shit anyway? Because all I see on *every* forum is hate? Does Todd Howard personally visit these valuable players at night and lovingly question them? It seems almost as if Bethesda is...lying? "Whoda thunk", broh?
---
&gt; I did not buy 76.
---
Bruh there is alot of naming conventions or gimmicks for stands and this dont meet any of em.
---
salt and tears my friend
---
If unlimited scrap is as simple to add as you all claim it is, the fact it's behind such a pricey pay wall is even more of a slap in the face. This should be a feature everyone is getting, regardless of whether they could afford the $200 canvas bag edition or if all they can afford is a five dollar Goodwill find.
---
drama queen
---
AND it’s still broken, don’t forget that part.
---
"Du bist ein Stück Schrott" ;p
---
I've set my PS4 to German, I have no clue if I could switch the game to another language 🤔
---
Sad to see how far they've fallen since 2018.
---
They actually get their ideas almost exclusively from reddit, they've said as much in interviews. This is the most active source of feedback they have. Unfortunately the vocal, emotional minority tends to drown out the majority opinion at first, but that's just the way the world works in general now. Calmer heads will prevail though, and the subscription will help this game move in a better direction.
---
&gt;e
---
Wishing that they would go bankrupt is kind of fucked. Hundreds of employees would lose their livelihood,  who had no say in what upper management does, and unless they are living beyond their means, upper management has likely made more than enough caps to live comfortably after Bethesda dies.
---
For me it is. 100÷12=8.33. So maybe hes bad at math idk.
---
Damn, where do you live that it's only $8 a month? It will cost me $129.99+tax for the year.
---
To the community that supported the game despite its problems. You need to stop being so childish, you're the reason shit like this happens
---
exciting stuff
---
So your initial purchase of the game should sustain it and future development forever and everything should be free?
---
I don't think anyone ignored them. They just weren't right back then, either
---
Obviously you are not reading what I said.
---
Oh please, unless you were looking distinctly for positive comments the gamefaqs, twitter, and other sites look exactly the same. 
---
Everyone knows reddit is nothing more than another concentration of the fanbase, and i'd even argue a concentration of the mostly positive side of it (Note obviously not all, or even close to that.)
---
Did you make a Reddit account just for this post? Wow you're really passionate about this. Or is this a throwaway to make it seem like this is a bigger issue than it is?
---
This. But they wont
---
It's an online game, with none of the updates or utilities of an MMO. People keep mentioning ESO, ignoring that ESO has a huge amount of content for solo, group and endgame. 76 has struggled, hasn't been fixed, hasn't had any major updates, has no endgame etc etc yet here they are asking you to pay again for what has already been bought and played. Had they put the effort in the game would sell. If they updated players will stick around. Instead you are subsidising them on the promise that they may produce some content next year. It's sad but I'd rather the game died off than support it in it's current state. It's on Bethesda to run a successful business, not our responsibility to keep them afloat if they fail to perform.
---
If you paid for the subscription service and you're having issues, I'm glad that's the case, because you're the prime example of why you shouldn't be an early adopter for a business practice coming from a developer with a product that is notoriously buggy.
---
You deserved what you got for not waiting and jumping right into it.  Buying instantly is just blindly supporting an unpolished product without any standards of quality, so that's what you got.  Well done.
---
Vault Tec's greatest experiment
---
Ummmm but Fallout 1st gets you emotes, a tent, atoms and 8 player servers, and scrap???? Oh wait you might be on to something
---
No way, they got scammed from proven scammers? No way, that's insane.
---
I spent money supporting the dethroned Nigerian Prince so he can get his kingdom back, luckily I got millions in returns but it wouldn't of been my fault if I got scammed, its someone elses!
---
Bethesda takes orders from ZeniMax who is obligated to provide returns on the investments made by Providence Equity Partners.
---
I did. Choo choo!
---
Legendär!
---
at a certain point you're just enabling the game
---
I enjoy it as well. I think there is a mass of people loving it they just aren’t posting on here because of all the hatred. It’s pretty sad when you can even converse without someone attacking you.
---
When I first played Skyrim, I thought it was a great game with a lot of work invested. After trying Oblivion, I realized a lot of mechanics were recycled, and the engine was obviously the same. That concept was only reinforced when I tried Morrowind. With time it became clearer that Bethesda was gradually getting lazier and hungrier by the time. When I saw FO76 announced I already predicted it was going to be bad, but they went beyond my wildest imaginations.
---
Bethesda is really hopeless. Don't expect much.
---
Also... FO76 uses the cheapest servers you can buy. 8 to 10 bucks a month. Bethesda definitely got a bulk deal on them and now they are selling you 1/3 of it for 13 bucks a month. They are handing the bill to paying customers.
---
I would love to love it. 12.99 is nothing really. I just can't. I have had a lot of fun with the game. I enjoy every minute of it. I love my CAMP and my characters. What annoys me the most is dying and only being able to res at vault 76 (happens a lot a year after release) and crashing (happens infrequently a year after release). Other than that, the game is awesome. I want to support it, but I just can't. I can't support this direction. I may have been tempted in the pricing was lower, and if there were more monthly Atoms. They priced themselves out of it, just enough for my ethical stance on it to stay firm, which I know is saying I'm weak, and I have been weak in many ways in the past, but after skipping a few of the big publishers games, that I may have been interested in, I'm feeling stronger about these decisions for the good of future games.
---
Hmm, what if they just replaced the actual images with in-game screenshots just for show? Bethesda couldn't demand a C&amp;D for that right?
---
&gt;How much does a company... mess up... so much
---
&gt;I remember when this Sub used to vigorously defend FO76
---
I think you answered your own question there. This game should never have been defended. Now they know they can get away with pretty much anything.
---
You said "special" so I listed a few things special stats did, that's str agi per and end.  And yeah, a single point isnt much, as I said, you have to stack em here and there and they add up to a big difference.  Maths and stuff.
---
Hyperbole much?
---
Literally all the news sites have been mocking this though
---
I guess that is all a matter of opinion because I think I got my 60 bucks worth and I'm still willing to pay more money.
---
 I love the game and have fun playing it.
---
If I didn't I definitely wouldn't hang around a reddit page dedicated to a game I hated and talk shit about it.
---
it's almost as if all the idiots go on every platform to throw their tantrums...
---
Money well spent.
---
Probably a Yes.  Because your CAMP is persistent across Private and Public Servers.
---
Therefore if I subscribe, build my premium CAMP on Private, and log over to Public it better stay exactly as it was on Private.
---
&gt;When you start a trailer with something akin to "From the studio that made Fallout: New Vegas..."
---
&gt;That's being compared to Bethesda
---
How? Fallout has existed *far* before Bethesda acquired the IP. Who do you think made Fallout 1 and 2?
---
I will still think about buying future Bethesda games (specifically Elder Scrolls), but I am really scared what they are going to do to it... if It is a multiplayer mom like fo76, I will be forced to consider buying it later after release... My opinion, we should get all fo76 gamers to stop playing 76 between November 1st and January 1st (or until Bethesda listens and gives us what was promised from the beginning)
---
Ah must’ve missed it. Thanks!
---
Best thing read of fallout 76 in a year! Dude is the best thing that happened to that game period.
---
No. You said we should be able to switch between maps randomly. I agree, but you'd need to be able to tie a set of perk cards to each map.
---
For example, someone who runs around with radiation-related or water-related perks for the Morgantown map would find those perks absolutely useless in the Flatwoods map.
---
All it will do is chase them away to there private servers. Do nothing but satisfying your own temper. They already paid for the subscription they dont need to be public.
---
Of course anyone would enjoy the subscription ..its literally all the fixes to the unfinished game they released in the first place that's the issue lol
---
There are many better solutions that what they chose.  But they ain't listening.
---
There wouldn’t be a point to destroying a tent seeing as how all you have to do is open the quick menu and plant it no resources needed
---
They don’t, only the owner of the world has to be a 1st member, no one else does. Now if the 1st member leaves then the world will shut down Unless there is another 1st member present
---
Not gonna acknowledge a post trying to bring up god and fallout in the same sentence. Stop being cheesy.
---
I guess that's an option. I just wish there were more guess and things to do. I haven't played in a few weeks. I might play this weekend for the Halloween event though. I really hope wastelanders is good. I think most of the people still playing won't mind the subscription much considering a lot of us buy stuff from the atom store anyways. It's not good press though that's for sure. Now the 76 subreddit is filled with trolls again. Lol
---
Wow lol seriously who cares about what you spend your money on.
---
\*the publisher
---
It's really a shame, seeing BethSoft falter so much anymore. It makes me really unsure about Starfield. It's like Bioware all over again.
---
True, with a fuckup like this they are damned if they do and damned if they don't. I do feel bad for them, this isn't their fault, but it is their job to interact with the community and that means interacting in the good times and bad.
---
It's included on Game Pass does that count
---
Dumbass
---
Dude this game is going to be dead in a week .cod and outer worlds drop tonight. Private servers are probably a good thing so you don’t see how dead the regular servers are
---
We knew last year before the game was released that the private worlds/sessions/servers was going to be a rental - we always knew it was going to be on their equipment and always online.
---
All of these games are designed around the cash shop, pal.
---
They first ask the question "how are we going to make money this year", then they start developing the game around the answers to those questions. It a horrible business practice. And I've been preaching about this for like 4 years, and there's still people who'll buy FO76 subscription, mark my words
---
Collector bot
---
I have EVERY idea what I'm talking about. Everyone is angry that they didn't have servers where you can: change the spawn rates, change the drop rates, utilize mods to change your characters attributes, change enemy difficulties and loot tables, etc. You guys are all screaming about how unfair the system they introduced will be, when really it was the most balanced way to introduce it. Everyone complaining right now ASSUMED that they would get all these features, and none of that was ever said. They never said that private servers meant separate. They never said that they meant you would get full access to customize everything in the game. Everyone assumed, and they have made an ass out of themselves. 
---
I'm glad it is the way it is. It's fair, equitable, and there's no room for people to exploit it to gain an advantage. It's literally just a way to control who you play with, and not have to worry about storing junk anymore. Plus, it helps fund the game, which means we might FINALLY see some of the bugs get fixed.
---
Good job Bethesda, you're one step closer to restoring my faith in your ability to run a successful game company. Now I just need to start seeing weekly bug fixes, and we're golden.
---
I really feel bad for Todd and his team working on starfield and the elder scrolls. They're getting all the flak they probably didn't even work on. Maybe Todd deserves a bit of flak for hyping the game as the next big game but damn it must be pretty taxing for the other team members who had nothing to do with 76
---
Edit: spelling
---
&gt; I myself didn't touched FO76
---
Another one.
---
Nah but if theres a season 2 watch it cost money.
---
Indeed. I sadly have a few RL friends that subbed for a month just for that outfit. 
---
This is going to signal success to Bethe$da, and they may even have a new exclusive outfit every few months to get more people to sub for a month.....
---
what about our own users here at this sub who have said the same thing?  just check out some of the posts here
---
I’m not arguing any of that. I’m saying nobody should be shocked that an online game is offering a subscription service. Regardless of what someone wants to call it, it’s still an online game and they all do this. Tbh I’m surprised it didn’t happen sooner.
---
Yup crazy that anyone would expect anything but bugs from Bethesda.
---
Harder and harder to stay "loyal"......
---
Well I never pre-order anything to begin with, no matter how much I want the game. But specifically with Bethesda, I’m definitely much more skeptical about their future games, and for the first time with them I’m more nervous about what they might do with Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI than I am excited. If either launch with a MTX store, I won’t be buying them.
---
I don’t think their intention was to ever allow private server hosting.  It’s a bad terminology they used, they need to change it to private sessions.
---
Sorry it happened but people post within like minutes of it coming out it was happening. Hope you didnt loose too much.
---
I love morbid curiousity &gt;:)
---
Blame bethesda for prioritizing the people who will throw money at the no matter how shit the game is?
---
Took too long for you to actually stop supporting this crap. I'm amazed at how far some of you "gamers" go to create a worse environment. Keep giving money to companies like EA, Beth, ActBlizz and Ubi. They'll treat you good, they do care for consumers. Just you wait for their next move.
---
While I'm not arguing with your message, I will say that most of the games you listed are not indie.
---
He’s just reporting.  It does not seem to be consistent.  I read these posts and logged in to check.  Thank goodness my stuff was there.  I pulled it all out just in case.  I am guessing that this is the #1 fire at Bethesda right now.
---
That image doesn't show anything useful.
---
Country road...take me home....*ascends to outer worlds*
---
Wow thank you I had no idea I'm definitely buying it.
---
I wouldn't play it for free
---
Uh huh.  
---
So what puts you in a position to call people idiots?  Could it be that they are in the right and the people who are upset are simple entitled pissants? What gives you the authority to decide what is the right action or the wrong action?    
---
I mean, you play NBA2K from your post history, a game that went above and beyond with it's advertising of loot boxes and flat out slot machines.  Why should people believe what you say?
---
pay2lose Kappa
---
Lol. I came here to day this. Working as intended.
---
Those cost money, and the times are tight.
---
And dont issue panic statements until we have video or more information.
---
So let me get this straight. This is happening because i'm not crying or whining enough? How did i have anything to do with this? I dont work for them.
---
Na they lied when they said there wouldn’t be this type of shit . They want you on private servers so you don’t see how empty the regular servers are now that outer worlds( more of a fallout game than this PoS) and cod are finally dropping. 
---
Enjoy dressing up and playing house with 7 friends. This games dead
---
Look out for hoard events.
---
I stumble across a legendary roughly ever 4 locations when I roam around. Just get in a road and start walking.
---
So...did you remove the link, or a mod?
---
I'm telling you i feel like Bethesda is doing it on purpose. Ever since F76 beta release it looks like they are trying to fuck up as much as possible and this time...this time it was an ultimate fuck up. They have outdone themselves. I'm not even mad anymore. It's just fun to watch at this point.
---
I said the same thing back when Creation Club first cane out. I had a dream where Bethesda released something that made me angry while I was playing 76. I didn’t know what it was. Now, I can only feel like I was foreshadowing.
---
I mean you’re selling an item for either $15 or $100 and it actually deletes your progress. I’d call that a shit show
---
just deleted 76 for outer worlds, already preloaded. never playing 76 again.
---
It's still up, I just went to it.  Reddit is just beating it up.
---
Had they handled it differently or had a better quality game this backlash would of been a fraction of what it is.
---
What does last year have to do with it?  It's been common behavior for a decade.  Very much so since last Gen consoles were released.  Now it's assumed folks have high bandwidth so bar on minimum viable product fell even further.
---
So we should just sit back and say "yes Bethesda please do that and we'll buy and support this decision"?
---
Or a fisting emoji for cucks like you.. just kidding of course
---
Look up Providence Equity Partners and Bethesda/Zenimax.
---
Forgive the brevity, as I’m on mobile, but the tl;dr is that Providence is invested heavily in Bethesda, and it’s believed their influence is driving the increased monetization efforts of the company, so that they can drive up share prices for an inevitable public offering.
---
Pretty fucked how gamin companies have lost their way.
---
Yeah. I'm not denying it. People really need to get over the idea that being corrected on something means their point is being opposed. I'm just telling people who think the stash limit is the reason we don't have unlimited scrap is not true. We could have had unlimited scrap forever. In reality though, I don't believe they had any intention of having unlimited scrap to begin with. It's not a good design decision to allow people unlimited resources in a survival game. The fact they are selling it just means they know what we all know: most players don't understand how games work or why certain design decisions are made and some lazy or dumb players will pay for something they think is a good feature even if it's bad for the game. The reason to have limits on resources like scrap is so we are forced to find more. That keeps you playing and keeps you using more resources(which is the entire point of hte game game), which in turn has the bonus effect of keeping you in the game longer in order to have more chances to entice you into purchasing cosmetics. It's all just an elaborate balancing act that apparently people are still surprised exists or they just don't think about it.
---
HAHAHAHAAH YES!! YES!!
---
Sometimes you drop a phantom inventory item at login. Check your misc tab for viable scorchbeast dna.
---
Forest horde events probably will have a lower legendary. Or try to piggyback off higher levels as long as you tag it youll get credit. Nuked WS was the fatest way for this but not as common anymore.
---
Oh, now it’s embarrassing? 
---
Now?
---
Poor bethesda the indie game dev
---
Xbox. It did look at first like it was all gone but I got out of the box, got in and it was all there
---
I don’t need to do anything. I stated my case on why I thought the subscription is worth it. You attacked me on presumptions and were totally off base. I made a rebuttal and then you stated your opinion that you believe there isn’t enough content. - your opinion, not mine. I replied to the only factual part and you were annoyed that I didn’t engage the rest. 
---
Your opinion is that there’s not enough endgame content for you. FOR YOU. That doesn’t include me. I told you your opinion is yours and you’re entitled to it and you kept going. 
---
I believe that you cannot comprehend that endgame content is subjective to the user. I’m thoroughly enjoying the game, all of it. 
---
That being said I then decided the polite thing to do was end the conversation. Which did. I didn’t attack you at any point and yet you’re still fuming. 
---
So I’ll say it again. I read your opinion. I disagree. I don’t need to explain why. That’s life. 
---
Goodbye now.
---
Strikes are worse today either. They have to be authorized by the companies and the government. We are becoming slaves again. I never thought I would say that, but our generation is fucking lost. Myself included.
---
Would my weapons and stuff get by if I get everything up to 200% before going in
---
Any chance you will be on today?
---
Todd endorsed FO76, so he shares responsibility for it. If a car salesmen sells me a car that he didn't work on, tells me it runs great, but it breaks down and I have to spend buckets of cash repairing it, he's going to get some of the blame.
---
To take this analogy and attach it to the actual problem, it would be more like this. You purchased a first class ticket with all amenities included. You were seated and given a snack to tide you over until dinner. Then, midway through the trip a flight attendant comes to you and says you now need to get up and move to coach. You will still get dinner, but it wasn't what was promised to you. You still get to take the trip, but not as comfortably as those in first class, where you bought your ticket. The folks up front will continue to gain more and more benefits while your view never changes.
---
THAT is the problem. We were sold a bill of goods that was changed on us after the fact. A bait and switch. And, to some of us, we would be ok with this new development if the fee gave us more for the money. More content, a moddable experience, maybe even offline play. Well worth it. "Free" Atoms, the same stale, buggy environment and the same snails pace of content release, no thank you. If you are going to make us pay for premium services, make them premium. Better yet, keep your promises and show your customers you are actually listening, not twisting our words to serve your bottom line.
---
Ah yes the old believe it all because I'm mad mentality. Proof? Ok you dont need that I guess.
---
He was an ex-Googler. He did it out of conscience and did not exchange it for money on purpose.
---
both open world shooters with rpg mechanics
---
Maybe they quit, lmao
---
On right now
---
"Look, man. When I sold you the car, I said it drives. I didn't say it could drive forward. Sure, it only drives in a circle but all I said was that it drives."
---
Others, I also would help on pc
---
Wait the community played and supported the game?
---
They won't address it, they will throw out some false and unverifiable claim about how their fans are "loving the new private servers" "a smashing success" I think about one video of some Bethesda devs had a controlled talk session shortly after 76 launched. One of them actually said how he was proud "that there was no unscheduled down time. " Twilight zone me thinks.
---
Fallout 3 was extremely subpar, basic uninteresting story, absolutely godawful boss, godawful ending that basically just acts as a cinematic since liberty prime does everything, you’re forced into working with the brotherhood of steel and don’t mention that shitty fake out being able to put the virus into the water it doesn’t even work and it just drains your karma, the game is just all around holding your hand through everything. Plus you can have Fawkes and be unkillable since he’s unkillable. Very very subpar.
---
They've made it clear that private servers are going to be a paid experience. Pete Hines has said several times that private servers will always be through Bethesda. Wouldn't hold your breath- why release this ability for free when they've already monetized it?
---
Why would I? I’ve literally seen my shit up and poof out of existence before. Why would I need proof to believe Bethesda is just that buggy?
---
Games as a service. That's what happened. And we let them get away with it.
---
Vote with your wallets and if you get the chance to go to one of those joke E3 conferences they hold (or some other event)...  BOO those liars Pete and Todd off the stage.
---
I accept that dingus dubbing, but I'm sorry, it's hard to have any sympathy for people that fell for a predatory subscription service. literally google fallout 76 right now and even Forbes and IGN are calling it a joke
---
all signs with everything in this game point to broken, for over a year now - it shouldn't be a surprise that the "private" servers are also broken and not worth the price
---
very true comments. it's a reflection of Western society I guess, you pay for a better experience.
---
We have to understand, Bethesda HAS to price this mode a little higher than is comfortable. In order for it to be a premium experience, the subscription player base needs to be much smaller. If we all felt it was good value, then we'd be in the same situation as we are now with cranky servers..
---
Lots of rpg games have extra paid for subscriptions and we've known fallout was getting one for awhile, so why you all kicking off now like it's never been done before. It's getting on everyone's nerves no one makes you play. They did something you don't like their not making you buy it and it doesn't effect your gameplay if you don't but it so just get over it already. Move on with your lives play a new game. Anything!!!
---
Support mods. Let us modders fix, only option IMO. They clearly have zero idea what we need an want even though the fourms both Reddit an and Offical are flooded daily with stuff.
---
Will do. Don't remember getting DNA, or if so it was a long time ago.
---
Bu-bye, Bu-bye, Bu-bye, Bu-bye......
---
And you're never getting a good multiplayer experience, so why name call?
---
Yep, im just debating rent or buy on it.
---
Okay. 
---
I'm actually going to backtrack a bit. They didn't actually lie. They said they wouldn't charge for content updates. Adding a subscription service that let's you choose who can enter the world, and gives you more storage for crafting isn't a DLC or new game content. People are upset because they expected private servers to be fully customizable, ie changing loot tables, drop rates, spawn rates, mod support etc. BGS never said that's what private servers would be. People are angry because they assumed incorrectly what would be done.
---
None
---
Just like the nukashine that is on ground by my camp all the time lol
---
Yeah I don't understood the Epic outrage. Besides exclusive games (which isn't that big of a deal), wtf is the issue? It's just another launcher.
---
He announced the game with full fanfare...
---
Ahhahahha very funny :) and damn right
---
Akin to Fallout?
---
Zero open world exploration? 
---
It may be a great game, but it's not a Fallout game. Part of what makes the Wasteland so engaging is the ability to pick a direction and wander. Where there's always a possibility of something weird and unexpected over the next hill.
---
Great new IP? Sure. Fallout in space? Nope.
---
I too wish to win the Fallout 76.
---
true.
---
 **it’s all free after launch** , cept when it's not
---
Forest horde events, got it.
---
More likely it died from the Reddit hug of death as it's back up
---
Got copyright infringement from my ISP when I clicked the link
---
Ofc I didn't, are you insane? Knew this was going to suck since day 1. I want these things to stop. I've stopped buying games from ActBlizz, EA, Ubi since 2015, and Beth since the creator club crap. I'm trying to talk with my money, but there are so many people wanting to buy something JUST BECAUSE, that it seems my "protests" will always be in vain...
---
Are the games you're referring to are full priced?
---
When people evaluate how good the deal is they seem to keep leaving out that 1650 atoms for the monthly subscription is like a 50% discount no the regular price. I'm contemplating the subscription simply because the atoms are much cheaper. I'm actually not at all interested in any other feature. If they bumped this to 2000 atoms I'd be in for sure.
---
I see a lot of players online whenever I jump on a server. ... sure, a sinking ship
---
Come on op... We know it's you now ;-)
---
I actually don't know. It's something like ScythxXY, where X and Y are numbers. I think it might be 68 or 86. I've sent him a text, so I'll let you know when I hear back.
---
If you can't wait around, that's fine. Real life comes first.
---
Subreddits are very small portions of the playerbase. That's why they just use us for idea farming and don't give a shit about us, really. We aren't statistically significant enough to matter.
---
Gross
---
Did you try the outer *wilds*? Its amazing. Nothing like the outer worlds but like my favorite indie game ever.
---
I mean for me personally I’ve owned every Bethesda game since as early as possible. I still was wary of buying the game when it came out but I just want it from a collectors stand point. I don’t buy into the pay to win addons I see coming out now though. Haven’t bought a game from them since fallout 4. Bit amused at your anger on how other people spend their own money though.
---
I missed that one, will add it to the list of bugs for it...
---
Okay, I understand what you are saying, and I agree I don’t want to accept it.
---
But it is just too bad. There are too many players who are going to buy it, so the rest of us just have to suck it up.
---
If sitting outside of Todd’s house with a pitchfork would have any effect I’d say go ahead, but it just won’t. It is something we are forced to accept, or go play another game that doesn’t have it.
---
I just want to know how of what they are offering worth $100 to you? To use the server you have to be online. It's not like Minecraft Realms which to me provides a better value. The server implementation here just doesn't give the value. 
---
I don't intend for this to be mean, but I don't see the value. My personal opinion of you gave me the option between Fallout 1st or Gamespass/Ultimate I would get more value from Gamepass over F1st. I say this as someone that enjoyed F76 for a bit.
---
&gt;damn it must be pretty taxing for the other team members who had nothing to do with 76
---
Can you imagine the people who *are* working on 76 in Austin? I gotta say at this point they're probably embarrassed to put this on their resume.
---
ugh it would be the last NW unlock!
---
no, it has it own list of games which you can check [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/games#PCgames)
---
So no lose of scrap when transferring from a private to a public server? May I also ask how your experience have been? Have you encountered any situation where enemies are already dead or places where constant materials spawn already looted?
---
Silence, but ITV dropped regularly at the same time each thursday and now its 1 hour past that time so I figured it may drop tomorrow/never
---
Technically, that still makes it "unlimited".
---
No worries!
---
I am happy. Negative press for 76 is good press in my book. The state of the sub is funny to watch and read. I don’t agree with the Bethesda tactics but hey, I was never really into the game to begin with. It’s fun just being a casual popping in and out
---
If someone wants to hoard plastic and screws let them.  I’ll grab my pitchfork when I can hand pick my legendary rolls with atoms.  Everyone has their threshold and a scrap box with a tent is far from mine.
---
Zenimax is trying to go public with a buyout. All of the BS that Bethesda has been doing for years is in direct correlation with this plan. 
---
Doom and Doom 2 having a Beth.net login to increase user numbers after being 25 plus years old. 
---
Creation Club being retrofitted to every major game they have made in the last decade. 
---
Fallout 76 being a monetisation mess. 
---
Single player first touted and then completely abandoned.
---
Games as a service and a cornered off digital storefront with limited refund options. 
---
Bethesda wants to be EA and Activision. It's happening and you can actually see it. They dont care about making great games anymore. They just want numbers.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
You heard the guy, its your fault! So its justified that you pay Beth more money so that you can play the game, not how it released, but as its meant to be played. 
---
Wait...
---
2, released in 1998, is one of the best. I personally place 1 above it for personal reasons but they’re both at the top for me. I will grant you the fact that there are some reasonably good side quests such as seeing Harold again in the Oasis, and maybe the Declaration of Independence quest, and Andale, but otherwise there are just a ton of grab quests and quests that rely on the game’s location to be interesting, and even then they aren’t that interesting. They chose the location and built a story around it instead of crafting a story and choosing the perfect location for it. 3 may be nostalgic for those who played it years ago but the overall color scheme of the game is pretty gross to look at, and the music just isn’t that good either. There’s more I could list but my recitation is starting. Will be back later.
---
I can't imagine how that could go missed in the uneventful update.  /s
---
I would suspect you are wrong since the site is up and running.
---
I usually do them solo unless someone wants to come with.  Lol the first couple can be kinda rough until you figure out your own procedure.  I've ran them both as a rifleman and commando build and had good luck with either build. 
---
 Stealth really helps if you are set up that way.  With stealth you can knock out the robots and turrents before they even detect you.  Also the robot spawns are less than running with a group.  
---
I usually run them slow taking out all the turrents and robots before taking on the task needed in each area.  In the last room, I usually knock out all the robots and turrents before starting the launch prep.  I've also found if I don't run around the room after the prep has started and stay in one area, most of the robots spawn from one point making it easier.  
---
Depending on how smooth the server is, it usually takes me about 30 minutes or so.  Haha I'm definitely not setting any speed records but it works for me.
---
Lol if it was 2% and there are over 200,000 people on this sub that would mean that over 10,000,000 play the game . I got news for you bud , if that many people were playing , they wouldn’t have to pull this money grab . I’d be surprised if they have over 15k players after this weekend
---
Yeah I think they will try and ignore it.
---
Casual
---
That entirely ignores twitter (it was trending), Facebook, YouTube (it was everywhere), their forums, etc. the majority don’t like it. A much larger portion of the players that still log on don’t care and will buy it. That doesn’t mean this is popular.
---
They already have their own sub, it's r/Fallout.
---
Let me know, curious and will log the bug if it's not
---
Lol this shitfest is just getting better and better.
---
Wow released with bugs. Who saw that coming ?
---
That is awesome.
---
You took a page out of my book....
---
This subreddit is more entertaining than the game. Always new content here.
---
The ability coming to you soon if you subscribe to fallout 1st
---
Seems what usually happens to suggestions of late
---
I get what your saying but try to go and shop for server company that charges less than $10-$12 monthly to rent server space. I still think though that this subscription thing is really poorly timed and pretty dumb overall.
---
"Inside The Vault will now work like a paid newsletter - you can get your monthly subscription for just 9.99$ in falloutfirst.com" - Bethesda Game Studios
---
Drunk me finds.... This funny. Cheers!
---
What, since when does cod have char stats?  It's like saying bf or d2 are rpg's.
---
As for dialog, typically it's just one or two meningful branches that change anything.  So replays are mostly doing the same trivial dialog choices over and over with effect on game.  A true branching story like Detroit Become Human are extremely rare.
---
don't be shill, thanks to Obsidian fallout 1,2 and new vegas was legendary, fallout 4 didn't have shit and 76 didn't have shit in that shit
---
Right?  
---
They know there is an entire group of people like me collecting the data and calling them when this stuff happens.
---
Bethesda and obsidian didnt create fallout. My opinion 3 was better than NV.
---
Upvoted because let us fight hordes of sentinelly autonomous suits of power armor
---
We said $8 per month. Not $100 per month
---
Hope you like it!
---
I pity the fool that subscribed.
---
I adore 2 so I will respect your opinion about 3 while disagreeing very very much so

like I said, but it apparently got deleted.  
---
If you think its wort it, I won't stop you.
---
I've always been behind people not following the mainstream, I'm just pointing out my personal opinion.  
---
It was just merely a small joke what I commented in the first place.
---
Hello, Xbox player here and I usually pop by each new patch with a few weird firsthand experiences, and one hour playing patch 14 is no different.
---
Visual issue: forest scout armor shows the graphic for urban scout armor in inspect/vendor/pip boy display. The armor appears correctly on your character, but viewed in any menu individually shows the sprite for urban variant.
---
Another favorites wheel bug: pulling up the emote wheel sometimes brings up the favorites wheel instead. Choosing a weapon in this instance will display the corresponding emote and not change weapons, appears to be a visual error.
---
Hunger and hydration: once again, a fresh patch has brought an issue previously rectified numerous times of hunger and hydration draining faster than normal. This bug usually affects fusion drain rate as well however I am not a power armor player so I cannot confirm that.
---
Yeah he fell for a pretty obvious scam. But we, \~*The Gamers\~ ,* should really direct our anger at Badthesda, not some poor shmuck you got riped off
---
If you can't argue with the way this game is or how it's treating it's players that says more about you than me. To each their own no malice. You game how you want to.
---
Eh thems the breaks
---
Helpfull really
---
Also have “Special junk” that can only be accessed through a costly subscription
---
Another idea
---
Place the vendors slightly too high then offer them stairs at a price
---
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
Oh, they can. 
---
It just works! Little lies, stunning shows!
---
I wish I could give you 2 upvotes for this comment.... I'm 98 in Nuclear Winter, was pushing for the Hellfire paint before Wastelanders... but yesterday I couldn't even bring myself to fire it up. What's the point if there's definitely going to be paywalls in the future. Not worth my time, because this really isn't worth my money.
---
I like to enjoy my games, not yell at them because of stupid bugs that make no sense that've been in the game since launch **and** paying extra money on top *just* to experience the said horrendous bugs.
---
It is a travesty for them to think this is ok. After many have paid the full price and even more for this game. Then drop in value like a rock, then have to pay more money to even play it. 
---
Likewise the new cod, not getting it. Last new game I purchased was RE2 remake
---
Aww :.( bye Frank.    
---
we will remember you &lt;3
---
Im interested
---
If you cancel you can still take things out of the stash. Just can't add anymore in. The bug people are reporting is when you're logging into Adventure or Private, then hard closing the game and re-logging into the other world, then loosing their scrap which was put in the stash before changing.
---
OMG R O F L M A O
---
btw it's still up....
---
someone needs to make a meme of where this scrap goes, and it cutfades over to the skyrim scene, whoops!
---
Thanks for the reply mate. Well, in the grand scheme of things, nothing really does matter. If someone walks up to you, knocks your phone out of your hands, it smashes on the floor and then they slap you a new arsehole, should we chalk that up to “nothing really matters”? The hell no. If we all die, the universe goes on, but that’s not an excuse to take shit lying down. 
---
The fun thing about this free as fuck world is that when you don’t like something you can say no and you can make a change, sure it won’t be remembered through history but that’s not the point. The point is, to make the finite time you have on this planet a little better. That’s more than what a lot of people who suffered and died throughout history were able to do for themselves. I’m Aussie, I live a free life in my nice squishy country, but that doesn’t mean I’ll sit down and shrug my shoulders when people try to take advantage of my long time loyalty and trust. 
---
Like you said, you can’t change the world, but a group of people, with the same common goal can at least make a positive change regarding the things they care about. 
---
I love games, I enjoy this game. This is something that I care about. This is something that I want to see change. I have told you my opinion and you have told me yours. You can be a part of a positive change (not paying $100 per year for something you already paid for is pretty positive for most people) which means you can be a part of something positive and you can be a part of something that can be changed. 
---
Do something small. Chuck a dollar in a change jar and tweet Bethesda that you’d rather spend your money there than on something that isn’t worth it. Buy yourself something tangible that won’t be taken from you when you decide you can’t or don’t want to keep paying. Tell them to work for their money. Don’t give them an easy time. 
---
Did we get an easy time, playing through the bugs and playing a game that wasn’t sold to us? I don’t think so. We always stick with Bethesda but they aren’t sticking with us. 
---
I’m taking time to reply to all you beautiful people  who aren’t sending me rhymes about chicken dippers because I’m not a Bethesda hater, I’m a free lovin, jet slamming fallout junkie and I want my monies worth.
---
So step up mate, by not purchasing this underworked bs, you are doing something. Your taking a vote. A vote with your wallet.
---
what? who paid?
---
Behind a keypad door you have to give me a 2* legendary to get the password to
---
I actually almost bought fallout 1st last night until I saw this thanks mate!
---
Considering they never even got around to just simply adding an option to force 1080p rendering for Skyrim on the PS4 Pro to get a whopping 30fps, I wouldn't hold my breath for a decent fix.
---
I salute the brave anon who stepped up to be the hero we all need in these trying times. We will never forget you.
---
That's just "free healthcare &amp; education" tax.
---
Watch out what you write, coz they may pick up your idea for real just like the fridges 😂
---
The writing is on the wall , if they don’t jump ship then that’s on them . This is how capitalism is supposed to work . If a company is shitty then it should die and another will grow from its ashes
---
The respawns depend on your own timer. I haven’t played with it long enough yet to test that one out. I have to work irl too ;)
---
Nope. I looked up the site and it’s still searchable/pops up. Might be different for others.
---
Bethesda is like one of the corporations in outer worlds now. They are really going for all the irony points.
---
Hmmm, I'm not used to the /s, but it was sarcasm about the old player count and the current one
---
Then don’t pay for it. Vote with your wallet
---
Except it deleted those scraps from scrapped junk items.
---
Well if that is the case, then I take back everything I said above.  You are paying money for a private instance that is only active when you are in it and not a private server and that is just asinine.
---
Hate to say it.... but you kinda earned it. Why would you have faith in Beth at this point? 
---
You honestly think Wastelanders isn't going to be a buggy mess of a letdown?
---
I don’t play fallout, found this on popular, but if they ruin Skyrim 2 (TES 6) with this shit I’m gonna be heated.
---
Good for you
---
Well that read made my day lmao
---
Fallout 5 will sell more copies than ever. All will be well. Lol
---
Add content I haven't already paid for.
---
Nice. I hope your mother got criminally charged.
---
I did some research into that one and apparantly they aren't legendaries. They just drop legendary items.
---
Because everyone at Bethesda is in a fallout shelter.
---
Curious where all the "community managers" are....
---
Still works fine for me?
---
Ahhh I see what you did there.
---
The outer worlds is gonna be amazing
---
You are taxed to move in this game.
---
I can see how its an infinite scrapbox, it never fills up cause it just deletes everything.  Thats the true 200iq move
---
&gt;It is a travesty for them to think this is ok. 
---
Yes it is.   Bethesda is running out of defenders.   For years now, there have been Bethesda complainers and critics, but there were also people who defended them.  This Fallout 1st debacle seems to have provoked nearly universal hate, with the detractors and defenders all on the same side.
---
"Democracy.... is non-negotiable."
---
taxation IS theft.
---
I don't think there's any intention to release another fallout any time soon. BGS wanted 76 to be an active game for many many years. Of course, they also didn't want to get crucified by media outlets...
---
I could see it if there was more going on, or I was in a group of regular players. I'll wait for now.
---
16 times bye bye Frank looool
---
The part where they really screwed up is the fact that most of their fanbase was from single player games so trying to do what ea and Activision do hurts them way more
---
People using multiple accounts don't need your service, because they trade f2f and completely w/o any risk.
---
You didn't look at the next page, there is a minimal charge upgrade that allows you to remove the junk from the unlimited stash. If you didn't purchase that, its like an unlimited garbage disposal
---
Cool story, bro. I'm sure you can provide more evidence than completely contradictory posts, right?
---
I would *hate* to think that posters in here, or yootoobers, would ever be less than honest, just to support their narrative.
---
...you get that that saying is meant for when the game isn't optional, right?
---
That's cool. We get 1,600 atoms a month anyways.
---
Nah thanks, I'm good.
---
Nuking other bases is a feature. They might put it behind a paywall soon, so better enjoy it while we can.
---
what fixes are people paying for vs. it being a convience? 
---
And you still aren't any better, you still gave money to a developer that is actively trying to monetize the game.  You shouldn't have to get loot boxes to improve your team. 
---
You are just as much of the problem to "quality gaming" as anyone you would accuse of here.
---
Paying to lose all my stuff in a game sure is a clever move :B
---
whatever man i think it is cool addition if it was cheaper, but the price that it is now, no way.
---
I think the problem is, the mad people are much more likely to comment on the issue than people that really don't care enough to moan (myself included)
---
Well, I had 70k weight at some point which wasnt too bad. But the ones that had millions did experince and create lagg. Yes I heard about how the one line of text shouldnt be a problem, but it still was. The duping came after and while that was funny in itself (patched 1,5 - 2 months too late lol!), the server crash dupes where even after that mess.
---
So I'm guessing you bought the subscription too and feel criticized?
---
ooooof.
---
This is just Forbes clickbait, lets wait for some facts :)
---
Inside articles normally detail upcoming events, yesterday was patch notes and everything current and new in the game, although that is something I considered, maybe with all the news yesterday they didn’t feel it necessary to release an article today and it’s just coincidence that there’s no article following a bunch of backlash
---
I mean, It's pretty much standard price for server rental
---
Of course don't you know this is how u/Anon4567895 and all other deniers are being [right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecgdwhc8gkw)
---
I'll be honest, I'm not gonna be an asshole and mock anyone who bought it, but I am pretty much only here because this is like, fucking comically ridiculous at this point.
---
Remember when they gave us for free the gift emote that the community asked for? Good times.
---
Now they took a similar community suggestion and are selling paperbag skins in the Atom Shop. This is so sad, Alexa play Country Roads.
---
Why would they post only to get abused?
---
People here are full of shit
---
We also need a bench in the tent that lets us break down looted weapons and armor.
---
Or not. The NCR ranger armor was guaranteed to sell like cupcakes if it hit the store and it was requested a lot back when almost all there was in the store were fallout 4 assets. Now, even the people who wanted it will either be too affected by sunken cost fallacy to understand what’s happening to them or they’ll begrudgingly pay the subscription to get it. They’re not satisfying either side with the way they go about it.
---
My thing on fo3/fonv perks was that they were front loaded at character creation.  If you didn't pick optimal stats right then you were hosed.  These days it's not that annoying, back then it was almost a given ya needed to buy the strategy guide or end up hosed on late perks.
---
Gunplay was the core change for fo3, it got a lot of flak making the transition to FPS from the old guard.
---
&gt; Inside articles normally detail upcoming events
---
They have released some half assed ones in the past. I.E. "Players have killed x-number of supermutants since release!"
---
Had a baby recently and haven’t been able to play in a long time, so please forgive my ignorance. But could you point me in the general direction of info on the update that has fans so upset?
---
it is if you have the means
---
*this post was made by blizzard gang*
---
Washington post said something about it I’m pretty sure.
---
Your post 98 days ago is more pathetic
---
Yeah, but you have to pay for it ;-)
---
I mean. Its a Bethesda ip. People will defend them even if they killed their families
---
This ain’t Hong Kong lmao
---
F76 is doomed but i refuse to buy a shitty rip off
---
*Outer Worlds, take me home... to a game, I beloooong...*
---
Holy shit some people in this thread have actually opened there wallets for this. It really worries me that people like this exist in my world. I really hope they aren't licensed drivers.
---
&gt;so they didn't make weapons degrade faster just so they could sell repair kits shortly after?
---
I've never once bought the basic repair kits as I'm simply drowning in the advanced repair kits that I get from events. I have so damn many I just drop them now to save weight
---
I wouldn't give them my money, either. Epic exclusivity ... Nah.
---
AAA gaming is dead to me. They're all thieves, liars, and worse.
---
I've got a whole shelf full of $60 games I paid for that sucked ass and got uninstalled in under 30 minutes. 
---
Roughly equal to the amount I spent in the last year on shittastic hollywood blockbusters that I wish I could unwatch. 
---
Others would argue some of those games are classics forever cemented into wikipedia as the best games ever. Those movies...well they were called blockbusters afterall.
---
There is not enough "yes" in the entire world for this
---
30 hours of gameplay and singleplayer, no thanks
---
Bet you'll keep post on these subs though.
---
" Full disclosure, never bought this game "  
---
and stopped reading right there.
---
People who willingly enable shitty, destructive things don't deserve to be rewarded for it, no.
---
It may be that their scrape is going into someone else's scrap box. I found additional stuff in mine that I didn't put there.
---
I'm on PC, and Wastelanders is going to be more than one month away. Good suggestion for others, though.
---
100 dollars a year is hardly bending someone over a table. In fact who is bending us over is internet companies. High speed internet is free in some countries. The water company. I mean water literally falls from the sky.
---
Leaders are 1 star legendary. I think so, because they have 1* next to description
---
I admit that this is indeed a real possibility.   We will just have to wait and see.   I know it's a vocal minority, but I think it does not bode well for Bethesda that they are running out of defenders here.  For years now, Bethesda has had defenders and detractors.  This Fallout 1st thing has brought universal condemnation from both sides.
---
Don't hate, this is comedy gold
---
Get your money back bud. No joke
---
Karma’s a bitch
---
Buyer beware!!
---
Ive been playing at least 25-30 hours a week since launch dedicatedly. I have less than 5 straws left. Soon itll be the last straw.
---
Hopefully she didn't. I'm glad you enjoy your coporate overlords
---
1. Patch Notes (they do that for each update)
---
2. ZAX (they do it for NW with each patch recently)
---
3. Atomic Shop Update (each tuesday/update day)
---
4. Fallout 1st (coz it went live)
---
None of those is similar to Inside The Vault in which they talk about the future, plans and details of some events like Fasnacht, Meat Week or PCA
---
Contradictory post what other posts have i made? The obly post ive ever made on fallout 76 is how i lost 600lbs of my junk and how sad i am about it.

I'm not losing any sleep over it. Haven't played the game since launch and got excited to have a private world to save my workshop progress with scrapbox as an added bonus... come to find out that the private world doesn't have persistent workshop progress (despite the patch notes saying that it does) and the game ate up all of the scrap I would have used to build with anyway... guess I'll just go back to not playing this game... no big deal... I'm already over it... HERE I COME OUTER WORLDDSSSSSSSSSS
---
For any of those games, were you charged $60 up front, and then made to pay 100$ a year for a non-garbage version of them?
---
Joined? They were already part of it
---
And make sure you don't come back.

I’m really close to the last straw here
---
The account is a year old, he likely made it to stay up to date on fallout news, people are actually passionate, not everyone is devoid of the milk of human kindness.
---
If you save the money you would spend on this shite service, you could buy terraria, destiny 2 (free excellent looter shooter which is this in FO universe), warframe (better looter shooter than this and free again), and Path of Exile (a perfect diablo 2 looter which is 100% free and they put out continual expansions every 6 months [unlike this shit product XD]).
---
You could literally get Witcher 3 at the same price you would spend on this stupid subscription if you waited until it was on sale. You are actually wasting your money on a product that has continually failed to meet player expectations; Even failed to meet content expectations. 
---
It baffles me how people can justify this. There are so many better loot games on the market, but because this is set in the FALLOUT UNIVERSE OMG GIVE BETHESDA MONEY they think this shit game is worth a damn.
---
Y’all enjoy! I’ll keep on playing 76!
---
It’s a paywall for items that should of been in game at release . Enjoy the dead game
---
Do you know what the requirements are for serverside hosting of this game in particular -- because if you don't; it's pretty hard to set a price on what an operable server will cost.
---
Hope your ready for a butt load of nocturnal limb dmg weapons then. 🤣
---
MFW call of duty mobile is less shitty than this...
---
Those are additions that bigger and better company give for free/one dollar. This is just them milking whatever fanbase they have left before going under. It's sad.
---
That's cool, have an upvote my dude :D
---
Yeah it's what I'm thinking as well.
---
Hardcore mode changed the dynamic of the entire game for me, particularly as it relates to combat. The increased lethality and inability to save at whim added so much weight to decisions, definitely added a depth to the game that, as a casual AF gamer, I’d never experienced. Couldn’t recommend hardcore mode high enough.
---
I hate the scrapbox, but that is just wrong. I'm already enjoying my friends' private servers.
---
Also, I think Bethesda is doing as much to help The Outer Worlds as Obsidian's marketing team. Their decisions are mind-bogglingly stupid. I'm truly amazed right now. 
---
I think Bethesda is reaping what they sowed at this point. They decided to announce a subscription service that currently appears to not work very well right when Obsidian is releasing The Outer Worlds? Who thought that was a good idea? How?
---
Mad lad
---
Were they though? Whenever I play New Vegas and start fresh I always, always, pick "Wild Wasteland" which other than putting some easter eggs in game is pretty much a bum stat that doesn't benefit you as a player game play wise. To this day I've never so much as even read a strategy guide for any Fallout game.
---
You have no fucking clue what you're talking about, for the 3rd time.
---
Private servers in every other game have been a separate instanced from official/retail servers. What happens on them has zero effect on retail servers. Bethesda announced private SERVERS at their announcement for 76. 
---
What we got were private sessions. And if you check recent news they aren't even private.
---
Please educate yourself before you respond again.
---
You aint lying
---
The bug hasn't happened to me fortunately... yet!! Haha. I'm gonna do a massive junk run tonight, workshops the lot. It's gonna be fun! Outer World's can wait! HaHa
---
I would but I don’t anyone would get it
---
Eh, not like you could use it much early game.  I figured it was to give the player a hammer they could use in tough spot.  Seemed like a nice option on 2nd run, I didn't have a core/ammo supply chain worked out until end of first run.
---
I haven’t laughed this hard in ages
---
Thank you! 🙏
---
They certainly did offer as free. Maybe they didn't mean to, and I don't know how you would know that. But I got it as well as a friend of mine who did. Idk how you put a banner over something as "FREE" and not mean to.
---
I’d be happy to, here is a link to the new subscription service released yesterday: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch basically its a paid service costing 12.99 USD OR 17.99 CAD a month that provides you with a private world to play on, along with unlimited junk stash and other bonuses that people wanted in the game from launch
---
Congrats by the way!
---
I get what he was going for, but Microsoft is a Billion dollar corporation.
---
So wait, are you saying you can't pay real world money to save in game currency and time?
---
Exit, cause to be clear, if that's what you're saying, it's a lie.
---
??????
---
# This specifically?  
---
Honestly torn...  
---
**This could be another Atomic Shop Team mistake....**  
---
It's clear people from the "AtomicShop" side of things have access to editing the ESM, which from previous massive issues (I think every major patch has had several big atomic shop bugs caused by that team) and either Q/A isn't catching the issues or their content skips the standard Q/A process.  
---
This could be another major Atomic Shop F\*\*\*up where they intended to clone the variables for the new Communist Collectron that returns useful items like Drugs, Food, etc, and they wanted to reduce the chance for balance purposed but completely botched the job.  
---
**This could also be another Stealth Nerf someone snuck in, like Watago and WhiteSprings.....**
---
Straight from the Dev's mouth the were unaware that the Watago robots can no longer spawn as Legendary NPC's (Keywords were added to lock out the chance) and WhiteSprings will no longer respawn properly..  
---
It's happened before and will happen again, a rogue Dev / Team-member sneaks in "Balance" changes they think are appropriate.
---
**This could be Corporate Greed......**  
---
Bethesda, no offense to anyone not responsible, has gotten caught multiple times either failing to live up to promises, flat out breaking them, pulling "Bait and Switch" tactics (including flat out illegal sales techniques)  
---
Have it operate at an above average level for a month until people stop raging about the broken promise it represents, then scale it back after people have gotten accustomed to it and hope they don't notice.      
---
    
---
# The general ongoing failure to meet the standards set forth by nearly every other major MMO in the history of MMOs?  
---
Could be mismanagement, could be a resource issue they don't want to admit to, could be they were unprepared for the volume of issues that pop up when you are forced to resolved them or otherwise be on the hook for refunds.  
---
I could also be greed.  
---
# All that said...  
---
The Dev's and content creators I met were passionate and really wanted people to love what they were making...  
---
They appeared to love what they were doing, and when they showed us Nuclear Winter honestly seemed nervous...
---
But good intentions and desires won't fix or counterbalance the problems people face.     
---
We are human, we all make mistakes, hell my grammar and spelling is horrific and I need a copy editor for anything I plan to submit professionally, but I admit my failings and try to find work arounds and preemptively do damage control, and they are failing there.
---
that was excactly my vision lol! ty for that laugh :)
---
Same here, it installed for me overnight!!
---
I can totally see where you are coming from. This is a tiny thing. A very unimportant thing. But the fact that just gets me is, it’s a product that we paid for and the promises we were given were pure hypocrisy. When we enjoy something and we spend our money on it and those promises aren’t just ignored but are turned into a blatant money grab, it’s not ok. Everything we asked for as come to fruition, just behind a pay wall. One which we were promised would never occur. Bethesda said “we won’t cross that line” and they did. 
---
We are consumers, this is a product and this conduct is unacceptable. 
---
There are kids,(oh god think of the children! Good one Goose that’ll get em) who, unlike us, can’t afford another game for some time. It might have been for their Birthday or Christmas (other holidays are available). 
---
 I couldn’t imagine being that 10 yr old watching the live stream, dreaming of the adventures, waiting for the content and being faced with a paywall which I was ever eluded to. 
---
I have honestly been questioning whether or not I’m living in the old days of when you at least just owned the proper content of a game. But then I keep going back to the point that, no, they made promises which they now won’t keep.
---
I've said it a million times already, Zenimax Online Studios (the ones behind The Elder Scrolls Online) should've handled the game.
---
The true question is why are you and thousands playing this game
---
The whole sink cost thing isn't even relevant
---
I heard this only happens with pc players? Can anyone confirm?
---
I heard they will be doing a stream with Final Render today though.  I bet they will not acknowledge the backlash, as usual.
---
I mean the idea is to send msg, the design is personal anyone can pick this up and customize it however they want
---
Thank you, and thank you for the heads up!! It’s a shame they went in that direction. Kind of a steep cost for a lot of folks I would think. And I was really looking forward to Wastelanders.
---
The ride never ends
---
Hey man i play the game for multiple hours each day.  I want the new content so🤷🏻‍♂️.  No need to hate on those that are willing to pay for it.
---
-4 downvoted... gotta love the butthurt... soooo much salt...lol
---
Wastelanders had me so hopeful. I truly thought Bethesda was trying to improve the game, and defended them against hate.
---
Fool me once...
---
&gt;  fallout 1,2 and new vegas was legendary 
---
said you.
---
Yes I am. Large Fantasy games have been doing this for years. Buy the game plus pay for a subscription for extra Worlds weapons ect... I think the problem people are having is because they don't play the kinds of games that have been doing this for awhile so people are throwing their toys out the pram. But seriously if you wanted fallout 76 to carry on and adding all this new content it has to be paid for. Some of us will buy it some of us won't but bitching about it is just child like. Everytime I've popped into reddit it's grown ass people whining like little kids when the game isn't making you do anything you can keep playing the exact same way you always have but are pissy because others get extras for paying extra! People just need to move on.
---
why do you think your opinion matters my man when you haven't played the game?
---
signed by a level 142 dweller who now fucking hates bethesda
---
At least there’s still CD Project Red and Obsidian Entertainment! They won’t let us down!
---
Why are u even playing? 
---
You should have left a week in
---
If you're quitting, I'd suggest passing your stuff along to any friends who aren't leaving or even handing them out to random people.
---
Better someone gets some use out of it if you're truly done with Bethesda over this.
---
After the server closes though you are able to hop back in to find things reloaded. Had that happen for a stealthboy spawn. I had to hop off temporarily to take care of the trash, came back roughly twenty minutes later and it was there.
---
We know this is you Todd you not low
---
Buy 20 level up kits, just 1.99 each. So cheap!
---
Is the msg gross or the design or both be specific lol
---
Was planning on getting it anyways, I don't even have Failout 76 lol.
---
Quit supporting this
---
But no open world exploration.
---
100% agree.  I've bought the game (full price / pre beta ) for xbox and my desktop at work.  Then bought it for a friend I met online when his disk broke AND a copy for his girlfriend.  We all play together.  I've bought tons of atoms. This was my first experience ever playing online and I love it 
---
I have no problem spending money on something I want but this was the tipping point. I mean literally I just bought a car two weeks ago that they only made 20 of last year.
---
I'm just trying to decide if I should buy borderlands 3 because it is multi-user or should I go to outer worlds tomorrow?
---
Who are you kidding dude? It’s been a year and FO76 still sucks. I know corporate has plenty of responsibility here but, don’t act like the devs are really doing their best here.
---
Pete, you're not fooling anyone here
---
*** Legendary dude.
---
If it ruins the economy? GOOD! The player economy is RIDICULOUS and needs a kick down. Plus all the caps are in legendaries and rare drops. Not in anything that can be crafted.
---
Corporate has seen all the fuckups they presumably caused for the past year
---
Whats one more? *game dies*
---
its been like this forever
---
thats the way it works a one star hast the chance to drop one star items
---
two star has a chance to drop either a one star or a two star and so on
---
God knows how all of you didn't leave after week 1
---
This game has always been garbage but it’s pretty sad some of you are just realizing this. 
---
Whatever it takes to break the habit I guess. Just stop supporting Bethesda, I know we have some beloved IPs they are holding hostage but at some point you just can’t negotiate with terrorists.
---
For every one defender and one opposer there’s 8 people who don’t care about the fight.  From a business stand point Big B is clearly burning their bridge with the opposer, making extra money off the defender and in no way effecting the other 8.  It’s a good business move on their part.
---
Copypasta....
---
&gt;Production  was not massive, but if you harvested Scrap vs Junk you could collect  ALLOT more over time (not faster, just had to check it less) so it's a  problem for some who figured that out.  
---
&gt;So rather than farm resources they could just grab the scrap and call it a day.
---
It was actually pretty solid and some people had used it to replace basic farming for repairs and upgrades..
---
Oh come on. Just because they are all neck and neck in a bad pr contest doesn't mean EA is any better. Lets not forget Anthem, or their Guinness record for the most downvoted comment in Reddit history.
---
I can have an opinion on the sub and still give it a try. The fact tbat i got effected by the bug today has no relation to how i felt about it. You can call bullshit all you want. Im still mad and my stash is still 600lbs lighter.
---
100€ in EU.
---
You know I want to be offended but that would seriously cut down on my lube budget. Probably enough to subscribe to fallout 1st.
---
Not an open world. Not even close. 
---
Most of the games reviews are exceptionally positive.... The only caveat is the lack of exploration.
---
"So let's create this mythical subscription where we tell the users they get a dedicated server".. but.we can't do that...its ok how are they going to check?
---
You need Xbox live anyway to play the game. As absurd the 1st pricing is, it’s disingenuous to add the monthly cost XBL to it since you had it already.
---
I was just mocking that user in jest.
---
If you had yours collecting scrap vs junk it was... :(
---
&gt;But I still hold hope for their upcomming singleplayer games.
---
I wish that I  could do the same.  I really do.  But Fallout 1st is more than unethical, in my view.   It's like Bethesda has completely lost the goddamn mind.   I mean, I don't say that to be melodramatic.  I'm serious.    I can't justify spending money on a company who seriously believes something so insane  this was a good idea.
---
I'm sure if you're in their position, you have hard numbers you can look at.  The thing that slays me is that this really isn't a new thing because we've had the various Atom + costume bundles in the past for more-or-less the same price.  Which is basically how I choose to look at it - the private servers, scrapbox, and second CAMP are nice, but they aren't really things I need.  They are just little bonuses.  The main attraction, for me, is that I don't have to wait around for Atoms to go on sale anymore.
---
We've gone for almost a year without any of this.  It didn't suddenly become mandatory overnight.  Yet, as they always do, the social media drama mob has to flip its shit about it and declare that everything is over.  I'd be willing to bet half the people aren't even from around here.  Many will readily admit to just following the game for the controversy.  That is the "game" for them, sad as it is.  It's best to just tune them out.  If you enjoy the game, you do what you want.
---
I don't have a playstation, so can't comment on whether or not they include any taxes at all prior to actual billing / invoicing. Is the Fallout1st subscription handled through PSN though, or is it direct with Bethesda? If the later, then PSN norms are not especially relevant.
---
I recollect that Blizzard added in the tax on the invoice and the advertised price didn't include it....which was annoying at the billing stage. Bethesda might be doing that as well or not. I haven't bought fallout1st yet so don't have an invoice to cofirm either way.
---
&gt; I don't even have Failout 76 lol
---
Found another one..
---
The beta wasn’t to fix things, it was a marketing move. The average consumer would get a taste of fallout with friends while also seeing “oh its buggy its a beta! They’ll see all these bugs and they’ll fix em at launch” not realizing the process it takes to fix all the issues. Bethesda gets a bit of good press and maybe a few more sales before the shot show launch.
---
Ask for a Refund if they don't fix it...
---
I call bull no one would actually buy it
---
By all means, don't like the game. My point is that the aggressive profit stances are probably just them trying to keep the game afloat so content can be added; a "stimulus package," effectively. And corporate is the one who'd pull the plug and pressure the branch into this. 
---
Pete and Todd are not idiots, they're probably pissed too but can't say anything.
---
Canadians are over paying by $1 its 17.99 here but with current conversation rate it should only be 16.99
---
&gt; Bethesda isn't going to try to get more bad press
---
Have you not been following this dumpster fire of a game?
---
You misremember fren.

HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE FALLOUT 76 SINCE I BEGAN TO PLAY. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR FALLOUT 76 AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. FOR TODD HOWARD. HATE. HATE.
---
If you need something to read that bad you could hit a book store and just buy a paperback sci-fi book  for like 7$ , that’s like a 93$ savings for the same product
---
This seriously reminds me of the Redskins episode of South Park. The aspect of it at least.
---
The attitude people are taking is that people who don't want to support something so stupid are just poor boys who can't afford their new super premium swag and we're all just so jealous they have a box they can put more lead in (currently not working no surprise there) and some extra cosmetics in the video game equivalent of the Titanic.
---
I don't get it?
---
Yea another one who wasn't stupid to spend 60$ on a broken game.
---
Most people quit?    Anyone who's quit, quit months ago.  Private servers are bringing people *back*.
---
And I'd suggest you don't worry if joe blow has a ranger outfit and you don't.  Your life is going to be full of people that have stuff you don't.  Might as well get used to it now.
---
I have had Cyberpunk on preorder for almost a year. That is despite swearing I would never preorder another game after Fallout 76. I sure hope they don't let us all down.
---
so I'm hearing the box is never full? Promises kept. /s
---
Well damn, I've never noticed that discrepancy til now. TIL, thanks.
---
It's not a private server. It's a regular server that is empty and is assigned to you and locked.
---
You can't farm certain spots because other people have already done it in that same server before you.
---
I'm going to second and third hardcore mode. The original hardcore mode just boosted hps and kinda sucked. The revised one actually completely changed the game for me. Suddenly hotels and inns in the wasteland became important, doctors were a godsend. Building settlements wasn't just a box to check, it was an important survival requirement in the wasteland. It was seriously amazing.
---
Had it installed since BETA except for when it uninstalled itself 3 times, finally did it last night
---
Just because you can 'grind' to get the stuff in the game doesn't change the monetized design of the game.  it's still detrimental to the game. 
---
How would the game have been different if the option to spend money didn't exist in NBA 2k
---
I haven’t used it myself I’m not sure :/
---
And let’s not forget to blame all the dupers, because they are the reason the game is unplayable....   not the cluster-duckery of gaps, exploits, system failures that cause my session to crash every day.   I would rather donate skin than pay another dollar to them ever again
---
Atoms are 1 for 1 in US currency. 1 atom is 1 cent . You get 1650 atoms a month for 12.99 . It's less if you pay for a year at once . That's 9 dollars a month . 108 divided by twelve. 1650 atoms for 9 dollars. Roughly a 90% increase in the amount of atoms for the price. That alone is a hell of a deal. Private server access . Infinite scrap storage. Exclusive content. For far less per month than it costs for its value in atoms alone. Is 100 dollars in a year really that much money? It's cost more to take my family to a nice dinner. Less than taking my children to a movie. I understand that there are many people that do not have jobs. Or any income other than social security. And those people live on very strict budgets. I have a job , I pay taxes. That tax money is where social security comes from. In real life not everyone has nice cars or houses , due to circumstances mostly out of their control. Reality sucks. A business that is a live service model has to make money to keep the lights on. Not all players can afford it , that sucks , but , without any revenue the game would ultimately have to be discontinued. They cannot work for free. So they implement a way to get some money from those that can afford it, keep it optional so that those who cannot afford it, get to keep playing a game they love. TLDR life isn't fair and that sucks , but a business has to make money to stay working.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Obviously you can't pull out an item that plummeted into bottomless storage. Working as intended.
---
They know that will happen they probably won’t sweat at all
---
That’s why they chose to release the cash grab yesterday instead of the launch of wastelamders
---
They might also have chosen to delay wastelamders because of outer worlds release date
---
I cancelled my pre order, once I heard it wasn't open world. 
---
A fairly confined single player shooter / RPG....
---
More mass effect less Fallout.
---
Sorry, I misread your post; I agree with you -- though I'd be shocked if they can even run the backend on 2c/8Gb. I suspect they're looking at 1/4 to 1/2 core per user at min -- that said, perhaps they are using less and that's why it's a mess at times :P
---
Because then they wouldn't be selling as much stuff out of the atom shop. Why buy it when you can mod it in?
---
Heard about what
---
The absolute mad lad. Forget the guy in Area 51. This guy is a god amongs men XD
---
true that but they are handling BFV in a really neat way, have released EA Vault thingy for cheap prices and overall are in a better shape then lets say 2-3 years ago with all that Battlefront 2 shit? All I'm saying is my man they are improving to some extend while bethesda just released premium service for a broken game
---
Unless these variables function in the inverse to the rest of the "chance none" variables, which is possible, it was.  
---
It seems with the Update many of the Collectrons reset their collection to Scrap vs Junk, as a result you'd see Ballistic fiber and Ultracite now, where you would not before.
---
some folks are desperate for this to be a single play game, this lets them have their own special world to fondle themselves in uninterrupted
---
my team is gonna use it for lag-free vault runs
---
The game was alright, but I have already paid for it. If nothing is added I wont pay again. I get what you are saying but ensuring bethesda/zos remains a profitable business is their responsibility not ours.
---
np btw the chances are even split as far as i know so a thre star has a 33% chance of dropping any number of stars
---
No they are playing Outer Worlds
---
If I were him I'd buy up the official domain too then tell them he woudnt take them down and begin running ads 'til they removed the atom shop. But that's just my dream fap lol
---
Jokes on you ;)
---
90s fallout wasn’t even the same type of game lol. NV was the worst 3d one to come out (maybe tied with 76)
---
If you enjoy the gameplay and mission structure of NV, you should really be thanking 3 for creating the entire template. 
---
Best story is subjective, all NV had going for it was iron sights, more ways to complete quests, factions (not perfectly implemented imo), and basic survival mode.
---
And to answer your question at least 76 has a darker atmosphere and backstories stories than happy go lucky NV. At least in 76 the locations have some backstory and lore (terminals, notes, etc).
---
Honestly glad Obsidian doesn’t own fallout
---
Guys the actual link is pretty simple. 
---
falloutfirst.com
---
Horse armor DLC. Bethesda has always been a pioneer in crooked ways to earn money.
---
I can't feel sorry for any of the idiots who bought the subscription. They're ruining games for everyone else.
---
I nuked Whitesprings on my private server last night.  3/4 of the ghouls were dead. This explains a lot.
---
Anybody have a source? I tried looking online, but can't find it.  Not a jab at the OP, just doing my due diligence.  Thanks,
---
True but I just view 76 as fallout lite honestly. For what it is I like it but hopefully wastelanders gets a good story added. I’m not getting my hopes up tho
---
You're right; we have zero responsibility to give them any money especially since we already paid for the game. They desperately need to pull off a miracle to keep this game alive and growing.
---
Why would you voluntarily give them money?            
---
Honestly, you deserve this
---
What platform are you on? I am on psn.
---
LegacyKilla posted a video titled “Bethesda hates you” lmao
---
Yeah, I agree. I just meant more that people have seen it as a new "fallout" since it was announced. Everyone brings it up every time there's any discussion about how 76 is not the game they wanted.
---
I just wanted an open world fallout game to play with friends, and I got it. There are needed improvements and bug fixes, we all know this. But I know what I bought and why I'm playing it and I enjoy it.
---
Too many people thought these private servers were gonna solve all their problems with the game, and that's the most absurd thing out of all of this for me.
---
If it was that much then no.  Renting a server in most games cost a certain amount.  I definitely agree that the scrapbox and survival tent should have been free content.  I still enjoy the game besides what they decide to do.
---
No problem the wording was a bit confusing
---
Sort of.  They knew they're going to lose tons of users.  But they'll make more money.  It's a win for them - more revenue with less cost.  Two years from now this move will probably be viewed as a "success" from a business point of view, which is unfortunate.  The only thing that might hurt them is how many people will no longer buy future Bethesda games.
---
and yet folks are still brigading about "they pushed it back to release this" because it fits their narrative better
---
So what revenue model isn’t fucking stupid?
---
.. a game they have never played!
---
It boggles the mind.
---
That's sad, this sub is the minority of the majority, everyone who has played a video game knows what dumpster fire Fallout 76 has been since launch, and how little they've actually done to fix it. 
---
The real minority are people who like this game or even tolerate and play it.
---
There is probably more people subbed to this sub than there are people playing Fallout 76 weekly.
---
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

Bye!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN I HAVE YOUR GUNS?
---
*this post was made by below-average intelligence with no ability to comprehend everything thats happening gang*
---
Not disagreeing, I just got annoyed back before I got the strategy guides for fo3/fonv.  Being 30+ hours in and discovering you couldn't snag a late perk was a bugger.  Back then I'd just note it for the next run.  FO1/FO2 was about the same, think they were shorter.runs then 3/NV though.
---
FO4 seemed to have fewer, just with more depth in each die to ranks.  FO76 seem wide open since you can change stats up or swap skilla on the fly.
---
All told I'd put FO1/FO2 ahead of FO3/FONV on dialog/story.  FO4/FO76 ahead on action.  Love them all though, I've got hundreds of hours in every version (even tactics).  Almost reminds me of final fantasy with how the core mechanics slowly shift around.
---
It would explain why 3/4 of the ghouls in Whitesprings were already dead when I nuked it on my private server last night
---
no, it's both.
---
Pay for a Fallout 1st Membership, you piece of crap, and get 1600 Atoms every month! It's basically free!! Do it NOW - MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!
---
“Shoulda been in tha game!” is always the cry of the poor that can’t afford DLC and wants to rage like a little baby. It’s all optional you child.
---
I've only seen this post about 500 times in the last year. I'm sure this time they mean it.
---
On the other hand, lets not forget that time and time again, EA will do what seems to be the right move for a while until the heat dies down and then walk their decision backward again using the same tired boilerplate excuse letter they have written 20 times.
---
Sadly I agree.
---
Doing the bug testing work for them classic Bethesda
---
It's back up, how is that?
---
It got shut down and you can only get to it through webarchive. Bethesda trying to bury the news cycle
---
Imagine being this far up your own butt lol
---
Until they give us toggle options PvP will still suck like adventure mode. You've got to slap each other and then start out PvP. That's really kind of bullshit, plus it's only between eight players but that kinda seems decent for a PvP fight
---
A dude do what to a what?
---
Nope.
---
Zenimax is a publisher that Bethesda created so it wouldn't have to go through companies like EA or 2K.
---
Not yet. Been lucky so far.
---
&gt; In fact they actually took something away. That's what you get for supporting these businesses.
---
Honestly yeah. I'm laughing my ass off. Serves the brainwashed idiots right.
---
Oh what i mean by private server is i can roam freely without bumping into players that are not on my friends list. It makes faming scarp from workshops easy and theif free lol
---
That’s fair!
---
You're absolutely right, I have no experience with Fallout 76. I also have no experience with someone beating me within an inch of my life but I still sympathize with the people who have had that happen to them.
---
So... as someone who didn't waste their money, I feel for the people who have. Wasting my money on false promises and a broken product is something I have experience with in my life, however. So... to those who feel similarly about Fallout 76 I would say I have adequate knowledge about what they're feeling right about now.
---
They did, it's called private servers
---
If you want to shill for EGS, that's on you, but I have nothing to prove to you.
---
It's okay. Nothing wrong with being a lot attendant.
---
It is offline for me and I had to go to the webarchive
---
Lol on the downvotes. Sorry I forgot to use my sarcastic font.
---
I like the DLC model. Like The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Battlefield 1... I also like For Honor and R6: Siege.
---
If you get loot in the private world, does it transfer over back to the multiplayer world?
---
Because it is fine.
---
I'm enjoying myself in game... If you can't, that's on you
---
Solid advice.
---
Well I’m already quitting this game since April
---
Yeah 2 teams of 4 straight for PvP seems pretty sweet to me.
---
TOW should use this as their slogan
---
“Not Fallout 76.” - this will save them lots of marketing dollars.
---
Seriously understand that. No problem mate.
---
I'll bet a dollar it includes the phrase *"We hear your concerns"*.
---
It is worth noting that that the $99 deal brings it down to $8.30 a month, which is quite a bit less than $13.
---
Like he gives a shit about this game or it’s fans. He just wants clicks.
---
What? Fallout 76 is fun beside all the Microtransaction bullshit
---
Once we can customize our private worlds with pvp modifiers and stuff, then I might actually want to buy it
---
That isn't content. You will be doing the 3xact same things as on the base game, which you already paid for.
---
It’s almost like, I don’t know, ever MMO ever has done this?? But complaining about this game gets you free internet points so
---
This is the kind of basic life improvements the game could have used before going to a subscription... definitely wouldn't have made the pot stir so much in my opinion. I really wouldn't be as disappointed in what happened...
---
That's a big possibility. I'd personally give my server at least four cores and 8gb of ram to make it run smoother. I have fiber internet with 100 up/down so that wouldnt be an issue. I think Beth's problem is they dont pay for enough bandwidth.
---
A private session, yeah.
---
They'll show up next week to say, "loving that halloween event, right everyone?!" and expect to be drowned in praise.
---
Whatbpart isn't true? I am still trying to work out figuing out why certain things dont spawn in the private servers.
---
Well, Bessy, my moo moo has been suffomacatin from these new fangled “global temperates”. Now I don’t see “climate change” to be much of an issue cause when them bombs fell from Alpha site, it was awful cold a couple a months. But she “thinks” it’s a “global issue”, damn cow needs a head exam.
---
In all seriousness, you guys are awful to deal with. You complain and complain and then move on, never actually doing anything about it. They don't need to do anything.
---
Ok stop now.
---
Yeah but weve gone full REEEEE logic and reasoning is out at this point
---
I've wanted private servers since launch. It's common. They're around. Be bitter
---
Because the subreddit doesn't cost me anything. 🙂
---
PC here so no help to you, but is there a discord or certain reddit for finding people to play with?
---
Hello Todd, how are you doing today?
---
Cool, same, but you are not the OP.
---
So as usual we Brits are mugs. It does bloody annoy me. 
---
Anyone got any other prices? Japan, sweden etc?
---
It's really sad as 76 had huge potential but its stumbled at every hurdle.
---
Yep, it's almost like a cult.
---
it would have been called fallout prime with upgrades for upgrades the support upgrades in the future
---
Not true. I one shotted two 3* super mutants last night so they had no chance to heal and got two 3* items. It's purely random, healing is not a factor at all. 
---
As a sneaky rifleman doing headshots with an instigating lever action with meds and ballistic Bock you generally one shot everything and I get about 33% 3* items from 3* enemies. Bit lucky last night admittedly.
---
The Elder Scrolls has been Todd's baby since Morrowind. There is no way he's letting that go just because of 76.
---
Dont forget the penitentiary yard.
---
I have to start being more specific lol. I take it your not a fan of this update?
---
If you didn't have plans on playing it and Fallout 1st pushed you into trying it?
---
You're a sad waste of oxygen
---
If you dont have the game how can you say its broken  I have 1200 hour in this game and still playing it, $60 it's a fucking bargain ??
---
&gt;Renting a ~~server~~   
---
&gt;crash-machine.
---
If you paid $100 a year for a private server you bet your sweet ass it would be stable. You're one of the whales they make this content for. I bet if it was $199.99 a year ($23.99/month) you would have still "tried it out" then never cancelled. It's time to stop.
---
How do you guys play this game? Like fr
---
Legit question here. With all the claims about the direction of the game at the beginning that turned out to be straight lies, are we able to file complaints with the FTC for  deceptive business practices?
---
ahahaha lol'd at edit: yikes my man
---
Aside from just being egregiously anti-consumer in the way they design their products and servicing options, bowing down to the Chinese government by removing apps that were supportive of Hong Kong protesters.
---
Give us the option at least.
---
The installer is just like installing anything else. If you can download the game in the first place then you can download Vortex. The unoffical patches are a good idea but not technically needed for all mods. Personally I would suggest it and they arent that complicated to install, usually just dropping a few things into some files. Making sure mods play nice with eachother is a little harder, but I just do a trial and error. I usually use a premade mod list from someone so I know they all play nice and then add mods one at a time. If the game all of a sudden crashes then i know my new mod is causing an issue. Its not always that simple but worst case scenario i just use trial and error, uninstal and reinstall mods till i narrow it down. As far as level lists are concerned, i have never had to mess with anything like that. Closest thing i can think of is the load order for New Vegas Bounties as its a 3 part mod. Its pretty easy tho and the mod manager makes it a 3 second process.
---
I'm not sure. That's how I'm posting on here. If u find anything lmk👍
---
People crawl in a cage with a lion and get angry when it mauls them...Who’s to blame in that scenario and how is it different from buying fo76 and being shocked when Bethesda screws everyone once again? Shitty companies do shitty things. Vote with your wallets, folks.
---
To my knowledge, Chris Avellone didn't even work on Outer Worlds. This is just some top quality personal revenge for Bethesda's metacritic shit that nearly sank Obsidian.
---
We didn't know, but I assumed. I also assumed that the private servers would actually be *servers* though and not just temporary instances, otherwise why would they use the word "server"?
---
First of all, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! for anyone that got this service without waiting to hear from reviewers after the utter disaster this game has been. 
---
Second of all, why would you buy this service? It's nothing but a money grab and pure greed from Bethesda. They have had one controversial issue come out after another since the launch of FO76. Stop supporting this crap! 
---
Third, all of you supporting this are why Bethesda doesn't even bother to fix their games. If you want shit to get fixed stop buying until they actual fix stuff. If your defense is "I'm supporting the staff," can you tell me for a fact they see an inkling of the money Bethesda makes off deals like this? Are they even putting that much of the money they're making off the game back into it? 
---
Finally, stop supporting and justifying this crap.
---
Wrong, UK and the rest of Europe are paying over 33usd more. Taxes and fees don't get that high and Bethesda are thieves.
---
Not quite ideal but my wife and I have vowed to shoot each other whenever we cross paths in our empty wasteland. No peeking allowed. The only thing I really want now is a survival mode toggle.
---
I know that you don’t care personally, but I want to use this thread to publicly declare, that I will indeed uninstall the game tonight. 
---
Played through the bugs, convinced friends to take a chance... This First s*** is it for me!
---
*Even better, you mean. 
---
Fuck Bethesda 1000 times over. I will never buy a game from the again. Much like Bioware, EA, and Activision. 
---
Thank god I own a Switch.
---
&gt;"I'm waiting for them to just sell Fallouts IP so Obsidian can buy it back and make..."
---
Yes siree, so Obsidian can buy it back ***and make America great again!***
---
No really though, they're not going to buy it back.  Plus OtW pretty much has the a copy and paste of a lot of the same stuff anyway (Watch footage of it and tell me ADA doesn't make the same jokes as a Mr. Handy), although the game itself is definitely less of a free roam sort of thing.
---
Why doesn't everyone always bring up this Obsidian should buy the IP crap?  They don't have the same writers anymore, and Fallout 3 was honestly closer in design to Fallout 1 than even Fallout 2 was.
---
lol, what did people expect? It’s not like this is a new thing, everything they touch turns to crap.
---
Now be honest. Who came here ready to rage, but now you just remember an awesome song lol.
---
How does your ass feel?
---
yeah ive been trying to get into the game again the last couple weeks but this is it. Worst part is that in the beginning they said we only got a 400 stash because of limitations. And now they are selling infinite stash. Now if i ever try to enjoy the game I will only play untill i fill up my stash and then remember some P2W players get a infinite stack.
---
Because of this i will never be able to enjoy the game again. God damn they reallt screwed up. Im never ever paying for another bethesda game again unless they undo this.
---
$187 new Zealand
---
Fucking glad I only paid £8.50 for this, what a fucking joke
---
Oh apologies, yeah I read your comment in the wrong way. All the best buddy, thanks for the reply.
---
Yep. That would be a correct assessment of the situation. I said from the start tho, it's not much for the first month. Everyone's acting like they gotta marry the idea when u can simply try it out as I am before really jumping into the mob mentality fad
---
a private server is not content.
---
Here some more being a "shill"
---
Remember when NV launched and was arguably one of the biggest messes in the Fallout series? 
---
Here's some fun links and titles

---
Agreed. This service is not aimed at serious players but at gullible, clueless noobs, and anyone who gets screwed over has no one to blame but themselves because this is pretty much Bethesda's pattern now. Giving Bethesda money is like voting for the Face-Eating Leopard Party and then being shocked and surprised when a leopard eats your face.
---
Sure, be about 2031 before it gets to court.
---
I really wasn’t. I am fine with NV and wasn’t honestly interested in the hype with it as a ‘Fallout killer’ and was planning on sticking to Wastelanders. Then it got pushed back and I saw a YouTube ad for the game pass, figured why not.
---
[It Just Works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8)
---
"Massive multiplayer online" So yeah. It is.
---
bought one yesterday :(
---
Wait what have I said that’s wrong? I literally said it should be cheaper.
---
Yep, I'm curious if it's hub and spoke like last wolfenstein or only one chance at a zone.
---
I just finished The Outer Wilds (Not Worlds). It was one of the best solo gaming experiences I have had in a long time. Short, cheap, and awesome.
---
nothing has been learned since horse armor
---
What hurts more is they don't give away their loot to others that are still playing. Think of the poor 10mm ammo sitting in their characters not being used. 1000 10mm lasts me 1.5 queen fights lol.
---
It's the upfront cost that is my issue. I can do $12.99 hear and there without worrying about it but even if it's once a year, $100 out of my account is a big hit all at once at the moment since I am not full time yet and doing college bachelors courses. Thankfully the job I have now pays well enough to pay bills and have a little extra for luxury spending on a game and a couple subscription services each month.
---
Nobody asked you to suck Bethesdas dick if you want to be rude and moronic about this, then stick your fingers in your ears and yell louder than valid criticisms.
---
Agreed as well; Wastelanders, QoL Improvements, and Bug Fixes done first would have been *the perfect* way to do this.
---
I don’t like it either, but I just don’t feel they will change anything that makes them lose money. 
---
If we knew about it before it dropped I would have said fight for the scrap box, but it is out now.
---
Obsidian has members of the old fallout crew, who also worked in Fallout new vegas. That's why people always divide Fallout 1,2 and new vegas with Fallout 3 and 4. Interplay ended up going bankrupt because they wanted to stick with the isometric type of gameplay we see in wastelanders. They reset the franchise? where they were using the same lore, story, characters. where did they reset the franchise
---
Tbh I’m not a big fan of how they’ve handled the game, especially now with this new PTW sub. However I’m still interested on how it actually effects gameplay. So I may actually try a one month sub.
---
People have more disposable income than me. They're stupid!!!
---
Even 10% would be amazing. With 250 million worldwide players, if 5% spent $5 average a month that is $62.5 million monthly revenue. If they had even 10% of the players Fortnite has them everything could be free probably but instead they have probably 2.5 million players and run on something around $3-5 million a month in revenue which sure keeps the lights on and some people working on the game, it's not going to pay for any big free content drops.
---
We did - there was an OCT 2018 PC gamer article (that unfortunately has been updated) that said that there was going to be a cost.
---
Yeah, but then this same crowd would scream "PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN!" like parrots.  The very fact that Bethesda is aware of that is probably the reason why the benefits of 1st are somewhat conservative.
---
&gt; Players are not amused at the fact that they have now paid for the privilege of losing all of their materials, and so far, there does not seem to be any way to recover any of this. So do not use these boxes until there’s a clear fix for this. Not that more than like, two of you reading this are going to subscribe to Fallout 1st, but still.
---
You can't make this up. This isn't an out of season april fool's joke, this is a full on shitpost with all the funding and support of a AAA title.
---
There's no way you're serious... TESO is the most cash-grabbing terrible game I've ever played lol
---
"Fuck it, we will do it live!!!!! and fail.......... spectacularly"
---
The best part is the caption below the 12 fingered hand picture.
---
 you are blind to think the rage is just from trolls, i been playing in my corner alone, doing my grind this day over and over. 
---
Hopping to get Wastelander soon. And them i get this.
---
HELL YEAH IM RAGGING HELL YEAH IM QUITTING THIS BULLSHIT GAME AND THANKS TO ALL THOSE PPL BUYING THE CRAP BETHESDA KEEP DOING IS WHY FAILSHIT 76 IS THE WAY IT IS
---
Yes. Everything you earn in a Private World carries over. Scrapbox and campsite tent included
---
Wouldn't that be easily exploitable?  If I can just shutdown and restart my private server over and over for gaurenteed 100% fresh respawns of everything.
---
nathen110
---
I have been surfing these posts for hours. So much entertainment.
---
But it doesn't have as many glitches as FO76.
---
Good idea for a community game! I like it. Good idea, man
---
They were at least smart enough to build a new engine rather than cobble and old one out of mothballs
---
Not only are the servers up 27/7 but you can adjust each and every setting, spawns, use cheats ban players hold events and spawn in bosses. you know like actually renting a server. I promise you since fallout 4 added the settlement building its been a test to see how far they can go and how little effort they can put in while milking customers. If you liked settlement building or not it still deprived that game of the rich worlds we were used to seeing in fallout
---
Same. Its giving me great pleasure.
---
Thanks. Love the Subscription so far.
---
This guy is so salty Jesus. Must have nothing better to do then complain about everything not being free. Must be a Bernie Sanders guy.
---
You think they care about PR at this point?
---
Honestly looks like most aren't Fallout players. Im sorry but seeing same amount of people posting it on Xbox Club on average even after update shows most still play it and don't care enough to quit. Personally hate recent update but dam Bethesda knows how to make me pay with infinite storage of junk.
---
You mean people's moms?
---
Eh, I'd rather spend my money in something that doesn't delete my junk. I guess you really gotta be stupid, after all.
---
PTS is on their to-do list, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a glorified "early release" feature for Fallout-You-1st users.
---
Lol , I try to keep myself from the “ I’m a grown ass man I’ll spend my money however the fuck I want “ rants , but I’m thinking it
---
Yeah yeah more angry players, more people quitting= more stability in servers!!! Wait... sorry, just blue screened.
---
I don't know what "uniformed opinion" means, so I'm not prepared to comment on whether or not someone should care about it. Though I will refer you to rule 4 of the subreddit: remain civil. :)
---
&gt;so this update was kind of mandatory for my playstyle,
---
not really. just dont play. ez
---
I didn't hate the Epic launcher until they decided to buy exclusivity. Even that wouldn't have been so bad, except that they took it a step further and bought out games that were already advertised for other platforms.
---
So yeah, fuck 'em. They're not getting any of my money until they stop being colossal asshats (so probably never).
---
I'm as shocked as you are.
---
Xbox can switch time zone to New Zealand and play.
---
Yes, it’s pay to win now.
---
Oh god I forgot about horse armor.
---
For me, it was Daggerfall.
---
It was the first game that was VAST in scope and yes, looking back you can see that there were only 3 NPCs that just spawned in the hundreds like an army of ants, and yes, the hundreds of cities probably had a base layout of 5 different locations, but every single one of those NPCs in all those cities could randomly spawn a DYNAMIC QUEST and  send you to a DYNAMICALLY RENDERED DUNGEON to rescue someone or find an object.
---
I want THAT Bethesda Softworks back.
---
Funny when coming from a group of people that keeps claiming to see conspiracies even under their bed.
---
How I spend my money shouldn’t be a concern to you.  If i want to spend it on this then I can.
---
Other private servers. Not Bethesda’s.
---
I highly doubt that will ever happen.  It's already an advantage over non-paying players.  That would probably send all these complaining babies who can't afford the private servers straight to headquarters with pitchforks and torches
---
Fuck angry Joe and the rest of those YouTube morons as well.
---
That's my opinion, saved you from watching me smear it out over 30 minutes with ads like those parasites.
---
You're welcome.
---
Individuals have very limited damages. You can only sue for the purchase price of the game; not for all the time you sunk into it in hope of a future-stable-game. 
---
The only entity with the means to justify a suit would be a State Attorney General, but they usually have bigger fish to fry, such as opioid manufacturers.
---
Maybe I'll see you around in another one. I'm sure there's plenty more to come! WOOOOOOO
---
Clear West teck, collecting all weapons from muties and schrapping them ( with scrapped perk)
---
Put on excavator pa and do Lucky hole mine, you end up with 400 lead ore if done correctly
---
Server hop tanagra Town, kill crickets inside and collect acid.
---
 Now you can craft all te ammo you need, preferably with ammo Smith and super duper equipped
---
Rockstar doesn't really have Community managers like Bethesda and definitely doesn't try to fuck up and extra monetize RDO every other day.
---
The song is now stuck on.my head XD
---
Do the Leader of the Pack event in the forest area every chance you get.
---
Kinda like how Todd Howard said the game would "just work" at launch? And then it proceeded to do the exact opposite of that? Since we're talking about physiological impossibles, let's delve in to how Todd can't seem to say one thing that becomes reality about Fallout 76. :D
---
Farming public events and having access to all workshops in Private World, if you can handle defending them all, is a good way to siphon a bunch of resources.
---
Clever response.
---
If anyone wants my sent/ass armor, bloodied  explosive handmade. AAE handmade, or numerous other god tier weapons then send me a message on PS4.   I’m done with this shit.
---
It was. This bug exists in Skyrim and Fallout 4 as well.
---
The culprit is their amateur implementation of flash into the creation engine. Basically they didn't know how to optimize and wrote proper flash code, and the end result was that every item displayed in your hud/pipboy takes up space in your vram, and if you have too much stuff and take up too much space, you cause the game to crash. This is still a problem in F4 with mods and users who carry a lot of items via console cheats. Bethesda overlooked or simply didn't care that the bug existed in 76 despite the game focusing on looting eons more than in 4 or Slyrim until they saw the servers crash so prominently. 
---
My guess is they finally fixed their shit code, but now want to monetize their efforts for fixing a problem they created to begin with. Essentially *you* pay for Beth's fuckups.
---
Yes sorry that's what i meant lol
---
That's because they are not going anywhere, just like UK with Brexit. They just trying to drag some attention in their boring lives.
---
Most outfits cost like 10$ I mean this is a good ass deal
---
I bet you all still log back in tomorrow
---
I know, I mean you're wrong about the 9.99. We pay more all over Europe including the UK.
---
Eh, not bothered about the blizzard news, I'd rather just enjoy playing WoW.
---
What would be interesting is to go back to each of those posts and see just how many did mean it. I never posted about it (hell, I've been a lurker until just recently), but I uninstalled the game after the Banhammer Fiasco™.
---
I know, the argument goes "they already have your money, use their bandwidth!" And sure, that's one way to look at it, but I didn't pay a done for the game, so meh.
---
while this is incredible im on pc haha, besides, got birthday shit to to today anyway.
---
I don't think anybody deserves it, but it's definitely a case of "well, you should have seen it coming"
---
So now that people were outraged just at the IDEA of this, and now there are genuine problems with people getting screwed over for being willing to spend the extra money, I sincerely hope bethesda can find a quick way of making it up to people. But both quick and fair are words rarely associated with this game, so...
---
Happy cake day!
---
I haven’t tried but I assume you can, since it’s a purchase off the Xbox store rather than the in game atom shop
---
Edit: although it wouldn’t make sense for you both to get the atoms so it might not work
---
Don't you dare bring ESOs gilded name within ten feet of this dumpster fire.
---
I second this. And really anywhere you find lots of gun enemies is great. Like the top left corner of the map where you also find super mutants.
---
I have to agree with this, if it was going to QoL improvements they would have improved this game a hell of a lot since its release, not rinse its playerbase for every dollar going and then back peddal on its promise in mtx for cosmetics only.
---
Hardened Mass is not scrap.  It's junk.  It scraps into Ultracite Scrap.  If something can be scrapped, it can't be stored in the scrap box by definition.  It has to be scrapped first.  Please remove this from the bug list.  It is not a bug and is working as designed.

But nobody that made 1 2 nv still works at Obsidian... So whats your point

My broke ass version of gold for you: 🥇
---
There are so many good ways to meme the name, I sort of feel bad for them. But right now it seems fully deserved ^^^as ^^^usual
---
Win what?
---
yeah we need a video!
---
i saw one video of a guy using a private server but it didnt go into too much detail other then when he is in an area and clears out some higher level npcs when they respawn they are level 9 but if he relogs they go back to the higher level baddies lol
---
They could have been honest and said that.
---
Jeez, I feel for the employees that joined the Fallout Team with a genuine love for fallout. Because they've got to be hurting somewhere right now. 
---
But man Bethesda, you guys really know how to make one thing eclipse any good effort you've made.
---
Wasn’t me, it was a guy from 4chan. I don’t even know how you buy a domain
---
All day is quite the exaggeration, maybe that's what you love to do all day when you're complaining about people complaining about F76 on reddit?
---
I mean, so long as you have a friend with premium, you can use their world
---
Maybe I’m a noob or something but why will a company go out there way to Secure a domain with first on it?
---
When people type www.fallout.com will it lead them to www.falloutfirst.com ?!?
---
Yes, even after I logged out and reloaded
---
Todd Howard needs a new leather jacket.
---
I was hoping someone would post about this.  Does everything work pretty much the same?  If we build up a base at a workshop will it remain or does it disappear when we log off?  Is your stash giving you problems or is it okay? Is the survival tent big enough to congregate around? Like for sitting around the fire?
---
I’m really interested in it because we would like to do a whole ‘family saves the fallout world thing’ with our tween and teen without having to work around other players.  
---
Found another Bethesdrone
---
What friends? You probably can't even get 5 people to join your private lobby because it's literally a fact that this game isn't fun, there is no enjoyable content, nothing to do but grind and walk around.
---
We don't hate launchers, we hate being forced to switch from launcher to launcher, with some having way less features then others. I don't mind have 3 launchers, but now it's gotten so bad it's abysmal. Steam, Epic, Uplay, Bethesda, Rockstar, Origin are all the ones I currently have to be able to  play the games that I own. Is having 6 launchers the end of the world as we know it? No, of course not. But how many more are going to pop up in the coming years from big companies trying to save a few bucks by not sharing with steam? 2? 5? 10?
---
To anyone who has been reading the comments in this thread up to this point for the lulz, there is nothing valuable beyond this point.
---
The masses would disagree, FO4 sold about twice was well as for or fonv.  Heck it broke a billion dollars if memory serves.  They made it more approachable to the masses and it showed.
---
Imagine defending people give money to a company just so it can keep ruining the game you enjoy

Getting your scrap back will cost 1000 atoms.
---
why are you speaking for hong kong &amp; american values, then?
---
remember what i said about coherent politics?
---
I uninstalled last night. Enjoy paying over and over again for the same badly made shite you already paid for!
---
I think there are a couple of easy fixes that Bethesda could implement to improve some of the issues:
---
Problem 1) Scrapbox items are disappearing. 
---
Fix: not sure, but there are plenty of ways to save a list of items for later recall. 
---
Problem 2) Requires a fix for problem 1 first - can't stash all crafting materials (Hardened Mass, for example) in Scrapbox.
---
Fix: Bethesda seems to be limiting the Scrapbox to the list of crafting materials that have been scrapped to their base levels. However, there's a separate list of items that do not automatically scrap when you hit "Scrap All." Add the Scrap All-protected items to the Scrapbox-eligible list.
---
Problem 3) "Private Worlds" are just reused/tainted leftovers from someone else's session. This is especially bad because the people who are using these Private Worlds are doing so to get access to rare items that the previous World owner likely also wanted.
---
Fix: auto-restart the session when the server population hits 0. Or crash the server completely. Either way, Bethesda has extensive experience and procedures in place for ending a server.
---
I got the one year. The receipt said 108 dollars. Divided by twelve that's nine. Nine dollars a month for 1650 atoms plus all else you get. Check this next one out , I wrote it and been copy /pasting it on various posts.
---
Open world is not the sole element that describes Fallout. I think that is reductive enough to be doing Fallout a disservice.
---
TOW shares many other things with Fallout, such as a wide array of character building options, great quest diversity and design, solid writing and world building, lots of fun and varied characters, a great selection of well written companions, diverse choices in how to approach situations (stealth, combat, diplomacy), etc...
---
I am positive that is where this is heading.
---
There will be more subscription exclusives in the future. Eventually, the game will reach the point where it largely only caters to those who pay $100 a year to keep playing it.
---
Last night I saw one of the new scrap stash boxes and felt annoyed that I didn't have one too. 
---
Today I'm feeling good again for not getting it right off.
---
Might be a bit extreme. I’d meet you in the middle and say they could eventually sell scrip packages.  The odds of you finding your legendary is still almost impossible.
---
Not how it works. They are new instances spun up and shutdown on demand and billed (from Amazon to Bethesda) by resource consumption over x amount of time. 
---
Just from reading this sub alone there are far more subscribers than there ever were survival servers.
---
I've read the reports of loading in to new private worlds and seeing dead bodies on the ground which has sparked rumors of private worlds being recycled. Maybe that is true, but I have loaded in straight after maintenance before the post is made announcing servers are back online and seen the same thing.
---
Legacy is a joke lol. He goes with whatever opinion is popular. He used to report news back in the good old days.
---
Exactly my point. LoL is an example of how to do things the right way. Fallout 76 is the complete opposite.
---
Do people seriously still not understand how the worlds in this game work?  When you have a "private" world you don't literally have your own pristine private instance of the game set aside always waiting for you.
---
When a normal game world fills up the game creates a new instance and starts loading players into that world and when the last player leaves a world the game waits some period of time to see if anyone else joins in before unloading it and making room for a fresh instance to eventually be created when needed.
---
This is the same way private worlds work.  When you join "your" private world all the game is doing is looking at the worlds it currently has loaded and if there's a recently emptied world that's where it assigns you, whether it's someone else's private world or a recently emptied adventure world, and if there are no worlds available THEN it generates a new instance.
---
Don’t see how I am butthurt about playing a game I enjoy.
---
Thanks for proving my point, though.
---
PSA: the point of making troll posts is not getting mad at replies, try harder.
---
Definitely not massive, that’s like calling gta online or red dead online an mmo.
---
Why the hell does everyone nuke The Greenbrier? 
---
I have my house on the golf course and have to move servers every hour because someone’s dropping a nuke, or my cow and I immediately die of radiation upon spawning in.
---
His name says it all.
---
People freak out over the smallest shit lol
---
Depends on the metric, fo4 drastically outsold 3/nv.
---
The same folks that found the new items in the patch for the atomic shop found changes that heavily nerf the junk bot.
---
I wonder if it also nerfed the public junk nodes, too.
---
Why dont you try using the link....
---
It still works.
---
On PS4, you Block For Session and that person can't see that you are online nor join your private server.  Is this a PC or XBOX bug?
---
They quit because there’s no defending this many lies.
---
Lmao holy shit what a joke game, can you request Todd Howard give you your money back. How tf can a GM not see your account is a day 1 purchase???? Why do you have to PROVE YOU GAVE THEM MONEY
---
i'm not sure, but if you have the subscription you will have your own world, so he can join it and play with you, as long as you're online you should be fine.
---
Your loss, our gain.  Crazy part is, private servers run great and luckily, I have plenty of expendable income to blow on this game!! Have fun with mindless killing in borderlands 3.
---
The Bethesda store
---
At least someone gets it without mindlessly downvoting me.
---
A victim of a scam doesn't deserve it because they got manipulated or where unaware. But we're not talking about random people getting called by scammers pretending to be Microsoft. We are talking about people who are actively playing the game (and even people involved in communities) everyone around is well aware of how shit Fo76 and Bethesda is, its not surprising news.
---
But Bethesda has been trying to scam its userbase for years; horse armor, creation club, shoddy Skyrim ports, never fixing bugs, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, the list goes on. Even just playing Fallout 76, while it can be fun, its pretty clear its intention is to nickle and dime the consumer base until there is nothing left.
---
On top of that, losing your entire stash and why they deserve this. Is this not the same game that literally uninstalled itself when the first Beta opened? Is this not the same game where there where massive bugs around fusion cores and power armor that resulted in fusion cores getting deleted? Is this the same game that's riddled with bugs in every single mechanic? It's truly mind boggling stupid that you would buy this, and then expect it to "just work", has anything around Fallout 76 "just worked" since its launch?
---
This entire sub needs a break. Total shitshow. Hoping it dies down in a week or so.
---
I did man. I know how to click a link
---
But apart from all that it's still a good game yes?
---
That's a yes vote, tho.
---
Lol you're hilarious.
---
&gt;Because Austin being the primary team behind this was a secret.
---
It wasn't a secret. There was an entire [No Clip documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs) from June '18 detailing development. Within the first 5 minutes it shows the Austin studio and how Bethesda Maryland reached out to them to try and convert their engine to work in an online environment.
---
Stop spreading nonsense just because you're pissed. Todd and his team pushed for 76 because it was always an idea they toyed with during the development of FO4.
---
If you are here to fulfill your existence, then I feel bad for you.
---
My friend got a private server. When we loaded in, most of the lead spots and areas for plastic were gone. Definitely was a 'used' server lol
---
Lol, so that is all we have to go off so far? I don't mind criticism, so long as it's constructive and factual. I still never got an answer on the whole fasnacht rare mask saga. No one ever got one of these rare drops on video! It was always "i saw the guy wearing it in game" etc. I kept asking and asking people for video proof, but nothing.
---
I don't care that you spend you money on "things" you can buy a life time supply of twisty ties for all I care.
---
It's just that you are contributing to the cash grab and it makes the game studio think it's a good idea (or at least profitable enough to repeat) when you do. It's a huge mistake.
---
Think there's supposed to a livetream from Bethesda for DOOM this afternoon. I could only imagine what the Chat will look like
---
EDIT: On twitch 2pm EST

I linked this [interview](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-has-microtransactions-but-bethesda-insi/1100-6462850/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  and had the quote text in another comment (can’t find it on mobile right now). The statement was **all** content for the $60 price of the game was going to be included.
---
You will never keep up with your ammo consumption using your approach.  You need to obtain acid (check YouTube, there are some great videos on this).  Step 2 steel, West Tec and Uranium fever are great for getting weapons to scrap.  Step 3, get lead ore from the Lucky Hole mine.  
---
Make your lead from your acid and ore.  Make gunpowder from your acid and cloth.  Equip the ammo perk and superduper and make ammo.  I've have never dropped below 10,000 rounds after adopting this approach.
---
Seriously just wait, or buy it to try now for a month and see how you feel after that before you go all in for a year.  Honestly, can we even say for certainty this game will still be supported in a year.......?  There are bugs being reported in 1st (obviously) and supposedly extra features coming down the line.  Until those features come, I don't even understand what the point of a private server is tbh.   I would wait and see what the future holds and the price point is too steep anyway - I would seriously hope they'll discount this at some point.
---
Private Servers are not New - verify that New is promised feature.  Keep in mind these are probably repurposed and reconfigured Survival servers times three.  You may get a private session that others have left, in whatever state they left it.  Everything respawns eventually.
---
Honestly If you buy it and they screw you over you deserve it for being dumb enough to pay them for this garbage (that you already paid full price for)
---
It's back up.
---
I own Terraria, hated Destiny, Witcher is single player, and Diablo clones are just like Diablo, stupid.
---
You could take all the money you spent on all that bullshit and subscribe to Fallout, which is a superior experience.
---
this is what the top people at bethesda really wanted to say to there fans . love it!!!
---
Rofl okay welp, enjoy :) I still am
---
They’re trying to maximize profits, which isn’t surprising considering the parent company is zenimax
---
HE PAID FOR SOMETHING HOSTED ON THE INTERWEB?!!!
---
It can't even handle the traffic it is getting.
---
What a sucker LOLOLOLOL
---
Or you know, don't support this kind of bullshit
---
Ive found Resolute verteran (or any gatling, really) to be much more effective against SBs than the 308 LMG.  Now if the LMG has a legendary prefix, that could change the equation a bit....
---
Luck hole in excavator for lots of lead, the usual places for steel, (or make the loop around WS and pick up everything.  Dont forget the laundry building, and pick up every piece of silverware in the golf club dining room.  You might be surprised how much steel there is.   
---
 superduper and ammosmith when you craft.
---
Doesn't always mean people in a session, but people playing. I'm part of many 76 communities and trading posts from various places, the game is still very much alive and active. You bandwagoners just want to feel like you're better than everyone else. Also, GTA Online and RD Online could be considered MMOs by definition. :)
---
I was a voice in the wilderness advocating giving the game a fair shake, hoping they'd pull it off. I kept making excuses for them up to the Banhammer Fiasco™, but that tore it for me. Loyal players who'd been with them from day one being banned. No bueno. No mi gusta.
---
That said, Starfield is the last chance. Using an online piece of fuckery to judge a single payer game is not a great idea. Their shady business practices have always been around (horse armour, anyone?), One has but to look at the doubling of the Season Pass price for Fallout 4 to see that.
---
Dead Rising
---
I am starting to become convinced that one of the heads at the studio is just having a jolly old time messing around until retirement
---
If you're one of the sycophantic losers that desperately needs to financially support people that repeatedly lie to you and steal, then you're better off waiting just a smidgen as Christmas is obviously near.  
---
Game ain't even close to what it was a year ago quit your bullshit
---
i might be brave enough to try it myself if no more info comes of it soon
---
nice, ill only have to win 100 bets to play on a private server for a year
---
Sure, but if you are a community manager and speak publicly about how bad your company is, you are not doing a very good job.
---
You console normies just have no idea how to judge the value proposition. You are happily ripped off to your face! It’s because of people like you that the industry will continue to spiral down the trend of anti consumerism.
---
**Scrap Boxes from one Fallout 1st Member cannot be accessed by another:**  Unable to reproduce on PS4.  Player A is able to access Player A's scrap box inventory by using Player B's scrap box.
---
probably because the game isnt Falloutfirst, its Fallout 1st, and they already had a website for it.
---
[Fallout.com/Fallout1st](https://Fallout.com/Fallout1st).
---
So why would they buy a new domain when they already had one?
---
So some 4chan terrorist decided to try to be funny.   Well, what do you expect from a 4chan user.  Trying to damage a community just because they dont like a peice of it.   Welcome to liberal socialist fascism.
---
Weekdays/nights are generally bad for nuclear winter pop, weekends I usually find mid-high 30's per match. It has also lost its allure for many who don't like the BR style gamemode, plus a few cheaters have soured other people grapes
---
The reason they do this is because people still pay for it. There's been a couple of posts now about people who bought it that are experiencing bugs in their private worlds, or say that they just can't help it. Those people are the reason bethesda is able to keep doing this. Because somehow, despite all the backlash, they still turn a profit.
---
The only way to draw the line is to stop playing and uninstall until they stop this bs.1
---
Nah he said he wanted to try this out and if it was successful it was gonna he the new fallout ip 
---
Hasn’t been very successful imo
---
Skyrim had bad storytelling, yes. Was it horrible? No.
---
It was not good, though. I feel like people who are impressed with Bethesda's storytelling have never read a book that wasn't assigned to them by a teacher.
---
um, how is purchasing a product anti-consumerism.
---
I thought that was the actual definition of consumerism.  Buying products.
---
From the definition: Consumerism:  the preoccupation of society with the acquisition of consumer goods
---
The ammount of resources you get is absolutely insane. I have spent all day just doing this.
---
You can leave your child screaming, certainly: but who spoilt the child, and who left you to scream when you needed to be heard to diminish the voices of others?
---
"I still like this game, therefore anyone leaving and posting about it must be going for karma, not expressing an honest opinion."
---
Unless people speak out, Bethesda will not change. But hey, if you like taking it up the metaphorical arse, go for it. Lose all your scrap, get thrown into fake private worlds, all for the low low price of $12, plus your soul.
---
Keep throwing your tantrum, nothing will happen
---
Todd Howard has barely anything to do with this game anymore.
---
Sauce ?
---
Do you play on PC? Because if not there was never any chance to lose your character. I'll admit the first week was pretty laggy (which was to be expected whenever new content drops)  but I play with a full squad everyday and have little to no problems on public servers.
---
Yeah, I remember their ["Save Player One"](https://bethesda.net/en/article/56dSIqRXXysEs8ueSkWO60/save-player-1) marketing bullshit.
---
Now you can save player one for only $12.99/month.
---
Im pretty sure they didnt build a new engine, they just didnt use the Creation engine because they had no one from BGS to show them the ins &amp; outs of that particular engine - so they used one that was more familiar to them.
---
Wouldn't know, I live in good ol' Europe.
---
Couldn't move to fattylandia.
---
Aw aye fair enough I can't say much because I'm probably gonna pay for it for a month to try it out
---
YOU wouldn't, but by definition, it technically is. If there's a large playerbase, as stated before, it is by all means considered an MMO. You can argue about this all day, or just stop talking about it, either way, don't expect a reply.
---
&gt;Do you understand why no one blank an eye with Everquest, WoW, or ESO? The developers behind those games didn’t make promises that they broke half way through the games lifecycle. “Free updates and NO paid micro transactions that benefit the player. “ They also didn’t launch as a buggy, half hearted mess.
---
Did you play Ultima Online, World of Warcraft, or EverQuest at launch? I did. They were buggy messes, and the games changed radically over time - something that was supported by the monthly subscription fees.
---
I realize that these are things that players wanted at launch. I also realize that they cost money. Where else is that money going to come from?
---
If it‘s not fun for me it‘s not fun for anybody :^)
---
Persistent workshops are a future feature.  They will be added but they aren't yet.
---
Lol, you know DLC is only going to be free for 1st members
---
Game is shit, freedom of speech is not free. Don't give them your money
---
While I agree with the premise of your post (asking for a subscription for a bug-ridden game is bad), but I couldn't disagree more with this line:
---
&gt; I mean it does not put non-subscribed players in significant disadvantage 
---
If I were to pay for the sub, then that'd free up 200-300 lbs space of STASH.  Even if you're pretty good about managing your inventory, then that's likely a hefty chunk of STASH that you can now devote to something else.
---
Happened by chip aisle.
---
Not a single point is relevant to the discussion at hand.
---
Only the sycophantic losers that would pay for this are surprised.
---
Madlad
---
I DC'd the first 10 minutes of logging on, went to check how many players were on the map in a public server and I got hit with a controls disabled for 2 minutes then DC'd, haven't played it since.
---
Plans change. Get over it already.
---
&gt; The 4chan fellow owns the domain
---
The hacker known as 4chan*
---
Ah.  Sadly I don't think it's going to be a lot more people than that.
---
lol that level of ignorance doesn’t even warrant a response. Like I said console players have no apparent idea how to judge value proposition. If you worked in marketing or any game dev company you would see clear as day how you are being manipulated.
---
There will be a LOT more people outraged if the game were shut down than the people outraged about recent updates. Plus, you are not forced to pay for anything outside of the base game. It’s not malpractice. Now, if they forced you to pay 15 a month just to play at all, then it would be malpractice.
---
Ok. Assuming it isn't half-finished garbage like 76 was at release, and assuming they don't do everything in their power to make it worse and worse afterwards, and assuming it isn't a paid subscription then I would have to get amnesia to fall for their bullshit again, so if all of that happens I guess I'll see you there.
---

---
Have fun with your stuff disappearing 🐋
---
Higher density of ghouls which become glowing ones.  
---
This was on a private server though so no homes were there.
---
If that was all you got with it, sure.
---
A company asking for compensation for services and products!? Heavens no!
---
So you did nothing involving the subscription and played the game as normal? Amazing.
---
Disappointment.
---
Everything looks fresh as a daisy as far as I can tell (PC). Also, I haven't had any scrap disappear so far.
---
Well that’s enough evidence for me.
---
And burnt money
---
2K really didn't have much in terms of bad rep prior besides the Epic deal so this wasn't them being on thin ice with their player base. Look at Neither Realm, and Rockstar both having issues with over working employees yet they both had/have positive rep over the course of time which didn't make this come off as a massive smear on their rep due to them both being able to smile this off as "Our bad". 
---
In regards to 2K doing this though, they were being very closed lipped about the game, and would legitimately want to find out how he knew what he did. From what I heard him shutting that channel down was completely on him. (Not trying to justify this though.)
---
hey, while everyone is flaming bethesda i just got the game at a cheap price, good opportunity :)
---
Of course its not secure.
---
Fucking Bethesda. Practically circling the drain now.
---
Regardless of how I feel or care about the new FO76 direction, this is bloody brilliant.
---
Yeah, only you can answer if the value makes sense to you.
---
For me, I just look at two things.  One is that I tended to buy Atoms every couple months anyway.  And two is that I really haven't bought other games since 76 came out, so in some sense, I'm sure it saved me more than $99 somewhere along line. 😂
---
I’ll take your be handmade
---
ps4 friend where hackers are less but performance is worse.
---
they've been fucking up constantly for these last few months and I'm really exhausted by it. I'll just pan the flames for couple a days here and move on. I had really high hopes from them but the content draught and this kind of shit killed it for me.
---
you can type BYE!!! :)) if you want now
---
Filed it. I also filed a case with BBB
---
The Bethesda boys are back at it again.
---
Presidential reference? +1
---
Nice to see nothing has changed on r/76, people still complaining all day about the game they've sunk 1500 hours in, people that never bought the game to begin with laughing about how they're glad they never bought it and angry "i'm done with bethesda forever" posts because of X update. 
---
I think it's hysterical people are outraged they'll charge money for unlimited storage. The same idiots that want that probably found the game unplayable with 400 lbs of storage. Great stuff.
---
Malpractice is a medical term. What it is, It’s deceptive and false advertising. 100% in the realm of reportable items to the FTC.
---
"Ah fuck. I can't belive you've done this."
---
I looked there. seems a lot of people really want to hide behind the excuse of "we are just casuals" excuse and most of their points will get shut down if they tried discussing it here. Noone is saying you can't enjoy the game.  With the rules that are on that sub it makes it look more like an echo chamber. As a person who plays Fortnite: save the world I understand where they are coming from. 
---
Some people just don't understand, or just want to block out that their game should not offer some things. I have a real distate and hate for these type of people. I especially hate when "its just convenience" is used. The worst fucking excuse I have ever seen. Also the amount of people who say. "I'm subsribing to support this game" as if bethesda is some poor indie studio.
---
Bethesda bot alert
---
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
---
yes. this.
---
Bethesda wanted some of the private server money so plan was to make some fakes ones where it just locks players from joining it so they don't spend a cent to get servers but get to charge around same amount for Ark server.
---
I've stopped playing. Let me off this roller coaster.
---
Don't buy anything.
---
this is what you get for giving them money.
---
New dimension of p2w
---
*que the NCIS keyboard smacking vid
---
Why aren’t they paying you to make the game better instead of damage control right after ass raping us?
---
I still remember the time when "private server" were server where you had control over the hardware and the configuration of everything running on it.
---
Yeah... i can give you premiun access to my loot for 20$ a month. You can only pick one item per month and the item you took maaaay not work properly. How about that.
---
I think you were wrong not to get it earlier because if you were going to get it, you should have gotten it when it was 35 dollars a week later after release. That way you could have experienced the buggy mess that the game was near release :P
---
I said in my main post: if you're enjoying the game, then carry on. Don't let me rain on your parade.
---
Pc players also have access to the catalog on game pass, not sure if outerworlds is included on the pc side
---
Because Methesda, that's why
---
Haha you got me. Thanks for buying skyrim 8 times.
---
More evidence then most are giving lol.
---
Robert Altman got even greedier for some reason. That’s probably literally the reason.
---
What "goods" did you obtain? You didn't buy a product, you rented a service temporarily.
---
Yet here you are posting.
---
Me and my pals bought the 1 year sub and haven’t been happier.  We had a great time last night.
---
Sorry you’re too triggered to give it a try.
---
They say sheep follow the flock.
---
Well put and thank you. You will probably get alot of downvotes from all the jobless people stuck on SSI. I've been enjoying a private world with my partner and friends away from all the people that make this game toxic all we wanted was a co op fallout and this fits the niche quite well. The private servers are very stable with no lag input from players or monsters feels like fallout 4
---
How is a single player non-open world (hub based) a direct competitor to a multiplayer open world game????
---
&gt;TESO is the most cash-grabbing terrible game I've ever played lol 
---
Really? You can't think of some game that's worse? We're literally in the sub reddit for it
---
Its so bad that within the gaming community its considered an embarassment to play it
---
Preach
---
With what?
---
3 seconds to type a reply lmfao
---
You sound like someone that's never earned over 50k in a year, honestly.
---
probably because I’m not a game designer
---
Don’t buy it!!! There’s a post on this sub that is detailing all the crap fallout first buyers are going through. It’s garbage and doesn’t work. It’s just a money grab
---
I respect the edge on that PS
---
Funny how 24 hours ago you'd have just been another shitposter but are now accurate as FUCK.
---
&gt; 2K really didn't have much in terms of bad rep prior besides the Epic deal so this wasn't them being on thin ice with their player base. 
---
Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford was and has been mired in controversy for many reasons now. A different caliber to Bethesda's perhaps, but the head of the company most certainly has a very bad rep.
---
They sell a sour candy called crybaby tears. They're pretty good. This post reminded me of them.
---
Wow you just cannot stop now can you? Now you can read the future?
---
With the entire sub in flames over this, it is shocking to see Bethesda supporters sorting by new in order to try and influence the direction of how everyone is feeling. /s
---
Honestly I liked fallout 4 more than any other fallout game because of settlements, that being said the rpg elements were seriously lacking in 4 and that was the first nail in the coffin.
---
I don’t think settlements were inherently made so they could lack in other options.
---
Well that was a well thought out post.
---
Goodbye sorry you allowed yourself to have this emotional attachment to a game.  It’s pretty scary stuff.
---
I mean I’ve played Beth games since Morrowind came out and before they bought Interplay all the Balders Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment titles and I would say I’m a huge fan but DAMN.
---
You guys sound like your lives are now over.
---
Way too attached to something not real....
---
Lol close. 54k last year
---
Nothing here is pay to win and there is no payed DLC y'all waiting your time lmao
---
I wonder if people realize anyone from their friends list can join at anytime with very little notification to the player..
---
I killed a few last night, just to see. Two .50 cals, and a laser auto pistol.
---
I kinda miss the .44's
---
Bethesda, please bring back Preston to notify us when there is a body to be buried or to let us know there has been a nuke launched.
---
Thanks,
---
A loyal, paying customer.
---
Your can just block someone for the session and it kicks them out of the private server.  We experimented with it yesterday.  The block only lasts as long as you're logged on
---
yes
---
Think about who made it, then think of New Vegas…
---
your talking out of your ass, fallout 2 was sequel to fallout 1, The game expanded on the lore and gave the player more choices through dialogue, plus it was genuinely funny. Wow that Trump comment was unnecessary, But they unlike bethesda would respect what they did and try to make it better. Also OtW is a spiritual successor to fallout, what I don't get is how the fuck didn't you see the trailer when they announced from the creators of the original fallout. Lmao the jokes are theirs.
---
It's one of the first instances from a AAA company to charge a stupid sum for a minor cosmetic. It is shady because it's disproportionately valued from a customer pov.
---
Wow. You know they dont pay atoms for these comments, right? I get where your coming from, had they been honest I would be right here with you in defense. But they Were Not Honest. Simple as that. It has nothing to do with the financial health of the company anymore, I hope you realize this. 
---
TLDR Life isnt fair and that sucks, but that doesn't make lies acceptable. My mom taught me that over 30 years ago.
---
We've got a great game. The best. And it'll have private servers. Servers you can keep your scrap on. Enough scrap to build a wall. A wall to keep those filthy wastelanders out. Together we're going to make Appalachia great again, and we're going to make EA pay for it!
---
I stopped regularly playing about three months into the game releasing. Tried it again shortly after player vending came out but stopped again. This bs seals the deal of me never coming back. TOW is coming out tomorrow, think I will get that and just probably will never get a Bethesda game again.
---
This has turned out to be a cash grab side project to fund other developments. 
---
It’s a shame they not only were not forthcoming about their interns, but flat out lied about what they were doing.
---
I'm one more bullshit announcement from just giving up on the elder scrolls6 as well.
---
And that hurts me.
---
It's like I'm watching the murder of bioware all over again but this time its suicide.
---
I did say once that a subscription with atoms attached would be cool :( I even said "maybe if it was a better deal than ESO+"
---
I genuinely can't say. My weapons can break at the oddest times.
---
I believe this will be the case. 
---
Can't wait for the "revive upon death in NW" kits
---
or the "never drop loot when you die" addition to FO1st
---
There will be much more bullshit to come..
---
Wait, there are people who actually bought that?
---
In nw correct?
---
Its not them that are ruining the game, its bethesda.
---
Fuck yeah.
---
You could always try Outerworlds in a day and directly fund their competition if you're that hung up. Personally I don't think playing an old title is somehow hypocritical or anything.
---
Cheers
---
I bought a 2nd account for $14 in December, a month after launch. There were cheaper EU accounts.
---
You are the kind of person who would sue amazon when they started selling more than just books online lol
---
You literally started out the conversation by saying something factually untrue, and dismissing the entirety of my argument because of it.
---
That's not how you start out a conversation.
---
Its because people seem to think it's a Private server when it's just a private world. It seems that they just find a "world" on a multi world drive, but it seems like they don't pull a "new world", just any one that is empty at the time.
---
When people throw toxic poo at something, the people who enjoy that are going to steele their resolve.  
---
The more over the top comments people make about this, going as far as calling people who pay for this idiots, is only get those people to keep subscribing.
---
What about it? Fallout 76 is not the same type of game as either of these.
---
The Outer Worlds is a 25-30 hour, small scale story based RPG.
---
so you dont blame Bethesda? STOOGE!
---
Yes i know, I have one. The problem is when I’m farming I’m usually after steel that comes from scrapping weapons and I need workbench for that.
---
Scrap disappearing, already looted items, dead npc's?
---
Would you not complain if you paid real money for this game?
---
I work for a living. I don't appreciate my money get lit on fire and pissed on
---
Like the ending of Old Yeller, but with laughing instead of crying.
---
Outer worlds is bunk af tho. Rather play BL3
---
Exactly this, I made the same comment that a subscription would be good
---
Thats very helpful, which area in the final room do you hang out in? If I wanted to try to find it that is so I can baby step my first solo a bit
---
you can keep on with  your PC is the master race mentality.
---
I dont have to spend thousands a year to upgrade my system to play the newest games.
---
Keep throwing your cash at tech companies though.
---
Ill stick with my 300 bucks every 5-7 years model.
---
So think of that the next time you want to judge value.  I get more of it, because I get to keep my money, you have to constantly upgrade your system to be viable.   I dont.   I used to be one of you, then I realized I was wasting way too much money constantly upgrading processors, MBs, Ram, Drives, monitors ect just to stay current.
---
There are more of us than there are you.  We are the ones that foster the game industry, not PC users.
---
Soooooo if you want it then save and buy the cheaper version? Again, it doesnt prevent you in any way from playing the base game and the upcoming expansion. Seems like some people are the type to drive a 93 honda and scream at those with new cars. You can still drive. I have a 20 year old truck, I dont get angry when a platinum goes by me.
---
It just makes more sense to rent us a server like other game services do, not this weird system where the server shuts down.
---
i still see it live when i go to [falloutfirst.com](https://falloutfirst.com) so its not down yet.
---
I think the reload cap is 30% (Because that is what the max shotgun perk says) So you would miss out on 5%?
---
Hey man.. It's you!
---
Fair enough still I hope the clarification helps someone who does.
---
My wallet is not equal to other folks’. 
---
It’s a minority of consumers that pay for these shitty cosmetics and features.
---
As long as there are whales to fish, Bethesda will fish for them.
---
Call out Bethesda, yes. Call out the idiots who pay and support them too, though. That’s the side of the public shaming that will be even more effective on here.
---
LMAO ... Microsoft OWNES Obsidian. Come on people.
---
Fallout 4, hell I played New Vegas all last night.
---
And hopefully SONY loosened the fuck up.
---
Sweet, so I should probably wait until the next release and the intro is done. Lmao
---
Been burned too many times at this point.
---
I've seen this before on public servers, dead ghouls in a blast area, and it was in one of my nuke experiments where people don't nuke on a regular basis, Morgantown.
---
What system did you play on?
---
Lotta people will defend them no matter what. Todd could go to their house and beat them to death with his hands, record the whole thing and post it it to casual fallout and get ten Platinum and fifty gold on the post.
---
I can't understand corporate apologists. I love fallout, but if they make a shitty thing I'll rightfully call them out on it. These folks have just drunk the Kool aide. The entire mindset is just perplexing
---
You paid for this. What a great feature
---
That's not true at all there are plenty of other modes that allow you to just play the game ..MyTeam is just one standalone mode.  And its not like they restricted the amount of cards you can have and hid an "unlimited card catalog" behind a paywall ..that's what fo76 has done and its more disgusting than anything involved with 2k
---
Guys i don't know about you but I'M TIRED ABOUT ALL THOSE BULSHITTERY coming from bethesda all THOSE LIE, what they actually think we are ? I think its time to an actually real and big Backlash one of they never see before, its time to make them understand that WE have our word on all this and it time to stop taking us for their Milk Cow and thinking that we are stupid, RAISE UP ITS ABOUT TIME !
---
You find that crazy? After everything leading up to it? Lol
---
What are you even talking about?  Are you saying that I am contradicting myself by saying that I both support the HK protesters and also can only speak for myself?  You know those two are not equivalent, right?  “I support XYZ political movement” does not contradict the statement “I do not necessarily agree with, nor will I necessarily try to defend, others who have similar opinions to mine or find themselves in simular situations to mine”
---
So, a nuke could have already been dropped for me when I spawn in? Hey, I like that. Flux for days.
---
You got them man, good one!
---
You already paid for it; you may as well play it if you want to.
---
What's wrong with just a regular link?
---
Lol you some how included old yeller. That's awesome. Upvote for you, even if we differ on opinion.
---
I saw very good reviews from Outer Worlds. Unfortunately I am from that growing group that despises Epic and anything Epic-related. My account was breached and was almost hacked at least 22 times (only had Fortnite and Subnautica but rarely played em) and the personal info of their entire playerbase got leaked TWICE. 
---
Got tired with all their drama and how the CEO "wrote" on Twitter; sent email to Support and got account deleted.
---
Also I am glad for your sake you don't own any Crapple products.
---
Its crazy that the best spiritual successor to a real Fallout game is being downvoted in a subreddit that pretends to like Fallout
---
Microsoft lists the monthly price as £9.99 before VAT....and £11.99 including it. If we're being robbed by anyone it's the UK government.
---
How heavy is that goal post?
---
You are missing the point entirely.
---
Oh shit how can we turn this into a dupe
---
Excited for Wastelanders to come out. Then Starfield and then Elder Scrolls 6. Can't wait!
---
The bigger issue is going to be: 
---
* does a quote from the SVP before the game was even released count as advertising
---
* are they required to stick to a single quote if the market changes
---
likely the answer is no so the complaint will likely get dismissed and won't even be held to them.
---
When you exit a game from the menu it doesn't save?  Or is only when you disconnect?
---
Also, periods are used to break large ideas into multiple small ones. You need them.
---
Only legendary creatures drop legendary items!
---
And to stop using the Reddit sub. We're all tired of seeing you're same posts about being upset about something so trivial.
---
Ha! Nice!
---
It's your right to spend you money how you choose but at the same time you don't have to buy the subscription. I am curious to see the impact this actually haa on the population but I think there is going to be people who do get the sub simply based on the fact of the outcry for the junk collecting robots and then seeing everyone in game having them.
---
Thank bethesda for rushing them to release it under a year. All those problems you can thank bethesda for not letting obisidian work out its bugs before release. Now how about you go back and fiddle with 76 and buy that nice $100 subscription so you and 7 others can play a private world, while the reason people wanted the private world was so they could mod to their hearts content
---
It's not the same world every time either. I captured all workshops and set up the resource collectors. Next morning everything was reset
---
I have 2 (AMD) GPUs in crossfire but I don't have FO76, PM me on discord if I can still help, my discord is 0n#5210
---
I like your comment. You are right. It's more of a desperate 'don't you also get kinda sick of this' post directed towards the community managers. I know they can't respond, I'm not naive or dumb. Just sad. I'm just sad and disappointed.
---
&gt;You should have left a week in 
---
Like the other 98% of people who got the game?
---
It’s arguably the most iconic set of armor in the series, aside from power armor
---
Matter of fact, why don't you think about Elder Scrolls Blades for as long as you can without getting mad and see how long it takes? Don't worry I'll sit here and wait.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

~ *Bethesda, 2019*
---
It would probably be protected under US parody/satire laws.
---
But even if it isn't we don't know what country the owner is, nor the country it's hosted in.
---
That said, suing him would just bring more traffic and attention to it, so it would be a lose/lose for BS.
---
I played for a couple hours last night (PS4). It was business as usual. Ran across a guy dancing while other people stood around watching and throwing a thumbs up. Was pretty funny.
---
It's funny how you assume it's a troll post, are you sure you're not butthurt ?
---
Because based on your replies, it seems that you're really offended.
---
It's cool that you enjoy playing bug report simulator, I guess it's just not for everyone, some people like gaming.
---
Well it did Rob players from all their scrap!
---
Yo I'm not a shill but Xbox game pass is actually amazing. I've gotten to play so many games I never would have bought with it
---
Doesn’t really have a lock. Anyone on your friends list can join your world. It’s bullshit. It should be invite only.
---
Whoomp there it is!
---
No it's not technically private it's like a time share but when you get there no ones flushed the toilets and all the laundry is dirty and someone a random stranger you've met once is liable to walk right in at any moment and do whatever they want in there.
---
It’s also included with the Microsoft Game Pass thing.
---
The answer is up to the FTC to decide. I’d still encourage you to submit even if you feel like it won’t go anywhere.
---
Respectable? I remember horse armor.
---
Idiot.
---
True true, in terms of the gameplay with fallout 4 it was better then 3 and NV, also visuals as well, didn't like the power armor though, nor the ghouls. Story-wise was a piece of shit 3 and 4 was straight up garbage, A kid loses his father, a father loses his son. Barely any dialogue options on how to go about it, less unique NPC's, just settler, more raiders and ferals, it felt pretty bland.
---
But then....76 came out with SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAILS, AND IT JUST WORKED, everything was so much better, not only were the NPCs replaced with audio tapes, and notes that give you quest for you to go on, but the bugs where horrible, old bugs came back into the game, the patched it up and patched it up til they updated one thing and ended up undoing the day one patch. 
---
Pete Hines lied up his ass when he said "no Pay to win mechanics", they charging the atom store with garbage cosmetics, and lets not forget when they finally listened to your ideas it's half baked and instead of giving it out to you for free, they want you to play a subscription
---
No thanks but knew no one would give out stuff as they most don't play the game now and just coming to hate. Noticed no change in number of players on xbox. I hate the change too but dang most of this is just karma whoring.
---
Down the line, if we accept all the shit they serve us, it'll come. If it'll make them money, they will do it, they released a broken game at the expense of their reputation, don't for a second doubt that they'll do it when the market it ripe for it.
---
We deserve it.
---
&gt; Second of all, why would you buy this service?
---
I bought a 1 month subscription because I was planning on buying some of the Halloween stuff and it was either spend $10 for 1,000 atoms or spend $13 for 1,650 atoms and a 1 month trial of the service. 
---
That said, I am having a blast with it. Last night 2 friends and I launched from all 3 silos and had the nuke zone to ourselves. Do you have any idea how awesome it is to not have to deal with assholes one shotting all the ghouls at WS, or one shotting the legendary mole miners during uranium fever?
---
I assume the novelty will wear off soon, and I doubt I'll  continue my subscription (I already have a calendar reminder to cancel in 25 days), but it'll be fun for a couple weeks.
---
Hey man, I gotta be honest... if you steer clear of the Fallout franchise, many of Bethesda's releases since Skyrim are kind of terrific... at very least, above average.
---
Tunnel Snakes rule!
---
This is a good point, I get why player hosted non dedicated servers can’t happen, but they could at least give us actual private servers, which is totally feasible.
---
Also I feel like all the extra stuff shouldn’t have been included in the server rentals because not everyone is interested in both. I do like the idea of a monthly atomic shop subscription separate though.
---
This *is* the game for them.
---
it doesn't matter
---
NBA 2k leverages monetization in a predatory loot box way.  The fact you are trying to defend it because "you never have to spend a dime" doesn't change how other players WILL feel like they have to spend money in order to complete.  
---
All FO76 has is unlimited junk, which really doesn't even provide you with that substantial of a benefit.  Nearly everyone was doing just fine maintaining their junk.  
---
Trying to say "expanded stash" is anything to the level of predatory actions like what goes on in NBA 2K is crazy.  What they are doing in NBA 2K is horrible.  But it doesn't matter, they'll just make 2K21 next year and it will be bought.  No need to worry about what they do this year since everyone just buys a brand new game next year.
---
But yeah, Bethesda is the worst.
---
Wait... wait.. so are you piglet or a sloth?
---
Or better yet take your friends with you and save them from this abomination of a “game”
---
Can we stop even calling them private servers? They aren’t servers by any definition. They’re instances.
---
Some would say yes lol
---
I can't keep up with all this whining it's impossible to hide all these posts. The game has not changed one bit for the worse they're simply adding new stuff to it and we're getting a big dlc soon so cut it out.
---
Ahh. It helps if I read fully.
---
No, it was about preserving single player games.....which they are still doing via Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI
---
I legit don’t even know what that is or even care.
---
I cant tell if this is a sarcasm
---
Me either..just that everything is looted... I got that going for me...
---
At that time I wasn't aware of it. I went in first with Fallout 3 and Skyrim, and then New Vegas. 
---
*Little did I know...*
---
Or the classic: "met my lover on FO76" lol!
---
I'm saying with Realms you have to be online, but you funny have to worry about whoever that owns the Realm(server), in Minecraft, to be online when you want to hop on. F1st does not work like that. It requires you AND the individuals that have the membership online to use the server. Realms is better because you don't have time rely on the one who is paying for it to be online whenever you want to use the server. That's how Realms works.
---
... No actually I have no idea what you meant, that's why I said "I'm not sure what this means".
---
Goodness gracious, you're rather ornery. I get the impression that you didn't actually read the post where I said "If you're enjoying the game, then carry on".
---
I made this post to share a bit of a laugh over the recent "subscription" Bethesda offered because I find the idea that anybody would spend 100 dollars on a game that wasn't worth 60 when it came out a year ago incredibly entertaining.
---
thanks for the input, just changed it to only allow 1 answer per person.
---
Make that 11,999,999 alienated fans I purchased FO4 on release day and I did the same with Fo76 and will do the same on the next Fallout game.
---
you're a joke
---
"From the studio that made Fallout: New Vegas" is the tagline of the trailer
---
Obsidian is the star of the show and Bethesda is the dump truck. They both know it
---
Premium isn't a season pass, or DLC...  
---
Wastelanders, like the vault raids, like the labs, are all free, exactly like he said.
---
But, okay I guess, redefine terms to fit your narrative!
---
It made sense to have people build up specific special stats and perks, but some taks basically want you to do something completely against your build, which is dumb. If they allowed us to max out stats, we wouldn't max out till level 98, so lots of incentive to actually keep leveling past 50.
---
I think it is the other way around. Spent a year thinking that the reason Bethesda we’re incapable of fixing these issues was the fact that very few people actually worked on the game. It turns out they made these mechanics to be annoying on purpose, so they could sell the solutions. It is actually a genius marketing strategy if you can pull it off. If they do, I may start selling frozen turds on the internet. Apparently, people are that stupid.
---
Fallout first is neither a season pass or dlc lol
---
Hey super surprising! The thing you paid Bethesduh for is not as advertised, honestly you are an idiot if you pay for this.
---
Until more people talk about it in the subbreddit, won't believe it. Shit just came out. Prob posting fake shit to get them trending or something.
---
Well, yeah. Sane people point and laugh at the dumpster fire and then move on.
---
While I agree that you are missing the point, I do see where you’re coming from. A premium dlc may not be essential to playing the game, but, going out of their way to add it without fixing existing problems or making “premium” content worth the price tag is down right aggravating.
---
You can...soon...for only $6.99 a month.  If your sub expires then your stats go back to what they were.
---
Let's be honest for a minute, the game sold a lot of copies, great but if you replay fallout 4 without mods, it's not fun playing, while NV I'm always back to playing and enjoying without the mods. So it might of sold twice as much but NV by itself survives, while fallout 4 by itself doesn't
---
does bad press even matter at this point?
---
This guy is a fucking King for this
---
Yeah but having to make the entire convoluted process of creating an account just to get one game is just tedious; I had to do the same with EA Origin, U-Play, and (formerly) Epic and Blizzard. I already have Steam as my primary game library.
---
Cybersquatting may be a thing, but so far this case doesn’t appear to qualify. He isn’t accused of trying to profit in anyway - just legally ridiculing Bethesda.
---
Why did you delete your post???
---
Nah, they knew what they were getting into.
---
Such a great time to be playing this game with all this free stuff flying round haha
---
&gt; Stop blaming the customer seriously.
---
Nah, man. If, after an entire year of screw up after screw up, you're still willing to give them money you are no longer a customer but a paypig, deserving all the blame that's coming your way.
---
It's a joint venture into Idiocracy.
---
Yup. Buy FO3, NV, etc. used if you want, they don't make any money from that.  The old games don't stop being good just because the company that made them did.
---
I am also one of the unicorns this game was made for. Eight year old me fell in love with FOnline 2238 the instant I found it. I've been playing the different FOnline sessions that popped up ever since, although it usually gets boring once you get combat armor and statted weapons because nowadays they all build around dungeons that can't be soloed or PvP. When 76 came out, I got it on launch day because holy shit literally everything I've been dreaming about. But at this point I haven't even logged on since the raids. Too many disappointments, one after another. I can't even play my power fantasy because the damage bug makes some of my favorite weapons useless. 
---
Sob story aside, I'd suggest waiting a few weeks. You can still end up snagging the ranger armor if you really want it at the end of this subscription cycle, but there seem to be a lot of issues with the servers and scrapbox, so you might see changes/delays/price drops soon based on that
---
Just sent it to all my friends who play this game.
---
so much potential with this game....
---
look at where we are now :(
---
I've never felt I needed to spend money in 2k so I can't comment on that ..like I said I don't play myteam there are plenty of other modes (MyGM, Play now online, MyLeague) that don't involve cards that's such a small part of the game
---
Upvoted for schizo
---
yes don't ever log out at your camp when you have a pet it makes them die or dissapear
---
edit: always log out far enough away your camp can't possibly be rendered in
---
edit2: i have had the same mirelurk king for about 8 months using this method and i play every day
---
Kinda deserved it tbh.
---
Unfortunately this only works if 100% of the consumers do that.
---
As cool as this is it will be buried in a matter of minutes from the ravaging anger of days past posts.
---
Skyrim success got to their head
---
Every company keeps more metrics than you could even imagine. Data is Money
---
&gt;  The game has not changed one bit for the worse
---
In what deluded dream are you living at?
---
&gt;When we loaded in, most of the lead spots and areas for plastic were gone. Definitely was a 'used' server lol
---
The game still keeps track of what you've looted so that you can't just server hop Morgantown HS for unlimited plastic. Are you sure the spots that were looted last night hadn't been previously looted by you guys in the alst 20 hours or whatever the respawn is?
---
Really???
---
It’s on life support now. Funny thing is, it was on the mend for a long time, and then Bethesda hit it with a “fallout first” sized blunt object and knocked the game back into the hospital. 
---
Seriously, it makes no sense.
---
How about you let an a person decide what they want to do with their money especially if it involves something you disagree with.
---
oh, you still here frank? :D
---
It definitely can. A letter to the registrar about how the domain name itself (not the contents of the site) violates a trademark or copyright is all it takes. I dont know who the registrar is here because I genuinely dont care but if its foreign one they may just brush it off until real legal action forces them to do otherwise.
---
Are... are you serious? I get called a "idiot shill" for over a year now regularly because I enjoy fallout 76 and thinks it's fun. But If I say that I don't think TESO is fun...then I must clearly be hating on people who enjoy it. Have you even LOOKED at the 76 thread recently, it is NOTHING but people hating the game, and if anyone says otherwise, they're called stupid! People are like "I'm angry that I have the OPTION to pay a few extra dollars for no additional gameplay, just a couple perks" but also "I would love it if 76 was more like a game that costs hundreds of dollars just to unlock more story"
---
oh yeah you got the atoms that disappear each month, basic clothing that shouldn't have to be paid for... oh and all the bugs you can take up the behind cause you are still paying bugthesda to roll around in their trash fire oh wow so jealous\~
---
Oh yeah because companies a hundred years ago really cared about your property. 12 hour work days, 6 days a week, paying women less than men, IrisH less than women, and refusing to hire blacks at all. Woe is me how America has fallen!
---
Products are goods or services. 
---
Unless you want to tell your housekeeper they do not have a product, or your heating and cooling guy, or your plumber, or your lawncare service, ect.
---
I mean, characters should be unique to private servers. Modding isn't detailed but it is likely planned. Maybe we could port adventure characters over and not the other way around.
---
Sounds like you got what you deserved
---
Good. We should send him donations to keep the site active untill Bethesda shits the bed
---
Destiny2 doing pretty good right now... top5 on steam of late and its not even that popular on PC compared to console so not too shabbbby.
---
The Outer Worlds is not an online game. The game is a 25-30 hour small scale story based RPG. 
---
People will have time for both.
---
Are you being serious?
---
People are still playing 76? I thought this was just a sub to make fun of the game
---
Well if it’s about money then selling scrip packages nets them more than hand tailored legendaries. It’s never beneficial for a game company to give the gamer exactly what they want quickly as it doesn’t promote continue play or pay of the game.
---
NV will never be buried no matter how hard they try. but their company on the other hand....
---
I think this is what I needed to read. Thanks buddy.
---
You enjoying it has nothing to do with what's right and wrong.
---
Just because you enjoy it, doesnt mean you should turn a blind eye ether
---
Honestly the only thing keeping me playing 76 at this point was the hope that Wastelanders would deliver. After this steaming pile of shit they dumped on us I highly doubt I'll even bother checking it out.
---
But the game is designed to want people to spend money, just buying the game, even if you never spend a time, continues to encourage them to make games that way.
---
Agreed :P Happy cake day!
---
Awesome! I love interesting and original camps, thanks for sharing.
---
I totally agree as far as Fallout 4 having a weak story. I often criticize it for that as well. It also has cliche af characters. 
---
As far as 76 being buggy? Welcome to every fallout ever released since 3. Including NV. Which was arguably one of the biggest Fallout launches. I already posted a slew of launch reviews complaining about bugs, but can reshare them here if you care to disagree. 
---
As for P2W? Cry me a River. They're releasing barely useful non cosmetics. Not one of those things solves an actual problem I have. 
---
Nor is this a competitive game really.... So P2W? Meh. I don't care if some schmuck has infinite junk storage. It literally impacts me in no way.
---
Hope you dig it!
---
Fallout 4 only supported this in as much as the Economic Principle of The Larger Feeds the Smaller. That is to say, they can operate at a loss in one area because of profit margin in another area.
---
One could also argue that since FO76 is based off of a cut multiplayer mode from FO4, that it was supported in that manner.
---
All that said, I *did* buy the game. Kind of. I got the bundle with the Yeti Blackout, and I got that on sale. So really, Blue Microphones and Best Buy paid for my copy. But to look at it like "oh they've already made back their profit, it doesn't matter" isn't the right way to view it. It's about sending a message. But, as you didn't buy the game, you've no horse in the race, so it likely doesn't matter to you.
---
"Daddy I like the punishment! Give me your broken dick, daddy!"
---
Cant feel bad for them pay to win MF'ers tho.  Make me laugh to read their scrap is poofing.
---
I love you man
---
Actually, looking at Pete Hines’ tweets, we may not have a case due to his use of vagueries in terms of what qualifies as “DLC.” Man’s a piece of shit, but the trouble is, he’s a smart piece of shit.
---
washingtonpost here. it's not one chance per zone.  you can freely move among the zones, they're just more clearly zoned out than one large wasteland map.
---
That being said, people probably bought 76 expecting it to be an actual Fallout game. In which case those people were probably massively disappointed
---
"Poorly received by a vocal minority on r/FO76", you mean.
---
Not every Microsoft game is on game pass.
---
You mean 18 months, which is still short, but hardly less than a year.
---
I love when people imply I'm being unfairly apologetic, but will then exaggerate any excuse they can to defend their stance.
---
You could feed an entire 3rd world village for the cost of this service.
---
Instead you opted to enable and support these shitty behaviors. You deserve to lose your scrap.
---
*Everybody hated that*
---
I in no way have power or control over this persons decision making. I am using my right to free speech. Nice galaxy brain take though.
---
My point was just that they're idiots that don't know better. :P
---
Turn off auto renewal in settings on the dashboard.
---
Private sever lag was worse than I’ve ever seen in a public sever yesterday, you’re incorrect bud
---
My game as so lagging I froze up on crafting stations at least 4-5 times and was unable to craft with spamming buttons, also could not exit stations without spamming buttons
---
Hard Hiss Drive ... I'm Argonian ... lol
---
HDD
---
Dude, been playing uranium fever on private server last night. Got all of the stars it said it would, only exception I’d want people in it is for SBq
---
The dead ghouls in nuked areas, if they were non-glowing bloated ones they would be the ghouls killed by the nuke. If they weren't... _shenanigans_
---
literally, articles are being published about how bad it was received. there are more people online complaining about it then there are actual active users at this point.
---
It wouldn’t be about winning for the site owner either. It’d be weeks or months before the case even makes it to court. By that time everyone will have seen this site, reported on it, and laughed about it. At that point the owner can take it down because who cares the damage is done.
---
Finally some rationale.
---
I wanted private worlds and unlimited scrap storage, not reused worlds and a scrap box that deletes all my junk.
---
You guys done?
---
The people who don't like it aren't really playing anymore
---
Was there an ITV today??
---
I love 76, it's my favorite game. TESO and Ark:SE are the worst games I've ever played. 76 is amazing in comparison.
---
The gaming community is toxic, terrible,sexist and entitled, I think it's an embarrassment to be a part of the gaming community. I do not give a shit of what the borderline hive-mind gaming community thinks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you find out let me know bud. Im probably going to buy a months when I get paid but not sure after that.
---
You realize I'm not the person you were initially taking to right?
---
Yeah, for sure, there some karma whoring. There's also gamers who are tired of being fucked in the ass without lube by a company who's getting greedier and greedier and fail to deliver a stable product. That is all.
---
Thanks for making a happy post. I really like the camp. ❤️
---
Yup, and they say "why do you care how I spend my money?"...because your idiotic spending is ruining my hobby you gd mouth breather...hell even at work this shit is affecting me.  The conversations/meetings are no longer about what fun things we can make and are almost always about monitization... straight up cancer in this industry.
---
If you have $13 you can spare for a couple days you can buy a 1 month subscription, unlock the outfit and emotes, spend the 1650 atoms, and then get a refund because you weren't satisfied with the product due to (insert reasons such as recycled worlds, scrap disappearing, whatever).
---
I'd keep it as it is.
---
Nice try Bethesda.
---
Just a heads up, anthem has some sweet Halloween skins and fking awesome new weapons if anybody else bought that game out of anticipation, and didn’t like it, it has gotten better in many ways.
---
Yes, its capitalism, and they shouldt take a taste of their own greedy capitalism. Another will come and make it a lot better without only seeing making profit. They making Profit over time, if people are statisfied with it. They are not able to handle it, so they about to have a problem. That Greedyness wont work.
---
Bethesda = Ferengi
---
Why would I give it a try? I've given this company so much money already and purchased a 300 dollar plastic helmet and a bag that wasn't the marketed material because I loved these developers so much. How can you be such a daft wanker to not see they want to bleed you whales for every penny. Remember Nuka Dark as well? More lies. Anyone who was smart jumped ship months ago, I stuck around too long for this shit and delaying wastelanders to pump out this garbage is despicable.
---
LOL as I skimmed through this post I was thinking the exact same thing. Jesus. Someone doesnt have a job.
---
Annnnnnnnnnnd.... HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm glad you're continuing to purchase stuff for the game, which perpetuates the shitty cycle of greed from Bethesda.
---
Glad to see you're having fun, while others are experiencing bugs, loss of scrap, etc. I mean. All of you that put money into this are why Bethesda keep pulling shitty moves like this. If people had just NOT bought the game, and not thrown in on this "I can play with less shitty people" it might have forced Bethesda to consider making the servers something people can host, or they'd have you know... made a better game. But whatever floats the boat of people continuing to support this shitshow of a game and company.
---
I'm sorry but the community needs to rally on this - if you support these heinous, abusive, anti-consumer practices you deserve to get screwed over.
---
It is not cool to spend money on video games. It is not cool to spend money on DLC or power-ups. It is not cool to pay for features that are free in other games.
---
The phone number for the National Council on Problem Gambling is 1-800-522-4700. Loot boxes and loot drops are a form of gambling. The first step is admitting the problem.
---
So much contradiction here lol. Agreed with you at the first sentence but the rest is just nonsense.
---
 You have no idea what the word "ethical" means.
---
Shut up, Bethesda employee
---
Oh...oh...I think I can already hear a diehard F76 fan hastily typing “BYE” lol.
---
I hope so. I am absolutely loving 1st. It’s petty amazing to have the whole world to myself and the tent is fucking great! Pets would be the cherry on the sundae.
---
Hey, if anyone doesn’t want their things, my gt is castiell777
---
That's not exactly high on the totem pole.
---
Gotta love the internet. Classy move warning everyone, hopefully they straighten you out. 🍺
---
I stuck by this game since beta and there was a lot of bullshit to put up with. I got flak from my friends who tried it and quit with all the bugs and duping issues and nerfing everything. I kept trucking and up until I heard the news this was still my favorite game. I have invested several hundred hours into the game but I didnt even think twice about uninstalling when I heard this pay to win bullshit
---
Nah they knew what they were buying. No compensation needed
---
Isnt Chris the creator
---
wrong reddit to post man.
---
This community like to get Pete and Todd a free way to their wallets
---
They can file copyright infringement claims against the guy for using their graphics. It *should* be protected use since it's parody and also editorial in nature, but I doubt the dude will want to pay a lawyer to make that argument for him.
---
4 was awesome
---
I can't understand what about this makes you want it.
---
Very nice.
---
That seems like a complete non issue.
---
Not to mention Xbox game pass is dirt cheap for a 3 month trial
---
Also isnt it kind of weird to complain about exclusivity when we're in the FO76 subreddit?
---
I don’t think you are correct at all, sorry to say.
---
I lost all my junk &amp; you can replicate it by doing this:
---
Why don’t you try “saving” your character using your method &amp; then try what I wrote above ^.
---
I bet your junk still disappears. The junk box itself is completely broken &amp; I personally wouldn’t trust it with one broken piece of glass.
---
Or, you could pick up 27¢ per day. That’s the amount for a years subscription
---
The problem is the high cost and the lack of these features currently. It was obvious that having a private world would be at added cost, nor should anyone expect to get that for free.
---
Never seen fomo before. But i quit world of warships cold Turkey after dropping $300 on ships when they broke it. Dropping this should be pretty easy. Outer worlds Friday dude.
---
#Bethesda employees are in this thread
---
**Yes and No.**   
---
Bethesda Updated a couple posts and their [FAQ](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48688/~/scrapbox---fallout-1st---fallout-76), the word "Junk" and Scrap were both used.  
---
As they clarified the FAQ I've moved it down to Quality of life.
---
It really sucks how profitable whaling is. It allows companies to ignore most of their playerbase and cater to those who have so much money that they don't give a shit on what they spend their money on.
---
Most defenders moved to filthycasuals.  They are over there being happy about it all.
---
Bad press is also bad press, you didn't think this out did you?
---
For real?
---
They can do something according to the law, you can dispute the domain ownership to handle cases like this.
---
I've spent 1200 hours in this game so far. 
---
It has issues, but it was still fun, playable, and Fallout I could play with my wife. 
---
Now I can't even load it up out of sheer anger and betrayal. Which seems dramatic but damn. I just feel so betrayed.
---
Never Change 4chan
---
Is there a heavy gun that kills decent and has an easier ammo or more efficient? I believe mine is a 2 shot light machine gun.
---
You know what will help you avoid this problem?
---
Stop giving money to a developer who routinely does things like this.
---
The phone number for the National Council on Problem Gambling is 1-800-522-4700. Loot boxes and loot drops are a form of gambling. It's okay to admit you need help escaping this addiction.
---
I'm right there with you, after everyone who hadn't played it bashed it, I was always saying I actually like it, it has something about it still, there still is lore, stuff like that, but doing this crap is just going over the line, and that is why I am going back on all I've said, cause it is just pointless now, all of it.
---
Could say that about the canvas bags too, except it’s not what they wanted and not what they thought they were buying. The “private worlds” are not private and the unlimited scrap box deletes your scrap
---
Oh worry not, they're all sweatilly rubbing one out in a basement conference room, fantasizing about all of the whales they'll bleed dry and the young kids they can take advantage of.
---
As soon as they finish their week long orgy of greed and cynicism, they'll get their talking points together after combing this forum and others for best possible arguments, made by pathetic sycophants and losers with their egos tied to a game they can't even own.
---
Believe me, u/LadyDevann's hands are sticky and her face is flushed. She's panting with ecstasy at the mere notion that you believe she's not completely complicit and completely on board with the raping of IP and mining of parents' wallets, the abuse of addictive personalities, and the utter disregard for basic human ethics.
---
But then what do you win from devoting said stash to something else?
---
1. Will check shortly and get back to you. I suspect you’re correct.
---
2. Haven’t been able to isolate the incident, seems to randomly happen. Emote wheel will flash on the screen and immediately be overlain with weapon wheel
---
3. I did swap to crafting cards and back but didn’t play long enough to notice any changes. Can test this one today too.
---
4. Public world, I always wait for atom shop to show on main menu before logging in to a world because I try not to throw more tasks at the game than it can already barely handle :)
---
Thanks as always for your diligence!
---
I  have no idea where this game is going.
---
It had so much potential at the start.A beautiful big,open expansive World.
---
Even the in game content we have had thus far has not been great if i am being honest
---
It has all felt very repetitive/aimless,and [souless.Like](https://souless.Like)  in game content was added only as an after thought.That feeling has stayed with me all the way through the Game.Fallout 4 was the polar opposite.
---
I personally think Wastelanders was supposed to be released yesterday with the other [stuff.To](https://stuff.To) take the sting out of it.Instead it wasn't ready,so Beth went ahead with it anyway.
---
I think if truth be told Fallout 76 is now in its death throws,it is now likely a testing ground for much needed feedback .
---
Bethesda  killing the game by a thousand Cuts to speed up its demise.
---
I spent 2 hours on before with the "Common Folk" in the Open World,all 5 us.
---
I wondered if i was on a private server by mistake.
---
"Shit happens" like shit hasn't been happening for a year non-stop? The raid was unplayable garbage, bugs are still in the game from a year ago and people like you are ready to forgive these half-wit greedy developers and shovel more money forward on top of the 60-300 you already have put in. Like please, shill more, brush off more bullshit and keep buying atoms.
---
Just contacted me.
---
Havent played in a while, could someone parade explain?
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
I will. Im just relaying what my dataminer friend said.
---
could just PC..  
---
Right now if I block someone on my friends list (the Session block, not the permanent one) players on your friends list can see you in world, on their friends list..    
---
But you can't hear them, they can't trade with you, and in one instance, were invisible until unblocked.
---
*Boy, everyone is stupid except me.*
---
They are literally collecting the pathetic weasel comments made here and elsewhere defending them.
---
dumbed down piece of shit
---
Good! You traitor.
---
Fell better about yourself now?
---
Dang, you only got fucked by Todd twice? lucky
---
I think Bethesda has realized that they're not gonna be making much more money off of 76 so this is what they're doing to try and make up for the lost profits... I also have a feeling that the delay in the wastelanders update is from a severe lack of morale on the dev team, so that on top of the subscription makes me wonder if Bethesda has just given up on this game
---
I was being sarcastic which I now realize wasn’t obvious
---
While yes simplified it was a damn good game
---
Oh I'm not saying open world is the only thing that makes Fallout... Fallout. 
---
However.... The open world is a huge, significant trademark of the fallout series. The exploration. The setting of the wasteland, it's aesthetic, it's little hidden spots and stories, are a huge part of it.  One of the most exciting parts of a new fallout game is the new world to explore 
---
The other things it shares? Again, just as in line with a Mass Effect comparison. Great writing. Great quest lines. Diverse choices. Companion driven stories, diversity in how to tackle situation.... Mass Effect does similar. 
---
OW shares more with Mass Effect than Fallout as far as I'm concerned. Which isn't a bad thing. It's just not the "new fallout".
---
Fallout says "Welcome to the wasteland.... Go nuts. Do what you want. Go where you want. Explore how you want"
---
OW says "We have an amazing story to tell, with many different ways to tell it... But you're going tonnage to somewhat follow along a path...."
---
We've decided to make Wastelanders a separate game all for the low price of $59.99!  Fallout First members will of course get a discount at $59.97!
---
unfortunately it looks like you are exactly right
---
12$*, 100 is for the full year.
---
me too man
---
The 2nd camp and such. 1 of my post was harped on about the content in the update since i didn't put thw spoiler headline. So i was just covering my ass incase someone else complains about there being a spoiler lol.
---
Dude your post history and fanboyism for Bethesda and defense of a corporate entity is absolutely embarrassing. This company bends you over and you're literally defending them because, why? Why would you still play this objectively shitty game to this day? Why would Bethesda give free private servers? Maybe because this game FUCKED OVER THEIR COMMUNITY. Maybe they could gain points for doing so. They have PLENTY of money to do this and would go a long way but instead they just keep drilling down on fucking over consumers. This company is shit, and worse than EA. EA backs off when people fight back whereas Bethesda keeps going and getting worse. You're the only person still on their side dude.... Jesus christ its embarrassing
---
I mean let's be fair, it looks like they copied the fallout first subscription idea from ESO. Both games are buy a copy to play. Unlimited craft bag just called unlimited scrap box and the monthly crowns in ESO is an atoms allowance. ESO does have lootboxes in the form of crown crates, paid expansions, paid dlc dungeons (free with ESO+), and the ESO store has $200 houses, furniture packs, skill lines you can outright buy + skill points (skyshards packs) for people making alts. The difference for fo76 is there's way less quests and less things to do, and much more bugs. ESO has features like long loading screens, combat bug, animation bugs, server performance problems, EU servers constantly have login problems, etc but ESO has way more content than fo76.
---
I really wanted to like this game.  Like, I bought five gift copies at preorder price, as well as my own  Fallout 76 Tricentennial Edition at 80 bucks.   I've always been a fan of Fallout, and sure, Fallout 4 felt a little lackluster and unmotivated, but 76 promised to be constantly updated with tons to do!  Yet for a game about vaults, it has what, one open vault finally?  Over half the players have retardedly powerful guns due to people getting into the Dev Rooms and selling off amazing weapons, making it impossible to compete in things like nuke zones where someone's one hitting everything with a power fist, or beating the final boss in a couple hits before anyone else can even tap the damned thing.  And now they want 15 bucks a month for what is essentially quality of life improvements with the tent and the scrap box, or just being able to play an empty server and hold all the scrap points for stock up on everything, which isn't going to appeal to half the players anyways since everyone knew about the artillery box glitches and how to dupe items, or even just random assed bugs like my camp being unplacable, so the game giving me 80x of each item to place back down, with no limit on said items, making my camp into some hellish water reserve of laggy server killing doom.  
---
Maybe, like, if it was a stable, viable game, just with a few bugs, then maybe it would have been loved like Borderlands 3 on launch, bugs and all.  But instead it's a lack of content and lack of development on content even currently in the game, (Do we even have legit access to the presidents room in the bunker yet, or any interaction with the whole voting thing thrown around the map?) it just ends up looking like there's not a whole lot to do other than abuse glitches or, now, just pay an extra hundo a year to have private stockpile parties.  
---
It just really feels like a great big middle finger from bethesda to their fans.
---
This decision of Beth's is silly for multiple reasons. Hopefully they'll release it for NV fans in the future.
---
I don’t think paying $60 for Call of Duty is worth it either but I can’t imagine being so far up my own ass that I would go into the COD subreddit telling players I feel sorry for them and thinking anyone would care what I have to say. You are just trolling, you aren’t being some kind of kindly sage, you’re just being a typical trolling asshole.
---
Oooh it gets funnier, wait till you see people defend it in the comments lol.
---
If you have read my earlier post, you'd know that's not what I mean.
---
I kept repeating this: The convenience does not put up as an advantage over other players.
---
Try the side door.  The front door is buggy as hell.
---
Jesus christ, its just a roman outfit. It doesnt even look like the legion armor.
---
Actually, I do. All of that was already pre-written.
---
Do the "lies" and "BS" and all the external drama actually affect *your* enjoyment of the game?  Actually playing it, not just talking about it, or theorycrafting about the principles of microtransactions. I notice in your entire post here, you've not mentioned once whether you actually liked playing it, or whether any of this drama affected that enjoyment. 
---
That's telling that you spent multiple paragraphs complaining about external things (canvas bags, helmets, rum, etc.) and praising Youtubers who make their money professionally shitting on the game..... but you had nothing substantive to say at all about whether any of these things actually had any significant effect on *your personal* gaming experience. 
---
Goddamn, the outrage machine in gaming is worse than politics these days.
---
You Rock! Here i am browsing the drama and here you come with a lightning bolt to my brains. I Never Once played Nuka World, 980 hours in and refused after the paid mods blah blah. I assumed things were changing and saved it for a rainy day, Today is that rainy day! Time to forget about this fake fallout and get into one with story and depth. Sounds like a joke but I am quite serious, to this day I still only have 4 hours in The Witcher 3 for this same reason. Games and gaming is sure changing, forget Ethics and do what needs be done, they're called Games for a reason and until they are referred to as Investments I think your good to go.
---
I can't consider 76 a Fallout game but some people still *actually* play it
---
That one really leaves you head scratching
---
I went back to Fallout 4, but will return for Wastelanders unless Bethesda asks me to pay for it, which is likely. I stopped trusting them with this private server shit, that's for sure.
---
it doesn't count as a handjob if it's DIY
---
When it starts it will be this under the search. twich.tv/bethesda
---
Will try, thanks!
---
They will add it as a halloween costume
---
That doesn’t make any sense.
---
Having unlimited storage space for junk gives you crazy leverage to purchase legendaries.  You can either trade directly or sell off junk for caps to buy legendaries.
---
So yeah, they basically are letting you buy legendaries.
---
Good to know it's not happening on PS4.  
---
I was able to confirm it on PC, however it might be related to Latency / Server lag, vs a constant issue, a few people had it happen every time they tried the Scrap-box, so hoping for more feedback from the community as to how much of an issue it is.
---
Until people actually start bitching about it on reddit, I won't believe forbes.
---
Get yeeted on Bethesda, you big nerds.
---
Yes please. I really want that quote everywhere. What a liar
---
i wonder if "modding" will simply mean
---
adjusting some of the server options  soon
---
hahahahahaha.
---
What's super fucked is the music doesn't stop if the emote does. You can even stack music to be super annoying. NEW FORMS OF GRIEFING
---
except it doesn't even work and you get somebody else's leftover world that people on your friendlist can join whenever they want.
---
It's sad but true. Let's cry together friend
---
It’s happened to me &amp; I have replicated the problem. Here is how you can have your junk deleted as well:
---
— Force quitting while loading into adventure and then loading into a private server is what caused me to lose my junk a second time — 
---
Definitely not hyperbole, or a lie. 
---
Real issue.....
---
I would definitely try Destiny 2 if you're interested in looter shooters
---
Reduce the price to like $5. Move ranger armor to atom shop for like 1000 atoms, Get rid of the tent as it removes much of the downsides to being over-encumbered, make scrap storage a standard game feature not behind a pay wall, even if they made it limited capacity, like 800 for just scrap.
---
Yeah, it's cool and edgy to make fun of Bethesda and all, but equating "someone spent money on a thing I don't like" with mental illness is a shitty thing to do, and makes you a part of the stigmatization of those with mental illnesses. 
---
Be better, man.
---
You could probably make a suggestion to add more items from base Fallout 4 (The game that is the framework for 76) and they'd take that as an invitation to put a price tag on those items that already exist.  They already solidified their position when they put a price tag on the bungalow, which is something that already existed in base Fallout 76 in several locations, but rather than making it a blueprint we could find or buy in stores, it needs Atoms to buy.  Well done, Bethesda.
---
It really is depressing that Bethesda doesn't understand the concept of fan feedback to improve the actual game for everyone's enjoyment. I know when I make suggestions, I'm asking for more base game content that is available to all players. Not just people who can afford to pay.
---
Well...  
---
Can't say I enjoy people loosing work / money, but won't argue with a general disappointment with the state of things.
---
Naw they would have had to have done their job to begin with to quit. They only ever respond to posts that amuse them and have never engaged any criticism in a meaningful way. They have been terrible community managers
---
I guess you never watched the Apple release for the iPhone 11 “Pro”.
---
&gt; The scrap disappears from the instance, and can’t be found again from re-logging or anything. It’s just gone. 
---
So, unlimited recycling?
---
only in fallout 76 could stash become such a hot button issue ;-)
---
Man, as someone who is in marketing, Pete Hines is one of the worst PR representatives I’ve seen in the industry. Where are they when everything goes to hell? But he sure is there for the positive community stuff and announcements
---
you have to pay for netflix, hulu, crackle, disney, appletv, amazon prime, and youtube red. epic launcher is free
---
You're a very reasonable person btw. I enjoyed this post. Not being sarcastic.
---
i think the problem is that the game had such a rough start that all the plans regarding new content simply couldnt be fed by the games income, therefore now they need to monetarize the game in order to improve it, wich shrinks the playerbase (income) even more and so we are in a downward spiral leading to the inevitable fail of this game in the "near" future
---
i love this games potential and i invested a lot of time in it, id love to see it succeed but im almost certain that the support for this game will drop before the end of 2020
---
ok. given that at 76 peak it only had 400k actual active users and daily number have fallen sharply in the past 3 months, i'd imagine there's less then 200k users who log in today (but you can't get numbers that up to date).... but sure. i get it. fallout 76 is a good portion of your identity. defend it til death brother!
---
That's reddit in general. It's the loudest site of all when it comes to games, and definitely doesn't represent the majority all the time
---
Yeah, guarantee nothing close to that conversation happened
---
COD and Outer Worlds will both be out tomorrow, so most of the normal servers will ‘feel’ private.
---
Sorry, though there was a paint pack for 1800 at one point.
---
After the recent delay of wastelanders and then saying they wanted it to be the best and most stable update yet, I assumed they had a new policy for update stability and quality CLEARLY I was mistaken
---
The ammo went back into my inventory.
---
What sucks is... I didn't hate F076... but its not really the game I wanted(and honestly just underwhelming... talk about dated graphics, animations, boring scripts etc)... I just wanted a fallout to Co-Op with the wife in which we did make happen, but headaches like scrap limits, annoying players, bugs, and server issues, combined with the other great games on the market, ment we kinda just faded out of the game after first couple months... Seeing features that are things we really would have liked to see in the game now become possible for a "Price" is a slap in the face... and it's really annoying. I am really tired of "Games as a service" excuse, don't sell me a full price game then spend its entire life cycle trying to milk more money out of me in the form of paywalls its fucking annoying.
---
 I wanted to support this game being a lifelong fan of Fallout and(Bethesduh) honestly enjoyed all them from the classics to even \*GASP\* 3, Vegas, and 4! So we have the tricentennial(?whatever version I forgot?) edition and the stoopid helmet with o so famous bag version... we spent more than enough money on the game.. yet here they are again with a fucking hand extended out, asking for more... NO fucking No. Learn to do your fucking jobs and hire people who can manage shit better, or just go under at this point. 
---
Never have I become so fucking concerned about a upcoming title  (TES) because of the shitshow that a predecesor has leveled.... Its this level of fuckery that makes me even question if I would purchase TES when it comes out. The fuckery of the gaming industry rather exclusive status, game as service status, MTX, is really starting to force me to not buy half the games that I would just purchased in the past, sports games are ruined, Battlefield and half the dam shooters are going down the hill, or peddling out content at the speed of a snail to the point of killing off thier audience/playerbase... It just sucks.. how many failures and dumpster fires is it gonna take for the industry to fucking wake up and realize the amount of money they are missing out on by not delivering. Shit like this makes Rockstar and their MTX even look good because at least they have the blow on the table in front of you while you pony up the cash, and not simply whispering sweet lies in your ear while they reach for a bottle of lube... that you know they aren't gonna use.
---
exactly

Excuse me, why the hell aren't you employed at BGS.

It's so beautiful!
---
This fallout first bullshit was the last straw for me, I’m fucking uninstalling, I’m going back to fallout 3
---
Almost every other AAA games have potentials. They look good and gameplay itself also pretty good. But there are problems which involved with money. Micro transaction, Rpg elements, forcing to play online and so on. But funny thing is bethesda’s games have no good side of AAA games have. But they gets more and more greedy. They should have at least decent products. I don’t know what they are thinking. So much confidence, self-ego.
---
So much this
---
GARBAGE COMPANY!!!
---
Which is easier, to cease and desist, or to fight..? Can they still sue immediately after a cease and desist?
---
My whole post was facetious.  We need, like, hmmm...yeah, you know what we need?  Have you ever seen how you can click on something that is a spoiler alert?  We need like an option to click text to see if it was meant as sarcasm.  That way you wouldn’t be in on the joke from the beginning, but you could verify it wasn’t stupidity in the end lol.
---
Did your mom also teach you that it's possible to disagree with people without accusing them of being paid shills?
---
Thanks, I think my hard drive deserves a bit of breathing room. More room for modded FNV runs
---
Well, it's not exactly the same, but I used to play this dress up game :/ it was bad. You couldn't finish the game without making purchases and it got like that over a period of time til boycotts of the game started being initiated. Within the game's messaging system the word boycott was actually blocked, you couldn't send any messages with the word in it.
---
If there were problems in the game they gave the US server users less good "we're sorry!" gifts and give users on the servers in China 100s of in game currency. It was obvious the US server users were being milked. I had to stop playing.
---
I polled some friends in a PC gaming chat, one friend was very angry about EA's MO. It's not a bait and switch but EA is notorious for buying really ground breaking gaming studios, kill them so they can cannibalize them which leaves former fans if those companies v sad. https://heavy.com/games/2017/10/studios-ea-has-killed-visceral-games/
---
nah lets add more p2w stuff my man
---
To be fair, Fallout wasn’t always Bethesda’s though... and New Vegas was one of if not their biggest successes in the gaming community. 
---
Wouldn’t make sense not too, doesn’t have anything to do about comparing to Bethesda
---
You know I just now realized that you said "un-informed". Bit of a misread on my part, though I will say: at least I read the entirety of your post and haven't flown in to profanity over it.
---
Ah well. Honestly if you still enjoy Fallout 76... all the power to you my friend, I just can't see how you would enjoy a game that was objectively broken at launch and from what I've heard ( and yes I've done research on the subject ) it hasn't improved much in a year.
---
The fact that they pushed back an update that would make the game feature complete to sell things that should be in any game at launch a year later would strike me as a twist of the knife that they stuck in your back when Todd Howard said this game would work as intended. :P
---
This is where I don't get your hostility, I'm on your side. I wanted Fallout 76 to be good, as good if not better than Fallout 4. I'm not telling you to not enjoy the game, I'm saying that regardless of your enjoyment of the game it was built on broken promises and outright lies that continue to this day.
---
As an aside... say what you will about Call of Duty, at least the games work at launch. xD
---
And FO76 is a 25-30 minute tech demo from 2008
---
TOW is still more of a Fallout game. At least it has the pedigree
---
Very reasonable. But what do you think would be a membership benefit.
---
Can you elaborate on this guarantee?
---
For now.
---
I would pay $50/year for an account wide stash (400lbs), scrap, misc, AND ammo weights at 0, truly private and persistent servers, a smaller allowance of atoms, and a straight up 20-50% off on further atoms. Exclusive atom shop items should be strictly cosmetic (hell, all atom shop items should be). Fridge and collectron should be dirty and beat up in-game versions with skins for sale. All future utility items should follow suit.
---
Why would you buy this?
---
Their initial price point is too high. $12.99 breaks the psychological pricing that $9.99 (sub $10) would have had. Under $10, I think a majority of people would have made a quick cost-benefit comparison, and shrugged.
---
Huh?
---
&gt;I'll never support EGS and **their chinese backers**
---
Yet you use reddit?
---
lol good point

Hey kid people work for their money then spend it on products, if a product is horrible, concerns need to be voiced, no one wants a horrible product. They have given us a horrible product.
---
To protect the brand. Now when people search for Fallout First this will be the first page.
---
Fair, I enjoy the silly thing when I find them...  (Often wandering around without a camp to return to)..  
---
Keep an eye on the levels and let me know, always appreciate more information as Bethesda isn't running out and clarifying things for us
---
Because greed is not a motivating factor for me. I wouldn't fit in.
---
Your shift/capslock key appears to be broken mate, you should see to that ASAP. :O
---
&gt; You are missing the point that a lot of this should have been part of the game to start with. 
---
[Citation Needed].
---
That's your opinion. You don't get to dictate what "should have been part of the game to start with" anymore than I get to dictate that I should get a blowjob included with buying Outer Worlds.
---
Well announcing with only half or quarter of a fanfare is kind of lame.
---
I believe this was settle back in 2008 when blizzard won a lawsuit against them over the lack of advertised hero classes and other minor things that were advertised in the manual and in adverts. So if blizzard won with obvious I am sure this would be a cake walk for Bethesda to walk away from clean as it was announced at a trade show and prior to the games release whereas things can change in development. I am also damn sure somewhere in the ToS or EULA states that they can change shit as much as they want.
---
Good maybe it'd be worth the 12 bucks a month then.
---
If there are more people complaining then people who actually play the game, doesn't that point to some sort of astroturfing campaign trying to make it seem like this is a grass roots backlash?
---
....I honestly cannot believe people actually bought this.
---
I know it’s real, but I just can’t believe it....
---
 That would be very difficult. I just slotted a new set of the Winged Sevtlana 6550Cs into my monoblocks and holy fuck are they nice. ;)
---
Game companies have done just fine without all of these tactics in the past.  Now they are just doing better, and each release from this game and across the industry gets worse and worse. It isn't enough to be a commercial success,  too get lots of money,  the goal has turned into getting ALL the money.  That's where I see the problem.
---
Bethesda:  I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
---
It was a good question.  
---
Just tired and a little salty, have a habit of rambling when I am, and can't disagree, but wish I could.
---
I really wish we could keep one post like this at the top so we could exchange opinions in a civil manner. Problem is there's people on both sides making new posts every 5 seconds (me included) and it gets buried. We just try to keep up I guess.
---
If they get like a special legendary sure but its just junk storage
---
Wish I could upvote you more.  Unfortunately this will continue until the next outrage people can latch on to.  Boredom is a dangerous weapon.    
---
Private servers is the only thing you could argue is content that is now paid, but again, that would be an argument or discussion.  People complaining, are generally people who have no interest in playing this game regardless, and just want to shit on everything going on with, exactly this, changing things to fit their narrative.  
---
Luckily they will get bored of this too.  While I am not so diluted to think everyone currently playing likes this, I am willing to bet there is a large population of folks more than happy to shell out the sub for all it gives them.
---
I'll buy the next elder scrolls or fallout game once it's in the $5 bin, or not at all.
---
Gotta agree with big... that is some stupid whale logic you got there... tis like saying you can't say being on fire sucks unless you lit yourself up for a while... its obvious that this trash fire would be bad but you keep shoveling in dollars thinking oh it will get better... news flash it never will!

I'm a software developer. I care a lot about user feedback. Yes, I get paid regardless, but it's satisfying knowing that your work is improving people's lives in some way. It's not usually the devs saying "lol fuck the users".

---
Thank God I own a switch is one of the dumbest statements ever. Nintendo is one of the worst companies. Right there with ea and Activision. Bethesda has screwed up one game. Nintendo are lazy craps who don't care about players at all either
---
Atoms were already massively overpriced anyway and have no value. That's why people arent factoring it in.
---
If you are already throwing good money at bad atoms then it seems like a bargain. But if you just wanted a private server it's a bad deal.
---
If like me you just wanted the content everyone has been asking for and and it's now behind a pay wall its a terrible deal.
---
Falloutfirst.com didn’t get taken down, it just got hugged to death. It’s back up at this moment. 
---
I’m not defending Bethesda’s recent decisions here, just clearing up misconceptions.
---
I would be fine if they did private severs like Battlefield does in my opinion.
---
It might have been said in the meeting... your not following the spirit an topic of this section of the post
---
Probably exist already, Tbh I dont think people are salty just annoyed about them putting certain requested features behind a ridiculous paywall
---
have you jumped lobbies recently? i've noticed the odds are pretty high that i just end up right back in the same lobby when i jump lobbies. that probably means something. and i don't think criticism or being shocked by shady business models in gaming is 'begging' boycott. I think you're taking this all personally if that's what see criticism as.
---
I’m fine with a subscription service in theory, but I think that the current price is kind of ludicrous for the amount of content you get. In terms of atoms it does seem like a good deal, but everything else? It just doesn’t seem worth it, especially since new content won’t be arriving until next year (and the delay isn’t a bad thing in and of itself, just something that makes me less inclined to buy the subscription at the moment). I don’t want to pay $17.99 CAD every month just to get some small gameplay improvements and cosmetics for a game that I’ve already bought at full price. 
---
This also frustrates me because this move is awful for PR. Fallout 76 has been steadily improving in terms of quality and the scandals had all but stopped, and that was starting to draw in a new audience - myself included. I avoided the game at launch but bought it a month or so ago after hearing that it had improved, and while it still isn’t the mainline Fallout game I wanted, I do think that it’s fun for what it is and far better than I was led to believe. But this move has made Bethesda look greedy and money-hungry, and that will definitely hurt the renewed interest in the game.
---
Seems like it'd be easy to implement a code trigger to go "player logging in to server, if private=true, reset to default state" or something like that.
---
We're quite aware of your lack of class, lack of cents, lack of sense, etc.
---
I don’t think any of this is actually content tbh
---
Cant feel bad for anybody stupid enough to pay for the subscription... and not surprised it buggy...
---
The problem with Instances is a simple one tho F76 server spins up a new instance when the current active ones are full and then every so often does a pass on the instances and moves people on almost empty instances to another instance if there is room and if there is any empty instances it closes them its called load balancing, it sounds like whats happening is when an F1st player clicks private world the server checks to see if there is an empty instance running and if one is running drops you into it and if there a no instances running it creates one.
---
Which looks like it was the best idea ever as the ship burns down around them . . .
---
 Not really. Its a game server, the database has the
---
 persistence.  
---
 I have run game servers. None of them was persistent outside of the session. Now I have only run Deathmatch servers. I'm not aware of RPG servers one can run, not that I'm about to. ;)
---
Aw my bad I do skip through alot
---
Oh I agree. I think the way it has been executed is the best possible way it could have been done, and the most balanced way to do it. I would have been upset if it had included ways to modify loot tables/spawn rates etc. THAT would have been pay to win.
---

On average there is a little over 6 milligrams (mg) of NaCl dissolved in each millilitre (ml) of lacrimal fluid (tear fluid), i.e. a concentration of 6 mg/ml. One millilitre of water yields approximately 20 drops, and so there should be about 0.3 mg of salt in each teardrop.
---
I got downvoted and attacked just for saying I'd consider paying the sub for a month when Wastelanders drops next year. Not even paid any money or made a definite decision yet but apparently I'm supporting shitty business practices and I'm everything that's wrong with gaming. Go figure.
---
They really screwed up after the goodwill they earned back with Wild Appalachia.  They finished up their roadmap for that particular season and then went silent about the upcoming Nuclear Winter and a Wastelanders tease which they finally unveiled during E3.  We got the NW battle royal and little else aside from meat week during the rest of summer until the Vault Raids opened up in mid August (?). Then nothing again until we were told last week Wastlelanders was being delayed.  Now the paid subscription........I just don't understand how they justify a subscription when there is very little endgame content and the world isn't persistent.  Who exactly are they targeting with this aside from the whales??
---
why has everyone in every post defend himself? there like 20 posts now about this bug.
---
it happened. to me. and to others. and no one deserved it like you read here sometimes.
---
Okay don’t get me wrong... but how else do we expect gaming companies to subsidize their product so that we can pay $60 at launch still? I bought halo2 fifteen years ago for the same price as almost every game now. None of the things you have to pay for are required to enjoy the game, they’re extra things to make the game even better. 
---
I’ve got huge problems with the way many developers have put core components of games behind BS paywalls and have made micro transactions just like gambling. But I just think, I’ve had a great time with this game and nothing they’re offering behind the paywall is necessary for me to keep enjoying it.
---
I agree to an extent. Programmers can go work for banks, vending machine companies, medical companies - everyone has programmers now.
---
The ones who get into gaming do it because they love games, and they want to be  seen as 'rock stars' to their clients. You dont get drowned in praise writing code for Jackson-Hewitt, but you sure do when you work on video games. Thousands cheer for you at conventions.
---
For the people slinging ones and zeroes at video game companies, days like yesterday are pretty demoralizing.
---
Well maybe they should stop being complete cucks, whose decisions keep Bethesda fucking us?
---
Stop paying for this bullshit.
---
Compared to ESO and Ark yeah I guess FO76 is the least decomposed of the corpses
---
But I can't say I've ever met a person who could say with a straight face that 76 is their absolute favorite game
---
You won't be missed.
---
Cept when the players are paying for the hated games encouraging more hated games... paying for trashfires means you get more trashfires
---
The music is the best part.  
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
Looking at my friend list last night, about half the active ppl bought the sub.
---
But i and my buds are older as in out of college with jobs and a passion for fallout. It makes sense about half would pay for this as it is less than a movie ticket a month, so with that mindset it is still a good value for entertainment over most other options.
---
Tldr-lots bought sub, lots of revenue, lots of happy bethesda ppl.
---
thank you!
---
we need to send a strong message to Bethesda!
---
Ways to lose friends and alienate yourself by op.
---
You work for the Washington post?  Their article did exactly what it was Intented to do.  Lure you into pasting it around the internet despite the fact that you, nor nobody writing the article even actually care about fallout 76 or have any interest in playing it, regardless of the subscription.  So, while, I guess, complaining about this companies supposed predatory monetization efforts, you are willingly participating in the Washington posts'.
---
Is it available now? 
---
I love Fallout 76 but Fallout 1st is a fucking screw job and I’m not a whore. 
---
I would like a new game to play that won’t treat me as a faceless revenue stream.
---
You will get fucked and you will like it.
---
No, because then you know it’s sarcastic before you read it.  Or, do they add it at the end?  I am not an experienced redditor lol
---
bc i been playing till yesterday, i was hoping for Waslander to make this game decent, and them they delay it and release this bullshit and even worst, no other content to do till next DLC.
---
The game is bored and they want to charge me with a sub. -----fuck them ------
---
&gt;Bethesda knows how to make me pay with infinite storage of junk. 
---
Though apparently even THAT is bugged out of the gate, with players reporting that their scrap box is just eating everything they put in it.
---
Yeah but if you like open world games, you like open world games.
---
I haven't played a game that's not open world since tomb Raider on ps1.....just literally can't do it anymore, not since playing fallout 3 and NV.
---
All good, I do the same every so often. After 8 scorchbeast queen fights where loot didn't drop in a row after spending 600+ 10mm bullets I rage quit and played a few games on xbox game pass. Side note I miss settlement system from Fallout 4, foundation requirements suck.
---
I literally explained it in my first post

You are aware that women use reddit, too?

Credited you on the [PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmk5lz/psa_forest_scout_armor_needs_a_new_paint_applied/) I just tossed up, as I'm sure a few people will notice that issue.

I know. I'm just saying that by comparison, if TOW is mediocre, that makes FO76 the worst game in existence
---
I'd eat my hat if any of this post is true
---
it happened to me, too. like a lot of others. its definitly a bug.
---
Um what? 😂
---
Well, that was lazy of them. At first I thought that a private server would be kinda like an offline Fallout 76, more like 4 worked. But nope
---
What would be one step too far for you? Have you thought about drawing a line in the sand for yourself? I think you should, consumers absolutely should have certain expectations of vendors they do business with, so what are yours,  out of curiosity?
---
This is sorta the problem with Private Worlds and the scrap box in general. Now with Private Worlds I could feasibly get a server mostly to myself, take all the Workshops, loot the hell out of everything and then go ham on a public server. 
---
So even it's not _easily_ exploitable now, the whole thing is a sort of an approved exploit for people that pay money. How is being able to get a fresh instance over and over any worse than _sometimes_ getting a not-fresh instance? You have to wait a bit to have exclusive access to the whole world? Not really much of a detriment.
---
I'm not taking this personally but I do keep pointing out how disingenuous all of these posts feel. It seems that people are making throwaways to try and add onto the controversy. Remember, some people make money from outrage and benefit from stoking it
---
I dont get the point of a post claiming to not know the point.  
---
This post is useless.  Noone cares about what you think about what other people think about. 
---
I dont get the point of these stupid replies.
---
I got the E3 atom bundle and thats it
---
They've made the game better, unfortunately they've charged for it.
---
Take the pay wall away and the game is better.... You're mad at the pay wall not the fact they've added things to make the game better.
---
OP: Doesn't want to support predatory business practices
---
Also Op: Only cares if they can use their friends to make money
---
That's the thing though, if you know you've shit the bed and you aren't likely to make much more profit off it, why not open it up to modding and private servers? Not like they have anything to lose. 
---
At the very least they could make money off the private server rental. I dunno, unless they have some insane data we aren't privy too, I can't see how they could be making *that* much off whales at this point.
---
Idk maybe the server won’t be missed but character mods if some sort. Weapons and stuff. It’s really just sad. It’s not only false advertisement but it also goes back on a promise they made before the game launched. They said private servers would be coming after launch. “Servers”. And they never mentioned anything about a price tag coming with it.
---
I also speak about the good they do. I am just honest about their business practices. My boss finds it refreshing because he gets its all bullshit. Its a good kife
---
Thank you. I didn’t realise they put them on there, thought you had to go there to work it out.
---
Bugthesda be like  “I used to *think my life was a tragedy*. But *now I realize*, *it's a comedy*.”
---
Huh, that's not the case on my Twitter feed. 
---
Would that be the same moronic critics and youboobers that have been harping on the game since launch? They have almost as much credibility as some rando on Reddit.
---
Well yeah, this is Bethesda we're talking about. I expect no less from them.
---
Now you are just being ridiculous 😂
---
Obviously time and new information can give one a different perspective.
---
The one where you can still play the game you paid for, you're getting the promised DLC, and private servers cost $.
---
Thinking private hosting would be free and on your own PC was delusional.
---
Christ, you guys are such entitled brats.
---
No one was there.  My only other friend on the server was wandering the nuke zone and saw the same thing.
---
Its mechanical storage defender and redirector thankyou
---
Making a decent product in the fucking first place??? A game that is decent enough to not sell like shit and be severely discounted? The in-game store that they *already* have?
---
Maybe they're trying to make their next games look like amazing miracles in comparison.
---

Everyone hit him with feathery lashes, this guy loves it.

I guess all the 'great news' yesterday was our *Inside the Vault* too. I eagerly checked their page today to see if they had **anything** to say about the backlash, but nope, radio silence.

Pretty par for the course.
---
I'm seriously doubting that I'll be buying Elder Scrolls 6.
---
Shut up and buy it, sheep.
---
I have a theory, they are intentionally bombing right now and being shit bags so that when they release their next big title (elder scrolls or single player fallout or a new title) it will seem dope as hell and like they are good guys again to get a ton of praise and sales when itll just be an average game
---
100%
---
He means this.
---
&gt; **Stop reporting that the Scrap box delete your items.** 
---
Why? The scrap box is deleting people's items. I don't think you know what scrap is.
---
It really isnt that big of an upgrade since if you can place your tent, you can fast travel to base, break it down, and fast travel back. At first I didn’t give the tent much thought, after playing with it, it is far superior from what I first thought.
---
Outer worlds is trash tho.
---
Forbes also posts WWE rumors and results so yeah duh they know the best.
---
Welp.
---
Homeless guy would obviously appreciate it more lmao
---
Pete Hines is a hardcore liar -
---
Point taken, didn't think of that.
---
I mean... 3k atom points would be pretty cool.
---
The sub fee affects you in exactly zero ways if you were already playing the game before it dropped.
---
Dude, let's be honest. If this is your mentality, then even if it did go half-off a week after you bought it at launch, you'd just go "well, dang it", keep playing, and throw more of your money at them.
---
I shudder to think how many clients like you keep the game companies that exercise these unethical and horrible business practices afloat.
---
No lol. Fuck em all. In the words of the Joker. "You get what you fucking deserve." I am glad they are suffering.
---
That said, no death threats, or sharing of personal info. 
---
Someone just to spite me sent me their receipt for 6 years of fallout1st . I decided to cancel it for them as a rebuttal. They are not all victims.
---
There are still idiots arguing that it would take SO MUCH SERVER SPACE to have an unlimited stash.
---
It's so infuriating.
---
What proof do you have that the money isn’t being used for 76 development?
---
At this point I really do feel like they're trying to make fools of us. I adore this game and I would love to play a perfectly stable version of it, but not for an ongoing monthly fee! What a slap in the chops. I am just so disappointed.
---
You seem very angry.
---
Who hurt you?
---
No it isn't. They started using HERO Engine early on but later switched to a custom one.
---
Free for the first month when no one signs up.
---
Is outer worlds out?
---
Yes. You are right. It is not successful from costumer point of view. We are not happy about all those changes. 
---
I thought Todd said something like "Skyrim and fallout 4 are still very popular and very successful games but there is little room for bethesda to put monetization in those games. They want to change this model of single player offline games because they want to implemented more posibilities for microtransaction. They want to have more control over their product." 
---
I hope this idea will backfire and we will get single player offline  games from now on.
---
Yeah, that would be nice
---
Go back to the Donald jackass
---
All you need to do is block them from session
---
It doesn't work that way. 
---
Even if you never spend a dime, if someone sees what you have have and experiences FOMO, they will want it and may be willing to spend money to get there.  You don't have to spend a dime to create this effect - you simply need to play the game.  
---
Which is why buying the game in the first place causes part of the problem.
---
Been watching it on Twitch and it seems a bit fetch questy so far so I am not sure about it.
---
Anyone who paid into this deserves what they get.
---
I think at some point the devs are questioning the decision makers at the studio.
---
I'd definitely pay for this.
---
Why do people say cucks. I'm on your side but i downvoted you because it just makes you sound like a chump.
---
You do you. But nope.
---
Since launch they have constantly failed to deliver. If you still, almost, a year after keep being naive and fall for their hyped and empty promises. Then yes there will ofcourse be people who find that amusing.
---
Oh wow Forbes🤭. It might has well been God that said it😂😂😂😂 smh.
---
If you have to beg for people to boycott the game then it kinda shows you know you're in the minority. Take heart in the fact that you uninstalled and don't have to worry about it anymore. People will do the same if they feel similarly, the chips will fall where they will
---
It's literally in it's name. It scraps whatever you put inside.
---
I’d like to read the full thing could you dm me it?
---
*takes another Nuka Dark shot*
---
*winces*
---
Not that kinda bot
---
This just in: Different people think different things but only those that agree with me are correct.
---
More at 11.
---
You Bethesda shills fucking deserve it.
---
I didn't even buy this piece of shit, only here for the giggles!
---
Not sure if you've seen a lot of the gameplay and dialogue systems, but it's a whole lot closer to fallout than Mass Effect. You simply can't walk your way to every area of the game akin to fallout.
---
Lol ok
---
Nobody claimed your being unfairly apologetic, Just that you condemn NV yet 76 had more time and it was a buggy piece of shit, Every fallout had bugs ofcoarse but 76 surpasses it by alot
---
No its not. I'm no millionaire lol. Just middle range area. Fuck walmart :)
---
Me too, I'm not even bothered about NW, 1st or the Atom store, I see the advertising when I log in then just carry on as I always have.
---
That’s just the speedy benefit of Drive-Thru Litigation. Sue someone and get a verdict in four hours or less!
---
Both Bethesda and the cucks who keep giving them money, Get yeeted on you big nerds.
---
I saw a level 10 messing around with a level 3 today
---
You do realize a majority of the player base doesn’t read this sub or even partake in Reddit. A majority of their player base won’t quit or subscribe.  They will play the game as they have exactly the same way.  I think as a community we forget we are a vocal minority(either pro or con FO:1st) and no way represent as a whole what the player base wants.
---
false
---
I am just saying every company is corrupt, money is the end goal. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean everyone is going to follow suit. People are going to still support it. 
---
Yay Bethesda and Blizzard!
---
LOL, 2nded
---
Welp. Bethesda has made this decision pretty easy, now.
---
True, but you gotta admit that it is sometimes a bit annoying when your weapon breaks while fighting a powerful enemy or pvp. Plus weapon conditions on the HUD would be a bit of nostalgia for 3/NV players
---
What I find extra funny about this post is that it skirts *so* close to being self-aware:
---
"Thanks for complaining, there's actually a playerbase now because of all the attention."
---
So, you admit the game was pretty much dead a week ago?
---
I really don't understand the cultish support some people insist on offering to a huge company that does not give a tenth of a fuck about them.
---
Your confirmation bias is leading you astray. When I see some kind of analytics, beyond who can yell and scream the loudest, then I'll correct my opinion.
---
Yeah that makes sense then.  So you just do it like /s at the end of the post?  I will see if I can modify my original post.
---
They call them Private World's, so it's all good. I'm very happy with my subscription, it's great!
---
Biiiit of a stretch with that false equivalency you lobbed up there..
---
Who said it was DIY? 
---
Which reminds me thank your mother for me
---
Fallout 4 was filled with bugs and glitches on release, it was single player so you didn't have other players getting pissed off about it as much, with 76 being an mmo people are more competitive and don't like feeling like a bug put them behind the ball (much less PTW). Also fallout 4 had the help of the community of modders who made the Fallout 4 official Patch that fixed a lot of shit Bethesda wouldn't.
---
Right? Things you haven't seen in a while are happening again.
---
I honestly feel like they couldn't figure out how to fit four options on the log in screen so one had to go.
---
They played y'all like a damn fiddle!
---
&gt;First, I understand that private serves had to be paid for
---
Not at all. 24/7 servers have to be paid for, the servers Fallout 1st users have access to could have been implemented at no cost at all, similar to how Ark: Survival Evolved lets you run non-24/7 servers for absolutely no cost. There is not a single difference between local servers (Which YOU are running, so it costs nothing) and the servers people are paying for.
---
&gt;turning point for this awesome community, one way, the other or all of them at the same time.
---
There's nothing good that will come of this situation. The only reason the premium subscription released was for the simple reason: The Outer World's was on track to outpace the sales of 76 by humongous margins.
---
If everyone is still here raging at how bad this update was, they're not sat posting about how they can't wait for The Outer Worlds, literally just hoping people forget to buy the game by taking the limelight for themselves. It being bad limelite means nothing to them, they added a way for people to give them more money.
---
Edit: You could argue that the ATOM price alone makes it "a worthwhile purchase" because it's much cheaper than their other methods of predatory microtransactions, and it would be a stupid argument.
---
I've bought around 75% of the games Bethesda has released but, after this, they can go fuck themselves.
---
I will never buy another Bethesda game from now on. There are too many other companies that have much better  morals than them, and that actually care about their fans.
---
And yep, on board for Outer Worlds. Can't wait to get started.
---
the new meme is whatever updates and features are coming down the road
---
will be fallout first only
---
Question: why do we want items from games that are set such a long time after the game we’re playing. It’s totally immersion breaking, like roger max sons outfit, the cryolater. And the big cannon gun from USS constitution. I’d prefer Bethesda made new outfits that are cool, without disrupting the lore so much.
---
Gets better, there's more versions of it and I bet now they only gave one of them  when you subscribe
---
I think the real problem with persistence at this point is they would have to rewrite a lot of code because they didn't build for persistence in the first place. For example, CAMPs are currently bound to the player data, which is how you're able to carry them with you from one instance to the other, but if they were to persist, they'd need to be stored on the server with the map data instead. This isn't insurmountable, but if they didn't make these changes to release alongside private instances, I'm skeptical that they're going to.
---
I fucking lost it at the sex tent oh my god
---
You raised your own expectations.  How many companies in this day and age let you host their online multiplayer games on your own or on third party servers?  Private servers were ALWAYS  going to be dependent on Bethesda's hardware which would mean the only mods that will eventually be available will be the ones they greenlight for the service.
---
This isn't skyrim where you can just open up the creation kit and throw together anything you want to modify the game in any way your imagination sees fit and then cram your game full of as many mods as possible until they you hit the breaking point...
---
No. They use server virtualization, and they don't actually host their own server farms, they lease them from Amazon, so server space is a non-issue.
---
It’s because they have no respect for any of us - were are all faceless cash generators to them. Give people shit and they eat it. 
---
There will be plenty of dummies that shell out £100 a year for the privilege of being taken advantage of. 
---
They think we are stupid and enough people will pay to prove them right.
---
What did they do? I hope your kittens and puppies will recover, naughty Bethesda!
---
Your fault for being a sucker.
---
Bethesda is no longer a company kf passion.  Skyrim and fallout were games of passion.  You could tell they were crafted with love and with people who wanted the gamers to like it.  Even fallout 4 had those elements.  Bethesda is now a corporate giant.  They look at the numbers and they make decisions on the numbers.  That is all.  The passion and artistic motivation is gone
---
If that ranger armor was in the store for 1200 atoms (12 dollars to the US chaps) .... Thousands and thousands would buy it. So just do the first month... Take your 1650 atoms free and the armor and shut the f*#k up.
---
The username checks out. April Fools is coming early lol
---
A documentary with roughly 1.5 million views on Youtube (in over one year) doesn't come close to informing their players. The announcement stream had more viewers than that, E3 had far more, and these games sell 30+ million copies.   
---
Furthermore, the documentary still paints Maryland as the driving force behind the game. Fallout 76 was portrayed as the next game from the same team that brought us Skyrim and Fallout 4, and it wasn't.
---
camp budget higher and that you could build closer to each other.
---
Well this is my line in the sand, unless the state of this service improves within the next month and unless the price drops I’m not spending another dime on the game until they’ve earnt back the trust I have lost for them over the course of this games life cycle
---
Key thing is bad faith. If you buy a domain and do nothing with it but try and peddle it off, then that's clearly bad faith. If you use it to host a service while also trying to sell it off, then that's a lot harder to prove.
---
But also, don't call people morons for not understanding this. Most people don't operate or know how to operate websites, and they don't have any responsibility to.
---
I kept thinking eventually I would play again. But even with all the updates, I haven’t touched the game since week 6 after it’s released. Seeing the posts on this sub has confirmed my feelings that things haven’t got much better.
---
The outrage signalling on this sub has been like a TV soap, quite entertaining.
---
What the hell does this even mean?
---
You honestly deserve it
---
Lmfao just because you don’t use power armor doesn’t mean it’s not science fiction. Just because it’s on Earth doesn’t mean it’s not science fiction, go theow a tantrum somewhere else.
---
 Yup. Its an RPG and the DB is what matters. If its on your machine and mine always were, usually a Linux server as that is usually the best, no matter what OS the game is on, then its on your machine and its up to you what gets saved and not.
---
 Fallout 76 runs on AWS as instances and really it does not matter, as that's all you get, an instance. As the DB has your crap, that's fine. 
---
 The instances are created on the fly as demand requires. They are not in a pool to be reused. Now the main game has servers with many people on them and they are persistent as long as they are occupied. That's why they toss you back in the same one if you try to server hop too quickly.
---
It’s also had a seven year development and still launched in a rocky state
---
This is why I don't give a shit about these live service style games.  The support they claim they're going to give it hinges entirely on its player base both at launch and over the course of time, and plans change.  They can also fuck with the service as they please... if they already have your money then what are you going to do about it?  Nothing.  I'd be upset if I bought this and still played it when they rolled out this subscription.  That's not what I would've fucking paid for.  That wasn't the deal.  So in essence, beyond the initial package at launch, you have no fucking idea what you're even paying for when you get a game like this.
---
I think so yeah! I bet you'll start noticing them everywhere now! HaHa
---
-
---
Now, get back in that kitchen!! /s
---
Hey. If it’s in the game.....it just works
---
Do you have proof that it is?
---
(To the tune of deck the halls) Troll, troll, troll, troll, troll. Troll, Troll, Troll,  TROOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLL!
---
There are about 3 silver containers below the station near were the first chief sets up (the robot that launches all the other chiefs) that I like to jump up on.  They are right in front of the area where the rest of the chiefs go to prepare the launch.  If your facing the targeting scope where you actually launch the nuke the containers are behind you on your right.  
---
If you jump up on top of the containers and face the main area of the room, on your right hand side you can manually aim through a set of shelves at the door you enter through.  For me almost all of the robots enter from this door and if your fast you can kill them right there.  The shelves also help shield you from them so they have to walk around before attacking.
---
I've had it bug out after launching the first chief where the other chiefs will not launch...if it happens you need to let one of the robots destroy the first chief and replace him.  It's only did it once or twice on me when the server was really slow.
---
For the other rooms: 
---
The first area where you get your biometric id is pretty straight forward.  I go in get my biometric scan then find the keycard.  There are usually a couple of cards in the room with the scanner.  If not I've consistently found an id card in the room where you make your id.  
---
In the reactor room I usually enter and make a loop clockwise around the outside to take out all the turrents and bots, shut down the reactor, make a loop counterclockwise to fix the pipes, and restart the reactor.  The room that opens is diagonally across the room from the terminal that  you use to stop and start the reactor.  Sometimes it lags and takes a couple of minutes to open.  You can also lock pick and hack a terminal to by pass the reactor room if you want too.
---
The part where you destroy the mainframe cores is pretty straightforward.  I usually just shoot them with an explosive rifle for convenience.  
---
The part with replacing the mainframe cores is pretty straightforward also.  Before you enter the room with the sentry bot you can lock pick and hack a terminal in the room to your right to turn the turrents on each other.  I usually just shoot the turrents and the robots instead.  Lol remember that sentry bots exploded when they die.......the mainframe cores lag bad so be patient and watch your back for robot spawns.  If you need to repair them, there is a tinker's benches in a room to the right of where you enter.  They are under crafting instead of repairing.  
---
If your on ps4 I can help if you want.  Ill be on in 6ish hours or so.  My psn is the same as here.  Good luck!

Oh yeah its trash despite it being overwhelmingly positively recieved by critics and fans LOL

Will make 'surface to air' and 'its a trap' events more appealing.
---
Stay uninformed. It's a good look for you.
---
best use of spoilers I’ve seen so far, take my silver.
---
Lmao I didn't buy this rip off of a game, because I have a brain. Only an idiot would actually support Bethesda after they blatantly shit out an unfinished, lazy, travesty of a game. But I'm guessing you aren't too bright. And it's not entitlement to want full value out of 60$ dollar game when the released version was a hollow boring game that 99% of gamers hated.
---
Welcome to the club, I'm loving my new armor. I'd of payed a tenner for the armor alone. So the free atoms and the other stuff is a bonus.
---
I just bring it up cuz every new game is dead. Its kinda seems like a hate train.
---
You're a good man.
---
Silver lining . You’re 400l bs less weight and it only cost you 100$ for the year lol
---
All people ever wanted and myself was a Fallout game where you can team up and play Campaign Story together...............Not this multiplayer grind behind a paywall BS
---
can you help me source your information on the sizes of each part of the community and how they stand on this? Because I think we can only make wild guesses right now about whether this is a popular development or not.
---
If only there were a forum full of fans of the game where we could read the newest content and see what their thoughts are.
---
Im fucking tired of games as a service, this is always what it leads to.
---
&gt; The only thing that ever happens in here is HATE.  
---
&gt; Who cares!? More bugs, please!!! 
---
It's hilarious how half of your posts here are hate about bugs but you're sick of hate. I don't understand.
---
When they make a non-predatory game without lying about its content they wont get hate.
---
Total number yes. But total income, I doubt it.
---
First they lie to you, then they f*** you and then they ask for more money. And yet somehow people are defending Bethesda's decisions... Wow, really?
---
*insert generic insult*
---
Pirate any Bethesda games you want
---
I'd like a private persistent server that I can mod and have complete control over. A server that my friends and I could co-op build on. That's what I was hoping for. But no.....
---
No punishment here. Got to lvl 120 and I had fun. Waiting for more stuff to come out.
---
The single biggest legitimate complaint I could think of in all of this is that I would expect over time that Private Worlds will mostly kill off Adventure Mode and make it harder to find groups. That's probably OK, given how badly everyone wanted private servers from the beginning, but that to me would be a serious, legitimate complaint about how Fallout First affects gameplay (if that were to happen). But that's all speculating way down the line. Right now, it hasn't changed a thing.
---
And you just know they're going to hook their private servers up to Bethesda.net's mod platform, and enable modders to charge for mods (with Bethesda taking a generous % of the revenue every transaction). With total control of the hardware and the software, they can finally turn their vibrant modding community into a shitty walled garden Apple app store they can profit off of, control, and censor, like theys always wanted, ever since trying paid Skyrim mods on Steam Workshop.
---
Bethesda got you to actually pay for this. They don't care what happens to you next. They know they'll get you to pay for the fix for this.
---
LOL :D
---
What does any expect from companies that only care about getting your money? Money is the all time bottom line. And people lie all the time to get it.
---
They way I see it, if you bought this crap then you get what you deserve and have no right to bitch about it
---
It's mine and my boyfriends favorite. It has everything we love in a video game. I can't say the same for the other few people in my group. But from the day it was announced and everything they announced with it, I was thrilled and I enjoy it. (and I've never spent any money on it.) We've played a TON of games on PC, DS, Xbox and mobile for almost 10 years together (it's the base of our relationship lol) and Fallout 76 is the only game that marks off all the checks on both of our lists of what we want in a game.
---
de nada
---
Dont attack me, its better for you. I promise
---
The game has only gotten worse by featuring them and I am not going to believe what Bethesda says when all they do is lie. Bethesda has enough money to sustain this game without microtransactions, they just want money. Quit defending the game and if you just don’t mind that they added this BS subscription, then why don’t you just go play the game?
---
On Xbox turn region to new Zealand :)
---
If you have game pass. It's almost outfallouts fallout.
---
I bought a year subscription because of all the hate on Reddit right now, anything this loathed by outrage culture has to be awesome. I wasn’t wrong.
---
Wonder how long till this guy has a GoFundMe for getting sued by Bethesda.
---
Lost interest half way through the first line of the first of your many paragraphs. Because I know you're just doing everything you can to slate the game I love..... Go play outer worlds.
---
"People who disagree with me have mental problems." 
---
-imPVA, 2019
---
After all that happened with this game people still bought a subscription for the game they probably pre-ordered for 60$
---
Man I wish I had posted about this yesterday. I 100% predicted the scrap box thing. Honestly though is anyone surprised?
---
It's not loot boxes they are telling you what you get it's a shitty thing they are doing yes but tf his is far from gambling more like a used up developer that fell out of their prime time hustling every one to fund their other games
---
Hilarious
---
The only way any of that is possible is by limiting the world to 8 players.
---
But he’s right. The game was dead a week ago and now there’s an uproar. 
---
Any press is good press, and if this fiasco gets even one person to buy the game for the first time just to see WTF all the fuss is, then Beth is even more savvy than we thought.
---
1650 atoms, and that sick ranger armor for a tenner? The first month is literally a no brainer.
---
Combined with the shadiness of their paid mods fiasco and their creeping Creation Club menace, yes it does. I love FO and ES, I'm really interested in Starfield, but if I get the slightest indication its going to have even 10% the nonsense 76 has in it I'm done with Bethesda. My company banlist has been growing a lot lately.
---
Considering Bethesda can’t even be bothered to register their own domain: https://web.archive.org/web/20191024101229/http://falloutfirst.com/
---
This doesn’t surprise me in the least, fuckin rip dude
---
What are you talking about people were shitting thier pants in anger about how bethesda betrayed the community. Im gonna uninstall, im quitting, fuck bethesda is all they said for a week. Were you not on that week or are you making it up.
---
Lmao you insult me and then get butthurt when I respond. Grow up man.
---
If they needed money they should have made TES:VI and TES VII by now. I get that with modding, you can (and should) give games room to breathe and let them live for a few years before replacing them, but come on. it's going to have been over a decade between Skyrim (one of the most successful games ever at the time. Maybe the most? I don't remember) and its sequel. What. The. Fuck?
---
If I were on that board, I'd be beating people over the head with a board. **Literally** burning money.
---
This aged really well.
---
Why???
---
I'm playing it right now, it's great.
---
Wastelanders will be filled with "new features" designed to frustrate players and encourage them to pay to skip the grind with Atom Shop purchases, garbage Bugthesda is like Vault Tec itself doing experiment on how much shit they can get away with.
---
I’m waiting to see if they knock it down to a single digit number, I want to be mad but I want the Ranger armor.
---
I’m a big ol’ whale in a big blue ocean baby!
---
My wife and I picked it up too! The dances are ALMOST worth the 12.99$ alone, haha. Protectron Shuffle is my jam.
---
You’re mentioning lies but haven’t shown proof for a bold statement that none of the money is going towards development. So I’ll ask again. What proof do you have that the money isn’t going towards development of 76?
---
I as most people would love to see new content or events.  However, I feel the game developers have more than satisfied my 60 dollar commitment for the entertainment value.  I have nothing to complain about as far as their subscription base system.
---
First time i got lost lol,took me 90 minutes!now i do it in 25 minutes.take it slow,no hurry and if u can perk wise take all 3 hacker and all 3 picklock on.take the short cut explained by someone below and hack the terminals to deactivate the turrets,thats so much easyer.goodluck!
---
&gt; lose the mindset that it’s.....pay once and done
---
Tell that to CD Projekt Red! The monetization of Fallout has very little to do with funding content updates and everything to do with subsidizing the losses Bethesda suffered due to poor sales and terrible decisions.
---
It wasn't loading for me and saw a few comments saying it was down, must be a surge in traffic.
---
A lot of people don’t like the game because they feel Bethesda promised so much and delivered so little. Fallout 1st was the final nail in the coffin for most. Hey I’m glad you like the game but was it ever worth it’s original price? The subscription is also definitely not worth it. Cry and blame Reddit all you want but the blame lies squarely with Bethesda’s awful, bizarre and out of touch decision making.
---
Too much money.
---
That's a joke
---
You the only idiot, let people do with their money what they want .. grow up ..
---
Bloodied Chinese Officer's Sword with faster swing speed.

Because you are talking about submitting a claim of wrongdoing to the FTC.... If you can’t show you were harmed, you have no cause for action...

---
Plus some cool dance emotes!!
---
The OP was already sarcasm. Way to ride the coattails...
---
I don't have any proof. Nobody here has any. 
---
We all have this kind of strange feeling that Bethesda can't or wont pay for testing every patch before releasing it. Some of the old bugs and glitches are back after patch 14. I'm sure that one of the old dupping methods is possible again. My fallout friends are bragging about it all day long.
---
In GTA:O you can join a private server or invite only server without paying. What kind of shit is this?
---
 K bye
---
Don't you get 1650 Atoms every month, doesn't the service essentially pay for itself if you buy atoms regularly ?
---
It's the principle................They purposely made a half ass game to then sell DLC at a later date....Plus it doesn't help the game was filled with Bugs like another Bethesda game...
---
I'm a pre-order idiot and i might play for another 20 minutes if I get a free private server for being a pre-order idiot
---
yeah 300/100 optical fiber is really ultra shitty cheap connection but not definetly cost 30-50usd even 500/100 wont cost that much...
---
Could you have a "quick look" at the scout mask? Is it still only available in the 5 events with a 0.01% Chance?
---
He didn’t lie. This is a subscription with additional content. Now if they stop making any new content for free then they will have lied. I am sure this is how they are rationalizing this. I for one will never give them another bottle cap.
---
Nintendo isn't a great company but they make quality games. Bethesda isn't a great company and doesn't even comprehend the concept of quality.
---
If you have taken OPs message to heart and want to give up your money to remove that temptation. You can always donate to my Patreon.
---
"hey, this predatory microtransaction costs much less than their other predatory microtransactions"
---
I cannot see anyone who comments what you have as being of age to have gone to school yet.
---
Fake currency that means nothing and ranger armour you can get for free with mods in Fallout 4.
---
Remember when a tenner got you OLD WORLD BLUES?
---
Thanks for destroying Fallout.
---
Not a valid reply. Don’t cover for a lie.
---
Well atleas't don't bark my way as i stopped paying for this game months ago.
---
They are selling solutions to inconvenience made by design. It's bad for the end user all day long. If you can only pay for a thing that makes the game easier, it's bad design and balance. You should never create a have have-not situation. And they did just that with the scrap box and survival tent. 
---
It looks bad cause it is. People should get equal opportunity to make their own experience better through either a pay mechanic or naturally through in-game progression. 
---
They just pay-walled it to everyone and called it a day. 
---
Never mind the server BS.
---
They are renting 1/3 of a server to you for over full price in what they are charged. Beth.net uses the cheapest AWS servers they can get away with. Now they are carving up the room cap to make people pay for the "opportunity" to play a private game. You can't mod it, you can't control the content, you just rent a slab of what they have already given you. 
---
Games as a service is supposed to live and die off content, not pay as you go "features" added to stop the bleeding of a poorly designed game from tanking.
---
Also the scrap box is eating people's scrap and the private world's currently are not private at all. 
---
And when Wastelanders hits it'll be a buggy mess, and then paid mods will creep into the "feature" rich subscription."
---
It's quite hard to avoid the comparison because both companies make similar games. As Obsidian seems to be rising to new heights, Bethesda is sinking to new lows. Whilst it is a bit of dick move to hope that Outer Worlds does well just to spite Fallout 76 rather than hoping that it succeeds on its own merits, I think it's entirely fair to make comparisons between them and their respective developers.
---
&gt; As the DB has your crap, that's fine.
---
That's the problem though: it doesn't. If I put some stuff in a chest on a Minecraft server that I'm renting and log off, then I expect those items to still be there when I log back on, unless someone else on the server stole them in the meantime. Whether my "server" is technically a dedicated server or a VPS or an AWS instance doesn't matter, as long as it behaves the way I'd expect. FO76's "private servers" don't persist anything that happens on your server past when you end your session, so it's not really *your* server -- you're just borrowing it for a few hours. You keep your inventory and so forth, because it's bound to your player data, but anything you did in that instance gets wiped when you leave.
---
My mistake, its not fully open world. But Hub worlds/open areas are more than close enough to compare the two.
---
Its not like its a linear hallway shooter were exploration isn't an option right?
---
Hot pro tip
---
Pirate them. You won't have to wait as long or pay as much.
---
You have no 'admin' powers on a private server, so if a friend joins you (which the game allows), they have to either share it with you, or log out.
---
When they log back in, you can just keep joining them.
---

---
Not really. It's entirely subjective. 76 isn't a bad game it just has bad practices and whoever is running the marketing side of things on the game is totally screwing everyone over.
---
Even though Todd Howard isn't involved in 76 his reputation is being tarnished because the fucking 76 team can't go a week without a controversy. And uneducated people see Todd Howard as the face of all things fallout and elder scrolls so this must be his fault etc.
---
Bethesda needs to get rid of whichever dumbass is making all these decisions
---
You're right Bethesda did make a good game. It was called Morrowind.
---
Pro-tip: once they release survival mods farm any trolls that hop to your server for caps.
---
It’s actually just infinite Junk not stash.  I’m sure the stash will be raised for next expansion.
---
guess you’ll have to skip lunch one day this week
---
Sorry, but people have a right to their opinions and a right to be upset. Many paid full price for this game. Just because you find Bethesda's horrid business model suitable for you doesn't mean others should stay quiet about it. The company flat out, 100% lied to its customers. Anyone who denies that is just completely wrong and in denial. If you keep taking out loans with the bank that ups its interest rates by 20% when they promised not to, other banks start to eye that up and think "I'm going to get in on that." and you hurt everyone.
---
You have every right to play and enjoy the game, but zero right to dictate to others that they can't be angry at Bethesda and express that here.
---
What's wrong with the collectron?
---
I would balance the game before trying to milk my customers for all their worth but that's just me
---
At this point I think we can assume it'll probably cost 30-60 bucks, but be free to access for Fallout 1st "members". Also there will likely be exclusives to "members" like special skins, quests, vendors, maybe a faction, and definitely an immortal personal npc companion to carry all your extra stuff.
---
Lol, you know that a quote is something specifically stated right? I’d like for you to find the sentence you’ve quoted anywhere in what I’ve said.
---
ESO is actually fun though, therein lies the difference. I get more joy out of doing my daily crafting in ESO than I get even thinking about logging into 76.
---
It's their job.  
---
Then again, why do you p/l/ay only to be abused by Bethesda?
---
Only my biased feels, and everything else I mentioned that you don’t want to admit.
---
The vast majority of all comments on every social media site is negative. They’re getting ratio’d in likes/dislikes and comments on every YT video or in every official post they make. 
---
You’re arguing based on the feels. Which is why you contradicted yourself, and just cover your eyes and ignore the overwhelmingly negative response on just about every medium on the internet.
---
It's like Bethesda is making fun of people who are stupid enough to pay for this crap.
---
You don't have the game anymore, remember? Also one doesn't "fornicate themselves". That's grammatically incorrect.
---
That’s sick dude!!
---
Because trust is the true foundation of capitalism
---
... I bought the subscription, I’m saying this because I don’t want to be hurt again because I decided it was about time to start trusting bethesda again. I also think some of the outrage of the service is unwarranted and blown out of proportion but a very small minority of it is genuine criticism and pointing out flaws with the service.
---
That's good info, especially given all the hostility lately. Definitely pros and cons.
---
ye let them continue to make the publisher think this is acceptable ;\^) /s
---
Im not angry with you.
---
Im just disappointed.
---
I'm not going to buy this again. I got it for the ranger armor and 1650 atoms. That's a nice deal for me
---
Please re-think calling out the community managers - who are likely facing an enormous pile (above average) of death threats and other violent threats. They are human beings who are indeed paid to do their jobs, but they are still human beings with human limits. They deserve to be treated with basic respect and dignity.
---
Community managers of all games get this sort of abuse daily - imagine how much worse it must be to face an inbox like this first thing in the morning?
---
Go out and vote with your wallet, write real and useful criticism, but please do not target the people who have no say in how the company is run.
---
Anyone that actually believed that an online multiplayer game with the continuous overhead cost of operating servers was going to be a one time purchase with everything else forever after provided for free is completely and utterly ignorant/naive. 
---
I knew this was coming and don’t care. Subscribed to Fallout 1st before I could even log back in to the game. It takes me all of 10 minutes a month to earn the money I was already spending in Atoms. Yes I think that purely cosmetics as paid content would be better but whatever. A dedicated server on demand is well worth the 12$ a month that I was *already spending*.
---
In a world where you can play demos and freemium games, or subscribe to "game pass" and play hundreds of games...we have options that we didn't have available in the past. Games must distinguish themselves from others in order to get someone to buy, pre-purchase, or even play through to the end. Hell, even loyalists will struggle to defend this type of behavior, and eventually they won't defend it; they'll just move on to the next game/platform/universe.
---
I can't make excuses for Fallout anymore. I still love the franchise, but I love it for what it was; not what it currently is. There are too many other good games to play, for less. Not only that, but I cannot justify another preorder for the franchise after this. Before, it was a given. This is the straw that broke my dedication.
---
I don't feel the need to try to convince people to stop playing FO76. Anyone is welcome to play. My opinion doesn't matter in the long run. I just felt the need to voice my personal objection to the current direction, and hope that someone, some day, is willing to make a change. There was not enough Fallout, before getting repeatedly disconnected, to get me to overlook the lack of polish in the game, especially when compared to the quality of many, many other similar games. To then try to milk the community that remains, in this way, is an embarrassment.
---
As you stated, there are too many other good quality games in the market to accept what it happening. I'm hoping Outer Worlds gives me the nostalgia I was hoping to get from FO76.
---
Well, it will either be free, or I will create a brand new XBox account, gift it to my main account, then do a charge back.
---
Quality gaming, let me guess you're console. Quality gaming was ruined years ago by the snuffaluffagus.
---
Very cool, thanks
---
That is what I am saying. It’s not a deal breaker for me. The way people were going on about it, sounded like I was not gonna be able to play the game at all without a subscription!
---
I’m not sticking up for them when I say this but..just don’t buy the extra content if you don’t trust them or their ability to deliver what they claim they can. At the same time, I don’t know if anyone paid attention to E3 but they very clearly said “this is the first time we are doing anything like this so please bear with us.” People are shocked that there are so many bugs when they straight up told people there would be things they have to fix along the way. They have addressed a lot of people’s complaints. I came back to the game after a month and grinded it out a fair bit with friends. It had gotten significantly better from the first time I played it. At least they address people’s complaints. Ever played Ark? You want to talk about shit devs who don’t give a fuck about their playerbase? Let me introduce you to wild card.
---
I agree...... I really do.
---
But they haven't, and you only have to see the way the gaming world is going to realise we're never going to get what we want for free anymore.
---
All the best game developer people will be working for companies making millions AND MILLIONS!! and if you want to employ the best you have to pay the best wages..... Hence the sudden greed from Bethesda.
---
I wanted that armor, I wanted those atoms, a tenner means nothing to me.... Was an easy choice.
---
r/woooosh
---
I have a meeting in 30 minutes.  That's not enough time to tell you all that's wrong with me, so you'll just have to use your imagination.
---
Huge come back. The last 6-12 months of content was very solid and enjoyable and for the most part praised. A lot of old players are returning back and people who have not played for 6 months or two years have returned... And with a massive chunk of the game now "Free2Play" on steam, tons of new PC players dipping their toes in and getting hooked due to the amount of content at this point. With bungo now free of activision, and having just took in some massive revenue, should be a promising year as well.  That said its still bungie and they still have room for improvement.
---
That is kinda why people are quoting him, because it highlights the fact he has essentially lied and the massive disconnect between him (And Bethesda Softworks as a whole), the development team, and us. Which is probably why he hasnt said much since then.
---
Don't listen to the angry kids.  You don't need to pay that subscription to play the game.
---
Well, I did. How do you think this P2W subscription BS is supporting this game?
---
It just works
---
*Checks deep down*...nope I still thinks it’s not great, lots of potential but not great.
---
Screaming and cursing at people will change  nothing. It usually just makes people hang on longer and / or lash back out. 
---
Instead, vote with your own wallet. Don't support BGS. Buy and support other games. Delete the launcher and game from your System. Tell your friends and family to stay away from their games.
---
With enough people doing that, withe BGS will listen or die off.
---
If you are playing FO76 to be some merchant mogul you have in the wrong game since day 1 due to the small population.
---
Nicely stated and I concur!
---
Except for the fact that the junk storage is eating people’s junk apparently.
---
What affected my enjoyment of the game was firing it up day one and seeing all the cool cosmetics for sale in a store. I still remember when I got Chillrend at a lowish level and hanging on to it because it was different. I remember finding a set of power armour that shouted at me. I remember doing a glitch for a missile launcher that was more than likely to kill me than my opponent. Killing a dude because his set of brass knuckles had a unique name. Learning about reverse pickpocketing to get some dudes head wrap and glasses.
---
Cosmetics were a part of Fallout/TES games. The stories behind getting them and then spending many hours meticulously positioning everything in my house I bought. Collecting them because they had a different name or a different colour. I looked forward to going out questing and finding something really rare and unique then meeting with some friends later that day and retelling the story of how I got it. Hearing from a stranger who found a rare item and listening to his tale of where he got it from. Instead, the first person who I bumped into that was dressed uniquely was wearing something straight out of the atom shop. I didn't need to ask him why he looked cool AF while everyone else looked like smurfs, the answer was obvious.
---
Sir. You are right.
---
Very well said.
---
Boycotting their old games makes no sense, especially if you enjoy them. I for one am still gonna play Fallout 3, NV and 4, just not 76
---
I play it on a semi-regular basis with a group of friends (or rather, I used to, this subscription BS has put us all off the game) and it's a decent game if you have a group to regularly play around with. If you want to play Fallout with friends for a bit, then Fallout 76 is for you. If that isn't what you want, then it really isn't. 
---
If you like the other Fallout games, and are a fan of RPGs in general, then you probably won't like Fallout 76 because it's very action oriented with very little roleplay. There are almost no NPCs, very few meaningful quests, and your actions have literally no impact on the game's world at all. There are also a lot of bugs, so beware of that. The gameplay loop is collecting scrap and improving your gear... and that's all there is to it. That's fine, many online games have the same gameplay loop, but it's not satisfying when none of that has permanence outside of your own character. It's not like you can have a guild like in a proper MMO and have a fancy base with lots of cool stuff or anything like that. 
---
I bought it near launch for £30, and frankly that was too much money for what it is. With friends I find it fun, and it's been quite nice to just explore the map, but to be completely honest it has nothing to commend it over other Fallout games, especially 4. When I've played Fallout 76 solo, my main thought has generally been 'This makes me want to play Fallout 4.'
---
Well according to her Twitter account (not hard to find, same username), she was drinking cheap wine last night so she has to be feeling some of this.
---
I don’t even want this to be an idea let alone an option for Bethesda...
---
Using another launcher is not really the issue for most people. Look at Origin, GoG or Uplay. Some have Exclusives but otherwise they have a lot of the games they sell on Steam as well which provides good competition with sales and what not. What Epic is doing is dropping loads if money to buy rights to games to become Exclusives to their store only. Borderlands 3 is Epic exclusive until like April, they bought out Rocket League and there is much more. Now, usually having competition is usually a good thing but Epic is basically forcing people into using their client that is lacking the most basic of features (forums and shopping cart to name a few) and their excuses as to why are usually ridiculous and seem to come down to Tim Sweany just trying to get back at Steam. There is way more to all of this, and most of the time it becomes a huge circlejerk of Epic=bad Steam=good but there are some legit reasons to not support anything Epic is involved with.
---
So you evade the fact that you told a bold faced lie on Reddit? Ok dude 👍🏽
---
I preordered 76 but I eventually quit playing largely because of stash limitations.  I recently heard the news about this subscription plan, and I honestly feel burned by Bethesda.
---
They just put themselves on my short list of developers not to trust.
---
I agree on that end but I'm sure they will have another outfit next month and you'll buy. The crap box is the worst part
---
Pro tip: don't accept new friend requests to avoid mooches. 
---
Pro tip: charge for access. That'll be 10k 5.556 for the friend request accept
---
No scrap deleted lol. I even relogged a few times to make sure.
---
Genuine question. What specifically do you think is "broke". There are crashes.disconnects, but they've been pretty few and far between for a me for a while now(I'm on Xbox if that matters) and it's pretty easy to just jump back in, not saying it's ok, but it's not a deal breaker for me. And I think the end-game can sometimes be a little weak, but that seems to be pretty true about most games these days. I guess I should say I'm kind of a slow, stop and smell the roses, kind of explorer-type player. I jump to events I like to do, clear out a couple of places I haven't been to in a while, do daily challenges and quests and generally I'm not stopped from doing it.
---
My only complaint with Fo1st is that it should be a running server, not a session, and there should be some admin (ability to remove someone from a game) control for the owner. But this has actually made my gaming group wanting to invite more people into our little circle. Cause instead of being on a 4 person team in a 30 person session. We can be 8 individuals playing together, or be in smaller groups without feeling left out from each other. We're also planning a game that we couldn't do in public, where we split into faction teams and compete for an hour to see what faction can hold the most workshops.
---
I've played 200 hours on PC. I enjoyed maybe my first 5 hours, but it kept my time so I stayed for as long as I could. 
---
I bought &amp; downloaded the PS4 version 1 hour before the update dropped yesterday - and managed to play for *exactly* 3 minutes on my PS4. In that 3 minutes I'd already decided I needed to refund the PS4 version. A few things I noticed in those 3 minutes:
---
* Movement in 3rd person is completely bugged, you cannot walk straight forwards, or aim with a gun while moving.
---
* The janky-ass framerate. Sometimes you can turn extremely smoothly, and other times the game will freeze for a fraction of a second, and you just spin like a madman.
---
&gt;if the game would still be enjoyable to a fallout fan 
---
I've played all of the other Fallout games, and when I play Fallout '76, I feel like I'm playing Fallout 4 with a massive drop in performance, and numerous bugs that should have been fixed from day 1.
---
You've probably already got it, but it's probably also worth noting that Fallout 4: GOTY edition is available for £20 on the Haloween Sale on PS4. It's Fallout '76 with much less bugs, much more polished gameplay, and much better graphics.
---
I'm waiting for a refund from PlayStation due to Fallout 76 not working (can't get into the game or past any loading screens) and have bought Fallout 4 to play until The Outer Worlds releases.
---
Get me off this games as a service dogshit
---
See you on launch day for elder scrolls 6 :)
---
Imagine spending money on anything Bethesda launches and expecting it to work. You're either completely new to Bethesda games or a moron.
---
I understand the idea behind why you are quoting this, and they have lied/changed their mind about other things, which doesn’t promote good will.
---
That said none of the DLC’s have cost money so far and I don’t think an optional subscription is the same thing as a season pass, at least not according to the online definition, “a discounted package for current and future downloadable content (DLC) packs for a video game. Its name originates from the concept of a season ticket.”
---
Semantics, I know. But only somewhat.
---
There's still hope.
---
It was mainly getting a full game for your initial purchase with actually worth it dlcs. You actually got what you paid for at full price. After skyrim that went out the window.
---
I was using the general you, as in any customer of this year long dumpster fire. Not *you* specifically. So don't feel barked at.
---
Unless ...
---
&gt; i stopped paying for this game months ago.
---
So you did pay for it, eh? [Huh ...](https://gfycat.com/astonishinggiftedindianspinyloach)
---
It's like that meme with the triggered lady, the one with the glasses and bulging eyeballs. 
---
Such over reaction. All they did was adopt almost the exact same model for FO76 that ESO had. What most likely happened is 76 was tanking financially, so they brought in the marketing team from ESO to help save it. Everyone should be grateful, I'm sure the other option was to scrap the game entirely.
---
Please point me to any company worth billions anywhere and tell me they just build stuff to break even.
---
I’ll wait.
---
If you think FO76 has been a cash cow from launch you’re mistaken.  True ...... Beth made a mess out of the game and now trying to fix it changing the format.
---
We’re all getting a better game...be patient.
---
It's their job.
---
 I get where you are coming from, but to play devil's advocate... there were several statements made about the micro transactions being limited to skins and flair only, and DLC being free.. Now we're seeing actual game mechanics being on a cash only basis, what next?
---
Are you drunk?! \*\*\*Looks at user name\*\*\*\*  
---
... right then.
---
Yeah that and people who are angry about this aren't as likely to be logged in as those willing to do it.
---
I do have game pass, I’m probably going to this right after class, thanks.... will this work for modern warfare too?
---
Never planned on paying it, I was just overwhelmed with all the angry post and articles that appeared everywhere and since I work the game industry, let's just say that was a very debated subject at work for the past 2 days.
---
My Friend sent me this link. Fallout 1st so far so good. Monthly atoms is great, and a lot of them. The unique outfits are awesome, because now I can save the atoms for camp items, power armor skin, and the other goodies in the Atomic Shop. Gives you an extra camp that may only have a few things in it, but it’s a quick way to scrap, stash, cook, sleep, or play some tunes. Throw it down anywhere and if you leave it somewhere you can free travel to it and spend less camps scavenging the wasteland. And my favorite, the scrapbox. It junks all your stuff for you, besides weapons and armors, and it has infinite stash weight for your junk. My Stash weight hasn’t been this low since I started playing fallout. 
---
I am Happy with what they have done so far, and I am excited to see what each month will bring. That being said...
---
The only 2 things I would suggest for a better gaming experience is allowing 10-12 players to join a private server, as well as automatically putting everyone in the server on one big team, since you guys have to be friends to join anyways. It would help share the dropped loot and XP from quests too!
---
Thanks for reading my opinion :) Tell me yours!
---
thanks for reading!
---
I honestly think to some degree it is a good deal but hear me out.  The Atoms you get and exclusive cosmetic stuff are nice for the price.  I get that you have to pay for Private Servers but there is so much wrong it.  They are not exclusive to you and they only accommodate 8 players.  But the big part I take issue with is the Scrap Box.  This should be a feature for everyone as it has been 100% proven to not affect server stability at all.
---
What I would do is give players free membership based on when they first played Fallout 76.  For example, if you played since the BETA / Launch, you should get a full year of free membership.
---
But the most important thing in my opinion is that there is not enough content in the game to even justify a subscription at all.  End Game activities from launch to now have relatively stayed the same - farm Legendaries and crafting resources, mostly for ammo.  Yeah sure, Vault Raids are a thing but they are a mess and rewards do not justify playing them.
---
Please tell me this domain was registered anonymously, making it much more difficult for it to be taken down via legal means.
---
Thank you for buying Atoms to make the game better for others, not just yourself ;P
---
Jesus fucking christ you guys are overreacting because they made ONE bad game lmfao
---
2019 outrage culture: company putting out 1 bad game = entire company is now dead
---
What's with the name calling?
---
No, i just made the decision a long time ago not to argue with idiots on the internet who cant do anything but insult and badger.  
---
Just like I dont talk to Antifa.
---
Just making his point, aren't you? No comment except to correct his spelling, even though you knew what he meant...
---
Im getting it but thats alot of valid points i hope it doesnt destroy the community but i do feel like 1st is a gateway to this game being better in the future i see the possibility of mods RP potential (although i bet alot of the player factions ar kinda bummed about the 8 player limit on these servers i know i am) but this does open another door for community and player made events mt big concerns is what does this mean for wastelanders and how it rolls out, what impact will this have on in game economy, im sure dupers are already hard at work trying to exploit private servers, and which way the atom shop is gunna go in regards to pricing, utility items and the day a skin gives an effect bonus like how Fo4 nuka quantum paint gives ap refresh... itll happen and people are gunna be pissed
---
Your mother was a mole rat and your father smelt of diseased cranberries.
---
You must have gone through a lot of straws to get to this point.
---
😂 With the way everyone is going on you'd think they'd be unable to buy food for themselves if they spent a tenner on the game a MONTH!!
---
Were talking like 33 pence a day people.....
---
The originals weren't open world either, that came with Bethesda...
---
I totally understand and its only natural to compare. I'm sure I can go through my comment history and find a spiteful comparison that I may regret/don't agree with now. I've had conversations with people comparing games and wishing X did something like Y. I think its more acceptable if you're comparing title 2 with title 1 by the same company like Fallout 3 with Fallout 4.
---
Imagine though that you worked your ass off for 3+ years on a passion project that really takes talent to complete. You couldn't wait to release it to the world for that short window of being validated and you woke up the next day and most of the headlines were about some controversy that another game developer did instead of how great your game was. That is what is happening and why I posted the devs interview of them saying it first hand.
---
Edit: words
---
On top of that if you wanted to invite someone you can’t do it from already in the world. Tried with my friend last night and had to back out to main menu. So the workshops I had were lost because you don’t go back to the same world after. So stupid.
---
I mean if someone is stupid enough to buy this subscription they are getting what they deserve .
---
If i like the outfit maybe i will
---
You see, the sentence is structured perfectly. Again, to my point about going to school.
---
Lol lucky this time, we'll see
---
Go check out Anthem, No Man's Sky, or Elite Dangerous. They don't do subscription s over there.
---
1 week later: "this game is too short and boring wtf"
---
Not sure why you're linking to a web archive page when the actual page works fine
---
Its working as intended for Bugthesda besides if you are dumb to buy and support this company with those practices you probably deserve what you get.
---
Not really, I just believe that it’s not going towards development. I gave you my reasoning, you just didn’t like it. Answer my question, you don’t have to though if you don’t want to.
---
Press x to doubt
---
I hope so or I’m selling the game
---
Because I have fun playing it.
---
The post I saw said it did, but I can't vouch.
---
Are servers down or something i can't log on
---
I have never had to pay for a server to pay with friends, why do I have to in this game?
---
Considering: 
---
A) The game's buggy and gets even more fucked with every patch/update
---
B) DLCs get either launched too early (check A) or gets launched with severe technical issues. 
---
C) Private Servers cost money? Tell that to Dedicated Servers (Minecraft, Ark). 
---
And, on top of that, you don't lose your scrap, items, things don't disappear, don't disappear off the map, don't get raided every 24 hours, don't get weird bugs and NPCs DO have a purpose (instead of getting shelved for an entire year because "wE wAnTeD fOr oUr pLaYeRs tO bE tHe NpCsss"). 
---
It's ludicrious to believe this game has a sliver of decency considering the horrendous push from Bethesda's part to incorporate more MTX instead of actually fixing the game and polish the mechanics that require fixing. What do we get? A 2-by-4 rusted fridge for $8.99 because screw the playerbase.
---
This should be always on the top of this subreddit as a forever reminder of how Bugthesda is a shitty company.
---
This is just pure gold.
---
You can feel the author slowly spiralling into rage as he was making it .
---
IT JUST WORKS .
---
Lol wait wouldn’t a better example be selling a gram of coke a day doesnt make you a cartel kingpin?
---
Don't act like pirating software is morally right in any way whatsoever.
---
If you're pirating it you clearly like the product enough and want to play it.
---
If you want to pirate things, admit you're a scumbag. Don't try and act righteous.
---
What a load of s-crap
---
Retart huh. Shot your own foot there.
---
I haven't been able to play because we're decorating I can't wait to get back on what's good? I'm so sick of everyone moaning
---
Yes and don’t think anybody needs to explain why. As for being calm, it’s not the people defending it that need too.
---
What changes lol
---
Lol why let it all sit in stashes that will never be used again
---
Just going to http://falloutfirst.com/ works for me
---
Good stuff, one of my fav parts of this game so far is going through other people’s camps to see how they set things up, more often than not I’m pretty impressed
---
I've been gone but kept it installed waiting for Wastelanders.  Installing when I'm off work first thing.  At this point I'm not even excited for Starfield or ES6.  Bethesda is shitting their bed and rolling in it while expecting us to pay for it.
---
I don't think thats what happened , since the scrapbox works on instances what probably happened is that the game don't understand on what place you are private/public And does not load since it thinks it is on the wrong place.
---
Why on Earth are we comparing a multiplayer game to an RPG? Are we that desperate to bash Bethesda?
---
I always wanted to meet the doofuses who take pride in being exploited, now I have. Thank you very much
---
Then he shouldn’t be making promises that he can’t keep
---
I have still fun playing it. And that's all that matters to me.
---
Well wasn’t the NCR Ranger Armor just pre-war riot gear armor? Used by the military and law enforcement?
---
Uhh... Can i copy this?
---
You literally said this: "And switch out the maps. Would love a random choice between the two."
---
"I will buy this, I will buy that". Why? I guess some people just like to pay for what was originally supposed to be in the game. Pets, more caps,  workshops  and other FUN stuff. Supporting developers for their hard work is one thing, it’s another to throw money into overpriced skins. People spent so much money buying these atoms. And now you can buy one subscription for 13 bucks and get even more atoms and other things. Why am I surprised at all?
---
This has got to be the best possible form of protest. Good job, guy.
---
And the NW helmet
---
The thing is... I think most people DO mean it. Bethesda is being like that shitty family member who has finally pushed away the few remaining people who loved them.
---
A single scene can tell a pretty compelling story. A few human remains, a crashed car... You start piecing together what happened....
---
Not all stories need to be laid out in full text....
---
Ok, you win. I concede, my point on that is mute. I apologize. I’ll edit that part out.
---
Studio is now officially Junk
---
Didn't dig through anything he has 2 comments.
---
He's trying to whore himself for karma which is stupid when he agrees with everyone hating, lmfao.
---
&gt; Cuck
---
Did you just unironically call me a cuck lmfao that's hilarious
---
&gt; series of degrading games
---
Skyrim - good game
---
Fallout 4 - good game
---
Fallout 76 - crappy game
---
1 bad game lmao. Also you're very obviously not a user of this sub. You came here in the controversy to circlejerk didn't you? It's so obvious you're brigading.
---
The attitude and culture of a lot of gamers is so damned weird. In what world is it ridiculous or unreasonable to pay for new things? Do you buy a DVD and expect to get the sequel free? Of course not. Do you buy a car and expect to get all the shinies added to the next year model added to yours? Of course not. Do you rant at the car manufacturer because the next guy was willing to pay more for extra features? Of course not!
---
You buy a product (video game or otherwise) because you make the decision that it’s worth X to you in its current form. There are never guarantees that it will get better over time, be it a car or bottle of wine or a video game. If you get additional stuff for free down the road, that’s awesome! If you don’t, you still got what you decided to pay for.  If there are cool features available to buy later then it’s up to you to make that personal decision again.
---
We bought a product that has gotten better over time without having to pay more.  That’s awesome, we’re already ahead of the curve compared to 99% of the things you’ll pay for in life. Paying more (optionally!) to get even more added stuff is not unreasonable.
---
It's a business, not a museum. If they are no longer able to continue to create that same money making content, then they should be replaced by those who can.
---
So your opinion is that I am not entitled to mine.  Got it...
---
Only time was when the the Blackbird skin for power armor returned a few months back and I wasn't able to get enough Atoms together from challenges before it was going to leave again.
---
Then you all will be bitching how outer world's is a poor attempt at a twist on new vegas
---
Because this sub is a never ending circle jerk of outrage lmao
---
They might just take your letter, sign their names to it, then charge everyone a dollar to read it. Hey, anyone CAN do this.
---
Because I like this game and it’s fun. You can jump on the “I hate Bethesda” bandwagon. But I like playing this game.
---
I like this guy because I like rick and Morty. I dont like this guy because hes full of crap. Bring that slaughter baby.
---
These fucking buffoons are no match for the community they created
---
You're just mad you didn't think of it first.
---
yeah used those free atoms for a awesome new tombstone .
---
That is one thing I have not tried. Maybe I will re-download the game and then try that.
---
So you came onto reddit to complain about the complainer. Makes total sense.
---
Give it about 5 days to let the dust settle and this subrdddit will calm back down.
---
Thank you, angry person, for proving my point.  What other negative things do you have to say...
---
The Ranger outfit sells itself. They'd also nab me with Reilly's Rangers paint LOL
---
People downvote you but I think you are right.  
---
You don't know their lives so maybe there really isn't an option, but yeah I wouldn't want to do their job, even for more money than other jobs.   
---
If your job conflicts with your morals and you can find a job that doesn't compromise your values (which to be honest I think is more often possible than people like to admit), then you should switch even if it isn't easy, cause that stuff just makes you sick.  
---
At the core though I think it is Bethesda fault, because these people are often just hired to take the shit that the CEO deserves, AND needs so much more to hear.
---
Basically this. 76 was a step outside their comfort zone, and it didnt work out as well as they had hoped, but even with that, Todd has a record of successful games and one failure wont really ruin that.
---
The fact that they **can** get the site back through the legal system is not the most relevant fact; The damage is already done - the legal system would take too long.  When someone loses a domain in this fashion, they need the domain back...**NOW**.  Both the tangible and intangible losses can't be recovered.
---
The company's reputation has also taken a hit.
---
I feel they killed it because no one played them.  everytime I went on the only time people were there were to get the weekly weapon challenge.
---
Some people have no other game to play with friends. Some people are so lost in buyer's remorse or obsessed Bethesda fanboys, they'll defend it to the death. Too many idiots have too much money and and just don't use it responsibly.
---
Nice 
---
IT JUST WORKS !
---
 I haven't lol
---
(Im not advocating the sub or saying its worth its price.) I have no problem with people on my buddy list hopping in or out. Anyone on there is someone i talk to in game and if they were to cause problems i would remove them from my friends list. Though i don't add just everybody i see or accept random friendships. Most of the time that is a red flag for a griefer to begin with in this game.  I also don't have a relationship with many people on my list outside of the game so they aren't notifiable on discord and there is no in game chat window. Noticing me in a private server and joining it is pretty much the best and only way to find me right now. All of this bad planning but it may be the exact reason it works the way it does at the moment.
---
Idk about that one. You uninstalled one mess and fired up another one
---
We may not like it, but the game isn’t a failure. The game is making money. That’s all Zenimax cares about.
---
You have to remember that your opinion and the opinion of the people on Reddit does not encompass the majority of the player base. Lots of people love 76 for what it is. I don’t, and you don’t, but that doesn’t make the game a failure - it means it doesn’t live up to our expectations.
---
This ‘sniff sniff’ is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. This person may not be the hero we deserve, but they’re the person we need.
---
I would suspect that Bethesda probably knows everyone will subscribe and this sub is such a small minority of they're fan base..... I'm a dedicated fallout player and I didn't even know reddit existed to this extent 6 months ago.
---
Game developers are definitely greedy, and I definitely don't like it.
---
But am I willing to pay a tenner a month, and get some atoms, benefits and discounts on my favourite game?.... I absolutely am.
---
I'm with Francois here. 
---
A) there is no return of an old duping method. I have a friend that sells stuff on Ebay. He hasn't had any of his old methods come back yet. He tries then regularly. 
---
B) I can almost guarantee that the reason behind the subscription is this: a meeting was called, to discuss the future of FO76. The game was financially insolvent, and something had to be done. Either scrap the game and close the servers, or restructure a bit and charge a subscription, just like their counterpart game for TES series. They chose option B. Obviously.
---
This isn't about greed, this is just how it works. You can't keep a constantly evolving game running with no money coming in. The subscription was necessary. They have to pay the designers, the programmers, the developers, the publishers, etc etc. It's a very costly process. That so many people feel like they should just be given everything for free, or that Zenimax should just take money from a different game yo keep 76 running, and not try to the lack of income is ridiculous. This ordeal has made it readily apparent how many people that play 76 have 0 financial commitments they have to meet. I bet most of the people complaining sit at their mother's/grandmother's house all day long playing video games, while said maternal figure does their laundry, makes their food, calls in their doctor appointments, etc etc. It's ridiculous the amount of entitlement that has come to.the surface during this.
---
Yes yes, unless i'm unnaturally angry about the same vidya games as you I'm totally stupid. Don't you have an Angry Joe video to go masturbate over or something?
---
Maybe if the game was flawless... Idk I'd probably not have a problem with this
---
Aye same why would you have sympathy for people enjoying something and not actively spreading hate, it should be us that feel sorry for everyone making these posts
---
Do you understand how confirmation bias works? The same person who comes to rant on Reddit, then likes a video on you tube that supports their bias, then makes angry comments on a twitter feed that supports their bias, then comes back to reddit and promotes an article to others that supports their bias, isn't a mob of angry people. It's 1 angry person, who is only seeking out outlets that support their bias. 
---
People who are angry, or have a bad experience, are 2-3 times more likely to express themselves negatively in social media. That **doesn't mean there are more of them**, just that they're the most vocal. And unfortunately, this sub can be quite the bias confirming circle jerk. 
---
Now, if this outrage lasts longer than all the previous fizzled "outrages", or if the player base drops noticeably, then I will have to reprise my opinion, but I don't think it likely.
---
Edit: and to answer your other comment, YT isn't worthy of reference, at least IMO, and my FB and Twitter feeds must be wildly different than yours, because I'm not seeing the vast negativity.
---
Bethesda is trying to milk it’s fans for all they can get away with. It is wrong and you know it. Saying bethesda is a shell of what it once was is an understatement. 
---
People like SmakzMS are just corporate shills who allow massive companies to continues to take advantage of consumers. They are a vocal minority. 
---
Most people agree that this game sucked before a paywall was even implemented, and look at it now
---
I thought about doing the same but I like that my enemies cant find my paper bag either haha
---
What a stupid post. Until Bethesda makes a statement that says: "Everything Pete Hines has ever said is bullshit, we're sorry"... then why wouldn't anyone assume Bethesda stands behind everything he's said?
---
Nuke codes included with fallout 1st
---
could be your wrong about your speculations?
---
Because pete and todd made the company, well earned billions for them, this still is a "side" project for Bethesda, you son't have to play the game, you don't have to pay 13 dollars a month.... not that it isn't comoletely #### furthermore zenimax can't say anything about what they do with their "side" projects and definitely can't fire them
---
It's LAPD Riot Armor from before the war, the NCR just adopted it for their ranger uniforms.
---
&gt;A documentary with roughly 1.5 million views on YouTube (in over one year) doesn't come close to informing their players.
---
So now you're claiming because it didn't have enough views, it was intentionally kept a secret from players? Yeah... no. You're fabricating bullshit to make an argument. The fact that it wasn't viewed enough times doesn't mean they hid the fact. That's pure nonsense.
---
&gt;Furthermore, the documentary still paints Maryland as the driving force behind the game. Fallout 76 was portrayed as the next game from the same team that brought us Skyrim and Fallout 4, and it wasn't.
---
Did you actually watch it? Maryland was the driving force. They wanted to do a multiplayer version of Fallout 4, and even had a working prototype during development. They wanted it set in West Virginia because that setting is right in their backyard (like D.C. and Boston). Austin was brought on board to get their tech working in an online environment, and subsequently took over development after it launched. This isn't an uncommon practice pooling multiple studios together based on various resources. Rockstar, Ubisoft, and EA do on many of their titles.
---
I guarantee it. There is zero chance they will charge.
---
I mean I've been happy this far. The addition of this doesn't suddenly make me not happy, so I think I'll live without it.
---
Good monetization is as basic as when the gaming industry took off. You produce great content, people throw money at you for that content. 
---
What we have here is, produce the bare minimum of trash contents, and keep charging more and more for it.
---
And?
---
Yes. We like it. Good job.
---
Do it, I got it a few days ago on the same sale and it’s def worth the $24. As for what your reading on the subreddit? From what I can see it doesn’t really effect low level new players. If you have any idea what the games about and are still interested I’d do it. 
---
I’m still quite happy with my purchase despite the current backlash
---
Why would they pay you for something you already do for free?
---
What reports. 
---
Everythign worked flawlessly for me.
---
I even tried to break stuff.  Couldnt.
---
Junk box works just fine.  I can craft without moving stuff back to my stash.  Logged out several times and back in again and still have all my stuff.
---
My stash is 300lb lighter now, so I can store more legendaries to scrip later.
---
The tent is awesome.  I can now bounce to remote areas for free (I set my secondary up at D-9)
---
The emotes are hillarious.
---
I havent used the ranger outfit yet though.  I think im going to stick with the dancing cowboy look.
---
Will do, I have all picklock but no hacker, but I have 28 lvls worth of perk cards to pick from, I think I can manage ha
---
Haven't experienced this (yet)
---
Called this a few months ago, and i'm 100% most if not all mods will be sold individually.
---
im gonnaa greeef jooo.. how dare you use your money how you wish... HOW DARE YOU!!!!
---
I remember being dragged through the mud for saying precisely that 🤣
---
Hush, gimme some karma for being wrong
---
Todd, please... we love you but you must stop making fake accounts, telling us that there is still people having fun in F76. C'mon man, we know it is you.
---
You must be on pc that player hacked into the dev room then
---
Free
---
I havent preordered in years.
---
F’n Classic!  Remember this day warriors, remember where you were, for today...greatness shined a light on evil, and evil could not shield its eyes.

Put this person in the Hall of Fame, any of them, pick one, that is how epic this is!
---
Guess you know better
---
I don't have to prove it to you?
---
Refrigrerators and providing advantages to people who pay suck ass.
---
I totally get the private server thing, it makes complete sense. But allowing for additional gameplay enhancements was just outright dumb no matter how you frame it. Most of it sounds good but some people just want unlimited storage and some just want to preserve their food without needing ti break the bank
---
No way, that's so fucking dumb :DDD
---
No, that’s not how modern game servers work at all. Nobody played Survival, that’s why it’s dead.
---
you shouldn't support them considering how shitty they're being to the playerbase as a whole... where are your principles man?
---
Outer Worlds looks fantastic.I can't wait to finally play the Fallout game I have wanted since New Vegas.
---
You know an awful lot about drugs. Anything the DEA should know about you?
---
Go back to NMA.
---
Fallout 4 and Skyrim were immensely well received and still have large playerbases years after release.
---
Fallout 76 was a fucking experiment and it failed and they're trying to recoup their losses because TES6 and starfield are a long way away.
---
I should've known you were one of those morons that say fallout 4 isn't an RPG etc. etc. Using cuck as an insult unironically screams "I'm an actual moron". 
---
Also you never answered me: you havent played fallout 76 have you? you just came here to shitpost.
---
&gt; And I feel like the portion of the community that feels like they have been lied too, just want everything given to them for free.
---
No, I just want the product that was advertised when I paid full price for it. If consumers are willing to lie down and take it when companies sell us lies, where's their incentive to be honest?
---
Season 18 ep 1 give it a try, its a real good one and you will laugh your ass off, cause you will see that im right xD
---
Cool thanks! I jumped on only for a few min since I bought the garden(?) bundle, but I didn't see it. Much appreciated.
---
But but but people said it was broken, so you’re obviously a liar.
---
- Title should be Re Fuzzing.
---
&gt; we need a better fix to find our paper bags after death. 
---
Buy a PC and install glowing bag mod.
---
&gt;Skyrim is incredible game too.
---
Incredibly boring, yes.
---
&gt;And Fallout 4 is good. 
---
It has the best gunplay their Fallout games, I'll give it that.
---
You're uninformed because you don't know what Elder Scrolls blades is, yet you feel like you have the ability to predict what I'm going to do about the next Elder Scrolls release.
---
Yeah the haters can hate and they don’t have a Mothman emote.  Most of the people are mad because their mummy’s won’t pay for the subscription.
---
You expected your scrap getting deleted and private servers that aren’t actually private?
---
I doubt there will be a big enough herd of servers in that state to provide private servers especially in peak times.
---
Yep... 
---
[I'm not sure this plan was thought through.](http://img-galleryroulette.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7.2.gif)
---
Haha well i didn't consider that lol
---
Actually I have, WAAAAAY back when. And now, the only reason I've returned is because your lord and savior has screwed you over again.
---
Why unequip it from Fallout 4, no one can see you using it?
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking this
---
We did though...I'm not worried about a little scrap missing if that's indeed the case. In the long run my scrap box will pay off. Oh and the list of other stuff was awesome. Outfits, icons, tents, 16 dollars worth of atoms, which paid for my halloween decorations. So yeah, I'm good.
---
Dude its 12 bucks the 1650 atoms pay for itself.
---
Probably a lot of Jet and Old Possum.
---
How?
---
Destiny 2 is trending right now lmao. It's huge.
---
just head on over to r/fallout76filthycasuals

I posted a suggestion to do this with a screen cap of me doing it but got fan boy obliterated.

Blackpowder for sure reminds me of the last samurai
---
He's still getting your money, because he owns part of Bethesda.
---
Oh I forgot to mention how they pulled ghost shells and sparrows to shove in their mtx store
---
Dunno, the past 24+hours have been doozies. 
---
I've been trying to compare it to the previous TSE nerfs, and the bannination waves. It's only been 24 hours though, and I think the angry TSE posts lasted for close to 4 days.
---
Now this is the best formulated evidence I've seen in a long time on reddit. Thanks for this.
---
I really should've noticed this, and to an extent I did, but since fo3 I've never seen any of the dumbing down as anything to hate. Ofc they made changes I liked and some I didn't but it just was never so bad that it made me snap like this one did.
---
Holy shit this is the opposite of the sentiment alot of people have. 'Deep down everyone knows they made a good game', what exactly is good about it and do I have to excavate 400 layers of crap to find it.
---
North west of Lucky Hole mine at monorail track
---
More importantly, is it fun?
---
Thing is, from what I can see in-game, FAR more people are buying the subscription than not. But yet this Reddit seems to be showing a vocal, and biased, view that the Fallout player base is in an uproar about it. If the Discords I frequent are any indication, folks were angrier it took Bethesda so long to release Halloween decorations than rage over "PTW". In fact, I even saw many players returning BECAUSE of Fallout First being offered...
---
The reactions of people like yourself alone is well worth the cost. Reddit has been almost as entertaining as Fallout 76 itself is 🤣😂🤣
---
One would think
---
Just when people thought Bethesda had finally reached rock bottom, they use all that money to buy a big fucking drill. I'd be laughing my ass off if it wasn't so sad.
---
I haven't come across the already looted/dead mobs issue though - it's been working just fine for me.
---
I'm actually level 50 in the game because I wanted to see if the game got better after a certain point. It didn't, so I uninstalled it and reclaimed 70 gb of space.
---
I have 2 comments.  And half of them talk about Bugs in the game.  Right.  That's a strong argument dude.  You should be a lawyer.  Thank you for contributing to my Karma grab and proving my point...
---
This. There’s something to be said about whales who pour thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars into MMOs. Maybe that satisfaction isn’t enough to keep you from continuing spending endlessly because you could be putting it towards things that bring you tangible happiness in the real world.

---
These were some of my thoughts and that's why I came in the conclusion that they have abandoned this game. That's just sad especially for a franchise like this.
---
Yeah, ultimately the community really wanted the game to be good, turns out Bethesda doesn't care much for that though.
---
Their is a difference between releasing a "Full game" and then adding DLC later date than releasing a "Half game" on purpose knowing your full intentions are to nickle and dime the customer base with DLC later.  You make it sound like Bethesda would be hurting for money if they would of added a lot of the DLC they have now into their Retail release. That's a load of crap......You can make money on a game when you actually put the effort and not half ass the game so you can make a quick buck.....Look at Witcher 3(yes it's not a MP game) the devs made a Great game that didn't need lootboxes to make the game great.  Word of mouth got around on how good the Witcher 3 was and guess what?..People bought and CD PROJEKT RED made lots of money off it.  Then they release 2 expansions to it and i was fine with purchasing those cuz they game they made, didn't need to have that dlc because the game was already complete as it is.  So you can't use that their is no way Bethesda would of made same amount of money if they would of released the DLC with Base game at release date..Word of mouyth is what hurt them when they released a half ass broken game..
---
Also Hi felicia!
---
I was actually hesitant on buying Outer Worlds because I was already playing FO76 and Greedfall in my spare time but now... Outer Worlds it is.
---
They didn't set it to half price after launch, retailers did because they ordered bulk expecting this AAA title from an established studio to sell like hotcakes. Then the PR shitstorm happened and it ended up not selling, so they had to clear stock.
---
I doubt this shitty cash grab will get reduced because it's purely a digital purchase and they've probably already had several thousand morons buy it.
---
Oh I thought it was from people randomly killing them
---
bethesda deserves no defending, praise, love, or good will anymore. people who continue to give anything like that are seriously delusional and causing damage to the gaming community by backing up harmful behavior by bethesda and other shitty companies like them.
---
there needs to be a line in the sand, and it was definitely fucking crossed a long while back now.
---
Literally everything I've pointed out. And 90% of these posts are for people actually tryna get some change.
---
Cool, see you when ES6 drops.
---
Fo4 was shit too . Bgs doesn’t understand what the fo world is supposed to be and just reskinned ol carebear Skyrim . I guess I will have to go to some outer worlds to get my fix of exploding heads that fill my life with dark humor
---
There’s something going on with the ranger armor as well. I put it on last night and my chest piece disappeared. Wasn’t in my inventory or stash. I renamed all my armor as well so it would stand out when I was scripping stuff so I know the vendor didn’t eat it. I submitted a ticket to see if Beth could restore it, but I’m not holding my breath at this point.
---
Last time I checked the game is not free and it has a shop to sell shit.
---
Business may be this strange alien concept to you, but let me tell you a very common phrase in the business world, which is a tried, tested and proven point: "You are only as good as your last month's sales".
---
What they have made for Zenimax previously is irrelevant, if they no longer produce those billions, they will be fired, businesses don't keep people around because they used to be good at one point. 
---
As for profit, it made one yeah, but nothing like a game from Bethesda should have. Your business isn't a success just because you do a better than breaking even, shareholders want their dividends.
---
Half the people here saying they're uninstalling never even owned the game anyway. Over half the users on this sub as of today are completely new that just came here to join the hate circlejerk.
---
We went from 3000 daily active users to 10,000.
---
You commented the same copypasta "jumping on the band wagon" bullshit all of the kids on this reddit are using to justify their parents card purchases.
---
There was nothing childish about my comment. I whole heartedly meant it. 
---
I'm not here because I'm playing Fallout 76. I'm only here to laugh at Bethesda and the people still supporting them.
---
Seriously?? You actually paid for this????? You should've known that this subscription system is total bullshit yet you still bought it. You have no one to blame but yourself for supporting crappy business practice like this. Shame on you.
---
That’s not how confirmation bias works. Simply because I’m outraged just as much as the majority of response to the game doesn’t mean I’m basing the majority of responses being negative on my own views. Actually confirmation bias requires me to have a theory before evaluating the evidence, whereas that’s impossible since my conclusion came after the evidence. That the response is mostly negative *is the only logical conclusion to come to, considering there’s nothing pointing otherwise.* The backlash on every single form of social media isn’t just in the form of comments, it’s in the form of *every single method of responding* including media, comments, like/dislike ratio, and overall attention.
---
When overall attention to an already consistently poorly rated game is incredibly negative in response to yet another unpopular thing they’ve done, that defeats the notion it’s just a “vocal minority.” Simply because people who are pissed are likeliest to voice their opinion *doesn’t change the fact that the negative opinions outnumber the positive exponentially more than the rate of respondents who typically post negative opinions.*
---
You act as if this is contained to one area, and one person is making blanketed claims that aren’t true. You act as if it’s just a circle jerk on one notoriously anti-Bethesda medium. On BETHESDA’S POSTS THEMSELVES they’re getting ratio’d. Media sources that are just reporting on it the response is negative. There isn’t any medium where the response ISN’T negative. The confirmation bias is you and a few other people “jerking each other off” about the “vocal minority” which is not indicative whatsoever.
---
Yeah but it wasn't rude about it...
---
The issue isn't with turning a single-player game into an online game (they very early said it was a 'spin-off), the issue is selling 'offline mode' back to the players who have bought the game with a fucking subscription.
---
Everyone is over reacting.
---
The cosmetics will never give any bonuses. The gas masks that are part of cosmetic bundles don't even protect you from the elements. Literally every single clothing item or armor in FO4 had a bonus. Every power armor paint had a bonus.
---
Nothing about this is P2W. It doesn't make anything easier on dupers. It's literally just unlimited crafting storage (like eso), and the ability to control who can join your server. Oh, and the Ramger Armor (which is cool af and by itself worth $20 imho.
---
I pre-ordered, played since beta. Quit playing a month ago waiting for the dlc to drop, but fuck this
---
No doubt this behaviour will stop at one game only... Right? Right?!
---
Hope he spends it wisely.
---
if every single server goes into this state after 8-10 hours and they have... say a couple hundred servers, well there'll always be "enough" to be available to Fallout 1st members.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, or that I'm right here but I guess it depends on how many people sign up to 1st.
---
&gt;Fo4 was shit too
---
No, it wasn't. It was well received and has a large playerbase even today.
---
&gt;I guess I will have to go to some outer worlds to get my fix of exploding heads that fill my life with dark humor
---
Enjoy that incredibly short game with no real open world, sub par graphics and boring gameplay.
---
hahaha... someone advocating game piracy calling someone else intellectually dishonest.  That's a good one.
---
The Karen is strong in this one.
---
How dare you enjoy when others are whining loudly 😂
---
Nah think I’ll buy some atoms in your honor.
---
Where's your outrage breh?!  I mean I get it but theb again I'm like you as well. Its whatever but sort of sad at the same time.
---
Do you want a cookie? 
---
Congrats for being employed buddy, I’m impressed. If you’re trying to compensate for something, like your clearly GIANT brain, it’s working fantastically.
---
We're actively doing our part to ensure games are held to a standard in the same way people don't stand idly by while a parent neglects their children.
---
It isn't offline mode though. It's still always online.
---
Pretty easy to play it on a friend’s console. I will never give bethesda another dime of my personal money.
---
Who is screwed over? Not me. I paid for a subscription and got extra goodies and I’m happy.
---
What are the consequences? Dare implies they'll be consequences.
---
greed happened to them. greedy, money grabbing cunts.
---
its that corporate bullshit and these assholes like todd who apparently forgot what made them what they are in the first place.
---
stop supporting them on any level just like ea, activision blizzard, and others. it's all such a joke now.
---
well, yes, i'm just calling them what they called it, but there are options in the survey so you can say you wanted them to be persistent servers, is that what you are refering to?
---
Or with government supply requisitions amirite???
---
Same! Wish I could've gotten a refund after my first month of playing this dumpster fire since I encountered so many game-breaking bugs or other bugs that just downright soured the experience. Broken quests, disappearing teammates who were right in front of me, events that didn't trigger for every teammate, and more. I came back about a month ago to try it again and it was somewhat better but after yesterday's news, I've uninstalled again.
---
Ok, I’m frustrated with Bethesda, but, seriously, criticizing the customers and players is only going to make Bethesda look good; now they can write off criticism as irrational mob mentality.
---
Agreed, some sheep will pay anything and Bethesda knows it.
---
&gt; What's next, the game somehow deletes itself,
---
You weren't around during early access were you?
---
That’s the image I was looking for originally. But also thought of trying go for junk/scrap look too. As the two styles could work.
---
Go ahead. Be a cuck, you have the freedom to do so.
---
If.
---
Look. I don’t play it. I was never going to play it. I’m sure as Hell not GOING to play it. I’ve been popcorn munching this from the sidelines from the beginning. From the beginning, people have said “if you enjoy this game, that’s okay.” It’s not. What this company has done has made enjoying this game not okay anymore. Not even if you’re some kind of gaming masochist looking to absolve your sins. Stop playing this game.
---
Antifa76 vs GOP 1st
---
I think Fallout 1st is great. A step in the right direction. Same backlash I heard when ESO came out with ESO Plus. Once the flames died down the service made the game better overall. Its not pay to win because we are not really competing with each other. We are supposed to be working together. If I had 20000 acid in my stash, and you had only 50 acid in your stash, I would not have the upper hand in a firefight. All I can hear when someone is bitching about this is jealousy.
---
you tried that sub? or just read from mighty internet that all junk is going deleted when placed to scrap box.
---
Idk man, I haven't lost anything. Some said they have. I'm with you on that fiber though. Dont take my fiber!
---
I expected proof of your scrap claim but nah.
---
well I just don;t understand why people always blame Todd and the developers, when usually they blame the publishers. I mean look at all the problems Bioware has had. But its literally NEVER their fault apparently. Its always EA thats causing the issues.
---
What’s wrong with that? Some atoms and cosmetics. I agree the tent and scrap box should not happen. They really dropped the ball there.
---
If you knew how PR works then you wouldn't be surprised that they aren't saying anything.
---
If you take over every workshop in the wasteland and get unlimited rescourses. Could you make alot of grenades and spam grenades? Would being the only one in a world make it easier to farm legendaries? Is being able to craft unlimited ammo a big enough advantage to be able to be called p2w? I know your being sarcastic but I've been thinking alot about it. Basically the pass just makes the game easier by alot. Easier to make as much of anything that you need and would make it easier to farm legendaries. Idk is that p2w?  I'd agree with you that non of the other utility items are p2w. But personally I'm torn on the pass. It could at the very least be plausible to call it p2w. Since you could better gear faster.
---
The subscription is kiling the game.  Fuck waiting for watselanders.
---
What was the roadmap even for?
---
Apparently nobody knows about how the looting system works. The game has a list of the last X-hundred or so items previously looted. It will not respawn those items on the list. You need to pick up more junk elsewhere to push the previously looted items you want out of that list so they will respawn next time you join a server.
---
Items are missing from your private worlds because you already picked them up recently and have not picked up enough other crap elsewhere.
---
Bethesda are a 100+ man company, who get paid very comfortable salaries and have all their required products supplied to them to use. Modders are individuals who don't get paid at all, and also have to work a job through most of the day. They dedicate their free time to it, not their working time. Of course the total workload is lower (apart from on the giant mods like Enderal, which was made to an objectively higher standard than Skyrim) but the work done is more substantial because it's done without payment, and it consumes the *free time** of the modder. 
---
Of course I've never played that game, it's fucking dogshit. It's literally got the biggest list of failures and fuck-ups in triple-A history. You can't get worse than this game.
---
REPORT: Issues. Some people actually paid to get ~~Fallout First~~ Fallout Fist.
---
Never said that. Keep sucking the dick of this corporation that will continue to fuck the entire community over. But hey, all for your precious Ranger armor and "private servers", right?
---
Corporations will do whatever affects their bottom line
---
Don't get crying when TES6 and Starfield is infected with this shit, because you will be responsible for it if it does.
---
Thisisfine
---
I filed a help ticket on their website and they said their developers are working on it.
---
Fuck :/
---
Almost as upset as Jagger when he reads your username.
---
Good setup.
---
I do the same thing with my camps and usually relocate and rebuild with a different idea monthly.
---
I just got done making an Inn. Up in the tree.
---
join Nuclear winter lobby and ull see WAY more than that.
---
You're on a trail. You have to go from point 0 to point 1000000. The thing about this trail is every time you go 10 points forward you have to go 2 points back. However, you are told you can pay to only have to go one point back. You and a friend go on the trail at the same time. You decide not to pay, and your friends does. Everything seems fine at first, but by the time you reach point 100 your friend is now 10 points ahead of you. Your friend has an advantage. That's literally what is happening here! You are exploring this world and anyone not paying to do so monthly is at a disadvantage.
---
This isn't some musical point that requires thousands of game hours. It's a simple point. Being able to skip steps, it even just shorten the time steps take, is an advantage.
---
If there was a monster that had a. 000001% chance to drop the best equipment in the game, and I could pay to have that increased to. 000002 would I have an advantage? Yeah. If I could pay so that it would always do it, would I have an advantage? Saving time is an advantage.
---
It’s my spare money. I’ll do with it what I wish. I enjoy the game and am willing to pay for what FO1st offers. I hope you enjoy whatever you decide to play, genuinely. I hope it makes you happy. This game makes me happy.
---
I bought optimized bracers and motion assist servos from the BoS bot in WS.  IIRC, he has others.
---
What I have not seen is targeting hud and calibrated shocks.
---
Have heard the latter 2 are SBQ drops only, but I could be wrong.
---
I had my camp under the same bridge and used is as a roof. I get the same message.
---
Exact text (my game is in german):
---
Ein Fallout 76-Update hat das Errichten deines C.A.M.P.s an diesem Ort blockiert. Du hast eine kostenlose C.A.M.P.-Plazieung erhalten.
---
Translated to english:
---
A Fallout 76 update blocked the construction of your C.A.M.P. at this location. You have received a free C.A.M.P. Placement.
---
And that make them "legendary"? Oh i remember there was a youtuber, who just as stupid as any youtuber made a "video essay" saying how NV was a prime example of video game as art, while games like the last of us and journey are not qualified.
---
Or another guy who would pick fight with ANYONE who says they like fallout 3.
---
The fact that there are people out there saying such thing reflects what kind of cult the fallout fanbase has formed. This is not about how good or bad a game is but how ignorant and arrogant some people are.
---
So, to be clear, I don't care about any of them and don't seem them as P2W at the same level as other games or things like lootboxes.  That's not to say I can't have empathy or understand the argument (to a certain extent) from people. 
---
While the game has become almost entirely PVE, there is still some PVP events and things like workshops.  
---
*  In theory, the repair kits can allow you to repair your gear or scrap your junk and get it off of you when your in the middle of a PVP fight so that you aren't encumbered or having to switch to a weaker weapon.  I feel this is over blown, and repair kits (better ones) can be obtained in game. 
---
* I honestly don't see much value in the fridge, it just slows the decay by 50%.  I guess it gives you an advantage since you can extend the length of the how long food lasts so you can use the stat boosting food for longer than you would have been able to.
---
* The argument on fallout 1st has been more to the effect of the economy.  You can do workshops without being challenged. You can store endless junk.  This gives you an advantage since you don't have to be picky in what you keep in your stash.  You can keep things that you can turn into profit AND still keep what you were wanting in your stash. 
---
Personally, I think these are a stretch. I understand the concerns on the slope, and I agree that the NCR uniform should not have been locked behind First (it could have been a bonus, but people should still be able to get it with Atoms), I could even see them charging a monthly atom fee for the other services - things you can grind out.
---
Screw it up? Todd Howard himself has stated it’s one of their most purchased dlcs ever. People enable this behavior, it’s not because companies are brainless, it’s because they look at the risks and the rewards and judge: how many will buy it and if X amount of people buy this, it will make up for Y amount of controversy. It doesn’t help that due to the nature of games, controversy will plague a game but the next one will still sell well. Oblivion’s horse armor didn’t effect the sales of Skyrim, so companies watching saw that you could release a really bad add on, sell a ton of it, ignore the controversy, and still release your next game which will go on to be one of the highest selling games of all time.
---
but if people are sending them death threats and insulting them that's incredibly fucking pathetic on our part.
---
It's just a fucking video game. Don't insult community managers who didn't have anything to do with it you manchild.
---
To laugh at you.
---
Do you have access to financial records to prove that? Big companies go out of business all the time. No company is immune to that. And sometimes companies sell things in an attractive bundle for more attention. It’s business especially if you’re desperate.
---
I'd say try it. Id rebuy every expansion again just From them making it free for people to retry , new pvevp modes etc. Unlike 76 they actually listened, fixed and made new modes with players in mind. And with it being a live game now. Every few weeks new story missions ,exotic quests etc release. With or without the pass.
---
Lmao I’m down
---
And dancing robot emote and icon... then shut the f\*#k up :-)
---
"If I just stop eating sometimes I can spend more money on bad vidya updates"
---
Peak consoomer
---
I don't think it will destroy the community but It will certainly change it forever.
---
Aside from the really obvious ones I think you'd be able to find a silver lining to just about everything now I think about it.
---
But here it goes, Unit 731.
---
Cry more
---
It’s a memed version of it
---
I want to clarify that there is more than one Bethesda Games Studio. The one that makes Fallout 76 isn't the same one that makes the Elder Scrolls games and single player Fallout games. Bethesda Softworks publishes there games and is owned by Zenimax Media. Zenimax is known for their greed.
---
Like they say a sucker is born every minute.
---
The sad part is the game was gaining.  People were giving it another chance and enjoying it.   They just can't help but shit away every last ounce of good will they've earned in decades
---
"soon the gamers who were played games between 87-99 will die."
---
Fuck I hope not, I'm only 26.
---
It kills me that they are so two faced about they're complaints. One minute there saying it's over priced and we're getting nothing of value for our subscription fees. Next post they complain were getting unfair advantages that make us OP locked behind a paywall.
---
You can't not, if you're always on dmt to begin with. *taps temple*
---
EXACTLY!
---
You **completely** fail to understand the definition of the term "intellectually dishonest".
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with ethics other than tangentially being associated as a negative trait. It's got absolutely nothing to do with piracy. It's exclusively related to logistics, problem-solving and debate.
---
I feel you man. I pre ordered this game because I'm a huge fan of the fallout franchise and I had high hopes for it. I knew from the moment they shipped my pre order late that it was gonna be a shitty experience. I tried to defend it early on I figured it was still early they would fix it soon but it was just fuck up after fuck up and now with the subscription service that was the last straw
---
My Hero
---
Bravo to that!
---
My scrap has yet to be deleted, and I haven't seen any evidence in any of my runs that people had been there before me.
---
It just seems pointless to me honestly. The game is already incredibly easy. The little challenge it has is what makes it fun. If people want to pay for easy mode- go for it. Seems like a waste of money to me but whatever.
---
It wasn't just greed at doing the bare minimum to get the game shipped, but it's the ongoing bare minimum to run the servers.  
---
It's no wonder the private worlds are stable, the server code and registers aren't full to their limits, every thread isn't at 100%, the server ram isn't maxed out.  
---
If Bethesda coughed up for an extra thread and 2-4gb of ram per instance the game would run without problem. Sure they have to spend a couple of grand to change the inventory routines to use the new thread, but the result would be a system that doesn't lag out and cause the dreaded "server not responding, controls disabled" crap.  
---
Make a profit, sure, but make it by providing a decent quality product.  
---
They would spend much less time/money on damage control too.
---
you say that as if lady devann can impact the game in any way.
---
You know they're community managers right?
---
I only ever bought the bundles that had a costume attached.
---
Also, the subscription doesn't give anyone exclusive access to DLC content. They promised that any future DLCs would be available at no charge. They never once said they would never charge a subscription for quality of life features.
---
Please join us at /r/FuckFO76 
---
We need to build a strong sub to make them accountable to whatever extent we can :P
---
because it's fun
---
Right? I’m totally loving it. I’m glad someone thinks I deserve to be happy.
---
I did my part
---
I think so too.
---
They'd have to make it or at least "private" worlds and the stash box free to calm the community down a bit.
---
Every gamer hates Bethesda atm
---
WEWERERIGHTTTTTT!!!! And unsurprisingly, people are shocked.
---
Off the top, it'd mean more space for vendor items and longer trips farming or doing events before visiting a station/craft/stash.  
---
Another pretty big improvement would be hoarding legendaries for scrip.  As of now, I usually reach the point where I might as well stop playing and wait for the next vendor refresh because I've already collected my scrip for the day and I cannot hold anymore legendary loot (while after already having cleaned out my inventory and STASH down to the bare minimum).  Likewise for holding loot/meds/etc. to sell for caps at a train stations.
---
Further, even if I do hit that point where I've almost filled up my newly found STASH space, then I'd at least have the option of farming for materials that can be transferred to the scrapbox.  I'm at work, so I can't check, but if stable flux counts as scrap then I could alternatively go and farm that (yes I'd need some space for the raw flux).
---
Exactly. Spend it on actual games. I do that too.
---
But don't spend them of fucking skins. It's pathetic. Every once in a while it's ok. It's a guity pleasure. But paying them $100 a year? Especially in a rubbish game like this? It's insane. If I want to indulge myself, I'd rather buy an Armani suit once a year than 20 pieces of rag a week, right? Especially if the rags are priced like branded clothes.
---
To add to that it my first legendary I had seen. I dont know if its like FO4 but I think I would have noticed my first legendary, especially if they do that whole show you the legendary like FO4.
---
Down the line, there's going to need to be some kind of LFG system for finding those kinds of servers and groups to play with then. That sounds like a cool plan from your group, but like.... how would I, as a random person, ever know about it? At least in the public servers, I have a chance of stumbling across it. Definitely get your point about the admin ability and ability to do stuff that would just get griefed/ruined on publicly, though. It's like when people did zombie "mode" in PUBG -- had to be done on private servers and even then people still fucked it up.
---
WOW, put the keyboard away and go take a breathe people.
---
Well, Howard I’m not sure what grounds he could be fired on, seeing as 76 is run by the Bethesda studio in Austin.
---
Now, Hines on the other hand, I’ll give you. The man has really dropped the ball and demonstrated a stunning lack of awareness for someone whose supposed to be in touch with the community.
---
just get another job 4head
---
Not to discourage you but it's not enough. This is the whale model they only need a few payers with loose purse strings everything they design for is about netting those whales and the rest of are just unpaid amusement park interns to entertain the real customers they care about.
---
We can walk away and play other better games from companies that treat us with respect but if you want to see bethesda themselves change you have to do worse than that. As the vetran fallout fans have been telling you all to do from the beginning you have to burn this place to the ground, get regulators involve, shame players, hack, grief, etc... It really is better to walk away but know that again walking away won't be enough if you are somehow still holding out for bethesda to change so when you walk away resolve to let go of bethesda in the process.
---
Looks beautiful in game, I couldn't be happier with it.
---
Y'all are literally out of this world because this same thing is on front page of this sub right now.
---
That's because people agree with "THOSE people". They're voicing their opinions on why they dislike the new payment plan Bethesda put into the game.
---
Posts like OP's are just complaining at people for having an opinion. It's like me, or another unhappy customer posting "People enjoying Fallout 76, uninstall the game right now because I don't like it".
---
We're not asking them to stop enjoying the game, they seem to be doing that themselves. We're asking Bethesda to get their act together.
---
When we start demanding they stop playing the game, sure, posts like this will be warranted.
---
A coffee, toasted sandwich and a piece of delicious cake at my local independent coffee shop is around £13, puts this whole debacle into perspective for me anyway.
---
I don't think it is even about the money anymore, it is just something these people can complain and be outraged about, gives their lives some excitement and an adrenaline rush.
---
Fuck no I won't try it. I ain't going to pay another 60 to get the rest of that bullshit. I already paid 90 to deal with bungie's bullshit at launch. Fuck that noise I'll buy a better game with that 60 instead.
---
I saw a couple folks say it happened to them. I logged in and out of mine a few times yesterday and no issues.
---
Oh, just an outfit then. Ok thanks
---
Yep, same here, paid full price for beta... having a firesale at my Camp vendor... and looking forward to play The Outer Worlds this weekend...
---
This is why they really should be separate character bases, even for unmodded ones, but certainly for moddable servers in the future.
---
Yea do they really think that FO76 is on equal standing with WoW? Or even Netflix for that matter.
---
Because you people, of all people, should know they do not care.
---
Something like that
---
No u
---
Maybe it's the screen shot that looks gash then, Im sure I'll run into someone at some point
---
I've been a subscriber to ESO for years and i figured a similar system would be put into place with 76. Plus those that don't mind or welcome the subscription service are being attacked for their opinions. This doesn't change anyones minds it just makes you double down and defend stuff that shouldn't be defended. For example if they were going to launch paid private worlds they should actually be private and it shouldn't be deleting your stuff.
---
No, because all the placed items in the world are on a counter to respawn that follows your character, not the server. It counts the last X number (the number is known I just forget what it is) of items you picked up and resets the things once they are pushed off the other end of the list. I think it also might reset after a certain number of hours. This means that some people can see items and other people can't because the game has them hidden from them because they haven't reset for them yet.
---
So you can't just keep picking up all the ballistic weave at camp mclintock by server hopping.
---
This was a feature the implements back around patch 9 or so. To prevent people from server hopping for ages to farm areas for materials, clearing out every server for everyone.
---
Most containers still reset when you server hop, same as on public worlds.
---
It's free.
---
Yes. That is odd, I haven't encountered that.
---
Hello bot, I don't care enough to post again! LOL
---
Every time I do the funky mothman I get thumbs down from the other players 😕
---
Big yikes fam
---
Forbes did an article on it this morning and there are several reports, one of which being on the front page of the sub right now.
---
FO universe used to be my favorite, but honestly these days it's a shell of its former self. Everything is so shallow and redundant they are clearly just lazily regurgitating the same format of what they think people liked. All this to say, I'm done with the franchise and I wont miss it much.
---
Yes, I too am thankful for reddit to allow me to know people like you exist. The reaction is first amazement, then a little sadness of the dumbness I did not know existed. Again, thank you. Please let me know when you pay for more useless stuff.
---
&gt;I think Bethesda is reaping what they sowed at this point. They decided to announce a subscription service that currently appears to not work very well right when Obsidian is releasing The Outer Worlds? Who thought that was a good idea? How?
---
Clearly Bethesda is trying to make up to Obsidian for the missed bonus for New Vegas with all this free marketing. They're just misunderstood good guys. /s
---
Duh. Not surprised. They’re going to be getting hate for a while.
---
&gt;if you ask most developers (speaking about the individual, not the company) about their drive for their jobs most would say they want to create a game people would enjoy, over wanting to make a profit. 
---
That is way too broad of a statement.  I'm a lead developer for an organization with 400+ developers, not games but that's not important,  most developers absolutely want to create a product people will use and even like, however they most certainly want to be paid and paid very well. Developers are in high demand  and it's a hard job in the first place. None of them would be willing to take a cut in pay, they'd simply go down the street to MS or Amazon or wherever.  My point being they high skill high cost resources.  You either find enough money to pay them or you get a mass exodus.
---
Edit fixed quote
---
Says "iloveexploits"
---
So you don't like what you describe as greedy business tactics, but only when they interfere with your own? What? Gtfo out of here dude.
---
And many people also couldn’t see it either when many large companies needed cash before their demise. We just don’t know. Based on everything that’s happened and the evidence based on sales along with its reputation things seem to point to the game being in a little trouble rather than Bethesda being super greedy. But like I said we just don’t know so I don’t want to get angry over anything when I don’t know the facts. The dad who didn’t take his kids to Disney land looks like a liar to his neighbors but to his family he looks strong and responsible.
---
I mean assuming they don’t actually have any say in the final development in game changes, only relay information they’re allowed to. I would take a vacation rn. They’ll only get hated on but they can’t do anything to help. Feel bad for them a lot of the time, they just have the shit end of the stick for this game.
---
I will. Be a cuck more.
---
Eh, I'd give it a 7/10 on the scummy scale. It's more personally insulting to the fanbase than anything.
---
Fortnite using social pressure on kids to sell a skin that's just basically an ad for DJ Marshmallow is the current bar, though Gears Of War 5's $20 Terminator skin pack that's just an ad for the new movie isn't far behind. Paying to be an ad! Welcome to 2019!
---
The vast majority of people can afford it - you bragging about that is kinda like winning the special Olympics without a disability. The problem is, because enough dumbasses like you exist who'll buy and eat a $100 tub full of explosive diaherra if it has a Fallout icon on it, Bethesda thinks they can get away with everything up to and include fraud.
---
Do what you want with your money, it's yours - you earned it... either through work or Mom's Allowance. Just don't expect people to not judge you when you spend it like an imbecile on stupid shit and support/encourage this kinda fraud to continue.
---
But is it essential to playing the game? 
---
I’m growing concerned that the exaggeration of the problems caused by things like horse armor gives game companies an excuse to write off criticism.
---
Pretty sure this is from people leaving their own world and then going back into it. We did this last night with one of my buddies who signed up for the subscription. Mobs were dead if we left his world and went back in, it didn’t make a brand new one.
---
on pc. xbox ap in mic. store (beta), connect, follow steps for xbox game pass. profit
---
guys I don’t play the game but I watched some fallout 76 outrage band wagon videos and I have now decided you must uninstall 😎
---
1. Make the Scrapbox free for existing players. Offer it free (to use forever) in the Atomic Shop until 12/1. Maybe that even gets some fence sitters to buy the game now instead of waiting for Wastelanders. After 12/1, it reverts back to only being available for subscribers. This would at least show the bare minimum amount of respect to the players who’ve been here all along and have been told that this sort of thing wasn’t possible. 
---
2. Offer two more subscription options: $X.xx for Private World only and $X.xx for the other FO1st benefits. It should be a better deal to get both, but give people the option to only get what they want. 
---
3. Offer a limited time bundle option for the Ranger Armor and Atoms. Do that every time there’s a new outfit for FO1st. Let it be $12.99 for the Armor and 1650 Atoms, the same as a 1 month sub and quit. Same money, same stuff, less hassle for both sides, no shady tactics to get you to commit. The game hasn’t earned the right to demand financial commitments. 
---
4. Add more features to Private Worlds ASAP. As they stand, they’re pretty sad. Give buyers a real world, that can hold up to 24 players. Give them admin controls—PvP toggles, enemy level toggles, the ability to set the world as private, public or friends only etc.
---
A workbench cannot store a weapon. So I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Why... why lie?
---
Same, final smack in the face I'm fucking done.
---
it is. downloaded this morning
---
Why would i lie about that?
---
I wonder if they are even putting up new hardware for them or just sticking them on the existing architecture because the player numbers must be nowhere close the day 1.
---
I'd rather have a free private server without all the extra swag, though.
---
&gt; I would like to urge all of you to not only quit the game - But uninstall it and vote with your wallet in the future.
---
I agree 100% with all the hate Bethesda get, they deserve to go bankrupt over this as far as I'm concerned, but we can't ask players to stop playing a game they paid for, or uninstall it.
---
Many people ***only*** play Fallout 76, and that's completely fine. We may have our own opinions on how that is, but they're allowed to play and enjoy their game. The same way we're allowed to show our disgust at this recent update for a game we, too, paid for.
---
Once tommorow hits and Outer Worlds releases though - I don't see what this new subscription offers other than 1650 atoms. Most servers will be empty barrens that you'll be able to do whatever you want on, anyway. Why do I say this? Because it's been that way for around 6 months and they've just pissed a good percentage of their playerbase off.
---
Is it out already? I thought it wasn't set for release until the 28th? It's from Obsidian, the original creators of Fallout and Fallout New Vegas. It should be amazing.
---
Well because there are genuinely good things in the game. I personally enjoy the game immensely - maybe because having been brainwashed by World of Warcraft for 15 years has given me permanent brain damage - but that's beside the point.
---
The problem now is that the company seems to REALLY want to piss away all the good will they had left. Base game is still good though. 8€ well spent last november for me...
---
I can't believe how nobody has mentioned that being able to free up space in your stash from the junk you have directly translates into an advantage for some who may be overburdened, who are at the limits and have to use Excavator to fast travel around, which is definitely some number of people because hoarding right? So going from marginally overburdened to being able to sprint, use cavalier armor, etc. rather than being slowed to a crawl when out of AP is the definition of paying to win. Not that I care any more. I'm just getting down to the nitty gritty of it. I don't agree any other item in the Atom Store or 1st has any direct effect on gameplay that affects pvp or the ability to "win", except for unlimited junk, which it clearly does.
---
Stop, you're just proving my point. 
---
I *already saw* both the original BGS posts about the service;
---
The official twitter post: **9,683** comments
---
Facebook official post: **711** comment
---
Please, explain to me how you think these are a majority of anything. Unfortunately, the empirical data from the last two "P2W" events, doesn't support your bias either. Hell, the active player base on XB actually *increased* after the last "P2W" items were introduced.
---
This sub has 200k members, tell me how many **unique** users have made negative posts/comments about this service, because I will bet my ID that it's not even 5% of the subscribers. Tell me again where the majority is.
---
I don't habe plans for any guns. And I didnt think you can craft legendary weapons.
---
How's that scrap box treating you? Everything all right in there?
---
keeping quiet as instructed during a large scale controversy?
---
Do you even know who these guys are? They're not people in suits working at bethesda. They're chosen from the fallout community to act as managers on social media etc.
---
They don't deserve some manchild sending them abuse.
---
Same here. I've put so many hours into the fallouts and elderscrolls that i'm reluctant to think about it 😂 They've got something I can't find in any other game.
---
That's why I care and it has me seriously worried about starfield.
---
For real, they never even pretended to want to make it up to their biggest fans, those who pre-order at full price.
---
Reminds me when everyone was complaining about the scrap bots and fridges and yet I see them at every camp I visit.
---
Probably a mix of both, i'm definitely not a fan of the new system too but i'm not gonna argue because its not gonna do shit for me, bethesda is just gonna stay quiet until it blows over like they always do, only game company i have respect for is CD Projekt Red.
---
Suppose I can't argue with poor financial choices.
---
Obviously they are all commie spies
---
I get it, but players had been asking for it. So they took the idea, gave people the option to play on their own server with or without friends and sell it back to them.
---
Pay for Advantage/pay to skip inconvenience is a slippery slope they design something unecessary to annoy the player like food spoilage then sell a fridge, add item breaking that was not in fallout 4 for example then sell repair kits in the cash shop and so on, latest case is limited junk storage and they sell the solution in the subscription it never ends and only gets worse.

---
you sound poor
---
Why do you think he'd be upset? Should I change it then you think, just in case?
---
Thanks, wasn't sure where it had gotten to.
---
Who? Todd?
---
Lmao of fucking course my post is being downvoted, Probably by hired shills within bethesda, There is no way fans would still defend this garbage.
---
I too came to know the fallout universe via 3. It remains to date the best game I have ever played. NV was different, but familiar enough and eventually I appreciated it. 4 was a different animal and at the time I was ambivalent about it. Now I see it as part of the family compared to this fakery called 76.
---
Things change. Unlike war, because well.....
---
I bought one month now to test the service and canceled my subscription. 
---
If they choose to drop it in price later I might full time subscribe, but so far the world is to empty without other players or things other than daily quests. 
---
Personally I feel they should drop the atoms from the subscription and cut the price down to 5-8 bucks a month.
---
Now if they'd only raise the damn cap limit...
---
Well, it’s not a poor financial choice to me and my financial choices matter only to me.
---
\*waits ages for well timed moment to post clip of the knork from Clone High\*
---
\*is dashed to see it removed from youtube\*
---
" I don't play Fallout76 "
---
yeah, that's where I stopped reading.
---
Unfortunate that you are unhappy, good luck in future games..
---
  Personally, I don't see them as P2W because acquisition, possession, and/or usage of those items is not mandatory in order to reach and complete engame, which is currently accepted as "launch a nuke, kill the queen"
---
  They are conveneince items which give the posessors the "advantage" of not have to scrounge as much for food, or they can repair anywhere rather than carry a backup weapon and switch to it IF the primary weapon breaks.
---
There is still pvp in this game ya know.
---
I been trying to replicate this "bug". Nada, private to public, public to private, public to public, private to private. Nada.
---
I saw what you did there!
---
Bandwagoners for the most part.
---
I’m not in game right now, anyone know if the outfit can be given away to non members? I assume not but they overlook things all the time.
---
You made me chuckle. 
---
Well done, sir/madam, WELL DONE!
---
Oh yeah. If the game was a 10/10 and felt a full next entry in the franchise, sure I could understand this move.
---
I spent 20 bucks on the game, haven't bought any atoms, and I'm having a good time. I'm happy knowing that I will not be putting any more money into the game.
---
Give an inch and they will take a mile
---
That’s because that’s not how workshops work. If you go on, claim and then leave it. It’s only ONLY run for an hour and then stop. Because it’s full.
---
So having them stay active while the player is offline is just a complete waste cause even if they still ran, they’d only run for that single hour and then fill up
---
They stop when consumers stop giving them money.  That just hasn't happen and probably won't any time in the near future.  The consumers are handing them money left and right, to think otherwise is just foolish.  Because they see value in it..  I do.  I give them money to support the game.  Because I like the game and I want to keep playing the game.  Bugs and all.  Private servers that aren't really private.  DLC delays.  All of it.  Sure some of it is frustrating.  And I wish the company would move one way and they move another.  I am all for constructive criticism and everyone to have an opinion.  But there is no critique of the game going on.  It's just people complaining how they feel like Todd owes them something.  That he betrayed them.  But how - why??  I had no illusions of what this game was when it came out in beta a year ago.  I have watched all the same videos of Todd talking about the game.  This is exactly what they said it was going to be.  Then the complaining started, no NPC.  Even though, they said - 'NO PNC's' Every character in the game is a human.  Now, where are we, Wastelanders...  Why because of actual constructive criticism.  And when Wastelanders arrive - I assure you Reddit and YouTube will just be a flood of complaints about how Bethesda lied to them and how it was all their idea and it should be free.
---
Why would I want to imagine it if I just did?
---
Still haven't had that happen to me
---
Any scrap deleted?
---
You're not wrong you've just not boarded the hate train like 90% of this subreddit, unhappy people are a lot louder than happy
---
People like LadyDeann are just employees.  They can't bash their own company on Reddit, even if they fully understand how terrible this is.  So they have little choice other than to remain silent.  I can understand that.
---
It’s paywalling items and features that really should have been/ were expected, to be in the game since day one. Everyone expected private server to be a given, but even if we ignore that, most of these features as of now, either are false advertising or don’t work.
---
Im not saying 1st did anything else but that but i am just saying there is some cause for concern over the future rn its good but speculating on how it all goes from here and im not saying its gunna make it easier for dupers but every patch brings bugs loopholes etc and i just meant new ways finding exploits between switching to and from these private servers stuff like that im not saying 1st is P2W but if its as successful as i think its gunna be for bethesda what is that gunna mean for the future of the game and community
---
The server code is probably 32 bit ;)
---
I’m not knocking people that don’t post and then come when they’re annoyed.  That’s how you feel about it and no one can tell you you’re feelings are wrong. It’s just some of the posts are so way over the top and when you check them out they do the same on other subs. Just takes away a little bit of how genuine people are feeling as they’re obviously just trolling.
---
I don't think you fully understand what my issue is or what free means
---
[https://imgur.com/a/TdrMVms](https://imgur.com/a/TdrMVms)
---
Nothing is illegal, but go ahead and continue your reeee-ing, it's entertaining
---
Same here. When I was playing last night I saw quite a few player camps with the scrap stashes. Despite the rabble here, seems to be popular.
---
If it was an actual private server, sure. But it isn’t
---
I laughed at this, but honestly. I can see them actually doing this. Fallout First members get  access to a NPC that acts like a portable stash . Then get 25% off the DLC
---
Private servers were promised early on with absolute no mention of an attached price let alone one as scummy as the Fallout First subscription
---
I know RIGHT!!
---
Just read the forum.  Literally you will see what people believe is wrong with it and what people see being ok.
---
Of course, who wouldn't. they are dedicated servers still,but itd be nice if we could host one for free
---
I'm on console too. We have to pay for ps+ but we get a half month free trial. Why not with this?
---
That's the spirit!
---
A server by design is normally persistent but that is not what I was refering too.
---
I was refering to the fact that Instances are not servers.... Private worlds is simply Adventure mode with matchmaking turned off its just a tempory instance hosted on the fallout76 server just like any other mode.
---
Yeah destroy is the wrong word
---
You sound like a cuck.
---
I’m still buying “Doom Eternal” if the reviews are good. But I ain’t buying anything else from them unless it’s utterly fantastic, like 85 on both Metacritic and OpenCritic good.
---
Fair play for trying though. I didn't really expect an answer.
---
Hehe.
---
lulz.
---
Why are you booing him, he’s right. A server that anyone can go into without your approval is not a private server.
---
Telling people to stop complaining is literally the worst advice you can give.  You may not have an issue paying money for shit but there are those that do have an issue.  Complaining also is where a lot of devs get their information on (hopefully) improving the game.
---
And then make you pay for the fix.
---
I'd have to agree. I wanted the game harder. With the death of survival mode and now these pass shenanigans it seems like they are making it even easier. I was totally down to pay for a modded server like mine craft so I could add those difficulty mods but that doesn't seem like it's gonna happen anymore.
---
If you thought they would be free you were a willful idiot
---
same
---
Communism detected on American soil.
---
Seriously get a job you angry poor hippy.
---
Smells of bait.
---
Eh, if angry capital G Gamer trolls need something to bash, I guess it's better us than an indie studio, individual, or more vulnerable community. I mean I'd rather there be no bashing but if someone's gotta be a lightning rod we can take it.
---
Dude, are you lonely?
---
Also yes ranger armor is a must get... whatever the cost haha
---
That's the issue for me, I wouldn't mind it closing when I left so much if the world loot, NPC's etc was reset when I joined
---
Its pay 2 win, you get a scrap box, for ALL of your scrap,  private servers have been promised since the beginning private servers since the beginning and NOW they make us pay for it, it also costs more than Xbox gold and Playstation Plus or premium(idk what its called cuz i dont play ps4), those two services for console gamers are already required to pay for if they wanna play online. Thats why people are pissed
---
Are people joining your game to kill you? If so that's kind of a you thing unless they're being a bully, but yeah that's definitely an issue to be addressed. I didnt realize they weren't locked
---
watch it. someone will be long shortly to call you a whale or a cuck, or a cuckwhale or similar.
---
Most of the complainers are the same ones, also they should of seen it coming. I don't support it and it does make me upset, but they never where going to let you do whatever you want to do with it in your own way. Considering some of the mods people have made etc.
---
I'm angry but not making a fucking post about it every ten minutes. It comes down to, you don't have to buy in and it is your choice. People treat it like there is no choice, I don't personnally recommend it, and I won't endorse it, but it is your choice based on the value you get or see from it.
---
You are funny trying to explain a game without even knowing it.
---
Then yell at EA!!! Who fucking abuses the system and feeds gambling addictions and stealing money from 12 year olds. Not Bethesda who like every other mmo or online rpg has a paid subscription
---
Well it's not private and you lose items in that storage so that kinda undermines the deal entirely.
---
Okay 8/10. You're too good of a troll to have actually paid 1 cent beyond the purchase cost of this game. Well played.
---
I actually haven’t paid for the subscription, and I might not even. Also, not a single thing in the subscription is an absolute necessity. Those who can’t afford it are still playing the exact same game. They aren’t being negatively affected by the subscriptions in any way, if they are please tell me how. And I understand that constructive criticism is good for devs to understand what the player base wants. But most of the posts are not constructive, it’s just people whining about features, or claiming that this is the final straw and they are quitting the game, and not supporting Bethesda anymore. 
---
I just think it’s excessive how much this is upsetting people. I think it’s a pretty cool service
---
Use junk to make ammo, sell the ammo, buy god sets of armor and god weapons.
---
Good point.
---
Oh he won’t quit over this lol . He gets paid to eat shit
---
So your concern is that they added a new service / feature to the system rather than fix a bug, and that there are microtransactions in the game?  I am honestly just trying to understand and not trying to be antagonistic here.
---
Actually if you look at Lego and Airbus, they started out relying on trust, banking huge investments in unproven territory, and they massively succeeded.
---
Ah. So how did the launch for those amazing new features go for ya?
---
Also, what content? What content have they created that warrants an obsenely overpriced subscription for? In addition to atom shop money. and game-effecting atom shop money? Oh that's right, they need $13/mo to create new 'features' and content even thought the game has been out for a year and have released pretty much nothing substantial that didn't require entering the atom shop. It's almost like $60 doesn't get you anything! sorry. you get a broken game on a broken game on a 15 year old engine. Totally worth it.
---
So those people who've stuck with the game for the past year expecting updates, fixes, and features... those people don't mean shit b/c Bethesda created a private server feature that isn't even a private server? That's right. It's not even a server. It's just a private play area. Servers are persistent. This isn't what Bethescam is offering.
---
Bethesda can't do shit right, you know it, and you refuse to admit it.
---
Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbYUqqnGK4Y) video then try and tell me you're justified in your defense of Beth.
---
Keep shillin' big guy. Enjoy the utterly broken mess you keep rewarding Bethescam for.
---
EDIT: [Here's](https://youtu.be/WoACRHhbtvE) another. Just watch the first minute. THat's your amazing game and company.
---
EDIT: [Here's](https://youtu.be/dFiNh1OU3K4) a great rundow of the great new "features" that lowly price of Netflix/Hulu/Prime/GamePass/Ea Access/etc gets you! What a steal! You too can pay to lose all your scrap in the new unlimited scrap storage!
---
EDIT: [Check out](http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) the new fallout website that lists everything you get for the low low price of netflix/prime/hulu/gamepass/ea access/literally anything else!
---
The fact that you're so tied to Bethescam that you can't even admit that this game has been nothing but an utter train wreck and Bethescam showing they truly don't care about their players whatsoever, is sad. I don't ever say that with games, because it's a video game. But your staunch defense and excuse of their tactics is truly pitiful.
---
LOL at any story involving Bethesda falling under the categories of "business" or "money."
---
They seem to be really bad at both.
---
lol people really bought the subscription...... well looks like they won again as they continue to bank on consumer's stupidity
---
So sorry, that is similar to the reply i got when i lost the strangler heart power armor 😌
---
Did you hear that loud clapping sound wherever you are just now?
---
That was me face-palming.
---
Getting sloppy seconds players already used.
---
Haven’t lost a single item since I started playing on private yesterday
---
Not surprising, given that this IS Bethesda.
---
It'll reset workshops and such though as well.
---
People who apparently don't understand the respawn mechanics. Expecting every server you join to have an instance with no dead enemies or missing loot defies the spawn timers attached to your character (and the fact you can land on the same server again)
---
Yeah, yeah i'm a troll go back to your basement
---
They are no longer PR managers. They're programmers.
---
I didn’t face any disconnect issues and the game ran smoother than ever. Sorry this happened to you.
---
Private Servers that aren’t really private, as anyone of your friends can join without your approval.
---
Infinite Storage that deletes what you put into it. 
---
Highly Unstable Servers even though they said they would be stable.
---
If everything was working as intended, then I’d be more forgiving. Even though most other online games gives the option for private server for free or at a far lower cost. But the issue is that Bethesda yet again rushed to create a new way of taxing it’s player base instead of fixing already existing issues.
---
Not really.
---
Look at all the endless press around Anthem:  End result?  Dead game.
---
If one person buys the game, checks it out, then refunds it a few days later because the bad press was right, did Bethesda actually gain anything?  
---
If the same event causes a swarm of existing players (who'd periodically purchased microtransactions) to give up on the game and stop purchasing anything, did Bethesda gain anything?
---
And that's just for Fallout 76; it doesn't even approach the possible deleterious effects on their upcoming titles.  They might still sell extremely well, but still be much lower than if Fallout 76 had never existed.
---
The entire Fallout 76 fiasco has been Bethesda blasting themselves in the foot with a shotgun, and a bunch of inexplicable supporters saying "that was smart because everyone is paying attention to them now!".
---
-----------------------------------
---
Bethesda was *already* a beloved game company with droves of fans hanging on their every word.  Have people already forgotten that they just had to show a still image of a Vault Boy doll on their Twitch channel to get endless attention before even announcing Fallout 76?
---
This latest nonsense is the equivalent of if George Carlin cancelled a stand-up special at the height of his career to go to a local playground and eat dogshit to impress 12-year-olds.
---
So is it safe to say you are not the target market here.
---
I never buy atoms and I have a quarter of all camp items, the scrapbot and I buy two repair kits (because ballistic fiber is hard to find).
---
You say "what else" as if you are okay with the lies that have been told so far.
---
I didn't read past that.
---
but it's true.
---
I don’t suspect you know what *sample size* means. You’re never going to have the entire population of the entire game’s base. Almost 10,000 overwhelmingly negative comments on Bethesda’s official twitter post, and that trend continuing for Reddit, FB, and YT, completely beats out any controls for “negative posters tend to post more” that you can come up with.
---
The ratio is SO horrendously skewed from media attention, YT attention, critic attention, comments, likes/dislikes and such. Your rudimentary knowledge of how statistics and data works isn’t my problem nor is it my obligation to have to explain this to you.
---
As for the other P2W items, how asinine is it to use player growth (which is affected by like 1000 variables) as a metric for determining the popularity of two incredibly minor additions to the game? First of all, those additions are available free through some method. Second, they’re incredibly minor compared to “pay us $12.99 a month for content that was anticipated and mostly promised in the base game.” Third, player growth isn’t going to be railroaded by the addition of paid and free repair kits. Hell, player growth for a $60 that became $20 is a *flawed as fuck statistic to look at anyways.*
---
The attention paid is overwhelmingly negative on virtually every forum. It’s so massively skewed in fact that controls for the whole “vocal minority” theory dissipates. The portion of players playing that actually will pay for this is slim, and the portion of those affected by bullshit like bugged out “private” servers (that aren’t actually private servers) and item-eating stash increases are going to lean negatively as well.
---
X
---
Took a dark turn really. I've been chewing through history docs and stuff recently so it was my first port of call.
---
Did they ever reply back to you or compensate you for your loss? Just curious what I should expect here 😭
---
I use a tse handmade and railgun, what I noticed with the numbers is it divides the damage in two. It's not that the extra shot has 25% damage, it's 125% of base / 2 \* multi (crit, sneak). So if one shot misses it really can affect your output because it only hits for 62.5% of the base. The explode goes off twice if they both hit too, that's a really nice boost for demolition stacking (the only reason to have 5 in demo imo). Guns like the 50 cal are horrible with ts because the accuracy is so bad.
---
The shotgun, have to go with what flooping said. I don't really know. I do have an exploding shotgun in my vendor though, might give it a try later.
---
Funny how fully built and optimized games don’t have that problem huh? Maybe they should have looked there instead of atoms.
---
Cool, now we have to pay ten dollars to pay for a ten dollar atom shop bundle to then pay a hundred of those atoms to make a suggestion on what to pay for!
---
I'll be glad when the children get bored of this. It's like when your toddler first learns what the word "poop" means.
---
Right? Private servers are a huge luxury that some games don’t provide at all. I honestly think it’s a cool monthly thing that is a pretty good value for its price.
---
I’ve been in the Halloween mood for a while, giving out free Halloween candy, bubble gums, and dandy boy apples when I can
---
Wow a whole day without a bug. Must be a new record.
---
Right lol
---
Yeah there is always gonna be suckers out there which sucks cause they’re dragging us all down
---
I'd be embarrassed to wear that outfit tbh, might as well placard "I love being fucked by corporate greed and support the proliferation of unethical practices that are ruining the gaming industry" to yourself.
---
r/fo76filthycasuals we enjoy the game, removing this after a bit so trolls don’t take over
---
I may or may not be both.
---
You should be advocating people finishing their games before they release them instead of insisting the game is bad because you weren't suckered into paying 20$ for a fucking paint job for armor you dense, infinitely stupid person.
---
Lol illegal. They’ve never promised you free private servers.
---
$15/$100 to $7.5/$50 Mn/Yr respectively. Make Scrapbox a one time purchase and reduce free atoms to 1000.
---
$70 Max. I will probably end up buying it anyway....
---
 I dunno, I don't care much. My low level has his running, seems OK. My high level is just parading around, he's never even been to his. ;)
---
Yes, charging for some extra features is worse than tacitly supporting dictatorships and suppression of free speech. 🙄
---
You were supposed to bring balance to the gaming industry, not destroy it!
---
Everyone has an opinion and I respect that. But if u wanna do good, then fight EA they r fucking crooks. They feed gambling addictions and steal money from families and exploiting 12 and 13 year olds. Bethesda isn’t doing any of that
---
Rather it be on the hud TBH. Seeing as how action does not pause or even slow down for that matter when going to the quick wheel I’d rather know exactly when I’m gonna get screwed in the middle of a shootout. Maybe sometime next year I’ll see this, if this game is still around.
---
Finally someone who understands how the game has worked since patch 9.
---
The funniest part to me is the number of people who are bitching about a subscription that pay Microsoft and Sony just to be on their gaming networks. These people are the true dumbasses.
---
Why did you pay extra for that? You just showed BSG that they can be as greedy as they want and you will still mindlessly support their bullshit decisions.
---
Long live Gordon Freeman!
---
Report: People actually paid for a sub. 
---
Man people deserve this shit.
---
I will say it again, this game requires strategy and you cant just go running in guns blazing. I died plenty at those levels and I loved the challenge. You can ask others to help you and go with a few others, but I did most everything in this game alone just because that is the way it is......
---
which explains why they have so many bugs...
---
He worked for Arkane Studios freelance after New Vegas, a beth property
---
No complaints about Fallout 76 if nobody plays it.
---
I heavily agree with this.
---
“Content for free”. Haha. You said it. When/where in the world have you purchased something and then gotten more from that company for free? That’s silly thinking. $20-$60 got you the game and all the play time that you get with any other finite game. This is a game that allows for infinite play. And they have continued to update this entire time. Their employees need to be compensated. Their investors need returns. This is capitalism. Your perspective is just selfish and not very thoughtful. Please, stop playing FO76.
---
For the items and things ur getting I would consider $5 a month so that’s $60 a year. (Fun fact) In the Netherlands a one-month subscription costs €15,- which equals $16,6.
---
&gt;Judging by the rest of our conversations in this thread - I'm not surprised.
---
So, what, Bethesda should be a welfare project for your entertainment? Sorry, in the real world corporations exist to make a profit and by doing they employ hundreds of high end professionals who in turn pay taxes and buy from other corporations and so the wheel keeps going around...
---
I am a physics grad student at a very prestigious university. I am pretty sure that's as good as potential jobs go.
---
Well do you know there are wwr pieces? You don't need stash space to horde legendary scrips.
---
As for farming, junk doesn't take up most the space, weapons do.

Ironically, this exchange was with the same user who is the top comment in this thread.  Obviously, there's no real misunderstanding on what P2W actually is here - just a need to circle jerk.  Oh well double downvotes for me!
---
Unrelated:
---
**Reddit User 1:** How is buying a weapon with higher stats paying to win?  It doesn't guarantee I will actually win the game.  It's just more convenient for me than having to farm the weapon.  I'm really just paying for the convenience of the weapon not to "win" the game.   Besides what does it even mean to "win" a video game?  If you win or lose a match it just starts right over again.  Nobody ever really "wins".
---
**Reddit User 2:** Can confirm, bought the best weapon in game and still haven't won.  Definitely not pay to win guys.  Don't believe the trolls.
---
Are you going to finish that thought?
---
Exactly, I'm pretty bummed you don't have your own server but I'm hoping it's just a quick patch because they've mentioned mods and your own rulesets for private servers, they're going to struggle to implement that into what they're currently doing, I'm thinking they've done this so they can get their subscriptions rolling and once the ruleset etc is available it'll be your own server
---
Well, the exclusive items you can only get if you're premium are content tho.
---
The TENT as a second base is not only content, it's a strategical advantage in the game. 
---
The scrapbox unlimited also reveals a blatant lie about the stashes limited space being a technical limit. 
---
But yeah, I've been saying there was an issue since the announcement of the repair kits, but I guess you don't think that's important enough either.
---
I couldn't justify $100 all at once nor a monthly bill. I have a family to support. But I have a working budget that lets me buy video games. I could do $70 but more than that and I'd just have to consider a different game.
---
Most MMOs go for 60 USD a year. Which have a ton more content then this game. With what they are offering as is it at most should be 15-25
---
Its equal parts funny and sad at how desperate some people are to defend their corporate masters. Thats some serious sunk cost fallacy you got there buddy, maybe you should consider speaking to a therapist about getting over loss.
---
It's honestly hard to believe people like OP are real people and not paid PR shills.
---
Well, there's probably worser stuff you could've chosen. What do I know.
---
Yeah anytime.  If you have any other questions let me know.  There are lots of different ways do run the silo.  This is just the way that works for me.  Another tip i do is hitting the vats button as your going even if you don't use vats.  It will show you where the robots and turrents are and you can manually aim to shoot them if you want to.
---
You can't even put up a real in game example for argument, just save it.
---
If you have friends added that you don’t want to play with, remove them as friends
---
Obviously the storage thing is an accident and will be fixed soon
---
The servers just came out, there’s going to be some issues no matter what game you are playing. No devs can catch everything
---
Taxing implies that it’s a necessary payment, rather than a choice you can make.
---
What? No. What does private server mean? It means a server that is private. If a person can come in at any time regardless of if I approve it or not. Then it’s not really a private server. It’s false advertising.
---
If you want a good, although by now highly outdated summary, look at "The fall of 76" by the Internet Historian on youtube. You could believe someone is paying Bethesda for fucking up after watching it.
---
I honestly think that if their plan is to make some money, they'd make more with reasonable prices that more people paid than a price that is way too high that only a small group would pay.
---
Well like they say a sucker is born every minute and that is not me so i guess its safe to say you are correct.
---
That is exactly what I said, for crying out loud... Jesus wept.
---
&gt; And doing it silently, well there's a chance it was for whatever reason, accidental.
---
Take off the rose-colored glasses. Take the red pill. Click your heels together and say "there's no place like home" three times. Whatever it takes. You need to see the world as it _really_ is.
---
Kind of like IRL where the rich get richer and no one cares for everyone under them.
---
&gt;He worked for Arkane Studios freelance after New Vegas, a beth property
---
On Prey if I'm not mistaken
---
Definitely copping the yearly subscription now.
---
The public servers are free, u paid 60.00 a year ago, i dont believe u will win but please waste ur time and energy over 60.00 or just stop playing they dont owe u anything, u weren't smart enough to wait to see how it rolled out had to be first. Show them how angry u are just stop playing if ur on console sell ur copy never buy from them again, thats really the only way to hurt a company dont buy the product.
---
Yes it was so awesome honestly. If I didn't have to work today I woulda pulled an all nighter lol. Not sure why you are getting downvoted.
---
*Curb your enthusiasm theme plays*
---
Well that was the line which was crossed that made me stop playing. It's not that they started selling repair kits, it's that they made changes to items to make them break faster (even with all the perks that "help"), essentially trying to force you into using them. 
---
I cannot prove that they changed the decay mechanics, but I used to be able to play for several hours before needing to repair things. After the launch of repair kits, it seemed like I had to teleport back to camp every 30 minutes to an hour to repair. Again, no actual proof, but that was the thing that made me say "why fucking bother?" and I uninstalled it and haven't come back since. I felt like I had gotten scammed.
---
Not many people will create mods to begin with if they have to pay $100 just to have a server to test them in.  I'm betting Bethesda is only going to allow Creation Club mods.  They're simply going to rebrand "mods"
---
Would you be posting this if IGN uploaded a video saying the opposite?
---
We can only hope...
---
Good thing they aren't real private servers then huh.
---
Funny when I watched the trailer I said to myself I see a little fallout and a lot of borderlands...
---
Upvote
---
This post is a prediction.
---
You dont know what that is, do you?
---
I don't even know how a guy like you that knows nothing feels like you know it all and try to argue with thought up examples against real in game examples.
---
I mean you are diluted if you think that's going to work.
---
Oh I thought you meant ppl trusting the company not corporations trusting their product. I'm sure Beta trusts what it's selling
---
 I have a friend who will probably start soon. He has problems that only infinite junk space can solve. ;)
---
I'm chalking all the negative posts to a large campaign of "influencers" who are astroturfing a grass roots campaign. Tbh kind of reminds me of when Russia meddled in the US election cycle. Possible practice for 2020 elections?
---
But for the current price they’re at?
---
I already pay 50$ a year for plus, i'd have no problem doing it for fallout too if they get their shit together.
---
Edit: crap spelling there to their
---
I love a good salt bath
---
Nah, I completely agree with what you've said. I've defended **and** critisised the game. Pretty balanced. But, because I don't join in people's irrational knee-jeek anger-spurting, I'm apparently a fAnBoY. The fridge stuff was nonsense. The nuka rum stuff was nonsense. Canvas bag was actually false advertising and genuinely bad. The helmet having mold in was awful.
---
And this #CashForStash stuff has me very annoyed. This is one I massively criticise.
---
What do I like?
---
The game is just a nice place to spend time. It's a huge landscape with diverse environments. A ton of locations with different attractions.
---
Camp building is fun IMO. I make different types of camps and do loads of different things with them in different places. I do this a lot.
---
Some events are fun.
---
I like earning atoms for free. We couldn't do that in FO4.
---
All the cool camp items and outfits we can get from the shop with those free atoms.
---
What do I not like?
---
Well the fact people are getting unlimited stash because they paid. That's a massive floating horseshit in the FO76 swimming pool. People are leaving the pool because of that turd.
---
I have to spend 15 minutes of every game hour pissing around with my full stash.
---
Some events are crap.
---
The camp building can be really clunky at times. Saying something wouldn't be accessible. Won't place even though it's green.
---
Server lag. Game stutter (this is huge).
---
No easy 'looking for team' options to team up and do something.
---
I've got 1300 hours out of this game. For £60 or whatever it was. That's insane value if we forget it's a game. It's about £18 to watch a 2 hour film at the cinema. Even if I quit this second it's been a good, if rough, ride overall.
---
Or dont be the Meta and just avoid PvP...
---
The game is, in my opinion, more fun when there is a bit of a challenge to it.  For me, bloodied would take all of the challenge out of the game so I just run a normal high health build with legendary weapons and armour. 
---
Last night I launched a nuke to kill the SBQ.  We had a lot of players and just kept whittling her down while taking out an insane amount of spawns.   We ended up killing her but I'm pretty sure we were just under the wire.  It was a lot of fun.
---
I've been to SBQ fights with bloodied players joining in and she was dead in 5 minutes.  I prefer at actually being a battle than a farming event.   
---
So, I agree with you that bloodied is still overpowered but it's purely optional and you can completely ignore it.
---
If you have people on your friends list that you don’t want to play with, don’t friend them. Simple as that
---
Why are you all down voting this? They're right.
---
Playing Bubsy 3D would indeed be a dramatic improvement over Fallout 76
---
"I have NO CHOICE but to pay"
---
"I can go hungry if it means more Bethesda content"
---
Listen to yourself, nigga.  Get help.
---
This is just another chance for Bethesda to reach out to the community and makes things better......ha ha ha ha ha ha
---
Indeed. $100 is a bit high for what you get at the moment. If rewards for subscribing in the future grants everything back to this point, I guess the price makes since, but that depends on what they add.
---
Only thing I’m upset about is no NCR Flag.
---
I think that one item is a reward for next week's Halloween event.  I have the bundle and it is not in it.  Bethesda is good at showing off other items in bundles not included.  You have to read descriptions really closely.
---
please dont reply to me anymore.
---
Id like some distance.
---
It's not a private server, it's a private session. People are happy to pay for actual servers in other games because they are persistent. First is not offering that. You log off, your friends better be paying up too (jacking up that "server" price immensely) or it fades into nothingness until you come back.
---
That's just crap.
---
We're getting a Halloween event with new decorations and costumes soon though
---
Do you think other players should get the tent and scrap box for free?
---
Yes indeed. I am. ;)
---
I agree the scrap box should be base game. All evidence points to them lying about the inability to integrate it without technical issues and if they have any character they'll own up to it. They can find ways to make money being honest, no need to deceive.
---
So, getting angry over something that hasn't happened by saying it MIGHT HAPPEN.
---
Insanely fucking stupid. You're just shitposting.
---
Look at your post history. You've made 10 posts just TODAY about this shit. Give it a fucking rest.
---
There is no response they can make to this that puts them in a winning situation. I doubt they will address the fanbase in any real way at all. They'll make some sort of public statement that's essentially aimed at investors.
---
Let me stop you right there, you forget about the future of elder scrolls next game.
---
I agree wholeheartedly, if I knew that the Stash / TENT was coming down the line for everyone else following a trial period with their 1st members I'd feel a lot different about it than I do now. Here's hoping they realize how badly they've shot themselves in the foot with this debacle.
---
dont apologize because theyre wrong. in development they used the same engine but then moved to a different one
---
not that it isnt also a crap engine
---
I started playing a bit after House of Wolves but was really dedicated and even managed to get the thorn just before it was nerfed. I played all the rest of D1 and D2, until Forsaken. I was really excited for Forsaken, but also Fallout 76. I figure both were pretty time consuming games and too be honest, Destiny was taking up a lot of my time. So I got 76, andddd, we all know how that went. I then got Forsaken like 3 months after it launched, and I just couldn’t get back into it. I desperately wanted to but I felt like I was too far behind and out of the loop. Even now I feel really nostalgic whenever I see anything Destiny, and really want to play it but just can’t get back to where I was.
---
Ah, some good news. Thanks for letting me know
---
Altman more likely. But yeah devs just do as their told, so yes its shitty and insulting. The crew are doing what they can, with what they are allowed to work with. But most folks keep forgetting its the publisher/management that makes these kind of decisions.
---
Not to bright I see. He means the dumbasses at Bethesda didn't even make it an invite only server so even if he likes the ppl they can join without his permission.
---
Bethesda has always left testing to the players.
---
Your thinking isn’t wrong per se but I think it’s fair to say that an option for making these servers genuinely private with something like say a code/password to join is fairly commonplace with online games that offer private servers at a cost. I can understand the other posters frustration.
---
I have zero confidence that Bethesda is able to collect any sort of metrics at all. Never mind their problems with the game itself, this is the game launcher that re-installed everyone's games on launch day and doesn't even have expected functionality like a friends list.
---
Btw finally you are out of breath, thank god this imbecile leaves the stage.
---
I help old ladies cross roads. They don't like holding my hand every time tho :(
---
So you don't like the game?
---
How do you change your region?
---
That's corporatism for you! Got to make profit to appease your shareholders, squeeze blood from those stones!
---
That doesn't magically make it private server you willfully ignorant moron. Holy shit did you drop out of middle school or something or is it really that hard for your brain to comprehend the fact that they aren't private servers?
---
The lack of actual content for a SIXTY dollar game
---
I still have all my scrap in there no problem.
---
I know what a private server is but I didnt realize they had designed them to pretty much be micro public servers, I just see alot of people complaining that it's a waste and wanted to talk about it
---
I think that the reset is daily, around 11-12 hours
---
How is that lore breaking? 
---
Wasn’t most of the advanced tech stolen from them anyways?
---
I never had this problem stop being ignorant. I’m trying to help others that have had this issue, and you being negative is not helping a situation. Instead of criticizing and demeaning people, who have had something horrible happen to them, maybe you should help spread awareness about this issue, and support others.
---
who said I was angry?
---
&gt; Insanely fucking stupid. You're just shitposting.
---
I think you're projecting. Calm down.
---
They did 'eventually' give everyone a crappy basic backpack, if they did the same here it would at least be 'steps in the right direction'.  
---
EDIT: Although I now realize that all of it was available in game as is, so kind of a bad example I suppose.
---
this... how stupid do you have to be to pay a subscription for a game that is still in the alpha state? Hell most Alpha state games function better than this piece of shit.
---
People that pay for the subscription deserve this
---
Tent I think should be free for every player
---
Scrapbox I think should be in the atoms shop for players that don’t want a reoccurring subscription for all the extra stuff
---
The longer I read that, the more I laughed.  xD This dude perfectly captures our collective frustration, and masterfully translates it into beautiful snark.
---
Whatttt?!? There are still bugs?!?!? Nooooo
---
Fire!
---
That can't true. Someone on this very sub told me he could vote and be part of the majority and that Bethesda would do what he wanted.
---
Hmmm. You may be right.
---
You can't blame someone for selling shit on a platter if there are still people lining up to buy it steaming fresh...
---
I've thrown money at MMOs in the past, but I can't do that with FO76 -- not while there are so many bugs, so many QOL changes that need to be made, and so little new content. Bethesda needs to invest more into the game before I do.
---
So a pet mini Todd Howard is behind a pay wall now!!!
---
Look man I just don’t give a shit, you’ve yet to give me anything to go off of, or tried to explain anything. I’m sorry you’re so upset about it, I hope you can take a nice warm shower and calm down and get over it for fucks sake
---
If it is part of fallout 1st, I’m gonna sure for false advertising
---
&gt;who said I was angry?
---
* 10+ shitposts on this fallout 1st crap in one day alone
---
Did I find YongYea's reddit account??
---
I tried it all out last night when I got home. It's pretty cool
---
That's because half the posts start with "I haven't played since last year, but..."
---
So wait, it doesn't actually give you a private server it just logs you into an existing empty server and locks the door for you?
---
What a fucking joke Bethesda.
---
We usually just invite people we encounter in game, people we trade with and post in Facebook groups. But I do think some sort of in-game connection might be good to implement.
---
are you a Bethesda game programmer
---
* Probably not new: the compass in the nuke silo is oriented incorrectly. If I look north on the map, the compass shows I'm looking west. Also there is a camp icon showing but neither mine or anyone else's camp is anywhere near Bravo. [https://youtu.be/uOOQvyFcR0I](https://youtu.be/uOOQvyFcR0I)
---
* Same silo as above, the launch prep has been stuck at 20% for 10 minutes now and with 3/3 officers. A minute later, launch prep succeeded with still 3/3 officers. I launched an hour earliear from Alpha without issue.
---
Dude not even a month. I snagged it for about 33 dollars on release week lmfao
---
 Bethesda saved Doom. They saved id software and that makes me cut them a huge amount of slack.
---
You bought the sub so now I don't know should I call you a beggar.
---
16x times the monetization￼
---
They remind me of the poeple on facebook that are quiting  but post before they go to get some attention.
---
I'm getting close to that point as well, which is hard to admit as someone who still has CD copies of both Fallout 1 &amp; 2.
---
Eckserah. And thats all they gave.
---
Booo.... Impossible
---
Hype. Doing the same tomorrow
---
"non cosmetic items in the atomic shop"
---
But on a serious note I don't see how 1st is pay to win how is all that extra scrap going to help you win???
---
Seriously how is it p2w???
---
I don't agree with the fo1st shit but come on it's not p2w and it's not dlc and your not being forced to buy it nothing changes if you decide not to use the available not needed overcharged paid service
---
Just because some one comments on a post saying that “I would pay for that” doesn’t mean the developers are justified in locking new mechanics and game systems behind a paywall. Had this game been free to play I don’t think anyone would have an issue with these additions, but in a full price release, if you add something game changing where everyone shares the same world, it needs to be free for all players.
---
I’m sure many players, myself included, paid almost double what new players paid, and now I have nothing to show for supporting the systems that Bethesda told us would fund future updates and content. This isn’t about what a small group of players said they might be willing to pay rwm for, it’s about Bethesda going back on their word after many supported them through the atomic shop.
---
Pete was wrong about the "only cosmetic" comment because he was talking about future plans and that statement locked them into a promise they later walked back on.
---
Free DLC is an interesting one because what constitutes DLC? Technically, every cosmetic in the atomic shop is as much a piece of DLC as their big patches. But if you take it to mean expansions in the traditional sense, they've kept true to this.
---
What do you mean by pet dogs? He said we can have pet dogs? If that's what you mean, then that's true. If you look through my posts you can see I had a pet dog for over a month. I have two videos posted on the FO76 Reddit of me finding them as well.
---
It's a scam when you realize you got scammed. What took so long?
---
No. But I’ve played the game for 600 hours and know how things work lol
---
Because people hate that you can spend money to improve the quality of your life. Those same people also believe they should just get everything for free.
---
Additionally, all of these things are doable in-game without paying. God forbid a business should try to churn a profit somewhere, create jobs, reinvest and expand. That would be good for the economy and we can’t have that!!
---
Same here.
---
All good valid points... it is what it is - a broken game that haven’t been fixed for over a year and countless reintroductions of ‘fixed’ bugs over time.Top that off with clumsy attemps to cover it up with mindnumbingly stupid events like meat week (twice)...  you can cover a turd in gold, but it’s still a turd...
---
&gt;or tried to explain anything.
---
What do I look like your parent? It's not my job to educate you on how to do a basic google search that will answer all your stupid and redundant questions that everyone already understands.
---
It’s just popular right now to hate on Bethesda.
---
I cannot fathom the thought process that lead to this comment
---
The issue is they get deleted completely. Full reset of the workshop, so resources spent on turrets and collectors are wasted
---
The sad part is, people will sill believe in Bethesda and defend them like the blind sycophantic drones they are.
---
I would watch an Internet Historian trilogy about this. Although duology or trilogy, it'll still probably end with "and everyone got fucked over".
---
Xp boosts would be ok with me. After level 50, it’s a pretty even playing field. You could be level 50 or level 500, it doesn’t matter. All SPECIAL caps out and there are damage caps in place for PvP. If you didn’t spec your character right the first time, you can make a new one and have them at level 50 in less than a week with no XP boosts.
---
I am on this Private World yeah, feels good! Immersive, like older Fallouts, it's great!
---
Huh? Beth released a statement about this shitstorm?
---
i dont think people really grasp what is happening here.
---
they created a second higher tier of customer, knowing full well that there will now be free to play (lol $60) and pay to play FO1st players.
---
there is ZERO incentive for them to provide anything at all to the "F2P" lower class.  even though i would image that there will still be token gestures like skins that are just a recolor, that people can possibly buy with play earned atoms. they already have all the money they will get from you, they want you to stop playing and using up server space.
---
They have every incentive to put all of the good features behind the membership.  and making it the most effective way to buy atoms will mean that anyone who wants to actually use the atomic shop as intended will likely need to at least start the trial 1 month subscription (cant wait to see if cancelling fallout first is difficult enough to make it a scam).
---
every single thing that players ave said they want, will be coming out as either a fallout first benefit, or (if we are less unlucky) an atomic shop purchase.   Ammo Press? *exclusive*.  pets? *exclusive*.  camp budget increase? *exclusive*.  mods? *never going to happen, but if they do: exclusive*.  special challenges for OP items? *exclusive*.  machine that produces food? *exclusive*. etc etc etc.
---
I have a sinking suspicion that Wastlanders will actually be released as a "Free DLC" *for fallout first members*, only playable on a private instance.
---
Most of that stuff is always untouched anyway. And plasma cores are stupid easy to craft. It won't make as much as an impact as you think. Plus fusion cores are really easy to get anyway. Idk why anyone would buy some from a merchant/vendor. They're everywhere. Not to mention if you play between the hours of 2am and 6am, nothing is contested. Ammo never was worth much anyway, it's easy as hell to farm steel, lead and plastic.
---
The outcry is mostly over the top but that site  is fucking hilarious. Kudos.
---
Most games offer a private server as part of the standard package, so yes.
---
The Creation Kit's EULA forbids us from taking commissions. If people are doing it, they're doing it illegally and hoping they wont be caught.
---
As long as you and people like you are around to defend them, they will keep doing it. So congrats on being part of the problem.
---
For me personally? It's not about how bad the game is, I played it and I enjoyed it through all of it's flaws and continued to play it through Feb 19 I think. My issue is that instead of taking care of the issues at hand with the game (for example, the infinite gunshot sound effect loop) they keep adding more bugged things into the game and ignored heavily what the community wanted. I know that BGS isn't the only studio to do things like this so I let that slide even, but decided that I was done until server rejoin was an option, or server stability was fixed. But I'll say this, I am glad I stopped when I did, because now they are taking all the feedback since November 2018 and selling it to us for $100 a year and calling it premium. That is some bullshit business practice dude. 
---
I did like Skyrim, and even Fallout 4 although it wasn't my favorite, and hell even had some fun with 76 and Elder Scrolls Online briefly. But even Elder Scrolls Online promised free expansion packs, and now are selling expansion packs called "chapters" to avoid a legal debacle. 
---
I just don't get why you are defending a game studio that clearly doesn't have any respect for customers, fans, and the player base. It's not just "one bad game" but more of "a lot of bad decisions from the start."
---
First it was the pre order thing with the canvas/nylon bag, then it was selling utility in the atom shop, and now this. How long until you get it?
---
That surely still stands, it's not content it's a service
---
Still defending this piece of shit company? Man you deserve to be fucked like this.
---
They are gonna increase prices to 1700 to 2000 atoms so you can't do nothing else than keep buying more atoms.
---
Mark my words.
---
People don’t like the truth.
---
It's actually outdated slang lol. Means lame.
---
Private world does not mean dedicated server.
---
\*nod\*  
---
There was allot more information, that was the cliffnotes version, the more information for the player base the better!
---
I'm not worried.
---
If you're talking about the eventual Steam release, then I think it's in one year, not 6 months. It's available for $1 on Game Pass though.
---
That's a good decision
---
I never got the game. Thank fuck.
---
Well alrighty then.  Thanks for your input.
---
I agree it sucks being told one thing and being handed another, but i have never really followed what they have been saying or promising. Im glad i waited and really have not been subjected to all the things players have been talking about with game play. My experience has been good, so good that i bought my wife a ps4 and got her playing.
---
What kind of gun?
---
who ever runs Bethesda's URL purchasing department must run Joe Bidens as well
---
As someone that hasn’t played in quite a while, have they added anything to the base game for free yet?
---
I would like to hear their spin around this. I really would.
---
Amen brother.
---
“Whatever it takes”
---
or youre buying your own little inventory box on the server
---
it goes hand in hand, you cant trust the company if you cant trust the product they deliver.
---
if he didn't want his credibility ruined he shouldn't have started working at bethesda
---
I felt the same as you when Fallout 76 was released.   There is no way you can defend them after a subscription fee has been introduced
---
It's broken apparently.
---
Deleting items
---
Servers are not private lol
---
After Morrowind they realized they dont have to try super hard to develop a game. Oblivion was the product of that apathy.
---
Wow, Pete Hines sounds like a fantastic person to work for Bethesda. I hope he gets a promotion for his bullshit!
---
You paid for your own suffering.
---
This really is a slap in the face of the entire community. Unfortunately, there will always be idiots that will waste their money.
---
In my eyes, this paves the way to a free to play 76. As someone who wasted the full 60 bucks and played the beta, this feels like a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick in the gut.
---
What a disgrace. What have you done Bethesda.
---
We used to have a fantastic modding community that was able to successfully fix Bethesda's fuck-ups.
---
Not even the most talented modder will be able to fix this monumental mistake you call Fallout 76.
---
The future looks dark for you. You fucked up bad.
---
The "pay 2 win" part I get if you have unlimited scrap space in the scrap box.  Thank you!
---
I didn’t really mean to come off as saying everyone who complains about it is whining, it just that a large amount are. And they need to make money off of the game somehow. 
---
And I’m not trying to say the truth isn’t just that. I know bethesda went back on their word a few times about the atom shop and it’s functionality and all that. I just am not super bothered by it, and it’s hard for me to get why people are literally quitting the game over it. Feels like an overreaction to me
---
Absolutely thats terrible, i lost a good amount of flux also but the vault steel from doing raids will take the longest time to recoup for me. Hopefully with storage no longer an issue flux prices will go down🙏🏻
---
Lol. Bethesda employee. Real original. Get your entitled ass back to work and earn some money. You liberal minded people are pathetic.
---
They said on the site that more bonuses will come and the atomic shop points are monthly. Even if they fall through on the bonuses but keep up with the points it's worth it. I enjoy starting a world where my limited friends list can join and do events how we want and not worry about nearly as much lag.
---
I don't think anyone expected 'Server hosted by bethesda to be free', but rather they hoped that 'You'd run the server on your own dime'. Host it on your own hardware, with your own connection. I don't think that the people who are complaining about the fee wanted Bethesda to be the ones hosting the server. They wanted to run their own at no cost.
---
Ironically the only thing that exists within that hollow skull of yours is a single grain of salt.
---
It's not the Joker lmao
---
Professionally a devils advocate and need to see All sides of an issue, it's habit and to be honest good practice to try and see all the possible angles
---
Thats BS. The masses bought FO4 because of the hype of Fallout 3 and NV. The vast majority of FO4 sales happened as preorders (just like F76).  Some People also quickly bought the game and DLC pass early because of the “higher cost” threat of the season pass sale ending. 
---
It was the hype of the real Fallout Fans that pumped the expectations of FO4 for new players. Without the love of Fallout 1,2 FO3 and NV, there would have been no FO4. 
---
Plus diehard Fallout fans bought multiple copies of the game for different platforms. I did and I know lots of people that did the same. Just you wait and see how well Bethesda’s next RPG sells. I don’t know anyone who would preorder another Bethesda game again. That alone will kill their bottom line soon enough.
---
Now this, this is ridiculous.
---
It's not a DLC though...
---
But nothing in the Atomic shop is actually needed to play the game or complete any of the quests.  It might help to have the field scrapping and repair boxes but I had no problem getting to level 150 wo th hout them.
---
This is why some of us were against these mechanics. They start off small, then get the ball rolling to push the boundaries. Then they nerf the stuff you already bought to release something that will be better then the first mechanic. And they just keep getting more and more money while we get shit on. Fuck Bethesda and Fallout. I’m an Outer Worlds man now
---
“Sample size? Really? The actual numbers don't support your premise, so you just keep sliding it to the side?”
---
Are you saying you don’t know that population statistics *do not actually exist* and that they’re actually hypothetical? Virtually all statistics are based off of samples, because it’s impossible to actually get the opinion of every single person that plays or has played or owns FO76.
---
My assertion was that those who came into contact with the news that Fo76 was implementing this measure, viewed it overwhelmingly as negative. Since I can’t conduct a fucking poll to make my inference because that requires time, money, a staff, I relied on ratios of positive/negative articles, comments, likes/dislikes, videos, and other forms of response. They’re overwhelmingly negative across the board.
---
“Mob activity” implies there’s some sort of unified source, when in reality what you’re seeing is people who own the game engaging in the backlash across all platforms and mediums, and there are far more people upset with the decision than for it responding. 
---
YOUR mistake is a complete absence of knowledge regarding statistics, and a baseless grouping of every negative opinion as “vocal mob
---
minority” despite having absolutely no evidence supporting it and all the evidence pointing to the contrary.
---
And you have the nerve to accuse others of bias. Hilarious.
---
I spend 4$ on coffee everyday, I’m gonna look into island chains up for sale tomorrow and I’m getting my cat golden tipped claws which Will have to be redone every few weeks or so but wtf do I care I’m loaded.

Hail Satan

Now that Survival is gone, I come in here to get my PvP.
---
**The subscription service is the best thing ever!!!!**
---
Ha!
---
That's true but most of these games especially console games are using the player that creates the parties console/bandwidth to host that lobby, it's down to who's resources you are using
---
Get back to work, Bethesbot.
---
Yep, they could have just made all scrap have no weight, instead they try to squeeze more money out of the remaining players pissing them off in the process.
---
I think the expectation arose because people bought a game and it's incomplete.
---
I think they felt they are owed some compensation, and I agree with them. Not that I'd utilize a private server myself irrespective of the cost.
---
But I'm sure as fuck not dropping $189AUD a year for atoms I won't use, armour I don't want or need and frankly, not much else.
---
I think it's less about the cost than the fact that people are sick of being anally dry fucked by Bethesda and charged for it.
---
People didn't think it would be free, they thought it should be. 
---
And it should be if you purchased pre-order, IMO.
---
At this point I'd do the same as Bethesda, I mean look at all the idiots still willing to buy this shit, it's literally free money!
---
And these games that dont cost too much to make are far more rewarding and fun too. Shame...
---
Good to know...
---
Because we enjoy the game.
---
I feel similar to the above review.
---
I don't think they should and I also don't think it gives a edge. It's supposed to be a convenience item and that is what it is.
---
This past year I've been playing and I learnes to never stash more then 100 of each scrap junk. Picking up more if I'm about to cradt certain things recently. It's hard for me to pick up junk unless I have it tagged.
---
I fail to see the edge of the tent due to the fact that at high levels caps mean a lot less. I frequently fast travel around the map to conplete dailies at a chance for rare outfit drops. This just makes it a little bit easier.
---
I think Fallout 1st is a good deal even though it needs some refinement.
---
I also haven't had any scrap loss from what some people are bringing up.
---
Plot twist Bethesda is deaf.
---
Oh it’s that cave! GD! 
---
I was literally about to move back lol.
---
I dunno. What makes you post on a subreddit of a game that you don't even play?
---
No NCR flag.
---
They know that there are morons that are so blindly loyal to Bethesda that they'd toss their money without even thinking
---
That's a good way to think of it... I'm sorry something like this has happened to you twice... thanks for responding... it did make me feel better that you are so optimistic about it
---
This a fo76 sub ?
---
At least ESO's subscription gives you access to a dozen or so content packs that actually make a subscription worth it.  $100 a year to have basic stuff that ought to have just been in the game like private worlds?  I know it's not a 1:1 thing per se, but almost every multiplayer game offers some kind of private match as part of the deal.
---
im with you on this one. too many ppl talking crap on fo76. Don't like it? don't play. Too much hate for fo76
---
At the time he made the “cosmetic only” comment the site for FO76 clearly stated “no items with competitive advantages” would be on the store. Pete flat out contradicted the team’s documentation. 
---
Yeah awhile back after release Pete was being question about the game in the first week. Someone asked if we’d be able to have pet dogs and I forget what exactly he said but he was basically like “well no. I mean, the team hasn’t thought of it. I could talk to them about it. Do you guys want pets? Like Dog? Okay, I’ll tell the team you guys want it. There will be pets soon.” 
---
In terms of DLC they haven’t broken that one yet, but they are walking a very fine line.
---
I doubt they would shove it behind just cause it's been advertised as a free massive update  buuuuttttt I can see the experience if wastelanders being tied to other kind of micro-tansactions such as extra "features" in wastelanders, outfits for followers, special resource machines only wastlanders yadda yadda
---
I'm a level 11 and it was a level 10 .44/ ignore %50 armor with a scope. So I was happy.
---
Well said. I think the folks buying the subscription simply aren't as "vocal" as the ones that want everything to be free...
---
You do know that quoting what Pete Hines said a year ago isn’t a valid argument right? Plus this doesn’t fall into the category of season pass or paid DLC. Nowhere did he mention a subscription service.
---
"Because  . . . . . . shut up" - Bethsida cira 2019
---
Why are you hitting us with an avengers line?
---
Most people (myself included) post before they leave so they don’t get inundated by people going “I sent you ___________ did you get it?” Or “I messaged you about __________’s birthday on Facebook, why didn’t you respond?”  Or better yet, if you full on delete it, the people who start getting mad because they think you blocked them when they can’t find you.  Facebook is too tied in with peoples lives these days to just exit without saying anything, causes legitimate problems.  
---
That said, there’s not really any reason to announce leaving an MMO other than to be dramatic.
---
Sure. Except it’s not a Joker quote. It’s from Harvey Dent before half his face gets turned into burnt lasagna.
---
A few people not everyone
---
Well, if the community wants it...
---
Not anymore
---
i bet theyd just say something about "diehard fans" or something
---
Well I am sorry that I’m using my phone and it sometimes changes it. I’d edit it to please your* but no I’m not going to.
---
Atoms doesn’t cost Bethesda anything. They change a number from 0 to 1600 and that’s it. You paid someone 99.99 for them to press a button and check a check box. The Atom Shop is overpriced, atoms are overpriced and you’re a fool for falling for this. Bethesda is was going down hill but now they’ve fallen off the cliff.
---
Rn it's a shill site for Outerworlds, if you notice they almost all mention Gamepass too lol
---
Followed by “We understand a paid subscription is not what everyone wanted. However some players have been asking us for paid subscription features and these changes are for those people. If you’ll like the current FO76 experience as it is then no changes will occur to your game.”
---
Alright, if that’s what you choose to believe. Obviously you’re not capable of a calm and collected conversation where debating is actually about the facts at hand rather than insulting the other party. I was serious about my other comment, I hope you can relax at some point
---
r/lostredditors
---
Excellent, thanks!
---
What happens to unlimited storage when the subscription ends?
---
There's really no specifically defined final scene; the current "endgame" is launch a nuke and kill the queen."
---
That (and a bunch of other stuff) i available to do now....well, once you get to the level where you have the equipment and skillset to do so, anyway.
---
If you follow the multiple main questlines and don't try to rush to the endgame, tt's going to take you a fairly high number of hours to get to that point; depending on how much time you can devote to playing, it may well be next year before you get to that point. (it took me about 3 months to make Level 50)  IIRC my hours played, current cost is 5 $US/month, or about 9 cents per hour played.)
---
So for you, 12$ USD ...for 3 (or more) months of play .... Not a bad return.
---
Nope i aint touching anything but doom and es6 and when they come out im telling bgs to fuck them selvs with a coke can
---
Scavlife, amirite?
---
Yes I’m a member, maybe I need to just stay in there.
---
Bethesda makes music! Todd is an amazing singer. https://youtu.be/Xr9Oubxw1gA
---
I guess it makes sense that after a while some people could get tired of it. But even through it all, I still have so much fun playing this game. It’s just hard to believe that some people can’t deal with it, and are so upset about it
---
Probably true, but Todd Howard is the game director, im sure he had a say in it though. It seems him and Pete are hand in hand about this game.
---
If that was the at the airport, then yes. I played with some ramdom person for the first time so I may not have been paying attention. At the same time we completed it, some giant sky beast came down at us and we ran like hell. I signed off shortly after that. The only thing that confused me was I couldnt access it my pipboy inventory (glitch maybe) only the bench.
---
I care about ANYBODY being spell-checked, as it just seems... petty. It just seems spell-checkers are more interested in spelling/grammar/punctuation than the actual spirit of the post...
---
"I care about his post history"? WTH is that coming from, as it was the other guy who went to "AZ"s post history looking for (I imagine) "gotcha" posts?
---
And if he plays on PC, I'd like to meet another First subscriber...
---
Now we know how it has unlimited storage...
---
Please do something about all the people spreading hatred and veiled violence towards those of us who chose to stay with the game and opt to pay the subscription.
---
If this was the streets of a major city, the cops would be out in force with tear gas.
---
I agree.  Regulate your sub or shut it down.
---
This statement isn't as deep as people think it is.
---
"Either you're a good guy forever or you're not." That's literally it. If you think about the statement for more than 10 seconds, it's kind of nothing. You can die a hero in a great sacrifice or on your deathbed at 99... or change along that route.
---
It's just structured in a way that makes it sound deep.
---
The people who are making these negative posts don't care, they don't even play the game they're just coming here from other places to post-bomb the subreddit because they know Bethesda listens to this subreddit
---
Someones maaaaaad
---
Preach it. Im thinking about high tailing it to the casual sub too. With every update this sub turns into a bunch whiney children. I get that they're upset, but they love escalating everything to crazy proportions.
---
It’s optional and comes with private 7 person servers, unlimited junk storage, this new camp site which can be placed (it’s like a mini pre made camp), 1,600 atoms every month and I think a skin. Except it’s $100 a year
---
Could mean Hybrid Hard Drive.
---
Oh shit I checked your post history and you play Anthem. I'm sorry I'm so sorry. You've been through a lot.
---
What makes you want to play Anthem tho?
---
It’s less about the private server and more the scrap box and survival tents. I can see a separate monthly pay for just these servers
---
Simply incorrect.  The Todd made F76.  He's billed as the game's lead director.  He's done interviews about MAKING the game.  Same with the rest of BGS Maryland's senior staff like Emil Pagliarulo and Nate Purkeypile: these are names you'll see popping up on several previous BGS MD games. And they are all on the credits for F76.  Not as supervisors rubber stamping shit, but as project leads. Why? Because BGS Maryland made F76.
---
Austin just did coding work.  They (further) jury rigged BGS MD's old engine into accepting multiplayer.  They *took over* development of F76 *after* it launched.  They did NOT make F76.  BGS Maryland made F76. BGS MD also retains creative control of F76 to this day.  BGS Austin are more like stewards for F76.  Why? Because it's a BGS MD game.
---
You can blame executive meddling from the higher ups at Zenimax if you want, but this scapegoating of BGS Austin to absolve The Todd (and Friends!) from F76 is simply a delusion to maintain hope for future BGS MD games.  You can still have hope for Starfield and ES6, but go into them knowing it was made by the same people behind F76.
---
The worst thing is the server shuts down as soon as the last person with a FO1st subscription leaves.
---
Get them, perhaps? There are a LOT of angry people on the internet...
---
But they went against their own word doesn't matter how long ago it was really. In my opinion on this subject, the game as it is now (and definitely not at release) was not a £50 title and I'd say even with private servers being free as well, probably still not worth the money it was originally sold for, and nothing has been done to oppease the people who spent their money on an unfinished game that stilll hasn't been fixed to the quality it should've been at launch. This Fallout 1st bullshit just rubs even more salt into the wounds.
---
...Now why did you do that?
---
This is what we call in the industry a 'Bait and Switch.'
---
Man, y'all got to hold it together for Northern America.... Cause I don't know if USA itself is going to recover anytime soon. We are all counting on you! :P
---
Lmao I am avidly aware of the differences and that is why I pointed out why your defense of them is laughable. And now you are just using semantics to distract from your horrid points. We all know what I mean by multi billion dollar company. Quit defending a company for fucking you over, snap pout of it man. I was a Bethesda Stan my whole life, they were literally my favorite company and I've been defending 76 for a year but this is getting out of hand, period.
---
i mean your buying the memory on beths servers public or not, as far as are they in the right to change theyre plans no, they should grandfather current users and release a new fo76 with subscription
---
PR managers fix games?
---
Naa, it’d be much higher....
---
I don’t have time to play more then one game and i play fo76 almost everyday for an hour or two, it costs me one pizza per month and improves my gaming experience greatly. I don’t know if costs is made up but value is definitely there for me it’s around 25 pizzas (calculation is simple as i can enjoy one pizza for about an hour plus caloric value doesn’t matter as I’m overweight anyway).
---
Fuck, i'd be extremely happy this month if i didn't already own the Last of Us.
---
A guy just called me a moron because i bought Fallout 1st lol. Mods really need to do something. This sub became a very toxic place.
---
"Whatever it takes"
---
Yeah, I got zero sympathy for anyone dumb enough to pay for this rot. You get what you deserve, sorry.
---
Did it yesterday, as soon as I read the announcement.
---
Not at all, didn't spent a dime on this pile of cashgrab.
---
Bethesda is gonna take the top spot from EA, EA will be saved by Jedi Fallen Order. The one thats lurking and might be the sleeper is Ubisoft, they are catching up with EA and Bethesda.
---
Gotcha. Sorry. Didn't mean to be an ass. I didn't know what you meant!
---
I support Bethesdas right to so what they want with their games in a free market. They dont have a right to our business and we dont have a right to control their company. If they turn into a crap company that's all them, we can just leave.
---
It may surprise you to hear that community reps have little to do with the decisions that get made and also aren't in a position to make such statements on behalf of the company that don't come from the heads of the company itself. Also considering the amount of shit and actual death threats they receive over a video game I wouldn't call it easy.
---
I made a post complaining about how people are complaining so much, and there’s some decently upset people to say the least. I just don’t get why people are so mad
---
It's hilarious so many people were downvoted into Oblivion for saying anything negative at all when FO76 launched and now every post is criticizing Bethesda and gets upvoted. You all are making Nintendo fans look stable.
---
Buy one month and spend it amassing an ungodly junk stash, then I'd the price hasn't dropped on the year but the full year.
---
They introduced an overpriced private server subscription and everyone is blowing it out of proportion and losing their minds...
---
So typical Internet stuff
---
If you like 76 just keep playing and ignore the people crying about something they don't have to buy
---
Hold up, you build near the Camden Park Parking lot now?
---
Paraphrasing does not require quotation marks.
---
You are still miss quoting.
---
Edit: I’m starting to believe that you may be one of the people who bought the membership, and you may indeed have the aforementioned issue.
---
This post being downvoted perfectly represents the baffling reality that some tools in this community would go likely as far as buying a literal turd from Bethesda and thank them for it too.
---
Of course, it's a horible statement from a pr point of view. It was just meant in jest, but could imply that they have paid other guys. (in a sense like "We didn't even pay THIS guy, but we have paid others"). Sooner or later this gets brought up again when some youtuber is being accused to be a shill for Microsoft or whatever.
---
Thats the problem with twitter, you think of something funny and send it out into the world without really thinking about it.
---
To be clear, that's rear in the hostility, not valid opinions about the state of the game/company.
---
I can assure you they don't give a fuck. It's a 9-5 for them, coding is like laying bricks, then you punch out and go back to your family.
---
I play the game daily. not everyone criticizing Bethesda's stupid decisions is a disinfo agent.
---
some of us genuinely care about the game and don't want to see it going the mobile route.
---
I choose to be neither and quit the game
---
I think he should refer to his “friends” as people he met...
---
Who said I ever wanted a server? I was hoping they’d offer local play. Offline mode.
---
*gasp*
---
Bethesda lied about something related to Fallout 76?
---
Oh, lordy lordy lordy, what have we come to.
---
&gt; Hybrid Hard Drive
---
SSHD
---
I'm going to guess plenty of people bought the game joined the sub and then proceeded to stop giving a fuck after a little while because of the many reasons there are to go play something that does'nt fuck up half as bad a fallout 76 does.
---
Also, drama tends to bring back people who otherwise would not have given the game a second thought even if they are only coming back to point out that this latest fuck-up made them decide to write off fallout/bethsida for good.
---
Oof, who's spreading veild violence again?
---
yikes... last election just shown how divided we were around the country... i'm afraid North America is doomed ;)
---
So... It's exactly the same as adventure... Why the eff?? ... You know what? Never mind. I give up.
---
I might have bought this Fallout First when the game first came out but now that window is gone.  The Outer Worlds, Death Stranding, and Fallen Order will keep me busy for some time to come.
---
Is it even real armor, or just a cosmetic that looks like armor?
---
Nah, did it directly threw Microsoft, it gives you the option for a refund when you cancel the sub
---
No, not crowned. I know what is legendary enemy.
---
In last two weeks i was doing that event 3-4 times and every run got 3 1* legendary wolf
---
so I think in the end- if FO76 had the depth of content like ESO this would totally make sense. 
---
Not only is there an uproar from all of Bethesda’s failures that everyone will keep mentioning over and over on here but what I think doesn’t get touched on enough is more of the gamer community being tired of developers thinking they can release a game at full sale price and build on it over time. Just because it inevitably worked with ESO doesn’t mean it’s a acceptable approach for future games.  Between FO76, No Mans Sky, Anthem, Destiny, etc I think everyone’s patience has been stretched thin with this tactic and maybe FO76 was a focal breaking point for a lot of gamers.
---
Edited some typos sorry for brutal read
---
Okay... not sure what you think my hidden agenda is but okay.
---
yes, im still excited about that, i only wish we would have more time to enjoy them as it starts so close to halloween, after halloween is over, not as much fun in those decorations....
---
We break ground this weekend.
---
But if it's a hosted private server (which is what it seems people are really paying for in terms of cost) then there are fundamental infrastructure costs that are part of that (the server, the bandwidth, etc.) .  If someone really wants to play on a private server (honestly I don't see the attraction, well, except for when dealing with griefers) then they have to pay to support that infrastructure.  
---
Microtransactions that allow me to change the paint job on my armor or add a silly Liberty Prime voice are just affectations.  The game altering ones (scrap kits / repair kits) are a concern, but there is a trade off there too (each kit is 1 weight unit if I recall correctly).
---
I deleted Facebook 3yrs ago and never regretted it.
---
People need to let go of the P2W thing. That’s not the problem with 76 and it never has been. It’s not about advantages, that’s a cop out. It’s about building inconvenience into the game specifically to be able to sell you a “Convenience” item to get around it. It’s 100% unethical and should be condemned. 
---
They did it first with repair and scrap kits. Blatant examples of creating a problem and selling a solution. Then they put out the fridge and the Collectron—both of which I still argue are novelties as they don’t significantly affect the gameplay loop at all—but they flirted with this sort of thing. 
---
Now with FO1st, it’s the Scrapbox. The only reason it exists is because the developers built in a Storage limitation on those items. Scrap could absolutely be unlimited for every single player, but they chose not to do that and are selling a solution instead. 
---
Imagine if you bought a new phone and the manufacturer built it with software that made you do 10 extra steps before you could do things like send messages, browse the web or open apps. Sure, you can make phone calls with one tap, but everything else requires you to jump through hoops.
---
Now imagine that manufacturer put out a new monthly or annual subscription you could sign up for that would make all those other features work as easily as making a phone call did. 
---
No consumer would tolerate that from any other business, but it’s what game developers are doing every single day. It’s shameful, it’s unethical, and it shouldn’t be tolerated.
---
It’s one of the most hypocritical things i have read in a while....
---
once it launched i felt so bad for that WV tourism dept that went all in on the game
---
You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
Why do I do it?  [I'll tell you why I do it](https://youtu.be/LrJP_tkRf3U?t=105).
---
You're a moron.
---
Edgy is a tired meme.
---
I was expecting this to be something like 'I am'
---
Sort by NEW and you will see all the paid PR shills trying to save face for daddy Howard
---
... So since they took survival down? What an odd coincidence! :D
---
This sub teaches me I’m either rich for paying for FO1st or I’m poor because I can’t.
---
I mean you don't have to take it then it's just an additional service, but it's a good point I was looking at it as I wanted a private server anyway there rest is a nice extra, if you just want a bigger stash its not so great
---
All I have to say is LOL
---
lol, DOOMED!
---
Giving you upvotes to counter whatever troll be lurking around :P

Forbes gaming articles generally suck, mostly being something I expect to see on a blog.  I would not be touting them as anything special.
---
Yeah just scammed you out of your time cause obviously you have nothing else better to do than to be salty about a game you don’t even have.
---
But they don't know the ins and outs of their engine
---
Current contract dictates I say Hail Satan or things will catch fire.. namely me
---
So are you saying I can pay 12.99 a month to experience even more game breaking bugs? Well hot damn! Sign me up! /s
---
It did get shat on because you had to buy the game and pay for the subscription but they then changed that to make the subscription optional and ESO is an actual good game after the work they put in to fix it and support it unlike FO76 but even ESO wasn’t in as bad of a state as FO76 at launch
---
I never said it was deep. I don't know why everyone's taking it so seriously. 
---
It's applicable to this situation. Bethesda used to be seen as a good guy developer, but they've been around long enough that they're vilified now. That's all there is to it.
---
You should be glad, now you can play more to get all that stuff back! You get pride and accomplishment for being a whale that ruins games. Thanks to people like you publishers and developers make more money by making their games shittier.
---
They’re certainly not in best condition to release something of this nature without a stable game or sufficient content to convince people to pay for the service.
---
If Todd Howard executed an orphan on live stream people like you would still crawl out of the woods to defend him. It's honestly pathetic and sad how desperate you people are to not only participate in business that negatively effects the industry, but actively defend said business that has objectively effected everyone in a negative way. All just to satisfy your addiction to instant gratification no less.
---
On point.
---
I wonder though if nobody at Beth Softworks is thinking about the harm they do for future releases. If they announce Starfield and TES VI with an online component (and they will because thats how it goes now) I would imagine a lot of the gaming community will be very cautious about pre-orders or day 1 purchases. 
---
Sure, we are just a small part of the customer base, but I imagine it will hurt financially nonetheless when you have to put up the immense costs of producing a AAA title and want investment back.
---
Would love to see just how many people play fallout 76
---
But sadly all we get told is that "millions play it"
---
Do i have to be if I bought it and never played it again? I put money in to this game.
---
They said there would be cosmetic item only microtrabsactions, no season pass, no DLC, everything is free. Well…as it turns out…it’s the opposite. This subscription is all of those combined.
---
This^
---
I would literally never pay for this content. How is it people like me “making it possible”? I’ve stated that I enjoy the game the way it is and don’t need to buy any more additional content. The people supporting this are the ones willing to actually pay for the content. I’m simply pointing out the fact that I’ve been paying the same price for video games at launch for 15 years or more and if we aren’t as a gaming community willing to pay more at launch for a more complete product, this will keep happening.
---
I play because it helps me relax and takes my mind off RL issues for a little while, basically the same reason I play any game regardless of how popular or not is it.
---
No, this has been a series of poor decisions on their part that made me lose all faith in their ability to deliver a good game.
---
Hahahahahaha. 
---
The community wants something...... Which means it should be offered free? 
---
Full on entitled hilariousness.
---
You can enjoy a game, while still criticizing it, people. You don’t need to defend it if you enjoy it.
---
Man, maybe I shouldn’t let people know that I don’t even want the coat part of the outfit. I paid for a month of the subscription just for the Ranger helmet.
---
I mean, you’re right, I don’t have to subscribe. But I left the game less than a month after launch  with the intention of coming back when it had private games and mods.
---
Now I see that’s never going to happen without an additional subscription, which is disappointing. Guess I’ll just have to wait for Fallout 5.
---
Does this bag of dicks come in a canvas or nylon bag?
---
This is one of the only productive posts I've seen since the patch notes dropped. Upvote for you and I hope Bethesda sees this.
---
I was just correcting you, not being rude. Grammar is important.
---
I wonder who did the yearly sub?
---
Sorry not sorry that I work hard in my career and it has afforded me luxuries such as private FO76 sessions with friends and energy drinks. 😄 
---
Get on my level people 🤣 Make better life choices and stop feeling entitled. The world isn't fair. Video games are a business and they aren't here for you personally. They have always just wanted your money. Developers don't make games to make you happy. 
---
If you don't like gaming businesses making money then just stop playing games. We all feed the machine. We created the monsters that we give our cash too. Do not blame them, blame us. 😁🤗....now back to my life of luxury. You minions have taken up enough of my time......lol
---
People like you shouldn't be allowed to use money. You should have guardians that handle your money. I wouldn't normally care, but the way you ~~spend~~ waste money is making games worse and ruining gaming for the rest of us, so therefore I do care.
---
That was that guy's only comment in this thread, stupid.
---
I’m sorry to hear that you’re getting all of those glitches. I seem to be pretty lucky not experiencing many, and that may be a factor in why I’m not so jived up. And I agree that Bethesda has been somewhat lackluster in their ability to fix some aspects of the game, but I’m just not affected by it really. The game runs perfectly fine for me 90% of the time
---
We were downvoted and told to shut up because it wasn’t going to happen and now here we are. The Snowball Effect ladies and gentleman. Look it up and while you’re at it, uninstall Fallout 76
---
Kinda misleading logic there. It's not fun to just hate Bethesda, Bethesda has actively earned that hate by making promises they can't deliver and selling broken features for an exorbiant extra cost to its most loyal fanbase, a mere week after SPECIFICALLY outing them as the reason for putting various new gameplay-enhancing features behind microtransactions.
---
They've probably got too shitty coding so it maxes out
---
Creep
---
I didn't say you said it was deep.
---
But here's what I am saying about statement: It means nothing. It is saying nothing. It's like saying you either die young or live long enough to see yourself become old.
---
 There was an actual economy in ESO. I was a fairly big part of it at one time. Then the Crown Store showed up and started competing with me. After trying to keep it going, I gave up and the actual player economy is mostly destroyed.
---
It's possible those people got the one month sub, took all items and atoms, and then refunded their purchase in the 30 day time period. Beating Bethesda at their own scam lol
---
I actually think it’s a pretty cool service. Can’t wait for this all to boil down
---
At the end of the day they’re a business and their number one goal is to make money. How they choose to do that is a different question. You can be like Obsidian or CDPR and do it through fan loyalty and being good developers towards your consumers which Bethesda used to be although over the past several years I feel that Zenimax is trying to squeeze more and more money out of its biggest cash cow which over time has tanked Bethesda’s public perception.
---
Name checks out
---
Yeah, for that type of mod to be feasible, the server would need to distribute them to clients as packages that can be switched on and off. This also creates the issue though where you're either storing assets (which can get quite large) from all the different servers you've played on or you're constantly re-downloading them.
---
I'm not going to shit on you too hard because I was gargling bethesda's balls too up until Fallout 1st....but come on man, don't buy this shit.
---
Your supposed to put a /s at the end of that.
---
The benefits are meh. Unlimited junk storage? Lol. The only bonus is it'll free up a tiny bit of stash space.
---
And a free fast travel spot? Meh
---
I bought it through the Windows store.
---
Make a new character do all the big 40 atom challenges quick enough and you can buy every atom shop item if you're running 6 characters since launch anand doing every weekly and daily as well.
---
I hate on sports games a lot too, but they are what they are.  
---
FO76 has gone back on promises and has been a complete clown show since day one. I defended it in the beginning, and I thought I was getting my money out of it. But then I realized I was only playing, or actively searching, for that one glint of light to rationalize buying that trash of a game. Subconsciously telling myself, no way is Bethesda this shitty, I'm missing something.
---
I really wouldn't bother holding out hope it'll make it to easy for beth to play lip service and immediately burn you again
---
Not everything for free, no. But they could stick to their word and keep *only cosmetic items* behind a paywall.
---
I couldn’t give less for Todd Howard but at some point the sub has to see both sides. There are far more people harping on the same issues and not assessing why they could be happening. People who defend the game don’t usually call out Bethesda as well
---
The server shuts down if at least one person doesn't have Fallout 1st. I think you also misunderstand the scaling capacity of things like AWS which were built to perform these exact tasks.
---
Charging for mods never ends well.
---
There is no difference between Bethesda and ZeniMax. ZeniMax is a holding company. It was created by Bethesda Softworks’ founders in 1999 for accounting/investment purposes. It’s a highly common practice. They are the same entity for all practical purposes.
---
You know that the private servers will go into limbo when the one creating them leaves and disc all other on it, right?
---
heading North to the Wall
---
They’ll just crash your game and open up a slot.
---
The counter to this would be just to do more double XP weekends, say, once a month. As of right now we haven’t had one in over a month. I don’t expect another till at least the one year anniversary of release day.
---
r u an professional troll¿
---
All your observation means it's that some people are still eating out of Bethesdas litterbox. Have you considered that a lot of the player base has been angered to the point of *not* playing?
---
I'm sorry. I do not cover any lies. 
---
I have some Fallout friends. All they are talking about are old duping methods. Some of the are back in them game after Patch 14. 
---
Bethesda didn't tested this patch. I'm sure about that.
---
Once they run out of servers in either case ot wont crash anything. It'll most likely just say "world not found"
---
What would I gain from this, besides being an inconvenience to others, assuming I had enough friends to fill up every server.
---
Imagine paying for it and it deletes your save data
---
I've only gotten pissed with glitches maybe twice.  Most don't bother me either, if I even noticed them.  I enjoy the game a lot and while I understand the discourse towards it, I dont let it bother my game play.
---
I'm generally pretty docile with discussions, I dont see a point it getting pissed about words typed over the internet lol.  But I will play devils advocate a lot when some topics are brought up.  I see the need for outrage but some times it can get to the point where after 1000 posts of it, it all sounds the same.
---
Community does not blame anyone. Communjty is just fucking angry about the situation and do not want this shitty sub in this game, especialy for such a price. Imo, of course.
---
Popular games = bad 
---
That's why I only play minecraft
---
I don't think that considering BSW Austin is the ones doing most of the work I think they are just making bad choices with the priceing of...well everything
---
But I do think they want the game to succeed
---
And despite what you may call a flop if they made more money then it cost to make its not and I fully believe 76 has made a profit
---
Pete Hines went MIA Literally a Week after Launch i don't think he's been back since.
---
I liked the part where you thought you had an original idea.
---
I don’t really see how the crown store would affect the ingame economy up until this year when they allowed for crown store gifting which could be used to gain massive amounts of gold very quickly provides you’re well off financially. Ingame motif prices are a fraction of the cost of the crown store alternative which can be almost £20 in some cases.
---
Honestly, it’s a real improvement, west tek especially, but I’ve had 2 legendary scorch beats also, definitely not a coincidence!
---
\&gt; No Multiplayer
---
No thanks, I want to play with Family and friends.
---
Cool that it’s out, but this is not the sub for outer worlds stuff
---
Well it's still in beta
---
Thanks, got any tips that i should know? i've played every fallout game since 3 but i already know fo76 is quite a bit different.
---
Conan Exiles has a deal where you can make a co-op server that isn't online. you can invite friends and control the options. It would be cool if they did it like that.
---
\&gt;unless they really are THAT dumb
---
Hanlon's razor - never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. 
---
Seriously though, stupidity, hubris and monumental greed explain this perfectly.
---
They better take the hint and at least make the private servers free
---
It's single player, no thanks.
---
Because despite the way people are acting, not having fallout first does not make the game any different than 3 days ago
---
Prove they didn’t test it at all. I’ll wait for those development schedules you have access to.
---
I'm only sad that the server doesn't stay up for others (friends) to join and contribute to, while I am offline. I want a persistent server that we can all build upon, and when logging in, will have maybe something new to see due to friends being able to still play and add to it. 
---
If I'm going to pay a monthly fee for a server, it needs to be constant and always accessible, not only when I'm online.
---
Sorry, but you are in no way entitled to freely mod BGS' intellectual property.
---
Console or PC?
---
See I think you're doing it again. Trying to use semantics. Will it make me better at the game? No. Me with it is in a better state than me without it. Me with it has advantages that me without it doesn't have.
---
That is literally fact.
---
Funny, seems like her job is to eat shit when her company fucks up. Almost like "PR" is a scummy job that no one should be doing for any money, because it is inherently dishonest putting a smiling spin face on every "sub-optimal" situation.
---
She gets paid to eat shit. Fill her up boys.
---
It depends on your game edition. If you picked Fallout 1st, it comes in a trash bag.
---
jeez man, calm down, no need to swear so much! do you work for Bethesda or something?
---
THAT’S THE JOKE
---
   All I can give is anecdotal. It's not like when it happened I was expecting that specific bug and was recording. I can say that I definitely lost every bit of scrap I put into my scrap box.
---
It blows my mind that people are somehow defending fallout first. I seriously can't comprehend it.
---
Oof. Check out my comment history sometime dude :)
---
Thank you for showing me what it means to be truly brave.
---
Get off your high horse. [Angry squeaky voice ] "Oh gosh people who choose to spend their money on something they enjoy differently than myself sure are stupid!"
---
Bro, rufund your purchase through the manage your subscription option, you still get to keep all the scam stuff
---
Cosmetic
---
Well, I am salty, I like to have NPCs in a Fallout game, that's for sure, I thought the update was right around the corner. It feels pretty empty to me rn.  Don't know for how long it's going to hook me in but don't think it'll be a year or even 6 months with that treatment from Bethesda.
---
And if you enjoy the game then that's cool, but I know I would never spend 60$ on this.
---
If you're buying atoms frequently then the subscription is actually the best atom value you can get... the year subscription would give you 19,800 atoms.
---
&gt;I'm a working professional and make a decent living, so I went to checkout, and my final price was \~$200 CAD for the year
---
Where do you live because I live in the poorest/highest taxed province in Canada and my final price isn't anywhere near that? It's $129.99 for me.
---
If you are on xbox, set your location to new Zealand and you can play now!
---
Fallout 76 is new do u really want to replay how ESO was in bata and how vet was.
---
60 dollars was an incredible deal for the amount of entertainment this game provided my wife and I. Call it beta or not, hundreds of hours over the last year, would do it again.
---
I think correcting someone on their grammar is rude too.
---
&gt;No multiplayer
---
One of the idiots that somehow thought they'd ever be able to play 76 singleplayer
---
O. K.
---
I think you mean... HAIL SITHIS
---
Ahh gotcha. I recommend the Uranium Fever event. 3 guaranteed legendary enemies, and plenty of other players show up to make the fights easy. Just be sure to be quick enough to get a shot in to tag the enemies.
---
Bare minimum is generous, I'm expecting them to actively suppress non-subs to the point the game's outright unplayable.
---
"Permission denied"
---
The tent is also SEPARATE from your camp. You can have BOTH up and out at the same time, though not in the same place. 
---
Also, you cannot build anything besides the camp at the camp's location. Still, super nice as a forward outpost, or quick recharge station.
---
How is it not free? You're not being charged to play the actual gane. I'll admit I too am pissed about the sub, but the game is still free said from purchase.
---
I was going off there most recent debacle of GRBreakpoint but yeah i am holding out hope for Watchdogs 3 and Beyond Good and Evil2.
---
I've never spent any of my atoms (just not my thing) and I've collected hundreds of repair kits. Literally anyone can get them.
---
Don't drag my boy into this
---
It started today.
---
What's interesting about that photo is that I don't have the 0/0 weight used/capacity indicator on my scrap box.  What platform are you on?
---
You’re entitled to that opinion, I like it though
---
Probably has awful blood pressure
---
Pretty sure the game will continue to be supported, if this astroturf campaign didn't work at release it won't now lol
---
My only regret.... I didn’t think of this first
---
\*Finger guns with 12 fingers\*
---
i bought the sub because of the value of atoms alone
---
Because I only care about the private servers. I don't want to have to pay extra for shit I don't even care about. I mean they are not even modable and you can only have a max of 8 players.
---
What are you paid off by Bethesda. Get your cuck ass out of here
---
Huh well hope you’re RNG isn’t as bad as mine is most of the time in ESO, Have fun farming!
---
Maybe stop supporting this garbage company.
---
Now; Fall in line or get banned.
---
The main thing is, it *isn't* a private server. If it was , you'd have camp permanence, people could log out and leave their camp behind.  
---
Instead you're getting access to an empty instance, not even a new one, just one that doesn't have other players in it.  
---
When you log out, your friends get a countdown timer and they get kicked.  
---
How do we rebuild Appalachia if every building vanishes when the player logs off?
---
I completely agree, it's really the only downside to me and probably the reason I won't keep my subscription
---
I bought it to get the atoms and ranger gear then got Microsoft to issue a refund. Still got to keep the atoms and items lmao
---
Ouch... Forgot to change the last title on the second page...
---
lol OP won't respond to any of this, probably already switched to another reddit account
---
I really enjoyed ESO's content and core gameplay. I stopped playing because they kept heavily monetizing every new feature that would be added to the game. At this point there's  a base cost, expansions, a subscription with really desirable QOL features locked behind it, an extensive (and expensive) store that rivals many F2P games, $100+ homes, and the mounts everyone wants are stuffed into loot crates with a less than 1% chance of dropping. Costumes, hairstyles, absurdly priced outfit/style slots, it goes on and on. There's just too much behind a paywall, and not enough to be unlocked in game for me. Left a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Goose while I disagree with your opinion on fo1st. Thank you for the donation.
---
Personally I wouldn't come here to ask for legal advice....ever... but I'd you are interested, look up a few attorneys that handle these sorts of cases, and lay out everything, the lies about the atom shop, the lies about the preorder items, and the recent events. If it turns into a class action lawsuit, I'm sure there are plenty of fed up people here that would love to know about it.
---
Momma Dolce’s gonna need a lore boost so we can both be happy - because I’ve wanted to see what the “Chinese” PA would look like since getting the Stealth Armour in F3
---
It's ok my child, live and learn
---
I didn't need a reason to uninstall and sell that steaming pile of shite.
---
Ненавижу вас об этом рассказывать, но я основываю свое мнение об этой игре на своем собственном опыте игры, а не на том, что мне подсказывает какой-то YouTuber.
---
(That's courtesy of Google Translate. In the original English, my response is that I "hate to break it to you, but I base my opinion of this game on my own experience with playing the game, not what some YouTuber tells me to think.")
---
This is how it's always worked. Pacifist is for toggling on/off pvp only--some people do farm those bots on occasion too, I would grab a few cores from the sentries whenever I passed through
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
I have it pre downloaded, not home to confirm but Xbox store says 25th(today in aus) so should be playable 
---
Store is usually correct as far as time zones go
---
The scrap container has infinite weight and deletes s(crap). We’ve been asking for infinite weight, but not for $100. We’ve been asking for private servers, but not for $100. We’ve asked for things like the fridges, repair kits, protectrons etc. but not for the prices they’re listed at. We wanted them either for free or for a very small price of like $20, not $100.
---
At least you're honest 😂
---
Take my updoot
---
Thankfully that game is free for xbox with game pass
---
The "Slippery slope is a logical fallacy" argument is its self a fallacious argument. The fallacy fallacy specifically. 
---
Human history is full of slippery slopes that you can analyze. Discounting the possibility of one just because muh fallacy is intellectually lazy.
---
 I sold XP boosters. I had a team of fishermen and I did very well until they started selling them.  I was very rich and worked hard for my money. I could buy the motifs etc I wanted. They made that useless. I could go on.
---
They're supposed to be your communication point with the people who do.
---
This is what they've done with that feedback.
---
Congrats.
---
Do me a favour? Market them as Bethesda Paperweights. ;)
---
Tldr
---
hmm. thats a good point. Maybe there should be a FULL pacifist mod then. ZERO damage to non hostiles. Not even mines or exploding cars.  
---
The thing is, the indirect explosions did no damage NPCs, thats why i would go around and shoot cars mostly. I remember that so vividly. Was i high ???
---
Well, it doesn't crash if you look at it sideways, and it's run by a crew that actually knows wtf they are doing, so it's pretty damned good.
---
You won't be alone.  Many people playing and enjoying the game see that it has plenty of value because of that.
---
Haha dumb bug but comical.
---
" **Issue: Players in Full Power Armor / End Game Armor is not registering as Players are killed in 4 hits by Trash Mobs.**  "
---
So that's what happened to me the other day at WS golf club... damn. Full end-game Vanguard armor and higher DR/ER than all PA and I get smashed by a few ghoul love taps.
---
I subscribed and am having a blasty blast with my Ranger Gear lol
---
I don't have the subscription but I agree it should be fixed.  It should allow us to request invites, too.
---
I have a pretty decent amount of people on my friends list.  I meet very people often now and typically get a lot of invites in game and into new discord servers.
---
And most if these groups of people don't know each other!  They're all very different and if I had private servers, I would only want those who I invite to join.  I play with many but the majoring of my time is with some specific people.  I wouldn't want them blocked from joining because others joined on me.
---
However, that's only because I heard the limit is 8.  How pathetic!
---
I get it should probably be smaller than regular servers but that's just sad.   If I could have all friends on 1 server that would be great.
---
Datamine shows they have models/textures for 9 Total Riot/Ranger outfits. Gray, Desert, Riot with each having Standard, Advanced, and Elite variant. The one unlocked with the 1st was just the Standard Gray. The others could be 1st Exclusive but they could also show up on the Atom shop we will have to wait and see.
---
Ahh yes buying the fallout IP from another company was such hard work. So hard in fact they had to pay obsidian to make a game that would make people forget how shitty vanilla fo3 was.
---
I feel like that's one of the biggest problems: Most of the people complaining loudly didn't plan on buying Atom in general. If you do, it's a no-brainer deal, even 1 month at a time. But then if you can afford a game subscription service at all, you're the super elite with a silver spoon in your mouth, paying to win.
---
Thank you for showing me sarcasm
---
But then people can't shit on this game, which is an easy way to get internet points.  Doesn't even matter that Obsidian actually had to come out at one point and tell people to stop shitting on Bethesda.
---
https://www.destructoid.com/obsidian-doesn-t-want-fans-using-the-outer-worlds-to-dunk-on-bethesda-542696.phtml
---
But what I'm saying is just don't say something if you can't guarantee it, they said all cosmetic for paid dlc, that turned into Repair kits (which I see as a pay to not grind item), now a paid subscription for unlimited storage of scrap (which they said couldn't be done) and a free fast travel point that can be taken anywhere, and private servers, which many games provide from release for no extra cost until the game is shut down. They should have said nothing rather than a lie.
---
But since you can buy them with real money that means Bethesda lied to us. And they are going to keep lying to us until we start calling them out on their bullshit.
---
Like I said before, paid private servers are fine. It's normal and expected. But all the benefits that come with Fallout 1st? Nah dawg. No way.
---
Imagine if the server files were given out so people can host their own servers on their own machine. I bet modders had already fixed all the bugs by now I'm sure of it.
---
Deluidion and greed.
---
I'm on the fence.. I Pre Ordered the Tri Centennial Edition for $80 have been trading for so long on reddit lol but this game just isn't worth a monthly Sub ... no way in hell. Maybe if they came out and said it would get more regular updates but we all know that isn't going to happen..If you do keep playing I would say its prob worth it to get the scrap box for a month and stash as much as you can in it but...
---
I can’t remember if I’ve ever bought an exp boost from the crown store I just remember having an absolute boatload left over from daily logins and crown crates.
---
As for ambrosias I never really bought them I usually just ran blue training gear on holiday events.
---
I enjoy playing the game either as a lone wanderer or with a couple friends. I have a good time.
---
"Pay to win"
---
There has to be something going on because most of these posters don't even play the game
---
I do that, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt; sometimes I have to server hop and re-kill enemies. Or worse: watch a YT tutorial.
---
I mean there's been alot of these post practically identical
---
I suspect it was shocking.  Or did you mean taste?
---
3 gold recipies too manny holojack motifs and a few from the now styal so far and 6 witch writs from gold skulls. Hope ur luck gets better. Happy farming to you aswell.
---
I can’t believe there are actual moron idiots paying bethesda for more bugs?
---
It’s magnificent to watch, and also greatly upsetting as Gamers continue to keep cancerous businesses like this alive by funding it.
---
The games easily the worst piece of entertainment I’ve ever consumed without ever putting any money anywhere near it - I just love to watch it fail again and again and again while fanboys defend with their wallets... it’s amazing.
---
Ah karma. All the whales actually thought Bethesda would be fair and actually give them what they paid for? Bethesda? One of the greediest companies that lies through their teeth consistently now? Hahahahaha. Enjoy your paid for Fallout First Shot At Sloppy Seconds
---
Someone working for Bethesda wouldn't swear.
---
I haven't purchased any part of the sub, due to this. I just don't see the point in a private server that isn't persistent. Me and my friends have wildly different playing times, but have wished we could build bases near each other and just grow and contribute to what we can do. 
---
This at first sounded really good, but after learning the details, I'm soured by it. Maybe a future update will do it justice, but at the moment, it's not worth it to me.
---
oh the microtransaction part (the paying bit) will work just fine, but i mean, come one, at this point do we expect bethesda to NOT fuck up something as simple as the private servers?
---
I really hope they didn’t postpone Wastelanders for this crap. I hope there hard at work working out the mechanics of this dlc that’s supposed to be a big deal. 
---
They should bring this out early q1 to keep people hopeful at least but what will happen is they will push it to e3 2020 announcing a fall date again. Sad but true...
---
Remember to double space on reddit
---
You watch, they'll even sell you the mods too. I don't see nexus server-side mods making it to this game. Do you?
---
What you are saying is true, but  they have taken pay win a degree more shameless than most of us could have imagined.   I was expecting the atom shop to start selling  XP boosts and stuff like that. And they have exposed themselves to be outright liars.  Yeah they have done it before but not to such a degree. Good God. They actually said that we can't have unlimited stash space because hey it's an online game and that would interfere with server stability.   Now they are saying we can have unlimited space for a monthly fee.  Then they expect us to pay the monthly fee. They have truly lost their minds.
---
How would you do a PvP only server? You can't set server rules
---
Lmao no
---
Nuke it from orbit, just to be sure 😉

---
I just wish everyone stopped playing 76. Let this game die and let those greedy asshat executives get a clear picture. Enough bs
---
this needs global attention, also give google money to put this on the front page of any fo76 search
---
What you feel for this game, I feel for the whole company. Not looking that forward to Starfield or ESVI.
---
The thing is that fo76 feels inferior to a lot of other live services games. I mean, the premium membership is straight out of the Asian mobile market strategy.
---
And they're doing this and going for the Pay for Convenience route because the game doesn't have enough players to be self sustainable only with cosmetic items. You know what other kind of games do that when their player base shrink? That's right, Korean MMOs. Betting it all on the Whales Bois.
---
I'll probably do it just for those perks this weekend, for the 1 month. I can see that value for sure.
---
What do you think Mr angry pants
---
Give him a minute. Maybe he hasn't completed his thought yet...
---
What's the point then?
---
I didnt see where it increased camp budget. The benefits are [listed here](https://cdn1-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2019/10/Fallout-76-Fallout-1st-Benefits-640x341.jpg) and I dont see anythng about camp budget. though the junk stash IS there, thats the only thing worth while and not worth the price tag.
---
What you paid is all you have to pay to play 76. That was the purchase agreement. 
---
No where was it stated that private servers would be free. Nor does chosing not to pay for a server limit your ability to play the game.....
---
This idea of "We suggested it.... It should be free" is obnoxious.
---
Quitting the game if this happens. I’ve created many threads trying to explain to bethesda how to improve the pet system. To see that system put behind a paywall would be a slap in the face.
---
Imagine being such a pathetic shill to a faceless corporation, that you not only empty your wallet for whatever shit they churn out, but also spend your free time defending said faceless corporation.  
---
  Bethesda doesn't even need a PR team when they have idiots like you doing their work for free.
---
I feel like everyone that likes fo was already gonna play outer worlds
---
well, look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFiNh1OU3K4
---
It wasn't so much a slippery slope, as much as they were just buttering us up to this garbage.
---
at least eso was fun.
---
XDDDD yup. No but jokes aside, if you have food in ur camp, whenever you scrap it, it goes to your scarp box. You can in theory, have unlimited raw fruits/vegetables in ur scrap box if ur dedicated enought.
---
gonna save and copy paste this
---
Good luck with that.
---
And here's the rest of his thought. U/Frank__Lloyd__Wrong
---
I have no clue what he's going on about
---
'a year worth of content!'
---
Errr? some events, challenges, some cosmetics, a survival bolt-on and a battle royal. Woah. 
---
What they've served up is an insult to the potential the game had (a genuinely great map with amazing unused megastructures, some great prewar lore (the competing mining factions) and (scorched besides who are just fucking potato looking) a really varied cast of enemies and weapons). I didn't see it devolving into a cartoon repeat-event fest or a lame fucking 'meat-week'. This is fallout, real weight of decisions and human struggle should be there.
---
I defended the hell out of the game in the past because I really enjoyed my time with it and could see clear ways it could develop (not to mention the way they presented it as a developing thing)- and then none of those materialised and they added nothing to do (besides grinding for... reasons?); and that's been the case for at least 6 months for those who were there from around launch. No wonder they've turned what goodwill they had and failed to retain player interest.
---
And "we're working on it" with no dates, and no updates on it later. Six months from now, someone will be all like, "hey, remember when everyone was mad about the private servers?" And there will be a brief flare up of rage, and then everyone will just... give up.
---
Everyone who's still here, that is.
---
Seems like theyre pushing it a bit
---
Not sure why you’re quoting Frank Sinatra.
---
Im not asking because I want to sue them, Im just curious. Guess need to edit post
---
I havent experienced any difference in weapon decay. Tho to be fair my experiences are not yours.
---
Even the money grubbing assholes at Take2 let us peons have private sessions in GTA5.
---
hates the game but feels the need to give it free real estate in their mind instead of fucking off and moving on
---
You're absolutely right, but seeing as Bethesda themselves have encouraged the modding community over the years by releasing their official modding tools for FREE with every new release, you'd think they'd be a little more aware of the strength and scope of their modding community by now.
---
And, I mean, they ARE. They knew what was there, all that juicy, untapped potential business. They've been wanting a piece of that sweet a$$ for years. 
---
We are not entitled to freely mod their intellectual property, just as Todd isn't entitled to a single more cent out of my pocket for his shitty products. :D
---
I can't believe there are actual moron idiots that spend time on Reddit shit posting about games they don't even play. 
---
Actually, I can believe it. And it's hilarious that those people have nothing better to do 😂
---
Because they're implementing stuff they said they never would. They're doing it because the playerbase is not enough for the game to be self sustainable with cosmetics alone.
---
Most of them are not really sheep, just rich kids(some "adult kids").
---
The good thing is, new stuff will come out and bethesda will stay with its "niche player base" and always, a new product will emerge to fill the gap.
---
Its kind of hilarious coincidence that Outer Worlds is coming out tomorow tho.
---
Did Todd used lube at least?
---
Apparently even recent players can, I think it was in the Forbes article. So I guess players can technically just use others worlds, more than likely to troll them.
---
I did not know that does that include donations
---
Finished enough for me to put hundreds and hundreds of hours into it.
---
Gotten plenty of enjoyment out of it thus far and will in the future.
---
If that twists your nipples, get yourself an ice pack because I couldn't care less.
---
No shit. But my comment in no way implies you have fix it yourself. Just that people here are fickle and never actually put their foot down so this is just gonna blowover like every other fucking thing they complain about.
---
I feel like 8 and 9 we already knew? Like that was part of the plan before the game even launched wasn’t it? No NPCs and all that
---
Maybe I'm on about the fact Bethesda are trying to fuck our arses once again but hey I guess you are down with that
---
As long as I don’t have to do the decrypting part
---
 Yeah this was way back when, I was in the beta. I sold Ambrosia, lots of it, and made a lot of money. They destroyed the real economy to push their crap. 
---
 But the real reason I quit is because they kept fucking nerfing it. It was actually hard at the beginning, but the howls of rage over Craglorn trashing high level players was listened to. I took my Stam/DK into the Clockwork City, I had enough to get that, and its was ridiculous. A boss with a screen wide bar ,,, 4 hits. I have not been back. To be fair Brianne could almost solo the Overfiend. ;)
---
Just remebered two actually. The one bug happened to me once in a public server. I got "stuck" in vats/drugged state. What i mean was that I tagged vats to get a bot near quarry x3 and it basically disappeared and i was stuck in the blurry vision/off color screen. Only a fast travel and tag vats again cleared it up.   
---
The other is that forest scout armor pieces are now the urban scout armor colors masks included.
---
Eh I enjoy 76, the world itself is very enjoyable to explore and a lot of the new lore is pretty interesting (mothman cult, Responders etc)
---
The idea of stanning a blatantly exploitative and money-hungry company is obnoxious.
---
Also your illiteracy and seeming lack of awareness of what was communicated to players by Bethesda itself
---
It will, I mean this is fo76 after all. The amount of crap that occurred in the beginning is no longer even talked about, this just came out yesterday so it will get alot better from here. The stability and the no longer toxic environment make purchasing totally worth it.
---
To give Bethesda more money
---
&gt;a month of gold membership on xbox for $60
---
A month?! I get XBox Ultimate (Gold and Game Pass combined) for a quarter of that price per month!
---
Lets take a look at rockstar...  
---
Hmm isn't rockstar doing even worse? You don't see anyone up in arms carrying pitchforks. I love the new subscription service. I will embrace the downvotes this will get me. I'll just be on my private server where i am free from the griefers and the trolls and the obnoxious babies screaming into their microphones and shooting me with Explosive rounds. I am a single player type of gamer. I rather enjoy the game by myself and nobody else. 
---
Also this 13 dollars also gets me more than just privacy, i get extra atoms, a tent, and unique stuff. All for the price of a burger and fries.
---
the Other Worlds
---
No. It's already been asked and is just flat out stupid. 
---
You were never promised private servers. By buying the base game you were never entitled to use their intellectual property in a way they didn't see fit. 
---
And if this is about cosmetics vs non cosmetics? Have fun making that argument in court.
---
yep I think I agree with this - the tent could be private servers only - you really don't need it when you're on a public server because there are so many camps around. you notice the lack of stash boxes more when you have fewer nice fast-travel points.
---
Trust me, we're doing our best. Please report trolls and personal attacks.
---
Class action lawsuits are very expensive to conduct. A firm usually doesnt chase one without being very confident in the outcome.
---
Ight a very inappropriate comparison but I’m gonna say it anyway because it relates to what you were saying: When the Nazis first game to power, they initially started with taking away rights from Jewish people such as the right to own land or the right to national health insurance, and nobody at the time thought they’d eventually move all the way to genocide.
---
It feels super disgusting of me to compare this situation to the holocaust, but it’s the only “slippery slope” historical situation I can think of at the moment. What I’m trying to say is that assuming that a company or government won’t try to push harder on things they’ve already set in stone is a dangerous thing to do.
---
Human NPCs are now a Fallout First bonus!
---
What, you wanted them for free? You fucking philistine.
---
Okay.  Fair enough not lump people up.  But the non-posters should speak up too.  Because 'everyone' seems to think 'everyone' says bad things about Fallout.  
---
I think some perspective needs to be had on what is free and what is pay-to-win.  When you pay for your license, you are getting the vanilla game and that game has basic limits.  But, you get free updates for DLC content.  Not all of that is atoms.  Vending was a game-changer. Then if you want to enhance your vanilla game you can farm some atoms or buy them in the store.  You do not need to do this to play the game, it is completely optional. If you are getting bored with the grind of the game to fix your weapons, you can pay for repair kits. That is not pay-to-win, especially since you can get those in-game.  I have over 100 and I've never spent an atom on them.  Scrap kits are just stupid especially now with the scrap box and you can drop a survival tent anywhere (if you are always over-encumbered, you're doing it wrong\[even without a scrapbox\]).  I have never seen so people get so upset over a digital refrigerator.  We are literally talking about thousands of people complaining on Reddit about a 'not-real' refrigerator.  And how they are going to burn their computers because they have to pay for a premium tier to the game (again, completely optional - not required to enjoy the vanilla game you paid for).
---
I'm not trying to shame people (well, maybe a few).  I am just trying to point out, and there is no disputing there is a ton of hate over this game.  I want to know why.  Why the negativity over any of this stuff.  In my opinion, it's a fine game.  I enjoy it immensely.  I understand people may not view it the same way.  But how is it okay that the only thing this game is known for right now is all the negative news.  I 've got people saying they are bigger fans than me because I should be mad at Todd for lying to us.  But in fact, those thousands of people that do complain every single day in here about Fallout are probably somewhere in the 1000hr game clock.  And just like restaurant reviews, people only write anything when they want to complain.  Reddit is where people come when they want to complain.  Then you get news magazines who want to write a story and they go to Reddit, and write a story off the last couple of posts they read.  Most likely never even played the game.  Because I am seeing no evidence that people are not playing this game.  Worlds are frequently full and there are griefers everywhere to kill.  And I don't particularly mind if they rage quit.    
---
I got your back Appalachia.
---
ESO?
---
Modus is happy with that
---
Yeah, I quit the game during the first few days after it went live...I did not enjoy it.  However, I kept it installed with the intention of checking it out again after Wastelanders went live.  I gave up and uninstalled it last night.
---
You don't have to, it's purely an option. A good shotgun/limb cripple build works great on all bots, you can disable any attacks, just take out the legs/head on the Assaultron, the gun arms on the gutsies, and the legs/gun arms on the sentries.
---
That said, if you do attack them either accidentally or on purpose, a simple server hop will fix the hostility against you
---
I mean, I’m getting it, but it has nothing to do with what’s going on with fo76 and bethesda. I’m still gonna play fo76 on the side, and I doubt outer worlds will stop me altogether from playing it(might take a big chunk of time away from it tho)
---
 I'm PCMR, you think I care? I built this machine to play games.
---
ESO was zenimax online not BGS
---
Yep, I've got Ultimate and get far more for my money than I'd get with Fallout 1st.
---
Would you say it's a pro gamer move?
---
Isn’t that what the $100 sub is for?
---
Don't forget your subscription or we're gonna give you nightmares
---
If you don’t like the game don’t fucking play it. Move the fuck on. Get over yourself.
---
There is a chance that they don't have much to show to us atm. 
---
The other thing is maybe this whole Wastlanders DLC is not going to be as big as peoples expect.
---
Got a source for that, or...?
---
They’re convinced they can’t routinely improve and provide positive customer experience so they’ve switched to aggressive monetization. 
---
They could have been more profitable if they had invested in departments that focus on improving and providing a quality customer experience that is worth the money we pay for.
---
It’s simple business and strategic planning but bethesda is instead putting its focus on the wrong avenues in the pursuit of generating meaningful and routine profit in the video game industry. Truly a missed opportunity that keeps showing the ugly consequences.
---
A shitshow just happened, I'd be surprised if they even say anything next week.
---
By Clockwork City I’m assuming you don’t mean the raid right? Because I’ve attempted that on HM and let me tell you that big dragon ain’t getting taken down in 4 hits haha.
---
Not all of us are, so I’m not surprised you don’t care if those of us on console find $160 expensive to play a game the way we want to.
---
You know, if this came with some substantial gameplay content and didn't offer exclusive skins and emotes designed to just make other players jealous and want to also subscribe, I'd maybe be ok with this.  I'd pay for a substantial stream of future content either through expansions or a subscription (after the Wastelanders update) but this is just what people have wanted from the base game from the day it launched.  Hurts man.
---
I think you're right.
---
I get the impression they don't want to be supporting this game when their next release comes out, and so they have no reason not to just monetize everything they can until its playerbase dries up and they can turn off the servers. A game with only whales simply isn't sustainable, they use terms from an ecosystem for a reason. If they ever had the long-term success of 76 as a priority, they don't anymore.
---
There is nothing preventing you from playing the fucking game, nothing is any different from 3 days ago. Nothing about fallout first negatively effects your fucking gameplay experience one bit, so once again, what the fuck are you going on about it.
---
Don't like it, don't buy it. Simple concept
---
I mean.... it's a desert..... what did you expect... and they had less than a year to make the damn game soooo yeah. But indeed, they could have added a bit more stuff.... just a tiny bit more.
---
About the same for me. The really nice thing is not seeing any more low level mobs spawned by other players in high level areas.
---
Bethesda should try shipping great games that lots of people really enjoy playing at launch as a way to make money.
---
Don't worry, next month the portion of the people wearing NCR Ranger will be much bigger. Maybe even all of them.  
---
Their number will stay the same though. It's just the only reason for you to stay in this god forsaken game will be because you've spent a hundred dollars on a timed bonus, might as well use it before leaving.
---
Because it’s a testament to gaming history - nothing before in anything virtually entertaining has something received such critical and commercial negativity from the moment it was released to this very day now.
---
I’m here to witness history!  be part of it!
---
Also, whenever you need to take a shit you tend to find the nearest toilet..  how convenient this is.
---
I guess more shit more load  - coincidentally, this mostly happens when I'm about to free overburdened toons onto mules
---
Fair enough, that makes sense too.
---
Yeah? What was communicated? Cosmetics would only be for money? 
---
The suggestion of private servers, widely requested by the community.... Is not DLC. Is not cosmetics.... So it being a paid for deal is just fine.
---
Hopefully, they get the point.  I doubt it though.  Ubisoft's CEO just admitted they screwed the pooch with Breakpoint and delayed everything, citing quality concerns and needing longer dev cycles.  Although, this is hardly their first rodeo.
---
Remember when Obsidian actually had to come out and tell you people to stop shitting on Bethesda over Fallout 76?  Apparently not...
---
Wow. A whale giving a shit for us little guys. Props to you dude. Much appreciated :)
---
It's like they're determined to kill this game.
---
["Boss are you sure? It's actually a decent game now and people are finally wanting to play it."](https://i.imgur.com/VQYNCeF.png)
---
If you want a private world then just ask me. I would host the server , you can do anything with your friends and I make sure that our paths wont cross (or i will go afk so that you really have your peace). I have only one friend who plays F76 but he waits for Wastelanders so the only thing i can do with the private server is using it for people who want a world but not Fallout 1st.
---
Again just ask me
---
apparently somehow thanks to fallout 1st he is unable to log in without being depressed and dying inside
---
Even though nothing is different than three days ago if he doesn't have it. Just another drama queen
---
This was my thought im pretty sure the number of items is anywhere between 50 to 250
---
 Not the world boss, he was great. I dunno it was a lesser one, I did not stay that long.
---
 I have soloed all the original world bosses. They did step up that game in the DLCs.
---
You missed the point but someone else explained it perfectly for you.
---
Have fun paying for your disappearing scrap and various bugs, do you also buy used diapers? You must with that mentality
---
If you're this worked up over 12 dollars and a video game, you need to get a life.
---
Where’s the popcorn, Reddit’s funny as hell the last two days
---
Well as soon as they released the private servers and everyone freaks out, then the next day the media is all pushing outer worlds...seems weird
---
ESO is really good I put over 100 hrs playing solo in 1st person mode and mostly played it like a ES game but it's an actual mmo so some of the harder stuff you need a team for but imo try the base game and see if you like before buying any expansions (and yeah there are a lot of microtranactions but none of it is needed)
---
That's funny. That's what I said.
---
Deleting your scrap and letting you play in raided areas is clearly intended. It is Bethesdas punishment for people who bought the stuff because they really thought Fallout First wasn't an out-of-season fool's day joke.
---
Come on! Fallout First is obviously not meant to be taken seriously.
---
Well done Bethesda, being funny for once...
---
"wastelanders will be paid dlc" - us
---
"hmmm thats a great idea.....lets do that!" - them.
---
But there is a 13-100 dollar subscription for features that you all wanted for free that should've been in the game already, they don't work properly anyway.
---
Gamers are by far the most pathetic consumer group.  They may be beaten by religious people that buy magic scarfs.  Or people who spend money on psychics.  I exclusively play games as a hobby and I'm embarrased to utter the word gamer because it's such an embarrassing term.  Simply put gamers will put up with any companies completely fucking them over, and still say thank you.  I hope the term gamer can mean more than "pathetic neck beard fatty so addicted to his game he cant stand up to blatant unethical theft."  Because all nom gamer friends of mine view gamers this way and I cant seem to come up with a defense.  Fallout 76 fanbase just proves this.  (I'm a huge fallout fan)
---
You will literally never run out of story and stuff to do for god knows how long, im cp 420 and ive yet to not do many upon many zones xD. Yea ESO is basically a mmo trying to be as close to the sp games as possible which its done well to do its own thing in that right.
---
Im getting extremely disgusted with these Live Service garbage games they are designed from the ground up to scam the player with these stealth nerfs and other kind of manipulations thats why you can't play it offline. Fuck Bugthesda trash company.
---
You're not even getting a genuinely private server, plus you're getting access to features (scrap box and tent) that should be in the base game and not behind a pay wall. That's the issue. 
---
Not to mention the people who are being forced to get a subscription if they want to get the highly requested NCR ranger armor. Not only do you have to the pay for a service you might not want, but wearing it makes you end up surrounded by people who are judging the shit out of you.
---
No, they're going to sell the persistent feature. $100 a year.
---
Why are there even people buying this
---
You could dig into the beginning of the US' Iraqi war as a huge slippery slope that has lasted longer and costed more money than the country's government ever expected. It was a common argument among the anti-foreign war stance at the time of its conception even.
---
Shoko Asahara and his cult is another example you could go into.
---
The rise of microtransactions in single player games has been a slippery slope of more and more egregious implementations and widespread use.
---
History is full of them really both politically and not. I'm not saying to instantly believe a slippery slope argument, but to ignore its possibility especially when evidence of it is occuring (repair kits, scrap kits, scrap bot, fridges, now 1st) is genuinely silly.
---
Beth basically confirmed the slippery slope argument when they renounced their word of only cosmetics in an official update last week.
---
If you hit up Fissure Prime, they are neverending, LSB after LSB after LSB.
---
I dropped 5 in about 15 minutes yesterday and they kept coming. 
---
They dont seem to spawn as legendary if Scorched Earth is going on though.
---
The point is you can do 8 player multiplayer for free in Minecraft but it’s paid in 76
---
People like you were the reason the other people get fucked. You guys just love throwing money at companies for doing shady shit. Speak with your wallet and don't spend 100 dollars a year for a game they were having trouble giving away for free a couple months ago.
---
Oh, oops, guess my memory was a bit faulty on such, could've sword ID was bought out entirely and integrated into bethesda, whoops.
---
I don't even think it's covering the turd in gold, it's covering it in brass so it's not even legitimately valuable on its surface xD
---
Are scorchbeast the place for legendary farm now?
---
To the people who started the slippery slope argument back during repair kits and the unstoppables outfit.
---
*im sorry*
---
did the actual site get taken down?
---
I understand why everyone is complaining about a lot of this, but modding? Did you really think they would let you mod the game on public servers?
---
So its behind the paywall required to get a private server. Has anyone here who's complaining ever ran a private server in other games? Unless you have a PC to devote to it, most people just pay a monthly hosting fee to run private servers. And it usually ends up costing about $100 a year.
---
There is plenty to complain about - they should not have launched this until persistent servers were ready, and the requirement for someone with a sub to be logged in is a bit dodgy. But in general - I think the complaining is way overboard.
---
It's only meaningless if you believe there are only two options. Young or old, hero or villain.
---
Depends on when you last played. but this year they have given us new weapons, cloths, missions, and events based off the Sheepsquatch. The Arktos Lab event. Vault 94 events. Nuclear Winter. Legendary Vendor. And a couple of limited time events in Meat week and Fastnacht.
---
Edit: Also backpacks and events based on Pioneer Scouts.
---
I’m not even mad.
---
All players meet in one workshop and fight kill each other pretty straightforward.
---
How did they ruin it by making a spin off? Fallout Tactics exist and that didn't ruin Fallout.
---
... I know who you are!
---
My first thought was Robot Chicken's "Bail Nobra".
---
I've been saying that about the robot for a while. People acted like it was a disgusting act by Bethesda to have people pay for it, but you sure do see it at every camp. At least 4/5 camps have it. So, either the outrage online is all for show, or the outrage community is a small one and likes to act like they represent everyone. Meanwhile, I sit back and laugh with my fridge and scrapbot, using scrap kits while wearing my Ranger Armor.
---
The lag wouldn’t happen if they duped in private servers
---
U know ur probly right and idk how many people actually do quit when they say they will but if they do im gna delete this game
---
Nah just sad to see the mentally ill being manipulated like this. Only trying to educate. Even worse to see someone say they only buy it to "cuck" the haters. Please seek help
---
You can’t sell much junk loose. You need to bulk it for sale. Don’t worry about legendary gear while leveling up. Craft new gear instead of fixing it before 50. 
---
You can make caps by farming materials and selling to players, especially lead, steel, and acid.
---
So true. The drama queens should all leave. Then the 6 people who enjoy this game as is can keep on keeping on.
---
I can make a crappy (pun intended) website in two hours. Winter is coming so frozen turds will soon be found everywhere. For the amazing price of $14,99 I will personally find a frozen turd and send it to BGS Austin, TX. I am seriously considering it.
---
Their holidays are coming up
---
This is what I keep asking myself. They’re like vegans. They don’t believe in eating meat and they don’t want you to be allowed to eat meat either.
---
I literally upvoted this several times, not because it made much of a difference, but because it made me feel a little better.
---
That's why I don't understand people saying "How did you expect private servers to be free?". Well because they implied it when they said "it's all free after launch"
---
That's what I plan on doing. It's a bit shameless though to release a product that's incomplete and have us pay for it. But it is Bethesda so nothing new there.
---
Because the game is fun?
---
Not only would modders have fixed all the bugs, they'd be introducing new content that would make the game worth while so much faster it'd make Bethesda's head spin. Like... it's been a year and they still haven't put NPCs, meaningful quests and compelling endgame content? I imagine modders would have that done in literally half the time that has passed... at the most.
---
Yes, I started late and played through the story. The thought of Wastelanders being around the corner kept me going with the end of game grind and lack of content. But the push back announcement got me to uninstall and just wait it out. Following the push back News with a subscription announcement for a game that doesn’t merit a subscription was enough to get me to reconsider ever coming back. The thing that kills me is the whole time I played managing scrap space was the least fun aspect of the game. But after reviewing this sub-reddit I learned it was a server limitation so I took it in stride. The locking additional junk space behind a paywall was a slap in the face. And I picked the game up in July for $12.00 after Wild Appalachia. I can’t image what someone that’s been with this train wreck since day one feels like.
---
Minecraft was Mojangs first multiplayer game and look how that went ;)
---
Game is trash
---
Do I need to be a certain level
---
Whales all of them :p
---
I'm hugely impressed to see this, actually. Well done, you. In your defense, you weren't alone, and a lot of people had asked for the fridge. But I guess we all hoped (against all evidence) that it would be a plan, rather than this mess.
---
I haven't played it since launch? What did they change that helped it? What do I get since I already bought it with the season pass, since it's f2p?
---
I was the author of the 'quality of life wish list' for 4 months, and was very active and supportive of this game.
---
This is just embarrassing and is prompting me to uninstall. How can they be this stupid/greedy? Fuck em, there are other games to play.
---
yea, I should have saved the money from Fallout 76 to buy the Destiny 2 dlc...
---
You are correct. I hopped a lot of private servers and never found any area which was more or less cleared of enemies. Occasionaly one meat bag here and there, which was probably aftermath of mob vs mob interaction.
---
Yea, they actually took the mandatory subscription away, made it buy to play and produced Morrowind, improving the game alot.  Imagine that happening today.  Which maybe this whole F76 heartbreak is solely Bethesda Games  from top to bottom and has little to do with Zenimax, idk.
---
Like the look but first rule of print design - no hyphenation.
---
They are decent at dropping 1* items for me, about half the time. They still spawn as non-legendary pretty often.
---
Looking back, I think I misinterpreted your first post. I took *"and then move on"* to mean the complainers abandoning the game (which... if complaining isn't an constructive and *leaving* isn't constructive, what else is there?), but now I think you meant that people eventually just forget all the shit Bethesda's pulling once the outrage dies down and go back to playing. Which, yeah, is a depressing reality for some. If the sheep keep on grinding and paying out despite promises to leave, then no wonder Bethesda thinks they can also get away with broken promises and empty PR-speak.
---
Still, my bad for the misunderstanding.
---
Man, I think you've got a screw loose. Simmer down.
---
I’m new to all this but I’ve come to understand to power of networking with ppl around us quite amazing. Long story short FALLOUT 76 can do me a favour for making the stupids move in there career while not even being able to fix any of the issue that have and still going on lmao so 76 how start is ur team.
---
If nothing happened with NMS nothing will happen with FO76 imo
---
No joke, playing Destiny 2 once it came out on Steam made me realize that a Fallout-skinned D2 would be more fun than 76 was. And I *defended* this game at launch...
---
I'm in
---
the update that broke the Internet.
---
Did you see any scorchbeast with more than one star? Me not yet.
---
That sounds amazing
---
how do you feel now
---
No they said they would cost people like to ignore that part tho
---
Do you think scorchbeast is the best mob to farm for legendaries? Where do you farm them?
---
Clear your friends list before you go into a private server, anyone on your list can join and stay since there’s no Vetting process or kick option
---
There’s a difference between how regular items are stored and how junk is stored. Junk is stored as one item regardless of how large the stack itself is while guns cannot stack and take up a larger amount of memory hence why the stash limit is required. Similarly it’s why you don’t have infinite inventory/bank space in ESO but you can store an infinite amount of crafting materials in your crafting bag. Also ESO is an MMORPG private worlds would make the game incredibly dull. 
---
Fallout 1st isn’t a paywall, I can load up 76 right now and I can play just fine without having the subscription just like I’ve been doing the past 11 months.
---
I try not to but with my sliver of health it's pretty much inevitable.
---
Someone that will stoop to trivializing mental illness over someones gaming preferences is probably the one that needs to seek help...
---
You do you, friend...
---
I'll spend my money how I see fit... And if it fucks people like you down the road, so be it... Icing on the cake...
---
Dude. If you don’t like these pieces of crap why do you even bother with this stuff? Go find something you DO like and stop making yourself miserable over this
---
I agree with that but most of the things I say aren't as a main source of info for a product that can be sold for money
---
Yeah because the four year Bethesda/Zenimax has operated ESO+ counts nothing?
---
Now everyone points at CD Projekt Red. And that worries me. We've seen how this goes...
---
Meanwhile.....thousands of subscribers are enjoying their new private worlds free from survivor rejects and other douche baggery.
---
See, the problem is the "anymore" part. They have played the game before, and they gladly would again - they have paid their hard earned money for it after all - but if they keep seeing bullshit just keep coming, they get pissed.  
---
Imagine if you paid for a bus pass but then all buses suddenly change their routes and none take you from home to work anymore. The people who still can get where they want wouldn't mind, but you would be fucking pissed anyway now wouldn't you?
---
Now imagine someone telling you "Oh, quiet down, you don't even use buses".
---
Now *that* can piss you off.
---
If you think this is about 12 dollars and not the fact that people pay into a monetization system that negatively effects the entire industry, you are an idiot.
---
*MODUS would like to know your location*.
---
Let people bitch I still have fun in the game And im just happy I finally have a cool helmet and outfit to go over my marine armor since they sadly dont have the marine combat helmet in game for xb1 players
---
Well I haven't yet. I paid my $1 to microsoft to play Outer Worlds for a month. So I'll check in on this after 30 days.
---
I'm level 46 and am struggling so...
---
Haha! If you want help with shipping fees, you just let me know. With any luck at all, it won't be frozen anymore on arrival!
---
And that's what the statement implies? It's a nothing statement. Might as well talk about society and gamers rising up lol
---
head, meet sand
---
Dude that did this is my freakin hero
---
And then have to repeat it again and again every time you log off or get disconnected, defeating the whole point of a "private" server.
---
I've also seen players level 100+ saying they haven't launched one yet
---
For real. Life is too short to be so mad about an unnecessary feature in a game.
---
Never... and if you go to a lawyer they will laugh you out of their office...
---
Hey bro.
---
Not hate! Just saw this post in one of MrMattyplays videos. He offered to buy you Outerworlds if you email him.
---
Thought I'd pass it on.
---
This is the problem with agile development unfortunately. You put out a minimum viable product by design in order to get things to consumers for direct feedback and testing while you work on adding additional features. It allows you to be nimble, the problem is when your customers don’t understand what it is you are doing. Their communications and PR are lacking for sure. This is just they way companies develop nowadays.
---
Loved No Man’s Sky, day one release for me from indie developers that stuck true and didn’t abandon their goal - multiple free updates later it’s shaping up to be how I’d always wanted it to be.. Par the exploration.
---
Check my top posts on reddit... NMS.  So jokes on you. 2 years later and it’s fantastic
---
Fallout 76 is monetised to its absolute maximum at the cost of GAMEPLAY, arbitrary walls to climb so that the resolve can be sold to you.  Those bugs that interfere are ever always present.. those subscriptions for nothing but disappointment. No signs of improvement Anywhere..
---
 I’ll skip - go back to playing one of the other Good, fallouts.  Bethesda’s done.
---
I play less than I used to, but I really enjoy ESO from time to time.  It's tough to compare to 76, but ESO is definitely more stable.  I was only disconnected like a year ago when I was in an intense fight and the game kicked me for "spamming buttons".  
---
I would watch youtube videos to get a sense of the gameplay and see if it's something you'd be into.  Inventory management is easier as you can create multiple characters that can exchange items through a shared bank.  I even tried out the subscription service when I played more frequently and liked the value I felt I got from it.  For what ESO is, I really don't have any complaints as I was originally careful with expectations as well as my wallet.  ;)
---
He was one of the big devs at obsidian and is responsible for fo1 2 and New Vegas’s DLC
---
I told them a while back that I would pay a sub for more stash, or camp budget.  I’m a third of the way there and wow I get my own world.
---
except you can't raid or play reliably on the servers. but if you have a private server, it *is* reliable and smooth without hiccups. (they come looted with dead mobs too so supposedly it's "private")
---
so you can buy access to a smoothly running game yeah ....
---
Not yet, but I plan on searching for more today.
---
Yea bro these people are just karma farming. I guarantee in a week when all of this subsides you'll hardly see those accounts making those posts. They'll be in a totally different subreddit complaining about a different game they likely hardly play. That or they'll be karma farming the next "outrage"
---
It has plenty content and is this worth a sub but 76 isn’t
---
I'd be fine with just playing adventure mode.... if there was any new content
---
Yeah but I had hope lol... How dumb am I?
---
I'll think about it while I'm exploring the galaxy 😁
---
I didn't know 12 dollars was draining. News to me
---
You screw it up this badly by doing... everything they have. I was willing to ignore an issue or eighteen, but this is just stupid.
---
Bethesda made and sold a product which basically worked, all the whiners have enjoyed or at least used the product for nearly a year, they have had there pound of flesh. Any further products offered beyond the game purchase price is separate and is simply a case of *caveat emptor*.
---
If we bother to read their terms and conditions I'm sure they are covered perfectly enough for everything that has and will be done while offering Fallout 76 to market.
---
the game is a service
---
go play fo4 and stop the endless whining.
---
Thankfully I only have IRL friends on my list. BUT I'm gonna hold off either way.
---
yes and stable servers for raid viability is now behind a paywall.
---
*sniff sniff* but your honor! *sniff* they added a subscription service that doesn't negatively impact me in any way *cries*
---
PSA: If you don't quit the game, you're a chode.
---
And I'm happy for them.
---
I wish they knew they could bug their way into an empty server for free, though, like the rest of us do.
---
Your "PC master race" is showing
---
Do we know what happens when the sub runs out?
---
That's a bit of a stretch. The console fee goes to the console company, not Bethesda. Be mad at the consoles for that.
---
I'm still hoping they realize how big of a fuck up this is and make it so private servers can be hosted on actual privately owned user hardware down the road, but i'm having a hard time holding my breath for that... :(
---
This is the best thing I've seen all day.
---
I suppose so
---
They wouldn't know what to do with the engine or how to make a Fallout game.  Fallout 76 essentially an extension of BGS/Fallout 4's design, ESO was a completely separate product from any previous ESO.  We would have ended up with ESO with guns.
---
r/thathappened
---
No, Zenimax built an entire new engine for ESO.  
---
It hasn't been publicly named however, and they don't seem interested in licensing it out any time soon.
---
I can see you're really trying, and I was really trying to simplify it for you. Maybe this is more apt; If one toddler in a room full of toddlers throws a tantrum, does that mean that *all* toddlers, are throwing tantrums *forever*? 
---
 Just as in this situation, it means that everyone's attention is focused on the noisy toddle, and not truly representative. If your survey sample is biased, your conclusions will, also, be biased. And unfortunately, when that just reinforces an already held belief, well...
---
Why don't you talk to me again in a week or two about how representative this temporary outrage is of the community as a whole.
---
And the biggest problem is I think there are alot more suckers they we think. Any huge publisher got entire departments who study market, looking at statistics, cost benefit analysis and so on. This 1st shit is not just random decision, not another dumb move, all of this is calculated...pretty smart people think all this noise would worth it and chances are they are right.
---
Horse armour was and is ridiculous. It was a company trying to claim
---
that a trivial asset of the game was worth a significant fraction of the full game price. Perhaps rather than being concerned that things like this are exaggeration people should look back and see how bizarrely normalised certain things are. Ten years ago nickle and diming the customer by trying to sell armour sets in a full game was seen as ridiculous. Now people have shifted to the point that they’ll gladly support games that are sold at full price, entirely buggy and empty, with restricted cosmetics sold again at a third of the games price!
---
Id rather have a grenade with his face on that when it explodes instead of going kaboom just says it just works
---
Where do you suggest farming them?
---
ignoring the traditional bugs that come with every Beth release, Oblivion is an awesome game even today.
---
There is nothing the law can do.
---
Bethesda made a statement before this launched that they  had to reevalute the buisness model of the game. 
---
They told us what was going to happen.  And they didnt force you to pay for content you already have access to.
---
There is no false advertising.
---
I'll give it a shot, but I don't think I'll come up with a good one...
---
\*ahem\*
---
I do not agree with your monetary choices, but fully recognize that I have no right to try to sway your opinion one way or another. I would at least wait for more content, or for them to fix the content that they already promised with the subscription fee to begin with.
---
.... How was that?
---
And for as many people that have no legitimate reason to be in this sub, there's multiple more who do play the game and are pissed.
---
Yeah deffo lol
---
I think the word is "fool" not "whale".  $100 a year isn't a lot of money, it's the part where they're leasing you access to workarounds to a poorly made game.  Buying into this subscription model is encouraging them to maintain bad game design with the expectation people will pay to get around design limitations.  They have no motive to fix actual server performance now.  No motive to correct the base game inventory database storage design.  They appear content to milk people via workarounds instead.
---
With any luck though this will kill off the general player base, put a huge hole in the atom shop sales, and cause the whole thing to implode.  Maybe they'll release the dedicated server files as a peace offering when they shut off the official servers.
---
You got what you paid for. It just werkz.
---
Yep, had a lot of fun popping ~~Ward of Dawn~~ THUNDERDOME on people in Crucible last night. Haven't picked up Shadowkeep yet, though.
---
&gt;Unfortunately some of us don't see the bright future of Adventure mode.
---
Irrelevant.
---
Sounded like an addiction problem...
---
But if they don't have any significant history with the game, they why do they care? It's not because people are being mistreated. If that was the case then this amount of outrage would've happened when Activision fired 500 staff only to refill the positions at lower wages, when Bioware had constant "stress casualties" during the development of Anthem, when EA illegally sold loot boxes in Belgium, when Take Two and Activision abused tax laws in Britain to avoid paying anything, when Rockstar nonchalantly admitted it was running its staff through 100 hour work weeks, when EA shut down (insert one of a dozen studios here), when TellTale closed without notifying it's employees until the day of and leaving them with no safety net, the list goes on.
---
The hate mobs don't actually care about the well being of people, they just gravitate to easy targets. Occasionally they'll get it right like with "surprise mechanics" or the Konami/Kojima situation, but buy and large whatever catches on, they join in and lash out. Things that actually crack the industry open and examine the abuse and mistreatment of actual people are... Uncomfortable. Your capital G Gamers are often complicit and discomfort doesn't catch on. It's not an easy target.
---
I didn't even read the real one because it was so irritating. This one I read through and thoroughly enjoyed it. That person who rewrote this is an amazing individual. I needed this, thanks person!
---
The did it with elder scrolls online so I reckon they can do it for fallout 76.
---
Doesn't mean obsidian is big.
---
We're in a fallout community so of course new Vegas is known here but you'd be surprised how obscure it was.
---
Obsidian aren't huge.
---
That doesn’t mean it isn’t shameful that it wasn’t there first
---
It took three years for NMS to improve the way it has, and its first content update only released like four months after release. Games take time to improve. This game is improving on the same level of ESO, which was also a disastrous release. That's just the way things are now, you don't have to play them, just wait for them to improve
---
I'm on it too, but damn it's a lot lol. I feel for y'all. Thanks for your work :)
---
Sure, I've done it myself. Just pointing out that the *majority* of private server players pay for hosting.
---
We get the world we deserve.
---
I love eso. FO76 would be so good if it just grab a few items from. Like having more than one big boss
---
Oh yeah I'm buying that game you know the price? Been looking forward to that game for ages since it first got announced and found out it was by Obsidian
---
But does it matter if people will still buy it? $100 is still $100, even after small scandal.
---
Hello Games made a heroic effort to turn their game around and it's quite ok these days.
---
Bethesda is making a heroic effort to completely destroy their brand and eviscerate any trust some of you still had in them.
---
lol! Welcome to 2008.
---
Same, Ill try to nuke it tonight
---
It just makes me feel shit cos I had so much invested in Bethesda but it's just become one big drain bit like you comments you salty bitch
---
If on xbox I got some trades if u wanna get rid of red outfit just let me know
---
megustalations
---
It's not about the money, it's about the implementation.  
---
I was happily throwing 10 euros each time some pack with exlusive skin is released.  
---
Now I don't want to, but it kinda feels forced, so it's better to step away from the game for the near future.
---
It’s a private world not a private server
---
Everything after Wild Appalachia was either Battle Royale or so broken that it sucked, Don’t try the Vault 94 Raid, and the sheepsquach event is dead like Arktos
---
So you just want to deny any hand you might have in the state of the gaming world because you can rationalize what you do...,but everyone else is wrong
---
I think imgur ghosted the post about this.
---
For me, more.
---
If it was 4.99 a month or 30 a year I would think about buying it.
---
I love it!!!
---
Implying that everyone who came across the tweet was “a room full of toddlers” rather than actually knowing why I keep bringing up the whole “across platforms” point.
---
You’d have any inkling of an argument if we were focused on one notoriously anti-Bethesda subreddit. On every medium relating to Fallout, Bethesda, and on every social media platform where they have a presence, they’ve encountered a negative reaction. That’s not a sample size of toddlers, *those are there consumers.*
---
Why I have to repeat myself is beyond me. Work on your comprehension skills prior to commenting so I don’t have to
---
Ladies and gentlemen, stupidity at its finest
---
They'll be back in a week and they'll be your friends again :)
---
When development stops
---
Maybe it was... fallout 1st was the intervention
---
But something else being worse doesnt justify behaviour and practices which are  not as bad as they could be. Whataboutism doesn't justify bad behaviour. And people were up in arms about Rockstar. The advantage Rockstar had was that they delivered decent games in the first place. Which made the outcry less noticeable.
---
Modding was the only think I was holding out on probably gonna uninstall it now.
---
You guys are funny... For 12.99 you get 1650 atom points alone that alreday pays for it lol everything else is just amazing goodies and extras a power armour skin cost more then that...ill happly pay every month
---
I enjoy it.  
---
No singular reason.  Its fun.
---
Well you can get a month of xbox game pass on PC for $1. Which includes the game. I actually just finished my preload. 30 days from what I hear is plenty for this game, though I'll probably buy the 'Game of the Decade' Edition on Steam for $20 a year from now and play again with mods.
---
Bethesda Studios is Bethesda Devs.  While "THEY" aren't all the people in control.  They did code it.   The studio is responsible.  Bethesda the Publisher was opened by the people Bethesda, and the people in control.
---
Do I care that the devs were told to make it?  No.
---
They, as in the developer, coded it, implemented it, and fucked it up.
---
I don't care that they were just following orders.
---
It’s right up there at the top of the sub man: “...it’s all free - all our content.” Just because this is not story DLC does not mean it’s not content.
---
Not to mention their continual solicitation of our feedback under the guise of improving the game, to turn around and sell us the implementation of that feedback.
---
The level to which you’ll do mental gymnastics to accept manipulation is astounding
---
Because I enjoy Fallout with friends, someone already made this post earlier btw
---
You paid for this?! How much crap does there have to be before you can smell it?
---
not even the developers of control play control anymore.
---
So god damn true lol way to loose your own client 76 lmao
---
Because I enjoy it as it is? Does need some new content though, free content
---
I haven’t played since about 2 months after release... I’m tempted to give it another go but at the same time I think I’d rather do another run through of FO4 since it’s been years.
---
What happens to online games when the player base gets small?
---
If there's anything i learned this past decade, its that "slippery slope fallacy!" is usually touted by the people greasing the slope
---
Then that should be your point. Not some request to make a paid service free
---
Oh god not the teddies
---
I **wa**s happy to try new builds, collect all plans and just grind materials, which I could sell or craft weapons and armor to learn mods.  
---
Also exploring the gorgeous Appalachia and learning corporate secrets.
---
my bad!
---
someday you might get your wish
---
they will stop trying to make money, fo76 will be shut down, and you'll have nothing to complain about anymore.
---
Idk were u got that screwy thaught from but bethesda has plenty of (Whales) willing to pay 2 play. And if everyone magicaly left they would shut the game down. As it would cost them too mush to keep it online.
---
Persistent worlds aren’t around yet. They already said when you log out you lose that stuff
---
But but but but  Pete and Todd said ______!
---
Read the post I just made and see why I completely agree with you 👍🏼
---
Bye Felicia.
---
*Stares in minecraft*
---
Sour
---
If you can find a YouTube video that hasn't been edited to heck and back, you'll see Todd's face right before he mentions its online only. He knows the reaction that's coming.
---
Likely because they had folks soft pitch it in the 76 Reddit before it was announced officially. 
---
Everyone in the Reddit had the reaction "nah, thy wouldn't do that to us, they know we want single player. They wouldn't do online only - maybe they have the option to do co-op with a friend". 
---
This happens to be my opinion too, but I'm not projecting here. This was the main reaction in the sub in the two-three weeks before it was announced at E3.
---
Also - most videos of that e3 presentation have edited out the shocked silence. 
---
But yeah - Todd knew e was announcing something a majority of the (previous?) current fan base didn't want. Gotta give credit to the guy to doing the speech himself, rather than having some flunkie do it.
---
But that's all I'll give him credit for.
---
Yeah no modding not playing anymore was holding out for that.
---
Uninstalled fallout 76, and the Bethesda launcher since it was the only game ever purchased on it. Day one buyer, and they spit in our faces for the last time.
---
I meant year, I should really check wtf my phone decides to put instead of what I typed beforehand....correcting it now.  :l
---
i did
---
Time the most valuable thing we have...
---
Anybody who paid for this service completely deserves the backlash from it.
---
Good for you, now come join us in Borderlands 3. We have cookies. AND EXPLOSIONS!!!!
---
It will be free, IF you buy the subscription
---
Because i enjoy it.
---
Remember that I don’t care. 🤡
---
 Here is the entire ball of wax. Pitiful really. ;)
---
The problem is the price to test out their incomplete products. As well as them using the community as an excuse to break their promises. Also releasing incomplete products for full price is also not good consumer practices and companies should be called out for that kind of stuff. That's how Fallout 76 got a price reduction in the first place.
---
Nope im aware of it one the reasons i thought eso was trash
---
Considering that Fallout 4 is basically Skyrim with guns, I'd say that it could've worked.
---
What morons. Anthem is from EA, same people responsible for the shitstorm at launch, Battlefront 2. Bioware has no business making live service games.
---
Morons are far too moronic to learn. That's why they foolishly part ways w/ their money far too easily.
---
And they deserve it for trusting EA again. They reap what they sow.
---
You are paying for a private experience not a private world that is running 24/7 when you are not logged in. You can’t log in, go to work, take the gf out on a date, see a movie, knock it out, and then come back and expect yer “private server” to be active. Quit crying people. If you want that to happen, call Bethesda, pay $1000 per month to OWN the server and you will be good.
---
Sorry I’m not trying to be a dick but it’s either play on the normal adventure mode/nuclear winter, pay for the service, or fucking quit and quit yer bitching. We get free updates, cool events, and not a bad game. Some people need to meet some friends/relationship in the real world, get off the PC/console, and live.
---
This subreddit’s a salt farm
---
Cool
---
Exactly. This is just like survival mode a vocal minority complained and left now those of us that love survival as is can enjoy it without them. These complainers will leave then the whole game can be enjoyed by the rest of us just like we enjoy survival now.
---
For attention?
---
It reached around 2.3 million on the PS4 alone:
---
[http://gamstat.com/games/Fallout\_76/](http://gamstat.com/games/Fallout_76/)
---
Short answer. No.
---
That's the story that developers happily push so people don't realize that it's gambling addicts and kids who are being taken advantage of. 
---
That's why the UK now has 2 government funded studies that BOTH say it's a public health issue.
---
Dude that is such an ignorant response. Bethesda has had one flop game. 76. I personally love it, but they screwed up this game. Besides that it's fine. Nintendo has  maybe 5 quality games and it's way larger than Bethesda.
---
&gt;almost heaven
---
Damn you, now i want a junk jet...
---
Been playing since BETA.  Put in a request yesterday for a refund from the Xbox store citing bait and switch sales tactics.  Not sure if they'll approve it since it's been a year, but it's worth a shot.
---
I'm genuinely worried about all future bethesda titles, especially the single player ones. I never played or bought Fallout 76 but I've been seeing all the news and keeping close tabs. Threads like this definitely bring up the worrying trend where they could tell us one thing for the next Elder Scrolls and when it releases make some season pass or put simple features behind paywall in a shop.
---
Skyrim Special Edition has dabbed lightly with the creation club but everyone was already accustomed to Skyrim so I don't think they would try to get away with too much, who knows what they will try in future Fallout and Elder Scrolls games though ...
---
Almost half of my time played was loading screens, server disconnects, and constant upkeep on the tedious crap they designed in the game.
---
I've spent HOURS in my camp trying to sacrifice 10 pounds of shit, because they wanna hold out on inventory space for their PAID SUBSCRIBERS
---
Please. This is the same as the car dealer throwing in floor mats for a car you both clearly know you paid too much for. Or the proverbial “lipstick on a pig”.
---
1b. Make beta access only 2 days. Don't offer anything in exchange but a chance to spend more money.
---
Ok yeah... I'm the only who pissed about this. Ermmmmmmmm
---
Don’t worry! We’ve heard you! Ammo mill is coming to the atom shop soon! Only 1650 atoms :)
---
My thoughts exactly.   They are messing with all of these different modes and a bit with team play but, beyond a few new events, they haven't added much in the way of content.
---
And while they have been adding new CAMP items, they keep making it harder to place and build CAMPs.  At least I could focus on building when bored but they have made that tedious rather than fun.
---
They probably came here after getting banned on the beth forum for talking smack about fo76 for the first time.
---
The fuck do you mean they're not comparable to fo3 and NV?
---
Fallout 3 and new Vegas REQUIRE mods to even be playable. Fallout 4 and skyrim do not.
---
You will never get a personnal server in the sense that you own it. Bethesda doesn't want people to turn it into a porn game and its an online game they want to have some control on it so you don't exploit it or do things they aren't comfortable with. This will never be a server like Arks unfortunately.
---
Gonna give it a shot myself! But dont have high hopes I guess.
---
So if this game keeps turning people off without attracting new players it will get shut down or be unsupported?
---
&gt;How dumb am I
---
Based on your grammar: Very
---
Facts, obviously hasn’t played the dozens of other games that cost money to rent servers.
---
To be honest I love fallout and when they gave me base building with multiplayer I was sold. I preorder it much to others dismay and had multiple characters to try different builds but after the constant bugs, crashes, loss materials, and so on I couldnt keep up with it. Was waiting for patches and especially for wastelanders to see what was offered with NPCs stories but then was told that was being pushed back till 2020. Finally this subscription service had me just officially tap out. I won't bad mouth those that still play because the game itself is still fun and better with friends. Personally I just couldn't do it anymore. Again to each their own.
---
If you get back on quick enough it has happened from my experience
---
I like exploring, collecting, crafting and shooting things. This one scratches all the itches. The post-nuke apocalypse combined with the retro-futurist design elements of the world are also extremely appealing to me. TBH its the game atmosphere that I enjoy the most. They fucked a lot of stuff up with this game but the world design is nice if you pay attention to the details. I'm a lvl 125 Vanguard/Junkie build with about 300 hours and many solo nukes launched but I still enjoy just wandering around the map with no real purpose.
---
For stealth i believe, lore has the US winning largely because they invented and heavily used power armour. The Chinese had developed better stealth technology though, that was stolen and attempted to be recreated but the best they got to was the Stealth Boy which was larger and inferior etc vs the Stealth Suit etc
---
yeah I agree. I misread the room. This was a shitpost. I used the word 'shit' twice as a dog whistle.
---
oh well, maybe next time.
---
Hiding. I'd say running and hiding, but none of those people seem like the physically active sort.
---
Fallout didn’t become what it is for it’s gunplay . If that’s what you want , there are so many better games
---
there is alot of hate for the things they are introducing because of pricing and quality. for example the fridge is 5 $ and its basically useless imo, the collectron is more useful, especially now that the stash is unlimited, but those are called pay for convenience, which is a form of pay to win model, especially in a game where you will take anything that makes it less grindy. hence why bethesda believes it to be popular. then there are things like the walls and floor skins that seem to be deliberately textured ugly so you spend atoms, which I get, but some things in the atom shop are super pricey, like PA skins are 14-21$+, which is why the cosmetic only model failed them, because people were not inclined to pay such steep prices. its the same with the subscription package, we were told it would cause server stability issues, yet now they are offering unlimited stash for the most hoarded items in the game, making the game even grindier for those who dont want to pay 100$ a year on top of our console subscription.
---
 we just cant support it when we paid up to 60$ ( 80$ Can for me) being promised a cosmetic only model, being shown placeable vendors in trailers, and a game that wasn't so riddled with bugs it crashes more times than not, even a year later. you have to be willingly pulling the wool over your eyes to not understand why many people have legit concerns as well as complaints with this game, even if they dont post. because the only real way to get something fixed is to either flood their ticket system with the 100's of bugs you see in an hour, or for it to be of benefit to the player, then its patched in days.
---
I dont know, but you can try a google search.
---
Nylon Bag*
---
The combat would be ass if they did.
---
Hell I would buy it again on pc just to personally mod it. I only purchased it on console when I realized they arent going to let people have access to it to mod it.
---
You know we'll never see 76 player count especially with the Fiasco's lol
---
*looks around to see whats broken* Well look at that, nothing...
---
Okay, this is the kind of comment I want to see. Somebody who handles criticism. No “fallout 76 is the best game in the universe.” No “remember to put spaces in your comments.” Just one simple, clear thing is said: “Ok”. No one else will do that in the coming comments.
---
Hard working players? Let's take a step back people. It's a video game not a coal labor camp.
---
Go to you're little server and eat a dick, while the community that actually cares about this game has a conversation.
---
We will call you out of your room when dinner is ready.
---
i was under the impression you had to be invited to the server.
---
From my brief tour as a journalist covering the industry, I can assure you that a) it is not like laying bricks and b) there are no 9-5 clock out and go home jobs in the games industry.
---
They should give everything free? Lmao someone has a sense of entitlement.
---
k bye
---
Maybe. They are a business and they want money, so once it becomes unprofitable, they may stop doing things with it
---
Yeah thats poor etiquette. At least ask in a message. Youll just get deleted and kicked. Id imagine.
---
Yeah, this is some bs Bethesda has pulled here. However, I still am going to stick around to see what wastelanders has to offer, as I think it would be quite a substantial improvement. I’m not going to just throw it all out yet. Yet.
---
it also may not surprise me
---
To be honest that's fine they will learn their lesson I'll be sad the game is gone but maybe they will make better games then and if not there is always other games out there
---
Well for that u getta upvote
---
Those pointy bits might just be 1st member exclusives..
---
yes if you block someone from session that is in your server they get kicked from it
---
They'll probably get the test servers. Oh wait
---
They didn't create a higher tier - they made everyone else 2nd class citizens.
---
Aww thanks! 😘
---
Neither have I. With the scrap box or private servers. So this is interesting that it's broken for a lot of peeps but not everyone. Usually when there is a glitch like this it affects everyone. 
---
*shrugs*
---
Oh, they listen to our ideas, they care. But that's why they place all the ideas our community has into their atomic shop and bundles for atomic points. Refrigerators,  for money. Ranger outfit, for money. New wallpaper and floors, money. They take what we want and make us pay for it. They are listening  and banking off of it.
---
I genuinely hope you enjoy it.
---
Works fine for me \*shrug\*
---
Won't disagree with you about a password option.
---
I was going to give the game another try, but with the latest Fallout 1st subscription "pay 2 win" *(It feels like pay 2 win to me at least)* system I felt it was far from the game I was hoping it to be. I'm sure I could enjoy the game without being a Fallout 1st member, but the grind would be way too much. So I have no idea right now...
---
Because it's fun and I still havent seen everything and theres still alot to do and I'm only1750 hours in so far .
---
This games been a rough go for sure but has made a come back regardless if you believe so... If you were to just start playing this game with all theyve added it feels like a whole game...bugs yes,but all games do and if you ever played fallout you have already agreed to bugs lol
---
Plus it's not an actual private server. It's a private game instance. Which is a completely different thing
---
**"Communist presence detected on AMERICAN soil."**
---
Wow 4chan did something right for a change
---
The reason for 8 people per server is because they plan to add expanded build budgets on those servers, and they wont be able to handle more than 8 camps doing that.
---
I actually fucking love that the Fallout First shit is bugged to hell. Because honestly, if you purchased it, that's exactly what you deserve. You're a blight on the industry for supporting this kind of nonsense and maybe you should go back to playing fucking FIFA games.
---
After all this, I'm probably not going to buy Starfield or ES6 because Bethesda has really shown their sheer incompetence on an extraordinary level.
---
how does that mean it's a lie lol
---
"Not to bright I see." 
---
Might want to think on that one for a bit homie.
---
They are technically not your world. You are not hosting it atm. And there's been reports that other players has join the " Private Server " just to find Mobs dead and places looted. Seem like you are just reusing others world when it's empty 🤷🏻‍♂️ can be wrong tho. 
---
And watch out for the scrap stash, that also has reports of ppl losing hundreds of junk when using it. So wait for an update there. 
---
Gl and hf
---
I paid for it, and the scrap box deleted my junk. Guess that’s what I get for supporting this company!
---
I got a bloodied explosive fixer last night, was just logging in to scrip the last of my legendaries from the sale event, salty as fuck about this subscription BS and the mole woman gave me that :/
---
oh I get it: anyone who doesn't agree with you is a 'shitpost'
---
get out of here, man.
---
It will never be illigal as fallout 76 was created for adults with adult restrictions same as ESO there both Adult games. To further that to play eather u need a bethesda account in witch you must fill out a contract. Witch also equils by law you need to be 18 or older.
---
Congrats for finally waking up. Takes a lot to admit you were wrong... and no, I'm not being sarcastic or facetious. It is admirable.
---
Yikes, came to read and it was removed the moment I opened it?
---
Did your queens drop any legendaries for you?  We did a couple queen runs yesterday on private and hot zero legendaries from her.  Wondering if it was just our luck
---
lol i don't need you to belive
---
Good on ya for taking the time to create the survey. 
---
Last question is a bit odd to me. Might make more sense to ask how many hours do you currently play per week.
---
Why are idiots paying for this? It's ridiculous at this point.
---
Thank you for a serious reply. Still feels wrong, but cant fight the EULA.
---
“if you ever played fallout you have already agreed to bugs lol”
---
There’s the problem. They have conditioned players like you to be ok with the shitty state they launch their games and leave them in. All the while they keep introducing microtransactions that people keep buying into and allowing them to keep making piss poor games.
---
you yourself said the subscription program is a joke. shouldve boycotted them to begin with. go buy Outer Worlds tomorrow you wont regret it
---
:D. Personally,  if I saw a sign saying "don't poke the bear", I would poke the bear.
---
There are lots of "bears" in here since yesterday.
---
I agree, I fully blame myself.  The game has had so much shit that I’ve put up with, and I STILL went out and bought a month of the stupidass subscription.  What do I get for it? A key feature of said subscription deletes all my junk.
---
It’s my fault entirely, but I really want others to learn from my mistake and stop playing.
---
Have an upvote my dear friend, no one deserves to be down voted for such a benign statement.
---
It’s great, since I’m hard working in the real world I can afford the private server for myself.
---
amen brother. buy Outer Worlds tomorrow instead. You won’t regret it.
---
people thinking about pumping money into this game certainly read reddit and social media though.
---
&gt;i seriously just paid a monthly fee for Bethesda 
---
Well there's your problem
---
Again, what does any of that have to do with *your personal enjoyment* of the game? Do you typically define your enjoyment by what other people spend their money on?
---
Eh those rage posts are generally justified in my opinion. Online a vocal minority will always take shit too far but eh I feel getting angry at them (and treating them like a majority) is a bad approach.
---
Then again I'm just bored at work as well
---
Mate, hate on bethesda all you want but don’t take joy in the fact that players lost their junk, that doesn’t effect Bethesda at all just the people who play the game, it’s a little sad that you take pleasure from it tbh.
---
Not to be a dick but...That's what blind faith gets you homie. Now let's set that aside and go play something fun together yeah?
---
You’re a fucking fool.
---
Pimpin ain't easy.
---
No, anyone on your friends list can freely join your private session.
---
To remind the sub that you idiots promoted this behavior from the start
---
I agree. The server I was on last night was pretty full for a Wednesday night. And five out of the six camps I visited on my quest to complete my comic book collections had the scrap box so....  I think most of these people are just haters from the early release of the game and basically Reddit versions of the girlfriend who keeps bringing up shit from the past. They'll keep repeatedly saying they're never playing again but yet next month we'll see the same people complaining about a new feature. If they quit playing the game how do you know about these features? And if they're just reading about them and regurgitating other people's opinions then that pretty much disqualifies them from the conversation anyways
---
It worked fine for me too! Until it didn’t. Overpriced subscription leading to getting fucked in-game. Bethesda’s amazing :)
---
I like the gameplay, and fallout-esque games are what I like. Its new content and plays like 4, which I like
---
Yes. They are supposed to be invite only.. but bgs mucked that one up aswell 🤦‍♂️
---
Yay! A post that wasn’t 100% pure sodium chloride!
---
Report trolls &amp; personal attacks? So you're only dealing with this passively?
---
I get you can't read every comment but are you even trying to actively look for these comments as well? Not hating, just curious.
---
Learn some self control
---
like i said go walk off a short pier your two cents are not worth the air they are spoken on.
---
Good to know, downloading new patch now!
---
Sorry about that, it's actually u/jesteraegis7. I hope I spelt that right.
---
funny thing is the "hard working people" have jobs.  it's time vs money.
---
they are culling that sub from criticism. At least this sub lets us  vent and rant.
---
(note: I sub to both and love both, but FC is being washed with a soapy sponge right now).
---
Incorrect as WoW requiers a sub to play.
---
I still playing too. Although that I had contact with strangers on the stars... from outer worlds, but man the space is scary so I'll stay on West Virginia mountain mama a little more, heck I maybe still forever
---
They Did, but they were all 1-2 \* pieces of garbage (I was also delving into the Charlie Day esque theory that they stealth boosted the legendary drops rates on private worlds for the first day, but doesn't seem the case atleast with us) but they did spawn. The third one since I had to rejoin on the server took about 2 full minutes for the legendary to spawn in after she died.
---
No one cares what you think.
---
I was one of the first 8k people on this sub, three weeks pre E3. 
---
I never bought the game because its multiplayer online, which means an extra fee for console users. 
---
I stayed subscribed here to see when private servers would launch. Because that's when I would have bought in. Now I find that it's yet another fee to play alone. 
---
I'll gladly pay $60 when I can play a private server. But I refuse to pay any type of monthly fee.
---
1year at max and this game is dead and no more content after wl. It hurts so much but i going to uninstall
---
Oh it's already happening a few on this sub are calling anyone against this "Entitled"
---
Pretty sure the best way to keep it alive is to have more comments exchanged, I could be wrong though.
---
For sure, I was gonna get it anyway! Now I’m even more excited to try it :D
---
Also, BL3 is dope too, especially if you have a couple of good friends to run through it with!
---
Bethesda also doesnt care what you think
---
No I don't ..im just not going to pretend buying a game is the same as buying a microtransaction
---
Yep i purchased then immediately cancelled. I want that sweet atom deal! Im already going to buy atoms so its a good deal for me
---
Ive beaten and have been loving BL3!
---
They said themselves at E3 that they shipped an unfinished product that they intend to finish. Ergo your $60/80/100/120 supposedly paid for it.
---
Same here, I loved the fact that I was able to play my favorite game with my friends. But they all left due to all bugs and other reasons. Sadly I don't enjoy grinding that much, but I do like to hoard random junk.
---
Like the same people that whine about Amazon bad, yet order 1 day shipping from their Amazon Ultra Prime account.
---
So is Zenimax
---
Well, that's an enlightened statement. 
---
Oh oh! I got one...  Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something. - Plato
---
Not sure you're living your life, but I started before 87 and I'm in the very beginning of my 40s and in great shape.  I think you're jumping the gun just a bit.
---
For someone who doesn't give a shit you sure felt the need to post about it.
---
It's wrong to be called names or given shit about buying a product. With that said, it is very disheartening to hear people are actually shelling out money for this.
---
Pretty please with sugar bombs on top!
---
Heed this dude’s warning; remove your shit from it until they fix it.
---
Wasn't the fact that weapons didn't degrade in 4 a major issue players had?
---
Wasn't it another rpg element that was cut from 4 that was in 3 and NV?
---
if you're happy to pay $100 a year, you do that. but you were lied to. bethesda said that it would all be free.
---
Chris had no involvement with Fallout 1, only wrote for NV and designed only the expansions. And was only 1 of the game designers for Fo2.
---
Saying he is responsible for any of the games is very incorrect.
---
You're getting downvoted for giving a personal experience. That's how salty the sub is right now.
---
I don’t know what they need to be profitable but there is plenty of evidence that players are leaving this game. Getting closer to not being profitable every day.
---
Three time's the charm eh? Didn't work the last two times they tried, but it might this time right?
---
Once you move out of mommy and daddy's basement you might understand why not everyone can spend an absurd amount of money on a game they already paid for
---
Aaannnd the post is gone.
---
That’s agile development...
---
“Oh god not the teddies”
---
If I had coins you’d have gold. Lol
---
Had I been able to reply to the person before they deleted theirs, it would have shown that I know what I bought. It’s private worlds that cannot be joined unless the host adds them. That’s pretty private to me. 
---
We didn’t get exactly the thing we wanted from it, but I’m gonna make the most out of what was given cause I just like to play video games.
---
It’s pay to solve an I game problem that cant be solved without paying.
---
Items breaking was a thing in either FO3 or FNV, possibly both, but even then, the weapons held up far longer then than they do now.
---
Well I’m not bitching about Bethesda. Your opinion is useless if you don’t play. Bye bye now.
---
Obsidians track record is buggy half finished games and them blaming the publishers while a devoted fanbase blindly thinks the devs have done more than they actually have.
---
I feel you, but well "fool me once shame on you fool me 10 times I probably have a mental disability." Or something like that.
---
WoW was always a subscription game, it was made and sold as a subscription game, Fallout 76 was supposed to be nothing but free content after the original price (aside from ATOM cosmetics).
---
Appreciate this a lot. This subreddit has been toxic as fuck since the game's inception in the adverse of the r/Fallout subreddit. Both were bad, this one was just toxic in an optimistic way. Supporting the nonsense that Bethesda has been doing, pretending there are no bugs with the game, acting as if the Atomic Shop was totally fine and warranted. I hope a lot of the people parroting this nonsense have seen the error of their ways. It's disrespectful what this company has been doing to this franchise. I was all on board, I tried for months playing the game, streaming it, trying to get others to play but seriously fuck Bethesda after this. They deserve all the ire they've received and so much more.
---
They just arent going about it right, instead of fixing the game to improve sales, they are pushing out more things you can buy on top of the game cost. I mean, 5 dollars for a hair style that they have had laying around since 4, thats just shameless money grabbing.
---
A great example is what no mans sky did, love it or hate it, it has redeemed itself and re-boomed for a while despite being an even smaller team, and it relied on game sales, not even an in game store.
---
&gt;you can unlock forsaken by grinding
---
Wait, say what now? What do you need to do to unlock Forsaken? I've been farming some bright dust but unlike Atoms it seems only for cosmetics (and well slightly faster sparrows ).
---
Whoa.... hold on there partner... I am guessing you have not met our man there reddit trending rep\*cough\* I mean Forbes senior gaming contributor Mr Paul Tesalarrrattiii? If he writes on it... it's been trending on reddit for a couple hours already.  
---
In all seriousness, he actually writes decently but I have rarely ever seen him regurgitate something that I hadn't just read on reddit a few hours prior. That said, I enjoy his articles. Sometimes he really gets fanbois upset :-)
---
Damnit. Now I really want to get FO:3 running and play it.
---
I agree with alot of what you're saying but there is a lot of people (myself included) that will miss out because of the pay walls. I mean, I'm admitadly poor. I scrapped pennies together to buy the game because I'm a massive fan of their work. I played it, loved it but then my Xbox live ran out, so I've been saving pennies for the last few months to buy that. Now theyre releasing a subscription that is literally well outta my price range (and I know I don't 'need' the subscription but no one wants to play a game at a complete disadvanatge.)....  I just miss the days where I didn't have to skip meals to play a game I really want to play. I know most people can afford the £100 a year but my priorities lead me to spending that money else where. It's not Bethesda's fault because they need their money, I just suppose alot of people just moan because they simply can't afford it. And in all honesty it's one the most pricey subscriptions I've seen with very little included.
---
We almost never have to time look outside of reports because once we clear the queue it gets refilled immediately. Reporting someone is the best way we have of seeing something so we can take the necessary action, at least until this starts to slow down.
---
People were like this back with kits oof
---
He did work with a number of people who *did* work on Outer Worlds, though. Y'know, friends. Also I believe he has some fondness for Obsidian, even though he's no longer there.
---
Sorry for all of you. All i can say is ill happily take all of your things if you leave the game.
---
I'm now convinced that Bethesda is using 76 as an experimental polygon for questionable ideas. Whatever sticks and gets good/acceptable reception, will be tweaked and added to the next Elder Scrolls. Whatever sucks and gets bad reception, will be appreciated as a feedback and a way to keep people talking about Bethesda.  With 76 any publicity for Bethesda is good publicity because it keeps being a relevant topic (and people who would've considered leaving have already left), no matter how bad the issue is because the game itself is a dead horse and is kept around mostly because of the Atomic Shop and LiVe SeRvIcE. ~~Also, the fewer players there are on the servers, the better servers are handling those players, which means that those players are more likely to enjoy the game and because of it more likely to buy more mtx to support the developer who clearly works hard~~ (sarcasm) ~~to improve "server-having-to-handle-too-many-players" issues~~.
---
hey , it's right below your favorites wheel when you bring it up , you'll see a option of T for tent and you can place it just like you place a camp . hope that helps a bit
---
**Community**: "I've got this great idea for how to make this game not suck!"
---
\*Bethesda pinches a loaf into your mouth\*
---
**Community:** "Why would you do that? Here, listen to this:\*

---
The difficulty of certain regions is to incentivize you to spend more time doing misc activities to level up more, thus resulting in a longer storyline
---
Well said!
---
I'll need to in order to make room for Outer Worlds, so whatever.
---
That’s a little over the top.
---
Then again, what would anybody expect from a dunce?
---
yes, but some wastlanders at their have gotten their junk stolen by the worst raider out there! he goes by the name of todd howard.
---
No they didn't. ESO runs on a slightly modified Hero Engine. The full release version of the same engine that's running Star Wars The Old Republic.
---
The worlds are still bumping so either some of these people are liars saying they are done or there is a lot more players than I realized.
---
youre the braindead consumer that Bethesda loves. There are already reports of Scrapboxes deleting everyones scrap. youre a sucker
---
lol, then you are not working hard enough.
---
Well, we have you to thank for them making these shitty decisions. The more people that buy and support their predatory transactions, the worse they get. You and other whales are ruining the game industry for everyone else. They do this because of how well it works. Not trying to demean you in any way, but this is the fault of people that support them.
---
Anyone paying for anything FO76 is a definable idiot of the  highest order and the biggest reason for games beginning to suck as they succumb to what could eventually be a 100% microtransaction mobile game on PlayStation kind of world
---
Facts. Just take a look on all lvl 2s coming out of the Vault 76. Go ask them and see that most, and I mean MOST, are just mules. There's almost no new players coming since the free week, and all this shitshow just days before The Outer Worlds launch certainly isn't helping...
---
That's a relief. I was beginning to worry that either you were being seriously ripped off or that I'd somehow found a loophole to pay less and would one day end up with an enormous bill from Microsoft.
---
Bye Felicia
---
So content created by people who are not part of the company making the promise? No way are mods content
---
But now they have your money and know this predatory shit works. So they'll keep doing it. Congrats.
---
Guess you've just been brainwashed to think everything is fine, even if it deletes all your junk or isn't actually private
---
Oh yeah you nailed it Dude.  It's 'two girls - one cup' over here when it comes to Bethesda...  
---
Thank you for your feedback.
---
All of your recent comments have been so shitty dude. You act like you're either a paid shill or you work on the game and made this Reddit account just to defend Bethesda. You talk to people like they're pieces of shit so I think you're a piece of shit.
---
Are there enough of them for BGS to keep people on this project and not shift them elsewhere? I have my doubts. Either way I’d prefer this game had a huge active player base as opposed to a few OG whales.
---
Nope. No one did. Unions, what can I say. But it was a time when people actually had the balls to fight for what was right and werent afraid to bleed. You wouldn't get it.
---
OMG ppl keeps bringing up the cost and that's not my gripe or the problem for most intelligent gamers of the community at all i would pay for this if i felt it was fair. The fact that they lock game changing mechanics behind a paywall is not ok under any circumstances. All they had to do is give atoms and private servers for the subs, add the emotes and armor to the atom shop and give everyone the stash and tent especially since its what all of us wanted and then to charge for a mechanic that was inspired by community suggestions that's a clear slap in the face. So i appreciate your stance but ultimately your fundamental point is wrong we are not mad about being charged for the sub we are mad at how now the game treats paying players differently than non paying players and brings a big imbalance between both.
---
Maybe it's time for Bethesda to cut ties with Zenimax.
---
omg i can smell that tato imperium. this is truly p2w.
---
I agree. This is desperately needed at this point.
---
 Oh good, I had just finished laughing from yesterday's escapades.
---
...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Except Monster Hunter World. That's the one live service game that actually delivered.
---
&gt; Bonus fallout nv isnt technically a bethesda game...so no guilt there lol
---
No no reason for anyone to feel guilt about buying  a video game.   I don't think anyone should.  I'm just disgusted right now to the point where the mere sight of the name Bethesda  anywhere on the game turns my stomach.   I might get passed this eventually. As you said, there's some games that are still worth playing.   But honestly, I'm thinking of just picking up Outer Worlds and putting all things Bethesda on the back burner for a while.
---
I think you misread the part where it says all free
---
Buy? I get that shit free on Xbox and Game Pass. It is also like 25 hours long, so maybe good for a few days.  I will play it for sure but such a short game is meh and they also really didn't listen to much to their fans making tOW.
---
Just got a friend request and then it disappeared..
---
Edit: found him, he has them!
---
Is it less rude if I join a private server uninvited where I know my camp can't be placed and then stayed crouched the entire time I am there in hopes that you don't notice me?
---
Grow up bro.  Quit being a bitch and get a life.
---
Are we saying I’m handsome Daddy Todd Howard or that OP is handsome Daddy Todd Howard?
---
screen shots
---
I notice no difference and I have a really expensive headset. Probably more than what you have.
---
This is priceless.
---
Tragically agree.
---
be like the rest of us and sign up for Microsoft Game Pass for PC (beta) for $1 this month and download The Outer World's...profit!
---
Totally agree.
---
When I read about the private servers I believe it said that a 'block' SHOULD kick someone from your server.  Not as simple as a kick option but possibly a workaround until there is one.
---
Duh
---
Sellout? Grow up. It's called working for a company. Clearly you haven't worked in industry yet.
---
When they decided to call it “Fallout.”
---
And it still a shitty practice that should be called out.  I don't really see your point.
---
Server can only have 7 people.
---
PS Store will refund anyone who made a purchase yesterday or today, just so you know it's an option.
---
Such a nothing response. 
---
And very telling you cant refute any of my points. 
---
They shouldn’t be making anyone pay for this half baked subscription. You’re getting scammed but can’t or won’t see it.
---
If you won't get a subscription to it, don't fuckin ask someone else to. Be real.
---
That’s fair, I thought I was taking it at a decently slow clip, I’ve been doing the side quests that pop up minus the continuation of the side quest that has you logging in to the terminals to get the missions(it’s like the first side quest they give you, I’m really sorry I don’t remember the name I’m still fairly new to the map and names of stuff and I can’t play atm)
---
I’ll go wandering around for some side quests when I can
---
Dude shouldn't have to play the old fucking games. He should be able to enjoy this one without worry what Bethesda will do next.
---
 **\[PC\] Players reporting problems purchasing the "Fallout 1st" membership.**   
---
Are you sure that's not a feature?
---
Are WE not allowed to voice our opinion and expose foul business practices without you feeling personally attacked?
---
Because these decisions likely aren't made by Bethesda but by Zenimax themselves, for one thing.
---
Conditions people like YOU to talk smack lol as if there forcing you to buy stuff have self control then buddy
---
They never said private servers were going to be free
---
I don't agree with a lot of the fo1st model but at least know what you're talking about if you're going to criticize something
---
I'll defend it with a question - be honest.  How much did you spend in atoms last year?
---
Open world is a part of Fallout and may be the most important aspect to you but to tell others their wrong for their comparison is bold. What you believe to be the most important part of a franchise doesn't make it universal. There are plenty of similarities between the two games.
---
I’m guessing this is a troll?
---
I'd probably try to level up into the mid 20's before milling around there too much unless you sneak in and out. Take your time with the main quest because it will send you into areas that you aren't ready for early on. Stay in the forest and grind some levels by taking workshops. You'll also learn a lot of plans that way.
---
You'll notice I only refer to it as 76. Lol
---
If you're on xbox change your region to NZ and you can play. I played all morning.
---
Fallout 4 VR is still broke
---
Its like they are trying to squeeze the most money with the least amount of work.
---
I like it. I love Fallout and this game satisfies that itch. Plus I like the online and survival aspects. Makes for a unique experience.
---
8 if the host is also going to PvP
---
K bud goodbye. You are just a toxic waste of life looking to get a rise out of someone. Buh bye now.
---
Simple. Its fun and I enjoy it.
---
Yeah, I dont care that the private servers cost. It makes sense. They are a business.  But... the junk box being unlimited. That's what gets me a little riled up. For months, we as a community have asked for more room in our stash boxes.  The answer were given was, server stability.  Now, you can purchase it. This should be something all players can access for free. This was a crap move. I paid for the month mainly for the outfit and to see what playing on a server with just my friends was like. Its honestly amazing.  I cleared out 400 pounds in my stash box just from junk. Doesn't seem fair that everyone else doesn't get that option. Bad move on BGS part.
---
I feel you mate. I think you and I are on the same page at this point. I was totally hocked at the fact that we were able to build our own base and play with our friends. I wanted this since Fallout 3 was released. But as you said, all the bugs and other shit scared most of my friends away and I was left all alone in the wasteland.  
---
I gave up on the game but hoped that BGS would fix all the issues so that I could jump back in later on. But with the Fallout 1st subscription bs I feel that the game isn't really worth it. *If only they would spend time working to fix the bugs and issues instead of trying to find new ways to grab more money from their customers.*
---
What? Do you want me to go back in time before I knew this was going to happen and take screenshots of my filled scrap box and send the before and after you you?
---
I hope you can read that and see what’s wrong there.
---
Just a heads up, if you're on xbox you can change your region to NZ and play today. I played all morning before work.
---
No, the last several games that got progressively worse and have finally become comically bad.
---
Not only do I not have a student debt, I don't pay *anything* to my uni! (Who knew being a good student and actually studying instead of insulting others on the Internet had its perks, right?) My fees are all waived, and I get a stipend that lets me live comfortably. I *just started* grad school! It was the same in college, because guess what, college education system is not as fucked as the US in all countries! And at grad level, because of your fucked system, US institutes have no choice but to pay and hire other students from foreign countries because students in the US, like you, just sit and make snide comments from their mom's basement!
---
In summary, I have zero debt of *any* kind, and a comfortable salary and savings that I choose to spend on better things. I spent some on Fallout 76 when I felt it was good enough for me, and now I choose not to anymore.
---
You can put that tongue back in your mouth now.
---
It’s not like Bethesda is broke. And if they wanted more money maybe they should have made a quality game
---
Your son's friends cannot join unless you are friends with them as well-- a message will popup for them stating they must be friends with the server host.
---
Lvl 24s, youre lucky they werent 68s in all honesty thats about right for that area. You'll have to get lvl 15 weapons and start working on upgrades now and playing to your build. Being stealthy also helps try to avoid fights if possible. Let 2 enemies fight and you can run in for the objective. I did alot of that around those levels.
---
So what it sounds like is happening is that the match making software dumps you into an empty server instance and then locks the instance to “invite only” based on your friends list or whoever is in your party at logon.
---
So basically they tweaked the match making code and that’s it. They’re not giving you private anything. You’re paying $13 a month for recycled content or in this case server instances.
---
Typical Bethesda bullshit.
---
More players. This subreddit is the minority of overall player count. People just seem to think they’re the majority
---
I won’t know if anyone wants if I don’t ask.
---
Simple fix, just do something that auto saves the game Fast travel, drop a bullet, open your normal stash there is a lot of options.   
---
Yes though for those that scarp and bail this issue should not have gone live and a hotfix should happen posthaste, we are subscribers now after. We can demand more including refunds.
---
Gaming "journalism". Wow. That was easy to dismiss them.
---
Fucking yes, so much yes. And I bet he didn't even read the fucking post.
---
They should have used maltballs then
---
Private servers are not content. That's absurd. 
---
The content is hosted on the server. How is it content?
---
The content is hosting the content?
---
Bull. Fucking. Shit. 
---
Servers are not content. Call a server hosting company. Tell them your like to rent some content, and they'll ask you "What the fuck are you talking about"
---
Not YET. Just you wait another update or two...
---
You + 7 people I'm pretty sure.
---
My gf got me to start up a month or so ago.  And I have to admit it wasn’t as bad as I expected.  I’ve made it to lvl 105 or so.  She’s played since beta, skipped work and everything to play it. 
---
But neither one of us even want to update the game now.  We’re going to find a new game to play together, like Outward.
---
It definitely isn’t, unless the person correcting them insults them or something. I didn’t.
---
The content part would be. 1 wastelanders. The tadpole thing. Events. That is content
---
you better share friend
---
It wouldn't make sense for Wastelanders to be part of Fallout 1st, considering the atomic shop and Fallout 1st are implemented to fund these expansions. I know that's not as clear as I mean for it to be, but if they were going to charge for DLC, they wouldn't need the atomic shop or Fallout 1st.
---
Our Wallet is now four times the size of Fallout 4
---
Your lose my guy
---
The best spot is the level 30+ Charleston Capitol building. Sometimes you don't get any (more rare than not). And its filled with mostly level 68 ghouls and you can server hop for them all to respawn
---
Bet you $100 someone set a deadline for “day the bombs dropped” and then ignored all advice to the contrary.
---
The game has as variety of different endings is meant to be replayed 3-4 times at least to experience everything. Choices have heavy consequences. Its not a vapid sandbox like 76 ur right
---
Sure, ignore MY comment, in which I pay 12.99 and a feature in the thing that I paid 12.99 for deletes hours of my hard earned work
---
Private servers are coming later, we just have to figure out how to monetize it first.
---
"That's right vault dwellers, you and your friends can loot to your hearts content, across an entire game world, as part of our Overseer's package, and the low low price of 14...99...99...95."
---
Fuck this game.  Outer Worlds is out at 9 on the west coast.
---
Well said.  What's frustrating to me is Bethesda's willingness to work on projects that no one really wants and ignoring the main player base.  The NW battle royale mode, the survival server, etc.  I would venture a guess that most players just wanted more content in adventure mode.  More nuke-able areas that spawn bosses, more weapons and armor plans, faction items and quests, Ever Upwards progression, larger camp budget, improved trading mechanics, better raids and better rewards, etc. 
---
About atom shop stuff....why aren't they flooding the store with cosmetic stuff every few days?  Price them at 100-150 atoms a pop and people would buy the hell out of them.  I wouldn't be upset if the larger more elaborate items cost a bit more, but the simple stuff should be cheap.  Why they waited nearly a year to release handmade skins boggles my mind.  Where are the Tesla skins? The combat shotgun, the combat rifle, the 10mm, lever action, etc.  They could have come up with dozens of varieties for each.  Hell all I really wanted was Responder swag for my camp.  I got a shotgun skin and a power armor skin.....wtf
---
About private servers.....I don't want a private server that isn't persistent. I don't want a private server that I can't control who enters. The QOL stuff should be offered to everyone and the cosmetic stuff should be atom shop exclusive.  
---
If I could have a workshop or camp that stayed in the game all the time it might be fun to build up huge settlements.  It might be nice to avoid toxic players and play at your own pace.  None of this was implemented...
---
Have an up-vote for a positive post.
---
hahaha okay ignore my completely valid point
---
Joined? They've been releasing broken games for years now because fans will do their work for them. Fallout 76 exposed their incompetency.
---
 It most certainly can with a little bit of discipline and inventory management.  The unlimited scrap stash is certainly an advantage, but not nearly as insurmountable as people complain.
---
what do ya live in a barn
---
It might take a bit of time for these to get established but they'll be around soon - I heard from a friend on some.of the discord channels that the PvP community is trying it out and figuring out the logistics. Try r/fo76_pvp and keep looking though it may take a few days
---
You got to remember zos launched ESO  vs bethesda who stll has to learn the ropes its still a baby that came from making single player games.
---
Honestly I never found it anywhere near as bad as people claim, but figured I'd include it for informative purposes lol
---
Glad to hear it, I hope you have fun :)
---
"This 13 dollars also gets me..." so it's just about you defending your purchase? No need to do that, if you enjoy it, simply enjoy it. 
---
However if you think having to now compare Bethesda practices to that of Rockstar makes it better? That is a pretty low bar and standard.  It is Rockstar after all that after generating over $500million in MTX on GTAVs 3rd year in service that did and will forever impact and effect the industry. All that said... Rockstar never pretends to be your buddy... And besides delivery amazing games, not many are ever gonna say that Rockstar is not a predatory when it comes to MTX and in fact it's a very common complaint and people bitch about it constantly. 
---
They have also done a great job though... their last two major MTX machines... GTAV and now RDR2... offered a complete and basically MTX free single play game that you bought, which offsets peoples complaints about a "FREE" online game they got that has cost associated. 
---
So until I get FO76 the complete single player edition at no additional cost from what I already paid, and then FO76 Online as free with associated cost... hard to really compare them. or Say they are even close to similar in the realms of sanity.
---
respectable
---
I'm pretty sure you can't. Read the eula.
---
Gotcha it’s 7pm EST (us) for me
---
So you do admit that it *is* an advantage? Good, at least you are making progress.
---
Wouldn’t be for free... I said I’d gladly pay for it.
---
Anywhere really, although you'll find they have a higher level in the Cranberry Bog.
---
Seriously. What a bunch of assholes.
---
Getting it tonight due to early release
---
Nail on head...
---
But does the level of anger actually match what was done? Let's be real here, in terms of actual Damage Done to actual people Bethesda is still on the mild side. Yet they're treated like one of the worst offenders. I may just be something of a consequentialist but when your usual run-of-the-mill milquetoast greed is getting this kind of vitriol something's off
---
People are mad, it must be the consumers fault! Did I find Todd Howard's reddit account?
---
&gt; Looks around at my camp...
---
Yes?
---
No, I think this was a purposeful choice to dump controversial information at an opportune time. Here’s the scenario I see: 
---
Wastelanders delay, changes to the Atomic Shop, Fallout 1st—all controversial and all dropping in the days leading up to Outer Worlds. They know the media window on this will be short because coverage will jump when Outer Worlds comes out. Everybody plays it, washes the taste of controversy out of their mouths. 
---
January comes. No big game releases, people are wearing out on OW. Bethesda drops new trailers and gameplay for Wastelanders. It looks good (at least that’s the hope). Oh, by the way, it’s coming out next week. (Or was ready the whole time, they just pushed it to get it away from OW)
---
Gasp! Fans are pleasantly surprised they didn’t have to wait until March. There’s nothing else to play so why not check it out? The bar is so low for 76 by now that as long as it works people will love it. Everybody forgets everything they were mad about. 
---
Until a few months later when Bethesda repeats the whole cycle over again, because they just don’t ever learn.
---
IGN critiquing a major game developer/publisher is pretty damn rare
---
Given the amount of people asking, I would think someone would just contact an attorney to ask. I mean, at this point it would be one helluva large class action lawsuit if it fit the parameters.
---
"Side project" doesn't mean jack. Stop using it as an excuse to justify poor handling. It's not even a side project. It's a spinoff. It's all they've made in 8 years.
---
They openly walked back on that about a month before repair kits. If they decide to make future expansions paid, there will be signs. I doesn't make sense to have all these in game monetization methods (well, 2) if not to fund the DLC at no further cost.
---
Yeah that’s kinda what I thought
---
It's only £100+ if you wanna pay for the whole year in one go, it's like £12 for a month. Not sure about exchange rates
---
Yeah I got it to now I can have a private server with me and my friends. And I spend money on games anyway so I'm not to worried about it.
---
Haven't read the many things about how Bethesda is starting up a stupid subscription plan? You need to read up, friend, it's really fucking funny, and tragic, and just downright maddening all at the same time.
---
dont put yourself down! you are doing an excellent job at being an asshole. we can tell you have practiced.
---
As understanding as i try to be to both sides, this is 100% true, and expertly written at that. how can they be so careless? like really? i feel like something like this, ya know locking up your site or whatever so others cant access it and write whatever the fuck they want, is basic "we are putting something on a site on the internet"shit. i just.. i dont even know anymore, im really starting to believe Todd just has a bunch of monkeys running around doing the work for the cheap labor.
---
It's still a rather "eh, it's fine" game. It's not bad, but not magnificent either, fun for a while. Once modded, and if you like roleplaying though, there are a plethora of compelling options thanks to a lot of cool mods (as long as you avoid the servers focused on "conflict" which often means PvP-only, and the usual weird erotic servers).
---
I mean, they run soooo much smoother and you can always place your camp. It’s really good for just being in a server with friends and not having to worry about normal server issues.
---
Why defend a company that doesnt care about you at all
---
The bulk of fallout first \*IS\* the private servers.  A one time payment doesn’t make sense for a subscription.  
---
You need to break the subscription down and argue about the things that are the issue and leave the things that make sense under the subscription (the servers) alone.
---
Hood to know.  Just our luck then.
---
Bwahahahahaha awesome
---
You dont *have* to pay for a broadband and PSN subscription, you could spend that money on something else like maybe books
---
Agile is a way of developing software. It’s the current best practice across industries.
---
Awesome, thanks! Looking forward to the list of acceptable costume pieces, you guys rock.
---
Do you need to talk to someone? Lol
---
If you were stupid enough to pay for this, you 100% deserve it, as this is exactly the kind of “quality” service this company puts out now. 
---
But hey, at least for $99 you got an emoji dedicated to you, right?
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Oof! Yokes Forever.
---
I'd honestly prefer private private worlds not recycled non used. If I run a collector I don't want to get crapped on if server drop or power d/c. 
---
Disappointed but not surprised. Bethesda doesn't test their shit and release alpha. 
---
Still play. But not going to sub till likely 3-6 months later when this is patched
---
I agree completely.  I blame only myself for paying despite all the signs that I should not.  I’m just hoping others can see and do the same as I have by quitting!
---
I think the price is for two subscriptions maybe I’m wrong tho.
---
You used the barn walls, didn't you? lol
---
Takes a while ro see all the comments cant snwer them all and your right that sucks need to fix it but im still happy with outcome
---
You’re absolutely wrong and completely biased. Its quite hilarious.
---
Oh man, I wonder why these comments are so crappy, huh? Maybe because the universal consensus is that this is a terrible, scummy tactics by Bethesda, and yet there are still people like you that support them? Why do you do this? Stop, unsubscribe and uninstall. Stop supporting shitty devs that just want your money.
---
I uninstalled. Definitely not going to participate in some bullshit two-tier P2W system where who knows what else is going to be pay-gated. I paid full price at launch for an early access game, then waited patiently for the rest of the game to be fixed and fleshed out. It was getting better -- I started playing again last month after a six-month hiatus. I was getting excited about the promise of Wastelanders. But now? I'm out. I'm going to think twice about buying another Bethesda game.
---
Take all my upvotes. You speak the truth. The ridiculous stash situation is pure inconvenience by design. To offer a solution to that for money is a massive middle finger to players.
---
"scrapebox"...apparently a completely appropriate spelling
---
mmm.... borken.
---
Oooh edgy.
---
If you bought this garbage you deserve to get screwed over by Bethesda for not voting with your wallet.
---
Poor lost souls, you gullible fools.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
No problem with that dog, i definitely binged it very hard.
---
Was there another beside a switch? "Turn the lights off; you're wasting electricity!"
---
Fuckin A
---
Knowing Bethesda it's only a matter of time
---
You post in a sub for a game you don’t play at all
---
Good. 
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
The problem it solves is scrap inventory management.
---
Ahh fair enough. You came across as more aggressive to me than I think you meant to for whatever reason. Hard to tell that kind of thing online sometimes
---
It’s $12/month, $100/year in the states. Which seems kinda weird as I’m pretty sure $12 =/=£12
---
You don’t have to subscribe you know- your experience will be unaffected.
---
Receives one troll message asking for paid content... “SEE GUYS THEY WANT PAYED CONTENT”
---
Do the Mothman dance.
---
The last Bethesda product I bought was Fallout 4, and with people rewarding Bethesda for regressing as a games developer, it'll probably be the last Bethesda product I ever buy. They've lost their way, the games they make are buggy cash-grabs, and if you don't have the willpower to vote with your wallet and say "no" to them, then you're part of the problem. Enjoy your $99 "premium" subscription, I really mean that. GLHF
---
If that's the case then why are you even in this subreddit? If you enjoy anything fallout then at least support the developers who make the games and ignore their marketing team.
---
this makes sense, i deleted a lot of crops in my camp to gain budget and then installed the scrapbox and they magically appeared there ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
---
That’s what people get for continuing to support Bethesda and not voting with their wallet.
---
Lol dude not ignoring is alot of comments ur right junk lose should not happen.
---
Is not giving a shit about paid features fanboying?
---
Yes.  Yes, we're to blame.  We obviously dressed too provocatively.
---
Yup the horse skin armor was just ahead of his time and now gets to yell at people; "TOLD YOU PEOPLE WOULD DO IT!!! TOLD YOU!!! THAT WAS MY IDEA!!!"
---
Give them a month's ~~gold~~Fallout1st.
---
It can't even lock it to invite only. People are reporting that anyone on their friends list can join without invitation
---
Maybe if we give them a lot of money, the game and monetization problems will go away?
---
You disagree?
---
SO many people don't understand this, and enough people don't care that it'll never stop, ad infinitum.
---
Just quit.. got tired of wandering that place aimlessly, not finding anything to do.
---
Played since beta as well, bought on launch.
---
What is your level? Some places, such as West Tek won't spawn max level enemies unless you are 70+ for some reason.
---
Otherwise, the following route gets me a decent number of legendaries with 20% chance for a 3\* drop: Watoga EMS, Huntersville, Parking lot NE of the investigator's shack, West Tek, National Isolated Radio Array, RobCo, Harper's Ferry, Crevasse Dam, Dyer Chemical.
---
I heard that AUS $ and euros get a worse deal despite exchange rates too
---
There’s no free option in 76
---
Have you tried any of these things?  It sounds pretty pointless, but who knows. 🤷‍♂️
---
They had singleplayer at all. That alone was a step up from 76...
---
Where you "win" is with time. The more convenience items you have, the less time you need to spend doing maintenance tasks like junk runs, repair weapons etc. Which means more time getting XP, caps, loot &amp; legendaries.
---
This doesn't mean that much now but introduce a better PvP system &amp; the prestige level system &amp; you watch how much of a difference these items make. You won't be able to compete if you don't pay until you hit the effective level ceiling like where we're at now. Won't be able to level as fast, get legendaries as fast, store as many legendaries to scrip later for a chance at better legendaries.
---
Pete Hines should have been fired ages ago. His ideas are so bad they border on sabotage. Any other industry and he would have been canned. He owes his job to nepotism.
---
You make me fucking sad. you should feel bad for enabling this garbage fucking company.
---
I think if you reach an XP threshold you unlock the Reef And the moon
---
Yes, I do remember, because this sub keeps skull fucking it into everyone's heads.
---
Predicted this at release. FTFY
---
Yea, I saw someone last night saying the price in Australia was around $175 US
---
ESO ONE OF THE BEST MMOS OUT THERE AND TONS OF CONTENT AND POLISHED NO CRASHES ETC NO BUGS
---
That's kind of a crappy thing to say. They're doing their jobs or the company will find someone else who will. It's not like Joe Schmoe out on the coding floor walked into the Todd's throne room and pitched this grandiose idea, and in turn Todd waived his hand and this idea manifested from the cosmological background radiation of the universe.
---
If they want to charge for unlimited stash they should've made it flat cost instead of shitty $12 membership
---
I think I'll keep playing.
---
They should just let you get it for free. Contact them and say you love them and you are one of the few that likes their Fallout 76 creation. I hope you enjoy it! :)
---
Oof! Yikes Forever.
---
People have the freedom to buy what they want my guy. Don't get mad at people for not playing along with your boycott, remember a lot of us are already boycotting Blizzard. Besides, most of us continue to play knowing there will be continuous content updates
---
Its not false advertising.  You got what you paid for.
---
They announced publicly that the original idea would not work going forward, so they had to revise how the franchise worked. 
---
Then they created entirely new to Fallout 76 content, and made you pay for it.  After telling you it would be paid content.
---
Nothing can be done in court for this.   They will laugh at you after taking your retainer fee for legal counsel.
---
So go right ahead, pad the lawyer bank books.  Bethesda didn't do anything wrong.  
---
You can still play your game, in the same manner you did before they opened up a "VIP Service" for paid users who wish to pay.
---
There might be more of a case if they forced everyone to now have a subscription, but they didnt, so they are safe.
---
yeah just give everyone a scrapbox and to the 1st member a exclusive skin or something, bc it's clearly that they would sell skins for it in the future
---
You dont have to pay for it lmao. Why do you still keep saying that?
---
I hear you.  I was there at one point in my life too.  I think the atoms they give are almost enough to justify the cost itself if I'm not mistaken, but regardless I just feel very strongly that the level of hate they are receiving for a relatively normal business practice is largely driven by people who really have no real horse in the race and just want clicks or to feel a part of something.   Outrage culture sickens me, I guess.
---
The thing about farming the whitespring no one understands is that the ghouls respawn when a new player enters the area and triggers them. So if you’re solo they are only going to spawn like twice an hour for you where as a large group can take turns sending someone in to trigger a new wave every few minutes
---
Not a single company out there ‘cares’ for its consumers like you’re implying. It’s clearly a money grab but he makes a good point that they are offering a private server renting service for their game and they probably should have done a better job marketing it as such instead of a generic subscription.
---
So all you've said is money says what a good game is. Gotchya. Makes sense. I disagree, but oh well
---
I literally expect Mass Effect 3 quality for tOW. I mean everyone circle jerks Obsidian but New Vegas was 400 hours or so with every little thing done. So how is that for quality over quantity.
---
People did defend fo76, but recently people are more into the rage-bait posts. Either that or people have just stopped giving a fuck and would rather play the game in peace than get called bethesda bootlickers or fanboys.   
---
This subreddit is fucking cancer.
---
Im also ready to do it now
---
People buy, money flows
---
Little kids run their own Minecraft servers. People run WoW private servers out of their homes.
---
Funny thing, agile is supposed to be better for consumers. Believe me I have the same conversations at work LOL. It is supposed to allow companies to react more quickly to customer demand versus traditional waterfall development
---
Maybe that could be why my weapon SFX overhaul mod stopped working after the latest patch.
---
There aren’t enough fallout 76 players for that many downvotes.
---
Where’s your proof that it supports development?
---
Yeah, I understand why people are mad. I just have a different perspective. I’m not saying anyone’s opinion is wrong, I’m just chiming I’m with my two cents.
---
That will come with the 200.00a year membership
---
Bethesda Bamboozled y’all yet again?! 😢😂😢😂😢😂😢😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah using their own resources it's completely different
---
At the kinda prices that the atomic shop normally have, the outfit alone would be a steal.
---
It's not pay to win - it's pay-to-lose.
---
\*puts screws in his unlimited scrap box\*
---
\*screws vanish\*
---
And when they grow up, they'll realize that a hundred dollars get you several more hours with a B-class prostitute than they'll spend avoiding people in a private game instance. Hopefully it won't be too late.
---
I havent thought about Fark in forever.
---
Pay them $20 a month they'll fix it.
---
Jesus Christ when will these posts end.
---
The outfit is cool the box 50/50 the best is the fast travel tent in my opinion
---
Again they didn’t test their 💩before releasing and more importantly SELLING it to the public!!!
---
Just wait till it happens to you, then you’ll see how happy you’ll be with the outcome.
---
To be honest with you man, had this glitch not happened, I would probably agree with your post. 
---
Where I completely lost respect for Bethesda is when the people who payed extra because they still believed in the company are the ones getting hurt.
---
Xbox can record up to like a couple minute before with the “Xbox record that” stuff. Ps4 can save clips up to your last 30 minutes of gameplay. As for PC that’s a tough one but I know for a fucking fact that for as many people that have complained there has to be some proof. You wanna try thinking now?
---
You're completely right, that's why I dont defend any co.pany and I'm against it
---
New Vegas also had 4 expansions and was open world. The main story line itself was less than 20 hours if you played quest to quest. Mass Effect 3 wasnt open workd and actually uses the same “area” based instances as tOW. And why do you expect ME3 quality nobody has even compared it to that. ME3’s last 25% of the game was also horrendous and almost made the game not worth getting.
---
Same I wanted a co-op fallout. Not an online multiplayer game like they did with fo76. I feel like co-op would of meant they would of focused on the story and the gameplay like other fallout games. In fo76 it feels like they focused more on making the multiplayer work instead of making content.
---
Cool story bro.
---
Yeah, there’s a notification at the bottom to say if it’s in the current vendor or a different one but it’s not made things any easier, management wise.
---
My fellow Canckle-head! I had the same thought. Scary days!
---
Oh trust me I've been doing that since fallout 3
---
I don't feel like they are, that was the point of my post. I appreciate your time in reading it though.
---
It's early to evaluate 1st membership. Let's wait what will be the exclusive content and things calm down.
---
13$ for real private servers is ok but for simple game session it's overpriced.
---
I don’t care about building and I don’t team up. Chatting with others is fine but listening to mouthbreathers shoveling Fritos in their mouth isn’t fine.  I’ve also explored and grinded until my heart is content. 
---
I care about killing and destroying and blowing things up- friend or foe.   Clearly this game hasn’t cared about these player types for a while.
---
Who says I have friends to add to a friends list?
---
yeah, people are so greedy for wanting basic features like ability to just set a game to private thats been around since diablo 2 days or earlier.   Or when they are given private servers, actually expect them to be private and their own, not reused, what the fuck are people paying 100$"s for if it's jsut the same shitty servers the game has had for a year, but unused because people quit.
---
Were you honestly expecting anything else but a half-assed,lazy and cheap attempt at this point?
---
You paid for it...?
---
&gt; what happened to you guys :(
---
What happened is that they forgot their own past mistakes that led to Morrowind. To quote Todd Howard, "We started doing a lot of games, and they just weren't good enough". Morrowind was basically their last ditch effort to refocus themselves and stay in business. It worked and they stayed in business to make more games, but clearly they didn't learn anything from it because they're repeating those same mistakes now with Fallout 76.

If you a active friend of mine, please join.
---
But i also got ppl on my list who are traders and all we are is a server hop to each other, they should ask.
---
Good good let the butthurt flow through
---
The fact you're actually still supporting this garbage is why Bethesda won't put out anything decent for the next decade.
---
Neckbeard betas screeching about a $40 video game while jerking each other off and upvoting is a conversation?  You little dimwits are funny. :-)
---
Funny, the rest of us PCMR learned the value of money from having to manage our first build. You must have missed that memo.
---
&gt; anyone taking bets on how many times they'll mention "death threats", "toxicity" etc.
---
I'll take a bet for 'zero'.
---
These people are going to have to try to make the best out of a terrible situation that they had no say in. Whatever they come out with, they're going to have a lot of hate directed at themselves personally despite not being involved in the decision at all, and they know that saying things like that will only rile up the mob more. They won't voluntarily take more hate on top of everything else they'll already have to deal with.
---
Who cares if it works as intended? I like open world games but sometimes you need to narrow the focus a *little* if you want to actually be able to tell a story.
---
What a grand and intoxicating innocence.
---
Whatever you are going through I hope everything works out for you.
---
* Access to the personal server - this does a few things: 1.) I don’t have to deal with toxic/obnoxious players 2.) Makes it so I can gather materials without having to worry about other players tagging mobs before me 3.) Allows me to place my camp where I want without having to deal with someone else having it there first.  
---
* at about $0.01 per atom, at $12.99 I get 1650 atoms a month, so it’s “paying” for itself in various cosmetics every month.  
---
* Those were the primary reasons I picked it up, but the stash (which has thus far been working fine for me) and the tent are just icing on the cake. 
---
Honestly, the bulk of it is the personal server.  I’d rather play the bulk of this game solo and not deal with other people.
---
I'd pay 5$ a month for those features....and a weekly blowjob.
---
Huh. So it really is that way. Appreciate the candour dude. 
---
If you don't mind some unsolicited advice, maybe consider hiring more mods. It looks bad that all you do is respond to reports. Makes you guys look like you're doing the bare minimum effort, especially when duplicate posts hang around for hours before being addressed.
---
That is a very cool build! Bravo!!
---
I bought 1 month
---
1. To check it out and get the premium stuff.
---
2. It was pretty good.  Lag free and faster load times in private sessions. 
---
3. I don't like subscription models.  I like to have something tangible for my money.  I still wanted to check it out,  though. I'll keep playing,  but probably won't buy any more months.
---
I want to buy it but I don’t support the scrapbox being behind this paywall so I won’t buy it.
---
I used to fucking love Bethesda. I spent over 1000 hours in both Skyrim and oblivion. People used to bug me because I talked about Skyrim so much.
---
Fallout new Vegas is the only game I ever bought the special edition. I own every fallout game except 76. Paid mods for fallout 4 was enough for me I cannot believe people are still falling for this shit.
---
How the mighty have fallen.
---
Bethesda does not care about you in any way. All they want is your money.
---
All my stuff works just fine.
---
Is this a PC issue thingy?
---
I havent seen any real proof of this "bug" just people saying its broken.
---
From personal experience, mine works just fine.
---
Sounds like more fake news
---
This exactly, I pre ordered it but told myself that $60 isn’t bad for no paid content in the game considering the problems it had. If wastelanders isn’t a massive beautiful dlc, well, I’d say it’d be good at the end of a targeting range, but digital doesn’t work that way. Maybe I can pay someone to hack and destroy it? Idk, we’ll get to that bridge in 2020
---
I would hope not but if ppl think this decision came from bethesda softworks and not bgs, then pete probably had a say in it since he is the vp
---
which apparently even stealth-nerfed themselves this patch too...it never stops!

Thanks for posting this, there's been so much repetitive negativity on here as of late.

14.6 million scorch killed in one week....how many you think reddit is responsible for?

Yeah thats crap and i can get by that
---
So I should believe everyone because Bethesda broke some promises? I’m not too ecstatic but goddamn, stop whining and wait. You aren’t the first or the last to experience it. Do what everyone else has to do and fucking wait.
---
had also been my favourite game. Could not be a bigger Bethesda fan, but this is too far for me also... uninstalled :(
---
I only had the junk poof after I went from my private to adventure. Played all day yesterday no problem. So do not go into adventure without first moving junk to your stash.
---
Other games have done paid private servers but they did it better: their paid servers were dedicated servers able to have access restricted to only certain individuals (not just anyone on your friend list) and they had custom settings.
---
If private servers are to be a subscribed asset they should match those standards of quality, what they are currently is subpar.
---
yeah, but they keep adding free content to a game I bought for $60 a year ago and have played for over a thousand hours! LIES ALL LIES
---
Meh. I bought it solely for the ncr outfit and atoms. Could care less about private worlds and scrap stashbox. Im sure they’ll fix the scrap thing though.
---
Ya he did
---
Actually one of the first things i thought was "private server might be nice to always find loot" 
---
i was seeing myself in the asylum getting those uniforms..
---
But i guess its just the same as our 2nd grade worlds
---
No? Because my very first invitation and encouragement to modding a video game came from them... when I purchased morrowind and with it the official modding tools to easily mod the game. Which they supported and welcomed.  So am I legally entitled? No... not sure anyone would ever argue that per say. That said is modding one of the things that grew their fanbase? Is modding a thing they supported? Is modding one of the backbones and reasons their games are still relevant years later? The answer to those is Yes. 
---
I don't mod anymore... But I do know it was a large part of what made these games special for many... I do know its part of what cultivated the following it has today. So it's their decision to which path they go down and it's becoming obvious the direction the franchise and development is heading and that is fine, but like any change in direction, sometimes there is fallout.
---
In my case, I bought a single month, and I don't regret it. 
---
I bought the game itself for $10 so that I could play with a friend. So my grand total investment is a little less than $25, which isn't that much. That being said, I'm not the type to spend a long time playing a single game. I will finish all the story quests, and probably complete all the trophies, and then I'll move on to a new game, meaning that by the time my month of Fallout First time is over, I'll be done with the game anyway, but I will have enjoyed a couple of conveniences in the mean time (granted, I haven't run into any of the issues others have yet, like missing scrap.)
---
Had I been a long time player or paid full price for the game, I'd probably be just as pissed as everyone else though, and the idea of paying $100 for a year of scrap storage and private-ish servers is ridiculous.
---
Hah, you're deluded if you don't think all these AAA epic exclusives won't sell for $60+ when thet release on steam next year
---
All I think is the comment was stupid.
---
pad
---
I was playing Oblivion before FO76...being new to the FO series, I had high expectations. I only made it to level 70 to be thoroughly disenchanted. Good job Bethesda. I will uninstall FO76 and go back to playing on my Nintendo DS. Im completely disgusted with Bethesda. Good job! You lost a fan. Im sure Im not the only one.
---
They raped me...my ass hurts...bad....
---
This dude must also be one of those Blizzard fans that don't believe that sucking to China ain't wrong. 
---

---
... You're starting arguments AGAIN?? lol
---
Drop it in a 43-foot hole in the ground!
---
So you just defeated your own argument in the end, good for you.
---
It was in patch notes as an updated description. The card never changed in function.
---
I stopped visiting there when they made the paid-premium service (ironically)
---
Fair point. That is very true. It definitely helps a lot but it was asked for in the past
---
It's actually being reported as very few bugs/issues and is on gamepass day one. I'm downloading now and going to give it a try
---
It’s hard to have sympathy towards anyone who continued to play this game shortly after release. 
---
It’s a horrendous game, and these fans keep coming back for more pain &amp; suffering.
---
No way that you can’t make so other people can’t join.
---
Oh lol, rofl, lmao....hahahahahahaha. shuahyuahshauhaauuHa
---
Is it possible that the games player base is so low that this is a last ditch effort to keep it up and milk the whales ?
---
So you'll still support this abhorrent company for their greedy cash grab attempt?
---
Ohkay.
---
Regardless of who we blame the ends do not justify the means. With just a little more thought they could have invested resources into improving the customer experience to raise their daily and weekly profits without paywalling content and still giving incentives for customers to spend money on the game to support it.
---
I suffer from the “forever poor” mutation. Positive effects include heightened skepticism and logical thinking. So that’s a not from me on all fronts.
---
Just nuke Bethesda from orbit.
---
I think they're done making anything of worth anyways.
---
hahahahahaha. imagine this option going away too like survivor mode.
---
The idea is that it allows you to build a product in real time giving users the features that they want versus spending a whole bunch of resources developing this Fully baked thing that may not end up meeting your users needs
---
PS4 it’s actually 15 minutes, and xbox is a couple of minutes as you said.  So I retain MY statement on you using your brain.  The odds of someone realizing the glitch within 15 minutes of it happening is extremely low.  I, for example, got online after having been off for the night when I realized that the junk in my scrap box was gone.  Do you want a recording of me turning on the game and seeing an empty scrap box? Because I’m pretty sure that does’t constitute hard evidence.
---
Can I be #7 cause i still like this game and can't wait for wastlanders
---
What price do you think it should be sold at to be worth the purchase?
---
Beth have confirmed that you can keep everything even if you cancel the subscription which is good.
---
I'm thinking theyll add something as desirable as the ranger outfit in the coming months to make people think "just one more month"
---
And it’s true.  I mean we have people coming to this sub who are admitting they don’t even play the game.  
---
People are drawn to negativity
---
Do Uber for an hour and be a king. lol
---
Damn removed in less then a minute.
---
At least I can get something out of this mess. Thank you, whoever made that site.
---
There's also reports that newly placed scrap boxes have scrap in them already, how the hell they managed that I have no idea.
---
I’ve heard this a lot for a long time. Hasn’t happened yet and Bethesda knows that modding gives their games long lives. I can see them adding the best mods to their CC after QA/QC. I don’t have an issue with that.
---
You keep the armor, lose the ability to put stuff in the stash box (you can take it out though). My opinion is the same as this commenter, for the record. It has potential, but not something I will subscribe to annually at this time.
---
I can't say if it works or not.  I'm always sucking meds to help prevent poison and or disease, but it seems like I catch that stuff more often than when I didn't.
---
As soon as Outer Worlds is finished downloading I’m removing 76. This Fallout 1st thing is the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever seen
---
That's true 'cause someday if you buy 1st for a private server someone can just steal your account.
---
it's features, there's another quote of Hines including features as forever free for all
---
I paid for a month of it I
---
1. I haven’t played since a month after release. One requirement of a looter shooter is a place to store loot, this was previously missing.
---
2. 
---
3. Hasn’t affected what I think of them yet, I will wait to see if they use the money toward the game or pocket it and run.
---
Bonus question: Do you see yourself continuing the sub?
---
No. While the sub improves the game, it still is quite hollow. In all the time I have been  gone, the game hasn’t gained much besides a raid and alot of atom shop skins. @ $13 per month I would expect a games worth of content at least every 6 months.
---
These sessions are not private. Ive server hopped into 20 "private sessions" with players going ape shit crazy demanding i leave their world. Of course i did, after looting their world. 😂😂😂
---
I do not own any body pillow and do not watch anime, which Rick and Morty also isn't.
---
I assume it's the same as any atom shop purchases so it will only work on the account you buy it on and she will not have access to the items unless she is logged in with your gamertag. I use this method for when my GF and I played and my atom shop items are separate from hers and vice versa.
---
Why would community managers ever go on that sub?
---
Good for you. Most people on this sub run with Egghead.
---
ayy Happy cakeday man
---
Did it.
---
It's probably the same guy who came into my camp then into my house when the door was opened and shut it on the way out.  The only guy I've encountered who bothered. Admittedly its the diner door so the glass is broken so the heat will still go out but its the thought that counts
---
ESO actually has plenty of content to enjoy.  Fallout 76 on the other hand...
---
He's reporting about the scrapbox deleting the items it was supposedly designed to store that sheep paid money for. How is that an irrational rage post? You seem like a contrarian who just wants to fanboy Bethesda.
---
There's a reason you're down voted into oblivion; you're a dipshit.
---
Saying the truth.
---
&gt;No matter how much fun you’re having or how much you think you need whatever it is they’re selling, think, don’t fall for it. 
---
So, whether myself or the OP or anyone is enjoying themselves and thinks we are getting our money worth, you feel we should stop. Because you're on some self righteous crusade to dictate what is a good game and what is a good business model? 
---
No thanks, I'll decide for myself. You go see if you can get the rest of the mob and storm the castle, I'll be at home on my own server.
---
Pay 2 Win? Not really.
---
Scummy? Very much so yes
---
ok like i see your point in doing this, but i think your just kinda being a dick
---
I bought Fallout 1st and I really enjoy it.
---
Can you give me an example which this has worked for consumers, at least in the video game industry?
---
We on the same brainwave my man ✌😎
---
I mean you can think of it this way, you buy a new car part, knowing it should work well and hold up for a few years minimum. It somewhat works, though it has several kinks in it, but not as well for the price you paid. You’d be upset wouldn’t you. Yes you can turn around and buy a better one for the same price, but you wasted money on it. Now you have a part that doesn’t really work and no one wants to buy it from you. It not as so much that people can’t move on, they’re just mad about wasting a investment.  If your like me, you only buy 1 game every year or so. Just kinda stinks
---
 Well this my ninth so I have been doing this a while. The first was a Pentium 120 built to play Doom.
---
Im bringing my junkies gatling gun. All i have to do now is get addicted to heroine and I'm good to go.
---
When I first got the game I used the bug to get unlimited stash size.( I've never duped ) I came here to this community and was open about this. I was mauled and told I was a scourge on the game and that it was people like me killing the server stability. I argued that this didn't make sense but was told over and over that I was wrong. I'd like to take this time to say fuck those people. Unlimited stash for just $100 bucks per year.
---
Let's see. 
---
I got the game as a Christmas Gift. 
---
Didn't play it for a year so they fixed their shit. 
---
Fallout 1st is a poor cash grab. 
---
Bethesda itself is known for cash grabs which get modified after fan backlash and pre alpha games being released as finished games. I expected this cashgrab. However I still like the story which is my right to enjoy. 
---
Tl;Dr Mostly F2P with under $15 spent in the year plus I own the game. I will play it not as often but I will because I enjoy the game. I will not throw more money at it until they fix this, if they ever do.
---
I agree with a lot of what you said here, but 76 is kind of a one time thing, a long term money-making product, that serves to support their other projects. I grew up with Bethesda as well, but I’m still exited for Starfield and es6, because: 
---
1. It will be a return to their usual single player style (most likely), thus warranting the quality an ES6 would need to be to be a worthy successor to Skyrim. If they can make it as good and as memorable a game as Skyrim was, that would give them an even greater profit than if they were to take the lazy route and lower the bar substantially. After all, the reason Skyrim was so successful, was that it was, well.... good. People were clearly attracted to a game with effort put into it, as the sales have shown over the years. ES6 better be good if they want people to buy it, especially with the drama surrounding 76 currently.
---
2. Bethesda would just get torn apart completely if they dared to put 76 style micro transactions into es6, and since 76 seems to be designed to be the funding for their newer projects, they wouldn’t have a need for it, but I could be wrong of course, fallout 1st just became a thing after all. They are likely to just do creation club (even though that still sucks).
---
3. (Excluding 76) Bethesda makes unique, fun open world titles, that I like to play quite a lot, and I’m sure a lot of you out there do as well. Most large AAA developers focus on pure action games, or FPS’, but BGS’ games on the whole provide a kind of open world experience that EA or Activision really don’t (not to mention that they have been fucking up for way longer than Bethesda has at this point). 
---
I do enjoy playing it every once in a while, but the stuff they have been doing within the past few days regarding 76 is unacceptable. The state of the game is definitely quite sub-par
---
Just my thoughts on the matter!
---
Maybe if something specific triggers it, I could provide evidence by reproducing it.  My friend speculated that it happens when someone without the subscription tries to use your scrap box. Perhaps I can make a video of putting some steel in the box, my friend trying to use it, and the scrap being deleted.
---
P2W was quoted from a post. Sorry if it seemed a bit presumptuous.
---
How exactly is it scummy? As I said, I've literally no idea what's happening
---
So, I'm someone who hasn't purchased the subscription, and also someone who probably won't. Not because I disagree with it, but I'm not playing F76  enough to warrant a sub for the game.
---
In answer to your questions:
---
1. I personally don't mind it. I'm not surprised they have implemented a subscription option. After all ESO has one, and it just makes sense for games like this to have one. I don't mind at of the benefits you get from it either. My only complaint is the cost currently. It feels a bit much for what they are offering currently. Down the line it may be different, but as it is... Not yet.
---
2. I expected there to be teething issues, so for them to have had them so far, not surprised. The engine the game is running on has reached the end of its life, the studio making the game has limited experience handling online games, and the game is run on temporary virtual servers. Doesn't make for a great mix. I think it will impove with time though. Evidence has shown that the studio has the capacity to improve upon things, and has made good leaps and bounds with the game so far (not saying it's perfect, clearly, but they are making efforts).
---
3. My view hasn't been changed at all. At the end of the day, i still sunk a good amount of time into F76, and I know I'm going to do it more in the future. People who get the F-1st, their decision isn't going to impact on my ability to play and enjoy the game, so I don't see why I should let it bother me. I enjoy Fallout, and I enjoy F76, and for now that's not changed.
---
It is a cringey show that appeals to man children that live with their parents until they are 30. Go play something else if you don’t like the game. Why be in a FO76 sub if you’re just gonna talk shit about the game?
---
I think that's exactly what they're doing with Private Worlds. You can play Raiders and Settlers with your friends there all the time! No game company in their right mind wants a faction of players that only serve to piss off the majority. Now, that said, Bethesda really did leave the game open to Raiders—it just gave people that wanted to opt out of that the opportunity with 'Pacifist' mode. The reason there aren't more people to kill and loot is because they don't want to play the game that way. It's one of the better 'vote how you want to play' mechanics in the game, as I'm opining. 
---
Tl;Dr: Might be better to blame the players that don't want to fight you, they're choosing to opt out.
---
Well said. My group is definitely still playing. We all love fallout. A few of us bought a month of 1st but just for the outfits but have no reason to keep it. We all share resources so none of us really ever runs out. 
---
Month 2 is where the numbers will really matter. 
---
Either way, if you enjoy fallout76 just play to enjoy it. If you dont the play something else that's fun.
---
And yes I know my name is very ironic, made a account for a FO76 question, thought it’d be a funny name. It kinda works now lol
---
Stop by my Geocities Saved by the Bell fansite!
---
I guess we just have to hope then.
---
Same with me, i play alone and have not lot anything
---
too late. now im in
---
Less so P2W, and more so being lying, greedy bastards. The features provided by the subscription are stuff that should’ve been in the game since day one. Now they’re here, but behind a pay wall. Remember when extra purchases were supposed to be cosmetic only?The private servers aren’t even private either
---
It all depends where you are living.
---
If you are outside the EU, then no. But inside the EULA is not even toilette paper.
---
Remember a few years back? Even MS was forced to issue refunds because their EULA was not readable until you've bought windows.
---
But then the question is, how much money can spend on this, if it's more than BGS and ZM can bring to bear, then by all means, go for it .)
---
I don’t think Fallout 76 servers could even be run on a PC. They barely run on the dedicated servers : P
---
I am happy this is happening to you guys, you might as well give your money to a crack addict at least they might appreciate it. Fuck bethesda.
---
If you buy the year sub in the US it's somewhere around $8.56 I think? I'm not at home so can't check
---
Look all I am saying is that there is only 2 actual endings to tOW it has been said as much while your other choices will be shown in slide format during the credits and I prefer open worlds and sandboxes that give me the most bang for my buck.   
---
these kids on here crying about the sub and atom shop item costs is sad. Say you drop 200 hours on fallout without buying atoms that works out to 0.30 an hour. Now take tOW with an average of 40 hours to see both endings that is 1.50 an hour. Now take me even with buying atoms I am at  0.19 an hour.  But for me at the end of the day tOW costs me nothing since I have game pass which I bought for my kids.   
---
As for quality that is subjective, quantity is objective. So it is a matter of opinion versus facts.
---
The most ridiculous thing about it is how it actually worked. They got a bit of flak for it, people still threw money and them and forgot, and nowadays every AAA game and their mother sell DLCs that make the horse armour look like a 10/10 amazing deal.
---
It provides no tactical advantage. Not P2W.
---
For sure the vast majority act like that and would find something else to moan about, just to be/feel part of the hate train; but I think a few of us just feel like it's just one payment after another, after another (and that stems from every developer doing the same thing with micro-transactions and subscriptions). But that's life and that's the new business model they've all adopted because it pays big... I think people just forget that it is just a 'business' at the end of the day. Its most important purpose is to make more money. Times and business models will and do change but that stays the same.
---
I like to think they just left for another company lol
---
If you choose to pay that much, I just bought an Xbox One X for my granddaughter's birthday, for a managed environment, that charges you to manage it, there is nothing I can do.
---
 For what you guys pay for these things, you could build a perfectly good computer.
---
&gt; Uninstalling and reinstalling the game. 
---
Customer service is really giving this advice? Do they have no idea how servers work?
---
Yeah sure! 
---
You can have all my junk
---
Hopefully that is the case.
---
I imagine a price drop would also make people say "one more month", or perhaps some outfits from previous Fallout games (like the Vault 111 outfit, or costumes of iconic Fallout characters).
---
I just tried going to a friend’s scrap box on his private server on my backup computer, nothing. Tested going to a public server, nothing.
---
It’s also a live service title that doesn’t require you to be online lmao
---
SHHHHHH Todd might hear you..
---
I called this on release, said they'd pull an ESO plus type monetization scheme, i'm just suprised it took so long.
---
Loot boxes will be next if they don't already have them.
---
Bought to check it out, plus I wanted the Halloween stuff so a touch of a bonus. While stable-ish and nice to be able to do certain things without other people mucking it up, it's not something I can see shelling out $100 for right now. Stash box is a great feature and should be in the base Game. I have no issues with paying for a private server (or in this case, private instance) in general, but subscribers aren't getting much for their money at this point, imo.
---
I felt this one
---
&gt;Oh shit I checked your post history and you play Anthem. I'm sorry I'm so sorry.
---
You can't really talk much :P
---
Oh shit, can't believe so many people supported this. Tysm
---
$60=$1000+? K
---
Dude, I relate to this so fucking much. 
---
Same. Because of this comment, and collective post, I am uninstalling now. And deleting this wack ass Bethesda launcher from my PC. 
---
I quit the first day I played after the repair kits. I had read about them after that update and thought it didn’t seem cool. But, first play session post repair kit fuckery I went to repair an item saw you needed kits. Logged out and walked away forever. I didn’t think it would bother me. It fucking did.
---
Lets face it, they shut down the survival servers to begin charging for them.
---
Well, that was a lie.
---
The site is still up just type it falloutfirst.com
---
&gt; The only people on this sub who defend are whales who have to seek validation for their poor impulse control and money management skills.
---
Or, you know, they have good money management skills coupled with well paying jobs? Back when I played World of Warcraft it was shocking how many doctors, lawyers, and other people making six-digit salaries played that game. I fully expect that to be the same here too. To one of them paying for this subscription isn't too different from us paying for a coffee.
---
I uninstalled the game and the launcher. Thanks Bethesda, I hate it. The last bastion this company has with me is the next TES game and even then I’ll be waiting a few weeks after release until I buy it.
---
Rightfully so. If i had to talk about people that like eating poop i would probably talk in a similar tone.
---
Im not defending Bethesda at all. I merely ask that people dont lump what they're doing as "pay to win" just because money is involved. Its a stupid and lazy way to complain about the issue.
---
Do you keep the NCR ranger outfit if you quit after a month ?
---
Unfortunately you’re still going to have idiots who  SOLELY to spite those who are against this, support it with all their being.
---
As if $12.99 a month for a service riddled with bugs, after paying $60 for a service riddled with bugs, isn’t Bethesda openly pissing in their mouths.
---
Grind for it yourself, just like we have to grind to get stuff free in the Atom Shop.
---
I WAS excited for Wastelanders, but that excitement has really been dampened by this subscription crap. I might give it a go, but I might as well just replay 4 or NV. 
---
I’ve supported the game this whole time because I love the Fallout franchise and universe. I’ve had fun in 76. I like games I can hop into, play new quests and then dip out for a few months until new content drops. When Wastelanders finally drops, I’ll decide then if I’ll continue with the game.
---
Well if you find a better system to rank the best video games of all time, lemme know. Numbers dont lie. That's how they rank movies, music, and most other things. Huh. 
---
For the record, I would assume that a game must be somewhat decent for millions upon millions of people to buy them. I dont know, makes sense to me.
---
hey guess what...unless they changerd it, you could do this day 1, log out of the game, then log in and have a fresh server with loot and monsters to kill.
---
Would love to if it wasn't Epic Store exclusive on PC
---
Stable servers shouldn’t need to be extra money
---
Got it thanks
---
 The machine, the games, the fucking service. Add that up, and a grand is not necessary.
---
Jesus christ, you really expect anyone to read this wall of text? Tldr next time
---
100$ per year.
---
This happened to me and at the time I didn’t know when it happened. It’s not like I check my stash every 2 seconds. It was only when I went to cook something I realised I had no wood. I then I went and check my stash and it had all gone. Posted asking if anyone else had the problem and I thought it might of been when I used someone else scrap box. Someone else posted it’s when you force close the game when switching from public to private. I’d already tested all the theory’s I thought and tried this and it happened again.  So yes it is a thing.
---
Yep $13 a month to rent a used survival server...and I expect the game thinks they stash box is a "player" that dies upon logging out causing that "player" to drop all their junk.
---
&gt;just 1.99 each
---
*10.99
---
Funny though 😂😂😂
---
W H A T
---
Well, their games are only amazing cause of mods.
---
Drop the 's' and it's a perfect description!
---
Yes these poor destitute game devs on their measly 200k+ a year salaries are the true victims of a capitalistic society. Jesus fucking christ.
---
I just think I'm taking out my pent up abandonment issues on the gaming industry lol
---
A PS4 or Xbone came out long before 76. Plus my consoles come as gifts.
---
Not saying you’re lying btw. Just saying I haven’t seen the first speck of evidence.
---
Alright fellas time to put on the tin foil hats
---
Its a weird fantasy world you people live in. I have been playing it since beta. I've slowed down after many hours, but the game is fucking cake. ;)
---
because the argument for being charged 100$'s a month is your paying for the private server.  Otherwise what the fuck is that 70$'s of that going for?
---
Vocal inside Reddit, inside their bubble, no one cares.
---
Reddit has a huge problem, doesn’t accept different opinions and downvotes people, so different opinions end up not posting or using Reddit.
---
That hasn't been my experience with it at all.  I'm not sure if it's been others, but none of my friends who have subs have had this issue either?  Could just be rumors meant to discourage people from getting a sub, because of how strongly some people feel against them offering it as a paid service.
---
A hahahahaha hahahahahahah hahahahaha
---
Apology not accepted
---
He could have been just trying it. I don’t agree with him buying it but don’t be a mean person and say he deserved it. I’m annoyed just as you but don’t show hate to a fellow player
---
Why would anyone have that expectation when since before the game was even released they indicated otherwise?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk)
---
Gotcha
---
I give up.
---
1) Because I wanted to and it makes me happy. All the features appealed to me and feel well worth $13.
---
2) Expected super smooth playing. Got just that. 
---
3) I’ll play it more probably, till Sunday night at least. Planning on powering through MW then.
---
Pepperidge Farm rememberers.
---
The *s\*x tent* gets me everytime lmao.
---
I wouldn’t say pay to win is the exact terminology, but the problem is Bethesda is creating artificial problems (stash space &amp; fast travel cost), taking community ideas, and monetizing those while at the same time breaking the promise of cosmetics only that Pete Hines talked about near launch. I’ll address each thing individually.
---
1. Stash Space/Scrapbox - This is the biggest offender IMO. This is something everyone has consistently asked for since beta. Bethesda has claimed that its due to server stability. For individual items, yes, those all have to load in, so I get it - but stacks of materials count as one item because they’re just an integer. If I had unlimited crafting storage, I would be on much, much more collecting lead, steel, and other materials to craft guns &amp; ammo. My biggest problem on certain builds is ammo cost, and obviously you can only carry so much crafting materials until now. Additionally, some guns are quite hard to find in the wild (most endgame heavy guns &amp; rifles like Gatling gun, 50 cal, light machine gun, gauss rifle, handmade) so I would buy the plans to these, then craft &amp; scrap them for the mods. If I could stack up on the materials to craft these, then I would easily have 1000’s of these. This is something that absolutely needs to be given to the player base.
---
2. T.E.N.T. and Community Ideas
---
I’ve followed this subreddit since launch and the T.E.N.T., refrigerator and backpacks are all items where I’ve seen community posts made about them. Bethesda did a great thing by making the backpack a quest and then adding some sweet skins for them. I picked up the Nuka cola, don’t touch my stuff, and corvega skins for them myself. But with newer items, Bethesda has broken their promise of cosmetics only and made some utility items cost money. This was where they really started crossing the line, and led to this point. Essentially Bethesda has changed their stance now to where any new community ideas will be monetized and sold back to us. The community gives out ideas because we want to earn them, not pay for them. The items they’ve sold so far are admittedly pretty weak in terms of utility, but nonetheless they were cool ideas that people thought of because they wanted more content to unlock these things, not have them locked behind a paywall. It’s frustrating.
---
Ultimately, I’ll say this - aside from the scrapbox, nothing they’ve added is pay to win. That being said, it feels like thievery and greed on Bethesda’s part for our support of this game. I think it’s fine to monetize the servers because that’s paying for an actual service, but at the very least they need to be heavily improved, and I really want to see them be able to be hosted privately even if it means that characters on those private servers can’t be transferred to the main game - that way it would be much cheaper or free for people to host them. The cosmetics like the ranger armor and emotes are fine for the pass as well. Anything else added in that provides utility is a slap in the face to FO76 supporters and should not be locked behind a paywall. Admittedly this all came at a poor time for Bethesda - pushing back wastelanders and outer worlds about to launch, so that won’t help their troubles - but the community is still right on everything. It is just a money grab by Bethesda and I uninstalled until they fix it.
---
Also, does anyone else think they can’t make money off the game by selling cool skins? Why couldn’t they sell the ranger outfit for $20? Everyone would have bought that. Remember the liberty prime skin? I picked that up because I saw everybody else wearing that. They had to make an assload of money off of that skin alone, let alone if they made more unique or iconic skins. They can make money from skins if they sell it right, instead of making plain blue skins and trying to sell those.
---
Such a hot take lmfao
---
I microwaved it, that is like burning right... Oh wait my PC mutated and beggs for a mercy kill BRB!
---
Reviews report that they came upon very little (1-2) or no bugs upon playthrough.
---
It’s been that way since summer began.
---
TL;DR Bethesda isnt greedy so much as they are in over their heads. Lack of experience making online games, and complete misunderstanding of how to properly monetize and develop for online games.
---
I guess you could say.... *the game was rigged from the start.*
---
you get some powerful bonus items like a second fast travel point and an unlimited storage box, as well as the ability to mine resources endlessly with no chance anyone will come stop you, so paying the money makes you much stronger than someone that doesn't. They also claim they are going to tie mods to it, but who knows, since currently they are just making you pay for it with none of the mods
---
No, its not true. 
---
The subscription gives you access to a private server that only those on your friends list can join. 
---
You also get a secondary camp tent to use as a free fast travel spot anywhere you chose (I set mine up just north of D-9)
---
THere are a few "VIP" only emotes and a few outfits you get for free.
---
You also get a new junk stash that can hold all your junk with no limit (my favorite feature) 
---
There are also a few unlockable dance emotes that are pretty freakin hillarious 
---
None of these features really impact the main gameplay.  There is no OP gear, or subscriber only weapons and armor.  There are a few QoL perks, and some skins, but nothing that would classify as P2W, since there really isnt any winning in Fallout.
---
You get other stuff too such as cosmetics, an extra fast travel point and a less laggy game experience via access to limited servers.
---
No problem. To me, there’s a line between being being a loyal fan to a franchise you love, and letting a greedy company scam and disrespect you. I’ve been loyal, stuck through the bugs and felt indifferent about the utility items. Fallout 1st is where loyal fans should dig their heels in and not let their favorite franchise stay like this
---
Of course, the responses will all be from a list of prewritten bullshit such as “Thank you for your input, dweller! We’ll be sure to take it to the team!” 
---
But if you want an actual person to respond? Pop another $5 and you’ll get a message from our main man Unpaid Intern #55679 himself!
---
Why everyone calling ppl whales? Kinda confused
---
It was down for a bit (for me at least) but now it seems to be up again. Hilarious
---
You can believe whatever you’d like.  It happened to me, so I shared and gave advice based on my experience.  I know that most people won’t listen to that advice and that doesn’t bother me one bit; everyone does with their lives what they want to do. I’m just trying to be helpful by warning people that items being deleted from the your account is a very real possibility.

---
R532o, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever read. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. 
---
Everything that flew from your empty mind down your fingertips and into your keyboard was baseless, full of unproven opinion, and argued in a way as to trigger an emotional response while providing no actual facts. 
---
You should be ashamed for infecting the minds of others with the sheer stench of your existence. Everyone in this reddit is now dumber for having read it.
---
Refreshing, even.
---
Unfortunately they aren't losing any money over us all uninstalling. We already bought the game and some of us bought the atoms. Most people that bought atoms are just gonna buy this subscription too. As fucked up as this is, I would surprised if they care because they are still making more money than they were 3 days ago
---
I remember back when I was younger I viewed the resistance to multiplayer TES/Fallout games by the Bethesda community to be fanatical. 
---
I now suspect they just saw trends that I never noticed.
---
Oh, nice bonus question! No, I do not plan on continuing on this subreddit.
---
I came her to see how the fans reacted to the subscription model and not posting so I wouldn't stoke the flames or make a long post against the game knowing full well I had no idea what I was talking about. After a while of thinking about it, I decided that I would make one post asking the community their thoughts in a calm and civil way, and I hope that I succeeded with that.
---
However, I'm glad to hear the subreddit does help the community aspect of the game, I remember loving Google+ because of its community despite the problems people had with it.
---
I hope Bethesda does something to make this game better, but after all the promises they made towards the game and haven't followed up on (from what I have seen, correct me if I'm wrong), my optimism is fading.
---
For a sec I thought that was the REAL website.
---
Yet again, that's not really far from reality
---
Thank you. I agree. I still have fun playing though, I haven't gave them a cent in mtx or "private" servers so whatever 🤷‍♂️
---
Just look over most profiles that are commenting, they are new or/and never have posted in fo76 before. 
---
It's not hard to spot the brigading that's going on. 
---
Might be in Mod's best interest to implement a "account specific age" for posting. Would go a long way in making sure trolls don't flood in to stir the pot.
---
Australian price would be 100$ base game, at launch, +143$ if you choose to buy for 1 year or 19.05$ for one month, or 228.6$ for buying 12 months worth of the 1 month subscription
---
I get that. Just odd that someone hasn’t had any evidence considering it’s happened to these hundreds of supposed people.
---
They’re waiting for it to *alllll* blow over
---
I am saying if they decided to go that route I dont think many people would be that upset as long as they are told exactly what is going on.
---
/me hates to admit he is downloading fallout 76 right now
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
imagine people paying for a year and this mode not even lasting that long?
---
remember survival is already gone, wastelanders delayed. isnt NW still beta? 
---
What if they run in to too many problems with this? i guess we will see. or maybe they want to use this money to hire more programmers lol
---
Best thing I've read all day.
---
The people angry on reddit are never, ever representative of the larger population.
---
Never ever ever. They'll always tell you they're the real fans, and they deeply believe they represent the fan base as a whole, but they don't. They don't for video games, movies, sports teams, or anything.
---
This doesn't necessarily make them wrong, or unimportant, but generally the people in places like this have a wildly inflated sense of their own importance and are constantly predicting backlashes that don't materialize because other people, amazingly, have different priorities than they do.
---
personally, the only way the 100$'s a year was 'defendable' was if you were given 100% your own server that always stayed and didn't get voided, because then your paying for the space just for you, here they are just giving you someone elses old game.
---
Can’t tell if this is a troll or not finna get off Reddit for a bit.
---
Pitchforks, buy your pitchforks her, we also have gasoline to light that bad boy or girl up! IT'S GONNA BE LIT! Pitchforks, GET YOUR PITCHFORKS RIGHT HER!  COSTS LESS THAT A MONTH SLAVERSHIP FROM FALLOUT 1st!

Lmao people say the dumbest things on here like op, its obv theyll slowly up the camp budget once they figure out the server issues

Yeh, got on and saw it last night
---
Fuuuuck. That.
---
Spent my day server hopping in to "private servers "  and looting people private world. 
---
I had this guy screaming at me to get out of his world 😂😂😂
---
Didnt even know about this game till yesterday. I've put a few hours into it so far. Frame rate gets choppy occasionally, and the gun likes to unholster itself often, but those will almost certainly be fixed soon.
---
The game itself is like a cool mix of New Vegas and Star Wars KOTOR. Worth checking out.
---
Money and more importantly my Time!
---
I still play, too never got any microtransaction tho! Cosmetics are useless!
---
Paying for an inferior, half-assed product is how we got to where we are now. 
---
I don't understand people like you, but hey, if you wanna piss away your money then that's on you.
---
The ability to farm workshops without the threat of PvP because my build is nowhere near ready for that yet. 
---
The scrapbox. 
---
1650 atoms monthly. I usually pay $20~ a month on them anyway. So, $13 a month for that many atoms plus private worlds plus the scrapbox plus exclusive Atomic Shop stuff plus the tent. It’s a win for me.
---
I just wanna comment here for when archaeologists arrive. The last one ever posted by this account.
---
Really got to get that bar set as low as possible for Starfield.
---
**It's not about** you work 50 hours / week and already throwing money $20-25 / month to buy atom.
---
It's about how the **LIED** to us since the very beginning. I am so freaking upset that they lied about junks in our stash will create instability to their servers. The facts that ALL JUNKS should have their weight turned into 0 when they're in our stash. I am fine with the junks in my bag / inventory having weight.
---
Second, they used our ideas and put them into the atom store, and now behind a paywall.
---
What's next? I am guessing that they will put the Wastelander DLC behind fallout1st. We will be able to get Wastelander early access if you have fallout1st. Same goes with the mods, you already paid $13 for fallout1st private world. Would you pay for another $6 to get that private world of yours modded?
---
I can give you something more that they would do... **CHARACTER RESTORATION?** sure... but you have to be in the fallout1st subscription first.
---
**2 Factor Authentication?** yeah sure, but that's ONLY for our premiere customers who bought fallout1st.
---
It's a slippery slope from now on...
---
I am Todd.... Mwahaha!
---
this sub will be defending them again in a week, that is the business model. People fuss but they will put some pipboy in next week and everyone will go "yay pipboy" and that will be that and when they make wastelanders a 60 dollar 14 minute expantion everyone will pre-order it.
---
Well maybe they'd be able to spin a bigger profit off the game if they supported it long-term, but I'd wager that Bethesda doesn't want to put much more effort into this game.
---
Did they get rid of the whole, people literally eat ammo unless shooting back thing?
---
Edit: also $100 a year or a monthy bill just to play as a raider is insane, considering its been a part of the franchise, to have raiders make the world interesting and even when they claim, "be who you want to be"
---
If pets are cosmetic, let they stay behind paywall. That's money for them and no QOL or advantage for paying players.
---
With the dildo up their ass?  
---
Or did you want it in a different hole?
---
Apparently you missed this part:
---
&gt; That would go hand-in-hand with modding, and (people reasoned) would be the only way modding would even be possible.
---
That's why. For one thing you need to have a local instance to develop mods, at least if you don't want it to be excruciatingly slow.
---
Its like diarrhea from challeys asshole
---
This is coming from someone who loved this game, the people who would play it with me and would play everyday...
---
I quit yesterday and deleted the game. It's such a sad cash grab and it's pathetic. People are gonna farm on private servers and crash the market and 556 currency is gonna go out the window.  For months while playing this game i would tell myself "its gonna get better" 'they will add more content" at that point the only fun i had in the game was trading and selling stuff. Which is sad in its self. Other than SBQ there's nothing to do. Vault Raids was a boring and a shitty puzzle nightmare, they had something going with meat week but again they got lazy and threw meat week back out again with the SAME rewards and a shitty 5 script. If you played the first meat week already there was no point in doing the second. Now they're pushing back actual content for a 100$ cash grab. Im out, i can't support this shit anymore. i've been begging for the FNV ranger outfit now they hide it behind a 100$ paywall proving they just plan on milking the "glory days" and letting this game sink into the abyss. For all the people who payed 100$ for this, you just helped kill the game and you deserve to sink with it.  Now i will join the millions of other people who laugh at this game and the people who still play it and continue to be todds pay pigs.
---
I have a expression for this that I came up with with all the shit that was in break point.
---
Now a days when a developer sees a slippery slope, they go and grab their toboggan.
---
I still don’t get the point of that thing it is completely useless. Make food spoil 99% slowly then you have a useful item.
---
Yeah quality control needs quite a bit of work
---
It's a fun game. I have met a lot of cool people playing this game and am excited for Wastelanders
---
At least I'm intelligent enough to realise I'm getting ripped off. I'll say no more.
---
I enjoy getting fisted
---
i wanted to see what the fuss is about so i got a month of the 1rst
---
i know i know bad panda.. but at least then i can legit rage instead of hearsay ;-)
---
plus im curious about the private server issues and kinda want to conferm it myself LOL
---
I haven't had this great a laugh in a long time, F me Bathesda? no no no, F U!
---
I am definitely in this camp. I would have THROWN my money at them for ES6, but now? I guess I'll be waiting for some reviews and seeing how it goes. It hurts to not trust a favourite developer not to eff up the launch of a game I've been waiting for since I beat Skyrim... in 2011.
---
This is my major hangup about the subscription as well. ESO not only has tons of content but consistent updates and expansions. It clearly has longevity, so having a subscription service for it is justifiable. 76 on the other hand has very little in the way of end game content, much of it broken and not worth the effort (vault raids), and their first major expansion has been delayed. Without major changes this game just won't have the longevity that ESO has, so a subscription service is not only a bad buy, but a risky one too. The fact they didn't think to at least wait until after Wastelanders to consider something like this is ludicrous.
---
Wait people actually paid for this shit?
---
Agree with you, no idea why so many people think that boycotting the game will make it better 😐.
---
Get her outer worlds
---
I didn’t miss it, my point is that anyone who had that expectation when they **explicitly** told us how private servers would work **before the game was released**. 
---
Now, one year later, people are all &lt;insert surprised Pikachu meme&gt;
---
Actually I've been seeing a lot of new people. I think mainly what it's done is make your heinie hurt.
---
I said a lot of people here are just here for the shit now and they don't play the game.
---
As someone who used this sub daily since the game came out I know for a fact there are usually around 3000-4000 daily active users.
---
Those are actual players and people who use the sub daily.
---
Now the sub has 10,000 daily active users. It's fucking obvious that the sudden leap is due to this controversy.
---
I once had the game crash seconds before winning a NW match \^_\^
---
GoDaddy took it down for a while thinking it was under attack, probably after the massive influx of access.
---
Buy a ps4 and get on the winning team??
---
True, transparency is the best thing a company should do but in doing so, they admit to failure
---
that’s your fault lmao
---
Nah see it from my pov if your capable of that kinda thing.
---
Well luckily these features dont work, so maybe its kind of like they didn't steal the feedback.
---
Todd Howard isn't involved in 76 lmao.
---
The guys in charge of 76 are those 2 guys who talked on stage at E3.
---
It’s a very new glitch, so most people who are discovering it (like myself) are discovering it by accident and not within the timeframe of recording.  
---
The other person who commented mentioned specifically what causes it.  That being said, I’d bet you anything that within a week, there will be tons of proof on youtube consisting of people making the glitch happen on purpose so they can provide evidence. 
---
I’d even argue that the glitch is affecting so many people that Bethesda may even act quickly to release a statement and potentially enact corrective measures.
---
I know, I posted this yesterday, but I love how, "Gamers have been asking for these features for months." some how turned into, "Gamers wanted us to sell them stuff that should have been in the game for free."
---
I'm not mad at the people who actually enjoy it and have no problem with the monetization or whatever. More power to them. I'm mad that people keep giving money for a shitty broken product with a year long history being broken and shitty and then complain that it's broken and shitty. What sense does that make? It's like buying a pet rock then being mad because it doesn't play fetch lol.
---
lol bring it back!
---
Whatever

You can buy it from the Windows Store if you don't want to use the Epic Launcher. However, I believe you have to have Windows 10.
---
Uninstalled Fallout 76  
---
Uninstalled Bethesda Launcher
---
I've been on this sub since launch, but haven't owned the game that long.  Here's my thought process:
---
If I am really,and I mean really excited about a game prior to launch (The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Bloodlines 2), I have no problem pre-ordering.  But, if I'm on the fence about whether or not it's gonna be worth the 60 bucks, I'll subscribe to the subreddit just to get everyone's opinions on it, in the days after launch.  In the case of this game, I just wasn't sure about an online fallout experience.  This sub helped a lot, as reviews and opinions were so fucking bad, I didn't want to waste my money unless I could get the game for less, which I did.  It's still a disappointment for 15 bucks, but not as much as it would've been for the tricentennial edition my friend bought.
---
I feel like more people should do that.
---
Except they did not explain how mods would work, and in fact refused to answer questions about how or if you could run mods on those Bethesda-provided servers, yet still said you would be able to run mods.
---
So no, they hadn't explained everything. Literally they refused to answer certain questions.
---
u/CountChappy is the lad who bought the domain tho
---
See-ya!
---
I think they are desperate looking for money, I wonder what strategy is the best...improve the game by polishing it with bug fixes, deliver what was said, give content and QoL players are asking in order to make the player base  increase especially with the DLC coming OR INSTEAD give us a subscription fee for a small amount of such improvements ?
---
ehem.. pretty sure either Pete Hines or Todd said there would be nothing to pay for since there is cosmetic micro transactions. Anything gameplay-related would be free. :)
---
If you are legit, it's a dumpster fire,  just read back in this subreddit....if you are trolling, well, you already know it's a dumpster fire....
---
Haha oh man this is certainly funny oh boy when’s your next show
---
Looks like a troll post
---
Considering you can now store unlimited resources, and server hoping in public resets all your hardwork, just what exactly did you expect? Your own server remembering everything and working hard while you're away? Lol that delusional.
---
The server should basically be a spun up vm, that's a brand new world every time you log on, but remembers places you been too and looted just like public instances do.
---
I'm not innocent I'm a huge slut for a good collector's edition bundle 😂
---
I like to pop in and fire off my minigun at super mutants. Ever since I started pretending they were Bethesda incarnate I've seen a vastly large increase in gib rate, far exceeding that of my previous sessions. To top it off I'm not even properly geared for maximum heavy weapon damage, just relying on the Junkie's prefix and some psycho. 
---
I do have a habit of wasting ammo, firing rounds into the dead bodies, with some giving that satisfactory burst of meat. I primarily choose super mutants to be representative of Bethesda cause they tend to carry loose screws and broken skulls.
---
I have a rig with dual GTX 980's. Stable so far aside from bugs you listed.
---
It just works - todd Howard
---
I'm sorry to hear that. Do plan on getting The Outer Worlds to see if that is more of the Fallout experience you were looking for with 76?
---
Personally, I liked the idea of Fallout 76, and if I were to develop it I would have made it a singleplayer focused game that had optional co-op so you could play with friends, rather than an MMO-like experience.
---
Oh. Okay. Ty
---
Do you think that the Tent and Scrap box should have been made free for everyone? 
---
Edit: Grammar
---
Only on the inside
---
I mean yeah its not pay to win, its pay to lose now
---
Look at the top comment in that thread.
---
&gt;You can't seriously believe this lol wow
---
hahahahahaha what a chump
---
Are you telling me that this game has support?
---
Surprised todd howard post on reddit
---
The experience a game offers is its content. Private servers create a different experience, one oft-requested in response to solicitation of feedback regarding the experience of this game. 
---
You’re being too literal.
---
It is not preexisting. People are finding looted areas because they do not know about their previously looted items list. Junk world items are personal. Each player sees their own. When you pick one up, it adds it to a list. The list doesn't respawn those items until you pick up enough other junk items to knock the oldest off the list. The dude who wrote the Forbes article spent 10 minutes reading reddit posts from ignorant players.
---
yay! now it doesnt suck ;-)
---
I haven’t bought it, and I never plan to.
---
1. I honestly don’t care that much about it.  I understand why the servers were paid for, and I was a little ticked off that subscribers received the “scrap box” but otherwise it doesn’t affect me so I don’t really care that much.
---
2. I know that the private worlds are exactly “private” and heard rumors that the scrap box is bugged, but I think Bethesda will improve it.  As long as they take time to truly make the private worlds correctly (adding whitelisting/blacklisting, making them available 24/7 to anybody who is whitelisted) I think everything will pan out fine.
---
3. It hasn’t really changed my view of Bethesda.  I think that they are just using Fallout 76 for easy money and I think it’s a scum bag move to play off their “pay to win” (as many people have exaggerated) as what the players want.  But, nonetheless, I will continue to play this game and enjoy it for what it is.
---
Fuck no, it's garbage. $13 is too fucking expensive for 1 outfit and a worthless virtual currency that is *just not enough* for one full outfit so you have to buy more of their shitty currency.
---
This is nothing more than a filthy cashgrab, a desperate last effort to squeeze a little more money out of this dying game. If they want to make money, they need to PUT IN ACTUAL EFFORT in the form of big expansions, like Destiny 2 and FF:XIV. Not charge $18 for some pixels, while doing nothing else to get this game off life-support. And even then they even have the fucking audacity to propose a subscription model that is legitimately the worst one I have witnessed in my life.
---
Bethesda is done for I'm afraid, if this is their best then TES:VI and Starfield are absolutely doomed.
---
It's more like pay for status.
---
I like your POV on this. I'm going to go with this because it makes me happy
---
i will research this personally soon
---
It's called a shitpost.
---
I'm certain they won't charge more than whatever the EGS is charging. I expect that they'll put out the Super Mega Ultimate GOTY Gold Platinum Edition and charge $60 for that.
---
A couple things for both myself and several friends. We each buy $10 of atoms each month. $3 more for more atoms, goodies, and a ‘us only’ instance is pretty nice. We don’t PVP, so workshops are a hassle, stuff is farmed when we get there, etc.  Being able to stick up on fusion cores, lead, etc in a low stress spot is nice. We’ll still mainly play on the regular servers, BUT being able to do whatever without other players is a nice bonus.
---
Bethesda really needs to up the "private server" quality. 
---
Biggest thing they need to do is... Persistent World. I'm paying for the server, it should stay up after I disconnect, so that friends can still join and build up on what is there. It shouldn't go away when I log off. 
---
I see no point at the moment of a private server if it doesn't stay after I log off. My friends and I all have wildly different play times, and having a world that we could build up would be great. But it's just not possible with the current set up.
---
If you quit the game, give your stuff.
---
Go read the patch notes where they explain what they'll add in the future. Camp budget was included.
---
When you're a global market, a few hundred thousand fewer people in one country isn't too worrying if you can shit in a box and make a billion dollars worldwide.  One man's money just isn't worth very much any more.  These days, a company has to commit several murders before they see a dip in sales.
---
Guys. Just delete the game. 
---
It’s not getting any better from here.
---
Enemies can retake your workshop. Youll get it as a mission to fight waves of enemies. It usually just stops any resource collecting as they destroy anything you place and you have to kill them all again. I dont believe youll become wanted for defending yourself from another player unless you just keep going after each other but not 100% on that actually.
---
That doesn’t change that up front they said they were going to control anything and charge for it. 
---
I agree, we still don’t know how mods would work and I wouldn’t be surprised if it works like creation club.  
---
But, regardless, they told us it’s on their servers and they will charge us for it.  No one should have had an expectation for something different 1 year later.
---
Can I have your loot?
---
Speak for yourself.
---
I wish I was capable. Instead, I just log on and play and have fun
---
I reinstalled fallout 4. Would like to thank the modding community for once again saving the day when Bethesda decides they want to "Improve" their games.
---
I am not well informed on that matter. How much do servers cost? Just a quick google search showed €5-15 servers for CS:go or Minecraft. But putting that into comparison with Fallout is beyond my capabilities. 
---
Bethesda probably also has the means to buy server capacity in bulk, which should significantly reduce the price.
---
It comes out tonight at 12 but can be pre loaded
---
Personally got it because I otherwise also spent the same amount on atoms and this way I got the outfit as well. May cancel the subscription before the next month who knows. But I would also agree that yes, the scrapbox and the survival tent should be for everyone. They had originally promised that the scrap would not effect our stashes. I say to stay faithful to it, it should be given to everyone (**once the bug that causes it to sometimes delete your scrap is fixed**). I also believe the survival tent should be access through say some kind of Responders Masters level survival test. Essentially it would require you to gather the tent supplies, camping equipment, etc from several locations and do some knowledge check of some basic survival tips such as the best place to set up a tent, how to make a safe fire, etc. 
---
Also I like what Aurick\_411 suggested by adding the outfit to the atom shop for 700 for all and still having it included in the subscription.
---
wait a sec, are you saying people actually paid for this thing? heck, now I'm rooting for Bathesda, if people are stupid enough to be this exploited then they deserve to get ripped off...
---
That’s fine, but please understand others are very much against private servers and do care about it being in the game.
---
Whoah, and you picked "today" to come out of your coma?
---
It happens when you log into a world and you force close the game and log into the other world. It happened to me and someone said they figured it and posted how it happened. I had started to load into a public world by mistake and closed my game down and the reloaded into a private world. Test it by putting a small bit of junk in your stash box.
---
Not today but late September
---
Been playing it since Season Of The Forge...Shadowkeep changed everything everyone knew about D2 prior to it. PvP is in a MUCH better state, and PvE they're still working on but it's better than it was. It's also in the top 5 of most players active on Steam...so can't be as bad as you're making it out to be.
---
So it’s inconvenient unless you pay?
---
&gt;I am against it also
---
&gt;It's the only game I ever play now
---
I'm sorry, homie, but pick one. Play something else, or stop complaining, because this shit was something anyone could see coming a mile away.
---
Thats just a wild concept to me. Thats like buying a stove at full price and only being able to use on burner unless you pay every time you want to use another one.
---
you should do more of em :)
---
When they will not change it, I won't buy anything ever again in Fallout 76!
---
Nah, I’m good thanks.
---
I’m glad I got to try it out on Xbox insider’s beta program which made sure that I never spent my money on it. 
---
It could’ve been a great game, but it has an immense amount of bullshit problems and controversies.
---
Premium problems for premium subscribers. You get more!
---
Alrighty then.
---
r/EMOJIPOLICE ON THE GROUND NORMIE
---
There's going to be some people that storm in here claiming it isn't pay to win while holding their Todd Howard body pillow. But I agree, remove them and reduce the price to 10$ a month. People would pay for a server, an outfit and some atoms monthly. Stop supporting this, it will only get worse.
---
Hey-yo!
---
Ooo boohoo. Let me play the worlds tiniest violin (read in Mr krabs voice plz)
---
OP probably doesn’t even own the game but saw some outrage youtuber being angry and wanted to join in
---
The amount of mothers that let their 12 year olds play an M-rated game is just staggering.
---
Hide in da boosh
---
Im busy enjoying the new stuff that I paid for so I dont really have time to call names on the internet right now
---
Running Windows 7
---
My friends and I are experiencing game crashes and lag in the private servers, so I guess you're one of the lucky ones. Lol
---
ESO is really good now and its been my favorite mmo Ive played but I’ve never played FO76 but it looks terrible and has looked terrible since the beginning
---
Its terrible, run. 😴
---
Mb they would have more profit if they didn’t launch the game as a broken mess and left it like that a year later while adding more and more microtransactions 🙃
---
Until they start slipping us that Polish sausage.
---
Every fucken game I've ever played has bugs.
---
By felecia.
---
I called it the second they said mods would be a private-only feature.  Oh no, these aren't "paid mods," they are simply mods you'll "pay" to use! 
---
MWAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
And yes, I knew the game was fucked for no other reason that blocking "mods" for the first year.  BGS doesn't put out bug fixes, they rely on modders to do that.  BGS doesn't make good games, they make a good creation kit! What BGS simply doesn't understand is that they already make $$$$ from mods.  There are people that have bought 37 versions of Skyrim (just through their toaster), who do so knowing they'll have mod access on all those titles. Sure, there are plenty of customers that never play a single mod.  But it's become such a huge part of the experience, people buy the games JUST for the mods.  They know even if they don't like the base game, mods will fix it.  They know if they get bored, mods will fix it.  They know if BGS broke the game, mods will fix it.  BETHESDA ALREADY MAKES $$$$$ FROM THE MODS! 
---
\*sigh\* But it's never enough. So we not only got mods delayed for a year to prop up the Atom shop, but mods gated behind a paywall all the same.
---
So you’re a 9 year old. Makes sense considering you play 76
---
In what were they right, in whining to get free stuff? Their game, their moves. You don't even need a Scrapbox given that you have all been playing so long without even knowing it could have even existed. 
---
Now all of a sudden everyone needs it, and wants it for free. This is simply pathetic.
---
Let me play the worlds tiniest violin for you. You’ll also buy the next elder scrolls game. No questions asked
---
Not 76. LMAO
---
I bought them :(
---
Did I sound like I was whining? I’m not. I’m just trying to watch out for the future of this game.
---
I guess time will tell, my group has only been on twice for a couple hours. Sorry to hear that. It’ll get fixed though.
---
Played FO76 as my main game for 7 months untill I couldn’t take there 2 step forward 8 step back approach to patching then watching them hit fix anything to do with their atom shop while sleeping ghouls chased my character. I go pumped when they announced human npc, then they started putting more shit in the shop and it dawned on me. It’s all talk... there’s literally no way this company can pull off a functioning addition to this game without completely breaking what they touch. And now I’m pondering whether they are back tracking their every thing free and we may yet see wastelanders delayed as they are in board meeting discussing whether this should be a paid DLC.
---
Unlimited storage. Redeployable campsite. 
---
Not P2W. No tactical advantage. Right. Because freeing up hundreds of pounds of storage doesn't mean shit right? Come on.
---
Im sorry we are talking about fallout. Specifically fallout 76 bugs that still haven’t been fixed a year out.
---
Edit-
---
To your deleted comment Yes 1 and 2 had bugs. But this is about 76. Pls stay on topic.
---
So basically, if I’m in my private server and I hit “join” on a friend who’s in a public server, that’s what causes it?
---
It's those monetization experts they hired.
---
"This game is amazing.  On a completely unrelated note, I have had $1000 mysteriously deposited into my bank account."
---
lol jk.  Bethesda wouldn't give actual money, he'd just get 1000 atoms.
---
I literally don’t care... haters gonna hate and whine... that’s Reddit for you... guess they also aren’t familiar with Reddit voting but that requires reading...
---
Oh you know those pesky immutable db item entries and integer counters. Did you know an integer could consume a whole 64 bits of storage space if it gets too large?
---
Back up your claims, silly!
---
Quantum mechanics actually forbids this
---
Has? Had.
---
This. They should have started lower scale... updated Fallout 4 to 4-7 player drop-in multiplayer. Move towards a semi-persistent server world where friend's settlements continue to exist, getting updated with every connection to online... study all the data from just this to learn how to make the foundations work, THEN, years later, go for a 76 like game... one where we actually emerge into the second fall of Appalachia and get to participate with the BoS and Enclave and all these awesome stories that apparently JUST happened that sound like a pretty compelling Fallout story.
---
I genuinely enjoy the game. The mishandling at every other step confounds me. With good iterative work from a real dedicated studio, it could be amazing... like, gaming landscape changing. But they are choosing all these weird paths that just seem to be trying to destroy it...
---
Then go back to Skyrim.
---
Give any developer an unfamiliar code base -- especially one that's been patched onto and duck taped together for the last 15 years and is now doing something it was never designed to do -- and too short of a time frame and you're going to get bugs. I'm not sure we have enough info to know how much fault rests on the developers, unless you work at Bethesda or something and know a lot more about what's going on there than I do.
---
I was one of those people, I just redownloaded it a few days ago and then this happened. Yikes.
---
GT is Splaishe on Xbox.  Feel free to look me up. I don’t understand why you think I’d be lying.
---
I guess this is it for me. First few months were fun but this game is done.
---
Glad I got platinum before all this shit started
---
So progressive
---
Yea Nintendo used to be good. It's a long debate but I believe they're pretty bad.
---
Again, I have explained why people very well could and should have expected something different. Mods were repeatedly mentioned as a feature they would support. The concept that you would have to not only pay to run any mods - even free ones - but also pay to **develop them** was not mentioned and is not something you should expect.
---
You rang!? Website should have SSL now btw. Go SEO! LOL
---
I didn’t say you were, but one person isn’t gonna make a even small difference in their pay.
---
Dupers already found new dupe, so you can buy anything you want for 2k at any market
---
Bethesda? More like Bewill-lie-through-the-plaque-of-their-green-teethesda

If Bethesda went out of business, I'd say "good".
---
Teach me senpai
---
Sure, todd howard
---
Right. They don't have shareholders.
---
The 2nd one I saw when I logged on was a 3-Star.  Dropped a sweet junkie's handmade.  Made my fucking day.
---
Well, with every new generation the ratio of people who are educated and more aware of their surroundings increases. The world is gradually becoming a better place. It is a slow process, but it is a continual process. Right now life isn't ideal, but it's better than it was the year prior. And there are going to be rough patches in the future and we're going to be facing some big challenges. But if we're able to overcome them, we should continue to improve.
---
I didn’t say I was leaving. Just that I’m not going to keep paying for something that I feel is toxic game development.
---
-Give out the tent and the scrap box and any future game affecting befits for free to all players
---
-Reduce the price of servers to maybe $60 a year.

They probably don't want to end up like EA with the most downvoted comment in history.
---
This seems like common sense from the providers POV
---
How
---
I dont remember Skyrim's horse armor, actually.
---
Is the community outrage enough to make an impact or is this just gone blow over and people are just gone give in and buy the trash they are selling? 
---
76 was more of a quick cash scam before Bathesda drops their new games in the next gen.
---
Press F to pay for respecs
---
Of course. Outer Worlds looks really good but im more excited for cyberpunk. I agree with you. F76 was a good and could of done very well. They just rushed it and are doing what you see now so.
---
They will never survive without your 12$
---
I guess you could say "Anything Goes" :)
---
Bruh the launch patch didn't tip you off that they're just using you for your money?
---
Yes. 
---
I do think they should be made available for everyone, but I’m not going to cancel or stop playing something I enjoy
---
Why do you ask for others like you? Are you trying to open an "I quit" club, so that you can complain about that too, quit it, and make another useless, karma-grabbing post in regard?
---
Well it's "pay to have infinite junk which is an important part of the game," fanboys will call it convenience. But in reality it's pay to win so yeah.
---
Reminder to never directly attack the devs over issues you have with their games. They're not responsible for what you think they're responsible for.
---
No. It’s the force closing of the game. I force close the game a lot as it sometimes does an infinite loading screen so I restart. I tried so many things earlier, like swapping from public to private, using someone else box and even thought it might have been when I used the tent but my little bit of stash I put in was still there. When I force closed it was gone.
---
I keep two leather pieces with 50% poison resistance on me to swap out if I come up against rad scorpions and mirelurks. The scorpions though are nasty and I use height and range mostly.

He could have paid 90 for the deluxe edition which included the pass. It's what I did, regrettably.

---
It's not shady, it's in daylight so broad you're being incinerated by the corona.
---
I think that having a complete product and with at least an acceptable amount of bugs is the minimum to ask from a game, I doubt anyone was happy with the shitty show it was at launch.
---
Exemplification:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8)
---
It doesn't show as "owned" in the Atom shop?
---
Real talk it was pretty obvious they were heading this direction when they announced Skyrim would be on the same piece of shit engine from the 90's they've always used.
---
I definitely wouldn’t want that. I love their games. But sometimes they just a act stupidly.
---
But he’d berate you for being asshat to other people solely due to their choice to do what they feel. So your back at zero. 
---
Let people enjoy what they want. It ain’t your money or your game.
---
Not to be smug, but how do you feel now lol
---
Then why did you bring up test servers and bug fixing, this post is about private servers in their current state.
---
Every good business has areas that are private and paid for.  You pay PlayStation to play online right.   No difference.   You want perks you pay for them if not be happy with them the base game.   All complaining does is waste time.    Cause it’s made the toxic people realize they can’t affect people that don’t want to be around toxic people. And I for one applauds Bethesda for allowing me to enjoy this game glitches and all.
---
I'll be surprised if they do fix it.
---
PC, Public and Private, Adventure mode;
---
- Switching weapons rapidly unloads all the weapons on both my wife's and my computer as well. I have a habit of checking all my weapons to make sure they are all loaded, so I swap quickly to reload them, and swapping back to the first gun after all of it will usually result in it being unloaded, and the same for the rest as well.
---
- Also had Super Mutants healing during an event to take back a power planet. Was/am not sure if this is intended or a bug. Was very hard to kill them, so I assume a bug.
---
- Still experiencing a bug where enemies will spawn in around me, and once a teammate arrives, they will also spawn in around that teammate, effectively doubling the spawns. Then it seems to sometimes glitch out where it sees me again and spawns them again, and keeps doing this until we are overrun by enemies. Happened last night as well.
---
- My wife and I decided to try out the private server to see if it was worth a damn, so we could review it to help others out on whether it is worth getting or not. A lot of the places we visited were already looted. Can confirm these are not new private servers, but rather already used and recycled ones they couldn't even be bothered to reset. I've paid for private servers on games before, but this was by far the biggest waste of money out of any of them. Haven't looked closely enough at the scrap box to see if it's deleting items for me, didn't occur to me there was going to be an issue there to be honest. Cancelled the subscription immediately after so it doesn't renew.
---
- Have had enemies kill me, then another enemy of the same type will spawn in. Not sure if it's because I died or what, but it definitely doesn't make it easier. Also had enemies kill me and then immediately heal themselves to 100%. Last night, fighting an enemy, it killed me, I came back to see two of them there this time, now at full health. Died again, came back to 3 of them.
---
- Still loads of lag in random places at random times. Checked and rechecked connections and bandwidths here. It's not me.
---
- Not sure if it's a bug, but it takes a long time to swap weapons during combat. Fired a weapon? Better believe it's going to take at least 5 seconds to switch to the next weapon because you fired that weapon. I don't care if I am in the middle of cycling the bolt on my rifle. Switch to the weapon I ask to switch to, when I ask to switch to it.
---
There's probably more, but this is just all I can think of off the top of my head. Will add them in reply to this comment if I can remember them.
---
I’ve not gone into any area that’s been looted, the only time loot is missing is when I’ve already looted the area myself previously on a different server and it hasn’t reset yet.
---
Sure, Todd
---
Himself obviously.

I've been so supportive of his shitting, so why is there now SHIT everywhere?"*
---
\-FO76 fans
---
Buh bye...
---
Aboustley no one is saying you can't have fun with the game, people are saying that the game has serious issues that aggravate in intensity over time because of Bethesda's lack of care and greed. People are angry at these problems because Bethesda refuses to fix them and continue to make them, not because you enjoy the game even with those same problems.
---
Do not forget the horribly balanced perks like scrapper, and the condition related perks that were nerfed to cause a problem. That is where I went from a loyal follower to doubting the game. So many decisions were to deliberately cheese gamers when it would have been so easy to just make a fallout game. I even tolerated the bugs, though they made the game nearly unplayable many times for me.
---
I do not even care about the stupid stash, I just considered it another mechanic and obviously their inventory system is written poorly (anytime you shifted lots of equipment or used trade interface the game died which is bad coding not deliberate I assume). But among all the annoying stuff they dwliberately made the game worse for money that is intolerable to me. I wanted to be a whale but the game lost me early and kept piling on failures and bad mojo.
---
Ok, I will record it as proof, thank you!
---
So... You don't want to pay, yet you want to dictate ROE?
---

---
Are you calling me a 12 year old? Or suggesting that only a 12 year old would think the subscription fee is a burden?
---
If the former, you’re wrong. I don’t really care if you believe me though. 
---
If the latter, you’re missing the point. I want to play a game where all players have access to the same fundamental features. Even though I payed for it myself, I feel like it’s unfair, and it keeps me from being able to fully enjoy what should be an awesome feature.
---
That's what you get for trusting Bethesda with more money
---
\-most of the playerbase
---
\+small faction of spoiled whiners.
---
So it sounds like another useless post by someone who has never played the game.
---
Go troll somewhere else
---
I've played it on my friend's console I just never bought it
---
You’re welcome.
---
Dude you're aware there are other games besides Fallout that you could play?
---
I don't disagree with you, but no one here will take you seriously when you have only played a couple of hours of the game, most of use have over 500 hours on the game. I for one have thoroughly enjoyed the game for what it was worth.
---
Who's to blame?? Bethesda. Why? Probably because they don't wanna put much more effort into this game so they decided to do the lazy shit to make money
---
I did. Freed up some space to install kf2 and some other game which I havent decided yet.
---
A few hundred pissed off redditors who play Fo76 are a beating their chests and that's a dumpster fire?

---
Yep, just straight hiding.  Try to spawn near the center of the map so you won’t have too far to run when the first circle closes in.  Try playing in non prime hours for less people in lobby, turn off team fill so you don’t drag down others, then afk if you wish.
---
That sounds like the suits at Bethesda throwing their staff under the bus. Coders are generally eager to learn new technology, and nobody wants to inherit a 15-year-old code base. If they're not adopting new engines, it's more likely because the higher ups aren't willing to invest resources into research and professional development.
---
It actually isn’t the same. When you’re paying to play online, you’re playing with others who also did the same. 
---
What bothers me about this is that I want to be playing with a wasteland of people who are on even footing. It feels dirty to pay for an advantage, like a poor community experience.
---
no, Devs need to get paid too.
---
They dont work for free, just like we dont. 
---
If you work for free, you need a new job.
---
We got an Aliens reference here and it doesn't go unnoticed
---
If you’re on a private server then you wouldn’t notice...
---
It was $60 at its buggy launch. Also, “Neckbeard betas”? We’re on Reddit, sweetheart, that’s kind of a given.
---
My biggest problem is that, at least from my point of view, they don't care about the customers anymore, just the money. Yes a business has to make money but you can make loads of it in a not scumbag way and you'll have a loyal fanbase that loves you i.e. Bethesda 5 years ago.
---
No, people have reported loosing all scrap placed I the new box
---
That’s what you think.
---
You’d think but it won’t happen, the people that still play this game every night for hours are seriously part of cult that can’t be stopped
---
Oooh! Its the "one fuck up guy"! Nice to see you again!
---
I mean this game is garbage, what did you expect? Why did you even pay for this shit?
---
I need this lol
---
for 100-150 dollars a year you absolutely should expect a server that runs when you are offline.
---
That i probably an outcome they planned for which is why the yearly price is so high. It's basically a sale but the contents of the sale are chosen for you
---
Donations are okay -   
---
But it's one HUGE grey area.   
---
If you're taking commissions -   
---
ie. Someone comes to you and says 'I'll pay you 100 dollars to put X in the game' - That's illegal to accept.   
---
But if someone comes to you and says, 'Hey, I enjoy your work, here's a hundred dollar donation.' - That's fine. As long as you're not using content in the equation.
---
Laughed a little harder then I should of at this
---
Guess I’ll have to re sell them haha
---
*attempt at free updoots denied*
---
So you're completely ignorant and you believe everything on YouTube.  I will weigh your opinion accordingly.
---
How on Earth do you deal with so much lag? I've put about 200 hours into this game and never had to deal with that much lag... does your computer suck that bad, or is it really just your bad luck to constantly get such shitty servers?
---
the original post was trash.  
---
whats your point
---
Laugh harder. Who cares if you do or don’t?
---
I don't specifically disagree with you idea of what a private server should be but there absolutely no way that style of private server is worth a $100 a year price tag.
---
Mirelurk king 👑 strongly recommends you to wear 1 piece.
---
&gt; Yes, mods were something they said they would support... on private servers.
---
[Quit your bullshit](https://i.redd.it/ftdvh66pdku31.png).
---
Like I said, they evaded the matter entirely.
---
Games great give it a go
---
Or they just disagree. I don’t like this system and I personally think they are trying to pry every cent from my pocket. But it would seem that there are people out there that are interested in FO First. Posting that comment in this thread is a waste. The OP doesn’t think it’s a turd.
---
The downvoted are deserved for a tired and misplaced comment. Good job on continuing the circle jerk. Go to a circle jerk thread. It’s inappropriate for this thread.
---
I want to give this post a standing ovation. Take my upvote instead sir and thank you for your services.
---
I believe this too. How can you explain the Diploma bug? When you place down the VTU diploma....it literally opens a portal into the future, showing you the Museum of Freedom 200 years later. How do you explain that?
---
It's more pay-for-convenience. I bought the 1month to try it out and I'm having a blast. There's more opportunities to farm like you want to since enemies will be more appropriately leveled for you and scrap will always be available.
---
Legendary enemies and events for legendary enemies still occur and at what seems like a noticeably increased rate. (Maybe I just got lucky). You don't have to worry about legendaries being killed before they mutate.
---
Like others have stated, there's no exclusive perks or op gear. All of the exclusives are cosmetics or optional. The amount of atoms rewarded as bonus is also a pretty good value as its worth more per doller. (500a=$5; 1100=$10; 1650=$13) plus the cosmetics.
---
Has the backlash been overblown? I think so. Is it unwarrented? Not entirely.
---
Also the Ranger gear looks really nice.
---
Well, what I enjoy about it has kind of changed over time.  When I first started playing (which has been since day one of release) I just enjoyed exploring the world and discovering the beautiful landscape Bethesda had constructed.  But, as I leveled up more this started boring me, so I began doing the quests.  Now it’s kind of strange that I did this, but I basically started the main quest after I was already about level 20.  So I played through almost the entire thing, and at that point I was just loving learning the story and the things that had happened in the prewar world.  Later, after I got to the last mission of launching a nuke (which I still haven’t completed, just because I am too lazy), I had reached the max level for picking perks and realized that I was doing everything wrong.  I hadn’t truly understood the idea of “build” at the time and found out I was severely underpowered.  Since then my main enjoyment has been from reperking out my main character (I’m level 116 and am currently working on a new build), getting the best weapons and armor, and getting as many caps as possible to become as powerful and rich as I can be.
---
(I’m so sorry for how long this is I got carried away)
---
If I had creative control over the game, I honestly am not too sure what I would do to make it better.  Obviously Wastelanders is going to be a big thing when it come out, but in terms of enhancing my personal enjoyment, the main thing I would want to change is not the creative aspects of the game, just the bugs.  There are still a few bugs from launch that have effected me through my entire playthrough (mainly the melee bug where damage just doesn’t register) Honestly I think if Bethesda just focused on fixing the current game and took maybe a month break from releasing new content outside of the atom shop, then the game would improve SOO much.
---
Bye. No one cares
---
More like Fallout 1st, quality second
---
That didn’t work for me.
---
I went into a private server and tried to force quit but my junk is still there
---
If those quotation marks weren't necessary I'd say they were worth it
---
Minimum effort, maximum shitpost
---
I've been killing flying bat monsters dressed like an NCR Ranger for the last day, so who's the stupid one?
---
They're greedy but not stupid. Stupid are the people who bought it.
---
Yea im probably gonna stick around to see if the Halloween event is any good then uninstall it
---
Firstly, have you ever considered, that not all people on the planet speak english perfectly? Я вот это понимаю и не придираюсь к речи людей из за простейших ошибок никак не влияющих на смысл. Being a grammar nazi is not a good tactics in an internet conversation.
---
Secondly, basicaly, your Skyrim critique is that the game is "boring". Seriously? Well, good point, but you are wrong. It is fun as hell.
---
And the last thing... Fallout 4 is much deeper than you think in terms of story. Synth crows, for example, is a good example of the level of detail bethesda put in their games story and scenery. It is just hidden, almost in a Dark Souls fashion and average player will see only boring story about finding your son. Dig deeper and you will be amazed how much lore and story you missed. Personaly, the story, ambient storytelling and secret hints is why I love this game. Not because of gunplay btw which is basic af
---
why in god's name would you trust things they say they will add "in the future"
---
hey my money has value, I should be able to demand actual value for my money, not half assed broken shit.   If anyone is entitled, it's the companies that think their shit is worth something.
---
I don't want it. I like the limited stash space. I want the game harder not even easier than it already is.
---
Fallout 76 is dead
---
:/
---
Irrelevant, but yes.  What game you might ask? Also irrelevant, and not something I share on my private account.
---
But you can criticize bad practices without being in that field.   If I get food poisoning I am not going to be like "well who am I to tell them to wash their hands, I've never been a chef"
---
Honestly dude.... if you're playing Fallout 76, you already are in the second class wagon of the Fallout train. Literally replaying any of the other games is a far better experience. More so, if you throw in mods.
---
Who is at odds?  On my area we see many more players now than ever before, and in our weekly weekend at raid night groups of 40-60 adults we are seeing a whole new batch of teens playing for the first time.  
---
Sure Niantic sometimes does stupid things, but i see more involvement now than anytime since the game started.
---
Devs most likely will not see any of this money. What I mean with my question is don’t you think players should be able to get the P2W items for free, but the private servers still cost money?
---
I liked the game at some point I think.
---
I'll pay them 12.99 a month to show me the people that asked for this bullshit
---
Why the hell do you like this game. Its utter shit
---
Weird, most of us have hundreds of hours of enjoyment in this game. Your type really doesn't belong here bandwagoning.
---
:D
---
You can just use the installer to upgrade to Windows 10 and it will use your Windows 8 license to activate it you dingus. :P
---
Like 90% of the money earned from micro transactions comes from like 5% of the player base. They don’t care about the fish they’re trying to catch whales. Those people either don’t give a fuck and have the disposable income to buy these things, or in the case of loot boxes some people have compulsions to collect everything or gambling problems. So some whales are mentally ill and being taken advantage of.
---
i need to know this!
---
I agree with you I'm just pointing out how it appears to be working right now which as you said is not optimal they need to beef up their servers of improve the way the server handles instances.
---
Who cares, so many of you are all talk. Never going to leave the game, going to hold out hope, apologize for the next DLC, say it made the game better.
---
Just wanted to let you know
---
People are complaining about a lot right now, I'm just trying to talk about something more meaningful. Time will tell on the subscription I suppose, but for now it's worth it to me.
---
Why you created this post then?
---
Yes, tell me more about how 4chan would disclose their actual information in the process of trolling people, they totally are known for doing that right?? Right??  While you're at it, I suggest you look into the concepts of "frivolous litigation", and "anti-SLAPP laws."
---
Idk they said they'd start adding more utility items and they did, if it makes them money I'm sure they'll add it.
---
Yeah I was going to buy a copy for a friend just to show them "hey, they've fixed a lot of issues"... but they keep fucking up.  The y should be going into debt to fix this shit like Final Fantasy 14 did.  Good will is a currency that spends better in the long run, and they managed to squander it all.
---
no one cares.
---
damn it, you beat me to it.
---
I played a fair bit of TESO and had no idea it was on a new engine. It seemed no better than Skyrim to me.
---
Why doesn't it bother you? This was already a game with like 160 dollar edition. This isn't a free to play game or a charity.
---
As it should be 👍
---
Good god, the amount of people who are triggered by me calmly expressing my opinion is staggering. Nowhere in this post did I shame anyone for believing differently. 
---
Do what you want with your money. All I did was share what I’d be doing with mine.
---
Don't lie to him dude
---
Wait for another fucking game to come out.
---
Welcome to Bethesda games
---
Ha ha so funny
---
Definitely not Todd Howard. I just spent too many years in academia.
---
&gt;Bethesda has succumbed to the evil known as greed
---
I thought the point of greed is to make money though?   I'm not sure I can bring myself to sped one penny on a Bethesda game after this.  The more people there are with that mindset, the less money they make   Not  everyone is like me, I know, but i don't think I'm alone.   Will be interesting to see the impact of this.
---
People who bought this should be mocked.
---
You’re missing the point dude. And I’m not oblivious to the truthfulness of your comment.
---
&gt; we keep the servers running so you don't have to
---
You really shouldn't.
---
What would you do to convince someone to starts playing, if at all?
---
This game in the state it was made in makes it impossible to do anything in the ballpark of Fortnite's playercount.  The game looks like it was made mid-2016 and its fundamentally flawed all over, as well as shitty $100 membership
---
Creators of cyberpunk would disagree
---
There is no such thing as an even playing field.  Not in games or in life. Bethesda is a company that makes games for money.  Any way they can make money they will.   And if your not willing to accept that then don’t buy the content in the first place.    There is nothing wrong with charging for private areas or getting perks for paying for it.     Hotels do it. Clubs do it. Restaurants do it.   Does that mean you won’t eat at place that has private seating cause everyone can’t go back there no.   Do you Crash private functions when you see them cause you should be able to go there.   Private is paid for so we don’t have to deal with the childish mentality of most people.
---
I got given some and told you can craft them only at the work bench at project paradise I  assumed  you used them like Chems and they either attracted or detected creatures depending on your preference.
---
You deserve it for giving them more money
---
I wouldn't waste precious mats like that!
---
Not getting into a long debate, but basically yes games like smash are amazing. But they are lazy with many games and other options. No Netflix on release. Garbage online.
---
Absolutely, make sure you get the latest halloween vending machine and put the ‘uninstall’ on it too👌
---
oh don't worry about that, it'll be for sale for everyone, but you also need to have 1st memebership in order to buy it.
---
I bought it, bought a one month subscription. I’m not paying for a year until I see how wastelanders pans out. 
---
1. I bought it because it’s good value for what it offers. You get more than the price cost in atoms alone plus all the additional features and ranger outfit. If you already spend $10-$15 a month in the atom shop it would be dumb not to get the subscription. Also if you’d be willing to pay 1,300 atoms for the ranger outfit you’d be dumb not to get the subscription and then cancel at the end of the month. 
---
2. My expectations for performance with this game are not very high. To be honest I’d be more surprised if something wasn’t bugged in the subscription package. I don’t know who they have working at the Austin studio but their QC is utter crap. They will fix the bugged scrap box and probably introduce another bug when doing so, that’s my expectation. Do I feel like I got my money’s worth for $13? Yes. Am I pleased with it? Yes. 
---
3. All online games have paid subscriptions and honestly you get more for your money with FO76’s paid subscription than most other games. Does that excuse the bugs/problems with the game? No. But nobody should have been surprised by this and it’s not really shocking in any way except for the people trying to get clicks on their videos. This honestly has zero influence on whether or not I play the game. Wastelanders will have the biggest influence on if I keep subscribing in the future.
---
Just uninstalled... I loved this game, and hope someday Bethesda will own up and make it right.
---
That'd be an instant ban from Bethesda Twitter,  no?
---
"Hey Bethesda, just wanted u 2 know I uninstalled 76 and bought the "real" Fallout game from the original makers.
---
for the same reason you like minecraft, that is utter shit.
---
This shouldn't be a suggestion, it should be a demand
---
Those cutaways to allies look like something that will need to be toggled off really fast.  I'll just play PoE again.
---
Exactly. I once paid $60/year for a Minecraft server that would be up 24/7 and supported myself and all my friends. I’m very disappointed to learn what we are getting for $100.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk
---
It really seems like they’ve just abandoned ship at this point, all of the community managers are just *gone*
---
There is the door.
---
That’s cool, but it isn’t an issue. People “bitching” about this subscription are simply trying to make the game better.
---
And that's why I'm going to be backing them. Bethesda has done nothing but turn this game into a dumpster fire with mistake after mistake...
---
Because it isn’t, to me. I thoroughly enjoy exploring, running silos, building my camp, killing queens, and grinding for legendaries. 
---
Even if they don’t open up access to these features, I’m probably going to keep playing. I just can’t in good faith financially support what I feel like is toxic game development, even though Bethesda games have long been my favorite.
---
&gt;what exactly did you expect? Your own server remembering everything and working hard while you're away?
---
For a $100 a year? Yes. 5+ year old games have this feature on paid servers for a lot less.
---
So did mine. Then I made new friends to play this game with. Use a mic it’s not hard.
---
I’d just like to see who in the game is on board.
---
I enjoy it :)
---
Hi - its where other people can join your single player game session as demons and you can take them out or they take you out. Sorry I have not played dark souls.
---
Take my downdoot
---
More than a."few hundred", so yeah, and y'all Bethesda apologists fervently defending this shit, and "trolling" people with whatever random nonsense bile y'all come up with is most certainly a dumpster fire.
---
They stated that they are not persistent server's.
---
Meaning they supposedly reset Everytime you and all the people you invited into the world have left 
---
The only way it will remain the same is if you never leave the instanced world or make sure someone is always there.
---
Been looking for a reason to keep playing after 200 levels. Fallout First just made me uninstall. Talk about spitting in your user bases face.
---
It's really sad how your karma committed suicide two hours from now.
---
i'm pretty sure nobody wants or thinks they got their own physical box server sitting in a room. i'm extremely certain everyone thought it would be their private instance within a server that would be their space 24/7 and remember all your shit and running nonstop. that for $12 a month is more than enough money to accomplish that.
---
Everyone on board with uninstalling isn’t in the game lmao
---
Ehh don’t care. Not a huge fan of being called names and stuff but that happens with everything now. I’ll just keep moving along keeping to myself as long as no one busts my door down and destroys my hard drive.
---
I enjoy eradicating communism.
---
Sounds like the anthem PR team.
---
No, the challenge for it in “challenges” isn’t completed either
---
I don’t know what it is, and it’s not like I’m great to begin with, but I’d say that 1/10 of the time, When combat begins against another player, the game freezes for like 2-5 seconds.....

---
&gt;“Our goal for launch–this is really new for us–is: have a well-running, robust service and then, some period later… we’re currently still designing what that service looks like, **you’ll be able to have your own private world,** and be able to mod it, and do all of that. We think, with our games, that’s where the long-term life of them really is. That is trickier when you get into an **online world** but we’re definitely committed to that, just won’t be at launch.”

---
&gt;“I don’t foresee a universe in which we allow players to come in \[to Fallout 76’s public servers\] with their own unique and different mods. If you want to run mods, they’ll have to be done on a private server,” Hines said in a recent [interview with GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-how-mods-and-private-servers-work-and-w/1100-6462371/). “You’ll be deciding what sort of mods you’re including and running, and everyone playing on that server is playing with those mods.”
---
I’m sorry, but why did anyone have any expectations that the mods would be anything other than something you could apply to only the private servers that you pay for?
---
Ight cool thx, just wanted to know im nkt renting the outfit
---
The real playerbase would just open another. 
---
Stop claiming the will of the minority is the will of everyone.
---
I’m not sure how you can record that, thought you could only record the game.
---
I can't run multiple istances of fo76 on a same computer after yesterday's patch. Second (and only second) istance crash to desktop immediatly even if i open it solo. I tryed to copy again all the files (using this method  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cb43a7/guide\_how\_to\_run\_multiple\_instances\_of\_76\_on\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cb43a7/guide_how_to_run_multiple_instances_of_76_on_a/) ) but without any success.   
---
Am i the only one?
---
Yea as long as you claim it in the atom shop you’re good to go.
---
Game pass developers continue to earn money from players as long as their game is being played. Your sub is allocated to devs based on what you’re paying. There’s an interesting interview with Phil Spencer somewhere on the tubes explaining how game pass continues to pay out to developers long after release and long after someone has played past $60 worth of membership for a single game.
---
One year has passed since release, and I still get legit angry knowing that I spent full-price on the game at launch.
---
Shouldn't Bethesda be trying to build positive PR at this point? This is the exact opposite of that.
---
Thank you for elaborating! I have no problems with you for making that decision. I just don’t want to support it myself.
---
Looks like my grammAr is about as poor as your PvP skills!
---
Trolling at it's worst. Report these kind of shit post. User never visits before and comes in to just join in on the shit slinging.
---
I dont have to prove anything to you. Lol why would you think I do?
---
VPs get a voice but their bosses on the board get the final call.
---
So buy one month, it’s 13$ you get the armor and then it’s done... wow that required a lot of thought. It would have been 1300 atoms anyway and when you get a month you get 1600 atoms bonus sooooo.
---
That’s a good point, I’ve never tried it so I didn’t know
---
Lol maybe a recording with my phone 😂
---
(Takes a bow)
---
A bit gatekeeping  but that's how you tell if someone started or enjoyed F4 more than earlier titles.
---
You can also buy a $5 Taco Bell Box for a 14 day free game pass trial, extended to 44 days if you auto subscribe. Just sayin'.
---
So you're 8 then? Seeing as how you prowl the fallout reddit lmao.
---
I would but I won't be getting off work for another 5 hours. Zombietickler86
---
doesnt the scrapbox just disappear once your sub runs out?
---
No, we all no pretty much suckers still play Fo76. It's not a surprise that anyone pays for this garbage. It's basically the only players they have left. Luckily every NCR ranger you meet, you instantly know is a damn idiot.
---
I never record but thought it was only while the game was running you could.
---
Why the hell would you build your house where everyone has been nuking since pretty much day 1? That's 100% on you.
---
People nuke it often because it used to be a very high density for legendary enemies and nuking the ghouls would accomplish a few things such as turning them into guaranteed max level, often more legendary enemies, and more stars on those legendary enemies. And it has a high amount of easy to grab raw flux.
---
I mean unarmed is technically melee
---
I payed your mom.
---
Yeah well that shows the level of intelligence those people crying are bringing with them.
---
No I totally get you with making the game more annoying. I think Bethesda prioritizes 1. Making the game annoying and limited to get daily logins instead of long sessions and 2. To create artificial problems that will eventually lead to monetization.
---
Bet man thx for the help
---
A small percentage of 'em are. The ones that you see higher up trying to rationalize their purchase. Their thought processes are amusing.
---
Oh go take your gatekeeping to your parents, as they’re probably the only ones who care about your shitty opinion.
---
No problem 👍🏽
---
I wouldn’t say last. We got obsidian still making great content as usual, and hopefully Bethesda will stick with making great single player games in the future. I mean 76 is definitely the worst thing they’ve put out and it’s the biggest controversy they ever had , hands down. EA and Activision have been fumbling and stirring up trouble for years already. I’d wait till starfield to see if Bethesda really has gone too far.
---
Uninstalled. Ps4
---
So you dont even play the game and have this strong of an opinion.
---
After all the bugs I've read about I just cant! Lol get lost dude.
---
Yes, more content is definitely more fun! How about letting us hack the Sentry Bots so we can chrome them out and ride them around The Whitesprings?!?!
---
Edit: They did add Legendary Scorchbeasts for all, forgot about that!
---
Already on it my man. Cant wait.
---
God bless.  Maybe I'll get a subscription to fallout 1st for Christmas.
---
“Uninstall and Re-install the game” 
---
....Yeah let me spend hours doing that. SMD.
---
I have some idea... thinking programmatically here.
---
Depending on how they did the box, it might conflict if 2 players with FO 1st get into the same world.
---
they might have access to each other's boxes, so people complaining their boxes ate their stuffs might, in real, be stollen by other players.
---
It's a kinda far possibility, but it is a possibility.
---
To be honest the 30 isn't my main. But I figured with all the people saying they are leaving maybe I could get some free swag. It was worth a shot. Also grind for the atom shop? I grind 8 hours a day at work so I don't have to.
---
The shitty thing about the internet is that people are free to share idiotic opinions about things they have no reason to share opinions about.
---
No one asked for your sympathy. Why did you even come to this sub??
---
The."private servers"  are not private. I've spent my day spamming the servers and made my way into at least 20 "private servers"
---
Ive looted their session and had several players chase and threaten me to leave their private server.  I did after looting their world
---
😂😂
---
Great idea -Bethesda sales team
---
The real reason is the crafting bag. I subbed to Eso+ just for it.
---
I think you are missing the point. I’m going to be blunt.
---
No one cares.
---
Reddit gamers are fucking hilarious.
---
I was given ammo during a queen run by someone
---
Maybe we should wait until their next proper single player release? I mean 76, as much as it was underwhelming, it was never meant to be the new standard.
---
Yes, done on all 3 pc's. Bethesda launcher uninstalled as well.
---
I know but it gets confused with certain one handed perks.
---
Have you considered that the team involved isn't making enough money to make the game viable from a business standpoint, and that they love it as much as we do and are trying to make it profitable so they have jobs and we have a game?
---
Wait, you didn't know this game existed till yesterday and bought it today? The r/patientgamers in me is having a heart attack. I've known about TOW since December and will likely buy it December 2020.
---
I uninstalled mine, it really fucking hurts to do it but I absolutely refuse to pay for game features when I tried to support them by spending more than the games full tricentennial edition price on cosmetics
---
it’s called a joke
---
Aye glad to see Bethesda is bringing recycling into the post apocalypse
---
Agreed. The scrap box should be for everyone, and it was a dick move.
---
I wouldn't go quite as far to say they are lying about inability to integrate it without technical issues though. I think their inability to integrate unlimited items only applies to certain things, such as guns/armor/etc. Junk is a different story, because junk is always the same. 
---
Weapons and armor have varying degrees of durability. That's a value that needs to be stored. Each pixel of durability difference is going to be a different value. Weapons and armor have various mods equipped on them. Each mod is going to have a different value that needs to be stored. Legendary effects are going to be a value, etc etc.
---
Junk is always the same, doesn't have durability, doesn't have mods, can't be legendary, and the only values that would need to be accounted for are the name and the amount of them. I'm surprised the scrap boxes are somehow losing the junk people are putting in them lol. Who's running that shit show?
---
If you cannot even spell Paid correctly, then maybe thats the reason you cant Pay.
---
This uproar is becomming more clear every hour.
---
Still better than Mass Effect Andromeda. Now that was some soul crushing crap.
---
it was 1€ for me for one month and then 3.99€
---
amazing deal tbh
---
I am, all my free time is split pretty evenly between FO76 and Elite Dangerous. Sadly both are going through a 'developer mismanagement' phase right now.
---
Lol, I had one where crafting a new Ultracite PA set with super duper on it equipped 2x right arms at the same time and was able to mod them independently, the bugs in Bethesda games never ceases to make me laugh lol.
---
For every one person who quits, another person subscribes. For both these individuals there’s double the number of individuals who don’t give a shit and don’t read Reddit and will play like any other day.
---
Tru7h. I found out about and thought, "Nice... who do I know that I can give fake tacos to?"... still haven't a clue, but thought I'd throw it out there for anyone that does.
---
Exactly, you have no proof and you’re talking out of your ass, 76’s player base is dwindling you fanboy ;)
---
&gt; I’m sorry, but why did anyone have any expectations that the mods would be anything other than something you could apply to only the private servers that you pay for?
---
Because literally every time some company has tried that it's failed horribly, and rightfully so. 
---
Also, you're sort of cherry picking your quotes there. Your first article literally discusses fears of a "paid mods" situation and tries to put those fears to rest:
---
&gt; Not to mention that some spectators have been concerned that the Creation Club DLC microtransaction store popping up in Bethesda’s recent games might shove plain ol’ mods out. But nah, Bethesda Game Studios director Todd Howard has said, “We love mods, and so we are 100% committed to doing that in 76 as well.”
---
In other words, they asked Bethesda if mods would cost money, and Bethesda's response was "no". Saying "well technically the mods don't cost money, just the servers you need to run them" is disingenuous at best.
---
So again, quit your bullshit.
---
Yeah, that sounds exactly like it. Forced PvP in your world. Dark souls did have the some co-op factions that helped mitigate it some, otherwise griefers would wait at choke points where they knew the host would be engaged, and then kill them while they were fighting AI's.
---
Can't say I'm enthused about it being added to the new Doom, but I'll wait to see how it's actually implemented.
---
It'd be nice to be able to save your CAMP and when entering private / adventure server it asks which you want to use.
---
Adventure would simply have the larger option greeted out... Kind of like when it asks if you want to stay on world or find another if your spot is taken.
---
How about we blame both
---
Thank you friend, I'll return the favour. :)
---
Agreed. Only way to hurt them is a large amount of people moving on.
---
I have no problem with them charging for private servers. I just don’t think a full priced game should be charging for in game advantages on top of that.
---
You make a fair point, and that’s true in life. 
---
But it shouldn’t be true in games. I don’t want to feel like I payed for an advantage. I’d feel the same way if this was a sport, and they serve similar niches. It’s a competitive environment and I want to feel like I got what I got on even footing, only because I worked hard at it.
---
Purchased and enjoying
---
Nice try,  todd Howard
---
It’s easy to ask for stuff for free but we aren’t the ones that have to develop and maintain it.  Anyone who has  played the game over 20-30 hours has gotten your 60$ worth.   After that at least some players need to supplement the development of his game.  Employees and offices and servers are not free.   And any business would be stupid to continue to spend $ on these things without bringing any $ back in. 
---
Serious players who can afford it will pay for the Premium features, and the rest of the non-paying players will continue to benefit from the rest of the free content that they continue to release using the support from the paying players ... it is a pretty standard model actually.  
---
But if no one is paying then no one will be playing at all.
---
It's just stored information, not actual items.
---
At least cite the relevant part from th e website,  before you attempt to say checkmate. 
---
From grammarly.com
---
" The correct past tense of the verb pay is paid, as long as the word is used in the financial or transactional sense. If the verb pay is used in a nautical sense, the correct form is payed. What can you do with the verb pay? You can pay for college, vacations, or utilities."
---
Jokes aside, there is a big difference between long-term capitalism and short-term money grabs. Bethesda is clearly opting for the latter. However, I bet they would make a lot more money if they went for the former and invested in the game -- hire lots of devs to fix the bugs, implement the QOL changes like perk card loadouts and chat, and frequently deliver new content. This would cost the company money in the short term but bring in money in the long term due to the increase in the number of players.
---
Whatever features were in past fallout games should have been AT LEAST implemented either in the beginning or layer on with NO PAYWALL. There is absolutely no excuse as to why they retracted their "cosmetic only" statement, why they decided to RIP off people with a broken service that has an unreasonable price tag, and why they continue to lie to everyone. I honestly cannot comprehend how people like you are somehow in some way trying to make an excuse for this behavior. No wonder people like you get seen as demented or completely brain dead.
---
Hang on?! Monthly payments for a single player game? What the fish?
---
I was on my way to your house but I guess you ruined it now so I'll turn around
---
&gt;  The fact you have literally turned into a Villain in this industry  
---
My knowledge of the gaming industry is not as vast as some of you folks here.  But based on what little I know, it looks as though Bethesda has surpassed Blizzard, EA and Activision in terms of pure sleaziness with the Fallout 1st nonsense.  Is that an accurate assessment?
---
Sick.. not gonna need a private server after ya’ll leave and open shit up. This worked out alright in the end imo.
---
Honestly, you kind of missed the point. I agree with you, most peole probably will. 
---
Nobody is mad about the subscription itself, no one would care for a subscriber skin, emotes and monthly Atoms.
---
ITS THEIR GOD DAMN LIES - "Stash is limited by Server Capacities! We can't give you more", "Only cosmetic microtransactions!", "Everything post launch will be free!"
---
Im someone who'd be willing to sign a subscription - but not if I would pay for something that SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE BEGINNING AND FOR FREE. I don'z mind paying Amazon, Netflix, Origin Premier, Swtor, etc. a monthly fee. But those things are all working and they don't hide anything behind paywalls. 
---
Lets take SWTOR - first of all, its Free-to-play, and once you signed the subscription YOU DONT NEED ANYMORE MICROTRANSACTIONS since you can buy EVERYTHING at the auction house from other players and can unlock everything you want in a reasonable amout of time. In the last two months, with casual gaming, I bought cash-shop items for the IN-GAME CURRENCY from other players with \~150€ worth. Something thats just not possible in F76.
---
16x times the monetization detail
---
Australia has to tax people in order to pay tribute to the Emus after losing the great Emu war of ‘32
---
Also if you're gunna comment on the quality of the game, make sure you've actually played it. That's a metric this community is seriously lacking
---
It’s literally just buying a private server like 90% of MMOs have. It also happens to have extra features. The outrage is overblown and is only happening for free internet points
---
You are part of the problem.
---
ah maybee, it just reactivated a lot af dissapointed fans who left the game a long time ago, but coming back to this subreddit to tell Bethesda to go fuck itself. Kind of same for me, i quit after the fridge, but i'am a huge Fallout fan and i won't go silent on this. I'am still very sad how they destroyed me most loved franchise.
---
You make no sense. Maybe let your thoughts marinate for a bit longer?
---
Or like $8 a month, or something like that. People like to use the $100 a month option to make the whole thing look infinitely worse. I can pay for a year of PS+ or just pay for it monthly, Fallout 1st is the same way from what I've gathered.
---
Yeah I legit may have considered this if it was priced reasonably, but it's nearly $200 Australian. There is no way I can justify that cost, it's beyond outrageous.
---
It looks cool but im kinda happy i dont care about those skins that much anyway. i love my arktos lab coat with the matching backpack for now :)
---
Couldn't have missed the point harder if you tried.
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with the liquor. They just licensed it out.
---
Lol I seriously don't understand why so many people who have never played the game come here and expect people to listen to what they have to say. Seriously laughable. We are all laughing at you
---
Someone's actually paying for this? Sad and dumb.
---
I'll agree they're priced high already as a unit, a problem inherent with digital currency and artificial scarcity across the board. I'm more pointing out that if you *were* to spend that money on atoms directly, you'd end up with less atoms overall.
---
Yeah but... if you are counting on your Switch to access Netflix then your priorities are... odd. And yeah, the online stuff is bad, but we were originally talking about games, not consoles. SoOoOo.... 
---
Nintendo: 1 
---
Bethesda: 0 
---
Game, Set, Match, Nintendo. Haha. 
---
Just messing around man, like what you like. That's the beauty of having options.
---
I use two pieces of poison resist and the damage I take is almost nonexistent to all but Mirelurk queens, their acid spray still does a lot of damage.
---
Level 390, played since stress test. Still going to continue playing with my girlfriend. Also bought the subscription
---
Dont forget the God NCR armor +0 to all stats. Damn man. Damn..
---
Do you think they are just trying to sell us the unpopulated server space they already have. And if that is true they have been holding out on the junk storage option till they had enough empty server space to sell. And if that's true they just pushed back the wastelanders update to sell these servers. Why couldn't they just do what ark did,  say it is a beta charge 30 dollars for it, tell us the truth that there will be bugs and resets,and then when they work out them to the point it can go to retail up the price.
---
Bring tribute and we are good.
---
No... monthly payments for a service that has tons of games. Fallout 1st is $100 for one game for a year this is $56 for dozens of games for a year.
---
and you encourage them with every dime you throw their way for each piece of subpar, infinitely reproducible, piece of digital trash they push out.
---
If you stop supporting them, you get them to think about what they are doing instead of just letting them milk you.
---
Modders produce better content for free.  support them.
---
I concur.   That way when the whiners whine about the next time Bethesda ruins their life I can reference that list and go: Hey, didnt you quit this game in May....and June.....and October?
---
0
---
You are correct, thank you.
---
Your correct, checked number of posts on Xbox club and same number as usual for weekdays, for those who don't what the Xbox club is its clubs for each game where you can recruit a squad for something particular or announce your doing a queen fight in 5 mins and to join but mostly people selling their wares but still as popular as it was last week.
---
I’m not bullshitting anything.
---
Before the game was released:
---
* mods would be supported on private servers
---
* private servers were hosted by bethesda
---
* private servers were going to cost money.
---
Nothing they said was a lie.  People just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe.    I’m not some seer, I knew this was coming.
---
Wasnt this game made by a new office that was bought out by Bethesda and told to create FO76??  
---
As in, not the original dev office that created other fallout games?
---
lol you care.
---
So many Zombies!
---
Lmao no you are. Crying over nothing, just stop threatening to quit and quit already so the rest of us can enjoy the game.
---
Yep same here.
---
It’s only competitive if you play that way.  And if your not willing to pay to play if you are competitive PVP then you are either gonna have to be really lucky or be really good.    Cause people pay to win all the time.    Why do you think some people get paid millions to play a sport and others on the same team get paid less.  Cause those that get paid more win more.  Same thing. Can’t be denied.
---
 im sorry but really you guys are just blind.
---
They are taking for me, why??? easy, they announce they game will be free of microtransation outside cosmetics. Cool
---
Them they star adding P2W items (p2w items give you a edge from players that dont buy those items)
---
Them they add this sub to private servers something that was announce, and they said there wont be paid DLC. And literrally this is a paid DLC adding another function to the game.
---
SO YEAH FUCK PAIDTHESDA
---
Sounds like they touched base on everything that people have stated was wrong. 
---
What's wrong with this update.  Did you expect them to recode and fix everything in an hour?
---
Made me lol
---
people have..and their scrap stashes are eating their scrap and losing it, their"private" worlds are looted, have dead NPCs, etc...and i guess anyone on your friends list or who friended you can join your so called "private" world at any time..
---
oh yeah, if it's YOUR proviate world because you purchased the pass, your friends have to wait for you to be on to play on it...they can't just rejoin a private server unless that person that started it is online..
---
I betcha TES 6 gets released with a free copy of skyrim.
---
During beta, it did delete itself
---
You should have heeded the warning.
---
Sounds like you've found a way to get your $60 worth for sure! Lol
---
I get your point entirely. But it isn't as simple as that.  You don't have random people jumping in and exploiting server crashes. You don't have the people that are duping till the server crashes. You can avoid all the people that are sketchily inviting you to group to grief you. Your workshops are 100% safe and yours till you leave. I like to make workshop cities and 10% of the time eventually someone comes to troll. Having a server where you know your house is going to load with friends is nice. The same goes for going to places and finding them unlooted. Magazines,bobbleheads and lead weights are all sitting there for you. Anything thats pre looted and dead is from being active in a public map or what you have taken already within the allocated timer. When you nuke a place you know it wont be stolen or your house ...if your friends arent evil. To top it off the cap is half of a public server so it shouldn't have nearly as many problems as a public server making it a better place to do the things you need to.
---
That said you shouldn't have to pay to be free of any of that. But that's not what they gave us. So for some who are still inclined to play or enjoy it. It's the best option they have albeit it being a  sleazy money grubbing one.
---
Understood will deliver some grilled radroach and tasty vegetable medley soup
---
Funny, I was sitting on &gt;80k ultracite. 50 ammo before the private servers. It didn't really take me that long to farm it out either certainly less than a month. You too could do that if you actually tried
---
&gt; I’m not bullshitting anything.
---
You're repeating flawed logic over and over trying to declare something as irrational as 2+2=5. **Again, asked point blank if mods would cost money Bethesda said no.** They lied. The end.
---
Your bullshit is both real and stale.
---
For a game that is a half-assed asset flip full of bugs from the original game(Fo4)?
---
thumbs up for this!
---
Wish you were on PC buddy
---
Right!
---
So for outer worlds ist one payment and play for ever?
---
If I could muster up the ability to care about your comment I would down vote it, but Bethesda got the last fuck I had to give for the day, sorry dude.  Christmas is right around the corner though.
---
See you in a few months.
---
People keep claiming the devs never made an online game, despite the developers at BattleCry having years of industry experience on other projects before BattleCry. 
---
It's obvious Fallout 76 is different than most games of it's type. They still give you most of the freedoms you get in their single player games (that most games have yet to even try to replicate at scale) despite the multiplayer complications. They could dumb down the mechanics quite a bit and clear up a lot of bugs, but I think a lot of people want Fallout 4's gameplay but online.
---
Thanks for the emotional exit
---
What a funny joke.
---
Outer Worlds opens in 13 minutes.
---
Name checks out.
---
Currently have the ranger armor as of last night and I love it it was my favorite armor in New vegas from the lonesome road dlc so Im stoked there might be a chance the add the variants from the dlc
---
I did quit. Despite wanting to believe the best in bethesda.
---
Haha fair point. I’m not on a fence though :) I firmly know where I stand. I love this game, and I want to financially support its continued development. But I can’t do that with a clean conscience if they keep making bad faith design decisions that exclude some of the community. But yea, I guess I’m not in either camp though.
---
Yeah I equipped my PA over my DCG the other day. The gauntlet rendered but melee'ing anyone just hit for damage as if I was simply punching them without any weapon on. I think it will also be a simple graphical glitch in your case as well.
---
ESO is another joke when it comes to monetisation- 
---
- full $60 price tag
---
- unlimited storage behind a subscription. Game is designed to add new unique ingredients with every update to fill up your bank faster and force you into subscribing
---
- changing costume colours behind subscription (yea because there are devs manually painting your armours, it cost manpower montly!)
---
- subscription gives exp and money boost
---
- you need to buy shit tons of dlcs that are copy/paste pretty much.
---
- expansions that cost a full $60 each (classes and professions locked behind it)
---
- a fucking race locked behind special edition of the game
---
- only 1 mount available by playing and 100000000000000000000 mounts in item shop
---
- exp boosts bought separately in item shop
---
- loot boxes with shitty win chance
---
- game sharing blocked on consoles. It's the only game on the market that does this. They developed a code system to bypass game sharing...
---
The game is great but I quit because it became a massive money sink. Fucking lizards.
---
Nice. Outer worlds is going to smash this anyways.
---
No, the Bethesda-level troll would be that they later restore your missing scrap, only due to a bug it gets put in your normal stash instead of your scrap box, and in such high amounts that it triggers the anti-dupe "you must discard items to make room" condition. Then the only way to fix it is for you to manually discard all of your restored scrap.
---
No. It’s in his ass.
---
U are part of the problem
---
K bye.
---
What's your source on this OP?
---
Where did I say I never did? It was so buggy the first few weeks I lost hope and left.
---
Fallout servers are *far* more complex than a shitty CSGO server, even accounting for tickrates.
---
If anything the price seems right, on the other hand a bunch of morons in this sub who obviously have no idea about the actual hosting market are losing their shit, it's quite sad.
---
Some people are just such fanboys they ignore those legitimate reasons, or they’re edgelords who feel like they’re going against the grain
---
Mods don’t cost money.  You even said it yourself.  Access to the private servers is what costs money.
---
That’s not a lie, that’s again people just being stupid for thinking anything else.
---
I don't know.  It may well be that there's enough people who will buy into whatever Bethesda's selling.  I just can't be one of them.  This feels like a real slap in the face to many of us who have been there since the Beta and have suffered through countless bugs and crashes.  This is our reward. Thanks for nothing Bethesda.
---
Also, was that a drop site V9 reference? “Don’t stand on the fence!”
---
If so, flawless execution!
---
That's what my original message said, I was just saying they didn't advertise it was dedicated?
---
jokes on you the game deleted itself last time I opened the launcher instead of downloading a patch
---
Edit for clarity: you only use payed in the nautical sense.  I am not claiming that it isn't a word.
---
Okay, Todd. Whatever lie helps you sleep at night.
---
Sure, but in this sub? Everyone is angry all the time. I truly don't care, I enjoy the game I have fun playing it. I am considering unsubbing from this subreddit though because my feed is being spammed with all the same shit from everyone why is trying to get easy upvotes.
---
Well...bye. Give someone your stuff first.
---
Word. Got hope Wastelanders will be worth returning for.
---
Subscribed myself. This and iRacing are basically all I play anymore. $10 a month for how much I enjoy this game is well worth it.
---
If the people here knew about iracing pay structure they would probably stoke out and die.
---
Your girlfriend needs a new boyfriend
---
From what I've been reading, so long as you avoid using the scrapbox, its basically easy mode for players that can't work out the basic mechanics of an online game. Its kind of adorable, reading about people able to tinker around in their safe zone unabated.
---
No, all these posts are getting slightly annoying tho. The salt levels are damn high
---
True. I was being glib when I probably shouldn't have.
---
Outer worlds is out now if you are on xbox
---
Are you referring to the scrap box or the fast travel marker? I see those as issues to. As for paying for private servers through Bethesda, I don't remember exactly what Pete said but if you have to get them from Bethesda, isn't it standard to pay in any game that has private dedicated servers? If someone is hosting for you?
---
I dont understand how everyone just automatically assumes people are gonna pay for it if they aren’t in a spot where they can do so. Im not stupid, I know how to budget. I only put money into games I play on a regular basis and 76 happens to be one of those. Just cause YOU disagree with choices being made doesn’t mean everyone needs to.
---
1200 hrs and still enjoying the game. Reviewed the subscription and found it doesn't benefit my playstyle. Weird, you can enjoy the game without the subscription. I find the controversy more of a commentary on gamer culture.
---
Wait, what other MMOs have totally private servers?
---
Todd: Lol. Pay us $100 and you can have god mode in our failed mmo. 
---
You: shut up and take my money.
---
Me: glad you left as now there are less and less of you on the public servers... I got what you have ..for free. 
---
Reddit works.
---
I think that making a better product will literally sell itself and would help their public image immensely. This only hurts their fans and doesn't make the product better, just optionally more expensive.
---
That's not entirely true, though. My lvl 400 character encountered lvl 9 mobs in one section of Whitespring last night, completely solo on my private server. I was like, WTF?
---
&gt; I have full sets of PvP armor, assassin, sentinel, cavalier, unyielding, and two-shot, explosive and bloodied weapons 
---
Ah, I see. You're a griefer picking on noobs with the equipment you bought off of eBay, eh?
---
I think you are wrong, and need to stop listening to the vocal minority.
---
Server population proves it.
---
Yeah I agree with that.
---
thanks
---
i dont know Morty i dont think they care anymore
---
seriously Rick?
---
This is good news.
---
This guy right here gets it. All Bethesda has to do is just throw up that ole “you get it here first!” for the subscribers and then provide us little folk with some dumpy ass lookin’ version of the tent/scrapbox/etc via gameplay. Then they could’ve just sold us all some shiny new skins for those items later on. It’s head-slappingly silly.
---
Somebody get Todd on the phone!
---
You can refund, but yeah, certain options should be there from start.
---
Aren't bf4 servers runs by 3rd party? On pc at least.
---
going off of how ESO works, when your premium sub ends, you can't add any more to the premium stash but you can withdraw as needed/automatically when crafting.
---
And offer their families 500 atoms as an apology. :P
---
What's funnier are the people who continue to defend this game and Bethesda, no matter how egregious their behaviour. I mean, what would they have to do for these guys---the actual white knights---to change their minds? Because they've pretty much done just about everything possible to torpedo this game so far.
---
Also: nice attempt to paint this as a ill-founded/hypocritical moral crusade. Sure, the language that some people use to express their disappointment/anger/whatever might fall in line with that, but nobody needs to take a assume a moral position in order to find fault with the state of this game, or the direction it's headed. No, all that is required is legitimate self-interest as a gamer/Fallout/Bethesda/RPG fan who wants a good game for their money; which is something that Bethesda has not come within a country mile of delivering, and in fact seem to be moving further away from all the time. 
---
Maybe next time you can buy a more-convincing straw man from the Atomic Store.
---
I figured it out its in the weapon wheel not the pipboy
---
Funny you equate giving your opinion to taking a shit...so appropriate!
---
😆, trust it was a job trying to find things to buy, buying recall keycards and farming fixer plans to resell keeps money flow steady. Still have 8 mules full.
---
I've got $10 that says 90% of the people in this thread who claim they're done won't actually reinstall.
---
Let’s go back to your original post:
---
&gt;The expectation was that private servers would be ones you host on your own computer. That would go hand-in-hand with modding, and (people reasoned) would be the only way modding would even be possible.
---
I showed you evidence that, before the game was launched, they said servers were going to be hosted by them and cost money.  
---
Your argument is that because they also said that mods were going to be free that somehow they lied even though they laid out at least the minimum knowledge needed to know that your original post was never going to happen.  
---
You’re mad because you were ill informed and made bad assumptions.
---
This is free money for them. God bless the paypigs.
---
Who cares. This game requires little effort to win
---
I am working towards 100%ing fallout 4 and then I thought I would give 76 a try again since a lot of additional fixes and content have come out for it.    
---
I've decided against doing that now that I realize Bethesda is using it as a shameless money grab.
---
Good to know. There have been some rumors about that.
---
No Mans Sky is a good example.  It's doing gangbusters now because the studio doesn't have a publisher breathing down their neck and they've been able to play the long game.
---
32 days later 50% off sale
---
How does one earn these rewards? Is it gaining XP in NW during the Halloween event? 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
That's cool. I've been having fun with it. Takes me back to the Mojave just a little bit :)
---

---
Despite its issues, I play FO76 more than any other game. It’s not for everyone and some of the bugs at this point are comical, but there are a lot of people who love this game.
---
I didn't think the product was bad before, and for me these changes have made the game better.
---
I purchased a month's worth of service with the open mind to purchase the year pass at the end.
---
1. I bought it because I thought it was a really good deal. I typically already spend $20 a month on Atoms so the fact that you get a handful of convenient features plus about $16 worth of Atoms is great. The convenience features are a nice plus. I play every day. The Scrap Box is nice but since I've learned to manage my stash/weight scrap junk hasn't really been an issue, so I'm going to have to relearn to pick up stuff I don't need at the time.  The secondary mini camp is nice even though I generally have plenty of caps to fast travel without worries anyways. I like playing with strangers, friends, and even solo sometimes so the idea of having my own game world to go to when I want to be solo is nice.
---
2. I expected it to possibly have a few hiccups but nothing too serious. I haven't had any issues so far.
---
3. My view hasnt been negatively affected. Many many many MMOs have some kind of subscription service. That kind of thing is needed for any kind of longevity in keeping an online game going.
---
Bethesda is Vault-Tech...
---
Considering how successful they are I would say the companies are doing it right.
---
The entire time I read the article i was seeing advertisements for Outerworld

That’s a good question. I would look to any of these game as a service type things. I don’t know for certain but I would imagine fortnite, GTA online, and many mobile games (I’m looking at you clash of clans) would use some combination of agile and traditional waterfall development.
---
A small subset of players want private servers so they can play by themselves, and are happy with the subscription. Another small subset of players want private servers so they can have the multiplayer experience they crave -- but since there are no invite/kick options and no ways to change the rules or implement mods, these players are unhappy with the subscription.
---
The largest subset of players don't care about private servers but instead want the base game to be improved -- fix the bugs, implement the quality-of-life changes that would make the game more fun (especially perk card loadouts and chat), and deliver more/better content. These players, including myself, are pissed off that Bethesda is offering Fallout 1st instead of making these improvements.
---
Looks around to see what’s NOT* broken
---
And the truth is, you’re wrong. You’re soooo wrong. There is 100% such a thing as an even playing field, in games. All of my favorite games start with an even playing field. That’s one of the reasons they’re such a good escape from real life. 
---
A key issue for me is that it breaks immersion. Every time I look at my scrap box, I’m reminded that I paid for that with real money, and that is literally the only reason I have it but my neighbor doesn’t. 
---
But I don’t want to think about money. I want to think about caps. And scavenging. And other things I would be thinking about if i was really in the wasteland.
---
It’s funny when they discuss these things like it’s the norm and ok to fix later. “Yeah we think it’s this and that we’ll figure it out later”.  Shame.
---
If it didn't happen to me, the article must be false!
---
Yeah I’m sure it’ll get upgrades. I wish it already had them, but it will.
---
Because they are willing to abandon a game they like to set a precedent for future games.
---
Im surprised todd howard has time to post on reddit
---
It's like getting 300 atoms to hoard as much as you can for a month and getting to keep an outfit and emote!
---
They fail all the time man.
---
That’s really up to you isn’t it? Depends how much you want those atoms. They are cheaper than buying atoms directly.
---
same here
---
Luv luv luv you for doing this.  Keep up the great work!
---
No. They were all 1 stars and I was just going to all the fissure sites.
---
Not on day one or preorder.  I'll wait a couple of weeks till it is in the bargain bin.  How can you possible say that Bethesda still has the same respectability of quality and player interest at their core with the dumpster fire that is Fallout 76 at release and now.  If you still have it for them then good for you.  I guess you don't expect much.
---
dude. have some self-awareness...
---
I'm very glad that more and more people are paying the money. That means the public servers are becoming less and less populated and thus  I get to have what you paid for. I think I am for this only because I'm an opportunist and your the sheep.
---
Fuck juicehead
---
Stop being outraged about products you never bought just so you can circlejerk on this shitty subreddit, there’s no point in it. If you want to criticize Bethesda talk about all the actually shitty stuff they’ve done, like destroy survival to clear space for fake private servers
---
I believe they r using containers strategy in 1st game design. So when game is not in use. The pod is destroyed. along with your progression... DUH
---
That’s why I built an automatic opening door using pressure plates.
---
yup. thats the joke
---
I play the game a lot myself still
---
Those tactics will effect the wrong kind of change. They polarize the community; who will Bethesda cater to when the community is divided? Emotional upheaval tends to discourage rational behavior. As you said, it is better to just walk away.
---
Bury it completely rocks and boulders should be fine!
---
I hadn't played in a few months, only logging in to get free stuff, sell things, and once more yesterday to record a video of my CAMP in case it gets lost, as making it was one thing about this game I enjoyed doing.
---
I presume it will be the same as the Vault-Tec U items, rewarded in increments of XP
---
But we'll see for sure in a few days time
---
I’ve found him to be very unreliable and he is often misinformed on things, which is kinda unacceptable when this is his full time job
---
Eh, I’m willing to live with that.
---
Al businesses exist to make profit. That's not short term its basic economics.
---
Youre part of the problem
---
Power to you and as I said my problem is I see the exact opposite.
---
Don't try to clickbait us, Juice Head, just tell us your points, and THEN we'll see if your video is worth watching. Which it probably isn't. Becuase your points are clickbait.
---
Add PSN or XBOX live and you got another 80$ per year on top of that
---
"we're sorry we did bad"
---
.. how did they forget to make the private worlds private
---
Wanting a basic invite only feature is entitled? Jesus christ talk about low standards.
---
Adios!
---
if you get the one month do you get to keep all the swag (outfit and emotes) after the month is over?
---
I would argue most MMOs with a subscription service are free-to-play to help players be welcomed into the game, then use the subscription as a way to help enhance the experience, or go past a certain section of the game/level cap.
---
If Fallout 76 announced it will be going free to play on the same day as the service's announcement, as well as those who paid for the game getting a year's worth of subscription for free, it'd be a lot better and the community wouldn't have reacted so negetively.
---
Not if it cost more to keep their servers running and employees paid. They could definitely pull the plug.
---
Seriously. I found that outfit on one of the first days of playing this game. Kinda wish I knew you. I would have charged you $10 for the outfit 😋
---
This has not happened to me (so far). Can anyone here verify first hand?
---
Oh, baby, I'm shoving you out the door so fast you won't even get to click that uninstall button.
---
This is what you get for being so entitled.
---
I'm on PC and just logged in to find everything gone.
---
And your ad hominem attacks before is the mark of a poor argument.
---
wanna know the real reason, is the same reason SW or ESO are doing it. They dont have the number of player they estimate they will have since the game is utter garbish.
---
And they cant keep the game going with just cosmetic. So they will drain every single penny from the blind fan that still for some reason outside this world have faith of Paidthesda
---
Who the fuck and why the fuck was the link downvoted
---
I would expect them to not release access to a system before they know it works! How hard is that to understand?
---
You are the very reason shit companies like Blizzard get away with this crap. Fanboys.
---
&gt; All evidence points to them lying about the inability to integrate it without technical issues
---
Well looking at how badly it currently works, they weren't wrong about it creating technical issues. Not that they care, they saw it and decided that it was good enough for a paywall.
---
They also have to make the scrapbox free for everyone and that’s literally it. No reason to bitch about it is not P2W.
---
Just pulled the trigger. I will let you know if it meets my (I think realistic) expectations.
---
Hey man if you like playing games that run on 2005 engines, have shity developers, and is boring as hell after you beat the main story line, then more power to you pal.  
---
How is this post any different than you posting about how you're going to subscribe?
---
 Do you want a cookie or something?
---
I have plenty of money to do the subscription service but I on the other hand know the value of my dollar in the market and I won't spend it supporting Bethesda.  
---
I mean seriously, I downloaded the last of us because it's free on Playstation this month. That game is from ps3 2014. It looks ten times better than this game. That's a problem.  People need to raise the standard for Bethesda or they'll keep putting out crap like this.
---
I’d say you summed up the situation pretty accurately. Think how many private servers would have to constantly be active if they were free. With the amount of strain it would cause, it would likely not make enough money to pay for creating it or the upkeep.
---
Its sad to say this but in terms of micro transactions they should have done lootbox like rewards. 
---
Not lootboxes but something like how you get free lootboxes in overwatch if you grind. Idk. The atoms arent enough to buy anything and the stuff you can buy is less than appealing. 
---
I mean imagine on your level up you recieve an item for the level up. 
---
After typing this i guess its more of a battlepass... but without paying for it. If they were gunna be in the game id rather it be like this. 14$ for a dope power armor skin is crazy. Hollow knight costs like 15$ on the switch. 
---
Idk. Im just so lost on how things seemingly keep getting worse. It really hurts man.
---
It's a fair accusation that I take no offense over. I recognize that I'm part of a larger problem, but in the argument of time vs money, the former is always more scarce for me at this point.
---
Me n son nailed a 3* last night. He was running to my room. I got a 3* scorchbeast. Come quick. While I was chasing a 3* sneaky rat horde
---
Around $60
---
Generally, slippery slopes *are* fallacies.
---
But we're officially at the bottom of the slippery slope arguments made years ago.
---
That said, it takes courage to admit you were wrong. I appreciate that.
---
I mean their first trailer for Outerworlds was basically an attempt, a perfectly timed one, at one upping the 76 launch.
---
Is it bad I’m actually thinking about it just for a dedicated server? I feel like playing on your own server would make the game 200% better. That’s if all the public events  are still there for you and your server friends... do that even mention the scope of that piece of the game?
---
You’re comparing people who enjoy Fallout 76 to people in an abusive relationship? Bethesda does not live with you and constantly threaten you. It has made a questionable business decision. OP already thinks 100$ is worth it. OP knows that the majority of the fan base is not happy and is asking whether the 100$ is going to become 50$. 
---
I think you need to step back and rethink what you posted. Or maybe consider that your view is not everyone’s and not everyone wants to hear your view.
---
Nice. Bottle it and sell your secrets.
---
Ty ty
---
Well, that’s a thought process of yours not an issue with the game.    If that’s the case then cancel go back to having inventory control be the major part of your game and cure that thought process.   Thats simple.  I suppose every time you turn on your PS4 you think I paid for that as well.  It’s a matter of what you think affects you not what really is.  That stash box alone is worth the money paid for just for letting me “play the game instead of being in a limited world.   Cause if we were in the wasteland who is gonna tell you you can’t have 35000 bags of concrete outside your house you built.    Get it.   Thought processes.  Change what you think about and how you think about it.
---
And now realize that New Vegas was a lucky shot as TOW's weaknesses are what NV had as strengths.
---
Nice, thank you. Is it like a short jingle like normal or a continuous song that plays?
---
Firstly
---
Beth is only the publisher of Doom
---
Beth is the dev and publisher of FO76
---
At most, you can expect mtx for their tacked on multiplayer
---
However doom is not like CoD. You will likely be able to turn off invasion, and you sure as shit don’t *buy* Doom for the multiplayer
---
Hopefully it will be fixed in the future when we get persistent servers.  Hopefully by then we have huge camps right with our friends.
---
Same thing.
---
Been playing since day one. I was never interested in the private servers. Iv never spent any money other then buying the game. Ill definitely keep playing because its still fun, iv got hundreds of hours in and i feel like iv more then got my moneys worth out of this game. Iv spent more money on games that iv spent much less time playing
---
I also think that the closure of Survival was strategically timed to ramp up griefing in Adventure, create bad vibes at popular public events and make workshops non viable and no longer fun for people who don’t want to fight or get murdered. Cleverly creating the perfect conditions for a mass exodus to private worlds at the soonest. It all feels a bit smelly.
---
Outer worlds
---
When you boycott, you raise awareness. Sure Reddit works, but in-game works as well. Protest in-game. 
---
What if we had a date and time we all uninstall?
---
There is no pay to win though.. if you NEED these convenience items/features then you are not that great of a gamer and you should probably take the crutch.
---
Still the firm has to have some confidence in the outcome and the firm taking on fo76 seems pretty damn experienced.
---
Allow me to emphasize this for you.
---
##IT IS ONLY "PAYED" WHEN USED IS PAST-TENSE NAUTICAL TERMS
---
Nah thanks for the offer but I already have an AAE handmade with RW and a TSE lever action with FR
---
Now   that was just childish. Can you not have a conversation without throwing insults out? You do know you're breaking both Reddit and FO76 rules doing that, ya?
---
Hey if your on ps4 can I have so.e cool stuff. I need rare outfits and legacy's
---
Nice try Todd Howard, we know it’s you
---
I get it. I just think there are better uses for it. Give your money to developers that earn it, and you can just enjoy the product they deliver without pay to win. 
---
Or don't. It's still your money and I can't tell you what to do. But the problem is being exacerbated by the fact that their predatory microtransaction models work.
---
As a Fallout fan about to pick up the game, I am happy to report that I will be staying far away from this game.
---
Save file corrupts probably.
---
I've been trying to preach some stuff like this, and yes, I still defended Bethesda while doing so at the same time, and I still like Bethesda, don't get me wrong. I know I'm a minority, but they got me fucking addicted to this game to where I have all this knowledge now and that I cant let go to waste. That said, I'm giving it a break after the Halloween event to play outer world's and MW. They've lost a ton of faith from me, but I never had too much to give them to begin with. I can still see this whole ordeal turning around and doing a ESO, but I can also see a downfall. They just need to start listening to us. They started to for a little while, but then it's like they just did a ton of meth and spiraled down making up things that they claimed we said. Idk, i like them for fallout 3. Fallout 4, is where they started to lose me. It wasn't the same expirence, whatsoever for me which is mainly my fault because I played too much of fallout 3 and NV that I just..didn't like the changes.
---
Uninstalled today for a whopping 78g back on my Xbox.  Not played for about three month as nothing to do past level 100, well 50 for a challenge.  Game is slowly being turned into fallout 4 again but you have a monthly payment and no real story.
---
Pls not that shit again
---
I disagree with hiding (a lot). I power leveled from level 7 to 98 in just a few months (evening play, about 2 hours, sometimes none). 7-20 was dauntingly annoying; I did what everyone suggested here and it *sucked* when I got found. Whether under equipped, not great perks, or just not used to the mechanic's of frog legs - it took me a little under a month to go from 7-20. It was at 20 that I decided to actually get fairly competitive with it so I could get the Hellfire Armor before Wastelanders.  I joined solo from 20-35, it took about a month; I joined with the **sole** intention of hunting people. The remainder of the month and change I played on random teams and it took me from 35-98; in that span of time I was overseer over a dozen and a half times (just to give you an idea of how not so good I actually am lol) and launched multiple nukes (something I thought was near impossible playing the hiding game).
---
By *getting good* instead of *hiding until you make it* you get to bank on creatures killed exp (because you're not worried about someone seeing you), players downed exp, and players kill exp. This stuff in accumulation with time alive, placement, and overseer XP levels you crazy quickly.
---
Also, a couple pro tips, 3rd Person View with no weapon out hiding in a bush is way OP - I've had swarms of peeps I've been able to gank thanks to this... Invest in the Camo Underarmour in the Atomic Shop and make sure it's your favorite - it was an oddly satisfying game changer. And lastly, bushes are **not as safe as you think**. Anyone that's actually *good* knows to sweep over your line of sight bushes, any enemy will turn your aiming reticle red.
---
Yeah, send us the photos!
---
I'm enjoying it.  You can stack the pumpkins, the decor is cute, and you can place the orange fog machine with the mothman smoke machine in one camp.  
---
The turrets are also really cool.  I wasn't going to get them but a friend showed me at her camp and I really like the skins.
---
What ever happened to that splinter of this sub the extremely diehard fanboys made when this sub "was too negative" and they wanted a sub to circlejerk about the game? It was for "casual" players as the main appeal IIRC
---
Not sure if you mean they can’t handle it because of server issues or not but it doesn’t really add any extra load to the servers because of the way the data is handled.. basically, from what I understand, having one steel scrap takes the same server resources as having 100 or 1,000 steel scrap. 
---
Since everyone pretty much already has at least one of every kind of scrap in their stash it wouldn’t make any difference
---
False advertising would be if they told you that you were buying a multiplayer online game and then what you actually buy is a picture book that talks about online gaming.
---
Well how rude. You do realize that you're breaking both Reddit and FO76 conduct rules by all the vulgar insults you're throwing out, right?
---
Boom, Roasted.
---
Was hopeful &amp; still am to a certain degree for Wastelanders, but it does seem like BGS is on the fence somewhat, feels like the end of the road after Wastelanders, maybe a year left or before BGS cuts their losses and kills the game off completely. GTA 5 this game is not or ever will be as far as lifespan is concerned.
---
The reason I won’t buy the subscription is because the scrapbox is high key P2W not saying anyone should do this but you can technically store unlimited mats and make a shit ton of 5.56 and sell it= stonks
---
I’m not planning on paying anymore money on the game after original purchase. I earn atoms through in game challenges, wish they were slightly easier but atom store doesn’t really have much I find appealing anyway. I’m a huge Fallout fan since Fallout 3’s release. Fallout 76 isn’t quite the type of Fallout game I want, but I did like that Bethesda was just going for it and experimenting. I play 76 casually, there’s decent exploring to be had, environmental storytelling, I also enjoy the pvp mode Nuclear Winter, surprisingly great fun. But I do miss npc’s and think they should have been in the game from the get go. It would have made the game SO much more interesting to have all these factions still out there and alive. Also miss a DJ.. 
---
Anyway, when I seen the news (actual news, not a YouTube video rant from someone who’s never actually played the game). I see it as a good thing for the game and for me as someone who does plan on playing 76 more in the future (kinda excited for npcs to return). Despite a bad launch for this game, there’s lots of people playing this game still and dedicated to it. There’s plenty of people paying for atoms directly. Fallout 1st is a great deal for those people The way I see it, and the more money going to Bethesda the better my experience will be as a casual player.
---
But I just want Fallout 5 (maybe with a separate multiplayer/co-op mode.)
---
Not as much as it would cost to make a real game.
---
&gt; In some countries this would qualify as a "Bait and Switch", where the product began to function differently than when originally purchased and advertised.
---
You are not a lawyer.  In many countries pretending to be a lawyer will get you thrown in prison.
---
this is hilarious!
---
Check the official forums. It's got a few really persistent and obnoxious defenders.
---
Sure, but doesn't this make it a better deal than those bundles? If you have it for only a month?
---
Few days ago I thought "fo76 has been out for a while now, may be worth re-installing". And I did. Then I saw all this. Uninstalled again, didn't even launch it.
---
Ugh, it's always too late
---
You were PROMISED it for free. It's not bad to want the things you were promised!
---
There is a trick that make people buy things at a insane price : First put something on a insane price , after you get a lot of complaints you lower the amount to a "normal" price And bang now you can say that you have a "great" deal with a low price , don't let them decieve you this subscription is not worth even 5$.
---
This is the kind of content i come to this sub for.
---
It comes free with Game Pass. I vaguely remember hearing about this when it was first announced, but for whatever reason it wasnt appealing to me at the time. Turns out its a great game. A pleasant surprise for sure lol
---
Yep. Go ahead and put uninstall on your camp and then leave it installed to display your futile attempt at protest yet complete hypocrisy by not uninstalling. 
---
Better yet put uninstall and then uninstall and see how much traction that gets.
---
I actually made that same suggestion on a post after the Bobby Pin weight reset that occurred way back when. Not goin to happen.....lol
---
And now you forgive it they move to the next thing.
---
Having unlimited storage or ammo doesn't make you better at the game.
---
The whole sub not just you :) you fine
---
JucieFucker is just another shill.
---
But even a game like Battlefield doesn’t charge that much for a server, and they’re run by one of the greediest companies in the world (EA)!
---
That's definitely a class action waiting to happen
---
Edit: why do I always type definately instead of definitely?
---
Because I think it’s unproductive and would only hurt the player base. What do I gain from not being able to play for 3-5 months?
---
And no I don’t want this free to play. Relying 100% on mtx is also a bad idea. And I am not paying a mandatory subscription.
---
I feel that the price I initially paid for last November was worth it. That initial cost was paid for a game that I have enjoyed greatly.
---
One weird reason why Fo76 will fail!
---
I agree it most likely won’t happen but I do think it would provide be their best bet
---
Salisbury steaks from the food plant. Stack nicely and fill up is pretty good.
---
Ok.
---
Haha 😂 fair enough 👍🏻👍🏻
---
It doesn’t imply that at all. Just because you’re not a hero doesn’t mean you’re automatically a villain. You’re choosing a weird hill to die on
---
Sorry I took away your "cool quote" pal
---
You know they buffed legendaries since then right?
---
Man... I stopped playing for like 6 months. Just picked it back up the day right BEFORE they postponed the wastelanders update. I thought okay cool i still can look forward to it and start grinding until then. 
---
Starting playing and actually having a much better time than i did at launch. I unknowingly drank someone's nukashine and was shocked when it sent me to the mire. I was actually really happy! Like i had NO idea what happened to me i had to look it up! Everyone I met  just wanted to give me stuff and i tried to give them stuff in return (lvl 27). The vendors was awesome people were actually buy my junk! And i found plans for dirt cheap! It actually hooked me. 
---
Then all of this happened and I feel disgusted. I mean i havent been as hardcore as a player as most of you, but Ive lurked for months always watching for a time to jump back in fresh. I am super sad that everyone had to wait for wastelanders and recieved this instead.
---
Give ESO a shot. It is NOT made or maintained by Bethesda, its from Zenimax. The Elder Scrolls lore and world is heavy in that game. Their are microtransactions and loot boxes but nothing is pay to win. I have several thousand hours in it and still play.
---
minecraft isn’t popular?
---
Why would they need to take the game down to improve it? Doesn’t make any sense.
---
So like every other fallout?
---
I'll bet they just take a snapshot of a servers status at the point you make your private world, and you play on that.
---
Or is it just a visual thing?
---
Just checked and $100 AUD is $68 USD, which is roughly the same price I paid for the game.
---
I noticed this as well lol
---

---
Eh I've died on this hill plenty of times. People are just upset that the cool quote from their childhood isn't actually that meaningful.
---
Gotta make do with what I have, since I'm now apparently Fallout 2nd :D
---
Weren't you the one that said this post is a discussion to the OP? Fact is the private servers could be used as a testing outlet in the future. 
---
Let me clarify, I do not think, nor do I want, the private servers to be used to test future DLC which will be free to everyone. This includes but is certainly not limited to Wastelanders. What I can see these servers being used for is to test bug fixes on. Send an email to those who have paid for FO1st, that data can be tracked pretty easily, and let them know what is being changed/tweaked/fixed and what they think exactly what the cause was. Ask for feedback. Most people, not all, would give feedback. 
---
This would allow them to test future patches on a much larger scale and get actual player feedback on if it works. I'm not saying let the subscribers dictate the path of the game but just ask for feedback from the people who are subscribed. 
---
The current state of the patches is, fix this and this but introduce/reintroduce these other 3 things. The private servers could be a way to smooth the rockyness out. 
---
The community, after all, fixed a bunch of issues in FO4 and the devs openly admitted to it. Now this was done with mods but the private servers could be a way to communicate with these people willing to dive deep and suggest otherwise unthought of solutions/scenarios. 
---
As for the current state of the private servers it gives the devs a way for the devs to generate some revenue on a year+ old game. The atomic shop has been ridiculed for its prices for nearly the life of the game. Every installation of QOL items to the store/game/both has been met with anger from the online communities followed by people threatening to quit. Now they are asking for a fee but in return giving more than the fee (double in USD) in atomic shop points monthly in return. Like it or not some people who have been playing this game for a year find this to be a decent trade off. Those people give credit where credit is due in the fact that this game running a dead engine and still pushes the envelope of modern gaming. They want to support this game and its future and are willing to pay to receive. 
---
Maybe the servers should have been free with the subscription just being for the atomic shop points monthly. However, you cant honestly believe they could handle everyone launching private servers, especially without paying. These servers are generated through them after all, all your gear and items too. I hope that with the new revenue and avenues to implement changes this game becomes better and more of the game it is intended to be. Time will tell.
---
Tax. Gaming, drink and tobacco are heavily taxed here. People don't have a say in it.
---
This game is not F2P. Even if you received it as a Christmas gift somebody somewhere still paid for it.
---
Nice. Can’t wait to test mine out later
---
Hail yourself, my man.
---
I'd like a less intrusive way if possible. My pc and I have been through a lot of shit. I can't just throw a piece of him away like that.
---
Of course they did. Skyrim/FO players saw this coming when they first tried to use steam to monetize mods under the pretense they wanted to help out those poor modders.
---
They tried paid skyrim mods in 2015, after the backlash they followed up with the creation club which they tried to pretend wasn't paid mods. Is this disappointing yes, surprising no
---
Stable? I have some.
---
Thank you for proving my point. It’s been out 2 years so far.
---

---
Can we please get the Internet Historian to update his "Fall of 76" video? I think it's time.
---
Member benefit should be private server access and atoms, maybe throw in a couple freebies, but exclusives piss me off. It says you will never enjoy this feature unless you pay up which I call taking content hostage. 
---
I can just go to Fallout 4 and have truly infinite stash, and that is just what I will do... after I spend my fun money on Outer Worlds and maybe Borderlands 3. Hopefully that will tide me over until bethesda releases a good game that gets a month worth of positive reviews.
---
Well, between the fallout 1st bombing, not even bothering to fix the damage bug, and now this, I think I finally have the motivation to uninstall once and for all. Thank you
---
Let me put it this way.  I got it at launch, and have barely played it since.  At least my best friend got me Red Dead Redemption II and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate wasn't too far off either.
---
Yeah not me. Not yet at least. But I did notice a lot of people left the game. There isnt that many players left when I log on. It's sad what Beth did to the community. It's almost like someone wanted this to fail to pin it on someone internally.
---
Yes on Xbox?
---
This is a Bethesda game, not a Blizzard game.
---
It seems tied to game crashes, at least in regards to the scrap box.
---
So people are putting scrap in the box, then the game crashes, but because it crashed it rolls back a bit (meaning it doesn't recognize that you put the scrap in the box) and so the next time you access the box to get your scrap it's not there.
---
Obviously this isn't intended behaviour, but seeing as it seems tied to game crashes rather than malicious scrap box coding, I'm going to err on the side of forgiveness, provided that Bethesda fixes the issue quickly enough.
---
sounds very logical.

I thought they would at least give free-to-play a chance after wastelanders arrives. I gues the cost for wastelanders is already allocated. The may treated this hole year as an experimenting ground how to not fuck up the community with their next game. and than after wastelanders and free to play is not sucessfull enough they shut it down or just silently abandon it.  But since yesterday i tend more to your theory. The can't be that stupid if they would not already know quite shure that this game will not see a second birthday.

It’s from the farm in the forest (workshop).  Need to power up the machine and select the food you want.
---
Step one is power up posidion. Then it has free power from the boxes in the walls. Or you could build your own power.
---
It's the place near hillfork hotdogs. Western side of the map. Use the terminal like the ammo factory and pick what you want to print. Few pre war food choices but I'm prettt sure the steaks are best bang for your buck.
---
do you remember when they made ANOTHER horse armour dlc for Fallout as a "haha, remember when we did this shit?" and they CHARGED us for the "joke"?
---
Store scrap max out on caps craft 5.56 = stonks you prolly known nothing about trading coms.
---
Yes /u/FartBoxPopper21, Xbox.
---
Ok. Bye.
---
I have been playing it for a year, and have said it’s worth it. Until today. I’m done.
---
They literally included in the FAQ that there is not currently persistence but will be in the future.
---
We used to pay 70$ for subscription and around 70$ for games
---
Sunshine medows

I counted
---
 In his first 2 pages of messages he says cuck 7 times...
---
Not really fussed about the controversies. I'm having fun in is what I feel is an over hated game.  People love to adopt others opinions, negative one's spread like butter. But thats no real concern to me.
---
However, I'm sick of being told what I'm meant to enjoy by outsiders of the fo76 community. People haven't even trialed the game and feel they have the control over what me and others do with our own free time.
---
Wait I can run 2 fog machines?  Now this is a bit more enticing.
---
GTA Online adds free, and meaningful content, there's one of many examples, checkmate.
---
If you truly believe games only make money because of micro transactions then you're truly foolish. Companies constantly have money pouring in from multiple games, games are constantly bought. Most money they get is always put to development of other games/advertisement in general, they know how much they will put into Fallout 76, and for any other game regardless of how well/poor the game does, not because of people treat the game like a go fund me product.
---
Damn you!!!!
---
Looks like you won, considering the other dude's post was forcibly removed. Kudos.
---
22 but yes
---
Bending over for daddy bethesda still? You don’t think this games been monetized enough? Certainly not enough content to justify all the monetization.
---
How does this even work? Did the game go free to play and it requires a subscription now or is this like a subscription in an already full priced game?
---
Regardless of whether its cheap or not Pete Hines himself said all DLC would be free, assuming that the Atomic shop would provide all of the funding for them, now they've added other things as well as this now.
---
Yeah... I'm done with 76. I deleted that a few hours ago. Lost total faith in Bethesda at this point... sad.. how far they've fallen....
---
&gt;The advantage you receive is having infinite amounts of ammo
---
Exactly how do you get unlimited ammo? Ammo doesn't go in the junk box, only scrap. Having said that I've got 80k+ ultracite. 50 cal ammo that I farmed in less than a month, no scrap box needed. You can too
---
You can buy the super uninstaller from the Atom shop for $20
---
the premium store is pure garbage but the game is really good I'll admit. Just don't go anywhere near that store especially the lootcrates, they're down right predatory.
---
Yeah and the atomic shop will only be cosmetic.
---
Wanna know why they aren’t playing Control for weeks and weeks? 
---
Because it’s not a live service game... you play it, enjoy it and beat it.... 
---
Not every game is designed to be an endless hamster wheel that never ends
---
I actually love ESO haha!
---
What did y’all expect? everything and anything they release is bugged to shit. Just uninstall the game and come back in a year when it’s MAYBE fixed.
---
I’ve seen this a lot what do people do when they invite you just to grieve?
---
Ive accepted a few and just assumed they want a fast travel, perks shared, or something.
---
Ok thanks a lot! I’ll try that
---
Inherent social contracts are important.
---
Yes but you pay for them and they function pretty similarly
---
They don't make games for the hundreds of thousands of us rabble anymore.
---
The big prize nowadays is finding and satisfying a couple hundred whales that will break their banks feeding their addiction.
---
Right now it looks like a Pay 2 Lose situation but that is literally one of thousands of ways for Bethesda to actually try to “revive” themselves.
---
You have to delete it manually...
---
`c:\Program Files (x86)\`[`Bethesda.net`](https://Bethesda.net) `Launcher\games\Fallout76\`
---
and
---
`c:\Users\&lt;%USERNAME%&gt;\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\`
---
Now. We do it now.
---
You need 22?
---
thats capitalism, babey !!
---
I guess thought I'd have a grace period to reconnect to the server I was just in.
---
I realize now, that isn't even how adventure works. Only if you have someone to join in said previous world.
---
I am well aware about that particular fact, but I never applied it to the private parts of this game. And now I feel like a dunce.
---
I expected something I know I shouldn't have, and I should have read the faq over again.
---
Okay I flop back to having fun.
---
Maybe if you tasted good.
---
Well we have no excuse for not see this coming now.
---
Seeing a dead horse getting beaten like this I have to admit is strangely amusing.  Why haven't they shit canned this already?  The level of retardation goin on here with this does not give me high hopes for Elder Scrolls.
---
I signed up. I’ve been playing since release, I enjoy the game, and it’s not like I didn’t pay for a WoW subscription for years while still buying the game and each expansion at full price. Overall I’m fine with it, and if I stop having fun with 76 I’ll stop giving them money for 1st.
---
I really don’t see how it’s P2W since as far as I know there’s not a win condition of “have 6k steel scrap in your stash while other players have to throw 6k steel away” and it’s not an inherently competitive game anyway. That said, I do think the scrap box and survival tent should have been an update for everyone, not locked behind 1st. I wouldn’t be surprised if giving the scrap box to everyone caused stability issues though, given past issues. In which case it almost seems like they must be counting on not that many people getting 1st? Weird.
---
Also, while I don’t really have a problem with 1st membership giving exclusive cosmetics (or even just early access to cosmetics or whatever), I do think using the NCR Ranger outfit was a shitty move. That’s an outfit basically the entire player base have been wanting since beta. Besides the fact that it probably would have made them better bank as an atom shop item, it also could have been a well-received apology/make-good freebie that earned them back some goodwill. I’d much rather have seen the first 1st exclusive outfit be something actually new, made just for 76.
---
TL;DR, I have it and I’m fine with it for me, I think some of it was a bad call though. I can understand why many wouldn’t want to get or wouldn’t like it, but I think we’re a little over the top on the outrage.
---
Lmaooooo💀💀
---
wish i can say more but i havent been on pc in a while since mine got melted a while ago
---
The issue is rare spawns might be an hour+, so every time you start your server. You should expect prob 1-2 hours til common loot spots are available.
---
Um,  Bye Felicia again.
---
What’s your gt? And it’s FartBoxPopper22
---
Was honestly my biggest letdown when it was on steam, would have loved to see the analytics of the game
---
Seems more and more like this game is controlled by two dudes in boxers, in an unfinished basement, somewhere.
---
They didn’t forget. As a company they constantly try to get by doing the bare minimum and then pass it off like “oh wow we thought this was good” after they’ve taken peoples money.
---
ESO was only a pile of trash on fire up until the HRC release then they kinda got it all together and quick... it was like a span of 4 months for them to actually fix their endgame,It’s impressive. I wish more games would acknowledge their mistake and rework it even if it takes time.
---
Because it will give them the means to implement things take things out and rework a bunch of stuff while testing it out and making sure that it all works how it’s supposed to. Hell the need a PTS so they can get people to try to break shut as well before they release patches and such
---
Sure. And for all you people who downvote me: it is something I enjoy. 
---
While you're right it's not f2p that someone else brought it, it is my right to play it. As it is your right to call me exceptional for doing so.
---
Do I agree they screwed up? Yes. That I fully friggin agree with.
---
But did you hear that they changed the atom shop music too a rich quality SpOoOokY Halloween type jam,I mean...that’s quality gaming in its Prime right?
---
Complete Sarcasm By the way.
---
Shits a fuckin joke
---
I don't think you're understanding why everyone is upset about this. Regardless of how much a server costs to rent out, if you have thousands of people paying 13$ a month you pay for that and some many times over so your point falls on deaf ears
---
Even better now because you paid for a limited time offer. You sure as hell aren't going to be compensated for the days between you buying it and it working properly
---
Oh, I see. My GT is FartBoxPopper69
---
&gt;Firstly, have you ever considered, that not all people on the planet speak english perfectly?
---
I don't care about how you speak it, I care about your spelling and grammar when you type. Considering you're the one who mentioned an essay, your decision against writing one, you're the one who made your grammar a factor. 
---
&gt;Secondly, basicaly, your Skyrim critique is that the game is "boring".
---
No, that's my opinion of Skyrim. You didn't ask me why I thought it was incredibly boring. 
---
&gt;And the last thing... Fallout 4 is much deeper than you think in terms of story. Synth crows, for example, is a good example of the level of detail bethesda put in their games story and scenery.
---
That's nothing really spectacular or clever.
---
&gt;It is just hidden, almost in a Dark Souls fashion
---
Ok, if you're seriously comparing Fallout 4's basic ass narrative to the way Souls games put lore into items and the environment, there's just no point in discussing this with you. At least Souls games add universe consistent lore. Fallout 4 couldn't even manage that.
---
I’ll agree with anyone on this page that they are money grubbing assholes but this game gets a lot of shit that it doesn’t deserve.
---
This will never work, because much worse monetisation practices are still extremely beneficial. If people will boycott now, Bethesda will learn on mistake and next game will ship without premium shop and loot boxes will be added a month later as it’s proven to work.
---
I've been sitting here since the game came out waiting for it to be good enough for me to buy it. I WANT to play this game. But Bethesda just keeps giving me reasons not to. I waited for it to be stable, then I waited for it to get content, decided I'd get it when Wastelanders launched... which was just pushed back. And now this. I don't see how Bethesda can be so bad at taking my money.
---
No it's about you wanting somthing for free. Nice try dog.
---
I fear the same too.
---
That's why they opted to 'delay' it so they have more time to milk the last of the money with the new money 1st subscription until releasing Wastelanders and after everybody became upset or shocked about the continous lack of content or quality they'll announce the shutdown of the servers in the months after
---
I said GTA online. I am not referring to the single player aspect. 
---
What does it matter how they are monitored? You asked about development. There are many different ways to monetize a game. That’s a totally different conversation lol.
---
No I am not suggesting that it should have been free to play. You can monetize things a million different ways and the core game is in great shape now.
---
I haven’t been disconnected in months and hve over 600 hrs in game. Not bad for $60.
---
Lol serves them right for being the very reason we have lootboxes, pay to win, overmonetization in every game now
---
&gt; Listen, I agree the Collectron is borderline, it can replace basic resource farming 
---
Admit it, you've never played FO76.
---
The collectron gave minuscule amounts of junk, it could never "replace basic resource farming ".
---
This whole game is a giant class action waiting to happen. I'm suprised they didn't have one yet. Well they had one for the canvas bags but that's an entirely different issue. Kind of.
---
LOL!
---
This bothered me more than it should have, ty
---
They said that "All updates will be free after launch". That's what they're referring to. Clearly a lie.
---
oh no...I'm much, much worse.. :)
---
Yes you are correct - however publisher has a large influence on the direction of the game. Destiny / Destiny 2 case in point
---
My friend online has a verbaly abusive dad and i imagined this in his voice
---
The issue seems to be related to foreclosing the program when it is loading. Don't do that. It is a bug that needs to be fixed still, but it is not just deleting everyone's items.
---
_"You don't HAVE to buy the subscription, you know!"_
---
Buddy, if I only did the things I HAD to do, I'd stare at the wall until I died.   But there are things I WANT to do.  And excuse me for being a little annoyed at long-requested functions being locked behind a paywall (a wall, mind you, I thought I had climbed over when I paid the full purchase price).  Even better, said functions apparently don't even work correctly.
---
That would be incredible
---
As a touter of the slope, I can completely disagree with this statement xD
---
Because I like playing a game? I’m not gonna delete it because you pussies are mad they added a feature that’s behind a paywall. I’m about to buy it just to say fuck y’all.
---
I do understand, I said in my original post they're being ridiculous, I was just clarifying thats not whats up for offer
---
There isnt a crime in the world that warrants eating those awful peanut candies
---
If they prove me wrong I’ll be the first to cancel on them but 76 has seen steady improvement since launch (and further missteps too, I won’t pretend otherwise), and I assume the fact that this was completed and offered doesn’t mean that further bug fixes and QoL improvements aren’t also being worked on. And I’m hoping they were being honest when they reported the delay of the next major content update was to ensure quality (admittedly I’m more cynical towards that).
---
It really doesn’t seem like they do test stuff majority of the time. I absolutely see where you’re coming from don’t get me wrong I just think there are actions they need to take somewhere in there to improve the mess they have been giving us.
---
I remember when there was a hard limit in FO4, too. That got fixed right quick. Aint happening here, my friends.
---
Just thought I'd add a different post to the group there is about 20 I'm quitting posts in a row haha no one cares if people quit playing a game
---
I'm not leaving, though even if I was I wouldn't give away anything. It would be morally incorrect in my book to deny anyone else the pleasure of hard work in building up their inventory, especially if they have access to a private world.
---
well, its sleepytime in europe and early evening in the US.
---
Most of us are still working, or asleep.
---
So  yeah, 7 people during the slowest time of the day is alot.
---
Its nice that  you can play while the rest of us work.   Maybe thats why we could afford the sub.
---
I also like how you deleted your post for getting too much heat.
---
Is the ranger armor one skin or is there multiple? I say this as there is at least 3 versions seen in the recent datamine
---
They do. It’s different testing with 10 people versus thousands. The core game is in good shape. I haven’t been disconnected in months. Terrible idea.
---
And Ark servers go 30+ people, with mods, competition for your business, choice of hosting city for best ping, etc.
---
I gotcha man, I can give you all the junk in my scrap box!
---
Not really, I just defend what I believe in and also try and have fun while I do it. If you dig enough you'll also see how I help anyone who asks on ps4. So yeah slip that right on in the suggestion box.
---
Noone cares. This is the same thing as some chick putting up a good looking picture and crying "aweee I'm so ugly" :'( You're just an attention whore.
---
I bought the 1st membership and I'm enjoying it . The only thing that bugs me about it is the people whining. Theres nothing P2W, I'm still a filthy casual. Let me enjoy my cosmetics in peace, dammit.
---
AUD$150 for 12mths, or AUD$22.95 
---
Sorry but that is more than what I spend on Game Pass and Xbox Live....
---
No, people wanted TES and Fallout with multiplayer. Not as a service.
---
Look at Skyrim together,  host your own server with the mods you want. With a player size limit you can create.
---
bugtesting before the patch so that they know of (And hopefully fix) issues before it hits live?
---
There’s no reason to care. The simple way around this is to not buy or play it. If they see that sales on it are horrible then it will actually make a statement.
---
GaMeRs RiSe Up!
---
Agree, same for me. Outer Worlds all the way
---
Honest answer? They’re not done. They will make a few adjustments to cater to this backlash without a doubt. (Don’t expect anything great). However they will probably continue their paid membership because they know it will make them money. 
---
Speaking of making them money. This franchise will continue without a doubt. They’ll probably remaster Fallout 3 along the way. My prediction is, it will be way before we see a new Fallout in the series. It’s still continuing until they genuinely start losing money.
---
You're he one hurling insults because people like a game you dont, yet you stalk the reddit lol. Get a life.
---
Look in my post history.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9pen9s/i_have_a_feeling_that_fallout_76_will_end_up_just/
---
I fucking *defended* this shit. I put a ton of time into it. I involved myself in Discord groups, launched nukes, and tried my best to enjoy it. I have the Special Edition and said helmet right here, as well as things like the Plasma Rifle they released at the same time.
---
I put so much of myself into something I thought would solve my issues with every other damn survival MMO... And Bethesda fucking betrayed that, and gave us *this*.
---
Why are you so defensive man? It’s fine to love fo76, it’s also fine that I want to see something done to show they are going to make improvements a lot of people want to see
---
The only way to save this game is to have Wastelanders be a PHENOMENAL update.
---
Is there a difference?
---
It is your right to enjoy, just like it's everyone else's right to vent their irritation at what was supposed to be an, if not awesome, at least fully functional, game.
---
Oh please. I paid $60 for this game and have over 600 hours in the game. I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. Quit acting like you have suffered some great tragedy and they somehow need to make it up to you.
---
I just didn't think I needed the /s
---
Yeah I was gonna say, Bethesda's track records with bugs is pretty bad no matter when you look at it. FO4 was super smooth, and I could barely finish NV with how buggy it was.
---
You are really upset pal. Breathe and go play an anime turn based game to make you feel better.
---
What do you mean whiny. No one talks to each other.
---
How are they not losing money though? Just no overhead? It seems insane to me they’d launch this today of all days, when Outer Worlds is out too - it seems like there might be a lot of people moving over from Fallout
---
Also even one of the maps is as big as 76's, has a whole lot more of content and quality and now take into consideration that you have multiple of those huge maps on the game's continent to explore
---
The subscriptions might be similar but trying to compare the games themselves is like comparing an watermelon with a raisin and say they're the same
---
General rule of thumb is to just do whatever you were gonna do anyway, no need to let people sway you 1 way or the other.
---
More freeloaders looking for handouts. 
---
How about no.  You want the 1st perks, pay for it like the rest of us. 
---
If you dont want to pay .... bye felicia
---
Outfit and helmet, i love it.
---
Dude it's 730 EST. Most people are not working. You may want to check your time again. And the reason why I deleted the post is because of asshats like you that can't have a discussion instead come up with comical immature things to say instead of actually discussing something like a mature adult. But is that over your head?
---
I'm genuinely in awe. I quit this game a long time ago around about the sheepsquatch quests being added but keep up with updates seeing it constantly decline.
---
I didnt actually think it could get this bad now though
---
People are paying £13/£100 for absolutely fucking NOTHING. Actually they are paying for something,  a poorly detailed outfit that genuinely looks worse than its fallout new Vegas counterpart, the privalage of having all their scrap deleted and an already used world. 
---
Nobody can defend this. There is NO defence. I cant wait for this lawsuit to finally push through to the end. Befucksda deserves it. Fucking scum, a company I used to look up to.
---
Another person that doesn’t play or own FO76 thinking we care about his opinion.
---
To call this merely a "questionable business decision" is a major understatement to say the least. This isn't simply "questionable", it is a collection of recklessly idiotic and anti-consumer practices that don't actually benefit anyone in the long term, neither company nor consumer. Abuse can take many forms, it doesn't have to be physical or otherwise threatening to your life and I compare this to abusive relationships (physical or psychological) because the core principles and ideas are the same. This isn't about opinion, it isn't about what I think "sucks" or is worth it or whatever, it's a question of how much abuse and disrespect (in any form) can someone withstand to see and still remain by the person or company's side. Again, to paint a picture, arguing that this is "worth it because x" is the same as someone attempting to justify their abusive relationship by the fact that their partner is attractive or rich or whatever.
---
Fallout has a passionate fan base (passionate is code word for something here) and I have to just learn to let people vent. I play and enjoy the game but at the end of the day, it's just entertainment. I wish more people would realize that, or maybe I'm the one missing something for being preoccupied with how people react to entertainment (or other people's enjoyment of it).
---
Maybe look to the other side of the nuke to figure out what they're avoiding? Or just bad aim. Lots of people only care about the club house, to the point they will center a nuke on it and miss other enemy spawn locations. Could also be that they too built their camp too close to WS and are avoiding nuiing their own house.
---
More will likely release.
---
Yes. I think the problem is that the heavy's armour is the same armour that previously had the camo paint when the bug occurred, so maybe it thinks it's still painted or something.
---
Woah. I thought this was the judgement free zone
---
Oh if only you knew anything about software development. Its like this everywhere.
---
Edit: Don't want to sound like an asshole so let me clarify. I'm a developer myself and my current client literally doesn't do testing like at all. Its actually kinda terrifying but they are pushing code up until the last second for a release and then hope and pray. Not saying everywhere is like my client. Some places are great others aren't and software will get more or less testing depending on tons of factors. And unfortunately in the game industry deadlines are huge and if a developer needs to get something out it needs to get out. Not defending the practice but this is reality literally everywhere in software development not just gaming.
---
I've seen EA and Activision both in the spotlight in the last few years, it's time to go after the next evil: Zenimax Media
---
No, it needs bug fixes.
---
I am sure they test. No company releases anything without testing. But you have to understand 10 people testing in a room is different than the thousands of people buying the subscription. They will never be able to catch everything, unless you want to trade that for everything taking 5x as long to be released.
---
[This](https://scontent-msp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/73358291_1694932693970239_911727359718064128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_eui2=AeGIhTXQ9phxtvRsmX5vMIGQ_Yqg-XvVqwqWhe3kxC93mpEKlYVcfR28mdLa-yAiAthnZkXm44Tugav4yRovWffv7YRlUqBNPbI4lRGwKLyyew&amp;_nc_oc=AQlKcpL6gswtrXmMGy-2s3FFRYbtFvF53lO6sqjbVR4tinG7QqJipz0hNta1XY-KkLY&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.xx&amp;oh=d4096ecec1bd813c0106ee3995e79310&amp;oe=5E1D65C0) is exactly how I feel currently about this whole situation.
---
Really? THAT'S what you want?
---
Sorry bro, but no, that's not happening. Plus, it's probably not even Todd's fault, but the higher-ups at Zenimax.
---
Maybe so, but I don't play greedy/P2W games and I will quit playing any game that adopts similar models. I feel sorry for the people who are so hopelessly addicted to a game that they let the developers bend them over repeatedly and justify it by saying "well they need money right?"
---
I don't think I'm alone.
---
I just pulled a sick bloodied double barrel with ffr and fr from the purveyor.
---
&gt; privalage
---
They'll be the ones ~~you see in-game in NCR armor and~~\* on the sub white-knighting for Bethesda telling you that they are just supporting further development of a game they love.
---
\*thought about it and considered this criticism unfair: They purposefully put the most iconic armor of the past 3 Fallout games behind a paywall and a lot of people will find 12$ not an unfair amount for that.
---
I am explaining my point... as you asked me to
---
Fo4 was the end.
---
Them to not launch a broken product
---
Every fallout game has bugs? We can deal with it? This is why we’re in this situation
---
Perks like a game that runs without lag, frame rate drops or extended loading times. Most games have those features standard.
---
Damn right, I deleted 76 to make room for Outer Worlds!
---
I disagree about the game improving. Big nerfs to legendary spawn rates, farming nuke zones is much worse than it was at launch, nerfs to many weapons and others simply removed from the spawn pool. 
---
Fewer events, the game feels like it actually has much less to do now. They have added end game content that just doesn't work unless a server is not very populated and stable, and guess what, also a paid way to fulfill that requirement.
---
It really isn't a lie, you just disagree with others opinions. Look at the direction the game has taken, it is downhill and I think most people would agree, they probably just stopped playing and gave up hope a long time ago.
---
Okay we have to look at things objectively, if we go off the original definition then no this game is not P2W now if FO76 goes F2P then yes this does go into P2W . if you use a more fluid option this would be a newer version as you get an unattainable item that has an ingame use thus p2w.   
---
So as originally defined not P2W treating as fluid as genders this is P2W.   
---
Really though  it comes down to an overused phrase for things people do not like in a game and has lost all meaning to steer people away from bad games as it was abused by nongender binary normative alien clowns  that look like dolphins.

u/bobafett85
---
No recipe for it, same with dog food.
---
Ugh paying money each month just for a private server, screw this im gonna head on over to my minecraft server that i pay money for each month
---
...  
---
Nah i dont care either way, just waiting for new content in the form of wastelanders
---
Exactly this! Well said!
---
Make the game free to play, Fallout 1st reduced to $2 a month to entice more people to subscribe and ramp up all the cosmetics for those who want to buy them, remove daily scrip limit and remove the max cap limit.
---
Well, you also get a bottomless pit to throw your scrap into.
---
I am still at my office. 
---
Retail workers are still at work. 
---
Restaurant workers are still at work.
---
Busines doesnt really stop until 9pm.
---
Also, its still end of workday for most people in Central Mountain and Pacific time.   You forgot that the US has 4 timezones, and you are in the latest version of those. 
---
Might want to learn a bit of geography, it would also help if you look at normal business hours for most of working america.   
---
Very few people leave work before 5pm, then there is commute time, meals, chores, and all the other stuff normal productive people do before sitting down to veg to a game every night.

I appreciate your optimism. If we fight hard enough for a better tomorrow, the struggles of today may seem worth the blood and tears that are shed every day on this earth. But if instead we allow apathy and complacency to control our current lives we will be complicite in the dismemberment of the structure, progress and positivity wrought by the human species, and our children will perish in torment for the faults of their parents.

Free Hong Kong, Fuck Trump, Mickey Mouse is the Antichrist.

Fallout 4 was fine. F76 shows a lot of improvements over various things that were iffy about Fo4 like weapon degradation being absent, removing the voiced protagonists, a lot of improvements to the crafting/building systems.
---
Nobody gives a fuck about your opinion either, you Ubisoft bootlicking shill. Just go back to your "private" server and enjoy your junk-eating storage container.
---
Also happy cake day. :)
---
Thanks friend.  I like you
---
You should. its amazing
---
just upvote..i want the karma! lol
---
Optional but not required your address aswell.
---
On this I agree with you. I just get irritable for people who want to act like I ran thru here naked because I said I'll play. 
---
Sorry. I'm trying to avoid being AITA. I get that people are mad. I'm also a bit irritable over this shit as well.
---
Hahaha
---
No thanks, I’m enjoying the outer worlds :) troll
---
I dont know where you're from but I'm in the U.S. and here we believe in the idea of innocent until proven guilty so I stand by everything I've said.
---
Yeah i was just looking at 12 i have no use for on xbox gt Stoop962messae me
---
News for you aswell «bud». Everyone on this sub dont play this game. So many following just to be able to shitpost.

*I thought I had it all togethaaaa*

You've been seeing new people because they had a $10 sale a week ago.  This is the natural progression of failing online games, they kill the base price, then charge for premium subscriptions to circumvent the things that make the game tedious.  Experience boosts, currency boosts, in the case of 76 it's engine mechanics problems.  I still hop on myself to do my daily vault 94 runs towards my 3rd set of strangler heart, but I'm not going to give them more money to make bad games.  I prefer to buy DLC from companies who said something was impossible, and then when they figured out it wasn't, gave it to everyone for free.  Oh, and have actual dedicated servers where I can build a 4 acre castle without arbitrary placeable budgets.
---
Says the person who posted 4 times about buying the pass, you’re the one without a life lmao ;)
---
Someone's cranky they spent 160 dollars on dogshit.
---
Please quote a single entitled thing I said. The title of my post literally says that I will happily continue paying for LESS exclusivity in the features I get to use. That’s the opposite of entitled. That’s me trying to ensure that everyone else gets to have as much fun playing the game as I do.
---
Oh, I know they don't give a shit. They are still making money off apparently a large number of people. Who? Idk. I don't know anyone who actually pays for them. But all I'm saying is the fault isn't all at Bethesda, Zenimax is pushing alot of it. Idk if Bethesda is allowed to say no or not, considering there is probably some contract between the 2
---
But you are welcome to leave. 
---
If you dont enjoy it, dont play it.
---
for the love of god.
---
Isnt if you need it or no if a item that you can get with money and void the grind that take getting it. THAT IS A PAID TO WIN ITEM. 
---
THOSE ARE THE ITEM THAT CELLPHONE GAME CELL EVERY DAY ON ANY GAME YOU PLAY.
---
WHY ARE SO BLIND THE PPL THAT PLAY THIS GAME GOOD LORD:
---
Don’t get it doe, it’s bugged and when you put items into the stash. It deletes all items
---
Did people really think private servers would be free? Dedicated servers cost money to run. Not $100/year, to be sure, but there's a cost. If it were $3-$5 a month for your own private, permanent server that anybody with the right credentials could log in to, that'd be reasonable.
---
This bullshit isn't reasonable, but neither is the idea of free private servers or modded public servers.
---
Must be too soon for jokes haha
---
They are implementing public test servers next year...
---
No, I asked about what is good for consumers. And you listed games that were incomplete at the start but were free to play, or were reduced price, and were honest about the state of the game.  My issue with Bethesda isn't with development it's with it's shitty consumer practices. Which I have stated multiple times was the issue.
---
What do you mean?
---
It will walk around saying stuff and every so often a random piece of scrap will appear in the collector behind it. It doesn't have any 'pick up' animations and placing it on or near a junk node does not have any effect on the collection rate.
---
Oh I get it now. It’s funny because it’s stupid.
---
Winky faces make you feel good. I'm happy I want that for you.
---
Bring up your favorites wheel and look at the text at bottom of screen
---
&gt; Popular games = bad 
---
&gt;That's why I only play minecraft
---
Oh?
---
Im not playing it anymore. Haven't touched it in weeks. Just deleted the game off my system to make room for Outer Worlds.
---
You’re just coming off as hostile maybe I’m taking it the wrong way, either way I see you’re point to an extent. What you’d you suggest for performance and winning back some players trust. Also I understand some people will see this as a non issue.
---
Go take a shower or something man enough posts talking about the same shit in so little time.
---
Ok keep insulting calling other people troll. Lol if you're enjoying it then get off the fallout reddit.
---
But Bethesda took his home, first born and sold his partner to raiders for caps on the dollar, he just wants reparations.
---
You’re a pathetic liar too, get some sleep kid
---
That is a point I can get behind, not having to pay for it. But unfortunately I understand that if people like something as much as most of is wastelanders do, then Beth will always find a way to profit.  
---
I love having discussions without getting angry or resentful.  Just good debate the way it used to be.  I’m 42 no need to name call or get huffy.  Lol. I just open doors people can walk in if they want.    It’s all about perspective.  Change that and watch how your thought process changes effortlessly.
---
They don't have to care anymore, they have the Chinese and Indian and whatever other markets to exploit now.
---
I understand and that's probably the best thing to do if you still want to play. But with them pushing back content and their main focus being the atom shop and now subs i cant support this
---
The game doesn't need saving. People have been saying this same type of thing since launch and the game is doing just fine.
---
Or are they?
---
I've had the game on my PC since it came out but deleted it. I also deleted ESO and had that game on my PC since it game out. Screw these people. First they screwed over the ESO people by putting things that were in the original game behind a paywall, like coloring your outfits. Now they take things that should have been in this game from the beginning and charge for it. I don't care that they want to charge for fake private servers. But the unlimited scrap and larger camp. These fucks said it was because of stability concerns. DCDeacon said there would be no limit. Then had to backtrack and said there was a limit on scrap for important reasons. I guess it was cash.
---
To be fair, he had his fingers crossed behind his back while saying this.
---
Who posts about games they don’t play? Losers.
---
I paid $60 at launch for this game and have 600 hours in. I definitely got my money’s worth. Sorry you don’t feel the same. I’m happy with content that’s been added and will be added.
---
Keep rage typing, i have time.
---
Im on xb1. GT is "GrodGrobGobGlob". Quitters send me free stoof.
---
Logged in for the first time in weeks today just to uninstall the game.  Will not buy next Elder Scrolls until I'm sure it's not going to be another scam design - Fallout is dead.
---
Depends on the comment probably.
---
Why you still here.
---
That's actually kind of part of the problem here, their priorities are horrible. They focus on new content instead of fixing existing content because they're trying to get people into the game, but a lot of the people who I see quit do so because of the bugs and lag. If they'd focus on fixes BEFORE they started throwing a whole bunch of extra crap into the mixer then they'd have a much easier time of maintaining the servers, as opposed to making the mess far far worse before it gets better. PTR/PTS should be much, much higher on the timetable yet they treat it like a 'Oh well we'll get to it eventually'.
---
Me. No. Thanks for your opinion.
---
How do you think we got to where we are now with microtransactions? Literally horse armor.
---
You know my name, but I dont know yours. Funny how that works, huh.
---
It's entertainment. If there are people who enjoy it, then it fulfills it's purpose. If it's not harming people, then who are we to judge for how someone spends their free time?
---
use
---
s/ 
---
I've been caught out by this to.
---
The first event I had was Swarm of Suitors, I didn’t manage to stop the second wave and had to fight the queen, and man that was a way more fun fight solo. Barely stayed alive bouncing all over the damn campground.
---
I have zero performance issues... I don’t really know how to respond to that. Making the game unplayable isn’t going to win anyone back lol
---
I am sorry a corporation that made a toy you didnt like isnt bending over backwards to make what you want. 
---
Thats not how companies work. 
---
Dont like the toy, go find another to play with.  
---
Why not just make a new character
---
It's available in the UK and almost every region. It will unlock by local time zone which is either now or in the next few hours. No need to change now.
---
&gt;if I claimed one and someone contested it and I fought back, does this make us both hostile?(or whatever fo76’s equivalent is) and treat us as if we where just randomly attacking each other for no reason? 
---
I do not  believe fo76 has a system like this. If you  have a workshop you are more open to being attacked, but you will not get a bounty on your head for pvping like this
---
I hope so. Lights are too expensive to place.
---
Oh, Juicehead. Well, part of it is his thought, and part of it is public. Zenimax has been open about looking for outside investors, which would lead to more demand in profits from games to make them attract more investors. With them forcing it, it is more of a thought. But it makes sense, considering that's how alot of these publishers do it to devs.
---
Post could use a little more tact but I wouldn’t call someone opposing over monetization and under delivering on content a loser, behind all the inflammatory language he’s right
---
I do not need this... information.  I am already aware of all of.. your.. locations.
---
I have a habit of doing that. I played WoW for years constantly deleting characters until my favorite class came out, the Death Knight
---
No... I’m just stating a fact. They are responding and doing the right thing. You can say you want them to be faster but you shouldn’t ignore what they are doing.
---
You can't it disappeared :(
---
Amen
---
Look at wall in build mode
---
this. great comment and exactly my thoughts.... I've more than gotten my money's worth.
---
I think they should be more concerned than angry. WoW paved the path for buying yearly expansions. CoD paved the way for season passes. Fortnite opened up pandoras fucking box on drip fed content and overpriced microtransactions. Fallout could lead us to the age of microsubcriptions. No this isnt a new idea to pay for private servers, but the premium players separation is cancer for a franchise. Look at battlefield 4. Its fun as heck but it possibly one of the most divided communities I've ever seen. You have casuals, hardcore players, private servers only players, people who only play one map that was part of a 15 dollar expansion.  Your guna see the same 30 people when you play that game. This could happen to the rest of the gaming industry if more companies wanna drive that wedge between f2p and premium players.
---
Its an option in the favorites wheel.  Then it drops just like a camp peice.
---
Are seriously gonna spend $100 Or $12 a month for that shit
---
Lol what? People are greedy if they don’t give you stuff?
---
They’re not losing money because they already got everyone’s money from purchasing the game. They only needed (unintelligent guess) 1 million sales before they made their money back. They got their money back! So from here it’s a matter of funding new projects while they slowly fix the pile of mess they made off Fallout 76. 
---
You’re absolutely right with Outer Worlds being a competitor. However the majority  of people moving over are ones who already quit playing 76. You gotta think, at this point the only players on are hardcore completionists. There’s others, sure, but that’s Bethesda’s demographic. So Bethesda knows by launching this membership, they’re guaranteed at least $100,000. That’s easily enough to fund the time they take to “patch” their games. 
---
From here, it’s a matter of how well their Doom release performs. Secondly, how quick they can release their new Elder Scrolls game. If both go according to plan and perform well. EXPECT the fallout franchise along with all their other franchises to continue.
---
Irony and sarcasm is pretty much impossible on Reddit.
---
This seems to just track trophy data so it wouldn't be able to filter between purchasers and folks who just did a free weekend; considering the first trophy is to leave the vault.
---
The video game industry lives on a slippery slope. Give them anything at all, they will cement it as the new status quo and reach for more. History has proven that with DLCs, pre-orders, premium editions, microtransactions in full price games and basically anything publishers saw ripe for exploitation.
---
Consumers stood idle for too long, going "Eh, it could be worse" and "Oh, well. At least it's not X". Now we are down here in the muck, asking for the basics, like a functioning game with content. This is how far everything is gone.
---
The money is only worth the fees it cost to pay for your private server and the atoms per month. Everything else should have either been in the game (survival tent and scrapbox) or an atomic shop item (like the ranger outfit and emotes)
---
Are you implying IGN doesn't just echo chamber what people want to hear to get clicks?
---
Most of the posts asking for this stiff was full of people saying they would buy atoms to get the things if they were added to the game, so yeah they did listen and give what was asked for.
---
Exactly 😂
---
See ya next week.
---
I don’t care what they need otherwise i will buy atoms to support the game even tho i don’t care much about cosmetics. I will play what i like and i will pay for what has value for me, i will not buy the game just because everyone likes it, I need to like it, i will not quit playing just because of fake outrage on Reddit and YouTube, but I will stop playing if my personal experience will be bad.
---
Brutal. Just to play the game on PlayStation 4 you already needed to pay for the monthly psn subscription.
---
Edit: I logged on and looked and it’s just for a 8 person friends only server. I have no friends 😭
---
No one is forced to buy anything. Just saying
---
I never even close to purchasing the game. Why would I after disastrous reviews from people I trusted. But this is the developer of Morrowind. And even skyrim (although there was already a noticeable decline). It infuriates me that the company has been so currupted and infilitrated by corporate types that they are now a company to be destroyed
---
Ur not really a "unicorn" you're a "whale". The kind of person they can sink their harpoon into. Ur already contemplating buying fallout first which a person with ANY sense after seeing all the happening would stay well away from, even people who've kept playing from day 1 are leaving.
---
All ur buying is a shitty version of an outfit from a previous game (of which fallout 4 has an amazing mod version of with 10x the quality), the ability to loose all ur scrap and a used world that isnt new at all, just not being used right now.
---
$100 or $10 u shouldn't buy it period. Stand with all the other players who want a better 76.
---
It’s never too soon for jokes
---
hey, thanks! someone has to make a mistake and broadcast it first. just consider it a public service. who reads faqs anyways?
---
I'm a hard core noncompletionist, have done very little, just bum around enjoying the view.
---
Good question
---
You're part of the problem
---
Is it good? I was deciding if I should buy it, get it on sale, or skip on it
---
Why would anybody pay money for elder scrolls 6. It’s definitely not going to be anything compared to Skyrim. I agree with you. Bethesda was always the example of what a video game company should be. Now it’s just a flat out joke
---
Unlikely. You'd likely end up being offline and unable to connect to the game... or just in a regular server with other players.
---
Legendary enemy has mutated!
---
You are not getting a better game, you are getting the same shit to keep you hanging on and hoping while they milk as much money as they can from it before shuttering it.
---
The real issue here is integrity.
---
Division 1 was a buggy content bare live service, made a ton of money but ubisoft wouldn't put money into making it into what they promised, because they got their money. 
---
You are same type of person that argued that pedo caches being added were to help fund content after we also paid for a season pass. No extra content and all the funding went straight to division 2
---
Square enix had ff14 flop hard. What did they do? Shut it down, put money into fixing it and make it what they promised.
---
See the difference? I'll see you again while you defend the lunchboxes they are going to add
---
*Berserker's heavy breathing*
---
Met tons of cool people attacking everyone (nearly) that I see.
---
How is something that is optional feeling forced on you?
---
Its still being brigaded.
---
It will calm down in a day or 2 once they realize they cant sway the real fans.
---
People who enjoy this game mostly stopped posting here because the shit-show of bitching is an omnipresent tidal way of unceasing obnoxiousness.
---
I mean, Christ almighty. We get it - you don't like any decision Bethesda has ever made, and you're actively working on developing your telekinetic powers so you can give their entire team ass cancer. But how about you just, y'know, *leave* instead?
---
There are literally zero people who honestly could say they aren't frustrated or even disappointed by this game. But some of us play it anyway, because the annoyances present don't exceed the enjoyment the game brings us.
---
Walls work! lol
---
Leave Fallout forums now and be really done... or are you just gonna troll? 
---
Paywall must be the two bit word of the day...
---
Hey man I've been here since launch stirring things up! Give credit where it's due! 
---
Joking aside it has been terrible watching this unfold.
---
I like subbing to gaming subs and watching how things develop. And man has this been a ride.
---
Days Gone was pretty great, as well! Although I will say, at least RDR2 and GTAV do have long, deep campaigns, so I wouldn’t say it’s totally similar - the entire game of 76 is online.
---
Nope comrade commies are still here
---
I bet they are plans that will drop for the Halloween event in a few days.
---
How about an irish goodbye instead?
---
I keep seeing Red Dead PC and Outer Worlds ads while browsing this sub
---
12.99 a month
---
&gt; I admit, I'm not a Fallout fan 
---
Oh dear :(
---
Yeah man those YouTube fuckers suck. And yes it’s still all fucked
---
"Haven't been disconnected in months" lmfao, yeah sure dude. I cringe every time I read that from a fanboy.
---
The memes
---
Fair enough. Just remember that they purposely designed your game to be worse so they could sell you a way to make it better.
---
Keep in mind now that the groupthink defending the game will attack anyone who doesn't 110% love 76. While there are legitimate criticism to be laid at 76s door, the circlejerk that is white knighting 76 is crazy right now. My advice, type your post then read it and delete it or they'll come after your karma.
---
Thats a Texas sized 10-4 there good buddy.
---
Game cost over 100 million supposedly, only sold 2.5 mil copies first week I think, so they barely broke even, manipulating the ignorant masses with overpriced mtxs and now this senseless subscription will probably finally start bringing them back out of the red.
---
You give him a week?
---
I give him 11 minutes!
---
Yep completely right "revolutions" don't tend to benefit those who participate (it's more of a long term thing). I just don't want anyone disillusion themselves and come running back the moment bethesda writes another empty apology letter
---
I do so there!
---
That’s ridiculous - I’ve played and liked it for a year - the developers and news today is ridiculous. That’s my issue.
---
Happy cake day, although it's a lie.
---
\-.- sad
---
You picked the wrong time to ask this question.
---
They fixed that one light bulb in that place in the map that no one goes to; should be a pleasant surprise for Fallout 1st's and 2nd's to happen upon.
---
Wonder who is downvoting general comments??? Trolls are trolling... haters gotta hate...lol
---
Give this man his award.
---
At least FO4 had content and wasn’t monetized to this degree, although there were subtle signs with how they did dlc for 4.
---
Underrated post tbh
---
Or just about anyone who has served in the military.
---
LUL
---
Probably. She is too good to me i don't deserve it.
---
I has definitely changed. I have a shotgun build along with the perks to increase longevity and high chance to auto repair when attacking. I NEVER had to repair my shotguns before repair kits (EDIT: never is a bit strong, I should say NEVER had them break and would they lose about 1/5th "health" in 100+ hours play). 
---
Now they break after a couple of hours use.
---
Yeah, it's still working and it looks awesome
---
Lol, fuck Bathesda and fuck the people stupid enough to buy this.
---
Right haha
---
It's really hard to tell if it's incompetence or greed with Bethesda
---
Sadly true. Will anyone really remember 76 in 2026? I doubt it.
---
Wow, didn't even wish him a happy cake day?
---
You know what, just for that, your "I do" doesn't even count; it counts negative. So actually, thanks for agreeing with me.
---
Feel about what?  They released more novelties that accomplish nothing you can't already do in game.  It's the same shit people complain about every time Bethesda releases something just with a new name, and just like every other time a week or so from now everyone will be bored with complaining about it and go back to playing the game like nothing ever happened until they see some new novelty they hate but are pissed off they can't have for free and start the complaining all over again.
---
Or they can simply fix this piece of shit game
---
No, looking forward to Wastelanders.  Sorry, no company for your misery here.
---
I just want Bethesda to reduce the fucking price of this monstrosity! Reduce the price monthly and yearly by at least 70% minimum or make it free!
---
You magnificent bastard, you...
---
Oh it's a scrapbox.  It'll scrap anything you put in it.
---
BOYCOTT BETHESDA
---
Which one is with the subscription?
---
https://i.imgur.com/tZR4gZv.png
---
Oh they are seeing it. The small increase of funds they received from this has a huge toll on them in the future.
---
Skyrim together isn't the best example, they stole code from SKSE.
---
I have. 3*
---
I think everyone claiming to uninstall needs to delete/scrap/or sell their gear before doing so.  
---
After all this game has been through, the bugs, crashes, glitches, no npcs, dlc delayed, repair kits, fridges,etc...if people put up with all that to suddenly reach a breaking point over f1st, ima call BS and say put up or shut up Lol.
---
Delete gear then show some proof in the salt filled post, then, and only then will the 100th post like this mean anything.
---
Im not happy with the game right now. But I do like it enough not to abandon it. I may take a break, but Im not gonna karma farm and post Im uninstalling esp since I've been through the trenches with f76 like most of you
---
&gt;Thank you for helping the money role in.
---
roll* in
---
I'm not sayin'...but I'm just sayin'.
---
No it didn't. Maybe you were young but it was a shooter with the depth of a penny. The writers checked out ages ago an no one seems to mind.
---
I know that everyone wants money. For me the question is how much for good experience, one pizza a month? I’m fine with that, randomised loot boxes to drain all my money? I’m out
---
Gonna be blunt here: Serves the people right that paid for it.
---
How anybody could still feel like Bethesda has earned that subscription fee is beyond me.
---
I agree completely! Thank you for being 1 of the only 2 people in this thread to actually have a respectful debate with me instead of resorting to insults like most everyone else. I’m not quite 42 but I couldn’t agree more with your sentiment.
---
My carry weight is 595
---
(Cough) fifa (Cough)
---
UncleBeany2.  Come to my private server.   Lmao.
---
I've made the correction. Ty
---
The attention span is usually up til the weekend on these things.  Should be back to normal Saturday or so.
---
Unless they drop an inside the vault with more raw meat.
---
Windows reset is your friend.
---
I was referring to the backpack
---
Is not even about that dawg is about the scrapbox.
---
No press is bad press. These idots just got us 2 more years! Huzzah!
---
“For the low price of $5.99 we’ll provide you with that information. Looking forward to helping you!”- Bethesda.
---
Keeping track of how much *scrap* (not other stuff) you have was never a serious server limitation. It takes the same amount of bytes in the database to store the minimum value that can be in that field as the maximum value that can be in that field. There aren't that many different types of scrap, and most players will probably have some of most types of scrap at all times.
---
They could give the infinite scrap storage space to everyone at almost no cost to themselves. They could have given everyone hugely expanded (but not infinite) scrap storage at literally no cost at any time if they felt it was the correct game design decision. All it would take would be changing the weight of scrap to zero when it's in the stash. That's it. Then you could have up to the maximum allowed by the field per each type of scrap at zero cost.
---
Somewhat like a payed dev room.
---
Is this a true bait and switch?
---
Wonderful aim, great points...too bad you're shooting at the wrong target, Tex.
---
What started off as a few atoms you could probably get very easily ingame for a +10HP costume.  It was ok though, people bought them.  Soon became gradually harder and harder to get atoms, with more and more "flash sales" to get people buying, which then became repair kits and scrap kits... People questioning.  Is this P2W?? Naw it's not pay to win.  Lots of arguing.  People still paying and those atoms are getting harder and harder to come by, by the week.  Challenges getting more and more difficult to complete.  Then refrigerators, and the ridiculous bundles with no discount for already purchased items, along with nerfs to ingame atom gains, even completely removing the easy atoms you get at the start of a new character but disguising it as a means of 'helping new players', leaving only the grindy atoms behind.  Still, it's not P2W the apologists argued.  It's okay though because a week or so ago Bethesda said the needs of the atom store changed because the non-cosmetic items have proved popular.  Yeah.  No shit they proved popular.  Cause they're advantageous to have (no matter how small or insignificant you might think the advantage is).  So now they aren't promising anything with regards to their atom store.  And then a week after they make that statement.  Boom.  There you go.  It's okay that Private Servers are paid for (though the price is STEEP), but it's the features that come with it - scrap storage and a second camp/free fast travel point.  It's okay though.  These don't give any advantage.  It's not P2W!!1!  What's worse is that Private Servers has more features to come.  I wonder what awaits.  Which side of the fence will mods land on?  
---
I really love this game.  I play it all the time, since my full-price day 1 purchase, but I haven't spent a penny since and won't.  Great game, horrible business practises disguised as doing us a favour.

If only they understood this.
---
I had a Legendary Sheepsquatch along w/ 2 legendary scorchbeast!  And a legendary radrat!!  All this at Fissure Prime.
---
Welp, I uninstalled. Hopefully more people do the same.
---
Yep. Once they do their minor fixes especially the stash box and then I'll buy a yearly subscription. I never run out and buy any new product that just hits the market it's important to wait until they work out the bugs.
---
I wasnt offering
---
There’s nothing left.
---
I haven't playyes in months reinstalled 
---
Last night to try out private servers, and I love it. Game runs so much better now. And no server hoping.
---
Here you go from the patch notes:  **(NW) New Limited Time Rewards:** Unlock six limited-time Halloween themed cosmetic rewards by completing Nuclear Winter Challenges from October 29 – November 12.
---
Unfortunately the ignorant masses and their infinite stupidity/apathy ensure the corps will always hold all the power. The video game industry will never get better, it will only get worse.
---
For what it's worth, I didn't buy the refrigerator. I just didn't understand what was happening, and I'm sorry I was rude about it to some fellow Wastelanders.
---
Are you serious, stated where exactly? It wasn't on the local news channels.
---
This game doesn’t have enough content to justify the amount of monetization. You aren’t funding content updates, you are subsidizing their losses from poor sales and stupid decisions made during development. Your ignorance makes you easily manipulated, exactly the kind of mark daddy bethesda is looking to get to pay for their financial losses from a shitty release.
---
I can now display my tenderizer. I made a second character just to hold stuff I wanted but didn’t have room for. Earned a couple tenderizers and was all excited. 20 pounds each. Check mods. 34 pounds each. Look at stash and that’s a no-go. So now I have the space and can proudly put up my silky salty tenderizer complete with pouring salt.
---
This is how a scam works
---
People don't need unlimited scrap so what are you talking about?
---
They are out downvoting in every article. They tried it with me when I called them out for being idiots in their own threads pertaining to the pass. Honestly, I am enjoying seeing them post about losing their junk from the new container, etc. It's karma for buying this subscription. People keep telling me I should not tell them what to do with their money, but them buying this subscription makes those of who don't suffer because they will put more stuff behind a paywall. Even know I won't buy this, it still effects me as a player.
---
76 is a solid game without purchasing anything but the base game. It does have issues but it is by no means unplayable. It's just that it's not fallout 4 with friends. It's Fallout 76. And as the game evolves people get upset because no one likes change unless it directly benefits them. But that is just not possible to do for everyone. Many things have been patched, nerfed, balanced, buffed or changed to make the game better. Just check the patch logs.
---
You’re talking to morons bro. Don’t waste time on them
---
More people have bought the subscription due to people whining about it... same toxic people that many don’t even play the game...
---
Same toxic players who one shot legendaries screwing people over saying it’s part of the game... 
---
Well private servers are part of the game and they’re glorious! Love them! 
---
Best purchase in a game I’ve made! 
---
See all the positive wastelanders out in the wasteland!
---
What about it
---
Nice post, Todd howard
---
First they came with the horse armor and I did not speak... 😣
---
This but unironically.
---
I agree with your point, Skyrim together just isn't the best example. the Multiplayer fork of Open Morrowind is a way better example.
---
At this point I’d say you’re one of the people making death threats towards devs?
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uUfwFVu
---
Joke’s on you, I don’t even own the game.
---
Just here eating my popcorn enjoying the fire.
---
Since when was fallout free? As far as I know you need to pay $30+ and then need to buy Xbox live or PSN if your on console.
---
Some people who play ESO, as opposed to nearly everyone who has even glanced at Fallout 76. And I notice you didn't mention support.
---
It's like how they slowly trickled non-cosmetic items into the atom shop, which people obviously bought because those items provide an advantage to gameplay (no matter how small or non-existent some people claim) and then turn around and tell us "wow, we noticed the non-cosmetic items in the atom shop are really popular?! From now on, we'll be sure to tailor the atom shop accordingly to what you guys want!"  Making it sound like they're doing this for us, because that's what we were buying, and retcon their promise on no paid stuff all at the same time.
---
Play outer worlds
---
People can spend their money they earn anyway they want... people forget that.
---
You can play outer worlds with Microsoft game pass for pc. Starts at $1 and goes to $5 per month after. Comes with more games and you can always cancel if you get bored. That's what I'm doing.
---
Bathesda earned the hate all by themselves. Using the media and youtubers as a scape goat is quite frankly bullshit.
---
So it is a subscription service that doesnt include the content that was advertised or promised.
---
Thanks. Didn’t realize that and already got it on PS4. I have to get some use out of my PS4 while waiting on The Last of Us 2. ;)
---
I dunno, OP is not making a great case for his own intelligence here.
---
You're talking about the last changes with events.
---
Wild Appalachia and the content that came with that was very good and improved the game a fuck ton.
---
And if I had it my way legendaries would be fucking removed. They ruined the game.
---
We need to send bethesda a message before the next elder scrolls drops. They ruined my memory of fallout i dont want that to happen with elder scrolls i love it more then fallout and now im worried as shit itll be a deceptive exploited money maker.
---
They've really turned into a shit company...
---
You must be very popular on facebook.
---
Agreed, don’t listen to the sell outs
---
I sympathize with you, though I'm planning on still sticking around.
---
In some sense I feel pride, being there from the buggiest of starts and building up my character(s), getting a handle on the game before the majority of the population, and knowing that I can stand toe to toe with subscribers paying for easy mode. The game isn't that hard, you can find crafting components if you know where to look and "trolls" can be avoided.
---
My slight regret is paying full, since I could have just waited two weeks for that massive price drop.
---
No money but I also haven't played 76 in maybe a year sooooo....
---
Bethesda accidentally misplaces everyone's player data, and in their apology they blame the players for buying their game in the first place
---
Geez what happened to this sub. Is anything related to the actual game anymore? You guys don't even play this game and read some guy talking about sucking dick below.
---
This is so similar to my former fridge argument that I'm not sure if you're trolling me or not.
---
People aren't bothered about paying for private servers (although the price is a bit steep)... It's the extra stuff that comes with it.
---
This is legendary. Nothing like a little internet mayhem to shake things up. Congratulations Count Chappy.
---
Edit : site is still up, traffic is probably making it hard to reach. Is there a way to track page visits?
---
I haven't had this exact thing, but since the beginning, I've seen something like "loading level 1" when loading into a world.  I've definitely see that in the past week too.
---
Xbox game pass is cheaper than this shit and so is Xbox live gold, same with PlayStation. There is no way in the world you can defend Bethesda for this.
---
You know it's bad when even Ark has better servers/multiplayer. It's even got less bugs and better stability.
---
or they do know, but due to how you treat them, they may just be keeping quiet until they roll it out.
---
Tbh if you dont have the imagination to have fun in a game unless you're being pointed... You're going to find all game have no content.
---
I'm actually temped to put down some cash.this game is fo4 but with friends and i dont need quest markers and human skins on npc to have a fucking blast. Maybe it's you dude.
---
because the reaction started after the trailer released. So by the E3 presentation, they already knew.
---
It's uninstalled. Thx.
---
You really think this way, don't you? I knew, hypothetically, there had to be people like you out there, but damn, meeting one in the wild is a surreal experience.
---
I would but I'm still on windows 7 at the moment and they've locked it behind windows 10 lol Next PC build maybe lol
---
Haha I even read that in his voice
---
Or apply to another company.   They can opt for the security of not doing that, but when I criticize the devs and publishers as a whole, the tradeoff is they are a part of the collective entity I am criticizing.  My answer is, if you are part of a company that is getting valid criticism, you are contributing to the product being criticized.
---
I posted this exact same though and got hated for it. It's the only way they will learn
---
But did your junk disappear?
---
That's literally impossible. Bethesda isn't Rockstar games. They don't have 5+ years to make a game. They have dead lines to meet and money to make. A lot of companies from all lines of work do not use brand new products to make things. They take already created assets and refunction it to its new specifications. Sure its not perfect but it works. I work for Walmart a multi billion dollar company and they're in the process of cutting the fat off all the salaried managers to make more money for the investors. We can't even get new equipment for the departments that need it because it'd take away money from the company so we make do with what we have.
---
500 atoms? PFFF, perish such thoughts of generosity. The mere presence of Todd should be compensation enough.
---
[Accurate depiction of anyone who bought the pass.](https://www.epicpath.org/images/thumb/a/a0/Burning_skeleton.jpg/252px-Burning_skeleton.jpg)
---
How much "getting burned" is enough?
---
Exactly! If you play just for an hour a day it’s $0.30 cents a day... that’s a steal for all you’d get over a year, atoms, storage and more!
---
Just because you enjoy the game doesn’t mean you’re a fanboy. I have a very stressful job and a good way for me to decompress that stress on my off time is to sometimes just wander around Appalachia. People enjoy the game for many different reasons.
---
~~They also acknowledged that it's only a visual glitch, that no one has actually lost scrap.~~
---
Edit: As I made that comment, saw a new post about it still being an issue and not just a visual one so I will walk that back until further information is available.
---
Did this happen when switching from private back to public? Or just in private?
---
Press x for obvious
---
Please no.
---
At least I'm confident that road to evil takes time, to fall from CDPR's height should take a few games at least.
---
Actually they did change it a while ago. You used to be able to server hop to keep finding servers with an area unlooted. I used to do this at camp mclintock to farm ballistic fiber from the military ammo bags there. Then early this year they patched it and then no amount of server hopping would repopulate those items for you, you just had to wait and loot elsewhere.
---
Server hopping still works for respawning enemies, usually. It seems if you server hop and get back on the same server sometimes they don't all respawn (they used to but it seems like it changed a few months ago).
---
Forbes also went on a several month spree where they defended Aliens: Colonial Marines.
---
 How exactly? By making a joke saying I would buy it in the bargain bin 2 weeks after release? Do you not understand that is a dig on Bethesda? Apparently you missed my comment of day one purchases as well,or maybe you can't comprehend.
---
I paid $20 for the game and have gotten about 200 hours of enjoyment out of it. It’s been a great ROI.
---
Better yet, they do that but instead of apologizing they don't fix it and instead give 50 Atombucks to everyone BUT later find out that because of the data misplacement people cant access their accounts anymore (not that the 50 Atombucks would matter since nothing on the store would cost anything less than 200 during the season anyway)
---
Exactly the problem.  A benefit is a benefit and being able to buy a benefit is the definition of P2W.  Maybe to you those benefits are small and insignificant, but it is that dismissive attitude that allows these gaming companies to continuously shaft their loyal customers.
---
Aye I hope that's not the case. They did post that the instance would shut down when you left. If they're putting you into worlds already looted, not what they advertised.
---
You mean Obsidian buddy?
---
Hiding in the bomb shelters, can you blame them?
---
Yeah definitely almost all the stuff added is pay to win.
---
Almost day later reply. Lol 😂salty huh
---
Double the budget but once the membership ends you can't move it or add on to it.
---
I deserve that, for I am a refrigerator traitor.
---
And what a lovely set of balls they are. these private servers are really designed to keep you out, us in, and playing.
---
I still resent that they changed the start of the game; my friend that just got into it finished the tutorial, got to the Tower and then just asked me 'Okay, now what?'
---
I realized the Red Legion gave players a motivation; the new intro is like a D&amp;D campaign without an intro/starting quest.
---
Edit: Just to clarify though, I left D2 for a couple of years due to how it was, but I've put in hundreds of hours recently. I love *most* things they've changed!
---
I'm sure after they work out bugs and invest in opening more servers, this issue may be resolved soon.
---
They will just keep exploiting there die hard fans until well... who the fuck knows what it will take
---
[Fallout First](https://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
I’d also like to point out that there’s still a megaload of content even for non-subscribers, like me. FO76 does not even have enough content at the moment to rival ESO’s base game, let alone its own subscription service. 
---
Not to mention the fact that you also have to have playstation plus to play at all. It’s just..far too much financial expectation in order to play a game that’s still half baked. From that perspective, I’m happy this doesn’t grant exclusive access to content - though I’m sure they’ll add features like that in the future.
---
Hahaha no factual evidence? Ok you win chief 😂🖖🏾
---
I was even worse.  I LIKED the game.  I spent money on atoms whenever they had deals out that came with skins.  This Fallout was made for people like me who kept playing after the story.  I'd have kept coming back and spending a bit of money.  I just wouldn't have spent ALL the money, which made it not good enough for AAA publishers. 
---
 As long as other players could easily get what I was getting by playing the game, I was good with it. Probably better with it than I should have been, making me part of the problem and worthy of criticism.  Bethesda had enough good will remaining with me to get away with it.  Probably the only company, ironically, outside of Obsidian and NIS to have that.
---
Lol, there is no way in hell you're 28. I'd call you a basement neckbeard, but I honestly doubt you're old enough to grow a beard yet. Don't worry though, if you call enough people on the internet 'BETA!', you too will eventually embarrass your parents enough that they'll stop hoping you'll move out and instead will begin waiting for your suicide note along side your semen stained wifu pillow.
---
I had hope too. I feel like I should uninstall and make room for something else.
---
Let the salt flow through you😂😂😂🖖🏾
---
What is the “slippery slope” argument?
