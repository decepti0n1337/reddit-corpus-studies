Blades wasn't developed by the same developer.

---
[Stare silently.]
---
Yeah if you or someone else hangs around your camp it spawns random crap the issue is if the person leaves your camp the random crap continjes to attack your camp...so stupid
---
Look how worked up your getting about a suit kn a video game. The Burrows hasn't even been open for 12 hours and look at the e titled attitude you have already. Pathetic
---
Balls. I was hoping for a genuine 'raid'. Still going to give it a go.. But.. Yeah..
---
You are a sad human being.
---
I do believe it's a bug, I've been having the same problem and I'll have about 20-30 lbs remaining. As soon as I spawn in vault 76 it's fixed.
---
that could make sense
---
Cheers everyone, thanks for the help.
---
i wish it was whitesprings 2.0
---
Yes. Agree with this guy. If you have melee you need shotgun and enforcer as a backup for ranged and especially Scorchbeasts.
---
I think glassed caverns is more in line with Skyrim dungeons. Fallout's dungeons previous to 76 were more like how we saw vaults. They were much more thorough and had some depth. I think as a fan base we've made enough excuses for this release and we should swing the other way and call Bethesda out for low effort content.
---
wow, if someone doesn't even punctuate his post even once, he must be really angry!
---
So.you are angry that you built up a ton of expectations like a suit that lets you "breathe under water" , and then the suit hasn't been dropped in 12 hours?
---
Are you a literal 12 year old?
---
Party!
---
I did it completely alone, seemed like everything was fresh and I encountered maybe 10 ghouls and 7 general gutsy plus the final assaultron boss. I like the area, they definitely did a good job on the design, if they just pumped it up with much more and/or higher difficulty enemies it wouldn't be bad at all. As it is now I have zero reason to do it again, I got a couple shitty 1 star legendary pieces and none of the mobs were starred.  Really missing the whole "plenty of loot and experience" part of the place, wasn't even a lot of junk.
---
The Bethesda apologists are really pulling out all the stops on their mental gymnastics extravaganza to somehow explain how Bethesda kept their promise on this being the difficult dungeon that they advertised while it's clearly a walk in the park even if you're very suboptimally geared.
---
I don't blame you. Although all the content they added have been nice additions they weren't anything to write home about. But the questline they are adding was the main piece of content for this phase, so hopefully the content will reflect that.
---
Oops, I bought two things before realizing there was a bundle. Oh well. Saves 400 caps I guess.
---

---
Someone post pic of the Roadtripper on males. :P
---
\&gt;!Its a mistake!&lt;
---
I can't wait till Bethesda gives up and modders fix this game
---
RIGHT??? I've defended bethedsa from the beginning but this one was just a shit show
---
re colour of the rabbit plush?
---
Any chance you remember where this was? I‚Äôd love to try for one myself!
---
Pretty on point
---
No, most of the quests are just us taking orders from someone that died decades ago for no real reason while also having ESP that allows us to magically know exactly what we are looking for. The quests then end in a decently read audio log or a computer terminal that talks about the final moments of a character I don‚Äôt know well enough to care about.
---
It is easier than west tek.
---
Different workshops have slightly different loot pools, but they're all camp items.
---
Very rare spawn
---
waiting for Paladin Toaster. &gt;:(
---
I get we're all disappointed but that's gonna be a big fat disagree from me.
---
To be honest, the LARGE MAJORITY of people online with ideas for games or things within games are waaaaaay too overly ambitious. 
---
It irks me seeing people on gaming subreddits be like "and they should have ALL trains on the map moving in real time where players can RIDE them. Also there would be an event where vertibots would attack the train and players would be on the roof defending it as it moved and the vertibot crashes into the train and it derails and then a huge boss the size of the world appears. Then the players are split into factions with 2000 players on the same server and they all have to fight it out yada yada yada" and everyone's like "WOW, YOU SHOULD WORK FOR THEM".
---
Like yeah, your idea is cool. But it's nowhere near feasible.
---
West Tek is harder for me. I'm still casually working on my build though.
---
I'm on PS4. I mod armor when I can, I usually just go for the physical damage reduction. I have a few perks for heavy guns. I like to use the mini gun when I have the ammo.
---
They falsely advertised the content and its quality.  Just facts. 
---
But hey it's free, so we can't ask for the content they said they'd give us and didn't.
---
By the way, there's new stuff in the Atom shop. Interestingly, more than we got for free. Hmmm.
---
Yea I decided to do some Sheepsquatch hunting today. So I started with the bulletin board in the taxidermy specifically the picture with the word "where?" under it. I determined that it has to be around the southern part of the savage divide where the cliffs and pine trees are. I spent about 2 hours searching the area and i found a brahmin with the mysterious quills stinking out of it.  no Sheepsquatch and the brahmin might just be random all over the map. Just keep your eyes open for dead brahmin I'd like to know if it spawns elsewhere.
---
I can only make the orange BoS armor but if its black you want I can craft marine wetsuits
---
go solo. It's already underwhelming as is
---
-facepalm-
---
I really want to collect all 6 eggs from the atom shop but theres no content for me to play, and I dont want to log on just to claim them and jump off every day haha
---
They seem to have fixed the vendor inspection issue. I can inspect legendary items at vendors again.
---
I mean. Camps kinda serve that purpose man
---
Everything you're saying about instanced dungeons having a set definition or as you put it "...considered globally in this market as a catered piece of content..." applies to MMO's with game servers existing in a persistent state. 
---
Games like WoW and Final Fantasy have individual servers that your characters are tied to. Those servers are persistent. If a guild or faction takes something over or does something to change the game state it stays that way, it doesn't typically reset; that's why they have instances, it's a way to separate the persistent world from key aspects of the story line. WoW goes one step further and instances the persistent world until you've completed the content to join the current end game state or give you bases that co-exist in the same space as all other players.
---
Fallout 76 does not have the persistent world mechanic, it's a "Ground Hog Day" MMO. The moment you disconnect almost everything you've done is gone from the world. Quests such as powering the plants reset daily as servers slowly stop accepting new players and reset. Saying dungeons need to be an instance to be called dungeons is based off of definitions for completely different MMO styles.
---
What you're describing is how Star Trek: Online handles things, which is a "Theme Park" MMO. You hop in a line, go on a ride, then go back to a regular (and usually random) worldspace with your friends. But there are tons of dungeon type locations in that game that are not instanced. It allows the open world to be more open world. There are over 100 quests that take place in interior dungeon cells that are persistent with the server rather than instanced; much like The Burrows.
---
tl;dr: Your definition of "dungeon" is based off of what a few, large, mainstream MMO's do for their worldspace style. It's not the standard. Unless explicitly stated as "Instanced Dungeon" it should not be assumed. Not all dungeons are instances, not all instances are dungeons.
---
That's what I said about beds!
---
Someone on PS4 yesterday said he lost everything, just looking out.
---
I found a picture of the marine wetsuit. Does it always have the part over your face? And how much would one of them sell for?
---
Was super disappointed in the whole thing and, of course, because Bethesda hasn't figured out instances, half the mobs were already dead and the rooms were picked clean. All around a low quality experience.
---
Wow thanks asshole, üëç you‚Äôre SO helpful. Almost like I tried that hours ago. Since I don‚Äôt find anything why would I do it again a little bit later. Could have just not said anything
---
I didnt complain? I stated a fact
---
No, the part over the face is a separate helmet in 76. I‚Äôm not really sure how much they sell for but I can craft them and they‚Äôre not THAT expensive to make so if you want one I‚Äôd be happy to just give it to you no charge
---
Sounds like a Fortnite player üôÑ
---
I'm surprised he didn't make a quest idea called "Sweating Bullets".
---
THANKS. asshole, SOO much HELP üëçüëçüëçü•áü•á whoo, it‚Äôs almost like I asked on here because i wanted a definite answerüéâüéâ
---
Can someone please sell me a XO jet pack mod ... I‚Äôve been seever hopping for 3 days about 4/6 hours at a time cannot make one spawn for the life of me help a girl out !!!!
---
Ok thanks! Can you get on tomorrow at 5:00 (ET)?
---
Why is it not instanced? How can they even call this a dungeon? Hell, How can they even be proud to release this even? Still waiting for content Bethesda.
---
There is a black under armor. It‚Äôs the BOS officer uniform I believe.  The orange is the soldier uniform. I believe I can craft the officer uniform and put shielded lining in that. The marine wetsuit is also black. Goes well with the marine tactical helmet.  I can craft those as well. But can only put up to second tier lining on it.  Let me know if your interested. I‚Äôm at work atm. Won‚Äôt be online til 8 hours.  PS4.
---
Sweet!  Works as advertised!
---
Armchair devs on reddit telling actual developers that they don't know what they're doing lol.
---
They are implementing instancing. But they never said they'd have instancing on the burrows. They literally said they're building the instancing now for the vault raids. 
---
Consider the fact that they took an engine designed and build strictly for single player games and re-wrote it to work with multiple players. Now they have to also implement instancing on that engine.
---
I agree with the other person that said you need to focus on crafting, and gathering ammo for the gun you like. I like heavy guns, like the mini gun, if that's the case I would really suggest getting stabilized in the intelligence tree and one man army in luck tree. And craft that ammo. I, like you, prefer to use melee but keep a Gatling Gun ( cause of lower ammo consumption) to damage and land those scorchbeasts
---
You say that a lot. What exactly do you mean? I haven't played Fortnite in my life. Do you just think the game is dumb, and anyone who calls you out is also dumb? Therefore anyone who disagrees with you plays Fortnite?
---
 I've  been copy/pasting this whenever I see someone make a post about cross character storage. I just like the idea and keep wanting to share it.
---
I'd like to see a main menu option for transferring items. A sort of cross-character stash. By doing it from the main menu it would also keep the extra items from needing to be loaded on the game servers, which seems to be an issue the game has and way stash limits we low at the  start. A way it could work is:
---
* Main Menu item for I.T.E.M.S Box (Inventory Transfer and Enhanced Management System)
---
* I.T.E.M.S opens up a menu with all items in it on the right and your currently selected character's S.T.A.S.H. on the left.
---
* From  here you can move inventory between STASH and ITEMS. Since it's not on a  game server, there's no worry about large quantities of items hurting  much.
---
* The  I.T.E.M.S. box would be tied to the player (not character) allowing all  your of your characters to share the same I.T.E.M.S. box inventory.
---
* There  would be no reason to limit what you could put here other than to try  and keep the illusion of scarcity in a post apocalyptic world so  hoarders could rejoice.
---
You do know that the suit is literally copypasted from fallout 4 dlc, and it has the breathe underwater effect? 
---
And why would the suit drop later? There isn‚Äôt any implication that a patch with new content regarding the burrows would be dropping?
---
Yeah most likely, just send me your username and I‚Äôll add you wheb I get home from work
---
I know i was confused,and scared,and the colors...argh the stress. But now i got it all settled. I put my own live deathclaw to guard the egg,should be fine.
---
It‚Äôs called your camp
---
I saw them for sale at whitespring yesterday. All three pieces for 333 caps a piece.
---
I found one 3-star and two 1-star legendaries (all were ghouls). It is doable solo.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad idea honestly. Even tho I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion over saying it
---
I got 2 3* but I did it solo.  Its pretty cake
---
TYFYS Grammar cop
---
I paid for a game and was dissapointed they marketed material they didnt make available, oh i can taste the entitlement
---
My username is TruJoe_
---
My camp is between Solomon's Pond and Twin Lakes, east of Whitespring. It's been good for a while but you make a good point. Thanks!
---
The point is you saw a picture and made your own deductions. They didn't promise shit. They just posted a screenshot and you got a little tiny diver suit boner. 
---
They dont owe you anything. The suit will probably land on game somehow in the near future. Try to be patient and not get so worked up over video games.
---
Ok. Also you meant 5 PM, right
---
I feel like people forget the dungeons in Fallout 4 were the same thing. When they said a new DUNGEON was coming, they meant a new dungeon based around what they'd done before. 
---
It's possible that the original idea was fallout 4 multiplayer with a bigger map. But now the community clearly wants an MMO so they're slowly trying to turn it into one.
---
Junk weight and life-saving are good traits, but it‚Äôs not a god roll or anything. With something like this I think the value just comes down to finding a buyer. Whatever someone is willing to pay for it, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs worth. So ask for offers!
---
I love how one screen shot with a suit in it is 'marketing' the suit to you.
---
I expect a camera of some sort.
---
Thanks so much! I think I have a Gatling gun in my stash. I've got some rearranging of my skills to do too.
---
So, you were 3 times the recommended level, had the best weapons and gear in the game, actually did the mission, and then complained the content is too easy.   
---
Yeah OK.
---
Give a week or so and it won‚Äôt be crowded
---
[Remind me of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZXf9-_mS9A)
---
I recently was at whitesprings bc one of my friends ended up abandoning me because he was "too high a level for someone as low as me". I was pretty darn bummed until this guy that was like 150 something comes along. I invite them to my team and they surprisingly accept. we ran round whitesprings for a bit, and then they took me to a crap ton of high level areas and gave me an awesome gun with ammo and literally helped me get from level 13 to 18 in one night. One of the best experiences I've had. We haven't really played since but if you're reading this and you know who you are, thank you dude.
---
Who cares how detailed it is...if u only down there for 15mins.
---
If they wanted us to enjoy their art then they should give us something to do.
---
Thank you :)
---
ARK's engine was probably designed with server item handling in mind at a very early stage. Fallout 76's wasn't. It stands to reason they'd run into issues with high amounts of items and the only way to really test that is to let thousands of people onto the server and keep upping the weight limits and fixing things until it works.
---
The other thing I'd say about comparing ARK to Fallout is that ARK's lore doesn't require it to keep an illusion of scarcity in it's game environment. Fallout is post-apocalyptic and allowing a huge build up of wealth really takes away from the game world.
---
you aren't gonna believe what the brotherhood fell to
---
Do you work at bgs or why are you getting so angry over me being disapointed they made it look like we were about to get cool armor but didnt?
---
And the ‚Äùthey dont owe you anything‚Äù part is the exact reason why companies abuse consumers, you are literally defending bad business practises.
---
I could go solo @lvl120 easily. Got a few 3\* when i was down there. Found myself running around trying to find side quests because it was so short, but the main seems like it.
---
No because you arnt "disagreeing" with me..."that level of cringe is mind boggling"...thats straight up shit talking
---
This is a public forum, id you dont like seeing multiple posts ABOUT THE NEWEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE GAME THIS THREAD IS ABOUT! Then stop checking reddit every 15 minutes and go outside.
---
I have every right to my own opinion as do you, just as I have every right to post here.  If something I was doing was unsavory or not allowed the Mods would check me.
---
So please get off my posts and stop being such a negitive, condescending, unwanted asshole

Yo I have NEVER seen a 3 star legendary. Not sure if I ever even saw a legendary one at all

What's the Old Tunnel key for?
---
I wear power armor solely because I can't accidently sit down in it while looting.
---
Thats terrifying
---
Not everyone is even capable of using them. Speech impairments and even sleeping kids. It'd be great if they made text chat easier, or at the very least gave us more useful emotes.
---
Ooh yeah, you put that foot down. Tell 'em hoss. We won't let it slide. We're gonna hold Bethesda accountable for the.......free.......content....................wait a minute...
---
Jesus, you weren't kidding. That took less than ten minutes start to finish.
---
Lesson learned from this: dont really expect anything from bgs anymore.
---
The wendigo being a former human was established during the main campaign in the rose quest line where you hunt down a former raider who turned wendigo
---
I wondered that too as I found it and no where yo use it. My friend thinks it's for that jail cell door that you open to get to the pump rooms to do the quest. When we went down there the door was already open
---
Yes. Tomorrow
---
Yellow outlines usually means they were destroyed at some point, although I can't imagine someone destroying only your plants. Unless there's a cat.
---
This morning I found quills in a dead brahmin outside the water park in the Toxic Valley. Never saw those before so I held onto them. Seemed important.
---
Non-existant. Last Bastion is the only legendary piece of scout armor.
---
When it happens i just reload and it seems to fix it
---
Most of the ghouls disappeared almost immediately upon death, so I didn't get the chance to loot them.
---
The oldest comments are demonstrably not ones asking for clarification, and its absurd to even claim such. The two oldest comments are these (they were 17 hours old while her replies were 14 hours at the time I replied to you citing that these were the oldest comments, and well before your request for elaboration that is under one of her replies to one of these comments):
---
"They are different, but making Team Mates blue or another bright colour would be easier."
---
"They are gold compared to the washed out yellow"
---
Her replies to both of those (that you claim were aggressive and merely yelling the same repeated/regurgitated nonsense):
---
"They are not different. They are all the exact same shade of yellow."
---
"You are wrong. Everyone's map markers are the exact same colour."
---
Those are not aggressive, condescending, nor any more derogatory than the replies to her.  Those replies also don't give sufficient information for you to insist that she should have known there was a miscommunication.  
---
You replied to the first one of those with this:
---
"Do you mean Friends? People in your group are a different shade of yellow (that‚Äôs its own design problem) but to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúexact‚Äù is factually incorrect.
---
Edit:
---
Look dude, I'm trying to find out what on earth you're talking about. If you're going to complain, how about communicating via some other mechanism than down-voting and telling everyone they're wrong."
---
Like it or not the part before the edit not only can easily be seen as condescending, and even when asking for explanation you opted to phrase it with the assumption that she meant friends despite her literally having indicated the markers are the same shade (which comes across to her or anyone else you say that to as you feeling its more likely they are just wrong about something so obvious instead of you not understanding what they are referring to).  Please understand, I am not assuming that your intentions have ever been anything but helpful (I honestly wouldn't bother with any of this if I felt that wasn't the case), but regardless of your intent the wording and circumstances of your comments may not accomplish what you desire.  You even went so far on your assumption that you definitely knew what she meant that you made the leap to asking if she was color blind (like it or not, that is an insulting leap to make especially when you didn't really even pad it that well first).  Even if she had been insulting, that wouldn't make these comments any better at sorting things out (and I suspect you were already feeling defensive, just as she clearly was already too).
---
I have never claimed I have omniscience of any sort.  Your claims to know how impartial I am and what other people intended (myself, the op) would put you in the position of being the only one claiming any form of omscience (though some of your expectations for how the op should have handled things do seem to insist she should have it too).  I am not just blindly assuming the op was a victim, nor am I trying to villify and attack you.  My viewpoint is on understanding she felt dismissed and ganged up on by the time anyone realized that there was a miscommunication at all.  You keep insisting she was aggressive, but she literally replied in the same manner she was commented on.  You refuse to see frustration and defensiveness in favor of saying she was condescending, aggressive, and accusing/assuming she directly caused your downvoting.  Honestly, you are your own worst enemy here.  If I weren't actually aware of all the comments and had read them hours before I even first replied, your presentation of the facts makes it sound like she replied far more than just 5 times total (only 4 of which are actually even really relevant, and of those you truly only focus on 3).  You even presented it as if she had replied to you more than once (which she didn't) and normally there is an indicator of a deleted comment (there are none).  Perhaps there are some comments I am not able to see due to that (I have read the downvoted comments, as they are still present just not auto expanded).
---
Perhaps instead of focusing on insisting on justifying your comments, you should consider that any reasonable person claiming they only want to help undermines that goal when they insult the person they claim they are trying to help.  If I didn't believe that your intentions weren't to help, I wouldn't bother commenting and replying.  You aren't being fair to yourself or the op in how you present things.  If you want to consider her aggressive in her first replies, then you have to also aknowledge that those first comments felt the same way to her.
---
A side note, your point that the op should have understood that everything on the map is a marker and she should have known to explain more ignores that the game actually uses the literal term map marker for what she referenced (and not pin as you described it).  While I do understand where people could be confused, you seem to feel that her not realizing that places the blame significantly on her before comments were even made (hence your position that she should have known to clarify the moment anyone said they are etc, without accepting that she would have been just as clueless that people were assuming something other than what she meant).  Not everyone struggled to understand what she meant, and I'm sure she would have better explained initially had she ralized that people would be confused.  When you moved to considering color blindness, I am guessing that was you trying your hardest to find some reason for the different views and it simply didn't occur to you that you hadn't understood what she meant correctly.  So why do you assume she was any different?  Why would she know that those first people were referring to player indicators, and not just telling her she was wrong about something she actually wasn't?  You want to blame her for stonewalling when she had no awareness that there was any need to explain yet (and assuming that her not responding is stonewalling is equally ridiculous, people have lives beyond replying...so that eventual reply she gave explaining was likely the first chance she had been able to reply since, so holding it against her that she didn't clarify earlier is just odd).
---
A lot of ghouls. Rate of legendaries is same. I'd say hf is better to nuke now than ws
---
Very valid points. Why not a "no mic" emote at least?
---
Ahh didn't know that. But now that begs the question: why don't we find wendigos at the Gourmand raider camps (unless we do and I don't remember because I only went for Rose's quest in November)? One of the notes suggests it's a Gourmand that joins them in the church anyway ("gang of chefs" that turns out to be cannibals).
---
My point is, it's one screen shot. You dont need to take that screen shot as a 'promise'.
---
For all we know something happened in development and the suit had to be delayed. Maybe it's being incorporated into some future co tent now. That screen shot could have been from a test run a month ago. We have no idea. It's you as a consumer that took every screenshot and everything within it as  a 'promise.'
---
Given that in your above examples, they are different groups of people.  It makes sense.  It is called eroding your base.  Or bad decision after bad decision.  After TSE/whitknight nerf, the ingame activity took a nose dive, the frequency of nuking has never gotten to the same level at least on xbox one pre nerf.  (And new players have been coming since then.  Likely at a much lower rate then replacing those that stopped playing)  It is going to be a revolving door of complaints with this game, new players come, bethesda continues to make decisions that annoy people, and the complaints will continue.  It's not like they had plenty of examples out there to model this after and do a better job.  They are probably spending more time figure out what they can next nerf or degrade quicker to help monetize the game.
---
I thought it was easy too but I mean come the fuck on, seriously? A TSE shotgun, which is the holy grail of TSE, at Level 150, of course you were gonna wipe the floor with those ghouls.
---
You: "Last time I used TES Construction Set was Morrowind in 2002, and I was able to make amazing dungeons and towns for my family and friends complete with scripted encounters. "  
---
Also you: "I played little league 17 years ago. Therefore, I could play for the Yankees now, right? What, it was so easy when I did it 17 years ago!"
---
I just picked the lock on the safe in the office where the stash is located. SURPRISE! I am not wanted for 10 caps. I went to White Springs, and Watoga hoping someone would shoot me. I think they think its a trap since I am level 210.
---
I mean thats just real life stuff ingame they are a form of ghoul but it helps put to and two together and explains why theres so many corpses in wendigo cave
---
Yo can you send me your psn
---
I only had time to do it once and I was pretty unsatisfied. Finished the quest killed a bunch of ghouls, lots of gutsys and 2 assaultrons, NO legendary enemies! Figured I just had a bad server tho. But definitely think I could do it solo on my main lvl 161 w/tse handmade.
---
Armchair developers are the worst.
---
Telephones I think.
---
Or a quicker animation for yes/no. The "no" also looks super pissed off, even when I'm trying to gracefully tell someone I don't need the free plans/ammo/whatever they're offering me.
---
Oh, sure, that's probably it.
---
Right lol its well past 5 for me
---
Yes we should
---
So much for going out an enjoying the holidays
---
We go camping every year on the long weekend so heres to missing out!
---
It quite clear Bethesda calls those "Raids" and Dungeons are just underground areas
---
Shoot them
---
Yeah I've forgotten too much from Rose's drawn out questline lol, my bad. And yeah I get that part about Larry's quest, but what are the quills from? Not a sheepsquatch. Unless they have something to do with the snallygasters at Larry's, but they don't make sheep noises.
---
üëéüèª
---
Yes, rugs still work.  I have a couple dozen plants and a fertilizer resource on my roof. I had a purifier up there, but I haven't bothered to run power up there so for now it's back on the ground.
---
I had just used all my stimpacks on the Sheepsquash event, haha. It was terrible timing.
---
I expect it to somehow bug out and break some completely different mechanic for a while, and the challenges to be increasingly bizarre. "Take 25 pictures of unique SBQs, landing" for 10 atoms as a daily.
---
Pretty easy, didn't get a single legendary It can be a little confusing, I ended up going in a circle at least once.
---
I really wish we could have maps for interiors and underground areas.
---
&gt;I appreciate you giving them the benefit of the doubt, but snapping together the pieces of the dungeon, populating with objects and containers, and writing in scripts and triggers for Burrows could not have possibly taken BGS 3 weeks to work on.

Please regale us with your vast history of professional experience with level design since &lt;checks notes&gt; some shit you made for your mom back in 2002.

It's like his "weekend programmer" remark went WHOOSH right over your head.

This. With dense + fireproof you can bathe in the sonic blasts while you wait for the thing to land. PA + fireproof isn't bad either.

You realize some people don't sit at home the entire holiday? I will be out of the house the entire weekend, celebrating the holiday on an easter trip. - No coming back and logging in for 5 seconds isn't an option, we are going 4 hours away without internet.

Kudos!
---
What do I do when the wave of sewage comes?
---
I literally just finished it.
---
Yes and its my right as a consumer that paid for the product to voice my concerns over marketing stuff that doesn't exist.
---
*uses TSE for everything* "This game isn't challenging enough!!"

üòÇüòÇ
---
Small children should not meddle in the business of adults.
---
Yes it was easy but i also loved it. It's a gold mine of everything.
---
What level are you if you don't mind sharing? I ask because my experience in the Burrows spawned 3 two stars, and 2 three stars with decent  drops - I'm level 206 and that was un-nuked.
---
Boo hoo. Too bad then. You miss the content. It's almost like choices have consequences!
---
I don't see you're reply as whiny and I agree with a lot you are saying, but i just gotta say:
---
I'm not gonna get up all in your shit, but if you are still living in a post nerf TSE shotgun world, then I will offer this:
---
1. Did you buy or find you're TSE shotgun?
---
2. Where did Behesda ever say this was an "instanced" dungeon?
---
3. Why would you ever, ever compare this game to EVE or WOW?  Are you mental?
---
4. Why would you need a Mirelurk Queen in the middle of this quest? They aren't difficult either. I took my first one down at level 25, with no special gear in particular. High level Yao Guai's or Mirelurk kings or even Crickets are much more worthy as bosses.
---
5. Lastly, you want Fallout 76 to be WOW.  Get over it, it won't ever be
---
I love seeing other places besides Whitespring nuked. Someone nuked the Nuka Cola factory which was a good time. I really wanna have Charleston get nuked.
---
No idea, there called mysterious quills and maybe are implied to be from some unknown cryptid. There are in the back of one of the teens and the neck of a dead Brahmin in next to Larry‚Äôs.
---
439. Got some 2-3 stars too
---
Tools now are better than tools then, so I‚Äôm having a hard time finding the point of this response.
---
It's like back in november. Everything was open,looted or used.
---
One quest to find a holotape, the holotape hints that this will be a story based quest, but then that's literally it and the story seems to have been completely abandoned after they recorded the holotape and just added it for shits and giggles. The last step ends abruptly and you have to go on reddit to make sure you didn't miss something.
---
OP needs to change name to Imyoorhuckleberry
---
Tools now are more complex than tools then, and FO76 is a significantly more complicated game than Morrowind, so it appears that you're having a hard time with a lot of things.
---
Wouldn't the spiked baseball bat be the rat stick?
---
When you popped back out of the Burrows, did outer HF respawn?
---
What if they let us create our own section in vault 76? Everyone can have a living area that you build using the fallout 4 vault items
---
I did take my time, I really tried to stretch it out, took less than 20 minutes. I was alone the entire time, my non legendary handmade killed everything with ease. This isn't what they said it was going to be.
---
I don't think u can place them yet, maybe if u collect all 6 or 8 or watever u can do something
---
There was a lot of people and everyone spawns new mobs on them, so i can't tell
---
The Borrows wasn't never mentioned to be instanced
---
the first one you get by entering the burrow, (i entered from south burrow near armor)
---
i heard there is a 2nd added but cant find anything on it
---
I agree and if they did implement something close it would certainly extend game play time
---
Damn. Def read all about new modes in future. Time to start getting tick blood (use butcher's bounty to get more blood) for crafting. And search Morgantown airport for chem boxes n medical bags and use Pharma Farma for chance at more chems :)
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand. TES 2002 was clunky as hell. Tools have only improved. If I could make a dungeon of this quality by myself with the tools that were provided, and judging by what I see the modding community pump out these days - there is no reason to think that this was anything but a one man job handled over the weekend.
---
Downvotes are probably the console folks that can't use this.
---
Thanks for the mod!
---
To be fair I had this problem in FO4. I tend to only explore when there's a reason (like a quest or valuable loot) to go somewhere though. The Forest and responders questline was actually my favorite part, but there's not really much reason to go and explore late-game. The sheepsquatch line did give us some more desperately needed content in the Ash Heap, but Toxic Valley is still up there suffering, begging for the space station to have a purpose. We'll get more in the TV with the pioneer scouts though.
---
I think one of the biggest disappointments for me with the Burrows was simply the fact that no new weapons with their own custom animations and effects were added to the game. All i got was a lackluster Assaultron Blade with a combination of two different legendary effects that I never really cared for. This was arguably one of my biggest gripes with 76 aside from the standard bugs and general lack of engaging content in the game.
---
If anyone at Bethesda is reading this, I would really enjoy it if 76 got newer, more unique or fresh weapons added to the mix. One of the greatest parts of Fallout: New Vegas for me was the Gun Runner's and Lonesome Road Update and how it added in all these weapons that were either new and unheard of or so old nobody remembered them. Not only that, the first mods I downloaded in Fallout 4 were always custom made weapon mods such as the [RU-556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUGrqQjcBY). I really think Bethesda should just look at some of those weapon mods on the Nexus for inspiration on what to add to the game next. It's definitely worked before, considering how in Fallout 3 the Nexus community's modular weapons was the inspiration behind Fallout: New Vegas's modding system and later that of both 4 and 76.
---
On another note, what if Bethesda partnered with a gun manufacturer to design a new weapon to use in-game? It would be similar to what the Forza franchise does with cars, if i recall correctly. Bethesda could probably put it in the Atom Shop, too. Odds are if people are impressed by the result, it could be a source of monetization. I do admit everything I just brought up are incomplete ideas that's probably suited to it's own discussion, though.
---
reach for the stars
---
Was a dungeon ever advertised for the 16th?
---
Might be better off going alone, there will be even less to do there if you bring someone with you.
---
I've never had this happen to me or a friend so I call bullshit (mostly because no one is capable of being that cancerous in adventure 76)
---
Ok, what do you propose?
---
I‚Äôve managed to place them down. Just keep trying, probably a bug
---
It's weird because they made a specific view that doesn't have the player character bring up the pip boy and didn't use it to implement using it while the character is sitting, sleeping, playing instruments, etc
---
I kid you not, it just happened to me.
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
Confirmed on PC, I was able to place one just now.
---
What quests are you talking about?
---
It‚Äôs gonna be SO good for making Mothman Cult shrines
---
It is over in 5 minutes if you have already looked around tho. The replay value is very lacking. 
---
Too easy to consider it a challenge and no mechanics to make it interesting
---
I like new content but after running it a few times i have no desire to do it again
---
Which tab is it in though?
---
I'm on xbox.  Dmbabs308.  I just started up again recently and am lvl 15.  I only play 20-30 min a night, but if you wanna team up sometime let me know
---
Well not really. It's just that when a Bethesda game releases a dungeon..maybe expect a Bethesda dungeon.
---
Snake permanently and you‚Äôll be invisible from the map. Then nobody will come to kill you.
---
I kind of feel that way with most of the content. I'm not expecting to put FO:4 type hours into stuff but it would be nice if new content wasn't just something you could knock out over lunch.
---
Oml that is unfortunate but amazing üòÇ
---
Just Server jump and try again. It doesn‚Äôt happen that often, but if you really need fusion cores, other players sell them really cheap
---
Np üòâ
---
So basically NPCs. Ok.
---
I was under the impression it was extremely difficult. But yeah ima just go solo thanks for the advice man
---
Cigar boxes
---
TBH, they will add an item, case a few disassociated items to stop working, the fan boys will still be here, and people will still play.
---
I have no expectations except that the servers will be here in some form and the atom shop will have things in it.
---
Is the game playable =yes
---
How long will people stay = unknown
---
Also an "i dropped my PipBoy in the shitter" skin for said PipBoy in the atom store
---
Yes
---
The foundation glitch was fixed. You moved it. It‚Äôs done.
---
This may just be me speculating, but if you check out the datamined sheepsquatch skin, it looks like the quills came from it.
---

White springs resort and the bunker. Plenty of Telephones scattered around everywhere. Just keep server hopping for more
---
Floor decor, in the same row as the Deathclaw rug.
---
Jesus christ dude.
---
At least you're not the asswipe level 300. (And you can always server hop and more than likely be fine, this community is nothing close to GTA.)
---
All I understood was..
---
This is why in this thread I continuously refer to nexus mods as an example of more up to date productions from solo players.
---
Interesting. I wonder if there is a master list of what can be obtained where. I was hoping if I kept after the same workshop I could get all the plans, but it sounds like I might need to rotate.
---
That would be cool, especially since we're supposed to be the 'NPCs'. With that, you could even create your own little quest lines and meet people at the end of them, like good job, here's your reward.
---
Those look almost identical to the mysterious quills, I think that your right in the origin of the quills.
---
I can‚Äôt check right now but I‚Äôd have to guess floor decor. Just toggle to only show plans that you have and that should make it easier
---
Ah there it is. Thank you!
---
Also curious lvl 90
---
Can I do wild card Charlie Kelly with the cowboy hat from the dead guy in Whitesprings?
---
Sigh. I understand just fine. The toolset has improved. Now open your tiny little ears and listen.  
---
Morrowind was a very different game than FO76. It was much smaller in size, scope, tech lift, and oh yeah.... NOT MULTIPLAYER.  Designing content for a multiplayer game is MASSIVELY more complex than designing for a single player game.  I realize that might be a difficult concept for you to grasp if you haven't touched any development tools in nearly two decades, but it's pretty basic common sense for the rest of us.   
---
The statement "judging by what I see the modding community pump out these days" is so mindnumbingly ignorant I don't even know where to begin. Again, you wholly miss the point that we're not talking about a single player game -- so no, the community isn't pumping out shit for THIS game. Second, you have absolutely no idea how long those mods take, nor do you have any idea how long THIS took to develop. You literally just pulled numbers out of your ass, based on ......&lt;sorry I need to stop laughing for a moment&gt;...... based on your shitty personal mods you made for family in 2002.   
---
So let's recap: you have no idea how long this dungeon took to make, you have no idea how long any other dungeon takes to make, you have literally nothing to compare it to on FO76, your comparisons to other games are completely invalid to this discussion, and your only experience with the toolset is almost two decades old.   
---
But hey, I'm sure since it's so easy, you could publish a better one, right? Better get cracking -- I'll check in on Friday, that should be enough time, right?  By your own logic?   
---
We'll wait.
---
It‚Äôs not on the roadmap.
---
Actually, just switch all the music to Lady Gaga.
---
Yea that was a very special episode when the gang got him the new one.
---
This sub reminds me of the Bob Ross stream where everybody would say ruined and saved whenever it got better.
---
Stop dropping it.
---
Read the controls closely. You want to place not drop.
---
I'm personally tired of defending their "not so bad" content. This isn't the first content they added. It's *six months* after release. And while yes we've gotten some content, we all were expecting something better as time went on. The burrows was what we were looking forward to. Finally some content that's not a throwaway questline, a little daily fetch quest, and not a server-hop event. We were waiting for a dungeon, some PvE co-op content to enjoy with others or challenge ourselves to solo. 
---
We didn't get anything close to that.
---
I'm done defending mediocrity until they do something worth praise. I'm sadly losing hope that it will happen.
---
Yeah but I heard there where two other quests some where else that where added as well.
---
Not so fast.  https://youtu.be/jq65FVjZsWg
---
Theres a 3 hour cooldown for the event, plus you need to craft another recall card to summon the robot.
---
A bloodied explosive laser rifle sounds good for you
---
So you forget the part that e everyone is dead because it is only 25 years after the great war now 100+
---
It‚Äôs not done. Physical evidence of the sheepsquatch has just appeared today üòâ
---
Depends on what kind of experience you want to have. Looking to dominate in PVP? You bet build is important.
---
Read the inside the vault. Below are the important bits.
---
Read on to catch a few details about The Burrows, our first dungeon experience coming to Fallout 76
---
A new Wild Appalachia dungeon experience, The Burrows, will become available for the heartiest of explorers starting April 16. Muster your squad and follow in the footsteps of the Brotherhood of Steel who sent their own forces into the darkness and muck below Harper‚Äôs Ferry for mysterious reasons. We‚Äôll share more details about The Burrows in next week‚Äôs Inside the Vault, but we thought you might like this heads-up so you can get your characters prepped for this daunting new subterranean battleground.
---
My dude, why is it so painstakingly difficult to get it through your head that modding for multiplayer is orders of magnitude more difficult than modding for single player?
---
It‚Äôs on floor decor in the statue section

What makes you think there is not a continuous stream of people giving up on this game?  My experiences suggest that, and comments from those that did not give up on the game suggests that also.  Talk to anyone that has been around since the beginning and ask how much their "fried" list has thinned to almost no one being left.  In my opinion there are just new people jumping into the game, so new people to complain.   Not to say that some of the "veterans" that did not give up yet might not be complaining too.  I have said this a few times now, because I had hopes they would pull their heads out of their asses, before TSE/White knight nerf the nuke frequency on xbox 1 was INSANE, you could find areas getting triple nuked before the old zone dissipated.  I have never witnessed anything close to this level of activity again on xbox 1 at least.  I have read people claim the same dropoffs have occurred on PC too.  Back before those two nerfs, you could server hop and find someone spawning the queen very quick.  Now if I had to guess it is 1/10 the activity level overall with nuke zones and the queen.  I think many have left and won't be back till they see some change, other than Bethesda turning this more towards pay to play. (which is likely why they will be going that way, since this game is not a good seller)
---
Incisor works but they aren't one handed. They're unarmed specifically.
---
Talons and the other melee mutations do stack though
---
I bet there will be a million unwanted skins, and like two cool ones for 1000 atoms
---
Yep, it affects every melee. No it is not affected by gladiator, it is affected by bloody mess and iron fist though
---
I prefer to keep my pipboy free of poo particles.
---
Exactly!
---
And apparently the burrows get nuked too.
---
EXACT LY
---
I feel your pain. I had the same problem and i gave up and built a village system instead with buildings i connect power between
---
One starts at Southern belle motel and gives you the mounted wendigos plan. The other starts near toxic Larry's and gives you a mystery meat pie recipe. They were just added today alomg with the Burrows
---
:o can you send me the evidence? I'm intrigued
---
I would recommend putting your stats into the weapons you like the most to make the gameplay more fun. Some builds are better than others in some cases. But if you don't enjoy running around with a hammer, I would say use your favorite gun. 
---
In addition, if you don't like your build or how it's effecting your gameplay, you can respec your points later on
---
Can you elaborate? Sounds interesting
---
Good and fair response
---
I was about to buy the brown door for 300 but was upset because white doors fit better in my base....and they drop a white model with added decoration for the same price? Bought it on the spot.
---
Is effected by martial artist too, I believe. Will test when I get home tonight.
---
Are you using the drop button on it?
---
Please.....please design your laser nipple game.
---
PVP is a thing i love, but does a melee build hold up in PVP? 1v1? On the other hand is VATS effective in PVP?
---
Bethesda doesn't have a clue how to multiplayer,expect more of the same.
---
If you do the Raider questline you find out that one of the Gourmands was exiled and became the Wendigo in Wendigo Cave, I took plus the Gourmand‚Äôs absence in Appalachia (since I don‚Äôt recall finding any lore explaining where they all went) as an implication that the random Wendigos we encounter out in the world are all transformed Gourmands
---
This is defiantly a sheepsquatch nest. Earlier today if found a lone dead brahmin with the mysterious quills sticking out of it.  It appears sheepsquatch make nest and eat brahmin meat just like deathclaws. I'm starting to think Sheepsquatch is a different version of deathclaw the military was working on.
---
I'm not exactly a master at this (my character is kinda a mess at this point) but it depends on if you want to use more melee weapons or maybe you're more of a shotgun person or you want to be some sort of pistol type gunslinger person. You can also bring roleplay and backstory into your builds, although the way points are set up can limit that. But whatever you choose to do, put perks into what you think is most important or best for your build. :)
---
Composite skis &amp; ski swords around Pleasant Valley.

This is the dream! For now you could always message blast. I‚Äôd be thrilled to hear a private message that started off with the ‚ÄúEEEARRGGHEEEARRGGH attention all responders..‚Äù
---
No prob. Hope they help. And yeah I agree up on Melee and rifles and shotguns. Mini, Gatling,and 50cal are friends
---
Over at toxic Larry‚Äôs are skeleton corpses with quills stuck in them that you can pick up. The mode of the real sheepsquatch was found by data miners, and it has the same quills on its back. Also you can hear him in the holotape as he claims his victims lol

thanks, respecing seems hard in this at leas from the video

Doo dee dee doo doo dee doo dun dun dun dunda dun dunda dun

I really hope this doesn't turn into warframe, every update it seemed like people were looking for that "end game" it was getting annoying. Like if you have the gear that kills shit in one hit that's it you're a god, the devs won't cater to the group of people who decided to use the best of the best gear.
---
When is the dlc coming out
---
Ah. Has zero clue they were even a thing. Toxic Larry‚Äôs is where? Southern belle is np.
---
There‚Äôs a quest around it that you can initiate by going there to the roof. Short, but informing
---
People hyped the burrows up after the imposter, saying it was a sign of things to come.
---
thanks

I wanted to go into explosives and Sniping, but since i'm mainly a survival character I found explosives are poo. I settled for a VATS/Crit heavy sniper with the handmade rifle.

It's a reddit. For a video game. I posted about the broken game. You'll learn how reddit works once you aren't 26 days old. Welcome to your first reddits.

Cuz other ppl killed them. Meh. At this point it's the same as farming any other place with 62 ghouls, 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot, "hey this one was a  junkie", 1 shot, 1 shot, etc.

Just west of Berkley springs. The actual quest is at a campsite down the hill.

Nah that was fake news from bethesda. Turns out its a quick jaunt through some tunnels pretty much any level 50+ shouldn't have any problem with. The area looks cool, just take your time exploring since it is quite short.

Standard business practices.

Mine was level 35 too because of all the random level 35-45 in my Mire.

The day BIV and his booze quests were added somebody nuked Morgantown when I was playing one of my lower level characters to easily clear the level up daily.

I‚Äôve seen it nuked , it was surprisingly disappointing as there weren‚Äôt even that many enemies around.
---
Yes. This dungeon is more of an extra addition, it‚Äôs never been advertised by Beth as being ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù.
---
Okay. That‚Äôs a bit more specific, which is good. Do you still need help putting together a build or do you have one now?
---
It's trash pretty much. I'd rather they fix the bugs introduced with previous patch. Still can't install gifted/purchased mods, but they got time to release this bullshit. I can get more in one harpers ferry clearing.   Only time your going to be able to see this place is early I the morning. Peak times it will be constantly farmedif not camped. Lol no thought at all.. But look who were dealing with

The big mistake here was calling it a "dungeon".  That's a term people associate with MMORPGs and difficult 4-5 man content.  They should have just said 'we've added some new quests to the game in harpers ferry, some take you underground in sprawling sewer systems!".  
---
I personally thought the quest was nice, and the new area was very interesting and fun to explore (though a little hindered by so many other people).  Problem is the way they described it.   
---
Luckily this was an added bonus outside of what was included in the roadmap so it's hard to be too disappointed.  I still enjoy it and see the farmability.  Got several legendary spawns.
---
This game is easy enough you can get through almost all the content with a ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù build. But superpowered builds have a domino effect in a survival game with consumables, ammo use, repairs...
---
They need less of all of those because they take far fewer hits, and take far fewer shots to kill. Which also means they ‚Äúdo things‚Äù faster when everything is a 1shot.
---
On account of you being an absolute child that is. A blocked child.
---
Dude,I solo,d it in no time. It was a joke.
---
Have exactly same issue, power lines go to empty space, used to be missile and heavy laser turrets there on a walkway, also missing.  Another missing heavy machinegun turret inside the building.  Fracking 76 sucksarse so often.  Budget says 4 turrets available but when go to build them, it says at the limit already. Does Bethesda do anything right?
---
Its the bombs u get for the daily from Boomer the broken police protectron outside a motel in The Mire.  Afaik they have no use.
---
You attack me then block me. Weird flex but ok.
---
Yea I've been having lots of crashes, might have to do something with my mods

Different kind of game. We've been over this. Been like this since launch, and the game still maintains a strong playerbase.
---

Anyone else having luck attaching these mods yet? Still. Or working for me.
---
While that may be the case - using a Construction Set to introduce a new dungeon would be the same on a multiplayer game. For whatever reason, Modders have created missing features from text chat to perk card loadouts - things you‚Äôd figure are extremely difficult to introduce into a multiplayer game but done by the modding community all the same. 
---
It seems like you have an idea in your head of a complexity that can‚Äôt possibly be grasped by the modding community. Truth is that BGS retrofits all of their old stuff to save time and money, hence the recycled assets from Fallout 4: a single player game. It is a part of their company philosophy to the point that they retrofit old franchises such as Wolfenstein and Fallout itself. Their Construction Set remains majorly the same, and the fact that modders from Fallout 4 are able to make multiplayer mods for Fallout 76 is quite telling of the ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù issue.
---
Lmao! Love it!
---
Why this was given gold i'll never understand...
---
You are wrong sir the playerbase is not strong and the game is failing....
---
I misread the title thinking I was missing something with the burrows... I thought this was a walkthrough... I am so dissapointed.
---
Not today. Smooth for me.
---
Dumb tip that will probably be patched if more people catch on to it but... Spam the action button. Sometimes the box takes a second to be added to your inventory. I've pulled about 40ish pins from one box once, usually just 3-15 though. This also works with bobbleheads and magazines but I've only picked up 2 extra magazines and 1 extra bobblehead this way.

I don't think nuking will change anything underground.

To be fair I have other games way way WAY above 2000 hours.
---
Ugh.
---
I concur!
---
Wow same issue here besides my rant about a 1v1 thing. The word "some" is completely skewed beyond logic.
---
For being a "fan", you sure do seem to hate on Fallout 76. Quite ironic really
---
There were hundreds of people alive in the Appalachia like the week before 76 opened. This isn‚Äôt far fetched
---
I'm not sure if your joking or not but it does happen. Not often but I've seen it alot around the power plant and ammo dump
---
I'm assuming this is because in pre-world apocalypse they didn't have cell phone technology. I could be wrong but I'm sure they didn't sit and play on their phones?
---
Curious what you have to say about modders from Fallout 4 (single player game) creating Text chat and Perk card loadout mods for Fallout 76 (a multiplayer game).
---
I haven‚Äôt played it yet but heck why do people keep complaining about it like babies. It‚Äôs just a new area of the gigantic game world, if there‚Äôs a new boss, great, if it‚Äôs just a bunch of random ghouls, what‚Äôs the big deal? Majority of the wasteland has only ghouls no big legendary boss anyways.
---
I think you should quickly go make a YouTube video.   This game is amazing, loving it!
---
Yeah I'm down I'll add you later tonight.
---
Here we go with the downvotes ,white knights defending more of Bethesda's drivle.Im pretty sure it was Bethesda themselves that called this garbage a "dungeon" and claimed it was tuned for 2 50+ characters...just lol.They hyped this crap up with a back story about BOS and blah,blah.
---
That radiation purge and safe room really sounds like the Destiny Wrath of the Machine Raid fight against Voksis, love it. But idk, if there‚Äôs no safe rooms in-between to rearm/repair getting through it will be tedious as hell. If all four die I also think those safe spaces should act as checkpoints, cause restarting sounds way too harsh, especially with how much you have to invest in terms of ammo, aid, and junk(for repairs). All in all it sounds interesting, as I love raid mechanics.
---
I've never had anyone attempt to steal a workshop from me or anyone I've played with.  I guess I might just be lucky or something I dunno
---
I had one mole rat come up right next to my camp where the turrets couldn't hit it. It slowly worked its way through a wall, got inside, and then started going after everything inside. I've also come back to a camp to find almost every crop, resource collector, water purifier, and generator destroyed with  a lone level 5 super mutant just plinking away at what was still standing.
---
Yep.  Same here.
---
Thanks for asking this I couldn‚Äôt find mine either.
---
Yes, my bad for planning a trip 4 months ago then realising I need to have access 24/7 or miss out. It's not like every other game in existence has their content online for a week or two at a time. Should have known. Coming next week: "FREE 2000 ATOMS... for all players who purchase 5000 atoms in the next 7 seconds, get to it chumps!!"
---
Yes it was. They are both by Bethesda game studios. They may have been by different regional offices, but they are both under the leadership of BGS.
---
I want it to succeed badly....yes I'm a fan and yes I'm critical....its out of love......I want this to be the best game ever
---
Sort of sounds like 76 was someone playing around with Fallout 4 and made it online, then they went from there and then after release the idea of normal MMORPG started ringing in their head and then realized that the system isn‚Äôt designed for that
---
Blatant lies lmao. Check the statistics
---
It's a shame that Whitesprings is the only \*real\* endgame content. It's the same thing every day if you want to progress... Whitesprings&gt;Cabins &amp; Plants&gt;West Tek&gt;Steakhouse &amp; Robco&gt;Watoga. I was hoping this new "dungeon" would give something new; but It's not even worth farming.
---
Too many people on the sub dont get that.
---
I hate the foundation floor it looks so ewww. I prefer building on flat ground/neutral housing (I play plenty of building games plus fallout 4.
---
It's very rare nowadays. Used to even a once a week thing but occasionally I'll see it every few weeks. Just server hop and block.
---
In OP's defense. TSE is "far" from the best legendary effects you want on your weapon these days for endgame players. Instigating and Bloodied (with mutations) are way more damaging. Just a regular instigating shotgun would do 50% more damage in OP's case.
---
We know of four more major dungeons coming over the next couple months.  Arktos Pharma definitely has a large scale complex underneath that's likely going to end up being accessible through currently-useless elevators.
---
The other three we know of are Vaults 63, 94, and 96.  While those aren't open, I and plenty of others have been all throughout the pre-release versions of them as far back as the beta.  63 was the closest to being ready the last I saw it before they finally fixed a wall-glitch from Fallout 4 and it looks like it's going to be a ton of fun.  I explored every inch of all three of the vaults and I can say they're at least much bigger than any vault I've ever seen in any iteration of the series so far.  96 is gorgeous inside, they did an excellent job and I can't wait to see what the actual mission ends up being for that one.  Much of the lore was already written into terminals in there, but there wasn't much if anything about what the actual group mission will be.
---
I'm not saying it's like wandering into Blackreach, but it's at least bigger (in all cases so far) than any Vaults in 3/NV/4.
---
We should get those three Vaults (not sure what's up with 65 or 51, the new ones datamined from the booze update) this summer.  I'll be honest - not certain when we'll get Arktos.  It's not among the Wild Apalachia announcements so it could be summer or fall or just a surprise.
---
What stats are you speaking of
---
Very true
---
Yeah u have this problem as well I have to punch it with my fists so I can complete it normally lol
---
IMO everyone who tries to kill her fails at least once. Don't get too discouraged.  People are always nuking prime, so you'll get another chance, that is of course unless you want to nuke it yourself.   If you do, look to see how full the server is and how many people are past level 100.   Not everybody who comes needs to be that high, of course, but 4-5 people past 100 generally gives a good advantage. What platform are you on?
---
But I never did the event?
---
I want a drone mounted camera. That would be fun.
---
Daily player count, server count, etc. Hell, this sub alone gets crazy active
---
Shhh, don't say that.
---
They'll stealth nerf it.
---
Sorry bro I don‚Äôt see every post on this subreddit
---
I've had a lot of crashes on Xbox last night, 6 of them. I decided to reinstall the game, but it seems to have only occurred the last several days which makes me think It's related to the recent patch (Maybe burrows). This is the worst crashing I've had since the game first launching.
---
It seems that want you want is in fact instancing, rather than everyone sharing the same spawns because there is no instancing
---
The last run I did I got 5 legendaries, most were shit but still happy to find a nice place to farm.
---
cool
---
That would explain why I haven't seen anyone in a while.
---
The design bit is fair.  The whole engine is designed for single player play, so they're having to pull out the digital WD40 and Ducktape to make all this shit work.  
---
Still, that just means the item storage needs restructuring. The current method is unsustainable. Even with the limits. The servers are clearly still under too much strain. The fact that we could crash the servers by crafting too much highlighted that.
---
As for lore... I'd counter that having to throw out huge piles of ammo/junk/etc is more immersion breaking than being able to accumulate too much.  The idea that we would throw away ammo instead of finding more room for it makes it feel worthless and overly abundant.  And it just feels *bad*.
---
Indubitably.
---
You need to repair them if they show yellow in build mode. Sometimes you can‚Äôt see them at all if they are destroyed while in normal mode.
---
Searched for it using FO76Edit and it seems like it doesn't spawn anywhere yet since it ain't referenced in any leveled lists.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/567877452366348297/unknown.png
---
looks like they're still broken, i tried today.
---
They **never** said it was going to be instanced.
---
Yeah man I one shotted everything in it. Sneak archer ftw.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm speechless, also the laying low line I feel like I missed something? I traveled and did those as well and they are done and gone and I feel like I missed something? What the hell? Where is this Uber endgame dungeon we are being promised?? Really?
---
Yeah, figured they propably used it to make the burrows look cool without actually having any interest in implementing the actual suit :/ oh well
---
It does not. It's just a regular, high ouput generator.
---
Wasn't implying that they did. Simply making people aware.
---
Yes.
---
That's what I said.
---
That's literally not true though. And if you knew anything about development on this set, you would know that.   
---
Example: scripts in all single player games on the CK engine fire triggers based on the "player". There is only ever one player, because it's a single player game.  Who is the "player" in FO76? The quest has to account for the fact that at any point in time there are up to 2 dozen players it could be referring to. Literally any port of FO4 scripting content has to be rewritten at the most fundamental level to account for the fact that it's a multiplayer game.   
---
Your reference to modders creating "missing features" shows just how ignorant you are. That "text chat"? You realize that they're just running a private server that sends ALL of your chat directly to them, in plaintext, unfiltered, for them to do anything they want right? You realize that would in no way be acceptable for any commercial game to release, right? And that using it, along with other mods like perk card loadouts, break the game consistently and result in dozens of posts every patch about how people are falling through the world?   
---
And that's your great, shining example?  But sure, you go on believing it "would be the same on a multiplayer game."  Keep showing us that you have no idea what you're talking about, when you point out recycled art assets (spoiler: most of the allegedly recycled assets from FO4 have actually been completely retextured, and cosmetic assets literally have nothing to do with quest design so your argument is wholly irrelevant.).  
---
It seems like you have an idea in your head of a game that is very different from the one that actually exists. Yet, you want to make these broad assertions about how long things would take to make, as if you had any clue. And not only do you not, it's evident that you're clueless about your own ignorance.   
---
So, please, do go on and use your knowledge of the Morrowind mod tools from 2002 and make a better Burrows. I'm sure you can do it by this weekend, right? It's not that hard, and since you claim to have all this figured out, it should be trivial for you.   
---
Wasn‚Äôt just one picture, there was a video. And like two or three pictures. Not picking sides here just want to clarify this point lol
---
It may not be the best game ever but Bethesda is trying in their own way. The free DLC has brought back many players even if it isn't the best. But remember, it's *free*. The studio has given us somewhat of an NPC town called Helvetia with the Fasnacht event. There will be time to add new things. But constantly asking for things and then getting upset when they didn't add it a day later, is no way to support the game. They have a roadmap, and contrary to popular belief, if they do something other than that, but they think players want it, they'll be crucified for it. Let them do their own pace, and wait for the next roadmap
---
Google "instanced"
---
Not unless it‚Äôs a bug. That‚Äôs not a thing.
---
Yeah no kidding. I just got an instigating plasma siper rifle and am disappointed as hell.
---
It is the opposite of what your title says and the body did nothing to contradict that
---
That's hilarious! I've heard of other people 1 hit it, but it doesn't die and it goes into the hiding phase when it spawns in the wave. But somehow I bypassed that.
---
Yes and scorch plague wiped them out.
---
The trading subs help the longevity as well, that's my favorite part right now, I'm kinda hooked on it lmao
---
Yeah they just let us hype it up this isn't on Bethesda. 
---
 However I do feel that there should be an instanced version on either a daily or weekly lockout that is significantly harder with mobs that exceed the normal level cap.  Add in some wendigo packs and sentry bots and it could be significantly more fun and engaging.
---
\^ This. 110%.
---
Like, how are people making better content as mods for say Fallout 4 for FREE, WITHOUT PAY, than paid developers, hired for this specific purpose, that probably had to go through interviews, resume examinations, degrees, etc.  
---
And we get lackluster content, that obviously wasn't tested. Who at Bethesda thought this was challenging? 
---
I'm about to go through there with a pipe pistol and no armor and complete it.
---
Silos are longer, more interesting and harder to do than this 'dungeon'. Not that, that is saying a lot.  
---
Charging through West-Tek Solo, is more challenging and rewarding than this.
---
But they‚Äôve done it all though so far?

No, it wasn't. FO76 was developed by BGS Austin, which is formerly Battlecry Studios. It's very much a different developer entirely, and they are entirely different companies.   
---
Blades was developed by Bethesda Games Studios, Maryland. It's not the same developers, not even the same company; they just are both owned by Zenimax.
---
This post is from a while ago but oh well, ill buy that quad lever action rifle

---
You're right - The Burrows weren't a roadmap item.  They aren't on the Wild Appalachia release list: as seen [here](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/40o6r9tR5VkoMudGUgl9qg/fb745bd7f94a83991f95c53cf6bb8b8a/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-10-EN.jpg)
---
Why would they be working on a different studios game?...
---
I just got word that nuking it works btw
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZ-LGaRB6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZ-LGaRB6M) They crescendo the promotional video with the borrows. Not with the Sheepsquatch, (which still isn't fully concluded yet so no its not in chronological order just like how the legendary vendor isn't out) or with the Fasnacht Parade (which offered way better rewards for completing it multiple times). Objectively speaking they hyped up borrows without have anything real to show for its current release. They also made it look like people running around in 4+ parties with x-01 power armor might have a bit of fun there when its just like any other location.   
---
Do not justify their actions by saying we should expect less from Bethesda. That is both sad and disturbing.
---
It shouldn't have launched like this
---
I see an interesting atom shop item on the horizon.
---
Old style ui would be cool, it buy it for 200-400.
---
The locations need to be instanced..... meaning that enemies spawn for each player.
---
Therefore this instancing garbage needs to be fixed becy it's not working the day it should. It's not difficult stuff so take your straw man bullshit somewhere else troll.
---
Tomato tomato
---
Better... for what? What are you trying to do? PVP means a high value on assassins. Low health bloodied melee means unyielding. If you‚Äôre not purely one of those two, you would have to refine your goals to know what‚Äôs better.
---
9/10 good meme.
---
Does it change? The password I used was El Ma 13 17
---
Take a look at what I commented on the other guy saying that its our fault from expecting more.
---
Yer tbh I'm a Bethesda fan boy myself and have been blindly defending this game since release but the slow dlc release with next to no content is starting to piss me off
---
I currently have the same issue.  I Scan and Repair‚Äôd it and ended up needing a 2 GB download. Downloading now...
---
Maybe there are a couple that work.
---
you right you right. sometimes i forget BGS abd BS are two dofferent studios, in my head i just think ‚Äúbethesda.‚Äù thank you for the correction
---
Assassins gives an additional 8% dmg reduction over just sentinal, but onpy vs. other players. Unyielding gives additional STAT bonuses based on how low you health is.
---
It depends on what you want it for. Unyielding requires you to play a low health build to get the full benefits. Assassins is only beneficial vs. other players.
---
The sentinal 3rd perk is the crucial one, you can mix 1st stats how you'd like.
---
xbox
---
Hehe made me look \^\^
---
While I'm a bit disappointed that it is seemingly very short (haven't been there yet), what I have read about the place matches what was *actually said* about it.  It wasn't intended to be some epic instanced raid, it's a bit of a side quest and some lore, in a new and interesting location.  It's not even on the roadmap, and people somehow *assumed* this was going to be some end-game loot farm.
---
oh...I always mute game music. I guess I missed out on the highlight of that "challenging" 4 minute dungeon.
---
My bad. Google "grammar".
---
They need to balance everything so junkies, berserkers, etc will be used by different parties/builds
---
Why would there be a lockout? Lockouts are what give people time to get bored. Pretty pointless if you're not in a sub model.
---
It was probably still packaged with the new content and then somehow they forgot to take the challenges off. It seems time constraints are making the new content difficult to deliver on time and working
---
The wendigo boss in whitesprings golf course drops 5-6 spoils every time for me.
---
Pre-made/packaged mods aren't functional since the last patch. It's affecting PA, weapons, and reg armor. Right now you can only apply mods you've unlocked and know.
---
This was already answered, but I wanted to let you know that you do not have to have the mats when using a packaged mod. They're in there already. You only need mats if you plan to apply the same mod to more than 1 item which you could (when they were working) do until you left the crafting screen.
---
Shit
---
\^This right here.\^
---
To say they didn't hype this in a very misleading way is just laughable. 
---
Just watch this panel discussion with Todd Howard and others.  They keep talking about Fallout 76 saying there's "things coming up that will knock your socks off! But we can't talk about it."  
---
Saying they can't talk about it is mean to build suspense and if "knock your socks off" isn't the language of hype, I don't know what is. 
---
Video here.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zIQaXj8h6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zIQaXj8h6o)
---
&gt; Curious to see if nuking it does anything interesting.
---
It's underground. Would the ghouls still turn to glowing ghouls?
---
Did you figure out what a straw man argument was?
---
Do you have any input on the topic or just straw man arguments?
---
It was in the notes last week.
---
PSA never server hop without power armor now.
---
Don't know why you got a down vote for that because it is the absolute and unquestionable truth.
---
I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but from the Bethesda Game Studios Web site:
---
"Bethesda Game Studios is the award-winning development team known around the world for their groundbreaking work on The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. Creators of the 2006 ‚ÄòGame of the Year‚Äô, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the 2008 ‚ÄòGame of the Year‚Äô, Fallout 3, the 2011 ‚ÄòGame of the Year‚Äô, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and most recently, the 2015 ‚ÄòGame of the Year‚Äô, the record-breaking Fallout 4, the winner of more than 200 'Best Of' awards including the 2016 BAFTA and 2016 D.I.C.E. Game of the Year, Fallout Shelter, the award-winning mobile game with more than 120 million users, and most recently the highly-anticipated Fallout 76 and The Elder Scrolls: Blades. Bethesda Game Studios has earned its reputation as one of the industry‚Äôs most respected and accomplished game development studios."
---
Further that, when you visit the "Our Studios" Web site under Bethesda-the-publisher' web site (https://bethesda.net/en/studios), it does not distinguish between the various Bethesda Game Studios teams and the various other developers under Bethesda the publisher. This addresses your second argument.
---
It says in the source you put, cameras were originally supossed to be released today but they had to push it back. It's in the second paragraph, so I doubt it's quiet lol
---
For clarification, Bethesda Softworks is a publisher, not a studio. The whole conglomerate is quite complex.
---
Nope you saw PA and assumed it was gonna be nails.  They could take a screenshot from uranium fever event with 5+ guys in PA and using the same logic that makes it needed for the content? 
---
As I said it's needs abit of tuning but they didn't overhype it that's on you.
---
What a disappointment.
---
Y‚Äôknow man, you do have a point. Just like the 100+ other people that already made threads bashing on the same exact thing before you made it. Chill, my dudebro.
---
Yes, but it didn't say that when the article released on the 11th.
---
i‚Äôve been drinking whiskey all night i think i‚Äôm just gonna make it as simple as possible and just say ‚Äúzenimax.‚Äù that way everyone can be confused
---
We are not having an argument. It's a discussion.
---
Should have put some money down bro!
---
I was lucky enough to get to do this dungeon without any other players around. I used an over-repaired level 35 Mutant's Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and almost literally mowed down the entire dungeon without power armor. The ghouls mostly just exploded as soon as they got to me.
---
I think the only time I used any kind of stim was during the Mr. Gutsy part and that's just because I ran full sprint into about 4 of them. 
---
Despite it being ridiculously easy, I did think the environment itself was very well done. Just needed to throw in some bigger boss like bullet sponges with some basic mechanics and it would have been a much more fun experience.
---
Actually, last week's hot fix more or less corrupted my hard drive. Attempting to reinstall the game for the 4 bloody time after having formatted the hard drive with my laptop. If your other games are also crashing on start up chances are your hard drive is shot like mine. I am hoping I don't have to buy a new one :/.
---
What's in the cases?
---
Thank you, glad someone's have a good connection.
---
A phone is a must when you sit, and everyone loves a good sit. ‚ÄúNever stand when you can sit. Never sit when you can lay down.‚Äù Winston Churchill.
---
I didn't see it in the notes last week when I read it.
---
So, apparently neither did whoever is in charge of the atom challenges, as the daily for today is regarding two camera based challenges... Sooo, yeah?
---
"Quiet" as in they told you but you don't like to read
---
Pretty sure I remember reading it then. It's also dated April 11th on the bottom
---
Just played through the new dlcs story and just woah man.
---
Game is still fairly new and just getting better. Looking forward to more things added.
---
I want the blood splatter skin they have for combat armor redone for Raider Power Armor. I don't really see raiders making the effort for fancy power armor paint jobs, but getting blood all over it and not bothering to clean it off works.
---
I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but Zenimax bought Battlecry Studios well before they were BGS Austin.  
---
 [https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/](https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/)

 "It was already a subsidiary of Bethesda‚Äôs parent company, ZeniMax Media, but this change still raises a lot of questions about the future of BattleCry, which [suspended development](https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-has-concerns-about-battlecry-and-is-evaluating-it/) all the way back in 2015.¬†"  
---
You'll notice it has a different Studio Head entirely. This is because it's literally a different studio.  
---
Further:  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-03-09-battlecry-studios-becomes-third-bethesda-game-studios-office](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-03-09-battlecry-studios-becomes-third-bethesda-game-studios-office)   
---
" The division already operates two studios - its HQ in Rockville, Maryland, and a Montreal office that it opened in 2015.
---
The new Austin studio will be managed by industry veteran Doug Mellencamp as studio director."  
---
So no, they're very different developers that simply share the same name, and same parent company.  Thanks for playing, try again!
---
Well I can at least tell you why they don't autoscrap: they're related to a throwing weapon called the Sheepsquatch Shard.
---
I said I read it. So there's no need to be a cunt mate.
---
Normally I see these comments in response to stuff like a single 4k sword or something, but in this case you're right. It's very easy to out together cells.
---
Yeah, you definitely have to rotate. Watch out for Berkeley Springs and Dolly Sods and Thunder Mountain. They get scorchbeast attacks. A missile turret or two isn't a terrible idea if you are uncomfortable taking them down in the air.
---
Well if that's the case then, Why am I getting Atom challenges for the Camera today instead of the 23rd of April?
---
They said that it is doable with two level 50+ characters, so I wasn't expecting a very difficult dungeon. Still haven't done it but I'm curious how easy/repeatable it is
---
What exactly are you discussing?
---
You haven't given any input to the discussion on the topic of how the game is handling spawn instances.
---
Again...... you're using a straw man. The title says the instancing needs to be fixed. What are your thoughts on the way instances are handled?
---
Yes my Jetpack x-01 torso disappeared
---
Handheld camera and player vending have been delayed already. Also the content we have gotten is fairly weak for a game that's been out for five months.
---
You said it but I didn't bother to read that
---
I just ran it myself.  Saw about 20 - 25 ghouls.  There were four of us in there though so it may have something to do with it.  Maybe 4 gutsy and an assaultron.  It was decent.  Lots of junk to gather.
---
Yea, oversight on their part. Sucks :(
---
Ohhh... Basically "you're" has a extended o sound in it. While "your" is short and sweet.
---
Are you able to pass on that a challenge to level up 3 times in a day is also bad?
---
That's the part everyone is hooked on, most likely didn't switch them out being it was set to be released today but 5 days ago they had to postpone it
---
I liked the dungeons, got a huge load of legendaries and leveled up, had a pretty decent experience
---
Yep literally everybody is upset about the "dungeon". They talked it up so much only for it to be kinda pathetic at best. I hope they fix it.
---
Also, you could look at their dev t-shirts (holler at me if you find one for sale)  
---

---
See "Battlecry" on there? That's BGSA. They're literally a separate studio, they only just now changed their name because of FO76.
---
Just those random encounters on the map.
---
I'd just be happy not to have to sift through dozens of posts of people bitching about it.
---
What are you even on about?
---
20/24ish hours?
---
BGS isn't the one making this game
---
It's much harder the higher you go up in level. Better to make smarter decisions now. Like others have said. Google all the different weapon classes in this game and pick one or two to focus on. This is most players approach.
---
I lost a a piece of armor yesterday and a hazmat suit today while inside PA. once i fast traveled the pieces disappeared. both would have been top of the list alphabetically. wild
---
Being a general cunt really, have a good day
---
I would imagine it's difficult for the FO76 team to create content, develop/integrate new systems while also dealing with numerous bugs. When you think about it; it shouldn't be much of a surprise that they are struggling with a live service game with their track record.
---
Didn‚Äôt we get mad at them for rushing the game? What do people want? Bet if they put those too out early you‚Äôd have complained. It‚Äôs not even really that weird that Beth might struggle a bit with constantly releasing content for a type of game they‚Äôve never done before. I just kind of feel like as of right now this comment is pretty nit-picky.
---
Players can‚Äôt make the mods
---
They craft the mod directly onto your piece
---
If you worried I should be. I just hit 60 today
---
Uh huh.. It seems to be all that convenient to me really. Bethesda seemed to hype this dungeon crawl up, so people would forget about the Camera. But whatever.
---
Good place for violet flux
---
I thought so, but as im server hoping at the normal locations the weapons have not respawned. I know for a fact i picked them up around 3 hours ago my time yesterday and they will not respawn
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking I‚Äôm asking if I buy a MOD (the item) for myself and then try to attach it do I need the perks associated?
---
Everyone's complaining and I'm just sitting here like, let me on a server so I can play!!!
---
I spent a month. Gathered 4 legacy heavies, over 300 plasma cores, 100 fusion cores, 20k in .308 ammo, 50k 5mm, 30k 50cal. a metric fuckton of missiles, Mini nukes, 40mm and anti armor/Bloodied/Vampire variants of almost each weapon that uses em.
---
I'm underwhelmed
---
Try server hopping, someone probably picked it up already
---
I encountered 2 3\* ghouls and a couple no star.  Took three attempts to finish it because the game crashed twice.  Drops were nothing good though.  I plan to run it more and get a feel...but yeah, it felt like Whitesprings in closer quarters
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs kinda what it appeared to be, looks like it‚Äôs time to farm some random encounters.
---
Im not sure why you are being passive aggressive. Im sorry that I gave you the impression that im dismissing what im told because it doesnt fit my narrative, i was only asking out of curiosity. You didnt answer the question, you said "im the best pvp player, youre not so im automatically right." 
---
If it isnt meta, then why are most (almost all) late game builds essentially including these effects, while being the most sought after gear?  Thats the definition of meta. You said it yourself, youre fighting these guys all the time. By "non-idiot" players, im assuming you mean those who know how to counter the armor effects. Im not saying that they cant be countered and that those armor users are unkillable, but they do have a strong advantage over the other options late game. The way you counter them is a lot more limited than the way you counter others. Crits, gernades, radiation, percentage damage and more are the counters, but if you were not wearing the same armor, they dont have to worry about using these counters when fighting back. For example, fully geared they can survive almost any weapons while standing still with all that percentage damage negation -this is a unnecessary problem in itself. You need to force them to move, take advantage of them standing still, or alternatively use damage that could peirce through or not be negated. All while they can return fire as you try voiding their spongy armor. These are very specific counters, not normal build counters. By your logic, tse weapons are perfectly balanced compared to the other weapons and  are not meta.
---
Only if you are level 10 or so.
---
Try it yourself! Best of luck to ya! Have fun man!
---
Well at least it's a fifth grind location for my route.
---
What were the keys for? I only went in one entrance, never found a door needing keys. Is it for the other entrance?
---
Ive hopped many servers and there is no way this many people regularly pick up chainsaws at clarkssburg
---
kILL 50 mirelurk , insect , robots , scorched &amp; canines
---
Nuking everything you can is a good idea.
---
Yep....I lost an excavator arm last night (on xbox).
---
To each their own, camera was set to release at same time as dungeon, got postponed but the challenges are still there. That's the gist and they'll release the camera soon. I'd rather have it work, than cause server crashes or instability whenever someone goes to use it. I'm okay waiting on it
---
Uh huh.. Piss off :)
---
Damn...
---
Yes, except mine end up back in my inventory and when I put it all back together my carry weight still sits at a measly 250.
---
Wait 2 days then, maybe that should do it
---
Yeah - even when it isnt other players I have been attacked since the recent update by creatures, and turrets have just ignored them as I have had super mutants shoot up my CAMP
---
Damn. Guess I can solo it then. Which was a lone wanderer helps üòÇ
---
You too ‚ù§
---
I‚Äôve been able to attach mods if I already have the plan for that mod. I can build calibrated shocks for t-60 but when I went to do it, it auto-used the mods from my stash. That‚Äôs the only instance I‚Äôve seen them work since the patch. When I didn‚Äôt even want to use them.
---
Well, my input is a matter of perspective. Might be hard for you to see it, but I am sure someone will.
---
Be aware that mods are broken at the moment. Since patch 8. There were expectations it would be fixed today, but putting out The Burrows must've taken the coder off that job to make sure there were no God lights in there, or scorched in a wall.
---
What on earth is your problem?
---
Cool find! Sooner or later the beast will be found and slain!
---
Do I need to explain this again?
---
Hey I played AO too back in the day. 225 Omni MP "Souljak". Those were the days.
---
Sorry for offtopic but those are some fond memories.
---
Many of the underground shots are below Arktos Pharma, not the burrows. I don‚Äôt think the trailer created the current disappointment. There were other suggestions of the burrows being tough and/or instanced which were more misleading.
---
I did one of the naked ones laying down on a bear skin rug. Makes me smile every time it shows up on a load screen.  If I had the nuclear glare pose (I think that's the one) I'd get a shot of that in front of the standing bear in white springs.
---
I like how you conveniently left this bit out of your quotes from the second article:
---
"Now the firm has become part of Bethesda Softwork's primary internal development unit, Bethesda Game Studios."
---
;)
---
What platform you on?
---
I like how you had no leg to stand on here, so you constructed a completely fabricated scenario that still doesn't actually prove your point.  
---
Nobody owes you shit. Game developers don't know your vacation schedule, nor should they.  If you want to go on holiday, that's your deal. Bring a laptop and log in that way, if missing out on one day of optional content is a dealbreaker for you.  Or don't, but why you think that your vacation restrictions are anyone elses problem other than your own is fucking asinine.
---
I was kind of confused, honestly. Found manhole, hopped inside, looked around and found various lore, smacked around a few Gutsies and an Assaultron, maybe 30 or so ghouls. Got a 3* metal arm, four miscellaneous 1* items for my troubles. No quest ever triggered, and I did die once, but from stupidity of fiddling with my Pip-Boy without realizing I missed a Gutsy behind me.
---
I like the atmosphere of the area, but I saw nothing that would make me go out of my way to repeat the experience.
---
Have it more then usual to,and a looooot of lag also
---
Sometimes this happens when I don‚Äôt quit the game. When I just turn off the Xbox. When I shut the game down before turning the Xbox off it respawns like it should.
---
Thanks Captain Obvious, I like how I literally pointed that out in my very first post.
---
#nukes own camp
---
How did you get that?
---
Fallout 76 has suffered under the assault of people who expect perfection since launch. It‚Äôs an impossible ideal. Either things are too hard or not hard enough. A unique world essentially frozen shortly after the outbreak of the scorched is too different from normal. Too much reading and listening to lost records required for lore, but not enough being talked at by npc‚Äôs doing the exact same thing.
---
76 has real issues, but they‚Äôre mostly mechanical/bug related. The story is in depth and very interesting if you follow it properly. I want to know more about how we (must, at some point) stop the SBQ‚Äôs from leaving appalachia, since we know they don‚Äôt exist outside in the future.
---
A portion of the community lives to hate the game- yet they‚Äôre still here.
---
Well next time i see you launch one on HF ill join you, i noticed the last time it was nuked i had more luck with RNG when running around with a bunch of people vs just going solo.
---
Still would like a little apartment like location you can make your own.
---
I would love that!
---
My perspective is that you were being a troll and you attempted to achieve that with a shitty straw man argument.
---
I'm sure everyone else can look at your posting history and quickly conclude that you are indeed a troll.
---
2000 hours is a full year of 8 hours per day gameplay.   
---
Not sure where you're going with this point.
---
I dont really understand the fuss, I've had an overall fun experience in the dungeons
---
Just look at the top/ best post on this site and you‚Äôll see why. PSA if you server hop the burrows don‚Äôt do it out of power armor for a while.
---
I did the same. No armor, but with blocker, barbarian, and ironclad perks. Wore the grognak outfit. One hit everything with a lv35 bloodied tambo. 1 stim because assaultrons hurt.
---
Oh, you still need the rank to install it
---
But. You can‚Äôt install mods atm
---
Game‚Äôs busted
---
maybe then it would take 6 minutes to finish instead of 5
---
Scoot actually IS the wendigo. One of the clues is a note indicating he killed and ate not only Kevin but the gourmand cannibal also.
---
Place it instead of dropping, never drop your PA because someone else can steal it when you do
---
I must have miss read i was thinking the insane guy did it mainly cause scoot was damn near dead
---
Thank you for this!
---
Been trying to find how to get the UHDmap.ba2 working with the latest patch - using this custom INI worked a treat (at least I think it does - nothing seems to be broken).
---
Thank you!
---
Hmm I liked and got like 8 legendary drops so not complaining
---
Its fun yes but there was the expectation of harder enemies and a repeatable quest for better loot i like the abundance of enemies but i prefer a nice large dungeon that makes you question why you even entered
---
I am not a big fan of the pvp, just wanting the best armor I can find without being in PA all of the time. Seems like assassins and unyeilding are the most desired but I didn't know why. Thanks for your help!
---
Its not fungeon, people.
---
1) It's Easter
---
2) It's a long weekend
---
3) It's the Easter long weekend
---
They should know that.
---
wondering the same farming now since beginning of the brewing and have all kinda which now getting 2-3 times the same but no  Firecracker Whiskey  yet.
---
even on tradediscord not even one asking for it or offering.
---
seems like they didnt implent it yet or its insane rare.
---
have around 20 recipes already
---
Well it may be because I dont have legendary weapons but the enemies in general where a little hard for me, but the loot it gave me was the best part of the experience
---
Im suprised this is still a common error on the players side one guy lost a couple sets cause the whole time he would just toss it on the floor
---
Knock knock! Who‚Äôs there? Hot Hats. Hot Hats who? It‚Äôs the World Wide Web. You can believe anything you want to, that‚Äôs who. I‚Äôll never be able to unsee it now. Not that that‚Äôs a bad thing. Also, my knock knock joke was terrible. Sorry.
---
Think it'll be a player weapon or one for a creature?
---
I used to live at the top of the cliff but o moved under the bridge so the scorchbeasts would quit eating me camp.
---
I'm sure they do, which is why they put a login reward to capture the vast majority of people who will be \*home\* over that long weekend.   
---
Not seeing how any of those things entitles you to special treatment.
---
Thanks for the clarification. Are there any other options I should look into  that are not geared towards pvp? Low health seems risky to me
---
How do you get those
---
Player, there's an unlockable crafting plan for it that requires the quill and a few other components.
---
‚ÄúShould of‚Äù was my favorite part of this post, thank you for the slight chuckle
---
&gt;This week: this burrow was supposed to be a 1-2 hour experiance that my level 425 should die 15 times MINIMUM inside. And definelty walk out with multiple 3 Star weapons that should be guaranted god rolls
---
So it's good to make more posts about it? This reddit is high volume. You will see lots and lots of opinions.
---
I kinda have a general idea now after talking to a few folks, but nothing on paper. If you want to show me a build with what I had in mind i'd be more than happy to check it out. I don't care for the chem thirst perk I only need the ones that makes them last longer and makes more than one every time I craft
---
I can actually see both sides of the argument. When it first went live I trotted along on one of my higher level chars, thinking I'm in for an ass kicking and ended up blitzing through it. Not helped by there being several others down there so doors were already open, enemies dead etc so from that point of view it was a total letdown. A shame as I thought the actual area was pretty well done. 
---
 Then I went snooping about on a level 39 when nobody else was around and everything had respawned. A totally different, intense and exciting experience. It' seriously challenging to the point I bailed before getting to the first locked door. 
---
 The issue really seems who it's been aimed at. If it had have been in the main game at launch so people were running it around the same time as Belly of the Beast it would have been one of the high points of the game. It's definitely not high level end game material though, which is what is needed now, thus the dissappointment.
---
Anytime. There‚Äôs very few spots that you probably won‚Äôt be attacked. The spot where my house is now, I‚Äôve been randomly attacked by ghouls twice in a couple weeks. It‚Äôs on the savage divide but it‚Äôs a pain to build in the spot.
---
Gave you an upvote for truth although you're going to be downvoted (and I will be as well). People are interpreting the criticism as a wish to see the game fail, which is not a correct understanding for a good deal of the criticism you see here. The criticism is because we want the game to succeed.  It's a very competitive GaaS environment out there and the longer BSG screws up on content releases like this, the faster the playerbase will decline.
---
And they‚Äôre even as BS as people expected
---
‚ÄúTake a photo of someone wearing sunglasses in a nuke zone‚Äù 
---
Fucking hell
---
Abraxo cleaner (def butchered that spelling)
---
&gt;urgh  oh yes let  me eat this shit more daddy
---
For a real challenge try it in survival mode!  With everyone going there it would probably be ridiculously hard.
---
Honestly it's been pretty good for a while in my opinion
---
Just be a master of every weapon but have 3 charisma.
---
Did you find the plans or were they mined?
---
It was worth buying at launch to me. I am a bit on edge about things like repair kits coming to the atom store, but all in all its a fun game to play. as always, your mileage may vary.
---
some people still complain about npc's though.
---
In my experience I played Xbox and pc with a Xbox remote  I would say xbox players are better
---
It's good now go ahead
---
It's day to day for me. Some days it's good, others I can't even play. What makes me mad is when I join a server where someone has my camp spot so I try to join another server and keep getting auto-disconnected from it.
---
THIS! Wasn't it ES:Oblivion that had players up in arms about meh dungeons that the team that created ES:Skyrim have varied and unique dungeons? I think they did a pretty good job there. Now wtf, did they forget all of this?
---
Bioware made the same mistake with Dragon Age 2 (story was good, 'dungeons/caves' were f'ing terrible.
---
Regardless, I thought the Glassed Cavern was great! I still run it from time to time just because...
---
It's sad that I, as well as most of you, could come up with something pretty awesome in a single day. Yet, these people get paid. For this. What's it going to take? Change in management? Do we need to pay for quality DLC? I don't give a shit, but just don't give us this shit. More effort please.
---
Should have - yes, but where I'm from should of is more the expression used. Call it slang or bad English, whatever floats your boat. Glad you had a laugh though. No one else cares ;)
---
But no beer hat? That's no challenge.
---
I thought that was the whole purpose of survival mode, so you could have some opponents of comparable gear and level and see who could be the awesomest of all...
---
Thank you. I mean people love to hate what makes them seem like they let the lesser one. 
---
BGS did/does what any business does. They got you to stick around or join and believe something and we/I fell for it. Do I think the burrow is bad. Yes but in a POV. 
---
The burrows are just a second golf club. But it serves as a template for searching and exploring the coming dungeons. Rewarding the player for that. I found over 200 pounds of scraps. Upwards of 20 legendary mobs. 
---
People are mad because they chose to get OP and now the game is easy. And by extension the burrows feel that way. 
---
But I digress. BGS did the right thing.
---
Datamined, just looked to see what required them in XEdit.
---
I have been playing the game since Christmas. I think the game has its ups and down. The amount of crashing/server lag just depends on the platform. I used to experience crashing but as time went on it became less frequent. Last crash I had was yesterday but I think it was just my Xbox being frustrating. 
---
I find the game fun but when you wander into the ‚Äúhigher‚Äù level area the fun is less. So far the micro transactions are all cosmetic. The camp system is a little frustrating because of some objects unwilling to place
---
And this has been my tedtalk
---
*Most * of the issues are fixed now. Safe to come in. But any issues you find? Yeah, sorry about that.
---
Otherwise, you should like it in here with the rest of us.
---
I don't usually respond to stuff like this but you get to be a special case.
---
1. Literally irrelevant to the conversation
---
2. They didn't, but the term "dungeon" tends to correspond to instanced content in other multiplayer games. Also that would have made this "dungeon" better since going through it after someone just cleared it is not a great experience.
---
3. OP was drawing parallels to other games that did do this kind of content well. You want a better comparison? Even the crap-shoot that is Anthem (an objectively worse game than fo76) did dungeons better
---
4. OP didn't say they wanted a mirelurk queen in the "dungeon". They said they wanted enemies that had better archetypes or mechanics and used the mirelurk queen as an example of an interesting enemy to fight.
---
5. No idea what you saw in the post that gave you this idea, but if Bethesda had looked at how WoW (or any MMO) does their dungeons, this one may not have been so bad.
---
I believe OP meant what legendary perks
---
So again you're saying we should **expect** Bethesda to lie to/mislead us and have no right to be upset when they do? Just want to clarify. Also there is more to the hype than just the trailer. They discussed it on the panel where they alluded to it being something epic when its not.
---
&gt; Either way free content! 
---
THIS!  
---
I don't get all the complaints, it's a small piece of content but it's content. More is coming in the future.
---
I think this may be an issue with skins bought from the atom shop. Not to long ago the red tactical headlamp was tagged with the atom symbol and could not be applied to PA until they patched it. Now I‚Äôm beginning to believe the vice versa applies. This problem didn‚Äôt occur until I recently picked up some PA skins from the atom shop and added them to my armor. Every piece now has the symbol to the right of the name and I‚Äôm unable to add mods. I‚Äôm going to test this
---
Playing on xbox1 and don't see an option to place it
---
Super mutants like to break my things every now and again
---
Honestly, game is out for almost half a year and there's pretty much barely any balance patches. 
---
A lot of perks are still are garbage. Many are wayyy outperforming others. 80% of gears are straight up lesser compared to unyield/cav. Melee still has like over 200% dmg modifiers while guns have none, etc. 
---
Good luck balancing game around insane build disparity.
---
yes i think we will still eventually have  real "sheepsquatch"
---
Different studio. This is ~~Battlecry~~ Bethesda Austin. They've not really done anything before this.   
---
The game also bombed hard and sales were NOT good. Mix with the initial hesitation to monitize the post purchase game and you have a team with very little $$$ to devote to development.   
---
If these "big" new quests are lame and short when compared to previous content, then they may be only putting them out in order to keep the game supported until they can shut it down without being sued. Though that's a pessimistic guess.
---
God damn being right is awesome.
---
Mind posting a screenshot of that?
---
it's the "A" button on xbox
---
Cola Nut my friend, Cola Nut.
---
Doesnt matter. You activated the event, so the recall card was used up. And the timer is calculated server side, so somebody on that new server likely did the event before you signed in.
---
This new quest was garbage but sheer terror was good add some godamn guns please
---
Eastern, American
---
Lol that bad huh? I haven't been on yet, probably wont have time till Friday. I'm sure itll calm down by then.
---
You're pushing the wrong button. Don't do that.
---
I was just discussing that with my buddy after leaving the burrows incredibly disappointed.
---
They've nerfed everything so bad its becoming a chore. Nerfed XP, nerfed drop rates, nerfed mat farming, nerfed spawn rates, nerfed the queen... hell i cant even craft and trade indefinitely because my cap limit is a nerf.
---
I just dont understand why. Theres no p2w, theres no point to it all. Theres no dlc they are trying to get you to buy.  They've essentially nerfed the fun now.
---
actually one of them gives you a mounted owlet (from the cork board quests)
---
Thanks for this! These are both more enjoyable than The Burrows
---
Don't offer help to the company that fucked up. Won't learn anything from it then.
---
Every time something new gets released in game, I cant get on until late at night due to the influx of players.
---
I ran across a female vault dweller on PS4 a few weeks ago called RosieNoShoes while joining a couple of SBQ fights.  She seemed like good people, and skilled.  Maybe give her a yell.
---
i can see why it is, there is no button prompt for it on the bottom of screen just to drop it.
---
must'n't
---
Yea it‚Äôs sad. I still don‚Äôt do bloodied just because everyone is doing it lol
---
That's kinda shitty. I work 50-60 hours a week. Only days I'm able to get on is Friday Saturday and Sunday so by then the new content isn't really to busy anymore lol.
---
My other favourite is when people show up and say
---
"I'm a Dev, this idea would be soooo easy to implement."
---
Sure you are bud. Sure you are.
---
I died, left, and it completed and i got The Gutter... I didn't even try
---
&gt; \#2. Pleasant Hills Cemetery
---
Just FYI, there's also a place where a magazine can spawn. It's right above the safe in the crypt.
---
It's your 'select' key, just like weapons or armor pieces when out of the PA. Drop is the X button. Dropping any modified parts or weapons destroys that particular modification. Think it leaves the part in original, unmodified state.
---
Pc
---
Same, I usually work 70-75 hours a week so being able to get on during the week is rare, even worse when I have the time and cant lol
---
I play nocturnal mostly
---
I would be ok with it if they went that way. However I think I prefer it the way it is. This way I can carry my tesla, a gauss and a handmade for different purposes without having to worry about swapping perks depending on my target.
---
Well the camera got delayed making these challenges impossible and the hardest to complete.
---
The trade-off to a powerful build is having about 20% health.  Granted you should be taking advantage of stealth to reduce being attacked and getting more damage.
---
Right now I am a Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacist noob and not a glass cannon build and I have no trouble with most content.  The Imposter Sheepsquatch loves targeting me though.
---
I have been doing my own theory crafting as of late for a build I want to transition into.  That means no more Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacist even though I am a hoarder.  Basically it uses Power Armor with Emergency Protocols, Overdrive Servos, Speed Demon, and Nerd Rage among other perks.  The thought is that it is an extremely fast and powerful build but not too squishy.
---
Thank you
---
Guess the fix wasn't in this update. Just new cash shop item....
---
Yup see Bethesda keeps fn up first they put out a barely playable game then mess up drop rates for parade and now giving us a good event but didn't take into account there would be 8 characters running around plus the 10 boots and sheepsquatch and all the lightning all is does it lag. Plus I was doing event after which my xo1 armor with prototype paint DID not respond on to my chassis. So I get robbed litterally all the way from them in many ways. I'm gonna never play a game from them again if they mess up 1 more time
---
Don't forget cryo for bosses
---
Darn, if your were on PS4 I‚Äôd go one a run with you to make that happen.
---
Been playing since launch I did this "dungeon" by myself and then said to myself, "that's it?" Uninstalled shortly after this was the last straw for me which is unfortunate cause I was looking forward to this.
---
I agree it‚Äôs not difficult, I spent about half an hour in there solo and it wasn‚Äôt challenging at all (level 108).
---
I really enjoyed it though, it‚Äôs a really fun layout to run around, there was plenty to kill and the loot was epic. I got 14 legendary drops including an instigating gause rifle with 25% faster reload and a 2 shot cryolator lol.
---
It opens the cage looking door. Someone must have opened it prior to you arriving.
---
Wow YES well said sir/madam
---
My friends bullets are scratching enemies, meanwhile I'm making them reconsider their existence with a fuckin ski
---
Rofl ya I feel that
---
Yeah, so, maybe you forgot how to read?
---
Remember that road map? It was pretty crystal clear that the content leading up to Wastelanders was going to be smaller portions of content, leading up to it. 
---
Wastelanders has a whole new main quest line, new factions,  new events etc. 
---
I don't get how people seem surprised that we're getting smaller doses of content leading up to a bigger more traditional DLC. 
---
Like this is some new wizardry that BGS is pulling.
---
Where? In the Burrows? I ran it first thing when it unlocked this morning and I was one-shotting them..
---
I agree, it was super cool area to explore and had interesting lore as well. I don‚Äôt understand the backlash it‚Äôs getting, as there is still much to come in Wild Appalachia.
---
You mean, like 95% of the game's locations? lol
---
No just in general when I was lvl 40 I was one to two shorting them but now it takes like three and I‚Äôm level 55
---
I agree. It wasn‚Äôt bad, the area was well designed, the story was interesting‚Äîalbeit too short‚Äîthe problem was that expectations were set unattainably high. 
---
It would have been better if it had just been a surprise. Maybe have some random corpses pop up around Appalachia that have notes about escaping the burrows, then a quest pops up to find out what happened. Another new place to explore in an evolving world. 
---
If it had been unannounced people would‚Äôve raved about it. I have a feeling that was the plan, but with delays to vending and the camera, perhaps they felt they needed to announce something.
---
Ugh. 
---
Wastelanders will feature a whole new main quest line, new factions, new events etc. 
---
Everyone just decided to forget the road map and just force their expectations on to content that BGS was very clear about?
---
Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have given us a heads up to prepare our characters or gather our squad...when its just a quest that could be done solo with zero stim packs.
---
Yep, I totally was feeling the Negan vibe
---
Correct, this is basically a slightly simplified version of the Aksis fight from WotM, which was kind of the point. I have faith in Bethesda's designers that 76 could *absolutely* punch in the same weight class as Destiny, but half-assed nonsense like the Burrows really gets in the way.
---
I didn't see any either. The boss at the end wasn't legendary either.
---
Watoga stealth Nerf. The weight death bug is still a problem since November.
---
Any screen grabs and recording of this behavior you can get. Look up Terms of Service for your console and Bethesda etc, at all levels they make it pretty straightforward to report someone for inappropriate behavior.
---
Looking past your team dynamics, you would be doing everyone a favor by removing a player who behaves like that from being able to harass others.
---
My sympathies for having put up with it this long, but hopefully you‚Äôll get some relief soon.
---
~~burn him~~ burn him BURN HIM
---
It's okay Hot Hats, terrible or not I still had a giggle.
---
It wasn't poorly managed. 
---
The road map was pretty crystal clear. People just jammed their expectations on to this content and the previous content. 
---
Depsite it being pretty basic shit. Smaller doses of content followed by a bigger more traditional DLC.
---
I am so on board with this
---
Swarm? I got one.
---
Those two accommodate two of the hotter builds right now. If you want to scratch the pvp itch then assassins gives you a head start. If your into the bloodied weapon, low health perk card mode in pve then unyielding rounds you out.
---
I run BOS armor myself after tracking down all the pieces I needed. Life is to short to try and run with every meta build. I rather be a Jack of all trades. Game isn't that tough especially after level 60. Sure, things can get sweaty but more or less it's a camp grind game. 
---
Last bit of advice and this is for everyone.  Don't worry about ahit until that legendary vendor comes out and we see how that works. That whole set up may make trading and selling on Ebay irrelevant.  If you can just stock up on tokens and eventually buy your armor I'm game.
---
OSRS and main game are literally packed with numerous different scams, commonly lures, more commonly GE price manipulation, trading a low value, skewed price items, for well over there common knowledge value. If it's too good to be true, it is.
---
You don't need the skill perks to install pre-made mods.  You only need it to craft mods.  Like others have said though, pre-made mods are broken right now.  Bethesda said they'll fix that in the next patch.
---
1. Bought it; 20k caps. Posted 'want to buy' for weeks before someone hooked me up. It's even got -25% VATS cost on it, which is super handy for short-range aiming.
---
2. I didn't say they said that, I said it *should* be.
---
3. Because production quality and a little forethought into their content, which Bethesda should be well and truly capable of.
---
4. I'm giving it as an example of an enemy with interesting fight mechanics, other than 'pew pew pew dead'.
---
5. I know. When I want to play WoW, I play WoW. I'm just saying in terms of production quality and basic gameplay elements.
---
Furious 2 shot, if it even exists? lol. 
---
Tse is good but hazardous to your health at close range. 
---
If you have a bloodied build, please ignore all of the above.
---
I don't know if I feel they did the "right thing" but if you explain the burrows as something the devs did to mislead players into staying with the game longer I can understand that business model. I just feel its a shame BGS might think that is what is necessary when they've clearly got some incredibly talented environment modelers and so on. If only they spent more time fleshing out the mechanics possibly creating a new event even the burrows could have been so much more.
---
I‚Äôll give it a 6-7/10 overall. Very simple, but I really enjoyed the area itself. Gave me fallout 4 vibes (reminded me of some of the raider camps and subterranean areas) and the music and lighting were awesome as well. Not much story unfortunately
---
Your build doesn't remotely require anything good or even near one-shotting potential to make this "dungeon" easy...
---
It's a bunch of ghouls which are weak as can be, and then a handful of robots. A level 30 player wouldn't have much issue with this dungeon.
---
Now you're getting it!
---
I found the golf club at white springs harder. The ghouls can gang up on you in that building if you don't watch out. With the new dungeon the ghouls are spread out so they just trickle in to fight you.
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be corrected tomorrow
---
Also if you fail they set off a nuke in a random part of the map? Although I guess that's incentive to fail
---
Posted it hoping it'd help somebody! 
---
There are a few good threads where all the information is collectively held but they tend to get buried.
---
You didnt even read their inside the vault. Because they clearly did.
---
They‚Äôve confirmed it‚Äôll be returning next year but I completely agree
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/vesti-iz-ubezhisha-ot-4-aprelya-2019-goda-chto-budet-posle-vosmogo
---
Read it for yourself.
---
&gt; If it had been unannounced people would‚Äôve raved about it. I have a feeling that was the plan, but with delays to vending and the camera, perhaps they felt they needed to announce something. 
---
That would make sense, I think it was partly needing to be hyped. A lot of the expectation was built by the community and I expect the reaction has taken them by surprise.   
---
Dropping things in unannounced would be clever, and then there's the buzz about always new content that's to be discovered. That way it keeps the feeling that there's always something in the game you've not come across, and allows it to appear gradually.  
---
Even putting stuff out in no mans land, there's enough people in the community for those things to be discovered organically and for everyone to gradually find out about them.
---
Wait, was this like 4 hours ago? I think I hopped into your server for a few seconds
---
/r UnexpectedFinale
---
This is how I built my rifle/shotgun power armor build. Hope this helps or at least provides a little inspiration.
---

---
Harpers ferry, there‚Äôs pothole covers that you can walk up to and enter
---
That's extremely helpful, thank you!
---
Now having played it -
---
I didn't think it was hard, but the end battle with the robots is comparable to arguably the most difficult solo scenario in the main quest, clearing a missile silo.  The sheer number of armor-piercing Colonel Gutsys ensures that.  They intended for multiple players to run a missile silo, so by their standards, this is hard.
---
Alright thanks
---
Something about 4hrs, yes
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Theres nothing you can do its gone forever
---
Lol the fucking posts coming out of the woodwork saying you expected it to be instanced when they literally never said it would be.
---
What's the best place to farm them?
---
Wait, does nuking Harper's Ferry affect the Burrows? I didn't think it could affect internal structures.
---
I just got lucky. I went in right as is opened, on a survival server. Had the whole thing to myself brand new. It was pretty, short, but pretty.
---
Honestly the best part was the 2 level 200's who tried to jump me.
---
Check near the Armory in Harpers Ferry. Theres a manhole in the road.
---
&gt; TSE pump shotgun build.
---
&gt; I wasn't so much as touched the whole time.
---
Were you expecting something different, or...?
---
Even with enemies there were only like 15 ghouls (lvl 60) it‚Äôs not even a dungeon
---
When using the shotgun a lot I sometimes switch concentrated fires for skeet Shooter
---
No sir, either a regular or chain wrapped Baseball Bag. It‚Äôs called his Rat Basher, he had a regular bat but the Gang gives him a chain wrapped one in Charlie Kelly: King of the Rats
---
Actually it always affect internals
---
People are saying it‚Äôs the sheepsquatch but I still don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting too close yet. I think we‚Äôll be seeing a new creature before that, maybe some crazy porcupine/other animal hybrid mutation that shoots armor piercing projectiles
---
The door you use it on is the first gate you encounter. It has a big red light on it.
---
I'm not sure you're doing anything wrong.  I've just come to accept that CAMP turrets are unreliable and weird.  They often won't fire on the thing that's right in front of them.
---
Tried it myself. 
---
There were definitely a lot of bloated glowing ones down there after nuking Harper's.
---
I've played since beta, I've always enjoyed it even when it was buggy as hell but most of the stuff is ironed out. Its worth the buy
---
How do I craft a new one?
---
&gt; The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone. 
---
&gt; Collect your gear, call your squad together, and delve into The Burrows to find out what happened to its inhabitants and uncover what‚Äôs behind those mysterious electronic signatures the Brotherhood of Steel found underground. 
---
That kind of reads like it'll be more significant.
---
What quests did you do to get these, and where do you start them? I knew nothing of them, or I'd have done them. I can hop on and give them a go and let'cha know what happens.
---
I went into the burrows alone with a non-legendary combat shotgun and no damage perks. It was a reasonable challenge. I went through a good bit of healing items, almost died a few times. Overall very fun
---
Not sure why people are going in with bloodied super sledges and tse shotguns and power armor expecting to fight for their life
---
Is it fairly easy to rebuild if you level up enough or would you recommend me just starting a new character?(I'd rather not if I don't have to)
---
Never mind, turns out those plans weight 0 unlike the others
---
Haha you‚Äôre probably right ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
For me it wasn't legendary or even a crowned mob, it was just a level 46 assaultron.
---
When they took TSE down to 25% I was hoping they would continue fixing effects with each update. Mutant's, junkie's, etc are absolutely worthless at the moment.
---
That worked! Thanks everybody. I almost gave up on this game... again
---
I found them, I was filtering for weight like I always do but they weight 0 unlike the other plans and that's why I didn't see them. 
---
These are the quests https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdwn6f/two_new_quests_with_the_burrows_update_mounted/
---
Pretty sure I was in your server then. Can't imagine many people already trying to nuke this on PC
---
Solo is the only way I've launched since level 85. 20-25 minutes a run, not using anything special either. A tse 2* combat shotgun, a 1* Furious sledge and a 1* Furious combat rifle, fully modded excavator pa.
---
We need some real end game content.
---
I feel like that‚Äôs gonna be the last thing on the roadmap for this year. The one that has the description of all new main story quests.
---
I'm glad they are postponing things that aren't done yet, means they have realized that quality is more important than quantity. However, considering how some of the daily and weekly challenges today were camera-related and you can't even get the camera until next week I feel kind of discouraged when they can't even get the postponing right and check so the challenges have been moved too.
---
Agree with that. It's a marketing fault, I feel sorry for the folks that made it, as I think the marketing folk have shot them in the foot.    
---
Just adding it without the fanfare would have made it some decent content.  
---
I'm not angry, just disappointed.
---
Don't know anything specific off the top of my head, but anything that's "low risk" here will suddenly become high risk because everybody will start flooding to those spots
---
Indeed. Sometimes "Trickle content" works out that you can continuously play, but in this case you're only logging in for small bits of disparate content that I assume will feel a lot more substantial if one just waits until it's all out.
---
This makes me think of how Everquest tried to make moving boats that sailed from one side of the map to the other. They got it to sort of work ;-)
---
Then again, it felt like every other time you took the boat you got stranded on some random island.
---
P.S. The only way to enter and leave the zone at that time was the boat, lol... Oh, the memories!
---
They are new, not sure if there's a use for them. I didn't find any new recipes down there
---
1000 pounds?  Do you have no weight reduction perks on anything?
---
&gt; boros
---
You‚Äôre already cool to me :)
---
&gt; holy grail of TSE
---
Most people bought theirs for 5k or less during the height of duping. I'm honestly surprised that not everyone has one.
---
Which may have been true if it was a private experience. We had to bloodied explosive asshats come through on a speed run after 7 server hops to find a silent  Harpers Ferry. They knew the place, damn near one shotted everything, looted and left the server within a few minutes. Left us with a bunch of meat piles and scrap. Good times.
---
Never drop, always trade!
---
I didn't expect the twelve-minute stroll in the park.
---
Thanks. I'll check these out. So I take it you found your missing plans then?
---
Juicehead talks about it in his most recent video and confirms that it is affected by nukes. Excited to test it out myself!
---
What does the vanguard/cavalier/marine  armor do for a build?
---
Yeah pretty much my sentiment. Pretty short and not too difficult if you are high level with good gear, but that's the intent. This is currently one of the hardest dungeons in the game, and much more easily accessible than a nuke silo or sheepsquatch fight. I may also be a bit biased because I found a bloodied handmade with increased speed and damage while aiming down sights down there
---
Cool. Thanks
---
Awesome. Glad you found them ‚ò∫
---
Sweet
---
Lol.
---
As far as I've seen, Bethesda considers any interior with enemies and loot inside it to be a dungeon.
---
I love everything about this.
---
its a level 9 character that Im using just for this, or was.
---
That's nice!
---
I am not sure, I don't think it is
---
Yeah, we should have, but it was just so many items.
---
Should be under quest items in the Tinkers Workbench. Dunno what you need exactly. I know there‚Äôs a part you have to buy for 2000 caps from a vendor but thats the extent of my knowledge
---
cross your fingers and wait till the next ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù
---
Chill mate......take a few breaths before your next post...
---
On the bright side, at least you‚Äôre already at the toilet when you shit yourself.
---
What about the masks!?! Lol
---
it‚Äôs honestly kinda sad that for most people, that‚Äôs a *best* case scenario. i wanna get my hopes up for something like that but i don‚Äôt wanna get my heart broken again :(
---
I just got done running it and got 5 or 6 legendaries. Some of them dropped off of enemies that weren‚Äôt marked legendary. Nothing special though, quad railway rifle, and some wood armor etc... dropped item levels varied from 30-50.  In level 135 and believe I was in there alone. 
---
One odd note - ALL enemies were robots, not ghouls which is different than when I ran it earlier today.
---
For what it's worth, the quest ends when you read the terminal.  The Encryptid event is optional, and you can do it anytime someone starts the event when you're on the same server.  The server sends out a server-wide notification that the event is starting.
---
I had all ghouls.
---
Yeah. I mean I‚Äôm not sad because I do enjoy the dungeon the times I‚Äôve been through it. It‚Äôs short but it is fun if yours is filled with enemies. The lore is actually good there too.
---
Do stand so close
---
if you run power armor then fireproof perk if you run normal armor then get padded or dense mod for your chest peice
---
i gotta be honest and ask. how the fuck did they mess up the camera challenges? surely SOMEBODY had to see it before it came out
---
Marsupial helps to gain distance, be careful you're not aiming to close to the ground too
---
Dickenstein, why are you carrying your armor and clothes above your head?
---
Always. Trade. Always.
---
Marsupial Jump while you‚Äôre shooting. You won‚Äôt feel a thing.
---
The masks, the doughnuts, the fact you can ***~~EAT THE INTESTINES OF YOUR ENEMIES~~*** rename weapons
---
Cough cough anthem...
---
Seems to me you are screwed.
---
I can't cross my fingers. I'm busy playing fallout looking for something to bitch about.
---
I can build your C.A.M.P. shop for you if you use XBox.
---
Are you online? Just getting on now and have very little time
---
honestly i feel like it wouldn‚Äôt have been as disappointing if they didn‚Äôt hype it up like this big dungeon when it could easily be beaten in 5 minutes without breaking a sweat.
---
Seriously....take a break mate.   Ease up a little and relax.
---
Don't use it at close range? :P
---
Otherwise Dense torso mod + Fireproof perk. You may also need Adamantium Skeleton if you don't want your limbs broken.
---
It seems like they hyped it because their advertisers are smarter than their dev's. An advertising agency knows how to sell a product.
---
I did it with x-1 and all rise by myself.
---
The fact that you're referring to "Construction Set" and not "Creation Kit" tells me you haven't touched any of these tools in so long that your opinion isn't particularly relevant.
---
I encountered this too, but thought it had to do with the legs being lvl 50.
---
Tfw my camp is on the bridge leaving Harper's :(
---
its is absolutely not nit-picky to comment that the new content is fairly weak
---
Boxed mods are fucked right now.
---
I love everything about this post
---
Still after the update too. :( I just want a purple headlamp for my quantum armor.
---
I'm thinking about the masks that didn't drop for anyone
---
Having played a ton of BGS RPGs, the Bethesda definition of "dungeon" is pretty much any interior that includes enemies and loot. People shouldn't be surprised that's all the Burrows are.
---
Nuke burrows. Becomes awesome farming location. BGS still got our back.
---
Yes!!
---
Played all day and didn't experience any crashes, what are your specs lol
---
I literally just got off
---
Given the history of the game and balance, they will just nuke nerf everything, and remove the melee modifier.
---
You say it like they ruined the experience for you. Who cares about a few cosmetics? Besides there'll be another Fasnacht next year, they might up the chances then
---
I never finished the quest, as I disconnected very soon after reading the terminal, and never got the rewards.
---
You don't deserve to lose karma over this, take my upvotes
---
Here, you need not lose karma for this too, take an upvote
---
You definitely don‚Äôt have to start a new character. Im lvl  230 and have completely respected my character 3 times now, and on top of that I have 67 unused perk points from leveling. It‚Äôs is defiantly easy enough to grid out levels and perks points to respec however you want without having to start over.
---
I did it at level 99 alone.
---
You dont need flux to attach mods idk why they have it there and yes mods are still bugged
---
What my TSE one shot everything in the dungeon. God Bethesda must be so bad at game making /s
---
I did this too.  But I also gathered three one-star legendary wood armor pieces.
---
I love the game and play almost everyday, but I don't defend blatant failures. Definitely did not ruin anything but it is a disappointment.
---
Bet since its free atoms we are stuck with impossible challenges cough kill glowing creature during radstorm. The rest of the week dailies better not be camera related or help us all.
---
I haven't been able to add friends for months now. Game is just filled with bugs
---
Insult. Ive been telling people in discord they started adding quests and dungeons. Biv is literally like 2 minutes a day, the new "dungeon" is 3 minutes solo with  a walking dead NEGAN  impersonation story line. The new quest chain is a few hours admittedly, however its a 4th graders goosebumps novel.
---
Without clothes? Think about the smell, you haven‚Äôt thought of the smell you bitch!
---
&gt; We all look like we're staring off into space
---
I died laughing
---
Bethesda seems unwilling to take outside help with FO76. But hey, someone else who actually realizes Zenimax and BGS are different even if one owns the other.
---
A similar thing happened to me and a friend a week ago (dropped stuff into a container, swapped to alt, we both got kicked and auto-reconnected). Did lose all the stuff in the container (nothing valuable really, mostly chems and ammo), but not the stuff we had traded.
---
No-one wanted to believe me that this is a new anti-exploit mechanism, but you experiencing the same thing makes it much more likely. The auto-reconnect never happens after a regular (random) disconnect, so there definitely is something at work here. I think it's meant to prevent duping, but it also makes muling harder now.
---
It's gonna be real classy, too
---
&gt; not using anything special either.
---
&gt; A tse 2* combat shotgun
---
???
---
You mad genius...
---
I know! I only got 7 legendaries!!
---
I also left it at gathering the ingredients to make Nukashine. I imagine the quest is gone for you too.
---
Ooh, I like that idea
---
if you're on Xbox ill be happy to give you some legendary gear
---
YOU ARE AN I.D.I.O.T
---
Whenever there's an overwhelming reaction to something, it means there is some truth to the claims being thrown out. I didn't read that many people saying the sheepsquatch is too hard. The most popular posts were of people saying that the event isn't worth it and has awful rewards (and that others players should activate the pylons), which is true. 
---
The burrow was marketed as a "dungeon", the first time such a name was used to describe a location in 76. Naturally, people should expect it to be pretty challenging. All it ended up being is a location that looks cool, has a below average story and is a joke when it comes to difficulty. 
---
So, I see no problem in criticizing Bethesda for it. I don't need to play it "for a few days" to make a valid judgment about this.
---
It's easy to come back plus get exp for your levels I don't see the bad side. Just don't play survival mode it's too punishing for hoarders/rich people.
---
Bethesda needs to stop hiring unemployed Disney dev's. What a joke this task is.
---
That one actually is doable, even if the circumstance for it is extraordinarily rare. 
---
These challenges actually are impossible since they rely on an item that isn't implemented into the game and won't be for a week.  This seems like incompetence on the devs' part. There seriously wasn't one person who said "Guys, maybe we should change those challenges since we have delayed the implementation of the thing needed to complete them"?
---
Who gets completely naked before sitting on the toilet?
---
By level 150, you probably should have figured out how your build works
---
Fastest way to grind levels in your opinion that's fairly easy? Also you don't use perks that reduce weight of junk/food etc..?
---
This sounds all well and good... until you remember that lower level players can stumble across the higher level players in areas with enemies already spawned in, meaning that lower level player will get his or her skull kicked in for merely being in the wrong place at the wrong time. How do you propose they balance that?
---
It's actually rather easy, you just have to find places to farm them safely. I'm already at 2/5, this should be the first Survival challenge I'll finish. Does anyone know what The Guarantee is yet?
---
Or did they? All the old impossible challenges whats more non free atoms lol?
---
I had a good time on my 72 melee character. Wasn't sweating bullets by any means, but definitely had some close calls. 
---
I think The Burrows would be perfect for people that are low 40's or fresh level 50's.
---
u/nutsupreme is correct. Plans require flux and other materials. Mods however show you what you'd need if you had the plans. Plans don't exist for X01 armor modifications as of yet. So  you most likely are trying to install a mod, which  u/nutsupreme was correct about again, in that mods are broken at the moment.
---
And I have to move my camp now.
---
RIP my camp. :(
---
I think the problem is its free atoms so why put work into fixing that when they make no $ out of it which is sad.
---
Its not really special. There are plenty of weapons more powerful. Its used specifically for passing the mainframe cores because you can blast racks at once, not the robots.
---
Also, thanks for the downvote lol
---
Ugh thanks for the awesome news !
---
I mean we still have the Arktos Farma Dungeon
---
I ran into lots of high level ghouls. Multiple three stars. I also had them spawn in behind me. Only level 52 though. Lots of 60 + irradiated ghouls.
---
Nope we are on pc but thank you for the offer.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm wanting the most, you could almost build a scare maze with some of these mounts
---
This comes down once again to a failure on Bethesda‚Äôs part to manage expectations. The words ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù and ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù being used in the same breath lead people to expect a certain level of difficulty. Had they advertised this as a new area rather than a ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù then I doubt people would be this disappointed.
---
Regarding ESO, that would add some flavor, but it would also dramatically drop the challenge/bullet sponginess of the higher tier areas.  It would be about 4 seconds from engage to looting of anything outside a world boss/dungeon encounter in ESO for me when I left.
---
Were you able to mod it?
---
Ahaha somebody tried that to see if they could turn their crops into flux. It didn't work
---
Lmao "it's easy to get lost". You don't mean... Like it would be irl?
---
I used a pipe rifle and wood armor.
---
Still easy guys.
---
Aw but this would require actual work, like modelling and scripting.
---
What you'll be fed in the upcoming months or years are the very basic of content like a new 2-3 script event and a ton of atom shop models.
---
where the fuck is this straw man? you looking at a scarecrow?
---
I like your ideas,but unfortunately they would require competent programmers.I don't think Bethesda has any of those working on this project.
---
Lol thought this was a troll post but it kept going and going....
---
I think you nailed it in one of your comments, half ass work from Bethesda! I mean did they even try? The design of the burrows was pretty cool I thought. I kept expecting something more! I looked around for 45 minutes after I completed the quest, searching for some hidden clue or something!!! They really dropped the ball on this and it feels like they just rushed through to put out something they could call ‚Äúnew content‚Äù.
---
Its great that we have dataminers giving players this information, but is there any info on legendary spawns
---
for each of the \*areas\* on the map? Some areas spawn more legendaries than others, and its not just because of the sheer numbers of enemies there. There is a pattern of behaviour here, and maybe its due to every major area on the map being \*seeded\* somehow in their code. Just like all the other players, I've had nothing from the bots in Watoga in the last few days, whereas in the last 3 months I have had 100's legendary drops including at least 20 3-star weapons and armor. About 2 months ago, the Robco building opposite the General's Steakhouse also had 3-star legendary spawns almost every time I went there, but that also ended abruptly. Now Harper's Ferry is hot. 
---
Why would they do this? They are \*rotating\* the areas to make the game less predictable. If they nerf one area, then they start spawning them in another area to compensate. As soon as players realise this they start farming these new areas.
---
Not junk or food as I keep all my junk in my stash and don‚Äôt really carry that much food as it is easy to get when you run low. My fastest way of grinding levels is farming at west tech. I just serve hop and run it over and over. Killing all the super mutants gives you tons of experience. They also drop tons of stimpaks, caned dog food, 5.56 ammo, and you will encounter lots of legendary enemies as well.
---
Weird, I remember paying $60 for the game and all future content.
---
This "content" is a joke. Defending it and Bethesda at at this point is showing you are literally incapable of looking at the game from any other standpoint other than your view from underneath Todd Howard's ballsack
---
What exactly do you mean by OP build? You mean the common cards that everyone can get that increase you damage done and reduce damage taken? Because that's all it takes to clear this without any issues.
---
I have been, at least until Bethesda realizes that a full priced game should have content to justify the price.
---
Ok then quad ammo is good with scorch killer (30% bonus damage) with also the 50% damage booster since it has a higher accuracy at close/medium range. Put in 2 shot after you will be golden assuming rng Jesus is on your side here.
---
Hnggg you lucky bastard. I've logged roughly 650 hours and still haven't found a single legendary handmade or combat rifle... Plenty of 3* walking canes and wooden armour though... Recently got a 3* lever action rifle though which made me happy :)
---
It‚Äôs as if Bethesda game studios has no say over how zenimax chooses to divide spending ü§î and it‚Äôs as if one game wouldn‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) pull the funding from everything else and monopolize the whole of the company ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
Its being mentioned in other threads you can do it perfectly fine with regular lv 50 gear.
---
Which I'm inclined to believe as I breezed through the game with literally nothing killing me.
---
Haven't really played any of the new content yet. Tried one time at Sheer Terror died a billion times and have no real interest in trying again.  Same with this one.  I'll do like when a new restauraunt opens up in town don't go until 4 months later when the rush is over. Whitesprings is nice when new content is released.
---
When everything lines up, and then the crash happens, yeah been there too, and I am sorry. Just got to hold on to the idea, nay the promise that 76 will get better. Slowly and surely I expect improvement, the franchise has too much at stake to lose on this front. Just my hopefully inspirational opinion.
---
That...is...awesome!!! Do they get paid in caps or carrots??
---
Yeah that assaultron got one shot :(
---
I don't. +shotgun damage in Str, Enforcer in Agil, Gunsmith, dog food, and the rest I could not tell you off the top of my head.
---
I've played online multplayers my whole life. I'm a grown man. But I literally almost punched my wall and cried from pure anger.
---
The only suggestion I can give at the moment is trading a blank unmodified chest piece and the mod, for an already modified piece. Problem is, most people with them already on are using them anyway. Hell, I've got a jetpack and calibrated shocks just waiting for my X-01. As mods. *sigh*
---
Tomato, non-tomato.
---
gt is soureststraws
---
3/10
---
I am convinced that there is 0 communication between the teams at Bethesda studios
---
Good lord my CAMP is going to be a mess haha
---
Hello Neighbor, I love that train with all the rad barrels, great mutation farming spot. And the amount of water purifiers i have is obscene. I managed to build up to the bridge you might want to try it makes running to harpers faster.
---
I saw 1 3 star ghoul after I finished is and was wandering around, and I got various bad legendaries from enemies that weren‚Äôt legendary
---
So everyday for 6 days do we get 6 different deathclaw easter eggs to get the mascot head?
---
Lol
---
Would you sell the xO1 Jetpack for caps?
---
Yeah, been there too, and usually from less than what you described. Sometimes it's best to just walk away, or change plan and just slaughter something? 
---
Usually when I get that mad I go to Whitesprings, walk the loop and get a half dozen or more legendaries, and then tele down to Watoga to sell them off, thankfully don't really have to do that so much, the tele part.
---
Don't let it get the best of you, it's not worth your mental real estate!
---
yea
---
This near exact thing happen to me &amp; my partner &amp; I have played daily since. Almost three months now. There are good players &amp; people in the FO76 world. Awesome story. Thanks for sharing!
---
I'm on Xbox one and I'm at 52. I was finally going to the course to look for legendaries. I lost so much stuff on that death omg it's discouraging.
---
I love the idea. I wouldn't mind seeing physical changes for not only this but other perks too like speed demon and marsupial
---
You don‚Äôt need the quest one to craft new ones, all you need is the plan and the materials, making the lvl 30 one you get as the quest reward completely obsolete once you have the plans.
---
Anyone who does this is just straight up trash.
---
I don‚Äôt destroy it I just lower everything so one shot will destroy them
---
I‚Äôm assuming this happened To you if so srry
---
Toxic joes place west of Berkeley springs go down the hill to a camp site and it should lead from there
---
Hahah every damn time
---
üòÄ
---
May be even more evil than myself haha you got the right idea
---
To play a little devil's advocate, they've called every cave system (in Skyrim at least) and building (Fallout 4 comes to mind) a "dungeon" regardless if it is or isn't. So by them calling it a "dungeon" it's misleading in an MMO sense, but not a Bethesda sense
---
If by happened to me you mean I did this to someone‚Äôs camp outside ws then yes
---
Is that actually a thing though ? I've looted a couple 70%+ just these last few days
---
Nope. There's too much of that in gaming... and in real life.
---
also applies if you're level 100+ tbh.
---
In op‚Äôs defense, you can deal much higher numbers of damage without legendary guns at all. I can slam them shits with a pipe rifle.
---
I rocked wood armor and a pipe auto rifle and beat the place in 10 mins without getting hit once.
---
Never even considered it.  A serious character flaw in the people who do this.
---
You just walk anywhere near the damn place and Sanjay will happily let you about both this and that Steelheart is fully charged and ready for action and if you're in Morgantown, go and activate him so he can check the alarms on the stash rooms and make sure he doesn't take too much damage (Sanjay's got enough repair work as it is)
---
Someone did so earlier today and it was fantastic. I don't know if it was out of frustration or out of a desire to see if the Burrows ghouls could be made to glow, but either way, it was some of the best farming for violet flux I've ever seen. So many flash ferns everywhere! With the super duper perk, I walked away with a staggering 23 stable violet fluxes at the end!
---
Well there you go buddy. I didn't bother with Whitesprings until in my 70s. Moreover I didn't even know about the excavator until past 40. I took things so slowly I suppose that it left me OP more often than not.  
---
Some spots in Whitesprings I have found lvl 91 mobs. Some spots you can be swarmed by a dozen or more. It's a no joke kind of place.
---
Again sorry it was not so cool the first time. Eventually you will be running it as a place to blow off steam. Just let it go for now, like I said, not worth the real estate.
---
Yaya. I had to do a reaaaallllyyy specific search using Google, but it found me your post. Thanks once again.
---
Instigating fat man with limb damage. There is a Bethesda article with all of the rewards listed.
---
I have the long barrel mod
---
At least its all free and you gotta actually participate in this egg hunt
---
Maybe why I always try to hide my CAMPS
---
When and where is this egg hunt?
---
You got the right idea
---
Thanks, that is what I was thinking, but I was afraid I was missing something.  So I'll scrap it to save 13 lbs of storage then :)
---
That's completely fair, I just don't think anybody should be using a TSE shotgun as a measure of how difficult a game can be
---
He has to be red, they won't shoot at tamed creatures either. Pacifist off and engage. He's wanted so you can land the first hit.
---
Its the free eggs from the shop its like an egg hunt
---
Lulz
---
I‚Äôm using it to entice any trade for the BOS leg plan. I really want that plan. Maybe if I get lucky and get the plan by other means and have the jet pack mod still, then definitely I will sell the jet pack mod.
---
I killed just the final bosses. Everything else was meat piles. Sigh.
---
Are you 12?
---
5 minutes? Do you motherfuckers take any time to explore the area, or just rush from one blip to the next? I'll admit it the "quest" is underwhelming, but there's a ton of fucking junk to scavenge and several terminals and whatnot to read.
---
yes they do though?
---
For high health builds, any piece with Sentinal is worth keeping. You can mix/match sentinal and weight reduction pieces if you're doing strictly PvE. I have a full sentinal set, but it's mixed BOS, with 2 unyielding, 2 bolstering, and 1 chameleon piece.
---
Vanguard is good to start, as it gives the same bonuses that unyielding gives, only for high health.
---
Some really cool places that you can hide CAMPS. Under the surface sometimes, or incorporating existing structures. Maybe off in the mountains, or on a little island, caves are neat and so are subterranean locations, I use that loosely.
---
Mods not working
---
I haven't done the burrows yet, but as I understand it they are instanced, so one person nukes it and everyone can have they're own score of ghouls below?
---
All this talk of instanced and I still have no idea what it means xD
---
ive been looking for some people to link up with since my friends don't really like the game. still have room my guy?
---
They should really amp it up. People would still complain. If they made it harder, people would bitch that it's too hard. I would make it mandatory to have 4 people to start the dungeon. Ramp up all the creatures to 68 or 70 and double the amount.
---
We'll call him...Mharg. And he'll just be a monochromatic reskin of Grahm because Bethesda loves reusing assets.
---
Yea as long as you have the plans no sense in holding on to the quest reward one.
---
I hate how this - no matter what - got my friends and me a little hyped wondering whether it WAS secretly implemented after all. :c
---
My roof makes contact with the bridge and can hop up quickly that way. Can also build atop The bridge, have a little camp for people up there
---
Game got an update that somehow neglected to fix the repair big.
---
Desk fans/typewriters are a godsend. Binoculars are the poots. Also Bowie knives, which is sad since they're near looking.
---
He was red and the turrets continued to ignore him even as his bounty increased by breaking stuff. I could of landed 1st hit but I was bulking and had a boatload of junk on me.  And weapons stored.  Too much time to transfer everything while he was trashing the place so I logged out.
---
It was always good, but rare as most people only nuke White Springs or occasionally Fissure Prime
---
No, because I was weaned before I was 12. You have a couple more good years on the teat, enjoy them because you'll never see any ever again.
---
In the fallout wiki, says about the creator of jet "Myron discovered that the slaves harvesting the drugs were in a constant state of intoxication from inhaling the fumes." So totally make sense people did that back then. Jet is still a synthesized drug
---
I ate one and nothing happened except I got a few rads.
---
i want it, robbie!!
---
The new dungeon is hollow and lacks content or a challenge. Weapon and armor modifications cannot be installed still. End game content is imaginary. Doesn't stop me from playing, but sure is sour.
---
Thanks
---
They work for free üòÇü§£üòÜ I inspire them!
---
So all the Raiders from all the Fallout games?
---
Its this reddit sub for Both.
---
I've heard a lot of just depressing shit rolling downhill with 76. Hopefully by the 1 year anniversary it will be somewhat worth playing
---
If bethesda allows players to get builds that do an insane amount of damage, they should balance enemies to be up to that level. The idea that a dungeon balanced for two players at level 50 is end game is laughable for a game that's been released for this long.
---
It's fun as fuck
---
Yes thank you!
---
That 200 hours isn't a huge number for an online game.
---
I just did the one starting at the Southern Belle Motel and one-shot the wendigo when it came out, then it sank underground so I couldn't get the loot.
---
If you run this, let him come out further so you don't lose the loot.
---
I cant find the paper at the Southern Belle Motel.  
---
Is that a one per lobby like the stupid Nuka Cola Quantum armor quest?
---
My only disappointment is when the game freezes.
---
I don't have either of them and this game is no challenge.
---
Do not think so. Have you checked those patio tables?
---
That damn drill.... what in the F would I use that for
---
Waiiiiiiiiit, you wouldn't happen to be on xbox would you?
---
This has been posted many times
---
thanks for the link.
---
Lol were you that lvl 80ish right outside ws
---
Good point...
---
If you ever want to sell it or drop it, you will have to just paint it back to original.
---
they're not. It just like new cave with ghouls under HF
---
I really think it should, as TSE shotguns are one of the more lackluster variants of shotguns.
---
Without perks, a TSE Pump has awful spread, bad explosive damage, and about 130 damage. With perks this goes up to around 200.
---
My pipe rifle does 34 damage, and with sneak I hit for 85. Combine that with being able to dish out Vats Crits and shots in vats 3x faster, and I‚Äôm out dpsing the Shotgun.
---
It‚Äôs much kore efficient on a handmade, as they oneshot Charred ghouls in Sneak.
---
TSE pumps aren‚Äôt just a look and laser gun anymore, they‚Äôre much harder to use than something like an AAE, and they both require aim, and shots to be hit on target, not to mention that there are several effects at this point that are flat out better than TSE, not to mention that they‚Äôre total shit in PvP anyhow.
---
I DIDNT ASK
---
I mean Im lvl 155 but im at the snake in ws
---
Fucking what the fucking fuck bruh.
---
You mad?
---
I mean, yeah, they are pretty clearly trash people
---
Oh no was not you I don‚Äôt think the dude that killed me was lvl 84 I had on the t60 with the jet pack
---
The only time I was marked wanted from camp pvp is caused by my stray bullets. I was trying to be a hero killing scorchbeast that was eating the camp &amp; the bullets from my gatling somehow found their way to the wall. That was before the patch 5 I *think*
---
Furious is fairly good if you‚Äôre expecting to take 8+ bullets to kill your target, bloodied is untouchable if you‚Äôre already running a bloodied build. Instigating oddly enough is about equal to furious until shot 6ish.
---
I heard next update should have the pacifist thing where it extends to the camp.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I mean this is the point to use your TwoShot Fatman, right?
---
I remember those days I hid from an assaultron in some dudes camp and ended up with a 80 cap bounty by accident from spraying bullets lol
---
Quote my bro, "This assumes there are play testers."
---
Ah right, I kinda just got killded my a guy on survival so i fucked off to do a challenge. When I got back, BOOM!
---
I mean if you read the backstory on some of the Raider gangs like the one from the Pitt DLC or the random encounter in fallout 4 where 2 Raiders are burying their friend they honestly seem to be normal people that went down a dark path.
---
I can only imagine what that‚Äôd do to someone‚Äôs camp jeez I used a bloodied sledge hammer
---
I got 7 legendary drops (all sucked) and the ghouls kept respawning. I didn‚Äôt think it was too bad. Same grind just different location. I don‚Äôt know what everyone was complaining about. I‚Äôll go back and grind those legendaries
---
And boom goes the dynamite lol
---
(What does instanced mean?)
---
I was curious because I always carry a shit load of food, water and chems with me like stims, rad x and radaway. It's just been my nature since I've started playing Fallout in general. My theory better to be safe than sorry lol.
---
Some, I assume, are good people.
---
Wolf event maybe.
---
Yea, nothin but frames and broken crops.
---
The challenge is there. It's called PvP in survival.
---
Block everyone for sedan, problem probably solved!
---
But in all seriousness just sneak forever, I held several workshops the other day for close to 6 hours before I got DC'd and I was just crouch walking everywhere
---
3 always spawn between overseers camp and flatwoods
---
I wish Bethesda would just add Raider NPCs that will begin attacking everyones camps.
---
Everyone with camps near Harper's Ferry:
---
People who know the meta farming strats: Nuking Harper's Ferry is the best way to kill lots of glowing ones.
---
Everyone with camps near Harper's Ferry: *surprised Pikachu face*
---
Well it was fun to have a CAMP while it lasted.
---
I had this happen to me and unfortunately I didn't have the materials to repair it so I ended up spending most of my caps trying to get materials
---
I'm not particularly fond of the SBQ; the best thing of the whole fight is that the adds she spawns have a chance of being legendary.
---
The sheep-a-tron however... that does tickle my fancy. There is a clear mechanic, ~~is~~ can be a frenetic killfest and it lasts just long enough.
---
If you bought a god or OP build it's because you don't want a challenge. Sorry you got what you paid for.
---
Aaronholt farm Nw of V76 usually spawns dogs/mongrels and there are bugs of some description around the grain silos usually.
---
Farm top left corner Abernathy I think (has p armour near grain silos) also spawns wild dogs
---
I don‚Äôt get why people just don‚Äôt move their camp for 40ish caps then move it back for another 40 it repairs everything I mean yea it is a pain in the ass but still it‚Äôs easier than getting the materials
---
&gt;It's so strange because ESO is pumping out compelling content consistently.
---
ESO has been out for over 5 years. It was shit for the first year or so, and slowly recovered. Even if you ignore the fact that it's 2 different studios this is still a dumb comparison.
---
The lighthouse event was great for insects
---
Sons of Dane logging camp, always spawns dogs or insects for me.
---
I love that idea. Especially if they spawned at a level that posed some actual danger in a group.
---
The local pound.
---
And Dennys.
---
I might replace some of the vat perks with carry weight for food and chems since I rarely ever use vats
---
 Why do you love the cryolator so much?
---
This guy gets it. :)
---
You play ps4 because i think i have you added
---
Big Maw? Is that the name of that place in The Mire? There's a picnic table area right beside it that always has insects, usually bloatflies but sometimes stingwings and ticks.
---
If you feel like server hopping, you could always tag those 3 dogs down the road from the Overseer's Camp (if you're heading towards Flatwood). Make a day of it!
---
I had someone give me like 5-10 legendary items including a level 50 furious the dragon and I'm level 26
---
Full Raider group of fat mans
---
Oh great idea.
---
True, was thinking of server hoping to get 50 kills for them there.
---
Meanwhile in lvl 40 Solo Land...
---
"... oh yeah I beat it in 5 minutes too. Turns out it *was* shite false advertisement."
---
Weird for me its always super mutants and ghouls.
---
They accidentally released the wrong challenges for the week and day
---
Goodbye sweet decon arch, I loved you the most.
---
Yea that was my first reaction after playing other fallout games was to horde food and medical supplies. Unfortunately do to the weight limitations of this game and the endless nature of the enemies I quickly learned that I‚Äôd rather devote my perks to weapon damage and efficiency upgrades. To each there though, if you feel like you want to carry tons of that with you I‚Äôm sure you can tweak your build to accommodate.
---
Good to know, never knew that farm existed till today lol.
---
I was hoping for a scripted boss, something along the lines of the sheep boss.
---
I still need to make one and I am lvl 87 üòÇ
---
May 7
---
There's at least one other holotape. Markus' Speech, I think it's called. Found it in what looks like his throne room in one of the residential areas.
---
Its a diving suit no one knows how to get it
---
Hey at the least they are good to sell for some caps. Yeah A lot of high level players are just giving away or trashing legendary weapons that they will not use.
---
Not just only destroying their camps but also releasing radiation there so childrens of their childrens will be still affected by that.
---
No, they did get it from the Sheepsquatch, and they whined like little bitches.
---
I honestly have never needed that perk card for any mods, I wonder if it was broken.
---
Give us a holdable one that we can pick.
---
Thx
---
So it doesn't cost materials to move it back
---
Yes, apparently it's now better than Whitesprings
---
Same problem here. I got this as my FIRST daily after the Nukashine quest. I'm supposed to drink fresh wine and then land a sneak attack on someone. I've been unable to complete it though I've met the requirements over and over. It won't register that I've done it and I can't abandon the quest - thus, I can't get any other daily quests from Biv. 
---
Please help, Bethesda!!!
---
Yeah those days were nuts :) We got wanted from scratching a paint back in the days.
---
Love it haha
---
No just caps
---
I sold some of the ones that I wouldn't use and Last night I think white springs had a issues and spawned all weak gouls and I came out with 11 legendarys
---
So happy they changed that tbh
---
So all I have to do is press the move camp button and the move it back after I placed it
---
Yep and everything is repaired
---
If only we could drink the paint.
---
I always thought it meant that every group/solo person doing it was separate from each other
---
[Perception 50] "It fucking sucks" is a complaint.
---
I mean honestly you aren't missing that much except a giant target in your base for dicks lol
---
Thanks to both of you!
---
Chaotic Evil: The Reddit Thread
---
Same for me. I just waited for someone else to open it lol
---
Today was a good day
---
Yeah as I stated I could sacrifice some of the Vat perks since I rarely use Cats and then switch them back in if I need to.
---
Thanks for the tip but at least I almost 3 shot him with my double barrel that does 80 damaged, he was level 39 and in full power armor and I was in the low 20s
---
Fuckkkkk...
---
Yeah mine too
---
Yeah, it should have been a daily quest, instanced and have a good amount of legendaries to kill. Only once per day so you can't server hop and grind the hell out of it, but make it an awesome once per day quest for high level players.
---
I don't see the paper that starts the quest at the Southern Belle Motel. The 3 patio tables are empty.
---
Look up builds online if you are trying for damage  although you don‚Äôt unlock the good perks like adrenaline till 50ish
---
cheaper to maintain
---
Wait until you hear about the time I went from Middle Mountain all the way to Glassed Cavern at 40-something with a random group of lvl 3-4s, with a level 70, 90, and 200 joining in at the Bog
---
Your entire position is predicated on knowing what took place and when, over an entire hour timeframe, with no greater visibility than 1 hour of resolution.
---
It is also based on telling me that I didn‚Äôt ask for further clarification, while simultaneously stating that my request for additional information doesn‚Äôt count because i later edited my request after I observed OP treating myself and others unfairly.  This portion is predicated on the irrational notion that my clearly identified edit was not actually an edit and came along with my request for information, or that it was added without first observing OP jerking people around.
---
You should find a different hill.
---
Ah, had to server hop.
---
Someone destroyed mine today cuz I was wanted, we had a few good battles.. It's mostly concrete, no biggy.. I say if you're going to destroy a camp make sure someone is in it so they have a fair shot back at those caps
---
That doesn't work?!?  I was thinking of that!
---
I think the game alerts you though if someone breaks things at your camp if I‚Äôm not mistaken but yea I sorta feel you on that
---
Yea my friend that sounds like a good plan. I‚Äôm really only here to give you some advice and inspiration. When I first started playing I was so stress out about doing what all the best players where doing so I could have the best build possible. In the end though you‚Äôll be much happier if you just do what you want and fallow your own personal style.
---
It's fine I think it's just funny that he almost died to me and he eventually left the server to remove his wanted tag
---
Dang. That‚Äôs trash. Even ESO had that.
---
Best weapon drop I had was a Quad Explosive Double Barrel, from an no-star legendary mongrel near the Grafton Steelworks workshop .. but it was Lv25. I was farming materials (plastic and rubber) from the laser rifles the supermutants drop there. I was just scrapping rifles at my camp nearby when it bit my ass .. I laughed so hard, I never get anything remotely that good at any of the farming areas
---
Yeah you may want to put it in the news in the game. I spent forever trying to figure out how toget the cameras quest to spawn since I had two dailies and a wewkly doe ir.. Finially gave up and looked here.
---
Well, I wasn‚Äôt really expecting a challenge. I was however expecting more than 20 minutes of content. The damn ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù was pretty empty. Literally just ghouls, almost no story, and I really don‚Äôt understand why tf this was advertised as a BOS mission. As far as I can tell, the signal they detected was a stock Assaultron. That makes zero sense.
---
...who?
---
Wanted tags follow you if you leave the server I‚Äôm pretty sure lol and yea pvp is super weird in this game
---
Lol I was wondering if Negan was who they were going for. We get it Bethesda raiders are mean ol' people. Tell us an interesting story, what happened to the government conspiracies and shit. It's kinda weird that the most interesting "story" in this game is some lovecraftian interloper shit that might just be people reading into things too much. 
---
Shit, atleast some of the goosebumps books had characters and a plot.
---
You can stack the death claw eggs as well, get to it.
---
I've experienced it in the normal world before the update
---
i posted about this *on the Bone Raider release day*.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbdqbs/bug_ultracite_left_arm_can_receive_the_new_raider/
---
Not.  A.  Single.  Response.
---
I haven't bothered to check (or read into any patch notes lately) - but disappointing to hear it persists.
---
I‚Äôm ready
---
Sheep killer
---
Never tried
---
The event was somewhat boring after the 20th go, but at least it was something to do. It brought people together, and was honestly pretty entertaining to watch the robots parade around. I absolutely agree with you.
---
Hey, props to you for doing this. If you were on the other console system I'd be going ' Hell yeah!!' But sadly there is no cross platform set up yet. Sigh.
---
Might be time to accept that whoever is behind this game just doesn't know what they're doing.
---
If you drop a atom painted item, it flat out destroys it. I tried to drop a 2 shot .44 I painted gold for a friend and thought it would destroy the paint when dropped but it just went poof
---
I assume Arktos will be a part of Wild Appalachia, since it is shown in the trailer.
---
It isn't the same people saying these two things....
---
Yes, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that wasn‚Äôt their intention.
---
So go south from the motel, up on the rocks is a shack and on the shelf by the door there is a note that will start the quest! :) MARI1117
---
Start over with a new character and I bet you would probably be complaining that it‚Äôs too hard. I thought it was just fine. Sure I one shot everything but I pretty much do that everywhere. After all the complaining I‚Äôve read I was expecting something terrible which it was not. I probably grabbed 7-10 legendary items (nothing good for me) but still there were legendary drops. I thought it was just fine.
---
Man, when I said they'd make challenges harder to force us to buy atoms I didn't mean like this.
---
So where was the key you found, I apparently missed it and didn't see it the second time through either. I've seen people talking about it but apparently not what it opens so there's that mystery as well.
---
What exactly is that Artkos pharma looking underground lair I‚Äôm so confused
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
My theory is they didn't apply much thought to it, and over hyped it. Hopelessly what actually happened is they diverted 90% of funds towards Arktos dungeon.
---
Lol yeah
---
I enjoy the two play styles I have. One character sneaks around and dies in one hit if he gets detected. The second plops around in PA firing Gatling guns and .50 cals at everything with a side of an executioner Mr handy buzzsaw. 
---
Really the sbq is the toughest fight. With adds and the fact she flying around half the time. Then comes sheepsquatch. Unless you got the folks that know what they're doing and the builds to take that energy damage, you're gonna have a bad time. 
---
But I see them adding few stories here and there plus some extra content. Usually expansions don't come our for at least a year after release depending on the market for it. 
---
So if you're expecting another 200 hrs of content from a single 5GB DL, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Lol. Right?! Kinda common sense no? Using duped OP gear makes everything one shot and boring. Try using what drops for you only or trading only for * weapons. I guarantee a much more challenging experience.
---
Tomorrow! I'll pick up my second egg and make more towers #tothemoon
---
Cant wait for the screenshot!
---
Awesome! Did you get a legendary nocturnal wood armor left arm at least?
---
I literally only attacked him to see if I could and eventually he had his friend try to kill me, his wanted tag went away when he came back into the server
---
I finally completed my unyielding/sentinel's set, and I'll explain why I like it.
---
My build is bloodied melee/rifle (SPECIAL: 15 15 1 1 5 7 12). I like running bloodied because it makes PVE more of a challenge. I generally prefer to just be lazy and shoot things, and rifles allow me to work with plenty of range and power. However, I also want to feel like I'm making a difference against the SBQ, and, for that, I prefer melee.
---
Unyielding/sentinel's is perfect for my build during a SBQ fight. When she flies, I pop off the trash mobs and gain attack power through adrenaline. When she lands, I park myself in front of her and use melee. Since she's so big, I don't have to move much, and sentinel's is very helpful. Meanwhile, unyielding raises my strength so that I can do more damage.
---
I like my set-up (unyielding/sentinel's) because I get to have one set of gear that does what I want in PVE and is generally adequate for PVP, but it's not ideal for PVP.

I'm not a big fan of PVP, so I wouldn't find assassin's armor very worthwhile. However, when I do engage, my strong suit is spotting and blasting people who use chameleon/stealthboys to avoid being VATS'd. Sentinel's armor keeps me alive because I'm able to stand still while doing this. Most commonly, if I die, it's to an explosive shotgun that staggered me out of sentinel's, wielded by a player who caught be by surprise or from an unexpected direction. I am also handily obliterated by someone rocking bloodied melee unyielding cavalier's.
---
This brings me to my real point: for PVP, your equipment must maximize either dealing damage or avoiding damage. Unyielding only accomplishes the first goal, and then only for melee, and then only by sacrificing survivability (because the benefits from unyielding only apply at low HP). However, a melee character generally can't function well by just standing in one place: they have to close range and pursue their target. Therefore, sentinel's is a bad choice, and unyielding cavalier's is the much better option. (AFAIK, unyielding/assassin's isn't a thing, but it wouldn't be terrible to mix in a few pieces if it were.)
---
For a ranged attacker, assassin's sentinel's is the best option. There's no armor effect to improve ranged damage output, so the focus should be in defense. Even though assassin's provides diminishing returns when sentinel's is also in effect, it's a good choice for PVP defense. It would also make sense to have a life-saving piece, or perhaps chameleon or auto-stim, to replace a couple of the assassin's pieces.
---
Also bugged out for me, quit before entering the storeroom and now I no longer have the first half of the nukashine ingredients list in my inventory and no sign of the quest, cannot restart it in any way either.
---
To be fair, at least the SBQ and Sheepsquatch imposter are unique enemies that require strategy to kill. This dungeons boss was a stock assaultron. That‚Äôs it. I fight a dozen of those every time I go through a silo to fire a nuke. Hell, if this is a dungeon, then so is a nuke silo.
---
One of the best water farming spots in the game.
---
Wait a week or so and then server hop about 5 times at around 2am on a Tuesday. You're gonna have a blast.
---
Weird. I've been there dozens of time for wood and I've never seen super mutants. For me, it's always insects or rad rats.
---
Yep, the Marketing team polishing a turd
---
Good job! It will be your first of many. In about 30 more levels you can officially hunt them en mass. I'm just level ~180 and can kill them in seconds with less than 20 bullets. Ad Victorium soldier! Keep slaying them!
---
 [/u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ladydevann) please see this bug
---
Vanguard is like bolstering but for high health. Not like unyielding üòã
---
My first run had ywo 3*'s both of which dissapeared.   Coincidentally, they both happened to be on the gratings.
---
Junkie switch blade noice!
---
Ah, you're right.
---
Like a werewolf transformation in Skyrim.
---
What would be cool, and true to other mmos, is to have a queue with varying numbers of parties like solo, 2, 4, etc. If this is a 'dungeon' that is
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about it. Guess preppers will be preppers lol. At least you‚Äôre well stocked up now
---
"accidentally"
---
Exactly.
---
I remember my first scorchbeast fight.
---
The fissure site by the Pumpkin House, level 80 diseased...Took 90 minutes with two other players, all of us were like level 40ish at the time.
---
xD
---
With folks like you, I'll never be convinced that this game sucks.
---
67 for her, 81 for me. We've been more on the path of building fun CAMP's and hunting treasure maps lately, so our builds are probably nowhere near optimized.
---
I love leather armor, it's the coolest looking IMO. It's a pain to get an unyielding left leg though apparently
---
Not this dungeon per se, but imagine if you will a much longer instanced dungeon, like the ones they said they are releasing in the summer.
---
I only have the wolf and deer. No idea on how to get the rest of them.
---
My thought was: it‚Äôs a shotty attempt at showing the players how and what the future dungeons work. (Not that we need to be told how dungeons work). The whole place would have been more encouraging to do if it had a daily or even weekly quest/run. 
---
At the very least it‚Äôs just the WS golf club but larger.
---
Yeah mine were also near the gratings.
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek there are a couple of issues here
---
You can Just wait it out. It will eventually run out. Not sure on time though. Might be up to an hour.
---
Try logging out of the server, had a guy who destroyed my base use this to remove his bounty
---
Yeah I lost count of the amount of times I‚Äôve expecting something to be long and hard only to be disappointed.....in the gameüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Depends on your build. For me, changing a couple perk cards around can mean a 1 shot or three shot depending on the weapon and perk cards. Things like time of day, if I‚Äôm teamed up or not, or armor can really affect your damage.
---
Guess I'm one of a few that enjoy it.
---
No. That was not the burrows in that video.
---
Thank you for your input, its nice to has tge foresight from where I am at level 12
---
I did 3 queen fights yesterday 1 after the ither with a load of randoms on the server, we killed her all 3 times and in recod time (for me at least) 1st took about 4 minutes, second took about 10, and the 3rd was over in 1 and a half minutes
---
Just saw 2 120+ level players trash the camp of a lvl 11 player in Flatwoods. Say what you want to defend yourselves. You're clearly cowards with deep feelings of inadequacy in real life.
---
FYI.. there‚Äôs also a [Best Buy Exclusive](
---
If they even could do hotfixes, I bet it would break the game more with every hotfix.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been using my power fist lately and used to use a baseball bat so must be I don‚Äôt have the right perk cards thanks
---
They told us a while ago that it was moved back to May 7th.
---
Oohh they are hyping the squatch up sooo much
---
Uh huh. I haven‚Äôt watched that video and I‚Äôm not going to watch 45 minutes to figure out what you‚Äôre talking about. Was he specifically talking about the burrows? Or are you just assuming the burrows was all and only (or even at all) what he was referring to? The video the other guy linked isn‚Äôt about the burrows. New underground areas, sure. But that video was not the burrows. The burrows is basically an unannounced extra that we have all hyped way out of proportion.
---
oh wow thats really rude of em
---
Tato.
---
gotcha, ill give it a go &lt;3
---
Naw, that sounds about right. That Sentry bot is a static spawn and is always level 30. The Scorched were probably spawned by a higher level, and Deathclaws and bears always hit hard if you can't kill them quick and at a distance. At your level anything other than the Forest and Toxic Valley can be pretty tough. If you killed that Sentry bot at level 20 though you're definitely doing something right. Can I ask what your build looks like? Perhaps I can offer some suggestions.
---
awww man, I want a bloodied handmade so bad, even 1* would be great, or a bloodied tesla gun would also be amazing.
---
Like the things that should in theory require prep for? Like making sure your weapon isnt about to break before you go in. Do a lot of people carry around only 1 weapon? If you are carrying around one weapon you should probably have Luck of The Draw.
---
They aren't going to release anything that will break a fully repaired weapon before you are finished with it.
---
The biggest problem was/is the ever growing need to be the strongest possible. While it‚Äôs not the terrible thing. There needs to be a cap on overall damage. At least for the current state of game. 
---
Maybe if and when the mention of prestige mode comes out it‚Äôll hard balance the game.
---
No. There isn't a conspiracy here, NPC's weren't "cut" or dropped due to engine worries. They were never a part of the game's design philosophy.
---
I can see that but being a lvl 112 player myself I never even go into the forest or the one in the north of the map
---
Let me clarify. Any PLAYERS who do this is straight up the lowest of low pure trash.
---
It's like this everywhere.
---
I go to Whitesprings and there is nothing but dead bodies. I go into buildings in Watoga and they are empty nothing but meat piles.
---
How many players are on each server? .....24?
---
With only a half a dozen places to farm legendaries in the game what are 24 players supposed to do if the half dozen farming locations don't respawn?
---
Yeah I think unarmed and one handed are two different perk sets. Also mutations will play into your damage when you switch weapons. I don‚Äôt mele too much so I‚Äôm not sure if what I said is accurate. I use a 1* bloody DCG for mele but don‚Äôt use perk cards for it because it‚Äôs already powerful without them so I can‚Äôt attest to the difference in damage between 1 armed and unarmed.
---
It's not listed in the name. You can only tell, by looking at the stats, or actually wearing it to see the visual differences.
---
I mean, Zenimax is making a truckload of money off ESO. I imagine that was the intention of bringing their other major IP to an online format. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect Zenimax would want 76 to emulate ESO‚Äôs current success by learning from ZOS‚Äôs mistakes.
---
useless glowing bugs
---
and the waitress says here's the soy you ordered.
---
Junkies (reportedly) actually has very solid damage if maxed out(hint: better than TS), it‚Äôs just got massive maintenance costs if you die, and minor stat debuffs basically all the time.
---
I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but Bolstering armor can come in all varieties of combat armor yes. You're at the mercy of the RNG though.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a coming feature. Tbh I like the burrows as farming location. Gives us a chance to see it barebones. And give feedback of what it needs. Which instanced and daily quest/runs of it.
---
I watched my wife take it at lvl 26. She was in excavator at first but decided to save he cores less than halfway through. She did go down once, bit only once. She has a lvl 25 one star fire axe and can one shot most of the charred ghouls with a heavy attack.
---
&gt;!Thomas Eckhart, leader of the enclave in the region and power mad nutjob responsible for the creation of and release of the scorchbeasts and plague. !&lt;
---
They are different I found out today that there is an unarmed perk and just got tier one and I have talons mutation for my power fist
---
I got a ton. At least 8-10 drops but possibly more.
---
there are mods for armor that help with this i though
---
Uhhh no. Sorry but my build is based around carrying as much shit as possible and the place was insultingly easy with any weapon. I didn't need to farm ammo, or fusion cores, or chems, or stimpaks. Hell I didn't need stimpaks at all. Why? Because the place was full of weak ass ghouls that die in one or two hits.   
---
Where are the mirelurk queens and hunters, the sentry bots, the fucking deathclaws and radscorpions (you know that enemy you never see because this is a ghoul simulator now). Send a swarm of stingwings and bloodbugs at me, chuck a vengeful mothman down there,  SOMETHING, ANYTHING PLEASE .   
---
Bethesda (or whoever is working on this damn game) : Lets put in little groups of the weakest and most boring enemy in the game then call the 'dungeon' 'challenging'.   
---
I've been defending this game but this patch murdered my expectations. I don't expect anything good now, maybe that's what they want.
---
They "could" yes if they so wanted to for "reasons".
---
I mean why the hell not, we have freeken mutant shrimp and anglers that somehow marched hundreds of miles from the ocean into the mountains of WV.
---
Toxic valley is good for radscorpions and the radscorpions horde event.
---
Ok I'll have to go back and check again. It seems like it could be a good story
---
Find the nearest person willing to shoot you in the head
---
Brain cells, apparently. Don't fiddle with mods unless you know what to do. Also, mods are strictly not allowed in 76.
---
At the time they released the video we had no way of really telling what we were supposed to be seeing. Yes some eagle eyed vault dwellers saw the arktos pharma logo but we had no way to know it wouldn't be connected. Maybe arktos pharma had some connections to the burrow like some home away experiment? Maybe the burrows were so expansive they connected all the way to arktos pharma? We had no idea and Bethesda used that to intentionally mislead us. That's the idea.
---
i know right then he had his friend try to kill me,at least i almost 3 shot him with my 80 damage double barrel , i was low 20's and he was in power armor and level 39
---
But what if the Players are the Raiders?
---
no.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take duped OP gear to make everything boring. Literally all a bloodied ranged build needs is... a bloodied 1* ranged weapon. The rest is perks and mutations.
---
They said it was going to be a high level raid dungeon, and its not. That's why people aren't happy with this content.
---
You‚Äôre on the right track then.
---
Yep plan on grinding levels to switch my perception to strength and also my luck
---
I can do either one, as long as you provide the materials. For enclave, the urban operative base suit (it's not craftable) and 4 crimson flux. For Brotherhood, 4 violet flux.
---
I was able to complete in about 15-20 minutes. I was level 53 at the time, melee build with an All Rise and power armor. I died a couple times (the gutsys deal a lot of damage) but overall it really wasn't hard or complex.
---
The most useless is the bounty system. It does exactly the opposite of what it was designed to do. 
---
Instead of maying players wanted for trashing camps and attacking passive players, they should get an incurable disease.
---
One of the filthy boys managed to pull a TSE Handmade from down there. We just need to keep fighting, I knew my speech wasn't in vain!
---
Haven't found a good one yet
---
Well like I said the super mutant vendor helped a lot. Current build is [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ba96956&amp;d=sa2s61s01sv3pa0pd0p80pk0p60pr0p90pl0ps0e00ej4e80ei0e10c72ck0i30ic4ii0ia0i50a70an0at1ah0l21lb0l90l61&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=) or at least thats what I plan for.
---
Currently using a recon rifle lvl 20, double barrel shot gun and mostly lvl 20 leather armor except the chest which is lvl 20 combat armor.
---
I usually dont use grenades mainly because I just dont collect enough.
---
It sometimes shows up under a miscellaneous quest
---
yes this is definatly a new "random encounter" have found it twice today both times i heard a loud wierd sounding mooselike howl
---
I feel like youve never played an MMO.
---
The only thing that levels after 50 do for you is expanding your build options and QoL perk choices. Only gear has an effect on your character strength after 50.
---
Keep your eye on agility. Those sneak perks help a lot. One shot everything with them right on top of you
---
Oh thank you will do
---
You can get the wendigo by doing the quest ‚Äúthat sinking feeling‚Äù you start it by reading a note on a table outside the southern belle motel near the robot that gives you a daily quest
---
You have that so horribly wrong. The scorched plague (as far as we can gather) was developed in Artkos Pharma, which while it is a Military complex, has no relation to Eckhart. All the Enclave did for the region is unleash the Liberators so they could artificially get the DEFCON to 1 so they could employ use of nukes
---
I've heard there are ways to complete that. I.e: each level has a specific requirement, and you can meet all three requirements in one level-up.
---
No survival mode is for PvP. I want a PvE challenge and burrows was not that.
---
I was hopeful for The Burrows, thinking at least it would be a cool enough thing that we'd want to do it every once in a while-- you know, like Line in the Sand, or SAM or whatever. We still enjoy doing those now and then, but I have no desire to go back to the Burrows. It was just that underwhelming. On the other hand, thank you Bethesda for adding a new place to LOOT and SCAVENGE. For this reason I'll add it into my rotation.
---
Yea I read a post earlier saying it doesn‚Äôt always show up
---
The scorchbeast queen fights definitely break more than 1 fully repaired weapon if theres not enough of you doing the work, me and my teams first attempt at around level 50-60 had to be called off when I broke about 5 weapons and ran out of ammo for almost everything else.  
---
And yes, a lot of people carry very limited number of weapons, I dont, but ive seen enough peoples videos who carry literally5 weapons in total on them
---
Yeah but I don't pay enough attention to go to a specific location wearing a hat to level up
---
That sucks, but just have to accept it cause they will never get this game fixed! Every patch they break something big in this game.
---
I get downvoted for writing it but i dont care. I honestly dont understand how ANYONE still can defend this game &amp; Bugtesda. And i have 1000h so i have seen quite a lot in this game
---
Found a dead brahmin full of quills as well. It seems to be a new random encounter,.
---
So basically what you're saying is "I don't want to look at the evidence that clearly points out that Bethesda was intentionally misleading because I'm locked into the mindset of I'm right you're wrong" cool. Ignoring/dismissing evidence is a sign of a strong argument.
---
Because Bethesda touted it as being challenging even for high level players. Or something like that.
---
I‚Äôd love it if the cannibal perk had another tier to it that can chance roll for you to on the ‚ÄúWendigo‚Äôs Hunger‚Äù which makes you feast on flesh for while.
---
Thanks for this friendo!
---
There's really very little that can be done to manage expectations from people who, after experiencing the utter slog of 3-steps-forward-2-steps-back that this game has been, still get hyped at the drop of a hat. I'm down for dragging Bethesda about pretty much anything in relation this game, but people would have been just as disappointed if they had just called it a new area.
---
Toxic valley for radscorpions and the radscorpion horde event.
---
And Legendary armor drops as heavy, sturdy, light etc. You can‚Äôt mod it as you can non-Legendary armor. Hence why some armor pieces go for such high prices.
---
Newport's I mean cigar boxes.
---
You can also use a junk extractor on a junk node, I was pulling a decent amount of fiberglass spooles that way
---
Met another player who was looking for the entrance for around 45 minutes, he was talking in area chat and looking everywhere for the man hole cover. I found it and invited him to a party as he was over level 100 and I was level 32, we had so much fun solving the mini labyrinth. He told me he never joins parties anymore since someone used it to jump him with a group of friends before, and his Fallout 76 friend he played with before stopped playing so he was a solo player now. Everytime someone else entered it would respawn the adds and it was fun. Overall I rate it a 8 out of 10.
---
I remember one of the devs at that recent Q&amp;A thing saying he played melee. I'm convinced this is why they won't nerf it.
---
The game's content is poorly balanced around legendary items. They took the already powerful legendaries from FO4 and let you use 3 effects on a single item. It's just too much.
---
Want to come over for dinner sometime. We got roasted scorched.
---
What? No not conspiracy.   
---
The game is light on content, and THAT is a fact.   
---
Forts, settlements, raider camps, etc are all designed with a TON of detail in them and were meant to be lived in.  Meanwhile quests are light on content and never make the player feel invested in the game world. Probably because it's DEAD and unchanging.   
---
Also, the whole "the only humans you see are real players" line was BS. It's a fix meant to cover for a lack of content. I mean, hell, ways to beat it are simple from a lore perspective. Off the top of my head, here are 2
---
1) intelligent ghouls. 
---
2) human npcs sealed away and safe in bomb shelters or hazmat suits (like what Rose should have been). Or shit, someone stuck in a suit of power armor and afraid to get out because the suit's the only thing protecting him from the virus. 
---
Or, if they wanted to stick with the whole "plague killed everyone" idea, more sentient robots. I'll be frank here, NONE of the robots in this damn game hold a candle of interest to the robot NPCs in Fallout 4. Hell, KL-E-0 has more life and personality in her then the Grafton mayor. It's cheap work and poor writing.   
---
The game looks like they built the map first, then ran out of cash or time when it came to adding in NPCs and hiring voice actors.
---
How did Bethesda intentionally mislead us? I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre misleading ourselves. They‚Äôve already said the raids and vaults are coming, this is clearly neither of those and wasn‚Äôt advertised as such. People seem to have conflated this with an actual raid. 
---
Think of this like a dungeon from Skyrim. Not crazy long, some interesting details, some good loot, and usually a decent boss at the end (some form of drauger lord). Not Alduin himself at the end of it. The biggest problem I have with the boss is something I have a problem with across the game- Bethesda has made a very weird design choice where certain enemies are WAY tougher than their level indicates (which is fine) but still drop low level gear. If this assaultron is level 46.... you can‚Äôt get level 50 gear off it. Make them tough, but make them drop appropriate gear. Instead of a L20 gutsy and a L24 assaultron , and the assaultron is 60 times more dangerous but drops barely better loot, make it a level 20 gutsy and a level 50 assaultron(literally just change the displayed level to 50. Don‚Äôt buff level 24 assaultron more, just display them with a level appropriate to their threat level). Then the threat and rewards both match.
---
The mods do not help with the armor penitration, at max level Stabilized gives heavy guns 45% armor penitration. I also believe the mods only help with the sway that occourse when looking down a scope, not dksitive on that though
---
Does anyone feel like NPC were at s location days before you arrived like I was in savage divide in the southern part and I go up this tower and idk maybe it‚Äôs made to feel this way it‚Äôs just a radstag is hanging radio going and food growing I just feel like NPC are out there just beth is waiting for dlc for us to see them
---
I'm assuming it'll be lie the binoculars and it's a weapon you equip but does little to no damage and would allow us to take "action shots" on the fly because it's just aiming down sites so to speak.
---
Try changing mods and seeing if that has something to do with it
---
I hope you amateurs are gonna give us free atoms. 
---
Also, stop letting students work on you game. The bug fixes you claimed in last patch didn't happen. Favortites are STILL bugged !
---
You should be able to use the drill on furniture for a chance to get some screws, just like in real life
---
I agree somewhat to that
---
He means by what do you spec into ie what does your upgrade points going in
---
I'm sorry but breaking 5 weapons on SBQ isnt anything near what I'd consider as normal.
---
Yep
---
To me a dungeon in a Fallout game is like gearing  up to clear out the raiders at the Corvega assembly plant in Lexington. From afar, approaching it from Concord, it looks an ominous castle that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and towers over Lexington (which is two or three times bigger than Concord). And to even get to the front door you have to fight through hordes of ghouls, rooftop snipers and a raider in power armor catapulting mini nukes. 
---
I would love to have an instanced "dungeon" that doesn't necessarily have to be underground. To me that's just boring and done to hell and back. I was much more enthused about the parade and that was just following a bunch of robots around shooting mobs.
---
Yeah, I've got toons who are lower level than you that are bosses and toons that are higher level that are useless. It's a journey and if you're having fun, then thats what matters.
---
In my head a furious or executioner‚Äôs with the +10% damage while aiming and fire rate increase just sounds like a good batch of effects.
---
Ghouls aren't an issue I have a two shot handmade and a bloodied lever action. It's those freaking guards it's so annoying.
---
Why would you recommend something if you don't even know it exists
---
Fairly certain its the muzzle brake
---
Eckhart issued the liberator invasion, the mass-production of scorchbeasts and I believe he got the west-tek facility to become operational again, to increase the already small super mutant population. Don't quote me on that super mutant thing, but the Enclave did have a hand in the surge scorchbeasts.
---
I thought it was fun tho a bit short
---
Also sometimes there are ghouls in half of hf. So you really could get lucky if you knew they were spawned there! I‚Äôm going to do this tomorrow for sure.
---
Exactly it‚Äôs just a large order of the Whitespring golf club add the quest and hold the amazement.
---
On the plus side, last time this happened with a challenge screw up, they reset the weekly challenges the next day. There are 3 fairly easy ones available now, might be worth bonus points if they do the reset.
---
Multiplayer FO4 is what we all wanted. BSG refused to make it, and instead sold us an MMO. So it's either this or nothing, and we are trying very hard to keep "nothing" at bay. Would be nice if Bethesda joined us in the fight.
---
It is for a few level 50's trying to take her down months ago before they increased weapon durability
---
Its the barrel type
---
the note next to it says that mari is the key to his heart and her birthday is 11/17 on the teminal
---
I‚Äôm surprised people still use them tbh. Everyone in here is crying that he‚Äôs so OP but TSE isn‚Äôt even the meta anymore rofl.
---
Mass production of- What the fu- who the fu- I should kick your fucking ass who is this?
---
Depends on level been spread a bit across the board. I think I have the most in perception, luck and int. Not at console atm so can't take a look.
---
Sure, just make PA even more useless.
---
Does it work? Lol
---
Or turn it into excavator x01? XD
---
If they could add more different little things like this . ATLAS place looks ready to start up as well as a bunch of other locations. If we could see this happening on a weekly bases that would be amazing
---
I could use it, what do you want, I‚Äôll give you some legendaries for it, if anything you can sell them to the legendary vendor when they put him in
---
And now?
---
No, I‚Äôm asking you to either tell me what exactly was said in the video, or better yet point me to where in the video you‚Äôre referring to. I‚Äôm not parsing through 45minutes of video for you to make your point. Just saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs things coming that are amazing!‚Äù does NOT mean they‚Äôre misleading us about the burrows- that‚Äôs an unfounded logical leap. That‚Äôs like if a professor warns the class that this is a hard class, but the first homework assignment is easy, you start calling the professor a liar. Like, what? That‚Äôs hardly the sum total of the class, and he never talked specifically about the first homework assignment at all.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted more pins to drop, similar to BOTW. Little symbols or what have you.
---
Lol i just killed a guy in survival i unloaded a full drum tse explosive tank killer mag in him and his health paused at one bar and refilled this happens  5x! Is anything a challenge after that?
---
It just reset again. I played all the way through big Fred‚Äôs bbq this time and had Charleston next. Logged out for a bit then go to play and it had me at the blackwater mine. I‚Äôm beyond frustrated.
---
i have never eaten another player. eating other players is technically the only form of cannibalism, isn't it?
---
scorched, ghouls mutants maybe were once human, and now are not, so don't count?
---
ahh! only other players can reproduce to form another human! technically.
---
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the advertising on the front page that says "Will you survive this subterranean challenge?"  
---
It's just not a challenge. Honestly Harpers ferry itself as a town is more of a challenge than this.
---
They over hyped it wayyy too much
---
Now everyone has god tier weapons and builds  and we killed it in 1m30 seconds
---
yes you can only tell by the armor amoutn whether it is heavy or sturdy or light  if you go to craft a heavy peice yourself you can see what that number is supposed to be
---
Lol yeah cameras and player vending + The Borrows woulda eased the saltyness!
---
I can agree with looting the burrows, it is definitely useful for that. I can also see potential in nuking harpers ferry and farming the burrows. It just wasn‚Äôt what they advertised though.
---
Why would you say that after you just posted this thread? You're so confusing Mr Reddit, always changing your mind, I really don't understand you.
---
TBH I don't think they have the tech or know how to create an instance.Their 2 "programmers"left on this project are just adjusting sliders on some simple GUI "game maintenance tool" created by the real programmers before they left.It has sliders on it marked "monsters" ,"loot","spawn rate" etc...lol
---
This... I will never understand how people lump everyone in the same boat like this.
---
Good for you. I was thinking of doing that but I didn't wait.

If they just un-gimped the other places that were legendary farm spots everyone would be happier. I'm nervous they are going to gimp White springs and then what? Make a leader of the pack type event but with yao guai or behemoths. 100+ level folks need a big boy Whitesprings with  ** being the common drop than Whitespring's famous * loot.
---
I have no idea what the last bit is pertaining to so I'll just address the first half. They mislead us on the extensiveness of the burrows. We had (as I've said before) no idea on what was coming next. So when players began to speculate that the burrows was going to be some epic extensive raid that would be late game focused that could *gasp* replace the SBQ Bethesda said nothing. When they at the time full well knew that it was going to be nothing like that. It wasn't even going to have an event. They simply implied that it might be like that to build hype to lead players on. They did this in the panel and they did this in the trailer by not distinguishing between the different underground areas. We have no actual idea when the akrtos pharma area is actually going to be out. We don't have any clue what it will be but it's definitely not going to be what we as players hope it will be. Considering the direction they are taking the game and series I'm not hopeful.
---
Preach.
---
Just wait a few minutes and log back in.
---
Try getting heavy Gunner perks and stabilized and watch those bats drop! Congrats, they are ANNOYING and the feeling of triumph after killing one is great!
---
I'll give you a LVL 40 Nocturnal Explosive Automatic Tesla Rifle for them
---
I know you don't have access to a lot of perks at your level, but the trick is to not have a lot of those passive perks equipped when you don't need them, for example those lock picks and hacker perks. They are valuable to have, but you'll want to switch them in when needed and not just have them equipped all the time. Also of you're using a shot gun those rifleman perks are useless. You've got a decent sniper build in mind by the looks of it, so you'll want to focus on stealth perks if that's where you eventually want to end up.. Otherwise you should work on getting shot gun related perks. And even though you don't have access to it right now you'll definitely want Adrenaline in your Agility in any build you're going for. It's a 5 rank card, you don't need to max it, but a few ranks in it will go a long way for you. Lastly those Charisma perks are good for lower levels, but once your build is focused and nearing completion you might want to look at Lone Wanderer (if you are solo) and Tenderizer. 
---
But the most important build advice I can offer is to just make something that's fun for you to play. Take my input with a grain of salt, it's just what I would do to maximize my own fun. From the sound of it you're holding your own in battle, so as I said you're doing something right!
---
And? Elimarand and myself spent the time gathering the Bravo codes, because NukaCrypt hadn't had it solved. So yeah... Good for you big boy.
---
Join random events!
---
It's metal brain corrodes
---
It is not instanced, that was people over hyping the shit out of what was always just going to be little more than a new interior "dungeon" with it's own lore quest.
---
I honestly liked it. My friends and I took our time and enjoyed the new location.  I'll go back tomorrow for another peek. It was easy to get through but fun.
---
Thanks I will take a look at those perks.
---
Here is a small bit of necromancy but realise that this is currently worse FO4 release mod scene as of now its only textures and UI Mods
---
Idk I just mean difficulty wise only thing in the game that‚Äôs hard
---
It's called rubber banding. I noticed the screen will have 'static' or a funny graininess to the graphics just before rubber banding. Annoying but not fatal. The freezing in pip boy menu issue needs to be fixed like yesterday though.
---
Now it‚Äôs time for the queen :)

Sorry but that's wrong. Artkos did develop the virus before the war. But they didn't release it.

Whitesprings recording 8.5.2. Eckhart released the scorchbeasts into the region to get DEFCON down to 1. 
---
Here's the transcripts.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Whitespring_surveillance_recordings#8.5.2
---
recording 5.4.8
---
Eckhart: So you're telling me we're responsible for this thing? It's what? A mutated bird? Some kind of vulture or something?
---
Scientist: Mister Secretary, based on the physiology we're assuming something originating from the Chiroptera order before undergoing changes... bats, sir. But it's not just a result of radiation, sir. The specimen was inadvertently exposed to our biochemical tests last year, considered a failure at the time.
---
Eckhart: How dangerous is it?
---
Scientist: We're still establishing that, sir. It's mere presence seems to have some degree of contaminative effect on the immediate surroundings...
---
Eckhart: Can we make more?
---
Scientist: ... sir?
---
Eckhart: Can we reproduce this? For the purpose of additional study?
---
Scientist: With all due respect, sir, this potentially represents a grave threat to the personnel on-site, and I'm not sure...
---
Eckhart: I'm not asking for concerns. I want results. Do whatever you have to do. Keep this thing, study it, and report all your findings directly to me. Are we clear? And keep it off-site. Where you found it, preferably. One of those old AMS mining complexes, yes?
---
Scientist: Yes, sir.
---
Eckhart: And for now, let's not burden any of the officer corps with worrying about this. Understood?
---
recording 6.9.7
---
Eckhart: And you still received every bit of power that came with it. And now it's time put that power to use. Because that's our mission.
---
Santiago: Releasing Chinese robots and Super Mutants and whatever monsters your people have cooked up on the populace at large has never been the mission!
---
Eckhart: I want to do this as little as you, Ellen. But we've tried half-measures. If we're going to overcome DEFCON, we need to be committed.
---
Santiago: No! This is too far, Thomas! I thought I could ignore all the blood you've shed - the Congresspeople, Blackwell, your fellow Enclave members. I've heard the recordings. And I stayed. Because I thought I wanted revenge against the Reds that badly. But not this badly.
---
recording 8.5.2
---
Santiago: Unnhhh... what's going...
---
Jackson: Sir, we need you on your feet. We're short on time here.
---
Santiago: ...Ragnarsdottir? Jackson? What the hell?
---
Ragnarsdottir: Glad to see your brain's not totally fried, sir.
---
Jackson: Here's the quick version, sir. Eckhart's released the beasts. We're at DEFCON one.
---
Santiago: Good god. How long have I been out...
---
Jackson: Doesn't matter right now. We're in open revolt mode here, so time ain't on our side.
---
Santiago: I didn't authorize anything like this...
---
Jackson: No sir, you did not. But at this point we don't really need your approval. Could just use a few extra hands to help us clean up this mess.
---
Santiago: Lead the way, Captain...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjmtPaGhLz8    thats the wendigo
---
I found a couple 2*s through out but I went with 2 team mates. At the end, I killed the assaultron ahead of my friends unintentionally. I opened up the tube and it closed behind me. When this happens my guys caught up to me and the assaultrons respawned for them! So if I would of gotten out of the tunnel I could of killed them again. So you could be right, someone could sit at the end and farm the boss if they wanted to I think.
---
the burrows though is easy i am just using normal 1 star tier weaponry and can blitz through the burrows
---
The Burrows respawns incredibly fast. I finished the quest and hung around with another guy for a while looking for any missed notes and holotapes and most of the ghouls had already respawned, although no one else had come in.
---
It's not something people usually think about because the only nuke zones most anyone ever goes to are prime and whitesprings and neither has an interior with ghouls for anyone to notice the difference.
---
The one that I missed is a clue near a tree, on the other side of the lake from the den, it's a page from the doctor's journal.
---
I hope that helps.
---
See comment above ^^
---
Which university did you get your gane dev degree from?
---
It's in the games actual audio logs.

If this is referring to the "dungeon" Most people who did this weren't even 50 nor did they have decent builds. Any build can do this "dungeon" in less than 30 minutes solo. A OP build could do it faster. Also quit trying to be a kiss ass here a screenshot from the patch notes. Take note of where it says  " offers a challenging experience for even the toughest of Wasteland adventurers."

---
Add your mods to the end.
---
Well Perhaps... maybe stop relying on your "own discord" mate. 
---
Perhaps you need to stop acting all high and mighty mate. Yes NukaCrypt is good, but you've been very slack lately with the solving of server Silo codes the last couple of weeks. So I find it amazing you've come out here to attack Elimarand for helping the community out, when in fact we're all in the same boat wanting to get the nuke codes active quickly.  
---
Your code solver is confusing to use, so I don't blame Elimarand for linking a manual way to do it, because your solver is confusing and there's next to no information on how to use it properly.   
---
In short. Good for you for checking for "Uploaded" codes on your own "Discord" Don't be a dick to others for having a go themselves.
---
The only thing that I really didn't like we're all the valves that opens gates to nowhere Lol
---
This is a Bethesda game, mods are 100% allowed, unless they broke the game or make you Invincible or something.
---
I had the quest to launch a nuke, so when I logged in tonight, I decided to nuke Harpers Ferry to spice things up. I wasn't sure if it would have an effect inside the Burrows, but figured I'd give it a shot.
---
When I went into the Burrows, almost every ghoul was glowing, and there were a ton of them. Luckily there were several other random people going through, because I probably would have died without them. I spent maybe 30 or 45 minutes in there, and got something like 5 legendary items.
---
Seemed a world apart from the stories I was reading on here earlier.
---
thnx, already got it
---
What level are The enemies? Are they scaled to the player?
---
Well, the Refined .50 Receiver has nearly the same damage as the Hardened Receiver, but unless you're short on 308 rounds there's no reason to convert.
---
Agreed. If you compare the picture to the base gun you can see the addition to the end of the barrel.
---
...hold up, I'm on xbox and I just noticed that my egg is invisible too. The fuck??
---
They should make them a bigger trip than Nukashine. And that stuffs like alcohol and LSD.

---
Ah. Thanks. Wasn‚Äôt sure if the difference was a huge damage spike or something like higher chance to cripple or anything like that.
---
1. Fix freezing in game when using the pip boy or crafting bench.  This only became serious after the latest patch.
---
2. Fix the servers so 'server not responding' and ,'disconnected from server' are less frequent than finding a *** legendary anywhere in world.
---
3. Fix weapon repair.
---
4. Fix food spoilage you tuned up rot rate too much!
---
Got in early, so actually got to do the quest. To be honest I never even got in my power armor and used a crafted lever action. I was able to sneak kill about everything, until the end area. So the 2x 50+ is a bit off, even in a "new" dungeon.  I hope they plan to add more quests to the area. I like the underground and hope for a repeating quest for the area.
---
 Had a much better legendary day, map wide, than normal so at least that is good. And the Easter eggs will probably be enough to play until the next patch so...
---
Fucking drama queens. High level raids are later this summer anyway.
---
Do you know the passphrase to scoots terminal. I cant get in
---
Bethesda said camp destruction is soon a thing of the past, best thing is to just leave a server.
---
That isn't a fix. I get this often 5+ times per play session. I just spent 10 minutes try to get the game to let me in.
---
Yeah the ability to craft 100 round at a time for it is also nice.
---
My God, the weapon repair! Why does the info disappear? Lol.
---
Food spoilage rate did go waaaaay up. However, and maybe this is just me, I never really go hungry anyways, and I'm running a speed demon mut.
---
Gotta really fix the *** enemies and *** equipment. I still don't see the difference between a standard legendary enemy and a *** legendary enemy; difficulty and loot quality seem to be the same. 
---
For the *** to hopefully soon ***** equipment, hopefully they will balance this out and base it off of level/luck. Maybe it already is and I'm just unlucky lol.
---
Nuke it
---
Respectfully, players that have 1000 hours into an MMO this young are insatiable and you will never be happy. 
---
Most MMOs, especially at launch struggle to leap full time players happy. 
---
You will always be able to play content faster than they can make it.
---
How on earth did you kill one?  I‚Äôm level 51 and am absolutely no match for one.  Any time I see one it‚Äôs time to GTFO, or die quickly.
---
I found it by the throne.
---
I will say this, today I did 4 or 5 runs through WS after the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and I was pleasantly surprised! I was getting legendary drops off normal ghouls. And 3 of the times there was actually real multi star enemies! Each time I left with 3-5 different items. 90 percent were shit but still it was a lot better than normal! They need to un nerf the spawn rate at WS at a nuke event though something serious!!! It‚Äôs actually ridiculous that you have to sprint there 2 seconds after the bomb goes off or you won‚Äôt get to kill shit or collect any mass or fluids etc. nuking is the only thing to do in the game for me at this point and at this point it‚Äôs pretty damn useless. So I agree, they need to step their game up because real players know what‚Äôs up. These senseless drones who always stick up for Beth no matter what have to be pretty limited I would hope. Just look at this sub... every post is about how all the new content is shit! You know they see these posts and I think that‚Äôs great.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I haven't found mysterious quills, but I have found sheepsquatch meat so there's that.
---
how the hell did you use 1k 5mm? how many ghouls did you kill? either way, d/c always sucks
---
Funny enough, I participated in the queen event, and emerged victorious, but I didn‚Äôt really contribute to that much damage.
---
i bet it only appears at midnight
---
Yup. Happens most often with the first death  I noticed.
---
Suggestion: keep hazmat in favorites wheel, during the 0.2 seconds of spawn immunity you have, hit dpad and choose hazmat there, and pray for no lag. You'll have to replace your armor once ur clear, but easier than the alternative.
---
Can we be friends? Because I basically agree with this.
---
I got four legendaries out of it on top of the gutter. Was a good dungeon.
---
Where are the annihilator sentry bots when you need them.  Make the legendary a sentry bot and put a couple explosive mark 7 turrets in that room and boom, a zero mechanic boss fight.  On the way there add a couple hidden roof drops that swarm you with a LOT of gangrenous charred ghouls, encourage explosives.  Wouldn't take much to make this a solid dungeon.
---
Oh word
---
Lots and lots of stimpaks, t45 power armor, and a teammate. If you are lay on pc, dm me. We can go after one together :)
---
I know I've killed things, but theyre all zeros on my counter
---
Eat one and you wake up in a cave, cuddled up with a deathclaw and scorchbeast.
---
Yes please.
---
Yeah I completely agree. I had no idea what on Earth anyone was complaining about when I did it myself- the Burrows is HUGE and maze-like, it‚Äôs a really cool designed dungeon?? I do agree that the lore was a little bit lacking- I feel like a couple portions of the story were kind of glossed over, like what life was like BEFORE the Burrows Boys took over/how they rose to power/etc, but overall it was really cool just to have a new area to explore.
---
Mine involved two L80 Diseased variants and me running into the WhiteSprings for cover and Robots...
---
After that one, my first one-on-one went very similarly to yours. Fuck, its a great feeling taking down your first solo bat :)
---
Corrupted how? What does support say about it.
---
and we still have to repair Rover.
---
I nuked the Haven Church/Treehouse/Deathclaw Waste Dump NE of Harpers Ferry when I was bored a while back. I didn't get any super Deathclaws unfortunately and their respawn was extremely long for some reason. There was a random long conga line of Bloated Glowing ones that spawned often a little south of church and of course the ghouls that are always in the church were upgraded. A clustered pack of Legendary Fog Crawlers spawned often NW of Treehouse which was neat since I rarely see legendaries of those, otherwise not too populated and very damp.
---
I use my BE gatling gun that does 829 damage. That's why they do so quick. I wear unyielding and use my high perception to smite them.
---
&gt; Sheepsquatch wasn't even that difficult
---
It was difficult for me in a certain aspect.
---
I've had to call the event on discord because at times there are people just not strong enough to take down the sheep in time (the notification shows up for everyone at all levels), which led to people loading their other accounts on the event and capping the limit due greed, just to sell the stupid white wolf fedora for 400 caps... you know I could use some of that money due the expense of buying the card.
---
I had to use from 3 to 10 stimpacks while getting your life sucked on 3 pylons because other people just can't stop shooting the robot BUT they start spamming Ask for Help when they got downed.
---
I haven't checked the burrows yet. Hope I can solo it as VATS riflemen because I'm not even slightly interested, between my aforementioned experience and the assholery of full body blocking bottlenecks of nuked zones and events to prevent even damaging anything.
---
Waah, muh atoms. 
---
I seriously don't understand why people care about few dozens of atoms.
---
For the cryolator. Salty?
---
The ghouls down below will not drop mass, unfortunately.
---
But now I can microwave my new butcher shop!
---
It's mainly related to servers not being able to communicate with your area fast enough, and as such, not much that you cando about it. It's deoends on the load on Amazon's servers abd your ISP's. I get it sometimes as well (had one case last night) so it may be because a lot if people are logging in to check out the Burrows? AFAIK there's no fix, logging in after a while may clear out the server load or connect you to a different one with less load.
---
It is though.  Like, objectively speaking.  [https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2018/](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2018/)  For the average gamer, who plays six hours a week, those 200 hours would last them 33 weeks. We are 22 weeks since Fallout 76 was released. By definition, if you have 200+ hours in game by now, you're playing much faster than average -- and consider that leaves no room for any other game in your schedule.

Did you know that it is possible to see the exact post time by moving your cursor over the generic one shown?  I did.  Strange how you keep building arguments and strawmen that require the use of things you think can't be known while ignoring the substance and intent of any of my comments.
---
I never said you didn't ask for clarification, and in fact said you did in both replies (just not prior to the replies from the op that you claim were aggressive, condescending, and stonewalling as I thoroughly demonstrated in the previous reply).  You insist on distorting and mischaracterizing both the op and myself in every reply.  The op did not treat you unfairly, and honestly you have gone much further into condescenscion and unfair treatment than anyone else here (the op has a grand total of 5 replies, none of which come close to aggressive except the one to you directly after you already accused them of downvoting your entire comment history with no actual evidence to support that claim and after clearly crossing that line yourself).  Honestly, pretty sure the multiple downvotes weren't the op, as even people who may agree with your perspective may not like how you conduct yourself (and I have seen where that has resulted in people being downvoted many times).
---
I love how you opt to make up random points that have nothing to do with what I have said at any point, as I have never commented about your edits (nor have I ever claimed they weren't done etc either).  As far as I could be aware they were made immediately after the post, and I have always regarded those edits as such.  You not fairly considering the op's situation while insisting she is at fault for stonewalling and not being helpful without recognizing that she didn't realize those she initially replied to were misunderstanding her is the basis of my issue (and that your remarks, regardless of intention, can be easily seen to be insulting).  Your absolute unwillingness to have any regard for the op as anything other than the cause of everything and being intentionally unwilling to help is not only insulting but utterly meritless.  
---
Unlike you, I don't regard this as a battle I have to win in order to justify myself.  The only goal I had was to help someone understand how the other person likely saw things and to point out the flawed logic in a comment made accusing someone else of poor conduct while doing precisely that themselves.  My apologies for giving you the benefit of a doubt, as well as the time and effort involved in pointing out how insulting and condescending your "help" is from the view of others.  I accept your insistance that you were and are completely aware of how you conducted yourself, and will regard you as befits that chosen behavior and intent.
---
I'm not sure what builds you think need more than 60 levels. After that it's just adding some swap-ins and filling out the quality-of-life stuff. Unless you're playing full time, you can easily acquire enough caps for a god-tier weapon and some half-decent armor by then too.
---
The difference between high and low level players is mostly the knowledge gap. Fallout 76 has a ton of undocumented and poorly-balanced mechanics. Abuse enough of them and you can stomp all the PvE content, if that's what you want.
---
Thanks this worked!

Please don't nuke Harper's Ferry!!!

Okay I am not sure if it was a fever dream because I will fully admit I‚Äôm on a fuck load of pain meds at this time... jaw surgery, had the right side impacted and hairlined.

Which is why I have not made a post but I was just putzing around near the most northern end of the forest and started hearing heavy footfalls behind me, then BAAA ... I VATSed everywhere but got nothing...

They were stealing the fruits of others labor like food from farmers or supplies from scavvers/traders.  The player "raiders" of 76 gain absolutely nothing and are doing this purely to have fun at the expense of someone else.
---
If raiders in other fallout games behaved the way "raiders" in 76 do than Abernathy farm would have been a smoldering wreck and a handful of corpses instead of a family mourning their daughter who stood up to the raiders the most recent time they came through for food.

I was being harassed by one of these guys. He kept hitting me with a power fist, so I shot back. I began hitting him with explosive gatling fire, to which he one shotted me and I went down. Little did he know, 3 of my armor pieces provide "auto stimpack," and I hopped back up and began hitting him again. He was not ready, and then died. 
---
I logged off right after. I won.
---
that would force players endgames to HAVE to be a certain build then.  some builds/weapons/etc just generate more power, having endgame content that can only be taken down with a certain build would ruin the game IMO
---
its not scrappable, you can sell it for 100 caps iirc
---
Are you just south of the Relay Tower at the bottom of the Savage Divide?
---
Im played FO76 after job almost every day since beta. 
---
Its around 150 days right?
---
200 hours / 150 days = 1,3 hours per day
---
1,3 hours per day is MUCH FASTER than average?
---
You didn't seen loadscreen hint which advertises this crappo gun as a "powerful" piece of technology, didn't you?
---
It's powerful of sorts. Killing someone with it is a powerful insult to the killed.
---
Cool Idea OP, BUT....The Engine of FO76 couldn't handle any of this... &amp;..... You'd get disconnected from server all the time because that what FO76 does right when you start to have fun or are just about to complete a mission/quest.....Player meet Main Menu, Main Menu meet Player. Now that everyone is aqcuainted....RESTART. This isn't Destiny nor do I ever want it to be. Cool idea though...
---
On my way!!! GT: Perfexcellence

Thanks ! Hope you find your plan.

Yeah legendary drops are horrific. Used to get excited at a *** now it's more wishful thinking that it's not gonna drop a * junkie's golf club. Adding **** would be interesting. How many lame legendary effects possible to combine with a drill?

Nothing fancy but to loot it out if you are around.

I can really see this being added to the game.
---
Missile silos are some of the most involved quests and really makes up for the lack of npc's opposed to the silly fetch quests.

I hope this gets the attention it deserves, you have my vote!
---
I got my first one with a black powder rifle and lever action, using the lever action to build crits and then using the black powder rifle for my crits. Probably took 20-30 minutes and I was lvl 25-30. Also took all my stimpacks

Also add endless useless ugly masks and outfits  that pander to the fortnite crowd instead of actual cool loot. K thenx, dynamic teen demographic. *shakes fist at youngsters and all the foofaraw these days*

This isn't a dungeon. It's an area to explore for 20 minutes. I see your points, but minimal work was put into the Burrows. It could have been better, like instanced for a group and with difficulty adjustments.

I love the challenge.  I usually die at least 5x.  I have never complained about it.  It's truly the most enjoyment I get from the game, currently.  I was hoping the burrows was going to be a challenge, but even without PA (I'm a sneak melee build) I still didn't die a single time, solo.
---
I had seen Rifle Gaming video that featured some of those masks. Though still immensely rare. Too many things are extremely rare in this game. Not worth the grind at all.

---
I didn't even know they used Amazon's servers, interesting. 
---
To be clear, this is before I even try getting into a server, this is just getting to the main menu.
---
They can call paid extra content(locations) as extension. If it's good enough no matter the cries and opinions, people will actually pay.
---
They can re-release the entire fucking game and call it Fallout 76 RTM, allowing existing players to transfer their chars for a measily XXX dollars. While having new content.
---
Bottom line is they can do whatever they please. The only obligations they have is keeping the servers running for few/some years, unless they are filing bankruptcy
---
Yeah, I just Did Burrows, it took me like 5 or 6 mins solo. I didn't even understand it was already over. Super disappointed. I dont know what they were thinking.
---
You have to eat one in a nuke zone, 3 starred legendaries turn into 4-5 for you but they go straight after you.
---
Gamma gun is your friend. :)
---
My build has 10 points of luck. Melee tank build with PA. I don't have a very good weapon,  1* super sledge, more dmg lower your resistance. 
---
I've got a troubleshooters fire axe with faster swing speed I use for silo/ robots, but I never found anything that wild. Never found a tse. I cam solo most of the game though so not that bad either. 
---
I have noticed that sub communities (reddit and Facebook) have created their own player vending essentially. Even a whole economy.
---
In game player vending is a cute idea, but it may not be as prevalent as the current model we have. 
---
Where I'm going with this is that maybe our own little economy we created can fulfill that void for players like myself. Where we can make and spend a few caps to fill in the gaps where we weren't so lucky...
---
I missed the parade due to being too busy irl. I was so sad when I logged in, made a beeline for Helvetia, and found it dead empty. It's especially sad since I was in Switzerland over December and was so looking forward to experiencing another bit of Swiss culture, even if only in a game.
---
Bring it back!
---
I know. The main menu also syncs with a server. That's how you load the Atom shop items, your friends list and the little news screen that is in the corner, as well as the annoying huge one that pops up nowadays when you load the game.
---
Upvote for you sir!
---
It seems like they‚Äôre going to keep up the Sheepsquatch mystery and add more cryptid related mini quests as time goes on. I assume they‚Äôll be rewards for those.
---
If they really wanted to make it difficult and rewarding, HORDES of Bloated Glowing Ones and Wendigos triggered from all directions in close quarters. Or a "defend the computer" while actual waves of 10+ (like the wolves/stingwings style,from Fascnacht) came at players who to either protect for a time, or protect while someone else fought to find a key.That'd be rewarding lootwise and dangerwise, and I need a reliable screw farm.
---
The robots at the end were extremely disappointing. Oh boy, just gotta fight some security bots. Change the Colonel Gutsys to Assaultron Dominators and the boss robot to be a legendary Annihilator Sentrybot.
---
Oh, and a Epic SuperMutant behemoth smashing its way through the giant intake valve at the end, killing the closest player al√° Initiate Reddin style and opening the empty floodgates for fight or flight assault. I'd like that too.
---
I did it in like 6 mins solo with a vampire switchblade at level 151. SUPER disappointed. I dont think they understand their own game, or their own fans. This could be done with a couple level 20's.
---
Eventually you build up the nerve and do it. Seriously, one day I said fuck it and stopped running. Was liberating yet nerve wracking. Was awesome
---
It works
---
So ultracite and x-01 I am assuming it works on others as well...
---
&gt;attention, 
---
Oh boy. So I'm paying you, heh?
---
Happens more so when I exit the bunker into Whitespring with the secret entrance/exit...I try to race before the wall closes....most the time I win..
---
I pretty much agree with you.  I'm a bloodied melee and I have several pieces that were found "by me" that can still one shot anything short of the squatch and queen.
---
I found 2 legendaries each time I went. 0starred ones but they were there
---
I went through at level 151, there were level 42 Ghouls and level 68 or w/e. I dont remeber what level the gutsys were, Assaultrons were 46. It took me like 6 or 7 mins in total.
---
Reroll a new character and roleplay if you want a new challenge. I gave up on my melee build because I was tanking everything in base power armor.
---
I killed my first by myself at level 38, but I was lucky because it kept landing so I could melee the hell out of it and it took damn near every stimpak I had. 
---
After that I was drunk with power and went after a Mirelurk Queen, which was a bad idea. I did kill it, but holy crap it was close.
---
I have no idea why you were downvoted.  I added to balance it out.  I don't do survival often as it's really only about killing other players, but I agree with you that it will certainly add a challenge.
---
cool story bro
---
Sure, as soon as they make Serendipity work with PA
---
Running 2160p native, I get 50 - 60 fps. A steady 60 in places like Whitesprings (non nuked), and 50's in a nuke zone or other super busy event.  Running overclocked 1080ftw and i7 4790k, 16 GB Ram, 1 TB SSD. Everything set too 'high' (just below ultra).
---
Surprised that 76 is actually running very well at 4k resolution. FO4 would probably slide show with same settings.
---
Legendary comes in all varieties of levels.  I've had light combat Chameleon chest and now I've got a Heavy Variant of the same legendary...I could only tell from the stats and the physical model of it on my character.
---
Yup not a single pice of Duped gear. I did have a vampires switchblade. The rest is max level excavators, no mutations. It took me like 6 or 7 mins at level 151 solo.
---
This quest was REALLY good, though it‚Äôs ever so slightly bittersweet for me because I built my camp right at the sunken church because it‚Äôs my favorite unmarked location in the game. It‚Äôs cool that it finally has an actual story to it- but also I‚Äôm gonna have so many people wandering around on my front lawn xD
---
I also don't see this as an actual dungeon. I see it more of how it seems to be. A newish area to explore with some mild story elements going into the lore of it with a slightly higher than average spawn rate of enemies.
---
I have to say, the area looks good, very detailed. But by my experince it should not be called a dungeon, lets say it just a normal exploring area like WS or WT U. it should had taken longer for sure, and I think the lvl off the enemies were ok but they need to ramp up the amount off enemies like x10 and then it will geet interesting. I think that was the misstake. 
---
overall it was disapointing especially how todd and everyone else hyped the area, yes it looks good but i did it solo about 3 times I did encouter 4 legend gouls everytime i did the new area. ramp the amount off enemies and it should get challenging. 
---
I do feel like it was a punch to the face from BGS tho, everyone was waiting for this (at least I was), and for it to be over in 5 minutes ok 15 minutes if you take your time and explore everything like I did. it was a let down.
---
come on BGS get your head out off your ass and make something happen.
---
&gt; I WOULD pay for it, IF they delivered amazing content. I have zero problem paying $15 per month for a premium online Fallout experience. 
---
Well I have. And I'm sure many others brought the game as one time payment kind of game.
---
Go shovel money to Blizzard or whatever company that runs subscription MMOs.
---
This is exactly what I thought.
---
I have a vampires 50 cal I'd sell for 2500 cap plus I'd throw in all the ammo
---
Try in survival, it‚Äôs risky but I did it. Better loot, more XP just gotta watch out for other players üëç
---
You nailed it here. My suggestion was very basic but seems easy to implement. The idea of having behemoths, glowing ones, Assaultrons and sentry bots and say a Legendary tank Super Behemoth as a Boss though would have made this update SO much closer to what we were expecting. Great idea
---
THAT I can agree with.
---
At that recent panel (Pax I think?) they said that the future dungeon raids will be instanced but they had to build the tech.
---
The Burrows should have never been called a dungeon. They should‚Äôve just said it was an interesting new area to explore with some challenging enemies and chances for legendary loot. 
---
I know they want to get some good buzz for the game, but somebody needs to explain the concept of ‚ÄúUnderpromise and over-deliver‚Äù to their PR team.
---
Take this OP! If you don't I will!
---
My current legs are level 45, made them myself and they have Deep Pockets.
---
I've been perma overencumbered for the lasr 60 levels or so, don't even remember fast travel exists. Speed Demon helps a ton.
---
‚ôãÔ∏è
---
Nuclear missiles will be shoot at any camp. Scorch queen won't be triggered but 100s of the scotch beast are terrifying Appalachia. And this will trigger another events as protec energy connection to whispering if not the vendors will shut down
---
Just logged back in, showing up as same thing, went to modify current legs and it's showing that i would need Armorer 3 on them as well. I'll try to post links to the screenshots tonight.
---
My team prepped for an hour b4 the burrows...I am disappoint
---
Just making sure. Thanks for the info. And yeah that stupid News thing ugh why lol. :p
---
Yeah, I mean I don't think thats right. They don't understand their own players or game. At level 151 solo I did it in 6-7 mins. That is pathetically easy. It took about the same amount of time as running through the white springs clubhouse and killing the ghouls at the door. 
---
We are 6 months into this now. The content coming out now should be designed for players who have been playing for 6 months now lol. Not for players just starting out. 
---
This was clearly something that didnt make it into the game and they finished it and added it back in. 
---
They need to rework the classing system. I know its kind of sandbox, but they need to start taking this thing in a direction for organized play.
---
Have a 40 TSE gatling gun if you want it, and probably 20 other random heavys ill check my mule uf you want
---
Honestly I think the only real issue was the duping.  They failed to properly QA their product.  Now, anyone can have a TSE, so much to the point they nerfed them.  I'm a touch over lvl 200 and have NEVER gotten a TSE, only TS or E.  If they had properly setup the product, a TSE would still be something really special.  Same for Sentinel or cavalier, though those are more rare and super costly... but can be had.
---
People are mad because this game isn't Destiny....Thank God it isn't...
---
Balanced for two level 50+ vault dwellers, or one if they are brave enough and well geared. In making the game accessible, well geared essentially just means having a decent legendary
---
Okay. I kept wondering what I had to have missed, lol.
---
There are definitely improvements that can be made to this one.
---
For instance, I was in there with people I didn't know. That's not instanced unless I'm misunderstanding the word. Instanced, in the way I understand it, means everything in there is spawned when you go in and you/your team the only person/peeps in there during your playthrough. 
---
This meant when I finished the quest, I finished it for the other two people in there, ruining the quest for them.
---
The difficulty and drops could drastically improve, if not for this one, for dungeons to come. If it's advertised as "tough for brave solo players," people way better at this game than I should be having a tough go. (They'd probably find something to complain about but I digress.)
---
I love the idea of different difficulty dungeons but this *might* limit options. Level scaling might be the way to go for the most part, leaving one or two dungeons as the "big ones" that everyone loves to go for a challenge. 
---
There is a post detailing how a lot of people overhyped this for themselves leading to disappointment. Bethesda marketing surely contributed to some of the overhyping but they never said this was meant to be endgame content. It's meant to be a new addition to the game that's new and fun. The latter depends completely on the player. I found it fun as did many others, many didn't.
---
&gt; Shivering Isles it Far Harbor
---
Those were paid DLCs on a rather popular games right?
---
Just curious, but where did you find the code?
---
Some how every guy who picks a fight with me has a full set of sentinal..... These people are obv non-legit, an obv not going to take any damage...
---
Hopefully they'll force people who have it to never be able to take it off, and null the fuck out of it. -5 ent -5 str
---
It's a shame I sold off all my junkie gear, I found some decent ones in the past week. I'll try it out for myself at some point, most stat debuffs don't affect my character much. I do remember hearing that it caps at 4 addictions or something though
---
I don't know how tough this would be to fix. But if they can change ghouls to glowing ones during a nuke, it seems like it would be pretty easy to just change all the ghouls to glowing ones and add other big enemy types. Also increasing the amount of enemies high enough and still be stable. Maybe bethesda will see this if enough people want it and make it in a future patch.
---
https://media1.tenor.com/images/97b012ba2b0511efadc897db0e35e4c9/tenor.gif?itemid=7790622
---
Have you tried talking to them?
---
&gt; It's sad that I, as well as most of you, could come up with something pretty awesome in a single day. Yet, these people get paid. For this. What's it going to take? Change in management? Do we need to pay for quality DLC? I don't give a shit, but just don't give us this shit. More effort please.
---
It is easy to say that when you don't have to actually MAKE the content. Everyone and their mother is an idea person, but when it comes to actually making those ideas into reality, you realize the ideas just aren't practical and need to be trimmed drastically.
---
Another person who didnt read their inside the vault.
---
Go read it.
---
It's not an option if you fit your camp into the landscape. Blueprints are hardly placable unless you're on even ground.
---
Funny enough, my build uses a quad automatic tesla gun and quad automatic handmade
---
I stumbled across that church a few days ago; my first thought was damn, I wish I could build a little C.A.M.P. down here.
---
I'm not sure if it's been there for a while or if it was added because of the patch but I feel like I ran across it before the patch for some reason.
---
Yep, that was exactly what happened for me.
---
Bro, enforcer makes a level 5 pump action op lmfao. If you're using enforcer on top of a tse pump action shotgun with maxed damage, literally nothing will stand in your way. No challenge short of disabling player input will counter that build
---
It took you a half hour? lol It took me like 6 or 7 mins.
---
Lol found 1 of these myself, it's out there sonewhere
---
I have a 1* TS Gatling Plasma for 1500, a 1* Vampires Gatling Laser for 750 and a 1* Vampires Minigun for 750
---
[Nice assumptions](https://gyazo.com/4c2e50f20e67c15aaafca5bed3b08de2)
---
Yes, because this is the one thing Bethesda needs to fix, of all things. Yup.
---
nice
---
That‚Äôs rng for ya.
---
Not looking for a Gatling or explosive ATM, bit anything else Vampire I am open to.
---
It only gets better from here! Glad to hear it
---
Vats stealth rifle build here. Did it solo. I didnt find it challanging whatsoever unfortunately. Shame though. Loot was kind of crap as well. Decent exp though. I was expecting more.
---
What do you consider special then? The only combination that would rival a tse combat shotgun is a severely specialized event, like a shot at the peak of your furious damage boost, a shot on a full health target with instigating, or bloodied at low health. Also iirc two shot still synchronizes with explosive to deal a much higher damage output than the sum of its parts
---
Nah, but I bet they will make legendary power armor to make it more viable for pvp.. But if they made stabilized without pa, heavy guns would would be over powered I think
---
All I can think is the server was having unseen issues.  
---
I had something similar happen, and I was noticing small things were off before the server totally ganked itself.  
---
When I reconnected, parts of my camp were reset to the point before I edited it.
---
I think maybe you quit the server before the server quit on you.
---
Seriously can't believe the amount of people I've seen saying it's the players fault it isnt a challenge and tonjust use worse gear if you want a challenge. What kind of screwed up logic is that? 
---
Hey here is another challenge! Just put a blind fold on while you do it! Your eyes make you too good.
---
I don't have an OP build (my perk deskcard is a mess) and I did The Burrows in 10min. They put ZERO effort.
---
In my eyes it was marketed as a more difficult endgame dungeon, they claimed it would take 2 lvl 50+ or one really good player, its definitely not that, I could clear it, albeit with difficulty, with my level 20 character
---
Plus a lot of my anger is they hyped up the entirety of wild Appalachia, and it's been a drip feed of low level content, theres next to nothing to do after you've finished the main quest, I love this game but I cant play it because theres literally nothing for me to do, it's become so boring and its disappointing
---
My bad was trying to respond to the Op
---
Prestige is coming!! I am starting to think ppl dont even read what Bethseda publishes.
---
I like to find my weapon myself. Buying something (duped?) on ebay is not my vision of playing.
---
Game should have released with raid tier end game content, vaults, whatever - as complete finished products do. Six months later basic end game content is still not here, people have been more than patient and more than generous to BSG at this point and any scorn thenplayer baes has, they brought upon themselves.
---
Another who doesn't complain when things aren't how they supposed to be. The world is how it is by people like you.
---
I entered alone and tried to take my time.  Another player showed up and finished the quest while I was poking around.  It wasn't a big deal as I was right there when they used the terminal, but I think making each player actually do the quest would be better.  Overall I thought it was a decent addition to the game, kind of disappointed it's just the 1 quest but maybe the story will connect with future additions.  11 1 star legendaries was good, but sadly nothing worth keeping.
---
Added the screenshots
---
GG‚Äôs man. And congrats on level 100 that‚Äôs fucking awesome.
---
Hey, i have a 40 Tse gatling gun and around 20 random other heavys, will check my mule if interested
---
How do I even start this quest?
---
Ah.. Cool. Cheers!
---
Damn. I was looking forward to this but was lacking a party. Guess i can just go in solo then. None the less i hope it was enjoyable at least
---
And for some reason you couldn't even bother reading through my post.  
---
I admitted they upsold the difficulty, but they never actually went as far as to sell it as the be all end all instanced endgame content with endgame gear people sold it to themselves as.  
---
Inside the Vault is not written by the devs, it's marketing/PR work the same as the community rep posts here which is why it's always more embellished than it probably should be and at times gets things flat out wrong that they end up having to correct.
---
The fact of the matter is that even with the embellishments they at best sold the burrows as a quest that would only require two people, that's hardly a standard that anyone should have expanded into being Bethesda getting into end game raid content already.
---
Thanks so much!! :) &amp; thank you for joining!!
---
I feel like you are the one who didn't read it
---
First of all, the one you linked says almost nothing about the burrows except that it will be a dungeon. [This](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview) is probably the inside the vault you were thinking of, with the notoriously misquoted statement that it will be a challenge balanced for two 50+ players. That's it. A challenge for players past the level cap. They didn't say "those of you who are already at level 400 with god-tier legends, prepare to die!"
---
Its loot, sell it or gift it. I think too many people are playing this like a single player fallout.youre not going to get god tier unless you grind or spend caps.
---
I use an Xbox controller on PC and done easy af.
---
Fireproof perk makes you almost immune to their ranged attack, and if you can cripple a wing they will come to the ground and are much easier
---
Yeah there is, i have a 4* Bloodied Machete, its a Sacrificial Blade mod.. And you claim to have played hundreds of hours yet you haven't known about 4*.. Haha. Much to learn you have.
---
Stop with BS about GTAVO,, its all your opinion you keep spouting. NoT Facts..
---
Joking aside, that's the feeling I get as well, Fallout 76 seems to be a classic skeleton-crew project
---
Today was one of the best runs for legendary gear for me. Not because of the enemies in the Burrows, but because of all the ghouls now running around Harper's Ferry. Four 3*** enemies that actually dropped gear relative to my build for once, I was ecstatic.
---
With no compensation toward the player ;)
---
I want one.. I saw one the other day trading with someone, and couldn't believe the damage!
---
I have a powerful but mediocre (not spec‚Äôd) build.  I tore the burrows apart inside of 30 minutes (finding the key was the hardest part) solo.
---
Bethesda only seems to hate two difficulty settings.
---
Sheepsquatch and wet socks.
---
I don't think you understand what Speed Demon does.... it increases your movement and reload speed, and penalizes you with becoming hungry and thirsty much faster than usual (while moving). Speed Demon does nothing to your damage or energy resist, which is what Barbarian and Evasive do, so using Barbarian and Evasive
---
I guess I am God tier at this point, level 160 with plenty of tse and caps out my ass.
---
Or you know there might be a huge number of players who didn‚Äôt expect a raid and maybe just a decent PvE co-op experience or challenging solo dungeon if we wanted to try solo. It‚Äôs very reasonable to be disappointed by what the burrows actually ended up being. 
---
The marketing department doing their job is not an excuse ffs. If what you say is valid then the marketing department could also be making the vaults seem much better then they‚Äôll actually turn out. Will you defend that as ‚Äúgood marketing‚Äù then?
---
I am admittedly someone who defends the shit out of this game all the time even when I shouldn‚Äôt yet the burrows was absolutely disappointing to me.. We should expect good content since that‚Äôs what they tell us is coming yet we are constantly disappointed at nearly every turn. Blaming the community for the burrows is insane imo. Hype or not this is advertised as new exciting content and it clearly isn‚Äôt what most of us expected.
---
Not even the junk saves it.
---
I‚Äôm going to stealth add this fucker to every single one of my friends camps.
---
They hyped up new content because that's their job lol. They spend their time making things, they want players to come back and try it. We have item renaming, new quests, new mechanics, a good bit of balancing...all things that people have been asking for from the start. But I guess we need to forget about those within three days to be able to complain about the rest of it? If you get bored easily with new stuff, that's fine, but that doesn't mean it's not there
---
Here I will copy and paste it since u missed it.
---
1. Dungeon experience - key to dungeons are they r repeatable which this isnt
---
2. Available for the heartiest explorers - u dont even need to be max level to complete
---
3. Muster your squad - this is a solo quest
---
4. Heads up so you can get your characters prepped - no prepping was even necessary
---
5. Daunting new subterranean battleground - its disappointing but I am pretty sure thats not what they meant
---
I hope that happens, even if they are limited to 1 *
---
with a controller and non-legendary gear without any damage perks or PA?
---
You could beat it on your level 20 character BECAUSE it wasn't designed as an endgame dungeon.  Everything inside scaled to your level right?  If this were an endgame raid dungeon you would have been going up against enemies at least 40+ levels above you.  
---
Wild Appalachia is delivering exactly what's been laid out in the roadmap, it's focus has primarily been introducing new quests and features.  If you want difficulty then wait for whatever they have in store for Nuclear Winter which is when the actual raids begin to release.
---
Lol this is super goofy but I appreciate the time you put into this.
---
I dont like when games and stuff double up on rng. First, we need to get the rng roll for a legendary enemy. Then the rng for if its a 1\* 2\* or 3\*. THEN another roll for what item they drop? 
---
Just dumb
---
For all the whining recently about Bethesda nerfing Watoga just to fuck with people's legendary farming I seriously ended up killing at least six three star legendaries when I went back through just to explore and look for any secrets, and that's not counting all of the non-starred ones as well.
---
If you are this determined to perform any mental gymnastics necessary to have something to complain about, there's clearly no helping you
---
Have fun complaining about every future update I guess
---
And u can continue to ass kiss Bethseda
---
In OP's defense I would say that if the game have the weapon and is not a hack it shouldn't prevent the player from having fun doing a dungeon. If it was a dungeon. 
---
Besides they don't do THAT damage. It's normal now. Whine for whine. Lel.
---
I don't even play Fallout 76 anymore. I am just subscribed to this subreddit so that any time anyone complains it periodically reminds me to preorder The Outer Worlds.
---
"69, dude's!!"
---
Im a fucking potato and I went into the burrows by myself and only had one oh shit moment when there were too many col gutsys shooting me st once. I don‚Äôt really have a build, I don‚Äôt have a booodied build or whatever just a furious fire ax and a mix of misc legendaries that reduce carry weight, it was not hard at all.
---
I always press PLAY PLAY PLAY PLAY PLAY to prevent the news from appearing. They should be abobe the Play button with an icon when there are actual news
---
Their ‚ÄúInside the Vault‚Äù article hyped it is as being a somewhat difficult dungeon, if you want to call it that.  It said ‚Äúgather your squad‚Äù implying that doing it solo would be extremely difficult.  It was a far cry from that.  I get a better challenge at WestTek and at Harper‚Äôs Ferry itself.
---
Making a haunted house on Halloween!
---
Melee master race
---
You know I would agree with you if there wasn't already harder main quest content in the game, or you know, if the town above the dungeon wasn't harder to deal with than the dungeon itself.
---
Am I thinking too simple that they could use ESO dungeon tech for this?
---
I gathered that the mystery meat was human from the holos and notes. I think its a throwback to the wandering "hunters" in FO3.
---
I totally agree. Soon i hope to modify it to only show it when the news itself has changed and shows something new
---
We literally let them get away with it. It was unacceptably handled on Bethesda's part in every way, from denying it to never making it right.
---
Still available?
---
I‚Äôd love to see that. I‚Äôll be surprised if it happens though.
---
I obviously do not expect to get great stuff all the time but it gets real fucking old when you kill a Three Star Legendary just to get an Auto Stim Wood Chest Piece or the occasional Nocturnal Pool Cue.
---
Sheepsquatch is definitely something you can manage during the larger peak server time rushes on the event.  My wife and I helped my daughter through it her fist time the past weekend and she is lover level and not over geared.  Just keep your head down, keep away from the eye bots, snipe what you can (make sure you at least get a hit on the sheepsquatch to get loot from it =), and make sure you leave all your junk behind before going to the event.  I'm sure it will be chaos, but it is for everyone until they get the hang of it. =)
---
Spawning in to nuked zones because I logged out there. Takes a minute for server/player response so I just die. Itd be great to be spawned outside the area if that was your last log off or to have a small period of rad invulnrability so you can sprint to an interior or server hop.
---
Nah because Fasnacht is a yearly event. Both in-game and in real life. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Basel

It's like asking to have Christmas every single day....

Actually not quite. I can prove that's definitely not how it works. People are seeing patterns where there are none.

There seems to be a deficiency of imagination as I see another outfit you could buy from Walmart in the atomshop.
---
I didnt think it did scale with level, I memt with the level 60 ghouls (all 15 of them)  and they made it seem as if it was designed as endgame content when they said you'll need 2 lvl 50s, that's endgame
---
And yes it technically is giving what they promised but that's not really hard when they haven't told us much of what they're giving us besides a sentence long description of each item, but theres no need for new low level content the majority of the game is low level content, they're main fan boys, me included, have finished everything months ago and we need content that's not only 20 minutes long. The lying lowe questline was great but it's the only substantial thing they've given us, and it was only an hour or 2 long
---
If you've seen the wild Appalachia trailer, it heavily implies endgame dungeons, especially the one below arktos pharma, which we have zero information on and in all honestly will probably be cut or postponed to another DLC 
---
It's great they're making free dlc but theres no need for 4 hours of content to be spread out over 100 days and the high level fan boys who have done everything at least once need something to do if they expect us to pay real money for their over priced atom store products
---
What do you not understand about "THIS IS A BLOG POST WRITTEN BY A MARKETING DEPARTMENT".
---
It's not a fucking patch notes, they wrote a fancy description of upcoming content to get people interested in playing the game, it's their damn job.  
---
A "dungeon" in any Bethesda game is just how they describe interior cells.  Glassed Cavern is a dungeon, West Tek is a dungeon, the fucking DMV is a dungeon.
---
We were told it was going to be "hard" and you'd probably want to bring extra people. We accidentally "beat" the new "dungeon" in 5 minutes wandering around. 
---
I liked the area itself, and it's a decent spot to get junk. But otherwise? Eh.
---
Agreed
---
The star count is just an indicator of a possible 3 perk / 2 Perk / 1 Perk item to drop from that particular enemy, I would like if they ditched the "Star Levels" and just named them all just "Legendary", because it is a slap in the face when you kill numerous 3 Starred Enemies and they still drop more 1 Perk items than 3 Perk....it's false hope, but hope is what keeps you playing and looking for the next 3 star. 
---
Naming them all just "Legendary" will still give the false hope, just without the feeling of being cheated by the game/RNG when a 3 perk/ 2 perk item doesn't drop. I hate the system too...and have complained about this BS many many times.
---
I like it for college grinding
---
If you need specific information on the class setup to do this, message me. I bought mine for 16k. Well worth it, no regrets at all.
---
My first one was about a week ago, on level 42. T-45 armor, The Fixer, lot of trees (to hide), lot of stress (to me) and about two thousand bullets shot
---
Nope. At most I'll leave a bag of fert. Although the first time I saw another players camp i though it was in game. Got excited because i vouldnt pivk the door but the wall next to it was damaged. New mechanic? Hell yeah ill blast though that, ope now I'm wanted.
---
U have me curious now..what lvl is your character?
---
And have u nvr played any rpg games before this one?
---
It‚Äôs on par with running through whitesprings and killing a few weak robots at the end. Add some mild (very mild) puzzle solving and put it in a cave/sewer.
---
Seems like a extremely minor hiccup.
---
If you are a player that was disappointed enough in the game to not play it anymore, and you decided to come back because of this, do you really think that player would be so enthralled with this content they'd keep playing? "Oh cool a new dungeon! \*wanders around for 5 minutes, beats the new dungeon\*...that..that was it?"
---
That hypothetical player you're talking about would be either pissed and NEVER come back, or think it was a hilarious fail and...probably never come back.
---
I second this notion.
---
In online game referring to some underground location as "Dungeon", while it aint dungeon, just shows how out of touch you are with genre and don't understand what you are supposed to build. With Burrows Beth shows that they build vegan content to meat eaters (singleplayer==vegan, online==meat). If you are going to build vegan content, build it to singleplayer from the beginning. You don't go and feed a grass to a f#cking lion or zebra to cows.
---
Excellent reference dude!
---
And a joint, deerlord.
---
Anyone else have any suggestions or comments for fixing the burrows?
---
I had also eybots
---
Excellent placement! I love that!
---
You must not have seen New Vegas with it's more numerous "dungeons" compared to Fallout 3.
---
Hahhahahahhahahaha
---
The way we spend our free time in 2019.... I love it
---
I gave up my combat mutations just to bring a little bit challenge back to the game.
---
Not everyone has a triple digit level character with farmed legendary gear and a full suit of level 50 power armor to cheese through this stuff.  This was NOT designed as endgame content and if you're a low level with average or subpar gear going in blind with no one clearing things out before you there are a few areas where the ghoul spawns CAN overwhelm you.  
---
I'm well over level 200 and I actually died twice on my first time through because I got cocky with my bloodied sniper build and didn't expect a dozen ghouls to swarm me from every angle at a few points.
---
It is because the nasty Brotherhood nuke the fissure and messdd with the glassed caveen and releases the scorched + the plague from Vault 94, it all killed every human a little before the reclamation day.
---
It said "gather your squad" because they've always marketed this as a MULTIPLAYER GAME.  They want people to play the fucking thing together.  Once again THIS IS MARKETING TALK not a patch notes or player written guide.
---
We need a smooth baritone to record this.
---
Nope, you found it all
---
I went in alone at level 77 thinking I wasn‚Äôt going to get far. My Dad called just as I entered so I figured I‚Äôd just poke around a bit while he tells a story I‚Äôve heard for the 30th time. I wasn‚Äôt really paying that much attention to the game. 
---
About 20 mins in I accidentally stumbled onto the boss area, went in and beat the assultron. I only used one stimpack throughout the whole dungeon. 
---
I‚Äôm a casual player at this point. I play a few times a week and don‚Äôt have any special builds or any sense to my perk cards. This was sad but it follows the same basic pattern. 
---
Every patch I come back to play for a few days then get disappointed by the same bugs,  new bugs, and just lackluster content. Since launch they‚Äôve released a few hours of additional quests and a new crafting station... 
---
Still no player/legendary vending, no factions, no team CAMPS, or anything CAMP related really. I don‚Äôt want the game to die and I still enjoy playing it but I wish people would realize that the game is no where near what Bethesda advertised and their response, even now, is pretty sad. 
---
I‚Äôm sure in another six months or a year they‚Äôll release enough content and make enough changes that it‚Äôll be a good game but until then I hope people realize that Bethesda screwed up hard and people stop defending them.
---
A good time if you know what you are doing
---
So this
---
Yeah, pretty much any point to point interior with enemies along the way can be considered a dungeon. I‚Äôm slightly disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt any more difficult than say, a Watoga interior, but it still was a dungeon. A very nicely designed one as well, I might add
---
Facerolled the burrows in like 15-20min and was like "meh".
---
Then it hit me! I wonder when Rifle Gaming (aka sir nukes'alot) is gonna try... Aaand he did.
---
**AND OH MY!** The Burrows + Nuke = total chaos!
---
It could have been both shared and challenging, with mechanism and puzzles. But just a bunch of ghoul spawn points.
---
Dude the front page literally taunted us about if we would be able to survive this subterranean challenge....
---
"Peekaboo! Haha, I bet you‚Äôre wondering how I got in here huh? Well... wait... what are you doing? No... no! Don‚Äôt do that! Stop pushing those buttons! Oh dear god I‚Äôm going to die in here! Why did I do this!? My mother always said I was too inquisitive! Are you happy mum??? You were right, just like you were about everything else.... this sucks."
---
Level 233
---
Have you ever played any Bethesda games before?  This is NOT "any rpg", it's a Bethesda RPG.  It doesn't matter if in other games or in ACTUAL mmos a dungeon means something else.  In any Bethesda game whether it's from the Elder Scrolls or Fallout franchises THIS is what a "dungeon" is.
---
Educated guess: Someone nuked Harper's Ferry in order to farm The Burrows.
---
You arrived after the nuke dissipated and instead of getting the much loved 'freebie' wave(s) of post-nuke bloated glowing ones you got shafted with the much despised eyebots.
---
&gt; they said you'll need 2 lvl 50s, that's endgame
---
being level 50 is barely even midgame.
---
Lol ESO totally knows what a dungeon is. You r a joke.
---
"farming" is fine.  But Watoga was just a field of legendaries you could kill without risk and without actually looking for them.  Just wander a circle in the city and 1 shot everything. Thats it.  No risk, nothing.
---
Legendary mobs need to be completely random at where they spawn except for the events.  
---
I'm level 140 and still using crafted handmade, so I know about the crappy drops.  But that's how they made the system I guess.   All the good legendary I found was non-rifles and I did not want to change my perks.  
---
But watoga was too easy and no risk.
---
I stumbled upon a magazine called C.H. monthly on a table at Southern Belle Motel that gave me a mission that gave me the plans for the Mounted Wendigo.
---
When I read things like this, it really makes me want to try out some kind of gun build. I went instantly to the melee and I've been planning it for months and it's stupid how powerful it is. I remember being in the 30s and being able to take out a scorchbeast easily. Shoot it with a missile launcher a couple times to make it drop and then pull out a super Sledge with a low health build and all the damage Buffs from food and drugs and perks and you drop it in 2 hits. Really stupid but fun lol
---
+1 local maps. 
---
They can't instance shit because the engine don't allow them
---
True.
---
I love the constant repetition of wandering around for 5 minutes on this sub. If you bring in god-tier legendaries, follow the quest marker, never explore anything except where the quest marker tells you to go, completely ignore all the notes and terminals, you don't have a right to complain about lack of content because you are actively ignoring what's there. 
---
Besides, the vast majority of people who played before and left are gone for good. Their advertisement is for those who are on the fence, still waiting for new content and fixes to previous issues. That's being very clearly laid out through a roadmap and bimonthly updates. If the game got stale for somebody, they're not going to come back after every small update and assume that's going to be a game changer. When you get bored with something, you put it down for weeks or months and come back later. That hypothetical returning person is going to find a few new quests, a new dungeon, the ability to organize items by renaming them, fixes for some camp or weapon bug that was bothering them last time they played, and whatever else is new since then. You don't need to be a communications or psychology major to use some common sense. Something that's sadly lacking on this sub
---
hah, my countless years with being afraid of things that will never happen is finally paying off! :P
---
What happens?
---
&gt; Or you know there might be a huge number of players who didn‚Äôt expect a raid 
---
judging from the vast majority of complaints on just this subreddit, everyone expected a raid.
---
Why, what happens if you do?
---
The character im playing now made a beeline there. I think i was lvl 17 when I arrived. Sometimes you get those great mutations early off and need that nuka grape.
---
I tried that, but I apparently clicked on some atom shop thing in the news tab and it took me to the store instead of into the game. There's probably something symbolic about that
---
Now I feel like I don't NEED to log in everyday.
---
It is a good QoL thing that they unceremoniously planted a 'representative' - a consul of sorts? :P - of The Free States in the Whitespring.
---
I have a feeling that Harper's Ferry is going to be a 'Hazmat Suit/PA only' zone for a while :P
---
Nice
---
You wild, fam.
---
This is why I keep a bloatfly syringer in my stash
---
No, I dont.
---
Yes we should.
---
The road map that they‚Äôve barely been able to stick to? They couldn‚Äôt even release the camera on schedule...
---
Was about to post this. And do it quick before the Nerf hammer comes down.
---
I think OP meant in player trades. You can't even see the effects on multi-legendary items that other players are selling you
---
every game that has a "dungeon" is always different from each other.
---
what bethesda considers a dungeon is literally just an interior space with stuff in it. world of warcraft considers a dungeon as a multi-level, multi-tiered mission. what bungie considers a dungeon is a little linear mission. what final fantasy considers a dungeon is a four man matchmade boss rush.
---
a dungeon is not a catch-all term that means the exact same thing in every game,
---
And this isn't just "an online game" made by some random company is it?  It's a Bethesda game made by the people who make The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.  
---
It doesn't matter what a dungeon is in any other game, because in THESE games THIS is what a dungeon is.  It's a chunk of interior cell used to provide some atmosphere, some lore and some fighting.
---
Bethesda knows exactly what to call your idea of a "dungeon", that's why we're getting what they have literally labeled as "HIGH LEVEL RAIDS" later on, they can't get any more fucking explicit than that can they?
---
Pre-'many rebalances' nuked WS levels of Bloated Glowing Ones (and their legendary variants) spawn rates.
---
I have no problem with then hyping up what they've made but they've gotta be truthful about it, but if they want players to come back they have to make worth while content
---
Item renaming isnt new content
---
Theres about 2 hours of new quests 
---
And the majority of stuff people have been asking for is kinks that should've been ironed out during play testing 
---
And I haven't forgot anything the highlights of the dlc were a week long event, and a 2 hour long questline, and a new game mode that's essentially just perma pvp 
---
And it's not that I'm necessarily bored of it, it's the fact that once I spend an hour to do it, it's done, I have done every quest, I've got top tier gear and a camp that I've spent hours perfecting, I've done every event at least 10 times and every daily, now I load in and theres nothing, i could farm materials to repair stuff but theres no content that makes me break stuff in the first place it's become dry and bland and I play all the new content as soon as it comes out, I was just hoping for a lot more out of this doc because of the way it was hyped up by bethesda
---
Mainly because ESO was not made by BGS?
---
Its way better than whitesprings
---
Is it really nerf worthy? I feel like they intentionally did that. I'm pretty sure somebody else tested this at other interior locations (maybe the glassed cavern, idk) and said that nukes don't affect interiors. That would mean bethesda specifically made this one get affected
---
It took me about 20 mins because I was doing one of those ‚ÄòI‚Äôm on the phone I‚Äôll just look around‚Äô. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even mean to complete the quest... I probably could‚Äôve finished it in 6-7 mins if I tried.
---
Why not reroll something youre not used to?  You'll still have the god alt for pvp or harder instances and dlc.
---
Riddle me this Batman, who are the developers of ESO?  
---
Want a hint?  It's not the people making this game.
---
Charlie Kelly dailies: Eat 10 cans of dog food and 10 bottles of beer
---
Jokes on you, I worship Atom! Your advice is the best thing that could ever happen to my camp!
---
I read Dr Ken's Menu and saw huffing paint was on the "dollar" menu; instantly thought of Charlie xD
---
It's faster to respawn unless your the conduit or unless your some kinda revenant type maxed dps
---
&gt; key to dungeons are they r repeatable which this isnt
---
you can literally do it over and over again. what exactly do you think repeatable means here if not being able to do it as many times as you want?
---
&gt;u dont even need to be max level to complete
---
there is no max level in this game. level 50 is not max level.
---
&gt;this is a solo quest
---
pretty sure me and two friends did it together.
---
&gt;no prepping was even necessary
---
this depends entirely on how you play and is subjective to the individual person.
---
&gt;its disappointing but I am pretty sure thats not what they meant
---
subterranean means underground. a battleground means a place where a battle takes place. all this happens in the dungeon.
---
His comment not mine. üòÇüòÇ
---
The only good thing I got out of it was a TSE harpoon gun
---
Oh they've hired more staff then...?
---
I had the main questline well done before I was level 50 and that was before the xp nerf, sure theres a few side quest scattered around but not many, once you reach level 50 the only way to get stronger is perfecting builds and farming specific weapons/armour
---
I only went through once, and it was obvious others had just been there.  Ash piles, empty containers, etc.  I got 11 1 star legendaries(no guns), who knows what I could have gotten if it were a fresh area.
---
A-fucking-MEN.
---
The hype train derailing when the game comes out isn't the fault of the devs.
---
It's the fault of people not managing their expectations to reality.
---
I agree, the quest could have had more content tho.
---
There is also tons of flux all around Harper's. There is a farm up the hill as well with some flux. If you hit the power substation and Red Rocket to the south you increase the odds of a few more legendaries. The Burrows also spawns glowing ghouls now so it's 2 for the price of one.
---
Interior locations are affected. Couple of YouTube videos of this. Most the time it's not worth it but the burrows is the exception to the rule now.
---
With a controller and some legendary gear naturally dropped, no damage perk (almost all perks I have are for weight management, I'm a junk hoarder) and no PA. It's not a challenge. It's at Watoga level.
---
Lower levels have enough to do with the rest of the game, it's the higher level characters that need new content. Those of us with hundreds of hours need new things to do. Not another place to wander around in. 
---
If you died twice then wow. I died once when my gun broke and my game froze, but otherwise had zero issue in there at all. And I never had a dozen anything swarm me down there, at most I had 4 ghouls. I died to a Mr. Gutsy, I think, after getting that one door open. I did get a 3* Legendary Ghoul, so that was nice. 
---
Either way, 5ish minutes for an entire dungeon is a joke. We could get really good, enjoyable stuff, but instead of admitting this was less than good, you think that defending them is going to get you better shit? It's not. The only way we will EVER get actually good content is to hold them accountable. 
---
What this should have been was a pleasant surprise. It shouldn't have been hyped for weeks. Just imagine how happy everyone would have been if it was a little surprise added into the last patch. Not hyped as anything more than what it is. A very simple quest, and a neat location to farm junk. We would have all been happy. But instead it was promised to be for the "heartiest of explorers" (indicating high level characters BTW not low levels), and "daunting", which even for a level 25 probably not that "daunting". And a "battleground", like, is this an actual joke?
---
Your comment dude. üòÇüòÇ
---
If you going to state something, least try to be accurate..
---
Eso - daily dungeon quests
---
Eso - instanced
---
Eso - 4 man teams
---
Eso - multiple tier bosses
---
Like predators do haha
---
Not designed as end game? Then why did they say it was aimed at two level 50+ characters?
---
If you are low level you should not be in Mire area, where this dungeon entrance is located. Mire is second most dangerous are in the game (my opinion is the most dangerous because of bad visibility and lost of animals).
---
PSA: Don't be a d\*ck, 'good old days' WS etiquette still applies:
---
\- Tune your build so you don't one-shot everything.
---
\- Clean after yourself. Loot everything from the piles, dump all the unwanted stuff in one place. This area has workbenches too so leaving endless instanced meat piles of unlooted mess is inexcusable.
---
Your name is very fitting.
---
Too me it seems as if any location that has a load screen is a dungeon lol. At least this one has ghouls to nuke.
---
*download
---
And your internet speed is your issue not bethesda's.
---
There is nothing untruthful in what they said. The fact that this sub stretched their words out can't be pinned on whichever PR rep wrote out the inside the vault. They said we will get a higher level dungeon, we got a higher level dungeon. By itself it is already one of the most difficult dungeons in the game, but it's also even better when nuked. You can complain about the game balance itself being poor, and about the issues that should have been fixed before release, and about a ton of other things, and that's completely valid. But taking this update by itself and blaming your frustrations on it is just silly. It still raises the bar, no matter how low it was to begin with.
---
Bethesda knows. A dev replied on a similar post early this morning. Gonna be a low intake on earned Atoms this week.
---
Just a screw up by Bethesda. Camera isn't out yet.
---
Someone is really whinning downvoting all posts about how easy it is from a normal player that played the game since LAUNCH FOR FUCK SAKE 6 MONTHS AGO.
---
Sweet. Bugs bunny role play coming soon. Whats up doc.
---
No recent nuke, was on the server for 2 hours doing events for atom challenges before heading down to farm.
---
Might have misread then. I still doubt it will get nerfed though
---
Lucky Hole mine by Fort Defiance has a string of bugs inside and out. Few hops and I was finished.
---
"Main fan boys" like you are vocal minority.  If they only released material for you, normal people couldn't enjoy the game.
---
If you've finished this game, try playing another one.  Like it or lump it, friend.
---
They nerfed whitesprings. They nerfed TSE, they secretly nerfed perk cards. It will.
---
Is out there but gonna take a month or so to actually appear. Bad thing with teases all over
---
Peculiar... guess whatever 'disease' is turning ghouls into eyebots is spreading ;)
---
I have only encountered this myself in The Whitesprings.
---
thanks. a retarder is a brake system, and i just put the brakes to your dumbass bullshit.
---
Now I feel even better for leaving mine on the ground by the sewer entrance. Hope it went to a soul who needed it as much as you did.
---
This a thousand times
---
I gather there is a big bestiary out there thats largely ignored because ghouls are everyfucking where
---
See to me locations like wendigo cave and and glass caverns are dungeons, maybe even west tek
---
I feel ya man. I was in this place about two-three weeks after launch. I defended the game hard, until I realized it was more out of denial than anything else.
---
We all sunk money in, it‚Äôs only going to get better if we‚Äôre honest about it and don‚Äôt cut them undeserved slack.
---
Why am I not surprised. That's a statement, not a question :/
---
My best guess when I saw it is they just used the whitesprings clubhouse spawns to make the burrows
---
Wont happen. Not anytime aoon at least  That involves new models and new model wraps for cosmetics.
---
Looks like...
---
Two Bears High Fiving...?
---
It doesnt raise the bar at all it lowered it if anything, it's not even close to the hardest dungeon, and I'm not saying they necessarily lied but they implied it was ment to be way more difficult than it turned out to be, this whole DLC has been a let down, if they expect high level players to stick around they need to give us content to do, the 2 new side quests were miles better than the burrows and went even mentioned, and I had the entirety of todays new content wiped out in 2 hours, no matter what I love this game but theres just nothing left to do
---
If you're going to comment something, least try to be accurate.
---
You seem to be confused, you're not playing ESO, this is Fallout 76.  ESO is developed by Zenimax Online Studios.  Fallout 76 is developed by Bethesda Game Studios.  How Zenimax develops and brands its content has absolutely nothing to do with how BGS develops and brands its.
---
Challenges won't give you atoms because are camera related but the camera will release in a month XD
---
Again u r the one who compared ESO and fallout. Not I. üòÇüòÇ
---
You r a joke. This thread is a joke.
---
It‚Äôs more than likely because you have mods or have modified some files
---
They replaced the whole team
---
My favorite is when they drop a drill and it's not even Legendary, then you sit at the item drop list waiting for a minute or 2 for a legendary item to appear, deep down you know it won't appear, but we are all guilty of waiting to see if it will. Hope is everything in FO76, drives every single player to turn on their consoles or PC's to play and hope for a God Roll something that will change the game and make surviving just that much easier or fun.
---
Or poses while sitting! 
---
It sucks I've got a screenshot of me sat &gt;!in the burrows, on a throne, surrounded by charred ferals and fire, and I look like I'm having an awkward shit in an unfamiliar toilet!&lt;
---
Just a thought Bethesda
---
Your idea of endgame content is seriously something that only requires two level 50 characters?
---
Oh it will get 'rebalanced' as soon as they can get onto it.
---
The saving grace might be that they seem to be behind schedule on a couple of 'major' things, but for something like this? They might make time.
---
I would say that your advice is sound. Something as juicy as this, that stands out from the otherwise bland standardised monotony, is not meant to last.
---
It just has it all. A killfest in the sewers - that do not even require PA - and plenty of sources of Violet and Crimson if you place the nuke right.
---
Just too good to last.
---
Not really Bethesda‚Äôs fault you have üí©üí© Internet speed fam. That would be like blaming your bank for being broke
---
To fine tune your perks you need to be thinking, "Can I achieve this another way, can I sidestep the need for this perk and especially do I need it active all the time?"
---
Carry weight is a waste. I know it seems like the most annoying thing to be overencumbered as low level but those four points could all improve damage for your chosen weapon instead.
---
Choose perks with non-mutable effects, ie. ones you can't get somehow anyway. Time of day perks are dead 50% of the time. Pick a weapon that you enjoy and make every perk point support that playstyle. You will be amazed at how much more enjoyable the game is.
---
Would love to have it.üòä
---
Even better. üòÇüòÇ
---
And if anyone is a dumbass. It is clearly you. How does it smell with your head so far up your ass?
---
Never
---
Screws!
---
I was really hoping for some high leveled Snallygasters, I think they'd fit in just fine down there.
---
The first "dungeon" (with the golden claw) in Skyrim is more in depth than the Burrows. lol
---
Oh my god... you... you do realize that The Elder Scrolls franchise is more than Elder Scrolls online right?  If someone says "The Elder Scrolls" they're talking about Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim... not Zenimax's fucking mmo spinoff.
---
Rerolling takes a long time to get everything optimized
---
It could be like a drug, you eat corpses and get addicted to flesh, you get a buff when there is flesh in your belly and a debuff when you haven't eaten for say 15 mins and it can be cure by not eating flesh for 3 real hours. Love the idea, I've been using cannibal since beta :D
---
Can we turn into brahmin and have other players milk us too when we eat brahmin meat? Jokes aside, maybe there could be a chance for the perk to frenzy you with some sort of buff included. The down side is that if you want to remain frenzied you must continue to feast and the more you feast the harder it is to maintain the buff.  Wendigo cannot satisfy their hunger after all. I don't really think this is something that should be added but that's an idea.
---
Seriously the best event. Could have been a little harder with the sloth but it was great fun.
---
Could be... without a proper look at the esm by a 'trained eye' is hard to tell though.
---
Either way I can see how this is a bummer. Even un-nuked that place is quite nice (if you can get a shot in that is, unsurprisingly it was heavily camped when I visited).
---
With vendors giving you 50% reduction in caps.  (They dont like you)
---
They could add a bank somewhere and have robots plodding around inside :)
---
Yeah... would have been nice if they instanced it. Still, a better variety to the farm than running whitesprings in the opposite direction.
---
I just want a proper respec system. Don't even care if i have to pay an escalated cost everytime, once you're past 150 levelling's tedious, takes about a week non stop XP bashing just to change special then level up any perks you needed.
---
Mutants legendary could use a change. 10% buff is doodoo, i'd rather a 2-3% damage/resistance boost PER mutation
---
my expectations were at an all time low due to the horrific state of the video game industry and fallout 76 STILL disappointed myself and everyone i know. the game is an utter travesty and the epitome of why the current video game industry is a cesspool of miserable failure and anti-consumer practices
---
Might need to retweek everything but this is my first character. Thanks for the advice.
---
Damn, why are people like this in every fucking corner?
---
FUCK SOCIETY.
---
If they want it to be successful, they need to be much bigger, but enough so that you can get lost way easier and make many more of them. And fast
---
Hey if your not using them brass knuckles I am working on my unarmed build and would appreciate any help.
---
Kinda dumb question but can you nuke anywhere? Ive not really followed many quest but misc. And side ones yet.
---
Well thats utter shit
---
The roll on it was garbage too
---
Like I said. Every bit helps
---
I went into every alcove I could find. I read every note I found. Looked at every terminal. I scavenged every piece of plastic and lead I could find (came out with nearly 100 plastic, so that was the best part). I accidentally beat the quest in at the very most less than 10 minutes. Sure, if I counted every brick down there it might have taken hours, but I didn't, and if you did you seriously need to reconsider your life. 
---
Mostly I think nearly everyone has been happy with the new releases. Biv was pretty fun for the first 10 or so times. Having to craft literally hundreds of drinks was annoying but eh, other people I guess liked it? I do like some of the new recipes. I LOVE the Lemonade Bot, he's great. 
---
I really enjoyed Lying Lowe. I love the taxidermy decorations. I enjoyed having a few new quests to do, even if they were rather short. I actually like fighting the Imposter. I wish it took a little bit longer so more people could get there, and have time to dump junk before heading over, but ah well about that. 
---
Renaming stuff is ok, I don't have much use for it myself, my only issue relating to named gear is whether  I can accidentally sell it or scrap it, and renaming doesn't help with either of those at all. Bug fixes are great, but they often bring back old bugs, or create whole new ones. Are we not supposed to mention those? I mean, if no one mentioned bugs, they'd never get fixed?
---
 The only one I've seen any complaint about is the new "dungeon" which was released today. 
---
**You** said it was to bring players back. "they want players to come back and try it", and I reiterate, if a user was on the fence, and came back because they heard about a new dungeon, they would be VERY disappointed.
---
Thats what brings the difficulty right? You onow the tried and true, dabble a little.
---
To quote you...
---
‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs from elder scrolls or fallout franchise THIS is what a ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù is.‚Äù
---
Your statement not mine. You do realize this is a multiple player game and not single player. Right üòÇüòÇ
---
finally I can make stationary based off of a fictional soup factory from a video game
---
Complainers.
---
As it should be. Traitors don't deserve any better. God bless America.
---
Several of my kills also melted üò≠ away.
---
100% need this, i had a moment in survival where me an a friend was levelling up at workshops on our fresh alts, i'm 46 an he's 15, an a pack of 4 150+ turn up an kill us/break the workshop so me being salty thought "ok. 196 bloodied mains coming out" i rejoin the world, go back to the workshop an i see a red blip, i immediately think it's them, Marsupial jump an spam combat shotgun to stagger him, an i notice i downed a level 15, felt so guilty, he emotes an asked for help an i just couldn't revive him, i left his bag but he didn't come back.
---
If you're out there... i'm sorry.
---
People posted screenshots wearing the rare masks. Then other people said it was not proof enough.
---
People posted videos wearing the rare masks. Then people said it was not proof enough.
---
Yeah, there was no proof, because people wanted god to descend from the heavens and proclaim the rare masks as part of a new commandment.
---
Yeah, they were rarer than they should, but they are out there.
---
While i was disappointed with the burrows, i don't think it's fair to compare a new mission every 2 weeks or so, to a dlc they spend months developing in 1 large release. Don't get me wrong, like i said I was disappointed today, but I'm fine with getting a relatively steady stream of things to do over time, even if some of them fall flat
---
I didn't get the update yet? when I try to access the new zone it says inaccessible, is it going to be released later for all or it's an event with a cooldown period
---
I dont have God tier legendaries, I do have legendaries, but no tse or anything close to God tier, I do explore areas and read terminals, I love the holotapes as it gives me the story at the same time I explore the area
---
What's the point of adding in new level content when theres already tonnes of it, if people didnt enjoy the old low level content they're not gunna enjoy the new stuff, why would people sink money into a game when no one stays with the game, they said they want this game to last 5 years iirc, and the only way that's gunna happen is by trying to keep people around for as long as possible not by bringing in new players every 6 months, they need to appeal to high level characters and try get them to stay once they've finished the base game but theres nothing there
---
3 hours of content isnt going to make a difference to a low level when theres already 100 hours of content
---
Please, just continue digging yourself deeper on this.  
---
I'm still laughing and trying to figure out whether you just think Bethesda developed ESO or if you seriously don't know what the ACTUAL Elder Scrolls franchise is.
---
See what you've said here? Vats stealth rifle build. It's designed to do a shitload of damage without engaging directly in a fire fight. Of course its no challenge.
---
Gotta turn the valve each time I believe.
---
But we are reliving the same day...everyday in game...we've relieved the SBQ countless times..etc
---
Good advice. But people are selfish. They won‚Äôt change. Some will but they‚Äôll be the ones to lose out. 
---
But yes good advice
---
I don't have a God or OP build and it still wasn't challenging.
---
For real.
---
We need rare/ultra items and shitty common items, this does the job just fine. Trust me it'll be worth it when you hit the jackpot. it wouldn't be so fucked up if so many people didn't dupe really good weapons.  You see loads of people walking around with godly stuff whilst you're getting crap, well chances are they probably exploited the game in one way or another. Sadly, that raises other players expectations and they just feel fucked over by the RNG .
---
You don't need to be a miner to dig a hole,just as you don't need to be a plumber to recognize a piece of shit.
---
Sure, then let's have Fasnacht every single day and give up on Easter events, on Halloween or Christmas. Sounds good to you?
---
Congrats, the first time you kill this beast it sure feels very challenging and awesome. You will eventually get soon to a point where you can kill them in 10 seconds when you find better gear/build.
---
Now for the real challegmge go tackle that new dungeon "burrows" /s
---
Haha
---
How do you get this stealth rifle? Sorry kinda new
---
There's three ways this may play out:
---
* leave it as is
---
* fix the dungeon to make it a challenge
---
* nerf weapons and perks
---
Keep defending the 15mins of content they added. 
---
Thats the hole you r digging.
---
I've been wondering a lot lately if anyone working over there has ever even played a video game before.
---
Floor decor. I think if you scroll down on the tab it should be the one with the plant and mini vault boy statue.
---
i couldnt find them either
---
I did. There was no computer when I returned so I turned the valve anyway. No computer spawned.
---
My build isnt near op or god, and it was still a 10 minute breeze
---
I've got a Vampire's shotty and I love Sheepsquatch event lol
---
Probabky was nuked.
---
Serendipity in luck is must for bloodied builds
---
Definitely not.
---
They could have done a great Easter egg hunt in the game with this. Random eggs dropping every so often around the waste land and if you're lucky enough to run into one of them you get some moderately cool loot.
---
Shidddd idk
---
I experienced the same. You can also get more when nuking the area. Many people just have bad luck I suppose which is why I've seen a lot of hate on it. I mean, the burrows wasn't even a picture in the roadmap. Why did people expect too much of it?
---
Here's a challenge, do it with a pipe pistol
---
I was hoping for more, but it was an interesting little snack to chew on. A couple cap stashes, bunch of ghouls. The place was cleaned spotless by the time I got there unfortunately. I'll like to know what was sitting out.
---
It won't.  Steam charges 30% premium for listing all games.   Bethesda specifically added it to their launcher for a reason.
---
It‚Äôs possible that you did see it before the patch. I found the sheepsquatch trap in my first few days of playing well before that content got released.
---
I think if every 3 Star enemy guaranteed to drop a 3 Star Legendary there would be way too many. 
---
The point of 3 Stars is that they're meant to be rare. Ive only got 1 really good drop, but if everyone had this item it would ruin the game.
---
Yeah the main thing that keeps me coming back, is looking for better gear for PvP. I just really enjoy that aspect. Looking forward to see what changes. :)
---
Those new events can be added in as well, there will never be too many choices on what to do next...
---
The Burrows wasn't even pictured in the Roadmap! It was supposed to be a side thing added with the camera update. People just expect too much out of some things. I personally loved it. Especially the story.
---
People still play this? Lmao
---
Does is work in PA?
---
What points should I move?
---
BGS do have some difficulty in understanding common concepts or words.
---
&gt;Creatures will sometimes band together in a Horde, led by a powerful Alpha creature. Defeat the Alpha to stop the Horde from spawning more creatures.
---
Powerful Alpha? Ok, it is legendary so a bit tougher than normal because it has double health pool. Powerful? Not really, there is no added danger from damage or any different mechanics or tactics.
---
&gt;Using a collected Vault Boy bobblehead will grant a significant, long-term (though temporary) bonus, like an increase to a SPECIAL attribute.
---
Significant, long-term (though temporary) bonus? 
---
Significant? A +2 or +20% isn't really significant, it's good bonus but calling it significant is a real stretch. 
---
Long-term? 1 hour is not really a long-term. 1 day would be long term even 6 hours would be a long-term. How many play more than 1 hour in single session? I'd say most gamers do that.
---
&gt;The Alien Blaster is a powerful energy beam weapon that can completely disintegrate enemies.
---
A powerful energy beam that can completely disintegrate enemies? Wow, just WOW. I can't even comment on that.
---
Those quotes are all from Fallout 76 in game loading screens, that are meant to give helpful tips on players. You can't say that this is marketing making them as these were put out by development team.
---
So, taking all of these to consideration it should not have been a surprise on what a lackluster "dungeon" we got.
---
Now to the word Dungeon. It has been stated many times in this post and others like it that dungeon means many things to different players and in different games. So the use of the word by BGS does not match my idea what it was giving us. The game all ready has a proper dungeon (Glassed caverns) and I was making my assumptions based on that. The end result we were given is a long way backwards from that dungeon. 
---
Yes, I'm guilty by over hyping it to myself but I was making an educated ques considering what BGS had told us and what was all ready in game. If this is their idea of challenging content then the game really has no end game and no future. I really should have given up like all my friends did six months ago. 
---
I'm now dreading what their idea of Raid is. An open world area of dozen rooms with an actual end boss of 1\* legendary stats? No tactics, no preparation needed, just half a dozen guys spraying bullets for 10 minutes?
---
There are hundreds of thousands different dungeons and raids and bosses and challenges they could look in the internet. They could watch those and take hints and ideas and make it Fallout style. But instead BGS has them making new outfits and CAMP skins.
---
Watch  nuking video by rifle gaming on YouTube, he's definitely impressed :)
---
https://youtu.be/febXtTmRM2U
---
It's always a great joy taking down the first. :)
---
Got 11 1 stars out of maybe 40 ghouls.  Someone had just cleared most of it.  Got some off of non legendaries.  Had one 'ghost' ghoul stay alive and walk around.  I could loot him and hit him but not kill him(again).  Wish I had vid, he walked through walls.
---
I've literally never gotten a duped weapon or armor or anything. Nor am I bloodied. 
---
I'm beginning to wonder what kind of cluster fuck builds people have if they think anyone able to get through this "dungeon" must have duped gear, though.
---
The new whitesprings eh
---
IF you went through it and ran into a dozen level 60+ ghouls that doesn't mean it was unscaled OR that it was designed to be too easy, all it means is you were walking through someone's leftovers.  
---
This is what happens when Bethesda made the change to not force respawns on interiors when a new player arrives, the high level ahead of you didn't have to deal with your respawns but you didn't have any fresh spawns to deal with either.  There's WAY more than 15 ghouls in the entire dungeon.
---
Lying Lowe seemed more substantial because they didn't actually have to put as much work into it, the entire thing was just running errands between already existing open world spots on the map with the taxidermists at the start being the only substantial thing that had to be added.  A hell of a lot more work than that went into creating a far more massive interior cell like the Burrows.
---
The trailer doesn't imply anything about endgame content, all it implies is that we're getting some new interior cells, you're inferring that those cells will be endgame content and you shouldn't be.
---
\^\^ haha this
---
&gt;Tfw my camp ~is~ was on the bridge leaving Harper's :(
---
Ftfy
---
You probably already went in there but I can say it's pretty good for junk, I got a lot of plastic out of there.
---
Photo evidence: https://i.imgur.com/5CA6URG.jpg
---
Tried it out today
---
Apparently its amazing when its nuked. Its the new whitesprings. Checkout rifle gaming on yt. He made a video about it.
---
I completed the Burrows for the first time on my own at level 36. That doesn't seem like it should be possible. The majority of enemies I faced were ghouls who I could just cripple with my shotgun and then finish off. The assaultron wasn't even that bad for me as I just hit it a few times with The Dragon. 
---
It's a shame that the Assaultron wasn't legendary. I think a couple of extra prefixs to it could've shook things up a bit, thought to be honest, between this and the Sheepsquatch I'm a little worn out by them. 
---
This new location is called The Burrows. I expected to be fighting creatures and risking disease constantly, not a tunnel filled with ghouls before a relatively easy fight with an assaultron.
---
I was thinking maybe the iron clad points?
---
You don't have to level up 3 times, you have to level up meeting 3 conditions. It's pretty easy to do on a single level up
---
 Best thing is that you dont even need to search for them because you hear them  &lt;a href="[http://www.aluminium-sheet-hw.com/list/?164\_1.html](http://www.aluminium-sheet-hw.com/list/?164_1.html)"&gt;5083-h32 aluminum sheet&lt;/a&gt;
---
Why tf is there even wood armour in the game?? 
---
Fallout 76 has introduced some stupid items.
---
I have seen this stupid defence more times then I can count. Decent 3 star drops are practically non existant at this point and make it feel completely unrewarding. On top of that you can literally buy and legendary you want to so there's no point in keeping them rare, you think the game dropped me 8 of my TSE weapons, hell no I bought them all for pretty cheap there is no reason not to make it to where 3 stars are guaranteed no reason at all.
---
Melee or rifle build? I‚Äôd switch back &amp; forth but if it works!
---
If ppl want a challenge, go in naked with a machete
---
That's crazy. I had one walk out of a solid wall, but I smoked his ass like a coffin nail.
---
Just tell your other two that the perp has given you unwanted behavior on multiple occasions and you will not play with this guy anymore.
---
The two other people will have to make a decision who they would rather group with on their own.
---
I also had this ghost ghoul it was very strange
---
Well said
---
People, if you want a good chuckle then read through the reply chain i have with this guy here, at one point I mention The Elder Scrolls games alongside Fallout and they seriously don't know the difference between the actual TES franchise and Elder Scrolls Online and from my pov at least it gets pretty funny.
---
So you want to experience Fasnacht, Halloween, Easter, Christmas all at the same time? I hope that you do realize that the appeal to all of those events, both in-game and in real life is only because they're yearly events. 
---
If you could dress up for Halloween every single day then it will become boring. Christmas is so special because it's only once every year. Making such events a daily thing it would ruin their magic, their appeal.
---
Besides, i have lots of fasnacht masks i plan on selling in a few months. Making it a daily event would lower the value of my masks.
---
Fallout is capped at 50.  Rest of levels just allows for Respec is all.
---
Same, though I went solo i liked going through all the nooks and crannies
---
Yes please see what an idiot the OP is....
---
That's not Bethesda. That's Obsidian.
---
Thanks for the effort man!
---
They're missing a comma. It should be stealth, rifle build. All that means is they've spent their levels on perks in Agility, Perception, and Luck for stealth and rifle perks. It's a pretty effective way to play.
---
I wouldn't say it was the right thing,  But there's no doubt that it's Bethesda's standard business practice.
---
Not at all. Just pointing out the idiocy of you shouting "straw man" at someone that merely told you to check your information.
---
Ohhh I have all mine spent in strength:/
---
I saw this the other day and thought wtf Bethesda. üòÇ
---
No, did I say that?
---
If that was your take from that, then sorry for miscommunication.
---
Endgame content should be aimed at the endgame levels and that means level 50+. The content should be diverse enough so that there is content available for solo, duo and 10+ groups, with rewards scaling the more challenging it is.
---
So you already have everything item wise you could want, you are probably at caps limit, but you refuse to roll a new character because it would give you something to do other than farm gear you don't need which only pisses you off when you get something you don't want despite the fact that you have no use for it.
---
Why are people downvoting this? 
---
I don‚Äôt have any builds or specific play style. At the moment, level 77,  I use a Tesla, All Rise, and full PA. 
---
I beat the burrows in 20 minutes by accident when I was just trying to fully explore. The Sheepsquatch on the other hand is the most balanced boss I‚Äôve fought yet. It‚Äôs hard, people die, and it‚Äôs fun. 
---
The burrows was not fun... it had nothing challenging in it. I only used one stimpack the entire time and it was against the ‚Äòboss‚Äô.
---
... Or just have all the legendary items laying on the ground so you don't have to work at anything.
---
Better yet, just start giving everyone a legendary item in their inventory every 5 minutes while I go AFK.
---
r/lostredditors or you are a cunt for posting this here
---
'Dungeon' size: 5/10
---
'Dungeon' layout: 8/10
---
Story: 2/10
---
Difficulty: 1/10
---
Reward: 1/10
---
Fun:  0/10
---
I feel the layout and design is actually pretty decent.
---
The 2 minute quest was trash. 
---
Difficulty is low to mid tier SOLO.
---
Reward probably what i expected now considering the actual length and difficulty of the quest.
---
I didn't have much fun on my main or alt but could see there being fun in it as a lower 30-40 maybe (probably lees depending on experience and build) level team.
---
If anything being scaled makes it worse meaning it's even further from hard, and sure maybe there was 20 to 30 ghouls but still not a challenge 
---
And I imagine the making of the burrows took ages, it is a decent looking area, although nothing spectacular 
---
Lying lowe was better because it had more lore, better characters and better objectives, the burrows was essentially get to the end and kill an assault assaultron 
---
And sure maybe they never explicitly said end game content but what's the point in adding more content for low levels, there is so much already in the game, so why add more in the first place? If they want people to stick around and waste money on atom shop items that are way more expensive than necessary they need to give us a reason to stay,
---
Two level 50 characters aren't "endgame" ready. They probably don't have an optimized armor yet, they certainly don't have god-tier weapons of their level. 
---
To be real, you could be level 50 and still not have some of the perks required for your build. 
---
But in any case, you got to understand that the few thousand people on this sub represent a higher-than-average level playerbase. The casual player is NOT on the game every single day for multiple hours, knowing every inch of the map, and for that player, a dungeon requiring half an hour of game with multiple ennemies IS interesting, good and difficult.
---
Not sure if it works with PA but ironclad is not worth it considering you only get 50 dr and er when maxed out and thats 5 points
---
I saw the out of the wall ones too.  Charred ghouls so they were hard to see against the gre/ay tunnel walls.  It seemed like the spawns were really random, maybe because it had just been mostly cleared.
---
Fair enough, it seemed like one
---
In a financial sort of sense yes. They did well they hyped up and people fooled or not bought into it. 
---
It‚Äôs any business practice.
---
Didn‚Äôt someone datamine that there is an actual Sheepsquatche model in game?
---
Workshops were designed to cause players to be flagged for pvp in exchange for access to the location for fast travel as well as collect the specific resources that are available. 
---
Pay caps = Control Workshop/Access to resources/Flag self for potential pvp
---
Literally the game working as intended. You want that junk? Maybe just go farm it like everyone else slowly through manual collection or else be willing to pay the cost of claiming a Workshop. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Jesus. One of the bots slipped thru! Snipers take it down.
---
It doesn't work in PA.
---
Ok sweet, unfortunately haven‚Äôt had the pleasure myself yet. Still be another 4hrs before I am able. Even if it‚Äôs an instanced exp gain I‚Äôll be happy :)
---
Once you reach level 50 the only way to get stronger is perfecting your build and farming legendaries, 50+ is definitely considered endgame
---
When it becomes free to play  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
This isn't wow, there is no level cap and no end game. You really want a challenge ? Ditch the min maxing, meta builds and legendary farming. Finished it already? Try a different build. There are so many perk combos to try...
---
I don't have an OP  build. I have a "meh" build of mostly 1 star gear. I literally finished the new dungeon by accident because it was that damn easy.
---
We must be 'fake gamers' for enjoying ourselves
---
You don't think that if every player had a full set of 3 Star armour and a TSE it would spoil the game? 
---
I do agree that DECENT 3 Star drops are pretty non existent though. Like I said, I think I've got 1. 
---
Eventually they will bring out 5 Star, or a way to upgrade current gear to 5, so 3 Star drops will probably be more common. Also Legendary Power Armour. 
---
Also, can you please PM me the best place to buy?
---
Same
---
Same, found 10* half on non legendary ghouls and 2***, none of it any good.
---
Floor, over from Deathclaw statue.
---
People think its just Todd up there, designing, programming and marketing everything
---
Yeah, it's neat to explore and a nice junk haul. I hope you have a good time. :)
---
In that case I can only assume it was a stealth nerf for farming.
---
Yeah but you don't have any idea what a hole even looks like in this case. If you had ever written some code in your life you would know that it's not adjusting a few sliders.
---
Whether or not it was in your head, that still sounds awesome. Let‚Äôs hope the encounter is as terrifying as this sounds.
---
Thank you and thanks for taking the time to respond. Appreciate it!
---
Get the rope.
---
"end game" is level 50. You can have a maxed out build at 50, stats, perks, and mutations wise. 
---
Acting like level 50 is "early" is fucking nuts.
---
Sorry I was super short and not specific in my response. 
---
I meant we had this happen. Trying to fix it we chose to exit and re-enter, hit the valve then head back to the computer. It didn‚Äôt show up right away but it did after a minute or two.
---
The bes content added over theast week has introduced new/old bugs and some stability problems. It should be fixed soon.
---
i have the same issuse. they improved it a lot , at launch it was nearly unplayable. Still SBQ is some what a challenge
---
Okay thanks :)
---
I just don't look into the details.
---
I hear base feature info like,
---
*"We're adding a dungeon!"*
---
And that's all I see, if even that much. I load in, happen upon the content, and I sit there in ecstasy over new free atuff. Then I see all over Reddit, people shitting their pants over how "fucking garbage" it is "in comparison" or some shit like that - a real bummer tbh.
---
It's a sad truth that it's hard to be let down if you don't expect anything in the first place, but it's helped me come to terms with the game's rocky launch and really just allows me to have loads of fun.
---
Stay safe out there, wastelanders.
---
Who‚Äôs this Charlie kelly you speak of
---
I legit LOL'D at this good stuff hah
---
something tells me this bot picked up someone talking about aluminum and thought this was some sort of metal working reddit
---
I like #2 honestly.
---
wdym irl
---
They never said "unique loot" , just "plenty of it". You got item on each ghoul, so that's "plenty of loot". 
---
And if you had no issue doing the dungeon, you can't receive incredible loot. This is schrodinger's complaint.
---
Np :D
---
Mine was crazy laggy on PS4 today- seemed like just a handful of frames per second. It was almost like playing a filmstrip. Otherwise, though, it‚Äôs been pretty good. (Could be because there were two active nuke zones, causing the chaos)
---
3 is the answer we really need
---
First time I saw this, I almost pressed the button to pick up the Radbear for my collection, then I saw the other one and went ‚ÄúOh! Oh, god... I‚Äôm so sorry, you‚Äôre trying to get some privacy back here... I‚Äôll leave you both to it...‚Äù and walked away.
---
A couple of months later, I‚Äôm thinking to myself, ‚ÄúThose were two inanimate objects. Why did I hesitate in picking them up?‚Äù
---
Then again, in the Fallout universe you can never quite tell what‚Äôs secretly sentient and what‚Äôs been thematically placed everywhere... there‚Äôs lots of places where teddy bears and Mr. Fuzzy‚Äôs are placed in conspicuously life-like ways. The same goes for garden gnomes and mannequins, especially in Fallouts 3 and 4...
---
All we can really say for sure is, many server hops and hours of gameplay later, these two bears are still at it.
---
Those would be great too, they remind me of centaurs and feel fallout-y.
---
melee builds are super good too
---
i got one lol
---
I'm level 240+. I walked in with a suit is T-60 and a 3* Gatling Gun I found last week. And pretty much shredded the entire dungeon. I don't think I have any OP build, just all the heavy gunner perks, tenderizer, stabilized, and bloody mess for damage boosters. I just listened to the rhythmic thump, thump, thump of the Gatling Gun and everything fell over.
---
Yeah,  they shit the bed on that one. A new camera/photo mode was set to release along side the new Burrows quest, but they pushed it back a couple of weeks &amp; forgot to switch the challenges.  Kinda pissed me off cuz I farm atoms and totally got screwed today.
---
I understand. I'm lvl 154 and I don't have optimized armor or god tier weapons (Never seen a TSE and only 2 TS weapons since Beta).
---
My perks are undergoing a change as I'm switching a build so they are far from being optimal at the moment, and will be so for at least next ten levels.
---
But the game has a level cap on stats and equipment. That level cap at the moment is 50. So that is the end game level cap as there are no more higher items available. As soon as you get to 50 you can use any and all items and perks in the game, if you have them.
---
Getting them is a matter of end game content, that content should allow you a chance for those items and perks and not be a requirement for that.
---
C'est la vie, move on, kill more, just keep rolling the dice! I know it's frustrating sometimes but I think it might be a bit boring if everyone's dropping God roll 3* from every mob. Learn to enjoy the disappointment, once you can laugh at that 1* but of wood armour you dropped, it gets a little easier to bear!
---
This is gameplay improvement idea #2,745,874 posted on this thread.
---
Bethesda: "I know what the players want! Beverage crafting and repair kits!!!"
---
That's my experience as well.
---
I started the fight by misclicking the option on the computer, and immediately saw the impostor outside. 
---
I ran to a pylon because I read this sub and the text in the computer, and tried to do shit but got OS immediately. When I came back after respawning, there was a level 27x, a few 1xx, and a lot of 35 to 50 running around.
---
I died around 20 times because the sheepsquatch ran from a player to the other one shotting us, with everybody just shooting at it while blatanlty ignoring the "activate a pylon" messages. 
---
In the end I got a troubleshooter wood leg (1 star), so emblematic of the meme that I almost laughed. Almost.
---
Then I went to West tek, met 12 legendaries among which 2 or 3 *** and got a lot of (still shitty) loot. *shrugs*
---
I was considering grabbing one as a heavy gunner, just because carrying 4000+ 50 cal rounds is already my jam.
---
Otherwise its definitely nothing to write home about.
---
I had a dream were a deathclaw made its way into my bedroom it ended differently though
---
For real. Even my alt which is built to use guns in stealth still does so much more damage with melee weapons.
---
Your title claims "you overhyped yourself" but your post says "did they maybe hype the difficulty a bit too much? Sure, but that's what a marketing department is supposed to do."
---
Which is it?
---
i can say ive never once gotten ANYTHING at worthwhile from any legendary and ive killed a fair amount of them. The sheer amount of nocturnal and auto stim and hunter's whatever shit item its on is astounding. Never once have i fought a legendary enemy and was even remotely satisfied with the loot. 99% of the the garbage is just left in the  body.
---
My experience too, got a 3star and like 10 1stars
---
So true, the idea that people should be punished for investing time in the game and understanding game mechanics is ridiculous. You don't see ESO players having to do that.
---
Connect a wall and a foundation to the sloped piece, then try to remove the roof first, then the sloped wall. Walls and roofs always need a foundation but there seems to be a bug with doorways which allows you to disconnect them from foundations.
---
Exactly. People here assuming were 'too geared' for it and that's why it's easy. The reason the difficulty is so disappointing is because we've all been playing the game and know it could've been way harder.
---
Hotfix please
---
I have no idea what point you are trying to make. Comparing a TSE shotgun with nothing else to a rifle with sneak vats criticals isn't even a fair comparison. And it not being useful in pvp has nothing to do with how a weapon handles pve mobs. I agree that there are better builds out there now, but you are going to have a hard time finding anything in this game difficult with a TSE shotgun if you have put any effort at all into perk cards
---
it was spiked and chained
---
I wouldn't sell The Gutter quite yet. It has  legendary effects without having any stars, so if we (as it has been theorized) will be able to pay legendary-tokens for "adding" legendary effects into new items, this could potentially be really good with three carefully picked legendary effects too. It would be an assaultron blade that is effectively a 4\*. Might be wrong, but I am holding on to mine until after the Legendary vendor system is out.
---
That said, I agree completely about the quest, was awesome and the jump scare was well done.
---
These ghouls are the same level you find at White springs.. You can slice through them with anything.. No challenge at all
---
Pictures or it didn't happen
---
Pretending that inside the vault is a commercial on TV is pretty dishonest. All communication coming from the dev team isn't marketing.
---
I was excited for it. My group was and we all went through it and came out in bad moods with how disappointing and fast it was. The story behind what happened to the brotherhood was shit. Some entitled loser trapped them down there and did whatever with them. I thought we were gonna find the tentacle monster from the lucky hole mine or some new creature but no, just robots and ghouls. The game is still broken and we got a disappointing new area to explore :)
---
I like having options Haha
---
It usually works.
---
I'm liking it.  I just didn't know if it could be improved
---
&gt;"the casual gamer"
---
This is the crux isn't it? Almost no one that frequents a Reddit or Forum for a game would fall under the title Casual Gamer. Even me, who played at launch and for a total of 3 months now (Due to a break) with a lvl 85 Main, and the only Multi-star Legendry being All Rise, would not fall under that title. I see it on EVERY forum and Reddit for a game, the posters bemoaning the "true casuals" for ruining the game, because the game has to be balanced to them and not the posters.
---
We, the people who post here are NOT the player base. The people with characters of lvl 200+ TSE's or whatever the current Meta buils is, DO NOT represent the player base, and the people that post here need to, but never seem to, understand this.
---
This makes me happy I will be away for 5 days, I can do without the rabbit head.
---
I dread missing any limited time outfits or skins though
---
I bet the actual cryptid is hidden in a vault surrounded by pot noodles, and drawing anime girls on the wall.
---
So you are ok with a "live-service" game out for nearly 6 months without any meaningful endgame content?
---
Ha! Now I know why my camp couldn't be placed. An invasion of plushie bunnies.
---
Gamer tag is MR420JohnnyB
---
The enemies are so under utilized in this game. I would've liked to find some harder 'dungeons' (i guess were using that term loosely now), things like the deathclaw sanctuary in Fallout 3, or a huge nest full off honey beasts and giant ants. Speaking of ants, where are the queens at?
---
Like, I think I remember one of the devs in that documentary thing saying the wasteland would be wilder and crazier because it's sooner after the bombs dropped. Yeah, a group of 3 medium sized ants trying to nibble my toes, now that's wild.
---
Why the downvotes, he's not really wrong if you don't count the occupation of enemy NPC's.
---
I kind of have the feeling that they didn't want to spend money on animating human characters faces.
---
Haha cool idea but then ppl would complain they didnt get something. U know how it goes!
---
950+ hours in still have yet to see one, same goes for both of my team-mates who have also been playing since the BETA. We have close to 2,5000 hours between us in this game. *not one* TSE
---
Sorry buddy, but this is the most pathetic excuse I have heard in long time... Why dont we make it challenge like match 2 of the same colour? And why the hell should be dungeon something accesible for noobies ? There is so much other stuff to do in the game...
---
Nosferatu anyone? I get the feeling alot of the people on here play skyrim and ESO! I noticed they always make suggestions and comparisons from the ES series?
---
feel the same about the nuke silo. stupid easy.
---
do you want another one? I'll even throw in a Fixer .
---
You don't need any legendary weapon or armor to do this. A low level can do it. They lied and didn't even fix the bugs from last patch.
---
The only good legendary items I‚Äôve ever gotten were All Rise, which everyone gets, and a couple days ago a Vampiric something Tesla Rifle. 
---
It‚Äôs the first good legendary I‚Äôve gotten after playing since day one Beta...
---
Barrel type
---
Still, you say the community overhyped this sorry excuse of a "dungeon", then you say that their "MARKETING" team overhyped it. which is it ffs? 
---
And if the marketing team, which is employed by BETHESDA overhyped a piece of content, why wouldn't a community manager from Beth chime in and temper expectations?
---
They should have also done that if they had paid any attention to reddit (or any online community regarding the game for that matter) and saw the community's hype of something that they knew EXACTLY would not reach the level the community was expecting.
---
Came to make sure I wasn't crazy. Have "Craft Camera Film (0/24)" and "Mod a Camera with a Lens" Daily Challenges yet no camera. *sigh*
---
My first Scorched Beast was when me and a friend stumbled across a fissure in the Ash Heap. I didn't know what the minimap icon was / meant until all hell broke loose.
---
Had to tank a lot of stim packs. üòÖ

Hehe it's getting clooooserrrr. We're going to start seeing them pop up soooon

You could always switch -but that takes a bit of time each time
---
The Instanced raids are down the road map.
---
I‚Äôve had it since the beta but am definitely one of those who abandoned ship until they came out with a few patches. Just recently got back into and it does still feel like you see a handful of players who seem to know what they‚Äôre doing. But as you said I doubt there‚Äôs anyone who knows everything with any kind of certainty.
---

---
Thanks.
---
Fireproof helps a ton. I have two ranks and the sonic attacks don‚Äôt even phase me anymore- I just passed level 50. If I don‚Äôt feel like dealing with it I‚Äôll hide until they forget about me. Otherwise, pull out a rifle and hope for the best!

[Jump to slap bang on 50 minutes](https://youtu.be/rfyViQ9Uo_M)
---
Hey mark this as a spoiler! Not everyone wants to be spoiled about it. Also you are correct you get the ability to craft it if you can make all 6 eggs
---
1. More enemies in groups, but with a shorter agro range. Allows you to pack dungeons but not have 50 mobs on you at once.
---
2. Trash mobs need more abilities. Poison clouds, guard mobs with higher stealth detection, glowing ones with the aoe rez from fo4.
---
3.  More advanced mob types. Sewer Mutants, Gutter Ghouls, larger rad rats and rad toads in the water.
---
4. Final fight should have been more of an event like the robot DLC in fo4.
---
Do you mean nuked?
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
I agree. Not only was it spoiling but it's  banded together some very entitled whiners I dont  miss that couldn't  read a roadmap if it was pinned to the top of a subreddit. I get that this quest was weaker than hoped for but then take a break from the game  and flush your toxicity down the toilet if you have nothing constructive to add.
---
Yeah, I'd guess that Bethesda has plans to implement them in brewing/daily questing; but I don't want to be expecting too much here.
---
The star roll is annoying, yes. What pisses me off the most is having a level 92 10 CHR/15 LUK character kill a 3\* lvl 68 legendary super mutant (along with its entire horde) and getting a level 35 drop. Level 52 Gutsy 3\*? level 40 drop. The entire point of a LOOTER is to GET LOOT.
---
In the data files the burrows is referenced in places as ud002. Ud001 is the arktos biome lab which hasn't been unlocked yet but I agree with you neither are real dungeons. Not gonna get those until vault raids
---
y lets go solo without gear without weapons and with a lvl 1 charackter this coud be an experience ..
---
Funnily enough most of the burrows has been in the game since patch 6
---
He certainly comes off as one.
---
Not entirely your fault, not our fault at all - Bethesda should have had better programming for the enemies , there were mods for F4 that were able to improve enemies - Bethesda should have took note and implemented some of that for 76 on release but instead we had T posers.
---
Well itv articles shouldn‚Äôt be about marketing anyway lol
---
So as long it is "marketing talk" It doesn't actually need to be the truth?
---
Just wish I was recording or in a none ‚Äúhigh as a kite‚Äù frame of mind so I was a more reliable narrator here...
---
Though the high as hell at this time is preferable to in ungodly agonizing pain.
---
I‚Äôm hunting Scuatch as well. I‚Äôve got my Imposter Outfit to blend in and a Six shooter so I can place a bullet in between its sunken eyes.
---
Wow! I didn't know they could spawn there. Yikes.
---
The eternal struggle.
---
The end of that quest genuinely fuckin‚Äô spooked me.
---
They are new but have no use yet
---
I don‚Äôt think you read that right... I said I don‚Äôt use those perks so I can‚Äôt disprove the claim op stated.
---
And speed demon prior to the recent update anyway had the negative effects negated entirely.
---
And exactly why should a weekly community address have anything to do with marketing stuff that will be forced on us for free anyway? These are supposed to be informative, not a sales pitch.
---
Solid response will get a solid response. Me being rude comes from some valid reasons. I hear bullshit all the time. My response was hence based not only on what you wrote but what every player that thinks sentinel is OP wrote.
---
The thing with sentinel is that you are forced to stand still hence your map control, besides camping across extreme distances or insides of station is useless. Yep its mathematically strong but what profit you have of strong math that disallows you to move? In real combat scenario, this armor is only usefull to tank fire from distances longer than few hundred meters. Otherwise their owners die the moment they show their head. 
---
TSE weapons aint perfectly balanced. They are underwhelming now. 4 or 5th tier tops. There is not a single weapon in game where TSE is its best variant. Explosive's fine, but TS shoul either loose accuracy penalty or get 100% damage back because right now its waste of prefix. 
---
A tool cant be meta if there is only one very specific situation where its actually great. This situation is being placed super high above the battleground, longer that vats range, and being protected by group of runners that deny enterance onto that spot. This is pretty much the only situation when assassin sentinel works well. 
---
I wrote all that already. I'm rephrasing same sentences until they hit, because its just the way it is.
---
Honestly, I'm just sad and dissapointed. When I hear dungeon, I imagine something that takes 30 minutes to an hour plus to complete either with 2-4 people. This wasnt that. There was hardly any story or lore. Just a couple of groups of ghouls and some angry robots.
---
Where is this dungeon or burrows people are talking about?
---
Yeah good try, we just set expectations by what Bethesda announced and set them at. lol. 2 - 4 level 50 characters. 6-7 mins on a level 151.
---
At this point 6 months in they should be putting raid level content in, all the below 50 players have a whole game to play still.
---
It was a joke. It should have at least been instanced. It really, really just felt like a quick BOS quest that didn't make it into the game. This is NOT how Bethesda hyped this. 
---
I have stood behind them every stupid step of the way, until today. They don't understand the game or their own players. 
---
This content was literally the equivalent of rounding up the ghouls at the gold club at white springs and killing them. 
---
The two side quests they added took more time. 
---
And we have been waiting for them to open the vaults up. The problem is they keep pushing content back.
---
Map design was great but next to the game play its just so much window dressing. Would have made a fantastic city in any other fallout game
---
Burrows has been in the game since patch 6 and it doesn't have anything to do with arktos at all.
---
Does this place just search for new ideas, and then once finding one proceed to copy it 6,436 times? Jesus H. Does anyone have anything original to say anymore? Every week you all post the exact same threads for days on end.
---
ü§£
---
Yep, i now im.not a casual gamer, i have some god tier weaponry now and i don't expect anything to really be difficult anymore so i dont complain about it, if i want it to be super difficukt ill start a new character and play through it again at a lower level
---
I was playing today with a friend and he gave me three legendary items and a serum to pass onto his lower level character, acquired through many hours of grinding, we both got disconnected and when we got back on they had all disappeared, even though they had shown up in my inventory, he‚Äôs now contemplating not playing for awhile because of the bugs and lagging at the minute
---
That looks better.
---
Walking through an abandoned town, skeletons here and there, all ruins. Then, I heard it.
---
"Happy Fasnacht!" *doot doot doo doo doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doo doo doo doo doo*
---
What is this comment even trying to say? That a game with nearly 100% casual friendly content is in greater need of high level challenging end game content or that this guy is apparently asking for it to be tailored solely to his interests? Are you drunk?
---
And let‚Äôs be honest, accurate or not, you painted a pretty terrifying picture. Let‚Äôs assume it was real üòâ
---
They had a perfect opportunity to launch a fully working model that fits on your arm, to access it whist gaming. Is that too hard in this day and age?
---
Not really. I have played this game very slowly, searching every spot I could. I have only been at about 3 or 4 nukes. about 2 of them were white springs. I never grinded xp. Just played. I am level 151 now. 50 IS Early 6 months into the game. Its high time they give us some stuff to do other than search the map for legendary spawns. That really is all there is left to do after 50 when you have completed all of the quests. 
---
The legendary player thing coming in the future. Whats the point. They would have to add 10 star legendary mobs to make a challenge for them at this point.
---
Actually nobody did get the skull or goblin masks.
---
This is one of a series of events that Bethesda has to unlock to make it so we can finally find and fight it. Eventually we are going to get an event called free range and when that's Enabled the real sheepsquatch is a boss and we will start seeing them in random encounters like this
---
Nice!
---
yeah, I have a lot of memory too :)  
---
It's nice to see some people remembering that game (it still exists tho, but I didnt played it since a long time)
---
/off topic off)
---
Im going to be honest I got an insane amount of legendaries out of the Burrows. At lest 10-12, I got more but one swarm had half the bodies despawn annoyingly. Saving them all for the Legendary Vendor.
---
Yep, both of em.
---
"Marketing talk" and "False Advertising" are a fine line indeed.
---
Yeh, deep pockets is armourer level 3 I guess previously that wasn't working right...
---
What they said was exaggerated and misleading. I‚Äôm not saying it was even intentional but the majority of the players feel betrayed by what was said and so it is a problem wether you believe it silly or not. Going forward they have GOT to be more clear and not simply hype every little thing up. Stick to facts and be honest.
---
Oh god! They're barely able to stick to the road map because they delayed the least impactful portion of their content!
---
For real. 
---
"Barely" implies they've had to delay multiple portions of content for a significant time.
---
The camera is the exception. Not the rule. Everything else has been pretty spot on.
---
Can we please stop defending crappy game design? It's the equivalent of a participation medal. This coming from someone who plays this game quite a bit.
---
Sick :D
---
This thing that bethesda has touted as the first dungeon in fallout 76 is nothing but a copy paste of other assets that are in the game already. They added a little bit of lore and thats it. If this is what they call a dungeon I'm really worried about the vaults coming and the new main story as well. Because if this is what we are working with god help us all.
---
I mean, people are just bringing in ther gear they have from playing the game, are you suggesting they should take off all of their gear and stow their weapons and do it naked? Just working with what RNGJesus gave us.
---
It isn‚Äôt a marketing platform you utter fool
---
I feel like fo76 is a lot of peoples first mmo.
---
....yes :(
---
I'm pretty sure the burrows was never really meant to be a challenge for high level players....
---
How do I find the eggs?
---
Consider we didn't actually get a patch this week to enable the dungeon and the amount of money it costs to push hotfixes to console I wouldn't expect any kind of fix on this until next week at least
---
My first scorchbeast kill was at pumkin house too, there was about 6 of us fighting it for ages, i ended up getting the final blow that killed it... With a plasma pistol... And it turned to goo in the sky so none of us could loot it, whoops
---
considering you most likely wont have your perfect build, weapons, armor, and all perk cards unlocked it isnt "fucking nuts"
---
theres way too much content and xp pontential in this game for 50 to be endgame.
---
You'll see this happen a lot on any server that's had encrypted done recently. The amount of enemy spawns causes a ton of issues with the game trying to load things in and that persists well after the event is over
---
The first one actually starts at the Ingram mansion, which directs you to Toxic Larry's, but you can skip that step and go directly to the holotape if you want to save time.
---
Why the hell are they making 'dungeons' for low levels?
---
Westek is harder and takes like tripple the time. 15 mins lol. (Not that westek is actually hard though).
---
That's why drop em off quickly, don't like to have too many rounds I don't use on me so I make noob spots a part of my daily looting route. 
---
Since I never have more than a few hindered I just drop the lot and point with my gun, pipboy light while tbagging. Even the newest players know what that means and I find level 5's are less likely to run than level 10-15's
---
Yeah, I think this creature will be the end "boss" at Arkos Pharma dungeon, and the real sheepsquash is added as a world boss at the end of wild appalachia.
---
Because stealth needs a major rebalancing.  Don't blame the build for poor game design.
---
They are different, but they all share same core- Group content, some sort of mechanics in different phases or bosses, and in the end the hardest/most valuable boss (mostly, but sometimes middle boss is hardest). 
---
Well WoW dungeon would be purest/simplest example of what dungeon is, but even if you take something like Division or Destiny 2, the dungeon build up is same to WoW- you got group content, then are some mechanics that you have to do in each phase to progress and in the end is the Boss. Same with GW2, it does something different. It doesn't have taunt for tanks, but dungeon build up is same- You got group content, phases with bosses and in the end is the big boss. ESO does something different do, they don't have AoE taunt, but dungeon build up is same- group content, phases with different bosses and in the end big boss. And with each game, last boss has some unique mechanics you have to do, to beat boss. Either it be to avoid some shots from boss (like in WoW and mostly in MMORPG) or shoot/do something before you can shoot boss (The Division, Destiny 2 and probably all shooters that have dungeons). Burrows in F76 have none of that- it doesn't have group content, it doesn't have phases and it definitely doesn't have "punch line" (Boss) in the end with unique mechanics.
---
The thing is, in it's actual states, after you reach lvl 50 and after you've done all quests, the only real end-game goal is to get good gear and being optimized. (ie: good damage good resistance).
---
So it's a real issue, because if the end content doesnt answer to the need of challenge in that circonstance, the end game has no point at all.
---
Now people are blaming their crappy internet speeds on Bethesda?  LOL
---
whats next?
---
This. It was pitched as a 2+ level 50+ dungeon. 
---
That's also going to be geared towards the every day player. 
---
Not the min maxing people of this sub. They think every player has even a slightly optimal build.
---
that's what she said.
---
A small group were moronic enough to assume some mechanic heavy long raid. Most people just assumed it would be a repeatable challenging dungeon like a strike from destiny or something.
---
It's good to see someone else is getting this too, I think it's a bug and your location isn't actually displayed on the map.
---
A level 50 pipe pistol would still one shot every ghoul, long as you don't mean the full auto one
---
Aw but I really do enjoy playing the Fallout gear slot machine /s . Somewhere out there is a dev who put syringers and drills in the loot table for legendaries. I'd like to ask that dev some questions, like...why do you hate us?
---
... have you ever played a fallout game other than 76? Overpowered stealth builds are the norm not the exception.
---
There wasn‚Äôt even a patch or even server downtime. It was time gated for literally no reason but to extend an awful drip feed lmao
---
&gt;So basically what you're saying is "I don't want to look at the evidence
---
Yes that's exactly what he's doing lol.  But even more than that, I am taking the time to listen to and read what the developers are saying. He's admitted that he has done no such thing and has no intention of doing so.  He's saying that Bethesda never over- hyped anything and yet, by his own admission, he has no idea what they have said.
---
They are free in the atom shop.
---
I agree with what you‚Äôre saying. They chose loose terms and overhyped the hell out of this very small thing.
---
I got the same thing until I closed the actual FO76 application. If you‚Äôre on PS4, highlight the game and then click the options button. That‚Äôll bring up a list of shit you can do.
---
So you're saing they put a singleplayer-like dungeon to game they call MMO, multiplayer, play it with friends etc... And this seems OK or even logical to you?
---
And yet there are people who have them. They must all be dirty hackers. All of them. 
---
Isn't it funny that the poll people keep referring to didn't actually show that there was zero drops, it showed that the drop rate was 0.03 percent, which is EXACTLY the same as for other rare outfits in the game. And yet, since we didn't get them ourselves, it must be zero anyway. 
---
Worked as intended. Sure, it sucks they had that drop rate when the event was time limited. But people got them, and people have them.
---
If you‚Äôre a god build, WHY ARENT YOU in survival mode with other gods or OP?
---
I absolutely do not have an OP build, instead I am a lazy hoarder so I wear Excavator PA with every weight-reducing perk available, and only fill in the gaps with suitable combat perks.
---
I don't have a great weapon either - I'm still rocking All Rise, the melee legendary that everyone can easily get.
---
I went in solo.  It was not the least bit challenging.
---
So I mean, you're not wrong, there isnt going to be many things the  OP one-hit bloodied builds will find challenging.  But there certainly could have been something built that was challenging for someone like me.  The Burrows was not it.  At all.
---
Uh oh, you forgot to list what console your on, I‚Äôm Xbox sorry man
---
You‚Äôre not wrong but nobody told whomever wrote the inside the vault articles lmao
---
Welp, better go post on Reddit
---
i spent about 30 min inside and got a a couple really good legionaries
---
Wood armour was useful back when I was level 7 or so. Been completely useless since I got metal armour at level 10 ish. Did they really expect us level up slowly enough that we'd equip full sets of wood armour?
---
Careful, you're giving Bethesda ideas for really specific and annoying challenges.
---
Yep. Figured I'd mix up the burrows rage.
---
No screenshots of the skull or goblin masks apart from ones taken from the dev room. I'm not saying the drop rate was 0%. I'm just saying that it should've been a bit higher for a limited time event.
---
Did people actually think there would like real dungeons and shit? LOL the so called dlc everybody is hyping about is FREE ! Pretty sure Bugtesda is no different from other companies
---
They‚Äôve delayed half of their patches going back to [December. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/comicbook.com/gaming/amp/2018/12/08/fallout-76-update-schedule-console-patch-delayed/) they delayed [Wild Appalachia ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/1098554/Fallout-76-update-7-patch-notes-Wild-Appalachia-DLC-release-date-quests-crafting-roadmap/amp). 
---
They delayed the camera, backpacks, player vending, and legendary vending. Some things have been delayed by months and others just a day or two, or a week. 
---
I would say it‚Äôs not really a big deal because maybe they want to perfect it but this is pretty poor project management and the end result is often far from polished.
---
I have gotten the alert when it was a player (inadvertently) attacking my camp.
---
In my personal datasheet I've found that I get a useful drop around 5% of the time from 3 starred legendaries. 
---
What do you define as good items?
---
New ones would be great, but I just wish I had encountered more than 2 enemies total.  :|
---
Oh.. I've just been using it at default zoom.. üòÖ
---
(Thank you OP!)
---
 Of course,  I'm also an expert at game balance. Features like that can't be balanced in a multiplayer setting without some sort of negatives. The more build possibilities you add the more impossible it becomes to balance.
---
Or a combat knife? lol or a whack a mole thing from the fun fairs
---
For real? 
---
Your taking marketing buzz words and flavour phrases and trying to interpret them in a way that relates to your play experience as a high level player? Hahahahahahaha. 
---
This sub is so obnoxiously full of itself. 
---
"They need to make more content for high level players the low levels have the rest of the game"
---
I can assure you that level 200+ players are not the majority of their player base. They are going to cater new content to the majority of their player base, not some small sliver. I don't know how that needs explaining.
---
Nah its good as it is because with stars you don't have to call out every legendary you see for teammates.
---
My team only calls for level 40+ 3 stars and level 50+ 2 stars. Anything else we just kill. It saves a lot of time farming in groups, because at least you know hey this one has a chance of something good make sure everyone pegs it.
---
why did people nuke whitesprings anyways
---
Or players above level 10 apparently. I'd be happy if there was just more variety in enemies and loot and stuff even if it wasn't hard, but it's that combination of easy AND boring that really bothers me.
---
My rate of useful legendaries from 3 star enemies is about 5%. I've kept pretty extensive data about it. 
---
But then again I might define useful as different than you.
---
Exactly, I expected me and my friend having to struggle through it for maybe 20 or 30 mins. Instead, I solo walked through it in about 6-7 mins. I mean people are saying I walked through someone's leftovers, but how is that my fault? That was my experience. I walked in, got the quest, killed about 15 or 20 ghouls and 4 or 5 robots and it was over, I was scratching my head trying to figure out what happened lol. 
---
I mean its a nice looking dungeon, the layout is well designed. There was just about as much content for me as if I went to the gold club rounded up the ghouls and killed them. It was around and equal experience for me. So if there is supposed to be like 50 ghouls in there, unless they all came at the exact same time, it would not have been much of a challenge. This is what people over level 50 do in this game at white springs on a regular basis. 
---
6-7 mins was just a disappointment.
---
Counter example, I found 2 enemies total, none of them legendary, one being the "boss" and another being a robot that spawned before the "boss" died.  Got a quest reward sword and nothing else.  There were 2 players stealthed in the boss room, so I guess they must have killed everything?
---
Yeah I went in this morning with hardly any ammo on me, just to see what it was about. Ended up soloing it with ease on a level 98
---
Are you seriously asking that question. 
---
BGS is going to put out more content that the majority of their player base can enjoy. What level range do you think most people are. 
---
If you say 150+ you need to give your head a shake. 
---
This sub can't seem to realize that it doesn't accurately reflect the whole of the player base. Not even close. Not every one who plays 76 is a min maxing meta exploiting hundreds of hours farmed try hard.
---
Just a meme üòé
---
Cleared it using the fixer
---
Do they know how misrepresenting their product can backfire? Lol
---
OldPeopleAmazon
---
I believe on the panel they were talking about a dungeon under arktos pharma
---
If you have access to that information, then why does it no longer matter once it becomes time for you to cast judgement on the situation?
---
Calling out that you have specifically ignored pieces of information that didn‚Äôt align with your narrative isn‚Äôt creating a ‚Äústraw-man‚Äù.  It‚Äôs ensuring a level playing field.
---
I have addressed your points a couple of times, but each time you responded you rejected any points i made by assigning intent to a person you do not know, and by creating a narrative where only your evidence matters, just with twice as many words each time.
---
I don‚Äôt need to win anything.  I‚Äôm not emotionally invested in this discussion.  I‚Äôm not going to change anyone‚Äôs opinion.  I don‚Äôt care to.  I already said i could have handled things differently and so could OP.  I chose not to because I felt she was being off putting and difficult.  I will maintain that.
---
She‚Äôs 43.  She‚Äôs more than capable of expressing herself and identifying calls for inquiry and questions of authority, and responding in a way that is constructive to establishing her point.  And if she is not, then i hope she gets there because life certainly isn‚Äôt easy when you always feel targeted.
---
Just like I responded reasonably to your criticism until it was clear that you understood what i was saying, but didn‚Äôt care.  And that‚Äôs a far cry from being told that ‚Äúthe colors are the same‚Äù.
---
Lol, repeatable dungeon means so much more than another loot location and Bethesda know it. This is just another case of false advertising and I for one am getting pretty tired of this shit. I am going to continue playing the game from time to time but I am not trying to convince myself it isn‚Äôt crap.
---
Make sure you're sitting down, this may come as a shock.  You may be surprised to learn that, if you go to a forum about a video game, people there tend to play that video game.
---
I found quite a few legendaries as well as two three star drops today from the burrows. But if you say that you've had good luck people downvote you. 
---
It seems like its a solid farming location, about equal to west tek, and whitesprings.
---
It is worse is survival
---
Most people complaining did NOT expect a ‚Äúraid‚Äù like destiny or wow etc. they expected some more akin to a strike in destiny or a dungeon in eso.
---
I don't know if my build is considered OP or not, but there are existing place on the map that I find way more challenging than this dungeon.   West Tek  and Robco are more challenging than this.  Glass Caverns is more challenging.
---
Can I also get downvotes for saying it wasn't bad?
---
"Gather your squad" in no way implies it was going to be extremely difficult. 
---
That's simply marketing flavour. 
---
The article was pretty clear. Recommended 2+ players at level 50+
---
That's 2+ players at level 50 plus of the whole player base. Who aren't all min maxed , build focused players like the people here. 
---
This subs level 70 and some randos level 70? Are likely going to be significantly different as far as optimization level goes.
---
You joke but I am TOTALLY in favour of something being added which is challenging other than combat.  That's even less likely to happen though.
---
Same here. People keep trying to diminish and control the actual experience that we had. It cant be changed. The experience we had was the experience we had. It made us feel how we felt. There is no counterpoint or opinion that can change that. 
---
It was a letdown. 6-7 mins was disappointing.
---
I agree with everything you just said. The panel is definitely not talking about this dungeon. That said though the itv articles way overhyped this content and it‚Äôs wholly on them especially seeing as there are community managers combing the reddit all the time. They should‚Äôve clarified.
---
did i just r/woooosh myself?
---
Missed the opportunity to use the black and white filter to turn this into some noir crime drama.
---
Great snap though!
---
There IS a stealth rifle though.  It's part of the Lying Lowe questline.  It's... not great, however.
---
Exactly it was the inside the vault articles
---
So it's our fault that screenshots published by the devs (along with their description of this "dungeon") mislead us of this being actually challenging and rewarding?
---
Pick up any fucking video game. Read the back of the box. 
---
See all those "deadly enemies" and "challenging puzzles" and such? 
---
None of that is true. It's marketing. Unless your playing dark souls. 
---
This sub's critical thinking skills are fucking trash.
---
You are definitely not alone!
---
I tired to make a junkie build at some point, was hard to get addicted to anything and then was pissed my addictions just faded away after a while. The cost of just keeping the chems on you to feed the addiction sucks, from my experience the best only worked once the withdrawal effects started.
---
Legit.  It comes on every time I‚Äôm going back to my camp.
---
What a joke. You can't be serious
---
I agree they overhyped this but that was definitely not what they were talking about on the panel
---
Sheepsquatch is a decent event, and a good way to clear out my junk when some knobgoblin steals my brown paper bag after an eyebot explodes.
---
Show me one person that spent money to gain access to the burrows.
---
That didn‚Äôt work
---
It‚Äôs a great idea, into the trash can it goes T_T.
---
Just a suggestion but I had this problem but then farmed legendaries in the mire and the bog and u can honestly say I get better drops. Sentinel pieces, bloodied weapons and so on... It can't just be luck.
---
Definitely felt like it belonged in Fallout. Not so much the dungeon itself. Kinda sad that the best thing about it was the soundtrack that Bethesda kind of has nothing to do with.
---
Yeh üòã allgood friend.
---
I didn't mind the content just thought of as people were saying we didn't get a dungeon and everyone was saying disappointed I thought of that song üòé
---
Best song for just chilling out and hiking.
---
I hit each of the main farms. West tec, Tanagra, harpers, fort defiance, the burrows, golf club. But wagtoa in its self has not had a legendary bot. WES had scorched legendary in the normal location and a second one by the roof door.
---
Whoosh
---
Because, it's a community address not patch notes?
---
Because it's called inside the vault? They are clearly trying to carry a tone and feel of being informative with flavour? 
---
"Why the fuck do they need to call me vault dweller! My name is Steve! I don't need this marketing BS. Just give me press releases "
---
I enjoyed the cryptid event but burrows was so lackluster. I am worried for the vaults now, they need to step away from simple combat driving thier gameplay loop so heavily. It's to simplistic and player power can get high enough to make encounters trivial. I don't want to see players nerfed, I'd like to see more interesting mechanics like puzzles and things the sheepsquatch introduced like the pylons.
---
Maybe mobs that can only be hurt by certain damage types or security systems other than turrets (maybe radiation or gas based).
---
Basically they need to be more creative.
---
It‚Äôs nothing to do with press releases or selling anyone free things... they should be informative. If they aren‚Äôt (in this case they weren‚Äôt realistic/factual) then it‚Äôs just going to piss everyone off as seen here on the Reddit
---
I‚Äôve had it come up twice since beta. Once when a construction crew came in sledgehammers and whatnot. And the other a thing of molerats. The molerats one the notice came up 2 minutes after they had died. And the first was the second I heard the rockets of the sledge go off.
---
Just go to the fabricator on the Mansion, you can craft one there i guess
---
There have been a lot of companies in a lot of trouble for "Marketing Talk" is all I am saying to the point of "Marketing Talk". There is a fine line between the two. That phrase was just thrown around freely as is, oh it's ok that it wasn't what they said because it was just all "Marketing Talk" In the real world, when "Marketing talk" becomes misleading, its called false advertising. 
---
In other words, use the defense of "Marketing talk" is not helping the case in any way whatsoever.
---
You have to do that each patch if you mod it. Mods are not officially supported and the way they were implemented initially is now a trouble. The mod devs took an empty archieve and snuck their stuff in. This archieve is the one thats now most commonly modified.
---
308/50....139/138 damage with all 9 rifle perks, mine are both armour peircing.on paper,
---
1 point diff, but the 50 just does more damage. My 308 is in my stash now (weight issue)
---
in favour of the 50 but used to carry both,the 308 with long scope is superb,the 50 is silenced with recon scope.both however,will take out a scorchbeast from long ways out.
---
now try FINDING a 50 cal sniper. picked up a l25 early on,but had to buy a l50 from a whitespring vendor,and its rare.the 50 reciever doesn't seem to scrap as a mod.
---
My lucks been pretty poor since the patch but today was a pretty big increase. How have your drops been compared to normal since the patch? 
---
I've had many days of straight bad luck before where I don't find any 3 stars but today showed me the soawn rate is definitely still there and we might be jumping the gun on calling stealth nerfs.
---
the small minority who is satisfied by the new content
---
Maybe someone's camp couldn't load cause you were in their spot, it made them mad, they did some damage, then server hopped...
---
Love the song
---
This post should be marked as a spoiler...
---
We are not the reason we are getting overhyped
---
Because pipe guns weren't crappy enough.
---
(The King of Rats)[ https://youtu.be/kIWss-_5HGM]
---
So, see, here is the problem here. If 3 stars guaranteed a 3 star drop every time, Players would zerg around the map hunting and killing all of the 3 stars only, doing mostly nothing else. Yeah, people suck.
---
The rest of the bos are the ghouls down there.
---
Do not underestimate the power of Bethesda to screw up things....
---
No. This wasn't to lure old players back.
---
That's stupidity. BGS is going to make content that impacts the majority of their player base.
---
This sub is not the majority of their player base. This sub's idea of difficult is not representative of that of the player base. Because most of the player base is not going to be level 200 min maxed optimized builds with hundreds of hours of farmed equipment.
---
I noticed that. I was just curious of the .50 just had more to it on paper. Like stagger or cripple something to make it feel better other than it being the bigger round.
---
This basically sums it all up.
---
You're just bad, friend and I cleaned this up with our level 30s with no problem. This is ranked for 2  or more level 50+ vault dwellers.
---
Reminder to everyone they have restuarants you sit down to order at in Whitesprings, but you have to stand up to eat your food.
---
That worked. Thanks!!!
---
Probably just a script error as the sheepsquatch wont be a common enemy. He will be like a flatwoods monster, a mothman or even a grafton monster.
---
There's some unreleased content related to mannequins that has been datamined. The toast notifications (i.e. "player X killed Y" on survival, or "you are suffering from starvation". There's an AI in valeria gallery that wanted to recreate their human team using mannequins - because it felt lonely. There's also a pending order to remove the mannequins sent by last remaining member of the crew. The toast notifications imply PvP event based around destroying and rebuilding the mannequins. This might be related a lil bit.
---
Psst. Little secret. They could give 2 fucks about the high level players who've spent boat loads of hours playing. 
---
Why? Because you represent an insignificant portion of the player base.
---
THANK YOU! Well said! Walked in spent 6-7 mins and was confused when the end popped up.
---
This isnt an MMO tho
---
So. You're wrong. They were crystal clear. 2+ level 50+ players. 
---
For most of the player base it will be challenging, but not overly so. 
---
It doesn't read 2+ level 50 /r/fo76 users. Which I guarantee you have significantly more optimized builds and gear than most randoms.
---
&gt;  am pretty sure this was content that was cut from initial release due to it not being fully developed.
---
So why did they release it now, still not fully developed?  :D
---
Its easy to deal lots of melee damage against stupid enemies. Its very hard to deal any against smart ones. Melee is not overpowered IMO. Its just relevant, making it weaker would make it irrelevant.
---
Well, somehow, lets be honest.
---
They (bethesda) have a real issue when it comes to tune thing.
---
They don't know how to do it.
---
At all.
---
I have still high hopes for the game, but this is starting to be a bit concerning...
---
Watonga TS and Grafton TS and townvendor. And different mods have different rarity. And for plans, some can be baught/found, and some trough scrapping
---
Treasure maps and events.
---
Step 1 - enter trade 
---
Step 2 - discuss items
---
Step 3 - ask what the 3rd prefix is
---
Step 4 - they can't remember, so exit trade menu
---
Step 5 - "it just works"
---
Hey, atleast they let us view items sold by vendors now though? That was really frustrating.
---
Seriously. All these "This isn't a dungeon, look at WoW, they have dungeons" type people ?
---
They need to load up Skyrim, walk into almost any cave, then give their empty heads a shake.
---
My first reaction as well!
---
It‚Äôs been varied. My two highlights are 3‚≠êÔ∏è furious laser rifle and today with a 3‚≠êÔ∏è nocturnal chameleon rad resistance leather arm. Everything else is all over the place but nothing that screams good. Just cannon fodder for the people that have nothing and the coming of the purveyor. 
---
But yeah Watoga wise the streets are dry. The builds are ok. AMS graces me with 3 boss bots. The civic center is usually a boss but no more than a 2‚≠êÔ∏è legendary and the high school seems to have its one of.   
---
Anytime I go there albeit for Queenie or dailies. I just skip the city and just hit AMS WES and the deathclaw and the Mirelurks to the south.
---
Yeah, I just wish it was the John Denver version, but I guess ya can't have everything.
---
So what? Fact that everyone does it makes it OK?
---
Do the trainstationvendors inventory still shuffle around? I thought they were static? Thanks for the tips!
---
I bombed HF about 2 months ago and was very lackluster in the legendary mutants area.
---
I'd say majority of players are 50+. What is the difference between 50+ and 150+ when all they're throwing at us is a couple of ghouls and robots in a sewer. God i'm not asking for some complicated Destiny type raid boss. Just come up with something more interesting than some fucking zombies.
---
Not only was it too easy, it was boring for reasons other than difficulty. Lack of enemy variety and just not much else going on.This feels like just another standard location that was probably supposed to be in the game at launch. I'm convinced that the game just can't handle a ton of enemies and we're doomed to kill ghouls for eternity.
---
Yup!
---
Check out his channel today. He's responded.
---
Legit didnt know rabbits were in this game and im like, level 75
---
They just need to balance the whole game, it feels like they ported the game and then just left it to one dev who‚Äôs probably developed single player games his whole life and was given two weeks to balance the lot
---
Easy
---
What obnoxious bullshit. 
---
ITV is clearly being done with tone and flavour. It always has. Its meant to be informative sure, but it also has always used flavour text and language.
---
grafton steel yard buddy it's in a locker at a building at the far end with the wall broken üëç
---
That is bad game design, also not a fault of the consumer.
---
I can confirm that interior locations are affected.  I always hit the legendary in the medical building in Watoga and went there once when it got nuked.  Everything inside was glowing ghouls.
---

---
All the valves open something which has "loot" aside from the final one. Ended up finding a caps stash behind one that gave over 300 caps. But otherwise wasn't much else.
---
I managed to get a 3 star cloaking Cavlier leg today. I gave it to my friend who runs a melee build.
---
I usually have about a 5% rate of 3 stars dropping something I consider useful. Not godtier but actually useful. I've gotten one what i would consider god tier drop.
---
Deffo good idea to have them in... you‚Äôre right about the concern of breaking the lore though.  Mind you, some people have said that Bethesda have broke the lore themselves when they want to.  I remember something being mentioned about x01 power armour behind a glass door at Nuka world?
---
Later this year is all they've said.
---
LUL
---
You have to update your ini file in every update cause they add new stuff.  
---
You can always check the fallout76.ini for changes and update your custom.ini.
---
 https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1110225138979651584
---
I used All Rise, and a garbage junk-hoarding perk build, and it was a fucking cakewalk.  I really question what people do in this game if this dungeon is the least bit challenging for them.
---
I think it‚Äôs kinda cool that we have all these teases but no actual confirmation of it yet. It‚Äôs just like a real conspiracy, we have to search far and wide to find the clues
---
I stand corrected!
---
Try now with the inclusion of the Burrows. The Burrows alone are swarming with glowing ones.
---
I'm at 300hr gameplay time and I haven't seen too much special myself and if there was no duping I assume it would be the same for many other people. There are a lot of RNG rolls, that's just the way it is and it creates a great rarity system. You really should pick up legendary items and inspect them and if they are junk either vendor them, sell them or give them away. There's always someone happy to have it if you;re not satisfied. They are also bringing the legendary vendor soon too so keep that in mind, let's just hope it's not utter BS.
---
I'll keep checking it out! I've been hopping between the penitentery and steelyard!
---
Nice. I‚Äôve just accepted that my irl luck is just permanently stuck at 1. I rarely get 3star stuff and when I do it‚Äôs still bad enough that I can‚Äôt even give it to someone as a gift. 
---
Since the last update I‚Äôve gotten at the least 30 or so wood pieces. Granted wood armour is really good for being a sneaky. As the armour makes next to no noise. But still.
---
I switch to Classical everytime Beachboys and this song start playing
---
Oh. My. God. 
---
It's marketing and flavour text. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
It's not false advertising.
---
This kind of stuff is what this game desperately needs. I love seeing when the players go off on these trails. Was bummed that Operation Tourniquet ended up being a miss.
---
Or don't cheese the queen.   Just fight her in the nuke zone like intended and this won't happen.
---
Yes. Actually yes. Not my favourite game by far. But I get to play fallout with my lady and a few cool people that I've met in game. I never wanted or expected anything else
---
What's the difference between a level 50 and 150?
---
Significantly more dialed in build and gear? My level 55 character then and my level 78 character now are dramatically different in terms of efficiency and damage output. Significantly.
---
There's a major difference between "being able to use" and "owning" all items in the game.
---
The "END" game is when you've done everything else. If you have passable stuff, either you're a casu, glad with it and you will not need TRUE endgame, in which case the burrows is perfectly good.
---
Either you are a hardcore gamer, and you haven't finished optimizing your build, in which case you are NOT in the endgame.
---
But in both cases, the dungeon seems perfectly suited for level 50 characters , since we've proven those are certainly NOT endgame ready.
---
TBH I've stated multiple times that from scratch, people ran through this game way too fast and then complained. Beta ended (if we admit we're no longer in beta) with people being in the 100+ levels, having already thrown nukes, but who still didn't know you can see things on the maps of the stations, you can fast travel from inside the buildings, that there's Cthulhu in a cave, or who didn't understand why we were throwing nukes instead of rebuilding, while it's clearly stated in the MAIN QUEST.
---
People play this game as a hack n slash gameplay wise : run to the highest-legendaries location, kill everything, read nothing, then they complain the game lacks deepness or interest. Yeah sure.
---
I've two characters level 80+, I consider myself a more than casual gamer, but I've taken time to read the notes, listen to holotapes, look at the environment, and I haven't seen EVERYTHING in the game yet. 
---
PSA : If you spend 12hours a day on this game since release, nothing will be "endgame" for you. There won't be a quest that requires 8 characters in fully modded X-01 with 9 specific mutations shooting a TSE all together, because that's just impossible for 99% of the playerbase. (However, it might be a daily quest for atoms soon /s)
---
Haha optimal. I don‚Äôt even know how to optimise. I‚Äôm L53, I have good shotgun perks but that‚Äôs it, I made whatever choices for everything else. All this min max is gibberish to me.
---
Well that's kinda just life, isn't it? I don't mean like ultra rare unique loot. Just like a care package. You know some candy/med/chems or whatever. Easter egg hunts are great fun and I think they have missed a great community event/ random encounter opportunity here. unless they have a surprise lined up.
---
I don't think you can just "give it to modders to fix". I mean its a online game, where 1 mod is affecting everything. Means one modder puts something "bad" into game, everyone is f#cked. And even if you go over each line of the code to sanitize modder work, it still could break the game atmosphere. Take 10 guns from different modders and put them into F4, your game looks out of touch- one gun is modern, one is steampunk, one is pink flamingo.
---
I may log back into the game eventually.  Been playing the mobile game Langrisser instead of Fallout 76.   A few months back, got bored of just farming legendary.  Had explored everything and did all quests/events except the Order of Mysteries: Novice which is broken for me.
---
The one good thing about wood pieces is their weight so you can store a ton of them for when the legendary vendor comes out. 
---
I've also been saving three stars that have bad rolls but good weapon/armor types. Never know of they will be able to be rerolled or not. Worst case more fuel for the scrapping fire.
---
You can't have positive opinions on this sub
---
you can find parties online. queues ruined wow more than anything, even sharding. No one explores anymore.
---
Yup.
---
Point me to one thing stated in the inside the vault that you can quantify as false based on something concrete. 
---
Not something based off personal opinion, or perception. Not off feeling. Or expectation. 
---
Something that they said about this dungeon that was 100% quantifiable as not true.
---
Remember to let the health of the creature regenerate to have better loot
---
And none of that matters because we're just mowing down easy as fuck enemies.
---
How were they not factual?
---
My biggest ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moments in the Burrows where other players causing the mobs to respawn. Trying to loot that Legendary Charred Ghoul you just killed? Well congrats, here‚Äôs another 3 feet from you! Not that I‚Äôm complaining, I walked out of there with more legendaries than I could carry. Had to boost my strength just to get to the WS to trade them all for sweet sweet Nuka Cola. Found a couple keepers though. Nothing I‚Äôd get anything for on the market. 
---
Also be wary in the ‚Äúboss‚Äù room... beating all those gutsies once was a pain, beating them a second time while a player who was woefully unequipped for the fight rushed in and died, blowing your cover while you tried to revive him.... well it‚Äôs not the best.
---
I find the lack of an artillery piece personally upsetting. üòÇ
---
Otherwise, excellent looking camp. Very snug and homely. Definitely given me a couple of ideas. Cheers OP!
---
Couldn't agree more. Not to mention that arrogant(imo) title.
---
Ugh. Read the road map. 
---
The stuff you wanted from this dungeon, was never promoted as being in this content. 
---
The stuff you want is in Wastelanders. Coming later on.
---
Yeah idk if it was the same guys but I think I saw someone discussing about that and that it could just be content not yet implemented and they are just ahead of the curve.
---
I think I also saw them talking in the comments about other things to try such as marked an unmarked fissures, taking into account the left over cargobots near point pleasant and using nuclear keys from only in session. Here's to hoping more comes about it!
---
Regardless atm with all this sheepsquatch stuff and my own IRL love of mothman stuff its got me itching to roleplay, 
---
 &gt;my guy is a tinfoil hat wearing letterman jacket and jeans crazy but who is scouring the land in search....for....
---
Something
---
One of these other markers is suspiciously close to Arktos Pharma üòè
---
It just works.
---
I think they're realizing they need the Steam consumer base. With the fixes and extra content I think they're less worried about Steam's return policy now too.
---
You monster.
---
Theory: Lower the expectations even more, so that they can bring even more "easy to build" content.
---
Thank you. I've been trying to explain this to people. 
---
Find me a level 77 random and a level 77 person from this sub. 
---
There's a good chance that random isn't going to be a min maxed, optimized build having, hours worth of farmed gear equipped try hard. 
---
They are likely very different in efficiency and damage output.
---
That is the expectation from how it was going to be in your head showing off.
---
In theory it is supposed to be good in stealth builds since you sneak faster and such, something like ghillie suit. I could see it work if it also maybe gave buff to non automatic rifles and didn't count as armour for Chameleon mutation by default. Idea would be that you kill everything at range, before it can damage you, so you don't need resistances. Maybe Berserk legendary would be useful too.
---
at least bloodied weapon can offer some king of challenge... sort of... because you basically run with 20% HP all the time (ie with \~50hp max).
---
This can be scary sometimes, but fun ;)
---
AGREE.
---
I wouldn't complain about that idea, just seeing people in the comments already complaining about not being able to log on for the free eggs got me lol
---
You are top 3 with 0 kills, because no one else has kills either.
---
Jet implemention somehow?
---
I whoosh my way through life
---
Don't overhype.
---
Isnt it literally an option in the setting to not have it?
---
If they're sticking with the holiday themes, maybe we'll get them for Christmas.
---
It would also be good if when we close the pip-boy after dropping loot, there's an option to place it in a big gift box to make it more visible (should be toggled on in settings to not annoy people who aren't interested in gifting).
---
Legendaries should have been bind on pickup. this would have solve a lot of issue in the earlier days...
---
buying a TSE shotgun  totally defeat the progression purpose: you basically have the top directly.
---
It's not on you at all: you can do it, you do it.
---
it's all on bethesda design.
---
Well to be honest, I think Steam's return policy would have helped them a bit from bad reputation when people tried to return/quit the game when it was released.
---
I thought my 250+ hours was well worth the 60 bucks I spent.   But yes, Steam has probably the biggest audience for game sales.   There are numerous other companies with their own launchers though that force you to buy from those.  (Origin from EA, Fortnite from EPIC, was a few others but forgot those)
---
Oooh so that‚Äôs what those needles were, I was so confused  I thought they added a new weapon or something
---
Poor Vendor Bot Wallace  :(
---
I will be making the requested updates to the Protectrons. The robots will decide ON THEIR OWN how often we celebrate Fasnacht.
---
Jensen is aware of my concerns about frequency and the unpredictable factors... Jensen says it will better for tourists. *sigh*
---
Just don't come to me if the robots chose to have a party every single day until the end of the world...
---
Casual players are likely the majority of their player base. Not level 289 try hards. 
---
Why the fuck would BGS cater to a sliver of their player base before the majority of it? 
---
They get more payoff by giving casual players more content.
---
&gt;3 is the answer we really need
---
Shut up Bethesda.
---
Point to where in this post I'm hyping anything? I'm just trying to keep things in perspective for people.
---
No thank you. I just needed it for collection and a good melee Not being able to finish the quest sucked.  
---
And I can craft the Fixer.
---
I don't disagree, actually.
---
They call me Mars, bringer or war üòà
---
They shouldn't have advertised it as a 'challenging dungeon' then I'll just say that. They should've said 'another location thats kind of big'.
---
Assassins, God i would have praised Todd if it was Anti-Armour XD
---
So much for the Free States
---
You can wait it out but cannot go to "safe" areas.  Anywhere like camps or vendors or stashes.  It resets the timer.
---
Cool.
---
Sorry meant Stealth, rifle, vats build which means perception, agility and luck as 3 mains Special.
---
Guys, how do I start the quest? I entered a manhole and just walked through the sewers, but no quest started?
---
I played since fallout 1 üòâ
---
It's pretty kick ass if you get the plan and craft a level 50 though
---
It is though, you just gotta nuke it.
---
See I always stared at the birthday list, but never put one and one together, cause I got the Mari bit but never the number! Glad to see that others can tho XD Might need to dust my brain a bit
---
I love the overall shape of the building. It's a nice variation on the 'big box' houses you see quite often. You've filled the internal space really well too! Nice build!
---
Likewise, which is why I'm confused by the stealth build hate. Rifle specced sniper dude was viable from the start and just plain smart.
---
The games most loyal players mean absolutely fuck all. 
---
You represent the smallest portion of the player base. Catering to you would be a waste of time. For every one of you, there's dozens of casuals running around. 
---
This idea that BGS should cater content based on how many hours you've played not to the biggest portion of their player base is absolutely obnoxious and absurd.
---
That the the drop rate should have been higher we are 100% in agreement on. Ridiculous to have it that low when it is a time limited event. I am ok with super rare drops when we can spend months looking for it, but this... yeah.
---
i do agree, however if there was something wort-- well there always something.  i guess im a camp budget whore.
---
Very nice
---
Well I know what I'm doing in today's session. Cheers OP!
---
How is having awesome gear that you want to get in a loot shooter bad game design? That's the whole point. You earn gear and build your character around maximizing it's potential, or you start with the build in mind and find the gear to fit it. Somethings are always going to be better than others, and if you are on the high end of the loot table you are going to have a pretty easy time with whatever you are doing. The only problem we have for now is a lack of super difficult content, which is subjective since a lot of people were whining about Encryptid being too difficult
---
Ooh, I didn't know that was an option.  How do you do that?
---
thanks.  been working little by little.  the delay in vendors has me picking a suitable shop front
---
So I wasn't the only one that noticed it!
---
It really isn't. I have a tse handmade that does 186 damage with all rifle perks maxed out whilst a bloodied explosive handmade does around 1500 damage lol
---
Waste of my time.
---
Indeed it is, I barely find anything its hard to kill. Scorbeasts take few more shots but as they cant see me I get barely any damage. Got two sniper rifles with silencer (a must if you dont want to be discovered), action lever for quick short distance clean up, and hunters rifle for longer dostance. Perfect setting.
---
the downvotes are either a downbote bot someone has going or  pissed console users
---
Go load up Skyrim. 
---
Walk into a cave. 
---
Give your head a shake.
---
Ask yourself why you expected a BGS dungeon to not be similar to a text book BGS dungeon.
---
God bless 'em, they found their happy places.
---
Yeah. Form vs function. I have an artillery piece and 8 turrets - Rockets, heavy laser etc. Though my camps are usually little more than fancy barns with basic functionality.
---
My camps are refueling stations. Your camp looks like somewhere you could actually live and rebuild society. XD
---
Damn that would've been fun. Then we could've had some experiment gone wrong story about the gatorclaws instead of....whatever we got. I'm fine if they add in enemies like that I mean they mutated from something, that something could easily be in West Virginia. Besides we've already got Fog Crawlers and Giant Hermit Crabs
---
I've been agonizing over making a nice shop area too, but 1. I keep moving camp and 2. I don't really have anything good to sell, so I should probably just gather up some nice stuff xD
---
Imo you are defending bugtesda
---
I don't agree with OP's title at all to be honest, this isn't a situation of being over hyped at all, it's just a disappointing and bland place...
---
... Until you nuke it, then it literally becomes the best location in the game as far as farming legendaries goes  (Yes, better than Whitespring).
---
I don't mean that you are overhyping, I mean that we shouldn't overhype again.
---
Don't have the build? Get more players to compensate.
---
Ah that feeling, great stuff man!
---
The most likely answer is that you dropped/sold it by mistake rather than it being a conspiracy
---
I would love to see them expand on this for future dungeons. Make it so that if you nuke a dungeon it basically enables hard mode to spawn more/harder enemies...using mechanics that already exist in the game to add the ability to adjust difficulty of dungeons.
---
Not really. There are just posts on this sub saying that the Burrows should have been an Instanced raid etc. I'm simply point out that's on its way.
---
I'm not defending them until they learn how to hotfix a video game.
---
Yeah or that.
---
I guess my non-legendary lever action and scout armor are too OP for the burrows to be a challenge.
---
I believe it can occur every 3 hours, but if no one starts it then it won't happen.
---
Everyone probably playing with their new toy - the burrows
---
haha yeah.  i ended up using my saved atoms on sale camp items and some bundles, had to put them to use.  hoping the vendor update will draw players to others camps more.
---
You're not wrong in that respect. Tempering expectations is important.
---
This comment is obnoxious. 
---
Go find me one instance where they misrepresented this.  Not based on perception, or personal experience.
---
Show me one quantifiable fact that was a misrepresentation. 
---
Go ahead.
---
Definitely. I've been hoarding like 30+ plans for player vending.
---
I was under the impression that "dungeon" is an MMORPG term for an instanced/non instanced area outside of a main area for a solo/group to explore with the sole purpose of completing a quest. Not a literal dungeon...
---
i have been saving as much as i can really.  my camp is pretty low level tolerant and on a road so its hard to miss.  i've been saving bulk junk, plans/mods and anything consumable i can think of, on top of my high tier trades.
---
still got a few weeks anyways!
---
You need to polish up your critical thinking skills. 
---
They never lied. They didn't mislead. They gave a recommended player count and level and added some flavour text.
---
Do you survive the blast if you‚Äôre in the burrows?
---
\&gt;Tfw you live under the bridge east of harpers
---
Sorry m8 You misunderstood me. I simply stated lack of a challange in new instance that suppose to be 4 man run. I love stealth builds in every game and always favourite one above others.
---
Personal perception. 
---
Some of us had more reasonable expectations generating from our basic critical thinking skills. 
---
"Bethesda is releasing a dungeon. I've been in hundreds of Bethesda dungeons. That should be a fun little explore"
---
Because 99% of BGS dungeons are just that. Brief little bouts of exploration. Why would I expect anything different?
---
Platform?
---
Hmm true should be instanced but that‚Äôs the only flaw for me because of all I sayd in the thread...
---
Wow dude - I dont even know where to start with that post.
---
I expected somewhat decent content - shame on me for "hyping" myself up like that.
---
What you are saying is basically I should have known better - That Fallout 76 content overall is a massive letdown so not to think this will be any different - gotcha.
---
People have a right to be disappointed with this garbage - who exactly are you to tell them otherwise?
---
How do we still have such blind loyal fanboys telling everyone else how to feel about the game at this stage. 
---
You happy with the content? That's great- good for you.
---
For those that were not - its places like reddit that people come to leave their feedback - feedback that might actually be more useful to a development team than hearing from kiss asses how everything is  just great and disappointment in the last drop is only because people over hyped it.
---
Who would you either they listen to - you, or people telling them outright this sort of content is not acceptable.
---
Which type of feedback to you think is more useful and might result in all around better future content drops?
---
The Twitch player I watched clear it in 15 minutes the first time was killing everything in one or two shots and almost didn't take any damage.  It was incredibly boring to watch and I would assume to play.
---
I'm not sure how you could make a challenge for this type of player solo.  I'd rather see elaborate mechanics get added that requires multiple players.  Destiny raids like The Vault of Glass, that kind of thing.  Throwing stronger monsters will never do it.
---
Or [*Big Chungus*](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/843/chungcover.jpg) Roleplay ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
According to the description of the eggs, that's exactly what it sounds like. If they're going to call it a mascot head, then it's more than likely it'll also have a suit (would be very strange if it didn't) and the other mascot sets, which are the Mole Miner and the Mr. Fuzzy sets, both have a suit and head. This would also be our first not completely decrepit mascot set.
---
Learn to formulate better expectations. 
---
BGS says dungeon. I think BGS dungeons. Brief little jaunts with some atmosphere and a few notes. Maybe a boss. Maybe. Basically any cave in Skyrim.
---
I don't think "BGS said they are making a Dungeon. I bet it'll be just like dungeons from completely different companies who aren't BGS. Who aren't making this game. That makes total sense. Realistic expectation formed!"
---
I mean, it's total lunacy right. Look at say, Rockstar. They totally must be falling apart since all (vastly most) of its tweets and adverting are about red dead redemption and gtav. Nope. Both those games have a much higher rating than the 42% or whatever fallout 76 is at. I'd vote due to support and backing, and not a "here's the game onto the next" attitude. At the end of the day it's all on them, the game is already heavily discounted so they are losing money, and they should be.  GTAV(2013) -$20 new still. FO76-$25 new through Microsoft store at 6 months old. Screams success. I would want to sweep it under the rug too.
---
   
---
I dont drop it, I was in my camp   with three friends rebuilding my mutation for remove grounded and it disapperars
---
I don't know if this is confirmed but i think that if you one-shot them you don't get any legendary loot. If correct it would push players towards working together instead of being greedy.
---
Another possibility is that sometimes it just doesn't show up at first.
---
Well said sir
---
The modders works beth check, i know i‚Äôts more work than beth do usually but will help fallout 76, and i was referring to just weapons and armors, just think if you got a new armor and a new rifle after the burrow.
---
Didnt it also say we would come out with lots of XP and Loot?
---
Didnt see any of that either
---
I mean, that definitely plays a part. However, for my own experience - I did it solo in leather gear with only legendary effects for carry weight and a stimpack at 20% health. I used three diluted stimpacks through the whole experience, because I accidentally ran into a room full of Gutsy's due to how numbingly easy everything else was. My weapons of choice were a non legendary shotgun, and a vampire 44 pistol when I thought the dungeon would be harder.
---
I mean as a person who playes RPG and MMORPG games for over 20 years I could easily assume that ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù means increased difficulty instance for group of few players.
---
25%
---
I‚Äôve had a very good experience with the short barreled double gun. I mostly hip fire it. It‚Äôs turning things to paste inside about 15 feet.
---
Definitely not false advertising, did you pay for this expansion?
---
Gamers are hands down one the most entitled and whiniest groups on the Internet.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see any player base do anything but bitch and cry about everything.
---
It‚Äôs sad ...
---
The brutal truth is that Bethesda could release epic endgame content and the vocal meta is going to blast through it like a coke junky and come right on back on here and whine about it being stale.
---
Then you‚Äôll leave for the next big thing, burn through it, bitch online for months, and come right on back for Fallout 5 because you need a fix.
---
no...i think it is 1.25
---
This is the first game I think there is a real chance you could be a ghoul or a super mutant one day
---
I don't get why people say the assaultrom is too hard: only thing that sucks is that no one wants to do pylons due to 1) bloodied builds, or 2) burn all your stims trying to stay alive. Other then that, I like it! The rewards are a bit lame after the first few times but hey, the boss fight itself is the most use of brain power I used in a fight in this game.
---
Well done!
---
To be honest, I can't believe there's a level cap, to actually allow Bethesda to implement expansion and growth and control difficulty and drops.  No wonder it's all left to 1% RNG.
---
He does not ever infer that the "knock your socks off" stuff is specifically the burrows. 
---
The comments made are clearly in reference to the suite of content. Not just one specific thing. Nor doesn't give a time frame. He does not say "the stuff we are releasing in 4 weeks will know your socks off"
---
What you're doing here is even worse than what you accuse Bethesda of doing. 
---
You're taking comments out of context. You're then trying to imply those comments are being used to describe someething directly when they weren't, to further your narrative. 
---
It's low brow.
---
While you guys are bitching about content I‚Äôm still waiting for the game I paid $60 for twice to not crash or have some game breaking glitch every time me and my wife sit down to play it.
---
Actually sheepsquatch wasnt to hard lol
---
&gt;Why am I finding weapons in children‚Äôs bedrooms and ammo in fridges?
---
What if Little Timmy has to fend off a Death Claw huh? You want Little Timmy to die? Why do you hate Little Timmy so much?
---
And everyone knows if you don't put ammo in the fridge it will spoil smh
---
I like this idea, but it was also a lot of fun to hear it and not know how the hell to find him.
---
No. The knock your socks off comment was clearly referring to the entire suite of upcoming content and not the burrows specifically. 
---
He's taking things out of context to push his own opinion as more valid. 
---
It's obnoxious and under handed. Worse than what he's accusing BGS of doing.
---
How much for the BE handmade?
---
A few paragraphs and some flavour text hardly seems like over hype.
---
I have my entire weapon wheel full of weapons and apparently that's not a great build lol
---
Everyone keeps forgetting that you dont get more powerfull after lvl50.
---
A lvl500 players does the exact same damage and has the exact same amount of health as a lvl50 player
---
You don't need god-tier legendaries, I flew through it with All Rise.
---
I tried to explore as much as I felt reasonable, it's a nicely designed area but nothing special to hold your interest any more than other locations already in the game.
---
Notes and terminals in F76 are garbage, they don't hold a candle to the writing in previous fallout or elder scrolls games, and even if they did, they are a pale substitute for active storytelling.
---
People be running around with TSE weapons saying @this games too ez‚Äù lul
---
Yep i agree I think it should be with instances and that it got hyped tonlich by players i think it‚Äôs they will improve in that hopefully with instances but saying the dungeon is to easy isn‚Äôt a fault I mean if you look at any mmorpg then you also probably start at low level dungeons and when you get to a max level and go back to a low level dungeon then it‚Äôs suddenly easy... that what moost of the complaining people are ... high level going to a low level dungeon ( I know it‚Äôs not really about levels but it‚Äôs about the equipment) better sayd a high level of equipment full legendary player going to a standard gear non legendary dungeon 
---
For me It‚Äôs the  same as if anyone with level 50+ would say wtf I can one hit a mr farmhand in flatwoods or wtf I can one hit a level 1 mole rat 
---
It‚Äôs just not made for that
---
Why would someone want to get rid of a screen that takes one button to get rid of
---
My theory is that there will be regular updates of side quests that will eventually reward us with all the taxidermy mounts, and once we have them all the last quest will unlock the Sheepsquatch finally
---
IF both bullets hit, it's 25% stronger. The second bullet does not always hit because of a decrease in accuracy.
---
Thanks! Is this more or less calculated the same as just having a perk that would give 25%more dmg?
---
W...Water farming? Why would anyone do that?
---
Just nuke the place ;)
---
You're whole is the burrows part of something bigger? No then BGS used that to mislead us" thing is bunk 
---
You submarined your whole point by saying 
---
"Players began to speculate....."
---
I love when people win arguments against themselves
---
Offer
---
That's ok... IFF the rewards from it aren't essentially mandatory to have for future content. Unless it's going away sometime soon. There really is a "so what" response to "some people can't" that's valid, as long as what you get from it doesn't widen the gap between those 2 player groups even further.
---
You're going to get a lot of people disagree with my position with "better players should get better rewards" but I've seen it be utterly detrimental to multiplayer games long term. Devs tend to let the gap between "haves" and "have nots" get away from them and it's very hard to fix, especially if the content is time limited availability.
---
The sheepwhatever is hard for some but the end result from not being able to do it is not having some clothing and might have to buy your The Fixer or its plan from another player. That's very well designed actually.
---
Thanks for that! Had no idea about the accuracy drop off.
---
I usually activate all three Pylons myself and then jump up the roof so the Imposter can't reach me and let the others do the Boss killing while I use heavy guns to take out the adds from the High Ground (tm).
---
Idk I think there‚Äôs not much difference  the town is also easy to beat when you have really good equipment
---
It's poopy
---
Yea, because after 6 months there *totally* aren't that many players over level 100+. 
---
The difference between a level 200+ and a 100+ is... negligible. Leveling up in this game is rather quick (depending on how you play). They stated months ago that the average daily playtime for their playerbase is 4 hours a day. At 4 hours a day for 2 months, you've got to be at least level 100, or close anyway. 
---
Level 100 to 200+ players are not the minority you think they are. They are a significant portion of the active playerbase. In just about any world I load into, a quick sweep of looking at players on the map reveals that at least half are 100+. There are also plenty of players who create multiple characters at varying levels. Those people are probably they type to have at least 400+ hours in the game if they've been playing since release.
---
People. Are. Waiting. And. Wanting. End. Game. Content.
---
No way
---
This is not true.
---
It only naturally happens when people finish the quest other than that people have to spend a lot to start it and most don't anymore
---
ps4!
---
It's not just the robots everything is just dropping dead all over the map
---
Didn‚Äôt try this :) sounds awesome but any endgame equiped player would beat this easy anyways and probably complain again because it‚Äôs just not made for endgame equipment
---
I saw a post on here saying that it's in the game but not yet learnable (it's either been implemented wrong or it's bugged so is purposefully unobtainable) but I haven't seen any official comment from Bethesda on the subject.
---
That would've been cool, but we'd all be bored of it all by now if it was released day 1. Then we'd be demanding new content by now, just like we are.
---
I still head to the forest often, setting up shop in the food factory with a squad and handing out packaged food "rations" to people passing by.  
---
Making 'Murica great again, one salisbury steak at a time ;)
---
Almost no one complained about that aspect of The Burrows.
---
Oh rly? Explain why i find em like that?
---
better buff other stuff to comparable level
---
I haven't contacted them yet. I'm on PS4 original. It. Gives me one of those random "000.00.0" or something like that messages, but only for that character. I started a new one and it runs perfectly fine.
---
3k
---
Vampire gattling laser from the roof of the shack, keeps the pylon drain under control.
---
Thanks a lot of releasing this :)
---
I Tried making a mod like this myself by replacing the menu files with older ones but that didn't work :P
---
(no experience with flash sadly)
---
Would it be possible to make a mod that reverts the play menu to the old style as well?
---
I'm not interested in Survival and it's a bit annoying having to go through 2 menus every time.
---
Ah, I haven‚Äôt been on long enough today to notice it‚Äôs happening elsewhere as well :/
---
Blueprints
---
God that video is so misleading... 
---
In all they‚Äôve added maybe 3 hours worth of content and pushed back the biggest content addition by a month. 
---
Maybe if they had stuck to their roadmap and released things on time and together it wouldn‚Äôt have been such a massive let down. The burrows, backpacks, player venting, and camera would‚Äôve been a little less disappointing together. 
---
They totally [hyped](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview) the burrows:
---
‚ÄúFace challenging foes...‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThe Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúCollect your gear, call your squad together, and delve into The Burrows...‚Äù
---
None of these are true or realistic. I‚Äôm a filthy causal that‚Äôs been playing since day 1 beta. I‚Äôm only level 77, have no specific build or perk cards and use energy weapons and All Rise. 
---
I only used one stimpack the entire time and finished the Burrows mission by accident in 20 mins when I was trying to waste time exploring. The foes weren‚Äôt challenging, it wasn‚Äôt a challenge for a single 50+ Vault Dweller, and the idea of doing it with multiple people is painful.
---
Idk I think Bethesda is doing good steps to make the game better and better sure there are still things we can complain about but it‚Äôs getting better and I can‚Äôt deny that I have a lot of fun with the game anyways
---
How in vault 76‚Äôs name do you carry all that!
---
They shuffle the inventory some, not all the time, and not all of it, but some, mostly you can find the mods there, but the plans are harder to come by ü§ò
---
Maxed out strong back and wear a lot of pocketed armor
---
My problem with Sheepsquatch was that the one time it was recalled, I was the only player out of 6 there activating pylons and actually trying to fight it. The rest didn't seem to be interested in actually completing the event or in the concept of an event that requires team work, not letting the highest levelled player and hardest hitter attempt to carry the rest and continually die for it. I like challenge but that attempt with zero cooperation from the other players made it impossible, so me being salty about that is justified as I knew it wasn't a solo event. With a team it would be fun so I'll just assemble the team players I know to do it. 
---
This dungeon was pretty thin. The BoS aspect was two guys who died on arrival so little to add to the story, the challenge wasn't high, me at 119 and no really special weapons (a 3 star legendary Medics Gauss rifle does decent damage but certainly not OP. ) I explored it with a similarly levelled friend, both of us in power armour but even at this level other locations can be a fight to get through compared to this place.
---
We genuinely thought the end was a stage to try and soften players up for a tougher fight through more exploration, mobs and a boss. We actually explored to see if we missed something!
---
Oh, please elaborate who is then? And dont say bgs austin because that is still bgs
---
It's not a rare thing I've also seen it happening on the most recent YouTube videos
---
Yeah, that happens all the time.  To everything.
---
I was doing a quest (*the one in Fort Defiance*) and everything in the quest just suddenly died.  Sure, it made it easy because I just had to walk through but this kind of thing happens way too often.
---
I think it's most notable and easier to see in Watoga because you have specific spots where you can trigger the enemy spawns.
---
I upvote cause u is right but it is the games fault not peoples who understand the game better than some ppl. Devs need to make better/harder games to satisfy hardcore gamers desires on games.
---
Recommended MINIMUM was 2 level 50+. It states it was intended to be a challenge for 2 level 50+ players, but super geared and patient people COULD solo it.
---
The issue I think is that, while you can claim they in no way mislead anybody, it was extremely underwhelming. New players who get to level 50, and who enter that area, aren't going to realize it is anything more than any other random cave system. This is why it is underwhelming...
---
not unless you can find a starred, nah.
---
don't ask me why or to proof it, but it does more damage, thats why i'm using it   cheers
---
To be fair, the biggest complainers about stuff like this probably wont be satisfied by the actual vault raids either... The problem is people are expecting a challenge geared towards the absolute OP combination of gear that a significant segment of the players acquired through duping.  
---
Given the ridiculous weapon and armor legendaries spread around, they wont ever run into challenging things, because if its challenging for that segment of the players, its gonna be unplayable for anyone whom doesnt have the OP gear.  
---
TLDR: Dont complain about balance when you're running the game with the most OP equipment/perk combo's possible.
---
Weird, this is the first time I‚Äôve seen it happening!
---
You and people of similar level/ play time are not the player base. "You" need to realise this.
---
You can literally run a straight line, make a total of 6 turns (counting going up stairs) and you're done. Buddy and I the first time around took about 15 minutes slowly exploring. Then we did it again knowing the way... About 3-4 minutes.
---
Before the plan patch, the BOS mod plans for combat armor we're found in those train station vendors. However, when Bethesda changed the way rare mod plans show up at these vendors, most plans went from rarely available to 100% available but really expensive. The BOS mod plans however we're removed from vendors and now only drop from events and treasure maps.

+karma Awesome guide.

Random award from the event.
---
The problem is that this is not an offline, single player rpg. In an online, multiplayer game the word "dungeon" has a completely different meaning. I know this, you know this, Beth knows this.
---
Do you honestly believe that they don't know that :
---
1.) This game's playerbase is not exactly the same as for "traditional" BGS games, because this is NOT like a traditional BGS game and they said that much before launch.
---
2.) No matter how you look at it, BGS wanted to create a looter shooter/mmo lite. In those games, "dungeons" are instanced places where players usually could set a difficulty level before entering.
---
3.) So if they know that this game is different from their other games and that the playerbase is most likely coming from different games of this same looter shooter genre (Destiny, Anthem etc.) and are not necessarily accustomed to BGS' version of a "dungeon".
---
4.) The game that you developed is severly lacking in endgame content (the backbone of any looter shooter/mmo lite) so people get even more excited when a supposedly "high level dungeon" is introduced to the game. 
---
They know all of the above points and still did not clarify what they meant by "dungeon". They saw that the community hyped this update up to infinity and they still did not tamper expectations, knowing full well that what the majority of the community was expecting (based on BGS' communication) was not going to happen.
---
Even now that the update is out and people are dissatisfied, they just don't communicate ANYTHING with us.
---
If only people were like that. I just met actual scary people that seems they've joined the Atom Church. Damn.
---
Did you see the BOS Scribe on the ground close to the sewer entry point?
---
Wow, on one point you were right, about the plans, then state that fact to begin with and there would be no argument üòä
---
I think perhaps I‚Äôm noticing it today because it‚Äôs directly impacting my ability to earn atoms üòÇ
---
so you done all three levels and killed all the robots in 5mins?
---
Add me Cama23onte I‚Äôll launch the nuke!
---
Haha I‚Äôm on ps4 but this is a very cool idea! Happy birthday!
---
No probs, looking at your new link now.
---
I believe you of course
---
If you want a challenge, leave your power armor at your camp, don‚Äôt bring your TSE, and don‚Äôt bring any stimpacks. It‚Äôs not hard to make thing a more difficult if you pull your gear loadout away from your comfort zone.
---
Congrats on your 2K+ upvotes, says much about our need to sit and play with our junk :D
---
Sure I‚Äôll start in 20 mins 
---
Just need to have breakfast and maybe will join us
---
So the route gonna be like that
---
Meet near the silo -&gt; clear silo -&gt; launch nuke -&gt; move to harpers ferry -&gt; clear ground -&gt; clear underground
---
I think you're being a little silly. Players have every right to be disappointed.
---
First of all, don't compare this to "any other Bethesda game". This is an MMO. We already have hundreds of places we can have a peek through in Appalachia... players don't want more of the same, and this is COMPLETELY understandable.
---
It is an online game, and players want to start doing things with their friends that require a bit of co-ordination and planning. I've been told this place isn't even instanced, which is a huge mistake, let alone it requiring little to no planning anyway.
---
New content is great and all, but if it falls massively short of player expectations and is essentially just another random 2min sewer, then player backlash is fine.
---
Furthermore, this backlash is a GOOD thing... if everyone kept their mouth shut Bethesda wouldn't know what players do and don't want in the future.
---
If you got killed in that dungeon at any level above 50 you need to delete the game and move on. Rule of thumb in fallout 76 if you see one ghoul it's 100 more right off screen.
---
LOL, thanks for the thread this was a blast!
---
its higher level poopsockers who need to fuck off and stop playing this game and get a fucking life actually
---
Are you actually working for Bethesda marketing dept? I dont care what is practice in adwertising. Something was promissed and in my opinion not delivered. So im here saing "Hey, game devs I dont like this shit." And honestly i dont really care what some arrogant prick says is normal flavor text...
---
PSN: rustyboltz01     Lvl 78. I can play whenever and I‚Äôm happy to help :)
---
Any of these legendary protections? The issue is not a nerf to all legenedary spawns, but specifically to the bots.
---
I has happened to several people, it's very scary. I lost my best pice of armor. If it was dropped or sold by mistake then it most be because of the insanely unstable servers making lag not registering input on the client so it seems but in the background the server  is registering the input. So the answer I put down the controller. If you're in the middle of a fight just die. Lol. Just on questions was the weapon broken?
---
So what's the bug that made you lose atoms?
---
What you described is unobtainable atoms which you don't own.
---
Damn nice 
---
That‚Äôs gonna be cool
---
lol
---
You can say a lot of things. You can say that hamburgers grow on trees.
---
Same concept as dailies and challenges. 
---
Gives people a reason to log in every day to keep up. ‚ÄúI better do the dungeon or I‚Äôm wasting a reset!‚Äù
---
\&gt;level 50 characters aren't "endgame"
---
fuck off
---
I haven't tried the event yet, what kind of damage do pylons do? Energy? Explosive? Fire?
---
What he said
---
Yea. I wasn't expecting raid like content because they never once stated that it was. Raid based content is coming in the summer for Vaults 94 and 96. Making the statement that it would be a challenge and geared towards having at least 2 players who are 50+ can only be interpreted as something genuinely challenging (or at least to a degree). Even with limited expectations... I was... just... underwhelmed doesn't describe it. Immediately following after the new Encryptid event, plenty of people were expecting SOMETHING. This is more sad than outraging for me. Who though this could remotely be considered challenging? A level 35 with a super sledge would waltz in there and complete the quest/dungeon with minimal issues. For a SINGLE level 50+ player, calling it a easy would be a disservice to the word itself. And the boss is just a regular ass assaultron. Not buffed up in any way whatsoever. And the unique weapon is... blah as can be. How hard would be to mix up some crack, meth, pcp, and somehow get it to effect the assaultron? Make me fear for my life. 
---
Some people just don't understand that you can have next to no expectations for something, or be at all hyped for it, yet still be gravely disappointed.
---
I don‚Äôt think Watoga was stealth nerfed.  I think they broke the spawns with the sheepsquatch event.  Loot and spawn table changed for all of the robots at the event ended up breaking our favorite source for one star wooden legs.
---
At least it's not raining
---
&gt;Two level 50 characters aren't "endgame" ready. They probably don't have an optimized armor yet, they certainly don't have god-tier weapons of their level.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To be real, you could be level 50 and still not have some of the perks required for your build.
---
Level 85 Main, 
---
Best Weapon? - All Rise
---
Armour? 4 1\* Pieces (Standfast, 2 Unyeilding Leather Legs, Mutant Slayer Leather Arm)
---
PA? Excavator, with 1 Calibrated Shock or the Reward Ultracite (Repaired)
---
So, no Optimised Armour, no God -tier Weapons. 
---
So unless that Level 50 has level 100 friends giving them "hand me downs" they will not have optimised gear at all.
---
Well, less like you're paying but more like it it cost you something.  You could have read a much better comment.
---
If the developers cant create content that is challenging for the players who rock the best gear then they shouldn't have created those op weapons and armour in the first place.
---
Asking players to intentionally nerf themselfs is really stupid.
---
Burrows was easy because i had tse leather armour and tse stimpaks
---
Doesn‚Äôt affect the interior of the whitesprings resort.
---
The Burrows guarded by 50 Super Behemoths. Now that's more like it.
---
Theyve been slowly upping the amount a stash can hold and yea mines always full and i wish the limit was bigger but im good as long as they continue to increase the amount every so often
---
Yes there are.

My first one i took down playing hide and seek between trees. Now the only time i get worried is when you have 3 at the same time blasting you that you can not see the ground from the sky.
---
He isn‚Äôt.
---
They should hire some of the mod teams to take over.
---
Whichever one disproves whatever you're going to say. Nit pick somewhere else guy.
---
This is a great idea. But it seems bethseda can't make content unless the game has swords and a skeleton or vampire at the end of dungeon or crypt waiting to kill us. Because the barrows was watoga high school with an assualtron at the end of a 2 min dungeon.
---
Beg for God Howard to come down and smite you in pity. 
---
Also just go about doing quests/etc as normal. People get accidentally wanted all the time. People will usually come and kill you to get rid of the silly bounty. I get wanted all the time, and I kill people with those 5 cap bounties almost every day. Just a heads up, don't lurk around your camp in the meantime.
---
Except White Springs.
---
How was the burrows even bad? Why wasn't it hard enough for you?
---
I saw a video that says it's only good inside the capitol building and only if you nuke it when ghouls are spawning inside the capitol building. Useless if it's scorched or mutants.
---
Not it isn‚Äôt. They were speculating assuming means the person 100% believes something they have no evidence for. He didn‚Äôt do that.
---
As someone who played a lot of mods for fo4 I can say that modder's dungeons dont come any close to bethesda made dungeons. I could easily tell when I entered an area made by modders. (Not to take away from modder's efforts.)
---
Honestly don't care at all. 
---
I've taken a grand total of 1 picture since the start of beta.
---
hey they advertised it as challaging hard content to be tackled with a group
---
not just another generic cellar with a couple of mobs in it, because thats what it is, and its not even instanced... dafuq...
---
I expected a type of group dungeon like all other MMO games have, with couple of bosses with mechanics and trash mobs in between...
---
they could have asked some help from the ESO guys, those dungeons were pretty fun
---
and yes thats DUNGEONS, and they are INSTANCED, and take a TEAM of 4, but can be solod bij very competend players (this can be solod by everybody, especially since half the mobs are dead cuz its not instanced)
---
RAIDS are a completely different thing IMO
---
Load up World of Warcraft, go into dungeons, get nothing like Warcraft 3.
---
Load up ESO, go into dungeons, get nothing like Skyrim.
---
The fact that Skyrim is singleplayer game, makes it pointless to bring it into discussion about online game. Or you just trying to make point how bad are Skyrim dungeons from Online perspective and that is why F76 dungeons also suck?
---
Ok I have a question. Near hapers ferry is the dungeon now right? So you don't go into the dungeon you nuke it?
---
You didn‚Äôt lose anything, you just can‚Äôt get those FREE atoms as of now
---
Rad-Teddy?
---
I'll be back on in a bit my psn is Gofukyurslf326
---
Give this guy a job, damn that sounds good
---
Thanks man! I posted on the filthy casual sub too and lots of people came out!
---
Whatever shuts you up
---
While this is true, they did refer to it as both a "dungeon", "difficult" and "for groups". Drawing parrallels to any other online game, it's no wonder people expected something different. I have seen a few people trying to defend this, but nobody, including said people have acknowledged it as a "dungeon".
---
It was simply mislabeled and advertised in the wrong way.
---
I had a high speed minimum and was just using that on the many charred that spawned in a certain area cause it was doing good damage.
---
I've found 3* stars the 3 times I've been there. A few dropped 3* armor. RNG.
---
Yeah, I thought things were pulling in the right direction. I really hope it won't be a "one step forward, two steps back" kind of situation. It has me worried for future "dungeons" and "raids".
---
No, I'll give you an upvote for saying it in a non condescending way. 
---
It's your opinion and you're entitled to it. 
---
Just as I am entitled to mine: the burrows sucks. 
---
There's no justification whatsoever that developing this underwhelming and half-assed "dungeon" was given a higher priority than fixing the game's myriad of glaring flaws.
---
I thought this would happen
---
pls don't talk bad about my precious game mister
---
Ok I‚Äôm starting
---
Scotch beast sounds awesome.
---
Yes that's much better. I see nukesdragons lets you specify the perks you'll swap in when needed now, that must be new.
---
STR
---
My main has all the shotgun perks Shotgunner 3, Exp. Shotgunner 3 and Master Shotgunner 3 with the two weight reducing perks. I swap over to melee when needed but that's a bit of a pain. So I have 15 in STR. To be honest, again the ammo weight reduction you can bypass by just not carrying that much ammo. I carry about 250 max of shotgun shells and 500 max of .45s for my rifles.  That's 2 points you can put in the shotgun perks and net improvement of 10% or even to pack rat (this is the most useful weight reduction perk for me, along with the chems one).
---
PER
---
Skeet shooter level 3 makes a lot of difference to shotguns too, you could swap out the picklocks for these. Sniper is almost useless I feel. You could put that into Tank Killer, likewise with the picklock perks. I know it's a pain to load them out and in again but honestly the amount of actual quest barriers that need them are few.
---
END
---
Ironclad - great as long as don't use power armour. For my sniper build I left this out but just jump into PA when it all gets too much. You're getting more HP with every point here so the 7 alone is a boost regardless of which perks.
---
CHA
---
I also have 6 on both my chars, lone wanderer top card. I have the Field Medic to make stimpacks kick in quicker, Travel Agent I either swap in for a big journey or to be honest, I have 10K caps on each character so I just splurge. No need to tweak here really.
---
INT
---
I have a max of 6 here. Pharmacist 3 and First Aid 3 then I swap in Gunsmith etc. when back at CAMP. I dilute both Radaway and Stims along with Super Duper and Chemist which means I get 4 from one undiluted and sometimes (due to Super Duper) get double this. I never run out of these now even though I like to keep them fresh as I have a Vanguard build on my main char. To repeat myself (sorry), the Hacker perks are just dead weight. Swap in when needed. Locked terminals are even rarer than locked boxes.
---
AGI
---
I see you love rifles and shotguns, that's great and to focus on one would be to neglect the other and it's fun to do both so sneak is cool. Adrenaline is only useful in crowds of mobs as you know and then only once it has ramped up. I don't have it at this level yet to be honest with the other shotgun and rifle perks I have, it isn't needed. I opt to AP refresh here and Gun Fu level 3 which is useless if you don't use VATs. So you could live with this as-is.
---
LUC
---
Personally I scrimp here, I just have Bloody Mess on both my chars except the sneaky sniper build I've started to add the crits boost. Cap Collector again I max out the 1,400 caps you can get from selling to vendors now I (personally) consider this wasted. I only use those type of perks at the very start then soon get Bloody Mess once it's available.
---
I don't have much experience outside of ballistic builds so my melee and energy weapons are a little weak but it is feasible to have a decent shotgun/rifle build. It seems like me you aren't into PvP as it seems the only way to get ahead there is to min/max everything and you lose a lot of the fun to be head just roaming and killing mobs.
---
Hope that helps in some way.
---
Also play blindfolded, play while heavily intoxicated irl, play while tired. 
---
Just nerf yourself
---
This is a gift sent by Todd Howard
---
There is a chance for 3*s. Ghouls and robots. Saw 1 3* gutsy and a number of 3* ghouls on my 3 visits. It's all RNG.
---
Yeah
---
Op in this instance means ‚Äùliterally anything better then a lvl5 hunting rifle‚Äù
---
2,000 caps cost with a 3 hour server lockout. 
---
I‚Äôve seen it pop 3 times (I haven‚Äôt hopped looking for it) and not once did another player tag a pylon.
---
Nailed it.
---
Saves time
---
That WS etiquette flew out of the window first week of release, after people tried and people didn't give a sh#t about it. It's  has been "First come, first serves" rule since then, since it is more solid rule.
---
Yes that's where the burrows is, when nuking the area any building you enter is also nuked and higher enemies/legendaries spawn within it.
---
As far as I know if players are in it at the time of the nuke it won't spawn these glowing ones etc..
---
Is the Flowery Deathlaw Easter Egg the first one? I just read this post and claimed my first one mere minutes ago.
---
I use a recon combat shotgun with hardened receiver. With the right perk cards it deals 228 damage, lvl50.
---
90% sure it's a bug. Similar to how we had Sheepsquatch attacks in workshops for weeks prior to the event
---
Almost good news. Just checked out the tattoo parlor after regular checks and it's now boarded up. I am assuming they are aware now and patching it :)
---
The gun has better range and accuracy than some other shotties I tried. What platform are you on? Again, a lot depends on your perk cards
---
Because surprice surprice ITS NOT FREE.
---
You paid for it when you bought the game, the stated that all future dlc would be included whith the purchase.
---
I am pretty sure you aint playing this ‚Äùfree dlc‚Äù without owning the actual game?
---
But hey if the fuck up a patch and break something people shouldn‚Äôt complain because the patch was FREEEEEEEEEEEE
---
And asking for non instanced content to be balanced towards gear that was supposed to be extremely rare isnt stupid? &lt;.&lt;
---
Guilty! Team Whitesprings while drunk is hilarious.
---
Thanks man.
---
Not having any similar issues on my One X. Maybe try doing a full clear of your cache?
---
No, im only asking that they would have made it a bit harder then literally any other place in the game.
---
I dont care about loot, im lvl 220 and have some good armour and weapons, i just want a reason to use them and exiting new content.
---
I dont want to shoot myself in the foot before the race in order for the race to be challenging
---
oh thats not why but sure
---
I agree, the average player base doesnt have god tier weapons. People need to calm down and not over hype things.
---
not salty, what you had said was just unneeded. you didnt really add abything to my post
---
If you go in the north you're half way to the end line so j can see that
---
Crippling the wings will cause them to land and stop spamming their screech attack. Grab a shotgun and rank 1 of the Enforcer perk, which has a chance to instantly cripple a random limb. You don‚Äôt need to use VATS or specifically aim for the wings, so just keep blasting away at its body and it should land, then blast it in the face with your weapon of choice. 
---
You‚Äôll almost certainly need Power Armor, Stims, and some chems to help you out while you‚Äôre still working on your gear and perk loadout, but eventually you‚Äôll be able to slap them down in well under a minute without breaking a sweat. :)
---
I dont see how it was false advertising, "gather your squad" included, without OP gear its defo handy to have more people there, currently its a curbstomp because everyone is running it, just like how you can get shredded without the right gear doing whitesprings nuke solo, but that never happens because "the squad" is literally half the server running around in a group mowing everything down.  
---
This is exactly what I expected to be honest, and when I run it with "normal" gear (as in no crazy legendary combo's) I sure can use a second guy to put down fire on the horde.  
---
With people swarming it currently its just hoping you can tag something before everything is dead, just like whitesprings, but I never expected it to be instanced.
---
After reading about The Burrows here, I went in expecting it to be a bit of a cakewalk considering how people made it sound like 
---
It took about 40 minutes. Lots of minutes exploring the place, and even more spent killing the Ghouls and "I'm-About-To-End-This-Man's-Career" Gutsys
---
That just requires unplugging your power cable from the back of the Xbox right? I'll give that a try.
---
Bravo or Charlie ?
---
"Don't get too excited about new content for the game, it's not Bethesda fault it's the customers" that's basically what I'm hearing here and that is insane.
---
Also Heavy Builds gear towards carrying alot of guns and ammo to every fight
---
I‚Äôm joining you now
---
They do energy damage, but since it is applied by an effect rather than direct damage it seems armor does not do much, if anything (tried a few different armors with little if any difference). You just have to pump some chems and spend some stimpacks.
---
Up to u mate, lemme get some food and I‚Äôm teleporting
---
It's gonna be stuck in my head all day now. I think I'm okay with that.
---
No it does not start any quest
---
Bravo
---
I entered from the north burrows manhole entrance. But I didn't start the quest just wandered around the first level before leaving, as I had loads of junk on me I didn't want to lose, by getting swamped by a horde of ghouls
---
Or you could push and hold the Xbox logo on the console until it shuts off. The green splash screen will appear when powering back up if done right.
---
So its only for noobs? Sounds fair
---
Oh, you can nuke it?
---
there are less 100+ because most of them stopped playing because there is no more content to do in game
---
Upvote for the switch on beach boys. Nothing against them as a band, but the song they used isn't one of which I'm a fan.
---
I agree to disagree on Country Roads.
---
I carry a lever action, gatling gun, hunting rifle, tesla, and a melee. All the rest of the slots are filled with explosives, throwing knives, and peepers. I've got something for every occasion and it's fun
---
Thank you for this feedback, Kuritos! It's definitely something we've seen suggested before, but I'll make sure this thread is shared with the devs again.
---
Have a great day :)
---
I just want a behemoth companion, that wears a frilly pink frock, rides a tiny little pushbike, will take massive shits on commands in other players camps, and is oddly sexually excited whenever he sees a toaster.
---
Oh and he carries a MASSIVE BBQ for me.

Thanks for your answer! I‚Äôll not be getting it then.

Vats doesn‚Äôt count for aiming. It‚Äôs a decent weapon but it‚Äôs not godly.
---
I have a lever action, plasma Gatling, sniper, power fist and a shotgun. Those are the only weapons I use from the weapon wheel

People can get lucky. Got my TSE gatling plasma on a legendary deathclaw out of the blue. It's level 35 but it shreds anything in the game so far.

Remember when Destiny realeased, Bungee hyped it up by say its story was on par, constantly using the story as "marketing talk". Then it came out. The story lasted one hour. "Marketing talk" doesn't mean shit.

---
The era of old super hard mmos are long gone (like the ol everquest where when you die you lost all your equipment in a body). Instant gratification and somewhat fun are most modern games are aiming now to stay alive.
---
I'm pretty sure most of this tales are made this way
---
It a great feeling taking one down.  My first one i was lv 30 with only hunting rifle and shotgun. No big perk cards as i was mostly a builder. I was at the ammunition workshop up in Savage Devine up north. The first time defending it was from a SB. Lv 60. Took me and my about 30 to 40 min i had to place turrets outside just to help me. It a great feeling. I solo alot I'm now lv 98 just did the BOS quest solo at lv 91 had 4 SB to take down. I can stand my ground against them but still take about 10 min or so. Rifleman perks and bloody mess. Using a gauss rifle with 30% to animal. I dont have this fancy up there TSE. I enjoy the hide and seek kind of attack.
---
It‚Äôs more like both the players and Bethesda are making problems, Bethesda isn‚Äôt providing enough information on the content they are releasing which in turn will lead to the players overhyping activities due to how vague they are. It doesn‚Äôt help that the community team for Bethesda is terrible either. You can‚Äôt blame people for getting angry at Bethesda when they are pretty vague in any sort of news. But the players themselves are expecting way too much and you can tell by the amount of posts we see that it‚Äôs a never ending cycle of getting hyped, building hope and then getting disappointed.
---
Ghouls are still humans....technically...
---
That was also mine. I was level 42 and took on a 65 SB solo. It was intense and if it wasn't for my handmade I wouldn't have done it.
---
Spicy internet brinkmanship +1
---
That's not the players fault for having great weapons, that's an internal balancing issue with the game itself. God like weapons shouldn't exist, I'm glad the game has so much variety but weapons that can do that amount of damage aren't healthy for pvp or pve. Only players to blame are ones that use exploits and again that's not 100% they're fault the game shouldn't have those exploits in the first place. I enjoy this game but in order for it to be better, we cannot put the blame anywhere else than in the game itself.
---
Survival doesn‚Äôt have to be about killing other players though. I‚Äôve created 2 alts since Survival was released, I like the added tension and challenge of other players being able to come after me, I‚Äôll defend myself if attacked but I rarely strike first, only in moments like when I find myself in the top 3 and start getting hunted, which was much more common when top 3 was longest life rather than most player kills.
---
Definitely keep it and use it for your first shot against tank enemies. All legendaries are good if they fit your build.
---
The event only has a 10 minute timer. Short enough if makes it difficult to server hop into one. 
---
It's also expensive, with no guaranteed decent rewards, so I don't expect it to happen often.
---
It's a bug. God Howard has confirmed.
---
I have to do the glass caverns quest. Slightly terrified at level 34. Been doing most things alone, now might just have to do this the friendly way.
---
I had the radio on last week while adventuring. Someone nukes Fissure site prime so I go over there and meet on the edge of the nuke zone with other players for the nuke to hit. After it hits we all start running at the Queen as Country roads started playing on the radio. It was perfect.
---
Fuck the DMV tho, I mean that is a pure horror element they added into the game.
---
Those bunnies are no match for my Holy Handgrenade.
---
Its a server wide event and theres a good chance most people will join. The rewards I‚Äôve gotten haven‚Äôt been great for my character but they werent terrible drops
---
It didn't fix the issue unfortunately. Froze instantly on entering West Tek Research Facility.   
---
Thanks for trying though :)
---
Cool thanks, will give it a go later
---
Thanks!
---
Ah ok so you want to tell me that the raid dungeon is free to play since yesterday and it's so crappy that you need stronger enemys in there? Haha ok why not, I don't have play for 2 month course I got no internet and I'm lvl 156 but ok for looting legendarys this would be the best way right now. Have to take a look when I'm at home today. 
---
Thanks dude ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I'm exactly the same but with one single armor ignore perk. I have every weight reducing perk equipped except for Demolition Express. I have an anti-armor 25% faster fire rate gatling gun. It's only a 2* legendary. I do have all the heavy weapon dmg related perks, but I only equip them when farming legendaries or fighting the queen. Did not equip them for this dungeon. I didn't expect anything extreme, but certainly at least some challenge, especially as this released just after the new Encrytid event. There's like 20 ghouls, 6 so Mr. Gusty's, and one single assaultron "boss" that was weaker than a single Mr. Gusty. What the hell was this "dungeon" even suppose to be? And the "well rewarding" loot is pure 1* legendary trash weapons and armor. That's not loot. If you don't want to give us legendaries, then give use plans, recipes, unique apparel from that location, or a good haul of junk. Speaking of apparel, in the second Inside The Vault preview of The Burrows, there's an image of someone wearing an old deep sea diving suit, and it's a unique armor set that you obtained in Fallout 4's Farharbor dlc at the end of a quest. This isn't anywhere or rewarded in any way (to my knowledge) in Fallout 76.
---
With limited and reasonable expectations, if I had to describe how underwhelming this was, it's like opening a box of donuts to find only  a single quarter of a donut left after someone brought them over. Like, why the hell did you even bother offering this to me? Even for people who only like a donut once in a while would be rather disappointed and offended at this. I'd rather you just ate that last bit of donut and never offered it to me. They were your donuts and you bought them with your money. That's perfectly reasonable, but it only comes off as scummy and as a second though when they only felt bothered to offer you a piece when there was basically nothing left. Or being the guy who puts a 99% empty milk bottle back in fridge and saying there is milk left. A tablespoon of milk = there's no damn milk left Are you passively aggressively trying to piss everyone off around you?
---
Got this earlier was quite annoyed by it
---
It always fun in intense battles.
---
I had no build just things that made me do more damage or better vats and used ‚Äúthe fixer‚Äù and ‚Äúall rise‚Äù the entire time and I found it fun. It did abruptly end which is what I‚Äôm mad about. They hyped it up and the quest itself sucked not the fighting through it
---
k thank you
---
It sends out a server-wide notification. I would wait until you're on at a peak time, when there's plenty of other high level players on the server. The drops are iffy, you have the potential of getting some cool (albeit rare) sheepsquatch clothing/headpieces though. 
---
Keep in mind, replacement boards cost around 2k caps, and that there's still other players out there triggering the event at this point in the release.
---
I have one that fires 4 shells. But I'm on pc.
---
It's all the same company. ESO has issues, but you'd think they'd learn s thing or too. And even then your comment is dumb statement.
---
What is it with people like you that you can't be measured and appropriate, you have to attack everything? Grow up, bud.
---
Just ignore people like him. They don't come to discuss anything and just want to attack everyone.
---
I guess depending on who you end up with your mileage will vary.
---
Personally I used to carry a quad gamma gun and plenty of ammo as means to express my displeasure by means of 'feeding the bloaties'.
---
This usually brought a more... cooperational spirit on people.
---
Not had it trigger yet, for me. Seems everyone is down in the Burrows atm, despite the complaints. Had to server jump about 14 times to find a virgin one.
---
I can do that if you can wait another 4 hours
---
What about setting a max level? I love the game but hate grinding and will likely never get to or past level 100. Why should there be content closed off to me, and the 90% of players like me?
---
The dungeon is so so but when nuked it produces a crap ton of legendaries, just look at other reddit posts, one person got about 15 legendaries from the place and if people join it respawns more glowing ones 
---
I've had this happen to me before. I bought an AAE combat rifle with perception and during a SBQ fight it just completely vanished from my inventory. No I didn't sell it. No I didn't drop it. It was gone and I had to pay an arm and a leg to get a new one.
---
k,i will wait for you if nothing apears
---
I've been on the lookout for an AAE 90% reduced weight 50cal, they're scarce lol
---
Sure ign UCHITH
---
Its NOT a Dungeon... Its just a new location. That's why iam mad about it
---
I carry two auto rifles - one AA handmade and one AA modified pipe rifle.  I also carry a furious explosive double barrel shotgun.  And my trusty spiked fire axe with 50% speed modifier.  For big battles I pull out my prime 2 shot Gauss rifle.   And yes I carry grenades (nukas and MIRVs in particular). 
---
If you want a challenge my advice would be survival.   I hated it at first but I find myself going in there more often now to calibrate my weapons and techniques.  So far so good.  I‚Äôve more than held my own.  My kill ratio is about 8:1 and a couple of my deaths were self inflicted lol. 
---
I had a fun moment last night near WS with two players that must have had the killer sentinel armor jumping up and down.  I hit one guy several times with the handmade and as he approached I lit him up with grenades and a couple of mines.  His buddy starts shooting with a TSE and was surprised when I took multiple hits (thank you fireproof) and I was able to stealth and fall back.   Good times.
---
Actually you have clearly failed to understand anything I have said, and have opted instead to focus on a microcosm of information and rail against percieved criticism instead of listening to the efforts to offer you advice.
---
I have demonstrated enough to show that her actions were not as you characterize them, and in saying you chose to respond as you did while knowing how to better handle things you make clear your intention is the condescenion and instults merely veiled as efforts to help.  Your willful mischaracterization of myself and the op combined with you active choice not to understand her side of things makes further effort on my part pointless.  My apologies for thinking better of you and wasting both our time.
---
Yes. Yes yes yes. Let's talk mechancis. 
---
Every time you eat a corpse, there should be a chance to gain an effect/mutation called wendigo. Significant increase to unarmed damage, increased movement speed, increased health, significant reduction in weapon (both melee and ranged) and armor effectiveness, and hunger can only be resolved using cannibalism. Players that die with the effect drop wendigo teeth. And make the power armor bug a feature!!
---
Now, input from others. 
---
1. How do we "cure" it? Death?
---
2. Do we make them hostile? What about Adventure mode? I play Survival primarily, but maybe some Adventure mode players would be amenable to wendigo player hunting.
---
Adventure or Survival? Either way, what a dick.
---
Do you like fedoras?
---
Because you get the same fedora over and over and over and over...
---
I say do it once just to do it and then forget it exists.
---
I‚Äôm rakishly good looking in a fedora, so yes.
---
It‚Äôs a good thing I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing with my perk cards.
---
This is why I generally find myself creating a new character to try a different build shortly after hitting the level 50-60 range. I have no interest in farming WS for legendaries.
---
Best challenge added to the game so far imo is Survival mode. Going up against high level well geared players as a low level with maybe a couple of legendaries scrounged from the Leader of the Pack event is much harder than any challenge this game‚Äôs AI could ever present.
---
I don't feel one way or the other about the Burrows, but I'd love to see some statistics on player level distribution. I tend to agree with you, there are tons and tons of us. Even if you're just playing casually you'd get to be pretty high level at this point in time - higher than lvl 50 surely, which would make the Burrows easy.
---
Sharing this one with the team! Thank you mate :)
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
Is there an end all OP set for PvE? I use a shotgun build with random armor pieces.
---
Oh that? It‚Äôs just  cloth to make my civil war hats. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
yeah
---
How about don't post about it
---
They paid for their power-leveled account and now they are bored that the game is "easy"
---
I actually liked it and thought it was fairly straightforward
---
They should be under Floor Decor. You might see the Plush Bunny shop item or a mini figurine instead of the Deathclaw Egg.
---
My first was from line in the sand at 40, I like using events to get fast travel points. Then if it looks doable I stay. That was kind of underwhelming because of the other players there, but then one attacked my base near Lewisburg and wrecked my shit. Had three rocket turrets two heavy laser turrets and one heavy turret (the rest are made to hit ground enemies that get in the base). Those got it to about half health and had to take it down the rest of the way myself. Had to replace all my turrets, rocket turrets are expensive to maintain.
---
Harp on, I see what you did there lol
---
Buy more? Absolutely not
---
Haha yeah. I like the idea of adding a few behemoths in the mix though
---
what are the effects?
---
Having an empath in your team is a great advantage. You'll make your experience harder and you'll help your team tremendously
---
Will take a look at it when I take a break from work. Thanks dude and have a good hunt ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Yeah I did it five times all I got was a fedora plus the thing the imposter drops 
---
I gave up
---
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "smarter" enemies? I can't think of anything that really outsmarts my ability to melee other than a Scorchbeast flying. That isn't really that big of a deal considering I can take it out in three hits or less once it lands. Other than that the only other thing that could outsmart melee is another player in PvP but I really don't count that. I've been ganked by plenty of melee PvP players in like two hits even in a full squad.
---
&gt; "*They want tougher, how about a Mirelurk Queen HORDE down there, in close quarters!!! Is it hard enough now???*" 
---
This made me laugh so hard, my coworkers started looking at me.
---
Yo, tommy ! Remember me ? Kadem-Ho, I just sent you a msg on PSN. Holiday next week so nuked burrows farming a lot !
---
I finished the Encrypted event yesterday, forgetting my radio was on, its volume returned after the event finished with a big mighty ‚ÄúWEST VIRGINIAAAA‚Äù
---
Honestly think every one of the weekly rewards I would have sold to a vendor if they dropped of a regular legendary... every single one has been mediocre and not worth the effort.
---
And my post would do anything to prevent it or cause it to happen?
---
Have you seen how many posts about how amazing the dungeon is and how many legendaries it produces when it's nuked. I'm sure Bethesda will see all of those and draw their own conclusions.
---
Yeah that is true
---
So casuals could do it, then it gets nuked.........
---
I have neither of those
---
The only enemy thats worthy is a one thats thinking, so I referenced PvP mostly. You must have moved incorrectly as a squad, without tactical control of the map. You should be able to deny access to your team to any melee PvPer without stealthboys, most of the time. Pretty much each time a melee player manages to get to you means you made a mistake. At least 100% of the times I was killed by melee was because of my own mistakes that were cleverly used by my opponents.
---
Hey murdomcsalt, we are looking into this one. The camera is still planned to be released next week - the associated challenges aren't intended to be available at the moment.
---
Thank you for bringing it to our attention.
---
Double damage if it at full health, uh hmm 25% faster fire and I think the other one was Lomb damage.    It weights a ton and isn‚Äôt that great.  I vendored mine.  Already got better.
---
Furious is one of the best perks in the game, not the best on a slow melee weapon, but it's still dang good, especially if you have a bunch of 2h perks to go with it
---
That looks SO dope
---
Truth!
---
Yeah but with the perk you get an extra 25% of the original 2 shot damage so it's still more
---
I think this should be applied to the voices in general. I often hear an enemy in the correct direction. But when looking for it, they are sometimes 3 floors above me while it sounds like they are just around the corner. In short, audio should be more effected by distance.
---
&gt; This totally was not a dungeon and calling it that just shows how out of touch with online rpgs the devs are.
---
was this not clear at release? no raids no dungeons literally no form of end game content ,legendary loot is pure fucking slot machine (and im sure slots ahve better odds) even anthem has more end game content than fo76
---
I dropped mine at lv 71 this week. I either tweaked my build or something changed because I went from leave server to consistent kill.
---
They marketed it as a challenge for seasoned players 50+. I watched level 30 players run through it yesterday. I think people have a right to be disappointed.
---
Glad to provide some laughter!
---
They pushed back a camera because they were having issues.... you are asking too much from them fam
---
Yeah happened to me with a TSE 10mm.   Just...poof
---
Ya idk about that. I mean I probably have like 220-230 hours and I def play other games, and work, and watch TV.
---
I cant stand country roads or the beachboys. I much prefer the wanderer, or the inkspots, or the andrews sisters, or grandma plays the numbers.
---
I meant, you know them ghouls with like 4x 2 chems?
---
I get it sometimes if I'm encumbered and die that I can't re spawn anywhere... seriously annoying when you're farming for junk and can't pick your bag up.
---
&gt; Do we need to pay for quality DLC? 
---
i mean anyone who expected free content to be at the level of paid DLCs like far harbor kinda set themselves up for disappointment
---
I disagree. A lvl 50 player in any unmoded power armor with all 3 two handed weapon perks maxed and All Rise could breeze through this. That is no dialed in meta build with just a basic quest reward.
---
I'm not trying to be mean, but you obviously seem to be in denial that this game absolutely does lack and needs end game content. 
---
I've personally played since launch and took my time wandering the wasteland completing all the quest. Now I have just a handful of things to keep me occupied with 95% just farming legendaries in various locations.
---
Only because you are all cowards with creepy power fantasies.
---
Seem quite a few 3* after last weeks patch.  More than usual it seems to me
---
Well, you were right
---
I'm level 72 and was finding the game pretty easy with my Excavator Armour and SuperSledge. Now I play as a Civil War re-enactor without power armour and only using period weapons. Much more fun.
---
&gt; And we get lackluster content, that obviously wasn't tested. Who at Bethesda thought this was challenging?
---
game journalists probably
---
did you go down the lift shaft? according to another redditor, there are 3 levels when doing the quest 1st is anyone has access. The 2nd and 3rd are instanced. Ghouls on the 1st, robots and end bosses on 2nd and 3rd. 
---
I didn't get very far as I had only just discovered Harpers Ferry, and spent the majority of the time killing super mutants in the North Burrows church area. only popped into the dungeon to have a look around
---
I'd argue that it's more sensible. I play like that in most games if I have a choice. In a small group or solo, no sane person goes flying in with an axe. Why wouldn't you sit 200m away and headshot them?
---
too bad its dog shit now
---
You're not a fan, you're a heckler.
---
Hey I got that much damage with a 3 star bloodied gatlin gun I found plus with my perks and power armor it has armor penetration  
---
Guess a bloodied shotgun would still be better raw damage though
---
Shame is I don't think I'll use it not going for that sort of build
---
This is exactly the issue though. They made shitloads of melee damage bonuses to offset the advantage you have at range, which means that both melee and sneaky sniping are op. What's left? Mid range shooty business. 
---
So what's the solution? Nerf two or boost one?
---
Expecting half decent content promised by developers ins't over hyping.
---
Timmy sucks. I stole all his ammo. Hope the ghouls get him.
---
I ran it solo (no people were even close to Harpers Ferry) in T60 PA with normal 50cal, i have 3 maxed Heavy cards and stabilized card. So pretty much basic heavy setup. I met few groups of 6 ghouls  and room with 4 Gutsys. So pretty much same lvl and amout of enemies you can find in any location... So why was this called challenge?
---
every plan you can get with technical data
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/sT35DY6](https://imgur.com/a/sT35DY6)
---
You can't charge up the rifle before entering vats, that will almost 99% end up in a miss. 
---
Without the charge up, you only deal 50% of the listed damage. And if you're going to compare, you need armor penetration on your gauss too. 
---
But the gauss is a very buggy weapon, and need it's own thread again to raise focus on these problems.
---
&gt; Here's my issue. I WOULD pay for it, IF they delivered amazing content. I have zero problem paying $15 per month for a premium online Fallout experience
---
i would have no issue paying for expansion packs and a sub like wow if the content was great
---
You people complain about pretty much everything....
---
I know when I loot them from power frames, they are only 25%. Anything I loot laying around the world or rewarded from completing an event are much higher.
---
Ever tried 'The Long Dark'? That's pretty tough. You have to like endless trudging through snow though.
---
They didn't market it as end game, BUT they did market it as super hard content which it was not. So people have legitimate complaints about it, so don't sit around and try to put down and dismiss people's complaints.
---
Caps at 5 for +50% damage
---
How do you start the new quests ?
---
I checked the map board last night, still only had the 4 quest i have done :/
---
Everything sounds really cool...except maybe the ‚Äúendless waves of....‚Äù. Probably best to keep dungeons and horde modes separate.
---
And here I though my TSE powerfist couldn‚Äôt be beat üòû
---
It should be in the game at some point. It's listed under unique Apparel in the large hardbound Vault dwellers Survival Guide.
---
i would pay for an expansion pack and a sub,just give me quality fallout content like ESO
---
Yeah, i love it when i spend 1750 to summon the impostor and when i die someone will rush to take my junk. There's so much to do during the event and yet they waste time picking my 3 aluminium and 1 cooper.
---
Bank account? There‚Äôs a place to store caps other than your inventory?
---
Im 322 with 900+ hours and I have never looted a tse... lol
---
They were always using stealthboys to gank us. Nothing you can do about that. People still use cheating method to stay invisible all the time so no VATSing them. Melee is entirely OP with the right build. Even if we saw the person attacking before hand they wouldn't take hardly any damage from us. Three people with heavy TSEs couldn't take down one person several times. Granted these were ALWAYS people who were level 200+ who were going around doing this. It's not a matter of making mistakes. The game is just broken like that. When people can VATS you in midair from 20ft away somehow and take you out in one-two hits when they can absorb like 20 no problem is entirely broken and OP. I don't really PvP though because of those very people. Everyone seems to have a god build that's broken so why bother fighting them.
---
Biv scared the crap out of me when I first heard him speak. I quite liked the fact that I could hear him upstairs, but he was a little too loud to be realistic.
---
Man I get it all the time at west tec! Entering the building with my fingers crossed if I die In there so it doesn't freeze and I can collect my junk or loot that legendary that I blew myself up with my explosive pump killing it ha... how many bugs can a game have, seriously??
---
Correct.
---
Yeah, when you're struggling to implement the technology from Pokemon Snap, QoL UI overhauls are kinda back burner for the moment.
---
No it‚Äôs instigating, limb damage and reload which is actually not too bad
---
That's one ... erhmmm two! for r/fo76bearhunt
---
TSEs wont do against cavalier with dense mod and fireproof perks. Teslas work great when used in a team as they stagger often and get through all armors. One of the most stressing things for a cavalier builds. If you can't use vats you gotta rely on stagger.
---
Thst church has been in for at least a few months, i stumbked upon it a long time ago and thought it was a cool.little unmarked lication
---
&gt; Who though this could remotely be considered challenging?
---
game journalists obiviously
---
i can hook u up right now.
---
Classical....only classical
---
This is the inofficial motto of Mulder from the TV series "The X-files".
---
I feel old, I even had the same poster as him in my room back in the days.
---
Anyway, Google it, it's an UFO over a treeline with this words written below.
---
No, it makes it stupid that people strictly attack Bethesda for it simply because its become cool to hate them.
---
k join me and i will come in like 10 min
---
Sounds like that was the difficulty level people were asking for... we got it, but it‚Äôs DIY.
---
Is it the part where you need to access the computer and then has to press E for the computer to progress but it does not tell you to do so, so most people just back out with Tab and assume it is broken?
---
They‚Äôve been in the game since day one. Maybe one day we will get pets but idk
---
The only time I lag on my PS4 is if there are more than two or three players close to me. The vast majority of the time I have no lag at all.

---
Sneaking down the street checking for ghouls and mutants then that song comes on in a house somewhere I always throw my radio on and walk like a boss. It's a good feeling, especially when the trees are orange
---
Purified water sells well.
---
I mean a lot of Skyrim‚Äôs dungeons are caves....
---
I‚Äôve find memories of the pop revolver.  Was using it passed lv50.  Every now and then I make one and head over to Morgan town :).  I just wish there was a legendary version of it.  Been looking but found nowt :(
---
Would love a tidy version to go with my tidy PA.
---
I could understand if the main boss enemy was imposter squatch level of difficulty and that's why they died.
---
But yeah if they died to what's existing there now, they must have gone down there with no armor and only armed with flare guns lol
---
Same, i only has tse drill but oh well
---
Sweet some loose... screw
---
So hold over from fallout 4 copy paste then shame
---
Bring me a drink!
---
FO76 isn't a MMO
---
Wait, people complain about game content in this sub now?
---
The singer does a great job, it's my favorite song in this one!
---
It will make the gameplay all the sweeter.
---
But seriously, does your ISP use wires or wet string? I can sympathise. I used to have a service like that.
---
Any idea why whenever I do the tec data drop I only get a stimpak and a couple of random things  but never a plan. Have tried about 50 times with various numbers of data stacks.
---
I would love it if someone could match the old FO4 Pipegun Carbon Fiber Retextures...
---
Sounds like you're just getting unlucky. At this point the game is playable all the way through with no less crashes than any other Bethesda game.
---
Yep, people here actually think you should not expect anything of quality. They are so lost in fandom that they think bad content is the players fault for hyping too much.
---
I dont like the team part of this idea. You basically have to have 2 people to even complete the mission and I dont team up often. So what about us solo players ? We just can never do the mission ?
---
For me personally, I was very underwhelmed by the Burrows. I wasn't expecting anything extremely grand like an actual raid, because they never said it was going to be one. But when you make statements that it's 50+ level content and that you probably should have at least 2 people and expect a degree of challenge, it's genuinely difficult to not be disappointed even with limited expectations. I was expecting at least a few higher health and decently hard hitting enemies, and one boss that would warrant me keeping my distance. I didn't get anything within the same universe as that. This also immediately followed the new Ecryptid event, which is challenging, especially at first, so plenty of people were expecting a degree of that. Hardly any player could refer to this as challenging. It simply isn't. My disappointment is like someone offering me a donut, hands me the box they're, opening it, and there's a quarter of a donut left inside. Like, why did you even bother offering this to me? I'd rather you just kept your donuts to yourself. You bought them yourself and you don't have to offer them to anyone, but if you're going to, why would you offer such an insulting amount? What's next? You're going ask if I want coffee while you're getting one yourself, I say yes, and you come back with a near empty cup of coffee for me? This dlc just feels insulting, especially in regards to the unawareness and misuse of the word "challenging".
---
And yes, there are plenty of people over level 50. and over level 100. Someone drops a nuke on the fissure site prime and guess what? 8 level 100+ players tend to show up. Anyone who says level 50 to 100+ players are an overwhelming minority are clearly either lying or really don't play that much at all, and/or they simply don't pay attention to that. I've played this game for too long and on a consistent basis to honestly say that hardly anyone is within those level ranges. It's horrendously untrue.
---
Damnation!
---
I have the Appalachia radio though. That is nice.
---
OP is just a fucking idiot fanboying
---
Bom bom bom bom!
---
I think you are displayed on map if you are in top3, have any kills, and are not sneaking. You dont see the enemy dots because they are sneaking - and that removes them from the map.
---
The Burrows is not a dungeon. It¬¥s a hole with a bunch of ghouls and a Dominator.
---
You know exactly what I meant, no need to get your knickers in a twist over semantics... it is an online game intended to be played co-operatively... happy?
---
We sent in our squishiest level 40 PA rifleman solo. She had no legendaries, no melee peeks ams was naked.
---
She agreed, whitesprings is more challenging.
---
I've seen them just stroll through a tesla and merc people often. Believe me, the only people who are going to go willingly pick a fight with a team of four as a melee build is pretty much all but sure he's got the better build. I don't ever consider player as enemies though, they're players. Entirely different thing. Melee is OP for everything else and that's really what counts since thats 90% of the game. PvP is small part of it. I only play on survival to get the weekly.
---
Not seeing the same results. Read the posts, nuked the area and got SFA. Only about 50% of ghouls spawned as glowing and 0 were legendary. Also had all of the people scramble in there so I may have missed them. Top level was all scorched. 0 legendaries and 0 pegendary creature spawns. Am I doing it wrong?
---
* flashbacks of Polygon's Doom playthrough gain fresh scars in my mind *
---
I'm sort of looking forward to it.
---
I know. :(
---
Nah it was disappointing to say the least. I tried to appreciate the interior as it had a lot of atmospheric storytelling but there were little to no notes or holotapes and not to mention the final boss is another assaultron a week after we got the imposter sheepsquatch. Weak content deserves to get called out.
---
Why would the sheepsquatch have quills? I think this is a porcupine cryptid.
---
I find it funny how someone downvoted you for it - someone is butthurt for spreading truth or perhaps they were too poor for the CE? Still awaiting my replacement.
---
Not alone
---
No not at all....my food and water consumption has gone way up since the patch
---
I ran both last weekend and got more Legendaries from whitespring. But definitely had more fun and got better 'value' loot like scrappables (plastic from lasers) and Caps from Harpers.  Each has benefits it seems.
---
You play on a pro ?
---
That's a fair point. I did take that into consideration when writing this, however it is currently a valid strategy and makes it easier for everyone involved so I don't see a problem with nuking it in this particular spot.
---
Aye tried that indie game since it was in early dev. Made it to day 60s hiding in a house killing bears from inside the porch &amp; traps for the rabbits. Dying means you are out of the game for good :]
---
I managed to fix the issue luckily! Edited the post. Maybe something here could fix the issues you've had?
---
God damnit, my camp's a stone throw away from Harper's Ferry. Guess I'll be having my camp leveled/seeing a lot more action if this really becomes the new meta.
---
I'am just disappointed that Beth still didnt fix the "Cant Mod Anything" bug .... i didnt really except anything challanging from this ... "dungeon" .. i'am also sure i could finish that thing with a level 30 character ...

My Scorchbeasts fight was at Monongah power plant. I was level 25-30 and we had taken the plant for the acid and fusion cores (I didn‚Äôt know hemlock holes existed) when the first ‚Äúdefend ur workshop‚Äù quest popped up it said ‚Äúevent: defend Monongah power plant. (Defeat Scorchbeast waves 0/1) me and my level 40ish friend then proceeded to fight the scorchbeast with the little ammo we had for the next 2 hours. And we had completely run out of ammo by the end of the fight except for fusion cells. (I got lucky enough to find a heavily modded laser rifle on a mutant half way through the event and I used it because after 20 mins the only ammo I had left was 2044 fusion cells.üò≠)
---
Second
---
Maybe you‚Äôre on console? Idk maybe you can explain it to my PC. It didn‚Äôt get the memo.
---
I ran a nuke last night at WS and probably had 30+ legendaries spawn, so it seemed pretty consistent compared to previous runs in my experience. Tbh I think it is just completely random when it comes to legendary spawns in most locations.
---
Exactly my sentiment, they dont fit the athmosphere as well imo.
---
Country roads maybe but i just cant stand this version with the inkspot fakout at the beginning
---
I‚Äôd love that but only if they made your camp invincible or something, griefers would just fast travel to every camp on the map and destroy them all
---
Discovering deathclaw island I was expecting something akin to Old Olney or the Deathclaw Sanctuary but no, a single level 21 deathclaw spawns and that's it
---
Country road is a good song, this version just isnt imo
---
And I sing along
---
On monday I was attacked by two level 80  scorchbeasts at once. first time i saw and killed one (well two)  higher than level 50.  was on the parking lot of whitespring golf
---
I found the cabin in the mire beside a cliff with a camp ground. There some holo tape there with two dead campers with those quills. It him for sure. The cabin is east of the down plane.
---
Maybe you should ask your parents.
---
Everyone overhyped it themselves, this Dungeon was hella fun personally
---
none of my parts were duped.  they were legitimately collected off of chassis and modified by me.  so yeah, this theory is.................................
---
i have got number 1 but can‚Äôt find it in my build menu
---
I do know that with the perk, I think it's called Animal Friendship or something, you can get pets that stay at your camp. Idk if you can get a dog and give it armor, but I've heard of people having like deathclaws and whatnot, so maybe that's why it's in there. I'd like to hope it's not just left in there from 4, although it probably is.
---
I wanted to finish reading your post but you lost me at deepness
---
Well said. I think a lot of the complainers are people that have level 200+ characters, and top level armor and weapons and such. Nothings a challenge for them. 
---
The area would be hard for two or more level 50 and up characters. It wasn't a cake walk  for my level 101. 
---
People make up things in their heads and then complain. I've seen so many posts where people are claiming that the area wasn't instanced like they thought it would be. Why? They never said it was going to be.
---
People are stupid.
---
They promised the burrows were going to be for two or more level fifty or more players, and be honest you have to be crazy to think its appropriate for the final boss to be a normal assaultron. The only way it could‚Äôve been ‚Äúhard‚Äù is if you weren‚Äôt wearing armor on the area they abused gutsys.
---
Me either..
---
Offering 10k for the BE Handmade
---
That doesn't make it any better. This is same good as you would boost WS legendary count in nuke and called that a dungeon.
---
What lvl is your Vampire combat shotgun? DM me if you want to trade or sell.
---
Can confirm. Our squishiest lvl 40 ran it naked and melee. (she's a PA rifle build)
---
A naked lvl 40 steam rolled it. Westtek or whitesprings is easily more challenge.
---
Ya sure 
---
We just Finished it and u know, it sucks 
---
I dunno maybe we weren‚Äôt lucky but it‚Äôs not a lot of enemies and legendary at all
---
No need to be a prick. I'm on PC, both a shittyish laptop and my VR rig.
---
I get the occasional crash, but the game is fully playable on both devices for me. The community at least seems to be on the same page on the games performance being so much better than at launch, to a point where it's completely playable, as much as any other Bethesda game. Other than New Vegas, but I'm sure you dont mind that that game runs terribly because it's 100% the best Fallout and not developed by Bethesda so it isnt cool to hate on.
---
I think a better course of action than complaining about your performance in a community that is mostly on the same page that performance has drastically improved would be sending in bug reports and your system specs to the company themselves. Just a thought.
---
Or at least, that the robots and decorations are there again.
---
I‚Äôm level 155 with 600+ hours and I have looted a TSE
---
Welcome to reality. One by one fanatical Bethesda fans see the truth. Every day it is harder to down vote truth when more people understand where this train wreck is going. Sad to say, but this story has no happy ending. The game needs a developing team with a genuine desire to make the game good. Fallout concepts is really good, but team behind it is just cashing as much as they can. They deliver only garbage.
---
interested in the cuckoo clock plan...
---
Trade for shotgun rounds?
---
There s a mod someone done for my friend wish turned it into a flame thrower
---
Ofcause they can. but 1 Item, is not GEAR. 
---
And to be fair, while that weapon is v.Good, it's still not optimised as it's not max level. 
---
Personally, random legendry multi-prefixed weapons are flat out ruining this game. Single star items or fixed quest rewards only. In the name of Balance
---
I did not! I will look for it, thank you! There were multiple manholes, so maybe i took the wrong one?
---
First run I went in with my main, expecting to get my arse kicked like when I paid a visit for the time to the Sheepsquatch. Over geared with a few Sentinel pieces, super solid perks, TSE Combat Shotgun and a ton of chems just in case.
---
Well... I found out Westek is WAY harder than this place. 
---
So to prove a point I took my weakest character, it's a lv70 Pistols build, (pretty much the lowest DPS build you can make) and since it is nice geared I dropped everything on my stash, pulled the lv25 excavator armor and a crap 1* 10mm Pistol. Half of the perks are useless since the build is not for PA... 
---
It was still WAY too easy. Heck, the Golf Club at the Whitesprings is more dangerous than this place :(
---
Oh well, the place does at least look awesome. Kudos to their design team.
---
I'd wager it is because you know what having little means, therefore you don't wish that on others. This is why I value people who have a "gift" of being able to put themselves into other people's shoes.
---
If you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you wouldn't be able to relate. Thank you for people like you, keeps me from going insane.
---
Woah man, be careful holding Bethesda accountable on this sub Reddit. I tried once and got a whole lotta hate for it.
---
Nuked ? Seriously ? Have seen a vid which was full of promises. I hope you were just unlucky
---
Because casuals have a whole world to explore.
---
we've explored it, and BGS is losing loyal fans because of this crap.
---
Maybe
---
lol pass
---
Pass
---
How often do you play fo76 for you not to reach anywhere near level 100?
---
I‚Äôm only 110 hours in and am at level 62
---
Also 90% of players aren‚Äôt like you... every server I join has majority over level 100 characters
---
Sure how many?
---
SS is okay
---
Anyone who plays the game already has better though...
---
They are under the floor decor in same section as the deathclaw statue, just scroll left or right.
---
It looks like the event has been nerfed.  I did one violent night by myself killed everything and the meat piles contained nothing.  I kept looking to see if I could figure out what happened...  Sorry folks...
---
Great point. maybe if they make camps invincible in adventure mode the two features would make the next update a great update.
---
It has been confirmed that isn't what happened. You know what? Go cry somewhere else.
---
It wasn't their intention to allow you to increase the level of mobs in an INTERIOR cell by nuking the EXTERIOR area?
---
Sure about that?
---
This is the problem, isn't? As long as it's our family, it's fine, but we are so quick to judge a stranger because we have no ties to them and know little about them. Man, I love psychology. Wish I went to study it.
---
My 65 was leveled entirely in Survival and has gear found there consisting of a lot of 1\* stuff. It took me 10 minutes to go through the burrows which is twice as long as everyone else whose bitching because I was in sneak the entire time. It was never once challenging.
---
That said you're getting an up vote because I agree with your last sentence. Give me level 500 scorch beasts and level 300 Deathclaws. Hell I'd be happy if they just doubled everything's level. 
---
EDIT: I do have a level 50 Fixer that a friend made me in Adventure mode. I modded it with my high level. Hardly OP but to be fair, not from Survival.
---
They were crouched, so you cannot VATS target.  
---
They were using Berry Mentats or equivalent Power Armor Mod to generate a glowing highlight on you hence they could see you.
---
They shouldn't have hyped it then.
---
I feel you don't even play F076. What are you even doing here?
---
@coyatrasshy is a fanatic Bethesda lover so his opinions are understandable. He denies the truth. If Bethesda would sell dog\*hit he would buy it instantly and say it tastes real good.
---
I usually pick up a hunting rifle when i'm out killing low level scorched for w/e reason, as soon as it breaks I ditch it again :p
---
And?
---
You need to mention the platform you are on.
---
Solo? :o
---
I like to run everywhere, when i hear this song i slow down to a walk and just take it all in. Beautiful post.
---
Yeah I stored my Jukebox after the Radios came out.  Too much hassle to toggle it on and off every time I approached camp.  Always seems to be stuck in an On position.
---
Worth a cheeky offer :)
---
I Don't think your doing it wrong but I think it's about the luck of the draw I guess.
---
I've had some runs at whitesprings and produced nothing then other times nearly every enemy has a legendary item
---
Think it's just rng chance, get people to log out of the world and re-enter the burrows, apparently the ghouls respawn
---
Interested with Bloodied DB shotgun/ 15% faster/33% vast hit.
---
Be excellent to each other
---
Go to toxic Larry's meat and go and that's the place where it starts where you got the holotape
---
Do the burrow mobs get affected or is it like inside the resort? Businesses as usual.
---
Hell yeah
---
It does have quills their pictures that have been released
---
Lol I‚Äôm not being a prick. The game does indeed work better than it did at launch, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as a $60 AAA title should work. The games been out for 6 months. At this point there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Apex Legends (a free game btw) had crashing issues at launch, within a month those issues have been totally solved. I‚Äôm not asking for a lot, I‚Äôm just asking for the product I purchased to work. It‚Äôs not totally unplayable, but I shouldn‚Äôt have this issue at all at this point.
---
On PC I've not seen a difference at WS - been through WS 3 times this week. Haven't hit Harper's in a while guess I'll see today.
---
yeah I used excavator armor and all rise my friend was in excavator armor with a 10mm smg vampire (1 star) and we cleared it pretty fast
---
that said I've enjoyed it and plan to go back
---
 Preach!
---
Yep. she wanted a challenge. 
---
We were all laughing too hard to help anyway.
---
She burned about a dozen radways and like 10 stimpaks, but thats not much different than WS.
---
Once again, people complain about ingame things that are allowed and encouraged. Boohoo.
---
Where was this located ? Want to see if I can find a mission near there for it
---
Wrong.
---
This is what I don't understand. We asked for a nuking location better/equal to whitespring and they gave it to us. What's the problem?
---
And yes, there's a bunch of level 62 ghouls in it - not something a level 50 can solo.
---
I‚Äôm fireproof 3 and coupled with stealth boy and tank killer 3 (and my AA rifles) I find myself being able to defend and counter pretty well in survival.  There are times where you are just overmatched and you need to stand and fight or withdraw.  I did just that this morning.  Facing a 200+ in PA with what appeared to be an explosive Gatling gun I took a lot of hits but was not going to win that battle so I bounced.  I couldn‚Äôt outgun or out stealth sheer overwhelming brute firepower.
---
Most* underutilized
---
Looks like the Brotherhood were full of "Bethesda please give us..." -people while trying to clean the burrows.
---
What you do is get rid of all 1* and any really heavy 2 and 3*. Also mod the armour to be as light as possible.
---
Agreed, while it was a bit underwhelming, the atmosphere in the Burrows was absolutely amazing, add that with the two new quests, it wasn‚Äôt all that bad. Definitely a step in the right direction!
---
Fixed [now.im](https://now.im) on PC
---
Yeah, I think they used the word dungeon, because of all the people saying, give us dungeons.
---
Looking for BE shotguns
---
Yeah, alot of people are 100+ atleast, thats the majority I see tbh, between 100 and 200.   
---
I'm 79 myself, and I went from 75 to 79 in 2 days of chilling and capturing low lvl workshops like poseidon for fusion cores, food factory for steak, ammunition factory for some plasma carts..... So not hardcore grinding to try and level up, just chilling around in content areas below my level, and I still gained 4 levels.... I also took a break for about 3 months from the game too.  
---
If someone as inherently lazy as me, whom doesnt play that often or intense as one could (grinding whitesprings et all) can make 79, it should be trivial to make 100+ with minimal actual effort.  
---
I just dont do it because aside from respeccing and some more perk cards, its not actually making me stronger, in that aspect a lvl 700 isnt any tougher than a lvl 70 with a build planned from lvl 1.
---
Yea I want to farm acid again from those bee hives!
---
&gt; not a hack
---
Well, since were playing devils advocate, do you think OP found that TSE, or bought it from somebody who may or may not have duped it? Because it‚Äôs probably the latter. And they probably duped it. Maybe not... but probably.
---
Either way, I don‚Äôt envy the people who are expected to roll out balanced content regularly in this completely imbalanced game.
---
first venture into trading....
---
Read elsewhere the plan is \~200 when you find the right vendor.
---
Shotgun rounds have to be at least 1 cap to buy at a vendor, but they never have quantity
---
 \- so how about 250 shotgun rounds - (gives you at least) a 25% margin + no scrounging ?
---
Seems to be missing an ear.
---
I wish i could do that for rifles. I hate having to carry around a 12 pound rifle that i can not reduce. they are so heavy
---
I got a medic‚Äôs flamer and a medic‚Äôs broadsider, plus assorted other stuff and nothing above one star. I wish the rng on weapons was influenced by perks so my melee character would pop more melee and my heavy gunner teammate would pop more guns. He didn‚Äôt even want the broadsider tho.
---
Only more garbage content. Sad to say, but this game isn't improving any time anymore. It needs a total fresh new start with a new developers and company.
---
Call me nostalgic, but I'm still a sucker for 'I don't wanna set the wooooorld on fire'
---
ESO did a cave/delve/dungeon revamp a couple years after launch for this exact reason. Everything was repetitive and some of the caves were identical to one another, which just indicated lazy level design.
---
At least the level design for the Burrows was nice, but this hyped up PR spin to draw attention to the game has been found wanting.
---
The product you purchased does work. It works just as well as any other Bethesda game nobody complains about. That's what I'm saying.
---
You must be getting unlucky with your system specs, because more most of us it really isnt an issue. I get one crash every few sessions at most, which is less than I get in any other Fallout game actually, other than the originals.
---
If you're going to complain about the performance on this, complain about the performance in 3, New Vegas, 4, Skyrim, and every other game Bethesda has published that crashes every few sessions in most cases.
---
To act like the game is desperately in need of fixing is just desperately trying to find a reason to hate on Bethesda at this point.
---
To repeat what the devs said time and time again: the more items the server needs to track, the more performance issues will appear. They've already doubled stash space since launch and ever since we got to 800, I have no storage issues whatsoever.
---
You simply need to learn to manage your stash. You won't need loads of materials on a short notice - sell bulked junk if a stack exceeds two digits. You won't need a whole lot of asbestos, bones or fiber optics, for example. Sell or gift all your excess. If you got unique weapons or armor from a quest that your character's build doesnt use, get rid of it. Lots of chems you don't really use? Away with it. Who needs 50 disease cures if you only catch a serious disease every blue moon anyway?
---
Accept our savior Marie Kondo into your heart and you won't be troubled by too little stash space any longer!
---
Looks like I triggered some folks because they KNOW what I said was completely accurate. Get off ur high horse, people.
---
How would nuking the open world affect an interior cell? That's going to be like the inside of Whitesprings when the golf course geta nuked.
---
Do you realize how dumb you make yourself sound saying stuff like this?
---
Oh yeah, the Burrows are extremely low effort on Bethesda's behalf. The location has about the same amount of ghouls than the Whitesprings club house (and in my case they pretty much all attacked in one wave, which was strange but I'll take it). I like that it's a viable new nuke zone at least... I guess?
---
Definitely not even an iota as hard as they claimed they would be. This, along with the camera delay - which I heavily suspect will also not be some revolutionary concept - leaves me wondering how much _actual content_ will be coming in future releases.
---
I guess I do feel a certain way about the Burrows lol.
---
Actually they are glowing inside mate
---
Since the burrows is underground I imagine it would be the same as inside the whitespring during a nuke. Basically you just nuked Harper's ferry.
---
We sent a level 40 PA rifle build into the burrows naked with a melee weapon. 
---
She steamrolled it.
---
Yeah. Until we get a Schreler style "What went wrong" article about this game, I'm not taking anything Bethesda says about Fallout 76 seriously. They promised a hell of a lot before launch that it turns out the **lied** about.
---
Up wtf boys 
---
I already done that and they are glowing underground 
---
So just msg me when someone WHO KNOWS how that works will launch nuke
---
so NSFK \*not safe for kindergarten\*!
---
Yep watched 4 players with gats just blasting the boss while she was cloaked  doing no damage at all and it literally explains the entire fight but oh well
---
It would be the best combination for that weapon, simple. If you want to know more do some actual research rather than bitching at people.
---
Most of the quests in this game, save the main quest line in this game are short. I don't know what made people think this was going to be 5+ hours of content. 
---
You are right, that people ran from one end to the other just to finish the quest, in hopes that they got something uber.
---
This is what mules are for. Holding your extra stuff
---
Wow that kind of sucks
---
&gt; but if you want raid tier difficulty content then wait for the damn vaults to open.
---
I can pretty much guarantee that the vaults will be hated to relative to how much Bethesda and the community has hyped them... If you want to know what they will probably be like, look at the vaults in FO4, FO3 and FONV. Don't expect much, free content is just that, free content... this is why I like paying for content sometimes, so I actually have a reason to complain :/
---
Yeah it's possible to sell to both vendors and players.
---
Bring me a dream
---
Problem with uranium fever is the enemies are always lvl 40
---
No. Not after the atrocious version in the Whisper of the Heart! Now if you bring back Skeeter Davis - The End of the World then I'll be overjoyed :)
---
For when we get raids, empath and bloodied sneak build, im a rogue so avoiding attention while tanking dmg for others. Enemies are tougher for sure im always on edge trying to not get touched lol
---
For me I thought it was ok I guest it wasn‚Äôt amazing but it was fine
---
Scribe 1 - "Bethesda! Please give us new flavors of Nuka Cola! I like pineapple and it literally saved my life when... gahhhhh!"
---
Scribe 2 - "No I want a shiny Nuka Cola machine that keeps it cold so I can serve it when company comes ov.....  ahhhhhhh"
---
Scribe 3 - "git gud bitches! oh f\*ck..."
---
Thank you.
---
You sound like my 1SG in Iraq on my first tour. "If you die during an engagement with the enemy, it's most likely your fault." 
---
Gtfo
---
Nobody said it was desperately in need of fixing. But it does need to work. And out of all the games you listed the only one I ever had issue with was New Vegas which I might add was solved within months of release. So.... I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, but you certainly are not right.
---
Right. They are going to change their release schedule because you asked them too.
---
No. There are no options in the settings menu to disable it.
---
I nuked Whitesprings last night and noticed the ghouls weren‚Äôt respawning like usual. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because fewer and fewer people show up for it or not. Two 3* ghouls dropped 1* armor for me. Barely got any ionized meat and I was kinda counting on that. Then the sheepsquatch event popped and everyone left the zone. It was underwhelming over all. Weird
---
might depend on when you run WS relative to the last nuke adn the number of players around.  
---
I got about 10 in each of my last 2 runs during a nuke, respawns happening almost as soon as an area was cleared (newly arriving players?). 
---
Only picked up 5 or so in the last non-nuke run.  Saw lots of meat piles, and critters were not respawning anywhere near as fast, but there weren't as many players, either.
---
But everything you are complaining about wasn't promised. Ironic.
---
I‚Äôll be on in a minute, what level is the .50?
---
Nah those quills are from the Easter bunny.
---
Continuing to measure all content released on the basis of what it could lead to is a fallacious line of thinking. The Burrows is not what was described or advertised. Any future efforts to improve it and make it more like an actual high level dungeon will simply be efforts to correct the previous misrepresentation.
---
Nope, my only 3\*\*\* across two characters, Lvl 85 and the Alt (who has and earned the weapon) Lvl 42.
---
There are players out there that just explore the world and who didn't but dupe'd TSE's
---
But no doubt I don't qualify as 
---
\&gt;  Anyone who actually plays the game
---
The nuke position helps with violet Flux, if it's positioned a little northwest of the map icon you get more, I have gotten around 30 or so from there at once. That includes the strangler pods too.
---
The 2 +50 level  characters part is pretty misleading. 
---
I did it with my level 35 commando stealth character (without great gear at all) without ever coming out of stealth once
---
You know what does fit in a porta potty?
---
30 frag mines.
---
The Burrows and the two quests should have released last week with the Sheepsquatch content.  It would have been better received.
---
I love the part where they have all these camera related challenges and the camera isn‚Äôt even available yet. So impressive and well-coordinated.
---
ty for info. i thought something like that after no one is offering those recipes or found it
---
I usually end up being the conduit for all 3 pylons, tanking the Sheepsquatch by myself
---
Too bad the mini gun is so under powered.
---
Ts is best on an up close and personal weapon like a shotgun.
---
We dropped a nuke Sunday on Whitesprings and the Tennis court never spawned once. It was heart breaking.
---
60 Minute Man
---
That count is WAY off though
---
It was exactly as advertised. The community hyped it.
---
I dont have a 2nd person to hold my stuff as I transfer characters :(
---
Any combat armor with mutants and +1 strength?
---
But it pops up 4 seconds after the menu loads *right* as you go to click something, and can roll you back a step in the menu. It's annoying
---
Don't pre-order games, check multiple review sources, and never forget that companies don't actually care about you.
---
Got it right when encryptid ended thanks to eyebombs, didn't get to loot the boss. 10/10
---
wasnt expecting them to. tbh, I would not be surprised if it delayed by a week or so
---
Why is this?
---
I thought it had improved. I did a run last night and got about 11 legendary which were mostly 2* and a couple of 3*.
---
Exactly, I‚Äôm the exact same man. Everytime I go to sit down and play I level up at once, usually twice and that‚Äôs with no grinding. I‚Äôm still exploring and finding daily events. I genuinely enjoy some of the events as well so I keep replaying them. Building my camp and perfecting it to my liking. 
---
I fail to see how anyone could not reach level 100, especially with the fact that leveling up does not slow down, it‚Äôs the same exp required for every level.
---
You wrote that like MODUS speaks
---
no, but i might have it on a wood or leather leg. lol
---
People still dreaming that this train wreck is improving in the future? Don't waste your time or money for that dream. The developers behind this game has proved already continuesly that they are unable to deliver anything interesting or functional. Fallout need fresh start with new developing team and company.
---
Could give better utilization for wood armor considering every 3 star legendary keeps dropping them.
---
I wish we could have the jukebox play the radio tracks. I find I put one in for the looks, then turn it off so I can hear the radio.
---
Pretty sure player vending will do this, I'm guessing it was delayed to add in camps being invincible while in Pacifist.
---
Serious question here... but what are you all doing to keep playing this game? 
---
Mim lvl 220, have 2 characters &amp; feel like "summer" realise for end game content is too much of a wait I'll be retired by then.
---
Only reason I'm still playing is perfecting armour/gun load out with trading.
---
Wgats everyone else's incentive? &amp; how you filling it playing F76?
---
Did I... member?
---
I cant wait to see what Halloween themed stuff we will get during Halloween
---
Not for that but if you have wood with chameleon I'll take
---
that is totally "RAD" my dude.
---
where did you get that?
---
By doing this challenge i get few 3* weapons from legendaries i met. It took me around 5hours.
---
How can you be 85lvl without any decent weapon?
---
The fedora is 400 caps? Ive gotten it 5 times and gave 4 away..
---
How? I can handle 2 but the 3rd is to much health loss.
---
Been thinking I need to drop healing factor, and use supers so i can solo it.
---
I bagged my first one at lvl 34 by Fred's BBQ during a quest. Figured it was time to man up and go for it lol. Took it down with a combay shit gun and ski sword. At first I was hyped about it and started hunting them, now they are just annoying, and they have quit dropping any good loot. I don't waste my ammo on them, if they are on the ground near me I'll kill them.
---
It wears off after a while.
---
Brought to you by the same people who want 10k caps for a lvl35 bloodied weapon.
---
Meat hook and mole miner gauntlet both double dip still as of last night.
---
I think it would be more interesting 2 different perks, improvised armor and professional protection, but you get it only from wearing a full set. And maybe the perks are a bit more interesting and fix disadvantages of the armors? Like improvised becomes better defence/resistance and durability. Professional protection decreases weight slightly and increases ap refresh
---
I went through about 40 Stimpacks. And it's never usually longer than about 30 seconds at a time before the SS destroys me.
---
Dont know what you're smoking but a lvl 12 could have done that area with a clown suit swinging a dead mole rat...Not hard at all!
---
i want to 4 man with this loadout now
---
Fair enough rebuttal
---
Yeah i'm not speaking philosophically here, I just mean there's a LOT of lore, there's a lot of atmosphere, there are many small twists everywhere that you can find and try to do, so the game has more than just "explore 3 location and farm" "deepness". 
---
Obviously you won't find your soul here.
---
Environment: 8/10
---
Amount of Legendaries: 8/10
---
Difficulty: 2/10 (because fuck those gutsys)
---
or a recon scope.

I'm not level 50 so I didn't do it (I don't even know where Harper's Ferry is) but there's something that bugs me.. People are complaining about lack of content etc etc after puttin in the game hours of play, when there are many games that doesn't even give you half of the playing time for that cost. I know, I know, RDR2, TW3, and so on, but this is an evolving game, in 1 month and change we had 2 new events, a (albeit small) new area/dungeon, new quests. And all of this while the primary focus of Beth still was fighting bugs and balancing things.
---
Let's see how things will evolve now that the ship has sailed (quite) safely, before hasting to the lifeboats.
---
Interesting, then I have to say I agree with your OP!
---
I went to Anthem for abit lol, talk about a bad decision combo these past few months XD.
---
But here‚Äôs the thing:
---
It‚Äôs basically an underground whitespring.
---
I can take care of the whole white springs area as long as I‚Äôm careful.
---
If there‚Äôs not even a challenge for a level 42, then it‚Äôs not really difficult, unless you are just bad at the game, or don‚Äôt have an amazing build.
---
I assume he was talking about rad poisoning the moment you load into an irradiated zone.
---
I'm in the same boat. I give away legendaries as soon as I get them, but will have a look. I just don't want to throw away 4,000 rounds of ammo if someone can use it. 
---
If you have any violet flux, even a few pieces would be great. I changed my gatling gun to a prime. 
---
Please DM your PS name.
---
Ok so I‚Äôve now checked online to save you the effort and it does indeed exist.  So I‚Äôd say 2 shot furious is still a great combination for the 10mm smg.
---
"Try hard" is a phrase used by people who enjoy casual play. I don't min-max, and broke my build yesterday because I wanted to have fun with a gunslinger build. My pistol build finished the dungeon in 20min solo, despite not using bloodied, sentinel, or any other "meta" build. I consider myself a casual player, but the majority of the Burrows was about as difficult as a Westtek run.
---
Vastly different engines with regards to loot pools and mob pathing. Probably not an easy 1:1.
---
LOL. No thanks.
---
same over the last week,but,....went back to normal last night ???????
---
I usually zip over to the event and if after 15 seconds I'm seeing noone activating pylons I just skedaddle out.
---
I feel your pain. I even have a mule and they filled to capacity with Legendaries. I‚Äôll be on around 6 pm if you are on PC I can help with mule transfers. I don‚Äôt often server hop these days so you‚Äôd have a stable friend. Just hit me up. IGN: inkpirate
---
Your original comment was saying that it crashes and has a game breaking glitch everytime you sit down to play it. It was phrased as if the game is close to unplayable for you.
---
For me, New Vegas still crashes more than 76 does.
---
Neither of us are right here because on one persons device a game may run flawlessly and on another it can run like trash with crashes, low framerate, or the inability to even open.
---
I have a friend who hasnt had a crash since the first patch was released and has only been booted from servers. I have one crash every couple of sessions. 
---
It all changes system to system.
---
they are the same category as the power armor statue/deathclaw statue.
---
They stated it would be a "A challenge for 2+ level50+ players. A high level well geared player MAY be able to do it solo."
---
We sent a level 40 rifle build PA user into the burrows naked with a knife and a sledge. She was just fine.

HEAD UNDERGROUND WITH THE BURROWS
---
 A new Wild Appalachia dungeon experience, The Burrows, will become available for the heartiest of explorers starting April 16. Muster your squad and follow in the footsteps of the Brotherhood of Steel who sent their own forces into the darkness and muck below Harper‚Äôs Ferry for mysterious reasons. We‚Äôll share more details about The Burrows in next week‚Äôs Inside the Vault, but we thought you might like this heads-up so you can get your characters prepped for this daunting new subterranean battleground. 
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

April 11th -  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview) 
---
VENTURE UNDERGROUND WITH THE BURROWS
---
 The Burrows is a new dungeon experience being added to Appalachia on April 16, in which you will explore the tunnel system beneath Harpers Ferry and face challenging foes as you complete the new Waste Management quest. 
---
 To begin Waste Management, you‚Äôll need to access The Burrows using one of two manhole covers in Harpers Ferry. One is near the Armory and the other near Highway 65. Find a dead Brotherhood of Steel scribe within, whose corpse holds information that will send you deeper into the sewers. The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone. If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles. The quest can only be completed once, but after it‚Äôs finished you can repeat the dungeon as many times as you‚Äôd like for even more loot and XP. 
---
Do you see the difference between those two press releases, only a week apart? They are at *very best* contradictory. So Bethesda hinted at something challenging in the face of an entire community clamoring for more difficult and engaging end game content and then slightly walked it back in the subsequent release without coming right out and saying it indeed would not in fact be a dungeon at all. The community took what Bethesda gave us and ran with it. I would not say this is all our doing. 
---
Were you satisfied with the romp through the sewers? It was less challenging than clearing West Tek and even Sugar Grove has the potential for being a more challenging encounter when you get to it's boss. I guess those are high level dungeons too.
---
Kinda like when bethesda said "we've takin the game as far as we can go, now we need you to literally break the game to see where the fixes need to be done" then everyone freaked out over the 'broken' beta
---
Has it been confirmed that you could use one legendary to alter another. That‚Äôs not the impression I got. I thought they were saying you could turn your legendary in and re-roll it.
---
I hope they do. I really like the fact that the sheepsquatch is a tough fight. Id like a dungeon that makes you feel glad to have strangers along to help out. Something like the fun of Fasnacht and everyone coming together and the toughness of the imposter and a high chance of multiple deaths. Of course, results may vary depending on the individuals on your server.
---
I can confirm that hardened receivers on the Fixer and my 3\* combat rifle showed roughly a 20% increase in base damage.
---
And you'd be wrong
---
What was the home page like? Were there different enemies?
---
I followed this guide :) https://youtu.be/RjmtPaGhLz8
---
&gt; How can you be 85lvl without any decent weapon?
---
I have All Rise, I had a Vampire/ Swing Speed board, but it was lvl 25, so got rid of it but it did me well till 50+ (Got All Rise)
---
I explorer the world, only recently started going to Nuke Zones for Flux (I've had 2 3* Legendary critters fall through the floor in the last week) - People don't let you tag things before they kill them
---
But your comment says everything really - By stating it you are implying that I do not play the game "Correctly"
---
So BGS intentionally saying nothing on the panel to deny the fact the burrows wasn't going to be a late game raid isn't misleading. Even when they overplay the difficulty and rewards from it. Even when they intentionally made the burrows and the arktos pharma content indistinguishable in the promotional trailer when they aren't connected at all. They had plenty of time to explain to players it was just going to be a simple dungeon and not a raid. They *choose* not to do so.
---
Don't I know it.
---
Nerd rage, serendipity,  and the survivor perk are super important for me.  The Troubleshooters shiskebab it dropped a few days ago helps lol.  Its just frustrating when you see a bunch of people wasting their ammo.  Hopefully more start getting how to get this done.  Last time I was part of a completion it was done with 2 or 3 minutes to spare because everyone was on pint with the pylons,  especially the lower levels who wont do as much damage to the beastie.
---
The end game boss blew itself up before i could do anything. How was i supposed to enjoy that.
---
A level 35 vats-sniper can easily one-shot those lvl62 ghouls. I think the loyal players expected a serious challenge, on par with the Sheepsquatch quest, only spread out through a whole subterranian gauntlet.
---
My main just hit lvl 92 and I have like 40 3 star weapons and armor. I dont grind or anything even remotely similar (unless you count taking as many workshops as I can over a lot of my plays)
---
And I've for sure never bought anything.  
---
How on earth do you not have any? 
---
I just got a medic/explosive/+ vats shotgun in the Burrows last night. Play some missions dude.
---
Yea I already done that, its getting me excited  that I'm gonna get every mounted head one by one as I slowly add the to my wall.
---
Spit coffee.   Thank you.
---
Hey, you can say the ‚Äúz‚Äù word! That‚Äôs racist!
---
Lvl. 12
---
Scorchbeast = RUN!!
---
I'm sure it was quite the adventure from the sounds of it!  I'm solo wanderer and don't have many tales of group conquest, but with such a variation of levels there, I'll bet it was interesting to say the least.
---
I don't own the game yet but can you clarify whether the "being fucked to death by a sheep Assaultron" is a literally death fuck or a figurative death fuck?
---
I got a kaleidoscope of colors when I went to the map yesterday.  Made me nervous as I was in the middle of a daily so I finished as quickly as I could and logged off
---
I want to stab screwdrivers in my ears when that lady clucks though. Sets off my tinnitus every time i try to enjoy the radio.
---
Seems way to easy but I guess that's what this community wants
---
Hi Bob!
---
I know. So far the only thing I have to say I dislike about fallout 76 though other than no endgame/lacking endgame, is the lack of races such as ghoul, Super mutant, and stuff like that. Getting changes for mutations would be cool too especially if you became more ghoulish the more rads you took on and stuff. But they need to focus more on bugs and adding new gameplay to the game before coding anything as complex as that
---
I came across a random encounter that was a dead body next to a still burning tent. How long do tents burn for? Seems like the guy died just a couple hours prior
---
It is a good song in a terrible game. Nothing more.
---
I enjoyed it. What I was expecting? Eh, not really. Fun, though. Just another place to kill critters and get scrap. Keeps me playing.
---
No idea. And the game isn‚Äôt ‚Äúunplayable‚Äù it‚Äôs just unenjoyable because of these issues. After 1 or 2 restarts I‚Äôm totally done. None of my other games have any issue at all. None. But 76 has issues every time I sit down to mess with it. It‚Äôs to the point where my wife has to beg me to check out new updates with her. And without fail somewhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours I will be totally tilted and completely done with it until the next update. Absolutely unenjoyable. And if it‚Äôs not a crash it‚Äôs something absolutely ridiculous. Something won‚Äôt spawn or an item will be untouchable breaking a quest line. Or something super stupid like we‚Äôll fight a legendary, manage to kill it, and then something explodes sending the corpse to god knows where so we can‚Äôt loot it. Just absolute trash. I want to like this game so bad but how can you like anything that makes your blood boil every time you try to enjoy it?
---
Fallout needs a hard mode for 50+ players.
---
No the majority of players are NOT between 50-150. I
---
Stopped playing the game after a week because the bugs are were too much. I recently picked it back up and (I know this is super hard to believe but it isn‚Äôt the only game I play and I do work 8 hours a day) I‚Äôm only level 46. Me and many like me, are still really enjoying the game as it is. Like I said in an earlier post, don‚Äôt blame Bethesda for the players that felt like they would play the game non stop 24 hours a day and exploit the shit out of it to get to a higher level. That‚Äôs on you guys. No one should be level 200 already unless they played this game fucking non stop for a ridiculous number of hours a day. The majority of the player base has an actual fucking life.
---
2 level 50 players can struggle through Burrows. Especially casuals. Again, community hype is more to blame than anything. And I'm glad this is a permanent new area.
---
(X) Doubt. Unless loaded with stims.
---
I've got it as well. They drop in sequence, have to learn the previous to drop the next.
---
I would recommend reactive plates.  I had some toolbox try to gank me at WS while farming ghouls and he ended up one shotting himself as a result.  Best part was he was mic‚Äôd up.  It was pure entertainment heading his reaction to a reverse gank move.
---
But the player that doesnt wanna play the mind numbing game of wack everything with a Yellow rocket hammer has a bit more difficult time fighting a lvl 150+ due to having to farm hours for any top lvl damaging rifle/pistol/hw and armor to fit the bill. Because turns out we dont get our endgame weapon from a quest drop. if you dont build towards the only weapon type that gains damage from a special your not quite as powerful early on.
---
Just find a desk or a trash can and drop them there, switch characters and pick them up. Just need someone reliable to stay in the world and join them.
---
This has happened to me several times since the last patch. Scared the shit outta me ha.
---
A dungeon that takes 10-15 level 100 or more players? 
---
That would be mean that only a small percentage of players would be using that content. 
---
Also, what it sounds like you really want is just endless spawning monsters and raid level loot. 
---
If this is what you need to enjoy playing the game, it sounds like you've played this game out. Time to move on. It also sounds like this isn't the fallout for you. Because the game is more than just killing mobs and loot.
---
Sole Survivor is alright. But only because it has a silencer and I havnt gotten around to unlocking that plan for my other better lever rifles (2 shot and instigating) so it does have a place in my gear as a stealth option.
---
I got to the end only for the boss to blow itself up. Is that intentional? The super mutants on top are more of a challenge than inside. Makes no sense.
---
I have a two shot auto grenade launcher and a two shot mini gun. Are those worth keeping?
---
Like a."Doberman" priest? üòÅ
---
For playing the game in a manner you are offended by?
---
This is why is turned on pacifist mode.  Doesn't help my camp, but at least I don't take damage from griefers trying to bait me into PVP.
---
It‚Äôs the that  kind of what the junk shield perk is?
---
I like it.  Maybe have it be a cthullu monster like in the Lucky Hole Mine.  Hell, the lore is already set up!  We have to destroy it lest it make it's way to the surface!  I'm still withholding dungeon judgment until we see the actually heavily advertised one underneath the chemical plant in the forest.  That's the one from the promotional video with the multiple levels.   This one was just kinda thrown at us a few weeks ago so I'm assuming it's a test of some sort.
---
wait, is it really nukable?
---
About a dozen radway, and ~10 stims. 
---
Even a level 40 can power attack em in one swing with a half decent weapon. 
---
Ill ask if she was recording. I recorded my run, but I'm 5/5 sent with well optimized weapons. I expected a cake walk, but not an easier one than westtek or whitesprings
---
"And Timmy fucking died"
---
So you made this post to basically get attention. 
---
Wait, then why I am I saying anything about it? That's literally the point of 95% of the posts on this reddit. I want attention! I guess even this one.
---
This is great! Keep it up op
---
Negatives: Not challenging for a level 108 to solo, not long enough.
---
Positives: Great layout, tonnes of enemies, got 14 legendary items on my only run including a 2 star instigating gause rifle.
---
They nerfed cap loss in survival; you make more caps in Adventure now.
---
I just think this would be fun and if you don‚Äôt like it you don‚Äôt have to do it.
---
This makes me feel a little better about the Burrows at least, I‚Äôm still going to take a resting period on the game so I don‚Äôt burn myself out while waiting for more content.
---
Gonna make a trip back to memory lane and play some older fallout games until then :)
---
Draw me a bath.
---
I'm also on PC, literally haven't disconnected or crashed once since they fixed the unlimited weight exploit. What are your PC specs?
---
Ever wonder if mannequins are sentient synths who are being punished by being downgraded to human-shaped cameras?
---
I know they're watching me...
---
I almost got sucked in to buying that lmao, thank god i didn‚Äôt!
---
Same thing happened to me. Except it was a executioners gamma gun that I just used. I swapped weapons and played for 30 mins. When I went to use it on the favorites wheel it was gone.   I never dropped anything either and I was pvping for those 30 min. This was before survival.
---
Sometimes he‚Äôs a bit angry towards sinners and non believers....
---
It's an online RPG, made by a company that makes story driven RPG games. Not everything fits into your molds. Diversity your catalog. Go play something else, this game is worth like 500 hours tops. People keep treating it like they need to play it every day and it's pretty much their second life. It's a game, they have a start and an ending.
---
that was my impression. 
---
[Here, a Bethesda rep said that you can scrap your legendaries, so I assumed that you could get some kind of token for each legendary you scrap and you can use said token to reroll or add a new legendary effect.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b48gcg/does_anyone_have_any_insight_on_the_upcoming/ej59hq5/)
---
ofc you could add a new legendary effect, the price should be extremely high so that you cant just make a quad, Furious, explosive, Anti-armor double barrel shotgun. (assuming you can make 5* legendaries)
---
Uh, everyone?

---
Meanwhile i'm lvl 86 and my house i like a little box of wood with a lamp
---
You should have at least taken the loose screws that are right next to them!
---
Im glad you are glad to have underwhelming and underachieving content. You however are an outlier and this wasn't what was advertised.
---
You are welcome to consider what I wrote as you wish and ignore what I said, it won't change much, this is a highly tactical game where visibility is the key and if you skip controlling it you die. Happens to all players no matter how good they are. The difference is that some people analyse how they exposed themselves and how to prevent that in the future, and other do not. I do attribute majority of my deaths to own mistakes used by my opponents. I minimise my deaths by learning from those mistakes. I doubt that you'll infinitely superior player to me that doesn't make mistakes, but even the best player I met (116 kills in life weekly record) made mistakes and died. Less mistakes than me, thats for sure.
---
How about using the grounded mutation or the energy resistance perk (Reflective or whatever it's called)
---
Make some friends.  Join a group.  Go down the rabbit hole. https://youtu.be/hSx9jFkda8o
---
same here :(
---
um what? I just want the legendary vendor because so i can dump off my unwanted legendaries. I dont care about attention
---
You're comparing Apple's to oranges my friend. I was talking about the lack of end game content for PVE and your talking about farming gear specifically for PVP. That's a whole other shit show.
---
Nope. I love all the songs and badly yet quietly sing and hum along all the time.
---
ISnt it cool? I remember hiding from that Bitch in the buss for what seemed like hours hoping she would leave. Then I had finally had enough and just stood my ground and fought her and won! Congrats! Now I can take on multiple at once and not think twice but I remember those days...
---
Mod all armor to ultralight, and save only low weight weapons.
---
It's ridiculous that every melee weapon weighs 1-4 lbs, and every rifle weighs 15+.
---
Explosive effects are still pretty damn effective.  I‚Äôm a shotgun and rifle build and I maxed out all of those perks and my furious double barrel does almost 300dmg.  I max out adrenaline perk and adrenal reaction mutation and the dmg goes much higher once you start engaging and knocking down enemies.  It‚Äôs plenty powerful. 
---
As for melee, it‚Äôs just not my thing and remember they need to get close enough for it to work.  We‚Äôve all been ganked by the dude running around in a clown outfit and his OP sentinel armor and deathclaw but honestly now that I‚Äôm lvl 164 most of those people leave me alone.  Or I can kill or stagger them from a distance.
---
Pretty much this.
---
There was never an update
---
Bethesda is already working on it. The Fallout 76 roadmap states that they are finding ways to remove CAMP destruction by other players, not to mention, the removal of slap damage/killing people that don;t want to fight.
---
And any player with the Good Doggy perk should turn into a mongrel!
---
I‚Äôve said it before..... you get wannabe tough guys trying to rock in survival only for them to realise they‚Äôre nothing.   So....they go back to adventure cos they reckon they‚Äôre big fish in a small pond.  Funny thing is, they ain‚Äôt, they might be lvl 200+ but around that level these dicks become complacent.
---
If Bethesda are planning to do the fix with camp, they need to get their finger out cos this issue may alienate new players coming in.
---
45 or 50 not sure
---
I see both sides here and have come to a conclusion, if you‚Äôll give it some thought; tse gear IS meant to be extremely rare. Duping kind of screwed the meta. Everybody and their sister has one now. It DOES break the game a little bit. The solution to the duped items was a hard one, I‚Äôm sure. It would‚Äôve been silly to take everybodys guns, especially if some of the people had actually earned it. 
---
I do think there should be more challenging content (bethesda says that‚Äôs coming with vaults. I love Bethesda games, myself, but I‚Äôm not going to hold my breath and potentially be disappointed).
---
The problem with more challenging content based on powerful guns is the bulletsponge effect; SBQ for instance, not hard with a good group but good LORD does that thing suck up bullets. 
---
Imo, they need more mechanics to increase difficulty. Sheepsquatch assaultron is a good example with the pylons. 
---
In short, I don‚Äôt really think difficulty should be based on how much damage you can output, but rather how smart you play. Every good mmo with raids and dungeons has mechanics for those instances. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lack of ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù so much as it is just that the ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù aren‚Äôt really interesting.
---
Every time this somehow pops up in my feed it's a reminder that yeah, this game still sucks shit
---
I don't think I made it past day 15. I'd go to bed too cold or keep misjudging the time doing stuff outside. Either way I'd freeze to death. I've still not tried the story mode though. I'll have to go back for that.
---
I've usually always got the radio playing on my pip boy. I never get fed up of hearing country roads coming on. 
---
Or.... 
---
Soooooo bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no
---
it is stupid that the base handmade rifle weighs 11.2 pounds and there is no way to reduce its weight, yet I can make my .50 cal weigh less than 3 pounds. 
---
I have gotten to the point that it is better weight management to carry all of my heavy weapons than it is to put them in my stash
---
I definitely understand that frustration, and it really sucks that you're running into those issues. The closest to any of that I've had was when a note didnt spawn in on the Lying Lowe quest line and I had to server hop to get the quest back working.
---
That really sucks overall, because as someone who isnt encountering many issues playing at all I am really enjoying myself. I've put in 100 hours since launch and I still have stuff to do and work towards.
---
I hope that at some point the game is playable for you two and you can enjoy the game without encountering those bugs and frustrations, because at the very least it's a really detailed and fun world to explore.
---
Add hordes of glowing ants in narrow tunnels
---
If you dont get called cheater on a regular basis you need to fix your build
---
I use a TSE pump shotgun. Thinking about trading it for some type of TSE rifle. Based on my experience, shotguns in general could use a damage buff.
---
Have you have picked ur nose, looked at the little slime monster an thought "wow that came outta me!"
---
&gt;The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.
---
This is really damn specific to be "just marketing talk".  Like I get it, I see your posts it is obviously you are having some fun trolling people about this but the things they said are way to specific and different than what they delivered.
---
The Fallout 76 roadmap says that they will do this when player vending comes out.
---
I'm 15 and I roleplay as a merchant. I don't play much and I'm probably too young (15) to play with you. But if you're interested, add me. My psn is akt6845.
---
I think the word you want is depth.
---
Dont forget to huff some wonderglue
---
You are level 85 and cant afford to fast travel? You really ARE playing the game wrong.
---
I haven't tried any of those, but could possibly be a good addition there, yes.
---
Thats exactly it! No reward for the risk. But at the same time i love when some asshat finds and shoots my camp. Then when i kill them 4 times and they try to hop servers i follow them. Then when they think the coast is clear, the orbital strikes rain down on their camp and turn it to dust. I dont get mad, materials are east to get. I 100% get even. Ironically griefers cry really hard when their lil tactics dont work lol
---
&gt; For those that completed it in "5 minutes", they just ran to the end, they didn't explore every tunnel and cranny that there was. 
---
Took me 10 minutes to get a overview of the whole tunnel system, no ghouls inside because 10 other people cleared everything. Found every note and holotape by just following the quest. Found the Bobble Head and Powerarmor Spawn. The first part is the real maze of the burrows, the rest after you go into the area where you needed that key is just a classic linear A-&gt;B Dungeon to the End, which i could just run through without a key because other people btw. 
---
So yeah my experience went from overexicted to tremendously underwhelmed in about "5 minutes", shouldn't happen with a game. Atleast you can nuke that place and make it more challenging. This is going to make it to THE new Farmplace and Siloruns are finally somewhat useful. And it seperates the Players to different farmplaces :x With the Burrows. Whitespringsetcstill stay reliable as  farm spots.
---
Yeah me too. I really hope it‚Äôs fixed before the ‚Äúnuclear winter‚Äù or whatever it‚Äôs called DLC drops that I‚Äôve been hearing about. That sounds like it‚Äôll be great. A direct cause and effect scenario that was player created (kinda). But we‚Äôll see. Thanks though. I appreciate the thought.
---
I think it's ok. I spent around 30 minutes, twice,  exploring everything, looking in every nook and cranny.
---
I would be ok with added content, but there really isn't very much to do there. I did find out that the spawn rate for the mobs is pretty quick, seems to start respawning 20-30 min after you clear them.
---
It's ok, but again not worth the effort ha! I mean if I got that exact same gun with the exact same effects off a regular legendary, I'd struggle to get 1.5k for it because it still is pretty weak ha!
---
Happened during my first Scorched Earth.
---
Floor decoration. With the deathclaw statue line. Go right.
---
I hopped in and took one for the team yesterday. Was dead in less than 15 seconds. Had serendipity and nerd rage maxed out. 
---
Was carrying a ton of scrap. Thankfully I didn't lose it.  
---
I also healed a number of people who were asking for healing. ... Apparently though none of my shots damaged the bot and I got nothing off the body.
---
I had the same issue which I solved in the same way. Having to turn it off every time I returned to camp became really annoying lol.
---
We should have text chat for the disabled community.
---
In survival I run my PA w/ultracite and stealth boy and mostly AA auto handmade rifle w/suppressor. It doesn‚Äôt do incredible damage like the Gauss but it cuts through armor like nothing and I can fire off 25 rounds and reload in no time.  The distance/accuracy is really good as well. 
---
For lower level enemies I can usually kill them in a couple of shots.  Higher level enemies require more of a burst but that‚Äôs the beauty of the handmade.
---
Exactly what sort of crashes are you getting? Like what happens?
---
I‚Äôm level 94 and I have yet to see a 3* weapon of any sort ever, nor do I have the perks I want to re-balance things now that we have things like build planners.
---
Yes day hasnt changed yet ;)
---
I don't know that hours spent farming one location for the minuscule chance at a decent 3* drop is really "quality" play time.
---
I agree!
---
I think people are trying to find purpose in the game. Farming has become the goal of the game (rare drops to sell and trade). I am not a fan of legendary farming so if I see whitespring nuked I server hop (but grab some flora first!).
---
At least the next one seems pretty good. I'm not a big gunner but a 2 shot 50 cal would be pretty useful I bet.
---
The common sense in the design astounds me though. You know full well that this is a online game and it‚Äôs not hard to look at a competitor and see what they are doing with the end game content. Why on earth would you make a noninstance dungeon and expect it to not be overrun and underwhelming to the player base? You know this is not a single player game, so why would you design it as if it was? Common sense!
---
ah ok, well at least it's a new place to farm, maybe it'll thin out the player traffic from other places.
---
I already used to do a Harper's Ferry run anyway so I'll just extend it below I guess.
---
And is sole survivor a hunting or a lever? I can put a silencer on it if you're on xbox mate
---
I've read that you actually *can* deal damage to it when it's shielded. Something like an AA .50 machine gun can damage it because of how much damage it can quickly inflict.
---
The whole point of open world sandbox games is to do what you want with the level.
---
followed a guy for an hour or so last night because he was running Encryptid. he didn't even want to wait for people to start. he was so op that he would just ask whoever is there to make sure to power the pylons, and he would down the thing in seconds. one run, i wasn't even able to get a hit in.
---
People can play the game however they like and if you don‚Äôt like play something else
---
Same for me. I only get aid and junk, no plans and no apparel now. This has been the last 6 turn ins.
---
*gets 1 shotted by a TSE Tesla rifle*
---
I have both. I'll try later when I can play.
---
Yeah, I had a 90% reduced weight handmade that, when modded, weighed 14.6 lbs.
---
Yeah cause that worked so well for diablo...wait...
---
I definitely understand
---
Nah, they just did the equivalent of loosening the jar lid for you  :)
---
I can't afford to Fast Travel accross the Map willy-nilly.  I've got around 3.5K in Caps and I need 6k, so I walk most places, I'll FT to some places, just not everywhere/ all the time.
---
Do you have a legendary baseball bat because if you do I will take your legendary baseball bat in return for a light 3-star legendary
---
Hasn't 2 shot been nerfed to death? I sold all my tse stuff for bloodied explosives ha! And tbh, you could probs get a tse 50 cal for less than 10k caps on here.
---
Everyone keeps telling me that my quest reward sledgehammer and power armor are "god tier", who knew?
---
Did you even read your own post? 
---
Lol man the average Reddit poster is so full of themselves. NOW NOW NOW NOW.
---
Did not know the mole miner could double dip. Now my West Tek farming will go so much quicker with my mutant slayers gauntlet. Thank you!
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre over exaggerating or just mentally I‚Äôll.
---
That sounds like a raid not a dungeon
---
I'm nowhere near the oulier. You are simply the vocal minority.
---
For me it‚Äôs that one that goes ‚ÄúPraise the lord and pass the ammunition.‚Äù
---
I absolutely love that one.
---
Actually I‚Äôd like to create new character explosive master with grenades and grenade launcher, and role play it
---
But I‚Äôll create it when exp doubles so I‚Äôll add u later and we can have some fun
---
This I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôll watch the bosses health next time I‚Äôm usually doing conduit duty burning thru stimpaks and food
---
Post like this really make the poster sound stupid and needy for attention.
---
That's pretty much every MMO before raids open.
---
As I said, the game is in a "cocoon" stage, that's pretty obvious, let's see the upcoming big patches what will bring... there's no subscription so I think the wait can be pretty painless, I was far more pissed at spending months doing the exact same end raid in WOW before a new expansions landed
---
There was no patch yesterday.
---
I would love to see this proposed footage.
---
This is EXACTLY why his volume was turned down to begin with. But people complained that they couldn't hear him even when standing in the same room.  
---
The only way to really fix the sound issue and enhance discovery is to enter the basement via a transition screen.
---
Omg this.  I like farming.
---
I was there just a couple of days ago and encountered a couple of 3 star legendaries. Got a 3* and a 2* drop. 
---
I'm normally not nearly that lucky.
---
If you are on PC and you don't play bloodied, are you interested in selling/trading the bloodied handmade? Is it max level?
---
I finally got to explore it last night. That's why I had hoped it would be instanced, because part of me wonders if I just get there after it's already been looted and pillaged. But by the same token, everyone is getting these results.
---
I did get a one star death tambo out of it. That's it.
---
2 shot is down to 25%. But still for people who don't use any outside market it's still pretty good.
---
Mine was an ammo plant defend event. Level 25 me, 1 lvl 50 vertibot, 3 lvl 12 gun enplacements and a handful of level 4 turrets versus level 50 Scorchbeast and a bunch of level 40 scorched. 45 min later, stood on its dead head.
---
The rewards don't get better by turning in more than one at once.
---
I don't want to offend you or something. I just don't uderstand it. If i met multiple 3* legendaries just walking around trying to kill 50 dogs and mirelurks, how can you not meet one in 25levels. This is too bad.
---
None of that implies either way is correct. Just save your legendaries.
---
the vocal minority that wants a multi-player online game that has been out for 6 months to add end game content? lol. 
---
Do you read the shit you write?
---
I know that. I didn't spell it out, but the information I had was from like February, and there have been multiple patches since then, and I wanted to be sure it hadn't changed before I started a new build.
---
One of the few ideas on here that is not only good, but practical.
---
This is the first Fallout game that I don't fear Deathclaws.
---
player suchandsuch -you are hearby charged with gbh,in that you did,without reason nor provication,attack another player or players camp.
---
you are forthwith de-leveled to level 1 and all that entails.your special points are now forfiet and your high ranked weapons and armour are, as of now,disabled.
---
You are bound to appear at xxxxxxx magistrate court at 10am before judge blogs.
---
this is your first offence,but should be noted -
---
should further charges be leveled against you,then you may face a lifetime bann from both bethesta and all related networks.
---
Now...where's this "Hide post" again...
---
We'll dc universe online and neverwinter have a auction house and it works amazing you throw your crap in you pay 10% and set your price it's there for 2 days. So if it doesn't get sold its sent back to his mail. We would also need a mailing service lol.
---
Either way it‚Äôs not particularly funny.
---
/u/BACONSHARK_ gots the right idea
---
Yeah I was gonna mention neverwinter but didnt know if anyone would know what that is lol
---
Looks like a box of screws.
---
Cave Crickets and Yao Guais in this game make them pale in comparison sadly, even the alpha glowing deathclaws die pretty fast if you shoot them in the belly.
---
I notice a far worse societal connection, people defend dishonesty as " marketing" no wonder the world is so fucked up , these are the same apathetic people that are the global majority, the same that defend dishonest politicians. Because they root for the same side as that politician , barley anyone thinks anymore . People are conditioned throughout life to not question , just obey. And it shows. It's ok for sales people to be dishonest. ( it's not ok for anyone to be dishonest)
---
I explained the results of doing this. Time and resources spent making content that is limited in play and limited in who can play it.
---
I never said it wouldn‚Äôt be fun. 
---
They are focusing on making content that the majority of players will find fun. 
---
Sorry you burned through the game.
---
Well, I think the fact everyone we've met so far is dead is a decision made by the dev, not an accident, so if it depressed you, I'd say their objective is reached.
---
Plus, I'd say that sometimes listening to a holotape KNOWING that its author is dead is what creates the perfect ambiance. The hopes and fear and the way they speak make it feel like they truly thought they could make it ...
---
We are at the beginning of the apocalypse. It's made to be depressing.
---
while the Daisycutter that has the exact same legendary drops it down to 6 pounds from its original 20. 
---
Rifle builds are so heavy. Lever and Handmade weight stacks up faster than getting rads from a nuke while being naked
---
They should have capped the levels. Why the hell they didn‚Äôt is beyond me.
---
There is endgame content. SBQ. Sheepsquatch. Certain areas.
---
Ok, yeah. I love those guys, I really feel like I found the place to party.
---
Yeah that poison spit is no joke
---
Sounds like something someone from the tech cult would say.
---
That's still not terrible I suppose. Probs shouldn't have sold them üòÇ And I don't know how you can play this game without reddit. Most of the fun I have is being a trader on here!
---
When i was level 18 i was killing them
---
I love mmo's lol love grinding quest and hording gear lol
---
Right, they aren't the whole playerbase. They are the majority of the playerbase. Almost every single server has a majority of players over level 50. Either you just don't pay attention, or you are pulling stuff out of your ass.
---
Does the final encounter of the quest drop any special loot? I ended up having ye olde body falls through world and no meat pile appears issue.
---
Like hard crash? That's also happen to me twice today. Happen when alot of stuff is loading in for me.
---
i did it with no melee perks or damage boost perks with a lvl 30 assoultron blade and it didnt change a thing I still finished it in 10 minutes, didnt die once or even got close too it.
---
Those are both good guns. Give them both a try and see which you like better. My guess is the instigating will be better than the anti armor, but anti armor might be a good way to get past those assassin's sentinel sets...
---
Lmao dude thank you. Ripped right into these idiots.
---
All of them or just a few? Because it's likely no effect. If it is something affected, it would mean it's been scripted different than every interior cell in Bethesda history.
---
So... Possible, not likely.
---
Alright, I hear this a lot. "Fallout should go to a new company!"
---
Alright, then who?
---
EA and subsidaries? Ha!  Don't even get me started.  "Legendary tokens now only 5.99!"
---
CD Project Red? That would be awesome.  However, I'd like to play both cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 5, and the Witcher 4 before I die of old age, so...
---
Oblivion?  Epic exclusive Fallout! Either rushed and buggy in release, or never finished. And a 50/50 shot they lose the property when they go bankrupt.  Again.
---
Valve? Too busy distributing games to make them anymore.  Also a good chance that Fallout 5 gets overhyped and becomes vaporware.
---
Anyone else have more ideas? I'm not going to sit here and say Bethesda is some shining light on a hill in the gaming industry.  Theyve mishandled a lot with this game and should be held to task for it. But I trust them a lot more than some of their peers.
---
It is hilarious. Perfectly captures the whiners
---
High level =/= End Game. 
---
The closest thing we have to end game is Encryptid and it takes all of four minutes to complete. Do you think Bethesda is unaware that they have a large segment of their community that is overgeared for the content they have and are continuing to release? That ain't end game, pal.
---
All of them are glowing 
---
Just nuke and try it
---
Struck a nerve? Lol
---
It is what it is.
---
I did Census Violence at lvl 60ish, went through 9? Deathclaws, got screws and titanium as the only notable things.
---
Ok, I must have read some overhyped player BS then, because I seemed to have had that impression too.
---
This is where the fun begins...
---
I want a Boss and a Dungeon that says "you need to go home and rethink your build and your Team tactics" .
---
I don't want every piece of content like that but i do have that itch for a grueling challenge , one where your Team needs its A Game.
---
My favourite part was where your cousin ate babies. 7/10
---
I found a 2 star bloodied, even though I don't play a bloodied build. Even a regular one gets the job done against sheepsquach or SBQ
---
There‚Äôs no distinction, meaning they are one and the same. Caps on your person is your bank account, so losing half of that is untenable.
---
Lol nah, just same old threads
---
Yeah I found those almost right after they spawned (my camp is right by there, and I hit toxic Larry's for acid and meat regularly.) My theory is that we'll have to find or craft Smarty's big Critter Bait, which will be technically an aid item that will spoil quickly, and until it spoils it will draw large enemies towards you. If you happen to be wearing a Sheepsquatch outfit at the time, it will trigger a Sheepsquatch spawn.
---
as an older gentleman, with many pressing real life issues, the community reaction has become as much a part of the entertainment as the game. I enjoy the whole package, and am eternally grateful for the distraction :)
---
Good point.  Early on in the game it seemed I focused way too much on collecting crap and picked up weight reduction perks and then I realized well that‚Äôs not very smart.  I now run an explosive shotgun and AA auto rifle build so now maxed out on all dmg and explosive perks for those two types of weapons.  Plus fireproof and wanderer and starched genes along with adrenaline and enforcer.   I‚Äôm still playing around with other combinations but it helps at lvl 150+ as I have a lot of cards to play with.
---
Thanks for the info homie
---
Its not an event that happens on a routine basis. Someone has to start it.
---
Just have to hold out for a while longer, I assume with player vending they will also add pacifist to camps to protect player shops. Just a bit longer, I hope.
---
Never once did i lie.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm reading too, thanks for the info tho! üòéüëçüèº
---
What do you mean? This is a fucking parody, actually read it.
---
You aren't being punished. It is a fallout game. At some point in all Fallout games you become so over geared you play in a state of "godmode".
---
Congratulations, you have reached that point. You will never find this game challenging. Bethesda will never add PvE content for overgeared godmode players.
---
The only challenge you will ever have with your OP builds is playing on that arcade Survival mode against other players.
---
Im there with you!
---
there is also absolutely no guarantee that there will ever be raids, at least not in the sense of a traditional MMO. If this is their idea of a dungeon, then we need to start talking about what they will mean when they say "raid."
---
Struck a nerve?
---
I have 600 hours on my one guy.
---
Don't know why everyone is hating on you so much, legendaries don't fall from the sky unless you go to some specific places for them and three stars are not even guaranteed to be good. No need to be obsessive about better gear when you're doing fine. You play the game your way man, and I hope you get better drops in the future.
---
2 shot isnt bad on a rapid fire gun. For sure better than instigating and shot for shot better than furious (that takes a few hits to stack up to 25% bonus). 
---
For a strait build anyway. It's not going to touch something specialist like bloodied.
---
Just a bethesda shill. Nothing to see here.
---
Short name: The Guarantee
---
Long name: The Guarantee You Will Never Ever Want To Use This
---
Yeah I had the jukebox for a long time, then I wanted the radio. The only thing I don't like about the radio is that it always turns itself off after you've re-logged, I wish it could remember its switched-on state like the jukebox.
---
Every online game needs to develop a system to identify griefers and then make sure they only play with other griefers. 
---
For this game, I think people should be tired with those of similar player kills.  You hit 100 pks in a day and Im going to guess the vast majority of players just aren't going to want to be near you.
---
Thank you good sir. Take my upvote as well. Luckily for me, my good karma outweighs my bad.
---
Brotherhood only had standard gear. I'm sure no one had TSE weapons or perk cards.
---
lol i like how everyone lost their minds before actually using the tool that's used to make the current end game zones
---
I do this all the time
---
Does furious only go up to 25%?? I thought it was 45? Wont be buying any furious stuff then ha!
---
You just called areas on the map end game content haha. The same areas that are there when you start the game? Yes, you're a liar.
---
Yep, I agree. Also I think people shouldn‚Äôt be so quick to pile on Bethesda when free content doesn‚Äôt fit exactly how they play the game and how they THINK the game should be played. 
---
I‚Äôve more than surpassed getting my money‚Äôs worth for $60, so anything added to the game now is just gravy.
---
i have done 3/4 of the side quests for shear terror, and assuming the forth also gives me a plan, this one is the odd one out.
---
absolutely true, in the "smaller scale" of the game (that is, not a true MMO) raids could very well be 4 man dungeons 30min long... point is, the game is evolving, and at a pretty fast rate lately, and I don't know you but from the start I thought this was gonna be the way things would've been handled, after their open letter to the community... I may be too optimistic but I still believe the game will get better almost monthly now.
---
oooh ill have to check thank you!
---
*BUT THE BROTHERHOOD CANT BE IN WEST VIRGINIA! THE BROTHERHOOD CANT HAVE TRAVELED EAST AT THAT POINT! REEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!*
---
^(This is a joke, especially for people who bitched about the BOS being in WV and not doing the BOS story line)
---
It's like they know people will be disappointed but they could care less. Once you've sucked people in, well they'll bitch and moan but show up the next day. It's like a corporation and it's employees. They don't care if you're fairly happy they just want to make that money off you.
---
See... what you have listed here is exactly what plagues the game. Fallout 76 is the *pinnacle of wasted potential*... just flatout wasted. It is astonishing how anyone in charge at Bethesda could have ever OKed this game. The discrepancies between, say, the outstanding atmosphere, music, sound, art direction, engaging "visual storytelling" and top-notch world design on the one hand - and so many piss-poor gameplay decisions, lackluster quest design, bad performance, horribly dated engine and defacto nonexistant QA/testing on the other hand is astonishing! Absolutely mindblowing. As if the game was developed by different teams operating in total isolation of each other... 
---
I shudder at the thought what an awesome awesome game 76 *could* have been - but never ever will be.
---
Like me, many other players and fans of the franchise are not mean, ungrateful, ill-tempered hatemongers who just want to shit all over Bethesda. We love the franchise. We want it to be good and we want it to be successful. And we are willing to give it a chance... multiple chances even. But the problems with the game cannot be fixed and will never ever ever be fixed by simply adding more of the same broken, half-assed, mediocre, thoughtless and low-effort content - via big paid DLCs or small free driplets.
---
So you think there is only three companies that could create a new fallout? Really? A New company could be anything from small size to big size who just has a passion to create a good and polished game. I don't even mind about paying micro-payments if the game is good, because any hobby costs money. However Bethesda isn't even trying to make FO76 any better, because they are already focusing to create new broken games with big hype. They just fix FO76 as less as its needed to avoid lawsuits and cash out all they can.
---
I'm not sure. I think its between 30-50 max. But will take a half dozen hits to stack that high. 2 shot is the strait 25 all the time every shot.
---
Ooh more options, thank you!
---
*You gotta pay the Troll Toll
---

---
ok, how high gear are we talking?
---
like, what armor requires purchase, and what requires scrapping.
---
metal? trapper? etc?
---
Yeah it's max level and I might end up selling it eventually, but I'll hold on to it for now. It also looks like I won't have time to get on in the next few days
---
Tell me you didn't seriously go punching hes in your walls over a goddamn video game üòÇ
---
I've only heard it 3 times in my entire play time. Everytime I listen to the radio it's just a constant repeat of the same songs with the occasional "Wouldn't it be nice".
---
Why is this kind of content not acceptable though? I still want more end game content. Stuff like sheepsquatch, events for the whole server that require unique tactics to complete with solid rewards. I still have high hopes for the Pioneer Scouts quest line, and the Arktos dungeon, and whatever the vaults end up being, and especially the Wastelanders update.
---
But in between those larger updates why can't we just get a new dungeon here and there? What exactly is unacceptable about that?
---
Oh nah I was just curious about the ‚Äúbank account‚Äù part hahaha.
---
Flying around like Iron Man and being badass is what it looked like. I won‚Äôt fault anyone for falling for Anthem. What I fault is how do you fuck up flying around like Iron Man and being badass?
---
This is really simple. You cannot keep measuring the current content on the basis of what it COULD be in the future. That is a fool's errand and will only lead to further sunk cost fallacy. 
---
This was billed as a dungeon, it isnt a dungeon. So your response is "well, lets wait for the raids." When faced with the reality of this most recent content release, you are then left with "well maybe the raids will actually be dungeons" but the problem is, we dont have any dungeons now... That is pretzel logic and I get it, because we all WANT the game to improve and for end game content to be released and offer a new challenge. But at this point we have no evidence to suggest that will happen and no existing precedent.
---
ugh, yeah defend them. sad really.
---
He must have joined the BOS they're a bunch of Wussies. I told him to stay away from them. Poor Timmy would've been better off on his own.
---
I believe Sheepsquatch has similar origin as the Deathclaw. It was killing people before the war so it makes since that the military was working on a Deathclaw that has projectiles.
---
There are two ways I can answer this:
---
1. While the silos are part of the endgame run, I'd argue that the Scorchbeast Queen is more endgame than the silos are.  Until you can practically take down the SBQ on your own, you have something to aim for.
---
2. You can willfully make the game more difficult for yourself by gravitating into a different build, changing what armor you wear, limiting what weapons you use, etc.
---
You sound like a libtard when they don't get their own way
---
I had one 3 star ghoul. 
---
Got a lvl 50 medic/explosive/+vats build  combat shotgun. Pretty much the holy grail find... for one of my other characters (shotgun/powerarmor  VATS medic). Ha!
---
I've had tons of success with this event thanks to the r/filthycasuals76 group of players (mostly on their discord). We all linger in the chat and when the event pops off we notify each other and rush to said player.
---
there's also cranberries there you can use to make +5% xp pies
---
This sounds like a lot of fun! Add me on psn at radiationdaddy if you feel up to role playing with a newbie!
---
Think you are thinking of Sons of Dane Compound, the Sons of Dane Logging Camp is a separate location with some wood and a bunch of tents, only bugs and dogs spawn there
---
That's why I said "I may be too optimistic" :D 
---
We can't deny, though, that content is constantly being poured out, even if it's "small" at this point (I think many resources are still being used to correct bugs, improve performances and balance things). 
---
It's true we have no existing precedent, but neither do they, and that's exactly what they've been stating since day 1, so that's why I'm optimistic about it, because they're "growing with us" and it seems that they're processing the feedback we give them (obviously not instantly, because that's not how things works).
---
To be fair, they didnt fuck up flying like Iron Man.... Whats bad is that EA had to tell them to put that in because they wanted to cut it XD. I mean shit, EA is actually helping your design team, thats how bad things were going....  
---
Its just a bad tech demo with flying in terms of content, and they put overheat mechanics on the flying to even dampen the one good feature they have.
---
Tell that to Three Dog!
---
Ah, yes, one important caveat, kiddies. Those feral ghouls that prefer the dark, dank underground? They ARE basically mindless zombies. So kill as many as you damn well please
---
I 100% will when Classic comes out for WoW. I'm sorry if this sounds like an elitist asshole thing to say, but if $15 per month was a financial hardship, I wouldn't be playing video games at all.
---
The normal freeze followed by a crash. Sometimes it just freezes until I alt+F4. That happens roughly 30minutes to 2 hours of play. Mostly just untouchable items that should be touchable. Another fairly common glitch that doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay much is half of my character is IN the ground. That ones less annoying. Makes everything look stupid but doesn‚Äôt matter unless I‚Äôm trying to wall jump. There have been others but not so often that I can directly recall the issue right now. I still get the take damage while walking glitch sometimes too.
---
I would take some out of demo expert and find a way to run serendipity 3
---
How did you know I'm clairvoyant? 
---
Ordinary people need to read stuff before they know it's good or bad.
---
Weak, and as boring as the complaint posts.
---
Lvl 50 noobs still have a large part of the game to explore. I understand the disappointment that people who have played this game for some time have with what is basically just another building to enter.
---
I got lucky one time where three people stayed on the pylons the whole entire fight.
---
You can hear him better from outside the room than you do standing next to him.
---
You can in Red Dead 2. It increases your dead eye at the loss of health. The loss was very small. Maybe this could enhance perception at the loss of endurance?
---
Honestly I don't think they actually thought about the fact of the Burrows being able to be nuked, there ware way too many legendaries that spawn there for this to be intended.
---
Man. You fanboys never quit. Lol. Always with the excuses.
---
It's not an mmo. It's fallout with friends. If you'll watch the e3 announcement again, it's very clear that that's what it's intended to be. (Todd was saying "everyone has those cool stories of what they discover, now just with a group") 
---
I want it to have hard mmo like content just as much as the next guy, but to expect the word dungeon to mean the mmo definition instead of the single player rpg version is a bit of a stretch. This sub almost universally wants that kind of content, and that's fine, but you can't let your desires twist your expectations.
---
Perhaps raids will be more what the sub is looking for, as that's not a term that is generally used in single player rpgs or Bethesda games in general.
---
Not quite as much, but one good place I found is the top of the cliff, if you go across the bridge heading east from Harper's ferry, then try to get up to the highest point there. Probably 6 or 8 copper nodes
---
I wasn't aware of this either, although I did know that my MMG consistently seemed to do more damage than the Deathclaw Gauntlet when both are upgraded.
---
&gt;more ghoulish the more rads you took
---
I'd roll up a Radicool glass canon in a heartbeat if this was the case
---
I think if that statement about them growing with us were true, we wouldn't have seen them advertise this update as an end game release knowing full well that they were going to tune it to two level 50's. Bethesda is fully aware that they have a large segment of their player population running around in the hundreds of levels with gear that makes this release a total non factor. 
---
There is plenty they are releasing that I do like, and I don't even mind the Burrows - I mind what it was meant to be versus what it is. The community didn't make it a low level mission with the same mechanics as any other area on the map - the developers did. 
---
The rate at which content is released has to be balanced against the quality of said content.
---
They never said it was going to be instanced. You assumed. Like so many things about this game. 
---
Of course there‚Äôs going to be other players in it. It‚Äôs NEW! In two weeks it won‚Äôt be. That means you won‚Äôt be dealing with other players like you are. You couldn‚Äôt wait to run it. Why would other players?
---
Difficulty is based on your character. The dungeon is difficult for 2 50+ level characters. That difficulty of course goes down the higher the level you are. 
---
Because the higher level you are, the more chances you‚Äôve had in getting better gear and loot. At level 101, I have 4 complete sets of Modded power armor. I never lack for resources.
---
It is tough for solo players. It‚Äôs filled with ghouls that swarm you. The kind have high radiation. If you don‚Äôt have very good rad protection then a few of these will burn through your health.
---
Every other player in the Burrows save 1 was in PA. Usually 0-X1 or Ultracite. Every single one was level 120+. I was the lowest level in there at 101. 
---
The area also respawns pretty fast. So if you hang out you can get good XP and some one star legendaries. 
---
The area is pretty good actually. All the complaints I‚Äôve been seeing are for people that have basically purple red everything in the game. And probably have our leveled just about anything they will add it the game for sometime.
---
Yes, you can nuke Harper's Ferry and you get Glowing Ghouls inside the Burrows.
---
yea Ik thats kinda where I got the idea from, but mainly that you can have injections and pills but cant smoke.
---
password is MA - RY - 11 - 17
---
Also perfectly captures the wieners, who think this is funny.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work for me. Not clever enough, poor attempt at sarcasm. But hey, each to their own.
---
If this was an indie developer i could agree with you.
---
However this company has made Fallout 1-4, why does the newest iteration feel like 3.5 and the content so limited?  Sure you can look at pretty rocks and extend the 5 minutes to 15, woopy.
---
It was not fun, it was not interesting, it was short, it was pathetic.  There is not a knight white enough to justify the bullshit.  You can dig as deep as you want, but saying ‚Äòeveryone rushed through it‚Äô does not mean you blame the community.  Maybe, if it was even slightly interesting, it could have been avoided.
---
No whiskey or chems?
---
Yeah. I know some players do the whole high rads with the armor that makes them op with resistance at low health. I personally prefer high health but might switch if I got a cool new face to go with all my rads
---
You could just use the white Springs inside the main building for the robots they'll respond as fast as you can kill them you should be able to finish the 50 very quickly
---
I think people made it into more than what Bethesda said.
---
First should Bethesda have said, we added a new area in Harpers  alley. Play it if you want. 
---
Second, I‚Äôve seen people say what they thought it was going to be, like instanced. But they never said that.
---
Agreed.  I defend this game on most occasions, but in this instance this is not what was advertised.  If they had said *"A new minor quest coming on April 16th"* people would have enjoyed it more.  You have to manage expectations.  You never want your fanbase to be disappointed, and Fallout 76 already has a massive problem with that.  Now is not the time to start overpromising and underdelivering.
---
They pumped this up as something for 2+ high-level players to tackle, but one *may* be able to do it alone?  That's the proper wording for the sheepsquatch finale.  Not The Burrows.
---
Douchebags like that are why I no longer play. I loved fallout because I didn't have to worry about assholes. I could go through as slow or as fast as I wanted without fear of my experience getting ruined by people who have nothing better to do than to ruin it for you. I hope you reported him.
---
I got a paper cut last night.
---
I don't think infinite leveling is the problem, your SPECIAL is capped at level 50, weapon levels are capped at level 50, all you can do after level 50 is slowly respec or get QOL perks that require you to swap in and out as needed.
---
IMO the real problem is certain legendary gear when stacked and  especially with certain perks and mutations (e.g., bloodied + unyielding + adrenal reaction + nerd rage and sentinel/cavalier + assassin) enable damage and damage mitigation that is way beyond anything the game could ever throw at you without making it impossible for any players not running those incredibly stacked builds. Let's be honest, the likelihood of Bethesda ever implementing content that REQUIRES you to run a meta bloodied build is nonexistent because they don't want to alienate the rest of the player base. A potential solution would be to limit the ability to stack the stronger legendary effects/perks (for example, making it so you can only gain a certain amount of increased damage % or SPECIAL points for having lower health or limiting the max amount of % damage mitigation you can have). Now that's easy for me to say, I don't care for meta builds at all and find them completely unnecessary. I know those types of changes would upset the players who have those builds (especially the ones who bought gear from other players, whether for caps or real money), but honestly it seems like that'd be the best way forward for the player base as a whole.
---
Dunno, but if *I* find it, I'm selling it on the market ASAP.
---
Aright so I took off better criticals, and put on serendipity 3
---

---
I think it's weird how much people want Bethesda to turn FO76 into Destiny, The Division, and other similar games that are known for being failures.
---
P.S. If you are on PS4 let me know and I will get you a run through of The Burrows so we can see what it is and what it isn't. Im happy to get you to Harper's Ferry haha.
---
A power attack with a fire ax can either kill a L52 col gutsy or damn near kill it. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a special axe. I have an instigating super sledge with bonus power attack that absolutely murders on that first hit.
---
Early on, to get away from Scorchbeasts, I took a number of Agility perks like Marathoner and Action Girl to run away as quickly as I could.
---
Funny thing is, even though I can kill Scorchbeasts like no tomorrow, those perks perennially show their value.  I've had a fair bit of success activating the pylons and running laps around the area to avoid everything else.
---
What's the reward for this one?
---
If I can't vape nuclear waste then what's this all been for???
---
East of  Johnson's Acre near a pond with a creek flowing downhill. I'ts a random spawn I saw someone found the same thing on the road in the mire.
---
I was in a happy place when that song was a big meme. Now when i listen to it, it takes me back to the simpler times
---
for REAL? what the guy says is true and you are blind if you dont see it,  im only lvl 43 and i soloed the "dungeon", it was a huge disappointment, again im only lvl 43
---
I'd have to say bloodied. High dps and yea you're a low health but most of the times you're not around anyone else who might steal your death bag. Not really any harsh consequences for death in the fo world.
---
Personally, I use instigating. Because you know enemies are running with full health. I can 1 shot just about anything lvl 68 and lower and if not my knife is fast enough to finish them before they put a dent in me
---
What do you mean by "naked" when wearing power armor?
---
I want to smoke nuclear material mixed with gunpowder and razorgrain
---
Alright - how did you get the pressure plate working on both sides with the door?! I tried helping a buddy with that for an hour yesterday.  Is there something not obvious? Or are we just dumb? We found a couple of tutorials, but weren't able to figure it out!
---
people are very stupid if they downvote you, everything you said makes sense, im only lvl 43 and i soloed the dungeon no problem
---
dont need a hazmat suit if you are in the burrows.
---
I have 3 into strength, use blocker 3 on survival, and bandolier 2 and traveling pharmacy 1 on adventure. Situational but handy against melee builds.
---
lotta details that I'll keep in mind, thanks for your response!
---
Well, THTA makes zero fuckin' sense. But ok.
---
Would be cool if they added the radio beacon from fo4 and when powered would display your camp on the map
---
It's coming with the vault dungeons. Todd said they had to write the code for it and sounds like you log into it with a team. I assume that instance code wasn't ready yet so wasn't implemented.
---
Theres some new content
---
Are they though?
---
World of Tanks is the other game I play, and most the Blueberries and Purples (Which represent the top 5% of the PB skill wise) constantly complain about and are the most vocal about the game on teh Reddits and Forums, and some times they are right, but they have to be constantly reminded that the Greenbeans, Tomatoes and Potatoes (Above Average players and lower) that are 70+% of the player base are the majority, and are whom the game is balanced for. 
---
And just like in this game, the Tomatoes and Potatoes can fail their way to Tier 10 - Level 50+
---
I think i play the game the way i like it thank you very much. You don't like it, find another game.
---
The Guarantee
---
Legendary Fatman
---
\- Double Damage at enemy Full Health
---
\- 15% Faster Reload
---
\- +50% Limb Damage
---
Wait.... you have the sentinel paint???
---
I just wish it had some type of quest, I mean, I found one and got a crappy sword, but other than that, kinda felt like a story and NPC‚Äôs were MEANT to be there but never showed up
---
"you" need to realize even at low levels the dungeon was too easy, i mean, what level ARE you then? im lvl 43 and i was able to solo it no problem... what level do you think the average is anyway?
---
This is correct however I do not understand how it relates to my post.
---
I would love to have non-secured storage added. Leave my stash protected and give me the opportunity to build a storage box (or boxes) that will let me keep things but at the penalty of other people being able to access them as well. This would also enhance CAMP building as you could design in such a way so as to protect your unsecured storage containers.
---
So, blindly accept the lack of payoff of hype and borderline lies. Gotcha.
---
Don't get me wrong, still like the game, still like Bethesda, but this has got to be the video game equivalent of blue balls.
---
Im_chris1186 I'll be on tonight but we can go bbn pvp ppl or jus farm shit
---
request to trade = what have you got that will kill me
---
no mic ? no trade and the only emotes can be interpreted as "f off"
---
There‚Äôs a little bit of new content but not a substantial amount to return. I think the end of each dlc season would be good times to return and play through all the new content released. So end of May for the spring dlc stuff. That way there‚Äôs a greater amount of new content to keep you busy for 10+ hours or so.  I always tell people the game has improved slightly with each patch due to their 2 steps forward one step back track record. However I am a daily player and I enjoy it. So I guess if dlc and new content is the reason you want to come back maybe wait a little longer.
---
That's a nice mid tier set. I'd say each of those pieces is worth 2-5k
---
Yeah I wished it came on the radio more
---
Something on the scale of Fallout would require a decently sized developer.  Passion is great but it doesn't pay for graphic design, programing, development, equipment, marketing, etc... 
---
Those were the only 4 I could think of off the top of my head which is why I invited others to provide more.  You have a list handy? 
---
Also, why are you even here if you think all they are doing to 76 is the bare minimum to reduce legal liability?  Mos of us here enjoy the game for the most part.  You know what most people do when they don't like a game?  Im pretty sure they don't post comments in the game's subreddit.
---
teapot usually has both insects and canines.
---
morgantown airport event for scorched.
---
You don't need pacifist to not get hurt by other players. In fact, that's never what it has done.
---
Are you American by any chance?
---
There could be some really interesting mechanics tied to that. For example, a quest line that ends with you at West Tek getting dipped in FEV where the end result is based on total rads your character has taken to that point. In the unlikely event you've taken no radiation, you become Nightkin. Below a certain threshold, you're a 1st gen. Take too many rads and congratulations, you're a dumb-dumb.
---
Conversely, one of the power plants can go critical, turning everyone inside into a ghoul. Now your health bar is replaced by a rad bar and you have to take radiation to heal.
---
I don‚Äôt want to worry about optimal build. I build for what is fun. For my play style. I‚Äôm super good at stealthing and damage while stealthier. But I‚Äôm a glass cannon, if they see me and come for me I go down quick. But I love stealthing, I want to be like Boone, the last thing you never saw.
---
Bitches about griefers then becomes one...
---
Comment says two AP Refresh pieces, but I only see one.  (And two right arms)
---
Which is completely the fault of Bethesda actually. If you have to handicap yourself in a game to make it difficult/enjoyable then it is a game with flaws. Players should have to challenge the systems provided and be challenged in return. It is a flaw in all their games where you inevitably become good again all NPCs
---
You equip it like a weapon, so its supposed to be way faster at taking pictures than photomode. I love taking pictures and I'm already unimpressed. Lol
---
You could maybe sell the whole set for 5k.
---
I've over 350 hours in 76 and the borrows is the final nail in the coffin for me. I'm not going into the technical issues I'm having with the game as a whole (still) Its a well trodden path, so I'm just going to quietly lay it to rest. 
---
I only ever want one thing from a game and that is fun. 76 stopped being fun (for me) months ago.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Just use a wall passthrough conduit to feed power from one side of the wall to the outside. The wire from the plate automatically should clip through the wall to the powered door.
---
I honestly think the BOS and Enclave were incorporated pretty well
---
I carry 5 weapons. For me it‚Äôs some strength perks but also perks to make my junk and food lighter.
---
No. It's unwholesome, and sets a bad example for any kids playing this game.
---
Go pop some psycho and get wasted on nukashine instead.
---
I was expecting it to be tough, like needing a 2nd person 50+ to make it easier. Like maybe nuke-silo tough. Spoiler ... it was not.
---
&gt; I think ~~people~~ Bethesda made it into more than what ~~Bethesda said~~ it was.
---
Let's not just completely ignore what Bethesda said about it moving into this, here.
---
I can take all three pylons if other players will actually attack the sheepsquatch and not run around doing no damage, screaming that they're dying. I wasted 2000 caps yesterday on people doing that and failing the event. Healing isn't an issue if players will keep the squatch off the conduit (Cola Nut/Nuka Cherry, various cooked scorchbeast meats), hell, I can still fight a few bots.  Just please keep Squatch away from me.
---
Lmao people here are making posts like "IT'S NOT EVEN INSTANCED? AND IT'S NOT LIKE A WOW DUNGEON? WTF"
---
Even though they never fucking said it was going to be instanced, and anyone that's PLAYED FALLOUT 4 knows what fallout dungeons are like.
---
The community here are absolute morons. You overhype every little thing they announce.
---
got it, thank you!
---
The gun is valued at about 12-15+k and the armor I'd value at about 2500-4k each. So pretty much a even trade if it was me and I had a extra set laying around.  And if I waa wanted the gun bad enough I'd do it.
---
Keep on trying! I know a few locations that have lots of TD
---
Whoops you‚Äôre right! I messed up the pic but the description is the real trade.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm now in the process of slowly moving points from intelligence, think it‚Äôs 7 or 8 now. Wasted points really, Will be moving to strength probably.
---
Good luck, I hope that the updates treat you well and you'll be able to play the game properly soon enough. The nuclear winter update path looks like itll be interesting.
---
Or maybe the 18k offer..
---
I‚Äôm trying out a bloodied nerd rage build for the first time and although the build isn‚Äôt fully complete I find myself dying quite a lot, is this normal? I‚Äôm using x01 PA
---
She went in without any armor or clothes. Her build is PA focused.
---
To me injections and pills isnt? to me thats worse since you can see people smoking in public.
---
hey i know this thread is old but in the lore, alpine cabins was rigged to be scary, like with spinning paintings, and random screaming to scare guests
---
That's why i'm waiting a day or so before doing the burrows. Let everyone else get it out of their system so I can take my time on it.
---
  Substituting a person‚Äôs actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument.
---
Yeah that about sums it up.
---
Fuck of now troll.
---
Go ask anyone under level 100 if they are new or using an alt. 70%-90% are probably old players trying to respark the drive to keep going. I got a 118 a 83 and i may be starting over yet again for a friend. Met a lvl 35 yesterday that was an alt of a lvl 78.   
---
This dudes fanboying too hard. I did complete the entire thing without realizing it wasn't just the entrance to the dungeon.  I now understand what it feels like to be the dog when you pretend throw a ball and the he jets off in confusion.  I did a fair exploration of the place and found 2 holo tapes plus  a  whole bunch of empty sewers. Sniffing glue was popular down there and I am negan the end. Dude even had the same emphasis on words as negan... is that considered an easter egg or lazy writing/acting. Not complaining myself as the cheese spread well with me.  But every other building in any fallout game including 4 had a richer fuller story to tell. This place felt gutted with a bunch of ghouls peppered in. Needed like 10x the notes or at least someone documenting what happened down there on a computer/holotapes. Theres already 400 audio tapes would a few more have hurt. When i got to the robot part it felt even worse. They keep recycling infinite robot makers. What the hell man there is just water everywhere. Could have added some conanesque water monsters everywhere and a larger boss one in the final room. Which had a huge space of water bellow it with 2 ramps to get down. Why even  put the ramps in. Then you dump us out into water. All this for no freaking reason.
---
End of the day it's a new nukable zone to run through and kill a bunch of shit on. I think the vaults will be bigger and harder but I'd be alright with more mini dungeons like the burrows if they're as nicely designed. Would appreciate more holotapes or terminals tho, they're like 90% of what I go hunting for in this game.
---
I agree, I'm still baffled by how much damage melee can crank out compared to firearms on most days lol.
---
üòê
---
I dont care about harder, just want substance
---
The first time I did the final fight in the burrows there were waves of enemies. The other three times I did it we simply got the three enemies that had already spawned then it was over. Seems very inconsistent in terms of what kind of enemy numbers you will actually face.
---
Thanks for the response. I couldn‚Äôt even find the original announcement when I looked. It seems like a lot of people are unaware of this
---
question (serious). I see damage output.your going to weigh like a brick,and what are you going to eat,drink and health,junk,,,,,,
---
just wondering
---
I too would like to know the answer to this.
---
Colon health is no laughing matter!  Just 2 Gastroenterologist giving each other a checkup.
---
totally misread that. Sorry.
---
don't think sent is in yet. I've got a complete set (incl initiates) up through elder
---
I've always wanted to play a ghoul. Not just cosmetically, but like in TES where NPCs react to your character being Argonian or Khajit or what-have-you.
---
I saw the one at pumpkin house and I ran away
---
Does AP refresh stack?
---
Same. Waiting for sentinel. I figured that they added it because how the burrows is a BOS kind of quest. Also expected to get BOS camp items too.
---
Now I need a lawn flamingo melee weapon. Bethesda, make it happen!
---
This is a serious question, but if what they released with The Burrows is a high level "dungeon" in their minds (and in their words), what realistically do you think they mean when they say "raid?" 
---
I dont think we can take them at face value until proven otherwise.
---
Invest in perks like serendipity, blocker, dodgy and suppressor
---
Nope, but I'm gonna change it when the update is done
---
they would *probably* make it like the distress beacon from fo4 and the tracker from the hunter/hunted event. where it beeps more the closer you get.
---
You can get Handmades and Radium rifles to learn mods for them  thats all for what treasure maps are good.
---
On XBox you only get 50 photo slots to use and already I am juggling in order to take more. Add to that the anomaly that someone else on their XBox user profile shares the photos (as well as seell other user data like challenge progress) and it's pointless having a camera ... unless they allow way more photos space
---
Can't wait. Hopefully they'll have some cool loot.
---
Good God man, why would you do that?
---
yes sure ive been robbed of the potential. semantics.
---
Wish he could help in the fight he's always "have at thee" then gets smacked once by a rad rat and breaks.
---
PVE I run a heavy weapons build, with bear arms you can carry several heavy weapons with various effects to swap between depending on the situation. Vampires .50 machine gun is handy if you want to tank large  mobs whilst feeling invincible lmao, tse is always fun too.
---
When I fancy a change of pace I swap perks out for sneak/covert and rifleman, slap on some chameleon armour and go stealth sniper with an instigating gause. 
---
It‚Äôs should be about what you enjoy with the flexibility change your style as you fancy or a situation dictates.
---
What perk?
---
I get that some people really want to be the most powerful thing on the map, but it's just not fun for me. I like having to think about where I'm taking cover so I won't take too much damage and planning attacks ect (I really miss the leaning from cover fallout 4 had.)OP builds where you one shot everything just ruins it for me, unless they can one shot you back.
---
Excatly, and those storage boxes could be locked same way as doors, generators and purifiers. Also i think that it would add a cherry to the top for brand new survival mode.
---
Whoa where is this? I haven‚Äôt seen any radbears before.
---
Oh, I'm with you. I'm just letting people know that Instanced 'raids' are coming. Didn't make any assertion about it being good or not.
---
sexy time!
---
Depends on the weapon and build. If you‚Äôre swinging a big 2H melee, Instigating is fine. In fact even if you‚Äôre spec‚Äôd for something else, in PA you can probably 1 shot most things in PVE w/ an instigating weapon (certainly farm Whitespring)
---
Low damage high ROF ranged ... I‚Äôd probably go BE or AAE. Maybe Furious, but I think it tops early ... so maybe Mutant‚Äôs if you were going to consider Furious? BE definitely if you have a bloodied / adrenal build. Executioners is also pretty solid for multi-shot weapons.
---
My pistols build uses AAE and even TSE. For times when I want to conserve health, I use a Vamp. Pistol damage is low so the AA is very helpful.
---
On handmade or combat or assault rifles w/ an AA perk you can probably shift towards BE, FE or even ME.
---
Higher damage ranged I‚Äôd maybe look at Instigating or even Quad if your single shot is good. I have a Quad / Fire Rate Gauss and it was a life-changer. If I could find an Instigating / Damage while aiming Gauss that‚Äôd be glorious.
---
Mostly you want some armor reduction for SB/SBQ, super mutants and robots. You don‚Äôt need any of that for most ghouls, scorched, etc. If you don‚Äôt have it with a perk (Incisor, Tank Killer, etc.) you‚Äôll want one weapon with it ... and only use Instigating on big damage items usually.
---
This is me every time üòÇ
---
I have blocked and suppressor already. Serendipity doesn‚Äôt work in PA so I wasted my points on that, I will get dodgy next
---
He's holding back.
---
Oh, look at you, Mr. opportunistic trader. ^i'll probably do the same
---
Makes me stop and listen every time it's playing on a radio in-game, awesome song, in an awesome game!
---
play style and situational ideals, havent thought of that one yet, thanks for your input!
---
And when you're done with the Burrows itself, the area is a great place for violet flux
---
Don‚Äôt talk about it in game you could get banned and use clean language please.
---
I get the Charlestown Land fill with the copper resource
---
Kinda agree here, my gf is a lvl 55 and she plays the game very differently than I or most here, her build is everywhere, and she has random weapons and armor, she would be lucky to beat the burrows solo without dying 6 or 7 times. She really liked the burrows. That being said, she spends more time looking for decorations and picking blackberries than anything else in this game lol.
---
Ah I did not know that. I dont run PA except for nuke zones and the queen
---
Just try again you can go back. It's like farming whitesprings or West Tek.
---
Yeah, that's a Fallout Classic for sure.
---
Can get PA plans and apparently BOS armor plans.
---
I know of the workshops and stuff. Just trying to avoid having to manage one if I can lol
---
The Burrows is difficult with respect to the other "difficult" scenario in the game - running a missile silo.  Which is pretty trivial once you reach a certain point, but at Lv. 50?  I'd wager that *most* players will struggle with it.  Especially if they don't have good loadouts or Legendaries.
---
The thing that strikes me most about the Burrows is the disconnect between the visuals and design of the area and the rather bland quest itself, and this is something that comes up in 76 frequently - quests that are not worthy of the environments they take place in.  Why is all of this here when you've given me little reason to interact with it?  Maybe I'm just an adherent of holistic design - where I believe everything should have a purpose and a reason or else it shouldn't exist - but areas like the Burrows kind of frustrate me for how they flaunt a good looking environment and do nothing interesting with it.
---
By buying i mean caps, not atomic. So it would not be that much of P2W.
---
most detailed and easily followable, i'll write these down, thanks for the input üëç
---
Interesting idea for sure but, I can confirm that all of those recipes have been in the game for quite a while.  I started playing in late December and found them fairly early on.  No idea what they do but, I am definitely interested to see if you can find out anything else.
---
Well I have radicool and I plan to get get +5 str from that. I usually always keep around 10 boiled or purified water on me and keep the rest in my stash. Im probably going to switch something so I can get the dog food perk. And I already have tons of junk and am going to switch characters her soon probably and transfer what I have now to the new character. I only keep around 15 stims on me at a time and have the rest in my stash
---
The burrows weren't an update?
---
i have rank 1 from the each heavy gunner perk and i get to 77 damage with my .50 machine gun lol.     829 is insane lol. the most damage i can deal is around 380 with all rise.
---
A dungeon would be "Like a cave" uhhhh did you forget about the labyrinthian? Maybe every ancient nord dungeon in skyrim? Your point is invalid
---
I know. Im just saying, can we even anticipate that it will be a raid? I dont think they are using this terminology correctly, as evidenced by The Burrows.
---
You need a mule my guy. If you got a homie have him help you, if you don‚Äôt have a homie I would be willing to join you to help you transfer. I promise not to rob you.
---
The "Leader of the Pack" event is great for finding canines - approx. 15-20 spawn throughout its duration, and you also get the chance to pick up low-level legendaries through it
---
Wonderful :-). Time to install fo76 on my Mac for the weekend then. Don't want to miss out!
---
the sentry bot from the fallout 4 has a slighly bigger head but is very accurate and mothman from the new line looks like he does in game maybe slightly chibi
---
I collect tons of plans from workshops and more rare location specific plans. I just recently started farming treasure maps and have collected a bunch of plans I hadn‚Äôt previously found in over 600hrs in the game. So I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre trying to collect as many plans as possible, yes, also hint treasure maps
---
I'm mostly just going about it from the perspective of my tinfoil hat wearing crazy guy character I cooked up, but I figured I'd share anything interesting or of note.
---
Not quite?
---
Armor like Marine for instance is 'expensive' to craft and the odds of learning a mod by scrapping are only marginally better than the Radium and definitely much lower than any weapon other than the Radium.
---
You also can get - depending on the region - other 'costly' weapons like Ultracite Laser for instance.
---
Moreover you do get 'rare' chems like Calmex, Psychobuff/tats etc, mods and plans, lots and lots of plans.
---
I understand that this is less 'exciting' since the devs decided to make most plans available at vendors but IMO still has 'value'.
---
So all in all I would say they are a pretty nifty thing.
---
Hmmm....
---
* Have to craft film now
---
* No mention of increasing storage for pictures on consoles
---
* Can't be in any of the shots since you're holding the camera, looking through it
---
Sounds awesome.  Super thrilled they still set the weekly/daily quests to require the camera even though they've known for a while now that it wouldn't release yesterday.
---
Good call. Im console pleb. So I have to check in haha
---
I don't think it is the design players are having an issue with. It's by far a great looking dungeon. It's the challenge that rightfully deserves all the criticism. It honestly shouldn't be too hard to beef up the enemies on their end. I've have more of a challenge dealing with the super mutant camp at the church.
---
I personally don't care about the loot at this point. I already have the end game weapons and gear I need. I just want to have a fun, challenging experience. Throw in a Deathclaw or something.
---
I‚Äôd be willing to help you for a few minutes if you‚Äôre on Xbox. Promise not to rob you lol
---
It was only supposed to pop up once I thought.. Fix it
---
I'm 155. I ran it a few more times and got 2 1* ghouls but nothing special. My RNG must suck lol
---
Same here. And they‚Äôve already said you won‚Äôt be able to do as much with the camera as you already can in photo mode.
---
No, I complain about humans.
---
Servers were never taken down. There was no update to download. Hence, there were no bug fixes to download.
---
Y know, i only have stuff below 3 digits and i run out of them veryyyy often. I also needed to throw away massive amount of legendary stuff that i was planning to sell once the legendary vendor came by.  It was not that much of a deal at lower levels, but as i come by better mods, weapons and melee, i just need to have more resources ready to use. Any company that has produced successful games in the past may never (in my eyes) complain about servers. There is no way that they cannot upgrade server enough to maybe hold 2k items per person per lobby.
---
I'm not ignoring what Bethesda said. What did you expect them to say about this area? 
---
First, it's for players 2 players 50+, but also soloable. The higher the level, the less of a challenge it's going to be naturally. When I went through it, I was the lowest level person at 101. Everyone else was between 130-180. Everyone in PA, save one person, who was using TSE weapon to kill everything. 
---
So the most complaints about it, it's coming from players who have basically outleveled everything possible in the game, and are bored. 
---
This new area wasn't even mentioned in the Roadmap. So it wasn't even really a main focus of what they wanted to add. Because so far, i've noticed that a lot of the new content is coming with new things that they aren't talking about. You could think of them as surprise content. 
---
What's hilarious is that while telling me to not ignore what Bethesda said about the new area, you ignored half of what I said, which changes what my point.
---
That what Bethesda said, and what people made up about it before it came out are often unrelated. Plus, how should have Bethesda talked about the new stuff? They shouldn't have been enthusiastic?
---
No I‚Äôm english
---
I hate the pro- Bethesda hive mind around here. Most subs have no problem calling the devs out when they screw up, but here it‚Äôs karma suicide.
---
I got lucky when I did it. I was the first one there, and it was a PvP server. I only had 2 guy's try and jump me (which was awesome!!).
---
Went back on my melee character in PVE and it was so full you couldn't even experience what was there.
---
Seeing it untouched was magic. Yes the magic only lasted 10 minutes, but it was there.
---
what level are you, and what gear and what are you main perks?
---
I‚Äôm level 132, I definitely struggled with The Burrows a bit. (I fucked up my character okay? He‚Äôs extremely weak)
---
Go back to your cave troll
---
! Do you think they would scrap photo mode and make us craft film every time we want a picture? Could you imagine! I wish I hadn‚Äôt thought of that
---
we definitely need stuff like that!
---
id recommend keeping the more wanted ones, and scrapping all the ones you know are trash.. or selling the trash ones. when player vending comes out cram them into the machine
---
Bunker Buster: "hold my coffee"
---
drop server when you see it happening
---
Someone on the reddit discord had a great idea :  just add a few max level glowing Yao Gui into the burrows , like 4 in each area and watch the fun begin :P
---
Especially the Enclave
---
Never really thought of that. Thank you for the perspective
---
I laughed at that. Good job using the 2 brain cells you have!
---
No worries, I got an Xbox too :p you're no pleb :D
---
Just suggestions. 
---
As a low health build, Serendipity in LCK is the best survival perk you can have, may want to work it into your build? It would more than replace evasive in AGI. For low health builds, damage mitigation &gt; damage resistance.
---
In PER, you may want to drop Longshot to 2*, for 1* in Concentrated fire, which allows you to target limbs to complement the LCK perk, and to allow for headshots.
---
In AGI, at least 1* Gun Fu will add dmg and auto VATS target the next mob after each kill. You're going to need it for ghoul swarms.
---
Without Gunsmith in INT, you're going to be repairing your weapons, **a lot**. It's one of the best qol perks for riflemen.
---
With high luck, you'll be filling your crit meter in 1-3 shots, but at least 1* in Four Leaf Clover(?) helps with each hit having a chance to fill it.
---
They were the lore for 76 is actaully really good. But alas it's the internet and people never know what they are bitching about.
---
If they are set in / structured like Vaults in previous games, you would hope that means they would be a good length and potentially for different mechanics based on different experiments. 
---
If they are billed for 4 players with proper instancing, you'd hope that they would be difficult enough to justify 4 people properly cooperating.
---
Only time will tell though. Bethesda's track record is.. A little wonky.
---
Having at least 2 is why I don't think this is funny...
---
I'd love Bethesda to announce a week before the vendor is due that only Legendary gear found 'after' the patch will be able to be broken down.  That would make my day pretty much complete.
---
It's levelled. You can't do it at the start. Thats end game. All MMO and similar work that way. Idiot.
---
People seem to have already forgotten about repair kits.
---
I'm going to do this right effing now. I need to know the Burrows has a redeeming quality
---
unless i've inadvertantly swapped out the dog food perk,its been nerfed
---
Yeah, I don't get it either.  They seem excited about it but I can't figure out what use I'd get out of it.
---
Weird that you didn't get any ghouls even with other people there. I had another group in front of me and had ghouls respawn in my face several times, plus the ones you can manually spawn by turning the valves.
---
I'm not disputing that it was / was not too easy. I haven't done it yet, probably wont for some time but when I do get round to doing it (assuming its not Nuked) I'll probably find it easy as well.
---
I'm just pointing out that the people who post here do not represent a majority of the player base, as much as they would like to think that they do, and are not the players that the game is balanced around.
---
Definitely. I was unkillable PvE from january till like march, and then suddenly being surrounded by four ghouls changed from waiting until mutations kill them to being killed yourself. I liked that.
---
It's a joke to call that a dungeon.
---
It's a joke to state that "if you manage to get through it you will receive plenty of xp and loot" 
---
It's a joke to say that it's designed for 2 level 50+
---
Note the "+"  - and to state that brave solo players might pull it off and if they can will be rewarded.
---
It's just a joke.
---
This is the content the atom store is funding?
---
Think back to precious fallouts- and think of what the price of a power armor skin in Fallout 76 could buy you dlc wise in fallout 4.
---
Think Nuka World - Think Far Harbour.
---
Kissing their ass should not be an option here - its important we help shape the path of future content for this game and to tell them this is acceptable and what we want is not the way forward to ultimately have an amazing game.
---
Instead - we should be saying.
---
Bethesda - what the hell is this? Where is all the loot you were referencing - where is the challenge you referenced? Why did we have to wait this long for a 10 minute dungeon.
---
Let's not even justify it by calling it a dungeon - it's a side quest at best and if it was stated as such then fair enough.
---
This was supposed to be something completly new  - but it isn't- its more of the same,and let's all be honest - the "same" is not engaging in any way.
---
Your players want a challenge, so challenge them - not with a bullet sponge, but with engaging content.
---
I have a post going up soon outlining what I think would have been acceptable and hopefully maybe someone from Bethesda might read and even pass it along and perhaps in future one or two of these ideas might be implemented and I'll feel like I actually contrabuted to bettering the game in some small way by not being afraid to voice my concerns rather than saying "great job devs - keep up the stellar work and don't listen to the haters" 
---
And no doubt I will now be somehow classed as a hater for simply wanting a game I have spent many hours enjoying to be an even better game and grow in a direction that will continue to appeal to its player base for years to come. If that's the case then so be it.
---
&gt;but if you want raid tier difficulty content then wait for the damn vaults to open.
---
It still amazes me it's 6 months in and still nothing. That's like Destiny 2 releasing and six months in still no raids.
---
Mines still been working fine!
---
Well would ya look who it is!
---
Is it like level 230s complaining it's not hard enough? Put down the controller and get some sunlight.
---
Sorry I'm on PC otherwise I'd be happy to, noeadays it's not easy to find people whom you can talk to peacefully even having different povs
---
&gt;Why are they selling us an idea that‚Äôs already in the game?
---
They aren't selling us anything. You don't like it, don't use it. Yuo're not paying anything for it.
---
"chose to get op"
---
please explain.
---
you level up, you choose perks, you get weapon/armor drops.
---
do you actually choose to throw a way any good weapons you get? do you not kill enemies so you wont level up?
---
do you not choose perk cards that accentuate the weapon type you chose to use?
---
i really dont understand this line of reasoning.  its a looter/shooter game, you level up and get better gear, repeat
---
ah forget it, im tired of people today
---
Someone I know lost a TSE Handmade on a server disconnect. They had it for a long time prior to that, so not a recent acquisition.
---
What? No, the opposite. The amount of legendaries that spawn there is on par with what you can get from Whitespring. That's why the thought occurred to me in the first place.
---
Sorry to hear. Fallout is a great escape and hopefully you see your daughter as often as possible.
---
It is not hard, it just public event.  People don't like investing time into public events, while there are freeloaders, this mean people don't care about co-operating with each other. Make it private event, instanced out and give it 30 minute length journey with actual rewards, not some bs rng. People will start making premade groups, with specialized builds for different purposes and they will beat it without any problems.
---
The downside with PA is that just like in fallout 4, anything that uses AP, like vats, drains fusioncores like crazy. I personally have no problem to make room for booth thru hiker and traveling pharmacy and still oneshotting most things in the game. Not all that fast though since i dont sprint ;)
---
OMG would love this!
---
I mean 3 monsters we have seen everyday between silo launches and whitesprings farming (Ghouls,gutsys and assaultrons. What a twist. Would have been cooler to just throw all the infected charred nude animals we fight during a broodmother battle. No amphibious creatures what so ever down there. All the ghouls in gordans fisherman outfits would have been a step up from what they went with.
---
  I don't see how anyone thinks that place was lore rich. ONE store with a computer that says we sniff glue,2 holo tapes and a semi interesting throne room that looks like someones first go at building. I guess the tape did essentially explain it. But in a kiddie pool kind of  fashion.
---
Value is subjective. 
---
For me, I enjoy figuring out where there are in the world. I don‚Äôt look them up.
---
If that‚Äôs not your thing, look up the locations and dig up a few. I‚Äôve heard that the higher the level you are the better stuff. I‚Äôve gotten plans that I wanted that way. 
---
If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it after digging up a few, then you‚Äôll know.
---
Did whitespring runs last weekend and all of them where successful, on monday out of 10 times, 5 times there were no ghouls at all and 2/3 times there were only lv9-lv14 ghouls. Have no idea what's happening there..
---
Sounds like a personal problem
---
ok, they said it was made for 2 lvl 50 players
---
im well below level 50 and i solo'd it no problem
---
Heck, I'm a dedicated PA user, which basically means I get shafted in end game builds.  
---
I do it because I like playing as a PA enclave trooper, but I know its never going to be competitive at all... Same with scout armor.
---
Never understood why anyone would align themselves with the Brotherhood of Steal, permanently I mean, they seem to care more about control than helping the people. Tech hoarders.  
---
I always preferred the Institute, science has done far more for humanity than any military faction.
---
So what you're saying is we need to do a run as level 20's in a full INT build with laser pistols and only Scribe outfits?  That actually sounds like it might be fun.
---
Yes please drop all the nukes on it! Harpers ferry is across the river from my house so its be awesome. Also, do you think you could get tanagra town in the blast zone? Theres a deathclaw and hermit crab and a mob of crickets and I just wanna see what happens. If nobody gets to it I'll try to launch a nuke myself later today.
---
Good luck buddy, hope things will get better one day
---
I don't know why someone downvoted you... You are right.
---
You sound like the kind of moron who uses "libtard" and doesn't understand sarcasm.
---
Im probably part of the people who when they are being told they will have dungeons, see "mmo style" dungeons.
---
You know, (very) hard to solo if not impossible regardless of level and gear, a bit of exploration, killng trash mobs in the way then finding a boss room, then more trash mobs after it while progressing further. Another boss room, a final trash mob pack on the last stretch maybe even a gauntlet style room and finally a final **unique** boss harder than the previous 2. With a set loot pool of uniques legendary gear specific to this dungeon only.
---
I Don't think that in a multiplayer centric game like 76 people expecting the mmo version of a dungeon was too far fetched, especially when its been advertised as such.
---
You just revealed how little you know about development of F076. Game uses Fallout 4 assets and same engine with just minor improvements. Dedicated modding team would have done better sequel, but Bethesda isn't supporting such modding atm. FO76 has been created as cheap as possible with big hype and try to cash out people, because they loved previous parts. 
---
You should stop dreaming that most of the players "here are enjoying" the game. Most of the players left this game after 2 weeks of release and playerbase is decreasing day by day. Those people who actually are real gamers are still following game development of FO76 and testing how new updates change the game but again they find it disappointing.
---
From the developers perspective this game is also a disaster. 2-3 competent developers could have created more content and proper fixes to game in short time, but Bethesda has failed to do any fixes or content in 6 months. There is still no end game content worth to mention and old bugs are still in the game, because they fail to use version contol in Bethesda. That pretty much tells how incompetent their FO76 developing team currently is.
---
Oh, fair enough then
---
Well to be fair, its either that or buffing everything (including the mobs) to get things balanced....
---
I feel that if they created this, people would cry out about the ‚Äúbullet sponge‚Äù enemies. 
---
You could try nerfing yourself.  Change your play style to make the game challenging.
---
TAAKEEE ME HOMEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I just want mutations to change your appearance in some way. In a interview they said some of them did but I guess that was a lie.
---
Who said Imposter was too hard? It was easy as hell, just F76 playerbase is made of idiots, who didn't even get obvious thing, like there is 3 pylons so probably you have to do something with them.
---
I feel the need to create a character for Al Gore and get him a cape purely to raise awareness about this dangerous creature. 'It's super... super... cereal.'
---
Crazy shit, haha.
---
...to piggyback on that idea, if you don‚Äôt know which are ‚Äúmore wanted‚Äù, post your list of mods and folks can advise.
---
I'm not sure I see a problem with daily login rewards if the login rewards are indeed cosmetic...
---
especially when they quit 5 minutes into the game because mommy isnt holding their hands and telling them exactly what to do in an open world game
---
"loyal players" pft. Speak for yourself man. I was expecting this to be *something* the fans had repeatedly asked for. One of the things we "loyal players" have asked for is a place other than Whitesprings that is worth nuking and they gave it to us. Maybe it would have been better if they had said this out loud to manage our expectations better, but then it would spoil the surprise of learning it for yourself. "Hm, ok, lots of legendaries but no exciting boss. Hey, you know what? I should nuke this place!" That's a lot more fun honestly.
---
I'm interested but what are the other three traits?
---
I'm not a huge fan, but I am subscribed, he seems rather bland a lot of the time, but the content is pretty solid (though mostly about 1 thing).
---
He was absolutely beside himself about this area (as much as he can be anyway).  He was really hyped about the contents, especially with people coming in and respawning the mobs over and over.  He was like a kid in a candy shop.
---
While I don't necessarily *believe* this, I wonder if nuking this area was part of the plan.  Nukes really are the 'end game' at this point, and that area seems almost perfectly set up for nuking.
---
you were saying that Harper's Ferry is going to be a hazmat only zone for a while
---
im thinking its closer to 9 on atom shop, 2 on new game content, 1 on bug fixes
---
I posted this a few days ago.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bd83lu/an_experiment_with_treasure_maps/
---
id love to see it if the camera gave you a special hidden perk with each picture you take. +5% EXP on that specific enemy type. so example, you take a photo of a glowing one ghoul, killing those ones from now on give +5% more EXP. but killing any other ghoul would not. not unless you took a photo of them as well
---
I feel like I'm the only one, but I use melee and guns and feel like they're not that crazy imbalanced. With 15 luck, once I factor in the crits + headshots, even my dumb pistols get the job done. Granted if I had 25 str, it'd be a different story.
---
You really need to re-read the thread, and what YOU said, because you look really fucking dumb right now.
---
I never even bought F076 and I still enjoy Country roads. Never heard the song until the announcement trailer. And to add to that I rarely like/tolerate Country music.
---
And yet I hear it, I enjoy it, and I always think of Fallout When I hear it.  Bethesda has always been good with music choices for fallout imo.
---
xx420Dxx
---
That's sad to hear man. Hope you're doing ok. You're right though, the fallout community is awesome üëç
---
Most are duds. Some are great and drop a rare plan. It's the plans you're really after with them. Everything else can be found elsewhere more easily. Unfortunately for the rarer plans you need to dig up a TON of maps. Hundreds.
---
I'm unironically in favor of this
---
why do you feel the need to call people names and be rude? you posted on this just to insult someone?
---
who needs attention then Tybber?
---
That was the first thing I thought as I went through it last night. First thought: "What is everyone whining about? There are tons of legendaries here!" Second thought: "I should nuke this place, it's probably just as good as the Whitespring!!! Hey, they gave us what we asked for, nice!"
---
but you got to pay the troll to toll to get into the boy's hole
---
The quality of what you get from maps depends upon your luck. I‚Äôve tested this to near confirmation. Boost your luck with food, chems, perks, alcohol, and gear or sell to someone who will. The high-luck drops can include valuable plans, but it‚Äôs still RNG.
---
Is you cpu,gpu or ram overclocked and/or set to the right speed and timings? It sounds like a lot of your issues may be network related have you done any diagnostics on your internet? Also the taking damage while walking isn't a glitch, there are little "mines" around the map, they are like exploding bug eggs. If you walk around using vats you can target them sometimes.
---
*especially the Brotherhood
---
Bethesda's sound physics (or whatever you wanna call it) has never been that amazing
---
Treasure maps are one of the only valuable things in the game since you get rare plans from them occasionally.
---
Clearing out a building of enemy and the song comes on..
---
Me: Ok enemy, you have a few more moments to live, i need to listen here first...
---
Ok how does this look?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f138de&amp;d=cu2eu0pd2pk2pl2pp2pr1a03ar1ao0an2l71lu2lt2s01li1la2a51p00a30lr0ic4ir2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2c3
---
I encountered a ton of legendaries also if u nuke Harper's ferry it effect the burrows and becomes better then white springs.
---
Absolutely not. It could cause young people to start smoking cos they are doing it in a videogame. Instead they should only focus on drinking alcohol, get wrecked, and take some dr\*\*, sorry, aid pills right after.
---
Why does this community get so mad about people having their own opinions?
---
I mean, have you seen their Vertibird pilots?!?
---
Good luck. Been there myself.
---
Sure wish we had mods like you.
---
Honestly, Sniper is useless in VATS, which would also negate Better Criticals in LCK.
---
50% limb damage, +50 damage resistance  while aiming,  does more damage the lower your health gets.
---
Depends on the mod and your build.   Scope mods are always good for snipers.
---
Some of the melee weapon mods are quite helpful - barbed/spiked baseball bat/walking cane, serrated blade on a machete or switchblade....
---
You can always craft for yourself until it outlives its usefulness, then give it to a lower level player.  I've done that more than once....
---
Pleasure.
---
No because photo mode pictures posted to social media are free game advertising.
---
I went there this morning for a look around, I didn‚Äôt find any new notes or holotapes but there‚Äôs now a brewing station in the basement that wasn‚Äôt there before Biv‚Äôs quest dropped
---
I may have swapped it out for something I need more.
---
my specials are A LOT different from yours apart from end.
---
still rifles,but a little of everything else apart from auto's.still got to swap out this and that depending on situation and time
---
cheers
---
Strange things are afoot at the Morgantown Airport.
---
tbh, that would be annoying as fuck, but would not be a horrible idea. it would prevent people from making TSE weapons even more broken. And I can always just sell the legendaries to players or vendor bots for caps.
---
The fire bases will take down a scorchbeast in about a minute, I stumbled in this revelation by accident in the cranberry bog. Running from a scorchbeast then ran into a wendigo and a couple of robobrains, my last ditch attempt at surviving was to repair the launchers and then all was fire, a few seconds later I sneak out of the tent I was hiding in to a load of fresh corpses and some lovely loot. Did all my Enclave ranks this way lol
---
&gt;Never understood why anyone would align themselves with the Brotherhood of Steal, permanently I mean, they seem to care more about control than helping the people.
---
Yeah, especially by the point of Fallout 4 the BoS is kind of an obvious stand in for fascism, and-
---
&gt;I always preferred the Institute, science has done far more for humanity than any military faction.
---
Wait a sec, you know they want to commit genocide on those above ground, right?
---
I was just gonna post about this-- i too found this up in the toxic valley, next to Hemlock Holes on the road.  I was thinking this was different from the ISS because because that brahmin was clearly eaten. Glad someone else noticed this-- wonder what the trigger will be.
---
Your camp still needs to load in for 1 minute but the travel times are realy short.
---
Exactly
---
yeah, it got sort of replaced with the +50% limb damage secondary prefix from what i have seen
---
That's actually not bad, especially if you use heavy weapons perk thag makes weapons weigh 90% less.
---
I'd probably have 100 more levels if the loading times didnt take so long lol
---
i do hear you about the end game ready people not being the majority, I remember from Destiny 2 PS4 trophy info, only like 4% of ALL players of Destiny 2 had completed raids, which BLEW MY MIND as it was the end game content that i aspired to reach, and only a  tiny fraction even attempted or beat a raid
---
I had this problem yesterday. Lost all my fast travel caps too. Game shut down after putting me where I wanted. Reloaded and I was back to the original spot.
---
It's a shame we can't get a greenman suit in game
---
I thought of this with friends where your screen goes red it says "you feel a lasting hunger" you die and a wendigo spawns where you where
---
I remember something being said that it depends on luck and perception
---
They have a slight overclock yeah. It‚Äôs not my network. 76 is the only game with any issues. I can‚Äôt verify the bug egg thing but I‚Äôll look into it if and when I get back on.
---
Lmao this game is so bad you guys are literally telling yourselves to lower expectations indefinitely
---
Seriously? You can't see how stupid it is to make a post about how you think there's 12 people working on this game? 
---
The whole post is rude and insulting. You just think it isn't because it's about a game company, and you think that it's not aimed at anyone particular. But it is.
---
So it's a stupid thing to say, because it's clearly not true. It's stupid because it's attacking people and insulting them, while hiding behind the whole, it's a Company, they can take it. 
---
You want to hate on the game and Bethesda, and defend all that do. Because it makes you feel good to be that kind of person.
---
And when this kind of stupidity gets called out, you get bent out of shape. That's a sad way to live.
---
It was my first place I nuked way back at launch. It was meh.
---
I really hate what they turned the BoS into in Fallout 4. They basically turned them into steampunk-y Nazis bent on eradicating their enemies. 
---
I loved them in FO3 and the splinter faction they had. They actually helped people in that game and had interesting power struggles and philosophies. 
---
It could have just been lazy writing for FO4, I was pretty bummed out that you couldn‚Äôt finish the game with factions allying together. Like you could in Farharbor. 
---
I also don‚Äôt know much about the earlier games/lore so I could be completely wrong.
---
I think they are new! Heading there
---
how?
---
No, the burrows were added last week, just didn‚Äôt turn on until yesterday. Like Fasnacht, the event was added in a patch a few days before it could be done with a time gate.
---
Shut up libtard
---
except the person you responded to wasn't replacing your argument with anything. Your wording is absolute shit so they, like ANOTHER person here, thought you were saying you didn't WANT instances. Then they told you that you need to work on your grammar. Maybe you should just go back to english class in general, because you type with the english comprehension of a third grader at best.
---
sorry that happened to you~
---
id like the notification that your camp was being attacked to be very large on screen, flashing in red, and accompanied bya  distinct unique alert sound so you cant miss it
---
You can hear Biv?
---
I can barely understand him when I'm standing next to him.  Had to turn on subtitles.
---
AMEN
---
So punished sounds abit spiteful but I couldn't think of a better word to describe it. I doubt the devs go out of thier way to not provide content for geared players. I don't really see why it always having been God mode = end game and zero challenge means that this game needs to follow suit.
---
The games progression system has logical end points, there's variables you can account for such as perk cards, Mutations and gear. If you can account for these variable you can predict the sort of high end build damage that player's will dish out. Knowing this should allow a team of developers to create a variety of different enemies or modifiers to existing opponents that challenge players in new ways.
---
My main gripe is the idea difficulty is only achievable through high numbers of opponents or ones with huge hp pools.
---
Stuff like the assultron already has this variety due to the stealth mechanic, making it challenging for vats builds. Why couldn't this be applied across the bored, borderlands has a shield system that you need to match damage types to overcome, forcing players to carry different gear and abilities depending on the situation. 100% of encounters in fallout 76 can be solved with the application of enough brute force meaning players arnt incentivised to use different methods.
---
Making opponents like the sheepsquatch is a step in the right direction, as well in fallout new Vegas they introduced the holograms that could not be harmed unless you found thier emitter, why not have similar mechanics here? 
---
Difficulty doesn't have to be tied to stats, I'd argue its far more satisfying having it tied to mechanics that force players to think and adapt their behaviour to overcome.
---
Tbh when I say harder I mean more bosses for the larger dungeons. One boss after all those ghouls was alright for a quick solo dungeon run.
---
Ill help you move your stuff to another character my kids character is lvl 10 lol tryna rank him up and get him gear!
---
They came with the Laying Lowe patch on the 9th. They've been there, and give you mounted head plans
---
Sure!
---
It's "NotTakingYourBaitNiceTryTho"
---
I have a PS4 Pro with a solid state drive and it definitely improves the performance.  Before I got my Pro I played FO76 on my original launch PS4 so I had a good basis for comparison.
---
I really dig the Enclave bunker. I mourn its lack of content (stuff to do in there other than sell or repair or get nuclear key card quest) but it's really neato. I love the bunker. Modus is so creepy. I'd love to hold an event in there, nothing but Enclave uniform wearing Enclavers
---
I agree. Seems like people are losing their shit over it... but it wasn‚Äôt even on the roadmap. Kind of a bonus in my eyes.
---
Auction house bad, it ruins the magic of finding traders and face to face dealing
---
It ruined the magic of trading on Runescape that‚Äôs for sure. Ah how I miss the days...
---
**BANK SALE**
---
**Selling rune scimmy 30k**
---
you are the sad one here Tybber, its a video game, calm down and stop being so rude to people
---
and stalked you? are you insane? ive only responded to you once  on this thread, maybe you are getting things confused
---
so again i suggest you step away from the keyboard for a bit, take a nap, eat a sandwich, then maybe you can post without insulting other poeple
---
thats been happening for a while. Now i've got 3 68mutties real close,before my camps even up. its a rob peter to pay paul thing.
---
once your up and running it's much smoother than it was.
---
PVP in this game is probably the worst ever, so unless they rebalance the game from the ground up, it will continue to suck as hard as survival does
---
This is apologist blameshifting at its absolute worst.
---
"It's not the developer's fault, it is the players' fault!"
---
What an absolute crock of shit. Stop defending blatant misadvertising as "just marketing", and start expecting some sort of accountability from your developers.
---
I have two AA  1* for the vendors maybe I will get AAE lolol

VATs in general was acting clunky yesterday
---
There are people who join the military and/or the police force for no reason other than to have control over others and to wear a hot uniform and look badass and wield a gun. It's no different in the video game world. People want to be BOS because AD VICTORIUM and vertibirds and power armor and all that jazz. It looked pretty slick in F04. I dont like the BOS myself. I always end up siding with the Institute and killing FATHER and then making the commonwealth a better place by killing feral ghouls all over the place
---
Dont play with fire if you dont want to get burned.
---
Yeah, noticed that after the post.  Interesting that it's not legendary, but also not scrappable.  Either way, sold it, freed up 13 lbs :)
---
13 lbs is 5.9 kg
---
The one thing they dont have is a QA department, given the bugs they let seep in updates. (no hyperbole)
---
Yeah. I enjoyed it myself.
---
If u are using a dragon u def need the speed demon mutation
---
This stuff... I see it in every game, but it's buisness they can't say guys we have a boring dungeon with just 5 enemys hope u can survive it, next half year u get nothing more be OK with this 5 min dungeon. What a shame to this time look at anthem what a Roadmap where u think oh man what for content they have..... But it's nothing just hot air..  The gamers who play for 20 years+ I'm one of it know some diamonds and they have seen the most what u get in games and the game quality goes down the hill pretty fast. U get bugs over bugs over bugs and on top pretty no content to do or bad design. But people pre-order and get hyped to hell just to get disappointed. It's All about money they have it already so why they should do more as a 5 min dungeon? It will cost more for what? People will cry whatever they do. Wrong grammar is yours while it's not my nativ and y down vote me for the true
---
I do apologise for having a dense moment but I still don't see how  'Harper's Ferry is going to be a 'Hazmat Suit/PA only' zone for a while' relates to not needing a hazmat suit in The Burrows.
---
Moreover in the context of helpfully having a Free States robot in The Whitesprings now which means that one does not need to go to Harper's Ferry to interact with that particular faction thus avoiding the hassle if the area is nuked which is what my post referred to.
---
Other than 'I really really want to point out the fact that The Burrows do not get irradiated in the case of nuking Harper's Ferry regardless of what the originall post is about' I still don't know how both things 'come together' (so to speak).
---
A lot of people have been asking for a nuke site that is just as good as the Whitespring but something else. That's what this is.
---
It is a high level dungeon, if you consider level 50 high level. The ghouls are level 62. If you don't know what you're doing at level 50 you can get your ass whupped good and proper.
---
Although, people who have been fighting the SBQ for a while realize that level 90 is really "high level" in this game, and people who are able to meaningfully contribute to the SBQ fight will have absolutely no problem melting through the burrows solo. So there's a fundamental mismatch between what Bethesda's marketing team considers "wow super tough high level dungeon" and what the community actually perceives when it plays it. 
---
Nevertheless, for those 90+ level players Bethesda has given us a decent nuke site, so whatever.
---
The vaults better be tougher though. Some mechanics would be nice too.
---
Go with all the content combined. Biv is cute at first and what we want. But it is a 5 minute daily. The new scooby doo chain is almost perfect. But i know a few people including myself with a botched squach fight. Nobody wants to bust out 2k caps to have a chance that people might not show up and you will fail again. This dungeon was quicker than biv's starting chain. Many of us finished it in hopes that we were getting to the dungeon and not just getting through it on accident. I don't min max i just play for fun. All-rise and an x-1 got me through it all and i was never in trouble.
---
There is nothing here i can tell people about that have quit to come back for. Its fucking embarrassing to tell them about all this new content and stability and then have it be some cheap knockoff. Hell maybe their biggest success is the pvp. But on a list of 20 people only 1 wanted that.   A few times again i have taken over workshops and servers hiccuped. It's just like how the fuck am i suppose to play this anymore. I can't even pretend my friends are gonna come back or things are going forward and im not just sitting in a shit pot stew. Even if these vaults are twice the content this dungeon was i feel like were gonna get dc's every 10 minutes and they are just gonna increase the size of like 2-3 monsters name them elites and call it a day.  I loved the game up till my first character reached 80 something. But i can find no fun or faith in it to give anymore. Hell at least with 4 i can buy building packs / download mods and have thousands of unique items with near limitless build space to fill the void till the next experiment.
---
Great, another armchair developer telling everyone how incompetent the company is and how they would have done it.
---
Bethesda, you guys should just hire this guy and put him in charge.  Fire Todd.  This guy would whip this game right into shape in a couple of months:  bugs addressed and new content storyboarded, developed, implemented, and tested across 3 platforms and a multitude of players. Oh, and the content has sound game design, is balanced for casuals but still challenging for power gamers, and is engaging across all 4 of the game player types.  Cause this shit has to be easy right?  
---
Anyways, you've sidestepped my entire response, who gets Fallout? Oh wait, you did answer me:  you do.  Get the capital together and pitch buying the IP from Bethesda and let's see your Fallout 5. 
---
Let me know when it comes out.
---
 "to figure out what all of their time is actually going towards"
---
ATOM store
---
Weird. I'll have to try it out later and see what it does
---
What platform? Im on xbox. I want plans for ultralight combat chest and limbs. Do you have those to sell?
---
I really don‚Äôt get the hate for it. I saw 5 3* legendaries on my one run through and took less than 10 minutes. I‚Äôd much rather jam repetitions and increase RNG chances than spend 30 minutes dropping a nuke and another 30 to maybe get one decent drop off the SBQ
---
I think a nuke strike had dissipated just before I logged in last night as the burrows was filled with bloated, glowing ghouls. I had quite a few good drops while in there, much better than I ever received during a nuke run of Whitespring. 
---
Personally I just enjoyed being in a new area of the map. I didn't have many expectations going in so I wasn't disappointed. I can't understand others frustration with it though.
---
This sounds worth keeping..real serious
---
but youv'e got long shot in- and your sniper......vats don't work AT ALL at long range, and if you NEED vats................
---
Junk shield increases your natural DR based on the amount of junk you have. What I'm proposing is a change to make the "starter armors" more viable for high level characters. That way, they become more useful for roleplaying purposes.
---
As if our screens are t already cluttered with UI ü§£
---
yep, that was gonna be my next question, will do that when  I log in next time üòä
---
The song is magical. It just has something to it that makes you smile. Regardless of being a cover , whenever I hear he song it makes my heart warm and my soul happy.
---
I'm a native WV resident, so the song has extra special meaning to me. I work in a growler station being the beer specialist for a small family chain. I have a small speaker that I play music through to try to make the experience as entertaining as possible.
---
There was one day where I was really busy, and there was a line of patiently waiting customers, just chatting the day away as they waited. Take Me Home, Country Roads came on, and I began to hum along to it. Eventually the customer I was serving at the time started singing it with me. After a couple seconds, the rest of the line of customers began to sing along, and all you heard in the store was (and the best way I can describe this) a choir of people singing country roads. We sang the entire song and it felt magical the entire time.
---
Once the song was over, we all laughed and celebrated. Now I can assure you that all of those people in line are now regulars at my growler, and we talk about that time almost every time they visit.
---
wow why so rude? who hurt you? i feel sorry for you
---
And yet, here you are still browsing the sub dedicated to something you dislike. I don't understand it
---
Talk about what?  Eating from the honey pot?
---
Oh bother.
---
&gt; It is astonishing how anyone in charge at Bethesda could have ever OKed this game.
---
Depending on what you mean by "OK" I think you may be contradicting yourself here - all you have at the "OK" stage *is* the potential. By your own argument the idea for Fallout 76 on paper is pretty good: the issues are in the execution (albeit some more fundamental execution issues that can't be easily patched over). What is astonishing is not so much that Bethesda OK'd the game for development but that they OK'd is *for release* instead of giving it another year of work.
---
thank you, I guess they will be sitting and waiting for player vending
---
At this point I just want an enclosed space with a perilous bridge full of radioactive battles over a insta-death chasm that the grinders can go to that just starts off spawning glowing ones in an unending hoard, starting at LV 50 and just going up from there.  
---
I want there to be a mob of 3* legendary enemies  just flooding the place, from both ends of the bridge, epic loot flying this way and that, but only seconds to snatch it from flying bodies up before they fly over the edge.  
---
There will be only two ways out of this dungeon:
---
If you die or disconnect, this is the only place you can respawn and keep your  stuff.  You can get the goods, but you can only get out by forfeiting all but 2 randomly chosen weapons from your inventory; The more you pick up, the less chance you‚Äôre getting out with that god tier weapon you came in with.  
---
The other method is the actual goal:
---
There will be a button, on the far end of the ledge, that stops enemies from spawning behind you for 30 seconds.  If your group can fight your way to it, and press that button, the gate behind you opens, and you have that long to clear a path through the door while the ever-tougher ghouls continue to pour onto the bridge. 
---
Your group can run for it, or try a fighting retreat to collect up whatever remains, but if you don‚Äôt make it out, the gate closes and you‚Äôll have to go back to the button... unless you‚Äôre going to leave a rearguard behind, of course, doomed to continue fighting alone until your runners can come back with a resupply and help them escape too.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt ever go there - I can‚Äôt even safely run through whitesprings without dying.  But I feel like that‚Äôs what people want.
---
Currently bug as of patch 8. Beth is aware so it's a waiting game on the fix.
---
Solid. 
---
If you pick up any BE rifles, you can always drop Gunsmith to 3 or 4, or pull 2 from PER/Longshot for 2 more in INT. At that point it's all about your preference.
---
I'm not sure if it's a sage decision to spend other money and buy an SSD, while the PS5 is going to be released next year already. An used unit for a few bucks would be nice.
---
with 1400 hours in to the game, been through each quest and side quest 4 or 5 times, so the only thing to do is farm an area
---
I see, thx m8
---
Random guess around 55 Gigs
---
I'm at work and going off memory, I was at around 52 gigs before the current patch hit.
---
Even in Kentucky when it comes on in a bar or live show some people tear up,  the other side of them big Hills is close enough to count.
---
Sorry, but if you are going to call someone sad over a video game you have to first accept that you are just as sad, because you literally doing the same thing. 
---
There's no difference between your comments about a video game and the people talking about it and your comments. Which is even sadder.
---
The Burrows alone is not content I think they meant ‚Ä¶
---
***NUKED BURROWS*** is a dangerous place. The glowing ghouls in that tight confined space is rough.
---
**Stealth sniper builds beware** There is nowhere to run.
---
Maybe they realized it was damn near a cheat code against a lot of enemies in fo4. It was hilarious to watch any of the massive enemies writhing around as you slowly beat them to death with a walking cane.
---
They overhyped it as a Multiplayer experience. The community ran with that an turned it into an instanced raid that was going to be our new source of endgame gear.
---
What else can you do as a fan of Fallout 76, though?
---
Fallout 76 feels like a total missed opportunity
---
So i may be simple, but how do you get the quest for biv? I went in at lvl 9 and nothing hapoens when i talk to biv. Is there something i need to do before that?
---
The original brotherhood is much closer to that of 4 then to the Lyion's brotherhood. "everyone knows how to make another human, but the secrets to making a P94 plasma rifle are all but lost". The best comparison is with the Outcasts in Fallout 3
---
Times change, leaders change, it's natural. In Fallout 3 they were white knights in atomic armors, they were the good ones, no doubt. In Fallout 4 they are much more gray, more interesting IMO
---
and watch people smoke IRL
---
Having multiple accounts is a great thing. It keeps people playing longer; and anyway we can facilitate that (making it easier to transfer items between accounts) is good for the lifespan of the game.
---
Yeah thats what i thought. But i only just realized it wasnt in game and thought id let yall know. And tbh im kinda glad its not there because it was really OP
---
I just found out how last night! It‚Äôs a lengthy process. 
---
You have to fast travel to vault 76, turn around to face it, then walk (not run) backwards from the vault all the way to the church in flat wood. Once you get in the door of the church, you can walk normally again. Speak to the responder bot and clear out all his aid items he sells. This will cost quite a bit of caps but it‚Äôs worth it. Once he‚Äôs out of aid items, he will leave his post and be attacked by a yao guai outside. You have to let the yao guai kill the bot, then follow him back to his cave. Be quick about it, he runs very fast and if you lose track of him you have to start all over. Inside his cave, you‚Äôll see four cubs. Here‚Äôs the tricky part, you have to kill all 4 cubs without hitting the yao guai once. It‚Äôs hard cause he attack‚Äôs you constantly while the cubs run and hide. If you manage to kill all four, the yao guai gets physically ill and throws up the plans for the keg. When you see the plans on the ground, DONT PICK THEM UP! Instead, launch a mini nuke or multiple grenades to kill your self on the spot. See, if you go to grab them, the yao guai one shots you and takes the plans back. But if you kill your self, the yao guai despawns and the plans stay in the cave. NOW you can safely get them and start building kegs!
---
The level design is amazing. I think if Bethesda beefs up the enemies in this dungeon they should wait till they launch at least a few more. If not you'll have a bunch of loot farmers just crowding this place. Spread them out sort of like ESO delves. Each with a mini boss.
---
I'm at level 33 and i'm still bored lol. I seen some people with 300+ levels......that's crazy!
---
Yeah but it's not the same studio that made the other fallout games
---
That's the main problem with sound. Direction and distance affects sound but sound penetrates through all walls and objects as if they were thin air. Thus we hear stuff 3 walls away as if it there were no walls. 
---
That pisses me off.
---
Read your first paragraph.
---
Now does that sound the least but fun? To anyone? Sad that that is what we expect from Bethesda.
---
Have you used their laser pistols? Trash.
---
Agreed.   Can barely hear him right next to him.   Volume all the way up too.
---
It wouldnt guarantee a 2 or 3 star drop, or an effect, or in most cases a specific weapon or armor type (since most enemies drop multiple types of weapons). Just a way to make it slightly easier to narrow down your chances.
---
In fallout 4 high level ghouls would fuck up paladins in my playthrough.
---
A level 250 player is not the average wastelander
---
They are not as soft as SBs. The only real creature I'll actively avoid as a melee fighter
---
Oh my God!!!
---
&gt;Some of the melee weapon mods are quite helpful - barbed/spiked baseball bat/walking cane, serrated blade on a machete or switchblade....
---
you mean that I can craft those type of modifications on my weapons only if I have those type of mods in my inventory? they are not something you learn from dismantling weapons?
---
I really thought survival mode was gunna be a challenge not PvP deathmatch. This new dungeon and survival mode were such missed opportunities.
---
I was thinking that myself, but then weren't there old holotapes and terminal entries that said Taggerdy pretty much conscripted people, like *anyone* who they could get their power-armoured hands on?
---
Scribe in the Burrows was probably like 12 years old and didn't know which end of the laser rifle to point at the ghouls xD
---
Some people play for fun not to raise mathematical drop rates of legendaries and to finish a damn dungeon in 10 minutes.
---
I ran Sniper when I started, and the extra 5sec or so for each* seemed a waste. Unless you truly can't easily free aim, everything will be dead before it ever became useful.
---
Longshot lets you sight kill outside aggro range for a lot of mobs. You take out 2-3 mobs, then VATS the rest as they close the distance. If you plan on PvP'ing. Everyone is stealthed already, so longer range/higher dmg dropoff &gt; VATS
---
Are there any other recent quests I'm missing? Maybe not from this patch but from the past couple.
---
I'd like to collect more of these mounted schematics.
---
BINGO BANGO BONGO IM SO HAPPY IN THE CONGO I REFUSE TO GOOoo
---
The 90% doesnt affect the mods of the weapons just the base weapon weight, so if you modded it down to base it would probably weight 0.5
---
Legit the best feeling. My first was in the glassed caverns. I just hit 76 SB kills a week ago. Free atoms!
---
My radio story: wandering around shortly after I got the game, I heard "Dark as a Dungeon" come on.  It was very strange, because as far as I knew, I'd never heard that song before, and yet it somehow resonated with me, and I knew that I knew it.  So I played it for my mom and asked her why I would know that song.  Turns out my grandmother played it on the guitar and sang it when I was little.  So , thanks, FO76, for giving me a reminder of my grandmother, she's been gone for 10+ years now and I still miss her.
---
Highest ive seen is 500+
---
Just curious. How does he typically react towards these sinners?
---
Just a rough estimate; I did poke around quite a bit looking for more lore and things to explore, and I spent a lot of time looking for a legendary corpse/meat pile to loot that disappeared on me.
---
I thought there was going to be more to do after the assaultron, so I figured I needed to trigger the next step of the quest, or the next quest. Nope, joke's on me.
---
You're welcome
---
Ruined my first playthrough finding a 10mm pistol with it early on.
---
Calibrated shocks for power armor are always wanted, due to most other leg mods being trash in the eyes of the community. if you have the weapon/armor a mod goes too you can check how well they impact it in the weapon/armor mod menu for that mod itself without actually installing it (simply by selecting it)
---
I'm level ~125, I got one lucky AAE pump action (I'm a sniper build) recently, and an instigating sniper a little while back (2 star).  Nothing else of much use, and I mostly farm.  I've gotten TONS of 3-star weapons, but nothing really useful at all except the above.
---
Not everyone can 'just get' better stuff easily, I agree.  One lucky drop, and you can go places to farm that most people can't, which opens up more lucky drops.
---
Note, I'm still playing this game. I'm not some random hater who never bought it and just wants to jump on the hate train.   
---
So off the top of my head:  
---
Promised the ability to build settlements with others. That's a lie. You can't build near someone else's base and your presence on the server is temporary so nothing you build stays beyond you logging out.
---
Promised the ability to sell goods and specialize in crafting. They specifically said that you could decide to just focus on making steaks and specialize in them. Set yourself up as the guy who makes and sells the best steaks on the server. Cooking doesn't work that way, player vending doesn't work that way, and food quality doesn't work that way.
---
There would be NO pay for play micro-transactions in the Atom Store. Only cosmetic items that you could find in game if you spent enough time looking for them.
---
The game isn't about rebuilding Appalachia. You can't rebuild Appalachia. Nothing you do on a server matters or changes anything. The "main plot" is just a dragon hunt. To quote Todd directly here:  **‚ÄúWe have a game, more than any game that we‚Äôve ever done, where the choices are yours, where you‚Äôll decide what happens. You‚Äôll decide the heroes, and you‚Äôll decide the villains.‚Äù** That's a lie, you don't decide anything that happens. There are no heroes or villains. You can't even decide which faction could rise dominant over the region like in Fallout 4. The game world is completely static and any changes are undone the moment the server resets. Nukes have no lasting effects on the game world. And in a Fallout game that's pretty damned amazing.
---
K I'm doing it right now
---
Also, it seems if you even TOUCH the master volume from anything other than 100% you can't hear people talk regardless of the other sliders settings.
---
I know, but that's no fun...
---
ugh fail, you just restated what i already said.... now that is the saddest thing, you cant even come up with a genuine reply. 
---
poor Tybber, sad Tybber
---
Wasteland ice cream!
---
Just as long as no Xenomorphs show up.
---
Rifle Gaming posted a video about this.
---
Just some NPC named Dooby and a few chests.
---
Thx for the info
---
Nice! Someone should post the link.
---
936 here lol
---
I see it's still burning. And it only makes sense. A dumpster fire will only stop burning when the trash is gone.
---
Keep your chin up.  I went through a rough divorce about six years ago.  Hardest year of my adult life for sure.  
---
I'm engaged again.  Life goes on.
---
His straw man was to argue that I didn't know what an 'instance' was.
---
He never once addressed the topic of the thread, which was about how instances are handled in FO76. He instead attempted to deflect away from the topic with trollish remarks about googling definitions and grammar. That is a picture perfect example of a straw man. Your boy had no purpose in this thread other than to be a troll and he achieved that with straw man tactics.
---
As far as my wording goes....... maybe I could have worded it better but nonetheless it could easily be interpreted either way depending on how you chose to read it (tomayto-tomahto).
---
***\*Bethesda wants to know your location***
---
While I don't disagree with your first part ‚Ä¶¬†as a 50+ medium range crit rifleman employing even a minimum amount of stealth Whitesprings (even when nuked)/Burrows is not really much of a challenge. I solo nuke zones in just a hazmat suit all the time (no power armor)
---
Instancing will come with the vault dungeons. Todd said they had to make the code for it and I assume wasn't ready for burrows.
---
I keep hearing this sentiment, but it's just complete bullshit. I did walk in with god rolled weapons and full x01 PA and obviously rolled through with ease. So then I went back naked, armed with only my all rise, and each slugger perk at level 1, and still cleared it with ease. This "dungeon" is pathetic, and should've simply been called a "short quest addition", then they wouldn't be seeing all this backlash over it, because they would've called it what it is.
---
id love to take said survey
---
I was sorta thinking about doing the same thing gl
---
Yup, at level 90 i tend to have about 2 main legendary weapons and one or two regular ones i havent found a legendary version of yet. Ran around with a lvl 45 normal lever action for like 40 levels on my sniper when my explosive bloodied gauss was out of ammo or broken.   
---
It's really kind of a snowball you have to get rolling, when you get good clearing weapons you can take on more enemies and get more drops.
---
I went in after it had been nuked and came out with 5 legendaries, 2 3*s and 3 1*s. All of the ghouls we're bloated glowing ones.
---
It'll be harder work, but it's very possible. Weight will be difficult to work with, as well as ammo farming. BUT the one good thing is, as far as I can tell people will just throw their 40mms at you, since they're mostly worthless to everyone and weigh alot. I'm sure if you ask on whatever platform you run, people will offload hundreds for the asking. Only other thing I'd say is find/trade for any explosive gun even a pipe pistol. Even a lvl5 on full auto, it will still tear apart mobs or at least slow them down while you retreat.
---
They do not know what hell they will unleash if they introduce legendary weapons, armor or tokens in the Atomic Shop.
---
It would never happen but I'd love a fallout/souls style game made by fromsoft.
---

Is any other dungeon in the game right now instanced? A dungeon is not a raid, it's just Bethesda's name for any interior cell like this. West Tek is a dungeon. The fucking DMV is a dungeon. The community saw Bethesda use the word and ran with it that they were releasing raider tier endgame content, they never said they were. The kind of raid content that damn well better than be instanced, or at the least only allow one group in at time, isn't coming until Nuclear Winter.
---
Done.
---
Dailies and challenges are something to do, but not mandatory. Dungeons &amp; Resets in sub models make sense since they keep people paying longer while playing less so they don't lose what they "earned" (losers) but outside of that, you just give people the chance to start saying "I only need to log in Mondays". Then 2 weeks in, playing another game, they start saying tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow and uninstall.
---
I have a furious MMG that I use religiously. The only downside is you can‚Äôt use it with power armor. I pugilist build that I use so I don‚Äôt need PA for anything but nuke zones.
---
Can‚Äôt get mods to stick to anything! Yet I think I‚Äôm being charged in materials (example leather armor mods). So frustrating!
---
Hang on does the rad damage from a gamma gun get reduced the slap damage effect?
---
That's NOT A STRAW MAN ARGUMENT. Are you in middle school or something? Because not everyone that disagrees with you is a troll, kid.
---
...but on their 'official' forums you can't say "shit" or "fuck" or "dick" or "ass" etc....you know, stuff that you learn in kindergarten or on a school bus......
---
This made me fucking cackle, I just woke up like 10 minutes ago and this is the most I‚Äôve laughed in a morning through all my 19 years of living. Wish I could give you more than just an upvote, fuck all these people bitching &amp; moaning abt this update
---
I was going solo and having fun but then my gun broke and the assaultron killed me :(
---
I‚Äôm level 121, and my weapons never break! I‚Äôm going in with more than one gun next time.
---
+karma Thanks
---
Most don't want an actual  challenge, they want body count and loot. 3* loot. They have no desire to go fight something that thinks and fights back, with OP weapons, like they do.
---
I did successfully put extra flame jets on my shishkebab
---
Have a Fasnacht mask for the inconvenience.
---
I haven‚Äôt played this shit game in months but I do come back to this sub every so often and it‚Äôs nice to see the white-knighting is still top tier!
---
Bethesda should be ashamed to call this a dungeon, 15 years ago playing Mabinogi and they had instanced dungeons along with difficulty modes for said dungeons on day one. Would of been alright if they called it correctly and this is a new location.
---
The secret is in the nuke-sauce!
---
I sing along to country roads every time. Also, i torture my daughters by turning up the volume on the 'ant in my pants' song. The joys of fatherhood...
---
Yeah, the bunker really feels unfinished as a result.
---
There are a ton of beautifully designed camps, settlements, and bases throughout the game that when you see them they just scream "there was supposed to be an interesting group of NPCs here" or "this was a cool quest hub at some point in the design process".   
---
The bunker especially so. Sigh.
---
It sounds exactly like what you should expect from a Bethesda dungeon if you've been ever played any of their games, this one included. If they hadn't oversold they Multiplayer experience and the community hadn't overhyped it as their new endgame then yea, we could have all enjoyed a fun little quest.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
IMHO, harder is not better. Variety and dynamics would be better. If every boss fight is the same why do it more than once when the loot dropped is usually worthless?
---
Haha but what if I said I was on PS4 :P
---
a lot of explosive guns are classified as heavy guns, so make sure you Spec accordingly. this includes
---
Demolition's Expert.
---
Bear arms
---
Ordnance Express 
---
Bloody mess (useful for everything) 
---
Stabilized (if choosing to use power armor)
---
Always, hasn't gotten old. The day of BETA, I listened to that song on repeat. Then, the whole week leading up to official release, song was on repeat. I don't listen to the radio as often as I used to, but one of my favorite things is wandering the wasteland, exploring through a house, and there's a radio that is playing "Country Roads" I always stop and wait for the song to finish.
---
Also, I have been hearing "Country Roads" out in real life a LOT since the game came out. I literally can't go to the store or to any restaurant without walking inside and immediately hearing "Almost heaven..." never fails to bring a smile to my face. And yes, it's always the John Denver version. ;)
---
Nuke Charleston Capitol and tell me how you feel about interiors in nuke zones
---
I took down my very first one around level 35 as well as a sniper. It was only level 50 and I had the help of a bunch of super mutants over near Huntersville. Made a huge difference. Felt good and I ended up taking a picture I was so proud.
---
My advice to most people is, farm what you can, and respec yourself as best you can to the first really good weapon you find. Then, you can farm better until you find a legendary you need for your desired spec. 
---
I‚Äôm doing that with my shotty, and it turns out I can be an effective sniper even with a lot of shotgun perks, so I think it will all work our eventually.
---
The problem for me is that the lore is only presented via terminals and holotapes. It's SUPER interesting (especially the enclave stuff) but...well...dead.   
---
What does it matter what Santiago or Eckheart did. They're dead. Everyone's dead.
---
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for money, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long gaming career, skills that make me a joy for people like you. If you let me install your mods, that'll be the end of it. I will add karma for you. I will endorse you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.
---
There are plenty of ways to design a location that make it impossible to do solo without relating to god-like damage potential.
---
BSG needs to start getting creative. 
---
The issue seems to be its game leads spending years building SOLO content.
---
The need to learn to start building TEAM content ‚Ä¶ and fast.
---
Because they are DLC and not core locations.  So it has to add each module as the game comes up for you.
---
That sounds like the most boring Thunderdome fight ever. 
---
"12 Geeks enter, 1 Geek leaves!"
---
Yeah I take personal credit for pumping everyone here up. Do I regret it? Naw.
---
Yep, they had to patch it to 'bring it to a more even state' in the april 9th patch-- however, ive never seen things decay so quick, even post 'fix' things were decaying so fast, that even with good with salt, i couldnt keep any fresh picked items or meats around for more than 5-10 minutes. it was pretty egregious, and i was struck with  lots of spoilts that i wasnt used to or ready for.
---
Pretty sure that guy had a tard moment
---
There is perk less explosive ammo weight I believe or not?
---
Rifle Gaming nuked Tanagra Town and it wasn't worth it from what I saw.
---
Ok not something a level 50 newb who doesn't quite understand the game mechanics yet can solo. That was too many syllables so I simplified it.
---
Just because everyone else is posting the rest of the total bangers on this ST...
---
Ahem...
---
"Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
---
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines."
---
The second I saw the Greenbriar in the trailer I knew it had to be where the Enclave would be.
---
Omg that grind is bs, wouldn't mind it if I didn't get killed every 20mins by a random. But to be fair if they don't do this no one would play this trash survival mode unless they got a bloodied unyielding build.
---
guys please give me the script for toggle ADS with the right click of the mouse or I can't play the game....just installed :(
---
They are under floor decor with the Deathclaw statue that is also available in the Atom Shop.
---
I have no idea, I don't speak PvPese.
---
I only used it to heal the ghouls. Not sure if that is still the case - haven't done a nuked WS for donkeys.
---
Only the four "unsolved" side quests that you can find on the wall, near the map, of Calvin's office in Van Lowe Taxidermy. There are only five mounted plans available so far.
---
Wait is this sarcastic?
---
I'm consistently just flat out amazed at how many insanely detailed and wide open spaces there are with NOTHING goin on. Whitesprings upstairs for instance. NOTHING. The Bunker. Nothing. Ad nauseum
---
It's a soothing sound that Gatling gun makes.
---
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it cleeeear!!
---
Nothing better than a flaming shishkabob ;)
---
All right, I already did those. Just making sure. Thanks!
---
This is a multiplayer game! Your game play is and should be affected by other players!!! People thinking they can come in here and recreate there fo4 experience baffles me...
---
What paltform are you on? If it's PS4 Im pretty sure I have a legendary launcher on one of my characters. Also the amount of frag grenades you find on corpses is kind of ridiculous
---
Those are not plans. You can not pick up any little blue folders that say for example Plan: X-01 Jet Pack. Those DO NOT EXIST. You just sent me a screenshot with a PURCHASED MOD like I've been saying this whole time.
---
\^\^\^\^ this is a rolling concept 'cause you're gonna find 304985703498750394875 of that stuff before May 23...and beyond....so, it is not your last meal..
---
I know we can just not press "X" (ps4) but when you see a plastic plate on a table, its in my instinct to try and grab it.
---
yes. Ordnance Express. its in my list of recommended perks for a Kaboomer build
---
Nuke it and you will have your challenge
---
By those descriptions, I would picture something like the massive underground dwemer ruins from Skyrim, with the giant mushrooms and underground dragon and the such... Now that would have been the dungeon I would have been expecting from that description.
---
It amazes me you can't read a road map. This isn't some secret we've had to piece together ourselves or something we should be eagerly anticipating each patch to see if it will show up next. We only know three things about the next season of dlc and "High level raids" is one of them.
---
Thats what I thought it would be when they have announced it Dungeon and its only a map extension really.
---
Ahh I see, you are suggesting some sort of aggro system like in Army of Two or something?
---
I... Damn... My character has INT 15. Guess I set myself up for this.
---
That's a straw man bruh. He tried to discredit my position by implying that I didn't know what an instance was and then he moved on to grammar......but then never once addressed the topic of the thread. You should revisit that liberal arts degree you purchased because you got ripped off.
---
Even with both of you down voting me the original post is still a net positive bruh.
---
I‚Äôm PS4
---
I would like to add giant spiders to that list . Complete with cc mechanics , good ole webbed up , can't move for a few seconds goodness . Radwidows. The assualtron should have had either gatling, or laser nipples. To be unique.
---
Not sure but maybe? Im not familiar with the aggro system in it.
---
Bad news though is games with skeleton crews are usually slated to be shut down in immediate future. Hope its not the case but Bethesda was hoping for a smash hit with this asset flip and they didn't, and no gloating on stage that games doing well will change how much of a flop its been so far.
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Hey, i don't have time to write a book right now. But i will respond later. You can even direct chat me if you want, i am interested in having a legit discussion with you.
---
Thank you for proving it
---
Not now but I could later today.
---
Better yet, this game could use some nice audio occlusion, because there are several secret areas that are spoiled by the things inside of them making noise.
---
I swear I feel like a fool constantly for trying to enjoy this game. I get genuinely excited for the sheepsquatch and show up for an absolute murder fest with everyone just zerging it and we all still lose. I get genuinely excited for burrows and show up to a nearly empty sewer. Not to mention I can barely play what with the constant crashes and disconnects.... but that is for another thread...
---
My point is to be overly specific and general. Yes, those are examples of higher end dungeons, it doesn't mean anything less than them isn't also a dungeon.
---
I‚Äôm not the other commenter but I can attest to his point.
---
These armors are why I still play the game.
---
I want to have them, I want to 
---
And my character the best it can be.
---
I can one shot anything right now with the exception of sheepsqutch and the scorched beast queen.
---
I am the endgame.
---
But I don‚Äôt have these armors and that‚Äôs what keeps me playing.
---
I don't believe it is charging materials, at least not all of the time. I am a fairly new player and didn't understand why I couldn't apply some pretty basic mods and noticed that the material count wasn't going down when I spammed it trying to get it to work before seeing that it's a known issue.
---
yeah if they just @#$@% release the update where other players cant destroy your house then this wouldnt even be an issue...what are they waiting for?
---
Isn't there an issue with explosive effect overriding the anti-armor effect?
---
Having a 'dungeon' to bring about a new challenge, to give reason to bring a couple of players together is a great idea for this game. It adds a good PVE /Co-op element. 
---
Having a traditional MMO style 'raid' .... no thank you. IMHO, that is too much for this game. It would take away from the experience i personally enjoy about the game. You would have to dedicate time to organizing, scheduling, and make it more of a job to do 'raids' than to enjoy the game time.
---
The 'world events' are great. The SBQ or Crytid event pop up. BLAM!! everyone just shows up. Yes i know these events need some work and better loot drops but i feel it works well for what FO76 is.
---
just my two cents...
---
There‚Äôs been a few times when I‚Äôve been playing in the living room and my fianc√© passed by and we both just start belting it out together. Happy times :)
---
the trailer still gives me shivers.
---
3 points alone im first aid will outheal all 3 pylons.  More point in field surgeon and you're laughing. I do this all the time and don't die. Attacking the squatch without the pylons just isn't a smart move. Light all 3 pylons, cryolate that bitch into a sheepcicle and slap the shit out of it. Works every time.
---
How dare you we Walmart clothes shoppers have better stuff to wear, still hoping for a glow in the dark skeleton suit in atomshop which is available in Walmart during halloween but not atomshop.
---
its a low level dungeon. there oughta be some of those right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
IDK if you can learn those specific mods from scrapping, but I do know you have to scrap the same item mutiple times to learn a random mod for that weapon. 
---
  For some mods, yes, if you havent learned it through scrapping, you have to have it in your inventory to apply it. 
---
  The benefit behind "mod already in inventory" is that it includes all the necessary materials to craft the item ( which you may or may not have enough of on hand).  
---
(Its the included materials that makes the mod scrappable)
---
Agree however there is a difference between constructive criticism and simple attacking. Its all in the wording.
---
&gt;but he's not involved in the community.
---
He's not involved in *this* community. Reddit always overestimates how much it represents the community of a game or other media: 90% of people aren't hanging around forums or keeping up with the latest news/controversies, they're just logging in and playing. Bethesda's said they pay attention to this subreddit, but they're gonna want data that represents everyone who plays, not just the people who participate in the community outside the game.
---
So sorry to hear that  I don‚Äôt think ex partners should be able to stop the other seeing their child  unless the child is in danger, it makes me so mad üò† I‚Äôm divorced and I gave my ex husband open access they are his kids too. I really hope you are able to get access good luck üëçüèª Your so right about Fallout 76 I rarely leave my house due to disability it‚Äôs so nice to meet new interesting people Fallout has some of the best online gamers üòÄ
---
What's left in this game? I've filled all 5 character slots I have 2 above level 120 the other low 30-80s, done all the story, found all the tapes the notes the locations. What's left other than wanting a high level dungeon? After you complete everything the game is nothing but mobs and loot. I still don't have the best gear so that's all there really is to go for now. 
---
A dungeon that would have had alot of hard enemys would have been great, the burrows could have been that if they set up a default large spawn, but when a friend and I went in they came at us in groups of 3 that area should have been set for like groups of 20 or so. Make it thrilling. I don't have an optimized build I don't have the TSE and it was still easy. Also there should be a minimum enemy level, why was the boss a lvl 47 Assaulttron? Why did some of the ghouls spawn as 46-48s?
---
Go complain about how gender inequality or institutional racism
---
Would be cool tho only problem is that well if it was me that was being hunted soon as I saw it pop up I would just hunt it down and fill everything in a few shots
---
I love this idea. Like you‚Äôre researching your enemy so you know more about it.
---
That one must really hurt! I've not seen most of the materials for all the mods on Power Armour yet, but my goal is to get the Pure Violet Flux (I just need the Violet Flux now to make it) for creating Calibrated Shocks on my Excavator, but I'm scared they'll disappear now.
---
Additional problem now is that currently kills on survival give you less caps than on adventure. A solution could be to remove caps rewards from adventure alltogether - no possible gain would be the strongest deterrent.
---
The only thing I could think is that my arm would get tired after a while.
---
Finish that sentence? About how gender inequality or institutional racism *what*
---
Not even going to lie, I could get through most of it alone with my level 31 Rifleman build with a sawn-off secondary and a death tambo. I just get stuck at the end since the Encrytid event sucks out all my meds since I am the only conduit half the time.
---
Most are duds and from looking at the list published I think they still are. I still enjoy running around and finding them but dont expect much out of them....
---
I would probably like this. The downside to Mirelurk Queen is the poison damage, there's not many ways to prevent poison. There really should be a chem of some sort to help resist it.
---
Well that‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôll just have to be patient for the fixes I suppose.
---
Yeh , end up with one big arm like a lobster or lonely basement dwelling redditor
---
Good luck to you. I hope it works out for you and your fam.
---
I like the one that's like "MacNeil please don't take my wheels "
---
My right to bear arms is how!
---
Common sense is a two way street. We knew this is a Fallout game, that raid tier content wasn't coming until Nuclear Winter, and that as much as they up sold the multiplayer aspect and got flowery about the difficulty that they never actually said anything about it being instanced or anything people dreamed it would be.
---
In general, I save mods for:
---
Sledgehammers
---
Deathclaw gauntlets
---
Pole hook
---
Sacrificial blade (machete)
---
Calibrated shocks
---
Pockets/deep pocketed armor
---
Dense armor
---
Discard
---
T-45 mods
---
Raider PA mods
---
Whoops, allow me to explain a little. The ‚Äúaggro‚Äù system in that game worked a bit like this. 
---
Let‚Äôs say player one is killing a bunch of enemies, lighting up a bunch of ammo and blowing a bunch of shit up. Player one will get the ‚Äúaggro‚Äù and the enemies will focus more on this player since they‚Äôre doing the most damage/mayhem.
---
Player two may also be doing damage and stuff but not as much as player one, so the enemies attention is still on them here and there but isn‚Äôt the priority as much as player one is. 
---
The moment player two starts doing more than player one, enemies attention will shift. 
---
Haven‚Äôt played Army of Two in a while but that‚Äôs kinda how it worked if my memory serves me correctly.
---
Alright now no politics here
---
I do have an anti armour 'the dragon', so I'm keeping that
---
We can't do anything else than wait for Bethesda to fix it... Honestly hurry the fuck up Bethesda
---
My buddy made an explosive build. It's ok. Last laugh, mysterious savior, and life saving armor are kind of hilarious.
---
I'm gunna take this as bait. No proof, "a friend of mine".
---
Lmao... soooooo just all the things we do offline then? 
---
You cannot tell me what you've just described isn't peddling a dead horse???
---
Ps I don't care about karma down vote away... 
---
Inconvenient truth is... the game is now dead. 
---
Summer is too long to wait for meaningful end game material.
---
F076 will have been out 9moths by then 
---
9 months from realise date for end game material besides the SBQ??? Who FYI isn't worth the hassle, potential glitch &amp; no reward. Spunk 3k bullets &amp; get a 10mm handgun you vendor for 100caps. üôÑ 
---
The fan boy has kept me playing this long.but that borrows dungeon has pisses me off. 
---
Expected a lot more than 10min play time from it
---
Beth is being a bit optimistic assuming we will still be playing/pick it back up by the time they get round to it. 
---
** Spoiler alert ** 
---
I'll save the suspense, don't expect a DLC with as much content as far harbour on FO4. 
---
Everything else has been half arsed so far &amp; generally broke on release.
---
In retrospect I have a fat man that weighs 0.5 and a sniper rifle that weighs 11
---
Remain objective?
---
Please tell me you actually wear the Tin Foil hat while doing this.  Not your character, but you, personally.
---
How does that buld damage high lvl mobs? Super mutants and scorch beasts?
---
Im starting to think you have no fucking clue what you are talking about?
---
You do know what keeps these types of games alive?
---
 Is it the new players? 
---
no
---
Is it the mid level play once every month have no idea what is happening players?
---
Is it the player that defends BGS at every turn no matter how bad they fuck up ? 
---
Its the people who keep playing, and the people who keep playing have a tendency to get to those high levels because they keep playing.
---
Why would Bethesda create new content adjusted towards low to mid level players when the entire base game is there to serve that purpose.
---
Stop defending bad marketing and over-promising and under-delivering, you are only shooting yourself in the leg in the long run.
---
I sing along to it whenever it's one, sometimes my team joins in!
---
Can the pink flamingo call in waves of flamingos to your aid like in Zelda hitting chickens.
---
We are getting backpacks aswell
---
We don't know anything about it yet and honestly it's the same self as hyping that we did here, but the expectation is that the Nuclear Winter mode coming with them next season of dlc might be the hard mode we've all been waiting for.
---
Ideally yes but if this sub is any indication of where the mind of the fan base is at then the game is fucked. With some people Bethesda can do no wrong.
---
Oh lol
---
Aggro is based on dmg dps, which as a bloodied build, really sucks at SBQ and squatch fights.
---
LUL. legit leveling no bath, no eat, drink, no sleep, no work since day one, or some glitch abuse ?
---
I actually had a piece of clothing disappear that I was actually wearing  myself. When I hopped out of my Power Armour I was naked.
---
About "wasting ammo": I for one like to use heavy weapons and suppression effect against the imposter 'squatch, shielded or no. Can stagger to interrupt attacks, cause fire damage (helps track the thing), and also I keep the attention off the lower levels/people killing adds/hitting pylons. 
---
Just a sort of psa that some of us have other strategies. I definitely don't think that you should just dump whatever shot you have at it without thinking though.
---
Most  MMOs use that model now (the one you described - play whenever, weekly/daily ‚Äòbonus‚Äô loot). 
---
It‚Äôs still a play-driver, even if it‚Äôs not as addictive as the skinner boxes we‚Äôve seen over and over. 
---
Nothing is mandatory in a game, but persistent online games need hooks and exit points. Having a daily/weekly lockout is a hook - players generally know when they reset and when things ‚Äòhave to‚Äô be done by. The exit point is the completion of the event/challenge. 
---
It‚Äôs a bit dicey, because we‚Äôre comparing challenges and dailies to raids and dungeons (by MMO, not FO76 definition). Different activities are supposed to have different draws, lockouts and ‚Äòtime required‚Äô. A well designed MMO will let you make -some- progress if you only have 20 minutes per day to play, but will allow you to -continually- progress if you‚Äôre willing to grind out for 10-12 hours. 
---
That usually comes in the form of high reward:time investment ratios on daily quests and challenges. Do a simple thing that you‚Äôd likely do anyway , or that would only be a slight alteration to normal activity (wear a hat!) and you get rewards. 
---
This seems to be where FO76 (and several other new release ‚Äòloot‚Äô games) are lacking. They‚Äôre not understanding that ‚Äúif I play for an hour a day I‚Äôll still be useful to my mid tier raid team‚Äù aspect that MMOs have been nurturing for years.
---
We gave him a bunch of explosive weapons. Most notably a couple good auto grenade launchers. We're a group of 4 now, so we find him more ammo than you might think.
---
I can craft all the missile launcher mods too, which is kinda neat to see doing work.
---
No. For being cowards and picking on much lower level players who can't do anything about it. 
---
For trying to overcome their real life feelings of inadequacy by bullying weaker players online, with no consequences. 
---
Basically for making the game less fun for others who also paid for the game and have the right to be left alone if they want to be.
---
I did it with my combat knife , no melee perks on . I never use melee perks . I carry three guns and 4 melee weapons . I use gun perks , but I barley ever use my guns . They are for when I'm in danger , or for shooting flying rats . And my pipe pistol would be way too much for those poor ghouls.
---
You keep saying most players feel its challenging, then why is 99.9% of comments and threads here about the dungeon being extremely easy.
---
And before you say that this sub represents a minuscule portion of the players, this sub has 181 000 subscribers, that is not a minuscule portion.
---
You gotta do what you gotta do in the wasteland, and rules were always meant to be broken
---
I guess it's not just PC then. Now I'm living in fear of losing my carry weight and having to haul my gear in the middle of nowhere haha.
---
I heard rumors of dropping the item you want modded then picking it back up right before you try and mod.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs amazing 
---
Guess it was not hard leveling that build tho
---
That's... Not an assaultron attack? Sounds like you just had someone else snipe your boss.
---
Perk cards provide this now. Enforcer in agility for shotguns, Tormentor in luck for rifles, One Gun Army for heavy guns in luck. There's something for pistols too, but a very low % compared to the others. Shotgun one is OP, as it triggers per pellet (30% per each and there are like 6 pellets per shot).
---
I'm a sucker for I'm a wanderer.
---
People were too busy rushing through the quests to take the time to actually read and enjoy the lore... which anyone who played FO1/2 know that 75% of the game is the lore and easter eggs.
---
Does restarting/server swapping reset it? Still a pain to have to reset a server in the middle of doing something though.
---
To be fair we don't know Tybber42s full story behind this motivation on hating this post, maybe hes 1 of the 12 employees working on this game.
---
I thought those perks only staggered. Do they also do extra limb damage?
---
&gt; the vault dwellers of vault 76 came out looking to resettle Appalachia, but ended up nuking a robot hotel until the end of their days.
---
lmfao
---
I think some Scorched BoS enemies would be better than ghouls because they have some semblance of intelligence.
---
The news should just be a button to click under "PLAY" or something. It's actually so awful that the game starts up, and you see the main menu for a split second before the news pops up. It's really not implemented very well.
---
I have to sometimes wait like half a minute when i enter a building or when i fast travel
---
I think I'll give marathoner a shot.  Thanks for the tip!
---
And it's stupid that you're always two steps behind someone dying. Like a lot of the responders or various groups of raiders. Their bodies are there at early stages of decomposition, so why is there absolutely NOBODY alive?
---
‚Äúnot us... but also ad victorium....‚Äù
---
Endgame probably
---
We‚Äôve had nothing to do but grind for better gear for months.
---
Sounds like they need a perk that makes you agro harder, or a mutation, or both
---
\&gt;  ot great for those players who do not play every day or watch the store for expiring offers though. 
---
eh.  I got the 1st egg last night before my play session last night.
---
Wasnt sure when it was going to reset to a new egg, and IDK if I'll be on tonight, so...
---
Since the atom shop is accessible from the main menu/without fully entering the game, 
---
I checked this morning.  Took me all of about 5 minutes to power on the PS, login, check the atom store for a new egg, close the game and power off the system....then left for work.
---
I agree but at the same time Bethesda was misleading as well. They kept saying it would be a challenge even for the most geared high level players. Heck I bet if you look on the news screen before you log in it probably still says that about the burrows.
---
Not hard at all. Super duper and moli5ovs are pretty effective. I have a crazy team medic build, so I can share fireproof or anything else, so my friends can level characters really easy. It's kind of a different story for me sadly lol.
---
I picked up a toaster last night on my way to the boss to try out your theory from yesterday, it didn't work, she said no so I had to kill her.
---
So much this.
---
Instancing is new tech for the Arktos Pharmacy dungeon. This is a small quest, like Sheepsquatch, like ever upwards etc...
---
This is not a dungeon. The Inside the Vault F'd up referencing it as such.
---
You make less sense than a feminist
---
I totally agree! I have a build that's almost perfected now, unarmed is what I'm going for. I enjoy being the envy of my friends and my ability to [nearly one punch](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/thehappyraider/video/71015800) everything into a red paste is enjoyable, but it's unrewarding and lack's any ability to truly improve! Hopefully, they will add some sorta challenge for people with builds like mine.
---
It's a marketing team, it's kind of a small part of their jobs to take what the dev team hands them and try to get people excited about it so they will play the game.
---
I gotta say, yeah the game has given me some real problems (glitches, bugs, disconnects, you name it, I've experienced it multiple times and sometimes multiple times per session) but the people! It's hard to think about my life situation when I'm out in the wastes helping people and meeting people. I'm a curmudgeon with CPTSD and hanging out with new people is so difficult in real life. I'm learning a lot about how to be around people from this game. It's not like my previous online gaming experiences where we team up and then after the session we leave each other's lives for the rest of the day or week or whatever. We all seem to keep in touch through discord or reddit. It's really neat. I have a couple of favorite people I play with and seeing them (their toons I mean haha) (I should say hearing their voices) brings a smile to my face and it's nice.
---
All three of my kids know the song by heart now and shout it at the top of their lungs when they hear it.
---
There is going to be a line out the door 5/23 ... hope that the vendor can accommodate more than one person at a time  monkaS
---
Good point! Always follow the trail of money to find the answers.
---
Yeah I see
---
That‚Äôs a problem for me too, I‚Äôm playing alone nobody of my fiends like fallout
---
They were already dumb. They should have realized that instead of power armor and surface to air missile launchers all they needed to defeat the scorched was magical armor they could get off "legendary" ghouls, who have it for some reason.
---
they said it was a dungeon and given the design of it all, that means fallout already had dungeons. Anything you instanced would be a dungeon then and I never mentioned it as end game, just design wise it was common sense. When I got there all the mobs were dead from other players and the loot was underwhelming despite them saying you would be rewarded well. It just feels like any other place that has mobs in it. What difference is this from any other place besides adding a random boss at the end? That‚Äôs what piss players off IMO. It wasn‚Äôt anything special and was sold as a dungeon, but was merely a copy and paste job of any other place. 
---
It‚Äôs not a dungeon, it‚Äôs just another vault tech university.
---
 How about a shopping list. 
---
Exterminators .50MG
---
assassins .50 MG
---
Vampires .50MG
---
Tse gatling
---
Mutant slayers lmg
---
Not included, inherent-90%weight
---
Troubleshooters DCG
---
Troubleshooters fat man
---
It's all over the YouTubes, there's no containing it.  Besides, if the mobs respawn every time someone joins the area, it's like unlimited farming.
---
There's a patch scheduled for next Tuesday (supposed to have the camera); no mods is a nuisance but not really worth rolling out a hotfix.
---
They have a chance to fully cripple a limb per bullet/pellet. The pistol one is called modern renegade (2/3/4% to cripple). There's also one for bashing with any gun in strength (5/10%).
---
Good for you big guy
---
It does, and it's definitely a pain, but I guess that's what I have to do for now. And on top of that, I now have a duplicate set of the armor in my inventory taking up weight, and if I try to put them in my stash or on another chassis, it takes them off the one I'm wearing.
---
I agree - I‚Äôm specced into heavy weapons and have a vampires mini gun. Any time I‚Äôm low on health I pull that baby out and in about 2 seconds of shooting I‚Äôm back to full health. I‚Äôm so curious if this would be a viable facetank build for something like that. Just never stop firing.
---
Everyone flicks pens at each other... Horrible way to die that. Death by a thousand scribbles.
---
Make friends in game. Or convert your friends. We've actually been recruiting lol. We started as 3 and have 5 currently. One was given the game as a birthday present so he'd quit spending hours at my friend's house building bases.
---
Which honestly would be another good use of it. Even for the bloodied melee in the squatch fight. Itd be a good means to help keep your dps alive rather than chased and killed.
---
They want you to be in the shoes of a Vault Dweller stepping out into a world where *everyone* is just gone, and you're like "What the *fuck* happened?"
---
&gt;What does it matter what Santiago or Eckheart did. They're dead. Everyone's dead.
---
Exactly. Ain't it fucking tragic?
---
Imo, if the game ends up delivering really solid content in Wastelanders, this is a phenomenal setup. 
---
You emerge from Vault 76 expecting the world to be fucked up, but at least *populated*, until you realize *everyone is dead*. You learn the story of how the original survivors of WV were slowly exterminated from infighting and the scorched plague, you stop the spread of the scorched and you begin rebuilding society.
---
Again, **if** Wastelanders delivers fantastic content, then I honestly think the setup of FO76 is phenomenal. But I'll be disappointed if they don't do this arc that I'm kind of hypothesizing.
---
New DLC content breh. Endless opportunities. Literally you could have a quest line in between with MODUS doing shady things where you have to stop him (with recurring frequency).
---
Could have whitesprings upstairs section be something you can unlock after some quest involving Whitesprings/MODUS
---
Could literally have hundreds of questlines for BOS in between.
---
0.o
---
Yeah I have some friends in game guess need to write them about some help
---
Oh alright. Thats a much more balanced way of having it. because frankly, kneecapper was really OP
---
Yeah I've pretty much given up on there being real end game in this game at this point. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. Guess I'll wait for Classic WoW to come out in November and give my money to Blizzard again.
---
lol could be!!! i blocked him, no use in interacting with him further
---
I always joins friends world's, and promptly send team invites.
---
‚ÄúWeeeeeelllllllllllllll‚Äù
---
I can get that but I was mainly referring to those complaining that it isn‚Äôt good end game content. The same folks complaining the burrows isn‚Äôt hard enough are the same folks complaining about the sheepsquatch fight being too hard because they have to coordinate and follow on screen instructions instead of just unloading 1000 tse rounds and calling it a day
---
Lol greifers don't like survival cuz they can't see you on the map! Come change in survival mode!
---
Yeah but my character will be lvl 1 not everyone like low level running with u
---
They haven't fixed anything because there was no patch. Just like faushnacht all of this was included in the the previous patch and just unlocked itself when it was time. They only rush out patches when there's something super game breakingly serious like when they accidentally wrote over a chunk of the game with outdated code and reverted a bunch of previous bug and exploits fixes.
---
aaaaaand now the x-files theme is playing in my head...
---
Go play something else for a while?
---
Yeah I was going to do one on my own but it is so boring
---
It was hilarious in F4. It's still hilarious on shotguns in F76. A Scorchbeast for example just hovers there or perms-lands and stops doing anything after a few shots.
---
Don't think a TSE handmade is legacy.
---
Its an online game. In EVERY online game, especially one that is losing players to content, a 3 month bragfest by the company over a bew DUNGEON means one thing. A DUNGEON. 
---
Take any person on the planet earth who plays online and ask them what a DUNGEON is and they will all reply what is it, and the answer will be the same. 
---
How bethesda, a company who makes online games with DUNGEONS , forgot what it was is laughable. Amd more to the point, its misleading. I refuse to believe that bethesda didnt know this.  Therefore we were intentionally misled. THAT IS NOT OK. Claiming ignorance in your own product is not a ok outcome. 
---
A turd is a turd. A dungeon is a dungeon. Please do not excuse this away with your awful thinking.
---
Imagine if you bought a car with WHEELS. but recieved no wheels because they started calling the airvebts wheels. Its silly dude
---
When do we get the next egg?
---
Not if you consider Harper's Ferry as well though.
---
Remember the Super Mutants/Scorched on the top will turn as well.
---
the issue i have with workshops in adventure is the broken aspect of it-
---
if you take a workshop, and then go back out into the world, people can find where you are anywhere in the world, then have one person go find you and wait by you, then have a teammate "contest" the workshop, then immediate the other person who was stalking you, can kill you where ever you are. this is bad design.
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area to go about my business, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: WORKSHOP PVP in Adventure Mode SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP
---
none of this "2 players team up, one stalks the workshop owner back to his house, the other then initiates workshop contesting, then the other teammate who has been stalking the other player simply 1 shots them at their house
---
Upvote!
---
The game warns you that you will be in PVP zone if you take over a workshop.
---
My wife ran it at 26 and only died once. She has a single one star weapon. Took her maybe ten minutes, and a lot of that was the root maze.
---
I am currently running the build you want to run. But I have melee as my back up but it is the most fun I have playing this game but BE WARNED you will lose loot as mobs tend to fly away and can never be found
---
Did we have a road map at launch? iirc we didn't have any kind of rhyme or reason for anything until the end of February. That's after Bethesda shit the bed with just about everything in FO76. 
---
I'm glad they're doing something about the game, but don't act like it's been well oiled machine from the get go.
---
It would have been cool to meet the Thunder but scorched versions in power armor. 
---
Enemies with tactics is what the end game needs.
---
Put on Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Action Boy and Blocker. You will be able to take alot more damage.
---
It's not.  I think the only thing that would count as "legacy" would be finding an explosive energy weapon down there.
---
If I find it I'm using it. Gotta flex on all the wastelanders that come to my camp with kegs of cheap booze.
---
*BoS Scout: Sir, We've lost contact from Harper's Ferry months ago, and very strange electronic signals have been coming from their sewer systems.*
---
*BoS Commander: Harper's Ferry? The town we haven't been able to totally subjugate like the Responders, that's famous for a massive armory? Strange *electronic* signals? I know the right men for the job.*
---
*Goes to Speaker System*
---
*BoS Commander: Cornelius! Poindexter! Sebastian! Gear up. We've got a job for you.*
---
Legacy weapons include explosive energy weapons.
---
The Handmade is not an energy weapon
---
Cant upvote this enough =)
---
I thought so too
---
Usually he will curse and threaten violence upon them üòÇ
---
Well when the vendor comes out, it wouldn't hurt to put the tokens in the atom shop. It's not a piece of gear.
---
Same reason that sometimes if you spawn in in front of the Nukashine and sprint to the back door, you find a sheet of plywood instead of a door. The additions are overlays on the base game.
---
Just telling you what end game means
---
They released a trailer for wild Appalachia. Did we overhype it or did we buy into the hype?
---
I am currently waiting for my 100‚Ç¨ 1 TB SSD to arrive because I want to stop falling asleep while 'fast' traveling. Standard PS4 here, will update this post once everything is installed, re-downloaded and running again.
---
I hope this upgrade makes server-hopping great again...
---
so it's \*better\* than whitespring is what you're saying.
---
So SHHHHHHHHH don't jinx it they'll nerf it
---
I just wish people had the capacity to A. see if it's already been posted in the sub a billion times and B. to maybe try to keep things like that lower profile.
---
Wishful thinking I know.
---
Arktos Pharmacy underground is supposed to be a dungeon. 
---
This was just a quest. The fact that Inside the Vault mentioned it as such was an unforced error.
---
Nope. I especially love when it turned up in Kingsman: Golden Circle.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSRMRh8fEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSRMRh8fEs)
---
Mirelurks can be found inside the Wendigo cave there are a bunch there.  At least 10 I think.  There is also an amusement park in the ash heap (near a train station) that sits on a lake.  I can't remember the name and am not home to look it up but, it spawns Mirelurks too.
---
Robots are easy.  There are lots in Watoga or Dyer Chemical plant.  If you really want to do it easily then the Agricultural center in Flatwoods has lots of low-level bots.  For a challenge, you can gun down the security robots at Whitesprings and try and stay alive long enough to kill all 50 in one go since they will keep respawning.
---
I'd do events to get the insects and canines.  Insects usually spawn during tea time and dogs during the leader of the pack.  You could also take over workshops and hope you get them as the wave enemies.
---
Scorched are everywhere especially the Morgantown airport but, there are usually some at top of the world (near the vendor) too.
---
I‚Äôve gotten all of the armor paints, under armor plan and the uniform plans.
---
This took hundreds of turn ins.  I have the gift of blankness and can mindlessly get technical data while I watch seasons and seasons of shows on Netflix. 
---
The two best spots are the Military Wing of the enclave in the desks and Watoga high school in the principal‚Äôs office and the computer lab both right by the front door.
---
Only pickup the technical data no matter what else spawns you want.  When you take an item that slot loses the ability to spawn anything for a day or two.
---
You will gets tons of stimpacks which is about the only good thing I can say about the grind.  You will occasionally get one piece of combat armor.
---
mine is at like 60 gigs i think
---
the LAMEST thing is, every @#$@$$@ update, it says on PS4 i have to delete some space to make room, but i have over 80 gigs free, each time it wants you to have as much free space as the ENTIRE game file, its ridiculous
---
I think players were confused because of the + sign, meaning it would be an a challenge for anyone 50 or above. It‚Äôs their marketing of it that caused this anger. They marketed this as a dungeon, but really why would you? It‚Äôs just another building to explore. There is no difference between this and vault tech university outside of a boss that drops a ok blade. When calling it a dungeon players were expecting something they can do with their friends and not the entire server, yes expectations were high in the player base, but they should had clarify what a dungeon would be. 
---
Because there was no communication and the marketing made this sound like something new to the fallout franchise it set players expectations High, causing a mass of disappointment.
---
When a game that's about the end of the world set in apocolypse times is better than real life...
---
Yeah, I probably will too. I like decorating my camp with knickknacks more than I need caps.
---
Decor ok, needs more Abbie tho.
---
I was initially disappointed in this place but the nuking does add some replayability to it. I personally think this was the plan all along and it was meant to pull people away from constantly nuking Whitespring so WS can start becoming more of a trading hub. It would be nice to bring more players to the usually dead quiet right side of the map.
---
You are strong and wise, and I am very proud of you.
---
Exactly, if you need a challenge dump all your legendary weapons, perk cards and mutations and run it old school. They are basically in game cheats that everyone uses (me for sure). I tried it...I turned everything off, put the good guns in the box and you better be able to duck a weave like a mofo if you want to live.
---
Really sorry to hear that man. Had the same with my ex and there's nothing I can say apart from don't give up. I didn't and 6 years later me and my lad are inseparable and she could never stop me seeing him now. Hope everything works out, mate :)
---
Did you build on the bunker under the powerline tower?  I'd considered moving in there myself since it's already nicely furnished.  LOL
---
&gt;They stated months ago that the average daily playtime for their playerbase is 4 hours a day.
---
Holy cow, who are these people? Who can spend four hours a day, every day, playing any type of game? I mean, I get that there are lots of people who are single and childless and have the time or on disability or have a broken leg or on house arrest or any number of completely reasonable reasons, but the *average* 76 player plays four hours a day?
---
That number is astounding.
---
I would challenge you sell it for 18k. See if anyone picks it up. Estimates are nice but...
---
Farming that negative karma, huh?
---
There's a big difference between SSD and mechanical drive performance. I got one a couple years ago, and now they're all I use. You can pick up one between \~$60-200 depending on the brand, condition, and capacity. If you get one, you'll be able to reuse/re-purpose it in the new system or in a whole 'nother application.
---
Sounds funüòÇ
---
I agree. In a past MMO life, I specifically ran the aggro hound tank for the group.
---
95% of the content out is there for casual builds. We just want some diversity so we have reason to keep playing the game. People were asking for high level raids over a month ago. I don‚Äôt think those asking have reverted in level.
---
Who ever said inside the vault was put out by the dev team? The formating for the thing is a pure flowery blog post as would be written by some marketing department. When we get patch notes those are direct and to the point. But Inside the Vault literally is just advertising for the game.
---
And they're shocked when a non instanced area gets flooded with players who are using min/maxed builds and wipe everything out almost immediately and say there's no challenge.  Uh yeah, there's definitely no challenge when almost an entire server goes to any area.
---
Keep or sell rare or uncommon ones, scrap the rest.
---
There are so many easier ways to get mats.
---
If you dont want pvp, dont take a workshop. When you claim it...it even warns you. üôà
---
I literally have an offer of 16.5 on this post lol. It‚Äôs cross posted to fb also.
---
Happened a couple weeks ago i think, at least a week tho
---
I feel like outside this sub, that's good advice in general.
---
I'm not sure if Digital and Physical have different sizes, but my physical version is at 60.85 GB.
---
Sorry, but i think she's dead.
---
yknow there's a button for that
---
This\^ 
---
I'm guessing it'll be somewhere around 12-2pm EST.
---
I would like to add that crickets dont count towards the insect part, I tried farming tanagra town as about 10 spawn on the way up but they did not count towards it, so I assume they dont register as insects.
---
Ooh, like in BREATH OF THE WILD. Nice idea!
---
That's the plan
---
Troll?
---
You truly are stupid. Your title's wording implies you DON'T want instancing because you referred to instancing as garbage. That's what Scorpio was saying. Plus, your grammar is WHY he or she responded to your damned post the way they did, so them then telling you to learn how to use grammar isn't part of some straw man argument. It's DIRECTLY related to the issue they have with your post. Also, you're assuming a hell of a lot.

Please. Show me where I've downvoted you, dumbass. I don't upvote OR downvote.

are they one time use?

I know right? Two of today's are camera ones.
---
Will do üôÇ
---
Specifically, target the north burrows entrance instead of the center of town so that you can get a bunch of violet, crimson, and cobalt flux as well as legendaries.
---
For bonus points, when the legendary vendor becomes available in game he will be walking distance from Harpers as well, for all your overencumbered one star hoarder trade in needs.
---
No shit, it's not just adjusting some sliders.But that's just what their level of incompetence seems like.Why are you too dumb to get the point?
---
Yeah man üôÇ
---
Only 5-6 legendarys? 
---
I got lost in that damn place, I suck at keeping my directions about me in those type places. Well, after an hour I was overloaded with well over 20 legendary items. 
---
Maybe it was just a fluke for me and several others running around down there, but holy fuck the wave of legendary creatures just kept coming.
---
u/Tybber42 said 
---
&gt;I think Bethesda is adding content for the average casual player, and this was it.
---
And they are right, I am uber casual, maybe log in 2 hours a night, and binge on some Saturdays. This place is a nice treat, I'm going to find myself farming it for a while until I can me a fancy weapon worth bragging about.
---
and thank you all for the feedback so far, been great help. I just wish they have better description on them
---
It‚Äôs a bit of an issue due to the age rating of the game and because I stream on twitch dude üôÇ
---
You think it makes you sound more intelligent if you call others stupid?
---
Let me guess you're a liberal?

"*The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault  Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.  If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles.*"
---
A direct quote.
---
I ran it for the first time last night, and there was a lvl 38 player in excavator armor doing great on his own with a combat shotgun (no, it wasn't explosive, but could have been instigating, 2shot or some other effect).  We waved at each other and went on our merry ways.
---
I think the only real disappointment I had was the shared experience with the server.  I stepped in as two other players were doing the end fight, and&gt;! immediately knew that I'd be fighting gutsies and assaultrons at some point, because i could hear the gutsies talk and my screen went red from the assaultron beam!&lt;.
---
Personally I really liked the location, which is &gt;!vast, maze-like and really dark, which suits my sniper just fine.  (if only land mines didn't disappear after 5 seconds, I'd be setting up traps and ambushes everywhere.)!&lt;  I look forward to adding it to my legendary farming locations.  I didn't get any enemies above one star, but that doesn't mean I didn't just have a bad spawn "roll".
---
The story &gt;!wasn't particularly compelling, though.  Really basic and seemed slapped together.  2/10 for story 9/10 for environment!&lt;.
---
Has anyone found a use for the &gt;!mushrooms!&lt;?
---
Oh, my bad
---
Should refresh shortly..
---
*spoiler for those who have to completed the quests:
---
After I completed all the quests I had plans for mounted stag, owlet, yagoi, and a wolf. One of newest quests adds an additional mount.

Lame. Well in that case please just make sure to enclose the river banks to the east of harpers ferry. My house is right there and just southeast of the dam are two megasloth spawn points so I love it when they're glowing.
---
So you should expect it to be extremely disappointing.
---
You are really doing Bethesda favors here by informing the players that all content that's about to be put out will be disappointing garbage aimed at low level players.
---
Because fuck anyone who actually plays this game and wants end game content after 6 months, they are just a vocal minority and should get a life amirite.
---
To be fair they had energy weapons and you know how useful they are.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great when we drop an item it would be into an Easter egg instead of the paper bag
---
I love my shotgun. One shot for leg and nobody is a threat anymore
---
2 for 2.. Oh they're on fire..
---
Yea the current build i have now for PvE fights can take the hits of the squatch easily. But the hard part is keeping him on me at all times so the melee can come in and slap his butt till he blows up.
---
That pendulum swings both ways, and there are mindless critics sprinkled in here as well. Both sides poison the well on any objective critique or praise for the game.
---
Glad to know I‚Äôve been dropping similar pieces into the void when I could have been selling them for caps on caps.  I would take the shotgun trade if you don‚Äôt have an explosive one though. Great for survival if that‚Äôs your cup of tea.
---
This is what they wanted probably since the ghouls are much harder now for lower levels.
---
That's bear-ly legal.
---
When I remade my piece that was missing the other day, I ended up with a full duplicated set. I tried to store it all for this very thing to happen again, but it all just disappeared. I still have an extra Left Leg now though which was the piece that always disappeared. Funny enough it was now my Right Arm that disappeared most recently...
---
The game has been out for over 6 months, i play an hour or two during weekdays and maybe a few more during weekends and im lvl220.
---
You sir are just a prick
---
Bethesda quoting Dave Chappelle, "Got ya bitch!"
---
Yeet...i used it and typed it, why? Because Merika.
---
I get 2 minutes from the moment I click join world to the moment I‚Äôm
---
Running around fully rendered , same
---
Goes for any other loading screen, this is the real reason I don‚Äôt go inside buildings
---
They sent one guy - a scribe, without PA to investigate.  Of course they failed!
---
Yep :(
---
Its the true vault number of the vault we came from.
---
Two scenarios.
---
1: make friends, ask if they'll help you level up a new character.
---
2: help someone level a character, and then see if they'll return the favor.
---
Also, you can load up on molotovs and just tag along behind higher level players. They're great for grabbing little bits of xp kind of all will nilly.
---
Holy smokes r/iamverysmart
---
it doesn't necessarily mean you need to balance it so only a certain build can beat it. Also you don't have to beat certain areas, and having things that are extremely challenging gives the game replayability. Once you beat it with a super op meta build, you can challenge yourself with an off meta build. The fact that nothing like this exists in the game currently means a large population of players do not have anything in the game that's at an adequite difficulty for builds bethesda allowed to be in thier game.
---
That sucks to hear.  Conversely, I damn near always just drop what the person wants on the ground and leave it to faith they will pay after they pick it up. I haven't been burned yet, it will probably happen one day, but the point is that a lot of good people are out there.
---
No, that message is connected to the current bug where you can‚Äôt apply premade mods.
---
\&gt; my counter point would be why should *the players* willfully allow the game 
---
\&gt; company to move forward to set this precedent that one-day only, limited time, 
---
\&gt; login-each-day-to-receive-a-reward-or-miss-out items as acceptable practices? 
---
We accept that exact premise on any number of games.
---
Do you play any games on your phone / ipad?  
---
  Many of them offer in-game rewards of some type for playing daily, some scale rewards for mutiple consecutive day logins.  (For equivalence, they award Atoms)
---
Others offer both - daily challenges with random rewards, as well as a daily bonus.
---
Cool. What does whining on reddit achieve bearing in mind no one really cares
---
It's funny because they admitted yesterday that it was a mistake, yet they did nothing to fix it. Be ready we're gonna get these challenges up until the camera actually releases.
---
"Descend into new underground locations" is literally all the trailer promised in this regard.
---
Sounds like jet
---
I wish the legendary vendor let us transfer legendarys to a similar item.
---
Like legendary armor to armor, legendary heavy weapon to heavy weapon, legendary two handed melee to a two handed melee, legendary rifle to a rifle and so on.
---
1 legendary 5k caps, 2 legendaries 10k caps, 3 legendaries 15k caps.
---
Oh it's the best but another warning weapons break too fast especially the auto gernade launchers
---
Nah,you're just to dumb to get the joke that's all.
---
oh, thanks.
---
But drinking and killing and using drugs it‚Äôs ok ?
---
You can collect actual power armor plans. Not mods, real pieces. That's why I do them.
---
So you'd want the one real challenge regarding the MQ to be neutralized.  Do you see now why there's virtually no challenges in the game?  Everyone wants a way to neutralize the difficult parts.  How about try to dodge it and use skill?
---
Same for "Wrong Highway" and "Don't Fence me in". When those come on I get a guaranteed mood boost till the end.
---
This is how I've been looking at it myself, if the plan is for Fallout 76 to be a years-long experience with constantly evolving content, there's really no better way to set things up than this. 
---
Starting with a huge, lush, comparatively blank slate of a world means they have more options to expand on the lore down the road. Sure, everyone's dead now - but why? We at least get to know the answer to that, and get set up to deliver a little revenge on behalf of the people who failed. But then what? Anything, that's what. 
---
WV is still green (maybe too green, thanks Mire) and capable of supporting healthy, stable human life. Sure it's dangerous, but it's better than living in a crater - so we can see refugees/raiders/survivors coming in later. We could meet new factions entirely, or even create some. But it's not something that can be rushed into being. 
---
The real issue is that Bethesda need to show us, quickly, and earnestly, what game they really intend this to be. They need to come out and address posts like these.
---
This! How am I meant to enjoy the game when my min/maxed build with overpowered weapons that turns the game into a leaf blowing simulator is just as effective in the level 50 content?!
---
*Shocked Vault Boy face*
---
-eats popcorn-
---
I am a Scribe from the Discord Brotherhood, Alpha Squad, the Wraiths). And a stealth crit rifleman. Some of our best pvp players are not Pallies ;)
---
I feel like the only way i dont wanna go for enmity generation or aggro related buffs/nerfs is through perk cards. Unless they change the perk card system up some since it would ruin my currently PvE build the way it is atm for my must have perks.
---
I mean, caps are pretty easy to come by.  Make 1400 a day just selling junk to vendors, eat grape mentats, a beer, a sweet roll and swap in 3 ranks of hard bargain, maybe put on a couple unyielding armor pieces after standing next to a toxic waste barrel and that card drops in price considerably.  I do the same thing with any other high ticket item.
---
Oooooh yes, lets make this about politics. Fucking idiot.
---
No, I'm not a liberal. I only vote for the person running whose ideals match my own. You bringing that into this, which has absolutely no bearing on this entire thread, shows how much of a child you are. I'm TRYING to hammer into your chromium-thick skull that you are using words you do not understand the meaning to. This is the last time I'm going to respond to this incessant childish crying, because I have better things to do with my morning than talk with a child about things he clearly does not understand. I will not listen to any more of your points. I am blocking you and moving on. Go back to school.
---
Did ye aye
---
Oh yes indeedy. So annoying cause we need our Atoms. I log on daily at least to do dailies.
---
Despite the community's response to the Burrows, I think Fallout 76 is still moving in the right direction. The last couple months of posts have been a complete 180 than what it has been experiencing the first 80% of it's life.
---
And I'm super happy about this. I won't even be touching the burrows probably for at least another month...as I've not even made it to Harper's Ferry. But! What the burrows DID give us apparently is a pretty awesome place to Nuke. I have very little experience in Nuke zones, but I feel like that should account for something!
---
Pretty sure they already have this planned, but not quite the way u might expect
---
I'm going to give it a few more days for people to stop going there before I go into it for the first time.  I don't want the experience ruined by someone already there finishing the quest.
---
I guss by them I need to used my credit card then lol!
---
Obviously it wasn't an accident by the developer to not include NPCs... No one thinks they just forgot to put them in.
---
I do think that not having NPCs was a poor choice on their part and can only assume it was because they didn't want to have quest NPCs that could either respawn and break immersion or force players into separate instances depending on quest choices made.
---
As far as ambiance goes, knowing from the very beginning that all the NPCs are going to be dead makes it less impactful overall. Even just coming across a few survivors who are barely making it by would give a modicum of hope to the players that they might find a living settlement or something out there other than dead NPCs who all conveniently kept journals or holotapes.
---
Spoken like a true shill. Read what they said again. Bethesda started the hype. This is something a low level with normal gear can do
---
There are more enemies in the town that are harder to get to and have a decent mix of ranged and melee abilities. I've had prolonged firefights in Harpers Ferry even at level 200+ with decent equipment
---
I claim them, build a couple extractors... a couple turrets. Fight off the first wave of attacks. Take my crap, scrap everything I built, and leave. I never try claiming them for the long haul. 
---
Sometimes, I'll leave an extractor running while I do my thing somewhere else, and come back to claim stuff, if it hasn't been taken over.
---
Super lame troll if so. It's a rumour I read on this site of a possible work around.
---
Honestly I just find more DR unnecessary. In PvP, sure, but for the queen - it already takes her 4-5 melee hits to kill me. I'd have to drop either a carry weight perk or one of my heavy weapons damage boost perks for blocker. I might drop Travelling Pharm for it if I ever get around to muling the 200 diluted /regular / super stimpacks I have and all the water etc. Dodgy is also OK, but I generally don't stand in front of the queen eating her hits - that lowers my dps as well, and I like to have plenty of AP to use vats to quickly target / pick off random mobs to keep Adrenaline stacks rolling. I have an "Empath bot" set up on my second account (25% DR), so I don't use Lone Wanderer. Absolutely for Sheepsquatch or pvp though, it's necessary to run all of that, but I run a very different build on survival, and I generally don't take my level 342 there, or if I do, it takes like an hour of muling beforehand to transfer off 99% of the aid items.
---
I stand by my previous statments, I think they should wait and see how the Vaults work out for them.
---
Tse is overkill. I 1 shot the ghouls with a 35 Insta lever action. Saves on ammo as well
---
god damn imagine shilling this hard is just sad.
---
With how annoying the trading system can be, I don‚Äôt blame you for going the easy route. This is the first time this has happened to me so I‚Äôm not going to let it discourage me‚Äîeveryone else I‚Äôve worked with has been amazing. Even made a couple friends out of it!
---
I'm so sorry that you're going through this dude, but keep fighting the good fight. As the grown child of this situation with kids of my own, know that it never stops mattering. She will always be better for having you in her life, and when you can't be, knowing that you love her enough to fight for her will matter too, at every lifestage. Don't let this break you. Good luck!
---
No, they said in an interview 2 weeks ago the Burrows was a high level dungeon. Pretty sure at this point, Todd has moved on to Starfield, and basically pops his head in once in awhile to check on this game.
---
I didn't see the BoS as facists, I saw them more as isolationist idealists with heavy firepower. They don't care about leading or controlling anything other than advanced technology, which they genuinely believe nobody else can handle safely. And if you look at the factions they've been in opposition to over the games, they're not generally \*wrong\* about that.
---
pretty sure you aren't allowed to run scripts of that type in FO76 due to obvious abuse.
---
In their own MMO, ESO, they call things on this scale delves, while dungeons are what we would expect.
---
you are right, it was changed drastically, and it staring to impact my enjoyment of the game
---
having to stop and eat 7 full sized steaks every 20 minutes is ridiculous.  its not even realism, one steak should last for hours and hours, and if i ate 7 steaks back to back id be good for a day at least
---
i constantly and throwing out expired food and drinks now, its just too much
---
BUT the good thing is, soon we can but soemething in the ATOMs tore to slow down the food spoilage! only 1000 atoms!
---
It‚Äôs pay to win. If I can buy tokens with cash to improve an existing weapon or armor so that I can have an advantage, that is the definition of pay to win.
---
Damn i was excited till PC. On PS4 :(. Totally woulda bought!
---
But the penalty for PvP in cap loss is greater in Adventure than Survival mode. Should be the same or less IMHO. The point of PvP with Workshops is to claim the workshop, not eliminate the player and walk away. The player who contested the workshop isn't even required to then claim ownership of the workshop.
---
I doubt they will work on Power Armors though :(
---
I'm seriously not trying to be an asshole, but I got a huge laugh out of the misspelling the word "competent".  I'm sure it was an accident, but it is fantastically ironic.  I gave you a thumbs up for that, plus I agree with you.
---
And as direct and flowery as that quote is... It doesn't match any of the expectations people built up for the thing. They never promised instanced content and nothing about "loot" explicitly screams "endgame three star legendary gear".
---
This is marketing talk for a multiplayer game, if they'd advertised it as "You know it's a dungeon sorta. You could go on with a friend or something if you want. Whatever, you'll get some junk out of it or something" then someone would have gotten fired.
---
I can see people just setting at the vendor and then AFKing and moving every so many minutes just to troll people
---
Had a whole sing along with a few randoms. Was awesome :D
---
Normally when the current days limiteds are over the next batch comes in fir me its 8pm when it freshes
---
Uhhh.  No.  Its way too powerful in its current form.
---
This is really the meat of it. They just need to advertise it for what it is.
---
I want you in my room!
---
In 4, they really felt like the end result of the fractioning that was evident over the span of the previous games. The benevolent idealist leaders that felt like helping humanity was the right thing to do were all dead (Lyons, etc.) they were facing a threat that was exactly the kind of thing the order was created to confront (Institute technology) and were far more "means to an end" focused than they had been in the past.
---
Huh that‚Äôs weird. I really expected them to add it in once the burrows were added. I guess we have to wait until next update? They hVe the paint the in dev room which I know for sure.
---
Bethesda themselves are the ones that called this a "dungeon" and hyped it up as such.Stop trying to cover up their incompetence.Arktos Pharmacy will be more of the same drive,it'll just be 150 ghouls instead of 50.
---
It will still be a mindless shooting gallery,just like every other location in this game.
---
There is one huge problem though: You could put unused junk/legendaries in the auction, set a ridiciously high price and there you go, you have your mule.
---
Burrows are open?
---
The original does that. Not the cover.
---
Sounds lame to me. 
---
Most bethesda games are sub par until the modding community fixes them. They need to just release private servers and modding, game could be great. This game has almost no end game, with questing almost entirely unrewarding. Quest usually offer a crap reward. The only rewarding aspect of the game is farming legendaries. It is a bad design, if you want people to do quest and put the pieces of the story puzzle together you need to make it rewarding.
---
Not difficult I did it with vanilla level 30 with no legendaries lol I did die once but it was my fault as I ran inside a tunnel with 4 ghouls and got trampled.
---
Other then that I die more at whitesprings lol, I do like the city look and the steady flow but yes easy easy I imagined 10 floors of tunnels going down and with only one exit kinda like star dew valleys dungeons 
---
Not an empty settlement lol
---
What a stupid answer. Do you even understand what I asked? I don't want to keep my finger like that for aiming down the sight. It has been a normal feature on most of the first person shooters in 20 years.
---
Oh wow never thought of this, would be amazing. Better then getting pwned by a random high lvl out of no where in survival mode lol.
---
Yes. But isn't the point of PvP surrounding workshops to takeover a workshop? If your workshop is contested, the player that challenges you doesn't even have to finish the claim, they can walk away after killing you. You are still stuck with the workshop unless you leave the server. You contest a workshop, you should be automatically awarded it if you eliminate the owner. Seems reasonable to me.
---
its another baffling decision by bethesda for sure
---
Real sheep squash is coming in a few weeks.
---
Two ? I only got the waste maganment one
---
Awesome job dude. If these are all vanilla assets can this be uploaded to console mods too? If those are still a thing?
---
Guess whoever gets into that situation better run like hes on fire then lol.
---
Bought the bunny the second I saw it. It‚Äôs so cute!
---
Me too :)
---
Had 16 tons come on during the firefighter quest in the burning mine.  Was wondering if it was an explicit trigger as I recall Convoy coming on the radio in GTA V at such a perfect moment in a mission that it just had to be coded to do that.
---
You should expect it to be what is explicitly advertised and nothing more. They up sold the difficulty and Multiplayer aspect but NEVER promised there would be raid tier end game content, let alone instanced dungeons, during Wild Appalachia.  That's literally listed during the Nuclear Winter season with "High level vault raids".
---
It loses its luster when everyone is pretty newly dead too. I‚Äôm fine with them being dead, but all of these people are freshly dead? Kinda weird
---
I second the free atoms equivalent to what we lose with these camera dailies.
---
I used Google microphone to ask what song is playing.
---
I want the radio tab to put song and person in that blank spot so we'd know what is playing
---
Cool story bro! Brb using my imagination since no pics.
---
Guess if that happens instead the character can make a run for it instead showing we aren't gods but regular people.
---
Still cant use the separate mod?
---
Thats good, thought it was a hoax but even then kinda of sad its just a reskinned deathclaw.
---
Have you tried restarting your PS4?
---
What's you talking anout bro??? That dungeon was to keep us occupied till the summer &amp; the "vault raids" begin 
---
Honestly I'm cringinging thinking about how half arsed they will make that... 
---
Will prob recycle 90% of vault 76's area with minor changes &amp; put a few enemies in. 
---
 let's not go nuts &amp; give beth more work to do! 
---
Donate our money but FFS don't ask for value for it. 
---
I'm just gonna say it...
---
This game is shite! 
---
I've been playing &amp; trading religiously for 6 months now &amp; honestly 4 months have been spent peddling a deed horse hoping the next update would... 
---
I dunno? It's just not been great from day one.
---
 &amp; that borrows shite has crushed any love I had left for bethesda &amp; fallout franchise 
---
So far their after release "content" has been embarrassing. 
---
The alcohol quest, fachnut parade, now this shite ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
---
Repetitive, shite rewards, fachnut bombing &amp; no one getting good masks, burrows feels like something they picked up off the cutting room floor. 
---
Didn't make the grade fist time, but clutching at straws so needs must. Get it added.
---
There are only two 'resources' that one cannot acquire several orders of magnitude faster outside workshops:
---
- 100% charge Fusion Cores.
---
- Pre-war (thus 'radless') Packaged Food.
---
Anything else: lead, acid, ammo, ballistic fibre, whathaveyou can be accrued elsewhere much more efficiently.
---
Now one could argue 'why not do both? Surely this is peak efficiency!' however the devs have made it abundantly clear that workshop =/= free stuff.
---
As u/FritoZanzibar points out (and quite eloquently describes) there is a potential exploitative abuse of the mechanic however the scenario you describe seems to me ' working as intended'.
---
Yes. Also, if you lose the engagement, the workshop automatically transfers to the victor, they shouldn't be able to just walk away. If you challenge for a workshop, you will either win it or lose it.
---
Agreed, and also agreed on how they are closer to the original west coast BoS. It amazes me how many people were surprised by their turn back to their original mission.
---
Not for any I've played. Every single FPS game I've played was "hold to aim".
---
Is this the first one?
---
Who are u to say what the point is
---
Ouch, I know that was painful....
---
its for reasons like that, and not wanting to lose it in a disappearing death bag bug or somone else picking it up... 
---
I store  "important" junk : screws, gears, stable flux, black titanium, ultracite, scorchbeast bones), hardened mass,  hi-rad fluids, and a few other things
---
in my stash ASAP after I gather (for stable flux, craft) them.
---
(Yea, I learned that the hard way)
---
I'm hoping that they'll open some of the collapsed tunnels eventually and we'll have access to more cool stuff!
---
The Sons of Dane aren‚Äôt dead!  They just set up a radio warning and got out.  They‚Äôre coming back to have a beer with me.  They are!  They‚Äôre alive *starts to weep*
---
Perk cards would be perfect. One set, just three ranks, to increase aggro generated multiplicatively to the damage dealt, and another doing the inverse. This would allow flexibility in the roles chosen as well, for instance if your tank is not online and you still want your group to be able to run some instances.
---
This would have been a good time to introduce a PA'd scorched brother, or a PA wearing ghoul.
---
Too bad we just got more stupid robots.
---
Or a basket filled either Easter eggs.
---
There is, in the Savage Divide, &gt;!the body of a ranger with his dog, in a cage. They have been kidnapped by raiders!&lt;. That body has a dog helmet so probably it's not a copy paste, it is put there on purpose
---
3 month bragfest? What the fuck are you talking about? They announced the Roadmap barely 2 months ago in late February and they never even mentioned the burrows until Mid-March when they started to detail what was in the Wild Appalachia update. Stop fucking lying. It was because idiots like you who overhype and over-exaggerate that expectation get so fucking off kilter. Just because some games use dungeon to mean one thing doesn't mean every other game has use the same terminology.
---
It's funny that you think they can just flip a switch and fix it. These challenges were added to the servers with the the last patch and they're going to keep popping up until the next patch or hotfix.
---
Let's be honest.  When a 76 player hears "loot", they don't think junk scrap, random ammo and miscellaneous food. They think legendary items, or possibly outfits and plans.
---
I've modded several.  Legendary effects remain intact
---
These people scare me IRL.
---
I could have sworn I had tried to in the past week or so.
---
&gt;So much this. The Brotherhood doesn't want control, they don't want the world to burn again because of runaway science and abuse of technology, which really makes sense given what the world of fallout has been through.
---
Really down voting because claiming silos are easy?  They is nothing special about them, the only foe that ever gave me issues were the assualtron dominator that sometimes spawns down there.   This is before any special legendaries were even obtained in the game.  It was a .50 I found on the back of the truck up in the Toxic Area.
---
I am a tank.  I run 10 feet and my ap is done.  I am bait.
---
The game has near 6 months out. Level 100+ ARE the majority of the player base, and for one level 50, the dungeon is already easy if he uses strategy and the tools the game gives you (stealth, multiple weapons to switch when you have to reload, chems). The dungeon is easy and there's no way you can deny it. If you play foolishly then you'll die, and that's not difficult, it's just as the rest of the game.
---
Any benefit?
---
But shouldn't the workshop then be theirs since they contested for it and killed the owner?
---
I‚Äôve just tried that, but it didn‚Äôt fix it, unfortunately.
---
yes.
---
But this was not something that was advertised. I didnt expect a raid and have never stated i was. I was expecting a difficult dungeon for seasoned players that well geared +50lvl solo players could tackle. They didnt deliver, but based on your replies to other comments nothing is going to make you believe anything i say because im a stupid gamer who should have known betheda lies alot
---
&gt;The real issue is that Bethesda need to show us, quickly, and earnestly, what game they really intend this to be. They need to come out and address posts like these.
---
I think that for the time being, the small teaser paragraph for Wastelanders is as much as they can responsibly give us without risking failing to deliver on promises. Those few sentences though...really make it sound like that update will finally deliver a full narrative experience.
---
You weren't over leveled,it was supposed to be for 2 50+ characters,their "dungeon" was just underdeveloped.
---
On stage they talked about instanced dungeons of Arktos.
---
Inside the vault referenced it as a dungeon and shouldn't have. That was an unforced error. They should have just called it a quest.
---
I‚Äôll always make the argument that the game would have been way better if Bethesda could have included actual NPCs (not the walking holotapes that are Rose, MODUS, etc.) with dialogue trees and some deeper interaction.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs system wasn‚Äôt necessarily a bad idea in concept, but they really needed to support it more to make it work (party up by faction, *some* dialogue trees, unique faction benefits and perks, etc).
---
The text when you contest a workshop
---
To be honest after level 50 I cant notice any difference in damage or build. All necessery perks for my build I did get by lvl 50, later on I did invest only in secondary perks really. Apart from loot, that improved with higher levels, there is literally no difference between lvl 50 and lvl 400 etc
---
You want it soon and a wild buggy appeared which consume all the legendary without pay you anything back.
---
Dude, chill. We want a working system with less bug.
---
It's actually only been out 5 months and 3 days...
---
Lucky I wish I was english, also sorry for my poor writing skills I speak American and also the Wendigos in game also speak American too so I feel right at home.
---
That was the best
---
Does anyone know what the special price is for collecting all the eggs?
---
something like that . I use a 308 or 50 sniper . long shot means long reach (really long reach) . 1 in sniper keeps you steady.wallup. if med range, dont need long shot,but sniper still keeps you steady.
---
closing - and in no's -switch to 5.56 or 45 , close quarters 5.56 high rate of fire, or 45,shot gun,tesla shot gun, vats at this point optional , oh yeah,there's the gauss (which will miss in vats,probably)
---
hand to hand- rifle = useless -sw to allrise.
---
most don't get to closing.most don't know where you are,they know which direction but I'm still outside their detection range, they cant see me in sneak and they die.Thats what snipers do.
---
you may do it differently and you can always swap out if you know your going to whitesprings for example. Long shots usually the first out
---
and no pvp
---
I used to love the egg timer on the mini nuke gun or the whistle on the railroad spike gun
---
The only reason i dont want to go with perk cards being a solution is that it genuinely would mean i would have to sacrifice my already needed skills of being a tank to accommodate for enmity generation. Unless they rework the perk card system, thatd be the one way i wouldnt want it to go.
---
Nitpicking makes your argument extremely solid
---
Good man, we will remember your sacrifice.
---
It has refreshed but I can't see any new item.
---
SAME. I scavenge in isolated parts of the map too so I have more of a chance to pick up my loot if I die too. Can‚Äôt be too careful!
---
I just jumped on, it is the first one still. It is called "Flowery Deathclaw Easter Egg." It has an orange Stipe in the center with yellow flowers.
---
I have no problem one shotting things myself.  The problem is that if "that dude" is ahead of you, they're going to kill everything before you can.
---
My little "revenge tactic" is to let them spend time killing everything in the golf club, equip my instigating super sledge and run towards either the maintenance building or artisan's way and do them the same by killing everything before they can.  Small favors.
---
It's a overwrite system. The game will ask you to have enough space for everything but the game has always been about 55 gb.
---
COUNTRY ROADSSSSSS
---
That sounds pretty fun, like after getting to a certain thresh hold of killing in PvP there is a "Bigger fish" that comes out and wants to play.
---
I'd try to look on the brighter side of this and see all the possibility for new content.
---
An MMO needs to start with room to grow. An empty launch map is counter-intuitively a positive thing, IMO.
---
They had heavy losses from the scorched so all they had to spare were scribes. Those brave pencil pushers were the last line of defense between capitlism and communism. Mourn their loss.
---
Did they say there'd be raids at launch?
---
Well time to go home "sick" and play more fallout I shall rain ammo on eveything
---
Is a... peculiar distinction the game makes between successfully taking down the current owner and successfully contesting the workshop.
---
This was raised quite a few time with the devs - and again eloquently documented by someone - and nothing has changed despite the fact that they were swift to patch the 'fortifying the workshop' conundrum - clearly to the detriment of the workshop 'owner' may I point out - so I have to surmise that is 'working as intended'.
---
In the end of the day they want the workshops to be fuel for conflct so I guess they are prepared to make some... sacrifices towards that goal?
---
Okay. So this is what I through together. [Chem Taking Sniper](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d544ef&amp;d=ik0ic2lv2lk2lt2lr2pl1pp2pk1pd1p01c72eg1es2ar1an2a72ao0s00&amp;w=p60pr0a51at1l71sb0&amp;n=&amp;m=). The SPECIAL stats are pretty set. Typically snipers have high perception and agility. You also need high luck for the crit perks. And since you want to be taking chems, you have to have a higher than average endurance stat, so unfortunately that's taking away from maxing the main 3 stats, but it should be fine still. 
---
I've applied the bare minimums for the perks. The perk cards that are underneath are recommended but not necessary depending on your play style. And even some of the stats can be moved around too. Say for example you didn't want lone wander (though it's nice for less damage and AP regen). Sneak is at 2 because some people say that's all you need. I prefer 3 ranks, but if you're staying back farther and sniping then the enemies shouldn't see you. Gunsmith is at 3 only because that's all you need for weapon mods. Having it at rank 5 could be nice for better durability. Each of the rifleman perks are at rank 2 for an extra 45% damage. But if you want that 60% boost then you can increase them to rank 3. Strength is the unused stat and you can use whatever perk you want. And I didn't include any of the explosive perks since you said you changed your mind on that.
---
‚ÄúOther players may initiate PvP with you by attempting to Claim it from you!‚Äù
---
Attempting..
---
You have two options.
---
1. Dont claim workshops
---
2. Walk around crouched and be prepared to watch you back
---
Haha defensive much?
---
Did it once.
---
Got the Imposter Head on my first try.
---
Satisfied with that and have no plans to ever do it again unless I happen to be right next to it when it starts.
---
I mean,  with a bunch of tattoo guns going,  you might not have heard him
---
It looks way better in 76 than it did in 4, with 4 having a butt ugly yellow color, but I agree that a pristine skin would be awesome.
---
There's never a payoff to hype. You shouldn't be hyping anything. Have you been a human being for long?
---
While I absolutely love John Denver‚Äôs version, there‚Äôs something about Copilot‚Äôs voice that just sounds much more country to me.
---
There are two other quests added. One is at Toxic Larry‚Äôs Meat and Greet. It‚Äôs a short one that gives you a recipe. The other starts with a note on a table near the police protectorn in the Southern Belle Motel. It was a nice little short quest, with a good plan as a reward.
---
Don't forget that one "journalist" who couldn't get past the airdash in the Cuphead tutorial.
---
Same.
---
After the burrows my hopes for the purveyor are so low that if he/she/it doesn‚Äôt take my legendary and kill me, i‚Äôll be thankful.
---
Audio is poor for the creatures IMHO. You walk in a multi level building and can hear the Scorched or whatever three stories up, and I‚Äôm certain they can hear you as they all come running.
---
I still like it, but it is just to often, the Radio needs more different songs.
---
And being wrong makes your argument strong?
---
Well to see if I‚Äôm the only one A. and B. to bring it to the attention to anyone reading through reddit.
---
First if all. You need to calm the fuck down dude. I dont know if thats how you talk to your momma, but if you cant take someone talking to you about a game we both enjoy then get off the reddit. 
---
Secondly i have played this game from day 1 and have ALWAYS defended it. The DUNGEON talk, has been around for months, this was a QUEST , not a dungeon. You can blindly convince yourself its different all you want, its not going to change the fact that it is what it is. If you think a 10 minute quest with no boss is a DUNGEON, thats fine. But you are alone on that island, and should not be getting lippy with the other 99.99 percent who disagree with you. 
---
Once again , this is bethesda. They know what a dungeon is. This isnt one. Im sorry if you feel different, just next time dont be such an ass.
---
It‚Äôs dark as a dungeon, and damp as the dew. Where danger is double, and pleasures are few.
---
ok thats too long  30s is about right for me,suggest you have a close look at your console or drive
---
It wasn't an "unforced error" what a stupid term...they billed and hyped it as a dungeon for 2 50+ characters.You fan boys are even coming up with your own terms to defend this crap now,lol.
---
Well guess what? If you keep making excuses for them and defend the crap they are shoving on us,that's all you are gonna get.More of the same crap.Until we put our foot down and tell them we aren't happy with this level of effort.THIS IS ALL WE ARE GONNA EVER GET,a lazy uninspired piece of crap DUNGEON.
---
Not worth a hotfix? I spend A LOT of time crafting weapons, changing mods etc. Because of the weight limit i can't use my new X-01 and it's a pain in the ass. I got to use the excavator for everything and i gotta say it doesn't have the best stats. And i can't add any mods, can't make it more agile, i can't use a lot of weapons, because they suck without mods, i honestly can't play the game and you're saying it's not worth a hotfix? Well i guess it's bethesda and most bugs aren't worth fixing to them apparently...

Yea they just have to find a way to make it work
---
I can hear him from outside the room but when in it I can barely hear him at all
---
I did the same. Only other thing than the terminal was an interesting piece of environmental art which was a book I think.
---
Geckos and Gamma Radiation: The Key To Prolonged Life"
---
Had a couple quotes that were readable "Just one drop of Gecko blood contains enough DNA to give a worm two legs and a backbone."
---
And
---
"In the future we'll all look in the nirri and see the face of a lizard."
---
Doubt it's important but fun nonetheless.
---
TO THE PLACE
---
What is the ideal placement of ground zero?  I‚Äôve got a few keycards to burn.
---
I think that if the burrows was a bit denser its difficulty would be more accurate to the hype. 
---
I went in way overconfident and died once because I was absolutely fucking around.
---
I think most of the disappointment comes from the lack of any complex/difficult "Boss" like the Sheepsquatch. 
---
Still, that other post was right. Even though in MMO/MMO-Lites "Dungeon" typically means an instanced, difficult area with a boss, Elder Scrolls/Fallout have called any name, indoor, enemy populated location "Dungeons" going back to Morrowind. 
---
My main complaint about The Burrows is that it feels too big compared to enemy density, but I'm excited to nuke it later because supposedly that's great.
---
Shit, I'd run that one for sure.
---
Yes they are. I‚Äôve ran through a couple times now but haven‚Äôt done it nuked. That‚Äôs the next plan at least. A couple legendary ghouls down there...
---
I hear that period another thing that I think some newer players especially are struggling with is the dying aspect. Just die and respwan and get back in the fight everybody!
---
Yep... I finally managed to get the jetpack for my X-01 armor.. and then realized I can't attach it yet. Grr.
---
There are 2 different plans. The rusty, and the metal. Both plans have same price and title, however the metal one can only be purchased from Graham. Not guaranteed he will have the plan when you find him though.
---
Says the Sexy Sewer Strangler...... were on to you
---
Kay Kyser is a hell of an artist. He‚Äôs the one who sang ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got Spurs‚Äù in New Vegas.
---
Whats so good about the fixer ? Is it even legendary ? Alsdo the Sole Survivor is really good, 10% to players 10% whilst aiming, and 1 other star, I think damage resistance whilst aiming or reloading, its not bad Lever action, handy for survival but not as good as my 3\* Zealots explosive Pipe Rifle, those things are OP atm.
---
It has to be perks though. There is no other flexible system in the game and no clearly defined classes or match making. If you need a designated tank (which would be awesome) you cant be left sitting around with your collective thumb up your asses waiting for one on your friend's list to be online. Know what I mean? Also, in all other MMOs (I know this isnt an MMO but that is where the mechanic comes from) a tank DOES have to sacrifice their other abilities to become more resilient. The cool thing about the perk card system is that those sacrifices would be temporary and used situationally. 
---
I think it is the most elegant solution and the one with the least downside for any players that decide to accept that role.
---
Good for you. Thats a valuable lesson to learn. All companys do this and consumers should be educated. Youd be amazed what people will tell you to try and take your money.
---
And, the Easter eggs are free. Tough to complain about free.
---
Not beeing able to mod anything is game breaking bug and it is there for over 1 week now.
---
The only reason I take workshops is to have a convenient free fast travel point. I‚Äôll invest a little in resources, especially at power plants, but other than that it‚Äôs not really worth the effort
---
Know what would make this game better? A difficulty slider. In an old MMO called City of Heroes you could go to an NPC and tell them you want to be considered a part of 2-8 want it extra hard set yourself to 8 the spawns are a higher level and denser in spawn. I don't know how many times I've done feed the people solo and get maybe 4 mobs to kill in the 5 minute run time of the event. Let me set my self as 4 players and spawn larger mobs.
---
I can agree with that. I actually replaced quite a few songs in game with songs from older fallout games. That was the first song to go üòÇ
---
Yeah, you got an upvote for skewering the whiney man babies.
---
That brings me back to Fallout 3. Personally though, I prefer ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù
---
So many upvotes.
---
And im glad i noticed this at that point, before i was looking forward to new content and waiting for it to drop.
---
Now i couldnt care less, i have so much more time for something more productive.
---
No. I mean that when they introduced the Burrows, I don‚Äôt think they meant to hype it as a dungeon, when the only real use for it is as a nuke zone. Something tells me they didn‚Äôt really plan on it becoming the new nuke meta.
---
When all else fails...nuke the bastards.
---
Not just a smile! Burst out into song and sing that as loud as comfortably possible!
---
Its pretty cute tbh
---
Good point. Though there's no way to really rebuild the wasteland then. With zero permanency on the servers even killing the scorchqueen is a pointless endeavor. 
---
The problem is that it turns out that constantly going to new cool locations and seeing that everyone's dead and you cannot interact with anything/anyone is REALLY disheartening for players. And the way the game works, it's not like I can take over flatwoods and rebuild it. It's always going to be dead. I can't build there or rebuild there. And it's always going to be hit with the same recurring quests where robots surge out of the agro building. 
---
I really hope you're right and Wastelanders delivers something fantastic that brings the game more in line with what they originally promised us. If it doesn't I can see it killing what's left of the game as a lot of us are pinning out hopes on it.
---
Oh the delicious schadenfreude and bitter salty tears this would bring to the sub. We would drown in them.
---
Yeah i missed the date by 27 days, oh how much i was wrong and exaggerated everything.
---
I don't want to set the world on fire..
---
I know a lot of people don‚Äôt like that ‚ÄúWouldnt it be nice‚Äù is in this game, but the way it was used in the trailer was perfect. Because of that, I‚Äôm perfectly happy with it being in 76.
---
Word
---
It's a massive inconvenience, but it is not LITERALLY a threat of breaking the game.  The ONLY time they have ever rushed a hotfix through certification, and paid the massive cost for doing so, was when a bad merger of the dev builds overwrote a chunk of the game with an old patch and was enough of a threat to the stability of the games live build.
---
The Leviathan is easy as hell, you just need people who can stay alive and follow orders throughout. The only part where everyone needs to be able to solo their own part is the Bathhouse, since everyone needs to rotate in a specific order, without a rotation captain or leader. Gauntlet would also apply to this since 2 plates should work together to shoot the buttons, unless you are just doing to rotation strat. Dogs are just follow the leader, Calus is simply the leaders go into the shadow realm, and give the throne room people callouts on which psions to bitchslap.
---
There's an area encompassing Vault 76 and Flatwoods that's off limits, but everything else is fair game.
---
Truth be told, it‚Äôs SUPER easy to replace song files if you‚Äôre on pc. My radio has a lot of older songs replacing the newer ones.
---
No you don‚Äôt I‚Äôve done it before unless they changed it
---
Yes. I'm really digging Appalachia radio. Listen to those songs on Spotify in my car too. Hearing country roads just brings all the hyped and excited feelings back since it was used in the first teaser trailer. I was surprised they used a different version of country roads but I love it!
---
Surrender noted.
---
If you have a team you can do the log off and back on trick. Not sure if they patched it, but usually you can cause more spawns this way.
---
He‚Äôs very dead.
---
Cant they just do a patch now or a hotfix ?
---
And it took like 30 minutes to go between continents. Immersive, oh yeah? Also really tedious.
---
yeah because weapons all max out at level 50.
---
for my melee build I didn't feel I was really *done* until level 70. 
---
And if you're not buying perfect weapons on the market (or having some guy gift you duped stuff) but waiting for stuff to drop "naturally" you'll still see a gradual improvement as you get incrementally better legendaries.
---
‚Äú*ARE YOU FEEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS!?*‚Äù
---
Actually i built ABOVE the bunker. Nestled my house inside the tower.
---
Lol. That‚Äôs always the excuse stupid people use. Oh it was a joke. Making you stupid and a coward because you can‚Äôt even be honest about what was said.
---
Just different playstyles, which is cool. Medium range for me is VATS leg cripples if I'm tagging for a team, headshots for solo, no need to scope if they're within aggro range. I carry a lever for sniping, a bp rifle for mass 1-shot up front dmg , and a handmade for up close, so no hand-to-hand for me.
---
I do PvP and workshop defenses quite a bit.
---
Let‚Äôs just say, when I went back to play fallout 4, I missed Appalachia radio so much that I coded my first mod just to bring it to the Commonwealth
---
Yes, that's when what I quoted literally flashes on screen... and then it shows a bunch of people shooting at shit... and that's what they delivered.  It doesn't say "New end game super hard raid content!" or "New instanced dungeons!" or "Free legendary gear!" or anything like that.  Just that we're getting new underground locations.
---
Tried it, didnt work. Nuked the burrows and when i got there after my game crashed everything was already dead and only maybe 10 ghouls spawned when somebody else came there
---
So  a form of radical, right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power (the Maxson family appears in 76 as well), forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy  with a militarized society . Kill all supermutants, kill all ghouls, kill all synths. America for humans only.
---
No..not all company‚Äôs do this. Just bad ones.
---
I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre full of pleb :D
---
I use the pumpkin grenades and quote the green goblin from the OG Spider-Man
---
I just noticed it says 8 pm EDT on the website, so I guess it's not right now.
---
Yeah i'll never understand why they thought it's a good decision not to include human npc's
---
Wow that was a long post to read!
---
I agree pretty much with what you said. The burrow was supposed to be something new and exciting and its just another Ghoul run. 
---
No story amd nothing magical. 
---
If feel like they spent ages making the area, with a cool story in the back of their mind but then gave up on that and just rushed it out. 
---
People don't mind waiting for decent content. Why don't Bethesda see that?
---
It‚Äôs been there since launch, I‚Äôve been living there for a while.
---
The main question is, what tree would it be under? Does it fall under what special you already have or would you have to re spec everytime you want to tank? While i do get where youre coming from and understand it, if the said character doesnt have the special points allocated for that card, then it becomes more of a hassle to try and be versatile. However, to go with suggestion, i wonder how the future legendary perk cards would work. If they dont suck up your SPECIAL points, i can see this as being a means to do this but not as our current perk card system is atm.
---
This thread gets my approval, may 23 is way too far.
---
But still better than nothing...
---
But what if I play my trap card. *PS4 exclusives* üòÇüòÇ
---
My hope is Wastelanders &amp; Nuclear Winter become story modes you choose on game launch.
---
It may cause some lore issues with gear looking backward, like if you have a Wastelanders drop but are playing in the Original ‚Ä¶ but this is with every MMO.
---
Breaking it up like this would allow for harder tier challenges across the entire map. Like, Flatwoods starts at 58/62/68 level enemies post endgame nuke and the map gets harder from there. It could be scaled visually pretty well with just environmental effects/storms
---
Let me drop keys - **OR** - don't let me pick up duplicates.  I have so many duplicates because I don't remember every damned key I have.
---
Also, let me just drop them into storage or something.  I never need to look at them.  It's not like I have ever had to scroll through and actually *choose* a key.
---
I don't need them in my inventory.
---
I can drop notes, even mission required ones, so why not keys?
---
I was initially excited about the burrows, since it was just north of my CAMP, but now it looks like this is going to force me to move to a new location :(
---
If you move close to a red deathclaw you can select an option to "make friends".  It will then complete the quest and likely result in a deathclaw eating you while Rose laughs.  Be prepared!
---
In that case, I also have a pc!
---
Oh yeah even better
---
VAULT 69 CONFIRMED
---
/no, not really
---
Sorry, but that's the point of this quest. A robot named Rose, which is a raider, is trying to get you killed as a joke. None of these are actually able to be friends.
---
its the hot sauce method of making bad food better lol
---
I've seen elsewhere its located in the floor decor section, in the same slot that the deathclaw statue is located (after cycling through using left and right on the d-pad)
---
And frankly, there's SO much specific and non-procedural decoration stuff happening with most of the interiors. It's 100 times better than FO3, NV, and FO4 interiors in terms of deliberate designs for the interior stuff. I'd hire that design crew again in a second.
---
Bethesda : We're adding a new dungeon that's made to be a challenge for two level 50's or a single well geared level 50
---
r/fo76 : OMG we're getting an instanced dungeon that'll be a significant challenge for my level 200 fully equipped with all 3* gear that will take hours to complete and have cut scenes and unique legendaries and a new boss!!!!
---
Yeah, Bethesda really lied about that one. Also if you already had the game, and they added this in for free... And didn't even advertise it on the road map or any of the Wild Appalachia teaser material... How did they rip you off??
---
Agreed. Also i wished the animation to get in and out wouldn't take so long, or wasn't there at all but maybe that's just me.
---
I have a 3* machete that has a sacrificial mod on it making it 4*. Taking that mod off makes is 3* again. I assume mods are treated separate from the enchantment the weapon/armor has. I know this doesn't explain what is going to be destroyed, proceed with caution I suppose.
---
I am not commenting on FO76, but rather on the concept of End Game content.  
---
First of all, there is no single definition for what End Game content is. But the most common definition is that end game content is the content that comes after the point where leveling up is no longer the goal-- and other activities start taking over.   
---
Some players view things differently, and they define End Game as only the hardest and most reward content after hitting max level.  
---
For reference, a survey of players on mmo champions had 92 people chime in to say that they agreed that they felt all content after passing max level was end game rather than the more limited definition.  
---
FO76. however, sort of sits outside the norm. Players are running around in the hundreds of levels. Since most games have a hard cap, it's a little more difficult to define where The Burrows should fall into things.   
---
Personally, I think their intention is for it to serve as new end game content-- but that it will likely be just the start of that content and will not fall into the harder areas of where end game content will likely end up later down the line.
---
So basically you don't like the current game mechanics and you want it changed to your liking. Don't want to be killed in that situation? Don't claim a workshop. Seems like an easy solution.
---
I tried taking over a workshop yesterday during a defend event. The owner had numerous turrets positioned on the workshop bench which turned hostile once I initiated the takeover. 
---
Seems to me you need to rethink your strategy.
---
You shouldn't be able to contest during an event, pretty sure that changed with the patch..
---
yes, this is a great point, thank you
---
Aggro generation should be a STR perk and aggro reduction should be PER. Any tank perks relating to resilience should be under END.
---
Just saying telling people to drop items on  the ground sounds like a troll
---
You're a grenade tinkerer? You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
---
I have it as well and i'm on ps4 so get excited
---
Sorry, it's a single use object. It's stuck open forever now.
---
What I said was:
---
&gt;They released a trailer for wild Appalachia. Did we overhype it or did we buy into the hype?
---
I didn't say anything related to the points you're bringing up. But you got a crusade to run, so don't let me stop you
---
My guess is Nuclear Winter is going to be a Hardcore PvE Survival experience. Probably more rad storms, environmental dangers, maybe they'll add in temperature systems or something so you have to stay warm.
---
Wastelanders is supposedly narrative-driven. They're making it sound like it's the real decision/consequence Fallout story people have been complaining the game is missing.
---
Those are the tunnels I use to take as a lowbie and no caps to avoid the scorchbeast.
---
I don't envy them either. They just need to stop focusing on the people crying about their meta builds being nerfed or making the game to easy and just build a story for the majority of the players in 76 that want a relatively casual experience. If people bought this for a hardcore MMORPG experience then they fucked up
---
Also solid point on aftermarket guns. I'd hazard 70-80% of TSE weapons are the results of dupers. There just isn't much of a mathematical precedence for that many amazing rolls in a game 6 months after launch
---
Oh no, the "I'm not angry, you're angry" argument. Why would talking to some anonymous over-exaggerating jagoff equate in any way to talking to your mother? There's no point to sticking to a moral high ground on the internet during a 5 second conversation that nobody actually cares about. We're not going to change each other's minds. I'm just attempting to refute your bullshit argument. Alo, maybe you could be a little less hypocritical Mr. Random Capitalization.
---
The "dungeon talk" has always been about the Vault Raids. Nobody has known about the Burrows until a month ago. It's bullshit to call it a 3 month bragfest when all they did was real a free dungeon as they're games general calls these areas. Yeah the difficulty is exaggerated or at the very least inaccurate, but being so worked up over the what they call it is fucking stupid.
---
so silky
---
That's... really smart.
---
Haha!
---
1) It's a game they chose to play. They have no rights
---
2) How does picking low risk low reward targets make them cowards?
---
3) You seem to make some pretty aggressive and emotionally charged accusations about these people real life. To me, that makes you the real bully for insulting others because they play differently than you do.
---
They're amazing.
---
I just never trade.  I'll drop stuff for people to have, but from what I have seen the least trustworthy players are the ones that want to trade.
---
"I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll,¬†My body will blacken and turn into coal.¬†Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home,¬†and pity the miner diggin' my bones."

POWER ARMOUR POCKETS!
---
I wish lol
---
Everyone in my house sings along when it comes on, even though they've heard it 976 times because my Pip Radio is always on
---
Set up as a sweet location, with absolutely no reason to be there..... Just run through real quick and kill/be killed by some robots.
---
I want to know more about the community that existed there before and after the bombs, what happened, why it was so important for the Brotherhood.
---
Not honest? A coward?...haha that's a stretch.Ok kid.
---
It was a trailer, it exists purely to hype people up.  However what it hyped and what the community hyped are two totally different things.  It hyped up new underground locations, the community ran with that and hyped up instanced raids that would shower us in three star legendaries.
---
Theres nowhere to add it in, make charisma matter some? That's where I'd put a 1 cost +5% agro card.
---
I was expecting something a bit more then 10 ghouls and a normal assaultron. Fuck me right?
---
Also they didnt add this for free, unless you somehow paid 0$ for your game.
---
They stated all future dlc is included in the game price, its not free if you have to pay inorder to play it.
---
But we all know you are exaggareting because you want to defend our lovely small indie company bethesda so they can afford to buy food.
---
Could also logically fit under charisma since it is a party based perk.
---
That sucks. I guess at this point it would be better to just server hop and launch a nuke on each one
---
German is just as easy as Spanish. It is just the sounds that are different. A lot of "chha" and "chhhheey". It is English that is the hardest to learn. I'm a white guy from New Jersey Living in Nevada btw. I just learned Spanish when I was younger. I self taught russian too. That is just as easy as spanish, just a different alphabet you gotta remember. Anyways, back to Fallout. I only have 7 hours til I have to go to work/school. Happy Trails!!!
---
&gt;If feel like they spent ages making the area, with a cool story in the back of their mind but then gave up on that and just rushed it out.
---
Well put.
---
Also
---
&gt; If feel like they spent ages making the area, with a cool story in the back of their mind but then gave up on that and just rushed it out. 
---
That's pretty much how i see it as well if i'm honest with myself - A good idea starting out with good intentions perhaps that was just labeled as "that will do" and pushed out the door by management or something along those lines before anything magical could become of it.
---
I didn't comment on the area. Just stated that using TSE weapons as a measurement of how difficult the game/mobs are is absolutely stupid. That legendary combo is supposed to be an extremely rare roll but dupers fucked that up
---
I mean, [I'm like this](https://www.ebuyer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fallout-5.jpg).
---
no kidding WOW
---
Your r truly an ass kissing idiot. Does Bethseda pay you for these posts? üòÇüòÇ
---
Call me back when you've handled a rollout across a userbase of a half million users on three platforms. They're fixing it, just not at the speed you want.
---
Nicely worded - that actually put a smile on my face - no idea why - but that's it exactly isn't it - Sweet location with no reason to be there, or if there is one, i certainly missed it.
---
Damn Bethesda, making a game that engaged you for only 600ish hours.
---
Attach wire from the keypad (not the door) to trip plate. Then attach wire from trip plate to generator. Send me karma, please, if this helps :)
---
I was chatting to Todd Howard, and he said they have it all ready to go, but FritoZanzibar is really close to snapping, and they just want to wait until he rage quits before they release it. He didn‚Äôt say why but there was a picture of you on his desk with like, a beard and glasses drawn on it.
---
Played for 15minutes and got bored, its just whitesprings but not so good. No risk, no reward. Just the same shit all over again :/
---
Yea I can't use any mods either I was hoping this would of been fixed with the update but nope
---
People generally put their [Camps](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/568101697361018882/unknown.png) near the bridges so it'd be nice if they were avoided.
---
In that case, you could tuck them all under CHR, aggro gain and reduction and beef up a healing perk while you're at it.
---
I think it would be cool to have a Field Medic perk where your ran a "heal" bar outside of VATS that would fill up based on your damage and allow you to drop a group heal on your team to expend it.
---
If it went into any special points, the only one it can work with really is charisma. Since thats where party based cards are as is.
---
Hit the filter while in the floor decor section. it will pop up. or at least thats how I got it to work.
---
I appreciate the quick entry/exit while you're actually in combat, because I feel like it adds cool tension. But navigating a UI to get to it doesn't add the same feeling.
---
I died as soon as I got aids from the responder bot. Are you sure this is the right process?
---
But you get the tokens free in game.
---
I'll try. Not a fan of the plate though.
---
I wouldnt mind the heal range of that card to be increased too. It feels like they have to be directly beside you to work.
---
on of them brings you out in the bog.nicely closer to the mine entrance.and you can sneak the rest,right?.....WRONG.......THE WEE BUGGERS STILL KNOW YOUR IN THERE.
---
meet the welcome party!!!!!!!!!
---
I've had a thing where I can only respawn at vault 76 because I'm encumbered at death, that's super annoying. But I don't think I've ever had zero respawn points.
---
Speaking of the radio. Has anyone else noticed how songs are often cut short and skip to another song? Seems to happen pretty often for me since the last update.
---
Bethesda needs to get with the times though. "Dungeon" in any online game means a big, deep challenge with significant rewards. They only have more community outrage ahead of them if they keep mis-communicating to their fan base. And yes, that's what they did. Using the wrong words to describe upcoming content is mis-communication.
---
Oh man the Mirelurk Queen horde reminds me of the time I was walking around Toxic Valley on my level 150+ character and I spotted a Supermutant Behemoth. 
---
I was like, ‚ÄúAlright, a bit of a challenge.‚Äù
---
Three more including a Legendary appeared from between the ruins and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúFour?! That‚Äôs bananas, but hey a Legendary!‚Äù 
---
Then a fifth one showed up while I was looting the other four and I was like SPLORT!!! because my suspension of disbelief only went to four Behemoths in spawn. Oops.
---
wow, bravo, you just outed yourself as a cunt! i bet your parents are so proud of you! now please have the decency to die of cancer, slowly.
---
Are you so thin-skinned that someone correcting you causes you so much grief. Get over it, you were wrong, but it's gonna be ok.
---
Also, I didn't make any argument. I didn't write the comment you initially commented on, I only corrected your poor sense of time. Didn't mean to totally demolish everything you ever believed in if you are that fragile.
---
Now that you mention it. 
---
Maybe they only said there would be vaults, not that we could get in them anytime soon despite it being a fallout game.
---
They didn't state the game would be stable at launch either, just that we could obtain the game on release.
---
Or that base building wouldn't be broken and glitchy, just that we could access it. 
---
Or that the Canvas bag was actually cheap nylon, they didn't state that either. 
---
Or that they would lower the games price by 50% within 2 weeks due the absolute mess it was. 
---
I guess I just made assumptions towards a lot of these things from what was implied by their marketing and promotional material.
---
Now we are the ones at fault? Really? When did it become a bad thing to expect something that‚Äôs actually fun and enjoyable from a game developer? Bethesda overhyped the Burrows in their own marketing. They made it seem like it would be a type of horde mode that required you to team up in order to survive and beat it. This is supposed to be endgame content for the people who already finished the main campaign. Yet what we got was a 5 minute quest and a couple of ghouls. The Whitesprings Golf Club is more of a challenge than the Burrows.
---
They arent even ‚Äùbad‚Äù companies anymore because this sub proves that opinion is changing. 
---
Getting fucked in the ass by a company is completely normal and expected and if someone dares to be dissapointed they are getting ridiculed by the community for being stupid.
---
I grew up in North Central PA, but moved away to the city.
---
the western side of the map feels a lot like where i grew up. Whenever i hear that song, it would hit me right in the feels.
---
Lonely without NPC'S?  Lets talk about end game yeah? After completing FO3 &amp; 4, what NPCs are you talking to still? Preston? Are you having conversations with the NPCs? Ok the the followers, imo all i do is have sex with Kate and Curie (which is priceless) But beyond that what interactions are you having with NPCs after you beat the game. 76 doesn't have NPCs but it has players you can have real world conversions with, go exploring for however long, fight a scorchbeast together, trade, take pictures, fight each etc etc. NPCs won't give you anything like 76 does, 76 gives real human interaction, and your still lonely... I play 76 solo but im not alone when fighting the impostor sheepsqauch or the queen. Or when that guy found my camp gave me TSE handmade for free, can an npc do that? If you want an inanimate object to talk to(thats what NPCs are, a computer with a face) i think the insult boy has more unique dialogue than Preston when the game is complete.
---
I want to change mine too, but someone on here said they lost all their bought atom stuff so I'm not sure on progress
---
If this were just a PC game?  Absolutely.
---
But since they also have to patch for consoles, things get very shitty very fast.  Sony and Microsoft don't just let developers patch games whenever they want to, new patches have to be submitted to each company for review and they have to pay a fee for each submission.  For indie companies these fees are usually small or waived, but for a big developer like Bethesda even an emergency hotfix will run them at least $40,000.
---
They're all original, nothing new added.
---
Please explain?
---
Dude that's not really fair. I am a trader and I work with a lot of other traders and I have never or will never cheat anyone. 
---
I have even had people come back after like 10 minutes saying they have sellers remorse and want trade back and I have. 
---
There are a LOT Of honest traders out there. Don't let a few bad eggs spoil it for you
---
You are a mess dude. Holy shit. Youre fucking out there buddy.
---
&gt;marketing buzz words
---
Also known as lies. Lol.
---
Ok man thanks will wait to see if Tom Howard shoots his god rays and bless us with safe name changes
---
They might have actually implemented the ‚Äúdo not pick up duplicate keys‚Äù in the burrow and for the x01 nuka paint job. I tried to get the burrow key earlier before I realised I already had it and wasn‚Äôt allowing a duplicate pick up.
---
I'm sorry but that's just legit criticism. I've been playing games since i'm a kid and fallout 76 is by FAR the game that has the most bugs, more than i've ever seen. Maybe they shouldn't release a patch that makes things worse, i feel like that's not too much to ask for. I intentionally bought the game like 1 month ago because i like fallout but i knew it's gonna be filled with bugs at launch so i thought probably it's about playable by now but holy f*** it's not.
---
I can agree. I thought I was just crazy. I also replaced a few songs in my radio (they‚Äôre the proper length to not skip), and I wondered if that had something to do with it.
---
It was joke guy, Christ have you taken your meds?
---
Seriously...?
---
Plenty of people have hobbies. For many, their hobby is gaming. People after a work day can have 6-8 or so hours of free time before having to head to bed. 4 is pretty typical for 10's of millions of people, if not 100's in the US alone. I know people who make time for it even with kids. 4 hours of personal time for entertainment is nothing abnormal.
---
Keep dreaming, pal
---
I sing along to my radio with a hotmic.
---
Sometimes I'll literally sit by my cabin look out over the hills and just sing.
---
Haven't had anybody stumble on me while doing it yet so I've been spared that embarrassment.
---
Woahhhhh !!! Dude way to go the extra mile! I'm loving it so much as well. I started a project (kinda slow process bc it's a new type of hobby to me) to make a replica radio from fallout, that when you click on the knob it'll play applachia radio on shuffle. That's my goal, I don't have much done, bc having to make the radio from scratch to look like the fallout one is gonna be a pain, and ive never wired or soldered but hopefully I can figure out a plan. Thinking something with a jump drive with loaded songs plugged into a board of some sort. Or finding an old iPod shuffle. And if it's easy enough I'd love to turn the tuner and maybe get other stations too like diamond city. I'm not good at this stuff I just want a prop radio really bad.
---
Be ridiculed. Be strong. Who cares what others do or dont do.

Be your own person. Get the truth out there.

And they named it dude.  Ffs

I have same super sledge. It's so op I stopped using melee altogether. One shots anything below a mirelurk queen.
---
Yup you win, i have no intention of wasting my time on the internet arguing with rude people. 
---
Hope you enjoy fallout 76 new content.
---
Here's a long shot.  Any mods out there want to do their jobs and actually ban this guy already?  They've been following me around with this shit because I made them look stupid once and they're really running with this grudge thing.
---
Same here! Anthem was not very good.. maxed out gear to find out there is less endgame than 76!
---
Sure found the dead party guy :P
---
I was in there when a couple of SB came along, they certainly knew I was in there.
---
You had my interest till I saw the 7500caps. 
---
IIRC someone on PSN is doing something similar for 1500.
---
Sure in PvE, but you will get wrecked in PvP.
---
So then no game is allow to call anything a Dungeon unless it conforms to your version of what it means? That's fucking bullshit. Grow up. Video games don't all do the same fucking things.

You can also wire a normal switch to the inside of the door, in circuit with the keypad, that will let you close it manually. You have to make sure to close it everytime it's opened, or it will remain open.

A legit criticism, but not a legitimate expectation. No software company is going to risk rushing out a patch for a minor issue when it already has a release scheduled in a week.
---
Yeah Nuke it and do it again, freaking amazing sooooo many legendary Ghouls makes it totally worth it standard is a little underwhelming but this place was MEANT to be nuked and you get a buttload of XP.
---
The Burrows is just a named location akin to Wendigo Cave.
---
I will say tho, the legendary farming/fight at Harper's Ferry just got expanded so there's that fun.
---
This is a dungeon in an ongoing online game. Maybe crowded now. But it's supposed to be repeatable. In a month you can go alone many times I'm sure
---
I changed mine and have had no problems, still have all my atoms, atom purchases, level, progress etc :)

I think he has done random npcs in the past

Awesome thanks friend!

Oh please. Typical reddit coward hiding behind a keyboard, always using, the same excuses, they have seen others use. You aren't even originally stupid and cowardly. The reddit is filled more with your kind.
---
The 76 BoS are under-armed and stretched thin on top of the threat from the Sierra Bravos.
---
Best response. I've been playing since November and the lack of NPCs has never once negatively impacted my experience
---
Idk it's just because i craft stuff a lot and repair things and i'm faster without PA so i'm constantly getting inside, outside, it's annoying. Maybe just make us able to mod stuff while inside armor?
---
This can apply to so many aspects of the game.  Good attitude!
---
Okay well the first one I walked up to killed me. I‚Äôm a stealth character so walking up to deathclaws goes against my build. Lol
---
Also... my parents literally died of cancer, so thanks for that
---
This is the exact problem here.  
---
No one EVER said this was going to be a horde mode.  No one EVER said this was going to be THE end game content.  They over sold a dungeon of some difficulty you could run with your friends.  That's it.  Everything from there you let your imagination run away with.
---
Its funny you mention the squirt gun- there‚Äôs a thing in the update that mentions Sheepsquatch having extremely acidic and corrosive urine. Can‚Äôt wait to have the squirt gun loaded with sheepsquatch piss
---
I think you make yourself stupid all on your own.
---
And unless u forgot there is a thing called hotfixes. Pretty sure if it wasnt the challenges it could be the broken armor benches or the fact we can add mods.
---
There are things Bethseda can do. And your white knight ass kissing tactics arent good for the community. And piss me the freck off.

In case you didn't already know, you can place a doorway, run a wire through the opening, and then use the "replace" option in the build menu to change it to a solid wall/window. You can also do the same thing with the mesh flooring for verticle wires.
---
No they shouldn't call it what the entire gaming community and every develooer on the planet calls it. I didnt make up the name dude. Gamers and gaming companies did. They shouldnt embellish wih the "hard group content" talk either. Once again this makes everyone but you assume, its a hard group content dungeon. When its just a quest. How you blamed this on the players is insane dude. 
---
Not sure why you cant understand a simple point and move on. But im here for ya buddy. We will get through this. One day at a time.

What I use for my prop radio is an old Zenith radio I picked up off craigslist a few months ago. Combine it with a cheap FM transmitter and I‚Äôve got Appalachia radio playing on the radio that the in game one was based on!

I'd just move my Camp if I were you. It's just like camping at WS you're gonna get nuked.

Can confirm all good - changed mine last night with the same sort of worries - played away last night and today - no issues.
---
It brings me so much joy
---
well sorry I dont look at every post jeez I was just looking for some help
---
This got broken with the last patch.
---
That would be a Mirelurk queen killing ghouls in the lab that's underground Arktos Pharma
---
Yeah but then I gotta WALK to Harper's Ferry!
---
Try reading the description of the goal of the quest... ***spoilers ahead***
---
Find the mysterious signal... Done, robots. Stop and ask yourself, why robots? Read terminals. Employees mysteriously replaced by military-grade robots? Why? Read more terminals... Building a tunnel to White Springs as recently as the opening of Vault 76? What??? Does that mean the BoS was tracking an Enclave signal? Hmmmm...
---
Next question - where did the BoS TEAM go? The only sign of BoS presence is a couple of bodies literally at the entrances. They have orders for a mission they clearly didn't complete by climbing down the entrance ladder. Were those bodies arriving or attempting to escape?
---
Next clue - there is a constant power armor mod loot item. Where's the BoS power armor from the BoS team? The only power armor in the Borrows is a Raider suit. Seems like we're missing some BoS remains. Where did they go?
---
Final clues - there was a power struggle. Half the population left the Burrows, or tried to. There's also a key to the old tunnels that constantly went missing, but ultimately can be found by players. Where is it used? Was it used by the escaping faction when the King tried to trap them in?
---
Last clue - Bethesda asks us to find out 1) signal source and 2) what happened to the population of the Burrows. Several Burrows bodies and ghouls exist from the group that stayed. The group that tried to LEAVE, however... We know where they were heading. Did we explore their destination?
---
You can swap out the HDD in a PS4 for an SSD drive.  I don't know how much of an improvement that would make with 76 (4, on PC at least, had load times that were notoriously capped by framerate).
---
I would hope some QoL features are not being charged to us?
---
Wow. How many Bethesda employees had to signup Reddit accounts to upvote this shit?
---
I didn't have any of those expectations (loot, instanced raids, etc). What I really wasn't expecting was the new content to be finished in 5 minutes. I really don't understand how it's the community's fault that Bethesda underdelivered.
---
Genocide is a particular group of people. They're pretty indiscriminate albeit I don't recall anyone in the Institute killing anyone else aside from Kellogg who was a rogue mercenary.
---
Just wonder how tall are the bunnies? Are they knee high or waist high?
---
i feel a bit stupid, between my different characters i probably have close to 400 levels and still don't know where this tunnels are, lol
---
could somone be so kind a mark the entrances and exits on map an post it ? :) would be fun to check them out...
---
OKAY EVERYONE SERGEANT MQZ HAS ENDED THE DISCUSSION thanks bro
---
And now there are people downvoting you. God forbid we try and be matter of fact about this. The dungeon isn't a challenge. Pure and simple. Certainly doesn't take multiple people to complete it, and doesn't require any kind of build at all. You need armor. You need gun. Go shoot thing. You win. That's it. It has the same challenge as a random cabin somewhere else in the map. If anyone says it challenging, I dare them to post their gameplay of it on youtube. Makes me wonder if they're gaming journalists.
---
I'll get downvotes but they need to balance builds better and that involves nerfing things like bloodied builds and some others. You should not be able to one shot all enemies but the queen. You supposed low health is not a good enough trade of for that damage output.
---
Guildwars 2 has similar one. You first have to do an event in area and if successful one participant will be targeted by really nasty boss.
---
Really, really fun. Unless you happen to be the targeted one :D
---
Nice idea and hope BSG hears and picks up on this.
---
They really should work on instancing throughout the whole game. Especially the open world. World of Warcraft does this well. Should eliminate the need to server hop so much. Server hoping is such a shitty design flaw but a necessary one.
---
Shhhhh...now I'm going to get wasted for sure.
---
I can see where you're coming from, and yeah, the BoS is up to interpretation. It's a faction where context REALLY matters, as in different games you get to see different sides of them. 
---
I was introduced to them via Fallout 3, where they're there- mostly- to help. In New Vegas, though, they are far more isolationist, willing to fight and kill for their own territory, and mostly exist just to get blown up in order to finish the game- if you're not careful. 
---
Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 provide the largest look at the dichotomy between the Brotherhood "Now", and the Brotherhood of yesteryear. In 76 they have a clear mission statement of preservation and prevention. While they aren't good at working with other factions, they are far less interested in wiping them out entirely or dominating them, as we see more in Fallout 4. 
---
The BoS of 4 don't hide the fact that they want to completely wipe out the institute- which seems extreme, but I can understand it. However, they're also interested in murdering every synth, even those who are against the Institute. The only faction they can aren't opposed to are the Minutemen, and that's because the Minutemen are bland as _hell_. The Brotherhood of 4 take what they want, when they want, with little regard for life beyond that of their own members, seeing almost all Wastelanders as uneducated, unclean savages- as opposed to 76's view of them as Civilians.
---
&gt; I have about 200hrs into the game (not much but it‚Äôs something )
---
Literally spent over a week over your life playing his game, I know others have played more but... it‚Äôs still *a lot*.
---
You have to get close and use the interact button
---
John Denver is a national treasure.  I wish they could have gotten the rights to [the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vrEljMfXYo).  The cover is good, but the original........wow.
---
I kinda am tbh. Maxson grew up with Lyons. You'd think it would have rubbed off on him. Unless something made him hardened while growing up after Lyons.
---
I've been running it and so far it's been spawning Legendaries for me in it's regular form - average is 2 - 3* Ghouls and 3 - 2* ghoulies but many Diseased ones dropped Legendary armor so this last trip I walked out with 7 Legendary weapons and 3 Armor, 2 of which was Bolstering. The Best Weapon was a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher with +50 limb dmg.
---
There‚Äôs a reason the Appalachia faction isn‚Äôt around anymore
---
Bethesda has replied that they are aware hopefully it will be fixed next update.
---
I have a level 35 AAE Dragon with 15% faster reload if you're still interested.
---
In the mean time before they implement this you can use the "show on map" button from the quest entry in your PipBoy. I only ever remember this after I feel like i circled the map 10 times looking for my marker
---
I'm astounded that the guy playing was even aware of the fact that he had to interact with buttons. Dude clearly never touched a game in his life...
---
Never said I had no use for it
---
Every time I hear Country Roads I remember how hyped out of my mind I was, and how let down I felt after. I still play almost daily, but it's not living up to my hype, at all.
---
Weapons
---
Shut up I care, its you nobody cares about
---
Changed mine a few days ago and so far so good
---
Did you even read or see any of the marketing? Bethesda literally advertised the Burrows as a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù. Stop drinking the kool aid. I love the game too, but I can still see the flaws in what they delivered versus what they advertised.
---
I love that song! The Fo 76 version by Spank is specially awesome! I'm writing a theme and variations with it!
---
Whether you mean it or not. You are still putting it out there. üôà
---
Operation Scapegoat anyone?
---
I got my fill of disappointment from destiny
---
Depends on how they code it. A relatively simple defense for it would be 100% damage reduction for the first few/several minutes or until other players arrive, when its damage reduction drops to 75% plus an equivalent amount of explosive reduction. 
---
Perhaps if its prey is in a team it instead gains 75% damage/explosion reduction with health buffing per each player within its loading distance....
---
Np. It happens. What I was getting at was people that always think new content has to be the hardest and toughest thing to come.  Sure getting stronger is part of the game but at what point is too much? Once you start one hitting stuff the enjoyment of the game loses its appeal and changes your view of the game. And by that people suddenly thing their entitled to every thing that comes out to be like I said the next greatest and toughest thing yet. 
---
No one told you to run a build that does more damage than most things in game have hp. Players included. 
---
Sure play your way. But when playing your way dictates what you demand to be easy or hard for everyone. There‚Äôs a problem.
---
Still can't seem to inspect during a player trade though.
---
I agree üíØ ,but these things will take alot of effort.I sincerely hope they plan on putting this level or work/money into making coming content great.My hope is sadly beginning to wane though,as of yet they haven't proven capable or willing to put in this level of commitment to the game.
---
One thing is for sure though,unless we collectively put our foot down and stop making excuses for them,they won't ever step it up.Now is not the time for blind fanboyism.Now is the time to take them to task and tell them what it is we expect out of an online multiplayer experience in 2019.Good post.
---
Doesn't happen at my shop anyway. I have guards to prevent people being dicks ha
---
Do you actually believe that anonymous people on the internet are who they really are. I don't actually think you are moron who is unable separate reality from hype, Btu I think you are disappointed in something and are lashing out with a ridiculous argument, in my opinion. In real life, we could probably easily co-exist. In real life, we could have this same argument and both of us would just end up saying "I understand, but I just feel this way about it".
---
This isn't real life. This the internet. I can call you an idiot and you can call me a crazy person, but at the end of the day none of it fucking matters. We're all going to exaggerate, use hyperbole and make self-aggrandizing statements and then we'll move on. I'm just killing time waiting for my work to render and you're doing whatever you do.
---
&gt; If you keep making excuses for them and defend the crap they are shoving on us,
---
I am neither making excuses or defending. I am practicing reading comprehension.
---
&gt; "unforced error" what a stupid term
---
I take it you've haven't played a lot of sports. An unforced error is an error that you make where the opposition didn't force you into the mistake that made an error.
---
A quarterback under/overthrowing a wide open receiver for an interception is one such type of error.
---
&gt; Until we put our foot down and tell them we aren't happy with this level of effort.THIS IS ALL WE ARE GONNA EVER GET,a lazy uninspired piece of crap DUNGEON.
---
You can put your foot down as much as you want. You can jump up and down as much as you want or even hold your breath. Instancing won't show up faster if you do, and won't show up slower if you don't.
---
The devs said on stage that they were working on instancing tech for Arktos. That it will be awhile. 
---
Inside The Vault put out it would be a dungeon. That should have made people go hmmmm.... either the instancing tech is done early or Inside the Vault is speaking out its ass. This was the error. Someone should have verified what Inside the Vault was saying.
---
He doesn't want to show up the players. Infinite self-repair and indestructibility are pretty potent. 
---
Maybe he just needs a stack of Handy models to power up ...
---
Sorry it was just a joke. I didn't realize you could even get to 220! I'm lvl 35 right now. I didn't mean to cause so much trouble.
---
&gt;And I never had a dozen anything swarm me down there, at most I had 4 ghouls
---
It isn't instanced, so if someone just cleared it out, you might not have many things to kill.
---
IMO, this is leading to wild differences in what people experience.  It might be worth doing again after "ooh shiny" wears off and leas people run it.....or not.
---
Do you realize at my level there is nothing else to do except rush around the map killing everything?
---
That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs just another golf club with a scenery change.
---
Let's just say there's a reason that somebody made a Nazi re-skin mod for them xD
---
That's not true

Well yes because other companies wouldn't release an unfinished game. Ok maybe Activision would.

Then need to protect player's camps from grievers UNLESS they are behind the golf club with turrets.  Then they should be open game and you should not become wanted for destroying them.
---
Fast Travel = Time to go the bathroom, pour myself a drink, make a sandwich, pay some bills, check my email, browse reddit...
---
No content that alters the gamestate on the atomic shop. Cosmetic only. Skins for planters sure but no the base item itself.
---
What really makes this post hit me hard is the fact that custody battles always favor women over men for who gets the most time with the child. I earnestly hope the courts don't screw you over like that.
---
Yea, I'm around that too. Probably 580 or something. I even took a month long sudo break (logged for daily and weekly challenges for most days). For 2-4 hours a day over 6-7 months, it's definitely not a difficult time to achieve, but apparently SOME people find even a single hour every day to be absolutely absurd.
---
You had to craft and hide the first one.
---
Beats me.  The existing Photomode works pretty well.  I can't imagine why I'd have a camera sitting around, taking up space in my inventory.  Seems about as pointless as binoculars.
---
Personally, I'd swap the Legendary vendor and the camera, or ditch the camera entirely.
---
This drives me crazy. Especially in buildings like the asylum or the Charleston capitol where they could be in any floor and they sound like they‚Äôre right behind you.
---
Everyone who expected a real challenge is bound to be disappointed... yet I have this strange feeling that we are all missing something.  I fully expected sewers to be just a first level of this "dungeon".  The preview of Wild Appalachia DLC showed multiple subterranean levels what looked like Vaults, but those aren't supposed come out until later... so, are there any hidden areas underneath the Burrows?
---
Ok thanks
---
Ok kid,like I said my post is still there.It was mainly for the 100 IQ and over crowd anyways,so I really didn't expect a Forrest Gump like you to get it anyways.lol.
---
The clicking is Lurkese for "Om Nom Nom Nom", perhaps? Or "food for my babies" ...
---
He is just covering it up. False apology due to backlash.
---
It's high. But they are paying for my quality, time, and supplies. Because I also have a group of people behind me that I pay as well.
---
For the purposes of that game I'm willing to say "Surfacers" is a particular group of people. Additionally the institute regularly sends Synths to the surface to kill and replace others for infiltration purposes.
---
I think this is exactly the issue. People saw that video where they're all taking very coyly about the Arktos Lab dungeon and thought it was referring to the Burrows. Or they thought the Burrows was the Arktos Lab.
---
Bethesda deserves a level of criticism for how they described the difficulty for sure. But the main problem is that people are fucking idiots and decide their own misunderstanding means Bethesda lied to them.
---
This \^ I'm pretty sure everyone expected it to be instanced, if it were that would have made it 100x better aside from the fact how short it is. Being able to have many enemies to yourself would be great. Hopefully they either fix it and make it instanced or they learn from this for future content, which they sadly never do..
---
I‚Äôm not trying to start an argument or attack you but you‚Äôre acting very entitled towards free atoms. Most games of this nature don‚Äôt offer the exclusive currency for free, and almost none offer it so abundantly.
---
You can pacify a Deathclaw if you have Wasteland Whisperer and you're twice its level. 
---
I remember someone saying that Rose actually has unique dialogue if you successfully pacify the Deathclaw and then "Make friends" with it. Don't know if it's true though.
---
I've never had a complaint in 63 builds.
---
Holy guacamole, I didn‚Äôt even realize it. Thanks pal!
---
If you aren't belting out, "COUNTRY ROOOOOOAAADS, TAKE MEEEE HOOOOOOME!" every time it comes on are you even playing the game?
---
I would if I wasnt too busy doing 1.5k damage with a low health super sledge
---
But what did you mean with hide?
---
Are you on pc?
---
Was in non nuked Burrows last night. Found a legendary glowing one  carrying a minigun... I killed it quick because I didn't want to see what the fuck the game would do if it actually tried to use it. Looted a Vampires minigun off of it.
---
I did that... now what
---
I find more 3 stars legendaries this way than killing them with one or two hits
---
Well clearly you don't understand the astronomical difference in engineering between a right ear and a left ear. 
---
Or it's an easter bunny that's been scarred and out for vengeance.
---
I class this a beta/trial dungeon. To see what and how they can improve. People forget this NOT the team that made ESO or oblivion or any of the other titles. If they well shame on them. 
---
Making it instanced is a really good feature to push down the line.
---
I understand your point, it's just not a good point. Dungeons have existed outside of gaming, they have a definition. Just because some games took dungeons and made them one thing doesn't mean they are always going to be that one thing. People can anything whatever they want. Would it have been better to call it something else, sure. I don't know what they would have called it, because it functions exactly like all their other dungeons from all their other games apart from ESO(which they do not develop). I don't know why you can't understand that. There are no rules in video games nomenclature. they don't have to call it anything other than what they call it.
---
Did you not actually comprehend what you read?
---
I. Bought. The .locker. Plans. Twice.
---
Read them, twice.
---
First, from watergate, second from graham, right before this post.
---
Still can‚Äôt build the locker because the plans are bugged.
---
If Bethesda is wasting time scheming up ways to get us to make purchases INSTEAD of fixing the aforementioned bugs, more players will quit, leading to less sales.
---
Idgaf if eggs are free, it‚Äôs the wear and tear on the chickens ass that matters.
---
Yeah and that's pretty much the only end game content right now haha. I haven't been on in a while, but I might hop on just to fill up my stash with crap legendaries in anticipation for the legendary trade-in vendor and then hop off till it comes. I stopped at level 105 a month or two ago
---
Lol I always wonder about the hours played when I spot a level 331!
---
Why can't they quickly hack the servers and patch things? The folks over at Blizzard managed to figure out a way to do it with Diablo 3 and WoW.
---
you're the exact kind of person I don't want any help. get out
---
In the new sheepsquatch-related quest that came with the burrows, a note said that the sheepsquatch might have needle-like fur. Coincidence? I think not
---
Even then sneak crit spam. Take the imposter one full bar of crit spamming and I nearly kill it. Tho if they do something with the radio like what they have now. 4 people tune in and then they have to track down a lvl 80+ mob that would be interesting and would add more pve events on demand
---
Google xD
---
&gt; one of
---
The music is definitely not my complaint with the game
---
And how does "challenge" automatically imply an instanced raid tier guaranteed legendary dropping activity?
---
If they buffed all of the ghouls inside and quintupled their spawns then that could be a challenge... but it still wouldn't be instanced so people would complain that they entered after someone else and there was nothing to fight... and people would get pissed off if they didn't happen to run into any legendaries on the way... or even if they did that all they got were one star drops...
---
People aren't just pissed off that they didn't get a "challenging" dungeon, they're more pissed off that they also lost out on the kinds of rewards they'd expect from a challenging dungeon.
---
Do it like Rings style. If the Sheepsquatch chooses you, you cannot fast travel and the Squatch‚Äôs location is marked for just you. You can either confront it or somehow pass your ‚Äúscent‚Äù off onto another player. Probably some type of syringer or grenade.
---
How?
---
I'm level 74 and have HALF of this and my camp is maxed out.
---
How do you get so much stuff and have a huge base?
---
Just now gave it a try, you will get overrun by bloated glowing ones on your own, lots of Violet Flux en route from the Red Rocket to the South entry
---
This too. There's one pretty vicious holotape, and two vague notes, one pointing to a collapsed tunnel. I was more dissapointed in the "Burrow Boys" and survivors just being dropped, than I was with the "content". I was really hopong for evidence of an extremely deadly civil war in the burrows, and the conflict between the teo factions.
---
Instead, we got nothing.
---
I love it. I'm pretty happy they reduced the caps lost on death too. I used to make a ton of caps on there before they reduced it, but now I have less incentive to shoot everything that moves which is nice.
---
I usually go around with my weapon holstered and do the thumbs down emote when someone shoots at me or runs at me with melee. If they dont stop then I happily gun them down and farm them as they respawn
---
wait no my house is in harpers
---
merci
---
Oh holy shit then
---
Med-X, psychobuff, and just start shooting! Just go with whatever your best perks are... I'm maxed out on rifleman and carry a gauss rifle. I was afraid of them until about a week ago until i just said 'screw it' now I actively hunt them down because they aren't as hard as I expected.
---
Another player has to find it.
---
They should make a sanded polished stained pipe gun. Make it look like what a professional wood worker could do.
---
It's not the same thing since there's no value in nuking that far east. People will just lose access to camps they can drop by at after looting the area.
---
Place it somewhere in your camp.
---
They're still out there. Got one last night from a 3 star we killed.
---
I agree, the ugly generic planter could be a rare plan in the game, maybe even quest related. Have skins that fit the individual camp themes.
---
I like this idea, while they're at it, How about letting us craft/repair in power armor and just not having the animation?
---
Almost like how if someone is already at a terminal but if you click on the terminal it comes up on your pipboy.
---
Just have the crafting UI without all the extra crap.  
---
Also, come to think of it, for terminals you must sit at, that says you can't while in power armor (sugar grove comes to mind) why doesn't the terminal just come up on your HUD anyway?
---
Nah man they screwed the pooch on this one, they purposely overhyped, when I hear a dungeon I don't think of a sewer with like 20 ghouls I think of a sprawling underground area intended for multiple people and is instanced much more like what they have in ESO
---
I miss the mini map in the pup boy from fo4.
---
Also, just cross the waterfall and stay to the left. You'll come out over the soldier's skeleton right in front of the entrance.
---
I BELOOOOOONG
---
One of the vault-like areas is expected to be some sort of basement level for Arktos Pharma, which is backed up by its exterior being in one of the slides when you start the game and an Arktos lab coat you can see in some of the promo images.  It's just going to end up being one of these sudden releases like how they just recently announced the Burrows.
---
Same with Vault Tec university and charleston capital building.
---
Also, why don't allow us drop most of the not essential keys? They are respawning anyway.
---
If I can skip quest stage without taking the key - i don't take key. And my misc inventory section is bloated, so it's taking ages to find and read some notes, for example. But keychain must be implemented for inventory management OCD alone.
---
Country Roads specifically always just kind of stops me where I am and reminds me to just take in the scenery for a bit, I love it
---
Isn't Bethesda taking care of that with no-build zones?
---
I had a camp way down on the south end of white springs, technically next to the golf course, but on the other side of a wall. 
---
I had turrets up because occasionally ghouls from a monument would come up and ruin my crops. 
---
I had work benches and crops available for everyone, and nobody seemed to take issue with it being there. I placed it there to scrap from a junk pile, and I also kept that unlocked. 
---
I get why people hate the camps on the golf course. I think the simpler solution is just restricting where they can be built.
---
Well you can‚Äôt read plans twice (it will say known if you‚Äôre already read it once) Sounds like you just wanted to bitch and that was a jumping off point
---
Great freaking idea my man, thanks for letting us know!
---
It's not like I'm standing next to him trying to vulture a brown bag, or telling him he needs to do anything crazy like sell and rebuy from vendor. 
---
It's a quick test that resets an item and a possible work around that he can do from the comfort of his base.
---
Would be the lamest troll attempt
---
They added them back to the loot tables? I don't remember seeing them say they had, after they removed them post nerf.
---
From what I understand, neither has she, IIRC someone has gone back to her after moving their CAMP. 
---
I‚Äôll be honest, when I saw the 1500 price tag I did think ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs a bargain‚Äù but 7500 is too steep.
---
I mean...you could be right.  But the accusations that I was seeing were that his religious beliefs dictated that he hates homosexuals.  If that were the case, don't you think he wouldn't publicly disavow his own religious beliefs?  Wouldn't someone like that value eternal life more than they value a career as a YouTuber?
---
Maybe he wouldn't, I don't know.  I don't know the guy.  I do enjoy watching his channel sometimes, but I'm not emotionally invested in his life.
---
Also, i do have 2 fusion generators so there's plenty of power
---
All the ones available r from the taxidermy quests. There are 4 in the taxidermy office and two random notes released yesterday.
---
If mistresses of mystery is a faction then so is Eta Psi. Not only is Biv a sole survivor, he helps us get drunk while winning.
---
What is the ideal target spot?  Dead on the harpers ferry icon?  I‚Äôve got a few to launch
---
SBQ - easy??? Haven't defeted her even once, either because of bugs or no OP guys in team. I'm lvl 103 and quited on her until she is fixed.
---
DOZENS of seconds?  Oh my god.  How do you even survive that?  God forbid you have to wait for something to load.  That is the worst thing I have ever heard.  You better have food and water in front of you so you don't die while you are waiting for the game to load.
---
I stopped a month ago also, came back for the new stuff but lost interest after that. I have good gear and good weapons so i really dont need to farm and there just isnt anything to do besides farming.
---
It'd be nice if the game had a truce system. You both accept a truce and neither of you(or your teams) can enter into PVP for X amount of time. 5 minutes is probably enough, but maybe 30 minutes to be safe.
---
I think at some point that'll change.
---
Me neither until yesterday and today. The first time it was the same for me, I could go to vault 76. That sucked honestly, but having to leave the game completely is nuts. I messaged the other guy down there to go ahead and take my junk. I actually had power armor on tho so I know I wasn‚Äôt encumbered which is what‚Äôs weird.
---
Well just go to the glassed caverns and look how many fuckersthey killed in there
---
Side not question is cryo damage a thing for legendary weapons?
---
100 % of the new "QUEST" content has been like a 1 day or few hour adventure. How long of lunch breaks is the development team fucking taking FFS. Why should anyone get excited for ANY of the new content anymore is beyond me.
---
You on xbox?  I can give you some hardened masses.  Always seem to get more of those then the glowing mass.
---
Goddamn are you whiny assholes back it was so nice while you guys  were gone
---
Realized this today, my new log in habit has been to alternate those.
---
If you need another game to soak up some hours try warframe and gta 5
---
Because of consoles and money.  
---
WoW is in it's own category because it's a PC only game, they can update it whenever they feel like it at no cost.  But any game that's on consoles needs all of it's patches to go through certification with Sony and Microsoft along with several tens of thousands of dollars in processing fees.  For a game like Diablo 3 Activision/Blizzard has a lot more money that Bethesda to throw around if they want to quickly get a patch pushed through cert.
---
They never removed anything in the nerf
---
Someone should have verified what inside the vault was saying.
---
That's the dumbest thing ever,inside the vault is Bethesda themselves,how blind are you?they hyped it as a dungeon for 2 50+ characters.Period.It wasn't an "unforced error".This isn't football or tennis.
---
ou can put your foot down as much as you want. You can jump up and down as much as you want or even hold your breath. Instancing won't show up faster if you do, and won't show up slower if you don't.
---
It won't show up at all if you don't.That common to all business,They will only put as much effort as they need to to make the customer content.Wake up.Learn to speak with your wallet.Thats how you get things done.
---
This is my kind of build :D Love it, plus I have 2H Hammer for close call situations
---
When you place them in build mode, you'll note the per hour rate.  Not 100% certain what it is for the industrial purifier.  That value that is shown is the max that you can produce at your camp per hour, not a multiplier per purifier you have.
---
NOTE: I am going off what i've read and the experience I've personally had.  I could be way off base.
---
To each their own. And I have repeats that vone through as well. You think 7500 is scary, most builds top out at 10-12. 7500 is if the person is part of a group of vendors, clans, or guilds and just want something simple like a church or a base.
---
For a legendary effects? No i dont think so.
---
To have someone achieve low earth orbit
---
I was on the top of the Whitesprings observation tower this morning, sunny morning in the game too,  listening to the pipboy radio and admiring the fact you can see 90% of the important locations from there, and every single spot I've built a CAMP, and it was one of those "everything clicks" moments.
---
&gt; The recipes were in the Misc section so I couldn't read them 
---
This recipes was there since beta actually.
---
I managed to kill the ghouls just fine on my level 35 riflemen, then went to do it on my level 160. It was easy on both
---
im level 145.  also how many turrets?  i only use 3.
---
Thay had people killed and replaced with synths. Travelers, mayor's, detectives, maybe even the sole survivor. Killed in the name of progress
---
Can't argue with that
---
Fort Defiance is more dungeon than The Burrows is...
---
Mmh, and camera dailies continue today. I wonder if they're even going to make it up to us.
---
Someone named Supermoo9 seemed to have replied to my post, but apparently also blocked me because I can't see the post, or the person's profile. 
---
Can anyone tell me what it says?
---
2 turrets.
---
Does camp budget increase past lvl 50?
---
Thought it stopped at 50?
---
181995 subscribers. Yet only 2850 active users right now. Being generous, let's say the peak is 5-10k. Then generously stretching that over different time zones, with overlap for the more active users, and including people who come on once every few days, we have maybe 40-60k people who still use this sub. This estimate could be way off, but it makes sense to me given how quickly the game's popularity fell off. 
---
Then we have to assume that a good portion of them are lurkers only, as opposed to actively posting. You can't deny that this sub is heavily skewed to a minority of players who are among the most dedicated to the game. Your casual player who plays an hour or two over the weekend isn't going to go out of their way to find a subreddit to talk about the game. 
---
It's the same issue as I see on /r/codzombies , people severely overestimate just how significant they are to the playerbase as a whole
---
you can save some scroll time by renaming your poer armor....
---
prefix the name with a "." ala      " . T60-L45 PA "
---
the leading "." will sort first, so that item will be at the top of the list (instead of donw in the "P"s
---
Yea, it's always reset at 8pm EST/EDT for me. Biv's quest also resets at that time.
---
It would be sick if they would just let you use the faction headquarters as a CAMP so you can roleplay as the last surviving member
---
So now you have a problem with me realizing they are going to underdeliver?
---
What do you want? For me to praise the new content and how magnificent it was?
---
Because it wasn't.
---
The production rate is 60 per an hour, so how many will produce 60 an hour?  So I dont have to have 13 anymore...
---
Ok so before long that thread would be fifty pages long with no clear indication of where in the thread a given topic is, among other problems.
---
This is pretty simple stuff dude. If you've already read a topic and don't want to read a new thread about it, don't click it. This is the same principle as not clicking threads you're just not interested in. You have the power. I have faith in you to practice basic decision making in a discussion-based forum. xD
---
Its a mutation. Game is working as intended.
---
Wouldn't that require instances though.
---
perhaps because destruction does not take finesse (thus you can scrap), but construction takes dexterity the PA hands lack? (thus you cannot craft)
---
You said a dungeon was a cave. A cave is a cave. A dungeon is a dungeon. This is why we have words for things.
---
Shut up
---
hope i remember this next time
---
The only mod i use is the Perk Loadout Manager. Cant live w/o it anymore :)
---
I think its coming in wastelanders. They said it would fundamentally change the game and bring back player choice...
---
You're a disgusting human being
---
My dad's family (his brother, cousin, and parents) are in a bluegrass band together, and I had a similar experience but backwards. One of the songs they played for a show I went to was "Pistol Packin' Mama," and I immediately was like "Why is that familiar...?" They do "Ghost Riders" and Cross the Wide Missouri now too. I even recently suggested they pick up "Bubbles in My Beer"!
---
So learn to not click them. It isn't hard. New players come and have insights into old matters, and sometimes those old matters will have changed over time. This has been a thing for many years now...
---
I believe the number you're looking for is 12 purifiers. That extra one you have is overkill. 
---
Each industrial holds max 5 waters
---
And you do realise he edited the original post
---
Wow guys... This is getting ridiculous.
---
And a company that ignores the dedicated players and makes new content for the ones who actually don't care about the game that much and don't really have interest in learning to play is the best way to go.
---
I'm sure those people will be here next year, right?
---
Right?
---
  They do! Omg they do! I defended this game for so long, then I started looking around and these shills were coming unglued, slamming on their keyboards until their words were unintelligible.
---
  But I began to notice that the game had so many issues, too many for 2019, too many for 60$, and wayyy to many for even Bethesda.  The game is an undeniable mess.  It's boring af,  it has a ridiculous amounts of issues and Bethesda CONTINUES to import technical issues, the updates are drip fed and are okay at best, or total crap as shown with the Borrows...
---
  Why do they keep defending something Bethesda obviously doesn't give half a crap about?
---
There's a final boss? I went through and on encountered a hand full of ghouls.... quest completed with just going through a computer.. did I miss something?
---
Those songs are from the same guy? 
---
Haha i love them both but Jingle-Jangle is my all time favorite, maybe along with Big-Iron.
---
I just want my coronal explosion crit perk back from previous games.
---
Nobody said anything about newbies, level 50+ isn't generally what you would consider a newbie. They are making it accessible to the solo and casual players. The ones who don't go out of their way to find a subreddit to talk about the game and trade for the best legendaries and learn to optimize their builds. A level 50 with only basic legendaries would still find this dungeon moderately difficult to solo. I didn't find a TSE until I was level 152, until then my best weapons were things like a furious 10mm smg or a two shot lmg (back when it was still shit)
---
It's kind of weird how they work, but if you open one of them up, you'll see on each one's maximum weight capacity.  It can produce 60 bottles an hour but only hold 10 or so pounds.  End result is they *can* produce that much water in an hour, but only if you stay on top of them clearing them out every few minutes.
---
that would be nice.
---
Are we going to have atoms added to our accounts as we can not complete challenges then? Or would that be too positive a PR move?
---
Minor quibble: it's not the first dungeon. Glassed Cavern and Kerwood Mine both qualify in my mind; Glassed Cavern even has a boss of sorts.
---
That said, I had fun with it but wish Bethesda hadn't hyped it. I'm still new enough that I will occasionally come across "how did I miss this before?" moments. I think if I'd come across it accidentally while venturing near Harper's Ferry I would have been much more impressed. As it was, it felt like a whole lot of buildup to get Sugar Creek without as many desk fans.
---
Oversight 76
---
I thought he did the courier in Skyrim for the longest time
---
Judging by the few people on my friends list who swapped, it seems to be fine
---
no you don't get 730 water per hour, you get 60 per hour. If you have 12 purifiers the twelve of them will take turns filling up until after an hour you have 60. All the extra purifiers do is you don't have to keep emptying them out.
---
I know it's stupid, don't yell at me.
---
Haha good ol t60
---
when I did it, it was "shy" at first, but aggro'ed when I got close.  
---
Even then, it tended to retreat rather than attack. 
---
When I klled it, the body flew and disappeared.  
---
  Spend IDK how much time searching, no body, no meatpile, nothing.
---
Cursed the bug and began making my way back out.  
---
Body was at the exit door.
---
The Overseer questline isnt finished. My theory is that she is communicating witj other factions outside WV and/or working on opening the other vaults. That way we will get factions and NPC vault dwellers in Wastelanders
---
Exactly!! We have to stand together as a community.
---
This is a game that was suppose last forever. Servers that would never go offline. I still want that.
---
It only stops at 5 because its the internal container cap though.
---
In short, theyre kinda buggy. Some produce regularly and some never do. Its been an issue since beta and hasnt really been fixed yet.
---
They're legendary named weapons with specific and decent stats but nothing earth shaking or mind blowing which you unlock for completing work intense but not actually challenging weekly challenges.
---
For instance there's Medical Malpractice a .44 which gives you healing bonuses with critical shots which was awarded for getting 50 critical shots in VATS. And Sole Survivor for completing 50 events. The Guarantee is a mini nuke launcher that you get for killing 50 each of common mobs (scorched, muties, canines, etc.)
---
And do try your hand at survival. It used to be pretty cutthroat but now it's just adventure mode sans fast travel with slightly higher penalties for death and a markedly higher concentration of assholes.
---
no.  they were jumping the whole time.  tactic i have seen PvP'ers use.
---
berry mentats, there ya go!  ok, that explains me not able to hide.
---
another good reply.  thanx.
---
what? someone that's aware Bethesda has banned people for third party software?
---
Is that the love birds from the top floor of the shed by the agriculture building
---
i got a down vote for this?  wtf?
---
'shitty' and 'petty' are judgements. Your judgements. And your judgement means shit cause you're not a mod. The point of an open forum like this is that, aside from enforcing the basic rules created by mods, nobody gets to silence or shove aside others' opinions based on nothing more than personal bias. Instead, everyone gets to have their say. 
---
If you don't like what you see, don't click on it, don't read it. It's easy.
---
They were added finally this past month or so, doubt they were removed.
---
Try and keep the red rocket to the south untouched is what I say, then you can beeline through a bunch of violet flux to the manhole
---
Honestly I feel the same way about photos and the camera. We know that there will be some sort of bucketlist quest to take photos of landmarks. And they will be adding some daily challenges (this was the first thing I thought when I saw it on the roadmap). But I hoping that they add some more Sheepsquach related quest like they did yesterday (it was two new sidequest).
---
I'm a level 162, still having a blast. I play solo and with a team. I feel like there is plenty to do. There are the events, workshops to claim, camp to build, farming for nuked flora to make serums. It's not perfect,  but it's fun or I wouldn't play it lol
---
You‚Äôre doing it right. Have fun, there is plenty other filthy casuals doing the same! Check out the other subs for less whining.üòâ‚úåÔ∏è ü¶Ü
---
I'd like if the skin for the pipe gun made it look like it was just made rather than really worn. We are crafting them new in some cases, it would be cool to see clean unrusted metal and clean wood.
---
Bethesda does not make ESO, that's Zenimax.  Bethesda's idea of "dungeons" is the same as in all of their single player games.  When they reference what everyone assumed this would be they're far more specific and we're not getting "high level raids" until the summer just like it says in the roadmap.

are you really that much of a jerk to point out he was off by 27 days? his point is still valid

Also, talking with friends about changes in government without actually voting is commonplace... discussion has inherent value regardless of whether it enacts change... holy balls how old are you.

It's a good song but it really sucks that they used a cover instead of the original. Plus the song is super overused now.
---
&gt; That's the dumbest thing ever,inside the vault is Bethesda themselves,how blind are you?
---
Inside the vault is not put out by developers. Developers don't write long articles, they code, community managers and such write things like Inside the Vault. I don't hold them to the same standard as a dev. If the devs had said on stage Arktos was done and in next patch and it wasn't I would be pissed. That somebody messed up in an article isn't worth my time or effort to be outraged.
---

Run through it again when theres no one in there and everything will spawn

Sigh. I finally bit the bullet and sold all my two stars today. Got to the point yesterday after work where my stash was full and I had to wear my excavator armor just to move around; rather than waste fusion cores I shut down early.
---
If they ever want to make fun challenging content they would need to nerf both or add a new method of damage and cancel out all existing abilities so they have a normalized testing field.
---
Bro maybe you should move

This sub calls out Bethesda constantly. Many of the highest rated posts of all time are calling Bethesda out.
---
Lyons did influence him.  Lyons was using the technology to help the wasteland rather than acquire and consolidate it.  Lyons allowed technology into the hands of Wastelanders.
---
A.M. was nowhere near as isolationist as the West Coast.  His goal to defeat the institute was for the protection of the Wasteland.  Not to take its tech and lock it away.  To eradicate it to prevent synths from replacing humanity because he views them as abominations.  The same type of threat posed by the Supermutants, ferals and the Enclave itself.  Rather than permit the use of that tech, he wanted it destroyed as it was too dangerous to permit to exist.
---
He allowed limited improvements to technology that would benefit the Wasteland rather than just smash and grabs to collect, tag and hoard all dangerous tech.  He wanted tech to be traded for food and medicine instead.  Teagan is the one who is rewarding you for taking what you need from the Wasteland after giving communities the option to aid the cause.
---
He brokered enough compromise between the Lyons ideals and the WC that he was able to bring the Outcasts back into the fold
---
Not saying I'll nuke you but are you on PC, PS4 or XBox....?
---
SPOILER!! If you go to an armour workbench and go to headwear then press ‚Äútoggle unlockable‚Äù you will see an Easter bunny head listed as free, clicking on it will take you to the atom shop Easter deathclaw egg
---
Dude! Spot on. Wasteland on Amiga 1988.
---
It was almost completely reading and easter eggs. Best game i ever played.
---
I was in a nuked harpers ferry just now. Only regular super mutants spawned above ground :(
---
I'm not 100% sure on this but I believe you can and I think I was doing this earlier in the game with different power armor. I run power armor all the time. I'm a bloodied build so I need options on the fly sometimes, but I run 3 chest pieces in the hot wheel, jet pack, stealth , and emergency protocols.  The way you put armor in the wheel is go into you pip boy scroll down to the armor and favorite the piece. That will automatically put this in the wheel. Obviously you have noticed when you try and hot wheel first and then you look for the piece or suit is not in the list.  But this should work and I hope this helps you. Cheers
---
Yeah, that's why so many of the highest-rated posts of all time are calling Bethesda out, right?
---
Then why hype it up to be something far more than it actually is
---
I anticipated the asshole factor.  I'll probably give it a go i just need to remember not to carry around so much aid.
---
I got super lucky and found some armor that gives 20% weight reduction on all weapons. There is hope.
---
My TSE gauss cant even one hit a level 62 ghoul or radrat :(
---
I agree fully, and I'm probably what many would consider OP.  I was a little disappointed at first, given the warning that solo players may find it difficult, but overall I find it a nice new spot for farming legendary gear.  Plus, it's a large, very atmospheric location packed with lots of enemies.  It's basically another version of the Whitespring, and that's always welcome since Watoga is no longer a farming spot. (killing harmless robots always felt a little mean, especially when they take a bullet midway through trying to greet you)
---
I think content should be playable for all skill levels.  I'm very cool with difficult events, and never hate on enthusiastic lowbies that actually try to help the best they can.  (I do find campers pretty tasteless, like a spoiled prince letting his servants do everything while backing in the glory of achievement)  The only way low levels can get loot from a tough event is by participating, and really proficient, high level players can complete the event even with "lowbies not contributing/buffing the boss".  
---
Real challenge comes when 1-3 OP players are doing the lion's share of the work on an event like Encryptid or Scorched Earth for the rest of the participants, just for the benefit of creating a challenging fight for ourselves and sharing wealth with the rest of the server who may not be as strong for a variety of reasons, including factors they can't control like physical disability, mental illness or an inability to play for hours at a time due to real-life obligations.
---
If Bethesda creates legitimate "difficult" content with really good rewards, I think that the community will do a good job of sharing with those that don't have the power or ability to do it themselves.  Maybe not the very best or rarest stuff, but I've certainly tossed plenty of 1-2 star instigating/anti-armor/furious weapons at lower level players to get them started on the OP train.  Lets say you need to save up some new kind of scrap to create a new type of armor or weapon that drops from the raid/dungeon/etc.  I drop extra ultracite in blue station suitcases all the time, because it's kinda heavy and I have no need for 100's of units.  I keep a stack of 50 for making serums/ammo and give the rest away.  I usually see 2-3 bags with extra sheepsquatch clothing items every time I run the event, so it's not terribly difficult to get the full set if you like that stuff.
---
Yeah that's so damn annoying.
---
This is how I feel about, "Salt Pork, West Virginia" (aka Mack Neal)

An absolutely timeless banger.

Guess I gotta look more closely then! Thanks!

I've changed mine, everything still working just fine
---
north barrows entrance to get more outside flux.
---
I did it today on my own and there were a lot of ghouls, more than I saw yesterday and a few 3 star legendaries. I'm definitely nuking it tomorrow.
---
Time to move.
---
Saved alot of money on voice acting and creating character models.They were able to just use in game assests this way.It made the game much cheaper to produce.Its painfully obvious why it was done this way.
---
Walk the road between Watoga and Bog Town. You will see them. There are several entrances along the way.
---
That sounds like the line of questioning from someone who hopes to NUKE MY TRADING POST

How am I supposed to make a living selling purified water if all of the water HAS NUCLEAR FALLOUT in it?! What am I supposed to do, sell Nucelaar WASTE?!
---
(Ps I'm on Xbox)
---
stop and re-read your TLDR: THESE are all the perks/equipment put int he game by Bethesda.  Are you seriously telling us that we are wrong for choosing perks put in the game  by the game developers?
---
Isnt the whole point of a game where you level up to get stronger is to level up and get stronger?  youa re really blaming game players for this?
---
If Bethesda put  ALL these perks and weapon combos int he game, shouldnt Bethesda have corresponding content for when people level up and get stronger?
---
how are you not grasping this!?!?!?!?!
---
Run through it again when no one is in there and all the enemies will be in there
---
Bethesda games aren't about dodging and using skill. They use simple controls. I wouldn't mind some mechanics like dodging AoEs or having to turn on valves or something for some reason, but I'm not looking for Dark Souls in a BGS game.
---
 Me too man.  Fallout is my favorite thing ever, I've consumed literal weeks of it between game time, lore, and commentary.  
---
  But this game has thrown a wrench in everything from the lore, the consistency, it's split the user base...
---
  It's so obvious they really don't care about it. 
---
I want it to be good... So bad
---
Well by the time you get to the Enclave its the same story repeated 5 times with a little variance. Responders had some success with basic survival stuff like food and water and teamwork, all died. Raiders survived for awhile but killed each other through infighting. Free States worked on cures and discovered things about cryptids, all died. Brotherhood all died fighting the scorched. Enclave AI killed all the members, but is still responsible for nuke sites, cargobot drops, orbital bombings, etc. 
---
They set up a cool back drop but even flipping the script once or twice would have been amazing. Imagine discovering Abbie is alive at the end of the Free States quest, only to witness her die im person. Would be soul crushing.
---
So what is the max medium sized purifiers that makes sense?
---
I moved to the Free States cause Last I checked... ITS STILL A FREE COUNTRY. No government interference or Commies mucking things up!!!
---
Well yes i get that but that's not what i meant.
---
Yep, this guys a COMMIE telling me TO MOVE
---
People say dumb words, world goes insane.
---
So are some of the lowest rated posts and comments.
---
Heard the cryolator is great to suppress her.
---
Well before.
---
It was however 'popularised' when the devs introduced the mechanic that allowed for the workshop to be contested from anywhere within the relevant area rather than from the workshop itself.
---
YES!!!! this is just what i said a bit ago! thank you!!!   Its like common sense escapes fanboys
---
It was a fun little ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù. But not much challenge using a basic 1* AA 50 cal and power armor.
---
I have that as well but sadly it is not on my Power armor :( so the effect does not work when i am in it
---
You know I never even thought to look for other subs lol going to do that now! Then go do my USA. Walking around the forest not doing any missions.
---
Creepy as f¬•‚Ç¨k!
---
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go!
---
You sir are the one with a misunderstanding of what "dungeon" means. 
---
Also in previous ES titles (eso excluded) I don't recall hearing anything referred to as dungeons. Mines, caves, crypts, ruins? yes; dungeons? No.
---
Everyone into gaming knows what "dungeon" means and Bethesda once again missed the mark my a mile.
---
Except for the locker plans, which, as I said, aren‚Äôt appearing as read, despite buying and reading them twice.
---
Is there anyone out there that can read above a 3rd grade level ?
---
Did this event with my scrub team last night. Felt like the whole server jumped in when the event started. We tanked the pylons and the imposter was dead before the gutsies showed up. Was fun while it lasted though.
---
You're in trouble as a solo if none of the randoms takes the pylons. Maybe recruit a couple of players on a discord first.
---
Well last I checked most retailers were giving this game for free and trying to get rid of them because no one bought them and Bethesda has to keep stock holders in the company happy and will lie about how great it is on stage despite numbers saying otherwise. Also few games go on discount in a month unless they aren't selling to well.
---
It's under the statues, where the mini deathclaw and power armor guy are
---
again that goes back to my original point - having to run a certain build to complete the game.  i dont want to run a bloodied build so just dont play this aspect of the game?  yeah thats gonna lose more players that satisfy them.
---
so now i have to invest time to have 2 max level characters just to finish the game?  why dont the higher lvl players just make new characters to go back to a lower lvl to get a challenge?  thats literally what your asking others to do
---
And the thing is that there's nothing wrong with them adding easier content for more casual players. Not everyone who plays the game has even launched a nuke yet. It's not like every person who plays this game just sits and grinds SBQs or whatever. Adding content to the base game experience rather than the endgame is just as important for the game's longevity as endgame content is.
---
&gt; How am I supposed to make a living selling purified water if all of the water HAS NUCLEAR FALLOUT in it?!
---
Look on the brightside, the water may have radiation in it, but the heat of the nuclear blast probably killed off the bacteria :)
---
It‚Äôs an Instigating Fat Man w Limb Damage if I do recall.
---
Yeah, I play it like I do every other FO game... just, this one happens to have other players in it. I make oddball builds, I wander, I explore... some days I level up a few times, other's not at all. I'm just having fun with it, and the payoff, in that context, is awesome.
---
It's called "Salt Pork, West Virginia," and It's definitely my favorite
---
PHILADELPHIAAAAAA

Sorry, should have stated, on Xbox one x. Level...118, 19 I don‚Äôt remember atm, but I know how plans are supposed to work.
---
Meh. Everybody says dumb shit when they were young. That's what being young is for. If you grew up in the 80's and early 90's homophobia was not only tolerated but activity encouraged back then as well. Maybe not the worst time in history to be gay, but still a pretty disgusting time. Also Oxhorn has a dedicated group of tryhard trolls trying to knock him down because their lives must suck that much. 
---
Ultimately though, why should I give a flying fuck about Oxhorns opinion on homosexuality? He makes gaming videos, he's not running for office.
---
Nice one. I actually tried it. You still get a downvote.
---
Sounds like you played the game a ton. You liked it enough to play it that much they must have done a good job.  Their intent is for us to play together. The story is the world is nuked.  We are the first above ground.  It‚Äôs a DESOLATE WASTELAND  and it feels creepy.  When you see players that initial thought ‚Äúis this person nice? Should I try and befriend them? Or are they about to shoot my head off to survive?‚Äù Is what they wanted.  That‚Äôs realistic. I‚Äôm sorry you quit. But maybe you‚Äôll come back as they add more content.  I play quite a bit I‚Äôm only level 70. So I guess maybe you just exhausted it too quickly.
---
I agree. I ran it last night and got 4 1* and nothing useful. Now I have more 1* filling my stash until the vendor comes out.
---
i 100% agree duping ruined a large portion of ht game, its true ... and its bethesda fault for leaving the developers room open to glitching in
---
i started playing after all the duping was going on, and i agree its bullshit, but bethesda never should have allowed it in the first place
---
&gt;we are constantly disappointed at nearly every turn
---
Sure sounds like you defend the game a lot... rofl.
---
You realize that the vanilla game is basically easy-medium difficulty? That's what every single vanilla Fallout experience is by default, but since this is online it's locked in for all of us. Wait for the hardmode servers and the raids if you want something challenging. Otherwise you're on the same casual ride as everyone else and I have no idea why you would expect something different from a simple instanced dungeon.
---
What happens if you fail and the game is mass nuked?

Wow thats awesome you got one!!!!! I seriously had looked, but zenith's I saw with the same horse track bezel were like $300! I need to get lucky and find that!! So jealous! How does the transmitter work? If you care to explain? Probably a lot simpler than the ideas I have floating in my head
---
&gt; I don't get those guys with sentinel/assasin gear, killing each other at whitespring survival.
---
Survival: A wretched hive of scum and villainy
---
It's not a "problem"... the game specifically tells you that you can only have one food buff at a time. The last one you ate is it.
---
So no matter how they cox him...ILL STAY RIGHT HEREEEEE
---
Usually solo, casual here, too.
---
@27, you should be able to do cottage row @ whitesprings, nuked or not, especially if you have PA.  
---
Yes, it will be tough, but you can do it, especially if you have a good melee weapon and some stimpacks.
---
Unnuked, you should get mostly normal ghouls around L32 instead of the usual bloated glowing ones when it is a nuke zone.
---
Failing that, server hop until it is not nuked, or temp adapt a partner to watch your back while you do what needs to be done to get the sword.
---
Aw man :(
---
Now I have an idea for my next nuke launch lol
---
Definitely underwhelming once you finish, but I still spent a good hour walking through the tunnels familiarizing myself with the area before I went on to the boss. Anybody saying they finished it in five minutes just blindly followed the quest marker and ignored the actual dungeon part of the dungeon. That removes any validity from their criticisms in my eyes
---
Ditto, I got one last night as well.
---
I just had to. All the downvotes are probably the ones who also tried it.
---
Haven't seen any posts about it, but yeah I've only noticed it since the last update, PS4 btw.
---
I would love a vendor who just sells legs... like actual legs... because I‚Äôm insane
---
Actually in ESO all the content is leveled to you, so there's even less of an actual "endgame" there. You've got veteran stuff, but it's still just the same as the main game.
---
At the time Oxhorn was merely... roleplaying
---
Yeah. I played during the dupenning. I understand things happens but personally I think it should‚Äôve been stopped a lot sooner than it was. Like I said, love the game, but some things could have and should be done better.
---
I would, but my stash is already full of 2-3 stars. I got 1 somewhat useful weapon and a piece of armor that's okay.
---
Weapon was executioners black powder rifle and the armor was an unyielding leg.
---
Plus when you tab something for vending, you can approach your machine and just press the ‚Äústore all junk‚Äù button but you store items tabbed for sale
---
People aren‚Äôt as friendly as you might think.  Once you finish the quests it‚Äôs just running nukes and dailies.   Yes I loved the game until I finished everything.
---
Maybe the devs are just really bad at video games and literally don't play anything...so this was really challenging to them lol.
---
Honestly if this were the case, it'd explain a lot.
---
Not only is it nukable, the 50-100 ghouls all respawn every time a new player enters, including closing app, as well as additional nukes. The legendary spawn rate is already rediculous without nuking it, so you can get 15 to 20 legendaries each spawn. It's random between no stars and 3 stars depending on the level of the area at the burrows. If it's low level you'll only get no stars no matter how much you respawn the ghouls. If it's high level you'll basically be rolling in a ton of 3 stars.
---
Ok cool thank you!
---
Because that is literally the job of a marketing department.  Inside the Vault isn't a patch notes submitted by the dev team, it's advertising.
---
If a nuke is dropping just log out for 3mins and come back. Maybe you will even get more customers.
---
Honestly it's not worth hoarding legendaries at this point unless you absolutely have nothing else to do with your space. There is still over a month left, with more content coming between then and now. You'll find more legendaries you actually use in that time, and you'll keep finding more that you don't.
---
I dunno man, I disagree; I'm big on evolving environments A-la Guild wars 2, where things might start off a certain way; but the story can change and the world can change, it gives it a very interesting feel.
---
Yeah you play much different than me haha. I‚Äôve spent well more than half my time customizing weapons and armor. And making giant elaborate camps. I still haven‚Äôt launched a nuke myself yet. I‚Äôll get there some day. But the game is so fun.  If you‚Äôre on PS4 you should check out my camp.
---
Should every callout post about every issue, real or imagined, be heaped with praise? That would also be a "hivemind".
---
People upvote issues they agree with, downvote issues they don't. Myself included. I thought the Burrows was overhyped, but anyone who finished it in 5 minutes blatantly bumrushed the quest markers to finish it ASAP.
---
Im not. Its a crap version compared to John Denver.
---
Came here to say this. glad I wasn't the only one
---
Lets push this higher! Maybe they release it earlier then. And if they give a legendary vendor this would make the grind worth it as we can finally get useful gear, still haven't found a perfect 10mm pistol legendary and my build is trash without proper pistol.
---
Sorry, typed it on my phone.
---
I know you can't stack buffs. But in the previous patch, taking a lower buff of the same type, so +10 Carry Weight, would not override if you already had +20 Carry Weight active from another item. You would get the HP from the item and that is it.
---
The first time I walked into the parlor, I was sneaking around because I didn't know if there would be any enemies.  I stood up to read the terminal and I hear a sloshy, robotic "WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?" It was so perfectly timed.
---
Then there is no hope for us. üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
No, because his same "religious" beliefs seem to have led him to the conclusion that making as much money as possible is what the bible teaches haha. I am not in anyway surprised he has managed to lie to himself to make both of those things fit together, up to and including offering up a fake apology to keep his YouTube going. 
---
That guy is a walking/talking cringe fest.

Thanks I didn‚Äôt know about that. Normally I have to spin my character to the right direction and search the whole map in a line üòê

Sort of like I'm at Whitesprings, plz don't nuke me.
---
Sorry dude, call Appalachian Movers, Inc.
---
Are you gonna sell that prime receiver? I need it
---
In all seriousness, I moved back to Harper's Ferry because of this &amp; the Legendary Vendor being set up nearby

Or can you mod my lever action to the prime version?

I logged in yesterday and got the flowery egg, logged in today 24 hours later and it‚Äôs still the same egg. Did I miss yesterday‚Äôs egg by a small amount or has it not updated yet?

Personally I kind of figured this is what it would be. The vaults are what they are marketing as the raid and end game.
---
Still jump on this one, there is still lots of cool kids you can get tips and info from. üòé
---
Except...we aren't Government or Commies so ...
---
I have all those perks and I still tend to die once or twice at least
---
you can tame animals send them to your camp just google it i dont wanna explain
---
Same here in different location....had a level 50+ 3-star liberator in the bog last night. Dropped a G D M'Fn level 5 unyielding raider leg.  I am level 91 and was the only person on the map. Frustrating for sure
---
I wiped the dungeon with a quad lvl 35 lever action rifle.
---
That's in no way an overpowered weapon....
---
We are the best and brightest after all
---
You on PC?
---
... :(
---
They did get killed by the scorch....
---
Moisture farmer huh?  I hear business is better on Tatooine.
---
So it‚Äôs Hunter/Hunted but they cut out the middleman and make the Sheepsquatch the hunter
---
Yeah... sounds a lot like something a red gud fer nuthin Commie or Taxation Theiving Gubment official would say! Keep your hands of my RIGHTS AND GUNS
---
I want one or two places in the game that are just hilariously ridiculously stuffed to the brim with scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens and glowing deathclaws and behemoths. Sort of as a shooting range for those overpowered god characters, but also to test your mettle against the toughest stuff imaginable. I'm sure most of you would do this at one point in the single player games, just decide to spawn in a fuckton of bosses via the console to see how your weapons would do. Even if it's flat out objectively impossible, it would be nice to have that kind of endgame "goal" to work towards
---
Let me know when that Leg Vendor shows up... I need decorations to hang out of my trunk.
---
Or recon mod for x-01 helmet, same result and works with any weapon. Kind of wish we could get it for other helmets.
---
Hmm meta changed like 2 to 3 months ago..... and you call me a casual...
---
Suck her oily blood with full auto vampire's guns on top of the resists.. and suppressor perk helps
---
in an MMO? you dont say.
---
want harder enemies? use pipe weapons and pipe wrenches.  similar logic.
---
whats the point of having different perks/weapons/classes if everyone has to run the same thing to finish the game?
---
so because people want to run clearly OP damage builds, i cant play the game and finish it how i want?
---
What platform are you on? I still need to pay forward the nice person that escorted me to the sword. Tried with a level 16 I saw once, but that person got spooked and didn't trust me - ran off without the sword after I'd cleared the building for them.
---
I do not fooking care about a ban for that - it is such a basic feature that must have been present even in the beta. I just started playing now because I knew the game was full of bugs.
---
I'd do that, but unfortunately the game does not let me use healing items while shooting my gatling plasma. It's nocturnal explosive with a beam splitter, so it tears up the impostor. I'd be willing to tank the pylons but it feels like a waste not being the dedicated DPS. It seemed like I did a majority of the damage the time I did it with only a few others.
---
Don't worry they probably going to have it fixed in the next update. Only bad news next update not till next month so we going to be waiting for awhile and unlikely to be hot fixed based on how often they prefer doing it during a regular update instead. Till then I will hold onto my XO Jetpack mod and XO blue headlamp mod till then.
---
OwO
---
Doesn't seem to have updated yet. I'ma try a restart soon as I finish this daily! Ill let u know if it changes.
---
It took just 5 minutes for me
---
Mate it's the subreddit name
---
I mean, I'm running a full shotgun perk loadout.  I use my combat for health regen, dB to finish stuff off, and am looking for a good main damage gun.  Anyone have any idea how the legendary vendor is going to work?
---
You should avoid being near cities in general with your camps
---
Well one would think they might communicate with them for some advice at least.
---
Oof
---
Nice new take on it, did it naked but never with a walking cane, will I be allowed to use my mutations?
---
This is very typical of MMO-type games (76 isn't 'massive' due to server caps but it's clearly developing within the same genre parameters). If you're expecting DLC type content you'd better hold your breath for a year or two because that's how long that kind of content takes for basically every other MMO... and it's typically called an expansion.
---
Updates that release every month or so are almost always going to involve short, repeatable type content. I don't know if you're new to this kind of situation but you may want to practice some expectation management if you keep playing 76. xD
---
#WEST VIRGINIAAAAAAAAA
---
To be fair, I soloed it at level 38 with a non legendary 10mm pistol and a hazmat suit.
---
Nice...
---
Costanza!
---
Not really I mean you load into a building it acts like there's 4 players in an event it could adjust my actual player count. The events change on the fly depending on how many people are are in it or leave. So I think it could be doable.
---
To each their own. That's why I loved it. The organic finding of story was great.
---
Now if we just had a way to hide all the friggin tapes in a submenu without mods, we'd be set.
---
Did my first run last night solo, on my lvl 58 secondary. Nobody was in it, but there were some dead bodies and meat piles here and there. It took about 35 minutes and I went at a decent pace. I was using the Sole Survivor from last weeks Survival challenge and a Handmade Rifle in Auto(commando and stealth build). Ghouls would drop in 2-5 hits depending on the weapon used. I never took damage. There were probably 30-40 ghouls and a half-dozen Mr Gutsy's. I got 13 legendary items if you count The Gutter. All 1\*, but still. I sold all but two and made about 300 caps I think.

I wasn't really expecting a huge dungeon like most people seemed too, but it could definitely have more going on for sure. Overall though, I'd still go there to farm some legendaries as my level 58 could still use some 1\* stuff, plus it's a nice looking location. And as OP said, it gives me a reason to visit the Mire more.
---
For improvements, I think just adding a level 91 Glowing Deathclaw somewhere, maybe some mirelurks and glowing ghouls.
---
Level 182 with 300+ hours so far, I play pretty much exclusively solo. I reached that point where it felt too easy, I ended up with hundreds of stimpaks and nearly a thousand nuka cherries/canned dog food. Then I began to realize that the game is balanced more towards the majority casual players and not the dedicated minority, so I began putting restrictions on myself to reach the difficulty I want. It's nice though that even as a MMO with PvP elements, the game lets you live out the RPG power fantasy of being a demigod if you want to

For anyone who wants to hear a cool cover, Celtic Punk style, listen to the Black Tartan Clans version.

Moderators already stated they looking into fixing it, crossing my fingers they give us atoms for the missed opportunities these last two days. Side note I spent 3 hrs looking for where tourist could be at with cameras yesterday and didn't know till today its not out yet lol.
---
But then what lol how do we get the next one?
---
The Burrows is actually really large, with the potential to scoop up a similar amount of legendary drops as the Whitespring.  I find it amusing that players are complaining about a second gold mine to farm gear.  I was fully expecting to be able to solo it, so I wasn't that disappointed.  Just a little bit, in that it wasn't any harder than a normal Whitespring loop.  Much better, creepier atmosphere, too.
---
&gt;!Honestly, the "boss fight" was way easier than walking around the whole place.  Small room + gun-fu + AP cards + very high AG = smoking corpses.  If they were all three stars with health regen, that would have been kinda challenging.!&lt;
---
I'm not mad at it whatsoever.
---
I really hope so. If they can make Fallout 76 closer to a traditional Fallout game, they could have something really special on their hands. As it is right now, 76 just feels hollow to me.
---
Not sure what you are asking, but the answer could be is that the next egg does not get released till 8 pm EST.
---
Each Deathclaw Easter Egg will be available for free in the Atomic Shop for a limited time, starting and ending at 8:00 p.m. EDT (23:59 UTC) on the dates listed below.

PvP'ers gunning for you will just hit you that much harder if you raise a white flag.  It's just what they do.
---
Oh I know that but it seemed like he was using it as a insult..... don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt stand the fact that I like this game and they don‚Äôt...
---
Not true.
---
This is clearly a case of Bethesda unable to balance their game,not a fault of the players.
---
Is it any fun?
---
Yes, you can dodge the poison blob it shoots at you as I recall if you're quick on your feet.  You can dodge a few other things too, not many admittedly, but the blob is dodgeable if you are paying attention.
---
I think people assume that its anachronous to the alternate post 1950s history, but it's pretty close, and it sounds so much newer than the other songs because, The Beach Boys were so ahead of their time, basically shaping the future sound of rock.
---
I heard there are raider groups up in the mountains. Might be able to make a deal with them?
---
Call me a stickler but i wished they used thw John Denver original
---
But they seem to make a difference?
---
It looks like its about to drop a dis track.
---
Call me a stickler but i wished they used the John Denver original
---
&gt; Adding content to the base game experience rather than the endgame is just as important for the game's longevity as endgame content is.
---
I think it's often more important, as casual gamers are a bigger demographic than endgame raiders.
---
hot damb u got me there :‚Äô( guess i *was* wrong pwease forgive me
---
I'm level 52, I soloed it, 3 stims ,no legendaries, no radaway/rad-x and didnt die once
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing too, got lots of use out of my explosive heavies. Minigun with the tri-barrel is fantastic (normal barrel spreads way too much when shooting at the sheep). 50 cal is great too.
---
Game would be a lot better off if they weren't filled with e-Peeners out to show who's dick is bigger.
---
All your purifiers together will produce 60 per hour. If you have one, it will produce one every minute and fill up after 5 minutes. If you have 2, each one will produce one every 2 minutes and fill up after 10 minutes. And so on.
---
How do I get into the burrows?
---
Sounds no different then Whitesprings
---
I found myself thinking this while going through it. "It's just a rush of ghouls, with lots of max level 1* legendaries. Isn't that what most people end up spending their day grinding anyway?"
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
You are still saying THEY overhyped it.  Are we supposed to just ignore what they say?
---
Its in floor decor in the same tab as the vault boy lawn gnome and power armor/deathclaw mini statues
---
I got the 'Friends Welcome' sign. Nice and simple. Got the bone raider excavator last week too, just because it was bloody awesome.
---
Considering what a joke the 1,800 atom vault paint power armour was, it feels like the atom store is heading in the right direction.
---
Gotcha.
---
Its not hard if you have proper gear. Feels kinda mobby but if you have the right weapons it shouldnt be a problem.  
---
I use my instigating lever action that's lvl 35 for the whole area.
---
And then you hit the account total weight limit....
---
That's because it technically is unfinished. Gonna get in that presidential room eventually üòè
---
maybe this is xbox only??? ps4 u always need the disc
---
How about that guy who's 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide, would love to see what that would look like.
---
Yes, PS4
---
More ghouls, but basically. Also, lots easier to get lost.
---
The communication was the issue
---
I saw other people say the quest finished for them even when another player killed the boss. You can go all the way further, past the "do not enter!" door and past a computer into a deeper part of the facility. You will know the boss room when you see it. Don't expect anything grandiose though, it's the kind of boss that would generally just be a crowned enemy in other dungeons
---
Meanwhile the rest of reddit is saying burrows are EZ
---
Which is literally always their problem.
---
\*They\* don't manage your expectations. \*You\* manage your expectations. 
---
Interaction with difficulty is a highly subjective thing, what's easy to one can be hard to another. Therefore it's up to the individual to estimate their talent and how hard something will go based on that and other variables like gear, build, etc..
---
Oh and when they do try to balance OP weapons, people scream "NERFS RUINING THE GAME".
---
All I did was correct his poor sense of time. I made no argument against his point. If his argument is weak enough that correcting misinformation almost invalidates it, that's pathetic.
---
that was always my experience, including for other games but its still continuing to work fine without it and i have no explanation
---
Anyone else feel the OP is just karma farming now?
---
If you expect things they didn't promise then they will perpetually "under deliver" in your eyes.
---
No.   Marsupial makes a difference being able to jump away from them.   I find if you are tagged by the sheep, it's game over
---
I assumed Bethesda screwed it up tbh. Lol I‚Äôm interested if this is true
---
I thank you all for your help, I did check all that, but I did a repair and it is there now so I guess [closed]
---
Mate I'm the guy who called you a casual
---
When he inserts those opinions into gaming videos, you may want to give that flying fuck. And it seems he's done that more than once. :-p
---
I have a maximum endurance unarmed tank character. I have no problems tanking her. I have near 400 HP with 300 armor, blocker, and lone wanderer perk. I also have a legendary that reduces damage 15% while blocking.
---
If I block her attacks, I lose maybe 10% of my HP. Unblocked attacks take off maybe 30%. It is difficult to tell how much damage I am taking due to constant conduit damage.
---
If I forget to bring along stimpacs, I can die. But I do not get one shot by her. I tank the shit out of her damage. It is a shame the same cannot be said for player damage.
---
Ok, weirdly logical question.  If you take a workshop in survival mode and someone contests it and then kills you do they get the lower cap reward?
---
Because if so claiming workshops in survival just got even more useful then just havong additional fast travel points and stash boxes.
---
True. Bethesda game studios Austin is a fairly young studio and FO76 is realistically their first title. I will not mention the expertise that the studio had before Bethesda bought it.
---
You can balance in other ways besides nerfing.
---
My understanding from Bethesdas post was the eggs would swap in the atom shop every day at 7pm EST. So the second wouldn't be available until this evening
---
Its a instigating fatman with limb damage and faster reload. Link below shows the weeklies weapons.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview
---
My making everything even stronger?
---
escapism
---
My testing puts it between 50-70% after 10 shots, which roughly matches up with what another player was finding. The math is rough though, I had armor on so it‚Äôs probably closer to a 50-60% buff and the extra damage acted as armor piercing skewing the final damage after armor higher. 
---
So approximately 5% stacking per shot, to maybe 50% cap
---
I *really* miss the companion phone/tablet app from FO4. Prop the tablet up next to my monitor and keep it in local map mode, never get lost.
---
If he was truly a bigot and an ardent Christian-- as he seemed to be in past posts-- I don't think he would sacrifice his religious ethos for ad money. So that kind of undermines your point.
---
Who really knows what goes on in another person's head though. xD
---
Youre correct but someone spread the wrong rumor and people now think its a legit egg hunt
---
Fully agree, and I'm definitely in the OP category.  People without 3-star bespoke everything should be able to do everything on Adventure mode, to some degree of "oh shit".  I'm not saying everything should be diet lite version.  I had all I could handle at lvl 30-ish when a Scorchbeast attacked my camp in the Ash Heap, and killing it felt like a real victory.
---
If they add in some kind of "high levels only" server, that's fine.  I'm not interested in PvP, so I've never set foot in Survival mode.  No one should be punished because they don't have the time/ability to "git gud".
---
" **If you want to stop being disappointed in new releases, stop over hyping them yourselves.** "   
---
INB4 people start talking about they were just hyped to get a game that works.
---
8 pm but otherwise yes.
---
Yeah i have you added
---
It's nothing like that. The shop will have the next one for free at 8 pm EDT.
---
You can keep pretending like they didn't promise or say anything all you want.
---
Wont change the way things are.
---
Double checked, it's actually 8pm Eastern time

Haha yeh I had to google cause I never heard it also got pushed back. But I knew thered be mention of the tourist so thankfully I didnt go looking!
---
Okay I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm wrong. :)
---
Totallt hasnt updated. Ill check later I guess. üòê
---
For me the story behind it was pretty meh, I was excited for some more BoS story but I really didn't get that. The story of the guy who was replaced by Robots was fine and so was the story of the self proclaimed King but you can find lore like that in most locations.
---
It felt like someone had created a new location and made a quest just so it felt like new content.
---
heck yes!
---
Would be even better if once an item was placed in the vending machine/container, its weight was no longer counted against your stash.
---
  On one level, the risk of losing items via sale should prevent (at least some) for abuse (using the vending machine as extra storage).  
---
On the other hand...as I think about that and consider what people do with workshop resources, I can easily imagine some people setting up (multiple) vending machines at a camp in some obscure area of the map, then walling them off...
---
Guess we'll just have to wait and see how its implemented, and go from there.
---
4? I've only received the wolf and radstag.
---
It doesn't work like that. All the eggs will be in the shop. It will change at 8 pm EDT everyday. Check out the Atom Shop updates article in the Bethesda Launcher. Or (here)[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales] if you are on console.
---
I never hear anyone else say they loved "let's ride in to the sunset together" from NV
---
F N A
---
And you came up with that conclusion  that I‚Äôm casual because....
---
A real character development system would be the first place to start.Followed by actual game mechanics to fights that require more than just mindlessly blasting away,how about that?? 
---
You know...the things online multiplayer games have been built on for the last 20 years??
---
There are 4 white pieces of paper on the board in the office.
---
Oh, that's what you're talking about. That isn't very feasible with melee.
---
And I *do* take the Assaultron beam to the face. It barely does damage with 400+ energy resistance, lone wanderer, and dodgy.
---
Youll get plenty of hate indeed
---
Maybe I'm thinking of the energy explosives.
---
Well, they did it exactly the way it works in every Fallout game.
---
Gotcha I appreciate the help everyone it seems I was a bit missinformed in the beginning about the eggs but I understand now.
---
It should be John Denver not his kid
---
you need a better hobby
---
TS is junk on a shotgun, it just adds a single extra pellet (so 9 instead of 8). However, E is amazing, because it adds 20% of total damage per pellet, so on a shotgun it‚Äôs adding 160%.
---
Overall it makes TSE work on shotguns, but it‚Äôs more from the beneficial E bug than the poor TS bug.
---
Or so I‚Äôve heard, anyway.
---
I noticed that "Nails in My Coffin" was in there the other day. I was ecstatic and surprised I hadn't noticed it before.
---
I'm a big fan of country and wish there were more renditions of Hank Williams or Bob Wills in these games.
---
Probably, those are gone
---
Uh this isn't Bethesda, this is the same team that came out with Battlecry. Just like how ESO isn't Bethesda, neither is this team. This is the team that started out with Battlecry (Battlecry studios). They are all part of Zenimax Studios and should be held to the same standards. Also let's not forget which team is working on Blades. All of their different game studios have been slipping on quality.
---
I actually really enjoyed the Burrows lol
---
You two set that up didn't you?
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
"Innocent".
---
Nah I don‚Äôt think anything does. I run full unyielding with about 30 luck at all times. I get 1 stars all the time, drop rates are just trash haha
---
Not reachable via ranged weapon(s)?
---
I first killed one at that fort right outside of watoga. After getting the gatling gun, they became so much easier to take down. Level 82 and can handle solo
---
I get that you are ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and all. But it seems you really want to play. Just make another profile and move on.
---
Maybe one day they will get back to you or maybe they wont.
---
Someone explain?
---
TS adds a second bullet, total damage is increased by 25%. However, it decreases accuracy from hipfire dramatically (the two shots can go entirely different directions),  aiming down sights reduces it a lot but you still get some divergence between the two. It also increases durability loss significantly, I think 2x due to it firing twice as often.
---
Have same problem and no fix to my knowledge, got 6 of them myself and sometimes 1 or 2 won't produce and others seem slower where some might have 1 water or two waters. Might just be another bug to add to the list of bugs :(.
---
Build looks good to me.
---
Hotpink paint grenades that have a 48 hour duration and don't initiate PvP.
---
"YoU sHoUlD AvOiD bEiNG..." FREE STATES BROTHERIN, YOU KNOW WE ARE FREE TO LIVE WHERE WE PLEASE.
---
But you're right, these cities are full of mutants and Commie Sympathisin' folk
---
I agree.  &gt;!They came up with a gorgeous location and plopped a tired, endlessly recycled story voiced by Negan Impostor.  If they're capable of recruiting talent like whoever wrote dialogue for Biv, Mr.Squeeze and Insult Bot, making a fairly cohesive quest narrative shouldn't be an issue.  Whomever is writing Shear Terror/unsolved cases needs to take over for the stoned intern that scribbled up Waste Management in less than an hour.!&lt;
---
I think people are just confused because the current egg has been in the shop for over 24 hours, but starting today at 8pm EDT they will switch :)
---
Recently? I am a casual viewer of his, so it is very possible he‚Äôs said something relatively recent that I have missed.
---
Do you and your team have mics?
---
You assume Bethesda is competent at developing.
---
The only difficulty will be getting the scripts to properly trigger
---
I can help you today and on Sat or you can ask my friends we drop nukes a few times a day
---
I love the game but you don't have to wait long between smiles!  ... can we please get more music?
---
How did he oneshot you without you initiating PvP?
---
#MOUNTAIN MAMAAAAAAA#
---
The only thing nukes do is upgrading low level legendary ghouls to higher level, that‚Äôs about it. Nuke won‚Äôt turn normal ghouls into legendary ones. If there were two legendary ghouls in the entire area, one 40 another 62, you gain literally ONE max level ghoul by nuking it. Yes killing glowing ones gives you more xp etc, but you can get xp from doing WS or other areas too. 
---
Scouting the area first before nuking it will give you an idea of what you will get from all the efforts. If you only encounter one or two legendaries in the test run, you may want to save the hassle and try a different server.
---
if your daughter was older you could get her fallout 76 and secretly play with her
---
Any game published after april 1st 2018 is fine
---
Its funny cause people will spread a rumor for the giggles then suddenly theres a Bethesda hate thread saying they lied and messed up the eggs thanks for keeping the public informed
---
Also just reminding everyone that ESO was criticized much more than F76, people just look at it through rose-colored glasses
---
*sighs* i bet you are tons of fun at parties....
---
I think the bos wooden armour and rolling pins broke this is why we have legendary's running around with them it's in the lore the whole lore and nothing but the lore.
---
I can come online if you didn't get what you want
---
Armor piercing was so nerf in the previous game, I'm surprised that it could make up for 100 pts of damage.  Thx.
---
Raiders
---
agreed!
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Every fallout game before this one is single player,are you truly this dumb,or just totally unable to provide a useful response? Because it looks like the latter but I suspect the former.
---
Just log out and block them.
---
Oh, now you are telling me that Bethesda is testing this game and in all 3 platforms? Wow... I don't wanna be rude, but dude we are the testers who participated in the Beta. Bethesda is doing as little as possible what comes to testing. Yea, I can agree that team behind sounds is decent, but thats all. If I buy a game I want it is more than just sounds. There are better platforms to enjoy sounds/music than FO76.
---
What comes to developing I never said I am a developer myself or wanna take lead of FO76 developing. I know how to separate good from bad just by playing the game. I don't need to be a developer to notice this. I am a hardcore gamer who wants a real end game content and this game doesn't offer it even they have promised several times in Bethesda.
---
It doesn't matter who creates new Fallout if team has just passion to do a real good game and polish it. I already said that, but you probably didn't understood. Bethesda has no passion to polish games or finish them properly. They just create big hype with marketing team and then deliver shit as much as possible and as fast as possible before people notice what they got. Fanatic Bethesda lovers like you are just doing favor for Bethesda when trying to say that game is really good and polished. Some people might actually believe you, but in time they will see truth and will be disappointed.
---
It might be tonight at 8pm eastern time. If not, likely tomorrow, only 6 total will be released and until the 22nd so even if its tomorrow it would still work out for 1 a day after that.
---
I spent most of my time with two other friends (still have them even though I don‚Äôt have a life ) crappy/ good games are better with friends
---
This is some great life and parenting advice. Kudos to you.
---
AFAIK, a couple *****innocent***** players were targetted by the ban wave that got rid of most of the dupers a couple weeks/months ago and to this date, they still remain banned with no answer from Bethesda whatsoever.
---
Nothing happens. If you "fail" a dungeon in WoW, you just start over until you succeed; the world doesn't just end.
---
Have you closed the game and opened again to refresh the Atom Shop?  I found that if things change while still in game, the Atom Shop won't load up new stuff until you exit and start up again.
---
Yeah, I plan on doing it a couple times, but I doubt it'll be a much different experience. And there was one other guy in there, but he entered well after I did.
---
I know that my camp has been in the same spot for months and there used to only be radstags and the occasional opossums, and very rarely a few scorched would walk by. Now I get lots of mole rats eating my crops, liberators, frogs, super mutants, and a lot more scorched, and still some radstags about 1/5 the time. I've had to repair my generator about twice a week lately it seems. But it could be once a week and it's just that annoying...
---
I never said a dungeon was a cave. Also a dungeon is an underground prison. The burrows isn't an underground prison. Nor is probably most of the the uses of dungeon in a lot of games. So evidently this flies in the face of "this is why we have words for things". A "Dungeon" in a lot of games are just large underground locations with some kind of through-line to a boss and/or some special loot. That happens in the Burrows. Calling something a dungeon doesn't need to have explicit meaning in a video game. Especially since we know that vault raids are more akin to what people think of in some MMOs their Dungeons.
---
What would you call the type of location that the Burrows is, if you had to give it a singular name that engenders what it is? Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and 4, all have these kind of "dungeon" locations where you fight through an enclosed area to get to a boss and some loot. MMOs have big Group Dungeons with multiple layers and boss fights, but they don't don't get to dictate how dungeon is used for all other games.
---
Sounds about right.
---
so check before i go to bed then. gotcha.
---
They removed tse from energy weapons like the heavy gun laser, plasma Gatling
---
Yes we have mics. 
---
Can not stand when people hang around me without them. It is like having the annoying special kid on the block bouncing around you when trying to get away to play ball or something like that.
---
Pretty much
---
Thanks! But u don't think I should switch anything around like rad sponge for field surgeon or mysterious savior for anything?
---
Have you been to Camp Venture?
---
They have plans for _Robot_ armor everywhere.  It's obvious why they died.  That stuff is garbage.
---
It's breaking my heart to dump the legendary's I have no room for and I'm getting a wee bit fed up being almost at max weight limit I just hope they don't put it back.
---
I don't mind some hate. People need to stop mindlessly defending things. There are issues, and ignoring them, and even defending them, isn't going to help anyone involved.
---
If it shows up at 8pm tonight, it will be there until tomorrow at 8pm.
---
Noticed something interesting on Van lowes board... a disconnected mark, the string falling loose.
---
The marker itself is west of the watoga area.
---
Maybe you shouls check it out. =)
---
The whole quest could‚Äôve been unannounced and everyone would‚Äôve thought it was just like any other level or quest. That‚Äôs the problem with it. It‚Äôs not unique in any way. They just made a metro themed level with pathetic enemies. Seriously? An assultron as the boss? Right after the sheepsquatch? That is just so damn lazy. It should‚Äôve been a suped up deathclaw or mirelurk queen. At least then the ending would‚Äôve been at least a little memorable. Even an annihilater bot would‚Äôve been better because I hardly ever see those damn things. But no we get the generic. Copy pasted assultron as the spot light enemy of the last 3 months. And after all the hype they put into this quest, no, just no man. Don‚Äôt tell me the brotherhood failed at something so fucking pathetic. The glass cavern at least makes you see and feel that an epic battle took place. The burrows should have been a responder quest. 
---
I‚Äôm really disappointed in this quest, they advertised it like it would‚Äôve been a silo in difficulty.
---
Thank you, this is the proper info I was looking for.
---
On a side note, that screen filling ad for a game I'm already playing is seriously fucking annoying.
---
I enjoyed and yes it was easy.... but isn‚Äôt everything in this game.... also fallout 4 and new Vegas were just as easy...
---
Eh, I dodge Super Mutant attacks fairly easily too.  The wind up for a Super Sledge, sledge or board is pretty easy to dodge.  Just step back a moment and they swing and miss.  Hand to hand stuff is more difficult, but sticking and moving helps reduce overall damage.  You're never going to completely avoid melee damage, but it seems a hell of a lot more realistic than two combatants standing face to face and beating each other until one drops.
---
NO you have it all *sdrawkcab*!!!!!!!!! Bethesda put all the perks and weapons in the game for us to use, therefore THEY should have anticipated these builds utilizing what they put in their game.  This is ALL on Bethesda for not having content appropriate for end game users.  
---
Anyone who blames the actual players for simply using the things Bethesda put in their game is being nonsensical.
---
I'll give that a shot! Thank you.
---
It's not my fault you have a potato build and can't figure out how to fire a shotgun.
---
 People that have been playing the game since launch are the player base as much as anyone else is, and sure as fuck more than someone that has -50 hours in game.
---
Legendary vender shot himself because they put it back in game.
---
Drugs, son. You need drugs lol. Anything to take the damage received down a notch
---
Real talk.
---
I think it's a "lore" thing, yeah.
---
Sure super mutants are easy, but from what I recall from F76 and F4 the MQ's acid attack doesn't really have a noticeable windup. If it does, it's difficult to see in melee, since she's an enormous towering crab thing.
---
Yeah I was on 2 pylons the other day and as long as I can keep landing shots I'm fine. That Vampire shotgun is the best thing I've ever found in game.
---
Same. I went though it with my level 40 alt, and had a blast. It‚Äôs definitely on my future to-do list when I wanna kill 20-30 minutes. Ended up with a legendary Tesla rifle the one time I went down. Can‚Äôt wait to hit level 50 to be able to use it.
---
not to mention with all those side pipes who knows if we ran past a secret door 
---
I mean in the photos of the burrows we saw a suit of dive armor on one of those players in the pic makes me wonder if there is something hidden in there or if more will be added to this dungeon in the future to expand on it 
---
I mean like I said so many caved in zones they could easily remove some rubble and double triple the size over time
---
Only thing you addressed with Rad Sponge.  I would swap in either Tenderizer or suppressor if RS isn't needed.  I'm not big on Mysterious Savior either but that's a personal choice.  I would take out 1 point of that leaving it a Rank 2 and get Thru Hiker maxed out.
---
If you are looking for sympathy you might find it somewhere between shit and syphilis in the dictionary.
---
All I know is I sung it a lot with my friends when we'd play games together and Fallout 3/New Vegas were big then, so when it came on in the trailer I lost myself.
---
I am having the exact same problem right now.
---
I just recently found out that there was a limited release of this version of Country Roads on a one-sided 45 vinyl only in Australia so I tracked one down and it's in the mail right now heading to the states.  Can't wait to hear it on my old hi-fi!
---
I kill him on sight as he give me paper money God dam robot :)
---
&gt; Assuming 
---
"used for the purpose of argument to indicate a premise on which a statement can be based."
---
They were using the repair kits to support the premise of selling backpack mods on the atom store.
---
Once again, they stated.....hard diffulty group dungeon. Youre ignoring thier own statements to make your point valid.
---
Syringer. Cryolator. Reduce damage resistance, freeze, lulz
---
 The kitteh is snarling at us. ;)
---
Every single time. 
---
I almost never have the pipboy radio on so I find it extra special when I hear a song I like.
---
"Hi, thanks for playing, BUY MORE STUFF FROM THE ATOM SHOP PLEASE? PRETTY PLEASE??"
---
üôÇ
---
Awesome. Yea idk how people expect to organize a mission with emojis. 
---
I'm always down to help fellow players. Feel free to add me psn: Papertattoo
---
I got this when my camp was in the literal northeastern corner of the map, I doubled up metal walls and in seconds my entire base was destroyed and there was never a player dot near it
---
Bethesda just needs to make a "cheater server" and toss them all in that instead of baking them from a 60$ game.
---
Back before I could defend my base, I would just quickly drop my camp in the exact same spot. Your entire base would disappear. Yeah you will have to rebuild a little but in most cases you can just place the entire thing back where you had it via the blueprint it created.  That way he is just sitting there looking like an idiot.
---
Aaaaaa-greed.
---
A 5min quest is hardly over hyping.. it‚Äôs a complete joke. All quests in this game are jokes.. 
---
Nothing is memorable.  And the only good quests/events were nerfed to oblivion.
---
Sheepsquash is sort of fun but really short. 
---
To think I have more fun replaying fallout4
---
Ok noted!! I'll wait and see if there's any more advice but I might do that! Knock it down to a 2 and max out thru hiker. 
---
What perk do u think I should be sharing
---
Is this really a solution for them?
---
LOL
---
Imagine bitching when you can still play.
---
This is the funniest excuse for subpar content I've seen yet. People that play the game aren't the player base? What kind of logic is that? Is this the weirdest gatekeeping yet? 
---
I have played the game for hundreds of hours, sure, but I don't have an OP build, I have a "oh that's a neat perk what does that do" build. I have literally 1 weapon that I've found a Legendary on that's any good, and it's a 1* shotgun. I'm not running around with duped bloody melee stuff. 
---
 And after playing as many hours as I have, I can say that most of the lower level players I've seen in game are actually alts of 100+ level people. Nearly ever lower level I talk to says they have a high level main character, but got bored so started a new one. Occasionally I run into a genuinely low level that just got the game, but that's pretty rare.
---
hmmm..... i also have the exact same story, months of nothing besides low level chinese robots and low level ghouls ever attacked my camp near overseers camp
---
My 2nd tier heavy machine gun turrets always took care of any threats quickly, at most i had a few crops damaged
---
But recently (and i even posted a few times about this) my house was totally demolished a few times now in the past 2 weeks
---
i never received or just missed any message letting me know it was under attack each time, i came home to my CAMP leveled...
---
anyone else seem a strange uptick in CAMP destruction recently?
---
it could also be bored PVP players who didnt do so hot in survivial coming back and destroying CAMPs just to be dicks...
---
Agree, am I‚Äôm sure having multiple stock of keys which I can‚Äôt drop, and other items, slow the game down. I drop all items I can including hollo‚Äôs to try and free up space. I‚Äôd stash boxes are limited due to item quantity‚Äôs on servers, these items can‚Äôt help.
---
As a West Virginian, unless I'm under attack, if I come up on a radio playing it in game, I'll set near by for a bit and play with my Pip Boy while itself going. Gotten me killed twice now.
---
Only condition of items you p/u
---
I'm not a 200+ player. If anything sub 50 players are the sliver, not the other way around. Most people that play this game for any time at all, are going to be a higher level, that's how games that have been around for more than a month work.
---
PC does not have that as an option, they have to buy another base game.
---
&gt;two random notes released yesterday.
---
I keep seeing previous 4 notes on taxidermy and the same ones at stations. Where are those recently added? Do you have to hop server until you find them?
---
The Event Fast Travel available to everyone makes it scarier in Survival since enemy players get easy ride to your location. I liked the old claim system where that had to reach the workshop machine thingy because then I could barricade it and force them to proc bounty. Because people who attack a 'settlement' should be fugitives immediately and stay that way. 
---
The wanted system sucks too though and needs the first hit on a red player enable pvp without damaging them so both players can initiate the fight at same time. Probably better ways to handle it but that's a simple solution.
---
The attacker is also allowed to kill the workshop owner even if they don't fight back. Someone killed me before when I was in pacifist after taking a workshop just for daily. I had no interest in it further so I'd of let him have it. Although he didn't want it anyways and left, he just wanted to suckerpunch me and take off, which is when I learned that was a thing.
---
Have u not read any of my other comments? I bitch at Bethseda all the time. 
---
I know it sucks but if u really want to play there doesnt seem like any other option.
---
I love the station, but I wish it had more of selection of music, especially when you play the game for more than a few hours the loop is too short, it kind of gets repetitious. Nonetheless I love all the golden oldies.
---
You‚Äôre welcome there friend.
---
Yeah, I went back when it was empty after a while, and it was better, but I still feel the story wasn't really complete. Having all the mobs to myself, and not in power armour this time, was a little bit more harder, but honestly just one house in whitesprings is harder.
---
Because there are no perks or armor or anything at all that affect the weight of anything in the stash.  You can't stash the amounts needed to craft and repair items, and with all the perks and weight reducing armor, it makes more sense to carry a lot of necessary junk.
---
The game needs a bigger stash weight, or for junk (preferably bulk) to weigh less/nothing in stash.
---
So lots of us bring lots of scrapped junk everywhere.
---
TL;DR: because the game is broken
---
Awesome, straight in with the insults. Well played.
---
Sucks, dude. Just make another profile and start over.
---
i think once the bad player wrecked his house the bad player gets a bounty, and the Op was trying to defend his CAMP from the bad player, so then the bad player could one shot the OP and his friend
---
You're supposed to take it with a grain of salt AND not add on to it.  Bethesda promised a "challenge" and failed to deliver on that.  What they DIDN'T promise was the raid tier difficulty end game content a whole lot of people are pissed off they didn't get.
---
By making gradually increasing difficulty content, instead of content that is the same difficulty level of "50".
---
Character progression is broken.  Game difficulty is plateaued.  It's basically designed around 50, with gear, since the start, being "kill this same difficulty stuff, but faster".
---
Probably not for exactly this reason. Easier to bump up those stats then just using chems.   I see those stats on unyielding and I cry bitter tears of jealousy
---
The trailer spoiled it for me, literally shows opening the nuka cola machine
---
I was by the acid deposit south of the power plant in the middle of the map - Monangha
---
I survived a couple of melee hits with \~220 HP + T-51B + Dodgy 3 + Lone Wanderer 4 + Blocker 1 yesterday. I would guess that Troubleshooter armor also works, as I can tank normal Assaultrons with it. 
---
Died once because I was staring at the sheepthing for too long and didn't notice the pylon eating my HP.
---
And you've ignored the question I asked. What would you call the Burrows if you had to call it something so that people knew what it was?
---
I'd agree it's not very hard, but it still can be played in a group, so how are the Burrows not a dungeon?
---
I plan on having legit Easter egg hunts tbh. Rewards and all
---
I love that song, and will sing along to it. Thankfully I've use Push to Talk, lol.
---
It always surprises people when they find out Fallout has been using very modern licensed recordings from the 70s onwards since New Vegas which makes their argument fall apart or causes a lot of backpedaling.
---
NV even has songs recorded in 2003 and 2009 which ought to have caused a riot for a 2010 Fallout game.
---
https://i.redd.it/1mrqe2jdg6f21.png
---
Hell, Josh Sawyer even set the precedent for the 1970s cover of ‚ÄúCountry Roads‚Äù by covering the 90s song ‚ÄúCobwebs and Rainbows‚Äù.
---
I would had ignored that message too
---
I've read, I sure need to this! Quite excited, still bummed about the story, didn't feel very complete in my eyes
---
Another place to farm 3* ghouls apparently.
---
They are in the mire. One in a building at berkley spring where the corner of the building is blown out on top of the fireplace. The other is at Southern bell motel on a table out front.
---
Rad Sponge in nuke zones and Team Medic outside of it
---
I have a legendary Sacrificial Blade mod sitting in my stash, waiting...
---
You don't need a second person. You need a second account.
---
Yeah I'd expect you loads of fun. The gun that comes in to defend someone over someone else correcting their sense of time. You're a fucking riot I expect.
---
I went in as a Mistress of Mysteries and didn't have tooooo much trouble, but it did feel appropriate
---
Me: AHAHAHA DIE IN FIRE WHILE I ENJOY THIS INSPIRING MELODY!
---
Same here for months I got nothing more than some rabbits chickens and radstags now I‚Äôm getting mole rats every time, it‚Äôs a bit frustrating
---
Same here. I run a bloodied build so there are times I load in then die because of an explosion thay happened during the load, or loaded into a nuke zone, etc. Load times are horrendous
---
Nope, I haven't found, nor has anyone else I think found what gut shrooms are for.
---
I'm also grateful it's free, for it's lowest point, it was good, just I felt there was some wasted potential for story and lore, and maybe even new future content, but who knows maybe the burrows will be revisited again one day.
---
That's every game developer, they all have heavy hands
---
In my run I had 2x3 stars and about 5 x1 stars
---
I don't know about recently, I don't watch his channel. I saw a video recently in which he was being weird about gay stuff but it could have been old. I've heard others saying he's said negative stuff in 2018 but I haven't seen any of that myself so... big grain of salt. xD 
---
My main point was less about Oxhorn in particular though, and more about people being somehow less deserving of criticism because of their job description. I don't think the person's job should be used as a reason to distract from their attitudes-- I mean, if a janitor or store clerk who was also a public figure was saying that women are inferior to men and shouldn't have a chance at medical or political jobs because they lack the necessary critical thinking (being irrational creatures, after all!), or that men are universally aggressive and emotionally disconnected, I would call that person a bloody moron. 
---
Basically, being a douche deserves to be criticized regardless of what position you are in, IMO. It just generally affects public figures more than the rest of us.
---
That said, I'm watching the Oxhorn video now and it seems reasonably worded, plus he disavows his past actions directly. I'd give him props for growth and owning some fairly disrespectful (and factually incorrect) views that he published in the past.
---
Same here.
---
That's the feeling I get when "Wouldn't it be nice" comes on.
---
You said I wasn't the player base, that's pretty insulting. I can't imagine how anyone could have more than 20 hours in this game and not at least have some idea what's going on. If you don't, how is that my fault?
---
I placed mine in a separate sub building in the middle of a pond. Haven't ever had an issue.
---
My luck is 3.
---
 Best I can figure, drops are more dependent on player level (up to a point)
---
 \- For me, legendary drops got much better after I reached L50...or something was tweaked in patch 8 to make drops better...
---
The quantity and \* of weapons has gone up, then quantity of armor pieces has gone down, but what armor I'm getting is better.
---
OTOH, what is "better" for me @L63 is probably garbage for a L123 :)
---
I had seriously only known of this song because of memes, and had never heard it until I played this game.
---
I‚Äôm getting it too. I tried a lot of things but in the end I figured I‚Äôll just have to live with it.
---
It's a bug from patch 8 affecting all loose mods.
---
Waiting on a fix from Beth.
---
im right there with ya, going through a bad breakup and now have to sell the house we bought together, its a nightmare, and fallout lets me take my mind off of things
---
i am guilty of coming on here and using my aggression against asshole posters, i think i might need to stay off of this sub for a bit, so many apologists are getting me riled up
---
Ok gotcha! Thanks for the advice
---
One last think,
---
Should I knock the mysterious savior down one like you said, completely get rid of it, or take off marathoner one (either way making thru hiker max)
---
I thought he was saying "Suffolk "
---
Thanks God that the least I know I'm not the only one
---
Bethesda didn't plan on people duping full sets of Unyielding Sentinel gear. Go in there as a Mistress of Mysteries, that's about the power level they were expecting players to be imo. If dupping hadn't had been so rampant we would all be running around in whatever we could find
---
haha if I was the staff doing the stream, I would have banned you from the channel
---
As would I
---
Hey dude.  I am at the tail end of a similar situation. If you are on PC and would like the company of a sympathetic dad, PM me.
---
They're doing a stream about new content and you interrupt to ask when cheaters are going to be let back in? And can't figure out thy they didn't respond?
---
Let's all think about this for a moment.....
---
Well, at least the Whitespring campers will have to server hop less often.
---
I don't think it should show up on the map at all.  Yes, you could probably kill it but I expect it would travel with a pack of other mobs similar to the randomly selected boss.
---
Say what now?!
---
I was in there with 3 other players last night, about 5-10 1 stars. Go in by myself, 4 3 stars that actually dropped 3s. I like the Burrows but I know I'm in the minority
---
Not many people actually farmed for those tokens. They either bought them or duped them
---
I appreciate that, brother, but you m on PS4
---
Outaraged? No. But dissapointed - Yes, very much so. And i feel I get to be annoyed and voice my opinion whan I was promissed dungeon and got pretty much normal location...
---
It's per character not total account, I'm just short of 4k pounds now of Legendaries between my 5 characters.
---
I have heard that CHR actually affects the drop rates. Don't know how true it is, and not willing to waste points to find out.
---
I'm upvoting this post for two reasons:
---
Truth and making me laugh!!
---
"Fallout 76 - Waiting for the next update"
---
A cheater calling others scum
---
"Am I tHe  OnLY oNe!?"
---
Ha, to funny I showed my wife this post, started reading all the other comments, and all of a sudden, I hear Country Roads on the stereo in the other room! It is now viral. Lol!
---
I'm honestly more interested in your reaction than in any of Oxhorn's stances.  Your comments look like straight-up dug-in denial to me.  Maybe I"m wrong and you're right, but just so I'm honest, that's the standpoint I'm at at this moment.  I find that mindset fascinating, although infuriating when it's widespread.
---
So tell me - were Oxhorn to actually change, what would that change look like to you?  IF - IIIFFFF - he were to change, as he says he has, how would that differ from what is here?  How could you tell the difference between honest change and fake change?  You speak confidently, so I'm wondering what would be your criteria here.  Do you just not believe people change in this way?  Do you not believe Oxhorn specifically *can* change this way?  Do you believe that he can but he hasn't?
---
Maybe I'm asking too many questions, but I want to understand how you're thinking here.  How would you differentiate "Oxhorn has truly changed" versus "Oxhorn says he's changed but he hasn't"?
---
I usually assume that folk are peaceful until they attack me or my team first. So until people attack, steal or destroy my or my teammate's stuff, I leave them to it. If they attack then expect fire to be returned if it is continued. It has worked so far for me.
---
Yes, I was not clear on what I was meaning.
---
They aren't meant to be friendly. Once you go up to the aggressive death claw and interact with it to 'make friends' with it. After doing this, the next stage will pop up telling you to either (1) kill it or (2) flee from it. Rose is a little prankster, so she wants to see you get killed.
---
Your talking about prize bot.
---
A laudable troll, but I don't want to feed the trolls.
---
Username checks out
---
Had good luck this morning. My first 3 star that dropped 3 stars since the update last week really pulled through with a Junkie's pump action with limb damage and +250 damage resist while reloading. Wish it wasn't junkies but those other two are good rolls on a pump
---
Yea I know I‚Äôve done it before but I thought last time it was friendly until I clicked on it then it attacked me. I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôm a stealth base character that can‚Äôt take many hits up close
---
I know it does sound good. Just right now it just feels like we are all dressed up ready to play and just waiting for the coach to put us in the game
---
Like to know how in the hell that happened. It's a slog everytime I run it.
---
Destroying someone‚Äôs base is not greifing... notice how there are perk cards that increase dmg towards other players bases? It‚Äôs encouraged!
---
I claimed all 4 locations and repaired the five vertibot pads. I then went to a central location ie. White springs and threw a flare and only got one vertibot. It just sends the closest one and you have to wait for it similar to the Artillery
---
So if it was me, I would take off mysterious savior entirely.   If you like that perk, you can get that as a legendary mod on your armor.  With the 3 points recovered, I'd max out Thru Hiker and Marathoner just to give you a little more AP.  You could swap out Marathoner for Dodgy to give you a little more defense when you need to revive someone but since it will drain your AP, it's a toss up.  If you're not in Power Armor, you can swap Marathoner for Evasive to give you a little more defense as well.
---
Lower levels have no business getting new content IMO. I think they have plenty to do until they level up! Anyone above level 50 probably has little to nothing to do for the most part. This was an epic let down and that‚Äôs a fact. The actual sewers were pretty sweet I thought. I kept thinking I was going to stumble into the real place so I wandered around for like 45 minutes going in circles lol! Bottom line is They  could of made it so much better but literally chose NOT to give a shit. The design was great, just the lore and quest was bunk. This means these vault raids will more than likely going to be bunk as well but we will obviously have to wait and see. Maybe they just have little kids doing their tests, idk. But I feel like if you are level 30 or so the burrows might be pretty cool to do.
---
&gt; f you grew up in the 80's and early 90's homophobia was not only tolerated but activity encouraged back then as well.
---
Yep.  I grew up in the 70s and 80s, so it was even worse then.  You could dig up a ton of old comments from people my age which they would (HOPEFULLY) disavow today.
---
XD
---
Well karma says otherwise mate
---
I "bought" the egg from the Atom Shop but now can't find it in the CAMP menu.  Anyone know what non-intuitive menu I can find it under?
---
Do you accept lvl 31?
---
In all fairness man, I really AM that asshole, but it's nothing personal, you know? I just want to farm efficiently. I try to get "dead" servers where I'm the only one left on them as much as possible, but that's a lot of hopping to find a server that's that old. 
---
I run two accounts, and I have routes planned out for the spots I nuke, so when I nuke, I just leave my alt there and do the same route over and over, leaving game and rejoining my alt account to respawn everything. Having people hanging around means they will just take kills on stuff before I get to it, since things respawn in large waves whenever you reload onto the server (assuming the global respawn timer for them isn't still on cooldown).
---
Also, when the materials for stable flux were public drops (if you loot the mob before me, I wouldn't get hardened mass, glowing mass, high rad fluids, etc.), I literally didn't want people around because I was losing out on crafting materials. 
---
In general, I really dislike the whole "have to tag it for loot / exp" system. It's not immersive at all, means that instead of just killing things efficiently, like you would IRL or solo, you instead have to sit there patiently waiting for everyone else to tag the mobs, which means intentionally taking 4-5x longer to run a route. Then there's the lag issue. More than 3 people nearby and it's going to take 30 seconds to 10 minutes for the loot to actually load.
---
There's just so much discouraging group play in this game.
---
PM? Interesting, normally stuff resets in the morning.
---
Super powered weapons and a good effort by everyone involved, im uploading a video at the moment of the 1st of these 3 fights we did that night that took 2m30s to complete, ill reply again when its uploaded and im back home
---
&gt;I know how to separate good from bad just by playing the game. I don't need to be a developer to notice this. I am a hardcore gamer who wants a real end game content and this game doesn't offer it even they have promised several times in Bethesda.
---
&gt;
---
This is the biggest fallacy that gamers have:  That playing games makes you knowledgeable about designing games.  
---
Im not talking coding or texture mapping or engines or any of that:  I'm talking Game Design.  What makes a game fun?  What is fun?  Did you know there are 4 different types of fun? (if I'm honest, that's the biggest problem 76 has is trying to engage on all 4 without really excelling at any of them)
---
Hardcore gamers know what's fun for them.  And anything that isn't fun for them they are quick to dismiss.  Also, hardcores aren't a big enough audience to cater to exclusively, but they tend to be influencers so you have to get them on board at least a little bit. 
---
Bethesda is steadily working on this game and while it has not all gone great I do see a general upward trend.  I want to call them out where they fuck up but praise where they do well.  I've had hours of fun in this game and really enjoyed the exploration and story. 
---
So again, I ask, why are you hanging out on a subreddit of a game you hate? Seriously, life is short and you should go do things you enjoy. Unless complaining about games and arguing is what you enjoy,then we can keep doing this.
---
It was nice of you to send massages.
---
Why?
---
In real life they are probably the biggest pushovers alive.
---
Nah companies manage their customer‚Äôs expectations via marketing and other communication. Refusal to believe this doesn‚Äôt make it any less true.
---
I managed to get my hands on the Radstag Head, the Wolf Head (those two I think are the most common) and then I got the Yao Guai head from solving the missing hunters case and got the mounted Owlett(sc?) from the Lowe quest I think. 
---
Ran into another players camp yesterday, and that person had the Wendigo up on the wall. Hopefully we find out how to get the others in due time.
---
I‚Äôm getting it with the turf floor too
---
This is not hard people. I give up. Enjoy your new DUNGEON, we will just let gaming companies continue to trick us. Its fine. /facepalm.
---
Yea its shame we can't use them till its fixed, surprised very little talk about in reddit and never seen this hit the top 25 posts either. Hope this post gets pushed a little higher and maybe this will make them do a hot fix.
---
I have the opposite problem. I lost my family, my job, and my hygiene from playing this game non-stop since release.
---
&gt;Ok so before long that thread would be fifty pages long with no clear indication of where in the thread a given topic is, among other problems.
---
So occasionally create a new topic and "retire" the old, to keep it clean. It's pretty simple stuff, dude.
---
&gt;If you've already read a topic and don't want to read a new thread about it, don't click it. 
---
The issue isn't that I don't want to read it. The issue is that the front page of the subreddit gets flooded with 50 posts about the same thing, pushing out other topics and making it completely pointless to visit the subreddit because you just see 50 posts saying the same thing.
---
This was always going to be my make or break moment. If they don't implement some sort of matchmaking, I'm tapping out.  Love the game, but it needs more of the matchmaking features that ESO has. I'm not wasting time in group finders when they could just include this as a convenience for players.
---
The per hour production and storage caps are an absurd system.  In some cases you need to pop over to your camp every 30 minutes or less to max production.  I‚Äôm guessing it was to lower free cap potential, but honestly anyone that tries can max out their caps each day.  Chalk this up to an ignored plea for a fix from the masses.  It‚Äôs a pretty common tale.

Floor decor, because, it's a decor item tha can be placed on floor-like surfaces?
---
I was hoping it was going to be World War Z like with hundreds of ghouls, insects and rad rats? It was sort of a breeze  it took about 10 minutes. There were other high level players in different phases running through. There was one guy who showed up after I killed the boss going ??? lol I'm like dood u gotta start over ;) one guy waited - followed until I was done turning the valve and opening the door, he shot through the door before me..
---
I get the frustration, mind you it kept me on my toes at every corner with elements of the unkowen. It definitely wasn't what I expected, but I enjoyed the new content nonetheless.
---
It's more people see what could have been if game Devs fucking cared. We're upset because they didn't do what they could have with the premise of the game. That's not a bad thing, but I hope that in the future they make a great online game taking all of the negative feedback on board
---
The time is mentioned in the blog post.
---
Sorry he hurt me in a bad place :)
---
I remember that feeling.  Just killed one from stealth with the Fixer.  It ended up on top of me, still unaware of where I was.  Keep killing em mate, and good luck
---
A lone level 30 with a few dozen stimpacks and a few radaway would be fine unless they are just god awful. Next.
---
*Should* be fine. There is potential for games released close to that date to have issues. But Sony is basically saying that games released after that date should've had adequate time to adapt before release, and Sony isn't accepting responsibility for other publishers' failure to do so.
---
Where did u find it?
---
He fights dirty I bet.
---
Did I say it was bad? Stop assuming things man. I‚Äôm just pointing out that that little amount of time they‚Äôre talking about is literally over a whole week of their entire life
---
If you want to look at what they said and ignore the vast difference in what they call challenging and what would actually be challenging for a naked weaponless level 20 then I guess we can‚Äôt debate
---
I don't remember the locations, but Bethesda specifically places mannequins in positions to scare the shit out of you sometimes.
---
I challenge you to go down there with only a ghoul slayers gamma gun, no armor.
---
They are very few games I think that are better alone, I like my own time sometimes but people add so much to the experience
---
100% true
---
Ah well didn't make it to that area but oh well.
---
Eh, after watching the video in full I feel like there are two choices: Believe the man or don't. 
---
I know I've personally done and said some really shitty things when I was younger, teenage years especially but I also had some erroneous beliefs in my 20s. Hell, most people I know today are much better human beings than they were 20 years ago, and much of society \*has\* changed a lot in the 2Ks, especially the last decade.
---
So all considered, what's the case with Oxhorn... did he change as so many of us do, or is he releasing a huge lie that contradicts his own faith just to protect ad revenue that frankly didn't seem threatened in the first place?
---
I'm gonna take the less cynical road on this one and say that I'll take him at his word. Words got him into this mess so I see no reason why words can't get him out.
---
I have seen that in Germany the egs are one day later available but thank you
---
The second one.
---
Should the "typing..." animation be random sign language?
---
Agreed it's just fodder but still, gives us another option vs whitesprings
---
\*twatwaffling intensifies\*
---
Yes, ruins the fung shui of a well built establishment. ;)
---
It takes a long time, for awhile the quests were broken and as long as you didn't talk to the boss it would restart them on server hop. I think they fixed this sadly.
---
Maybe you just didn‚Äôt read anything they were saying about it but they pretended like this was some awesome high level end game repeatable linear dungeon with a hard boss for the finish. It was just bad communication.
---

Make sure you're reporting it to BSG directly as well. The bug reports are almost certainly automated, so every one we submit should end up as a ticket for their dev team. At least, having spent a decade in software development, that's how I would expect it to shake out... YMMV
---
Listen to the holotape on the corpse right by the entrance ladder
---
It's a lie
---
I have to think Bethesda has access to a bunch of data around who does the burrows, what level, how long it took and if you went back in etc.  
---
This was a first attempt and I think they'll use it to learn.  5 years from now will you still be thinking about how the first "dungeon" they added was not what you expected/wanted?  
---
It keeps getting better, relax, go collect some steel or something till the next thing drops, it's not that far away.
---
Ha, Ha, to funny, the new White Springs experience. Sounds interesting, I will have to go and blow her up!
---
Last night I was doing my first blind run through the Poseidon Power Plant doing the powering up event and because I don't have hacking and I was doing it solo it took me almost the full hour to complete the event. I was so afraid at the end that the load times were going to keep me from getting back to startup terminal I'm not sure if loading screens affect the even timer but I was freaking out because they were taking so long. I finished the event with 1 minute and 14 seconds left but I bet I spent 6 or 7 minutes loading in and out of the building and that's with high speed internet.
---
They want all the legit gear on the profile, no doubt. /s
---
You keep coming back to the word dungeon as if they didn‚Äôt say all these other things that were what lead people into believing it would be more than just another small location.
---
This was definitely a part of the game that was withheld so it could look like new content later on. Notice how they didn't even need a patch for this, it was already in the game
---
oh my god... I'm so sick of seeing this post EVERY SINGLE PATCH. It has not gone up. You're imagining things. If it had actually gone up every time I have seen a speculation post here (which is after EVERY SINGLE PATCH) then it would never fill. It would just drain immidiately after eating/drinking. 
---
Please stop with this nonsense. It hasn't gone up. It's not bugged. It's remained relitivly the same since launch. It'll go up if you get marsupial.
---
no what I'm asking for is a dungeon that's challenging for really high level characters. Diablo has no problem with it, Borderlands has no problem with it. what makes fallout 76 any different
---
There was a few leaked bar themed items (nukashine PA skin, bar) so perhaps this is part of an upcoming bundle.  A bundle I hope lands after a few lame bundles so I can stock up on free atoms.
---
Pretty sure the Silva Homestead SW of Flatwoods has all 4 crops. Gourds are up a hill on above the farmhouse near carrots.
---
Blackberries also have a cobbler recipe, but I've only seen 1 for melons.
---
The Malpractice pistol is decent, as far as pistols go. Certainly not for the healing aspect though but for the VATS stuff.
---
So you agree with what I‚Äôm saying?...
---
This two handed battle axe weighs as much as this pistol. Hmm.
---
They've got things like the atom bomb... So I think I'll stay where I "omb"
---
What are the stats of this mutation? Ghost skin?
---
Junk jet isn't in 76 yet is it?
---
I think is really bad customer service that a game that has a part of it that promotes camp design ( remember that tutorial in vault 76 when we were all newbies?) and has no protective game dynamic to prevent grade a asswipes from trashing camps as described. I've given up on building a camp now as Bethesda have done NOTHING to prevent idiots from doing this.
---
"Almost heaven, playing Fallout, got my controller as I fast travel to Watoga" :)
---
There's apparently plans for some kind of Presidential election associated with the bunker, where you apparently run around the map to all the polling stations scattered around the map. And the President gets access to more of the bunker and unique power armor
---
There are several gourds in Raleigh clays bunker In the mire and one in the greenhouse behind hornright summer villa
---
I'm aware of the goal of the quest. I must have missed the bit of the tunnel building, I'm planning to do a third revisit (also planning to do a more revised post on this topic with I constructive criticism, and how with minimal effort this place can be better, so far it's going well with nuking XD).
---
The PA in the burrows is randomly generated, when I went it was a two pieces of T-45.
---
And one thing I have a problem is just the lack of BoS, yeah there's about two BoS corpses in the whole Sewer system, yet it doesn't show any actual struggle the BoS team faced(Also planning to check every nook and cranny in the water. I know there's a turret here or there, but that is most likely left from the Burrows inhabitants, BoS weren't there to secure it, just scout out the area.
---
The key is used to get into one of the sectors of the Burrows I believe, but with the whole rush of all the players swarming the Burrows, that door was left constantly open.
---
Now there is a sewer grill which behind shows a valve and some containers, but no ones found a way to get there as of yet. It could be for future content, and I do hope they revisit the burrows, I love the look and feel to the place.
---
The main problem I have is that for it's story it's not fleshed out. Yes you can ask all those questions, but in this scenario it doesn't feel right. I mean I didn't even find any tapes/notes of how they first came to be there, only the struggles. I'm aware that the inhabitants went there for shelter after the bombs dropped, but that's told in The inside the vault, not in game, I feel it should have also been mentioned in-game.
---
I don't want the lore to take you by holding your hand, but it just felt that some bits are missing, yes we may find more clues about what happened to BoS in the burrows in a later content drop, but at least it should have shown a struggle in their, like the struggle in the glassed caverns, you stumble across a scene were you find BoS members that all died in actions, this should have also been the case here aswell, give some more environmental story telling.
---
The robots at the end and it's whole just ending to the quest? Well I guess that can be expected as the weird signal, but question is what emitted it? A lot of the bots were still in there construction pods (For me they all burst out of it), and for a fact I know a normal water pump won't emit much signal except for energy readings about the place. It may have just been a signal from all the bots communicating to each other if they weren't all in their pods, I would have let that slide and excepted it, but it just doesn't feel totally right to me.
---
I mean all in all, I enjoyed exploring the burrows and seeing how they lived in that maze of the place, but I also feel that Bethesda may have overhyped it, because I (and many others) were expecting a struggle, like a real need of survival, but it was something else, and some got angry, and for me i was confused, because I checked all over the place for more stuff to do, and with the all the passages and nooks and cranny, I didn't know if I missed notes/holotapes or not.
---
If I do repeat stuff that you said or I don't make much sense, sorry bit fazed after a recent appointment, but yeah that's what I guess I feel about it. I'll most likely make a post later on how Bethesda can really hit the hammer in the head, and maybe also introduce new ways for players to start quests, such as maybe one day you pick up a radio signal (basically how some of the DLC in other Fallout games would begin with, a radio signal or sometimes just upon opening the game)
---
CIVILIZATION!!! I STAY RIGHT HEREEEEEEEEE
---
I got intestines for the first time last week when I played (300 hours in) thought it was something new. They came from a squirrel or beaver I believe. Dunno if anything else drops them too?
---
I didn't really think so, but it's a dumb enough idea to make me wonder.
---
Can the challenges be dynamically updated server-side?  If not, can you ask the devs to work on that?
---
The time zone difference probably doesn't help things either.
---
When I said I did it in 10 minutes, I mean I explored every tunnel I came across, and looted nearly 100 plastic, 70ish lead and a bunch of steel. I didn't just "run to the end", I was actually taking my time with it, and beat it accidentally because I didn't realize that was the "end". There might be additional tunnels I missed, but I didn't see any. 
---
I do plan on going through it a few times, and I'm glad it is a new area in the Mire, as I quite like the Mire.
---
Yeah, hopefully I can do a couple more thorough, picked to the bone run through before my sever drops a atom bomb on it XD
---
Sometimes my unyielding stacks twice and I have a 30 boost in each stat. Very rare but it has happened to me and when it does it's always amazing
---
Buddy of mine lost 5 3* legendaries to a server crash doing this.
---
Ill get you a full suit Xo1 with blackbird paint, red headlamp, calibrated shocks, emergency protocols, yours for 25k
---
It was never supposed to be a raid, it was supposed to be a dungeon. But to be fair it's not even that lol.
---
Pick one weapon
---
Ad Victorium
---
This is their inside joke.  Should be taken as one and not seriously.
---
Im trying to find a black suit so I can roleplay a "Men in black" style character and walk around questioning people and searching for Cryptids
---
What do you mean?
---
I get it.  I just try to give randos a chance because why not?  If they're selfish, I can play that game.  If they're cool, it tends to become a little party as more people join in.  My T-51 guy with tesla coiled torso can tank all day in Whitespring, so it just saves me repair on my weapon when I don't have to hit anything, and everyone else can shoot without any danger.
---
I mean, I pretty much am only farming legendaries to get that god-roll specific thing to put a cherry on top of items like 2-star AA/E lever and handmade rifles for my sniper.  My melee already has his AA/SS/STR super sledge.
---
I feel what you're saying about server lag and whatnot, but the game will be here tomorrow and the next day to do the exact same thing.  It's not like I have until the end of the week to get my legendaries and then they're gone forever.  If it takes me an extra 5 minutes to run around Whitespring for the 1000th time while helping someone else get some starter gear, that's great.  99% of the time I just dump a huge bag of whatever rando lootgen for them anyways.  God-rolls are rare, and that's all I'm after.
---
The gospel
---
I'll have to scrap some teddies so I can repair it's ear.
---
Semi automatic rifles vs shotguns are very different builds.
---
True thats a good idea and wish I thought of it sooner. Will be doing that now.
---
You would be destroyed in marketing lmao. You need to understand how your playerbase will view your words. ITV articles aren‚Äôt read by the casuals. They wrote those up like this was a tough, end game dungeon crawl. It isn‚Äôt. Point blank. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad. I‚Äôm saying they failed to effectively communicate what they were releasing when speaking to a ravenous group of hardcore players.
---
Which mounted head plan is in Berkley Springs?
---
Nope, I'll actually take a seat next to the radio at the train station and sing along when Mister Sandman and Country Road comes on.
---
Literally not one person.
---
I have it as my ringtone. Gets sick in EVERYONE'S head EVERY time.

Brain no work good

The lighthouse event is great for insects
---
So you need to head to the mire and go to something belle motel, then on the furthest left table of boomer is a note well camouflaged ontop the table, read it and the quest should begin!
---
Get this clown outta here.
---
But that's what they are.
---
It's half updating existing players about what's going on, and half about enticing non-players to start.
---
newest quest?

Messages, I would ignore too.

Massages, however....

It's almost as if endgame content shouldn't be possible to solo by everyone.
---
You can't give people items painted with Atom Store paints.
---
I've seen players selling spare Quantium paintjob plans, never been able to get a second to spawn myself though, unless I did it again on an alt!
---
I haven't played the new burrows yet, but if it is what is being claimed here, then Bethesda *does* need a wake up call. There is a million low level things to do, they need to be aspiring for end game content. They need to be focusing purely on end game content, because eventually those low levels will be high level. I've done the scorched beast queen like 6 times, And it's already boring. I've done the imposter sheepsquatch like 10 times, and it's already boring. The new quest was short lived new content, but fun sure.
---
They need to look at absolutely any example of a successful MMORPG, and release content that will keep high level players engaged for longer. They need to focus on communication tools in -game. Right now there is zero incentive for me to ever talk to another player, and without a microphone, zero method. What happens when real "dungeons" are released? How do you organize 20 players through mic chat alone.
---
I have over 500 stims. I'm more than happy to be a pylon
---
Each weapon has specific perk cards and a few that reduce weights (except rifles...cause reasons). It would be better for you to focus one of those for main damage and have a backup (either go main: shotgun, backup melee, or main melee, backup ranged). Power armor will need some dips across the board, but without having to use normal armor cards it should even out.
---
i wish duping never happened as well!  Unfortunately it did happen.... and Bethesda has to take that into account as well, since they were the ones who had loose code that allowed glitches to get into the developers room and exploit in game holes to dupe.. Yes, people were shits who did that, but it was only because they COULD do that, and the bad code was what let them
---
dont get me wrong im not defending dupers at all, they ruined the in game economy and im still salty at all of them
---
but im using min/maxxed perks that are in game, and using only found weapons, and i still feel totally OP...how is that my fault?  Im only using what Bethesda put into the game for us
---
leaving out duped weapons entirely, it still seems Bethesda needs to create true end game content with better AI enemies, new mechanics, new enemies etc etc- heres hoping the upcoming raids are better...
---
bullet sponge enemies or just more enemies is not real end game content, Bungie learned that the hard way with Valud Tauric aka Bullet MCSpongeface
---
 14 strength, 9 perception, 4-6 endurance, 1-3 charisma intelligence 10-15, luck leftovers after that. Thats optimal imo.
---
*goes to lobby to buy more popcorn*
---
I did exactly this earlier in the morning was so worth it. What was also good was that 2 other people had the idea and after my nuke landed 2 more came in and covered the area
---
False. It's the difference between 2 and 20 minutes SBQ fights.
---
I was never able to get the terminal to work. Just keep storing and placing the keypad until you get a code you like.  
---
You have a 1 in 9999 chance of getting just the right code!
---
You simply plug it into your phones headphone jack and select the FM radio station you‚Äôd like to broadcast to. Then you tune the radio to the same station and bingo! It‚Äôs a bit finicky (all transmitters like this tend to be), but I didn‚Äôt have to modify anything and it works well enough for my purposes.
---
I don't understand why people who are conduits don't do this. I do this every time a conduit, just sit on the roof realtivly safe, stiming myself and sniping bots.
---
Yeah, I rely on dailies for most of my points so this is really bumming me out.
---
Was just about to comment this!
---
Ah thanks for the help! It wasn‚Äôt this one though.
---
Ok I'll probably just remove it! I'll max out thru hiker for sure, so I should max out marathoner and just forget field surgeon (stimpacks and radaways work faster) ?
---
I have assassins sentinel and get two/three shot killed all the time. OP weapons stagger you and kill you easily. Same with assigns cavalier armor
---
That's my take on it too.  A man can only admit when he's done wrong and try to do better next time.  If we don't allow them that, what good are we?
---
Just remove PvP from adventure mode already.  Lame Bethesda is lame.
---
I'll take a look. Thanks
---
Yeah I read about that as well.
---
TBH, I think the game has plenty of potential for content. Just a matter of developers being paid enough and them coming up with a good compromise to monetize and keep the servers for the game running.
---
Indeed they are the same artist! Like I said, you gotta love Kay Kyser!
---
Of the two released notes from yesterday, you get the mounted wendigo.
---
Still can't hear him while right next to him, he's louder upstairs!
---
No worries...I thought the post was a little old
---
Purified water weighs exceedingly little and sells for 4 caps each. If you have 10 water purifiers at a CAMP you can pull 50 purified water every so often, giving you 200 caps instantly. In an average playthrough I generate 500-600 caps just from water alone, without having to life a finger.
---
I mean, there could be a balance between one enemy that kills anyone in the game in one hit, and 20 enemies that are basically pushovers for anyone who knows how to make a proper build.
---
Not enough words in caps to emphasize your passion for the game. So, you only get ONE updoot.
---
Thanks I'll look into it
---
If you ever played New Vegas you know there scientist vetting process isn't that impressive either.
---
Oh how I wish we could add songs and not just replace...I wouldn't abuse it by putting my shitty regular music on it either, just a bunch of 50s stuff. :-)
---
I know people use Spotify and play that in the background, but it just isn't the same.  I would legit pay full price for a "radio" expansion pack with more tunes!  Licensing is an issue but I'm sure something could be worked out...
---
TAKE ME HOME
---
As of today, it's up to 82.  A positive sign that it's gone up in 2 months, but not the greatest sign as all those open positions haven't been filled yet.
---
Well it‚Äôs certainly odd they intersperse bits that would entice said players into playing again with the bits that would mainly be appreciated by active players in a lengthy text dump. Also interesting that they seem to try to entice them by running actual ads across the internet but use their one platform to talk specifically to the whole of the active playerbase to exaggerate the impressiveness of new content ü§î
---
So because Duping used to be rampant people without that duped gear should be shut off from the content? You have to realize that they want to keep the burrows accessible to new players/players who didn't go out of their way to acquire duped goods
---
I can agree. I still love the game, and I know how much potential it still has, but it does seem like Bethesda just keeps missing big opportunities to make this game as great as it should be.
---
If I can offer some advice. Farm trash weapons from the mine that Uranium Fever happens at. Server hop a few times til you can't walk fast. Then shamble over to Whitespring Station and sell the weapons for 1400 caps. Repeat every day.
---
Then use Reddit to buy a nice gun for caps.
---
System?
---
Oh...and I forgot that one dude that was lvl 24 and helpless a couple months ago, accepted his friend request and he actually sought me out once he was lvl 150 and powerful like a month later to give me [this monster](https://imgur.com/0qijS48) as thanks for helping him level for a couple hours.  Fucking mindblowing.
---
Just wanted to add the urban operative under armor does this to several outfits and it is very annoying.

Honestly, I‚Äôd settle for a ‚ÄúSelf Radio‚Äù type thing like GTA V has. Something that lets me add my own music in game. Like you said, Classic 50‚Äôs jazz and big bands all the way!

New eggs will be released at 8pm EDT.
---
Hey! As a dad that went through the same thing, keep trying to visit your daughter. It makes a big difference in the custody process. 
---
Theylle ask you how often you attempted to see your daughter and use it against you if you went a week without trying to make contact.
---
Anyways, I hope things work out!
---
That underwater valge has a corresponding valve above water, on the other side of a wall. It's just loot. The valve inside the loot area is an exit.

do you do this often? im always down for fissure site runs

Very interested! Sent you a DM!
---
I got the wendigo one from Haven Church (but it starts out at that motel).  Didn‚Äôt see anything Berkley Springs, though.
---
Small animals drop them since the fashnact event. Squirrels, chickens, bevers. Havent found any on a fox yet tho.
---
Launched a nuke?  Shit I'm level 13 and I ain't even worn power armor yet.  Everyone has to remember: people on reddit are in the minority of people who play this game.  There's nothing **wrong** of course with being a fanatic who has already blown through the content, but...
---
In another thread some guy was arguing that he's a "true fanboy" and they should thus be catering to him.  :rolleyes:
---
Point number one, not griefing. You were attacked in a manner that is perfectly legal and allowed in the game. You were too weak to defend yourself. Now you want Bethesda to take action against them? You can leave the server aka the coward's way out. It is always an option, so don't pretend you were griefed when you were simply attacked inside of a game whose nature dictates that.
---
Maybe you need to ask yourself, how can I better respond to the situation? Instead of crying to daddy Bethesda that little Timmy stomped your sand castle, maybe stomp his. Maybe leave if you aren't able to defend your property. Again, you had/have options. 
---
Griefing is where a player, in bad faith, harasses and trolls. It's also defined as using mechanics and exploits that ARE NOT INTENDED to do so. Camps are meant to be destructible by enemies in the game. Players can be enemies if they want to be. End of story.
---
This!
---
You are stuck with the code it gives you. To exit you have to put down a pressure pad to open the door. That's how I got mine to work.
---
Do I try to clean out the bunker? Not for like a week. Spent so much ammo trying clean it out needed to take a break to get scraps and make more
---
True that one is just a misc quest doesn‚Äôt give a plan. Sorry
---
Thabk you for the advice. The wife allows me to talk to her for 30 mins a day at exactly 5 PM. I call every day. Hopefully my lawyer comes through before she successfully alienates me entirely.
---
Yeah same thing basically happened to me. Also I've noticed an uptick in a attacks from Mongrels and mole rats, and the mothman has spawned more than once.  Maybe my neighborhood is just going to hell lol,
---
Yup yup!  I'm glad the fanatics who have already blown through the content enjoy the game, but they have to remember they are in the minority.
---
Lever and it comes with a suppressor
---
Why not go to the build maker and plan it out? Stop being lazy. Also no I'm not going to link the build maker, that's what Google is for.
---
He could demonetize all his videos for starters. If its not just a career move, then he shouldnt need it to be career orientated. Its not as if the "content" he is creating is benefiting anyone except himself and the advertisers.
---
Exactly. Griefing is literally defined as exploiting or using unintended mechanics to harass others. OP is just a cry baby.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say, none
---
Deep tissue kneading over TCP/IP. Harder than it might sound.
---
Of course they failed, they only sent two people
---
Sound dissipates over horizontal distance ONLY with this game engine.  Vertical distance has absolutely no bearing on the volume of something in this game so an enemy (or a magazine/cap stash/bobblehead if you have those perks) will be at 100% volume in a 10 story building if you're standing directly beneath him on floor 1 while he's on floor 10.
---
It's crap.
---
Why do you play a game like this if you don‚Äôt enjoy the process of making your own character?
---
I think most people just use it as an hours played counter.
---
Make it yourself, post it here, ask for feedback, change accordingly.
---
There‚Äôs your build.
---
Also OP was using "Power armor" lmao. Whenever I see a metal suit walking around in survival, I KNOW its an easy kill for me.
---
I wasn't arguing, I said it was interesting?
---
So the new one hasn't been added to the shop yet? I got the one that came out yesterday, just waiting on the others
---
You're not trying to come off as mean, ungrateful, ill-tempered hatemongers, but you come off that way because you're extremely selfish and think all new content should be catered to your extreme end-game needs.
---
Mystery Meat PIE, yet its in a can..................,
---
Calm down mate, I‚Äôm terrible at making builds and I have been on that website already and have tried to make a build already, I tried using it but it was just not powerful enough
---
&gt; Bethesda didn't plan on people duping full sets of Unyielding Sentinel gear.
---
Have never dupped, can still easily run through this dungeon without breaking a sweat or stimpack with everything I have found in my 100+ hours of gameplay :/
---
This sounds like a real Easter egg hunt.
---
'Refusal to believe this doesn't make it any less true'
---
lol you know you're backed in a corner when you need to insist on the reality of something as if that insistence alone is some kind of evidenced or well-reasoned point. xD 
---
What businesses do is pitch. That's their job when they market something, they pitch it. We, as adults, are the ones who respond to the pitch, and we're the ones who manage our expectations, because no business short of employing mind-control can possibly do that for us. So if an individual or business pitches something and you eat it up without managing your expectations, that's your fault. 
---
You sound like the type of person who goes to Disneyland, doesn't enjoy their time there, and then blames Disney for suggesting in their commercials that it's a magical wonderland full of fun. xD
---
You're saying low quality posts don't exist objectively? 
---
Drowning out substantive information and discourse is a form of silencing, which is part of what the OP and I are criticizing. You don't make a strong case for your utopia where the mods are golden gods, the rules are perfectly benevolent and abided, and everyone's 'shit' judgement gets equal status. Sound like more shouting into the void to me.
---
Entire community?  You think a large portion of the people playing Fallout76 are a) on this subreddit and b) done with the game, bored, and need end-game content?
---
Ironically, I started with placing the first one hidden in my CAMP, and will keep doing that with the rest.
---
I  guess.  I guess my point is that this dungeon feels roughly mid- level, something that could be a challenge for a level 30-40 character with non-legendary weapons and excavator power armor who  is  nowhere close to being God-like or OP.
---
Well no, sometimes there ARE stealth nerfs.  It happens.  But with any MMO, it happens.
---
Thanks so much for the advice this worked very well last evening.  The small group we had finished with just seconds to spare but we did it.  Question: for those whom have felt the wrath of the cryolator, is there anything to get rid of the freeze effect.  As a melee character I was quickly frosted up and had the -30% movement rate from bashing her in the face with my axe.  Is there a way to remove the debuff it lasted an extremely long time.
---
Good to know! Thanks for the info.
---
Nice, thanks for that info. +karma
---
It was a reward for finishing the quest you get at Toxic Larry‚Äôs on the edge of the Savage Divide west of Berkeley.
---
did you even take the time to read what i wrote? are you jsut trying to be obtuse and argue? 
---
and not everyone has duped gear, you seem to be equating anyone who is higher level than you or has more powerful gear than you that they are a duper
---
truth is, its entirely easy to level up and get powerful gear without duping, im sure the vast majority of players are not dupers, besides, didnt Bethesda ban most of them anyway?
---
you missed the whole point of my post, its that even WITHOUT any duped gear, players can be very Op with just the tools/cards Bethesda gave us, im a prime example, im nearing lvl 45 and i can already 1 shot almost every enemy in the game just using regular perk cards and found weapons- i have no sentinal gear, i dont play as a bloodied character, just a regular casual player who needs more end game content
---
but im sure you will argue with that too
---
My family might hit the country road if I sing along to that song one more time. I love it.
---
Yeah except that in this case, people started thinking that it meant stealth has been nerfed, as in, sneaking had been made less effective.
---
I am referring to the people that build right behind the Golf club building with the turrets pointing at the door in order to farm XP not people whom have camps on or by the golf course.
---
Resets same time as the daily Biv quest, interesting.
---
Right. They dropped a lot during fastgrab but since then not as much.
---
I just put in on my front porch.
---
And barring that, 25k is a scam for that.
---
You I thought of that.
---
did you not?
---
Yeah I read it but I don't really agree with it. Still gave you an upvote. You can one-shot a super mutant?
---
Yeah I was just mentioning that as well. It was odd so I just restated my source in case you may have missed it.
---
Its really not that i dont like it. Its just I think it couldve been done better. I still run it daily, mostly for the xp though. 
---
Pretty high xp output in relation to ammo input. Just voicing my opinion on 3* enemies still dropping 1 star gear(a majority of the time ime)
---
Yeah the whole thing is a scam.
---
I think he meant the key in the secret room, not the paintjob itself
---
No problem. If you have any other power armor questions give me a shout, combination of mods, whatever it be I've most likely tried it. I've switched my build a few times in 76 with the same character so I had to experiment with different combinations of things to get the strongest build possible.
---
Yeah this felt way more like a misc quest than a side quest.
---
Had same thing happen when I tried to mod excavator armor.
---
Do the fireflys count? I know logically they should...
---
I use an explosive double barrel and have high int and luck for vats/crit
---
Nah I sound like the kind of person with years of experience managing customer expectations via communications and marketing. I have first hand experience with something you claim is wholly on the customer and it‚Äôs patently false. 
---
Obviously if a customer is *delusional* and has it in their head that McDonald‚Äôs is a fine dining experience with nothing suggesting that to be true, for example, then that‚Äôs on them.  However, if McDonald‚Äôs ran an ad campaign implying that a fine dining experience is what the customers will experience, using terms that have a specific definition in that domain, and then don‚Äôt deliver...well expect there to be disappointed customers speaking out because their expectations weren‚Äôt properly managed.
---
Marketing and customer relations is a hell of a lot more complex than ‚Äúmake a pitch‚Äù.
---
Is there a way to do this in a PA build? Does stats from armor work when I'm using PA?
---
Not me not me not me
---
If you're on Xbox I'll hook you up with a set for a decent price. I'll take like caps and trade or just trade if the item or items is/are good enough. If you want X01 I can give you a Nuka Cola Quantum paint job.
---
I've never played The Last of Us, so I was more reminded of the sewers under Concord in Fallout 4. Both came after The Last of Us though, so you may well be right.
---
They make it seem like it will have NPCs almost. Let's hope it doesn't have NPCs. At least until they fix the interaction system
---
'low quality' is a value judgement. There is no objectivity involved in making this kind of value judgement. What you think is low quality could be high quality to the next person. This is a typical saying, bordering on 'common sense'. 
---
We're discussing opinions about a form of entertainment, not mathematical equations. If some of those opinions or the topics they're based on become popular they will be repeated. That's life in a discussion forum. I don't know what else you expect as this is also a form of 'common sense'.
---
How about you answer the fucking question. Nobody is reading this far down, this is just our fucking discussion now, so how you stop pandering to the masses that aren't here and answer the goddamn question. Or just say you don't know. Also it's not a DUNGEON, it's just another dungeon. You are putting way too much stock into word choice here. if it shouldn't be called a dungeon because you can't handle it being different than what other games call DUNGEONS, then what should it fucking be called? If you can give me one good term to call it, that a reasonable human being would realistically use to convey what this location is in marketing for this video game, then I will be happy to concede that they should have used it.
---
I did breach and clear for the first time last week and was blown away by how much resources i got lol I just kept opening the doors and more ore and other junk was there, really good event
---
Seeing the robot build station in the lying Lowe quest kind of confirmed we'd be getting customizable robots at some point for me.
---
Near Solomons Pond. I got around 70 ore there with my excavator.
---
Yea my dad did the same survey because he knows Todd personally. I have no proof but I do not care what you guys think! BTW the next fallout game is set in Gotham city.
---
 Play your own game. That's what I do. ;)
---
i respect your opinion as well, and using instigating weapons I was able to clear out whitesprings solo at lvl 15 on- they really are the best way to level if you use sneak skills! just dont get mobbed or its lights out! :)
---
i apologize if i get touchy, it seems my blood pressure continuously rises as i read posts here recently, its like everyone want to argue!!
---
we are all fans of the game and of the franchise, its unfortunate so many of cant seem to get along when we all share a common interest
---
maybe i need to just stop commenting here for a while and return to good ol filthy casuals (which is till consider myself) until things calm down here
---
did you rename any of the PA or the PA chassis? I renamed my chassis.
---
Fully understand that. "Better inventory" also seems mandatory once you use it for the first time.
---
Im the kinda guy who likes to roam arounnnd
---
Don‚Äôt use PA. There are a lot of perks that give you DR or mitigate getting hit while not in PA. Plus the unyielding armor gives you a crazy amount of special. I like sneak and evasive in agility. They hardly even notice me.
---
Oh wow, I'm really sorry to hear that. That's scummy.
---
Why isn't he building terminals and writing us lore?
---
Just finished it, solo level 80. It wasn't bad, liked the layout and the design but I would've liked to have more info about the robot facility there &amp; more enemy types...and I only got 1 legendary item and it was a crappy 1 star mutant slayer's pitchfork, that was the real bummer.
---
AFAIK luck only impacts condition of the item. I'm running 12 luck with mutations and armor and some drops I get are repaired to 120-130% when they fall in my grubby hands.
---
Id love it simple. Simple as mutation: hideous - the world hates you.
---
True. Just got sentimental assassins yesterday. Now I'm relevant in pvp again. They still killed me 4 times by staggering me with 50 cals during the skirmish. They were salty it was 4 on 1 and they got wrecked by a shotgun from up to 50 meters away. The guy had same armor but I kept headshoting him.
---
I'm fine with that. The imposter sheepsquatch is only hard when there's no coordination, the burrows is easy almost regardless of your build (my perk cards are all over the place). I'd happily welcome a challenge that requires teamwork and good gear in an instanced setting.
---
I think it will be this. It was datamined and doesn't seem to be listed within the items for sale in the week, written in the "inside the vault"
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/OPRWcUX
---
Plenty of non-power armors that go down just as easily.
---
Well....I hand even thought of that...., but now I will **crashing noises** *"fuck!? Wheres is the foil"* 
---
Well I will after a trip to the store
---
Pretty sure the special reward will be this. It was datamined and doesn't seem to be listed within the items for sale in the week, written in the "inside the vault"
---
It has 2 uses. One means that it is seperated from the main world and must be zoned into. The other is that the speific area is private to a player or group.
---
I buy as well, and use earnt ones as a discount system lol
---
Actually just got an autostim sentinel piece from sheepsquatch yesterday.
---
I only got one chance so far to run through it, but I'm hoping I'll have better luck this weekend with gear.
---
Companies like this like to REWARD people who play constantly, not sit and bend their will for those who play occasionally.  They put this out so people who play daily get something for their dedication!  I wish they would aim more for the dedicated long term people then the noobs. The new dungeon shows this completely!  Can beast it by myself in five minutes.  That's aimed towards new and weak players.  And if you can't get on every day, and are on console, give a good buddy your info and have them log in for you.  It's really not that complicated.  If you can't do it find someone who will for you, spouse, friend, parent, etc.  Sorry this sucks for you, not everything can be for everyone man.  Daily players deserve more then casual players, period.
---
As far as I know, it does not. though PA does give you extra strength which affects carry weight and The Excavator Armor is geared towards extra carry weight too.
---
I'll wait and see, but good info for those who want to know now!
---
yeah, i found out recently i secretly dont respect anyone in PA anymore
---
I never got into PA as it was so loud and clunky, i liked being sneaky, but my teammate NEVER takes hers off, so much that its weird to see her OUT of her PA :)
---
But moooooom i don't wanna waaaaalk
---
As a n unofficial representative of a Communist Government that you may never know, I think you should ABSOLUTELY keep your base within the safe confines of Harpers Ferry. You will see it our way soon enough. There is a reason everything in the blast zone is marked.... RED.
---
Does deleting the save also delete your pictures you took in game?  I was having issues before and had to do this.  When I did, I lost the pictures.  I'm not having stutter and framerate issues and I might have to do it again.
---
Unless you really just gotta have it I'd probably move 3pts out of INT to something continuously applicable unless your weapon breakage is that much of a challenge.
---
Gunsmith is a swappable card when needed for crafting. Materials for repairing things like rifles are easy to come by (Weapon Artisan makes it even easier/less often and also swappable) so it is hard to justify having it full time. You can use the points more actively on Perception for the weapon, strength for Blocker, or some such.
---
Radsponge is a low impact/low need use of CHR 3 points, maybe move it to Agility and use Evasive
---
Also, if you are good about food/water Rejuvenated is probably better than Lifegiver. Your stims are super effective with First Aid so I am not sure the 30pts is worth the cost.
---
Lastly, long term consider Chemist if you haven't ‚Ä¶¬†crafting diluted stims with SuperDuper is the bees knees.
---
No, that would've at least made sense. It's an ad for "wild Appalachia", a free update, that I clearly already know about, since I'm looking up info about the easter eggs
---
Intestines still drop.  I had intestines drop last night.  And I ain‚Äôt talking prolapse.
---
I have a bloodied explosive level 35 pump that I found at uranium fever like a week after the game came out. I used to only run that because it would one shot literally everything up close beside SBQ. I ran some low health perks like serendipity 3 and nerd rage. Also had demo 5 and fireproof 3 and bloody mess 3
---
I dont have a shotgun build but use my 2 shot double fairly frequently. And for the most part it keeps up with the rifles class I'm running. 
---
It can 1 shot ghouls close range while my tse handmade cannot.
---
This is such BS. They said it was difficult content designed for 2+ players. An open world dungeon full of the same monsters we fight everywhere is not difficult, nor is it designed for a TEAM of 2+ players. 
---
I have garbage gear and build and I can solo clear the whole thing twice before I have to use a single stimpack to regen the damage I took. 
---
It is reasonable to expect this to have been instanced content, like the raids will be. There was no indication this was just another interior with average monsters. That it was advertised as a difficult team-based pve encounter implied it was instanced, implied the monsters inside would be more challenging. The whole thing takes 5-10 minutes to wipe out, and was full of the same monsters we encounter everywhere else.
---
The marketing team didn't do a good job, they lied. We were told only the best geared could maybe solo it. People in their 30's have cleared it. It's basically 1.5 whitesprings golf clubs full of average monsters.
---
The first time I did it, I didnt have to fight anything in the whole place until the 'boss' (a plain lvl 42 assaultron) because it had already been wiped out.
---
This isn't difficult pve content, it's a brainless one-shot slog against ghouls... the same monsters we have been farming for 6 months at whitesprings.
---
Is that true? 
---
`note to self, other travelers know of a different beast than the one I am hunting, look into at later date`
---
Need a perk card for that
---
I agree that anyone thought this was going to be a huge raid was over
---
I know they still drop. I just haven‚Äôt seen any in a while is what I said.
---
I'm not sure I understand what happened here. The "customer" attacked your team-member, and the team-member then fought back, thus plunging your whole team into PvP? Is that correct? 
---
Because if so, while it's obviously scummy of the customer to pull something like that, your team-member obviously bears some of the blame for rising to obvious bait like that.
---
Any and all normal armor effects are removed in power armor, even legendary prefixes
---
He is right, Buying a mod and buying a plan are two completely different things. I only comment on facts not opinions.
---
Weird times. As a stealth character I couldn't figure out if people were trolling or misunderstanding the term "stealth nerf"
---
Thanks for the heads up, I didn't know that.
---
Just keep your cool, even if someone comes in hunting burrows delvers its so winding and with so many blind corners and choke points chameleon armor and some nasty nuclear surprises make it a tense chess game. Nobody carries enough explosives to carpet bomb the whole area.
---
AHAHAHAHAHA ITS 2019 MATE ARE YOU SERIOUS ü§£ü§£ü§£ some people
---
Was that this morning if so i may have been on your server.
---
Yep, first objective on each server is, to turn on the radios in my home.
---
Nope!
---
Yeah.  I found one for the raider armor too and same deal.  Annoying.
---
Where does the marker for this come up?
---
I'm like really really devoted to PvP and PvP-reasearch in this game. I'm holding some tricks that work as implemented yet are neglected by majority. I think its safe to say I'm the best PvPer in my national community, and one of the major PvPers worldwide. I honestly believie I'm in positon to throw names of people my league, and I'm beginning to recognise those when I meet them. Most of them are Russian btw, maybe I'm zone-locked? From such perspective, I actually think that assassin sentinel is not really meta at all, and I think people who don't do headshots deserve what happens to them. You won because you didn't suck, your armor played a part in it, but its them who sucked that are resonsible for their defeat. Its good it happened.
---
I have a Glowing Yao Guai that spawns by my camp constantly.  He does not destroy anything maybe cause my camp build. I kill it every time I spawn back to my camp. I have tons of springs, waste acid, glowing meat and yao guai meat because of it. it's working out great for me
---
Yes, floor decor and then down to statues, for me the first one is the mini deathclaw statue and for some reason i have to scroll left instead of right to see the egg.  
---
Hope this helps! Took me a while to find it too.
---
For some reason this made me imagine turning a corner in survival and seeing some poor guy typing away at a terminal with his pants around his ankles lol.
---
It's great when you're in an xbox party and everyone has different latency while singing along lol
---
That‚Äôs stupid, what perk?
---
No. My customer and I were on a team. They then attacked another player (a non team member) that was behind me. That made us both go to PVP mode, and I was killed before I even knew what happened.
---
perception perk card concentrated fire
---
sure you don't want seconds?
---
i got intestines from a possum in Ash heap last night.
---
Squirrels, rabbits, chickens, frogs, possums....and beavers, I think are the only critters that drop intestines.  
---
(Never saw them in rats, dogs, or wolves.)
---
It's free from the shop.
---
It is definetly sometimes drop them. Killed 20+ creatures that used to(during the event) and only about 5 of them dropped intestines.
---
Just sucks because you need it for sausage.
---
All this time, and wooden armor was the answer we'd all been missing.
---
Looking into all marks I'm able, trying to be systematic in my approach to it. Walking from dot to dot.
---
And yet you still play. Guess you're a fucking idiot.
---
Tbh, I think the enclave scientists would win, don‚Äôt they have plasma rifles?
---
God bless ya bud! The wendigo head is the plan i was most excited to have!
---
Also did i totally missed the information of new quests in a patch notes or something?
---
Cheers!
---
yeah, I got a plan so i've been investigating too! An auto combat rifle set up how i like does 100 dmg and the Fixer is 120, nice easy maths there!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
i had a guy yesterday trying to take my workshop and he didn't even want it, he just wanted to kill me for my caps. when your a high level its even crappier cause you loose as much as your level, say 152 caps cause that is my level, i tried to leave the area and he still came after me even though i wasn't in the workshop zone. its just annoying how you can walk out of the workshop zone and still be able to kill somebody, i lost about 600 caps for no reason yesterday because this guy was so blood thirsty for caps. i just had to end up leaving the lobby because he just keep trying to find me. and it makes no sense how you can try to claim a workshop from any point within the zone. he would just aim at me them press claim real quick them shoot me within a split second it really makes no sense cause i wouldn't even have a chance at all. they really need to fix this issue
---
OP missed a huge point, for the end game fellas. I just nuked harper's ferry after seeing rifle gaming's video on youtube (he deserves the credit ;-)) and you get TWO layers of nuked zone. Harper's ferry is nuked - spawning high level mobs and nuked florae - and this also affects the Burrows. Every ghoul down there is a glowing one, once it has been nuked, and as each player jumps down there, THE GHOULS RESPAWN! i just got off from farming the place, and it was crawling with glowing ones. If people keep joining, it'll be crawling with good mobs
---
MODUS.
---
Command center vendor
---
Possibly the best source for brain and glowing fungi in the game
---
just remember you can always move  your base and all the stuff he destroyed will be fixed, it costs you nothing other then the camp move and the "griefer" is out time, money, and ammo
---
Enclave bunker mods. They randomly spawn in the vendor inventory.
---
I would say this happens with the All Rise. If you mod it It will turn into a super sledge.
---
Yeah I just realized this last night, I haven't played this game for about four months. I've logged in once in awhile for maybe a half an hour just to see if anything new is on the map or anything new with storage and whatnot. Last night though I don't know I just sat down and started playing again and country roads is one of the first things to come on the radio and it felt somehow  of nostalgic even though it hasn't been that long. I ended up doing that new event and it was crazy cuz I was about eight people there.everyone was going down left and right but everyone was running around picking each other up after and once people actually realized what to do it went by fairly smoothly the thing just had a lot of health. Super difficult rather chatic but lots of fun at the end.
---
Concentrated fire.
---
PS4. I swear I‚Äôve tried! I got there, no nuke no one else. A bunch of charred 62s! Lol after that I gave up and figure I‚Äôll get around to it later.
---
I‚Äôm level 10 at the moment so it‚Äôs fine by me üòÇ
---
Ooh, I can trade you. I always get glowing masses. Got 30 right now. They were safe because they were in my aid box
---
Also if you‚Äôre running a melee build, you probably have the Martial Artist perk, which reduces the weight of all melee and unarmed weapons as long as they‚Äôre in your inventory. I‚Äôm carrying about 40 legendary melee weapons that all weigh between 0.4-1.5lbs and take up only about 30lbs of inventory space whereas they‚Äôd easily take up close to 200+ lbs sitting in my stash.
---
It‚Äôs under the small statues like the mini deathclaw and mini brother hood of steel statue! Sorry for the late response
---
I‚Äôm still wa ting mines :(
---
i think the imposter-squatch fight was pretty challenging, especially alone :-P
---
My sister doesn‚Äôt like the 40‚Äôs/50‚Äôs style songs, so anytime that song comes on and my sister is near I‚Äôll turn the TV volume up so she can hear it. (I always play with headphones on and tv on zero)
---
I‚Äôve done this in 3 and 4, and in 76 it‚Äôs even better because she doesn‚Äôt mind Country Roads and Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice. So I can keep her on her toes.
---
Jus like playing the game :D
---
I guess I can swap to non pa, the only reason I‚Äôm using pa is because I never use it in any builds or in previous fallout games
---
I just edited my build and put in some non pa perks, how does this look? Would you change anything?
---

It depends on whether or not you have a soooothing voice.
---
I have grounded.  My resistance is at 400ish.
---
It still eats through and kills you fast
---
Slugger is for 2H melee. You need Gladiator for 1H.
---
Sadly there wasnt any patch notes.
---
two thumbs up to this guy for taking his role playing to this subreddit.... makes me kinda want to join your cult.. i mean your movement...
---
taxation is theft
---
There's a presidential update at some time in the future that probably finishes construction on the bunker.
---
Which I'm on board for, but honestly we need more than one place to farm and would also be cool to fight more than just ghouls for maximum end game farming.
---
When I put lol, normally I'm not, I'm just being polite but your post reply made me fucking laugh.
---
I'm new to this and have no gold to award you but if I did, platinum all the way. The names are spot on, I can imagine it as a cutscene. Bravo.
---
They're coming for that l√§mp
---
I mean it's a survival shooter game, you'd think folks would seek out the best armor to help them survive, and I'm not sure why your confused about it. 
---
It's easy enough to counter and they're far from immortal. Just learn to press that vats crit button and they'll drop.
---
The issue here isn't regular vs power armors. It's the lack of legendary affixes on power armors. If I see a power armor, they die. In one shot 90% of the time. Wearing a set of Sentinel assassin armor with fireproof, dense mod, dodgy, serendipity, etc. I can guarantee that nobody in power armor can best me in legit pvp. 
---
My point is that if someone has power armor on, I know there are no legendary effects preventing me from killing them. Someone in Ass/sent or Ass/cav is going to be infinitely harder to kill. I'm not wrong when I say that power armor users in PvP, either; have no idea what they are doing, know they are disadvantaged but want to be anyway, or do not have a choice because they lack the armor options. Someone who knows would stay away from these people.
---
I‚Äôm a fair trader too, have a bunch of random materials and goods, add me, roman2154 (PC)
---
Divorce sucks. Stay strong and I hope things turn out well.
---
I‚Äôve been religiously grinding for these tokens since launch, on multiple characters, and finally today had enough saved to get the head. Buy tokens from people any time you get the chance or it will take months
---
Did you get the new egg and how?  Mine won't show up, it's still the flowery one!
---
That's always a high possibility. If it's really high end stuff I wouldn't do it that way, but junk legendaries I'm saving for the vendor I will. I usually stay on the server a bit before doing it, if no  ukes or big events going on and the server feels pretty happy I'll do it, but there's always a chance.
---
They would have to specifically code to allow harpers ferry to be nuked and have it effect an interior zone. No way this wasn't intended.
---
Sorry I'm PS4
---
i mean if they weigh 30 in your inventory, they're not gonna weigh 200+ in your stash :-P martial artist only reduces the weight by 60%. Of course if you have additional armor reducing the weight, that's possible
---
Almost heaven...
---
&gt; Wearing a set of Sentinel assassin armor with fireproof, dense mod, dodgy, serendipity, etc. 
---
In other words, someone wearing an RNG dependent set of armor with near-impossible defined mods, which is a bullshit argument.
---
Its S of the Red Rocket at the top of the divide.
---
Pumpkins, appropriately, around the pumpkin house.
---
Do the event for some extra fun.
---
Depending on your level, you may see anything from low level scorched to   mutants, a sentrybot, or on a bad (good?) day, a SB with an attitude.

The greenhouse behind the Hornwright Summer Villa also has a gourd plant you can harvest and replant.

So...free bunny head....matching costume 1500 Atoms? Now taking bets

My personal fav is butcher Pete. Catch me whackin hackin and smackin out there in the wasteland!

I sneak around her. When I land enough hits for her to agro me I just hop like a bunny away from her until she leaves me alone again

so there's no bad posts and that's common sense, got it. Thanks, professor.

2 levels of concentrated fire, I think, to target a limb.

It‚Äôs confirmed to be 8pm EDT each day: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales
---
Yeah but still, what will there be to do in there?
---
lol is this the start of this shitty rumor
---
Yeah I actually enjoyed Burrows quite a bit. The spooky ambience and visual design of the place kept me hooked. Plus the Burrow King reminded me heavily of Negan from The Walking Dead, who is easily my favorite comic book/tv villain.
---
I immediately pictured a wendigo flopping around full sprint with a minigun blzzzing all over the place.
---
Yeah, he was transferring these items to an alt made for Survival, so that's why he was moving actual quality stuff instead of just muling heavy things. 
---
Definitely not what most people are doing when transferring stuff, but it's a big risk especially if you're using your mule to store junk/ammo
---
Anyone camp at the junk pile NW of Harper's Ferry and E of Berkeley Springs? Is that falling w/in the new primo nuke zone? I really don't want to move.
---
Yasss
---
I like what I've seen in TLoU so far, but I have not been able to get by those clickers in the downtown office building....
---
I didn't try it, just downvoting misinformation. Good try though you little social engineer
---
LOL!  Take an upvote for laughs...and the truth unfortunately.
---
I really like straighten up and fly right
---
welcome to the 21st century! rise of the corporations!
---
consumers be damned! the shareholders demand increasing returns!
---
im also sad at how things are going, apologists for big companies are just blind
---
There was power armor?!
---
Welcome to the grind.
---
It's all good dude! Have fun playing the game and good luck finding someone to play with :)
---
Agreed, that's why I don't chance it with high end stuff. Especially if you don't have a friend in the lobby, iv done it before just by picking someone and joining them, iv also created random teams before too just for that.
---
I got no legendaries, took my time, and the last robot boss suicides and i felt like i did nothing. There was no interaction like biv does, no strong enemies, barely any lore. Even the enemies in far harbor are more challenging. It has nothing that isnt done better somewhere else in the game.
---
I'm all about Mars, Bringer of War. Makes me feel like i should be gearing up and then proceed to blow something up with a mini nukeüòÅ
---
Yes happens to me every God damn day since the last update and that's when I call it quits for the night
---
Hope you see your daughter soon, I couldn't imagine the pain that would cause.

on top of it, when the daily actually does show up, you aren't even guaranteed the tokens. mucker and chow line *usually* pay out, but I haven't gotten tokens for dross toss in *months*. it doesn't matter that I make every shot, all holes, one hole, from inside, from outside etc. 
---
it really irks me that this has been broken since BETA but nobody says anything or gives a fuck. it's either brushed off bc people don't care about outfits, or people just give up and buy the suit from someone for caps - likely a duped version btw. to get the suit doing only the dailies, it takes just under 150 days. do you really think people are selling 5 months of grinding for 5-7k?
---
I've actually been going up to rando's and offering trades. if they have the tokens, i request them. some know the value and sell them for 20+ caps a piece. most don't really want them. I've had a bunch given to me for free, or under 5 caps a piece.
---
Welp, guess I gotta move my camp now.
---
I bet your comment won't stop OP from enjoying the game, but it was a good effort.
---
I don't understand this trend of calling game developers incompetent just because a game they make has a lot of bugs or something.
---
No software is without bugs.
---
Also, the very fact that they took an engine made for singleplayer and adapted it to work for multiplayer is more than enough to consider them competent.

Medic pump on a P.A torso, every time you go below 50% health you are stimpacked, it can still 1 hit kill slap you if it gets in your face but it really helps with the other robots

Anytime you want. I'd recommend using [http://nukesdragons.com](http://nukesdragons.com/) though to plan exactly what you want for whatever play style you're going for. Makes a big difference.
---
I use a silenced combat shotgun.  Scope on it and manage to get pretty good range stealth kills :)
---
The ongoing game is best in a group. Doing the new content and just hanging out trying to improve your character is more interesting with fun people. keeps it fresh.
---
YES! we could keep the same enemies, but have upgraded AI
---
Hope im outside the zone I live up on the cliff with the pup.
---
Was this recently? I can't believe it's been out for over a week and people still don't know how to do it. The instructions flash on the screen for crying out loud!
---
There are so many things that we cant do because it takes away from the realism of the game, but jamming a full suit of power armor into your pocket....this is ok. And if you use the portable power perk card, power armor chassis weigh 2.5 pounds! Even with barely any strength points you could walk around with 100 suits of power armor stuffed into your pocket, and you wouldnt even be overweight! Lol. 
---
But yes, if we are allowed to carry around suits of power armor, i dont understand why we cant quick select the chassis. Ive died a couple of times while trying to pull one out of my pocket. I dont think we should get rid of the enter/exit animation though.
---
So pumpkin item gets converted into guords when planting?
---
I know of plenty people who have said survival won't end griefing. Fortunately Bethesda is going to eliminate player's ability to damage camps however that'll only stop THIS type pf griefing. 
---
I personally think they should do the GTAO bad sport lobby. Maybe ban them to survival.
---
It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm bad at math.
---
And human psychology is a hell of a lot more complex than blaming your personal expectations on a game's marketing. Children watch commercials and believe their experience will be exactly as described-- adults manage their expectations despite the business's attempts to influence them with pitches. 
---
Also, don't give me any more horseshit about 'specific definition in that domain'. xD  There are many games using the term dungeon in many ways, and the basic use of that term does not imply a set difficulty or length; some dungeons are quite short and easy, others last pretty much the entire game and can be brutally hard. So fundamentally it is a *you* problem if you choose to believe a certain thing when you hear the word... and games companies are not beholden to your limited experience with, and understanding of, this common term. 
---
If you don't agree, that's cool. But you're still gonna be the person living with your own expectations and if they lead you to disappointment because you don't know how to control them in the face of marketing... oh well. Have fun with that. xD
---
As other people have mentioned, Berry mentats. Also, with a high perception (I have 14) it isn't hard to track people on the compass. I've seen red dots show up on my compass only to realize the person is on the other side of a hill, so I have no line of sight.
---
I server hopped into it twice last night RIGHT after it ended. So frustrating.
---
I don‚Äôt have any friends that play online and also my controllers won‚Äôt work with a headset so I couldn‚Äôt talk to them.
---
So do I claim one every 24 hours from the time I claimed my first one or does a new one show up each day ?
---
If that's accurate information, kudos to you for bringing it up and helping people understand that it's not as easy as they might think to get things like this done.
---
If you totally pulled that out of your ass and none of it is true, my hat is off to you, excellent job sir.
---
Don't reply to this, I don't want you to spill the beans, just let the though fester in everyone's minds.
---
To be frank, the papers in the enclave did say wild plants. But our wiki isn't as well updated as it should.

Good to know.

&gt;Whitesprings upstairs for instance

If we ever need to, the carpet in that area will make a great [dazzle camo.](https://i.imgur.com/3nRs9j4r.jpg)

Apparently it's longer than 24hrs. Because they just tweeted that it leaves the store 8PM EDT

Sheepsquatch is perfect difficulty for what it is. Totally defeatable, but tough and most importantly *has a mechanic that requires team coordination*.

Is that we‚Äôre all the workbenches are? And the stash boxes?

Those hooks must be for kids. My exit point is when I get paid and my entry point is when I get bills. All I care about at my age is that when I press the button, it works as described, which is sadly not very frequent in this game. Why anyone would be drawn into a game where they are locked out of something they paid for is probably beyond me. 
---
Must be a form of masochism, or maybe leftism. Just like communists telling people when it's okay to eat, to visit the mall or drive a car. Imagine renting an apartment, but you can only use certain rooms once a week. Would be okay with no one, why would it be okay in a game? Once you pay for it, it's not to have to wait on weekly handouts to use what you paid for. Plus, in videogames, there's no real concept as sharing, unlike reserving semi-private rooms in condos.
---
I bought a headset for the game for under $20. That is needed, imo to make the most of a group. I‚Äôm in the rgg group club. We have regular and less regular people and I look forward to playing each time. If Xbox one, check us out. My GT is strembrulie.
---
In my stash box, unable to be INSTALLED! Grrrr! Lol, but in all seriousness what the other two said. Enclave Bunker. Vendor next door to the nuke tutorial room.
---
BETHESDA, please give us outfits that match the WS god awful carpet upstairs in the dining area
---
Thanks for sharing! Does this mean at 8Pm EDT it will change to the Patterned Deathclaw Egg? I am still seeing the Flowery Egg and the 16-17 and 17-18 is a little misleading.

Military wing. past the laser grid where you learn the X-01 plans

That's a long list.

Don't even bother man. This reddit is 99% Bethesda employees that downvote threads pointing out problems and bugs.

&gt;Someone in Ass/sent or Ass/cav is going to be infinitely harder to kill. I'm

Not even talking about because virtually no one has a full  set.
---
Yes. They just put a post on Twitter.

Bad posts are posts that break the rules laid out by the mods, who control the purpose of the reddit.

You're welcome, student. ;-)
---
I have a couple different characters. First one from beta is a sniper (lv64), my main is a stealth commando (lv50), third is stealth melee i.e. ninja (lv17), and fourth is an in-your-face shotgun user (lv9). I switch back and forth depending on my mood.
---
Where can I find info on the Arktos Pharma Dungeon? I can't find a mention of it in the Roadmap.
---
I found a bug killer explosive assault rifle at a vendor on PC it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Pretty much. Does it really matter where you do it?
---
Would be nice to have a direct view and be able to purchase on the go, if you‚Äôre unavailable!
---
I have a headset, it just doesn‚Äôt work with my controllers. I plug it in and the controller doesn‚Äôt recognize the headset is plugged In. Google searching this problem has lead me to believe I need to buy a new controller, which will never happen.
---
yeah its another bug introduced by the last patch, im getting it and so are my teammates,one of my teammates said it makes her nauseous when she see it flickering and stopped playing until they fix it as she spends most of her time in game making soups and building her CAMP
---
hope they fix it soon!
---
Power armor caps and sets your strength at 11.
---
Right?!
---
Oh no!! That sucks! Lol I hope they fix it soon
---
I added you. My GT is Oh Wander. Thanks!
---
Good luck finding them. I've checked every day for 3 months and never even found one, let alone two, if that gives you any idea of how rare they are, and yes, I've server hopped. Several times. I got lucky by fnding somebody on here to sell me a set for 1k apiece. I still check thr Enclave though to see if they have any, just not as often now that I have a set. Your best bet of getting any is to ask on here, or wait about a month and start checking player vendors. Have fun.
---
Just so you know, unless there are very specific circumstances going on, it‚Äôs not your wife‚Äôs choice to keep you away from your daughter there‚Äôs very likely legal action you could pursue to see her.

Fck

Fckiiiit!
---
Just finished it trivially easy with my 80-ish melee who most time is in PA and using an AA or instigating sledge. I keep lots of QOL weight perks on him too most of the time (Thru Hiker, Traveling Pharmacy) and only put on the adrenalines, etc. for SBQ. Strength primarily, Charisma secondarily.
---
Done it also on both my 150-160s. 
---
I‚Äôd expect ‚Äúdon‚Äôt venture in without 2 people 50+‚Äù to be more like a Nuke silo.
---
This. My job doesn't leave me a lot of free time and I really want those easter eggs.
---
Lol, these spoiled brats will downvote anyone that dares tell them the truth. Feck, they got free content and a new area to explore. What did you guys really expect for FREE?
---
Gotta love the Andrew Sisters! They‚Äôre honestly a staple of this franchise.
---
No you can't.  Only the BOS helmet paint can be got through scrapping
---
Logging out doesn't work. I killed a guy that was destroying my CAMP in Survival. I was meeting up with someone in Adventure to do a trade, so I took his crap and logged out. When I joined the on guy I was meeting up with, I realized I had a 200 cap bounty.
---
I'm glad it turned out to be a great nuke spot from what I've been hearing.
---
Sucks that it was disappointing anyway, but it sounds like we've got another really good spot to nuke. Which is a good thing considering it was literally just fissure site prime or whitespring.
---
Chally the moo-moo says "hi!"
---
Glad you had a good experience! The game does still need work, but it really has improved.
---
Yes you are.
---
I'm having it for the durability yes! So that I can keep from having to repair stuff as much. 
---
Yeah I'll get weapon artisan eventually too! 
---
Hmm rad sponge, I see what you are sayin but it's excellent in nuke zones and what should I have there to switch on and out with? 
---
Hmm Rejuvenated maxed is 2 points. Should I relocate the extra endurance point left over? 
---
Oh yeah I plan to pick up chemist and super duper and I dilute my stimpacks!
---
To be honest, it‚Äôs like that on PC too üòÇ
---
ok...that tells me either you came over the top near the WS lookout tower (there's a pair of 62's there) - they kicked my butt all over the place, more than once) or there was still some reesidial nuke around, and none had done a run to take them out.
---
I'm PS4 also.  
---
  Not sure if/how long I'll be on between now and then, but I know I'll be on late Friday night- likely not until after midnight.  
---
Last play session, I was in the middle of the ashheap and headed the general direction of WS.
---
I'll go along with you if you'd like escort.  
---
Will have to walk from wherever - I'm overuncumbered so can't fast travel.
---
GT is aj ninetyeight.
---
They're dead like all the other factions. This makes them worst... how?
---
Looking to see any of those?
---
Huh, I'll have to try out these tips, thanks all!
---
I absolutely loathe Power Armor, but if I have to, I have to.
---
Have yet to come across a gauss rifle, Handmade rifle, etc. 
---
Rifleman is maxed out.  I think I have Enforcer, will double check when I play again.
---
In the couple fights I have done with them, I realized I simply don't have enough ammo between all my guns to kill one.  I'm doing tiny slivers of damage per shot.  Where's a good place to find something decent?  I've been all over the map and I usually just find combat rifles, hunting rifles, etc.  nothing truly impressive.
---
Are we twins?
---
I've been having to beg my GF to log-on for me while I'm at work so I can get different free items. :D
---
honestly i was nervous about htat. but hands down the lore worked and damned if it wasn't the best Arc of the story
---
Unfortunately no, PA is limited to mods only. Stats from armor worn under PA are not active while wearing PA.
---
Honestly I enjoyed singing along to Johnny guitar. the music list in new Vegas has been my favorite so far.
---
Hive mind? The vast majority of you are complaining about everything. You‚Äôre given free content, and the majority saying negative stuff are acting like they‚Äôre entitled to whatever their imaginations can dredge up. Bethesda has been pretty responsive to a lot of the suggestions and valid criticisms, but some of you are just total babies. If you really don‚Äôt like the new ‚Äòdungeon‚Äô then don‚Äôt play it - you didn‚Äôt invest a single dime into it - only 5 minutes of your time. No one owes you ANYTHING!
---
Fanboy detected
---
Sometimes tho...you just gotta be funny. :D
---
You're like the crazy "Uncle Traveling Matt" of Fallout
---
Yep, they need to fix some bugs, build some tech like the instancing stuff they were talking about, and then let the quest and level designers go wild.
---
I own it. And was screwed by it like everyone else
---
Comment section seems to disagree üòâ
---
Whoa whoa there GheghisKunt, don‚Äôt get mad cause I made you read a bit.
---
No real info yet, but the wild appalachia video has a underground location shown that has the Arktos logo in several places, so... it is coming!!!
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong,I enjoy hearing country roads  in 76 but I hear it so much already since I live smack dab in the middle of WV. it gets a little old after awhile lol
---
Only if we also get InsultBot with a pair of assaultrons doing the same. Server Announcement: You've Been Assaulted
---
&gt; They said it would fundamentally change the game and bring back player choice...
---
They also said that  the borrows was an endgame dungeon for two characters over level 50.   See a possible pattern here?
---
I found it! Thank you (:
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying but I kinda think the tone of a song and when it feels like it‚Äôs from is more important than when it‚Äôs actually from in fallout. I really like how the collection of songs in 3 and NV go together.
---
Yeah I should have known better than to engage with someone who regularly uses ‚ÄúxD‚Äù. Enjoy your readings. 
---
P.S. You‚Äôre still wrong. They marketed this as one thing and it‚Äôs another. People are understandably disappointed. The end.
---
That song's ok, though I wish they had gotten a better artist to record it (it's kinda terrible compared to the original).  My favorite is Sixteen Tons.
---
aw hell no fuck that dude
---
I added a few songs from New Vegas to my radio in 76. I needed some ‚ÄúI Got Spurs‚Äù ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that a kick in the head‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Moon‚Äù
---
XP Farming, Legendaries.
---
Strictly my opinion based off my 165 levels with about the last 100 being bloody. I have a multi build. My weapons I carry with me are a simple 1* Bloody DCG, 4* Bloody Machete, 1* Bloody Combat shotgun, 1* Bloody Combat Rifle and my 3* TSE Lever. I play around with them all. My mele weapons kill pretty much everything in one hit and I never use a mele perk card. So maybe you won‚Äôt need to invest so much in mele. You‚Äôre gonna crush everything if your low heath without the perks. But it‚Äôs based on what weapons you have. 
---
As for the meat eater one, just get carnivore mutation. You can use that perk elsewhere. Other mutations you want are healing factor, speed demon, adrenaline, marsupial and maybe a twisted muscles or talons. I have all them if you need. 
---
Hope it makes sense. Just build what you feel and as you get higher you can improve or change based on your play. I have 23 perk points I haven‚Äôt even used yet because I like my build the way it is now.
---
I completely understand in that case üòÇ
---
Find a few friends, hang out at someone's camp and use musical instruments, do your own rendition of country roads...and drink plenty of Nukashine.
---
I havnt seen any legendarys and Ive been to two nukes so far. Whats going on?
---
You mean like all the megachurch corporations do? Don't make me laugh. Money changes things
---
I too have been double Mothman'd. I was still pretty low level at the time and had to run after picking a fight I couldn't finish, right into the second one. I died, hard.
---
Yea, sorry. The quote I put in the title I guess was a little misleading. I was referencing the show myself. The image I included is the real mystery. I think it has something to do with aliens so I included the quote from one of my favourite shows from my childhood
---
Oh wow, so original
---
While I don't have small kids, I got out of a bad relationship myself and I agree with you 100%. This game has been everything I needed to keep me from crying myself to sleep with a broken heart sometimes. And know just like life outside the vault, you may not have been fully prepared for what is out there, but you know you are strong and smart enough to survive.  
---
Just try to be strong for your little one and if that fails, spam your lawyer like a scorchbeast with ways you can see them more. And I have it on Xbox if you ever feel like you just need someone to pick up scrap with you. Talk or don't, sometimes it's just the company you need.
---
Very interesting, I'm still wondering about the presediential content ( seems a lot of work went into the boring stuff for it to not be functional yet everywhere) 
---
 Also the train station computers ( feel like it hints at some kind of fast travel system). Also the ruined towns in the mire. ( So much detail but empty?) Same in top of the world. There's tons of stuff I'm wondering about. Good find.
---
Excellent read
---
Jesus guys, how the fuck are you doing this to yourselves. 
---
DO NOT GET HYPE FOR A DUNGEON WHEN ALL YOU HAVE IS A SCREENSHOT OF A WALL WITH A LOGO.
---
The 5 points in demo expert is a waste on explosive weapons. Plenty of other perks that will up your damage.
---
Howdy, any of you two fine gents mind lending me some gear if y‚Äôall dont get on much anymore? I‚Äôm level 66 (I think) and generally have trouble getting around with my constant lack of ammo and just decent weaponry/armor, with the exception of an instigating war drum, but thats it. Im a shotgun / melee / vats build if that helps, again, just asking, you don‚Äôt need to actually give me anything and if so its just a loan, meaning I would give the weapon/armor back once I get my own decent gear to sustain myself
---
It'll be there at 8pm Eastern tonight.
---
It's a ton of fun if the people playing actually know how to do it
---
Does having more str than 11 in a PA build mean I'm wasting points then?
---
‚ÄúBuzzzzzzzzzzzz‚Äù

On the route 65 road with Bog town behind you, you'll see a blue car in a hole in the road, that's the start.

---
üëè very well put.
---
One of the first quests of the game and they still don‚Äôt have this fixed.   LAME
---
Unfortunately, there is not.
---
I know, I was commenting more about the "wild appalachia" board we have to click through now.
---
Imagine you're a new player and a level 244 just stops in front of you, and you hear, "HHHHHNNNNNNGGGGGG" and a colorful Easter egg containing a Nuka Cola pops into view
---
It really sucks that we have to wait another couple of weeks for the Purveyor.  I wish Bethesda could give us more insight as to how he will function exactly.  Something about getting Tokens is all I know.
---
He never truly breaks though. He's got repair nanobots in him or something. I assume he acts helpless because he knows deep in his heart the person he's delivering his message to is dead, but he still wants to complete his mission. If players help him he gets the joy of having someone hear his message even if it's not the intended recipient.
---
Holy hell, did you guys **not** see the smily face? I was joking!
---
Are you console or PC? I'd say the only viable way on PC is to give someone you trust your credentials.
---
Itd be nice if adventure mode removed pvp.  Im not interested in it at all.
---
I don't believe there are any (at least not public ones).  I've never seen or heard of an invite to closed ones either.
---
Updates require both server AND client-side patches/updates, so if there was a test server available to the public (either invite or open), you'd have to have a second client installation to visit it.  I know that Steam has some kind of provision for things like that, but I don't know if the Bethesda system has something like that.  And I'm not aware of console details to any great extent, I don't know that they have anything resembling that. 
---
It would be a great idea, but it does create some problems, even aside from the whole client issue.  It's really a bit complicated to have something like that in place.
---
Oh how ridiculous. Maybe they won't let you have contact because you fucking play Fallout all day. Don't upvote this shit, put an end to sensationalism and pity praise.
---
I agree 100%!  There are so many tunnels and passageways that could be expanded on that the tunnels could be potentially limitless.
---
How cool would a Burrows/Camp Venture story arc be? Or an expansion on the strangler plants? All dealing with the Burrows tunnels?
---
Thanks for letting us s know about this trick .and sorry it happened to you.
---
my mule is encumbered with junk alone and I even teamed up many times with trader to sell my junk.
---
They could have took everything I got by just doing this, 
---
Noted, no more being on the same team with traders.
---
If you want to add heavy weapons to your build either by carrying alot or increasing the dmg, you can do 2 slogger 2 exp slugger 2 master slogger freeing up 3 cards for bear arms, rank 3 heavy guns dmg or rank 3 traveling pharmacy if you carry a lot of stims and radaway. This could be something you can switch on and off after lvl 50, but if you wanna plan ahead and save 3 str for another perk could be more beneficial than 15% 2h dmg.
---
There are 3 locations I know of where they can spawn. What platform are you on?
---
What hype?
---
Looks very op in carry weight based on how ez it is to craft
---
I can relate to this both in-game and IRL
---
&gt;  The first pack is almost always about QoL and extra ‚Äúfirst play through‚Äù content to entice potential on-the-fence buyers to hop in 
---
Well it seems to be failing and that is just a stupid idea.   If they get new players, there's no guarantee that they will stick around.  The existing player base has been around for around five months now and is becoming increasingly frustrated.  Common sense says the priority should be preventing the game from turning into a ghost town by retaining your existing player base.
---
Yes and no. You still get the perk card slots and their bonuses
---
"But I want to cycle through my keys and keycards when I go dumping all my ores and gunpowder" said no one ever, also would like to see they make it so I can only hold one of each key and keycard too since got 12 mama dolces cards in my inventory since I keep forgetting I already have it plus would free up servers workload even if its just a small amount.
---
Actually, the first egg dropped yesterday. I have it sitting at my CAMP on my desk. Unless it was a fake egg or a glitch.
---
Stop being such a Debby downer
---
There were rumors of finding the eggs in your C.A.M.P?
---
I wish. They made this dang egg thing on one of the most traveled holiday weekends.
---
Thinking about dragging my xb with me, just to get the completion. 
---
I may have a problem...
---
I noticed that too.  Notice at the DMV terminal there was talk of registering a robot as I recall.  I‚Äôm thinking (wishing) we may get populated settlements.
---
Now the idea of wastelanders coming into WV after we‚Äôve cleaned the place up, and making a new mess of things...  well now, we may have some ‚Äúeducating‚Äù to do....
---
Did you even read what I posted lol
---
We can hope.
---
Would love option to drop them or stop getting more of them.
---
Yep figured that out after having the burrows all to myself. I did manage to find one extra note that I missed, and just read some of the terminals, so a little bit more I learnt today, but I still feel as if it's just missing some touches that would make the experience better, but as a whole being able to do this myself, I did manage to get a better feeling to the place.
---
Seriously awesome lyrics, I agree.
---
I found one of them at the Top of the World, in one of the safes.
---
Really ‚ÄúMusic Canon‚Äù in chronologically later Fallout games make no god damn sense. 
---
It‚Äôs been 200 years since the fall of civilization. Some Raiders definitely made a punk band. We all know they did.
---
Search is your friend
---
How do you place it?? I can‚Äôt find the damn thing in the CAMP menus
---
Do you still need help?
---
Very well put, and I agree with all of it. 
---
Butttttttttttt, if users here can't learn to use the simple search function to find answers to questions that have been asked hundreds of times, it's definitely a stretch to think they'll stop acting like they're entitled to everything under the sun.
---
Honestly, last week I got the mascot mask on the first try and the mascot costume on a different character. 
---
Then yesterday I did the event 4 times, nothing but fedoras.
---
Omg your merika, IM from Merika too!
---
Yep.
---
I put a barrier around my fusion and a flamer on a switch to destroy it when I'm farming/runs.. It works great once the flamer destroys it, have rats and the rest walk through.. they don't care. It's the generator that pisses them off. My camp has high defense when it's up and running, so it's really not necessary but I don't come home to wall repairs anymore from a scorch or mutant taking pot shots across the map all day. Find plenty of water in the wild.
---
If you grow crops, gl maybe put them inside. I wish they let you grow some useful ingredients like silt bean, might be worth the hassle of having a brahmin and crops
---
Looks like Burroughs north. That will get the cabin in the blast radius and, therefore, the nuked flora.
---
Yeah that's annoying as hell.
---
It's under floor decor.
---
When are you on?
---
I always appreciate when higher levels lend me a hand! I'm currently only level 23, so everyone I meet is pretty much experienced. I started the game super late, and the community in this game is always helpful. It's truly amazing!
---
This exact thing happened to my husband's cousin. He lost something like 40 bulk springs and some other stuff, don't remember how much it was exactly, was a lot. Lesson was learned about teaming with someone to sell junk. Sucks that it happened to you.
---
&gt; should have known betheda lies alot
---
It's sad, but at this point perhaps we *should* have known.  I realize that they're different departments and ventures, but look at the canvas bag debacle and the Nuka Dark disappointment.  Both ended up feeling like straight up deceptive marketing.  I really enjoy this game and want it to succeed, but in order for that to happen they need to start speaking the same language as their customers.
---
There is and Arkos Pharma dungeon coming in the future which I believe is going to be harder. I did see a Mirelurk queen.
---
True
---
Casual players will have plenty to do.
---
Players who put in 14 hours a day for 5 months and don‚Äôt have things to do? 
---
Play another game for now lol
---
I‚Äôm being a rational person that doesn‚Äôt want to see the community fly into a rage and blame the Dev‚Äôs for not delivering something that has *literally no evidence of existing in the form people are saying it does*.
---
Can we also have all Overseer holotapes place in one holotape? With the option to select them as if accessing a terminal.
---
Like a chicken pot pie.  But mysterious.  And canned.
---
Love this, one time i heard a kid at grafton get so pissed he scrapped his gear by mistake, i just crafted a full set for him right quick. Dont let this kids quit lol
---
Except that at PAX in the fallout76 section they specifically mention the Arktos Dungeon, so maybe you need to do your own research before posting
---
Whoever downvoted you doesn‚Äôt give me much faith there sadly
---
You‚Äôre going to want some DMG resist perks like barbarian or the one in Agility (forget the name but it give you + dmg resist with every agility point or something like that). If you plan on critical, OU may want action boy at least 1. 
---
And you don‚Äôt have to max out every perk. I only use 1 each Rifleman cards +30 dmg and can one shot anything under level 70-80. I would rather use a perk card elsewhere instead of being super over powered for no reason. Unless your playing PVE.
---
One could think it's almost as if they planned on adding more content over the lifetime of the game!
---
What are some good examples here?
---
Suggestions?
---
Tell me, if I deliberately step on an ant, would that make me a griefer?
---
And why do y'all keep talking about dicks?
---
Dont tell them the secret.
---
Just 1*. Each additional * only gives 5% to hit, and 2% dmg, to a max 15% to hit, and 7% dmg.
---
You do you feel the need to gatekeep this?
---
Apparently not, LoL. Yeah, sorry, just saw that you said it leaves the shop in 5ish hours. DOH!!!! I was still half asleep from my nap so didn't completely comprehend what I was reading.
---
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it, LoL.
---
Carry on üòÅüëç
---
You are hyping up Arktos Pharma right now, with this post. 
---
‚ÄúImagine how hard it‚Äôs going to be?‚Äù 
---
Dude. We don‚Äôt even know what it is. It could be a low level quest-line that introduces breaking down chems into components or something. 
---
It could easily be an amazing dungeon, but acting like that‚Äôs *at all* confirmed is setting yourself up for disappointment, and the community doesn‚Äôt need anymore of that.
---
I accidentally scrapped my power armor once. It was a sad day. :b
---
For those who can't find the eggs in their build menu,  it's in Floor Decor in the section with the mini deathclaw and power armor statues.
---
idk if that was a glitch but god damm did it make for a good reward. finish the dlc, get unbreakable power armour.
---
wish fallout 76 had rewards like that...sigh haha
---
üòÇ I'm dying and I can't agree more, I never watched fraggle rock so I didn't know who that was, [now I do](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Uncle_Traveling_Matt) so thanks
---
I see your point but its worth mentioning Burrows is a small part of Wild Appalachia. When its all said and done we will have had multiple new quest lines, player vending, camera, legendary vendor, pvp mode, etc. And the way they are talking this isnt even really an expansion. 
---
Im underwhelmed as well so far, but Wastelanders is supposed to be the first full fledged major expansion. This drip feed of smaller content in the meantime is supposed to tide us over until Wastelanders drops. 
---
Hopefully the Vault Raids will be the dungeon experience we are looking for
---
Huh?
---
Haha all good, we all make mistakes. No harm!
---
Does it matter? It‚Äôs your user name that everyone sees
---
What locations are they?
---
My roommate is kind enough to do this for me if they're around
---
Go to the Taxidermy Store.  Look at all the things on the walls.  Click on all the things on the wall.  All quests, get.  Done.
---
I tried tonight and not as rentable as Wes Tek for me
---
And the dev's saying so at PAX
---
Witcher 3 complete is $20 right now. Hundreds of hours, all doc included, and everything works. Have a blast!
---
Is there any advantage to the eggs, or is it purely cosmetic?
---
Only like 5 head can be found rn
---
Yeah, PC. None of my friends have PCs though  haha
---
How much damage are you trying to get too. 90% of you the enemies in the game you‚Äôre gonna be able to one shot them with demo expert 1 and sneak crits. Hell, you can probably kill them in one shot without any demo expert TBH. I use a shitty 1* bloody combat rifle with the sneak bonus only at 2 and it kills every ghoul in one shot. Only using 1 each rifleman perk cards.
---
They're just little decorations. I like them though.
---
Hijacking to mention the two added/fixed yesterday:
---
Go to Southern Belle Motel and read the CH Monthly, January on the outdoor table
---
Go to Ingram Mansion and listen to the holotape there.
---
My wife and I did the Burrows. I don't feel like the  it's worth the time. What's the point of trying to farm 3‚òÜ legendaries if the don't yield loot of equal value. I killed 2 3‚òÜ legendaries and both had a Drill as the primary loot, a Drill.
---
Idk how many times ive been trying to hide thinking Im clever and someone half a mile away waves at me. Usually trade a few items and then back to slinking around lol.
---
That's not how percentage works
---
Pasifist only keeps you from hurting other players. It doesnt keep them from being able to hurt you
---
I mean, by definition Legacy is no longer an item obtainable from a drop.
---
XB1
---
Also if you wanna use VATS definitely try out the four leaf clover perk at rank 3. It seems to proc a lot with shotguns
---
They *say* a lot of shit; it's the delivery that tends to be lacking.
---
The only thing i really want or even demand is to have less bugs. I mean come on the game launched months ago
---
I know one, could you message me the other two? Thanks!
---
It's also possible that you can trigger a behemoth by picking up his favorite teddy bear from the shopping cart in the middle of a junk field, and then get destroyed by him (thank you fallout 4.)
---
If that were me, I'd still pay you for what you lost.  If it's his fault you lost it, he should man up and take care of you.
---
BUCK, BUCK, BUCKIIIIIT!!!
---
Friendly reminder that T60 shocks are easy to find and you can use T60 legs w/ X01 until you find your ‚Äúperfect‚Äù set up. Plenty of people do this.
---
I myself have several sets with jet packs, but have never EVER seen a calibrated shock for the X01. I‚Äôm sitting on a pile of them for EXC and even a kitted T51 ... but no luck on the X01 ... so using those T60 legs myself.
---
400 hours and never knew this. What else am I missing?
---
I thought it was a two way thing?  Couldn't damage or take damage.  Guess I was wrong.
---
The truth is that as some perks are level locked you cant for example have 5th level of adrenaline on level 50 - hence there is an advantage between level 400 and 50, but there is no advantage between level 400 and 70 - as long as the 70 is optimised.
---
Chase the challenges, should keep you busy. :)
---
Yeah. If you come here and say everyone was screwed by it. You don't own it.
---
I know your comment is kind've tongue-in-cheek but it is an easter event so it would need to be, well, on the week of easter...
---
I think Bethesda and devs are sitting through the messy rhetoric and seeing the issues that cause the inflammation. Even the casual players among us see things like challanges being put out that are unable to be accomplished or loreless additions to the game that give no added value to the player or franchise, but this space being a sort of less moderated space for all things 76 the loudest will always prevail. For the rest of us who enjoy the game and are also frustrated, we hope this experiment succeeds not just for our $60 "investment" but for the fallout franchise as a whole. There aren't many deep story based RPGs left and as far as I know.... No multiplayer ones with this much context. So passionate about it's success most of us would agree we are... But to be stomping crybabies yea it's time that ended.
---
I do this too...and have played over 400 hours
---
My luck is 10 and I‚Äôm getting on average at least  1 x 3 star and 5x 1 star or diseased.... for   5 to 10 mins work
---
Now I don‚Äôt have to run west tek only
---
I like your thinking üëç
---
Gratz. You deserve a lifetime ban.
---
" You were too weak to defend yourself. " - True, not my fault 
---
" You can leave the server aka the coward's way out." - So please tell me oh wise one, if I can't kill him, and I want my base in one piece, what do I do that isn't "the cowards way out"?
---
" Instead of crying to daddy Bethesda that little Timmy stomped your sand castle, maybe stomp his." - I didn't know where his base was, and there's no way to find out, and I wasn't looking to get a bounty?
---
Take off demo. You probably get a 10% damage bonus for 5 pips of it. Tske off your demo and put it back on you will realize that it is not worth the points. Adrenaline can get you 60%. If you are using vats four leaf clover can get you a crit almost every other shot. Grim Reaper sprint is also useful to keep your AP up.
---
Yeah lol I use 4 pieces of unyielding so my perception is high enough to see anyone with a weapon out from pretty far away. Even if they sneak they still show up on my compass and I'll just chameleon and watch what they do
---
I like to think the portion of the plans describing the left ear were illegibly damaged.
---
I agree with you and the known issues thread being pinned really helped keep that kind of feedback organized
---
No the railway rifle and the harpoon gun and the cross bow literally are not pipe weapons
---
The reality is TSE shotgun and/or TSE handmade should be super rare, 1 in 1000...maybe 10,000, but because of dupers   there are thousands of them floating around along with tons of assorted 3* assassin/sentinal or cavalier with AP refresh. 
---
That is what has largely killed any sense of balance. Yes, they were "nerffed", but they are still the strongest range weapons available...and when Bethesda did nerf them everyone wailed and moaned so much that it stopped them from doing the same to the OP armor and melee.
---
Agree the game is not really worth playing by yourself.
---
I like things like this, and the fasnacht masks because it's almost like a "badge of honor".
---
New players this time next year won't have any of this stuff and will be like "where'd you get **THAT**"
---
Thanks for your reply and I couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
You don't have to mad to think someone is an idiot. And you couldn't even attempt to spell Genghis correctly? All you had to do was read my name and type the same letters. And why Kunt and not Cunt? Doesn't even rhyme or make a pun, so why do an incorrect spelling of that as well? Naw, I'm gonna have to give you a D on this attempt, which I guess for you in Special Ed is probably like an A-.
---
Either way your a fucking tool. We don't know the situation but you don't need to be a fucking douchebag about it. He made a simple post  saying thanks.  Why you got to attack the guy? He is having a rough time and being happy he has a way to get his mind of the bullshit he is going through. Divorce is never easy on either side. But you felt the  need to kick him when he is low. Seriously?
---
My camp is a complete set up for low levels. Right in the stream next to the Overseers camp. 4 big water purifiers and crops galore lmao. I also get a chance to show off all of my mounts haha.
---
...and I guarantee that the same folks will chew it down in 16 hour days and Red Bull fueled weekends, and take to the internet in droves to bitch about how easy it was and how it was too short.
---
I know your pain. But here's how I found my pair. Yes just found my second one this morning. Both have been found not by server hopping but by being disconnected from the server and logging back in to a new server ( and I know it's not total) but there were only 3 others showing on the map and that were new to the recent list. I never found one server hopping. Looks like I just got lucky. But as others have said. It sitting in my stash for Beth to fix the mod bug
---
Gammer tag is xx Dinkles xx.  I'll be on in a few minutes.
---
They will spawn, allegedly, once every 200 trips to the MODUS vendur in the military wing. I have been there way more than 200 times and have never seen any so... good luck with that.
---
You're more than welcome to add me if you ever need help. I'm on Xbox, BigPoppaTrav.
---
Yeah, I'm afraid, no matter how well reasoned your post, you're up against an army of the entitled. It's the echo chamber affect of the internet and I'm not sure there will ever be a fix for it.
---
This game as a whole as a major balancing issue, in my option I think stripping it back would actually do the game a favour, then slowly add in the rare guns ect
---
PC price 1cap per 100
---
Also taking demo off you could probably take fireproof off too. I have a nocturnal explosive I use for WS Ghouls to cripple legs. If they get close I normally take no to minimum damage from blow back.
---
My poor base.
---
I will try to be there.
---
Thanks, man. Appreciate you
---
I scraped my ultracite armor when I first finished the Brotherhood missions... dont feel bad lmao.
---
Getting camp plans, either by taking over workshops or making enough money to buy them from vendors to further customize your camp. Get Legendaries to further improve your character for survival and upcoming raid content. Building camps at work shops gives you more freedom to be creative if building for a session is fun, just blueprint the floor and pick up where you left off. I have a max build height tower blueprint saved.
---
Nope
---
There is the prestige function coming sometime this summer but we know absolutely nothing about it.
---
I saw someone nuke it earlier today and wondered what they were up to.  I mean, they don't even have a DMV there!
---
I'm pretty sure this has always been here.
---
I would legit purchase a full respec lol. I'm so tired of this one level thing
---
Probably an oversight.  It really started happening (I believe) when they last updated the camp budget allocations.
---
That being said, amongst the many bugs in FO76, dropping in a blueprinted base is rather sketchy.  Things attached to walls will often lead to an error (item floating or something like that).  Anything in the blueprint that isn't a part of the main structure (like purifiers or secondary buildings) can also cause issues.
---
Your best bet is to blueprint the base structure you have, prior to any decorations or too many other miscellaneous bits, and save that for relocation.  Even then, it's going to be a bit difficult to do unless you have a pretty flat location in both the before and after spots, unless you build your base from a single foundation piece.
---
Except Reddit would lose its collective mind...for better or worse, Bethesda does pay attention to this sub and they do not want them going ape shit again
---
Pretty sure Biv is dependent on when you finish it, though.
---
Sadly I am on PC also sadly the "dungeon" is a massive disappointment there were about like 12 ghouls which I had no trouble with stealth killing.
---
You may not be twins,,,.but he may be your Seoul Brother.
---
Is the Burrow north different as south? I soloed south as it came out yesterday and was disappointed. I‚Äôm lvl 67 and found it really easy, the only enemy that wad a bit harder was the assaultron.
---
Also eagle eyes would be amazing for this build and if you are always in a group I would consider herd mentality.
---
Ahh yes. what a way to display such wisdom and power in green.
---
God I hate posts that start with "Dear Bethesda" that said I like the Idea of an elevator that doesn't start until you have met the minimum player requirements though I'd lower it to 5 players with no level requirement. 
---
It's a good way to incorporate team play in a game that can mostly be done solo.
---
Added! Oh Wander is my GT.
---
Good on you lol yea there are a lot of easy things to miss in the game, I try to remember to teach them how to do these things so they dont rely on me haha.
---
Thank yall!
---
Oh damn! Yea a few times was enough to really piss me off! I was pissed to have to give up my little bit of junk honestly. Every time they do an update something else gets fucked up. Then they in turn have more and more shit to fix. I‚Äôm sure they will fix it on tuesday... probably.
---
I'm more hopeful they're teasing a *different* cryptid and we'll get strung along through several before the squatch reveal.
---
As much as I travel The Mire. I am talking level 120-ish to level 180-ish I have never seen a event like this. I have not travel like I normally do this past week because of the Importer Event and some of the challenges. I really think this is new.
---
This game seems to really hate those who work/have families/go to school/not enough money lol. Everything is timed or atom store expensive. I agree this could be a nice fix.
---
True, but was making it *every single day*, instead of an event you can earn in game really necessary?
---
Nope, seems to reset every night at 8 PM.  No matter what time you do it the previous day, at 8 PM the next day it's available again, not before that.
---
It shouldn't have to be nuked to be good
---
They can fix it with a hot fix type update most likely, so they‚Äôll probably have something out when they add the camera next week
---
OOF
---
My base is right across the river from there under the bridge... now all my hard work at my base has to be relocated..... :.(
---
FYI - the reason the spawn rates are likely high is due to people constantly joining and going to the area. Players cause things to spawn. They don't just spawn on their own.
---
The key with The Burrows is that it is NOT tied to a global respawn timer like other areas are. So every new person that enters for the first time means more ghoul respawns. It also means more lag and server issues.
---
When I heard that the spawns were not affected by global respawn timers I figured it would be like this. It's probably only a matter of time before it's nerfed though.
---
I'll be there tonight with my 2 accounts. One character sleeping in a bed to give me an anchor to that world, the other nuking and respawning ghouls over and over.
---
definitely. i have the same problem. was on here a couple weeks ago and they were giving out a free hat for 24h. completely forgot by the time i got home, didn't play, and ended up missing it. it would be so sweet to be able to do this from an app.
---
heck the game itself could seriously benefit from an app. atom shop and map would be musts, and it could even go as far as integration, like fallout 4's pip boy app. map updates real time, social interactions (add friend, team, message etc), perk management. there are tons of possibilities that would be huge qol improvements
---
Great point! When I posted this morning, I had no idea that nuking the area would work in the tunnels below, too.  I have a feeling this is area will be glowing yellow/green for quite some time... :)
---
**"a bunch of butt-hurt, entitled bullshit."**
---
we are called consumers, we are customers and have the right to have our voices heard about a product we purchased
---
if you dont like it, dont read it.  but dont you dare assume for one minute that anyone cares that you dont like seeing people criticize the game.  the mods can decide how they want to filter our free speech.  
---
funny thing is, i respect YOUR opinion as well.  you have the right to post this thread that basically shits on consumer rights.  
---
and who are you to decide what does or doesnt matter?
---
THAT is the most entitled comment yet.
---
OP edited original post. OP originally claimed that TSE handmade was a legacy weapon that Bethesda reinserted into the drop table specifically for the Burrows.
---
So for 10,000 caps you get 1,000,000  rounds? üò≥ü§î
---
This is true, however, it does make them drop glowing mass / hardened mass / high rad fluids and other stuff you can sell or use.
---
I did it once and enjoyed the camaraderie of having basically an entire server come together for a single goal. I didn't get any good loot but it was a fun little event.
---
Lol went back to defend the workshop... two scorchbeasts on my fusion core generator. This kid is so lucky it's his bday haha!
---
this is how it's done  l√§mp#
---
Could you remote to your computer, fire up the game and access the atom store? I have no clue if it'll work, but I thought I'd suggest it.
---
Last night I was checking out the Burrows and some asshat with power armour woke up all the ghouls I'm trying to sneak by and I died, couldn't respawn and lost 500 steel scrap that wouldn't fit in my stash. Hoping it's fixed Tuesday as well
---
good on you!!!
---
Somewhere new and profitable to be farmed is much appreciated
---
I trade quite a bit as well but you have to be careful on team requests.  Very early in the game I accepted a request and the ‚Äúteam‚Äù fast travelled and leveled my camp and then ganked me. 
---
My favorite are the people that initiate trades to either ask for your best weapon or to simply scout out your build to see if they will gank.  Thankfully it‚Äôs not often but that happens as well.
---
Well seeing how you were the only one who down voted it... and went and changed your asinine comment after the fact, which is weird.
---
Added!
---
Gank?
---
So, finished the burrows.
---
Found not the source of the music, sadly.
---
Anyone else having issues crafting PA? My x-01 disappeared after the last update and when I try to craft another I only have the option to craft level 40 now
---
howdy, i added you a couple of hours ago, gamertag Doctor_Banner
---
hooe to catch you online tomorrow, i'd like to gift a serum to a friend that has little to no time to play. will be on during afternoon on cet time, let me know if there is something i can bring in exchange other than the materials, if i can i'll get it ^^
---
But then if you play legitly and trade for stuff that didn't seem duped, at some point you come to conclusion that for PvP its beneficial to have alt between level 60 and 80 cuz its simply cheaper than your level 200+ main is, so you move the inventory to low level character and negate all the advantages that came with your higher level.
---
Oh your right, forgot about camera update since they delayed it. Crossing my fingers for it.
---
I feel your pain. People just don't want to read.
---
Huh. Thought I'd done it earlier, but mebbe not.
---
I agree. To put the icing on the cake I leveled his camp for reporting me while he helplessly watched in horror.
---
Do you not know what karma is?
---
Wow, . . . hadn't seen something like that before. That's pretty cool!
---
Basically a hazmat suit or put on Power Armor
---
Every song. I'm the guy who sings to the radio while my group is like "wtf is he doing" because they don't radio
---
Never been a fan of emotes but they‚Äôre very useful in this game.
---
There is an update coming where if you are in passive your base cannot be destroyed in adventure mode.  I think with player vending next month.
---
pure cope
---
Sorrry but seriously? 
---
It is the same as radstag or brahmin but cost more resources.
---
I'm sure they know hpw to do it, it's just everybodies a super star and no one wants to put in work. It's beneath them. 
---
None of my characters have any stellar weapons so I'm usually all over it, I can get enough tags in between pylon activations. Except for last night where 5 of is we're standing around the pylon, unable to get it to turn on. This went on for about 2 minutes, I'm not sure how it fixed itself, suddenly it was back on.
---
Step 1. Make a mule. 
---
Optional level mule for weight reduction perks.
---
Step 2. Make a friend you can trust. 
---
Bonus. You get an achievement unlocked for making a friend. 
---
Step 3. Ask them if they could transfer items for you to the mule.
---
Best part of doing this you can free up space for the heavy things and hold more lighter things like junk.
---
Also as an added bonus bulk everything metal.
---
And change out all your perk cards every time? Also no armor at all with only a hazmat suit with a low health build is pretty scary.
---
Of course! First time I felt it was hearing "the wanderer" on diamond city radio. The feel got in this game too . Such a shame I can't visit the place where the songs are being played :/
---
You havent even tried and u tell us not to judge ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You do get more powerful after level 50, because many builds are not complete until much further down the line.
---
Considering a weak point seems to double your damage (+100%) and all weapon related perk cards only boost you to +60%, I can see why they don't want you to have it right off the get go.
---
i dont know what you said but IM FURIOUS Raaaa!
---
Yeah ignore what bethesda says and hear what bethesda says.
---
I have been thinking this as well.  I really hope we see a living world.  Also think it would be cool if the entire userbase had to team up and complete a goal to get a project.  Like what if they had a mission where we have to donate wood and steel and once we reach some crazy amount they repair the train tracks and you will be able to ride the train around the map rather than fast traveling.  you could give rewards based on how much you donate.  top donor gets a unique conductors outfit or something.
---
I myself hope Bethesda recognises most of the reports for what they are: game being nonobvious and noobs being sure somethings off because "I keep shooting him and his health is just bouncing" xD
---
thing is there is no endgame and once you blew through the main story content the game just kinda ends and those piece meal updates (if you can even call them that) aren't gonna keep people logging in daily/weekly
---
Well, not really. Intestines don't drop as commonly as they used too. Finding the tiny critters is part of the trick. Also, the listed weight on it is low because I have 70% weight reduction for all food, drink and chems. 
---
So you have to hunt down a lot of tiny critters to really make a lot of this, unlike other foods. I know, I've been making sausages, which require the intestines too, and they aren't as common now that faschnatch is over.
---
The only problem is its hard to keep her supressed while tanking multiple pylons. 
---
The cyrolator has limited range and you really don't wanna be close when you're a pylon. So I'd prefer something with more range personally. If you had two people one cryolating and one tanking all the pylons that would be great
---
I do wish there was an actual radio station building, even better would be if it had robots inside maintaining it.
---
Bethesda did not say anything about finding eggs unlocking more. What's your source?
---
Please show me where I said I don‚Äôt like people to criticize the game
---
even for casuals a 10 min dungeon is super short and won't keep people playing the game
---
What about for PVP? Demo expert is good for both grenades and explosive weapons, and fireproof is pretty good at explosive stoppage power.
---
Adrenaline would be good if you're facing a squishy squad and be able to jump between kills
---
I have no idea what mean. Was cope the word you meant to use? or was it crap?
---
no pistols.. clipboards and pencils only.
---
Let's go ride bikes!
---
You should see people in a bar in West Virginia when that song comes on! You would think its the song of their people!
---
‚Äúthey turned hostile and died‚Äù. 
---
You *murderer*.
---
&gt; but areas like the Burrows kind of frustrate me for how they flaunt a good looking environment and do nothing interesting with it.
---
kinda reminds me of battle for azeroth where the art team is killing it but the gameplay team is failing hard
---
1.3 hours a day, 7 days a week is much faster than average, yes. The average gamer does not play 7 days a week, nor does the average gamer play 9.1 hours per week. So yes, you'd be playing roughly 50% "faster" than the average player at that rate.   
---
I mean, it's basic common sense. If you're playing FO76 literally every day after work since the BETA began, you must know that you're in the top percentile of people who play this game, right? You're very clearly a "power-user", not a casual player. Most gamers, even in this game, do not have this amount of spare time to spend.
---
That's because that's not how statistics work.
---
Holy smokes man! Thank you I‚Äôll give this a go!
---
As far as I know that's how it works.  I'm also not a bloodied build.
---
However,  perk cards are easy to change out as long as you've unlocked them.  Tedious but easy. 
---
If you're just farming for legendaries and experience you can always server hop Westek or a non-nuked whitesprings.
---
If it's for flux and other nuke materials then you have to make do.
---
Once the whole damage exchange goes down and you enter into combat the person with pacifist will do no damage. The person without it will.
---
When trading, I usually pay the extra caps to fast travel to a spot nearby and just walk. If its not possible, I accept, fast travel and en route just drop out of the team so I still arrive but it gives them less of a window to get to my base or set up an ambush similar to what happened to you.
---
Sing a bit of Sixteen tonnes in the deepest voice you can. That should do the trick
---
It's not, I got 3 3 star legendaries to spawn in regular
---
Yeah, I had tried it earlier in the day and was annoyed I couldn't do it, someone posted it resets after 8, tried it immediately after 8 and sure enough, gave me the daily quest.
---
Census bot is a total tank. He can damn near do that event himself. I think he's just lonely or wants an apprentice lol.
---
No I meant that is how it should be, that's not how it is. You can contest during an event which is BS
---
Maybe he should only run through Whitesprings once and move on. Sounds to me like he‚Äôs farming
---
Who downvotes this comment? Lmao
---
I agree, we need a way to access the shop if we're away from gaming computers for vacation, family, work, whatever so we don't miss out on limited time stuff.
---
Fucking Blackbird.

The best part is the box of screws, in case you weren't sure what they were doing.

Me and a buddy went through and ran into 1 random guy. Between the 3 of us we killed 5 ghouls. I'm just hoping once the newness wears off it will be a little easier to use as a farm location.
---
&gt;For those that completed it in "5 minutes", they just ran to the end, they didn't explore every tunnel and cranny that there was
---
nook and crannies aren't content tho or better said nook and crannies won't keep people playing
---
&gt;I know that I probably missed a bunch of things but people need to remember this is a start. It was a free update, enjoy it for what it currently has and be ready for what more it can bring.
---
so just because its "free" you can't criticize it? we payed 60$ (and the game even has a cash shop for skins and soon repair kits) for a half finished game they owe us this content (if you can even call it that lol)
---
We're looking into this for you guys. Thank you for the tag!
---
Should server resets be set to midnight for every timezone too?
---
His health was doing the same so I went for the head. My favorite part was when he said I'm cheating because he's better than me and I'm salty about it. Then he kicked me from the party. Who's the salty one? I told him to research pvp builds and he claimed he has. Obviously not much if he got owned in a 1 v 4 by a guy who just started pvping with guns 3 days ago.

Dependable on build u using. I use adrenaline lvl 1 only on my build
---
"No the railway rifle and the harpoon gun and the cross bow literally are not pipe weapons" 
---
You know pipe weapons are weapons that was build together with what the people had to hand. Or could be make easily. The harpoon and railway are tools which would be upgraded to use as a weapon. Like a nail gun, with enough power it could kill easily.
---
Without compensation.
---
My excavator armor has a calibrated shock on one leg and nothing on the other ... so for now I walk in circles...or you might say I get around.
---
&gt; but that they OK'd is for release instead of giving it another year of work.
---
the game should have been delayed and the wild appalachia content should have been there day one,would have saved the game from how much hate it got at release (some deserved some not)
---
Bloodied melee build here. I just jump in my xo1 with emergency protocols. I usually have some diluted rad away hotkeyed in case the rads get too high. No issues here.

---
I only knew it was there from previous Bethesda games. They did change the button though.
---
It didn't receive any, but it looks like another people in this sub got it. Maybe BGS put them out like a few other things
---
Mines got attacked today as well
---
I want to be able to make armor sets for favorites wheel. I can't favorite every armor piece to prevent accidents. :o
---
&gt; but you come off that way because you're extremely selfish and think all new content should be catered to your extreme end-game needs.
---
wanting meaningful content instead of 5 minute piece meals is "extreme end game needs" you fanboys are delusional
---
What I do is, i turn my character to the 
---
 maker on my hud, then go into the map and follow that line
---
Definitely. And nuked fluxes too üçÄüå∫
---
Yea! Be happy with bullshit! How dare you expect more than the bare minimum!
---
Damn this lack of cross-platform play.  Feel free to PM me anyway.  If you don't have a lawyer, it can be difficult to know what your options are and how to navigate the courts. You are welcome to borrow my experience.
---
It just depends on luck? I got some pretty good drops, instigating swing speed max level MMG so who knows. It‚Äôs good for exp n junk too
---
Damn homie, I‚Äôll do some Burrows with ya.
---
Yeah that was great use of passive voice.

Nah it‚Äôs typed right. It‚Äôs to better accentuate the

After the first hard G.

Trying real hard bud! Just keep at it, and you might be less of a disappointment to everyone next year!
---
Made it
---
No thanks.  The last time I joined a game with you, well...I can't say what happened, but my hat had to be thrown away afterward.
---
Both are the same.
---
Totally feel the same way!
---
You totally need to take a picture of them with the new camera so you can get those weekly challenge points....    oh wait, nevermind.
---
Nah they‚Äôre pulling your leg. üòÇüòÇ On PC they normally sell for about 2 rounds for 1 cap sometimes even 3 rounds for 1 cap.
---
Ganking -  To kill, ambush, or defeat with little effort; used in online games.
---
Just use PA or a Hazmat suit.
---
The only other option I've heard of is to run with a team and share Rad Sponge, which isn't optimal with Bloodied, but could potentially keep the rads from killing you.
---
Then maybe don't just blow through content? People are so damn obsessed with getting all of the best gear within like 3 hours after a content drop and them get upset they have nothing else to do. Just, don't? You don't *have* to no-life this game, and that's for the better. It's not the same as an MMO. I can play 76 to just chill, unlike Destiny where I have to get as high a LL as I can as fast as I can so that I can participate in good content.
---
That‚Äôs both heart warming and heart breaking. Hope RNGesus put smiles on your face üôèüèª
---
The first punch was to confirm the bug. 
---
The second punch was to confirm they could take damage. 
---
The third punch was to confirm they could die. 
---
The fourth punch was because I have too much attack speed.
---
Holy shit there is someone here that can quote the prequels!!!!
---
Never heard that before lol
---
Cool. I get off work after 8PST, so it all works for me, I guess ha.
---
Shockwave, trust me from one active account to another, this man is not the choice you want to go with. That is all.
---
I just came across this two night ago myself, and while it made me smile initially, since I always love the little easteregg "scenes" they setup with the toys in the FO games...
---
It wasn't until I saw the "loose screw" that I actually started laughing and said a mental "well played, Bethesda map makers!" lol 
---
I... really appreciate that sort of witty humor, and it was only thanks to that singular loose screw that made it such a better encounter! I mean one can take it a number of ways, after all. "Loose" in terms of being careless, or in the derogatory sense for a lady that 'gets around', with "screw" being what they're doing. OR that it's implying, in the sanity sense of the phrase, that they (or someone in the wastes who arranged them that way) is a bit of a "loose screw" or has a "screw loose". Either way, I appreciated it! :P
---
And know Beth sees it and will change it \*thumps up to the video\*
---
The whole thing sounds like a setup on par with the workshop PVP abuse.
---
Yeah it would be pretty nice
---
Same, this particular card is 1* on my builds, but the math is still such that for any of the builds I made the lowest possible level was 54, average at around 58, and maximum almost at 70.
---
Hey, you‚Äôre good.  
---
You don‚Äôt need to defend yourself, I was just kidding.
---
&gt;There is endgame content. SBQ. Sheepsquatch. Certain areas.
---
did you play a single mmo in your life? antorus the burning throne is end game content,SBQ and sheepsquatch are dungeon tier bosses and not even that
---
Yawn
---
Yes! Take all they upvotes. No matter what I'm doing when that song comes on I always sing along lol
---
Did you take a workshop ?
---
I did tbis,last week I'm level 22 lol I ran in there and grouped the ghouls up and the buff looking ones and then ran to,the robots and let them kill it then went back and grabbed the sword ... TRY IT
---
No but at least daily Challenges should be to your time zone give or take a few hours
---
Not midnight American, 3pm uk
---
Did I miss the egg for yesterday?  I picked up an egg about an hour ago from the shop?
---
Something I did?
---
My party starts singing it without fail, rules are rules.
---
I didn't notice the egg in the shop at all yesterday.
---
Im almost positive they dont charge anymore.  The certification thing is what takes so long tho.
---
From a writing point of view, Waste Management is quite different from the others you mentioned, because it is intended to be drama/horror instead of humor. I rather they didn't drag the writer from the above mentioned bots into waste management, because they're good at humor and may not be good at drama.
---
I think the biggest problem is that Burrows is a place to wander, which goes poorly with the term "dungeon," implying it's a linear adventure to be run and finished. My first run-through I didn't see a lick of story, because all the things that would have lead me to the story holos and the like were already done and I had no idea.
---
That said, I do think they could have done a better job of presenting the story, and I do rather wish they'd hire a few single job voice actors or something when they need to add different voices.
---
Put on pa amd switch a few perks around. Mine is normally DCG build but in pa I switch to one handed as perks like barbarian get replaced with gladiator for a start. While you won't do the crazy damage unyielding brings I can still murder glowing ones with a bloodied combat knife pretty quickly. If you get an over repaired bloodied ripper it'll chew through anything even without perks.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying, pipe guns are hand made weapons because is what they had available, guns like the railway rifle  should be a rifle and should be affected by gun smith which it is,, the cross bow I could get behind because the whole ‚Äúhandmade‚Äù aspect of making a cross bow, but it‚Äôs not a pipe weapon, so I feel It shouldn‚Äôt be affected by The pipe perks, the harpoon gun is a big gun  not pipe weapon ,  so they should not be affected by pipe weapon perks, I don‚Äôt see a nail gun being able to take out any target with decent armor
---
&gt; Then maybe don't just blow through content? 
---
i play since release you silly goose
---
&gt;People are so damn obsessed with getting all of the best gear within like 3 hours after a content drop and them get upset they have nothing else to do. Just, don't? 
---
youre projecting hard,this isn't even a content drop this is a 5 minute walk in the park 
---
&gt;You don't have to no-life this game, and that's for the better. 
---
again projecting on me, wanting meaningful content to do with my friends =/= no lifing the game 
---
&gt; can play 76 to just chill,
---
theres literally nothing to do after you nuke SBQ ,there no form  of progression
---
Introducing...
---
CLIPBOARD ROYALE
---
Hopefully you'll get the chance to see your kids again, it's been about 15 years since I last saw mine.
---
I think the root problem is people are assuming what the content will be before it comes out and have built up massive expectations, and then when it drops, they're left disappointed and blame Bethesda... when the only person they have to blame is themselves.
---
When small snippets of new content come out people rush to do it as fast as possible, knock it out, and then complain the 20-30 minutes of additional content wasn't enough. But it does add up over time. But I don't blame them, because people are also desperate for endgame content at the same time. 
---
Expectations and hype can really detrimental at times because it sets the stage far, far higher than it really is.
---
It's alot more common than you realize. I for one have a full set. I can also think off the top of my head 3 or 4 other people I have ran into multiple times that also have a full set. I also can recognize the signs when engaging someone. Most people are ignorant of the facts and just shout "hacker" or "cheater" or "why do I do no damage to them, and they one shot me?" For the love of pete, open your eyes man.
---
Thus is on survival mode btw. Where the real pvp happens.
---
It happens. I suffer insomnia so I make a stupid all the time. Lol!
---
I think we both know.
---
Go sit in a tree!
---
Also is "virtually no one has a full set" then why are there so many people wanting it nerfed?
---
Mate, if you had 4 ghouls on you *once* and you're calling it empty, someone finished it before you. I got swarmed repeatedly when I ran it on a quiet server.
---
No I dont. Sorry if I offended you.
---
it was cope because your entire post is coping,endgame raiders is what keep your game life they are the guys that play your game and log in daily and are more likely to spend money on your game than the guy that logs in once a month,you need the endgame raiders to keep the game alive
---
I just did, lost about 10 3* anti armor and bloodied melee weapons because my buddy‚Äôs console crashed  when I was switching to mule. Whoever picked them up enjoy!
---
This time zone is really terrible for me. Got the first egg yesterday, expected the next one to release today but it's almost tomorrow when it actually releases.
---
I got those but people are talking about getting rewards?
---
That image is a perk. You may have it equipped in Intelligence and need to remove it.
---
What happens if you find all of them? Also I‚Äôm confused on how water eggs work.
---
Yes and I can't help but sing along horribly. And I also love the ink spots so anytime one of their songs comes on I just feel so calm and happy. The radio is one of my favorite features of the game :)
---
It's like binge watching an entire season of TV and then going "That was it?"
---
It took 12-14 hours to binge it all, but the people producing the show took a year to do it. Games are no different.
---
But if I can get what I want within the 10/11 then I can put points into something else?
---
*points to your username*
---
I agree with the shotgun/enforcer people. It frankly makes it feel cheap but I haven't put in time to learn another way. 
---
To expand, once down, a few more shots will keep it from advancing or screeching. I usually switch to a gatling gun,any of sufficient level will do. Just to deal constant and sustained damage. 
---
It will heal again and start flying and screeching. Repeat the process.
---
I feel like the Imposter is easier than the SBQ, but maybe other's have a different experience?
---
What actually happens when a CAMP gets nuked?  Does it get 100% destroyed? Or is it just stuck in rad hell until the nuke zone expires?
---
This is why I stopped playing my bloodied melee build and am leveling a gunslinger build.
---
I just found out I can interact with Whitesprings vendor because I can approach them
---
Naw, I am a terrible person. Discovering this was an accident. I kill a lot of players. I suppose I could have kept this quiet though. This definitely seems like an unintentional interaction.
---
No. I really like the copilot cover of the song.
---
I don‚Äôt care for the Beach Boys and John Denver as they break my sense of immersion in Fallout, however who cares what I think. If you guys like it, rock on!
---
I'm envisioning a video game developer on the phone with the contractor that they hired for home renovations and bitching about the job quality and deadline while you were typing this.
---
I haven't even see one yet! Where do they frequent?
---
You get the wendigo from a quest that starts from reading a note on a table at the Southern Belle Motel
---
Downvote bad post, upvote apology. It all evens out.
---
You should cross-post this with r/gaming. Someone there will probably have an answer.
---
I play this game to relax from other, more challenging games.
---
Looking at you *sekiro*
---
Does demolition effect shotguns that use explosive ammo?
---
its all so in a couple years we can be sittin on the porch of our camp goin:  
---
 "you youngins dont know how hard it was back then.. no one alive round here cept them pesky protect and serves.. it took us years to get people back in here, yall got it easy now"  
---
to the new lvl 1 comin out the vault and npcs everywhere.. poor bastard slept in the vault for too long after the party.
---
I get mine at 10am which is cst. I dont know of a single game that gives rewards based on local time with group worlds.
---
Id rather they fix bugs and add playable content.
---
Demolition helps all explosive weapon  damage last I recall
---
How the hell are people getting underneathe Harper's Ferry?????? Did a new update that i didnt know about come out?????
---
I really like the edition of country roads they used in 76. John Denver is the original person who sang this song but the person who performed the song in 76, their voice fits it better than John Denver's would have. No offence to John may he rest in peace.
---
Yes. Yes I do. I bought it at release when my buddies convinced me to. I've been the biggest fallout fan since fallout 1. But this isn't fallout and now myself and all those buddies who bought it have been quite vocal about the scam artists called Bethesda
---
Perhaps it's an EU thing and if Brit politicians grew a pair....
---
My favourite part of the game is hearing Country Roads faintly on a radio in the world then tuning in on my PipBoy!!
---
That's the first egg.
---
Contractor forced to sleep in cubicle without meals for 3 weeks to get job done by hard deadline

"Pink Houses" -John Cougar Melloncamp
---
what did i expect from an apologist
---
I'm just going to add something that is really going to piss of a certain selection of players.
---
A lot of the more vocal complainers are either exaggerating or flat out lying. There's no doubt they are experiencing issues with the game. It's not a perfect game. 
---
But if you've ever worked in retail or any customer service job. The angrier a person is, the more they exaggerate or flat out lie.
---
And let's be honest. A lot of gamers put a lot of self esteem in being good at games. And when things don't go as they want, they crap their pants and have a fit. 
---
They are also the most vocal, and they fill up the reddit with their constant tantrums. Making it so much work for anyone to find useful information. Then they wonder why no one listens to them.
---
There was no update, so....
---
Use search bar. Covered many times. I think its around 7 cst
---
This is a stupid question but what are the Easter eggs for?
---
&gt; $40,000.
---
Bethesda has to pay $40,000 for every update? Where did you get this information?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I forgot I had this perk equipped, but after pressing X enough times, the game actually adjusted and gave me a third option to press Y to trade instead.  
---
But I‚Äôd just say take the card off to trade. It‚Äôs easier.
---
If you took a workshop
---
Hopefully they look forward to the point in the game when you drop fusion cores because they weigh too much, compared to lead.
---
Not sure of your playstyle but here are my critiques
---
1) Rifle Ammo does not weigh that much and you probably won't have more than a few thousand rounds of 5.56. You could invest the Bandolier points in something else.
---
2) Concentrated fire is an absolute must for me in the Perception tree. Being able to vats headshot will up your damage in both pvp and pve. Additionally the extra accuracy and damage on follow up shots is very nice.
---
3) Ironclad has always been a meh perk in my mind. If you are getting damage percentage mitigation legendaries then that DR means very little. However, those 5 points mean quite a bit elsewhere.
---
4) Ditch White Knight and put those points in adrenaline. Absotuletly the best perk for increased DPS.
---
5) No Gunfu? With an IE handmade most things will die after 1 head shot. Having the ability to cycle vats kill targets automatically and get bonus damage is nice
---
6) No Grim Reaper Sprint? Once again....lots of quick kills that can refill AP bar.
---
This x1000. Two words: stealth nerf.
---
You can, there‚Äôs only one problem- the piece that‚Äôs on the frame when you exit the frame is no longer ‚Äúin your inventory‚Äù so it gets dropped from the favorites wheel.
---
Decor.
---
&gt;Same goes for setting off a nuke
---
You can certainly run silos without getting into PA. Just needs a small amount of Rad-X + RadAway during the reactor stage, although last time I tried, the server jammed on that stage anyway. 
---
You're not going to run bloodied-optimal through the whole silo, but then silos are pretty easy so you don't need it. Rad-X wears off well before you get to the queen.
---
You are right, exactly everything else in the Wild Appalachia trailer is coming, but not that part. Just all of the rest of it. Of course. My bad. I apologize. The rest in my post, about how hard it will be... well, if you re-read my post you might find something I call humour. It is great. I will post more of it in the future. 
---
Chill brother, it is a game.
---
Oh okay. Thanks
---
Wont speak for other's but it was the 5 minute that was the problem. Any new area or location is welcome but throw something interesting in with it.
---
... or maybe r/expectedthanos?
---
Right lmao
---
I read that TSE didn't chain. Can you confirm?
---
Once I knew binoculars were in the game I had to have one. Day one of the beta, I first ran to Helvetia, thinking all 10 masks were in the game already (foolish) 2nd stop to a ranger tower because I figured that would be the most likely place to find binoculars. 
---
Of course once you get a scope on a hunting rifle it was hard to justify using them (unless it had better magnification)
---
It's ironic that just the week prior to the event I was thinking how a recon feature would bring it back to relevance. Of coursr it would be better if you could use to to mark for the group and as long as you have it in hand the others can see the tags. I haven't had friend on to check but I assume this group tagging isn't a feature.
---
It's a pretty decent size dungeon when compared with what Bethesda generally does for dungeons. 
---
What other things did they say that would lead me to believe that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting?
---
That it was "challenging"?
---
Or "Gather your squad"?
---
None of which imply anything about the environment.
---
My first solo was a double at WS golf club.  I kept waiting for someone to jump in and help.  Never happened.    Was a great feeling.   Now I just see them as an annoyance.
---
No, it's not. It was good in FO4 when it was +30% per hit up to about 250%, but now it's +5 or +10% per hit up to 30%, which is less than Bloodied would give with 3/4 health remaining.
---
I had a similar problem, I got to about level 60ish and then got into a cycle of traveling across the wasteland selling berries to all the vendors.
---
When survival came out, I starred a brand new character, and it forced me to play completely differently than before including avoiding populated areas and doing quests and exploring areas I normally zoomed by.  So far its been really enjoyable.
---
That said, I started when getting killed was very dangerous, and high levels roamed looking to kill those who survived the longest, so I invested heavily in running away and not carrying a lot of stuff.  It's less dangerous now, and I'm playing less cautious now, so it's not much different.
---
All I do during that quest is pour out alcohol. It seems not many understand how the event works still. Or are just trying to get a free ride.
---
Easter eggs are all in the shop, the next one appears at 8 eastern time tonight
---
Oh yeah? 
---
Can you link me to a quote where they directly describe the burrows as "High level, end game content"
---
Please do
---
And don't advertise it as a dungeon or something different if it's just another location with enemies in it
---
But deathclaws haven't been scary since Fallout 2.
---
Your mistake is waiting on a revive lol
---
Go away. Your opinion matters even less than the hundreds if nonsensical threads you refer to.
---
Entirely possible another player was clearing ahead of you while crouched, you don‚Äôt show on the map when crouched.
---
Dont know, TS still chain, but dont know if tse does, but if it does, its waaaay to op if the explosive goes with the chain ü§£
---
Yeah I‚Äôm level 80 and beat it in 7 min, ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù aren‚Äôt meant to be beat so easily. The silo sites (for me) are much more like dungeons and they don‚Äôt even have any real bosses. Also maybe put some effort into the boss for the burrows rather than re-skinning the assaultron and making it deal massive damage Like you did with the sheepsquatch event (at least there was some amount of game mechanics in that fight).
---
My point is if you are going to advertise it as a dungeon, add more objectives, make more unique bosses, and (in my opinion) make it so that only you and your team can go in together in a separate instance than other people in server. I don‚Äôt like doing the entire quest with me only having to fight one ghoul to get to the boss because of how many people are already down there.
---
They are xenomorphic facehugging deathclaws.
---
&gt;Are the players in the event always stupid as fuck
---
75% yes. They just constantly shoot the invisible creature even though it is clearly not taking any damage.
---
I meant I didn't even know where to go, like where the sewer entrances even were. But I figured it out last night, thanks.
---
thanks! TIL
---
Thank you for spoilering the award. Unlike the other who just blurted it out in the title. You really should have been upvoted instead.
---
Difficulty is largely an personal experience. 
---
A naked level 20 wouldn't be able to mow through the several legendaries I encountered there on my first forray there.
---
Or even a small swarm of Gutsys. Which are actually my weakness. They tear through me in groups.
---
No, I was in an area for one of the sheepsquatch side quests
---
I feel your pain, learned a hard lesson today as well, stash box was full so i had my wife carry 50+ of different stable fluxes, went and took workshop and here comes a lvl 237 contesting us, we didn't even have time to turn pacifist off and he got all of it. I guess hard lessons don't come cheap.
---
Or a deathclaw to protect the home. Like a dog but than a bit bigger
---
Dam dude.... How many lamps do have on you???
---
Wait... so you get the egg from the atomic shop and then you have to find it? I‚Äôm confused
---
Software programmer forced to work in 98 degree weather for 3 weeks without meals would probably speed up the process.
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of healing factor personally so without that, you can save 3 pts on luck for lessening the impact of mutations Bc the others aren‚Äôt that bad (imho of course).
---
Also double repair strength can counter the need for 5 pts in gunsmith.  To me that‚Äôs a QOL perk moreso than a run with it perk, at higher levels.  Naturally related to what your gun costs to repair.  As a non mainline PA user I don‚Äôt need springs like they‚Äôre going out of style.
---
You want fries with that?
---
After 3 scribes didn‚Äôt return from their mission, don‚Äôt you think they would have sent some knights with a paladin. Only reason not to is because their to busy trying to save Appalachia from the Scorched.
---
I can‚Äôt help it if you‚Äôre not very good
---
No,  I did not. I was doing one of the two new sidequests
---
Well if they hatch it's the ultimate Death Claw farm since they're billable in camp mode
---
x10000 plus power of a million TROLLS
---
Oh I know that is a possibility, still I was checking the map pretty consistently to see if anyone popped up. Now, I'm not discounting they were crouched the whole time and crouch-walked away, but I thought I'd let people know either way.
---
Make a new too , equip only scribe clothes, use laser pistol and travel on foot all the way there from BOS base then kill everything inside.
---
Glad to hear it was a fun experience! I mistakingly said on our stream today that nukes didn't change the dungeon and came in here to correct myself- so really happy to see others have been doing it!
---
No you don't. Just collect it from the shop everyday. If you collect all 6, you get a mystery item on the 7th.
---
They said it multiple times and teased us on wether we‚Äôre up to the challenge. I‚Äôm not wasting my time going through ITV articles and looking for cm responses you can do that yourself
---
I have six of the purifiers. I can hang around my CAMP for half an hour  and one will have 3, another will have 1, a third will have none. They dont produce in any rational sense.
---
I run around the event reviving players

---
 &gt; Glad to hear it was a fun experience! I mistakingly said on our stream today that nukes didn't change the dungeon and came in here to correct myself- ...
---
Then it‚Äôs not normal, but maybe a stray bullet hit him and they reacted with well more bullets, we asked if you claimed a workshop because it‚Äôs not un common for people to show up to the workshop owners location after initiating the claim on the workshop opening you up to pvp
---
Oh you just collect them *from* the shop.
---
No need to apologize. Find something else to do with your time.
---
Pacifist doesn‚Äôt protect against this. I was testing a ton of other stuff related to Slap damage during patch 6, and did some side testing related to ‚Äúforced‚Äù PvP. Another player clued me in to the ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù exception and yeah, it doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre in Pacifist mode or not. Or at least it didn‚Äôt in patch 6. I‚Äôd link the write up I did but it‚Äôs mostly irrelevant now with the removal of slap damage.
---
Seeing as it wasn‚Äôt challenging and they also suggested you needed to gather your squad because it would be tough solo yeah I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs misleading. I think they just had no idea how tough it would actually be for most players. Calm yourself
---
only played fo4 myself but i was doing the burrows line and the two other cryptid side quests with a couple friends and one was rushing through terminals getting the next map pip within seconds then running off to the point telling us to hurry up, giving the follow emote and im sittin there on terminals reading every single line and every entry.
---
i wanna know their thoughts, i wanna know what they go through, just rushing through to get a pip marker with no back story just not for me.
---
My post? This isn't my post. Endgame raiding might have been a thing for other games, in the past. But not so much anymore. 
---
Endgame raiding turned out to be a deadend way of doing things, because people just got tired of bosses that were literally programmed to be unbeatable, just to keep players thinking they could win. 
---
Casual gamers are the bigger audience, not raiders. Sorry, you don't like that things have changed. Maybe you can try to cope.
---
Most players don't bother and if you're noticing that you're doing most of the work it's better to start that load screen back up
---
You want to try being original? Oh you can't. Haters can't be original.
---
how do you do this?
---
Oh my, a glowing behemoth? I‚Äôm jealous! I want to see that model!
---
It wasn't even advertised really.   That one from the video is under arktos pharma.  I just saw this as a bonus thrown in.
---
Agreed. People have ‚Äúgood‚Äù weapons and armour and think ‚Äúme hit, me gud‚Äù and that‚Äôs just not how that event works.
---
&gt;So I‚Äôm just treating it like any other fallout
---
thing is other fallouts have replayability and things to keep me busy,from alternative to playthroughs to  meaningful side quests 
---
this game is a one and done experience once you get to level 50 and finish the enclave questline and nuke SBQ the game just kinda abruptly ends and there isn't much to do  
---
&gt;Well any game is boring when you mash through it, right?
---
i can rush through fallout 2 or new vegas and still have a great time with plenty of content to do after finishing the main quest or alternative playthrough theres none of that here 
---
truth is the game is half baked and has no meaningful end game to keep players engaged  and those 5 minute piece meals once a month won't save the game or make people log in daily/weekly to play your game
---
 Yeah. Some of us don't really take explosive damage you understand. ;)
---
You forgot to add the posts where people complain about other people complaining, who's the entitled one here again? People have a right to gripe if they should so choose, the mods aren't doing their job if there are 8,000 posts about the same issue running rampant on this sub. BTW repair kits are not Pay to win, only Youtubers looking for clicks kept that issue alive and flammable for a good week, Blame them for that one. Complaining about others complaining isn't going to stop the "Trash Posts", it only adds to the pile...
---
&gt;&gt; Then maybe don't just blow through content? 
---
&gt;i play since release you silly goose
---
And I've played since beta. Still haven't launched a nuke yet. 
---
&gt;&gt;People are so damn obsessed with getting all of the best gear within like 3 hours after a content drop and them get upset they have nothing else to do. Just, don't? 
---
&gt;youre projecting hard,this isn't even a content drop this is a 5 minute walk in the park 
---
Do you know what projecting is? I *haven't even launched a nuke in 250 hours of play*. How can *I* be the one who's concerned with getting to the endgame?
---
Also, "walk in the park" is subjective, especially considering it wasn't balanced specifically for someone who's been playing since release. And it also wasn't the only added piece of content. There were more quests added. But I guess since they don't take hours to complete they don't count either. 
---
&gt;&gt;You don't have to no-life this game, and that's for the better. 
---
&gt;again projecting on me, wanting meaningful content to do with my friends =/= no lifing the game 
---
Again, do you know what projecting is? I never said that *you* wanted to no-life it, I said that people want to have something new to do in the endgame at all times when that's not possible in this game. And "meaningful" is ***extremely*** subjective. I bet some people absolutely loved the dungeon. 
---
&gt;&gt; can play 76 to just chill,
---
&gt;theres literally nothing to do after you nuke SBQ ,there no form  of progression
---
Lol what. Just being in the world is something to do. You didn't like that, okay. But there's not "nothing" to do. I grind for resources, craft CAMP stuff, work on challenges for Atoms for more cool CAMP stuff. Oh, they added four new quests along with the new Lying Lowe questline? Well, I could sit here and knock them all out in one night, but why? What benefit does that give me? Why would I burn through every quest instantly? Just because it's there?
---
And in Fallout 3's base game there's nothing to do after you use the GECK, or in NV after you fight the Battle of Hoover Dam. It's almost like this is a Fallout game.
---
They don't teach much history in school any more do they?
---
Should have sent him to Poseidon. I clear the event and start up the generator all the time then leave it unlocked for whoever needs them as I do not use power armor. I usually have a pip boy cutout point at it too.
---
???? if you continue playing there is almost no way you wont reach higher levels.
---
who says I'm an apologist? Why is all you haters are exactly the same? You all say the same things. I mean, it's so pathetic. It's hilarious.
---
That might not be true for shotguns. Rumor is that you actually get the +20% explosive damage per pellet, and so Demo Expert would be far more valuable than the pip-boy numbers suggest.
---
I'd test it but I don't have an explosive shotgun.
---
Haha, yeah. I just don't like how people are so quick to downvote over little things :) That's reddit though for ya!
---
It speaks of the set it and forget it automated nature of both the challenges and the atom shop. Sure, they were programmed by a person, but they‚Äôre just ticking along, doing their job whilst humans work on this delayed stuff.
---
no it's anyone who's not on Bethesda's time zone. I mean at least give us our daily challenges, the things that do no effect others at midnight of whatever time zone your in, I would understand give or take a few hours but still 12?
---
No need to bring anything. Happy to help. Though it‚Äôs possible I won‚Äôt be on again until Friday early evening. Like 4p CDT.
---
Can you quote where I said anything about the entire community?
---
&gt; Endgame raiding turned out to be a deadend way of doing things, because people just got tired of bosses that were literally programmed to be unbeatable, just to keep players thinking they could win.
---
yeah you didn't play a mmorpg 
---
&gt;Casual gamers are the bigger audience, not raiders. Sorry, you don't like that things have changed. Maybe you can try to cope.
---
yeah...no lol
---
I found one of those too, but somewhere else, I don't  remember. It looks like they are Rocket Sixty Nining...
---
Yeah the timezone is rough, I know I can get it in the afternoon, but still paranoid I'll miss it. I want my 7th day surprise goddamnit üòÇüòÇ
---
Woah man those are huge. I bet they‚Äôd have an impact on your budget.
---
And melee damage? Lol it's not like I didn't try other things first.
---
This is exactly how I'm doing it, and how I did Elder Scrolls online. Playing alone in a crowd. I just started a couple of weeks ago and am thoroughly enjoying being in the Fallout world again. So I'm taking my time and enjoying it. I think I'm level 24 now.
---
someone posted in another thread the egg(s) will change out about 8pm. 
---
I didn't catch the time zone.
---
Design, implementation and sustainability are three distinct things.
---
Design to your heart's content.
---
It was so frustrating, I was taking all the pillars and getting one shot. No teamwork at all
---
What's more annoying at this point, the fact the challenges were left in or the posts every single day whining about it?
---
The mod items still do not work. No solutions available and no time frame for an update to it.
---
Not too helpful considering there's a lot of railroad vendors and I haven't even discovered half the map yet. But better than nothing.
---
Can you imagine one of those 20 tall stacks of eggs folks are building hatching in unison. Like a volcano of yolk and claws.
---
I know, it's like they plan to add more stuff later.  It's been 4 months!  How long do they honestly expect people to keep playing a fallout game?  You beat it and move on.
---
/s  (I'm new, did I do that right?)
---
I‚Äôve found 3 shocks, 2 stealthboys (lost one to a server crash while muling junk :( ), and 2 jet packs. But I‚Äôve been playing since Beta and did some heavy server hopping one week to grab the shocks. I still check the vendor most anytime I‚Äôm in the area (my main‚Äôs CAMP is on the cliff nearby) and snag any useful mods for x-01 or scout armor.
---
7th day surprise ... Deathclaw knocks on your door and ask her eggs back /s
---
Awesome! Thanks for telling dude!
---
It‚Äôs true. Video proof from riflegaming
---
I remember they said something like when you ‚Äòreroll‚Äô, the higher stars your scrapped item is, the more likely you can get your desired effect. So it basically means shuffling of the stars, and some of the stars might fit your need. I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs just the 2nd and 3rd star, or you can reroll the first star as well. If not, one star items aren‚Äôt useful for reroll. My stalkers rolling pin will never turn into a nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Gangsta Deathclaw: Where ma eggs, Playboy!
---
We're planning to release patch 8.5 next week, and it currently includes a fix for being unable to mod Power Armor and weapons!
---
Maybe they will do something like if they release a fallout 76 pip boy app or something lol

I think the real problem is how Bethesda presented the burrows as a high level, difficult dungeon instead of what it really is: a high level farm zone. If they had told us that they are adding just a new location that is great for farming and makes for a great nuke zone then there would not be outrage. Fasnacht worked well because Bethesda told us exactly what to expect. The burrows is the exact opposite.
---
I have blocker 2, IIRC. I also have serendipity 1, Ironclad 2.
---
It‚Äôs nothing great, but it allows me to take a hit without dying and gives me a chance to retreat and heal. Serendipity and Ironclad don‚Äôt work with PA though.
---
Just all the holotapes and notes cordoned off in a separate menu like Fallout 3/NV, please
---
Marketing, design are one part, customer service isn't, why build an element of a game which has been neglected for too long, look at the sheer number of complaints since January and Bethesda have done NOTHING. The month of May is fast approaching and still NOTHING. FACT.
---
Come to think of it.. I did want to build a tent for my summer terrace! :D
---
I'm jealous, my camp is practically a Mothman shrine and I can't get him to come by for the life of me.
---
I wouldn't trust my Mrs. You sir either have an ace GF or are trusting af.
---
&gt; And I've played since beta. Still haven't launched a nuke yet.
---
genuinely curious wtf have you been doing lol
---
&gt;And it also wasn't the only added piece of content. There were more quests added. But I guess since they don't take hours to complete they don't count either.
---
you literally can do the dungeon + the quests in 15 minutes 
---
&gt;Also, "walk in the park" is subjective, especially considering it wasn't balanced specifically for someone who's been playing since release.
---
you have multiple people confirming its not a challenge the slightest
---
&gt;I bet some people absolutely loved the dungeon.
---
some people think that metallica is better than iron maiden whats your point?  
---
&gt;I grind for resources
---
i have 100 flux of each type,15k ultracite 5.56 (and a lot of other ultracite ammo types) been there done that
---
&gt;craft CAMP stuff
---
okay 
---
&gt;And in Fallout 3's base game there's nothing to do after you use the GECK, or in NV after you fight the Battle of Hoover Dam. It's almost like this is a Fallout game.
---
fallout 3 and NV have replayability,meaningful side quests , interesting NPCS
---
i love fallout 76 but this isn't a normal fallout game
---
The real endgame material.
---
Awesome this is great news!
---
You can't find 2 minutes in a 24 hour period to log into the startup screen to claim it?  (serious question).
---
I understand forgetting to look or that there's something there to grab, I'm guilty of that too, but it's not like it takes all that much time to get to the first screen and click a few times.
---
True. Plus, they'd probably be decked out in radiation gear and other stuff, allowing them to possibly survive the ghoul hordes a bit better. But the numbers of charred ghouls probably would have overwhelmed them.
---
This would be amazing and a mobile way to earn points too maybe from fallout shelter? It would just be nice to do daily‚Äôs and weekly when I can‚Äôt physically get on my computer
---
definitely a hater after playing the game for 150 hours,whatever helps you sleep at night man
---
I'd love a legendary drill that panicked robots and sent them fleeing
---
Your clones are a very impressive. You must be very proud.
---
I'd bloody love it if a clutch of deathclaws hatched in my base. That would be amazing!!!.
---
ouch, that's pretty much when i have to be at work every day :( well, still grateful that people like you are around hope to catch you sometime in the future!
---
Nice! I didnt even realize Poseidon had one. Thanks man!
---
just revisionist propaganda unfortunately, but hey- SPORTS!!! sports are more  important than mathematics or science or history!
---
a bit off topic, but does 'bulking' junk save on weight? If not, whats the advantage?
---
I remember seeing posts from a few months back complaining that bulk was not helpful on cutting down on weight.
---
Just curious...
---
Again? You underestimate the dedication to being salty that reddit has.
---
That is correct.
---
hmmm...someone in anothr thread said they punched one of the eggs...and is started bleeding...so yea, you idead would be an "easter egg" 
---
Puts a whole new spin on the Kinder Eggs concept... :)
---
I really don't see the Brotherhood that way, having played the games since the original, in real-time as they were released. The Brotherhood of Steel has basically evolved, and splintered. 
---
In Fallout 1 and 2, the Brotherhood largely kept themselves locked away in the Lost Hills bunker with a few excursions and some trade deals, but they weren't a huge factor, staying out of the way and just keeping as much functional tech as they could.
---
In Fallout: New Vegas, we see a Brotherhood that's actually gotten into some fights with outside groups like the NCR and the Legion, because the NCR had become powerful enough to start trying to control those things the Brotherhood felt shouldn't be in the hands of anyone else. They were largely fighting a holding action, up through the conflict with the Legion and NCR that ends the game.
---
In Fallout 3, we're introduced to a whole other side of the Brotherhood,  where Lyons and his faction decide they're going to purge the Capitol Wasteland of super mutants and work to protect surviving humans, but the die-hard "OG" Brotherhood members split off and became the Brotherhood Outcasts despite being the ones that stuck most rigidly to the insular nature of the Brotherhood. 
---
Fallout 4's Brotherhood of Steel comes the closest to what you describe, but there's a lot of nuance involved there due to what happened with Lyons' faction after the events of Fallout 3. With Elder Lyons and his daughter both dead, and the years of fighting around the Capital Wasteland having worn away at the order, the faction had become a lot more militant. They were still rational though, but mostly a result of the Maxson cult of personality at that point. 
---
In  Fallout 76, we're dealing with completely different faction. Taggerdy's group had no physical connection to the original founders back west, whereas the other east coast factions were direct descendants. I would argue that Taggerdy's Brotherhood of Steel is closer in nature to Lyons' splinter group than anything else, particularly at the end.
---
I've got some. What platform are you on?
---
Reviving isn't needed if no one is doing it.  You spawn right outside.  I only stick around dead if I'm a conduit.  You can still channel while waiting on revival.
---
I try to revive for the achievements though.
---
Been there. Itll be a year next week since ive seen my daughter. Not thinking about it and immersing yourself in a game definitely helped me
---
Good for them, that's awesome. It's been decades since I've had that amount of free time without something snowballing into a problem from lack of attention on my part, whether it's the laundry getting out of control or the yard needing work or the kids' homework needs.
---
There‚Äôs a gourd on the table in whitespring, same room as grants sword or close to it if memory serves.  That‚Äôs always the one I first pick up.
---
I got an external SSD for my xbox because the load times were so long-my brother and I play together, and he would be done loading, wandering around, and I'd still be waiting for the game to load.  You can get a 250GB ssd for really cheap (you don't need a high end drive, it will mostly be reading, not writing,) and a USB 3 enclosure for less than $10.  (Xbox says it has a lower limit of 256GB for external drives, I don't know about PS4.) 
---
Most games it probably won't make a huge difference, but it cuts load times quite a bit in 76.
---
Every. Damn. Time !   I stop what I'm doing and start dancing.
---
YES, I can only play during the weekends, and some Thursday nights due to work.
---
People love to shoot the messenger hence why he requests we escort him through the wastelands.
---
The first one was at that time simply because that's when they switched the burrows on. Every other one will be at the usual time they switch them out. Should be out in about 4 hours
---
It's a bug with applying a pre-built mod to anything, not just PA ones.
---
good points!
---
Destiny 2 went the opposite way and had drip-feed mission spread out timegated over weeks...also annoying!
---
i guess its a fine line for a game company when they do "games as a service"
---
Red-Eye did, certainly.
---
Haha. Solid response! 10/10
---
A shit ton of stuff is ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù by this sub that usnt proven ie: food spoilage time.
---
i could post a "my life sucks right now" post too.  just like the multiples i have seen.  i too could link fo76 to my life's problems too.  why do these ridiculous post get so many upvotes?
---
bleeding hearts!    pffffffffffft
---
Don't get got.....
---
Seriously, shouldn't happen but the other guy got the drop on you somehow. He set up, identified the opportunity and pulled the trigger. He should be rewarded, huh?
---
At least he didn't have the ghoulish perk and eat your remains.
---
If Arktos difficulty is through the roof, I think the hardcores of the hardcore would love it. The reason why the sheepsquatch imposter was "too hard" is because you are in a relatively open area with a boss that straight up one shots people. Getting a dungeon that is super difficult as in tons of enemies that are dug in (like supermutants) that can kill a high end player in 3-4 hits would probably be optimal.
---
It's just my opinion I mean it's expired food that I mean.
---
Wrong sub
---
agreed, it would not have been a problem if Bethesda has not told us about him yet and we hadn't been saving legendary stuff
---
Same thing happened to me on xbox about two weeks ago. I haven't played since. 
---
It was a "friend" of mine... or so I thought. Offered to buy some of my junk. I was low on caps and I'm a nice person so I got off a game I was playing (foNewVegas) and hopped on 76. Get over there, he invites me to party, which I accept because we were "friends" right? Immediately after I get the stuff from my stash, this other guy tags him, he gets into PVP which negates my Pacifist mode, and they kill me. They get 76 caps off of me and ALL my junk. I was like "what the fuck" And they only say "Can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"
---
Like... what the fuck! I gave him free shit yesterday. I literally would have given it to him again, for free, because i'm a nice fucking person. 
---
Totally ruined my enjoyment of the game. Made it to where I can't trust even my "friends". 
---
Some xbox players are just... shit.
---
I‚Äôve been using fallout, dayz, and division 2 to alleviate and distract me from being depressed. I miss my mom.
---
They are! That's why they bully online. They can't do it in person.
---
Excellent points, all. I'd never really seen the FO3 Outcasts in the "one true church" light; always kind of imagined them as whiny take-my-ball-and-go-home heretics. Thanks for the new perspective; I'm going to have to cogitate on that one for a while.
---
The daily challenges are a tad ridiculous the way they're implemented. Warframe recently added a system of daily/weekly/weekly Elite challenges, and it's much a much better implementation
---
Daily: something that you grind out in a short amount of playtime
---
Weekly: something specific that requires specific actions to be completed
---
Weekly Elite: Same as weekly, only harder.
---
For example, the daily might be to kill 150 enemies with a specific weapon type, the weekly might be to complete 3 missions of a specific type, and the elite weekly would be something like completing the daily high level mission series 3 times in a week.
---
Ghoulish just heals you if you take rad damage
---
The fact that the challenges were left in. It speaks to a lack of care about the quality of their product. The number of other persistent bugs that still exist and have existed since BETA only enhances that impression. 
---
Excavator PA mods not being labeled. Scout armor mods being poorly labeled and half of them being unusable. Gatling gun sight is still fucked. Heavy autogrenade barrel mod does nothing more than the long barrel mod, but says it increases damage. Explosive vents don‚Äôt work. Strange in Numbers perk is still broken. I‚Äôve heard the prime receiver mod for the combat rifle changes the ammo type to .44 prime? But doesn‚Äôt give you the recipe for .44prime ammo? I haven‚Äôt confirmed that one. 
---
Energy weapons still not working with any armor piercing. 
---
Camp search/spotlights still randomly stop working. 
---
Targeting sensors for helmets randomly stop working. 
---
Nuke-quantum grenades still have an explosion radius that‚Äôs about 2ft across. 
---
MIRV grenades/mininukes are still pretty fucked (they barely spread at all, and they vanish when they split).
---
There‚Äôs a ton more I can‚Äôt recall right now, I‚Äôve honestly gotten used to and thus ignore so many bugs it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I bet he taught mr.  messenger like how to reach his inner power.
---
You shouldn't automatically be tagged PVP because your teammate gets tagged. Sometimes your teammate is a fucking idiot (or a douchecanoe) and there isn't shit you can do about it. It's a god damn loophole that bethesda needs to fix!
---
I can drop a few for you, I had some help earlier so I'll pay it forward. In-game name is "Hoon"
---
Because Bethesda

True, it would be easy but I work away from home, sometime's I'm away for up to 4 weeks at a time. I'm sure there are others like me.
---
Ive only seen my first mothman yesterday thanks to the lighthouse event while this guy finding two at once
---
I saw a post about it, I mean he didn‚Äôt really back it up with it was either a death claw nest or sheepsquatch but he did say he heard like a screech and saw some thorns. Also me and my friends have been hearing a lot more screams then what has been usual since the sheepsqautch update
---
You read a lot of that into the announcement (I did too, at least at first).  I agree that it would have been 'better' if it were something different, but if you go back and really read what they posted without any expectations driving your interpretation, they *at most* slightly exaggerated a bit of it.
---
Not op, but no, I can‚Äôt.  I travel for work every week.  Even this week, which is a short week because of Easter, I won‚Äôt get home until 9pm EDT, which is too late for the first egg.  
---
I only had two days to play fasnacht before it disappeared, and I kinda really wanted those decorations.
---
If you own a workshop you are vulnerable to pvp , no slap warning, even if you are not near the workshop
---
I just sold a chest plan for 10k caps, fyi.
---
One death understandable, over and over again is ridiculous. Obviously something is wrong with my characters stats weapons or there a feature/ mecanic that I'm not getting
---
Thanks akt üôÇ
---
I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe
---
Plus the Rads don‚Äôt effect the Burrows during a nuke. So you just have to run to the sewer entrance and then you can wear your normal armor.
---
Most of the stories you'll find on it are several years old so it's hard to get anything concrete on the current cost.  They've loosened up since the pricing was more meant to squeeze AAA devs and caused a lot of friction with indies, but there's still some sort of cost plus a waiting period between when the devs submit and the consoles actually review everything and give them the green light to patch.

There's really no way to give permanency to a game like Fallout 76, without a \*completely\* different kind of world than anyone has ever developed for a multiplayer game. Probably the closest I can imagine is something like Star Wars: Galaxies (RIP) that had persistent player housing, but you just can't do that in the context of Fallout. If we had any kind of reasonable permanency, West Virginia would have been entirely pacified hundreds of times over by now. 
---
What you need to do is look at Fallout 76 as a framework for stories. Not all of those stories are ones you're going to like, but we have no idea how much the world is going to evolve over time. We have a blank slate for Bethesda to build on, and they're building it for us. We just need to hope they do it well enough to make up for some \*huge\* mistakes.
---
In practically every pay-to-win game, you get some of the secondary currency in game and are incentivized to buy more. That‚Äôs how they get you hooked on the gameplay loop and make you want to buy them.
---
So you guys at Bethesda are happy overall with the result of this "dungeon" release?
---
Are you really sure it's not because of Junker?
---
Ok, keep me in mind. I have an X-01 jetpack if you are interested, and I can even build a high quality torso and attach it.
---
I still want to hear Dido‚Äôs the wanderer. I miss it.

Yep. It will be all new, because it's a different Bethesda account.

Nope. Right sub. It has a trading flair. You're in the wrong post mate.
---
You get downvoted from people who dont play the game, and the only way to feel good about themselves is pressing the downvote button. That's one explanation.

In FO76, they're remnants of the US Military after the single largest extinction event humanity has ever faced with literal untold amounts of destruction. They are dealing with mutated Apex predators and rogue factions that no one has ever seen before and they feel like they're the only ones who can stop it, which is fair. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there is a holotape that gives a pretty good idea about the relationship between them and the Responders where it's stated explicitly that they need to try and convince them to give them supplies but NOT TO START A FIGHT. They know the role they have to play to protect everyone, and they do so willingly giving their lives in the process. I think that's a clear picture. 
---
In FO3, they see themselves as heroes, the only with one the technology and training to save everyone. They still safeguard technology and their secrets, but aren't above going out of their way to help the common wastelander. 
---
In FO4 this faction makes the most sense to me. Or at least how they came to be the way they are. If I'm not mistaken, Elder Maxom was a child in FO3 who barely escaped the destruction in the capital. As a child, watching your friends and family give their lives for a thankless wasteland will give you some hard opinions on things. He watched his brothers and sisters in arms throw their lives away and no one cared or thanked the BOS, so yeah he's going to be a bit of a cold shoulder to most wastelanders. 
---
He wants to kill all the super mutants? Well yeah, I mean we've seen maybe two or three instances of them not being extremely violent towards humans and those are RARE cases. I don't agree with his hate boner view, but I GET IT. 
---
Same goes for ghouls, the vast majority are feral or in DANGER of going feral. Again, a hard stance to take that I don't fully agree with, but I get it. 
---
Synths are a tough subject, I guess this would depend on someone's view as an organic machine being an actual living thing or not. 
---
The FO4 version of them is probably my least favorite version, but that doesn't mean I hate them. The BOS will always be my go to faction, they are normally the best hope for the wasteland and as the games have shown us it's all about their leadership.
---
Open a Bethesda support ticket.  Reddit mentions get no response other than commiserations from the peanut gallery.
---
They definitely could have done more, but what's the impact of something like watching Abbie die, when the same event happens for thousands upon thousands of players? That's the fundamental problem of online RPGs, how long can you go through a cycle of having X event take place, and then respawn/reload ten minutes later without it feeling just as weak as what people are complaining about now?  Not long, IMO.
---
I think the biggest "script flip" in 76 is basically the fact that everyone \*is\* dead and that the world is ours and ours alone, aside from the occasional insane AI or robot.
---
Except they already tweaked huge amounts to reduce the godmode region - perk bonuses are massively nerfed compared to 4, even before you consider the finite number available. Sneak attack bonuses peaking at around 3x instead of 10x, for instance. They clearly tried to make it more challenging, then advertise this as challenging - and then it's nothing.
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt cap your strength at 11, it just sets your minimum base strength to that. I‚Äôm pretty sure negatives from mutations etc will still lower it (yeah, shouldn‚Äôt happen, but...) and any positives you have over that raise it. So if you have 15str, and put on PA, you still have 15. If you have a motion-assist torso, it would add 2 str so you‚Äôd have 17str. I‚Äôm 98% sure that‚Äôs how it works anyway.
---
Exactly! Its a good area for those that dont wish to be irradiated 24/7 in power armor. Could also provide an area to scrap things while not gettin 28 rads a second moving ina hurry.
---
Is cosmetic only so who cares tbh, if we lose out on atoms, they should change the challenge to something doable, but they shouldn‚Äôt give them out for compensation, they‚Äôre only cosmetic
---
Ok I just tested my carryweight with and without power armor. 
---
I'm lvl 170 with 15 strength.  I took off all my armor and perk cards....and now I lost my marsupial because I took off all my perk cards and forgot üò£...so no bonuses to carry weight at all...
---
My current naked and raw carry weight is 225. My health is 100% and wielding a max lvl 200% repaired bloodied machete with swing speed, sacrificial blade and END gives me a damage of 111. I currently have rad worms. I am using adrenal, electrically charged, grounded and speed demon (since I wasnt thinking and just lost marsupial and scaly) ....
---
In a full set of unmodded Xo1...I retract my original comment, I think....carry weight is unchanged at 225 and weapon dps is 111...
---
Everything I know doesnt make sense now. To my knowledge (which is now in question) PA was only better for perception builds. 
---
Also, if anyone would help a guy out who lost marsupial and scaly in the name of science üò™üò™
---
Unless it came with really good rewards (actually good, not just a chance for legendary), I would just server hop when it popped up, or take off all my gear and run straight for it and just die to end the event.
---
Possibly. I don't really care. It's more just me having a laugh at the few. Started the post with -2 and it's like smh, I didn't even do nothing! Haha
---
Damn you guys are kidding yourselves. I explored literally every area and killed every enemy and the whole thing took me 30 minutes max
---
You don't need "all perk cards" to have a good build, if you're specifically picking cards for a given build as you level up, or if you bank perk cards specifically to unlock specific cards at 50. I had the build I wanted by 70, and 15 of that was shifting perks around, and the other 5 was to unlock the last few shotgun damage perk cards, because I happened to get a good shotgun drop. 
---
At level 50, you stop getting more HP. you stop getting more stat points. you stop getting _anything but more perk cards_. 
---
There is absolutely _zero_ reason why you _can't_ have a god-tier build at level 50. Most people don't, but you _can_. 
---
You can use every item in the game. You can trade for specific item pieces you want. You can have the exact perk card load out, mutation list, and gear for a god tier build and do _exactly_ the same damage as a level 350 character, with the same build. 
---
If you _choose_ to limit yourself to only looted gear, then yes, you will _never_ have a god-tier build at 50, or any other level, most likely. 
---
Level 50 game content is end game, based on how the _game mechanics actually fucking work_.
---
How do you open a ticket?
---
As far as downvoting is concerned they're probably the same people that run around destroying people's camps. They're so unhappy that they have to spread unhappiness, Unfortunately that is all they have in their lives..

Junker doesn't want his serfs playing FO76.
---
How many time u guys need help defeating nazis?
---
Hey guys are You looking for more building personal ? I‚Äôve been doing the same and I charge between 5 and 10k  but I only do it if people like my work while in the game ( don‚Äôt advertise at all ) . I‚Äôve only had 11 paid customers and another 6 I did for free for my friends . Feel free to contact me thru Live my GT is Rainmaker TT and maybe You like how I build.
---
Yeah you're kinda boned in that case.  I'm not really sure why they can't just assign free items instead of making people collect them.
---
You're a pretty small minority though, it's not terribly difficult to understand how people like you got overlooked in the way they handle things.  Have you tried contacting BGS for feedback?  I think there's a idea/suggestion type spot in their reporting system.
---
sooooooooooooo why dont you play in survival mode?
---
you go around in adventure mode griefing players houses by destroying them just to start a fight?
---
i'm afraid everything i can think of to type about this is derogatory and riddled with expletives.
---
For real. Sometimes I just wanna say no thanks without it looking like I'm a merciless king damning them to their death.

I believe we are the best and the brightest from Vault 76. It is our duty to improve the world and the lives of other humans in it. Good work üëç.

Probably just the randomness of the game. Sometimes I don't get any legendaries.
---
ima make an omelette.
---
Thanks! Question: are the purely decorative?
---
Or why cant we get credit using our existing cameras? Makes 0 sense.
---
So it will be 2 weeks in total that modding weapons and armour hasn't been possible!?  Must have been a real nasty bug to fix if its taking that long to fix because if this was my game I'd definitely want to get one rolled out ASAP for a feature this big.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I could send you a file to replace a song in your game with The Wanderer. My radio has quite a few older songs I added back.
---
Looks like you are going to be pausing to eat and drink .... a lot.  
---
(You have no perks for food spoilage, nor are you cannibal.)
---
There is alos a C perk to force your opponent to take an additional 5% damage.  cant recall its name...might be usefull for melee.
---
Possibly, but considering how many places we can find dead scribes all over, the Knights would have a lot of following up to do after saving Appalachia.
---
I don't think it was sexist... Just throwing my worthless opinion out there. You're taking it too seriously.
---
They killed a whooooooooole lot of people, the only difference is that they built synths to carry the guns and pull the trigger instead of pulling it directly most of the time.
---
It took me months with multiple chars running it to get a full set without relying on glitches.
---
How do I open a ticket? The Bethesda support page is blank
---
Honestly, I love both versions! John‚Äôs is classic, but the copilot cover just sounds deeper, and more full of soul. They‚Äôre both very different, and great in different ways.
---
That's your chosen play style. I'm speaking to game play mechanics, when looking at what you unlock as you level. 
---
Any level 50 character can, with the right card choices, purchased gear, and mutations, be just as strong as a level 350 character with the same build. 
---
Level 50 dungeons should be built with that in mind.
---
Yeah I also get the same. Btw the highest votes I got was from creating drama out of a false advertised atom shop item. It was getting upvoted like crazy. The subreddit is full of drama feeders, who feed themselves off of drama created around the game. My positive posts get downvoted but the drama post was the most upvoted.
---
yes, please make excuses for Bethesda
---
Card games on motorcycles!
---
This would be nice, but there was already a leaked image data-miners pulled of the real sheepsquatch, and it has a sheep head, and quills for some reason.  So maybe a sheep and a porcupine got fused together somehow? Idk
---
I can agree with that, but at least with Country Roads, I think it fits the aesthetic of the game. Somewhat country, folk type song that doesn‚Äôt explicitly break lore. The artists however, you are absolutely right.
---
You give them much credit. We can‚Äôt even attach mods to weapons at the moment.
---
That was my assumption. I appreciate you confirming this for me.
---
Goddamn I love this!

‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù is one of my absolute favorites.

The classic station is one I wish would be expanded on.

Yeah, I‚Äôve been hearing since the heyday of TSE that shotguns had weird exceptions. That TS just added 1 more pellet, so 9 instead of 8, which meant that a TS shotgun only did like 12% more damage (back then). But E added 100% of base damage as explosive damage per pellet (again, back then), so E made shotguns insanely powerful, TS by itself was pretty meh but with E was another 100% explosive pellet so was still pretty badass. 
---
As far as I know that‚Äôs all still true, just TS and E got their damage values nerfed. But it would still make a TSE explosive shotgun do 9x20% explosive damage, so 180% of your base damage as extra explosive damage. At which point adding Demo Expert puts you at 180%x1.6, or nearly 290% explosive damage.
---
I want to be clear this is all just stuff I‚Äôve heard on reddit and in game, I‚Äôve Never had an explosive or TS shotgun let alone a TSE shotgun so I haven‚Äôt personally verified any of this.
---
What time are you usually on. I might be able to sign on for a minute or two in the mornings. Around 6am.

No problem man! You can find some FM transmitters on amazon for only a few bucks. It‚Äôs pretty sweet listening to period music on a vintage radio.

---
After a challenge to the workshop has started, you should have to stay within a pretty good size area to hold ownership of the workshop.  If you are killed, then they win the workshop.  If you stay in the area, it is a draw and you keep the workshop but it is still contested.  If you leave the area, then you should have a minute to get back into the area or lose the workshop.
---
The balance is in making it so that you can't hold onto a workshop without trying.   (Going back to the green area and then leaving again and hiding somewhere on the map shouldn't count.)
---
I fully agree with being able to walk away from a workshop / let a contesting player have it without PvP being forced.   People would take more workshops if they had a chance to decide whether it was a good time to try and defend it or not.  When I'm carrying 1400 caps worth of bulk to a vendor to sell, that is not a good time to be randomly killed without even a chance to protect myself.

Sorry I have a call I have to take. Would 6 work instead?

---
I typically don't use VATS but I may consider it, i usually don't use rifles (evident in my perk choices) so I wasn't sure.
---
What would you recommend in place of ironclad? I'd like to keep endurance high but maybe it doesn't need to be 11 points?
---
also attacking my camp just makes me server hop, not fun
---
Actually tonight‚Äôs no good, an emergency came up and I can‚Äôt be on until late. I‚Äôd be free around that time tomorrow though
---
I mean the shocks and EP are pretty rare and expensive. But not that much- the base armor should only be like 1k; the whole set is more like 6-15k depending on how lucky you get finding people selling mods.
---
If this was true and indeed aimed at a future single player FO, would anyone care?
---
Actually thinking about it, I think I would care. An atom shop in a single player FO would be horrible. All content for an offline game should be in the game and paid for when you buy the game...future DLC's obviously not included. If they were making content for the game specifically to sell in the atom store rather than being a base part of the game I think I might be pissed. However if they sold stuff that was already in the game just you had to do the quests or whatnot to get it I would not care. If someone wants to spend $10 on a gun or armor that you can get for doing a 15 minute quest line more power to you.

Yw. As far as we know they are. But what if they hatch on day 7. Are they chocolate or real deal. Time will tell. I assume decorative...for now!
---
Exactly. Fallout 4's Brotherhood was basically the result of Fallout 3, and reconciliation with the "Hide or Die" Outcast faction. People who see the Fallout 4 Brotherhood as fascists really don't seem to understand what that actually means. 
---
For example, in Fallout 4 the Brotherhood is never trying to take over anything - just defeat the presumed existential threat caused by The Institute. And there's absolutely no other way to put it other than existential threat, particularly considering the true nature of &gt;!Paladin Danse!&lt;. The Brotherhood knows anyone can be replaced, and that the Institute is the personification of technology run amok. Power mad nerds without conscience. They'd probably have done the same thing to Big MT back in New Vegas if they'd ever become a known faction spreading beyond the crater.
---
Yeah, same. I just laugh, I wish I could just have a special vision to see their miserable faces when they click that button.

Hey, bloodied unarmed hereüí™üí™ I use a hazmat suit, but I‚Äôve got, scaly skin mutation, grounded mutation, barbarian, and Iron clad. So I have somewhere around 180 physical, and 280 energy. Also use serendipity in luck, it works pretty alright.
---
Yes ma‚Äôam! We nuked several areas last night to see if any other optimal spawns were slipped in, and I was surprised to find that nuking Morgantown actually spawned glowing ones inside Vault-Tec university (not nearly as lucrative though). Glad to see something other than white springs getting nuked for once!
---
That's what I'm saying. Some bitter people. I just laugh about it really! Fuck em!

Damn. Yea id offer but by no means don't trust people on Reddit with your acct lol. I understand the pain however. Im a full time employee and father. I try to keep up with all that's available.

It's a bug.

And this morning found a 2*suppressor +33 vats and suppress damage for 20 sec.  Mite keep this one even tho I use PA
---
Haha. They're just mad I'm the keeper of the eggs!!!
---
Figures. Thank you for your time
---
Hahahahahahahahah. 
---
Oh...  you‚Äôre serious?
---
No.  I am not the target audience.  If I were the target audience, 76 would be Fallout 5,  with a rich and engaging single player experience and co-op invite only multiplayer.  
---
But that‚Äôs not where the money is. The money is in engagement, the atom shop whales, e-sports, grinding, raids, PvP, twitch, social media, and all the other things old people like me hate.  
---
But an app would be nice.
---
&gt;&gt; And I've played since beta. Still haven't launched a nuke yet.
---
&gt;genuinely curious wtf have you been doing lol
---
Wow, it's almost like you didn't read my entire comment first before you started replying to it, because I literally explained it. 
---
Also, wondering why someone hasn't launched a nuke yet is exactly the attitude I'm talking about. I've been having fun exploring the world at my own pace. I haven't even gone into the ATLAS Observatory yet. So what?
---
&gt;&gt;And it also wasn't the only added piece of content. There were more quests added. But I guess since they don't take hours to complete they don't count either.
---
&gt;you literally can do the dungeon + the quests in 15 minutes 
---
&gt;&gt;Also, "walk in the park" is subjective, especially considering it wasn't balanced specifically for someone who's been playing since release.
---
&gt;you have multiple people confirming its not a challenge the slightest
---
You have a few hundred on a subreddit of like a hundred thousand dedicated to a game with "millions" of players. You're a minority. Maybe not *right now* ***on this sub***, but you don't see nearly the amount of data that Bethesda does. Just because a few hundred didn't think the dungeon was even slightly difficult doesn't mean that *no one* did. Just because you do all the new quests in 15 minutes doesn't mean everyone does. 
---
&gt;&gt;I bet some people absolutely loved the dungeon.
---
&gt;some people think that metallica is better than iron maiden whats your point?  
---
Wow, it's almost like you're being intentionally obtuse to try to make my point seem ridiculous. My point is that your opinion that the dungeon was too easy (because it wasn't *balanced* for someone who's level 100+) is just that, just like some people probably liked it. 
---
&gt;&gt;I grind for resources
---
&gt;i have 100 flux of each type,15k ultracite 5.56 (and a lot of other ultracite ammo types) been there done that
---
Good for you. I wasn't asking what you did in the game. 
---
&gt;&gt;craft CAMP stuff
---
&gt;okay 
---
You started your reply to my comment by being "genuinely curious" about what I did while playing. Why so dismissive when I actually explain what I do while playing? You must have actually *not* been "genuinely curious".
---
&gt;&gt;And in Fallout 3's base game there's nothing to do after you use the GECK, or in NV after you fight the Battle of Hoover Dam. It's almost like this is a Fallout game.
---
&gt;fallout 3 and NV have replayability,meaningful side quests , interesting NPCS
---
Every single one of those are subjective.
---
&gt;i love fallout 76 but this isn't a normal fallout game
---
Do you? It certainly doesn't *sound* like you love it.

What browser? Sometimes going to incognito mode is a good way to bypass uBlock Origin and other adblockers that might be keeping support scripts from loading.

Some of them still need to ferment, but I hope it helps
---
I have some games that do not always require the disc, but sometimes they make me put the disc in later on as a means to make sure I still own the game.  So, the way I understand this to work on Xbox One is that you played with the disc recently enough for them to let you continue to play without the disc for a little while.  They will make you put the disc back in though at some point to verify that you still own the game.   If I recall correctly it is a week or two.
---
... I'm okay with this list. 
---
People who want a damn good narrative story really need to get to know the Mistresses.
---
I hope they don't hatch. My camp may or may not have 50+ of the first egg scattered around.

They want people looking at the store. You go on to get the free thing, then you see the sales they're having and potentially buy something

I got in after logging in through the main site and then going to the support section. Thanks anyways

Yea... something about it is just so hopeful, ya know?
---
Correct, cannibal is what I intended.
---
Yes! I have truly awful satellite internet at home. Here on campus, it is great. I couldn't even play my copy of 76 until I went back after Christmas break, so I missed a big chunk of limited time content, and I actually dread summer, because I know there will be so many great things and the nuclear winter release, but I will pretty much unable to do anything until I go back in the fall.

I hate it. It's a shitty cover of the song

So THAT's the reason why they originally turned his speech volume down so much that you couldn't make out what he was saying due to the low voice and slurred speech even when you are in the room he is in.

People complained that his voice was too low so they turned it up as a fix. I'm not sure there's a happy inbetween
---
Bulking only saves weight for aluminum and lead. The other bulk items weigh the same as their scrap.

No, the burrows is NOT endgame, and has never been advertised by Beth as such. They just said ‚Äúhey, here‚Äôs a new cool dungeon meant for level 50+ players!‚Äù
---
Remember, us on reddit are probably the 1% when it comes to game knowledge and gearing. Beth is talking to *everyone* when they say that. So for most people, it‚Äôs a perfectly fair statement.

At the moment. On the 7th day?

*Lo, there was much excitement, and many were gathered amongst the eggs. Then, the clouds parted, a single golden beam descended upon the gathered eggs. And then, the Apocalypse began in earnest. Many wasteland wanderers were torn asunder, and their entrails spread over many irradiated miles that day. This is where the term 'getting egged' meant something diabolical coming from something believed to be joyous. It was the turning point, and many lost faith in their happy ways. Thus, the Raider mindset flourished.*
---
Floor decoration in the same line as the deathclaw statue :)
---
Because load-in is something they have been actively making worse and worse with each patch.  Then one random patch they drastically improve game performance, but then each patch after that they continue to make it suck more and more.  We are at the high suckage end of the pendulum right now.  We might be due for a counterswing, but that's the thing... Bethesda's pendulum swings to its own beat.
---
Randomly throughout off days haha, should be hopping on soon!

I've played until lvl 20 and stopped because the emptiness made me uninterested. If they add NPCs ill continue playing for sure.

Theres a lot of cheaters in this game and they are drawn to survival.

Hunting rifles weren‚Äôt on the legendary list at all until patch 5 or 6.

Energy weapons lost the ability to be Explosive around the same time.

Or any of the take a picture weekly challenges.

Yep they are. I have the same shit happen. One will have a few and the other is empty. I always clear them at the same time

Thank you very much man :)
---
I understand that's what has been offered on the market. To me that seems high is caps since most Crafters will have ammo and supper duper. Netting in 1 craft 180 50 Cal ammo.
---
For the group I play with ( most are over lv 150) if you supply the mats we craft for you and you get what ever comes out. If u was gonna sell. Then yeah I would charge 1 cap per 100. Max 5k caps or 50k ammo. ( Withy farming routine that's barley 1 hour of grinding mats. But to each their own.
---
The Enclave Bunker (and by extension the Whitesprings) is not only a fantastic location for a Fallout game and lore, but it provides some really deep satisfaction to post-apocalyptic hoarders/scavengers like myself who live by the mantra of ‚ÄúLoot. Bulk. Sell. Repeat.‚Äù in total safety. :)

Witnessed, just look at University Point for a clear example. Synths rampaged through the place murdering everyone. And the synths were still sticking around.
---
Floor decorations, from what I read!
---
Easy there! Don‚Äôt go breaking the economy now...
---
As Three Dog once said
---
"Dont go waving the white flag, they'll just strangle you with it..."
---
Thanks. I was wondering about the time
---
This is strictly for roleplaying the mother of dragons.
---
Oh man, that place already lags horribly, an event will just crash me every time for sure
---
God, I hope Deathclaws hatch out of those things.
---
Makes sense. Still kinda screws people over that don't play every day, but I guess that's another thing they're going for.
---
Well my pet deathclaw would just kill the imposters
---
I disagree. Patching the CLIENT on consoles (may) be troublesome. Patching the servers shouldn‚Äôt matter at all. And challenges (should) be entirely server side. It should be a simple fix.
---
My friend is a ghoul build don‚Äôt know how it works just know he loves radioactive guns
---
Crossing my fingers and hoping that you can add a legendary attribute to a named weapon like the fixer. 
---
If they're smart they'll make rerolled legendary weapons and armor bound to character.
---
Newbies don't like the sound of guns.  Maybe Bethesda should give us a laser pointer item.  I'd even buy one with atoms if it wasn't too much.
---
I did it when it was nuked.  Of course it was nuked and cleared before I got there.  Grand total of 7 Glowing ones in the entire place, no legendary mobs.  I hung around for a little bit to see if anything would respawn but nothing did so I took off...
---
Every time it comes on. Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
I agree with you .50 ammo is pretty cheap to make for the amount you get. I saw someone offering 30k rounds for 10k caps which seemed pretty fair imo.
---
Yes, I believe a moth is considered a bug.
---
its a trick, send no reply!
---
Sometimes you don't see the sheepsquatch because he won't effing render. Hell half the event doesn't render when I load in sometimes. You could just be getting one-shot by the assaultron.
---
That's not true at all though. That's also not the definition of discrimination... He's generalizing teen girls. It's an accurate generalization if you just look a the overwhelming majority of teenagers. 
---
Discrimination is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex.
---
There's nothing unjust or prejudicial about his statement. You just want to be a victim so bad...
---
He's not prejudging any particular girl. He's saying most teen girls are over dramatic. Which is true....
---
"took me 5 mins btw"
---
"literally no legendaries btw"
---
"no content btw"
---
Waste of caps. Been like this for quite a while now.
---
You still get a wanted level if you take from a workshop that is not yours.
---
Yes!!!!
---
KAREN!
---
As others have posted. If you sit in your camp for an hour you will come close to the 60 per hour . But since each industrial purifier can only hold 5 water Max at one time. It stops getting water when full.  People have said that 12 is the optimal number to have running. It's been like this since the game went live
---
Young boys aren't generally as dramatic. They have their own problems. Like most teen boys are assholes or don't think before they act. 
---
Boys and girls are different. That's just the facts.
---
Wait. I‚Äôve made the point that if s person did the quest in 5 minutes then that played just ran from start to finish without exploring because to explore the whole area takes more than ten minutes. 
---
You just said you did it in 30 minutes.  Thanks for proving us right.
---
I did the Breach and Clear the first time the other day. I must have had a specific key card cus I was just able to open up all the boxes and got a ton of ore and materials. Was wearing excavator PA too if that mattered at all.
---
Oh yeah I agree. In the case of the app idea I don't see what the harm would be if you can access the whole catalogue still
---
Is the stream available as a VOD anywhere?
---
I am not a victim. And again even using your definition of discrimination - unjust and prejudicial is labeling young girls based on their sex and lumping them into an unjust category.
---
Yeah, I keep seeing misguided anger or otherwise stupid complaints, and every time I for some reason think I can change people's minds before I need to be proven wrong again with each new outrage. I believe we only had one or two posts on fp for the entirety of yesterday relating to daily and weekly challenges that are IMPOSSIBLE due to relying on something not in the game yet. Meanwhile 15 fp posts about trying to twist around words in an into the vault article to make up expectations that can therefore be broken. Priorities here are beyond fucked
---
Its the unintended part of online games. It just turns into an arms race with everyone using the same few items/builds for an edge. Theres really not alot of variety in what people use. If you dont have anti armor or bloodied explosive weapons, sentinel or cavalier armor each with 2 other amazing perks a dense chest mod. On top of fireproof, tank killer and than all your specific weapon class items maxed out with bobbleheads and chems hotkeyed you are wasting your time.
---
And also why is the vomit one not bottom left lol I keep accidently hitting it when trying to do the come here emote lol
---
All "endgame dungeon for two characters over level 50" means is that enemies are scaled and balanced to what they expect is a fairly average version of a level 50 character. Most of us are operating FAR above that level of capability, and that's going to be a lot harder for them to balance against, especially when we still have issues like disconnects and freezing during queen (and now cryptid) fights.
---
I'm still confused. 
---
He was "special" who convinced a natural gas company that employs hitmen (ok, "agents") to build a horny anthropomorphic super bot and buy his house.
---
Ikr? I wish they would just release most if not all of the Wild Appalachia content at once rather than one little thing at a time. I really want that legendary vendor and player vending machines. Also those backpacks sound nice.
---
Must've been a glitch or he got lucky and it did
---
I've heard they can be rewarded from the Leader of the Pack event. Never gotten it myself, prolly done it 10'ish times.
---
Will update if I get it in the near future.
---
Why so?
---
Yeah the guys that cover it suck ass. They're named "Spank."
---
Fucking terrible
---
‚ÄúBoys and girls are different. That's just the facts.‚Äù 
---
Again. That is sexism.
---
I doubt that they have a server for every time zone anyway, and it's not as easy as you'd think to make that a localize setting.
---
Maybe they could have a general EU server set with a more localized time reset, but since it's US people updating and monitoring things during their work time, I'm not sure how easy that would be to work out.
---
It feels to me like the plans they had for the game were set back by about two or three months by the disaster of a launch. They've had to prioritize on bugfixes as opposed to code for new features and content.
---
We both actually play FO76. :) She knows what she is doing luckily! haha
---
Mine as well, looks like it will be moving day
---
It's not his kid. It's a group of middle aged black men called "Spank."

I'm not very fond of the Beach Boys song. For a while, every time I would get into a major fight that song would start.
---
Yea, I planned on only really doing big things in teams. As well as stocking up on purified water and farming stimpaks. Maybe I'll look into food perks!
---
Lucky you, lel
---
The real problem is that it's not instanced.  So maybe you go in and it's loaded up, or maybe you go in and it's near empty...
---
Harm?  More sales!  Not sure how much it would change things overall, but it certainly would allow people to purchase things when they couldn't log in (for things like sales, I'd expect that to be a net positive).
---
I actually figured we would have to find them scattered throughout the rest of the atom shop.
---
Oh wow, was that you trying real hard? Ouch, maybe next time slugger, it won't be so hard for you pull to something so pathetic out of your ass.
---
Also, I don't know why you typed out your daily affirmation, you're supposed to say those in the mirror when you're alone. Hopefully you'll figure it out someday.
---
So 30 minutes Is dungeon level content? I‚Äôm really scared to see what the raids look like and how people like you try to justify those.
---
that would be great if thay all had 5 in them when i checked but they dont after an hour some have 0 others hav 1 or 2 havent pulled 5 out of one in a while
---
That's nice lol! I just got back into the game, I played the beta but didn't think I'd wanna spend $60 on it. Picked it up a few days ago and went from lvl 17-27. Enjoying myself quite a bit so far! Still don't understand how Workshops work though
---
Insects:  There are always ticks at the lumber yard south of Vault 76.   Always.   There are always radroaches in the shower downstairs at Whitesprings Golf Club.  There are always radroaches in one of the small buildings to the east of Watoga near the what-ever-that-place-is-called to the east of Watoga.  It's close. 
---
Canines:  I've been seeing lots of dogs all over the place lately.  Seems like they've either made the spawn rate higher or somehow I'm frequenting places that have more of them.  There are actually 2 spawn locations near Vault 76 for Canines:   North of Flatwoods and again north (maybe north west? / north east)  Look for the small pond that is somewhere between the vault and flatwoods.   (You might have to go east and west a little bit, but it isn't far from the route between vault 76 and flatwoods.)   Once you find the pond, go north / north-east from the pond and you'll find a house against a hill with hides tanning in the back and a wood front porch.  There is a food cooking fire right there, too.  There are several canines that load there.  You can hit both of those places because they are very close to each other and just server hop if you have to.   I'm sure there are at least 1 or 2 other good places for canines on the map, but it isn't coming to me right now.
---
Mirelurks:   There are always 3 Mirelurks at the small pond on the extreme south side of Whitesprings.  There are always mirelurks south of Watgoa in cranberry bog down there near a couple houses and a small building.   There are always mirelurks near one of the railroad stations on the southwest.   (I think it is Lewisburg railroad station, to the southwest of there... or R&amp;G station... but the more I think about it, the more I think it is SW of Lewisburg).  Yeah there are several lakes where mirelurks load reliably.
---
Hell, they weren't even a split. They were a splinter platoon that only ever communicated with the core Lost Hills Brotherhood by satellite until they lost that capacity.
---
(Though with all the ham radios around, there had to be a LEAST one Elmer that could have gotten pretty clear signals to and from the west coast. That's nothing.)
---
Lol, I‚Äôd rather sell them to a vendor for 500 than a player for 200. Easy math and still a decent price for what they do.
---
They should give us free atoms for the mistake... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Because they made a mistake and forgot to change that when they pushed back the release of the camera that goes with the camera release.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it man
---
I'm just about to vomit right now
---
Preach!
---
Okay sure, double down on another challenge is fine with me. 
---
But, though some are cosmetic, not all are. Some of the plans they give out could really help out a new Character: like the water purifier or clown clothing/clothing in general. 
---
It can make doing other challenges really easy when you can just craft the item you need for it rather than spending an hour(s) looking for it.
---
bulk scrap can also be sold to vendors.
---
this this is whats happening.
---
At whitespring is many three sap maybe there
---
It's because this sub was created when the game was utter trash. So people came here to be able to talk about it without every thread devolving into "it's a trash game." But now when we need to be critical of them it's becoming far too difficult because of that initial reaction and sub creation.
---
Can you post a link to the official rules for how long a dungeon must take?
---
At the very least be able to access and use aid items while sitting would be nice. Think of the implications if there were empty container items that could be placed at a camp (I'm thinking like a placeable plate, people could set up resturants and drop in a purified water+food allowing a mechanic for people to eat and drink. Lounging while drinking alcohol would be fun to do.
---
For added hilarity allow for items to be dropped so that a bag shows up in your seat when you get up.
---
So long as you have PS+, yes.
---
Thankfully most companies realized forcing people who bought used copies to by an "online pass" was dumb a few years ago.
---
The times store change seems to be at 8. That's when offers run out anyway.
---
You are not alone.
---
Stire items always have
---
Pretty much. You couldn't convince me to play survival for anything. At level 250 I am king of the wasteland, but in survival I'm just fodder.
---
I think it's only if its locked tbh
---
Totally random and rare for most.  I've seen 2 in the Bog and 3 in the Mire and 1 at The Whitesprings during a nuke event.  Those in the pix are obviously at the Whitesprings.  Flatwoods monster is the same, totally random and rare.
---
Fantastic? That was the NCR...
---
Around 8 Eastern time
---
 Well if he is a one shot wonder, there are several ways to do that but Bloodied is the most popular, you have to avoid that one shot.
---
 I'm in the game for laughs so I pull out my Auto Grenade Launcher and empty it into the floor at our feet. It has a chance to stagger and that can get through to some people but Explosion Proof is common.
---
Not much of a challenge period, but to be fair they said a well equipped end game player could solo it.
---
I did expect it to be larger but hey can't win em all
---
If you enjoy helping low levels there is this reddit page I've seen call PKOA where they help out low levels
---
One thing a lot of people don't seem to notice about the Fallout universe is that the United States of America \*was\* pretty fascist by the time the war hit. If anything, factions of the BoS were far more liberal and reasonable than the pre-war government seemed to be.
---
"The ol' Bear Necessities... Mother natures recipes"
---
Can you take the stick out of your ass long enough to use comparative thought? 
---
See any other online persistent mmo-type game, dungeons should be encounters that are multi-pathed and while they could take 30 minutes if you rush, max time could (and should) be up to two hours.
---
That's so dumb and so sad that the person that comes up with the challenge doesn't look at all the mobs in the game and ask themselves "is this an insect that should count for this challenge I just came up with?".   It's pretty simply quality control that the developers themselves should be quite capable of verifying in minutes if not less.  They simply have to look at all the mobs, and then check the ones that should be insects to make sure they are tagged as insects.   Crickets?   Duh! Bethesda. Duh!
---
I took the trailer as: The sheepsquatch is horny and hunting player
---
I do! It helps me find things to do after I've completed my dailys and such. I'll look it up, thank you.
---
You won't get many at whitespring.  Maybe enough for 3 Flux if you get it dropped in a good spot (NE-ish, the road east of Whitespring and the woods North).  Many times it doesn't quite go North enough to get the forested area there with all the glowing resins, and you'll scavenge maybe 1-2 flux worth.
---
I've not seen it, but have heard that Morgantown area can yield a lot of Cobalt.  Has a decent a mount of glowing ones in town too.
---
We wear power armor.
---
I had a guy try to sell me some for 800 and he said he knocked 200 off of them, I only had around 500 caps then
---
That's where my CAMP is. Exterminate them before I get back!
---
Breach and Clear is probably one of my favorite events, I don't know why. It might be the satisfaction of clearing every container or the fact that it can spawn a unique weapon. I do it as often as possible, even if I don't need any resources!
---
Yeah no problem they have like 51 people across all plants so you'll fit In
---
They spawn in any location with blueprint plans in the Toxic valley or Savage divide. Apparently also Cranberry Bog but I can't confirm that.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
Grafton Steel.
---
Top of the World.
---
It's best to server hop a static location to find one.
---
I do feel that it is slowly becoming less fanatical and more moderate‚Äî slowly.
---
Yes please!! Also a help yourself emote for stuff I lay on the ground.
---
They sell for 200 caps all day lately. Always someone out there trying to hose someone
---
Really? They could do it with a standard server setup. Like what Conan Exiles has. You login to a known server from a list of host your own. Then any changes to the world or story events occur on the server. If you reset the server it resets the world back to start. Easily done. Then you'd have pre-endgame servers and post-endgame servers. As for which story elements tie to each player? Heck, just have quest info flagged in the character data, it's not like it's not already there in the system. You can see every quest you've started and completed on the character screen. 
---
The only downside to this would be making sure every player could engage in the core storyline. Though to pull that off all they'd have to do is setup the quest system similar to say Borderland's where players could join in and replay quests. 
---
I think the issue is that ALL Fallout 76 is, is a blank slate. One that we can't write on.
---
Each of the different water purifiers generate at their alloted rate. When you have multiples of the same type of water purifer it merely increases storage capacity not the generation rate.
---
This isn't a traditional MMO.
---
Some people are saying it's the wrong challenges and why make them craftable, they have been in game since day 1
---
My sister in law works in a nursing home and there was an old lady with severe dementia that didn't really even communicate but they would play music for her. One day, they played the original John Denver "country roads" and this old lady started just SOBBING and singing along.  They said they had never seen her respond to anything like that before.
---
I get off work at 8pm pst and normally have a few hours left though.
---
Preach again!
---
It‚Äôs the sheepsqautch we are theorizing rn
---
Do I need to spell it out? It's not unjust if it's true...
---
You‚Äôre the one with the stick up your ass. Your dealing in absolutes and how things have to be by your standards. 
---
I‚Äôve seen other MMO with dungeons that could be done in less the 30 minutes.
---
Your rules are made up and false.
---
They literally all are cosmetic, the clown outfit is a clean version as opposed to the dirty one, The clown outfit is only for the Wendigo  challenge I believe . You still need plans to build the water purifiers, they just make less noise
---
Thanks for the reply but I have to ask why do we have to wait 2 weeks for a fix for a bug that effects everyone and is so obvious.  Does the team not believe in hot fixes? Or are they just incapable of doing them with how they use the code base.
---
Letting the sort of things go on that long is how you start to lose a player base
---
Its not true thats the whole thing about stereotypes. üòÇüòÇ
---
Shot anything that green and almost twice the size of humans
---
Really? You think Boys and Girls are the same? You are truly dilusional... You obviosly have never had kids.
---
But it is in the game it's just classified as junk rn, lol I'm kidding but I am serious why craft them when there are perfectly good working cameras in the game already
---
Should be under Advanced Power Connectors.  Sold relatively cheaply at Phoenix, Watoga, Harpers.  (Or, their Whitespring equivalents).
---
Also carry 2 weapons or more
---
Heh, all the more reason for pacifist players with the electrically charged mutation to invest in a full set of sentinal armor.
---
The fact that the new patch made it so you have to exit workbenches every time you repair anything if you want to see durability of your other gear again is honestly kind of astounding. These easy to find, easy to reproduce bugs just keep popping up, and I think it's perfectly understandable at this point for a lot of players to feel defeated by just how low Bethesda's quality control for this game seems to be.
---
Look in the comment section on facebook,i posted a video of the encounter also,heres a link for those who aren't in the group üëç https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2014872532153140&amp;id=100008912383492&amp;sfnsn=mo
---
ok, the vaults are supposed to be raids then? makes me feel better about the upcoming raids then.
---
\*Points at MAP.   
---
Some where in The Mire.
---
Okay I gotta jump in here lol. You really think that the majority of a game's players in MMOs are raiders? I like raids, don't get me wrong, but even I can see that the number of actual raiders in MMOs are pretty much a minority. In my Destiny clan that has 100 people who just love doing all the content, there's usually like *one* group that raids, and even then they only do it on like weekends.
---
Survival is pretty tame in general now. Last session the 3 ppl I ran into just scurried off.
---
Huh, I thought Microsoft got rid of the fee altogether
---
I thought the first ‚Äúbathrobe‚Äù might have been an autocorrect but you used it twice. I have no idea what ‚Äúbathrobe nukers‚Äù are.
---
It really is an incredible song. John Denver did an incredible job putting so much soul into a song that‚Äôs essentially, just about the nature of West Virginia.
---
^
---
True point.  Its just kinda eye rolling.
---
Heard of people planting corn at a camp, and then just nuking all the corn
---
The instancing problem is that all the cool backstory stuff and junk that's carefully left around by the devs gets messed up if you're not the first person there. But when *you* enter the burrows a bunch of mobs spawns specifically for *you,* with some caveats (if the person who came before you is still there that can mess up your spawn). Right? This is how the Whitespring works, right, as people show up at the golf club another mob of legendaries spawns, so the same thing here. Instancing would be *bad* because then only the one mob that is for *you* would spawn. The way it's built now, every new person who comes in creates a new spawn of legendaries for *everyone* (assuming you are lobbing grenades around like a crazy person getting a piece of every ghoul). So nuking the burrows creates an incentive for everyone to crowd into the burrows and pretty soon the place will be wall to wall legendaries. Insane! Fun!
---
I covered it up with rugs and furniture for now üëç
---
Amen
---
Figure that's what it is.. any ideas on how to track it? Tried heading towards the direction but found nothing
---
Turning off the jukebox helps a little
---
I understand completely. It‚Äôs truly out of place in 76. I‚Äôm only ok with it personally because of the way it was used in the live action trailer. I‚Äôm a sucker for song presentation.
---
I haven't tested this out but does this apply to forest operative under armor as well?
---
I take over a workshop or three almost every time I log in. I haven‚Äôt once ever had a player contest it from me, even when I held the ammo workshop. I‚Äôve had people help me defend and they are all super cool about it and we Jair share resources and I Hill‚Äôs them a workbench if they need it.
---
Mama dolces I‚Äôve heard is good
---
It's so wistful. I think there is almost a universal response to somebody singing about "home" whether WV is your home or not.
---
Genders have stereotypes for a reason... They're true. That doesn't mean a girl can't do everything a guy can do. Some can. The average woman can't pull a wounded soldier out of combat. The aaverage man can. Men biologically have bigger muscles, more aggresion, etc... Women are different than men. Period. To suggest otherwise is anti-science.
---
They have said that hosting our own servers is going to be possible at some point, and that's going to be one hell of a challenge. We'll have to see just how things shake out.  What you describe is a logistical nightmare for server hosting, but who knows what they can do with more experience.
---
Oh, right. Helios was former Brotherhood. I'll just... go... this way...
---
I do have a young girl actually. And its not me it is science. If you want to actually learn something read the article I linked.
---
Your statements label are gender stereotypes.
---
Or just be able to buy things on the bethesda launcher without having to load the game.
---
I think that‚Äôs actually a perfect way to describe it. Like, the world has ended, but it‚Äôs not finished. Like we have a chance to rebuild.
---
I'm sorry this guy is being a douchecanoe to you.   I suggest that you tell him that you tried to tell him nicely, but since he still doesn't stop that this is the last time you are going to ask:  Either he quits saying things to you that are making you uncomfortable AND pissing off your husband or he will either be permanently muted and/or blocked.  
---
It isn't your job to bring this butthead to his senses.  You've asked him nicely.  He's ignored your wishes.  Time to make it as painfully clear and direct as possible.
---
"Honestly, your comments and come-ons are making me uncomfortable and they need to stop right now and never be brought up again.  Further more, you are pissing off my husband, too.  I do not appreciate you ignoring me when I asked you nicely the first time.  I am not asking, now.  You will stop, or I will mute or block you.   When everyone else is on and you are behaving well, I don't mind playing on the same team as you.  When everyone else leaves and you take that as an open and unwelcome invitation to do or say anything you want, I do not appreciate this.  Stop now.  Do you understand?"    ----  Something like that, but of course you have to find what works for you.  What ever it is, it needs to be direct and clear.   I suggest that you make it clear to him exactly what behaviors he's doing that is making you uncomfortable.   If he's got even half a clue, maybe he'll behave himself better around other people too.
---
Got mine from a guy who got it from a guy who got it from yet another guy who duped it. So, yeah.
---
I've been trying to grab as many pillars as possible, then I just hide on the roof killing bots. Most players never try anything beyond 'SHOOT THE BIG ROBOT'  so i try to make their stupidity as useful as possible.
---
I'm kinda pissed, I *want* to play but  my internets too shit to download the game, meanwhile they remove a buttload of stuff from the atom shop and keep add limited time shit.
---
Bethesda *please for the love of pete stop.*

Did you do the unsolved case at Toxic Larry's?  Quills in the bodies of two teenagers there as well!
---
For me it's the "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner that is also from the end of "Come Fly With Me" in New Vegas. I only ever hear it played on static radios in the game world, but it's still pretty awesome. It always brings back that I never once chose to not sabatoge their rocket. I always made sure I already had the sugar bombs with me üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve had it knock off a few pounds here and there, which can make all the difference when you need all the space you can get in your stash box.
---
Plastic is a pain in the ass to get though,  as it‚Äôs used to bulk things. I go through it like crazy.
---
1. The sheepsquats isn't too hard. SBQ is still harder. 
---
2. The burrows is as hard as a regular whitesprings run; easily do-able with literally any weapon. Oh and the biggest issue with the burrows is the length. Check the post history, you'll see more people complaining about "that was it?" It was a very hyped dungeon and it fell flat on its ass. If someone wants a harder burrows they can nuke it. While you can increase the difficulty that way, you can't increase its length and the dungeon is still too short and unsatisfying. 
---
These 2 are facts.
---
Stop whining about people whining about things.
---
got a friend thats scrapped i think around 150+ now and still not got two of the mods he has been trying to get, had about 4 or 5 of us giving him materials to craft more of them. needless to say hes a lil frustrated too.
---
The people here don't represent the average player. 
---
The dungeon is a decent size. Has nice atmosphere. Put 8 Legendaries in front of me, and killed me once.
---
I'm level 79, and at best in mid optimization of a build. 
---
So I could have benefited from a squad mate....
---
Seems to hit their flavour text from ITV.
---
As a 2h/hvy build. I don't run my cards (minus bear arms) maxed. Just the first star. But to each their own

 My All Rise does 258 in PA. Ok not exceptional but good enough to 1-2 shot ghouls in WS/Burrows.

Trade stealing, killing outside pvp, etc

I have mad respect for the heroes who go out of their way to prove things through data. Operation tourniquet was a great example
---
Fair enough, fair enough.

Youre right, some new content shouldnt always be for those that have finished the content provided. It would be nice to see some harder enemies, but I am but a drop in the ocean. Others can have opinions as well.
---
I dont think we really needed a new legendary farming location, but with the vendor coming I could see why they would add one. It just sucks because people who prepared are now at an impass with far too many legendaries and with the vendor being so close it feels like a waste dropping them.
---
He did have the marsupial one but I wasn't about to spend all my caps, nor did I have the ability to get 800
---
The decay seems to have been fixed but it does seem like I've had to eat and drink more frequently. As a support build with philantropist I always have plenty of non decaying food and drink but it's enough I notice it.
---
Thanks for making this! I figured there was an easier way to level up than just sleeping
---
No, all of West Virginia and much of Europe also loves the song.
---
‚ÄúGenders have stereotypes for a reason... They're true. ‚Äú
---
Ya try to explain to any discriminated group that stereotypes are true.
---
The toxic valley where the gator park is. All those bloodleaf in the lakes become cobalt. It‚Äôs amazing. Put on green thumb and go nuts lol.
---
That destroys the corn still doesnt it?
---
Not fast enough. The game is losing players. And the new additions are not retaining new players. When people come here to discuss their issues they're told to "Go play another game." Until what they want is added or fixed. Problem most of these people don't understand is that once people leave the game they're very very unlikely to play again. It's diminishing returns killing the game over time.
---
Can confirm, these people don't care
---
Well I hope she doesn't grow up to think like you. Lemme guess, you think there's a wage gap too? You probably fight for 15 huh? God, open your eyes stop filling your brain (and your daughters brain) with garbage. You think they're all the same? Let your girl hangout with a big group of boys her age. Tell me they're the same then. They're not.
---
Long haul truck driver here. I know there are guys who do it but there is little enough room in the truck before adding a console and TV, plus a converter to power them. Then needing wifi. Plus I don't own the truck so I wouldn't modify it.
---
One other thing I forgot to mention is that 4 is the first game to represent a Brotherhood that's openly recruited outsiders. So you have a lot of new blood that's done a lot of fighting, mixed in with the original descendants of the first incarnation of the order. I'm not sure how much the games showed that making a difference, but it's pretty clear they'd have done so.
---
Dyer Chemical has them as well
---
I can do adrenal reaction later tonight if you don't already have it by then.  I think I already have one brewed up.  I might have a couple of the others on hand from a friend of mine.  Will check when I get home.
---
Problem now - it's a level 300+ alt character...
---
I'm asking everyone now.  The noobs just stand there for a while.  Makes me want to kick Bethesda in the balls with the lack of emote options still.....
---
Honestly not sure, just what I‚Äôve heard, haven‚Äôt actually tested it.
---
Maybe load in once the nuke is dropped?
---
I haven't tried since the first week after beta, I know back then it did, I took someone's ammo from the weapon factory.
---
White springs is terrible for flux farming in general.  Remember, flux has to be stabilized with glowing/hardened mass and high radiation fluids which are dropped from enemies in the nuke zone. And last few times I went there few ghouls spawned at all and they were not dropping nearly enough materials to stabilize. 
---
White springs provides a lot of raw flourescent flux but that's useless without materials to stabilize it which White Springs doesn't provide. 
---
Morgantown IMO is the best place to nuke for farming cobalt flux because will be lots of it there and ghouls seemingly spawn there non stop, dropping generous supplies of glowing and hardened mass plus fluids. 
---
Not a great legendary farming area, but if flux is the goal, it's great.  I think it has most flux except for violet.
---
good now play wow and report
---
Asain Men are the most discriminated group in the USA. No one talks about that though huh...
---
It's all black people gays an women...
---
You make me sick. I am done with you.
---
The Burrows current state doesn't represent what the Brotherhood of Steel encountered because if Beth made it lore representative (100+) than we'd have a slew of "This isn't fair!! I'm never playing this game ever again!!!" posts.
---
The dungeon will eventually get to what Beth envisioned but first they had to gauge community reaction.
---
[XB1] I will pay for disco ball
---
Yeah. So I went in for my first time today, after reading those types of posts. 
---
Got lost for 10 minutes. Enjoyed the atmosphere. 
---
Netted 8-9 Legendaries. Which was like Xmas for a non farming player. 
---
Died once. Had to go do laundry.
---
Pretty sure if your camp is close enough it just breaks the items. I used to live near whitesprings and I hated never having crops ready for harvest because they all were broken
---
You sure?  Seems like on a patch day they change the store items at patch time.
---
Did you not read the last post?
---
If you can craft an requirement rather then needing to spend an hour or more looking it; that's a big win.
---
Real exemplar of maturity, that OP
---
Why would you think it‚Äôs anything more than a wendigo plus a glitched name
---
I didn‚Äôt say they did nor did I bring up redditors being the target demographic for this dungeon. At level 70+ if you struggled with this you‚Äôre just not very good and I don‚Äôt know how to say that politely. I will say I certainly never saw 7 legendaries as there is a level of randomness too the spawns but regardless it‚Äôs really just some ghouls and a few low level bots.
---
I can sympathise. It's been a bit rough for me too. All the time I've been thinking of the cliche of escaping into a virtual reality and the description of it as a consensual hallucination. I've accepted that willingly and for all its flaws it has served as just that: a welcome escape from reality in which I have learnt more about myself.
---
I don‚Äôt need to be accountable for my choices if I complain enough.  Things will change to suit my demands.
---
That‚Äôs a Wendingo not sure  why it says base name though
---
Add all the sneak/stealth perks and the sneak mod on the combat knife or carrying The Fixer and you become a vengeful ghost to all but other players. It feels like I'm cheating, it's so good.
---
Ooh one MMO
---
Lmao the advantage you‚Äôre talking about is buying a clown suit and not having to get it for free? It‚Äôs a cosmetic It‚Äôs literally a costume, that‚Äôs not pay to win
---
East of camp venture. Whoops....
---
Love it. I saw the second Kingsmen movie right around the time fo76 came out and when the movie started they played country roads on bagpipes. I almost lost my shit at that moment. Then later in the movie the actor Mark Strong sings Country Roads. Hit me in the feels and now every time it comes on the radio I sing it with my best impersonation of Mark Strong in The Kingsmen.
---
I'd argue the point around stealth (deliberately hidden to avoid controversy) and just undocumented due to error or because the change was considered especially minor.
---
Oooooohhhhh.. I thought you meant something was nerfed without being announced it was being nerfed.  Instead people were saying stealth was nerfed without announcement?  Does that make it a Stealth^2 Nerf?
---
&gt;Making it so much work for anyone to find useful information.
---
I'm so tired of both sides. Each claiming righteousness for themselves, forgetting that every party has some valid arguments to be made.
---
What you said made me think of dude from Always Sunny
---
This isnt true at all. Theyre just buggy as hell. I farm water, and generally from 8 industrial and 7 ground I will net 10-15 an hour.
---
Its not listed under floor decor for me, even though I claimed it in the atom shop...it doesn't show in my camp menus anywhere.  What am I missing?
---
üòÇ I love that mission.
---
Can you find plans for that or just the mods. I have one mod in my stash just waiting for me to find a good legendary machete to put it on but I kinda want to just put it on a regular machete if I can make more
---
Truth is the game was rigged from the start. 
---
The other guy took time to copy the meta build and got for lack of a better word got rewarded. 
---
It‚Äôs high time that the meta shifted. People aren‚Äôt having fun anymore sans the guy/girl that‚Äôs gets off knowing their top of the pecking order.
---
Well as far as Ik you can‚Äôt, I‚Äôm hopping during the next bigger content drop involving quest allows us to get more knowledge on that demon
---
I sent a friend invite.
---
That's an impressive in-game cosplay. Lol.
---
I think that‚Äôs a fantastic way to look at it. I know before we knew the game took place in West Virginia, a lot of people took the song to mean we were going back to DC. To a lot of people, The Capital Wasteland is home in the Fallout universe.
---
or caps....
---
It was probably a setup to get his junk, people be messed up in the apocalypse :/
---
I tried out the pip boy light for my PA before the patch. Thought it was just green. Nope. 
---
Really, really looking forward to changing it back. Or changing it to anything else, honestly.
---
Ok. Right on. Thx buddy
---
Well it would be the end of the questline, so unless you were helping a friend with a quest youve already done, it would only happen once in your personal play through. 
---
Its cool that everyone is dead but like i said by the time we get to the Enclave its stale because we have seen it 5 times with every other faction. 
---
The Overseer is still out there somewhere, her body isnt on any part of the map so she cant be dead. 
---
I get the whole "rebuilding the wasteland" through our squad and CAMPS, but the game desperately needs NPC factions IMO. We need packs of Gunners, Raiders, friendly BoS, etc. Roaming the wasteland getting in battles with the cryptids and mosters. 
---
I would love to have some form of persistent settlements in servers as well that multiple players could contribute to, communal CAMPS if you will where NPCs and player vendors would gravitate. Safe zones.
---
It's random on witch one starts the process and then it's random on the next to get. Ect etc. I used to run 4. Only way I ever got full on them all. Is if I emptied them all then went and did a nuke run/prime fight. After I would come back they would all be full. Course that's when I was around lv65. (Now 118 ish) and it takes me way less time to do all 3 silos and 3 queen fights and I come back to maybe 2 of 4 full. I wish they would fix it so that they hold 60 and get 60 in an hour. Even if they said you can only have 1 at your camp. I would seriously do it.
---
Pretty sure it was an intentional mugging. It's a pretty standard tactic for people who do that kind of thing. Safest bet is to just not accept a team invite when you go to trade.
---
Todd literally calls them " the vault dungeons".
---
I‚Äôll sell you any of them for 200. I don‚Äôt really care about the caps. Just saving for a rainy day
---
Explain to me why this is funny?
---
Get a dense torso mod. They are much less trouble after that.
---
Solidarity bro. I'm in the process too. You're further along than I am but I feel your struggle. Having a routine helps with mantaining sanity.
---
&gt; "I kNoW yOu ArE, bUt WhAt Am I?"
---
lol, next.
---
I agree, the dungeon is ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù in the sense that the nuke zone is a ‚Äúhigh level zone‚Äù (which they touted during prerelease) meaning that under level 50 probably have no business trying to do it by themselves
---
Same. Ack.
---
Morgan town or Lake Eloise (spelling) has great amounts of cobalt flux
---
Lol, gosh, you sound super salty mate...
---
Just goes to show you can offend people on the internet with the most mundane of comments
---
.
---
If you have any quests left, do those to get level capped weapons. Hey presto. Better things that the SS by, wait for it...
---
#Playing the game
---
Yeah before me and my ex separated my daughter loved this song. Whenever it would play she would drop everything and come listen the song with me. Hell sometimes she would sit on my lap and watch me play then take the controller from me and play a little bit. It's been 3 months since I've seen my little one and yeah I get a little sad whenever the song pops up in the game or on my phone, but then yeah makes me happy remembering how she use to dance to it.
---
Thanks, lot's of veg there so should work out well.
---
Yes not having to look for sunglasses, hats, clown and formal wear ...etc is a win. 
---
But yes, if you choose you can spend your free time searching for those things too, it's your choice, your play style. Everyone has their preferences, mine being to basically spawn in anything I need for daily's to save me time, and not turn my stash in to a dresser.   Hey, play how you want to man/ma'am.
---
Votes on this subreddit go like this: You basically can't say anything praising Bethesda's efforts, or anything about new features that aren't critical. You can't make any suggestions about making something more challenging in the game, or mention something that is a lower priority than what someone else considers important or they will vote you down for "wasting Bethesdas resources". Only suggestions for features that make playing the game quicker and easier are acceptable. Also, if you disagree with someone even respectfully, they will vote you down and anyone who agrees with them will also vote you down.
---
You're dead right. It's telling when people don't have the insight to recognise they are overdoing it. Jeez, after 700 hours I take even my own complaints with a pinch of salt. But it must have something to keep me coming back.
---
Well hey there neighbor!
---
It‚Äôs not a real hard dungeon it‚Äôs like a baby whitespring club house
---
Fookin noobs, the sheepsquatch was alright the burrow was a dream rape, destroying the idea of a new decent (with matchmaking) endgame content, maybe with some new weapons and armors shows in the trailer before. Lol you jugde all fo76 player from what u see on reddit? That ain‚Äôt nice. Rise the voice it‚Äôs the only thing we can do as consumers kiddo
---
Sheepsquatch isn't that hard, if the people fighting it know what they're doing. My objection is the idiocy of charging 2k caps for something that will, inevitably, drop garbage. 
---
The burrows were hyped as a hard dungeon and it's...not that? At all?
---
I kind of like this. I don't think they'll be updates though they'll just be activated slowly
---
Nuke the burrows, it‚Äôs much better for legendaries than whitesprings
---
I feel like you guys are either insanely lucky or making stuff up. I stayed during a nuke and had more than 10 full respawns. 200+ glowing ones and only had 3 nonstar legendaries.
---
Put the PA plans on hold, save up for serum receipe from **players** (don't buy them from Enclave vendor) they drop from queen; worth 2,000-4,000 caps~
---
Sell serums to players (buy flux if you *have to*)
---
i routinely go to the vault and drop chems, ammo, pipe pistols, etc. i got helped out when I first started and like to pay it forward
---
The thing is over time eso managed to fix their issues and build a great experience. Only time will tell for fo76
---
Blah, nevermind.  I didn't read your comment close enough.  As you said it is in the floor decor with the Deathclaw Statue.  DUh!
---
Never trust anyone with anything. Not even your wife.
---
Never walk anywhere always crouch.
---
If it looks peaceful. Nuke it from orbit, tis the only way to be sure.
---
Prices are set by the seller and not the buyer.
---
Supply and demand only works if you kill the supplier and the buyer ( preferably with a nuke)
---
Never jump off a cliff unless your wearing power armor.
---
There is no such thing as to much firepower there is only firing and reloading.
---
Peace is when you are dead and everyone else is to.
---
Never go below 5k round on a hvy gun unless you want to use it as a club.
---
Never trust a demo "expert" that smokes a stoggie
---
Who needs lockpicks that's C4's job
---
Happy hunting
---
Eh. Not really. I mean it's just standard survival mmo hosting. The only difference being that story events could progress on the server. The pain would be if you had a server reset without a backup, then everything built on the server would be gone. But hell. If you ever played ARK or Conan Exiles then you're used to that.
---
Though I thought they said that we weren't going to be able to host our own servers. They said that we could have Private servers, but that they had to be hosted on THEIR machines. 
---
Anyone have the quote/official statement on that one?
---
so make another character so youll have a challenge in the dungeon? you have no problem  forcing other players to make them to run the same build as you
---
7th day is Jesus riding a deathclaw, The Deathclaw Jesus Statue for your CAMP
---
Looool
---
Yeah I did! Can't remember if I heard the sound though
---
Team up with someone or wait for the area to get cleared by someone.
---
Because i can kill 10 full respawns down there and get 3 1 star legendaries (200+ bloated glowing ones). I think you guys are taking your insane rng and thinking its normal. Its a bad place to farm compared to even non nuked whitespring.
---
I've explored it too. You don't get to level 300+ by simply discovering Appalachia. You can only do that by farming SBQs and Whitesprings for days on end. That's not how the game is designed to be played (they didn't even allow for displaying three figure levels in the original code) and now grinders have broken the experience for themselves they feel entitled to content that is created just to cater for them.
---
I can see how this might be an unpopular opinion.
---
I'm waiting for the "Bethesda won't let players earn atom so they are forced to pay" hate vids on youtube based on the camera challenges.
---
Finally some more reasonable players. 
---
These loud 600 hour people who represent a sliver of the player base seem to think BGS should cater content to them and not the majority of their player base.
---
I mean, for every one of these players there's 79 casuals running around. 
---
But they think they're important. I've seen them refer to themselves as "Bethesda's most loyal players"..... "The people who are going to carry this game long term" and "The most important players" since the Burrows launched. 
---
As if. I'd wager my Bethesda swag collection, on top of buying several copies of several of their games across multiple platforms makes me just as loyal a customer any day. 
---
I just also play other things.
---
I've only got 1 3 star handmade.   Only 3 star anything I've found and I farm the hell out of the golf club during nukes.   Level 123 now.   Bad luck I guess.....
---
What are you playing on?
---
ill buy some from you if you are on PS4
---
Cheaters?
---
There are easy ways to tank explosive damage available to everybody with a few cards and armor mods.
---
You should have Gunsmith max, but you should roll with Demolition equipt and get an exploding rifle. Same with White Knight, you should have it for cheap armor repairs, but you should roll with 5 stars of Adrenaline.
---
Last time it came on i was doing the encryptid event, i died, had that respawn bug happen where the camera just rotates around your corpse, kinda seemed like it could pass for one of those 15 second youtube ads to be honest ü§£
---
Sorry Xbox
---
Right, and before they did that it was a relatively awful experience if you were expecting Skyrim. I think it's pretty obvious that since Zenimax doubled down with ESO they'll do the same with 76. It's all the same shareholders making these financial decisions, they want F76 just as much in a position to sell in-game homes for $100 just like in ESO. They've already been improving the game, it took a whole year before ESO began turning a corner with Orsinium
---
Explosive and melee are easiest damage types to negate. Look at fireproof and blocker. Basically almost all serious PvP players are running those perks. 
---
So let's say 45% dmg resist from fireproof, 20% lone wanderer, 30% from just 2 sentinel pieces and you're borderline not taking any damage. Just as an example.
---
It wouldn't be a terrible in-game game mechanic if nuking an area exponentially upped the difficulty of areas you travel into from the nuke zone.
---
If this was the case, a nuked glassed cavern run would be pretty epic...
---
The ghouls only respawn if people keep joining. So its okay for the first half an hour when people are coming/going, but thats also when everyone else is trying to farm it. It doesn't respawn if no one new comes, and there are only a few ghouls and mostly super mutants above. Actually got way more loot from the few that spawn above than the garbage i got below.
---
When you pull out a handful of words from a larger post, it makes it seem so slanted. 
---
I mean, why didn't you include this part: There's no doubt they are experiencing issues with the game. It's not a perfect game.
---
It says two things. They have legitimate issues, and that the game has legitimate issues. It's at the top of my post, and not as some afterthought at the end. 
---
I am in fact, acknowledging that they're issues are in fact real. But that they present them in such a way, it's hard to find out what. I recently read one thread ranting about how Bethesda needs to fix their mess of a game. And yet at no point, was there a single point made about what that mess is. 
---
I'm so tired of one side, yours it seems, being unable to read, and always picking and choosing certain words to make a point. You're never happy unless people agree with whatever you are angry about. 
---
Sheesh.
---
Angry people don't like in customer service! 
---
Steve told me he had been waiting for a tech to be at his house for 6 hours and had to miss work! Sure, I spoke with that tech 5 minutes after he arrived right on time, but facts shouldn't get in the way of these kinds of things! Steve wants his bill credit +3 months free!
---
Are you still going around to the Forest and other lower level areas? I see newbies coming out of Vault 76 all the time. 20s-30s in Morgantown, 30-50s in Ash Heap or Savage Divide. I see 100+ people all over the place from time to time, but for the most part everyone seems to be at Whitespring, Encryptid or SBQ.
---
They said it resets 8pm EST
---
Hey bot how many caps
---
It was such a great mission. 
---
"What's that antler!? Don't eat this one?? If you say so..."
---
Good idea!
---
Nuke it. That‚Äôs where the fun is.
---
I would be cautiously optimistic but yeah I imagine the vaults being more fleshed out than this
---
Find the cheapest key online you can find, run 2 instances of the game or install it on a crappy spare machine and bingo, 5 mules to store those legendaries. My wife doesn't play as much so I use her spare slots (fnarr) to mule my stuff. I am *oozing* gear.
---
New mob type is the dreaded bug and Bethesda has baked bug squashing into the game?
---
well they did say youd get a surprise on day 7 if you got all 6 eggs..  
---
deathclaws hatch on the 7th and you get mauled by lil deathgremlins, get a cutscene of 6 lil mini shredders tearing your body to the ground.  
---
then waking up in skyrim.
---
Yawn.
---
Oh shit. I didn‚Äôt event consider that üòØ
---
Yeah. Wont be on today at all since I am working a 15 hour day(that is the government for ya) but definitely will be on tomorrow night so hoping it works out to get some people then. Trying to decide if I should drop on scorch queen or the burrow. I have not played burrow yet but seems most people saying it is great place to drop a nude.
---
Same even now as a level 20+ I‚Äôve collected a lot of consumables to drop off. I remember when i first got out i was starving with almost nothing to find until a level 90 player gave me a lot of things. (Food, aids, weapons, and outfits) ....forever grateful. (I still use the mask he gave me lol)
---
God Damb I‚Äôd love to see that.
---
I'd imagine it would be a smiling vault boy with his eyes shut shaking his head and waving his hand.
---
Yep ESO was a wreck in the beginning. Imo worse than fo76. Remember trying to group with other players and sometimes you see you quest content and sometimes you don't. It was impossible to run quests in a group just as an example of how much of a mess it was.
---
Hey man I know exactly what youre going through. I'm in the exact position right now I haven't seen my daughter in three months I missed her second birthday last month and that shit hurts but yeah looking for the dang Mothman is keeping me going by golly I'm going to find that cryptid. But yeah I'm sorry about all of this but stay strong me and you we'll see our little ones in time.
---
The water purifiers are just skins, you don't need them although they do look cool. I agree with you on the double down but they won't because they cheap asses
---
He got set up 100%
---
I had a mothman and a flatwoods monster jump me at the same time.
---
Geez. I was wondering why I couldn't get the mods I've collected to attach.
---
Too late on the seventh day, if perhaps for me only
---
It's also important to note that ESO kept its awful crown store prices even before it started getting better. Charged $25 right out of the gate for those "mounts" that were really just a different skin for your horse. Hell even charged $30 just to play as an Imperial. They kept it up with their $50-100 player homes
---
You most definitely are. Every single person i know that plays this game was immensely disappointed and a few even uninstalled until vaults/raids and hoping its not as big of a letdown.
---
That must be what the unfinished Executive Suite room is for. I‚Äôve been wondering about that for a while.
---
I've read alittle more.  Now if I have painted my T60 with skin from shop prior to trying to attach mods they wont take (my current scinario).. so if I have a fresh t60 no paint and try attach calibrated will it take??? .. going to try it out but cant till later on coffee break besting my head against the wall hahahaha ü§®ü§®ü§®.. I have removed paint and tried with no luck aswell.... friggin frack ...tired of my excavator armour.. in could have a boss T60 but cant till this is fixed or figured out
---
Where in the camp menu are they? I can't find them.....
---
i'll definitely try for that time, but usually it's more about 9am/10am in your timezone
---
You raise a good point. I rarely play anymore myself, and I have been told to stop playing this game about a dozen times in the few months I‚Äôve been subscribed here.
---
That some people will go ahead and one shot the legendary 3 star, even after you've asked for a chance to tag it.
---
Floor Decor!
---
Yep. My game tag is anachronistic and it is definitely my sort of thing!
---
- keychain
---
- actual notes 
---
- at least 4 other categories across misc/data/notes drop downs would be very helpful for organization.
---
Finally a poster who remembers/followed ESO's release. It was so bad they had to take off the subscription
---
Only if whatever you take from is locked ü§ô
---
no worries
---
I mean. Internet explorer and reddit are Pps and you can find the info on both of those..
---
Nice.
---
... now I want a baby deathclaw.
---
There's a lake near a fissure site that actually swans mothman regularly, as in I had one spawn into my camp two log ins in a row and then was attacked by two back to back
---
Don't trust anyone. Shot first, ask questions later. Bobby pins weigh as much as brick. No matter how clever you place your CAMP, someone else has already placed their CAMP there. Vinyl and canvas are the same thing.
---
Right, because being good at Fallout is a simple formula time investment + build optimization. 
---
You'll find more casuals like me than people on this Reddit in game. 
---
Casuals are the target not redditors. Not min maxers. Not 600+ players who think content should revolve around them.
---
I think it's a safe assumption to say that more casuals will find some difficulty in this dungeon. It wont be a no aid needed jaunt. More than the people here trying to make this into some conspiracy.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
---
Welcome to West Virginia 
---
Have fun!
---
I‚Äôll add you as well. Lmk if you need help with crafting gear.
---
Nice to know, I guess I'll start jacking unlocked things again.
---
Awww, he's hiding his face in shame because he doesn't have a cool name like all his glowy friends do.
---
The quills were freaky as hell. ....or was that Larry? Lol
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals, those lads
---
Your repsonse sadly proves my point. The constant anger, hate, attacks and insults. So many thin skinned redditors, ready to go at it any time.
---
No mention of armor. OP just gonna need to wait longer.
---
And making an angry thread makes you better how?
---
Hi. First post here but I felt that the dungeon, though not very challenging, it makes for great loot runs and I enjoy that you don't need to walk the entire whitesprings to do it. I was more dissapointes with the lack of lore itself in that place. I want to kbow more about what life was like for the residents, what lead to the formation of the raider gang down there, why is there an assaultron guarding a water pump?  Stuff like that.
---
Is the Burrow's a vault?
---
Did Vault-Tec build that sewer system?
---
That would be so awesome
---
Poseidon is a fun event once you know where everything is.
---
Amen friend
---
The only real end game is finding a new player and helping them.
---
If you cap one you often need to build a power generator and an extractor on the node you‚Äôre extracting. Poseidon is a exception because the core generator is already hooked up to the power plant. As time goes on, it collects resources that you need to loot.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING! Don't help the new players and filthy casuals. 
---
It encourages them to play the game and maybe get other people they know to play. 
---
Haven't you been reading the Burrows post! Low levels have enough content! We don't need more of them, other wise BGS will keep making content for the majority of the player base instead of a handful of die hard 600+ hour players. 
---
The gall. 
---
Seriously though, helping low levels is my favourite self created quest. Just need a point emote so they know what I'm showing/giving them.
---
Yeah same on XB1. If you switch those specific pieces with Barn pieces, they don't Flicker .. just cover them or replace any walls under with another wall type, not as nice, but hey ..
---
thread of the year
---
I stopped months ago, but stayed subbed so I could see if they made the game playable. I have a super op melee build so I was waiting for difficult content. Then they added the repair kits. I'll never touch the game again. Still subbed cause I just havent unsubbed yet lol.
---
Consumers can still look entitled. Just because you are upset over a product doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is. The next person could love it and not want to change anything. Consumers do not get the right to change a product to fit their precise needs when they are 1/10 who will use it as such. That is entitlement. You feel that something needs to be 100% tailored to you specifically. 
---
You have every right to voice your opinion, but no right to assume your voice will be implemented. Voice a complaint in a constructive way and that‚Äôs all you can do. If they see your constructive criticism and think it will help further the product then hell yeah you did a great job. Just being angry and spitting in their face is not constructive and will garner no attention.
---
Lmao I almost didnt recognize the sarcasm
---
Upvoted to try and make you feel a little better :) üëç
---
The ‚Äúmost loyal players‚Äù who demand a refund every time the client crashes and fail to acknowledge that this sub is the spawning point of every pre-launch negative article that killed this game from the start
---
I got that sense too
---
Best guess is that when they finish the Instancing tech they will be out. Soonish?
---
Sounds like someone who's a bloodied build wearing all sentinel's armor, possibly also has the assassin's perk on the armor as well
---
Yo i fucking love the black powder rifle
---
Same! First time last week, I was like wtf do I do with all this ore?? Guess I need some more acid...
---
wait i have one why is it "legacy"
---
Ok, I was just curious if they were out yet. Thanks
---
Perfect! And I can only imagine! I‚Äôm gonna keep looking for a zenith, they‚Äôre too perfect to try and use anything else
---
Damn that‚Äôs really annoying hopefully they fix it
---
Yeah no, you‚Äôre definitely in the wrong sub friend. Try the marketplace, it has a karma system that helps a lot more.
---
Int only effects condition of newly created items, and I belive the amout of scrap you back scrapping
---
You should look up oxhorns recent video addressing all the accusations.
---
Hopefully its still there before i get off of work :/
---
No problem.
---
I think you get the keycard from the quest at Hornwright HQ that has the same machine in it
---
I really wish Bethesda would release details on how this is going to work. My stash is so full, I need to know what legendaries are worth keeping or not.
---
This would be great.  Also wish they had the pipboy app like FO4.  It was nice to manage weapons equipped and mess with friends.
---
&gt;  Bethesda has baked bug squashing into the game?
---
Best way to kill bugs is with a sniper rifle. Explosive weapons are likely to send bug shrapnel into other parts of the game spreading the bug.
---
The fundamentals of marksmanship. Steady aim breath squeeze. Steady the controller aim at the tv take deep steady breaths and throw the controller out of the window and buy a PC.
---
shhhhh sposed to keep the best farming route in game quite.. keeps out competition and also if bethesda finds out were doing this instead of whitesprings they will nerf it too.
---
Try re equipping perks gear and weapon.
---
Summer is when the vault raids will come out.
---
Unfortunately that was literally the first thing I tried
---
Then they are unintelligent, fake fans. Let them go.
---
It had been nuked before I got there, nobody else was in the burrows or even in the nuke zone.  There were a total of 7 glowing ones in the entire place, no legendaries, 3 gutsies and the assaultron...    Instanced, or fresh spawns would be nice, I just got unlucky...
---
Ah yeah I think it was a Hornwright card that it used. I‚Äôm glad I just pick up everything cus I probably picked that card up in my first 20 hours in the game and I‚Äôve now been over 100.
---
so 8pm cool thanks guys
---
So what do you do whenever you destroy a wall or two, but they stay on the server, still refusing to fight you cause they just wanna mind their own business?
---
Because sometimes people are full of spite when something like this is happening. You don't have to look far to hear of (usually the wife) deciding that the husband shouldn't see the child(ren). Outside of him going to court to force the issue (not something that happens instantly) nothing is going to happen for a few days. 
---
I'd do the same to pass the time and get my mind in a better place until things start lining up. It's better than hitting the bottle.
---
Sheepsquatch was on the high end of the scale, burrows was on the lower. Players don't want an update that is on either extreme, they want something towards the middle. Not sure how hard that is to understand.
---
I want a ‚ÄúWait a second, I‚Äôm connecting my headset‚Äù emote
---
h. Then idk. Maybe it was stealth nerfed.
---
Jeez finally.... Thanks! I've gone through everything multiple times and just couldn't find it
---
Got ya.
---
How often do you move your camp? idk if it's true, but both my friend and I have noticed that we seem to have more budget after moving. 
---
For example, after like 10th move I maxed out budget on my camp (or damn near close to it). I found a nice new location, moved my camp, scrapped the blueprint of my old place and my stored budget was like 80% of my total budget (so somehow I gained an extra 20%).
---
Cool, thanks
---
They're owned by the same company and governed by the same TOS. Looks like you glossed over that bit.
---
This game will unfold as we build the story. Unfortunately most of their ideas come from Reddit. No offense, but we are the vocal minority of the player base. It started with all of us emerging from the vault and handling this issue with the Scorched plague. Now we have started to slowly uncover some deeper content that managed to survive (Biv, Sheepsquatch, Burrows, etc) eventually we will see settlements form, alliances made, and the other vaults open. The vaults will be interesting because 76 was the only vault that didn't have any crazy experiments going on inside of it. The other ones are going to open and we'll have enemies made of plants and stuff like we saw in New Vegas. I'm super excited. This game has so much potential, and we have so much new content just for this first year. Look at WoW and how dynamic that storyline has been. If you start off way back at Orcs and Humans, that's a 20+ year story. This game has that same potential, we've had several single player games leading up to FO76, and now we have been given an evolving story. One that we can continue uninterupted (aside from server stability üòÇ)
---
Make sure your saftey is off and the long barrel thing  is pointed at your butt.
---
It'd be nice if there was an Emote of the Lone Wanderer. Then when someone asks to join you randomly you can just bust that out and show you are just soloing right now.
---
This is precisely how I feel too
---
Biologically speaking, is the Mothman a cross between a moth and an owl or...?
---
Thank you. I just thought instead of complaining I'd provide some constructive criticism on what I felt would improve the dungeon.
---
Hahahaha - the post made me laugh big time....got to upvote the Bethesda fuckers planting em in our homes to destroy our bases bit...can't be any different to them doing sweet F A to correct base damage anyway
---
Wouldn't the expectation be that the FO76 devs would have learned a lot from ZOS's mistakes and improved? That's not exactly "rose-colored glasses." That's how companies make money.
---
But equal to your argument the person killing you is having a blast. Adapt and overcome!
---
How cute 12 butt hurt entitled didn't like what I said, truth hurts doesn't it? Yep.
---
I want a refund at this point
---
*Just because you are upset over a product doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is. The next person could love it and not want to change anything*
---
then they are free to say so in the same forums. problem solved!
---
do you not feel at all compromised by the fact your default is to defend a giant corporation rather than other consumers like yourself?
---
its ok, no need to reply, i already know your answer.
---
Fun post to allow people to come up with wild and highly unlikely theories?
---
I think you in fact are the one who should relax
---
I‚Äôm glad that I made you laugh. That‚Äôs what I aspire to do irl
---
I feel like every time I scrap a weapon I learn something, but rarely ever with armor.
---
Carebears ovbiously.

---
I moved around the perks a little, i noticed you have a build eerily similar to mine! If the perks I‚Äôve switched around proved useful before, then please disregard those changes. But otherwise, I think I know exactly what you were thinking making this. Trust me, a lot of the perks seem like they‚Äôd help a lot, but in reality, you‚Äôll die if you don‚Äôt kill first. I noticed you said don‚Äôt use VATs much so I didn‚Äôt change up your perception tree too much, but everything else felt a little off because those QoF perks aren‚Äôt so helpful when you‚Äôre fighting off hoardes. The 5 in intelligence is genius though, it makes it such a versatile build.
---
No matter your zone, it should be up in about 2.5 hours, hopefully you're not sleeping!
---
Posts about the SBQ being too hard are usually about bugs or scaling due to non-participants. Bullet sponges are neither difficult nor fun. 
---
Posts about the sheepsquatch being too hard were often about one-shot deaths, unavoidable pylon damage, coordination, or the UI not adequately explaining mechanics to players who hadn‚Äôt finished the quest and read the terminal. 
---
Many of the burrows complaints are about players who found half the area already cleared. Again, being in-the-world is modifying the experience. 
---
Whether the posts are whiny or not, they are signals about more than simple ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù. 
---
In all three cases, Bethesda is struggling to make world events stable, enjoyable, and rewarding for the diverse characters and players on any given server.
---
Fair enough, but still, why "bathrobe"
---
Buddy, thank you, that is the best quote and funniest thing I've read in four months
---
What‚Äôs the build of character
---
They did improve. We actually got a game that's true to the serie's genre instead of a game with cool downs and AOE circles
---
I'm not a big trader but if you need any more junk, I'll help you out. Also if you're on Xbox there is a trading club that has a most wanted section to hunt those types of players, usually for a bounty set up by another player, or to just keep an eye out to avoid trading with them.
---
Largest bounty I've seen was 35k caps, made by 2 players, for a raider group that destroys trading post.
---
1 lvl 50 decently equipped can handle it solo without deaths. pay attention to your surroundings, dont get hemmed up and cornered youll be fine..   
---
saw a couple get mauled because they just went running in making noise almost imagined them carrying streamers and noisemakers and everything came runnin at em and mauled em..   
---
i just walked through poppin heads as i saw em moving quietly.. didnt have an issue. got touched once i think and of course caught a disease.. but yeah, the burrows is not nearly what it was hyped up to be.  
---
i did seem to have better luck than most (saw a lot of posts saying no legendaries) i ran into roughly 20ish legendaries. but i spent about 2 hours in there diggin around and checking every crevice, while others ran in did quest and ran out in 10 minutes.
---
I like the people that set up welcoming centers.
---
anyways if ya still want a battle buddy, look me up, PSN: Silune ill run it with ya.
---
Junk extractor below the pond?
---
There's a farm up by the fissure near the pumpkin patch with a good crop of corn in the north part of the divide. That'll get you a good bit of cobalt especially if you've got green thumb. Then keep an eye out for silt bean and glowing sap and pretty soon you'll have more cobalt than you know what to do with.
---
I reckon the wife preferred the legendary drillüòâ
---
I use it, sure there are times when it would be nice to have that higher damage, but for the most part its completely fine. I'ts hard to pass up 425 carry weight. Thank god for the new skins though.
---
Oh, I didn't realize you've grown beyond 2nd grade levels of humor. That's good. Maybe your next attempt at passing the 3rd grade will go a little better this time. Then maybe someone will actually care about you again.
---
That‚Äôs helpful man thank you. I wasn‚Äôt sure if today‚Äôs was the first or second
---
You can get calibrated shocks on other better defensive power armors which with both increase your carry weight by 100lbs
---
Yup, scrapped 17 radiums last round and unlocked zero mods. Still looking for most of the good ones. Lost count on total but above 70 for sure. Really don't know why i keep at it as i don't use radium rifles often
---
Me too!
---
Had a similar experience.  95% of people are great .  Can't wait for vending.
---
I hear he gets paid top notch at his agency
---
Thanks for the message!  Rolled back my time playing until they started giving me something new to do with the dlc patches and updates lately. Kept playing despite bad communication from the COMPANY....and even though the newer load screen (a format they should have had at first smh) is better...it‚Äôs amazing how something as simple as ‚Äúhey limited time DC Easter eggs will be in atomic shop one every 24 hours then gone forever. Get yours now‚Äù is information that it takes the community to spread.  ((There got my Bethesda dig in...))
---
On a side note. Played 4 again with mods (I have never even looked at mods before) and I just cannot believe how amazingly creative and talented the Fallout community is. And how committed to Quality and Improvement!!  I can see how the Execs and money people could have thought ‚Äúwe will build a Fallout world with a skeleton of ideas and they‚Äôll fill in the emptiness while we charge them for that privilege‚Äù seemed like a good pitch and idea...
---
Do you have a picture of your Junk Trader, he/she sounds cool.
---
I‚Äôm Assuming they did a quite nerf to see what people would say or it‚Äôs just bug affecting you idk give some time and if the the sub blows up then they did a quite nerf if it doesn‚Äôt then welp your on your own for this
---
I've killed so many I'm surprised they're not extinct. 
---
Maybe these two are the ones spreading all those eggs.
---
Reliably 200 on consoles but PC tends to be a bit higher.
---
+karma You win the internet today, sir.
---
Hahaha hey, who‚Äôs going to say no to paying the Hulk top dollar?
---
Good luck, buddy. Sending you good vibes.
---
I've never had them attack me.  I will shoot them, then they flee.  Happened the three or four times I've encountered them.
---
I like having armor with weight reduction. Keep in mind it seems you cannot go above 90% reduction. 
---
If you have the traveling Pharmacy perk card at rank 3, then get armor that does the chem/food/drink reduction, you will get no benefit for chems. 
---
I got 3 pieces of the C/F/D reduction and now rock rank 1 traveling pharmacy and rank 1 thru hiker. That opened up 2 points each in str and agility. Got rank 2 for bandolier (str ammo weight reduce) and 2 more ranks in covert for the sneak bonus. 
---
Only downside is hopping into power armor where all perks of armor are null. Lol
---
I‚Äôm here for the Egg Schedule
---
Sorry forgot to mention that.  Primary weapon is auto tesla rifle.  Build is auto rifle with a focus on Perception, Agility, and Luck.
---
If it helps, the pc version is under a tenner in the EU area.  
---
You should see a serious improvement in load times using an SSD (either internal or external) though.  
---
At the other end of the scale, my pc loads cells so quickly I can spawn in to the interior of Whitesprings, run to the Artisans Corner and have to wait 20-30 seconds waiting for the two vendor bots to spawn in for me.
---
If they did it‚Äôs been a long time coming. Time will tell.
---
I'm so sorry about your situation. I couldn't possibly compare my life with yours, but I've begun to use this game as a means of relaxion myself. If I have stresses at work or in my relationship, I come home on an evening and walk around Appalachia. I leave the in game radio off for the most part too as this soundtrack is some of Inon Zur's best in the whole series. 
---
There was a little stream/river, I discovered just last night while aimlessly walking and I came across a fallen log as a natural bridge to the other side. I moved my camp there and expanded it. I have my own little two floor cabin with a deck and fishing post at the far end. For the time it took me to build it I had almost forgotten about everything else. For that moment, I felt I was alone in a forest and it was bliss. 
---
I hope everything for you gets better soon.
---
I‚Äôm over 200 hours in and have not been able to fight a single one.
---
They always run away.
---
I go with X-01 if I'm going to be in a nuke zone or T-51 for general tanky kinda situations. That silver is so nice I might have to start rocking some Excavator...
---
I open every nuka cola machine I see so you can imagine my shock when it was actually a door
---
I started heavy leather 100%, but as I've progressed and gotten legendaries, my armor is a mish-mash of whatever three stars I could get my hands on. As I've replaced it, I've tried to always have one piece of chameleon, one regenerating, something radiation resistant, and something to negate fall damage. Currently running two pieces that knock off 50% of fall damage each; haven't found the drop yet that will make me do more than say "oof". Four of the five pieces add a SPECIAL point as well. Looking to replace one of the fall reduction pieces with an auto-stim piece because I suck at hitting the right buttons when I panic.
---
lol.  i hear you on the PA.  I'm only in that for nuke zones.
---
I recommend leaving your desktop PC on, and using a remote desktop app (teamviewer/splashtop, etc) to access your PC.
---
That is, if you still have internet access away from home.
---
Not my fault Beth overhyped it
---
I get 36 shots with my rifle. And that seems average for a battery based weapon. 
---
It really depends on the mods in how you make those shots count.
---
Can also do calibrated on excavator armor. Main reason I rock the excavator now a days... that and the sweet skin from a bit back with the skull helmet. Lol 
---
My x01 with calibrated shocks is now for display purposes with the nuka quantum paint.
---
And what does either of those points have to do with their definition of the word "dungeon" in regard to their content?  Your point may as well be "They both have A's in their name", sure they do... but that isn't the fucking point.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the new area. The music is great, but I was just expecting a little bit more than what they gave out
---
Nah, basically the Harper's Ferry fast travel spawn point. Spawn, turn around, boom: on the bridge (but it's a literal boom. from my hero of the wasteland statue).
---
A bad game
---
Very cool!  I've been thinking of doing a tower build if I move.  It would be cool if they officially supported that sort of thing, with an elevator and everything.
---
HA!!! got really good at ‚Äúthese super mutants taunt us!‚Äù too funny
---
I‚Äôm running vanguard on my scout character and I so far have no complaints
---
Lol. Nice
---
I've got a TS 10mm SMG (No E). Can't recall if is has any other legendary specs.
---
You got it right. The characters that are 900 hours in and level 250 (no, not all of you) and complaining about content will ALWAYS complain.
---
There is simply no way original content can be produced at a rate that keeps players of that time volume happy. Dude that play 12 hours a day will exhaust any game.
---
That‚Äôs general use.   Xo for anywhere rads are an issue like scorch beasts fights or nuke zones and either ultracite (if your rich) or t60 for heavy combat zones.
---
Ran into this last night. Four of the super mutants were legendary on my pass through Huntersville (normally has a total of 9-10 mutants total plus a hound). Dropped a 3\*, a 2\*, and two 1\*.
---
I believe it was back on the big TSE change.  Energy weapons don‚Äôt drop as explosive anymore.  The old ones are now collectors items.
---
Honestly? A Jetpack is your best hope. Being able to dodge her melee and the vertical nature of the jump fucks with her head laser
---
Do you think they meant this by it being challenging for lvl 50 when talking about burrows
---
haha, so they rotate them at Biv O'clock!
---
I love the bunny. I also love the new wood floors! They look so good.
---
Imagine Fallout Jesus being an crazy ghoul that thinks that he's the real deal.
---
Given this is am online game that should have a longer lifespan than previous fallouts, I do hold out hope though that those voids can be filled 
---
In FO4 you knew we were going to get a small handful of sizeable DLC, and then that's it. With 76 they can continuously drop in new quests, expand locations, add dialogue to Modus or other robots, and so on to build out and continue new story or side quest elements.
---
I wouldnt count on anything specify, but there's definitely a higher probability of that kind of stuff here than previously.
---
As of recent patch I‚Äôm having melee issues too
---
Def stealth nerf
---
All 5 pieces of vanguard?
---
Yes and 10 people killing the 20 enemies that spawn. Then having 0 spawn when people stop coming, all for a few 1* legendaries after an hour. so fun.
---
You make a lot of assumptions, my friend. I never once voiced my opinions on the game. I have my own reservations and plenty of complaints. 
---
If you read through the whole thing I actually encourage constructive criticism. Let your voice be heard. But, again, do not expect it to be taken as gospel.
---
What's on the handmade?
---
Marcus will be forever known to me as Biv Negan and nothing else.
---
I have about 100 hours and I saw the flat woods monster for the first time like last night, no moth men yet
---
I just found a post suggesting that place. I'm guessing all the berries up there mutate to something with cobalt
---
Sorry for the necro, but yes. It's noticeably stressful on the servers for *every* online game I've ever played.
---
Am now also carrying around my pearly peepers to try and spot the sheepers
---
It is what it is. 
---
I think I read somewhere that the psychology behind it is something to do with habit forming. Log in at x time to do x event x times per x. The game becomes a part of your routine, which guarantees repeat players to a certain extent. 
---
When I say ‚Äòlockout‚Äô I mainly mean ‚Äòloot lockout‚Äô. In most cases you can run the content as many times as you like, but it will only pay dividends once every certain amount of time. 
---
An example of his right now would be world loot and vendor cap resets in fallout 76. You can visit every vendor as many times as you like, and even jump through hoops to refresh their inventory, but you‚Äôre only allowed to ‚Äòprofit‚Äô from that once per day. Daily and weekly atom challenges could fall under this umbrella. You can craft as many beers as you like, but you only get a bonus reward after the first 50 (heck). 
---
As a direct relation to your metaphor, nobody‚Äôs saying I can‚Äôt chill in my kitchen all the live long day, but it‚Äôs only really beneficial to me when I‚Äôm hungry. I could go stand in there right now, but I‚Äôd gain nothing. 
---
Fallout is missing the ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô aspect right now, and having more instanced zones would allow for more structured ‚Äòdailies‚Äô or ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô via lockout with guaranteed ‚Äògood‚Äô loot. They stepped in that direction with the survival mode challenges. Pacing loot distribution to individual players allows for more structured loot tables and gradual power increments. Both of which add longevity to any online game.
---
Yep yep. And the event battle that I am not even going to let auto correct try to butcher even further than I can. Lol the sheep thingamajig
---
Nothing beats the real grain effect you get from a vintage radio!
---
i use power armor because i do not PVP. plus i am a heavy gunner
---
Bloodied Auto grenade launcher? Is that up for sale? What platform?
---
Same here.  I'll use it to be a conduit so I can pop stimpaks while still firing at enemies.
---
I have one piece of chameleon.
---
Im only level 23 at the moment so getting help from a higher level player is always appreciated lol.
---
Don't be a dick, mate
---
If your on xbox add me! BigPoppaTrav
---
There is a  current bug that won't allow pre made mods to attached/equipped.
---
Pre-made mods are broken. It has nothing to do with being a legendary.
---
Probably not, or if they did they forgot to mention it but nuking stuff does basically turn it into end game content
---
Took me 10 seconds to see what you did there
---
I think it's more alarming that Bethesda recycled so many assets and so much content from previous games, has been making games longer than some players have been alive, and sti have no idea what the fuck they're doing.
---
And let's not forget the 4 other scams they've tried pulling with this game already. They've a long way to go to earn much goodwill and trust from those who still subject themselves to this beta of a game
---
That one is still over played.  Please #bethesda add more songs like "wouldn't it be nice" and "country roads"!  A+++
---
DAMIT MY PSN MEMBERSHIP RAN OUT YESTERDAY AND CANT GET NEW UNTIL TOMORROW
---
She is NOT hard. I saw her pop the other day when I was leveling an alt.  He's only level 25 but I said f it I can still leach. So I popped over saw no one was getting the pylons so I grabbed all three and crouched behind the one furthest from the hut. Bascially just popped a stim every 5 seconds and when I got one shot by the boss I didn't release. So that means I was the conduit for a full 30 seconds more with no agro. They dropped her with 5 seconds to spare in my CD. All in all it was a 60 second fight that was basically won by a level 25.
---
Bash and Perception. If you don't use it you could always sell it off.
---
Should be Heavy gunner, I think
---
Ah yeah, forgot about that part of it too.  They only produce at that max rate across all of your purifiers... randomly or some crap.  It's super weird.
---
People whining about this sub is getting to be worse than any actual whining on this sub.
---
This is the best idea I have heard in a long time 5 stars!
---
My guess is it will be easier to photo enemies and creatures. Photomode leaves you vulnerable for quite a long time while you adjust angle, filters and settings, not to mention pose and expression. Sure having a camera will leave you vulnerable too but you should be able to switch to a weapon quickly.
---
I find someone else.
---
Good Times. üòÅüëå
---
Hell yeah üëèüèª
---
You don't have to turn pacifist off. When you contest or a workshop you own is contested, pacifist is automatically disabled for that encounter. With as slow as the game works, you'll usually be dead before you know the workshop is being contested.
---
As for stash being full, flux has got to be the worst choice to haul around. Once stable goes in, it pretty much should never come back out unless you're giving/selling it to someone.
---
Mods were broken the last patch. Wait for fix.
---
Probably not. Lol i was just searching if anyone else had this issue... i see im not alone
---
Ok lol I'll see if I can later üëå
---
This brought happy nuke tears to my eyes!
---
It seems to me that they most likely set all the challenges for each day in a big batch in advance and they forgot they had camera stuff starting yesterday even though they pushed back the camera. They'll probably have to hot fix it or wait until the next patch to change them. Either way, hopefully they'll grant some free Atom or gives us a free camera skin or something in return.
---
And it's amazing how quickly they accept "Oh, I tested this" without examining the methodology. A experiment is only as good as its data, and data is only as good as its control.
---
Whatever I can cobble together, keeping a few in stash until eventually selling or dropping.
---
As in I give so many up votes.
---
Your in luck since i have stock pile of ammo for a GGG that i have gained since the beta
---
I will be the first to admit there were many mistakes made, but like i said it was a tough lesson i learnt. Btw even after 180 lvls i didn't know about not having to turn pacifist off so thanks for the info.
---
I understand you are frustrated and angry. I have had my CAMP completely leveled several times. And I mean completely leveled. That is why I destroy a wall or two. They can afford a few steel to fix it.
---
I don't like the unarmed character in survival as you die before getting into melee range. I have other characters for survival.
---
Shoot them! or something
---
Beautiful!
---
Combat
---
Nope no effects whatsoever. Luck does affect the condition and durability of items you loot, so if you loot then sell in your shop, it‚Äôs good to have high Luck so that your items are more durable.
---
In my playthrough of The Burrows, it seems most of the people on my server died in the final room, since there was alot of paper bags filled with junk there
---
So I'm pretty sure it's safe to say it was a challenge (for my server at least)
---
Difficulty aside the new content fucking blows. Its lower than indie quality.
---
Explore. Level up. It's an essential part of the game.
---
You got like two hours before it comes out
---
My very first post on reddit was about a question I had about 76 mechanics and it immediately was downvoted and the only comments said I was wasting time on a bu%#$#it game and that I wasted money. Don‚Äôt think I used reddit for about 2 months after that
---
An anchor, to drop, scrap or sell ASAP.
---
Dang, that was solid. You had a good group, all focused on the queen.
---
I ran into 3 of those last night. Noticed them at my camp with huge bounties. Needless to say I got quite a few caps and an ample amount of junk.
---
Use a machete.
---
Yep. I lost about 25 hardened mass and a ton of other stuff just last week because of the stupid workshop PvP aspect. I only took it to craft some beers and was trading some junk after. Guy showed up and I was dead and he had grabbed my bag and logged off the server before I could respawn without the game ever telling my workshop was being contested.
---
Tbf esos content is seemingly endless in a way. They do a fantastic job with that game. Fallout I play casually but still love that game
---
I'm glad I bought the new metal stairs I've been waiting for instead of the sign then. Thanks for the heads-up.
---
Whitespring as long as you hit it so both Safe 'n' Clean Disposal, Monongah substation and the bunker are all in the zone. There's absolutely loads of cobalt around there, enough for around 20 stable flux.
---
Working on it I got the game a week ago lol. I‚Äôve explored almost all of the named locations and I haven‚Äôt even started the main quest yet.
---
You made that even harder to follow with them directions... 
---
Found it like, as already said.
---
From the dmv entrance the big building straight ahead go around it to the RIGHT side hug the wall right around, at the bottom of the grass embankment you will see it half buried blue &amp; white post box.
---
Must not need that many.
---
Didn‚Äôt ask for your opinion. Also your words fall on deft ears. Try again.
---
Feels bad man. Stash your junk items. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You won't notice later on. That's all I do is FT from event, to event, to SBQ fight, to event, then to about 6-8 various locations looking for plans, server hop, start all over.
---
My bloody grognaks does 1300 per swing but i have to have the right card setup for that
---
That‚Äôs what I thought at first but I‚Äôve seen people state that it‚Äôs explosive. But idk.
---
Hey thanks! Just logged in and got the first one before it expired!
---
They‚Äôre sister studios and the games are similar enough in theory to be able to be governed by the same TOS. Todd Howard has said in the past that ZOS helped with 76‚Äôs development. It‚Äôs not completely unreasonable that players would form an expectation about the basic principles of a ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù in one game based on their experiences in the other. I‚Äôm sorry this one didn‚Äôt take off for ya, chief. Try another shill post in an hour or two.
---
I thought it'd be interesting, especially after watching "The Silence" but oh well.
---
I know you're really enjoying "conversing", if you want to call it that, with an actual person instead of MS Sam or Cleverbot. But given you're still playing Fallout 76, I don't want to keep you from enjoying your vapid loneliness, or the general mind numbing stupor that is FO76.
---
Problem with excavator is when you are in nuke zones. The rads stack up pretty quick. I usually carry 2 suits if power armor on me. One excavator and 1 x-01.
---
Counted for me.  The event rewards things several times, which can seem like it ending. 
---
Also at the end, it took a little bit of time for the challenge completion to appear after the event ended.
---
Maybe if his entire living was threatened. But it doesn't seem that way since he still has over 1mil subs and this info about his background has been around awhile.
---
This may be a stupid question but can you place these in your camp? If so what section are they under cause I couldn‚Äôt find it after I got it
---
One thing to consider is moving you camp closer to the manor. I built my camp outside Charleston while I was doing that quest chain (my favorite, I still wear the garb constantly) and it saved me a lot of caps.
---
Yes. They are under Floor Decor.
---
Personally, Unyielding or Bolstering. Those seem like the best fit for me. Anything that regens AP speed or adds to strength, too.
---
But Excavator can also use those and so still has an extra 100 carry weight compared to others.
---
You are most welcome! Happy Easter!
---
The super sledge can hit the hardest along with the grognaks axe. Super sledges rocket can be annoying in your ear and it's slow for farming heavy mobs. I have bloodied ss 1end fireman axe and I still one shot all trash just alot fasted and stealthier.
---
You da best
---
I lost a stash I was trying to move to a mule.  It was just a bunch of combat rifles and shotguns and 2 serums. Win some you lose some
---
Regular burrows = Literally any weapon; minimal preparation
---
Nuked burrows = Glow sights + instigating rifle. 
---
Both approaches will make it so ghouls are 1 shot. Gutsies are 2 shots in the thruster.
---
Even if nuked is the real version is still a letdown... 
---
The nuke silo itself is harder than this. So why go through a harder dungeon first only so you can access the "true" version of another easier dungeon first?
---
Sorry I should have explained that's my total carry weight while wearing my excavator Power armor with perk cards Etc
---
work on getting to level 50 first, because if you get a legendary weapon that is below that it will not be as good as most other weapons
---
Dense BOS chest, studded leather arms/legs for best crafted armor. 
---
Sentinal as a third petk on any legendary armor makes you dang near impervious to everything. I can tank super mutants all day with 19% health.
---
I almost have a full set of +25 rad resist (2nd perk) armor pieces that I'm adding lead mods to. Want to see if I can run through nuke zones without PA.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs tough during the week. Weekends I‚Äôm usually on most of the day.
---
As someone with a heavy weapons build. All ranged weapons need buffs. Have automatic rifles and rides benefit from a straight damage boost with perception and the same for shotty and heavy weapons with stregnth
---
For me it's Flatwoods Monster. Saw 2 today, both times I shoot once and they instantly vanish. Not to anywhere nearby- just entirely. The only way I've been able to loot them is to quickly two shot them on my melee build
---
And remember: If you are downed while holding a pylon, you continue to hold that pylon until you either die or get revived. So don't immediately click the "give up" button, hold it long enough for the group to get some hits in.
---
I wanted to change my headlamp from red to purple. Tacticool red it is.
---
You know every single one of your posts comes across as abrasive in tone?
---
It's happening to alot of people since a recent update including myself. I checked out the tattoo parlor out last night and it's all boarded up, so Bethesda are possibly in the process of patching it now
---
It affects armour mods too. Hopefully it'll all be fixed ASAP
---
There‚Äôs what you have now and what you‚Äôll need later. I think I see what you‚Äôre heading towards and I have a similar character.
---
I would deprioritize agility. Mine looks kinda like this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f37b668&amp;d=c72lt2ss2se2sg2l71lu2i44eh2a72pe2a80a30c81cu0ep1a00i10cf0ce0ev0em1s42sm1sn0&amp;w=lm2p02ib4ic4iq2if2ii0ih2s70&amp;n=Macksheen&amp;m=3189fch
---
Essentially
---
- Melee perks in STR. I tend to use Blocker.
---
- PER is good; you might consider running w/ 2 Glow Sight, 1 Green Thumb in nuke zones.
---
- I really really really like Sun Kissed for the lazy rad removal, and Fire Proof is super handy. To me those are like Starched Genes and Class Freak.
---
- CHA you can do a lot with - I‚Äôm still playing there
---
- INT at 6 is mostly because I had it; I‚Äôm going to shift it somewhere
---
- AGI I run low. I‚Äôd skip Evasive; Dodgy is better ultimately and Evasive doesn‚Äôt work in PA.
---
- LCK at 8 is almost a mandatory for me. Swap in Super Duper as needed.
---
I appreciate the post, man.. Would've missed this if it weren't for you!
---
Can you get on today? 10:00 PM ET by latest?
---
They marketed it as a 2 player dungeon doable by 1 person, and that's what it is. I'm sorry you read too much into that and failed to manage your expectations. xD
---
Maybe you can‚Äôt be in power armor? I made sure I stayed until it was definitely over and it didn‚Äôt pop.
---
OP you are absolutely right with your assessment of this sub. I pre-ordered and bought FO 76 expecting the at launch issues so I've gotten more than my money's worth. 
---
I don't think ppl realize that Beth is pulling requests directly from this reddit since I see several posts about wpn durability and then they outrage when repair kits are announced smh
---
True game breaking glitches are great to be posted about to be addressed but I must not be exploring where they do bcuz I haven't ran into anything like what is exaggerated about on the regular or maybe I'm just too into the Fallout series to care idk.
---
Oddly enough, I‚Äôve been able to kill 2 flatwoods monsters lol
---
Otherwise couriers are apt to get a 9mm to the head.
---
Oh look.... another post of outrage about posts of outrage.....What's sad is I bet you dont even see the irony in that.
---
You sure do seem to know a lot about what the devs do and do not do.
---
Allow me to educate you somewhat.
---
You are right - the devs overall would not he handing around the reddit much or watching YouTube videos or any of that jazz.
---
That's what their social media team is for.
---
A social media team monitors all platforms and actually....and this is the important bit....takes note of trending issues being reported and, yes, trending complaints from the different platforms.
---
This is all gathered and feed back to management on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
---
So often on this reddit I see fanboys jump to the rescue of the game, as if it needed your saving. 
---
Ultimately - posts like yours do more harm to the game than good, you just dont have the comprehension to understand that.
---
Negative feedback is a very important thing for any product - only then can it improve.
---
To get top issues seen faster, people flood the different platforms that they know a companies social media team is monitoring in the hopes of having their issue added to any report going back to the guys that can make decisions.
---
If we were all like you, then the status quo would continue and there would be no point on improving anything or working to make future plans better based ok past failures.
---
And that's the key here - the content is already out - but based on good honest feedback from the community as to their enjoyment or lack thereof, decisions will be made that will affect future content. 
---
Maybe not what's currently in the pipeline - but anything beyond that.
---
So my advice to you would simply be to pipe down and stop trying to degrade others for actually trying to contribute to a better Fallout game. 
---
If you dont like the posts - then dont read them. Put on your fan boy blinders and get on with your life.
---
Others are actually trying to steer the game towards greatness rather than settle for nearly enough is good enough.

Under floor decor in the same category with the mini statues
---
It was my 33rd birthday yesterday and I had a bday party at my whitesprings station base. I leveled up from 32 to 33 yesterday too which was awesome and not planned! Lots of kind people like yourself came and one especially named Goosey made me handmades, ammo and hooked up so so many plans. It was a blast!
---
I had a hard time at first finding Fusion Cores. Then I met a friend who gave me a bunch. Then I got the cards to extend their usage. I haven't had to worry about them since. If you're ever in dire need, I'm on PC. mroboto.
---
I just wanted to say, that I appreciate the hell out of this post. Thanks, OP.
---
Tell that to Microsoft/Sony and their patch verification process.
---
Damn Peeko...
---
I want fries...
---
Yeah. God loot now! No crappy one or two star shit. Give me everything I want now! Bethesda need to compensate your time just walking, earning exp, finding other places. No wonder this game gets bad reviews. Imagine working at this game for more than a WHOLE afternoon without being level 150, what were they thinking???
---
Try floor decor and look through statues
---
T-60 has higher rad resist, is cheaper to repair, has a jetpack, and with calibrated shocks, still has 340 carry weight.
---
Why do you need 100 extra carry weight?
---
Happy Belated! Glad there were great people around to celebrate with!
---
You can‚Äôt get it the broken version yes good Verison no
---
I bought the tricentennial fallout 76 game bundle at it came with a keychain
---
Yeah, you can't be in power armor.
---
I know how you felt. Feels bad man.
---
I agree it was a mistake on their part,  but it does suck to lose that many potential atoms this week.  I personally think they should just apply the atoms from every camera challenge to our accounts.  Only because it is their mistake.
---
Thank you so so much for saying this. I am nowhere near as articulate and always end up getting in fights. This sub is so toxic and entitled  most of the time (any game sub let's be honest.)
---
I wish more people were normal like us and just played the game for leisure and not to stroke off our virtual boner.
---
I use camp fires, lanterns, and candles. I like the ambient light especially at night, I dont want nobody seeing the light from my Camp.
---
Thanks man!
---
Yeah, but it sounds like you actually wanted the workshop, these situations are people wanting to get PvP kills without joining the PvP servers.  
---
Yes, workshops are free fire areas but it should be for the point of winning the workshop, getting a kill then moving out of the claim area, then doing it all over again is a shitty way to PvP without taking the risk of other players putting you down
---
I live under a bridge
---
I saw a pic of someone standing over the body of one which had loot but I think it was edited since it was the same rewards as the grafton monster. I give it at least another week or two before they spawn
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie...
---
Perfect.
---
Not true at all.

I can go on and on. So clearly, not every single post is abrasive in tone. You just are a reddit stalker who doesn't like people that enjoy the game and are generally trying to positive about the experience. Or maybe you just don't like people that don't repeat what others come up with, like most of the game haters do. 
---
Generally what I find is game haters don't like me, because I call them on their BS. Usually with facts. Kind of like how I just did with you.
---
Hahahahahhahahhahahha
---
They delayed it.
---
Yes indeed. And like I said there were tons of glowing ones there and they seemed to keep re-spawning and they dropped all the needed materials for stabilizing flux. What platform are you on BTW?
---
True but balancing defense at lower levels vs carry weight better off with defense usually higher levels better card selection and gear dont need the better defense and benefit more from the weight
---
Ah damn, my character isn‚Äôt built to last long outside it. Would it count if I left the armor right before the event ended?
---
ah, what‚Äôs new. thank u bethesda!
---
Would be nice if it didn't take me a really long time to change loadouts and perk points around to do that. I'm not blaming the player 76 has too many problems.
---
Now this, this would fun
---
Ideally, you shouldn't mix rifles and melee. They use entirely seperate specials. Go one or the other. If you want to go rifles, go rifles, and dump strength special for more agility and luck. That said you don't need high int for rifle builds either-- and honestly you don't need either gunsmith or makeshift warrior anymore once you have weapon artisan and know where to farm the junk for repairs.
---
I'd think so. Seems to work for other challenges that want you to wear apparel when certain things happen.
---
Chill bro I never said anything about anything you mentioned. I get that the game is a grind. I understand at level &lt;20 I‚Äôm not gonna get good loot. It‚Äôs just odd to me to charge caps for fast travel. It makes sense I guess since there‚Äôs less to spend caps on in this game than previous fallouts.
---
No, but I checked out the tattoo parlor out last night and it's door is boarded up, so they are possibly aware of it now and fixing it
---
I can make you a marine wetsuit. Just message me your game tag rather than post it and we can meet in game.
---
Also the full wetsuit!
---
I'm looking for this on XB1
---
oof
---
Don't be silly
---
That's for next year's joke
---
\&gt;  you take it in the face? 
---
I do! How else am I going to get my laser tan, and get rid of that beard? (Actually on my heavy gunner, that beam just makes an easy target.. and she doesn't do that much damage)
---
I just like the game for what it is. I‚Äôm level 23, took a while to get there because I get distracted all the time (whenever I see a monorail track I just have to climb on it and follow it to the end, lol). I tried entering the Burrows and noped out of there because of all the ghouls attacking me. From what I saw it looked awesome and I can‚Äôt wait to get back and see what they did to the place. The game just has such a lovely atmosphere to it :)
---
yeah im just trying to replace my all rise with something better
---
Really? How has it not been fixed yet
---
Eggs hatch next year :D
---
I just saw that it's still yesterday egg ... is this running on a different time zone to the usual dailies? Usually 3pm UK time isn't it?
---
Perma-camps? I haven't heard about this. Please enlighten me.
---
Leader of the Pack event in the forest is always good for at least a few legendary items
---
How do i max out generation rate?
---
Camera is supposedly coming next week, got delayed. We got screwed out of Atoms, don't get me started.
---
It is stupidly easy to circle strafe her as melee, or if you have marsupial, jump too.
---
Early legendary weapons are easy to get from the leader of the pack event. You'll out grow them but you can always pass them on to a low level.
---
Dunno I thought they'd have seen this as a priority but I guess not...
---
Oki! Thanks I'll try that
---
That would be very cool. I just used stairs to get up there, its effectively a floating structure but looks like it‚Äôs resting inside the tower: https://twitter.com/ne0npink/status/1110913726633443328?s=21
---
Ok I'll try it. Thx for the suggestion!
---
I know. Helping low level players is like the worst, you know? I mean, OMG do they think we're like babysitters or something? Actually, I've had fun playing with the little tykes.
---
I just went to a nuked Harper‚Äôs Ferry and it is a really good spot to farm.  There is also a lot of Crimson and Violet Flux, which I really need.  Too bad it was over after five minutes of me being there.  I need to go their again so I can get stuff to stabilize my Flux.

Personally I think not. I am 425 and never used any set other than excavator more than just to briefly try it out.

Feel free to pull out a tesla rifle and kill everything at once too, or an endangerol syringer to debuff the boss so she dies even faster

Fuck your entitled shit.
---
I wouldn't have known at all if it weren't for your post. Downvotes likely came from people who don't get that they are judging the *post* and not the news being delivered.
---
Yes, which is why I suggest tossing grenades around. Or get poison aura.

I wish there was a way to tell if it was their first account or their second account because I've had people with their second account just use me to get stuff easier instead of doing the work themselves like I do.

Usually I have to activate all 3, somehow after 40 stimpacks he still isn‚Äôt dead. I then die and people melee me non stop to activate them again because they don‚Äôt want to use their pile 400 stims. I‚Äôve stopped doing the quest now cause it costs me usually almost all my stims plus 1750 caps
---
It‚Äôs not a daily like the challenges. It resets when the store resets at 8pm edt. So 1.5 hours from now.
---
Weapon and perk nerfs upset people, bullet sponge enemies upset people, having too many enemies that the game crashes upsets people, at a certain point, you really cant make something harder without forcing peop,e into a play style they dont like, which, if i remeber correctly, has already been complained about on here that mellee were at an "unfair disadvantage" against the flying scorchbeasts because they were too far away to mellee
---
So you're talking about a level 50 alt you created after surpassing 200 on your main.
---
I'm sure I can find a software developer in Pakistan that will don't for half the cost
---
Yeah I understand  that. But they don't force you to fast travel. Explore the map, it's not a race. These quests aren't timed. So, fast travel is a  option, so is walking and fighting  getting loot to sell at vendors too.
---
I like it...
---
I don‚Äôt read everything at once cause I log in to play, lol
---
Takes me a week to go over all the new info with my play time
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to try that then, thanks
---
You can say that again.
---
I agree but he seemed genuine. He spent the entire time in my server and even asked me to come help him with a scorchbeast. If he was bullshitting me then he went through some great lengths for a few fusion cores lmao.
---
you can usually get all 3 requirements in 1 level up
---
It depends on who is on your server, but yes, the SBQ can be very easy when you're prepared. No, you don't need OP guns (though it helps), but the right positioning, builds and preperation make it significantly easier (endangerol syringer, cyrolaters, etc).
---
 There is decent cobalt at white springs, you just have to make sure you hit that cabin where the super mutants are to the north
---
100% damage reduction? He also said he tried melee too. So we got a guy that's immune to explosive and melee. 
---
You arent getting that from armor mods and cards. Not 100% like stated.
---
Ooo maybe a big unmarked quest/puzzle no found out about yet, interesting, maybe it is in regards to the real ending of fallout 76
---
I wasnt trying to say your guy wasnt legit sorry about that.
---
Thank you for taking the time to educate me on such complex matters beyond my inferior comprehension such as how I should‚Äôve not used ‚Äúdev‚Äù and instead said ‚Äúcommunity service team that collects feedback and reports to the dev on devs behalf‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure I could‚Äôve possibly fathomed that complex concept unless my erection had hit the underside of my desk as I stroked my own ego ever so eloquently as yourself.
---
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs just as frustrating when you‚Äôre a high level, you go to farm somewhere, and all the mobs are low level. üò£
---
It could also be apart of the arktos pharma raid/ dungeon thing that is supposed to drop.
---
I'm interested to find out!
---
I need this because my turrets can't reach the range of the enemies. Plus they look bad, an assaultron would look much better.
---
Ha, thank you!

People complained they had nothing to spend caps on.  So they gave them something to spend caps on.
---
&gt;He does not ever infer that the "knock your socks off" stuff is specifically the burrows.
---
He said the "knock your socks off" stuff was a secret that they couldn't talk about.  The secrecy, and  not specifying what he meant, leaves the viewer to interpret what he's saying any way they wish.  It's not possible to say he didn't mean when he refused to specify  ***what he did mean.***
---
Bud..I'm always up for helping lower levels..I will donate a decent melee weapon to you to help. Psn is pirateglenn1
---
Yeah, I had a pipe pistol smg drop in concord early on, and it was just silly.
---
i agree its the same BS you see at the game launcher if I feel the need to see game news I will look it up and/or come here....
---
Thanks for spreading the word! Just in case anyone was trying to farm one, now they know. :)
---
Do you have multiple characters? Maybe you read a plan with 1 character and tried building it with another.
---
&gt;The panel is definitely not talking about this dungeon. 
---
  He said the "knock your socks off" stuff was a secret that they couldn't talk about.  It's not possible to say what he didn't mean when he refused to specify ***what he did mean.***
---
Don't listen to them, you can. There are ways to spawnblock ofc, but just keep on alt f4 rejoining.
---
Oh I'm Xbox... But thanks anyways
---
Ah shucks. Good luck out there bud
---
&gt; The week before: 8000 threads about repair kits that forced a pinned thread and booted the ‚Äúknown issues‚Äù thread from the top;   
---
That we never got an official response to I might add, still waiting
---
It isn't exactly a nice thing to do, because if they are poorly built you are being a bad person... but you can just run to the high level. I did it a few times when I was low level, and as someone semi-geared and perked up I love it when lowbies gather the mobs for me when farming.
---
There's still ways to work around that, but yeah that'd be way more involved. I do remote desktop for games, when I'm away like that too, and I'd figure I'd share.
---
I'll probably have to make a new character to do this, but I'm going to check and see. Thank you so much for the information!
---
Lol you too üëå

Yeah when I first did it, I like having options. But as I got to level 111, I'm starting to realize that I could have other perk points go to other specials. Like I'm missing out on some serious adrenaline action.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the arktos thing 
---
Still is quite interesting
---
If you still haven't gotten the arm modded, I learned alloyed while scrapping a robot arm couple days ago. I can (or should be able to afaik) put it on for you if you'd like. I think it takes 6 screws and some other stuff that doesn't matter.
---
I read what you wrote, but was equally as confused because you didn‚Äôt include dates.
---
I‚Äôm assuming what you posted is what they tweeted yesterday (4/16) and that the first egg was available as of 8 pm yesterday (I got the egg then), and that there are only 5 hours left to get it today, not 5 hours left until they release the eggs.
---
Dude. I‚Äôm Todd Howard!! 
---
I‚Äôm so sick of you people getting it wrong.
---
We can't all be mind readers can we and have to take people at what they write.
---
Sort of like when the community managers at Bethesda write one thing, creating all sorts of expectations, but what is delivered is another entirely.
---
Then I say to people, by all means, have at it.
---
You complain to the same people that they should stop complaining - its entertainment at its finest.
---
Labeling it a dungeon is incorrect... Just another location for sure.
---
Sounds fun.
---
I want a sentry bot and a few assaultrons lol
---
My YouTube feed is the same no matter how much I select Not Interested.
---
‚ÄùThe Day Bethesda Died For Me‚Äù ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ
---
Next they‚Äôll be filming their rants while nailed to a cross.
---
I love that bug. I hope it never gets fixed.
---
I went back again today... Got some good loot and 2 legendaries. Just a good location to grind.
---
Cobalt is useless without stabilizing materials though.  White Springs is where I have had the most difficulty farming the mass and fluid needed to stabilize it.
---
Thanks... I was wondering about that.
---
They ignored it and the sub was just taken over by the next controversy and the outrage shifted, taking the heat off that one. If it hadn‚Äôt gotten so bad that it warranted its own megathread it would now just be buried by ‚Äúboss too hard, dungeon too easy‚Äù
---
Welp, I don't have any modern consoles, but I know the hard drives are replaceable (at least for the moment). There's ways to attach it externally or put it internally into the console.
---
I think they will.
---
Okay, so I wasn't tripping, I actually was not able to add the extra claw to my gauntlet, yeah?
---
Bloodied Swing Speed is the best I've seen right now. Bloodied is so fragile though (20% health).
---
I got mine at Appalachia Antiques when I got that as a Biv quest. Did have to server hop a few times.
---
just happened to me also...
---
Jacket &amp; jeans are found as a spawn in multiple places around the world, the cap may be rarer though
---
I mean you‚Äôre telling me that I said no one should ever had negative feedback about a game ever so I guess you‚Äôre comprehension isn‚Äôt superior enough to grasp that I‚Äôm simply complaining about the entire sub being taken over by one new issues every week and burying all the unresolved issues that were previously treated as just as dire and game-breaking
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start
---
The keypad door works for me. It just happens to be on the wrong side of the door.
---
Maybe we should look in the winchester where bethesda probably spend most their time waiting for shit to blow over, lol, but in all seriousness i agree, this sub likes to go mad very fast about any change
---
The VTU Jacket and Jeans spawn in the frat house now and they do count. Unsure what else there is. There's a VTU Baseball cap but I think that's still rare.
---
Yes! Thanks to your information we can get them all!
---
Cuz its not 8 pm eastern time
---
Nuke it.
---
Nah lol
---
Do you seriously not know what a terms of service refers to?  It's not a design standard between developers.
---
That is also true
---
Wow that sucks, was really hoping for something difficult
---
Whys it only out at 8?
---
I too had an ex like that 12 years ago, which gave me a hard time seeing my two boys, I wish I had Fallout then but I can understand the pain, as for me I have a knee injury and I off work for 10 days so I did a lot of fallout in the last week and average 1 level a day.
---
I appreciate the info.
---
I logged in today, &amp; asked myself...‚Äôwhat the fuck?!‚Äô
---
Lmao.
---
Thanks again!
---
Apparently it gives you passive xp bonus too. Not enough to really worry about though
---
Idk, thats just wat they put it as
---
I still farm and loot trying to optimize my character for the eventual vault raids. I still do events hoping to catch those 5-10 plans I am missing for my camp. When I get bored, I level up a new character to re-experience the lowbie fear. I build them a different way too, so I can experience a wider variety of ways to blow up my enemies.
---
So what its basically a new white springs
---
Three words: Fuckin. Bring it. Since smashing my way up to lvl 83 thanks to double xp weekend (which was AMAZING), I don't come across a huge challenge very often. Even soloing the burrows only took 15 minutes. So I'll say it again, BRING IT ON! Deathclaw hatching in four base would be tight. Maybe if you could take one while it was still little all have it as a companion while it grew up? Idk I'm just spitballing but either way I hope they hatch.
---
Well I like to be seen and hopefully these help you out.
---
Damn that's the big frick
---
I live near a farm on a pond with a fishing pier.

---
The Brotherhood of Steel would like to know your location
---
I am! On XB1.
---
thanks, always thought Jacket &amp; Jeans was a rare reward from daily quests and events
---
Also check the sub-stations scattered around the map, they seem to spawn ant as well.
---
If you nuke Harper's Ferry doe is affect The Burrows?
---
There is actually no possible way you have done everything when your only lvl 47
---
Wetsuit or BOS Officer suit are black. I can do both psn sbax77
---
Basically, no. If you're in PvE, the extra CW negates any lower stats because of consumables / looting. 
---
(unless you want to jetpack punch / axe / hammer the SBQ in the face, while she's flying and you don't want to build a battle tower)
---
Try freeze grenades and cryolator when its visible it slows it down, but honestly if you dont have people hitting the beacons it will always fail. I run my tse 50 cal with cryo grenades and seem to do well. Jumping around with marsupial helps too.
---
I've had this issue since I've purchased the game about a week ago. My friend that has had it since release has said it was an issue since Beta never fixed. We are both on XB.
---
You're safe by my standards until you hit level 50. Then it's "Ad Victoriam, give me your workshop or die" lol. I'll even help you defend yours if someone is trolling you. I love killing trolls.
---
I do this as well. I have 2 blueprints set up for the workshop. 
---
One is a missile/turret platform (2 of these can defend the entire yard from almost any NPC attack). 
---
The second one is a mini-camp w/ all the crafting stations sitting on a foundation.  
---
I set it up and leave everything unlocked. Hopefully someone's found it useful.
---
Not sure how but I read another post claiming you can freeze the Sheepsquatch the same way.
---
Is that an Always Sunny reference?
---
That's really cool of you, thanks!  I ended up giving it to my husband so I'll let you know.
---
Do you have adrenal reaction?
---
Xbox here as well. I pretty much gave up on my melee character because of it.
---
Used to be, but since the Biv quests its a common item
---
I'm getting really tired of being called a shill, a Bethesda employee or told to stop sucking Todd Howard's **** just because I tell people to calm down and stop spamming the same crap over and over.
---
Yep, you should specialize and fix your build. Personally I have options but my main strength guy is Heavy weapons / melee (skipped shotties). High str , int, low medium everything else. 
---
If I were in your position, I'd make a secondary alt character for a rifleman-- as that's a lot less respecc'ing to do-- but if all you want to do is rifle, then it is time to dump stats out of melee + strength.
---
you can press T to read news again. We don't need it to be here every time we log in
---
If it was locked at one point and then someone else picked it, everything after that is still stealing because it still technically has a "lock"
---
Definitely a good grind location I'd say, especially with the ghouls, since I mostly sell whatever drugs it drops and ghouls seem to be #1 on dropping them
---
Only music I like is "through the looking glass" (from evil within) intro it's on classical music.
---
I keep coming across him the most, I've never seen the insult bot.
---
Since Beta? God that sounds horrific, and here I thought I was going crazy from having it for a week üòÜ
---
I'm on PC (probably should've mentioned) so it seems its not just a PC thing either...
---
Go to harpers ferry and look for the water droplet in the circle map markers head to those and you'll find manhole covers. Go in and walah burrows
---
I picked up a nice melee weapon at path of the winds.  (death tambo). 
---
I forget exactly where I found the hardened sniper rifle.  Laying on a rooftop in the Forest.
---
Those were my gotos for quite some time.
---
Some high levels drop legendaries in overseers caches, the suitcases at train stations, or sell to vendors.  
---
In a few more levels (around 27ish) consider white springs - non nuke will be easier - in a nuke, it‚Äôll be tough, but you can survive, especially if you go with a friend.
---
If you fast travel there, go in the door, down te stairs, and hand a right. check some of the vendors inside. They will likely have some lower level legendaries.
---
One of the ghouls in the golf clubhouse occasionally drops a L20 vampire machete - i used that for 20 some levels, and still carry it as a backup.
---
I've been having  that issue with VATs melee more often lately. 
---
Regular smack what I'm looking at melee is working ok for me (not perfectly, but reasonable enough for me.)
---
If they don‚Äôt have something to complain about then they haft to go outside.
---
Yea me too I have to hit them multiple times before it registers and it gets me killed most of the time
---
2 Moths, 1 Vault Dweller, risky click
---
You keep on dumping cryo weapon on them. Cryonades/mines/lator debuffs the mob slower and slower until they're almost an ice statue. They eventually thaw off, so keep on firing more cryo at them.
---
Its underwhelming but has promise
---
I think the thing that really damn's the game's "hard" areas is the overly simplistic enemy design.
---
1 on 1 there are no particularly hard enemies, tedious and made of sponge, but they are as mechanically simple at level 100 as they are at level 1.
---
Scorch beasts are actually reasonably complex opponents, they summon minions, have multiple ways of attacking, and can force you to adapt to them. If they weren't so abusive of certain unfun mechanics they could be great.
---
Give me glowing mega ghouls that revive other ghouls, and hang back using radiation to heal allies and attack at range, something that is like a mini boss that changes how you play ever so slightly, do you rush the boss, or do you hammer the minions into unrevivable paste one by one. these used to be a thing in 3/NV.
---
As good as it sounds to start a new character, I really don't feel like it. I think I'm just going to move points from intelligent ever so slowly. And then once I get that done, then move stuff from strength. Because like I said, it's not bad having both. But I could have really good stats on one instead of both builds being just above average.
---
Imma add u I'm at work but I'm always down for queen runs
---
Weapon artisan makes overrepaired (yellow bar) weapons do more damage and do less as they break, adrenaline, adrenal reaction mutation, etc all affect the paper doll damage.
---
Don't worry about it too much, and keep your weapons repaired with weapon artisan... and learn the game's dmg buffs!
---
I've had an issue with mostly non-vats, but I did notice a lot of easily connected vats-melee hits not registering today
---
So annoying when it *is* vats not counting though, considering it should pretty obviously count when its melee and 95%
---
I also tend to equate gaming trends to other forms of media too as a musician. If you get a dope record, you spin it over and over, if for no other reason than because it‚Äôs just good.
---
Agreed it would be nice to have sort of a quick swap load out for perk cards (without having to mod) that way I can go from farming to scraping to PvP quick.
---
&gt;i mean anyone who expected free content to be at the level of paid DLCs like far harbor kinda set themselves up for disappointment
---
I don't think anyone expected something that fancy.  The more or less expected what was pitched: an endgame dungeon where it's hard to progress from point A to point Z.
---
Nice! Thank you :)
---
Have you eaten or drank anything, take a nap? play an instrument? Well hydrated and a stomach full of glowing meat steak with the above should raise your numbers, pop a Fury and your ready to go. Those numbers go up and down due to many characteristics with your character and environment.
---
Too bad I can‚Äôt play F76 for a while :(
---
Yep, 47 is basically a baby. 470 would have more credibility, but still really not even that high. 1470-- yep that person I'd believe.
---
They spawn in yo mama's ass
---
 vanguards heavy combat armor since you don‚Äôt really pvp in adventure mode
---
Yea, PC is probably less common than console's so you didn't notice it as much. It's terrible on XB. :(
---
Lol well do you run and attack or do you stand still and attack?
---
It's amazing! Plus the update seems to have forced many more creatures within harpers ferry to become legendary as well. I did a run through both and found a dozen of them. I'm not exactly waiting with baited breathe on the legendary vendor though. Saving them takes too much space, lightweight or not (though I understand most people dump them on an alt), and like all good dlc content in this game, I expect it to come out later than the 100 days roadmaps says. Anyways, nuking harpers ferry is now a treasure grove better than WS. And it's right next to my house so it's been great getting xp and nice legendary drops.
---
That‚Äôs when the store resets
---
Yea I‚Äôm lvl 57 and I still have like 7 side quests I haven‚Äôt done yet it is mainly if you like exploring after completing all the main quests if you do you can find some interesting side quests
---
That's precisely what I'm saying. Removing them from the legendary table is about as easy as hitting backspace, yet despite the constant outcry, it hasn't happened. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving all the positive changes being made, but come on...this keeps dampening gameplay while being such an easy fix.
---
Why do you feel the need to comment that
---
Honestly best thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub
---
Look at his comment. Moral of the story: don't argue with someone on Reddit who thinks they're right.
---
Make him the cutest that I‚Äôve ever seen
---
As with the sheepsquatch, there are just as many threads dedicating to complaining about the complaining. 
---
The real problem is that people keep taking sides.  Bethesda isn't our friend giving us free content as gifts with no strings attached and the game is far from perfect.  Bethesda also isn't an enemy and the game is not ruined, especially not by one free bit of content they may have failed to live up to.
---
People tend to forget the grey areas.  We're also discussing video games on a *upvote/downvote* forum, so there's that little box of joy to keep things stupid.
---
I nuked it earlier today and had fun at it. Only a couple people came in so it respawned the ghouls only twice but I had a good time.
---
\&gt; you will not be able to defeat 
---
Not at all undefeatable. Exploit their AI and weaknesses. Ghouls, can only melee, and can't jump. Use that Z axis height and rain death from above. If you get really frisky you can melee them down with the right tactics. 
---
That said, if there's high level players around they're usually going to kill everything on sight. Feel free to run to one of them and use them as shields.
---
&gt; In case you haven‚Äôt humbled your ego yet, no one is responsible for catering to you because you jammed 600 hours in less than half a year and got bored. You account for about 5% of the entire player base.
---
"A lot of the more vocal complainers are either exaggerating or flat out lying"
---
Xbone here as well. I pretty much gave up on my melee character because of it.
---
Country Roads
---
Message someone to join your game and will trigger the enemies to respawn again, was alerting inside when it happened to me.
---
On the opposite side of the spectrum, we also need a middle finger.
---
Good to know man! Holy crap, I could gotten jacked for 40 cobalt flux this morning. No more of that nonsense.
---
On one of my first sessions I saw 2 guys in these uniforms helping people out - it made the game for me! Love it.
---
Lol it really is that simple.
---
I was a bloodied melee build, but the only endgame armor I could buy for caps after searching for days was BOS combat unyielding sentinel, so I‚Äôm in the process of grinding to go from bloodied melee PA to rifleman w/o PA
---
This game has the best community I've ever met in my time of playing multiplayer games
---
YIKES. That would have sucked so badly. Glad you avoided it!
---
Ive also seen this exact post before...
---
The normal barrel is like a flamer. I have a two shot with 33% vats hit chance and the crystalizer barrel so the range is more than doubled. You just keep firing
---
Right? It's hard to know all the ways you can get taken advantage of in the game so now I know not to join teams. Thanks for the post! Very helpful.
---
You're getting downvoted but I just wanted to let you know there's at least one other person out there who appreciates your comment. My thoughts exactly.
---
At level 280 I completed the personal matters quest.
---
Gets my heart racing just thinking about it
---
That works too. Just wanted to help someone get around Bethesda's screw up. Either of you can probably learn it for yourself. I haven't scrapped (or found) much robot armor since I've never been interested in it. It popped up on a piece I'd picked up by accident and was just about to sell to MODUS but decided to scrap instead.
---
Yes! It would be great if we could send them out to collect resources too.
---
It‚Äôd also be incredibly deadly... that shit was hard to best without cheesing it.
---
Give me one example of another game that dropped new content that consisted of a 1 time, 10 minute mission and new location with nothing new added. 
---
Please
---
Did anyone try and see what's behind to doorway that's underwater?  Crashed last night and didn't get back to it
---
I'd rather design no game than one that gets a 50% at MC.
---
Ditto
---
Someone can use "pacify" on the queen to get her to sit still too. She still attacked but she sat in one spot. We just did it last night.
---
Feck I'm on vacation
---
Most players I‚Äôve interacted with have been amazing. Pretty sure this is a rare occurrence, but I think it‚Äôs just a general good rule. No teams and maybe only meet at a neutral place: 76 or Overseer‚Äôs Camp. No more individual camps.
---
Yeh I'm in exactly the same situation with the sacrificial blade mod, thought it was this specific mod until I came here, this is bad news.
---
Rifleman without pa is a little hard to say the least, I run marine combat rn even tho it‚Äôs not the best I play by myself typically so if I attract mobs it hurts
---
Thanks man I was wondering about this
---
BUT WHERES THE NEW CAMERA??? THATS WHAT I WANT TO KNOOOOW!
---
Rofl that would be cool too but I wont get my Hope's up for my personal scavenger bots anytime soon, as cool as that may be and all.
---
Or maybe just maybe you turn your mic on and just say what you want
---
Thanks. That's exactly what I needed :)
---
Bethesda has built-in aimbot (‚Äòvats‚Äô) for those who can‚Äôt aim, really there‚Äôs no excuse man ü§Æ
---
I play a luck based build that can barely be called a build and really don‚Äôt see much challenge in 76 unless you consider bullet sponges such. Shrug.
---
Gotta say, I've never gotten more than 4 legendaries, but I am modestly sure not all the ghouls respawned, because the entry section was awful quiet.
---
If you'd like to see them in action and how they should be perked, check out Captainoob on YouTube. He tests weapons extensively in his reviews. He fights every enemy that you can reliably find, including a Behemoth.
---
I just think it should be within a few hours, no over 12, I mean maybe even set up an EU server so EU players get better connection
---
New character with a different build. Do it all over again. My alt is level 50 and hasn't even started the main quest line. As this isn't Fallout 5 I don't consider the quests a measure of completion. A lot of people's initial frustrations were due to a disconnect between their expectations and what we got.
---
Is it sentinel or cav? Do you have all the DR perks and DM perks like iron clad and serendipity respectively?
---
I think it was delayed a week due to some issues.
---
I'm just logging in for the Easter eggs :)
---
* Thunder Mountain Sub Station TM-02 just north of Watoga has a random encounter that seems to spawn frequently where a death claw is fighting off some ants.
---
* Anecdotally, I've seen ants spawn more frequently in the Cranberry Bog overall.  Check the antique shop and surrounding area North West of Watoga.
---
* The Tea Time event at the Giant Teapot can spawn ants to attack the pipes/boilers.
---
Floor decor, and then go down to the small sized PA statue, scroll to the right and eventually you'll see the egg!
---
I can totally agree. I try to acknowledge that there certainly are problems and otherwise only post when I see things getting really out of hand. My complaint post isn‚Äôt necessarily just about the dungeon but the constant cycle of post volume, and complaint posts included (yes I see the irony there). I think that would make it a complaint post complaining about complaints regarding complaint posts about complaint posts.
---
Thank you so much!
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah, 99.9999% of the time people are actually overly generous in the game. Hell, I found traders in survival mode once and they didn't shoot at me the whole time I made a trade, helped keeps mobs off my back while I was there, and even dropped me a free legendary. People in this game are like no other. Then theres that 0.00001% that likes to come in and crap in your daisy planter. It is what it is.
---
Don‚Äôt want to sound like an idiot, but what‚Äôs the Warren?
---
Xbox1 yes it also happens to me. Is a grand pain in the arse. Half the time I just cancel v.a.t.s. out of frustration, but then accidentally hit another player who is (probably) having the same issue.
---
I know it's crazy! It's as if "people" was (wait for it) more than one person...
---
I use to at launch and beta. Worked until people started using to to initiate pvp
---
I dont think you quite understand what this guy just said lol
---
Absolutely loved that dlc.
---
They closed it.
---
New quest added this week, near harpers ferry, dont worry, it is new.
---
Sorry I can‚Äôt get on by those time. I work evening shift and live in PST timezone. I can be on 1am PST. Or try during the day tomorrow.
---
omg its the cryptid basename from west virginia, basenames are gonna be the hardest enemy
---
Gold &amp; Silver for complaining about others complaints and for stating the obvious... I take no one on Reddit seriously any longer, bunch of kids and babies crying about kids and babies... Please get over yourselves.
---
False Equivalence fallacy. They argue that the truth must be in the middle somewhere, and any who do not agree are inferior. I see that shit everywhere, and it drives me nuts, because there are times where one side is factually correct, but the other side gets so much support for their horsedrops because of the middle ground garbage that it renders any hope of resolution moot.
---
I always carry a flare gun on me!
---
But I forget to use it when I am in trouble.  I did use it quite a bit as a celebratory firework after completing the Faschnaut Parade.
---
Buy them off the market
---
Ill buy the healing factor thing
---
I feel like with some or most of the duping now taken care of, the flux is starting to dry up. I see way less selling now and much more buying. I've gone through most of my Reserves. If that's the case, the player price should be moving towards the vendor price.
---
can the eggs be traded?  i'm missing out on the first one due to the game refusing to function.  i'm on ps4 and the game boots, hits the sign in screen, but every attempt at signing in results in a total crash.  tried rebooting my whole ps4, everything i can think of except for downloading the game again, as that would take the better part of two weeks on my internet.  the menu says i'm fully updated.
---
I used it during the parade, to celebrate at the end and before the toads attacked.
---
No problem! Took me a long ass time to find it yesterday haha
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Extra psa: encompass the east side riverbanks in your nukings as there are 2 megasloths (and my house) there which I loving farming on so whenever possible go throwdown with those baddies too for extra xp and drops (when you get both I usually get about 15 screws and springs)
---
Yea shot a few one time when I was surrounded just drew on more
---
PS4 gonna play tomorrow 
---
I can msg u when I‚Äôm ready
---
Know what else speeds up workers? Whips. We could improve productivity three times over if we were permitted to whip layabouts!
---
I got a little external ssd drive that I run from a USB port on the ps4 slim and it made a big difference to my experience, I play with people who still run it from the original HD and I load in much  faster than them. Loading used to really annoy me but now it's OK.
---
finally a french emote
---
I think the last update mentioned fixing an issue with ranged vats against moving targets so your percentage chance to hit was finally accurate.
---
If it's under maintenance, or the server is down it'll show only the items you own.
---
That's the union(?) uniform, it's supposed to look like that :)
---
Probably daily maintenance to add today's Easter egg.
---
The two I found actually had a box of screws positioned between them...  I can't recall where I saw them though.
---
I‚Äôm level 218 and if you‚Äôre disappointed in the burrows then you didn‚Äôt explore enough. Me and one other around my level did the quest together and spent some time grinding the spot. We had our nuke run interrupted and didn‚Äôt feel like doing another silo run last night so we never got to see it nuked. However over all we found two or three 3 stars and a hand full of 2 and 1 star legendary mobs every time we went throw it. Remember not everyone is level 200 not every new content drop is going to end game content nor was this dungeon ever advertised as such.
---
I have herbivore. Its not too bad - you can still eat dog food, pork and beans etc. Probably nothing with the word 'meat' in the title.
---
Don't know about the radstag benefit - didn't know about that.
---
I can totally relate. Fallout 4 helped me a lot when I was going through my own divorce. Good luck and see you in West Virginia ;)
---
I uesed on early in my game at Whitesprings first time I saw glowing one's outside a nukezone. Like 5 players showed up and i was very suprised and thanked them over area chat. Not one of them saw it, just showed up to farm. It's a nifty idea but loses it's novelty quick and not worth the weight to me
---
On XB1, also having this issue
---
Down vote would disagree but I knew it was risky üòÇ.
---
We stopped that practice a long time ago. Now we just import people from 3rd world countries and let them Western Union the slave wage that we pay them back to the shit hole where they came from.
---
I didn‚Äôt down vote
---
I found two on two separate occasions in a duffle bag south of the southern watchtower to the West of Watoga. It's next to the cliffs under a wood scaffold in a camp remnant. Its not 100% but finding it twice on different occasions warrants a trip there just in case.
---
Mine didn't disappear. I have a single frame with full compliment of T60 I haven't used.
---
Last time I used PA was to jump off a cliff at toxic divide, heading west.
---
Just curious why do you need to buy PA plans? Anything special you‚Äôre looking for? Watoga has a bunch of PA spawned all over the place, a few hops will land you a full set quickly.
---
Add me highlyunknwn420 Xbox lvl 25+
---
Yes. It effects only food and hp. You still got all other benefits like +20 carry weight with radstag meat or any other with other meats.
---
Somebody forgot to harvest their daily dose of the Mothman eggs and now they've hatched ;)
---
For real man, the more vocal portion of gamers are ridiculous.  Just look how butt hurt everyone is at Epic for having their own launcher.
---
Launchers didnt exist period for the vast majority of my life!
---
It'd be cool, but I'm sure Bethesda sees it as some duping thing. There's no easy way to leave people things. A mailbox tagged as Owned would be awesome, if only you and the Owner could trade items into it.

I am an idiot.

Thank you for letting me know.  :)
---
Going to delete this now.

To be fair, "Use the search engine" is not always an easy answer. Generally, searches show up for titles but not content. So, if some absolute mook gets the highest voted statement of how to fix a technical problem, but titles it "PSA: Bug Fix" instead of "PSA: Fix for issue #33985", that can screw any attempt at finding answers if soemone does not know the right thing to search for.
---
... Not to say there is any justification for that kind of shit when the answer is *right there on the front page*.
---
I want the 7th day surprise to be a chocolate deathclaw from fallout 3 about to give your a death hug
---
Lol you're not an idiot, no worries! I would have assumed it was a back pack, too, if I didn't have the outfit
---
You still get the benefit of grilled radstag with the herbivore mutation. It just doesn't fill you up. I assume you get other meat benefits, but I know about the radstag specifically.
---
Hell yeah, we just failed that run (damn queen left the map) but I'll probably throw another nuke tonight.
---
I see at least one sub-30 on every server, sometimes a small pack of them. But I also tend to go places other than Nukesprings or the new Nuke Burrow and the nearest related vendors. I also tend to return to the Flatwoods area regularly for post-event inventory cleanup (if I have a known pattern, may as well drop it in a container for a lowbie to find).
---
I'm level 100+ and I find them all the time.
---
Probably available at lower levels. I have found them in duffle bags @ the golf club and even treasure maps.
---
For ‚Äòtagging‚Äô grab a shotgun or tesla and go to nuked events, turn on Pacifist mode and blast away, for sure you will land a few pellets or a bounced zap on the creatures. Don‚Äôt try to aim or melee them, too slow, when there are many high level players around they get wiped out too quickly.
---
i‚Äôve lost 2 pieces of armor while in PA. seems to happen after fast traveling
---
Div 2 raids coming out, hurry up and buy div 2 noob
---
same. I was running Uranium Fever with a low level alt and a level 135 joined - I don't have a mic but he waved me over when he was on a legendary to make sure I tagged each one.  love those interactions and love paying it forward
---
I hit lvl 95 last night, and while I do take breaks from the game to play other games at times (like MHW when there is an event of interest to me) I feel there is still plenty to do within Fallout 76.  I have at least one or two more side quests left to finish (and am looking forward to the new ones being released), try different things with my build/gear (currently found a nice LMG and have been playing around with it), and enjoy exploring the world to find all the things I haven't seen or have missed in my travels (sometimes its amazing what was missed when you were more focused on other things).  I also enjoy playing with others when I have the chance (my wife, daughter, and some friends all play and are at different levels).  Sometimes I set myself a goal of hunting down a particular plan or item and do that as the start to every day I login (I don't generally server hop, though if I am dropped from a server or logoff for a while I will go and check the places I learned to again) and then just see where the day takes me after I check the locations/do the dailies.
---
Go back to ingham, there's a possibility someone else requested a code after you. Pain in the butt I know.
---
Yeah, you missed the 99 other posts about it
---
I assume they'll add the radiated lights from Far Harbor at some point in the future into the atomic shop.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
For my current character, I started quests after reaching lvl 50. By then, i always had 2K-3K caps.
---
Fast travel for 15-30 caps to finish a quest, no problem.
---
Just sell the trash rewards and other stuff along the way.
---
Try again?  
---
I might be wrong about the time but you should have about 30 minutes to get the first egg still.
---
If you miss out, you miss out. It happens.  
---
I think you‚Äôre just worried people will have something you don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not something to worry about, and if you want an egg placed in your camp, ask someone to place it for you. It‚Äôs okay.
---
Rad resist seems pretty worthless to me because every power armor reduces radiation damage to 1 rad per second in nuke zones anyways.
---
Sure ghouls do rad damage but radaway and rad-x are plentiful.
---
Appalachian antiques
---
Make time for gaming or dont. No excuse. Honestly i will miss eggs because of something i have to do.  No i don't cry.  No i don't need an app. If you go home everyday then you do not need an app. If you don't go home everyday,  maybe you should or you just miss out. Priorities. my gaming is higher on my list of priorities than yours simply put.
---
That bot never leaves me alone. Struck him 3x this week ( meaning he always pops up behind me - I don;t hit him).
---
That messenger event - I won't do that again. Got no reward and then he told me to bugger off.
---
[Obligatory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F614uU3DsqM)
---
No idea how the servers work here (been a while since I 'dabbled' in that area).  I'd be a bit surprised if there wasn't already some kind of semi-localized servers for other areas, but anything is possible.
---
Last I heard, they were using Amazon web services, but I'm not remotely familiar with how that works in particular with regards to application hosting and localization.
---
I found quite a bit of junk especially lead and steel.  I was able to sell 1400 caps worth of junk and legendries to the vendors just by thoroughly cleaning out the entire dungeon.
---
Nope - not telling you that you said that - can you kindly point out where you claim I made such a claim? 
---
It seems to me you have greatly exaggerated what I posted, but from reading your replies I am honestly not surprised.
---
I love the whole "You're comprehension isn't superior enough" - complex much?
---
Also - I'm pretty sure its "your" and not "you're", but hey what do I know. Most likely my comprehension of text crafted by intellectual people such as yourself is not up to par.
---
Yes, you are simply complaining, about people complaining. You claim to be worried about all the space it's taking up and how it's taking away from other more important issues, but then again, how is yours any different? 
---
As I predicted earlier, the irony of it all is completly lost on you.
---
Also - yes I do sign some of my posts, and emails, forum posts, letters, birthday and Christmas cards etc.
---
Just a habit i guess - I am sorry if that somehow offends you but to be quite honest, I couldn't care less.
---
Yours self-importantly 
---
Oh yes. This has been happening for a while. BSG probably never going to get fixed... What should be one hit kills ends up costing you damage because they don't register and the enemy can get a free shot in.  If the monster is a yao guai or Colonel Gutsy that can really take it's toll if there are a bunch of them.
---
It would be even more fun if it targeted a random AFK player and popped up right when they got back.
---
* The actual button you use to fire the weapon is going to vary depending on what system you are playing on, refer to the in game controls and help to figure out which one that is.
---
* Make sure you have the right ammo type for the weapon you are holding.  There's a lot of different guns and a lot of different ammos.
---
 A dog butt to protect the home
---
I believe it does. Best thing you could probably do is upload them to your Xbox or Onedrive if you're wanting to keep them. I'm not sure if there's a way to return them to Fallout 76 so they can be used as loading screens etc.
---
Make sure to craft film everyday then! üì∏üòã
---
Agree and I‚Äôve been saying since release that all ‚Äúbroken ‚Äú challenges must be done on purpose to limit the free atoms they give away there has been always at least one up to all challenges broken before.
---
Sad because this would add a nice 200-300 atoms weekly.
---
And we have been online since what November ? Go make a count
---
bruhs about to have the thickest quads. You should probably break it to him they weight a good amount.
---
Get the best deal you can with that bloodied handmade, sold one myself not long ago and got way more gear than I expected.
---
Yea I told him to roll with a few at a time lol
---
The real frustration is when you manage to kill some guys well above your level, and the loot is:
---
* The same kind of junk you normally find
---
* Plus a weapon that you cannot use for +25 levels
---
I got a new code but I can‚Äôt do the ID card reader because I already used the ID‚Äôs. Do I have to do it again to get them back?
---
There's a perk mag that decreases the crafting cost. Almost a requirement for unlocking radium mods.
---
Beth, look $$$
---
You are missing out on $$$
---
Come get your $$$
---
Toxic valley has a good supply of radscorpions. And the radscorpion horde event. I was able to get 14 in one run.
---
Wheres So-Crates and Beet-Oven?  Strange things are afoot at the Circle K!
---
I have a good vanguard, stealth piece. My character is stealth commando. I save that piece to eventually build around.
---
Also have 2 pieces of chameleon, mix and match of ghoul slayer, mutant, etc.
---
Interesting thing is level 2 sneak with a good armor mix is just as good as bloodied. Especially if you aren't getting hit and have vanguard.
---
You don't mean legendary do you? I can make the normal stuff for you if that's what you wanted sure
---
Yeah, for personal use you can do whatever you want. If you were to put them on the Nexus they would definitely get taken down. And yes, they're standard ba2 files.
---
I think it would be awesome if they hatched into little baby deathclaws! They‚Äôre probably like ducks and impress on the first thing they see.
---
But the silo isn‚Äôt even difficult, it‚Äôs just a tedious ammo sink.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been swinging and hitting and seeing no health gone. Mole rats that I usually one shot are taking two or three sometimes as the first couple don‚Äôt register, but I still hear the sound of a good strike connect.
---
I don't believe so. But I managed to sneak this mission in while everyone was doing Faschnat, so I only did it once.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Xbox, i notices it before but I feel like its gotten worse over the last week or so. Not game breaking but kind of annoying when every thing that touches me gives me a disease.
---
What do you mean done? As in quests and missions? If, yes then you are right, it is not possible but I am talking about something else. I am talking about the fear, the worry and thus excitement I had at the beginning. Now, I have everything that is necessary to survive and I fear no creature or anything. Sometimes I am too lazy to kill some mutants level 36-50 that are shooting at me so I just let them shoot at me because I know they can‚Äôt kill me, the damage is negligible. And my hammer is just too OP at this point. There is almost no terrestrial creature that I have to triple hit to kill in the whole Appalachia. It‚Äôs either one-swinger or two.
---
I‚Äôd recommend server hopping to spawn the Charlestown vendor bot. One of the other random locations at that spot is mothman. When you see him, he‚Äôll just run away, but after that he starts stalking you. I‚Äôve seen him 3 times in the past few days because of it.
---
Oh ok
---
This... is old news
---
I thought the same thing!
---
Do suppressor weapons not work in PA?
---
ESAD
---
It‚Äôs the first time I found him, maybe there‚Äôs someone who he hasn‚Äôt ran into, I‚Äôm sorry.
---
Try closing your fallout application completely or even rebooting your device and check the shop again. You should have about 20 min as of right now to buy it.
---
Weightless leather for me. I'm a sneaky snake and am somehow always close to being over encumbered. It's not the best for combat, but meh.
---
I'm glad someone said it. It's getting frustrating seeing people complain about the game not being difficult when their level is several hundred.
---
Definitely an Easter Egg for sure. No pun intended lol.
---
He's not immune. Blocker, Fireproof, dense mods will immediately block half that damage easy. Stack assassin gear or some of the other legendary effects. Oh, then there is Lone Wanderer and Serendipity and...do I really have to keep going?
---
My point is, there are a dozen ways to mitigate damage to nearly nothing. Calling them cheater because you don't understand the game is a bit ignorant at best
---
Pretty sure not - they are C.A.M.P items you build so to speak rather than items in your inventory.
---
All three of the regional power plants have a fusion core processor. If you don't want to slog through the "Powering Up..." event (which also supplies power to certain other areas), you can also just build a Fusion Generator to run the processor manually.
---
&gt;ek due to some issues.
---
It was indeed
---
Need the hide all keys option. Or put keys in a separate tab than other Misc items.
---
The mutation to turn you into wolverine is a decent alternative to regenerating gear. I got that serum from another player and ditched that regen armor quick styles. Both are out of combat regens. 
---
There is a perk card to do the auto stim as well. Depending on your load out you may be able to get rank 1 of that instead of getting it on armor. I'm torn on that thought process myself.
---
The terminal in the room next door allows you to turn it on
---
Well the thing is I don't know if the item you get for owning all 6 eggs something I want or not if it's a skin I probably will if it was something I didnt care about I wouldn't be upset
---
If you look at the turrets, you can find their name, and message them that you dropped stuff for them.
---
Mic?
---
Jumped onto reddit to see if i could figure out where my damn egg is - answered in the first post i come across - sometimes you just got to love this place.
---
Many thanks for taking the time to post the info.
---
Like a pip boy app for checking inventory and stash, along with allowing purchases from the atomic shop. Which people have been requesting for months
---
He was talking about the arktos pharma stuff
---
Just the normal stuff! Can you Direct chat me?
---
If you kept hitting the same wing, you could have crippled it. I use an explosive shotgun w demo expert and enforcer to cripple her and keep her ok the ground.
---
I just got my animal friend perk up to 3 and noticed that the option does pop up for her. I‚Äôm too low level so I was wondering if she was able to be pacified at all.
---
Only thing i can recommend short of redownloading the game is to do rebuild the database.
---
See [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-your-playstation-4-faster-database-rebuild) for instructions.
---
Figured that was the case. I don't use the perks for hacking so my skill is 0. Lame. 
---
Zero reason for me to be taking radiation damage.
---
And here‚Äôs Red Eye with the hit single: Baby, Quit Raidin‚Äô My Heart.
---
https://youtu.be/HYyg1hRL4cU
---
‚ÄúUgh. I ain‚Äôt gonna lie to you all. Love hurts. It really does...I mean, that‚Äôs what my friend said! Then I wrote a song about it...whatever.‚Äù
---
Loved his radio. I can only wish for a Raider radio that has the same vibe that red eye gave to be in Appalachia.
---
PS4 also.
---
I have plans for most of tomorrow evening,  between that and work, my next opportunity to play for a reasonable amount of time is going to be Friday, likely no earlier than about midnight - but Fri and Sat, I‚Äôm usually on until at least 4a..sometimes longer.
---
Fair warning, I‚Äôm too overloaded to fast travel, so I walk everywhere. 
---
Bonus there is lots more opportunity to discover stuff.
---
My current position is about the middle of the ash heap, and my plan is to go to WhiteSprings via the taxidermy shop.
---
IIRC, my GT is aj ninetyeight (L63).
---
You know what would be dope? Let's say all the refugees from vaults and outlying areas come together to make the new factions (have them take over the old forts and stuff from the old factions, start out as the same names and the like), then have them morph the ideology of each faction into something new and different. 
---
But what I want to add is this: what if at the end of each year,and then from then on every 2 months or so, we could have Extinction-Level Raids where essentially each faction declared war in one way or another on Appalachia. You get a quest starting that such and such faction is trying to spread their grasp on the area and you have to go quell the movement of their frontlines by killing off the whole dammed lot of them. Then, slowly but surely, more settlers will come into their area and take over, rebuild, revamp the ideology of the faction, maybe change the name, and start all over.
---
I've had this happen with gamma on older games.  If there's a windowed mode option that might be worth trying.
---
What about fight mechanics?? When your game is simply a shooting gallery of course it's going to be hard to balance.Why do people aassume needing weapons or buffing hitpoints is the only way to balance a game??
---
Oops, sorry, I probably fell back asleep. GT Jay Kateel. I‚Äôll probably be available tomorrow afternoon for a bit, like 3pm PST
---
Nope they are atom shop items. Cant trade or build anywhere but in your camp or workshop. Once they are gone you loose the opportunity to get again.
---
Now it wont even load the atomic shop...
---
Yeah i spent 10 minutes looking for him and I thought it was some super tiny npc because I couldn't find him lol
---
Chems and violence!!! Sex and violence!!! Chems and violence!!
---
I'm hoping to at least get some cash out of it. I need all I can get because according to this game I have expensive taste.
---
Have you ever traveled as far into the core as Whitespring?
---
Don't mind Frito, when I manage to catch them while calm, they're reasonable enough, but once they get riled up, it's like reading a post by someone named Karen on Tumblr.
---
As I was reading it I realized (since I don't ever really use chems when I play fallout games) I hadn't seen jet in a while lol
---
I never said it was a simple formula you‚Äôve just made it quite clear. At level 70 you should not have struggled in that dungeon. Also they talked about this as though it was targeted at the hardcore players and it would seem reasonable as the entirety of the game is currently casual friendly.
---
Who said no aid would be needed? Did at any point some tell you they took literally zero damage? Obviously you‚Äôd use a stick pack or to even a few creatures. As it stands you can spam 30 stimpacks and be near imperial for a moment. I think they should add the one stim at a time mechanic from survival into adventure or most content can be trivialized by pure heal spam. Regardless this dungeon is still not hard nor was it worth mentioning over the side quests released the same day imo
---
Damn, hope you reported him. That‚Äôs fucked up.
---
Never mind I got it just in time 11 minutes left I still think they should have made it so a new egg appears each day but the eggs will stay for 2 days or so
---
I'm more confused by the "Press a button to start", wtf? I've already started the game, why didn't you take me to the menu already?
---
Saw a post about a fix next week (? ) - patch 8.5 which will fix it ( from BGS ) today.
---
When I was your level I tried to be as stealthy as possible and scope out what was ahead.  If I see enemy way over my level, I'd see if I could lure them off one at a time or separate them so I could slowly pair them down.  I also didn't go to Whitesprings or Watoga because it was way over my head at the time (still getting a feel for the game at that point).  If you decide to jump into the higher level areas you're gonna get wasted every once in a while which is not necessarily a bad thing, just prepare for it (stash junk, etc.) and you'll level up pretty fast without losing too much.  If I knew what I knew now, I would do the leader of the pack event as many times to get a decent legendary weapon/armor set going then start tackling Whitesprings then Watoga (I waited to lvl 50 to go there for the All-Rise quest and excellent super-sledge legendary reward).
---
I dont know about it being fun, but it definitely is decent xp. I probably dont like it cuz I've done it too many times.
---
It's a terrible user interface experience in general, feels like I'm treading water trying to get into the game.  As it is I just hit the tab key repeatedly until everything loads.
---
Damn it, I thought you said the first one came out at 8. Now I'm racing the update clock to try and log in in time.
---
Herbivore is better than carnivore. You still get all the benefits of meat such as extra melee or extra carry weight you just don't get any food value from it. I found that it's much easier to find things as a herbivore than a carnivore. You run into blackberry bushes about every hundred feet or so so that's really easy to scrounge. You don't have to hunt a blackberry bush, but if you're looking for meat you have to hunt it.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. What‚Äôs it called? GT Jay Kateel.
---
I just do the partials. I never do the 100% repairs. It takes too long.
---
Fix coming - patch 8.5
---
bet ill take some :)
---
Oh yes, same hat. I‚Äôm content with the way things are going so far. I was even happy with the Burrows just cuz I was happy to have a new place to explore and new lore to read, I don‚Äôt need any huge challenges to placate me. I just like being a lone wanderer with a whole world to explore.
---
Disclaimer: Not to say anyone is wrong or not allowed to be disappointed by the Burrows. I do agree the marketing was misleading and I understand why some people are mad. Just saying that personally, it was something I had fun with.
---
Turrets are so good as of the range buff. I love them now.
---
Nice. Teddy bears picnic indeed. Tossed salad is definitely on the menu.
---
You should just be able to get the codes from nukacrypt and as far as where to put your nuke it might be good to throw it on the new burrows dungeon.
---
Whitesprings and harpers ferry are good picks.  If you do prime for queen ensure you have people willing to join and help her.
---
Old post but, I agree entirely. During the beta my friends rushed through everything to be ‚Äúworlds first‚Äù (even though they weren‚Äôt recording anything and only had word of mouth as proof) while I took my time to explore, read and listen to everything I could. Partly because I live in WV, partly because I was interested in the story
---
Everything fell into place as it progressed. Questions were answered. Asses were kicked. The works. At several points I had to stop and explain everything to my friends because they would be like ‚Äúwhy are we launching the nukes? It‚Äôs stupid that they just let anybody do it‚Äù and had to explain that we‚Äôre there to stop a hypothetical Kaiju, and that we tricked the system into thinking we were Enclave
---
I think it‚Äôs that mentality of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs gonna blow up next‚Äù rather than ‚Äúwhy is it doing that‚Äù that so many people miss it. And it‚Äôs also the complete disregarding of the story by game ‚Äújournalists‚Äù that pisses me off
---
All yours :)
---
Just use the model from Skyrim Idc it worked great
---
Reset at 8PM EST.
---
Still time!!!
---
You realize this coincidence is too good to pass up on, right? You gotta dedicate yourselves to this through roleplay.
---
For insects, the mire has ticks and stingwings galore; I jumped from a workshop there down to any cranberry bog events (had census violence on the whole time down there) and did a loop: the fissure sites, the trainyards, the abandoned home, the sunrise fields and watoga (not in that order). Then travelled up again to repeat.
---
The wise mothman event is great  for bugs though, as fireflies count. Leader of the pack works great for canines, as does Death blossoms (a few rounds of wolves). 
---
Saw other players a couple of times, got shot at but events at least are a safe bet
---
world is full so im just in que for a min
---
RemindMe! 3:30 AM "Fallout Easter"
---
Some good will from Bethesda couldn‚Äôt hurt the community.
---
I also can not install a mod on power armor or weapon on Xbox one X
---
I liked it, was much bigger than I expected from the reddit posts.
---
There was another 2 guys \~100 (im about 120) inside at the time. The density could be a bit better, some rooms had 4-5 ghouls but most rooms had 0. A few "crowned" minibosses throughout would be nice, and the assaultron to be much.. "spongier" the gutsy horde at  the end was quite frightening considering the amount of damage those things do.
---
If this was instanced I probably wouldn't have had a problem with it's difficulty (assuming more ghouls in the empty rooms), minibosses would have been nice though.
---
I encountered several packs of 6-8 ghouls while I was wandering around. At one point I had a bunch of em with 2 Legendaries amongst them. 
---
I also encountered a 3* standing all by his lonesome as soon as I entered the sewer. 
---
I did only have one other players in there so maybe I had a mostly full set of em spawned?
---
I was dropping all my duplicate plans/recipes in the blue suitcase near the train vendor in Watoga and announced I was doing so over my mic. This one guy in in the Nuka Quantum Armor comes up to me after checking out the suitcase and opens a trad window with me and offers me the Nuka Quantum Armor Plans for free. I'm not a low level but it was really nice of that person to give me that. I try to help out low levels when I get the chance too. The community for FO76 is a lot nicer than a lot of open world survival game player bases.
---
Was the gun in your stash or were you carrying it? My friend had his x01 power armor in his stash box and it just disappeared
---
This is exactly what I thought when I saw "endless waves of ghouls." This is nice and all, but way beyond the scope of the game and it's available workers.
---
I almost didn't read the post, just on the merits of "Beth, this one's for free (wink, finger pistols)"
---
At some point one of the developers said something like, "I'd like to make CAMPs a little more permanent," and people are speculating wildly, IIRC.
---
I already got it with 11 minutes left I still think it should add a new egg each day but the eggs should last 2 days or so
---
There are dozens of us! 
---
I agree that there needs to be a mobile app, or there needs to be a store through the website.
---
I am a dispatcher who works 12HR overnight shifts. I go home and spend time with my daughter. She is only 6 months old so I might end up going home with time to spare to log in and claim, or I might go home and walk into a catastrophe.
---
Any eta when this will get fixed?

My GT is Arsenal iv. I'll help you.
---
The excavator is a bit weak compared to x01 or ultracite but it does the job. I'm always swapping between them when I get too much stuff. I have calibrated shocks on all sets.
---
You notice the difference against enemies. Need to repair excavator at maximum level  which I think is L45.
---
Dont I need all the pieces or something in order for the key card to work?
---
Yes this happens sometimes on ps4 as well, a power cycle helps refresh local memory on the system.
---
Carnivore perk works though, lol
---
Eat them humanoid enemies
---
Nope u just need to know the weekly code from the site and have a keycard and you're set
---
I did, but because *I* told him to go fuck himself in a message, *I* got communication banned for 32 hours. Nothing happened to him or his friend. I blocked all of them, changed my user name, and haven't been back since.
---
The one that's in the shop currently, is it the first one or did I miss one already?
---
Yeah, me too. I'm going to be gone over Easter, so haven't figured out what I'm going to do.

Create your own end-game.  There are a lot of tools in place with more coming, to allow you to play the game how you want to play it.  Quest markers, missions, even dailies don't have to be the end game.  The un-ending grind to get the BeST LEwTs doesn't have to be the end-game.  Running SBQ or nuking Whitesprings, or the Burrows doesn't have to be the end-game.

For me, I'm opening a bar.  I've visited Biv every single day to unlock all the drink recipes.  I've started scouting and cataloging the various locations around the map to get certain crafting materials, and have been stockpiling booze.  (You should see my spreadsheets I've made outside the game detailing this.)  Some ingredients are forever, while others decay and must be used more quickly so planning is necessary in order to be as efficient as possible.  I've been collecting the necessary CAMP plans, either trading other players, saving caps and buying them from vendors, or claiming workshops all over the map to unlock new plans.  I spent a couple hours the other day just building my bar in my CAMP, focusing on making it into a believable wasteland bar with a theme.  Once player vending goes into effect, I can even automate selling my wares to others.  I believe the supply/demand model will shape my inventory, and I can focus more on what people are buying or requesting to buy.

None of this is tied to any specific system in the game, but relies on existing systems to make my own experience.

* There's an upcoming camera, you could quit your job rebuilding Appalachia and just roam the wasteland, looking for interesting sights and documenting them.  Be a wildlife photographer and collect photos of every single mob in the game in their habitat.  Who knows, there might even be a way to display these photos in your CAMP and you could even open an art gallery detailing your adventures.
---
* You could set up shop right outside Vault 76, some location that every single newbie is bound to encounter.  You could be the vault dweller whisperer, offering free pimped out pipe weapons, aid and water.  Build some purifiers, grind bloodleaf and soot flowers to make Healing Salve, and just give it out.  Give those newborn wasteland babies a fighting chance.  
---
* Opening a restaurant would be much harder as most of the food items spoil, but you could also just scrounge all the pre-war stuff and sell that instead.  Make it look like an Italian Bistro, or a 50s Diner.  Or a Gourmand's Den... \*shudder\*.  INSTAMASH POTATOES ARE PEOPLE!
---
Point is, I think if you want to keep playing you need to come up with your own way to play the game, don't rely on the content that Bethesda releases and make your own content.  It'll keep you busy.

Roflmao!!!

Thanks for this! I would have missed it if not for you

Congrats!  You bagged a scorchbeast 16 levels earlier than I did!! Man, my first scorchbeast was at Whitesprings as a level 50 (All-Rise helping wipe out the ghouls pretty easy) - the robots helped a lot.  It was truly exciting!  Wait until you get to level 100+ scorchbeasts will be an annoyance more than anything else.  I usually don't engage and hope they go away, if they won't then I wipe them out for peace and quiet, but the loot they drop isn't worth the bullets to take them down.

Zero evidence of innocent players being banned.
---
Yes you can. I have a furious cryolator and it is awesome.
---
Once or twice when it was nuked
---
All you need to launch a nuke is a keycard and decrypted code, which generally gets posted online within 1-2 days after a reset. Heck, sometimes even sooner than that. 
---
You don't actually need any of the code pieces unless you want to try decrypting the code yourself.
---
It's been like that for awhile, if you're talking about it crashing when you enter the building, not just fast traveling there. What I do is enter another building, then go back to the penitentiary and it usually doesnt crash. I've had this happen with some other indoor areas too before.

There's actually some new assets in the dungeon. Quite a few, actually. But they kept to the design documents, so it blends in with the old stuff very well. The Burrows is actually quite well done... just somewhat empty, if you've run it after other folks. And frankly, most of the story I could find was tucked away in corners off the beaten path, which is not always helpful when you present the place as a "dungeon" which to modern gamers implies loot runs and relatively straight forward gameplay and story.
---
Ah, cheers for the update. I thought if had been over 24 hours and was worried it was some kind of bug.
---
Oh, well I have the key card lol, thanks
---
I sense a plot to destroy Whitesprings
