That sucks! Some games have a high percentage of misogynistic/homophobic douche bags... but I’ve been playing Fallout 76 since launch and have slowly learnt to love the multiplayer aspect of this game, the majority of people are just friendly and helpful and I’ve made a few friends just from talking on the mic.
---
---
---
I'm saying if it's modded it's worth at least 1000.
---
I have a mic I can use
---
not enough enemies and not enough bullets. need more of both. hard to compute?
---
That’s where my first spot was! right on the lake. now mine is a little farther down by the lake with the bees near the cabin
---
This is my favorite video game to date. Why? The setting, the camp building dynamics, the story and the ability to go on wacky wasteland adventures with my friends and also interact with strangers.
---
I'd appreciate more CAMP budget but it does have to be anything like the 400 --&gt; 1000 we got on stash.
---

---
I think an additional 20-25% is likely plenty.
---
I have a 3 floor 4x4 and even with 25 lights and a few duplicate crafting benches because of the theme I still have about 10-15% left after stored items
---
What are these eggs even for?
---
Despite being a more lonely, isolated experience, I find it more immersive too, and it wasn't until I went back to play Fallout 4 that I understood why.  I picked up inside Railroad HQ there.  Immediately, Mr. Timms starts babbling about safe houses.  Drummer Boy tells me to talk to Desdemona.  Synth Shaun starts lamenting about the topside for the hundredth time.  Carrington is being Carrington.
---
I asked myself, do I miss these NPC interactions?  No.  I can't say I do.
---
Collect all six (one each day for 6 days) and on day 7 we get a surprise item :)
---
Now I know where to put my scraps for future crafting.
---
And eye lasers
---
Totally different situation also. It doesn’t matter what you do or don’t do on a regular game because it’s all saved internally. 
---
On 76, it’s all saved outside of your system in the server.
---
It’s the anonymous aspect of online games, there are no real consequences.. and so people can be as rude/cruel as they want without normal repercussions
---
A 1* Legendary Fish Hook, sweet. Cant wait
---
I found a nest surrounded by dead brahmin and the thing started howling in the distance while walking near Harper's Ferry.
---
I immediately thought of that scene in Saving Private Ryan where they throw the mortar rounds after hitting the bottom against something.
---
It's a limited timed item :)
---
Was thinking this today at one of the fire camps, there was a mini nuke out in the open, but no fatman.  Hell my aim would probably be better.
---
Base damage for the Grognak's Axe is 65/75/85 for the levels 30/40/50.
---
good idea, poor execution.
---
it is an unarmed melee weapon. only one that i knew of that did was the meat hook. idk if it still does
---
They need to make all the bulbs lit up, or change the background metal color to something brighter than brown
---
Lol! She'd probably laugh her ass off, so no worries.
---
I think gauntlets, fists, claws, etc gets bonuses from "unarmed"
---
Just found the market sub. Going to post there and get some feedback, see what's on offer, then I'll get back to you. :D
---
I can already see the post; "Asshole shot my dog and killed him."
---
YEET
---
The dropping into the underworld seems to be getting worse unless of course I’m just paying more attention to it. I wonder if it’s happening where later underground dungeons vaults etc are built into game but not released yet. 
---
Recon scope marker though may prove there was an underground area there. Idk if you take Poseidon ever. It’s my favorite to take cheaply (I only use 38 ammo there) and top off on fusion cores.  But the mole rats and mongrel defense events ALWAYS have 1-2 spawn issues. I had a mongrel spawn within the walk just his head sticking in and out under the staircase. I tagged him and hit him one time and that pushed him back and I could see the marker moving within the building and then down back and forth and up as if there were stairs there. I tossed several Grenades up near the wall when he was near it and one ended up knocking him into a different frame and outside where I could complete the event. It was strange. But strange is fun sometimes. 
---
At red rocket had a scorchbeast land and lunge at me on the west wall holed section of the building and he hit me and somehow we locked up and my pulling back sucked him into the building. It then glitched not able to move except jerking motions. I of course cheap shot picked it off in between fighting off the second one in that workshops defend against the scorchbeast event. 
---
Happy hunting.
---
Bethesda does sell Atom Shop gift cards but I believe they only work on the PC version of the game, much like Shark Cards for GTA sold by Rockstar. For consoles, you are limited to PlayStation Store or Xbox Store credits, which are readily available at most grocery and Walmart stores.
---
I have to close and restart the game for the atomic ship to refresh. Try that.
---
yeah, i unsubscribed pretty soon after fo76 was released. No regrets :) fo4 is still mostly great tho.
---
How would that translate to, say, Bufftats with Class Freak 3 on?
---
Wow I was really considering getting that sign... I’m glad I didn’t now
---
We are on PC thanks!
---
Or a Fagsnachtch mask?
---
But to answer your question specifically, it is not possible to transfer your Atom points to someone else, regardless of platform.
---
What are they under in the C.A.M.P? I can’t find them
---
Thanks was wondering if I got my egg early and there wasn't one today, wonder why egg is so late though.
---
Meathook is only unarmed affected by 1 hand perks
---
It happens with all weapons, I'm pretty sure it's a glitch. If you start shooting from the hip and then continue shooting while aiming down, it will carry over hipfire aspects. If you are using something with a scope, it won't zoom in the scope (you will still hold the gun up in front of you and I think you will zoom in but your screen won't change)
---
I should have been more clear, I was looking to buy them and gift them like you mentioned. Thanks!
---
I think it gets down to 13% with max class freak. But dont quote me on that.
---
I think Iron Fist is what you need. IIRC, that affects “unarmed” weapons. But it only goes up to 3, so you’ll only need 3 perk points.
---
For the record I suck at specs, so high chance I’m wrong.
---
Floor decor&gt;same line as the deathclaw statue (PA statue and vaultboy gnome as well)
---
im telling you right now it wasnt duped. i know duping got popular around december on the sub but during the first 2 weeks the game came out it wasnt a thing. plus the guy i bought it from didnt have any other crazy stuff. if he had that kind of info months before everyone else he would have had a much better inventory.
---
I wish I could get behind this but some d-hole spoiled it in the title of his post.
---
I dont see any facts. Just one big opinion that almost all people so far has disagreed with.
---
I use maxed out iron fist perk and mine do about 230 base damage when over repaired. My favorite weapon hands down. I don't understand why they don't have expert and master levels for the iron fist perk. Anyhow, I agree a full respec option would be awesome.
---
Perfect. You can buy a physical card at Gamestop and I’m guessing stores like Best Buy. Or you can buy a virtual version online. 
---
I think it’s a nice gift. I’ve earned Atom points via challenges completing and of course the Atom Store stuff is the best stuff, especially for CAMP and even wardrobe. Plus, the Wiffle Bat skin for the Baseball Bat is hilariously awesome.
---
I had a guy do this to me a bit ago. He hopped to his camp before going to a nuked White Springs to farm with his friends so I knew were iy was. I went to another silo and dropped a nuke on his camp. Then I went to farm White Springs like I planed to in the first place.
---
Thanks for the heads up at the specified time, makes my morning tomorrow easier!
---
It might be the servers acting up or your connection
---
I can sell you a very nice 3* electrified assaultron sword to match your perk build. LOL
---
I dont disagree, they shouldve built their severs around it.
---
Don't question the downvotes, encourage more of them! People love to hate. Get used to it
---
Meant to mention that I've got 11 Strength.
---
I don’t think it’s that, this is the second day of it happening, I also redownloaded the game if that tells you anything.
---
I’m guessing it’s a moldy rabbit head mascot!
---
Frag them
---
Oh damn i guess I know what I'm investing in now.
---
it seems to be random, ive done it twice more recently.
---
I am in class right now. Once I get out I am starting up Fallout 76 for the first time! I got it all downloaded waiting for me to start up the PS4. So I guess the next thing on my to-do list is leave the vault for the first time! I cannot contain my excitement!!
---
99% sure theres going to be a new dlc/update/whatever in the future, where you can become president of the enclave or something (its in the games files i believe) and you have to rig ballots and its an event and stuff, ive seen people hack into it before n it looks cool i guess
---
I also think something along those lines :)
---
just be smarter and you can be a Demolitions Medic.
---
It’s already maxed out lol
---
Which would work with the body of the sheepsquach suit, the natty one
---
Yes they go up at 8PM EDT :)
---
Add me epicduck00, i also have grahm rn
---
&gt; Rainbow Six is more toxic in general
---
It's a fair bit more than in *general*. It's Siege for fucks sake. I do like the game, but between getting ganked by your teammates over quite literally nothing, or because you took "their" character, and then the servers being complete ass on console, I could only play that for a few months. Saying Siege is more toxic in *general* is like saying death by a vat of acid is, in *general*, quite a painful death.
---
I think it still is, and it only costs 400 atoms too. Meanwhile a fat man skin (where most of the design isn't even visible in first person) is 1000...
---
Switch it out for something else and carry that stuff? Sell some stuff off? Live dangerously as a human piñata? 
---
Sounds like you have to decide what you want more, the stuff you’ve been hoarding or that shiny new weapon. You can always hoard more stuff, the weapon is only available for a week.
---
From what I can tell by glancing around, nothing happens, but I'm eager to find out more.
---
If they destroyed your PA in one shot then it's an exploit, or possibly hacking if you're on PC. Used to be possible with bobblehead stacking.
---
Just getting one-shot in PA without the armor destruction is relatively normal though.
---
I thought demolition had 5 points
---
I'd also suggest martial artist which reduces weight and increases swing speed. Although, now that I mention it, I've never looked to verify that it applies to the guantlets.
---
You don't have to stay at the firing bench...get as close as you need before you blast them.
---
Oh my sweet fuck why isnt that a thing!
---
Nah it’s 6 (if u include when u first get it)
---
That’s been my experience. It’s the teen and even young 20something guys that are the worst. And this doesn’t even go for this game (I in general found I’m happier not talking to people in games years ago so most my gaming talking to people experience is in grand theft auto where there are a fuckton more assholes). The really young kids mostly were fun to play with except one bunch who I really thought needed better parenting (they really loved telling everyone they were going to rape them)
---
They should be free , wanna be stretchy add them as rewards to a quest like biv , Bethesda listen
---
That’s what other characters are for. 6 slots 3 decks each. That’s more than plenty.
---
I ditched first aid for max demoexpert. Its a noticable decline in healing, but im okay with that for superior damage. 
---
If im out running around with my Insta lever action ill swap them out.
---
Mine's fine, have you tried closing the app restarting it? That helps with some Atomic Shop issues :)
---
As bad as the principle of disappearing loot sucks, it was a level 32 ghoul, so the loot probably wasn't that good.
---
Yea I’d suppose it’d be a better choice considering my character is built around TSE
---
Female and on PC and there's no way I'm turning off my mic. I've had some gross encounters and heard some nasty things. I'm very glad for the reporting feature now. It baffles me every single time it happens. Is this a pure hatred for women? ...or is it that they feel invaded in their man's world? ...or just hate everyone and feel like the beat abuse for ladies related to their sexual uses?
---
I dunno...but I've had enough amazing interactions on mic that I won't allow them to chase me off and I hope you dont either
---
They’ve had a roadmap up for months showing us when new things are coming. I don’t know what else you really expected
---
I think this would definitely be a better idea than selling them. Add more small things like this to tide players over until more large scale content comes out.
---
THE NUKED FLORA!! I was finally able to craft my decontamination arch after someone nuked it today. Plus, it was so easy to gather the mass and fluids needed from the scorched instead of glowing ones.
---
Damage inxrease is noticeable as well. Few days ago took it off at camp for building cards and forgot to put it back on. Felt like my handmade was hitting like a limp noodle
---
[removed]
---
There needs to be this but like a football game you can play with power armor
---
Oh that’s rad! I hope it makes the social aspect more lively and prevalent. I’d really like to make a Hub for people.
---
Guy here. I remember during my early days of Xbox back during MW2's high point that I was third party to a couple guys harassing a girl in a lobby. Never understood what that accomplished, but it did inspire me when I met another girl on CoD. I remember it was over a match where this one little kid was screaming over his microphone for some stupid reason. She tells him to fuck off loudly and I just stop for a minute and say "Oh, you're a girl?" She responded with "Yeah, I'm a girl. So what?" I tell her: "I'm just surprised you use your microphone." Pretty sure that got a good laugh out of her.
---
Suit looks good. Appreciate the help
---
Drawing more attention to the matter is what should be done. You act as if staying silent is what some one should do when being harassed.
---
Cool idea, but why the 2 minute cool down exactly?
---
I'm not bashing it. Just curious as to what shenanigans you think rapidly changing loadouts could result in.
---
What level should I be to partake?
---
At least now you can invest in martial artist, blocker, and and incisor. All of them are better than just more damage in my opinion. It's unfortunate that you only found out about this just now though. I've had a few of those moments myself haha
---
I would assume it just works on the .44
---
Blocker perk negates his melee damage so it does nothing.  Grounded/scaly skin mutation and XO1 armor add up to 650ish energy resist so I normally Tank 1 or 2 pylons in bloody health levels with no problems.  Stimpacks every ten seconds or so.  The only issue is his beam can catch you off guard.
---
Such a shame, they basically have the same model too
---
AGREED. Talk about false advertising
---
These challenges sound pretty easy, now I'm really considering to try survival to get these rewards! I'm not into pvp and current survival challenges seem like a lot of grind to me. Also, the rewards are quite meh so I never even wanted to switch modes. Glad there are some positive changes to come -))
---
Had same issue restarted game and it fixed itself
---
Yes I found this out the hard way after swearing it was in another post. So embarrassing.
---
Liar? Really? What benefit would you get from lying. People are stupid. Have an upvote on me.
---
It’s a magic door
---
Some people just kill them for fun.
---
level up new character for party build? What a joke. Perk loadout manager started with 3 slots too. it was not enough for most of the people. Now it's 12 and everybody is happy
---
Tbf the hazmat suit has 1000 rad resist.
---
I didn’t know they could be killed.
---
Correct, I have it and it only works on the .44.
---
Xbox1 has a achievement for dying in the center of the nuke blast
---
what level are you i dont mind honetly
---
I find it interesting how you had over 900 hours on one account, then on an alternate account you got to 265 with 5x assassin/sent pieces. There are people I know who play everyday and still haven’t gotten remotely close to that level unless they have all exp buffs in survival and vertibot exploiting/seen that gear unless it was duped or bought and you have little transaction history on your account. Stop looking for sympathy and own up to being a illegitimate player. Not one person I know, knows someone who was banned for no reason. If you’re banned you did something plain and simple.
---
I'm actually glad it's back as I didn't bother the first time because my gunslinger uses a western as main gun but I've started using medical malpractice for those times I don't want to waste ultracite ammo so now I can pimp that out.
---
What is behind you?  Sometimes the game picks up on open gates nearby or ones you passed thru and shows that.
---
Happened to me as well a few times, very annoying. That's why as soon as i kill a legendary i just loot it all before even looking what it is
---
Oh, that makes sense. Honestly thought I had to stay on the firing bench.
---
At last, I'm going to be able to relocate my shalet to some other lead deposit! Sounds pretty exciting to me -))
---
Yup, had someone follow me through killing all the new ones. They aren't marked as vital and it doesn't seem to trigger security.
---
Swapping perks so many and so quick. Anything can happen. As well as the odd chance it could be messed with in pvp.  I doubt it could but you never know.
---
Never knew how much I wanted something til now
---
There are two models, one has five hundred and one has a thousand. But the point is even if you have a build that can reach more than either they still will always be infinitely better.
---
We should punt them
---
Hey. Yeah going to launch in in about 20 mins. Just getting my little ones to bed.
---
This is probably the best idea I've seen on here.
---
52. I tried a week or 2 ago and then the game froze before I could launch the damned thing. I'm still bitter, haha
---
So the same thing can happen here? Star with 3 and bump up I’d needed. Being what I assume is a pc mod. It only speaks for one slice of the player add that does use it.
---
You would not believe some of the things Ive found-- assassin explosive lever action, explosive reload minigun, sentinel armor etc.
---
that's awesome 😊 enjoy the ride!
---
For players to know to speak English well enough to sexually harass a female player, the majority are either located in North America, Australia, or UK where sexual harassment case is treated seriously. Also many countries are US allies. Bethesda will give out players info if there is court order and a TOS does not take precedence over the law.
---
Okay, thanks for confirmation
---
Tons and tons of violet flux.
---
If youre on pc add me (ign ulfyn) i have a spare t60 jetpack plan i can give you
---
For cobalt flux
---
Scorched critters are jerks (which I really think is a pretty good touch considering the story) so avoid them at all costs. I really wish Tamed critters would work like other items in your camp and let you have control of it to a degree, move them, store them if need be and erase them if you need room, would also love a sort of "recall" button so they would come to you when summoned as I've had so many pets just vanish and I have no clue if they're dead or just stuck under a rock so it'd be nice to be able to actually tell where they are or if they still exist.
---
Bloodied would change your life. And it's also the answer to your question. Take it or leave it
---
pretty big slice if ask me
---
Dude, you're amazing, thank you. Adding you rn.
---
Oh hey, I'm fairly certain we already have each other added haha
---
I used to live up there, one of my favorite places to live so far. Off the path, hidden water sources, no real foot traffic, nor horrific mobs.
---
Np man :) added
---
hop on in
---
I feel its mostly because the meta is pretty broad at this point in the game. Almost any weapon can be BIS. Its really dependent on the situation and your cards. 
---
I still do more damage with my Insta lever action than with my tse handmade. (At least for the first shot while sneaking)
---
I’m a girl and I only use my mic when I play with my friends :)
---
I picked up 24 on my way to the park.
---
Sounds like a blast.
---
But honestly if you're high enough level for the SBQ then you probably don't need those plans. I just load mine off on low levels. I had someone do that for me a while back and have been paying it forward ever since.
---
OMG!!!! thanks for the nostalgia! I do remember this, my apologies good sir.
---
I never bought money on GTA online, but I had a friend that frequently bought sharks cards at GameStop which worked with his PS4. If they sell the card at GameStop under other Console cards, I’m sure it will work.
---
Is this gone from the shop now? I'm only seeing the mini power armor statue. Thanks
---
I've heard it's the worst mutation. Doesn't work in combat right? So it utterly cripples you in nuke zones / against the imposter. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Hell, if it works in combat, I'll get it.
---
Each will be in the store. 1 a "day" for 6 days. (Today is egg 3). I say "day" because they change over in between days. Bethesda released the release schedule on their website :)
---
Did anyone claim it?
---
Omg I have only read the title but YES like what in Merlin’s nears where they thinking I thought I had placed it wrong it was in a wall but no the dam thing is just plain stupid it looked good in the build menu when it’s highlighted and then bam some illegible crap augh
---
Sorry i dont think I can play today. Would any time tomorrow work? Im really sorry
---
I was having this exact conundrum recently. I was holding back, leaving explosives at 3 until I found an explosive weapon. But I've been crafting nuka grenades and they're pretty stout. I have enough level-ups saved that I'm going to have both cards at 3, and a maxed out Explosives with a 1*healing so I can switch them out for testing.
---
Yeh, that's why I didn't buy it. Never use my .44 anymore haha
---
Unfortunately this did not solve the problem.
---
Boiled water
---
Canned dog food
---
I've never seen one in the wild but I have found them in random lunchboxes.
---
Gotcha thanks man!
---
Yeah shouldn’t be too bad with class freak
---
I was going to ask what's wrong with the current dogs, but you want s full on companion like dog meat. Yeah, that'd be cool.
---
My favorite was a few months back. I binged the game, starting at 10 am and (by some miracle) stayed on that server until 2 am when I finally decided I wanted sleep. 
---
By the end of it, I was the last one in the server. Took over ALL the workshops that I had on my map (wasnt fully explored) and had a great time (I would say blast, but i still have yet to launch a nuke at level 131).
---
I finally started ignoring the defend alerts. But I enjoyed that.
---
Haha I think so
---
If you place all 6 in your camp it summons the DeathClaw Bunny.
---
Iv always wanted some liberty prime power armor. Like a suit that makes you look like him and have the nuke rack, plus the option of eye lasers or your regular weapons. That would be bad ass, and look cool
---
Yeah, right after she legandaried the 2nd time I died and got an infinite loading screen, I didn't get to loot her.

Looks like I’ve only got 1 pyrolyzer, but I’ve also apparently got a generic Suppressor Flamer. Got a preference?
---
Why not really. Ignoring loot and mats - it's just awesome to watch a nuke make ground. I miss when the game was new and you never knew where that nuke was gonna hit. 
---
Nuke: Boooooooooooooooooooom!

what's your gamer tag?

I do, but I would like it to fire a bit faster then a semi auto.

Any time tomorrow would work for me i dont have school

I had a time a couple weeks ago when I was farming flux in a nuke zone. I fought a level 50 Diseased Scorched (third adjective I can't remember) Mirelurk Queen at the same time as two level 85 Scorchbeasts and didn't have much of a problem with them. Later I left the nuke zone and almost got wiped out by a lone level 40 something Assaultron Dominator. I only survived because I was able to get something solid between us and heal up.
---
6 eggs. 6 pointed star. Deathclaw. Horns....*Lucifer confirmed*
---
There u go dude :) i gotta get back to farming but hope its useful to you!
---
Even a 20% speed up would be enough. Doesn't need to be near the minigun. Just an improvement
---
I'm on XBox. So I don't know if that makes a difference.
---
It works great if you think of it more as artillery. You bombard your target from a distance, preferably higher ground. Use it to soften up a target then move in to finish the job.
---
Preach it sister !!! As a fellow older player , husband and father I applaud your fire and resolve  !!! this game has the proclivity to attract  the biggest ducking a@@holes ( don’t want to get  banned lol!! ) and it should not be a situation that empowers vile behavior that would make a female not want to play . My 26 yo daughter and I play all the time and have encountered similar nonsense but it’s not the norm on here and thankfully  there are plenty of great people just having a good time . To the young  lady that started this thread don’t  be discouraged by a few morons with inadequacy issues .
---
It's still funny how the game lagged because of my hoarding tendency.
---
Do you have a fertilizer?
---
I did much better with a basic AA 50 vs TSE. The extra recoil from the TS modifier caused more shots to be miss resulting in 0 extra damage vs AA straight ignoring half the target’s armor.
---
I'm on PC. I'm a guy. All the girl gamers I've run across were just awesome. I treat them with total respect, and I appreciate the things they have done for me. There are some people out there that are just assholes. Please don't let that discourage you from playing. I myself have run across players that just want to kill you and take your stuff. There are so many good people playing this game, and I think they outweigh the jerks by a far margin.

[PS4 Remote Play](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/ps4/features/remote-play/)

Unfortunately you can’t use a dualshock controller with iOS (although there are workarounds).
---
You can technically play the full game remotely, but it isn’t really practical. It does work great for the Atomic Shop.
---
:(
---
Did you get the egg?
---
**New in the atom shop!**
---
Why get rid of it ?, you have an accidental pet. As long as it dont attack you let it be. Your now the bird person lol
---
Does it work if you are in another city?
---
I plan on making a bloodied melee character at some point. I just don’t understand the mechanics of the bloodied build. Keeping super high rads without getting too much, keeping low health without dying, etc.
---
Are you on PC using mods? If you've edited your .ini so it loads modded archive files, and the game updates, your .ini isn't set to load the updated archives correctly, and issues like this can arise.
---
Oh whichever you're willing to part with, this character is like level 22 I think? So I won't probably be able to use it for a little bit, but it's nice to have it ready
---
Can't thank you enough, you're a hero.

thanks chad
---
Also if you slap it fast enough it will cook instantly lol
---
I've gotta gather some stimpacks but I'll try and find you asap
---
No worries man, happy its going to someone who needs it rather than sitting in my inventory for then next few months :p
---
That's reasonable. I usually go 250 per blip, but those are cool blips
---
I'll try to spend my workshop junk to make up for the aid space. (Stimpaks/dog food priority with pure water.)
---
A solid LMG (AAE maybe) might be okay, but with Stabilized you’re going to have significant accuracy issues.
---
The LMG is nice because at least for short bursts, it’s fairly accurate and puts a lot of lead downfield really fast, so you have a good chance of staggering your target. But it kicks like crazy, you can’t reliably get more than a 1sec burst on target at any significant range before it’s kicking all over the place. Still, if you keep it to 1sec bursts it’s probably a decent option.
---
I no Chad, my name's Quentin. Dad joke level?

Strange. I have the first 2, but as of right now, the Atomic Shop has none available? Usually it shows the one I picked up last. Hope this gets sorted out soon. I want my baby deathclaw!
---
Did you close and restart FO76. Often it won't immediately update if you're already playing.
---
Lol you can do plenty with the current budget. It’s your own lack of imagination and practice holding you back
---
My gear is good enough that I am more interested in lower level 3-star finds anyway :)
---
We lose handed weapons, we should gain nukes are grenades! Then again, that's basically nuka grenades
---
Look, I can’t even figure out how to fire a MIRV without killing my self lol 
---
How the hell would chucking mini nukes work?
---
I always go get a front seat. After I get my PA.
---
Just throw it out there and ask for caps.  If it’s worth more than 1k you’ll usually get a few bids.  If not you may need to set a price for someone to buy.
---
They already do negligible damage
---
Bloodied is already the strongest first star at about 70% hp, so you can play it casually and it's still good. Half hp is easy to handle with PA, which I assume you're using with a 50cal.
---
So it's basically "if hazmat goto life else die".
---
Awesome game design.
---
Hell yeah. I still rush to it as well. It's a pretty fkn cool thing for an online game. I remember loading a seperate save over and over in FO3 just to blow the Megaton nuke over and over 😂
---
I'd love for Bethesda to introduce a general skin pack for the weapons. You can find cans of paint in the game, so it would be cool if gave you the option once you got the skin pack to hunt down cans of paint to find the color you're looking for. Perhaps some paint can colors could be rare than others, but it would make preexisting items in the game world have a new life other than being a source of lead and steel.
---
I need that to craft Excavator calibrated shocks! Good thing I like nuked zones.
---
&gt;To any girls who play - do you just simply stay off mic?
---
Female player with a female avatar.  I've not encountered any sexism issues with other players in this game.  I'm sure it happens, but I've not personally experienced it.
---
To be perfectly honest, I'm pretty sure it has made other players more helpful.   I'm sure it happens, but I've not had it happen to me in this game.
---
If people are rude it's easy to ignore them.
---
Oh i believe it. Everyday when I log in i travel vendor to vendor and buy out all the 3 star items and save them for the tokens at the legendary vendor.
---
go long son! \*distant boom\*

---
With 3 levels of class freak it does reduce ALL chems effectiveness by 13% - that includes rad-x,  rad-away, med-x, buffout, grape mentats (you only get +4 CHA vs. +5) .  You can offset this penalty for Stimpaks by taking 1 rank of First Aid.  the mutation does NOT trigger in combat, only out of it.  
---
There are a couple tricks when dealing with this mutation, I have learned that taking Rad-away while having Starched Genes removes all mutations including positive and negative effects for a period of...mmm... I think 30 minutes.  So having some around when you plan to do a Grape Mentat selling/buying binge is helpful.
---
I have had had it for some time and while helpful after a fight, I am having some regrets taking it when I found out how many “chems” get nerfed.  I had originally thought it was just stimpaks, but as I have a stack of mutations I am hesitant to loose I am holding on to it for now.
---
Both? The answer is both. You have a iffy connection and bethesda didn't bother building melee for multi-player, so melee is only really reliable for combat if you have a rock solid connection.
---
&gt;dad there's a bird in the house
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A BURRRDDD, HOLY SHIT OH FUCK
---
&gt;you're gonna break everything in the whole C.A.M.P.
---
IM TO PISSED TO GIVE A SHIT
---
Right, everyone seems to be so sensitive about this game.
---
Sure am. Any advice on secondary affixes?
---
Mire Mirelurks
---
And then throw an INT right before you get the kill?
---
At this time of day, probably missed egg 2. If you restart game client egg 3 should be on shop. quick search would have answered
---
My sneak character is still in need of a decent instigating weapon. I found a 2 shot crossbow that is pretty fun with sneak attacks, but insta sounds way more fun.
---
I've never seen someone use triggered as an insult that wasn't a raging cunt.
---
Are you on Xbox? It’s stupid, but you have to shut down the game completely and then restart it. Should be in the atom shop after that
---
I would agree, but only if it is put in as a perk card
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL. LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED.
---
It is. Where exactly did I say it didn't have any major flaws? I think you're imprinting a preconceived opinion on me friend. Perhaps read my post? I only talk in terms of that I (Ryan) enjoyed the story of this game more than other fallout's and as such deserves greater merit. I also think launch was a disaster and the game was without a doubt unacceptable at that state. And I think this game would have benefited from live human characters. But you know what pal, I think God of War could have benefited from having Kratos' wife be shown alive at some point so that I had a firmer understanding and care for her. But I'm not gonna go trash God of War. It's one of the best video games of this generation, personally my favorite of all time. They made the absence of characters work. This game made the absence of characters work. Good attempt though.
---
Lol ok last time I checked I probably am so I don’t care
---
I always play as myself on my main character in every fo game since fo3. Couldn't make myself set off that bomb with my first character. My second run, I wanted to see it (saved for replay) and getting that sweet penthouse home.
---
I don’t think that Fallout 76 is one of the best fallout games (not even close imo), but as a long time fan of the fallout series I really do love playing Fallout 76. I did see that post and to be honest I agree with it in a way- a single player fallout game set in this setting before everyone died would have been great- BUT that doesn’t mean that the game that exists now isn’t still very interesting, immersive, and entertaining
---
Cobalt flux galore!
---
Sounds like you have to commit a fair few perks to running mutations.
---
Rad-x fully suppresses mutations for its duration too.
---
I’m going to check if I can rename Pyrolyzer, then I’ll let you know ;)
---
It's still there on another server, but a gate into Harper's ferry is about a hundred feet away
---
Yeah. Thanks man
---
Second egg is gone as of 7pm CST for me, third egg just went up.
---
Two active at FSP. Rfxcginnie
---
Mole miner gauntlet is over powered at level 20. You can take down level 60+ ghouls and level yourself.
---
They should have expected it though, building settlements was a huge thing in Fallout 4
---
Just hang around the racetrack north of vault 76 and wait for leader of the pack. I did that one twice and just about got the number needed.  As a bonus you can score some low level legendaries to gift out!
---
Or better yet, let us run them into battle like a super mutant suicider!
---
Charleston Charred Ghouls
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn...lol :P
---
Ok thanks for the advice guys
---
Thanks, that did it!
---
We went in to dungeon excited looking for a challenge !! They hyped it good so 4 powered armored knights looking to avenge their fallen brothers descended  into the depths expecting  hell on earth, tanky mirelurk queens ,tons of  glowing ones hell pissy tanky diseased rats even!! What we got required me to switch to my switchblade because we were annihilating every thing with our side weapons not primary, side !! What a massive disappointment not even a good mystery and another missed opportunity to expand the BOS lore.
---
Vendors. I got both of from Watoga.
---
Depending on level it's probably work 2-3k. That's a solid gun!
---
I did this as a level 90 with no power armor.  (marine armor)
---
It took me about 15 minutes to complete the quest.  I could have done it faster, but I took time to look around because I figured I must have missed something.
---
Beyond disappointing.   I didn't even get a quest reward, unless it was the sword I got (no on screen notice).
---
He made a wonderful response video to all of that that come out a day or two ago. He handled it like an adult and I don’t think any of the hate against him is really justified. I like Oxhorn and I love his fallout lore videos :)
---
Your welcome. Glad that was it. Any future issue you have with the atomic shop, try that first :)
---
That’s what I wound up doing. I just needed two more, and was passing near Big Fred’s BBQ Shack. My first camo was near there, so I knew foxes frequented the parking lot. I was just surprised that they didn’t count. Thanks for the advice!
---
Riiiiggght....i see what I did there....
---
I was doing humdrum stuff just in my own head while I was playing and then at the last minute I hear BEEP BEEP BEEP then I turn and got a facefull of nuke.
---
When I finally launch a nuke, I'm gonna hit the mothman museum. Why? Because I can.
---
My thoughts exactly, I just didn't enjoy any of the NPC's for fallout 4. Every time I interacted with one of them for the second time I would look at how and I felt and see that I didn't care at all for the interaction whatsoever. I had a couple times where I straight up thought, don't care fallout, this piece of code means nothing to me
---
I will 100% be there, praying fallout 76 doesn't crash me
---
which was egg 2?
---
Damnit to fuck. I checked yesterday at this time and egg two want up then either
---
ouch, that still hurts.    =)
---
Wow, that's really cool!
---
I've yet to launch a nuke, but I need to soon. I've finally got end game weapons. In 76, the world burns every couple hours or less on the weekends. It's madness, but I like it.
---
luckily i never even thought of buying it because i don’t have any friends
---
Hey! Fellow female PS4 gamer here. Also very new...been gaming for just over a year. The first game I ever played was fallout 4 (I know, I know I gotta go back and play the others) and now I’m hooked. I mostly play alone but would be down to meet some fellow folks to play with, it can get lonely in the wasteland. :)
---
Power armor functions differently than human limbs and would never work well for throwing.  I know Fallout is nonsense anyway, but I just wanted to share a semi-useless fact when I saw this thread.
---
Even if it did work the same way you're not hucking something that heavy as far as it needs to go.
---
Ps4 and I haven't been able to find the second egg at all. Checked multiple times
---
Superb idea
---
Depends on your purpose with it. Outside of a bloodied weapon, Furious is hands down the best for massive targets that take a lot of bullets to put down, like the Queen. But it takes 10 hits on the same target to reach full power; if you’re retargeting constantly, it’s going to have very low output relative to other legendaries. AA is decent, although it loses effectiveness the more other armor-piercing effects you have (like Stabilized, which is a keystone perk, you’d better have it). Two-shot is reliable, but the spread/recoil and condition loss can be problematic. Instigating is great on a Gatling gun, depending on your build you can reach one shot status with it against regular Scorched and other average mobs, and 2-3shot against tougher enemies like supermutants, but it’s weak against big boys like SB/SBQ.
---
Its called "ground zero" be at center of a nuclear blast.
---
I do think it's great, and I did play it for hundreds of hours. I just truthfully at this point in my time playing 76 am enjoying it more than fallout 4 at the same amount of play
---
Your a good person
---
now for 1400 atoms!
---
I'm on mic all the time and have had Zero incidents with anyone, male or female.
---
I have 800+ hours played. :)
---
Jumping in to your world now, see you there!
---
Mods are limited in level in certain areas, so you sort of need to stay in those areas or explore further at your own risk
---
Loooool
---
Did you even play before they made the changes to lighting?
---
So much additional room for activities!
---
Get rid of your turrets, lol
---
Yes I would love this too!
---
The recoil is Crazy!  You end up shooting into the sky.
---
It's probably got a lot to do with your level. I'm 143. But it's super easy for me to maintain 20% life. Nerd rage range. But whenever I was under level 75 I ran an instigating explosive build that served me well. AA explosive was pretty awesome too
---
Reboot your game
---
We have so much room for activities!
---
I launched my first only a couple weeks back or something. Solo'd it. Wasn't too hard. Went through a lot of stims navigating my way through the silo. It was very fulfilling. Unfortunately I couldn't make it to watch my own nuke land. Over encumbered lol. But yes beautiful madness :)
---
.308 kind.   
---
They had no idea about calibers when they designed this game.
---
I am inclined to agree with everyone else's view here, you could probably get more than 1k.  Remember that the value of items is subjective. Either way combat shotguns are cool
---
My dream 50 is a bloodied explosive, but I’m already a build that uses explosives, so I’ve already got 5/5 demo expert. Bloody 25% fire rate is probably second best, although depending on your playstyle bloody/10% while aiming may also be competitive (still solid damage with lower ammo consumption/reload frequency, and durability damage)
---
Thank you
---
Did that. No second or third egg. Think I may just be fucked out of eggs
---
That’s odd. Because I just now rebooted and mines there
---
I wanna chuck nukes farther than Baker Mayfield throws to Jarvis Landry on a good day
---
I got all three eggs but haven’t been able to figure out how to place them. They just don’t show up, I had the same problem at first with the posters too.
---
"Don't take away slap damage so I can destroy people's camp at whitesprings" is basically what im reading, I usually just close the door in the back if there is a camp there which surprisingly there never is. It's not really that huge of a problem for them to not remove slap damage from camps.
---
Egg 3 is up. Close and restart FO76
---
Do you know if you can buy egg two?
---
Furious does a lot more damage if you’re taking 8+ shots to kill a target, but you need 10 shots on the same target to reach full power (change target and the counter resets). If you’re constantly changing targets or killing things in 5 bullets or less, AA is better. 
---
Assuming AA gets fixed, anyway.
---
I swear the gun just went off like 8 times....
---
um sir it only has 6 shots
---
well yeah I reloaded to see what would happen
---
why....
---
FOR SCIENCE!
---
Try restarting the game. That refreshes the atom shop
---
I'm slightly surprised after checking it, because personally to me anti-armour feels a *lot* more powerful than in 4 - it was basically trash in 4 until you could get over 90-95% reduction, because a different effect would always give a better straight up % damage increase - but the same numbers from 4's damage calculations are in the .esp and they're set to the same values. It *appears* to be the same calculation from 4.
---
This doesn't mean the calculation *hasn't* changed, but I can't find an obvious alternate number for a new damage system. Checking the armor penetrating legendary effects, these have changed, but they should still give the same result of precisely halving the enemy's DR, not anything like making half the damage ignore the calculation.
---
Highly doubt it, they can easily have their own internal server and spawn nothing but three star Legendaries everywhere all day long, instead of being aholes on public servers.
---
Happened to me but I didn’t try restarting :( now I miss out on the 7th day item smh
---
What was the name of the 2nd egg?
---
The early nuke codes are something I don't like either because of how people get them yes. When I said unfinished it was more aimed at the end game content it unlocks. Sbq queen, which wasn't always smooth and payout could be a struggle. At the time the code cracking seemed like a mystery with little to no no clues and eventually mediocre to no payout. It was just a giant leap from the rest of the quests.
---
Any exploits like dev room are things I am not okay with as well of course. So I am not trying to defend that way of playing the game. 
---
 That's cool that you enjoy cracking the codes. Not a fan myself or the queen honestly. People trying to cut corners especially on the back of others I dislike too. Sorry if I came off entitled I try to avoid that kind of behaviour.
---
I'm a woman playing on PC with push to talk enabled. Over 200 hours in and no one has harrassed me. Fallout 76 community has been very nice!
---
But if we go into other games like WoW or Overwatch... OOF horrible memories...
---
Letterkenny Shamrockettes!
---
Explosive is the standard money-no-object choice, but I haven't done enough testing with explosive weapons to be sure about the pros and cons. Firing at close range may result in death or crippled limbs depending on how much Fireproof and Adamantium Skeleton you're running.
---
Seriously starting to wonder if there's literally anybody else playing this game that isn't 40+ years old with kids or the child of someone who likes the game.
---
Posts like this make me cringe and feel like I'm in a subreddit full of bots posting feelgood stories to make the game sound amazing. 
---
"Thank you, Bethesda!" "This game cured my cancer" "It fixed my broken relationship with my son"
---
Doesn't mean they're right.  Just means it's a big group of people agreeing with each other.
---
I gonna join too.
---
WOWWW. How simple. I'll take the 'have you tried turning it off and back on again' serious for now on. Thank you!
---
Honestly, it probably doesn't, and yet it's still cheating, and all cheating bothers me.  But that's cool, I'll accept that the community has accepted this (clearly a cheat) as OK, I just won't participate myself.
---
I literally just met one of the guys from the podcast in game. He gave me a marine helmet and was actually super nice!
---
Find good friends wave at the neutrals then shoot the hell out the people your talking about 
---
Personally I have been playing side by side with gamers of all kinds for almost 20 years now and just don't get why people try to do this. Personally I find it stupid and anyone who trys messing with my team mates generally find out what its like to be on the wrong side of a quad barreled homing two shot missile launcher (lord its fun watching them run from 8 missiles those things have insane turn radius makes me smile) 
---
Then again the people I play with are all hard core gamers so not like they need me to do much more then fire support I swear I'm more afraid of the girl gamers in my party cause they will hunt you down....
---
LBRaniero if anyone is curious
---
I mostly go through the northern entrance and I've never seen more that a 1 star legendary.
---
If it's explosive 2 shot weapons I tested that fireproof does help a lot (tested on vii turret since they use explosive rounds)
---
Restart the application
---
Is there a reason I can't even find the egg in the atomic shop anymore? I got the first one (flowery deathclaw Easter egg) but now in the atomic shop there is no egg to even buy or tell me it's owned.
---
I’m not really concerned about all the little enemies. Mainly just the bulky bastards like SBQ, SB and such. I have a furious 1* that I planned on putting a prime barrel on but I kinda want a 3* of some kind for that now.
---
no problem lmao
---
What's the PA statue?
---
And you're the only one right because of your opinion? Thats hypocritical at best.
---
Quit completely out of the game and restart it.
---
I bought it yesterday when it reset
---
Reading the rest of the article, I'm pretty sure it's just an error that that's *not* included in the projectile damage section. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance#Damage\_Reduction\_formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Damage_Reduction_formula) mentions all weapons depend on *RangeMultiplier*. It highlights a difference between them because projectile weapons gain some extra armour penetration from damage boosting perks, as they use the pip-boy displayed number, where energy weapons don't benefit from this because they use the base damage, which isn't affected by perks (but modding them does affect the "base" value).
---
I’m not sure if anyone mentioned it but the Easter egg for Day 2 did not load in the Atomic Shop for plenty of people yesterday. So these people will not be able to earn the limited item on the 7th day
---
Always have to restart the game entirely to get the atom shop to refresh.
---
Forgot to add all the bloodfern in the lakes is cobalt. Really good area if you need those two.
---
If you want budget space sell your fertilizer produce it actually eats a lot of space.
---
Was it a mod or a plan?
---
It never loaded for me. I checked multiple times, reloading the client multiple times. This gives me a sad.
---
Well that is good to know about the stacks necessary for Furious.  Thank you very much!
---
Mod.
---
I have no doubt that someone who dresses like an alcoholic sir topham hatt.
---
Thanks, yeah was just wondering why it got bombed instantly more than anything. Maybe I missed something.
---
That’s my biggest concern with running an explosive weapons given the amount of close range enemies. I feel like I’ll be gimped most of the time and have to hop around constantly with marsupial to avoid hurting myself.
---
You could probably get about 1k-1500 for that
---
Don't get me wrong because i love Fo76, but...  
---
It's time to fix **the game**\*.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's been 5 months.
---
Then play Call of Duty or something where thinking isn't required.  And the stuff about them hacking the game code is what people in-game told me, so if that's wrong, I'll apologize.  However, these same people clearly have put no efforts into ever finding codes themselves.  Is that the way the game was intended?  Probably not.  
---
Do I care that you solve problems all day at work?  Not at all.  And in the same vein, you have no right to cheat to get around something just because you don't like it.  Like I said, go play BF5 or something where the objective is clearly laid out for you if you want a game like that.  And honestly, I really don't care what kind of bad karma I get from my posts after today, because I've realized reddit is just a place for people who agree with each other to downvote anything they disagree with.  Does that make them right?  Hell no.  So I'll just not care.
---
Showed up fer me
---
Thanks!  I'll wear em with pride.
---
World full rip
---
I had a 3* in southern
---
I might try the bloodied path.  I’m 126 right now so I just gotta level up a bunch to get all the perk cards. Currently I’m built around a standard heavy gun build with a no PA unarmed build for killing random shit while building up .50 ammo reserves.
---
Nah bro, COMMUNISM fuckin' sucks.
---
Stop it, get some help.
---
It's there
---
*chucks small nuclear warhead*
---
I've been running with it practically forever and while Class Freak is nice I find that I can largely abate the negative effects of Healing Factor with First Aid and Field Surgeon instead. You will however want to ditch the Diluted versions of your favorite aid items (might as well be using nothing) and carry more Stimpacks in general (Travelling Pharmacy works well to abate the additional weight) -- especially if you're gearing up for a big fight (Sheepsquatch, SBQ, etc.)
---
Nah, I'm just not a dick like you and not some entitled gamer who thinks anything that's hard should be made easy for me or "wah the devs are shit."
---
But you know, you are what you eat. :D
---
I had to close and reopen to see it. Got the third.
---
Way off.  My IQ is 140 and I'm willing to talk to anyone who speaks in a reasonable tone and with a little logic.
---
&gt;In large groups, you simply cannot defeat the queen without having a god-tier build. 
---
The queen fight can be so buggy, not even the god-bois are doing any damage.  Lag causes everyone's shots to miss when she's flying around. Server-side, she can be a hundred meters from where she is on your screen. The damage registers at first, but then your client syncs back up with the server and she's "healed". More players = more lag. Point is, you're not losing due to a lack of bloodied god builds - you're losing because of bad netcode, high ping, server lag caused by dupers/mules, or all of the above.
---
&gt;Even TSE weapons aren't that effective against the queen (you need bloodied).
---
I think you may be confusing "effective" with "overpowered". You might "need" Bloodied if you want to do godly, cheesey damage that "feels" good.  But, people seem to forget that the event was designed for 20+ people *who are actively doing constant damage for up to 30 minutes*. You're not supposed to feel like you're melting her.
---
&gt;you say that having good legendary gear is basically ruining the experience
---
I said having "full sentinel gear and a TSE". That's ***six extremely rare pieces*** even rare among all other other legendary items. It is certainly not "part of the design" to require a full set of ultra-rare items in order to complete any event.
---
&gt;If the first dungeon raid was hard for high-level players, then everyone would be more than excited to team-up and improve their builds. 
---
I said "impossible", not "hard". If they released a dungeon that was too difficult for the average high-level player to enjoy, then only min/maxed god-tier players would enjoy it.
---
I would rate it 350 or 400 due to the only good thing from it (imo) is the 50% limb damage
---
What are some places?
---
The explosion effect is attached to the projectile, which is why changing it makes it explosive. If it's not changed from 4, which it doesn't appear to be, the pip-boy is tallying all the damage types attached to the weapon and displaying those - explosions and projectile both count as physical damage though, so get rolled into the crosshair icon damage type and can't be implicitly separated.
---
They do calculate differently, however: projectile damage figures in multi-shot weapons are for all the shots totalled, whereas the explosive figure is the damage that will be created by each explosion created, and it is possible to take damage from multiple explosions with the same shot. So if you can land all 8 pellets of a shotgun, 20% \* 8 = 160% damage bonus.
---
As for how that interacts with armour, I'm not sure whether each explosion is resisted individually, or the total damage is calculated first to be resisted. There might be some previous FO4 experiments floating around the internet, or it might just be that people said "does it matter with that much overkill?"
---
I'm sorry for you that sucks. But it could've been worse. You can still buy the jetpack. Imagine it was a very unique legendary weapon. I know it's very annoying but it's not the end of the world.
---
Hmmm.  If they actually figured it out, that's totally fine.  If they went into the game code as people have told me ingame, that's cheating.  I guess I was misinformed if they didn't hack the game code.  If it IS actually a collaborative effort to decrypt codes quickly using cards, and there's a process to it involving humans collecting the codes, then it's probably ok.
---
My and my buddy picked up copies.. getting them delivered tomorrow.. looking forward to it!
---
3 fucking hours is a long time for a smarty pants to respond must've taken all 140 oq combined to form that mixture of letters
---
I'd love to be able to craft higher level drills/chainsaws. They only spawn at level 20.
---
The fire rate listed in pip-boy is per ten seconds, if that helps. Though that admittedly doesn't address reload animation times, or quick-swap reloading black powder weapons.
---
I don't sit here trolling the Reddit forums all day, and you're not really proving your intelligence with this kind of shit either.
---
Not if they take off damage to camps. I got a 3 star 2 shot mini nuke launcher that does better work
---
It's the internet, I just ignore it.   
---
Anyways, thanks to everyone's hate on the game I picked it up for cheap and enjoy playing it.
---
Server is dying
---
Fireproof is necessary for tse of any kind close range ime.
---
Next thing you know some folk will be playing football in whitesprings and all you hear over voicechat is just
---
"AND IT'S A TOUCHDOW-"
---
*Sudden explosion*
---
disconnected on launch lol
---
I believe in the loot servers vs crap server theory. BSG appears to be constantly adjusting legendary drop rates or outright gimping some locations.  Yesterday I tried watoga EMS and actually encountered a legendary wendigo. I though it was gimped out of existence, but apparently has the 10% spawn rate.  Lately that place has nothing, so I was surprised..

Whitesprings.... Something changed but not sure what. It seems more feast or famine now. Monday, barley any legendary weapons or enemies spawned. Tried this morning and a *** showed up and dropped *** vanguard's armor and that was it. I usually get a ton of * crap with marginal potential before the patch. Coincidence? I THINK NOT. It could be the servers have been so bad that the RNG mechanic can't run or times out.
---
First of all, your question doesn't make sense.  But if you're asking why I think I'm right, it's because of facts, which I laid out above.  As I've posted to other people here, I heard the code was hacked from the game from people ingame, so if that's wrong, and Nukacrypt is actually a collaborative effort of players to discover the code which consumes keycards, then I don't think it's cheating.
---
For the record, I don't think I'm ALWAYS right.  I'm always willing to examine my opinions.  But I adhere unflinchingly to logic and illogical shit does in fact piss me off.  So like I said, if they didn't hack the game code, I take back my opinion on it.
---
Youre responses to other people on this thread leave you with little room for talking about intelligence
---
So as a dmg calc dude can I assume you know how stacking damage works? For instance an instigating super sledge hitting for 287 dr and 16 er would result in approx 600 ish damage right? But what if you have the legendary perk where power atk does 40% more damage? Is it 40% of the 600 or 287?
---
feels bad man
---
One of the reasons I love a bloodied build is basically you only have to look for 1 legendary type, it’s (almost) always best in class ;)
---
They switch them at 8pm EST.
---
whole server crashed as soon as he launched it, you didn’t miss much
---
Your spelling does little for yours. :)
---
Hey, do you know if AA still doesn't affect energy weapons? I have an AA tesla rifle and I'm trying to decide if I wanna toss it.
---
Cant join, you're offline
---
I know :)
---
And this is what im talking about
---
I'm just tired of Reddit is all.  People here clearly just echo each other's opinions.  And post dick comments to each other.
---
What'd you find out? I have an AA tesla rifle that I either need to keep or toss.
---
"Penetrating" in Fallout 4 was apparently only a 30% DR reduction, or +14% hp damage, compared to Anti-armor's 50% DR reduction for +29% hp damage.
---
I'm just going by wikis there though. I don't have Fallout 4's ESM to check.
---
And people are tired of you
---
Yeah because I started it with you.  I'm the one who came in here and insulted someone.
---
Random semi-rare spawn in most locations that spawn military helmets. Best bet are military locations or BoS locations.
---
I must be having a good night then.
---
Don't worry, the server shit the bed as soon as the nuke launched. Some timing that was!
---
Vault 76 Stooges
---
Fake news
---
Crap, I didn’t even realize I was. That’s my bad dude. The server I’m on just crashed a minute ago too
---
See that whole reply....that is an opinion. Facts are thing you can prove to everyone. You think youre right because of your opinion and a rumor.
---
not the first time it's happened and definitely wont be the last .   I'm about done for the night,   but I'll be launching 3-4  tomorrow starting around 8 eastern. Will definitely post a thread
---
a high dps weapon helps a lot, if you are a lv15 or higher, make yourself a handmade, you will get them on the first try :)
---
rip-a-rooney
---
So destruction and mayhem is normal... ahhh
---
I don't think sheepsquatch will pan out as far as rarity mainly because it's available. I believe fas- will be annual as well so our hording of the masks may be fruitful mid year. I'll grind sheepsquatch for a bit longer where after I'll just let it occur when it does and jump in.
---
reply to this msg or dm me when u do
---
What platform are you playing on,  I could make you one, if you supply the mats.
---
You hit the nail on the head. So happy to find one person to see it but to give some of the comments credit I did edit it because I didn't realize it sounded that way
---
Was datamined in one of the last two patches
---
why not play civs or an RTS where its all thinking then?  - i can throw off wild as well
---
whats wrong with people working together and helping others who are not as skilled in cyphers? is that what a coop based game had in mind? probably.
---
do i care that you enjoy cyphers? not at all, and in the same vein, you have no right to judge people who are trying to help people who absolutely hate cypher's or dont understand them to acess content, or the recipients of said help.
---
nothing you have posted has had a solid argument outside of "i dont like it so you are all brainless cheaters" despite having a community that is trying to help other users constantly.
---
advise: drop the elitist attitude, its just toxic to the community and helps nobody.  id also advise getting off the sub and joining r/fallout or r/gaming since you apparently wanna be involved in toxic circleherks
---
for sure, will do
---
Better yet, make it a skin for the pole hook...
---
I really don't see it as a cheat, either.
---
Lets take this to a slightly different use case. Say you're a spy.  There's a computer with a code and you need data from that computer. 
---
You can do the usual spy craft stuff, figure out their mothers maiden name, the birthdate of their mistress, whatever. 
---
or you can have a hacker do the exact same job and get the exact same result. 
---
Is that "cheating"? No. 
---
If you don't want to go to _any_ nuke zones, then feel free, but the reality is, if you go to a nuked whitesprings/SBQ, that you didn't launch, your "I won't use it" is bullshit.
---
Same issue. I missed the second egg because of the unclear rotation. Now I won't be able to get the special reward. Neat.
---
Nuclear football like el presidente! No more running through silos!
---
Im on ps4 what do they take?
---
Luck has nothing to do with it. Programmed drop rates. If i manage to come acrosd a 3 star, lev 60+ legendary spawned enemy i would expect, at minimum, a lev 40+ 2 star drop item. Even if i think that item is garbage/useless for me and my build. It's not worth the grind if all the drops fall well below the star value. Honestly, i would rather get random plans drop from from 3 star legendaries instead of garbage one star loot.  @Bethesda Remove wood armor from the legendary drop rates.
---
👍
---
It’s not hard to get...
---
Which makes me wonder... Are character builds affecting legendary drops? Someone thought luck &amp; perception might play a part. I have 12 luck but only 4 perception. If I boosted perception would I see more legendaries? Not really an option as I am a heavy gunner and need the points in strength, intelligence and luck. It would be nice to know though.
---
What's AA?
---
I know how to get it. but i already did the quest and sold it awhile back
---
Sorry, I'm on pc. They're not that hard to find in game but they are random spawns.
---
for that sweet sweet violet flux.  Someone's building T-51b mods maybe.
---
Ah, I see! That would be interesting. Maybe we could get a Mr. Farmhand for our camp that collects the milk among with crops, if assigned.
---
There's one next to the Grafton town vendor. On the desk, IIRC. There are a few other standard spawns but that's the only one I bothered to remember.
---
Alright, thanks for the help
---
The idea behind the level itself and the look of it is cool. The fact that it's not instanced, and that people have been defending it with ''nobody said it would be instanced'', is downright stupid, however.
---
Marketing it as a dungeon is also probably not their wisest choice. In Bethesda game terms, it qualifies as a dungeon for sure, although one sorely lacking in depth (named bosses/minibosses, for one). Oddly it seems to have its own soundtrack, which seems like a weirdly disproportional effort compared to the quest side of the place. I didn't expect much and still was left asking ''that's it?'', which isn't really a great followup to the ''huh, that's the end of the questline?'' at the end of the Lyin' Lowe questline from the previous patch.
---
Other than that, the level design is fine as always and the idea of a sewer shantytown is cool- which makes it such a shame that there's so little substance IN that level.
---
China is eh? lol? /s? ....
---
Anti Armor
---
Excavator cal shocks is why I need it. WS doesn't have that fauna apparently.
---
It's also insanely small I feel like, I was hoping it would be as big as the "WELCOME HOME" sign but it's like...insanely small lol
---
I think it's mostly VATS crit headshots these days.
---
That’s hot
---
Cool idea but since purified water sell for a nice price at vendors this free purified water fountain eliminates the reason to loot when you explore and would just lead to filling 200-300 bottles to sell and money problems is a non issue
---
This is a Fallout 4 primary hustle and would not be fit for online play.
---
Yep - we play with some awesome and respectful guys! They are always cool but from time to time someone joins us and believe me I am not afraid to set them straight regarding proper behavior if needed. I'm older tho and have no time for that nonsense. I would advise that you not stay off mic. You are entitled to the same fun as the rest of us and don't ever be afraid to take that. Also Silune who commented earlier, take him up on his offer if you can  - his group is awesome and so fun to hang with!
---
My opinion is the level and damage resistances of armor don’t really matter. The legendary effects do. 
---
I’d rather have some level one sentinel assassin wood armor than level 50 heavy BoS armor with trash effects.
---
That would be pretty awesome if you took the wheels off and painted it like the game stash.
---
Your entire post history is just you whining about 76. Take a break and move on, man
---
...and you would be the dick
---
So you may laugh at this but I was a rather low level when I first solo launched and I used Voice of Set throughout the entire place. I survived and launched.
---
Not weapon, build
---
I'm gonna have to use this idea, I've got way too many plans cause I can't stop myself from taking them, even if I know the plan and have multiple copies. It'd be nice to make sure they actually got used. Planta Claus is coming to town
---
Weren’t skins for cameras datamined recently? Where da cameras at?
---
 I used voice of set too lmao
---
it was actually really helpful!
---
I have unyielding wood armor
---
I’ve messed around with certain areas to have a cool built-in camp effect. It’s fun
---
Well I took my. 44, BUT unfortunately I accidentally scrapped my voice of set and can't seem to get another one 😔
---
It's a great game!  Unfortunately being kept away by a bug that constantly crashes it right now - but can't wait to get back online and rejoin the community.  A lot of people seem surprised when I tell them that the FO76 community isn't a toxic trash heap.
---
It's definitely vats crits. I did it earlier in survival. Then got 1 shooted a few minutes later
---
As long as you keep grinding, you will find good stuff. I’m only level 194, but I was once in your shoes. But I eventually earned/found some really good sh*t. You just have to keep grinding. I went from regular shotguns and combat rifles to Legendary explosive shotguns/rifles, to Legendary melee weapons and of course, armor. All I have in my stash box is Legendary gear. Mostly 2-3 stars stuff. No junk Legendaries. I still have my FIRST explosive shotgun I earned in a nuke zone. White Springs of course. I have two shot auto grenade launchers (2of them actually), two shot lever action rifle, two shot sub machine gun, explosive light machine gun, two shot Gatling gun, bloodied weapons, unyielding armor, Assassins armor, bos combat armor, the list goes on. I’m not trying to brag, other players have gear that I would ‘kill ‘ for. Im just saying that if you keep grinding, you will be fruitful!!!! Keep playing!!! And have fun!!! This game is great.
---
Please,.. Elaborate. Because I obviously don't know what I'm doing.. Lol I was a dead duck!
---
It used to be 400 atoms. I bought it last time (about 2 months ago
---
dang! I just got rid of mine today or I would’ve given you it.
---
When i launched my first nuke i used all rise as well and the excavator PA
---
Nothing is more satisfying than a two-shot Fatman
---
Dang!! Bad luck on my part!
---
Add the Last Laugh perk with Nuka/Nuka Quantum grenades, and you get TWO bangs for your buck!
---
Yea the robot damage bonus was good
---
I’m sorry man! Wish I could be of help.
---
Gud
---
Since the last update you can’t apply mods to anything. Just need to wait for another patch to fix it.
---
Yeah, it only reduces ballistic resistance not energy resistance. Tested it a few days ago.
---
A quad with explosive and a mirv
---
Yes, but every single corpse I've come across being at the same level of decomposition is highly unlikely. Some outliers, sure. Every one being roughly the same condition? Nah.
---

---
Grrrr. Annoyed I missed the 2nd one because the Atom Shop never updated for me and I checked 1000 times. Didn't think I would need to close down the application to see the new items when I never had to do that before.
---
We’re reaching levels of power that shouldn’t be possible
---
Ah, well, at least that answers the question.  Thank you.
---
Same here. I didn't know anything about the quest and did it when i was like lvl 46
---
This seems to be the end goal of half the forum sadly. Knew it was a fallout game but complain that its not just a survival/construction simulator with die-if-you-choose-to difficulty. Game doesn't challenge us after level 20 but they want it easier
---
I uh...... I wouldn't uh drink any water you find in that cache...
---
Ugh, guess I'll toss it then. So long Tesley, you helped me chain many a glowing ghouls :'(
---
New Jerssy Devil wouldnt be too far off from its origin if addrd to Fo76. That or some interdemensional stuff would be cool since there is some lore about that sort if thing.c
---
A werewolf type thing would be perfect for Fallout!
---
STR card Ordinance Express reduces explosive ammo and grenade/mine weight by up to 90%
---
I disagree with the ps4 part BECAUSE PCMR, but otherwise more.power to ya
---
Yep sometimes it helps. Sorry you missed the egg :(
---
You mean like you want to in adventure mode?
---
I too am Bromiscuous and seeking bros
---
that's where I bugged, did you ever get it fixed?
---
The names given by renaming are client side only, so that'll never be a worry :)
---
This is a great idea
---
Hit me up GT knucklessyrup
---
The michigan dog man doesnt really transform like a werewolf. It just looks like one all the time. Large, canine, stands on 2 legs.
---
Pretty cool. But i just thought of this. A legendary ghoul that turns into a ghoulwolf after you trigger its final health regen. (Or just a high level legendary wolf that transforms i guess.)
---
I gave up on the fat man because the weight of mini nukes and launcher was such a chunk of available carry weight versus the few times it would be best wep for the job.
---
BRÖTHER, MAY I HAVE THE BÜDGET
---
This is probably the thirtieth one of these posts I've seen! Keep it up, needs to happen.
---
It's hard to put into words why I find it off-putting in Fallout 4.   Certainly, New Vegas is very well-written.  You get some infamous lines, like "makes me wish for a nuclear winter," but most of the characters feel authentic and have interesting things to say.  Skyrim has some repetitive dialog too, but it's almost written from a high-level perspective.  It's not trying to make you care or develop a deep emotional connection to what's going on.  It's kind of agnostic-by-design.
---
But 4's writing strikes this combination of trying to be genuine and deeper than it is, and therefore it comes across as manipulative and shallow, like an imposter New Vegas.
---
the fact ANY ammo is out in the open that long after the bombs is more than enough considering the vault dwellers are far from the first and only ones roaming the countryside for supplies...  Just with raiders alone being out and about while were sleeping cozy in the vault is enough to dry the local supply.   
---
The fact so much edible food and ammo is "still" found out in the open is what breaks immersion if anything.
---
Good stuff is definitely still being hoarded in players personal stash inventory.
---
What's the issue?
---
Note: decontamination ark will act remove your mutation. I forgot to reequip starched genes.
---
And mods.
---
Fix the god damn mods.
---
Damn I wish I saw this yesterday. I missed the egg yesterday because it wasn’t showing up in my atomic shop :( now I won’t have them all. Frustrating, but thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah I have no idea what's wrong. But I haven't played in a while
---
Nuke the place it makes it better
---
Or a mini nuke cannon on your power armor arm.
---
It would depend on the situation. Handmade if you need to eat through their AP. Gauss if you know they don’t have much of any defense. Everyone will have their opinions though. I love my tse gauss but I don’t foresee using it much in pvp unless I know they are inexperienced.
---
I cannot un-see that.
---
Bethesda doesn’t know how to Numbers
---
Just stand in the house next time. Nothing spawns.
---
I think it's just that flamers are pretty underwhelming and not viable in late game
---
I don't believe AA affects explosive damage either. It only lowers ballistic and since explosive is it's own type of damage it's also not affected by AA. 
---
I see people going crazy for AAE laser weapons when in reality it won't do much more than a regular laser rifle.
---
Anyone else getting the glitch where it will reload to full, then fire just ONE round before stopping?  The other 249 shots go off without a hitch for me, but the first one is a tricky bastard.
---
I was expecting details for the dlc, because it is a news article about exactly that. Also The Burrows wasn't on the roadmap so they **could** always surprise you.
---
Welp, now we know a reason why those robots were so eager to kick us from the vault
---
Yes always try close reload for most games this is a valid problem solver :)
---
Do you have a bunch of 25% cores?
---
Classic Chad
---
Everybody is having the same issue
---
If you have a Troubleshooter's weapon, it does extra damage to robots. Troubleshooter's armor gives extra protection from robots.
---
I've heard this is an issue, but if you're on Xbox I'll give you a new one
---
Awesome I appreciate the advice. I always just shut my console off and rarely shut the game down so it makes a lot of sense.
---
Are you using vats?  That chews through them extra fast
---
Submit a support ticket, I’m sure you can refund it.
---
Shutting down xb1 and unpluging then plug back in and powerup helps refresh plans to spawn at top of the world armor bench, grafton locker, and other places. Refreshed atomic shop items too
---
I played for 4 hours without an issue on PS4
---
More for me that I want to save certain ammos and gear for my sniper and my sniper save the like for my heavy Gunner etc. So then I sit on 30 missiles lol
---
good for you. lots of us arent
---
mole miner gauntlet.
---
You ain't helping shit. He just lacks the virtual levels to kick your bloated carebear ass to the curb. Miss me with this fakeness.
---
Just make a nice cozy lil house mines 2 story and a 3 by 3 it's not about size, it's what you can comfortably fit into your house
---
Oh.
---
yes tonight all night long. im about to give up
---
sorry I didn't start the game and try to diagnose all the new problems and fixes?
---
You whine a lot.
---
Shrouded is a great option for stealth esespecially if you get some chameleon or weightless armor
---
good to know 👍
---
Lols
---
Yes it goes through 50% energy resistance. It does more damage in other words
---
I've been lugging around a bunch of useless Legendaries.  I sold off several of them today.  Why?  Because I had a real talk with myself.  I can already destroy most things in the world.  Most monsters don't bother me.  And no, I don't have 3\* perfection on anything, or even 3\* on most things.  This character is in the stage where refinement comes slowly, but also isn't necessary.
---
I don't foresee Bethesda offering any method for adding specific attributes.  It's not going to be like, "Oh, now I can put 40% swing speed on everything."  Nothing I've seen indicates they are that generous.  They want to keep things as random as possible in order to prevent players from acquiring god-tier gear on-demand.  Based on everything we've seen with Wild Appalachia so far, I've come to expect the absolute most bare-bones implementation.
---
What you have to trade i have 3
---
At this point you should just remove PvP between players everywhere except the workshops.
---
They need to disable vats vs players i hate aim botting instant kills.
---
Good to know, thank you
---
They both lead to the same place and are connected. The north one just drops you in somewhere near where all the wood structures are. As opposed to the south entrance where it drops you in at the beginning of the sewers and you have to run down that long sewer shaft to get to where the wood structures are.
---
You sure? You are literally the only person I've heard saying it does something.
---
PSA - Watoga was gimped pretty hard after patch 8. Apart from a glitch like this, watoga robots don't spawn as legendaries in the numbers they used to.
---
I've heard of this happening to others.  Weirdly, it was also the Soldier mask, like that specific mask has some incorrect durability property on it.
---
Mole miner? Ok if it's a melee one shot and your workshop is PvP zone you can fat man them to death.
---
Mama mia papa pia. You are supposed to restart your console or pc to refresh atomic shop items and the egg will show up.
---
I say anti armor means all resists flat across as true damage.
---
Hey It's on sale again today for another 21 hours, get it while you can!
---
I couldn’t find it in my inventory either, thought maybe I was just missing it
---
One day I hope!
---
I think Birdies mom pushed her out the nest..
---
It's on sale again, about 21 hours left.
---
I've had various Tesla Rifles over my hours and the one I ended up sticking with was the Anti-Armor one because it really seems like it does more damage than the others.
---
Just a heads up for PS4 users: it seems if you're currently playing while the atom shop gets a new item, you have to log out and actually close the application from the playstation menu before going back in and seeing the changes.
---
lmao you know the guy who  made fnv is a communist right
---
you know liberty prime is ironic right
---
you know that the whole theme of the series is literally 'capitalism sucks' right
---
What we need is the ability to have a Adventure Camp and a Survival camp...I love my awesome strange builds..but I also use my Camp in pvp and you can’t worry about decor in survival
---
you want caps for it?
---
I have a little bro who plays with me and my friend too! It's pretty fun to have a family member who likes what you like as well!
---
I don't have a mic, and I don't plan on getting one. I play the game to play the game, not to have conversations with strangers.
---
Thanks!
---
We already have details on the upcoming stuff. Last weeks ITV gave us information on the camera and the dungeon. The camera isn’t coming until next week and then player vending is next I believe, which will probably be talked about in next week’s ITV
---
Hahaha or a giant tick
---
BTDT
---
You can't get quad or double on black powder weapons?
---
I would have done something similar.. but.. again.. crashed. oh well.. only lost like 5000 caps worth of junk.
---
 I just sell it to Phoenix. I'm not the only one, its not uncommon to find it at the Watoga Railroad Bot as well.
---
I’m SteelBiscuit174 and can’t join your game; might be a setting on ur end. Could u invite me?
---
Would be such a great addition!!
---
I like it but also terrifies me
---
World full
---
Could you imagine all of the splosion football rps?
---
You get used to it after a couple of years
---
Camp McClintock usually has 1 or 2 that spawn. One is the second portable toilet by the barracks from right to left.
---
Sure. So you expect only full rerolls of all affixes? And at what number of tokens? 20? 50? 100? How pessimistic are you?
---
That sucks... It's ok though just go to homestead then complete some breach and clears then you will be good.
---
Cant join you. Invite watchmefly420
---
my ends fine. i can play every other game no problems and ive checked ping/traceroute/etc  
---
this is a bethesda issue and im not the only one. all night long i log in for about 1-5 minutes i can play then server not responding followed immediately by disconnect
---
Feel free to add me if you need ppl to play with. Me and my friends are on a lot but are super casual and build a lot :)
---
It’s not really a game I would recommend right now. Maybe in 3 months.
---
Nope, all 100%. Made a pile of them last night and I’ve burned through 8 today.
---
Save blueprint as..."Bird Trap"
---
Good try. I see what you did there.
---
Good to know. I can watch the meter move with each power attack.
---
Awesome I usually just go around scrap get stuff find mods etc. So that would be awesome I need friends to play with I usually play on my own.
---
No more than usual
---
Coming soon to the atomic shop, fusion core recharger kit! 200 Atoms.
---
There's a 90% reduced weight launcher as a quest reward somewhere or other, but that doesn't help with all that mini nuke weight - ooft.
---
But then you’d probably cause the payload to detonate the second your foot hits the nuke.
---
They are in the shop a whole day
---
It normally triggers after you finish the quest in hornwright industrial HQ by Charleston otherwise I've got no clue
---
The mods for the X0 1 are not working I have 4 different ones and I cannot attach any of them. I contacted customer support on bethesda website, they told me they are aware of the people having the issues with the mods, and to check the forums or the twitter customer support for fixes. If not I can reopen my ticket.
---
I'm not on PS4, but that has taken over as my preferred dumping spot over overseer's and whitesprings station for plans, armor, and weapons I can't or won't use.
---
I'm in. Who's dropping it?
---
Hi in, I'm dad!
---
Was he crouching?
---
Smh
---
Nope just running around out in the open
---
To answer your question, no. If you were to miss a day(egg) you will not get the end reward.
---
Melee or guns would not target him in the open and he was hostile
---
Hello, if you'd like to join a friendly bunch we welcome friendly people with open arms.. 
---
We have cookies !!
---
Invisibility?
---
What even happened? I joined, no nuke zone.
---
I love when people do this :)
---
I would buy that
---
You could of been too far or not had ap, or there was something blocking your sight line
---
Are you actually trying to argue that having to scroll for a few seconds is the same as not scrolling at all? Not sure whether you're 9 or 109, it must be one or the other if you can't understand how this would affect UX.
---
Nope right beside of me and full AP
---
Best way to test it is have a friend PvP you 0 perks same armor resists same weapon.
---
Nope was fully visible
---
Same. I feel deceived. ?
---
All I do in that event is farm XP from the robots. People are really bad so I just ignore the boss and begin clearing all the adds to farm XP.
---
Go cry somewhere else.
---
Nice, usual burn through an estimated 2500 to 3500 .50 cal rounds on SBQ fights depending on how many people are participating. Nice Drop!
---
If I hadn't changed my look, could of made it a tripleganger?
---
Lag? If not that are hacks possible to invalidate targeting?
---
My wife and I just use the ps4 chat. She hates the way some people behave.
---
It's their opinions, you shouldn't be upset over that.
---
I would say reduce the carry weight because then it’d just be another stash. But I am really hoping for essential, customizable pets to come in a dlc update!
---
I believe it’s a brotherhood main quest reward, and you get flares that you throw to signal the artillery, but it has a very limited range and is pretty slow to fire. It’s good if the enemy is really close to your base and you know it’s going to stay still, but most enemies move out of the range by the time it fires.
---
Super cool. I had a feeling it was tied with the brotherhood. Thanks man.
---
So was he sprinting or right beside you? Your comments differ but that being said, there’s not a perk to counter vats, only stealth boys and crouching are hard counter to vats
---
 That would be great. The problem is, you can only get 1 star wood armor for some reason.
---
Lol

They called it a "high level repeatable dungeon made for two level 50+ players". What we got was a high level new area. I knew it was going to be easy when they said "two level 50+" I mean I consider level 50 to be mid level and a high level char to be 80+. The thing that I get stuck on is the "repeatable dungeon" part. Why call it repeatable when it is just another area to explore?
---
I had to actually restart the Xbox and then the egg showed up thanks a lot for your suggestion. 😀
---
Like plasma weapons used the be. I’m on board throw away the wood...
---
Imagine being butthurt over being feeling good. Man, to be in your shoes for a whole day.
---
Oh well. Guess I'm off 76 tonight, kinda tired of farming Burrows
---
Wood armor would break in 20 hits
---
That was exactly my experience. I launched my first one last weekend (lvl 82) and it legit took 4+ hours to launch the nuke and kill the queen and that's *after* collecting all code pieces because I wanted to try to decide it myself (I couldn't)... I don't have a min/max build our anything and I died a *bunch* of times
---
does anyone else pass up discarded plans to preserve the dopamine hit of finding it in the wild?
---
meh. I'm more mad that the game crashed and PvP is still a joke.. but whatever.
---
I bought a instigating dragon from Watoga vendor
---
Even once armor breaks it’s not automatically unequipped. Not until you unequipped it or enter and exit power armor.
---
Its great outside of combat, you'll basically never need stims outside of fights again
---
 Erm, I'm a newly-minted level 30 and feel not cheated at all about not being able to go places.  Why should I be able to do everything all the time?  There are places you learn not to go to, or you go in as learning experiences.  It's been like that forever in games.  Nothing like a quick death to help you learn more about yourself, tactics, or equipment.  Take time to smell the roses.
---
Also, checking the map is called a "map reconnaissance" and has been around for ages in the military.
---
He was spring and sometimes he was simply standing still..and then how the hell didn’t he take damage? Lol he have sent and cav pieces? And not to mention I even free scoped a non vats crit head shot and he didn’t die and I was at way low health also had tank killer rifle man etc etc again don’t care I was killed just trying to understand what was going on
---
I'm sorry to hear that.  Gaming should be a safe space where everyone has a similar goal... to have fun and escape from the world!
---
It's unfortunate that there are too many involuntary celibate men in gaming community.  Maybe they should practice being nice to people via gaming so they aren't so nasty in real life
---
So it launched, but I got disconnected and had to rejoin 3 times.
---
Looks like i missed one. Oh well
---
Picture for proof?
---
They don't need to fix it, they introduced a major bug that locks out one of the core features of the game.  Roll the patch back.
---
I'll be sitting in game waiting for you. Lucille is going to love meeting you.
---
Cow milking station. 200 Atoms. Coming soon.
---
Or even just some skins for the rest of the guns. I'd really like a skin for the SAA
---
No. It's luck. I literally just ran a burrows with one 3* and 2 2*.
---
It sounds a lot cooler than it really is I tried using it many times and unless you like blowing up masses which are only close to your camp then it’s a waste of budget
---
I hear ya. I started farming back when I was Level 30 and never looked back. Now I’m 243 I think and still haven’t completed main quest line or discovered a bunch of the map because I, for some reason, enjoy farming and participating in SBQ events and whatnot. 
---
Anyway, I did notice Watoga lacked them. But then again, realistically, Watoga shouldn’t have had them anyway unless they were still hostile (before the Mayor for a Day quest). It was just too easy to kill non-hostile legendary bots there. 
---
As far as WS, I haven’t noticed a significant difference. It’s not by any means the best place to Farm, in my opinion, but I still get maybe 1-2 3*** items there most times when I hit it. 
---
Though not as “fun” I still think WestTek is best place to consistently farm for 3*** items.
---
I still believe one shots shouldn't exist though there should be a damage cap to avoid such bs.
---
this is what we need more of
---
You can be right and still be a douche about it. That’s you.
---
Gonna dump about 30 plans too - I can imagine people faces when they find out because I had one before too :D it's like digging out a pirates's treasure.
---
Yes, I'm getting the same exact thing right now. I'm not sure what to do either.
---
I feel like everyone is overexaggerating issues with 76 because I haven't experienced *anything* you just said.
---
10 years is a long time to hold an idea and spread it. 10 years is a lot of people.
---
As a Male feminist, I'm so happy to see this approach.  There should be no tolerance for this kind of behavior.  Thus execution seems to be the most appropriate solution.
---
Playstation plus is bugged atm for all games it literally started happening 5 minutes ago
---
That lemonade radiation power level is over 9000!!!
---
To be honest, I expect something similar to the Mr. Fuzzy Tokens.
---
I agree with your thoughts about the potential impact such things would have on Caps.  The existence of the vendor alone would probably equate to seeing less Legendaries at vendors, since everyone would just deposit them there, unless the cost was so high that some would just assume it's not worth it.
---
Come get some.
---
You named your weapon Lucille.... how cute.
---
No such thing as a non vats crit headshot
---
Now what after all no achievements left.
---
How many points do you have in luck?
---
I’ve been watching Oxhorn for the last 3-4 years and have never once heard any sort of idea or influence of that in his videos (if I had, I wouldn’t have continued to watch them). People can’t change the past- but they can change themselves.
---
or drop kick them?
---
This happened to me a few days ago. Solider mask.
---
What I’m wondering because I had 2 friends with me I’m lvl 156 and friends were 80 and 96 I’m running bloody have a good bloody rifle and boxing glove  others were running explosive and AA but it was a challenge to kill this guy he was like lvl 112 I think
---
Can confirm, I built mine to the left of the pool in anticipation for the player vending (before it was delayed) and never get a stray ghoul visiting. If I have to move then oh well but it's made doing my vendor runs way easier
---
8
---
Looks like its back up.  That was weird.
---
Cheers will add you when i'm able to get on
---
Assassin gear makes you unrealistically tanky because of % reduction I think. But the 0 vats thing I don't know why vats is being dumb vs him.
---
Ah. I haven’t intentionally collected any Mr Fuzzy tokens so I have no idea how they work. After the world ending and all, Mr Fuzzy didn’t seem important to me.
---
Technically, even if it's slap damage it's still damage. Had player fisting my low level, so I tried to fast travel, and it didn't let me.
---
Find all those damn recipes... finally found that lemonade bastard last night.
---
Yeah least should be able to target
---
Only good when you nuke it
---
It's a known issue. There are multiple threads about it. It'll most likely be fixed in the next hot-fix, or patch 9.
---
No excuses. I'm literaly at hospital bed after yesterdays brain operation and still got the egg with my potato laptop i took with me.
---
Try the trading subreddits
---
I walk around with over 200 purified water with only 3 industrial purified waters and a tank melee build. 
---
There is already so much purified water out there, it would not over inundate the market. 
---
Besides, when people are dropping 40k on 3*cryolators, caps don't mean that much.
---
Thank you. Guess I don’t noticed the threads if they aren’t of particular interest to me. I’ll start reading them all. Thanks
---
if want to group up sometime -- add me
---
When I first started playing, I was shocked at the amount of girls playing. Nope, just dudes. I’ve run into two girls with mics actually playing as girls. It’s always a surprise out in the wastelands!
---
I just want a Gauss Rifle skin
---
I wouldn't depend on aimbotting my targets if that happens frequently to you.
---
You might miss out on a Fadora hat.
---
Nope. They said the more stars means the better chance of getting the weapon of your dreams so it's not going to be what either of you are talking about.  I believe it's been said you can do it once a day.  I'm assuming you add the token to a weapon and get a random roll.
---
No that's dumb. It would render Fatmans useless
---
That’d be awesome!!
---
Exactly. A 20lb slingshot?
---
This makes me very happy to hear. My first 80 levels in this game were planned out beforehand. I would spend what seemed like hours just planning my next move in game. My friends always said they couldn't keep up with me once I got going.
---
Next time I get the chance to play, I want to decorate my camp with some lights, and continue my search for "fat sacks of loot" in survival mode.
---
Spawn rates have been down noticeably since the last update. It seems like instead of creating new and fun content Bethesda instead turned the dial up on the skinner box.
---
imagine using the term butthurt in 2019. Already guessing you're over 30
---
You can try unequipping and reequipping Power User.
---
PERFECT
---
I feel as though this is to allow us to not have to circumnavigate like you described. 
---
  
---
It was happening every finessed build anyway, might as well cut out the odd 2 stairs needed to make a base floor of "upper" floors.
---
This means we will have some new CAMP builds and tricks on youtube by JUG.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RtECgk6zOE
---
So brave
---
Well, I just bought it back from the vendor from FOMO, so I guess I'll try to find a level 50 non-legendary and test for myself until I find a decent 3* Tesla.
---
You can attach a meter conduit / pylon to it.
---
If you are in need of help or just general info, feel free to PM me and add me on Ps4. 76 is the only game I have played for awhile now.
---
No pic, no proof. Sorry but that's a little hard to believe without any evidence to back up your claim champ.
---
The only perk of being unemployed, will be on to get all the eggs lol
---
I just use it mostly to see who is around and for crit head shots still though doesn’t make sense
---
I run a bloodied build and I can easily 1 shot most people with pretty much any bloodied melee weapon and gun, and if you want to beat the shit out of a bloodied build you need to get an executioners weapon because they deal more damage to people under 40% health
---
How to implement this:  
---
Create a grenade variant which is just a mininuke with applicable damage. It's crafteed using a mininuke as the main ingredient.  
---
throwing it outside of PA should result in it landing pretty much at your feet, unless you have a relevant perk.
---
The biggest seller for this is the 1/4 floors, imagine putting one of those on the side of a foundation and putting a turret on it.
---
I'm convinced everyone that was pissed about it mistook it for the Arktos Lab that was in the trailer and that they were talking about at PAX.
---
Remove your mods and custom ini's
---
I didn't know if it had that kind of use.
---
All I can think are hacks of some kind. There's no way vats should have missed that unless your out of AP.
---
Congrats
---
I've been noticing that, too. I had 5 and suddenly I was getting the low power blink. wtf.
---
And dispenser of preferable alternatives to communism
---
I agree. Damage resistance is overrated, especially if you're running an unyielding / bloodied build where everything is about stealth an not getting hit at all.
---
I also keep a chameleon wood armor in my inventory just in case. They weigh nothing and have extra stealth compared to other types (shrouded, faster movement while sneaking (which, of course, doesn't work atm))
---
Bloodied rifle build... my dragon does 1300dmg nonexplosive lol.. I can one shot most players and against sent/ass I’ll do a crit and that’ll usually do it. I get raped by gamma guns tho
---
Seriously
---
Congrats, player. :)
---
Not gonna lie, "praticularry" made me laugh.
---
Oh yeah, I've had my fare share of Executions. It's cool to see what counters what. Again I deal mostly with pve so usually my biggest problems are things that fly, which I have a bloodied gatling gun for, and getting shot by a shotgun while I'm running toward them. I really like the armor that add +3 to all special bc rn I have 22+ strength.
---
Now if I were to use an armor type for pvp itd be either the autostim or the chameleon armor.
---
This. It’s pretty hard to keep everyone else out so you can enjoy the adventure on low level. Server hopping is probably the best solution.
---
I run a full set of unyielding combat armor so I keep my strength over 33 and most of my bloodied melee weapons deal over 1500 damage
---
Yelling into the mic "I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU!"
---
I would kill so many sbq just to have a bloodied dragon. I'm a very hardcore melee build but I'm looking for more weapons to put into my bloodied collection. Atm I only have the super sledge and the gatling gun as bloodied.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only person that cowered in the elevator. xD
---
Are you on PC?
---
This is only somewhat true. After doing the quest where you find Traggery's remains, return to Fort Defiance and go to her room. It's on the 4th floor and is the room protected by a laser grid. on the desk there will be the artillery schematic. It's easy to miss but is pretty nice to have. I personally find it ineffective against enemies, but once I saw someone's base near mine on **survival** (plz don't hate on me) so I threw a grenade at it and the whole place was leveled. I'd say it's fun for pvp and trolling.
---
I can fast travel to Grafton Dam... but it's still not being registered as me discovering it... awesome &gt;.&lt;
---
Oh I was being sarcastic earlier by the way, down in here in Texas we have lots of guns and ammo but no where as much as West Virginia in Fallouts world
---
Yup full ap just makes no sense
---
hey, there's no one around except robots to see so why not :)
---
Today has been horrid for launches. I had 3 servers crash right after the launch announcement.
---
And cry babies gonna cry 😭
---
I'm really hoping it's going to affect everything and not just foundations. Setting up a fence is such a pain in the ass
---
I googled doomsday clock and all I can say is that it seems like the kind of thing nihilists or fatalists or whatever created so they could have something scientific looking to point to when they say the end is near.
---
That said, it seems to me that the clocks input is heavily skewed towards subjective input as opposed to objective input.
---
I think he knows he doesn't need them, he said:
---
&gt;I had saved all of these primarily for trading purposes.
---
I'd heard stories about crashes after nuke touch down, and had actually resided myself to that fate. So when it didn't crash i was like "yes!" until the server alert.
---
That's incredible, I'm working to get more armors like that but the ones I have are MUCH more weaker than my normal armors. Plus getting the strength buff perks that arent in the strength category are what I'm grinding for atm. It's easy to get lost in all the great perks just for this build.
---
My build is a bit unstable so I can take much damage yet but I'm working out the kinks
---
I found some dog armour like they had in FO4, I have no idea what to do with it lol
---
Female here, I play on Xbox, and I usually just play in a party with friends or when alone, with no mic. Sometimes the comments I’ve gotten in other games are even more awful since I’m a black female. A lot of the time I just avoid other people.
---
I was thinking having safe zones in certain locations. like whenever you're inside a train station or any location with vendors then pvp is turned off. I have experienced and heard of people that were trading just to die by a one shot right after finishing or sometimes during trading. It would also be nice to place these safe zones with story important characters or locations like Biv's bars and the new laying low location with the map and cases.
---
Anybody got some o’ them budgets? (Scratches neck)
---
I don't know about most appropriate, but it gets the point across.  I have yet to find out if it works!
---
Me too! I also thought wow girls like fallout too but ahahah on mic they were far from girls. I haven’t actually found a girl who was actually a girl yet out in the wasteland. Probably for the same reasons as this post.
---
PS4
---
I heard four pieces of cavalier armor make you un vatsable. I doubt it and cannot confirm.
---
I had a decent idea of what I needed thanks to the community on reddit, psn communities, friends, etc.. At first I just chose perks that helped me at the time, but then I learned how powerful some weapons could be with the right perks so now I'm just working extra hard to get perks I should've already had since level 50.
---
The low volume holotapes and players talking on mic are a problem. Xb1 has two different sound settings and one with volume sliders while headphones are plugged in.
---
Yep, love my bloody PVE build.
---
Nerd rage is a must have for a bloodied build
---
Dedication
---
Lol you’re a dedicated farmer. What you said is true, Watoga is nerfed to near zero. WS and the burrows are similar, as well as West Tek. Difference is west tek spawn is quite uniformly above 48, so the chance for higher level loot is better than the other two places where ghouls can spawn as low as 40. Lots of good stuff max out at level 45 (handmade, 50 cal, lever action, marine armor, etc) so 48 has way better chance than 40.
---
Lol that would be insane
---
I love mine too, it's horrible in survival mode thought. People will just hide with chameleon armor and burn you up with a gatling laser lol. I've lost lots of caps on that game mode till I started using a bank account to keep my caps away from those people.
---
😂
---
Hooked on phonics bro
---
well lol yea if you have satelite internet of course you having a hard time playing your signal has to go into space bud...
---
Cool, thanks for the heads-up!
---
Has Bethesda ever officially confirmed whether or not the Luck SPECIAL has anything to do with Legendary drops? I think that might be hogwash. But I could easily be wrong.
---
;)
---
Running bloodied with Adrenal is a big bonus...they work together... keep rads high so your health doesn't rise above one third makes sure damage remains high. Plasma Gatling gun does over 150 per shot. First time I took it out was tonight and melted a level 80 SB in 5 minutes (two passes) Absolutely must avoid getting surrounded tho, multiples can kill you in no time. Just  avoid getting surrounded or cornered
---
I've had this happen too. It's irritating. Just out of Melee range. Chasing someone.
---
Friends welcome sign is a metaphor for your friends being a hot steaming pile of turds
---
Ill work I'm getting that tomorrow, thanks!
---
Life saving armor and Mysterious Stranger.
---
I was playing on survival server and hiding near a player camp. I saw them walking around in there. Played a liberty prime sound byte and he logged off lol
---
My PSN is Kazamati. I’ll be back on tomorrow :)
---
Bummer.
---
I have 6. I grabbed two 1* weapons when I did the burrows first. Went through twice today and both legendary enemies dropped nothing. 
---
I know it’s RNG but I wonder about the luck stat.
---
Sounds like you found the random event spawn that usually comes with super mutants, 2 deathclaws (1 sometimes labeled "deathclaw merchant").. and deathclaw eggs.
---
Most of us use fusion generators... don't come close to using it all.
---
Once I'm in I have zero problems, it's getting in that can take a few tries. 
---
And I understand how satellites work, thanks for (I presume), trying to be helpful.
---
Something is fucky with the way they reload into Gatling laser too. When you reload you fire 1 shot, then if you fire again you burn through 998 rounds of core in like 250 shots. It's super fucker, but hey this is Bethesda we're talking about, they are the lords of buggy untested crap after all.
---
20 tokens to reroll a legendary effect lol that’s like cheaper than dirt. I can see myself not playing but just sit there rolling and rerolling all day long. A good handmade can go for 10-20k caps currently, i can probably roll one in minutes for 200. 
---
Yay more floating buildings heading to fallout...
---
Sounds more like the diarrhea had you
---
Ok I'll try that. Thank you.
---
Haven't heard the name but check out Widgeon TV he shows some close ups of the flatwoods monster and it's clearly a zetan of some kind.
---
Possibly an early scouting or capturing type, they gather us up and the eggheads we see in the other fallouts dissect us?
---
`I have my tinfoil hat firmly on so take what I say with a grain of salt but, the mothman, the flatwoods monster, Indrid Cold, I mean MODUS, its all connected, man. Some kind of invasion or flood of aliens and men in black suits, man. Mothman is trying to warn us, trying to protect us, you just gotta listen, man.`
---
its a relatively common bug since the renaming patch.
---
i lost 2 pieces in 2 days :/
---
luckily i havent lost any expensive pieces yet but im afraid to even have them in my inventory because i dont want them to disappear
---
just a thought but if there are 3000 spawns across the map could they possibly be what spawns the random encounters for camp attacks? i dont know or have a clue about the spacing needed or how many of the 3000 would be required to make sure the map is covered for anyone with a camp to get attacked but just a thought i had while readin your post.
---
I had a TSE gauss and found it completely unreliable in terms of actually hitting the target on anything smaller than a scorchbeast. TS weapons suck imo, you take a massive hit to accuracy and recoil, in exchange for 25% bonus if you even hit the damn thing.
---
True and I have one too but I'm getting close to it's limit.
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/10faON0pDgQwNu4U0yVud_qQm5LkoKkUH/view?usp=drivesdk
---
Holy fuck read other posts in the reddit you're the millionth dumb prick with the same issue.
---
Lol yeah I got killed 2-3 times today by two level 50's opposite ends of a workshop sniping me. Once one of them left though it became cake and I got 400 caps equaling a 200 cap profit plus I got the workshop to end my night off with a smile on my face.
---
Rn I've got a bloodied gatling gun (120 damage but slow af fore rate) to replace the gatling plasma but untill then I'll get my group to keep an eye out for it. Then, then I'll be ready for those winged bastards who only land when im 50 meters away and out of AP lol.
---
Yeah, I don’t really read much of anything unless it interests me. But thanks for your time dude. Have a good one
---
COMMON? Like - are there more posts about this or?
---
What platform are you on?
---
Maybe stacked bolstering armor?
---
good one chad this guy such a kidder
---
kill it, its a synth! ad victoriam!
---
Hard crash for me as well. Are they doing anything to fix it
---
Right? That and any legendary gets better at low health.
---
Yup
---
ive seen 4 posts about it. and since 2 of my pieces disappeared on 2 different frames within 2 days im just assuming its a realtively common thing.
---
also im on pc
---
Hah looks like I just mislabeled one. I've got 2 Pyrolyzers. One's yours!
---
Can't say without knowing their build/perks/armor etc. Also may have been effect of stims/other aid along with perks etc. The variables are many
---
It is useful, but it shouldn't drop as often as it does currently
---
It's the elevator exit at the end of Glassed Cavern I believe.
---
I wait for my kids to go to sleep before I jump on for the night. There have been many an event, mission, and team exploration that have had to be put on hold for my progeny. I too, like many other vault-dweller parents, have been playing since beta and have just gotten to lvl114.
---
This is correct, it's the one way exit from the end of glassed
---
What platform?
---
Guessing it is like Biv and just failed to load for you. Ive been down there twice today
---
\&gt;Already guessing you're over 30 
---
Uh, okay? Sure?
---
just log out and start again its probably a glitch I got that with biv as well
---
PC
---
just server hopped and it worked
---
I don't possibly understand how you have zero probelms once you are in your ping has to be over 400
---
Working on xbox
---
I know for a fact I have seen a quad dragon. Used to have one, but it has been a long time
---
Yeah I just checked the Unofficial Bug list.. apparently HUNDREDS of posts since Update 6. God.. apparently it's from Fast Traveling?
---
Rip, Xbox here
---
i'm a girl, ive only gotten one mention of it in my whole time playing since the first/second day of beta. i have a friend who plays and also is a girl, shes never gotten any trouble for it either. what are you on about lol
---
why not just make another character and do the quest for it again?
---
the doors in the cabins close and open on their own and the cabins shake like an earthquake
---
I think bloodied weapons sell really well. I like my full healthbar.
---
Lots of quality of life improvements. Psychopaths (like me) now have our own decicated servers which saves 'normal' players from us. Some new content including a one-hit-kill capable boss. Each update or patch seems to result in breaking several already-fixed bugs.
---
Last night I killed a ghoul in the Burrows but moments later he got up and stated trumbling along in one direction, clipping through walls and objects as if they weren't there. It wouldn't react to me and if I got close I could inspect it's inventory, just like a corpse.
---
Regardless, I am still enjoying the game. There are several legendary items I still want to find so that also keeps me going.
---
The only main perk that instantly came to mind was serendipity but this happened to me like 5 times or so while trying to kill them.
---
These camps are fine, it’s the ones that are right behind the golf club and have missile turrets that shoot into the clubhouse that are super annoying.
---
Yea, I know. I was taking about the players he unloaded onto after the SBQ fight. Why give all your plans to end game players when there are plenty of low levels who could use a good experience. The fo76 community is one of the best aspects of this game.
---
I'm the same, but I just hit level 80. I've been taking my time and exploring though, and still have a bunch of events I haven't done.
---
When you have bounty you lose only same number as bounty. So 10caps.
---
Also if you kill someone in survival and he gives you bounty 200 he pays when you die. You pay zero on death with this bounty
---
Im on PS4 but this sounds terrifying
---
Woulda been fun if egg #2 was available on Thursday night and not only Friday PM...
---
WHY?!
---
I got invited to a party today with eight other people. All had mics and it was a little chaotic lol
---
because he would have to get a new  character to level 50 and get someone to transfer it over
---
Very few at WS, for sure.
---
Surprisingly, after a short time, I got used to having low health. I built up a surplus of stimpaks from this build as well which is good for my teammates and any low level randoms I come across while I'm feeling generous.
---
annoyed, wouldn't say upset. I dare say it was me just typing my knee jerk adjective, you are right to call this as you have.
---
At least it has better accuracy than most WV passers.
---
I just picked up a .44 but sadly it’s only 1* but it’s a good side arm. Cost me an arm and a leg but I acquired a handmade and lever both be the lever cost me 40k and the handmade was a armor trade lol
---
The only reason it seems useless, IMO, is that you can't get more than the Shrouded mod for it, and it can't drop with more than 1 legendary star.
---
Every other armor has a slot for material and a slot for a utility feature.  Wood?  Just Shrouded, or not.
---
Let it have the full legendary three-stars, and add some material types and utility features (I'd likely still prefer Shrouded, but it's nice to have options), and it's great for stealth builds.
---
That's fair, and thanks for being so civil.
---
If we could have multiple effects on wood armor, that would be acceptable. Raider armor can still be good. But right now it's just trash. As far as I know, it is impossible to get more than 1* on wood armor
---
I think I have 3? I thought I missed one too
---
I haven’t seen as many replies from them this month, ever since the fiascos revolving around repair kits, cameras, and the new dungeon.
---
I hope you guys see this and are doing something to fix it!
---
Wow. So if I’m killed in PvP on Survival server I lose 1/4 my level in caps but if I have a 10cap bounty I only lose the bounty?
---
All I drink out of it is Coke for very obvious reasons loL, try wrapping it in with your blanket or just drink an atomic cocktail before-hand, ezpz
---
thanks for the replay im going to try aswell and see what happens when I go for 7
---
??? this event started two days ago and the second egg only appeared in the shop today
---
Not on PS4, but I leave plans/ammo/spare food (cooked) in the  Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm in the tool chest at the front behind the trailer (PC). Mostly because I'm still lacking the plans to properly power up the food dispenser (having a hard time tracking down plans, level 16) but the junk extractor only takes 10 power (which the power box always gives). If I've claimed it, I'll put the Easter eggs around the chest, if not (and I'm on your server) check anyway, there's probably something in there. :)
---
no today at 7pm eastern time was the 3rd egg
---
Every thing is terrible. Whitesprings only spawns level 8 radrats. We have to craft 1000 pickaxe pilsners for 10 atom points. We are all wearing wooden armor and using commie whackers with actual nerf bat skins.
---
Did my first launch last night at level 106. I started near the start of all the new content so I just didn’t get around to it and didn’t want to miss any of the timed content.
---
Let's get a few upvotes then and thanks for replying
---
Jeez, I've never had a weapon cost nearly 40k caps and I've bought a 3* fully upgraded bloodied super sledge with a 40% increased swing speed for only 2.5k caps and a TSE pump action shotgun. 
---
How much damage does it do? You might've overpayed for it...
---
Try carrying a hazmat suit goes on super quick and you can set it to your favorite wheel for quick access
---
There's a magazine that drops your vats accuracy down by 50% combine that with moving and you having some debuffs and you're probably not likely to hit in vats 
---
Or you know. It's broken. Like everything else.
---
Thats a really good idea
---
Not a problem that’s what I do but I’m a bloodied build so no power armor for me
---
Unaure about the majority of your post, but I'm on Ps4 and have reported a few people for various things and have gotten email responses from(a bot most likely) Bethesda saying they are looking into the person in question.
---
Do they work? Yes.
---
Is anything actually done after the report and auto response? No clue.
---
If it's Whitespring. I run right inside as fast as I can.
---
I have noticed the opposite. So probably just luck.
---
that just means a nuke had just ran out a bit before that same thing happens at whitesprings
---
I keep finding bloodied gear but most of it is useless to me as it’s low level.
---
Gotta love the ghoul druggies
---
Well you can always save some of it in the stash for when you get higher level and can make good use of it
---
This is getting to be extremely annoying! Had it happen to me three times this week. All on 3* enemies! A deathclaw, a mutant, and a ghoul. I go IMMEDIATELY to the corpse, get the text box list, start to read "Instigating..." or whatever lengendary attribute in fine print, and Poof! it all disappears, including the corpse. WTF!!!!
---
I used to...thems were the days
---
The last time I fought the SBQ, she was down to about 1/3 health and just kinda hovered in one spot, too high up to damage, until time ran out.
---
No. I see what your're saying, but I'd rather have that moment when I realize that people in this game and community are cool as fuck and want the lower levels to succeed than just the "oh cool about time" moment I get from finding a plan myself.
---
Of course, I wouldn't want it to happen all the time.
---
This still happen for you?
---
And what a dancer
---
I’m on Xbox one by the way
---
Well we average around 700 actually, but that's like, milliseconds. I don't really care about PvP, and it works fine with PvE. I've got over 600 hours in game, and have vastly enjoyed myself, thanks. :)
---
Well good luck to you to get that prize, it seems I'm fucked
---
Well fuck me, that explains a lot...
---
That's freaking awesome!
---
It's been a while, but this was a feature in FO4 right? So yea we definitely should have it here as well.
---
Been like it for week and a half on all platforms. Another "unforseen" but from a previous "patch". You know the 2 steps forward 1 step back style thing.
---
I'm level 113, and there's still plans I don't know. And I sometimes save them for my alts, so if I get a good plan I know my alt needs I'll grab those.
---
Thank you very much for mentioning me and my mods again -))
---
Not that I’m aware of in any of the patches since but I don’t know for a fact
---
Yea I get ya. It seems like whenever they don’t shut down the servers to add DLC the servers just go a-wall.
---
Question, how many legendaries did you find in nuked Watoga? I didn't believe anything about a stealth nerf at first since most stuff like that is just baseless fearmongering, but my camp is there and I have gone through a watoga run about 10 times now without finding any legendaries, dead or alive. I'm starting to believe it's completely disabled, intentionally or through a bug. Nuke zones iirc double the legendary rate, so double 0 would still be 0
---
Yeah no it’s just sentinel armor and probably unyielding or assassins as well and probably duped idk. They’re taking like 4% damage from you for standing still lmao
---
What the other reply says makes sense, people have been nuking it nonstop in the past 24 hours
---
Nope it is coming https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4gWcpeopiSywMb5GCpPAem/inside-the-vault-new-survival-challenge-rewards-and-more-april-18-2019
---
I do this often with crafting supplies and some plans in the ice chest outside of the whitespring station. Its a common enough area that I'm sure someone will have use for my leftovers
---
I am fairly sure jet packs don't spawn as mods, I have never seen one anywhere. I know x-01 jet pack mods exist, but I have never even seen one at modus's store
---
Sure there is in survival mode you can destroy camps and fight it out .. not needed on adventure.
---
Sure can you can continue in survival to your hearts content
---
Same at lvl 99 with my main, but I stand by my point. If someone offers me a plan I don't know, Imma take it for sure, but if it never comes across my screen I'd be none the wiser and hopefully some lvl 12 will be better off for it.
---
I kick myself mentally a lot for selling my executioners gamma gun to vender
---
I had to close and reopen the app to see the third one
---
Definitely server lag mixed with horrendous balancing
---
I've been having this problem for months
---
This. At first I thought "hah it can't be that bad" so I never even tried to remove it, just to check. Until we were able to place 10 turrets, then Chally had to go and holy cow (..sorry)! It felt like almost 15-20% or something got freed up :P
---
Nah I'm still not using em, too damn heavy
---
Same, I was keen for 300 but at 400 it's not worth it for me as you can't put it on the Voice if Set.
---
I play with my daughter whenever we can too. She’s stoked to play games with mommy. 😊
---
How much ? I am looking too
---
If something pops out of those eggs that I'm crafting with concrete, then they have _have_ my camp :P
---
You get lights?  I get nothing.  moved it around near conduits. nothing.  I figured they were reflective road dot kind of sign, but headlamp doesn't do anything.   I thought it would be more like the "Welcome Home" sign.  Pls fix BSG.
---
Bought my X-01 jetpack from MODUS and T-60 calibrated shocks from watoga train station, but I've never seen X-01 calibrated shocks
---
Considering the cap limit is 25k I’m hoping it was a typo
---
Yeah? That's what you people have been reduced to? Bitching about having to scroll? Jesus, Harold.
---
I realized early on that if I wanted to have a female character, my name had to be masculine as a first line of defense. I tried a mic for the first 20 or so hours of gameplay and decided it wasn’t worth the stress. Since then, I’ve had mostly positive or neutral interactions with others on my servers. Men amiright?
---
I'll try that next time they do something like this
---
Just record those asshats and send them to BGS/ Sony/ Microsoft. Get people banned. Put the videos on youtube. Like that guy who recently posted the video on the sub of his sister getting harassed.
---
Especially if said shit-talkers have youtube/twitch channels of their own. Thats sure to go over well with their followers.
---
**The most powerful weapon against bigotry is exposure.**
---
Once exposed, most bigots curl into a ball and can't defend their asinine viewpoint. See: Pewdie Pie, John Tron, Oxhorn.
---
I honestly had trouble just finding anything to fight. Almost all the enemies were just the patrolling robots that are already there pre-nuke. I did find a couple groups of ghouls but I don't believe they dropped any legendaries.
---
I just know I can get a max level pretty easy. Sold mine a while ago but can get a new one easy too lol
---
It would've been pretty useful if you unlocked the ability to craft these from the start since The Forest is abundant with wood resources meaning wood armor would fit more perfectly than leather armor as the beginner armor
---
I got Healing Factor at lvl50 from a generous lvl 100+ player I ran into. I remember it helped out a lot back then, but don't give it a second thought now, especially as I use a Bloodied build. Never use Rad-X, and only diluted stimpaks and radaway. Also running adreanal, marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon, so I'm stuck with it! Can't easily get rid of it!
---
Really? What platform?
---
For sure. I have noticed lower level characters at SBQ, too though. Like level 30s and stuff. Probably alts, but still
---
Ooh I can’t comment videos.
---
I've had people get on alts for me to give caps to the other so I wouldnt exactly be surprised but it does seem outlandish to trade a lever for 40k no matter how much damage it does.
---
It should be removed from the game. Stupid idea.
---
The workshop can be contested anywhere in the build area for I think 2 patches now
---
If he had a teammate that was in stealth?
---
What now?
---
I have to have 3 within my camp. This is due to my massive amount of water purifiers, I'm currently using like 205 energy or something. It's insane.
---
PS4, it started with power armor mods and now I just straight up can't mod anything unless I make the mod myself
---
U need better armor
---
I will had this message pop up for me too. Sadly when I go to said camps it's only ever some other enemy type attacking me.
---
I don't think it's cheating, I think the game should probably require you to have the code pieces in your inventory when you go to launch, but I don't think calling in outside help to figure out said code is wrong or 'cheating'.
---
especially if what u/Baron-von-Munchausen has been saying about the brute force method people use to figure out the code, burning through 100~ Nuclear Keycards and just trying every combo of letter and number. That's not cheating, that's more or less equivalent to an actual brute force hacking procedure.
---
If you have the right code(from a site), you still need a keycode to launch so, why doesn't the game require you to have the code pieces to launch also?
---
Yeah, PC, pressing X. I tend to forget that a lot of people play this on consoles lol
---
Yeah it was scorched for me :(
---
You should be able to add friends
---
Guys, nuclear war isn't a joke
---
I live next to The Freak Show, so I can toss a flare over there and reap rewards. Plus it's fun to watch.
---
That needs to be patched considering that event isn’t so relevant in every server. #patchit #fallout76 #Besthesda
---
Started on Tuesday. It's thursday. 3 days, 3 eggs
---
If you're not in PA it shows on the normal pipboy at the bottom. Doesn't help if you change the view mode though.
---
Try activating it maybe, but trust me it's worse.
---
Water
---
There is a grave reality behind things, but if you'r reading into it this much, I can assume you probably have shit going on or has happened at some point and that you should seek some help or comfort.
---
Fucking super mutants. At least they drop caps.
---
I thought of the same possibility as well that perhaps another player was rolling chameleon or stealth boy and next to the bench. I went to the big map and did not see any other players in the vicinity. Something seems so off about the entire encounter.
---
Lol, that’s what I get for taking an ambien and then cruising Reddit
---
That sounds like what I'm after a rate of 700 would be good. How did they do that?
---
How can you find CAMP items in the wild?
---
I'm male and I find it tremendously cringy how every time a girl posts searching for a play partner on game's facebook groups, it has like dozens of comments. If a guy posts, it gets 1-2 comments at most.  
---
The stereotypical/common guy gamer is weird AF.
---
Thanks for the heads up. You'd think that if a workshop can be contested from anywhere within the build area, then your turrets should consider any life within that zone as a threat and therefore engage said enemy. I had x3 missile turrets that ignored the dude even after he gunned me down.
---
That happened to me too. A team didn't like me in their workshop. I was in it but not contesting it. They initiated pvp and everything seemed normal except for vats. It just wouldn't target either of them but it would target their turrets. We could still damage and kill each other. 
---
 We eventually grouped up and they said it was the same for them and must be a glitch. This was months ago
---
I never ever use PA..always hazmat..rifle build maxed..glow sight maxed ..have a 3* ghoul slayer..i one shot everything at WS
---
So, lady gamer here and I'm also older (41). Lonnnng time gamer including mmos. I've definitely dealt with my share of dudes being asses but I've found its empowering to just mute and block. More often than not I run into the annoying young dude or kid who isnt being rude, but is just obnoxious and that's the reason I dont use my mic. That said, I've found lots of not annoying people when using my mic too so its just a chance. 
---
But seriously, blocking and muting is your best friend.
---
Good idea.  Whitesprings has 10 duped sniper builds camped out per roof so it's a sure thing.  Gonna try that next time I somehow get a bounty by accident.
---
This is the new form of griefing.  It’s happened to me a few times now and usually in the middle of fitting another mobs.   It’s cheap and when you respawn they are usually gone.   
---
Best bet is to block them permanently.
---
I am jealous. The damage on that has to be crazy fun
---
Yep. Was a way to combat those folks who prevent access to the work bench.
---
Something's off with your Power Fist. My DCG and Power Fist have the same damage (both with their respective mods) but your Power Fist has higher listed damage without mod, and mod is only adding 5% armor piercing, no damage.
---
Without mods, PF has a tiny bit more base damage. With mods, they have the same damage, but the PF has that extra AP effect.
---
I can agree with this line of thinking, however there is little use of wood armor, wood shields yes. But wood armor isn't practical if you have access to better materials, leather armors are still better than wood. Not to mention how flammable wood armor would actually be.
---
I've heard of guys having crazy number of water purifiers (like 30). What is this used for?  Nukashine or something? (I don't brew anything).  Just curious.
---
Talons only works for unhand and knuckle type weapons like gauntlets and...knuckles
---
But twisted muscles world with 2h, 1h, and first weapons. Unless your^my dumbass removes starched genes to do some super duper crafting before log off and completely forgets to put it back on........
---
And logs in the next day to someone who has nuked the sheepsquatch area(I'm at the foot of the hill)
---
Several rad away spams later and you're completely mutation free!😂😅😭😭😭
---
Tldr.
---
I rarely ever use a mic in online games, especially if I don't know the person. once a long time ago a raid leader in wow required a vocal check in for ready check on vent and there was a ridiculous amount of "OMG real girl???" spam that lead to me being spammed with pm's for far too long after. I was just trying to play :/
---
I don't usually care to hear the toxicity spouted anyway as that's mostly what I hear without them knowing I'm female. I tend to tunnel vision in my goals of building or farming and ignore it entirely anyway...
---
that all said; toxic or not; area chat is loud. and I have a hard time hearing and staying aware/focused) to game sounds with my household life sounds going on that I would probably die more if I had it on...
---
Go to the "Find People" option in the friends tab of the XB menu. Put in their gamer tag, and select "join game". It'll launch you into their server.
---
#blue #verre 2.0
---
Yeah, you're right. I guess I still avoid mob scenes because of pre-patch scarfing of loot. I only work the periphery of WS now to get mats for flux crafting
---
Usa#
---
I suspect you're confused and didn't realize Deathclaw Eggs are a real (food) item in the game.
---
Well expect this to happen a bit more than normal as these losers try destroy camps before they no longer can .. but yup don't accept random team invites, this is one of the things they do ..
---
There are two to three builds that simply dominate pvp right now. If you run up against somebody rocking one and can't counter, you're just toast. Game needs a lot of balance fixes.
---
You mean build around the workbench to prevent access yes? The more I think of workshops + contesting, especially in Adventure Mode, the more flawed it starts to become. .
---
yeah i accepted it because i thought he wanted to fast travel for free, but i’ll be more cautious now
---
The Iron Giant in his 'annilhation' mode.
---
Yes. There is a mod. Not sure about perks. I would assume so
---
They have the Ebay armor on lol that's what I call it. You can buy full sets of "Never Die" armor..
---
#Weshould
---
Harper's Ferry is the new White Springs. Tons of Flora and mobs.
---
Replaced it with, the vault tech security armor pieces.
---
Soon we won't have to worry as they won't be able to destroy camps soon and it will be safe to accept invites
---
That RNG has got me beat
---
.
---
I've only done a baker's dozen of the sheepsquatch event and I have luckily a 90% success rate (Only failed one, simply because I didn't grab all the pylons like I normally do) 
---
I have 4x mascot outfit, 3x mascot head, 4x white wolf fedora, 1x ISS head
---
No ISS outfit or fixer plans.
---
That or a "sorry" emote.
---
And that is also part of the problem. You kill a 3 star legendary for a one star piece of wood armor.
---
Was this a glitch? Like did you have a nuclear keycard in your inventory but it didn’t accept it?
---
They fixed that “flaw”. That’s what they’re saying...
---
Every time you launch a nuke, it consumes one key card.
---
I use this configuration... basically let’s me hit two or three targets at once. Requires charging for full effect. One of several vampire weapons I have...
---
Not my main weapon but I dig it out for enemies vulnerable to energy attacks.
---
I agree, something was terribly off about the entire encounter. It seemed more like a assault/robbery more than a pvp engagement laid out by Bethesda. I mean, you should always have your guard up in this game, but less-so in Adventure Mode. Workshops are so easy to come across, that usually if someone takes mine or contests it, I just hand it over.  I put x3 levels into Home Defense for those shiny missile turrets that completely ignored the biggest threat coming into the zone. Even when I was gunned down, the turrets didn't do shit. When I went back to find the guy contesting (he probably went Chameleon), I couldn't find him through VATS or the big map. The turrets should've locked onto to him from the get and go and gave me some cover. I could have used the protection.
---
actually, more like:
---

Thanks, now I gotta pull up their discography again and get listening.
---

---
If they're in sneak they wont show up on the map.
---
It's definitely related, but not like you might think. The travel encounters are primarily what's responsible for the camp attacks. They seem to have a kind of search-grid like path they follow after spawning and they will usually end up at someone's camp if it's nearby. I had to move my camp a few feet and in doing so, it moved just enough to allow a close-by travel encounter to start spawning again (I must've overlapped it the first time) and I get attacked by that spawn every single time. The other possibility is that you just so happen to be near another fixed spawn. For example, close enough to a named location to draw out the enemies that naturally spawn there.
---
Upvoted. Just traded for a legacy explosive flamer and trying to keep up with the fuel usage is insane. Hopefully they change the cost.
---
Yea, true. I've taken my lvl 42 alt to the sbq fight, but I was really only good for smacking down the mobs with my instigating super sledge. Lol
---
I wish that fusion core ejection perk was a thing like in fallout 4. That was cool. Impractical, but cool. Impracticool?
---
You can link a video.
---
How?
---
Couldn’t agree more remove it against players it’s impossible to balance
---
Omg im sorry for your loss
---
 I'm DEFINITELY DOING THIS ONE:
---
I swore of workshops and still will AFTER I suffer this last one (unless they give out another gatling gun).
---
Here's how it's gonna go:
---
Take workshop - hopefully won't get two shot killed to a PVP 'Raider' minutes after taking workshop, giving me enough time to find #3.
---
Take workshop. Rush to do the rest:
---
1. build exactly 1 turret, powered by the smallest generator possible.
---
2. kill ghoul/mutant/scorched whatever qualifies. Does it have to be within workshop? or can I jump to Whitesprings and pop a ghoul? 
---
3. Hide until reward given. 
---
4. jump servers.
---
5. Profit.
---
Second this. I personally love the raider theme, and would love to see camp items in line with it.
---
If you look at each items power needs and add them up that will give you the total power usage.
---
We should probably be able to get them next year. I missed all of those this week, only got one from tonight
---
nope. crickets...
---
Yes there is a charging shotgun barrel, standard rifle barrel, and a lobbing barrel and no it does not use the shotgun perks.
---
I did, no luck at all.
---
Flaming chainsaw works!!!
---
It’s weird. I went into the silo with a full core, fucker was almost dead before I exited. I barely made it out and back to a stash to grab more.
---
Confirmed, if the most recent egg isn't showing, make sure you manually close out of FO76 and re-launch it fresh.  The shop loads properly then.
---
At this rate I’m going to have to claim a power plant every time I play. That or kill every sentry bot in white springs 😆
---
Makes sense but still mind boggling for players to have to juggle both solo and pvp variables in Adventure Mode given the existence of Survival Mode. I was under the impression that in AM, I am protected for the most part unless I shoot back. I didn't shoot back and still got gunned down and robbed. Yes, I had a workshop and workshops can be "contested" by other players now, seemingly, from anywhere within the workshop space. My missile turrets were worthless the entire time and of NO consequence or threat to the invading player(s). The concept of workshops are nice but the execution and rules by which they operate upon particularly in Adventure Mode,  are all out of whack and seem to benefit the griefers and trolls.
---
You can still talk, there’s good people out there. They’re rare but they exist and can lead to good times. Just have to wade your way through all the sewage.
---
Ive read some threads that say you can get them as loot drops. Not sure if its true.
---
Upload the video somewhere and post a link?
---
Yep. My Tesla has it. Great for spamming a mob. Tesla shotgun. and all shotgun perks work with it. Mine does 250+ plus damage, but I notice that the spread charges jumping from body to body amplify the effect.
---
I have three so far
---
I don’t think that’s related probably just coincidence
---
There is an issue with PA mods at the moment.
---
Wood armor has the shrouded modification granted from a specific location in the Mire.
---
Wood armor is the best sneaking set in the game.
---
Wood armor is incredibly cheap to upkeep.
---
Do not remove it from legendary drops, this is just one of many re-posts of this exact subject that keeps coming up because people don't look through past posts.
---
I can. I bought the game for a friend, so I'm not going to lose any sleep. I'll definetly buy it soon, though. Thank you for telling me.
---
Yeah, I think it's nuts, too. I don't even do workshops anymore because of it. It's also fairly common to log onto a server and see that ALL the workshops are under the same guy, hoping someone will try and challenge so he can FT over and snipe you.
---
Dang bro sounds good but I'm PC!
---
As well as putting mods on weapons if you don’t have the plan learned.
---
Me too. I have to shoot at and bash my paper bags.
---
Check within the Atomic Shop under the C.A.M.P. heading.
---
How much will u pay for it?
---
We sent Field Scribe Dave down there... he was the "Kevin" of the group.
---
His Death was a blessing to us all.
---
&gt;we had also mentioned that we planned to bring similar damage protections to Adventure Mode players’ C.A.M.P.s in the future. This is a change that will prevent other players’ attacks from dealing damage to objects and structures you’ve built in your C.A.M.P.&gt;so long as you (or your Turrets) are not hostile against those players. We’re excited to let you know that we’re currently planning to roll this out with Patch 9 in early May.
---
Sound to me that even in adventure mode, if you engage that person in PVP their camp can still be destroyed.
---
But if you're not engaged in hostilities with that person their camp is protected.
---
Indeed. Takes a lot to make, goes really really fast. One big fight and it'll take weeks to craft replacements.

One of my build if it offers any ideas
---
Female here,  I always have my mic on. I've only had one person talk to me and he wanted to use my camp. Now I also play apex legends and I have men say some terrible shit to me. I just block them and keep playing.
---
I had to restart my Xbox to get the egg.
---
Yeah but when you have bounty everyone sees you on map, maybe if you were leader it may be good.
---
Yup.  I can snipe stuff well enough not to have to use a sniper weapon. It's scary how good you can get by eyeballing your shots without a sight.  Also try just snapping off shots 1 at a time instead of full auto -- super accurate and deadly used that way.  I usually don't use more than 1 -2 bullets per 60+ level ghouls at Whitesprings.  My light machine gun would probably chew through a couple of hunded rounds to clear Whitesprings.
---
BUT... Gatlings suck for super up-close fighting (think-in-your-face melee distance) You would want to ideally cripple or kill your enemy feet away not inches away.  If they get in that close and you can't back-up to get distance, pull a shotgun or melee weapon to get clear. If you have no choice and have to use the gatling - aim at thier feet and a little to the left - gatlings have weird aim super up close.
---
I always use my mic. When any men say rude stuff to me I absolutely roast the ever living shit out of them. Then they leave me alone
---
Try restarting your unit. Also check in the Atomic Shop under the C.A.M.P. heading, there was one towards the bottom of the stuff.
---
That looks great! I’m more having trouble with the layout of floors and what material I should use for walls with what I already have built.
---
Shotgun perks do not apply to the telsa rifle, try a google search fallout 76 tesla rifle perks.
---
I'd love a few places or events that were real hordes...mass of bodies. Sometimes at Harpers doing the lure event you get a few dozen super mutants. That's fun.
---
Alternative beginning for ghouls.

The bombs drop in the distance and there is a bright flash that staggers you and the screen eventually fades black. The words "Bethesda Game Studios Presents" fades into tbe screen, only to fade out. Eventually you start to come to...

---
I think its R &gt; T

Gazza!

Except the hand scanners...

I second this, checked stats before and after with and without perks, no changes
---
Armor doesn't really matter, I run a mostly Vanguard build and rarely use PA.  Incisor is huge for AA, and yeah, Blade of Bastet will get it done.  Together they stack for like 87% armor penetration.  I kind of think it's mostly because your right on top of them, same as it would work with say a Super Mutant with a minigun.  They can't really counter without some distance.  Also, if you ever find one try out a Suppressor's melee weapon.  I have various AA, Furious, Instigating, etc but I always go back to my Suppressors ski sword and combat knife.  It might just be my preference, but a fast melee seems to stack the suppressors effect(just a theory), leaving enemies almost helpless.
---
Also, you don't need ALL of the melee perks, lvl 1 of each style should do the trick if you have high strength.  There are a lot of badass melee weapons.
---
I really dont know, i was bashed for 5 pages on the official forums for postinh that i cant play in the nuke zones.
---
Common accusations:
---
-my computers was at fault
---
-didnt know how to use perk cards
---
-had the wrong weapon
---
-didnt shoot enough
---
-lag
---
-being low level (im lvl 220)
---
-not understanding the game
---
Nobody would even consider the possibility that the game itself would be at fault, because apparently they have never encountered this issue so it doesnt exist
---
I tried this.
---
Some folks just like to watch the (already destroyed) world burn my friend
---
I'd still farm Whitesprings if zero legendaries dropped. I get a majority of my radaway and stimpacks there. The other crap is darn good too.
---
Yeah, but it deletes the pictures and saved settings though.
---
The biggest lesson here is all junk bags are free game - some people have the mind to take them, and some have the mind to leave them.
---
It sucks. But it is what it is.  
---
I’ve had my stuff taken. I just get more stuff.  
---
Sometimes I respawn, grab my stuff, then just drop it anyway. I can regather what I need.
---
 I’m not trying to be mean, I just don’t see the sense in complaining to Reddit when it’s a very well known thing - you drop a lootable bag on death, and anyone can pick it. You don’t need to bother the person who took it. Just start gathering again.  
---
Heck there may be someone willing to fix your PA armor for you, free of charge.
---
I hear ya and it is satire
---
just wanna drop...capitalism is not a form of government
---
What occurred between USA and China was over resources despite diff government systems
---
If anything...Fallout tech by GA, Robco etc is far more advanced than what we have now.
---
This is a PvP mode I’m actually interested in
---
Xbox? I believe I have a reactive torso already set up on an excavator chest piece.
---
Gary 😡
---
Common my bum. I never have any because I use it to craft diluted stims and always have hundreds more stims than purified water.  Devs never fixed the bugs with the water purifiers either so I gave up farming them.
---
Not needed. I can build 3-4 building camps. Fully decorated. 
---
Turrets are dumb. Scrap them. Problem solved.

You were trying to cross border? When we got hit by an NCR ambush.

u/stealthymoth81
---
what's the point in collecting these eggs?
---
No, it's the only safeguard from assassin/sentinel users. Either adapt and find ways to counter or stop PvP'ing. 
---
Tip: Strip their Action Points by making them sprint/Cryo weapons. Stealth prevents VATS lock on, there's also that.
---
I do stay off mic for this exact reason. Luckily, I’ve met a few guys who are super cool, and made me feel comfortable enough that I can be on mic with them. Hopefully you can find the same, if you don’t run into any other women. :)
---
I saw that one too. I really feel like they missed the point of the story itself. Yeah, you could have a game set right before 76 with the downfall of what was left of west va and the rise of the scorch. But what kind of ending to a game is that??? The whole point of 76 being set after all that is the story is about taking the land back from the scorched and rebuilding. Before and after the scorched are 2 completely different games, the former probably being very short and unsatisfying to the player and the latter being fo76. NPCs alone don't make a fallout game good to me, it's the environment itself and the crafted world (whether or not it is devoid of humans).
---
Yes!
---
Yeah like sentinels/whatever is balanced and fun gameplay so you’re totally right lmao
---
Dude if I were you I’d F with them. I’d say stuff like “I bet my penis is longer than yours” &amp; stuff like that lol. Keep on keepin’ on friend.
---
Clean Pipe Plans PLEASSEE
---
THATS CALLED THE GAME.
---
I checked out a nuked Watoga proper a few weeks ago.  I went into the high school to see if the ghouls were glowing.  Not only were they not glowing, they weren't there at all.  I went through the entire school and found 1 glowing mutant hound in the basement.  During nukes, Watoga is a no man's land.  Literally.
---
There's actually a ton of awesome places that already feature plenty of raider-esque structures and odds and ends. 
---
They're great places to make camps. Building around existing structures can really allow you to build encampments. 
---
There's one near the observatory just off the train tracks with some raider cages and wall portions, as well as a little tower with a fishing boat for the top.
---
Yep most camp items are recycled from fo3 &amp; 4, so players coming straight into 76 may not know it.
---
Gary gArYy
---
I'm not daft enough to do PvP in this game, but I believe the principle is that you build up a VATS crit before you get into a PvP fight, and then spend it on their head. At least there was a rumor that crits bypass the assassin/sentinel damage reduction.
---
Alternatively, switch to a faster-firing semiauto rifle, spam them with Tank Killer and hope for a stagger.
---
Always hit them from stealth, and preferably invisible, so that they can't VATS you.
---

yeah gee it's not  like you see all the fucking companies in  the series being massive piles of suck, right?

---
I got one shotted by sniper build a few days back. Didn't get any warning and didn't even see him. Just Bam and dead. Then watched him trying to search my loot bag, didn't have a single junk on me as I had just deposited it all :D
---
The problem might to be how the game calculates all the different bonuses (weapon, legendaries, perks, stims, bobbleheads, magazines and criticals). If all the bonuses would only use the base damage of the weapon, it would limit the maximum to reasonable levels.
---
Say you have weapon that has base damage of 100
---
Legendary TS +25%
---
Perks +60%
---
Stims +25%
---
Bobbleheads +20%
---
Critical x2.5 Covert Ops Perk
---
Critical x2.4 Better Criticals Perk
---
Headshot x2.0
---
Now if all those bonuses use only the base damage you get 100(base)+25(TS)+60(perks)+25(stim)+20(bobblehead) = 230 damage
---
If the bonuses are calculated one by one you will get 100(base) + 25(TS) + 75(Perks 60% of base+TS) + 50(Stim 25% base+TS+Perks) + 50(Bobblehead 20% of base+TS+Perks+Stim) = 300 with a difference of 30% on damage per shot
---
Add to that the critical headshot damage from sneak 
---
Base Damage x (Sneak Multi + Crit Multi + Headshot Multi) 
---
230 x (2.5+2.4+2.0)=1587 damage per shot
---
300 x (2.5+2.4+2.0) = 2070 damage per shot
---
Both of those are enough to kill you no matter what kind of armor you are wearing if the shooter also has AA perks, weapon and ammo.
---
If the critical multiplier used the base damage of the weapon, matter would be very different.
---
230 + 100 x (2.5+2.4+2.0) = 920 damage per shot
---
300 + 100 x (2.5+2.4+2.0) = 990 damage per shot
---
Still a big damage number, but not a hit that would instakill PA or fully armored player, even with AA perks, weapon and ammo. 
---
I do not have any evidence on how the system calculates things and this is just speculation and thanks to [MaccaPakka](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaccaPakka) for theory crafting on [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wic1m/sneak_crit_headshot_multiplier_theory_crafting/)

Well good luck guys.
---
And yet considering the *timeline* they still came up with tech that would blow anyones mind today. Also..again *its satire*
---
but lets get back to your 'point'
---
Capitalism is *not* a form of government
---
G A R R Y
---
Tripping. Lay off the green ;)
---
Downvoting because you don't have a valid counter statement or because you literally didn't know how to counter? 
---
And the point of your comment is what exactly? Is your solution to have everything get nerfed? Have players do next to no damage?
---
They're not about to change an entire dynamic of the game because you don't agree with it. P.S Vats can still miss, you have to spec for it an in doing so you have a weakness.
---
Why are you salty over advice?
---
Can you post some pics? And some details about what your specifically getting hung up on?
---
I'm not a elaborately decorated CAMP kind of guy. 
---
I'm more of a building off interesting existing structures/locations. 
---
My current CAMP is actually built under a big Beaver dam I found. 
---

It's not much to look at from the outside. I was going for a not easily seen across the terrain kind of place. The first 15 seconds is the boring shop bit, then comes the underground log roofed portion.
---
Havent smoked in months unfortunately, but thanks.
---
Or give us an option to gather meat to make a Frankenstein creation.

Oh man I got SO EXCITED cause I totally want that but I'm on PC. :(
---
Oh, and anything Vampire is awesome, I think you should be able to get at least 2K for that.
---
There's a bug that wont let you attach mods to stuf unless you've learned the plan. They're working on fixing it
---
&gt;And yet considering the timeline they still came up with tech that would blow anyones mind today
---
...do  you really think labour just stops existing as  a concept under socialism?
---
&gt;Capitalism is not a form of government
---
No shit? 
---
&gt;One guy created the entire script? created the entire storyline singlehanded?
---
No, but he had the biggest influence on it.
---
&gt;and one game out of 6-7 of them (if u include tactics)
---
lmao the theme runs through the whole damn series (apart from maybe 1, which focuses more on the horrors of eugenics and unrestrained transhumanism). you're ignorant af
---
Wouldn't they break super fast at level 1?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I’m a female and I muted mic from the get go. I don’t get on it either, I just go around and do my own thing. I stay away from toxic players as much as possible. :)
---
Never.
---
You sir had me laughing my ass off, thanks! Last time at the train station I saw someone with a paper bag and I thought what kind of loot would I find in it?
---
Bethesda removed explosives from energy weapons for now. They can no longer drop with that prefix. People want them cause they may never be added back.
---
'ha ignorant af'...okay there child. Use full words. anyways...does labour stop existing...no but labour is not a FORM.of governance
---
I tried to destroy a camp tonight and couldn’t do it. Absolutely zero damage. Btw, I’ve only done this once before. It was a turret camp at the golf course and I did message him first to ask him to move it. Anyway, zero damage inflicted on any of the turrets.
---
Eta?
---
Sorry, my bad, gotta use big boy words for Mr. 400IQ over here.
---
My point is that these technologies can very well exist under a socialist system. Shit, satellites were invented in the USSR.
---
Have had that for 30 levels. Want something great. Thanks.
---
About to launch
---
Hopefully 15 mins or less to kill sbq
---
CAMP Pacifist Mode isn't in game yet, my camp behind the Flatwoods church got destroyed again, but a couple of level 200s. I haven't seen a CAMP in Whitesprings in so long, i also thought they had extended the no build area.
---
There are no energy weapon specific damage perks. A laser rifle is a rifle, ie rifleman perk line. An automatic laser rifle is an automatic weapon, ie commando.
---
So true on all those points.   I did not youtube anything about this game for that reason.   I still have not because of all the youtubers jumping on the "hate-fallout76" bandwangon to get more clicks.
---
No.
---
and *improved upon* in an a freer society..and what did USSR offer the rest of the world after sputnik?
---
Tool
---
Yeah. Power attacks takes roughly 3% per swing
---
Should be able to just strap a tank of Mr. handy fuel to it as if it was a plasma core.
---
Yeah I know that much. I can see the appeal from a collector standpoint. They're still way over paying for something that isn't useful in combat. A TSE laser is a different story though.
---
Go t ok whitesprings and you'll see little baby Gary's baby stroller
---
Yeah, my build was really messed up.  My character is level 140 now and still working on fixing it.   Every level over 50 will allow you to move 1 point or get 1 card.  So that's the way to fix your character.
---
I thought that as well. First time in a long time I’ve seen one there. It was a level 26 and 88 player in the area. I messaged the owner but he wasn’t getting my point. Turned off pacifist and tried to destroy the turrets. My bloody DCG did Zero damage. Must be a bug or something.
---
Sucks its for the .44 and not the western. the only .44 I use is the voice of set, and you can't apply the paint to it.
---
Really you cant apply it to the western? But their design is the same.
---
When you go back in the future and dont break the ToS.
---
As someone who needs that beautiful dark elixir to function in the morning I totally agree with this statement
---
No it does not. 
---
Equip the awareness perk card and look at the targets resists. Now equip an AA handmade or other ballistic weapon and look again. The target's DR has been lowered(this works for AA magazines as well).
---
Now do the same with any AA energy weapon. You will clearly see that the targets ER has not been reduced. This has been reported and Betheasda has said they are looking into it, but no word on an eta.
---
PVP is all about VATS. Few shots with VATS perks &amp; VATS friendly weapon, you're good to go. Other builds are meh.
---
If you equip the awareness perk under perception it will show you exactly how AA works. When you vats something and have an AA weapon you can see their ballistic resistance drop, but the energy resistance stays the same. 
---
Anyone can try it out. I encourage others to try it and see for themselves.
---
Joining!
---
You have pacify on, you need to turn it off, I did the same thing, felt like an idiot laughing nukes and no damage ..
---
I’m a girl as well and I also tend to stay away from using a mic. I think I’ve only used the mic once, and it was honestly a great experience since I was playing with a young boy. Honestly the whole experience was just so pure, but in the same situation if I had known it was a grown man I wouldn’t have gone on mic because of the possibility of being harassed. I will say from my time playing, I’ve never really heard anybody on mics unless they were on a team.
---
If you die, your junk is mine. Haha to low health builds.
---
Them legendaries are garbo though except the deathclaw one.
---
Yes one way up elevator.
---
I checked and it showed off. I could hear them on area chat as well but my audio was showing team chat. A scorchbeast came anyway and destroyed all the turrets for me.
---
Personally I had 70 because with chemist and super duper you can get hundreds of diluted stims for a fraction of that in regular stims. Easy meds. I scrapped them all because Bethesda never bothered to fix the purifiers though.
---
Wow I didn't expect this response the only reason I don't scrap mine is the innate desire to not be lonely in my base.
---
They really need to make at least 10 skins for each weapon, price it right and atoms will sell like hot cakes. People LOVE to personalize their weapons, this is a a shooter game ffs, currently there are so many dumb hairstyles but nearly none weapon skins. Just bought the chrome minigun skin and love it, how do I dress up my other three miniguns so i know which is which? Come on Bethesda wake up and start working on your biggest cash cow.
---
Just bought it and love it.

also, also...i didnt say "big boy words" i aaid use *full* as in "af"...as fuck...jesus...your reading comp is terrible. Ciao bro. getting all worked up over a satricial video game that has no basis in reality and constantly ignoring "capitalism is NOT a form of governance"

You definitely need to leave a box of boiled water, some canned dog food, and a cassette tape in there.

Why is such a overkill number allowed to exist? There needs to be more defenses/hp to prevent this stuff.
---
I’m just waiting (im)patiently for the golden knife paint
---
I use unyielding wood armor and I plan to keep wood armor and turn it into tokens
---
wood is surprisingly hard to ignite if it's just solid wood, try to light a campfire without tinder and you'll see, cloth and leather is actually much more flammable.
---
**DEATH IS PREFERABLE TO COMMUNISM**
---
Awareness works like that it actually shows penetration results?
---
Hahaha Good one!
---
If you max rank either Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer under charisma, then you can tame creatures to defend your base. Most animals are covered under AF, Snallygasters are the only thing I know of that is restricted only to WW, so I recommend AF if you only max one card. You cannot tame the other criptids, Mirelurk Queens, or Scorchbeasts as far as I’ve seen.
---
There is a bunch of misinformation around regarding taming, but from my experience the rules seem to be...
---
1. Must be from a random encounter spawn. No set spawns, so the Kings in the Wendigo Cave are not tameable.
---
2. Must be completely solo. For example: there is a random spawn that is a single Deathclaw with a nest. That does not count as solo. The animal cannot spawn with anything else.
---
3.  You need to be a higher level than the creature. Supposedly twice the level, but that rule doesn’t apply with scorched animals (I was able to tame a lv. 40 scorched Radtoad at lv. 56).
---
You on xbox?
---
I have gotten to the stage where if I see someone’s junk in like Whitespring and there’s other people around (especially if I saw them die), then I will sit on top of their junk until they get back so others can’t nick it.
---
Sounds good. Make it a big part of the game that people can actually use. Right now it’s wayyy too buggy and unusable for long term.
---
morgantown the make-shift camp in the road near the tattoo parlor and vtu in the green tent on the desk one will spawn, may have to sever hop a few times to get it
---
I leveled my first character to 56 over the course of a few weeks. Just leveled a second one with a different build, currently 61, in a week. Once you know what you're doing, it doesn't take long.
---
Yep.  They p155 me off. What makes it worse is when you see one of their owners... custom paint PA, 200+lvl, god tier wep.  Cmon chap, really, do u really need to be doing this?
---
Those pricks should F off back to COD
---
Good one, don't argue any of the things i said. Let me guess you just ignored the whole post because that's what you did the last two times. I was in no way mean or ignorant to you unless i felt you were being condescending to me. I'm telling you facts about the way these things work. I'm fine with companies making money to further development on a game i love to play, but i don't like the way these are implemented 90% of the time with "limited items" etc. That's all i was trying to say is there are tricks to get you to spend money, and you tell me that it's false and im crazy, which isn't the case you're just blind to the facts. You're exactly the kind of person they hope to get to buy this kind of stuff anyways.
---
My bf, his son (15), and I all play 76 together. I bought it first for my ps4, son played and liked it so I bought it on his shared ps4 with dad. Dad played and liked it so bought a 3rd ps4 and another copy of 76. Sure have spent a lot but it's been great. Weekends are spent together in Appalachia!
---
READ THIS. That old glitch people used to level up, indefinitely disarming traps for experience with home defence? Still works, sort of. Can’t do it indefinitely but with a macro on pc you can disarm a single trap between 5 to 200 times. It’s random. You can get a few thousand fuel by server hopping a flamethrower trap in about 10 minutes, so long as you don’t get screwed and keep getting placed in the same server no matter how many times you relog.
---
I don’t condone using exploits most of the time but at this point it’s pathetic that Bethesda haven’t fixed fuel being so massively overpriced in terms of crafting.
---
Yep use awareness and hit vats with a normal weapon and again with an AA one. You'll see the DR change.
---
It use to not show AA from mags but I believe that has been fixed. Forgive me if not. I know for a fact it works for AA legendaries though.
---
How much of a delicate flower are you that "There was a feature that was in another fallout game, it was great and would be helpful!" is considered bitching? So sensitive! I'm sorry for confronting you and suggesting your favorite game could be improved, I hope I didn't frighten you.
---
Gaaaarrryyyyy....
---
I'm a little jealous.
---
You get to acquire all of your achievements.
---
Yet 20 SBQ kills later I have yet received the scorched earth achievement.
---
It seems to be a bug that’s been present for a couple patches now.
---
You shouldn’t be able to get wood armor from 3 star legendaries. That’s an easy fix, wood can only be 1 star’s (not sure if it’s bugged or supposed to be like that) so you should only get it from 1 star legendaries.
---
Unfortunately a lot of the achievements are bugged.
---
Your saying if I equip stinging vs (forgot the name of magazine) prolifrating magazine it will change such counter?

I play with my girlfriend pretty regularly. If you're on Xbox, hit me up: I Am Fake News. Fuck those assholes. Don't give in. Don't avoid talking to people because of some jerks. Otherwise they win.  They want to make disgusting comments? Fine. Let them. It says more about them than it does about you.

Good thing he makes games and not laws. 
---
You know COMMUNISM!!! Has killed 94 million.... coz it doesn't fucking work. 
---
If you think communism is a good idea you need a big slap.
---
They want them because with the right build they are OP as fk,  not the aae laser though, others.
---
I'll give you a nuke card and 250 caps to do it again
---
Give me 5 mins, making a quick trade. Join my aerver id you want I had to hop
---
Yeah, this happened to me twice in the last week or so. Once she spawned she flew far south, then unglitched after 10 minutes, but flew to Watoga at only a few % health with less than a minute remaining on the timer. The other time she glitched into the terrain, but luckily came back up.
---
I've noticed SBs in general being more buggy than usual, especially in Surface to Air. Must have been the Apr 9th patch.
---
Seems like the meta is: you go into nuke zone = handicap you to make things harder. Hazmat and PA has no legendary effects so they basically don’t want legendary armor in nuke zones.
---
Its starnge that even when a Shotty has a 90% reduced weight it still weighs 10 lbs

You're to need a *really* big pillowcase.

I could understand these things happening in an alpha stage game or maybe even beta, but 76 has been fully released for like 6 months. This should be illegal.
---
Now I'm tempted to place an empty camp in the wild with just a single egg tucked away in plain sight.
---
I'm at watago station.
---
Oh okay thank you that is the symbol
---
It should yes. I swear I heard that got fixed. But I may indeed have misspoke. I'm not in game to test atm. But use awareness perk and use vats to target something with a normal unmodded weapon so you can see the target's base resists. Then equip your weapon with AA magazine and the DR should change based on the value of the mag's AA.
---
I'm not gonna be back into the game till tomorrow so if you try that jump back here and confirm please. So I can stop spreading false info's if it hasn't actually been fixed yet.  :-)
---
If only it worked that way with power armor too...
---
Sucks running Excavator and a single piece breaks and you lose over 100 carry weight in the process, forcing you to walk to the nearest power armor station that you know of to repair. Unless you have a mobile camp, then it isn't a terribly big deal.
---
Same issue here. Purchased fire axe mod and can’t apply. Do I need to get the makeshift perks before game will allow me to do so?
---
Oh yeah. Stupid UFO CAMPS will sprout from this no doubt. But I'll take it anyway.... Building is such a pain right now.
---
I totally agree
---
Im on the game now so I'll try to confirm for ya. I think you're right though.
---
Only the 44, the other revolvers have no paints yet. I have the gold paint on my 44. It's OK. I'd like it more if they were sets rather than individual items, and I agree about things being removed.
---
System? If it xbox count me in. 148 explosive heavy gunner. Running a full set of van sent marine, or x01

I want a Golden Corral fudge fountain. You gotta let baby ghouls drop scrap items in it like real life though...
---
I never saw it as an end game area.  The Mire is more of a mid game area and for people that would be in the 40 to 50 level range it would be very challenging.  
---
We are trying to evaluate it based on our level 100+ characters that have been around since the beta and have the benefit of some of the best weapons in the game.  We are really looking at it though the wrong lens.  Look at it from the perspective of a newer player who is going though the main quest still and just got to the area and it would be closer to what Bethesda described.    
---
It still needs some work and will hopefully be instanced at some point in the future but it still serves its purpose for where it's located in the game.  I'm sure the vault raids will be much, much harder as they are described as end game content.  Let's just take a step back and look at the burrows from another angle and appreciate it for what it is.
---
Like I said in my post. This lying Lowe content felt like hunting was the theme. 
---
All we needed was scopes, body types, bolt tips.  And we would have a decent weapon to carry through the game. Sure it wouldn’t have been top tier but something fun.
---
Booting back up
---
is it cool? a little, but just no. Maybe in a future modded version of the game if that's what you're into but i feel it would definitely just ruin the base game for myself. The way I see it is if you want to be something/someone other than a vault dweller then just RP it. You want to be a raider? just walk around being a douche and destroying crap. Want to be a wendigo? go full out unyielding and cannibal with a ss unarmed weapon and a few mutations.  want to be a super mutant? just stare at a wall and constantly say me the strongest super mutant.
---
Ok cool btw how much pen does it give between stinging and that other pen magazine

One day soon... It's very very requested and they claim to be listening.
---
So a clan? I’d definitely be down for something like this. It’d also help more people start playing in teams. Maybe clans can earn a total amount of experience and earn some kind of cosmetic or a level system of sort.
---
Maybe they aren't locked as items that your team-mates can place at your camp?
---
This is about your underage sibling playing an M/17+ rated game and whining that people were rude?
---
Then wanting Bethesda to enforce punishment on the people of a legitimate age playing the game how they wanted to? Is that right?
---
I'm not condoning the actions of assholes but you're not in the right either. Two wrongs don't make you righter.
---
Your complaint is like taking a kid to a bar or a strip club and then demanding they stop serving alcohol or dancing cos your kid is there.
---
Fallout football league. If you don't catch it you and half the field die.
---
Haha, the missinformation and humans. Love it.
---
I have gear and ammo on one account that fits perfect on another and it;s just stuck there. I don;t want greedy over weight fat cat hoarder mules, just quality of life. MY melee build is sitting on loads of ammo my rifleman could be using and my rifle man has weapon/armor my melee could be using.  I refuse to waste my time and another persons by constantly swapping char and items around or even risking losing them .
---
Does nuking the burrows work since it's not in the world zone?
---
Nuke, nuke, nuke
---
I saw something even stranger:  Two of the same guy:
---
[Now there's two of them!](https://i.imgur.com/qCLhmjB.jpg)
---
I'm on PC
---
I've been in the same boat.  I love doing the SBQ fights.  They are so chaotic and random some times.  There is no right way to run the queen and no wrong way to do it.  
---
I love how everyone on the server gets as close to the queen as they can and just starts to unload on her the moment she's in range of their weapons.  
---
A few nights back someone launched a nuke and a little bit before it landed a few of us took down a lvl 80 SB and I just had to toggle my mic like 20 seconds before the nuke landed and said "ok, who's ready for the main course?" as I was loading a fresh box of .50 cal into my gun.
---
Easy there Satan...
---
We should be able to be liberty prime.
---
One time use xD
---
Sorry, it's his house now.
---
All mods are affected, unless crafted from a plan.
---
Oh god no
---
Yes and the results are lucrative! I farmed about 30+ legendaries in one nuke run, some of which above 1 star.
---
Yes since last update mods won't attach on anything
---
Damn is this a recent bug? I just came back to the game
---
I did it 10min after release and two 1* wood armor were dropped. Did I finish the quest? Yep. Do I have something else to do down there? Nope, since they don't make a decent replayable dungeon.
---
These are the moments that make us the NPCs...
---
As of the Renaming patch, yeah.
---
I could of swore I heard it the day I did the lying Lowe questline and heard it again whilst out exploring. Unfortunately I do not have a video
---
This was my main gripe. Use of the term hacked.
---
So... Cliffside camps with way extended foundations?
---
"Baaaah"
---
I do it right?
---
More immersion breaking than the current camps that are built with a single foundation and stairs going upwards to a huge house floating above?
---
Thank you what sh** menu Xbox has so you can’t do this in the game once found in Xbox menu under People menu click join game nothing happens - prob person is offline doesn’t tell you.
---
I want a chrome skin for x-01 armor and the .50. Right now I use the chrome minigun with the chrome excavator armor but a. The excavator DR sucks balls and B. I only have a two shot minigun, I’d need a TSE minigun to make it viable.
---
No, you are not getting a compensation from Bethesda. Neither anyone of us.
---
More like if your server is filled with 100+ characters, i.e. decently populated at a regular playing time.
---
The stars only required if you're trying something nutty, like solo'ing as a low level (sub 50) with only level 2's joining the event to increase adds.
---
TBH most of the time when I join a queen fight, it is over all too quickly.
---
I only did 3, over 76, in Watoga, in fancy pants.
---
I agree. I don't want to waste caps to get rid of all my mutations then buy them back just because they can't fix a bug.
---
You slipped like a lot over here. Cosmetics are pay to win. Damn. Lol. In fact, lel.
---
&gt; unyielding / bloodied build where everything is about stealth an not getting hit at all.
---
Ah, Low health build doesn't guarantee meaning stealth / no hit. That's one direction for sure, but the other direction is being extra tanky with blocker/suppressor/serendipity. For PA: Emergency protocols, for regular armor, sentinel's or cavelier's (or enemy specific prefix like troubleshooting)
---
As salty as these people are who are against people who have paid for the game to be able to play the game. Thay are just pathetic, just about every good piece of armor and handmade that makes every one half way decent at this game has mostly come from the duping. " But it broke the game " the game was broken before and after duping. Servers still crash and people that can't win without there hand getting held cry when they don't get there way.
---
To answer the question this post is about, probably when the company can actually figure out how to properly fix the crap they break every update. So when that happens in 7 years they'll unbanned people. Lol
---
Definitely synths.
---
My camp is in BFE, and I normally play in adventure. I had a level 100+ stop in today. I have a station with pretty much everything someone could want set up outside, and my house is locked. I still unlocked my house and let them use whatever. I accepted a trade invite, but they didn't request or offer anything, and after, while I left them and went back about my business, they started tossing grenades around. I just logged off the server, but it's still a pain. Why don't these jackasses just move over to survival?
---
My first ever legendary was a crossbow with 4shot +1per and +10% dam, it is still my favorite thing to use
---
You're probably right but personally I don't feel the need to get personal about him like that.
---
i’m on Xbox
---
I stand corrected, thank you.
---
That’s not totally true. They didn’t originally, and I believe don’t anymore, but I’m 99% sure the owner of NukaCrypt got the codes from a hacker who accessed the Dev Room at least once- to prove a point? I remember a post about it here a few months back.
---
Did you lag out?
---
I don’t think any exist, besides the Quantum paint?
---
Not on PS4 but you should try to  setup a 1v1 or team v team in the burrows. One team or person enters the north entrance and the others go in the south. Once inside it's basically a pvp arena.
---
We could use honorable soldiers like yourself. https://discord.gg/SUqWXMb
---
Hold. He may have got kicked.....
---
Does it appear as an event?
---
Just dropped!
---
Yea especially as there is very little difference between all the revolvers
---
Carry a gamm gun and some pumkin grenades. They're a bit of a joke for most things in game but wreck other players, especially unyielding builds.
---
I hope the link works but this is my stealth sniper build. You could swap out rifle for commando. And in strength swap traveling pharmacy for iron fist 3 and carry around death claw gauntlet or power fist. It downs scorched beasts quickly. Any instigating rifles are powerful. I've even found myself using a two shot .38 combat rifle to just burn thru .38 ammo and that still drops enemies
---

---
Last night I found something that looked like a nest littered with bones and two dead brahmin  next to it. When I went close I heard a loud moo but there wasn't anything near. This was near Charleston station
---
This has happened to me also. I’d say 1 out of 3 times I waste thousands of ammunition on her because she vanished or something due to bugs. It’s not acceptable months on that the only end game boss is still broken.
---
I've never used vats with my first two builds but now with this set up, concentrated fire 3 is amazing.
---
...You know this is a fucking great idea! Or some way of converting the Mr Handy fuel.
---
They literally use flamethrowers!
---
Try to lure her away from FS Delta / DS V-9. People being on roofs/unlandable locations can bug her out like this.
---
Ooohhhhhh Gaarrryyyyy?!
---
How is that in ESO I can have top build and I still have a challenge? If "god" build is so OP, then f#cking nerf it. 
---
If first dungeon raid were impossible, I would want to play it even more and would be eagerly waiting next one even more. I would play even more, I would be even more excited getting better gear. I would be more excited to find people to play with.
---
Press T and then R. If there is no R there is no need to repair
---
3 so far. Usully have to close and reload the game to get the new atomic shop items to show up.
---
Sure but what about placing blueprints or moving camp?  There is no "first placed foundations".  How will this work?  Probably same, cannot place complex camps.
---
I made a joke lol I’m the salty one? You seem exactly like the type that would enjoy the current pvp we have haha
---
Two things:
---
1) They disappear weekly on monday nights, not after 48 hrs.
---
2) nukacrypt dot com, go there for the weekly passwords. You don't need silo code pieces.
---
Gary!!
---
Why would they do something that makes sense? That’s silly.
---
I’d remove 3 from strength and add them to luck.
---
My there is so much you can add in there that helps also tenderizer is very useful
---
I enjoy PvP because there's so many viable options. PvP is fine. If someone has dedicated enough time to buff himself and/or earn the gear to take almost no damage an return a high amount GG. If he can do it, why aren't you?
---
I would prefer Survival to remove legendary effects and mutations so you got a true PvP experience. But i don't mind it as it is, i can either run a PA bloodied build or run sneak build? 
---
What next, someone pulls out a stealth boy on you "Damn invisi bots stealth boys an chameleon should be removed"? 
---
Tell you what i'm gonna be sarcastic an agree. I mean yeah bro! I hate Stealth boys. I can't use my VATS on anyone using stealth, remove it from the game please.
---
See the flaw?
---
Or a gamma gun which will oneshot them, even when trying to charge you with cavlier gear.
---
[Definitely synths](https://i.imgur.com/Qluv6lk.png)
---
No takers so I'm going to see how my level 6 character will handle Survival. What could possibly go wrong?!
---
You are actually so delusional lol
---
No, you would need to facilitate it as a player made event. If I were doing it I would setup a dicord for players looking for a pvp style event that would take place within the burrows. It would require some dialog between players wanting to participate in it with rules. Rules such as one team or individual goes into the northern entrance and the others go into the southern entrance. No pvp contact outside of the Burrows other than playground rules. Pvp would only occur within the burrows. Outside in harpers ferry would be neutral territory. The Burrows is a great arena for pvp. But everyone on the server would need to be ok with that. I'm  referring to survival mode. So take my idea with a grain of salt. Griefers will inevitability show up.
---
Also try tenderizer ..
---
Skyrim still crashes on all platforms. Even with 8 years of patches. All Bethesda games do. I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't something they can ever fix.
---
Assault rifles aren’t heavy weapons and I use a .50 and ballistic gatling, haven’t had it happen. Pretty sure it’s heavy energy weapons.
---
Don't accept trade invites either.  They just want to see what equipment you got on your character.  If they know you have lower equipment than them, they will try ganking you.
---
I never have accepted a team invite from anyone.  Helping someone save 11 caps or risk my camp being demolished?  They will pay their 11 caps and like it!   11 caps is nothing anyway.  That is like 1 or 2 guns found and sold.  Why bother someone else for so trivial a thing?
---
Delusional because i don't conform to your opinion? Ok, logical conclusion.
---
Delusional, is thinking an entire feature should be removed because you don't like it.
---
Not the cheapest solution but if you craft flamers they give you 100 fuel.
---
Hey, I'm interested. Ive sent you a friend request
---
Ah.... Gary
---
Also interested in y we pick up blue,red,yellow paint but can't use...
---
You’re delusional because you made up that I want some feature removed... I expressed that I, and most people, don’t enjoy sentinel... you’re so dumb lmao
---
Sweet! Adding you now
---
Biocomm mesh (optional) 50% chem duration, chem fiend 100% duration, and pharmacist +100% rad away duration, are your best friends in a nuke zone. One diluted rad away alone will take away half a health bar's worth of radiation.
---
Add chemist and super duper onto diluted rad away, and you'll never realistically be out of rad away so long as you can carry it all (pharmacist helps with this).
---
Of course teammates sharing rad sponge rank 3 are always welcome too. 
---
Not trying to justify anything, just trying to help deal with radiation.
---
Shame.. I was hoping it to have some actual function or special effects. :c
---
I suggest you change your 2 handed melee to a bloodied gauntlet gets higher dmg and requires only three perk points (iron fist), that way you can move points elsewhere
---
"Couldn’t agree more remove it against players it’s impossible to balance"
---
Copy and paste, your words.
---
"You made up that i want it removed"
---
Keep digging pal, that grave is getting large.
---
Want cheese with your whine?
---
Its "ridiculous" to think that thousands of players got along with half your current stash limit just fine but you are unable to manage.   
---
You can even look back in reddit posts and see their amazing places.
---
Is vats not targeting players removing a feature? 🤔 what a child lmao
---
Blooded rollign pin? gimme! lol \*anything\* bloodied is quite good. Explosive gatlings are always welcome. Nice find. GLHF
---
It says right there he’s on pc...
---
I know it sounds harsh, but don't look at the player as if he is "stealing", the game intended for others to loot your junk as part of the Death penalty
---
They could add an Inside the Vault Podcast to the Radio and Video feed to the televisions.
---
This precisely.
---
Pour countless hours into getting dark matter, only to slowly but consistently lose interest in the fast paced monotony. 
---
This game is a mess, but it's a mess that I've absolutely enjoyed. Sure, the crashes/glitches/framedrops can be annoying, but the heart of the game is gold, and I wish people would realize that the devs are real people, who are trying to make good experience.
---
Its just a late April fools joke is all...
---
You want this, huh, do you???
---
Fairly biased place to ask
---
What? Who said anything about it not being a feauture? Dude you're so stupid you're not even on the damn topic. 
---
You LITERALLY said you WANTED vats vs players removed.
---
Then you said i made that up. 
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
For me I can mod any weapon just fine but can’t mod very specific power armors, either from scratch or with the mod in my inventory. It’s pathetic.
---
Look up the thosand other posts qith the same exact title.
---
Had a bloody pump action shotgun and a bloody pipe rifle drop a couple of days ago was going to sell them to a bot but decided to try them when I had loads of rads.. I can see the appeal of them ... still not for me though
---
I don't understand how your build can take up to 90. I don't think there are that many cards on level 50. If you pick them sensibly it should be done early, my character was done on lvl 54 or something. But it is goldplating your build. I could have done it earlier.
---
Not sure why all the downloads, it just is not that hard. I am extremely casual. Last 3 days I only did some building.
---
No that happens to me on the biv daily building, you just have to server hop
---
Consider me a willing.... Member
---
Are you good, man?
---
I think you're taking reddit a little too seriously.
---
I have been experiencing the same problem, all settings look fine as they did before but no voice chat sounds whatsoever.  
---
I thought I had seen someone post a potential fix, so I'll go look if I saved it. (fingers crossed)
---
Why would I use a deathclaw gauntlet if I'm a sniper?
---
Is there an issue with phantom devices too?
---
Just stop pudding this is ridiculous, he directly quoted your own comment. 
---
Directly, you then backpeddle and accuse him of making it up when the comment is there for everyone to see, you're a reet legitimately.
---
Bug or something.  But if you don’t want it, there ya go. Lol.
---
It’s mainly because the first image in the store the nuke bits are grey, and in the other two pictures they look orange.
---
I (wrongly) assumed they were lit up like the lamp.
---
That’s not off topic lmao you can still vats npc’s you just wouldn’t have an aimbot for players. Modifying is not removing. The best part is that you think you’re making me look dumb. Sorry you have a different opinion and can’t contain you’re childish temper
---
Suck....I think the server crashed and booted people....I crashed twice and had to rejoin. And the mobs were insane
---
There were only 3 of us. Fucking wack
---
Did you see anything?
---
Wait, there's a seperate sub that actually has some positivity?
---
This one has been rough lately, everyone bitching about Squatch is too hard and Burrows is too easy.
---
The bug reports, I get, but I'm always just glad to have more content. 
---
(and I feel like bug reports would go a lot better if people weren't constantly insulting the devs)
---
Lol just reading back through you can’t even understand basic sarcasm and it clearly gets you so grumpy haha
---
“As salty as these people are” ... goes on a salty tirade about Bethesda xD
---
Yep my ragtag set of full unyielding actually looks kinda cool, too :-) The pieces vary from lvl 20 to lvl 50.
---
Yep it's what reddit is for.
---
Skyrim, Fallout 3. Though with how many skyrim ports there are now I guess you could class it as a new game.
---
Have you sold this gun? I am on PC. I am interested
---
I wouldn't accept that.
---
Ok well I’ll buy 2 for 4000
---
Apiece
---
And why would they remove VATS from Players and only keep it as a PvE tool? It's been a CORE dynamic since Fallout 1, and has dedicated perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L requirements.
---
Do you not understand how incredibly dumb of an idea that is? "Lets just remove an entire feature from the fame so all those players with required perks feel like they've wasted their time"?
---
You're clearly unable to handle criticism and it really shows.
---
That would be a welcomed addition.
---
Sarcasm does not translate through text......
---
Best weapon: Knowledge. 
---
You don't actually have to do the silo all in one go. You can exit and re enter the same silo. There's also plenty of crafting stations if you go look for them. 
---
You don't even have to actually kill any robots to even do the silo, you just have to complete the objectives to move onto the next segment... which have nothing to do with actually killing robots-- though robot killing is useful at the last section (but not actually required). 
---
Pay attention to the actual objectives, and feel free to ignore the quest marker in order to familiarize yourself with the layout of the silo, rather than blindly follow a dot.
---
Gaaaaaaary.
---
Girl who plays on Xbox here. I tend to stay off the mic but not on purpose, I get really into what I'm doing and don't talk much unless I'm fighting something and having a difficult time.
---
I also have a lot of side conversations with my fiance irl and don't want all of Appalachia to hear lol
---
The few times I have been on the mic consistently i was on a team and didn't have any trouble sith rude comments.
---
Through the falseness and absurdity of the statement along with word choice and the emoji... yeah it was clear lol
---
But they can change the ghoul spawns at whitesprings.  Make it so its randomly spawns and not tied to players.
---
They wont be able to predict the spawns anymore.
---
I always check the map to see if anyone is near the club before going there.   Won't go if there are.
---
I once had a mod for fallout where you could craft anything for one cap, so I crafted a never ending fatman and a load of mini nukes. Little did i know that these mini nukes were melee weapons and that I could punch enemies and literally explode.
---
Lol just got into a SBQ server before bed, not EVEN 15 seconds into hacking away with my axe I get the absolutely stomach dropping game break sound (don’t know how to describe it but we all know what I’m talking about). Just got off :-/ Xbox forum was dry &amp; wasn’t gonna wait again for one to pop up.
---
It works good if your a sniper build, and don't use vats... Actually snipe from distances... Granted its poo for medium/short range encounters but at a long distance it's a great prefix to have. I only used one piece of armor with chameleon though. 
---
I either use a sniper/rifleman build, just swapping around perks and I have no trouble with players or npcs.
---
The only comment with an emoji, was the one where you called him a child. 
---
The comment you originally called a "joke" was this; "Couldn’t agree more remove it against players it’s impossible to balance"
---
You've changed your story twice so far and not once has it made sense or linked up with what's been stated.
---
Go to bed kid, it's way past your bedtime.
---
A core dynamic doesn’t necessarily mean a good one and this isn’t a typical fallout. The fact it’s a real player on the other end changes everything. While I would prefer it disabled against players it doesn’t absolutely need removed but needs heavy tweaking to not be such an absurdly easy win. At no point have I take any of your criticism seriously as you acted like a joke the whole time.
---
It looks good from about 300 feet away...
---
And downvoting is what downvoting is for.
---
The cake is a lie
---
Lmao that wasn’t what I said was sarcastic
---
Same reason youd use your slugger cards. When things get close if you wanna smack em instead of shoot them.
---
But honestly I havent needed to use it since and have just shot everything.
---
Haters are gonna hate. The truth hurts don't it bud.
---
Me too, and I don’t look inside so I’m not tempted to steal it myself. They might have 3k steel and I don’t want to ruin their day. The only time I would take something is if someone died right after SBQ, I would scroll to the bottom, take the violet flux and leave the rest.
---
It’s a 4 year old game engine what do you expect? It’s literally the F4 engine put into a 24 player online server. If Bethesda does make another online game (I think they should, this is a lesson learned. Also could be fallout or elder scrolls, love the whole Bethesda set) I think they’ll obviously update the engine &amp; the game won’t end up like this
---
And again do you not understand how dumb that suggestion is when you have to unlock and have specific perks active or that playstyle. If another played attacked him he is IMMEDIATELY at a disadvantage because you just disabled VATS in PvP?
---
I'm so happy you're not a developer dude, i really fucking am, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
---
It’s called being a cunt.
---
Is a deathclaw or power fist really better than a grognak axe?
---
Also at what point have I changed my story? I’m enjoying someone incapable of adult conversation on the internet misinterpreting and getting upset over my comments lol you chimed in clueless too
---
Depends, with my strength build and all unyeilding armor I can get my bloodied powerfist/deathclaw higher than my bloodied super sledge. Plus it's only 1 rank 3 card vs 3 rank 3 cards. I personally like them more.
---
Most definitely. It could help those who don't have the fusion generator but I still like to have it for my fusion generator so that I can manage my power effectively. 
---
Decontamination shower: 30
---
Water purifier X6: 24
---
Lights X19: 19
---
Power used: 73/100
---
And I'm still building over time.
---
Yeah, there are a lot of awesome people in this game. There a few people who reaaaally helped me out in this game, and its lovely how good the community is compared to other games.
---
Stay in PA, keep your mouth shut, and just listen to the absurdity. All while kicking ass.
---
Then out of the blue, fire up that mic and politely tell them "Good game,  *insert tip here* if you're trying to make a better PvP build"
---
"Dude, that can't be a chick!" is about the only response I get before I chuckle and walk away. 
---
It helps that I have the GT of a prepubescent boy, so I think that just makes it hilarious to all.
---
But I normally play in parties, so no in game mic. But I've never actually played with another female in a party, never have any problems. Just gotta find the right people to play with.
---
Wow, you a dumb one.
---
I would be willing to have a themed package for our camps, similar to the themes for your home in FO3. Just so us lay decorators have a quick way to make our house our home.
---
I have no idea what I’m talking about because I have a different opinion. Pre-teen confirmed. At range the guy that doesn’t have to aim doesn’t have an advantage? How is tweaking something through buffing or nerfing for balance a dumb suggestion? At exactly what point did you say to yourself “This guy no like vats. This guy piece of crap.”?
---
Lmao says the one that goes around calling other people a joke when they have an intelligent logical thought out argument that can't be countered you literally back peddle, play the "you made it up" card, then when called out just calls them stupid? Even when said evidence is supplied?
---
Ok. Enjoy the basement for the rest of your life.
---
Nah man, just yeet that shit.  Ain't no need to aim.
---
Also when I use unyeilding with my build I get more to all special except endurance, so more carry weight more perception and more agility(vats). I can go thru a lot of shots. Only card I wish to add is gun fu so I auto snap to my next target when I get a vats kill and it does more dmg
---
My bloodied 3 star combat knife with 40% swing speed says hello :-)
---
I also just said I’m open to leaving players targetable with balance tweaks but don’t let me settle your naive temper haha
---
This guy over hear mentioning a trading sub and not linking to it.  Sheesh.
---
I’m downvoting your terrible attitude, not any of the nonsense you’re saying.
---
Downside to low endurance is low hp. And lower charisma kinda sucks when selling. Also since I believe its charisma that effects legendary drops not luck. Those are my only complaints. For endurance I swap the dog food perk and the nuka cola perk when I need to eat/drink or heal with food vs stimpacks then throw back rejuvenated for the extra ap bonuses being well fed etc
---
I was honestly expecting brutality. And when they started shooting I was pretty disappointed that everything was seemingly true.
---
So glad I opened that message. I didn't even know what the paper bag looked like. Found it pretty funny after the fact because I've noticed it happen a few times when someone drops items.
---
Hell what’s to stop someone from like, idk,... crouching?... lol the vats mechanic against players is a balance nightmare because it’s either fully specced and essentially auto-aim, annoyingly luck based victories, or utter worthlessness
---
Everyone is crouching so no, it's not all about vats at all, quite the opposite in fact!
---
I literally just told you I’m open to it. I do think it’s basically impossible to balance but I don’t think it can’t be in a better place. Nice edit there btw lmao
---
And that's called a backpeddle, a change of story/topic because again "Couldn’t agree more remove it against players it’s impossible to balance"
---
That's not "change VATS" that's "remove it" do you actually understand the difference......
---
Yeah I wish i had bought the rabbit instead
---
He ought to have "real American" playing as he stomps around
---
A question.
---
A very noobish one.
---
How do you chat with other players?
---
It’s as if I’ve come to a new conclusion through deeper thought 🤔
---
Emotes,microphones that type of stuff
---
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, I’ll just use the website then. Thanks chief
---
Canned Water
---
Boiled Dog Food
---
Then again I also said I’d still rather it be disabled against players so I’m not really back peddling but whatever you gotta do to try to make me look dumb so you can keep your easy aimer haha
---
Ouch sorry to hear man. I know it costs more the sooner it was to your last move but I don't know the threshold on it
---
He is kind of a cunt.

You mean like all the people that talk trash about people getting band. For example in this post the poor guy is just looking for any info when he can play again and people s*** on his question. Like many other posts regarding this subject it's ok if everyone treats people like crap over that. Lol your a social media want to be good person, but you follow who every the majority is, pathetic.
---
I sold my first flamer and dropped all the fuel for it. Not worth the carry weight or the space it takes up in my stash
---
You should be able to just chat with VOIP and when in proximity to another player. Obviously both you and the other player must have chat enabled in your audio settings for it to work.
---
Drop party? Nah, I'm waiting for player vending, being altruistic is fine, but caps are caps!
---
Ah, thanks for letting know.
---
Did not realise this until recently. I tend to use melee on my support toon and was wondering how they'd got through so many cores. Then I noticed how much the meter jumps when you power attack.
---
Similar thing happened to me when I started, they didn't take me leveling but thats ok, but one nice player (whose name I didn't take note of sadly) gave me plans and crafting mats at random. Now I am paying it forward with someone else new to the game.
---
Absolutely not, I wear full shrouded wood armour and I’m level 60. Let wood armour have 3 stars instead of just one.
---
Agreed. I only have one chameleon piece and the rest vanguard. And only I Need it when a fight goods to the dogs.
---
There's the distraction again, it has nothing to do with making you look "dumb" it's about making you acknowledge your faulty suggestion which frankly doesn't work.
---
All because you're a salty, whiney-ass that can't handle getting killed by someone with patience because you run around like a headless chicken.
---
I've been killed by it, and i don't care. You do, you care enough to complain that it should be REMOVED then have to change your tone after realising just how stupid it is, it's actually incredible i've had the patience to sit here and concerse with stupid for so long, but i'm actually out at this point, you literally can't converse with someone so delusionally self-centered he thinks the world should cater to HIS every demand and things he doesn't like need to be removed, it's an actual joke. Then to top it off you go around calling others stupid/child/pre-teen.
---
You're pathetic, enjoy the basement. Sure as hell aint going anywhere else.
---
now THAT'S the way this game is suppossed to be played
---
If you drop ballistic fibers or screws.... sry dude thats mine now!
---
Because its 50 caps if you are at deathclaw island and you really need to get to Watoga
---
Sounds like something Bethesda implemented to stop spamming, but forgot to actually show us via the pip-boy.
---
I’m am calmly scrolling through Reddit kiddo 😂, nobody is distracting you from anything and I already explained how I’ve opened up to the idea of it remaining. Not sure how I’m such a whiney person for one comment saying “yeah I no like that” but alright lmao
---
yeah but they feel very underpowered at the minute
---
PC lady here. I never initiate anything on mic, and even then would need time to actually get used to someone before I used it. Only time I use mic freely these days is if I have a friend along. I don't get a lot of shit on voice, thankfully, but that's because I sound like a sick 12 year old boy, and I'm not looking for the days where that *doesn't* work. :/
---
Crafting from plans is bugged too, for some people.
---
It’s been around for a while unfortunately. Been sitting on a few mods taking up space.
---
As a quick tip if ever able find a bush or stream and go dump your junk in a hidden spot the minute you see a wanted appear. I will message people asking to clear my bounty then retrieve my junk. Most think it's a trap but i reward those with stims who help me.
---
This the build I’m running atm. 
---
Weapons are:
---
Instigating, +10% damage while aiming
---
3 Star vampires laser rifle 
---
3 Star anti armour .44 pistol 
---
And 3/ Star executioner’s revolutionary sword
---

---
I find instigating a better effect than bloodied for my play style. 
---
Already carry a back up plan. IE the laser rifle
---
And healing factor keeps stim paks low and sun kissed keep rad meds low as well. 
---
It’s not perfect by any means. But it gets the job done.
---
Whats wierd about this, is that I -think- it's the first limited-time skin to come back to the atom store after being availble before. I certainly can't think of any others, so there is hope for people who missed out on the blackbird paints I guess.
---
Honest question since I'm considering buying it: what are the good parts of the game ? I've not seen any positive reviews or videos on youtube. I loved fallout 4 but also because of the storytelling which includes NPC interaction and the lack of NPCs in FO76 seems kinda empty. What makes the game so great to you ?
---
I just want infinite stash space like in 4 😔
---
I do agree with OP.
---
I don't like PA very much, and there is no way to get Rad resist \*and\* damage resist without PA.
---
Somehow this is logical in a lore perspective (nuked zone need to require specific gear), but I find very weird to be actually \*less\* powerful in PA than in my regular armor build.
---
Thanks dude, never thought about doing that! Hope I don’t sound too whiny with this post ahah
---
Yes, I have also heard this, made a post about it not long ago. I don't think it's a moo, I think it's the 'squatch. It happens at random event encounters like the one near the Charleston vendor. Going to try and place some explosive bait next time..
---
Predicted this will be the next thing people will complain about and want casualized. Now, seeing these kind of threads complaining about losing junk on death more and more.
---
Anti armor weapons stacked with the right perks eat through any kind of  armor save for a very few that are rare and hard to build full sets of.
---
Same here, while I have hundreds of hardened mass and glowing blood I always goto WS nuke zones for the glowing mass and hi res fluids. Never have enough
---
Nah doesn’t work. I just use the rifleman perks and demo Expert with my Tesla rifle. It’s the only energy weapon I use and its only purpose is tagging anyway.
---
that would probably be overpowered, not to mention that everybody would be in hazmat all the time...
---
Dense torso and fireproof perk both block explosive damage so start with that for defence. For offense get a gamma gun. The rad damage they do is massive and cannot be quick stimmed. Especially good against uyielding builds.
---
thanks i realized when i got to the tinkers bench so i turned it into 10mm ammo instead, now it's just getting enough hardened mass, that stuff is not easy to get in bulk
---
Basically all the Fat Man does. Thing can't even go beyond 50 yards
---
I doubt it's fixed but you can test it yourself with the Awareness perk. You should see a mob's resistances, equip the AA and see what changes.
---
nice try todd !
---
Hmm did you accidentally hit his camp ?
---
I really think pacifist mode should prevent people from damaging a camp too.
---
Kind of hard to forget that kinda GT 😂 Plus we added eachother.
---
In the future, look in your recent players list (assuming XB1) they will likely be there.
---
On board you say... Like a board of wood?
---
. For follow
---
Did you try the key from the burrows?
---
I don’t think so, but it’s a possibility. Obviously the wanted system is there to deter griefers, but in its current state it’s literally punishing people for defending themselves...
---
Yeah, I was still very new to the game so I didn't know about things like that.
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing the ManBearPig or the PuppyMonkeyBaby
---
If they don't also add a way to set the teleport position when we fast travel, I don't see how we really could benefit from this improvement...
---
I never PVP without a full team of well geared players.  Don't even try solo. I don't care what armor you have. 
---
My friend has TSE handmade with tank killer perk and full sentinel assassins armor and he was killed several times in a PVP fight because we were simply outnumbered. In that case it was four against two. 
---
If it's four against one you are going to die, armor and weapons be damned.
---
Well you said you are a lv 20+ and I can understand your view. I have over 800+hrs into 76 and had a few wanted accidents doing what you did, helping a camp. The guy was a lv 8 and he ran on top of his roof thinking I was a griefer lol I convinced him I was ok and he cleared my bounty. Yeah if you get marsupial later on try jumping into trees and leaving a bag if bushes aren't available. Hope this helps
---
??
---
I leave a dot so I can follow this question, as I want to know it too ;)
---
I would personally just like to be able to interchange boiled and purified water when crafting food and drinks.
---
Yeah, she does that some times.  Is shitty, but not super common.
---
I don't remember getting any key from that dungeon or maybe I didn't searched properly?
---
\*Dies laughing\*  
---
Weightless wooden armor is some of the best legendary stealth build drops out there. For a pure stealth player that armor can make you literally un detectable in combo with something like the fixer.
---
oh, ok :)
---
I expected better than this. They should have used a different engine. They aren’t giving us what was marketed.
---
Why were you banned though?
---
Watoga is a bad spot to nuke because of its low amount of loot
---
I found one laying around somewhere there but don’t remember there be any locked doors
---
My friend has a full set of  that stuff but still gets killed when it's just him against four other players.
---
Where’s the safe at
---
You are projecting, do you realise?
---
This shit has been going on for days and it is effecting all power armors.  It's insane that Bethesda hasn't fixed it yet.
---
I...like this. Random spawns the whole time the nuke zone is active. This is an even better idea than instancing the Burrows. Easier on the devs, and still gets the job done. This is why I love collaborative forums. Enough people look at a problem, the more chances that someone hits on a good or better idea. :)
---
What system?
---
I’ve been hearing it while hunting for a pet near Cranberry Glade. It always sounds like it is coming from outside the edge of the map.
---
You find key in burrows or near safe? Please, be more specific...
---
Vampire here 👍
---
Love that one too,great minds think alike
---
Heads up if you want a good place to nuke for violet, went to a blast zone at Big Maw the other day and picked up nearly 200 with green thumb 👍
---
I’m pretty sure this isn’t a bug, rather it’s intentional hype for the Sheepsquatch. It fits with the smoke and mirrors theming they’ve been doing.
---
In burrows.
---
Lol I realise that most people like your self can't think outside the box your in. Perception is a hard  thing to learn for most.
---
That's what i had to do, but it seems like they might have messed this up more with the latest patch
---
I never wanted kids, but now i want a son 14 years old son :(
---
It just gets tiring if every effort to communicate publicly gets responded to with harassment. Which is why a lot of women I know only VC with friends, or don't at all. It's unfortunate, but probably won't be fixed since voice chat is hard to police.
---
I’ll be online this afternoon (CET), in two hours. I’ll make a new character and accept your death match. PSN: airceu
---
Dude my first ever charecter the one overseer stash at flatwoods i got a wetsuit and helmet
---
Says who?
---
Cool. I'm in New Zealand so time zones might be out. Will send friend request.
---
The budget could maybe go up a tad. But honestly I'd rather see them add a Settlement option. So you can build three places
---
CAMP for your private getaway and pit stop
---
Workshops for quests and resources
---
Settlements for big builds that can be settled by NPCs which are possibly being added in Wastelanders. It'd be visible on the map for everyone and would push player vending.
---
I really hope they do it like this. It's nice to have a homely CAMP, and this could be a great way to introduce NPCs if that is their plan.
---
Instead or requesting a removal, how about we request that it can drop as 2/3star instead and it'd be awesome.
---
Add learnable mods/plans for the urban scout armor set and add it to the legendary pool aswell.
---
the best looking armor set in the game is currently flat out useless fluff.
---
This seems like it would ruin the discovery aspect of the game if someone levels you up and takes you all over the map.
---
I don’t get it either. No news on when it will be fixed either? People mock about a lot of stuff but for me, this mod bug and being stuck in emotes are the only ones that really bother me right now. No idea why it should take weeks to fix. But then again, for some reason, I think less than 10 people actually work on this game so they probably drown in piles of work.
---
Wood armor is a thing in this game?
---
Okay so if you go south of vault 76 onto the hills you will hear wailing of a young woman. I dunno whats happening. I check not one player till flatwoods
---
Congratulations. I can't even get my brother to play this game with me.
---
Ok too bad, actually thought they might do some changes
---
Quick question... Since yesterday the 3 safes at the cemetery are empty when I unlock them. No plans, no other loot, nothing. Would server hopping work (I kind of hate doing it because I feel it takes too long :p)?
---
That'd be nice. And a goodbye emote.
---
Somehow I feel tempted to go and build a wood armor character
---
don’t expect everything to be positive about this game, especially considering the state it’s in and was in at launch. people wouldn’t waste their time typing if they didn’t buy the game and want or expect more from a company that has delivered quality titles in the past.
---
Agree
---
Yeah, but to be honest, I would FT everywhere if I could. She basically had me discover places spaced out on the map to cut down walking time for when I go alone.
---
Also, I literally had no idea what I was doing.  It probably took some of the fun away from when I can actually go to Watoga alone, but the leveling just made it so I could not die the moment I encountered eight of those little robot shits. (Liberators?)
---
Sure, I can see that, but even jumping to 76 first will lower that to the thirties.   Also if you have a camp on the eastern side of the map anywhere can lower it yet again to at most, the 20s.
---
NukaRace; Gather a group of friends and pick a central location on the map, then you all drink nukashine at the same time, blackout, and whoever can get back to the start first wins(no fast traveling!)  
---
I've had this idea since they dropped the nukashine, feedback?
---
its bethesda. no news until the next inside the vault or patch
---
Dude it used to be that you could shoot any old cargoot and get the keycard but they patched that :(
---
That's what they're meant for. 
---
If you prime that Ultracite Gat, you can swat any SB out of the sky with ease. Best part is that Ultracite Fusion Cores are the most efficient things on the planet; you can collect a Fusiom Core at 1%, make it Ultracite, and it has 100% charge. Only problem is maintaining the amount of Cores and Flux to make more.
---
Have got a pretty good pump action if yer interested
---
If it was around a month ago on PC, and you died andbd couldn't your bag. Maybe it was me. Three times instead of leaving some gifts I fat fingered take all button. One time it took me 20 minutes of chasing the guy while leaving baggie poops behind.
---
Buy one off a player. They don’t go for much, 200-300
---
Yeah. Within 10 minutes, I found a dank base, got a Fasnacht Witch Mask, some pocketed boiled leather gear at 200% durability. Was only level 1 but I'm level 23 now and it's at 150%. Was given over 1K shotgun ammo and was made a cool sniper rifle. 
---
The Protectrons didn't target you because he was the higher level.
---
Neat one ... here some help one the "paper damage" formula used in FO76  
---

---
I think most of your stuff refers back to Norr's Calc for FO4 - some things changed  
---
Enjoy :) + Adjust pls - feel free to dm
---
Yeah I just tried a bought mod for the Upgrade and nope it won't attach. It is really annoying. The worst part is not being able to attach bright headlamp to the helmet lol the game is way too dark
---
I agree it is getting really irritating to the point of just giving up with the mods.
---
1.butchers bounty and the ticks patch
---
2.increased size of youre stash
---
3. Decreased "upkeep" for turrets
---
I'm surprised there wouldn't be any more news until a showcase at E3 lol
---
I see, I was leaning more towards priming the Ultracite gat but had my doubts since th other one is legendary but thanks. il make sure to mod the ultracite one.
---
I like leather armor
---
Yeah. The community is great. Walked into someone's place and heard some roleplay going on. I had my Fasnacht Witch Mask on with some Brotherhood outfit and next thing I knew, I was the Wicked Witch of the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Is it the explosive one?
---
Wait whats this vendor update
---
Dude you gonna hate,go to r/fallout
---
We need more golden skins for EVERYTHING
---
It was because of a quest about a mayor?
---
She could literally dance around them and they acted like she wasn't there.
---
It was interesting.
---
Really? I didn’t know the probability of catching another disease was lessened with catching one in the first place. Interesting! 
---
I’ve had a few diseases at the same time at one point whilst fighting SBQ due to the all manner of high level mobs that spawn
---
Woah there partner. I agree but its gotta have some style. Last thing I want is to go an buy Fallout:76|The Golden Edition.
---
I got my Tricentinial I dont need another one.
---
Yeah. I made a post in there because I was unaware of this sub's existence and was just wanting to know if it was worth getting back into (last played in December).
---
There were some good answers but one dude told me to wait a full year from release. I was itching to play this game while thinking about it. Fuck waiting a year. Bethesda's engine is old as shit (2003 from what Google says) so of course it'll take a while to fix some stuff and it's still a good game.
---
I am 41 years old, have been a gamer since 35 years.  not once during all these  years could I imagine that gaming would be less a thing for girls.  or that girls that game should get a hard time. I am not naieve, i do know that it sadly is a problem and I am affraid it gets worse and worse but please don't stay off mic. I am perhaps making it sound easier than it is but don't give up because of a minority of scumbags.
---
Golden 50 cal.
---
Golden T-60 power armor
---
Golden handmade
---
I dont care what it is, as long as its fucking gold!
---
Since I have multiple full sets of legendary wood armor (come on legendary vendor - thank goodness they are light), I'd be more than happy if they were removed from the drop list. I honestly get a wood armor drop about 1 in 4. It's ridiculous.
---
A good bug I would like fixed is the perk that fixes weapons doesn’t fix melee up to whatever % you have it set to. It’s unfortunate.
---
Lol that sounds awesome honestly!! I needs friends like that lol
---
Awesome!!
---
What about Scorched? 
---
Summon a Scorchbeast upon death.
---
So lets just make all drops TSE so nobody feels left out...
---
Yeah, and after x seconds it will disappear into his inventory.  You can't just leave a PA frame lying around unless you drop it.
---
Personally, I wouldn't prime any gatling lasers. Fusion cores are very easy to come by. Just claim a power plant workshop and you get like 8 or 9 cores per hour. Since each core provide about 1000 rounds if you use power user perk, it litally cost you nothing to use gatling laser. 
---
But once you prime it, it gonna cost you a lot since each core requires each of every stable flux. That's about 400 caps per core and it can be lowered to about 300 caps per if you utilize super duper perk when crafting. And it ain't just about the caps. Trading for fluxes every now and then is a pain in the arse
---
Wood armor, in itself, is actually fine and would suit a purpose as an extremely early game armor in a "omg, I just stepped out of the Vault and all I have is some twigs and duct tape" way.
---
The problem is the recipes are learned during the Free States missions, where if you are under level 50, you quite simply have skipped over a decent chunk of content in The Forest, Toxic Valley, the Ash Heap, and the Savage Divide, all content that is considered to be of a lower level than the Mire, which is where the Free States are, and thus where you'd learn the recipe for Wood armor.
---
Further compounding this fact is that after level 50, there is no further "tiers" of weapons or armor, and thus there is no more inherit progression from new armor; you just want the best *type* of armor. And Wood armor is, outside of niche stealth builds, quite simply the worst *type* of armor. And again, unless you rush the quests, you will be after level 50 when you learn the recipe.
---
Fundamentally, Wood armor is a fuck up of game design. When you arrive in the Overseer's camp, there should have been a introductory quest handing out your complementary Wood armor recipe. I mean Gilman Lumber Mill is just down the road and would be an ideal place for a quest pointer, while also giving the materials you'd need to immediately craft the Wood armor once you get the recipe reward.  
---
*Welcome to the apocalypse, here's your complimentary bits of armor made out of scrap.*
---
Perhaps, mini-nuke lauchers attached to the shoulders..
---
Nice, I usually get them from site prime but there’s only 100-120 with green thumb, so thanks.
---
Wouldn't mind teaming up started fairly recently aswell IGN Iqbaal.
---
I've had a couple of crash outs, so decided to call it a night. Thank you for the offer. Another time maybe.
---
China is actually going more toward economic domination now.  Good for them actually.
---
Just stop with the company secrets theft...
---
maybe a deathclaw in an Easter bunny outfit?
---
yes it is still bugged. i dont get it why we dont get a hotfix for this.. 8 days.. cmon..
---
I've been playing for a couple weeks now. Launched my first nuke tonight and am level 60ish. I wouldnt mind helping out. IGN is Thugs4hire. Hit me up if anyone would like. Just reply here that you did and your user.
---
If you would like a little help sometimes, feel free to add me. I'm fairly new too but am 60ish. IGN - Thugs4Hire
---
Personally, I wouldn't prime any gatling lasers. Fusion cores are very easy to come by. Just claim a power plant workshop and you get like 8 or 9 cores per hour. Since each core provide about 1000 rounds if you use power user perk, it litally cost you nothing to use gatling laser. and you can just fire away like a maniac and waste your  ammo and still feel okay about it. But once you prime it, it gonna cost you. That's going from 0 to 100 caps per core and that's when I start doing bursts instead of going full auto with my gatling laser. not cool
---
White wolf fedora, sheepsquatch mascot head/outfit and the Fixer weapon plan.
---
No they actually didn't but it is good to have a vivid imagination.
---
Same.  No workshops at all for me.
---
Caps arent a problem at all at higher levels and it's meant to sort of be a 'luxury' for a low level because it promotes exploration and that's how you end up leveling up and getting caps at the early stages of the game.
---
A TSE Gat laser...forgot to ask, did you trade for that? If I remember correctly, Explosive doesn't drop on Laser after a certain patch so that makes it stupidly valuable.
---
Thats a good point i still always carry 2 gat lasers,  my tse and my ultracite, the ultracite barely gets used, only when im fighting scorch beasts, and i use my tse for the rest just spraying everywhere, so if i were to pime one it would def be the ultracite one cause i now i wont use it as much but it will be stronger
---
Alternatively, you become a Scorchbeast. You start off as some bat in a cave and then some dipshit President turns you into a fucking abomination.
---
Idk it seems like it to me by the time a 2nd illness happens the 1st one is practically almost gone at least in my experience. Btw screw claw hand disease I love heavy guns.
---
Your missing the most important perk for PVP: Tormentor perk.
---
really? last i heard was something about them going to change the explosive effect on energy weapons cause it makes the bullets look ballistic, but anyway yeah i traded for it a couple months back, to be fair it was probably duped at some point.
---
Crits and Stagger can get through Sentinel Assassin's armors.
---
Common building bug: Avatar jumping when trying to attach wires, even changing the key binding for "jump" doesn't prevent this from happening.
---
Goes to PVP as a level 8. 
---
Dies. 
---
"Finally! My time has come! I will murder all of you! Good luck bitches!"
---
Would you like to respawn as a Scorchbeast?
---
YES. 
---
Server Disconnected.
---
The tree house at the back has the controls
---
Yeah same dude, 100% heavy gunner here. God help us when we actually have to aim at something, claw hands or not lol
---
When you build in a teammates camp, you can only build atom shop items there that they have purchased.
---
Weapon Artisan? It's worked fine for me and the people I play with, but I guess there's always the possibility it doesn't work for everyone, if it gets brought up again I'll add it to the list!
---
From what I've seen posted on here and my own observations because this has happened to me before.
---
When you go to place the camp module if you move it around after selecting it, the price increases exponentially. Like if you select the module and move it in a circle to get a better look, that will cost you more. This could be wrong so take it with a grain of salt
---
It's still a bug and needs looked into but I have found some ways to stop this and since doing these things I haven't spent more than the 40~ caps it initially says on the pip-boy.
---
1. Go into third person mode to actually see the full circle and be able to move the camera without moving the module.
---
2. More around as much as you need to find a good spot *but* do **NOT** place immediately.
---
3. Exit the placement mode once you've found your spot, don't move the camera or your toon, go back in the placement mode and it should want to place in the spot you have scouted. 
---
Simply place it from here and it couldn't cost you more then the shown cap value    at least that's how it's gone with me since I started doing this
---
Well I never did look at this myself anyway. I have a custom of moving my camp midfight so I'm okay with paying like a 500 caps just to engage
---
Yeah.  Tormentor and high crits are the only way to get around that.  Grenades should do crit damage actually.   That would be a way to level the playing field.   More make 1 grenade do a stagger.
---
It used to work for me, but hasn’t worked for me for the last couple of patches on PC.
---
Egg no 2 never showed up in the store for me. Checked multiple times. Tried everything
---
I use the utility lights next to turrets, and they help with npc spawns. The turrets do have a working range.
---
Ps4
---
Price ?
---
I don't think spoilers are something you need to be concerned about in regards to a game that came out 4 years ago.
---
Modding weightless weapons is also still super fucked.
---
Ok, but is the atom shop item animated or anything. Or is it just a static objects that just sits there, looming our impending doom. Cause I can do that without 200 atoms
---
Definitely overplayed a little but that’s the downside to auctions and been looking for this weapon for a month and finally had someone to get rid of it for caps. It does 600 with everything on.  I like the range capability and can use my handmade if I’m looking for dps
---
level 200. Have had 2 run ins with PvP. One @ level 10ish, (griefer, buddy white knighted me though. was hilarious) and a low level (mid 40s iirc) that was clearly testing his build for Survival (it was really solid, i run 5/5 sentinel and he plowed through it and my dense/fireproof with an Explosive Handmade in like 0.5 sec)  
---
I routinely drop tons of stuff (literally thousands of pounds per week) at the over seers camp. Wish they'd increase the stupid weight limit to more than 20. That only 80 plans...  
---
I see prob 20:1 people helping vs people harassing.
---
I hope you did save it! 
---
It's so annoying to try communicate with someone who is clearly speaking to you, but you just keep flailing your arms (emotes) trying to let them know you can't hear them.
---
What are you willing to sell for?
---
Are you sure that Adrenaline and Bloody mess aren't just plain multipliers? Where can I check these new formulas?
---
Hey man, I spent 52 stimpacks during the Imposter Sheepsquatch event being a conduit for all 3 pylons and I’m level 39. Wanna give me some free stimpacks? Maybe bullets too? Outta those. LOL
---
I dont get this, everybody seems to have issues with fusion cores running out faster yet since the last patch mine aren't running down at all.
---
I'm on PS4 if it helps.
---
I've been trying to confirm melee ingame and there are some oddities I haven't figured out, such as some melee weapons use +5% x strength, others use +10% strength. Could you post your ingame numbers and exact mods.
---
The bloodied explosives and aae all go over 30k rn if you find one cheaper you should definitely just snag it to sell for more or trade up
---
The key from the burrows dosent work I have tried it. It mentions Sugar grove on the paper near the safe maby its something there?
---
While I see your annoyance and been there myself as I've clipped a camp or workshop object while helping somebody lower levelled defend something, I hate carrying a bounty around so do what I can to get rid of it. I take it as lesson learned to be more careful with my shots, not use anything that may have an area effect or spread like shotguns and that has made my combat better as I use that principle in any fight in the game. It just cost me junk and caps.
---
You think someone would start a legal process that could last years and cost hundreds of thousands just because some anonymous person said something sexually for another anonymous person inside internet game? I don't think so.
---
As far as I know, every boost is multiplicative, so the order doesn't matter. The exception is the base damage + strength x factor for melee, but after that, legendaries, criticals, mods, perks, mutations all are multiplicative. So 40% power attack damage multiplies 600.
---
I've used a Chameleon set for a bit over 200hrs.
---
It improves stealth by quite a bit. With Chameleon pieces, sneak perks and escape artist I can go up to any creature's face and stay hidden.
---
Without the Chameleon pieces though... I get DETECTED when I'm 2-5 meters away from an enemy and sometimes from even further away.
---
The stupid thing about the bounty system is that it actually encourages griefers. 
---
Rather than a bounty, players should get a disease and pvp griefing would virtually stop.
---
Haha nice job on saying stfu too em virtual high-five for ya! Hope this does not ruin you're expernice Of online games. Cant say I know how it feels but I do because of bullying and other issues. Fo76 and online games are my escape.  I have had many suicidal thoughts but the kind hearted people on fallout 76 just bring joy. And it is fun just playing with the random people.
---
Love-Squidshock
---
That's actually a cool idea.
---
Say when in Power Armor since you can't equip "fist" items, you should be able to equip mini-nukes as grenades.
---
Would make for some cool "Throwing" builds.
---
This is being changed in a future update. Pacifist will extend to camps and camps wont be damageable until engaged in PvP (picking player locks, shooting player/camp with Pacifist off, taking a workshop, etc)  
---
Not sure they've said when though.
---
I bought a TSE MG42 from a vendor a while back. I thought whoever sold it was an idiot. Turns out, he probably just ran out of .308.
---
When game was released most of the people played game through in 4-5 days. Then they waited for 6 months to get 5 min more end game content. GG Bethesda. Well done.
---
Thanks for another perspective on the issue, will definitely be more careful forwards. This is a nasty bug to encounter for low level players...
---
Ahh that’s fantastic! I should’ve read future patch notes before posting this ahah, glad that they’re changing it though
---
I was hoping your post would just be a picture of a Scorched with a shotgun.
---
Feckin’ Raiders.
---
Xbox
---
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the fusion generator fails, when we forsake our appliances. But it is not this day!
---
Yeah low levels are when it hit me the hardest, around level 15 my camp was originally around vault 76 but I moved to the has heap and it cost me almost 200 caps because I was just walking around in placement mode trying to find the perfect spot.
---
Which just cleaned out every cap I had
---
That's some clue worth checking, I don't know how I didn't see the paper (it was middle of the night).
---
Budget had been wicked glitched for me. Had a camp with max budget, got attacked and stuff got destroyed. Wouldn't let me replace the destroyed items claiming max budget.
---
Pistols in General? Eh, the 10mm pistol is one of the most powerful builds in the game, no joke. The fact a Guerilla Ops, standard automatic 10mm silenced build drops level 68 super muties, scorchbeasts and Swann with barely any ammo usage is in fact nuts, and that's just with a non-legendary 10mm. Imagine with Armor Piercing, Vats +Crit damage and -25% VATS cost? This thing is the bane of sentinel players that don't have stealth boys activated yet. 
---
The Revolvers on the other hand, I have to agree. They don't have armor piercing, their crit damage is far too low for the abysmal fire rate they have, there's no option to dual wield them, or make them fire as fast as you can pull the trigger (click your mouse), thus they can't be an amazing versatile weapon. They're just...pitiful. A 50 Cal Machine Gun does about roughly the same damage, but with far easier ammo to create, and with a far higher DPS, armor piercing via perk, accuracy, stagger, etc.
---
I hear rumours of a rear entrance to sugar grove? Maby your search might uncover something I'm out atm so cant log in to check :)
---
Welp, I hope you enjoy your journey into the commonwealth
---
Golden and Silver Handmades was added a few patches ago. Yet to be released.
---
Was on a forum, not patch notes iirc. So youd have missed it anyway.  
---
Their Community PR reps are kinda messing up.  go check last tuesdays posts on the burrows, to see what i mean.    
---
Reddit got the official "they're open" notice a few hours before their own support page posted it.)
---
I know, and in eagerly awaiting the release with atoms I've stock piled!
---
Don't worry about the down votes, they just mad and showing the true colours lol
---
Awesome cheers mate! I'll hope on today and have a look!
---
If i remember correctly, there is rear entrance to sugar grove, but I don't remember if there is actually any unidentified key there. Must check it, I like that kind of unmarked mini-quests :)
---
I’ve never had anyone help me out like this in the beginning but I always do it to this day.
---
Same here! Those can't be released soon enough...
---
Not everyday, after a 12 hour shift I'd rather just go straight to bed.
---
It is the feature of the game since Beta.
---
It's random but you know it's triggered when the whole ash heap region starts shaking.
---
yeah there's a quest there that turns the robots passive once you complete it but until you do they will be hostile.
---
Play through with a second character?
---
Isn't fuel affected by the ammosmith perk? I do agree with you, but until it's fixed or improved, might as well put 2 points in that and spend 15 scrap to make 9 fuel?
---
Yes, on occasion soldiers and marines would use them as op grenades,  the proper way to prime one was to hit the priming pin (pin on bottom) against a hard surface.
---
Y im sure - try out ingame ^^
---
Thanks, I will update the data.
---
Do you have any insights about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bemnww/weapon_damage_calculator_and_comparator_webpage/el959qa/
---
It implies that bloody mess, adrenaline and adrenal reaction are applied to the base damage, like a + b + c - 2 (a, b, c &gt;= 1), or in other terms, their relative boost values are additive.
---
Gary 😫
---
Had lots of stored items disappear.
---
Prevent whom? If OP had pacifist mode on they wouldnt deal any damage to someone else's CAMP.
---
how come he became wanted then ?
---
That's hot.
---
"It just works!"
---
-Todd
---
this made my day thank you &lt;3
---
A sticky!? Good luck - I maintain my theory that this reddit is full of Bethesda employees that downvote and bury topics on bugs and problems.
---
Close and restart should of worked :(
---
I feel like the game has enough trouble getting the craftable radio to work properly, let alone a tv. There was a mod for that though for fo4.
---
Really?! Now I need it!
---
I assume its a bunny outfit for us. Well see :)
---
Added. There is a possibility the strength scaling is incorrect for this, let me know if you have a different value ingame for a particular strength of yours.
---
They did advertise that I think
---
This is super creative but it would just give players one more reason to play with power armors
---
Collect all six and on the seventh day we get a limited timed item :)
---
Added from gottieboyz
---
Yeah it’s called videos of the wasteland.
---
Once again, just because you also don't understand what "oh sweet summer child" means doesn't mean its a douche comment.
---
Oh,really? I must've missed info on that. Thank you!
---
I mean, on console bash/grenade isn't the same as hold breath.
---
Still I hate that when I'm trying to throw a grenade I'll just punch a wall or sometimes I'll Molotov myself in the face instead of bashing.
---
Dunno where you're from but the eggs rotate between days and are up for 24hours.
---
Winning! 😂
---
Sent you an friends request IGN Iqbaal
---
Ahh fk :(
---
I reverse-engineered those , only by checking how effect x affected pipboy dmg over months
---
You have to collect the set of eggs.
---
OP didnt have pacifist mode on, either they don't know it it's a thing in the options or forgot to turn it on after attempting to defend a workshop.  Even before the removal of SLAP damage to players someone with pacifist mode on dealt 0 damage to player built structures.
---
So, when you first put a gladiator perk in and it made no change you thought you'd better try another 5 times to be sure? These things are really simple to check.
---
With the flamer the damage that can be done is maybe why fuel is so expensive to manufacture. To be honest I would only be using that type of weapon against mobs or fire vulnerable enemies like the mutated bee.
---
Do you have the ammosmith or scrounger perks? I have found those to be great in gathering extra ammo from stores or making extra when I make my own. If not, I'd seriously recommend them.
---
Yes. I can't add a Luck perk.
---
Nah, I like it the way it is. But the fat man in general needs a massive damage boost. Should be at least 3000 base damage.
---
Dont they know that one of their group can just disconnect and reconnect to the group to trigger a new spawn wave?
---
Yeah, this looks like one of the more impactful bugs/quirks this game has. 
---
Whenever people complain about the game, I always think of the enjoyable loot then upgrade equipment cycle. Moreover, I also think of the small yet nasty bugs like this one. Sad yet deserved that the game is almost only known for this.
---
I read something about they changed the use to Fallout 4 settings.
---
So now the use is insane.  VATS sucks them dry (even spamming the vats button but not going into vats uses them quick.  And power attacks (yes including weapon bash) drains them quick.
---
Except no Cobalt 
---
COBALT WHERE ARE YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU!
---
I just give them the thumbs down emote.
---
The only inside area that is affected by nukes is the new Burrows area.  Anything else that requires a load screen to get to just ignores the fuck out of nukes.
---
Me too, but I always feel rude about it
---
Sadly, you're not alone. I got many comments from people who did the same.
---
Yes, I desperately need this.
---
3 eggs have been released so far.
---
Yeah stored things are disappearing for me. Like concrete foundations and water pumps.
---
eh, fair enough. if you ever dont want it, hit me up and I'll buy it for 10k
---
I love that elevator :)
---
Not sure if it’s you,
---
I saw someone nuked fissure prime yesterday on PC.
---
at first there were lots, 6-8? Folks queued up and waiting to play or hanging just outside nuked area. Then whoosh, only 1 was in the guy fighting SBQ.
---
thought it was really odd.
---
Whats makes you so sure he is german? Because of his name?  What if i named my char " Большой волк " (Google translater). Am i russen then? Or is there a way to find out from where a player is in the game? Not that i care much about a players nationality. Idiots are international like nice people too.
---
If i calculate right, you are Lvl 142. That cant be called low level. Dont get me wrong, i understand your anger to loose your garbage but is this such a big thing? This is the way some players play the game and its within the rules. Dont blame him for not waiting until you came back and pick up your stuff. Maybe he was waiting but you take to long...
---
Speaking for myself if i see a player dieing, i look on the map to check if he cames back or not. If not i take the stuff, else i leave it.
---
Last thing... You cannot fasttravel into a nuke zone
---
Well it doesn’t cripple you because with the perk that reduces negative effects, the reduction in Chen effectiveness is only about -13%. It does save a lot of meds after fights too.
---
Is rubberbanding a common word I should know?
---
Yesss.
---
I crash sometimes too. The game itself is uniptimised.
---
Swing speed would replace power attack.
---
Yeah there are some awesome folk on the game. I was low levelled and followed a lvl 80 player after they'd invited me to their team. They gave me two legendary weapons for free, I didn't have any at that point. Another player had their camp next to mine and popped over to say hi. We launched a nuke, went through the nuke zone at the Whitespring and I got given a TSE Dragon rifle. I rarely use it but I still have it.
---
After that, I have built camps for new players, made weapons and armour and decor for random new players just because I was online with no real purpose in mind.
---
It's just fun instead of going on a murder spree when you're bored!
---
Definitely not.
---
Can you be more specific on the location. South of Harpers Ferry? Railroad bridge? Highway bridge? 
---
Can't find any broken bridges south of the town. Atleast in Mire location, is in Cranberry Bog?
---
A pic of you map would help a lot.
---
Sended request.
---
Downvote for spreading lies.
---
great place for a camp ( had mine there ) but a no so great place to fast travel/spawn into. You have to work a bit to find a place that will not spawn you into the rocks. For me, I had to get my CAMP box and put it high on the roof to keep us from not spawning in the rocks.
---
Also, the wind sound is pretty ruthless up there!
---
The building bugs are what irritate me the most but, while the initial fervor of hate on launch was in some ways boosted by hating on the fact that it was an online fall out and people just jumping on the hate bandwagon, there aren't a small amount of bugs. And a lot of the hate because of bugs was deserved.
---
I've been playing on and off since launch and have had to deal with quite a lot of bugs so I understand why some people wouldn't like it.
---
Though I'm 400+ hours in now and while I hate the bad about the game, I love the good.
---
Little things like communicating with people on this Reddit about small details in the world here and there. Meeting amazing people in-game who help, not hurt, low levels and even give them free plans or aid. Those low levels then going on to pay it forward.
---
I would love QOL updates and extra camp cosmetics as much as the next.
---
But my first and most important wish for this game is bugfixes and getting the attention it deserves from the devs and people on High at bgs.
---
Power Armor makes you stronger, not faster.  Your arm could lift a a ton in PA, but wouldn't rotate fast enough to send the football very far.  Think torque in trucks: high torque means you can haul more, but doesn't mean your truck will go faster.
---

\+ DPS added
---
Going south from small motel north of harpers ferry you'll find highway bridge. Jump down on the left side and continue on the lake shore - you'll see safe on water level.
---
When you inspect the eggs in the atomic shop you can read that there in the description. And you're most welcome :)
---
YEAH, hours of gameplay and self-exploration....gone.
---
Maybe Bethesda isn’t the issue. Maybe it’s your internet or maybe you’re just an angry little man.
---
Hmm, just read it today but somehow still missed it :D
---
Haha slow down the speed reading XD
---
It's weird because it's only the ones in the mire and a few others like the syringer one in the savage divide  and the hunt one in the toxic valley.   I do get the others pretty frequently.
---
Good movie
---
Hm my challanges say I hacked 54 terminals yet I don't have the trophy for 50.. the last one I need.
---
So 2 points in starched genes and 3 points in class freak to have good after combat healing and slightly diminished chems.
---
Or I could just have 2 in Cola nut for some of the best healing in the game, in and out of combat.
---
Sounds like the mutation is only worth it if you stack a lot of mutations to justify the investment.
---
I have been preaching about Explosive Gatling Plasmas for quite some time. They are insane.  
---
 [https://media.giphy.com/media/3rZKwjK8EudvPFl3fm/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3rZKwjK8EudvPFl3fm/giphy.gif)
---
They also broke Plasma Gatling and Laser Gatling, it often unloads a whole clip half way through then consumes two or more cores, not sure how they Pulled it off but it ruined my build.
---
Spikes nuke into ground during td celebration and kills everyone* xD
---
*earns 5000 cap bounty*
---
Well...I would suspect, though I have little proof except for personal experience, you might either be off on your 24 hour timing, OR updates and server resets are throwing it off. I have noticed this myself. After an update sometimes I need more time before the safes seem to work again. If you are seeing nothing regardless of server hops, just waiting longer is the only solution. Sorry!
---
They didn't "steal" it, you abandoned it.
---
Are they actually worth it I haven’t ever really used mine.
---
Yes, I see your various points, and understand why you may have doubts.
---
I hit the Transfer button on the the dead mutants inventory.  When I highlighted the egg, it showed a spinning image of the egg(similar to when you first get a legendary).  
---
The image of the egg was speckled, just like the one in the atom shop.  
---
Eggs as food items don’t do that
---
Are you wearing your Fagsnatch mask?
---
For whatever reason when I get the choice for gender in games I have a tendency to lean towards female. I think the only male I've used in the last five years was in Dragon Age Inquisition. I did run into at least one woman who was a woman when playing 76 so they are definitely out there.
---
Your smarter than me. I can't get it to work! Keeps saying "invalidlogin" 3:0:1407374883553298 Are you still able to do this after the last 2 patches???
---
They act like a recon scope with out the color shift or zoom.
---
Moms credit card and blowing off the mods in r/matket76 
---
##haventlostafightyet
---
Havent had one drop for me in weeks from treasure maps or the queen.
---
Yeah it happens.  The first time I saw it I was like yeah she sometimes flies out regenerates her health to full and comes back but she just flew away into nothingness.
---
ive had the same issue before with my two shot missile launcher, i also had missiles randomly deleted from my clip. if i fire once, i lose two missiles ontop of the one i shot (3 at once). i removed the quad barrel and the issue resolved itself.
---
I can do that with the perks only, though I have full unyielding and mutations that push my AGI past 30
---
BGS took a Gamble and assumed the fallout player is the type that likes the shoot and loot aspects more than the RP Aspects. I am actually that type of player but apparently I am a minority and they got it VERY wrong.
---
Was this on xbox?
---
I seem to have dumb luck with my camp placement since my fast travels always spawn me inside my main building.
---
Shouldn’t it be 125%?  Incisor is 75% and BoB is 50%.
---
Explosive fail (you drop the nuke at your feet)
---
Craftable mini nuke grenades would be great
---
Screw you! Me and my Legendary Wood Right Leg say otherwise. (That is until I finally find that damn Legendary Leather Right Leg.)
---
I like to put on my Santa Outfit and use the "Follow" emote if I am going around gifting stuff to people.
---
I just want to display my teddy bear collection.
---
Yeah, I think it has something to do with stuff not respawning for me yet. I went into Appalachian Antiques and all the stuff I grabbed yesterday was still gone. Guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
---
On the bright side, I killed a legendary mongrel at the Antiques shop and got a Furious Plasma Gatling, that made me quite happy.
---
If it was anything significant data miners would have spoiled it by now. Just look at what happened with the Nuka Quantum paint etc. We can't have mysteries because people just dig in the game files and spoil them without trying.
---
I’m level 52.  The bloodied gear is level 25 and below
---
I understand you, but don't take away from me any kind of entertainment I have ;) You must find yourself something to do, farming WS (now Burrows) and SBQ is kinda boring :)
---
Except when a pair of griefers are working together: one will get into PVP with the other, then go find people to team with. You'll be open to PVP yourself at that point, and their pal can sneak up and one shot you.
---
Personally I can't wait until they close the workshop loophole.
---
Good luck finding any of them, I think I saw someone say they are a rare spawn in the wild but I've never seen them.  I put in a suggestion ticket to have them added to the BOS forbidden knowledge loot table because it makes sense that it would be there but I feel you.  There is one for arms, legs, and chest but I feel even with my 500 closing in on 600 hours in this game that I am always a day late with getting things.  Seems that when I find out about something that would be great to have that its been removed from the game or become a rare item when it used to be something anyone could go buy from a vendor if they were willing to server jump.  Here's to hoping you get that lucky rare spawn drop.
---
If you move the deployable camp part around within your boundaries it will change your fast travel point :)
---
This honestly scared me until I found the terminal.
---
Yeah but have you had any friends fast travel to you or spawn in there? That was also a pretty big issue. I had a huge fortress there back when foundations could be stacked...
---
Screenshot?
---
It will onky work with starched genes if you have a mutation.
---
Is there a new one? I thought I got 2 now only see one. And can’t find one for today...
---
Gaaaaryyyy......GAAAARYYYYY
---
Welcome to the club. Got mine three months ago
---
YEAH   got you,and I did note this. personally, if you want to level up etc. then go do it your self or you will miss SO much and " I earned that". I will give them some purified water or somthing (as someone did for me  ta much by the way) and if they can hear me,point them in a good direction,if you need help,ask and i'll gladly come and help. cheers bye for now.
---
but in the spirit of this game these guy's helped and offered guidance,not grief,and thats to be commended.This game was always meant to be a team effort and not 'call of duty'.
---
If I correctly read between the lines of past posts , then there is a huge no. of poeple,who will not play this game because of the  griefers.This persons post says that it can be done. And i'll bet those helping players had just as much fun doing it
---
wood armor does have a late game location, stealth builds. Weightless wood armor with its stealth armor mods and the fixer makes you literally impossible to detect especially if you have stealthboys or the chameleon mutation.  
---
The usefullness of an armor depends on the build. Reminder most armor is useless to most builds, but all armor is useful for atleast one build type.   
---
Wood armor is good for stealth glass cannons, the type who can do 3k damage per shot with a Gauss rifle, you know those ones not using explosive weapons and taking off chunks of health on the imposter sheep and SBQ.   
---
All armor has a place just because it will not work for the average build doesn't mean it dropping is useless.
---
I had that [Inaccessible] first time I arrived at The Burrow, both entrances.  I server hopped and was ok, sorry that’s no help to you if you’ve just nuked it (unless you can go out and then back into the nuke server by travelling to a friend on that server).
---
Good luck... 👍🏻
---
If you're mutated, the weapon does 10% more damage
---
It is, but it goes from 5 fuel per craft to 9, still incredibly inadequate.
---
Just took a clip (Xbox One dvr), uploading to YouTube now
---
So without the starched genes it does not work ? You can also be mutated without having the perk on .
---
My friend calls them the nurse.
---
Since we originally discovered a ghould could drop that while doing monster mash.
---
None. They broke finding the BOS plans whem they made the vendor inventories static instead of a random selection of notes. Iirc that was patch 5.
---
They have said the next patch (9 right?) will contain a fix. So hopefully just a few more days.
---
Or a “I’m busy”, sometimes you might want to trade, just not immediately...
---
&gt;\- Players should be be able to completely respec their SPECIALs at the cost of caps, not just have to move 1 attribute per level up, the cost could be something like 100 caps per level up to 50 since that's when the player stops accumulating attribute points.
---
How does a level 251 respec then?!
---
If ur steal someones junk in adventure mode...u have no balls. 
---
Theres no recourse or action against you that player can take, so u can walk away like a weasel.
---
That what survival is for...go there if u fancy yourself some kind of junk pirate.
---
If i get mt stuff taken in survival...thats the game. In adventure mode..you're being a D
---
Yeah, that'd be sweet.  Then it wouldn't affect my chameleon mutation.
---
PvP or PvE? Very different worlds.  
---
PvE you pretty mush just need a high damage 1\* instigating.   
---
PvP builds:   
---
bloody is highest dmg output (Unyeilding+sent is pretty nuts damage) - Kill with Radiation (Gamma gun)  
---
Hindenbergs are pretty popular as well (Marsupial + Explosive weapons) - Kill at range (hope theyre not running range as well. Most Hindenbergs seem to be Handmade/Shotgun build, ime)  
---
CritSniper turns Assassin+sent builds into paper.  - get close, they're most effective outside of your weapons range (unless youre also long range)  
---
Mentats will lets you see everyone, though vats wont work on StealthBois.   
---
Best armor is Sent+Assassin. Most people i run into are using TSE weapons so Dense Mod + Fireproof to counter.   
---
Sentinel is everywhwere in PvP, so stagger effects are strong (Sent doesnt work while staggered)  
---
The main key to PvP is quickly recognizing what build they're running, and how to counter it. The general meta for weapons seems to be shifting from TSE to Energy (its really hard to counter energy damage. Scaly skin, grounded, and Evasive only get you to 195 ER @15 agi) With leather gear you can get this to a little above 350. Vs base damage of 66b/78e (@ 295 DR) this works out to about 19b/22e dmg per shot, if armor gets its full bonus against (armor piercing stats arent really well known, afaik)
---
it will work without starched genes.
---
I really just wish the shrouded wood armor was closer to looking like a guillie suit. 
---
Even without being legendary, proper camo would be hard to pass up for a sniper build.
---
Just smile and wave boys. Smile and wave.  
---
Also, thanks for muting kids and dogs.  I have both, too, and the struggle is real.  I got so pissed yesterday when I was waiting to trade at a train station and the guy who was trading, blocking me mind you, stopped gaming to play with his kids on hot mike.
---
Great, now they know
---
I don't think so. I have over 16K 5mm rounds
---
Gary? Gary!? gAAARRYYYY!!!
---
Yes I have a really cool Legendary flamer and it’s really strong but holy crap the ammo consumption makes the light mechine gun seem like nothing
---
One bug that still bugs me is when you get "stuck" in your PA inside instances/indoor areas where you can't move at all for some reason, forcing you to exit and re-enter PA. Happens far too often to ignore as an inconvenience.
---
I had a similar issues, Removed the quad barrel and problem resolved. Kind of a pain as my 2 shot quad barrel Missile launchers was epic. Now it's not :(
---
I’ve not had many kills this week but have been in the top 3 pretty consistently.  Not because I’m very good but it’s due to the fact there aren’t many playing survival mode.  
---
If I saw 6 people at WS that might be an all time high.  Last night I was trolling that area and saw 1 player in almost an hour.
---
You're right and wrong.  You're right, because, yes - anyone can do it, and they do.  I just met up with a guy for a trade - he had a mule account that he couldn't travel with - because it was a lvl 2 - and weighed over 1000 lbs.   Get 5+ people on a server that use mule accounts - and it crashes the server.  Ever notice when your "footprint" gets too big in the server - your session locks up or you get kicked?  By "footprint" I'm referring to memory utilization.  Capture 2 work benches, travel to 5+ locations and boom  --  you're disconnected.  Mule accounts are wrong, if for no other reason, because it ruins the game for everyone.  Some people are smart enough to make this distinction, and don't have mule accounts.  So yes, it is therefore an unfair advantage.
---
Saw a player 2 nights ago with a 1250 cap bounty.  Needless to say that drew some attention
---
Well, i started to think the burrow was exclusively for middle level because we all know vault raid is coming.
---
And we all know that the mire was not max level mob spawn area compare to cranberry bog.
---
Thx . I was just wondering  if it worked on both sides . With or without perk . Thx for the answers
---
Check your local clerk's office for legal cases involving sexual harasment over the Net. You'll be surprised we're not as anonymous as you may think we are.
---
To be fair, what few legendarys there were they did drop max level stuff
---
Dog Water
---
Canned Boiled Food
---
AAE isn’t very useful against a lot of npc’s. Scorched and ghouls have fuck all DR, robots have mostly energy resistance. They’re still good but you have the perk Stabilised for armor penetration.
---
TSE is pretty good if the target isn’t too far away. The extra round does 25% of the damage the first round does, but with extra explosive damage.
---
Furious APPARENTLY adds up to 30% damage after 5-6 shots. This is all the information I have on it from some dude who did his owns tests so you might want to do your own. This wouldn’t do as much dps as TSE up close but at a distance you would get more hits in on players, scorched, ghouls etc. Small targets. SBQ is massive so you shouldn’t miss her even at a distance.
---
I personally want a TSE .50 for regular play and a primed TSE gatling for SBQ. Don’t think anything beats TSE in terms of dps except bloodied explosive, but fuck having low health. I don’t want to be a glass cannon.
---
Ran one last night. Burned 3000 rounds of 50 cal., killed 6 or so 3* bad guys, and used a ton of 5mm. I switched to my ax and we got her down to a sliver of health. My ax broke and when I switched to my Super Sledge my game froze. 
---
I was going to loot the 3*s after the SBQ died. I had a plan as I usually join a friends world so I'll just restart and join his world again. My friend had logged off......
---
It was a random nuke so I wasn't on a team.
---
My Brother had to remove a wall because I spawned between the wall and a rock cliff I was literally stuck between a rock and a hard place.
---
We need fast travel mats for camps
---
Oh ok, thank you for the info! I was driving myself mad trying to find it.
---
It scale base on your level so if low level coming in alone without party, they would spawn at middle level range.
---
Someone nuked Whitesprings this morning and there were a bunch of legendarys to be had.  Unfortunately,  most were wood armor types but did land a 3 star War Drum.  Not sure how long I’ve been playing (now lvl 165) but that’s only the third 3 star weapon drop I’ve gotten.
---
Make sure to use the stabilised perk. Lowers recoil and adds armor penetration. TSE will armor penetration, yes please.
---
Server hop whitesprings. Check all the vendors inside the resort, at the train station and inside the bunker. I’ve found explosive weapons, two shot weapons, weight reducing armor, sentinel/cavalier armor etc. people just don’t know what they’re selling to the vendors.
---
Getting help from other high levels is something I can totally relate to. Getting a full set of pocketed leather armour is very helpful in the earlier stages. As people gave gifts, it only felt right to atleast something back. Ive also noticed that the stash pushed this type of behaviour. The stash space everyone has is quite limited and rather throwing way the weight heavy items, you craft armour and weapons that could accommodate a lv. 5 or 10.
---
Im not familiar with the exact number of people working at Bethesda Austin, but judging by that is a Bethesda division, I'm guessing that there are a hefty amount of people working. I think most of the employees must be working on the technical side and not the "story" aspect.
---
Sorry, I give up. Spend now an hour trying to find your location.
---
As I said a map of the position could be helpful.
---
FYI south of the lake, north of the lake?
---
Water level? Water's edge?
---
ie. There's an unmarked safe on truck bed East of Raleigh Clay bunker and north of the sunken church (that doesn't show on map). For opening it you need Granny Davis safe key.
---
Did a few runs the other night with a lot of hoping. I don't know if I just got lucky as 3 servers I got on had none in them. In about 7 or 8 runs I had about an average of 5 legendary in them. Overall about 4 3 stars. 2 of the runs where after nukes had hit and people left. The drops other then 3 star legendary drops were very underwhelming though.
---
Before placing your camp again, log off then log on.  Always 40 caps after you do this.  You will be charged 200 caps if you place your camp and then decide to move it a little bit right away.  I assumed this was a bug and not an intended feature.
---
Yes I am aware. Doesn't always translate though. Regularly see level 35 drops from level 50+ Enemies
---
I don’t get why people be rude I thought if you found a girl on a mic you treated them like queens not harassed them when did this reverse
---
I only have 191 damage in game but on this with 2shot rifle it says I should have 204
---
Yep. Same
---
Either your very lucky or me and my team are very unlucky  As I said we did 17 runs!
---
Me neither, but when i was beginning was the beta when there wasnt any high levels to help people out, so we got our crew together and went to explore watoga, that was a mistake, lol, good fun though, especially since in the beta the robots just kept spawning
---
Just tried that as I'm playing with my partner as well, left the game, even restarted my console, rejoined. Still inaccessible unfortunately..
---
Well, that some desync data just like a low and high level both come whitespring.
---
They spawned both random from low to high ghoul in there.
---
I usually leave the Burrows with 3 legendary items per visit. I don't think it's anything special, considering the amount of ghouls I have to kill to get that many. But the EXP is pretty good, although I wish there were more mob density (scaled). Granted, not every legendary item was dropped by a legendary enemy (so, same as the golf club).
---
**Positives (+) and Negatives (-)**:
---
(+) Comparing it to Whitesprings Golf Club, you'd get similar legendaries that may be higher level due to the enemies that drop them being higher level themselves. 
---
(+/-) It takes longer to clear, but you get way more exp doing so. 
---
(+/-) Clusters of ghouls make explosives far more effective and efficient in WGC, while the Burrows offer small groups of ghouls per room. The longer distance allows for the sneaky ranged builds to clear it with ease.
---
(+) Spawn refresh rate is much higher than WGC.
---
(+) Nuking the location will nuke TWO areas at the same time (Harpers Ferry and The Burrows).
---
(-) Not instanced and no groups required.
---
Ha, wow. 5 months! I don't think I've played the game in 3-4 months. How is it?
---
Definitely,for me it felt easier in the 400 stash days to just give out my excess instead of just dropping it somewhere 
---
And I'm not familiar enough with the goings on of Bethesda (I actually live about two hours away from their Rockville, MD. hq) so I can only hope that that's what's going on.
---
Restart the game to refresh the atomic store
---
Wire (dont use wifi) Enable QoS on your router, and set port forwards. (UDP: 3000-3010)  
---
I havent seen a more than a random disconnect every few days in weeks.. Only have extended latency issues when i play on East Coast servers.
---
Those are some really sweet details! I’m going for PvP in Survival Mode. Couple of questions though.
---
1. Unyielding increases special stats. But do special stats increase the damage on weapons that are ranged, not melee?
---
2. Is hindenberg the play style of using marsupial+explosive weapons together, since I didn’t understand this part?
---
3. Aren’t explosive weapons useless in PvP since most people use fireproof and dense chest mods like you said?
---
4. Seeing as I don’t like melee or energy weapons and am more of a hard cold lead kind of person, what kind of weapon do you recommend for this “CritSniper”? Seeing as VATS doesn’t work while looking through a scope, how far can VATS reach when you try to activate it? How is a “CritsSniper” played since getting close is not really sniping?
---
5. What about Assassin Cavalier Or Bolstering? Is bolstering better in total defense compared to the 40% with Assassin against players?
---
Yep, no random team invites for me. 
---
Plasma and pulse grenades are OP in PVP. If you can hit them..
---
Had a high bounty guy holed up in another players camp with an explosive plasma gatling. A few high level players died trying to get him but I just bounced 2 plasma grenades through the door of the room he was in. Got a bounty from the grenades due to camp damage but it was worth the 35 caps.
---
Haha sorry I found this through Google.
---
It's great, there was a big update but I'm not sure how long ago, added a few fun things. Not much has changed though.
---
How many eggs by now (4/19 before 8pm)?  Is it:
---
2- 4/17@8, 4/18@8, 4/19@8, 4/20@8, 4/21@8, 4/22@8
---
Or
---
3- 4/16@8, 4/17@8, 4/18@8, 4/19@8, 4/20@8, 4/21@8
---
I ask for three reasons...
---
A- when I got my first egg on 4/17 midnight I noticed someone posted it was a "new egg"
---
B-the last day is 4/22, but that could mean it is the last day the egg drops or when the egg time ends
---
C- goddamn I love a list, don't I?
---
I have two... striped with stuff on it, and one with just the little decorations.
---
I'm SOE aren't I?  Sadly outta egg...
---
I agree with all except cryo that is one of my fav weapons the only problem I had with that gun was acid and crystal and both can be farmed at at place in toxic valley with 3 acid spots and 1 crystal spot so I got like almost 1k cryo ammo and plenty resources to make more but the flamer is a joke the ammo consumption is ridiculous it needs something like Gatling plasma gun with like packs of ammo you attach
---
Remember that for now, aa doesn’t work on energy weapons. So an aa plasma does the same damage as a regular plasma.
---
I think ALL crafting material should be in JUNK, even Gunpowder. That way they can benefit from Pack Rat perk
---
I know it's a bird. I'm on the phone.
---
Can we decrease the consumption rate of plasma flamers while we’re at it?
---
A bonnet, probably.
---
Ohhhhh bunny ears.  
---
It'll be a fun skin, I'd bet.  So...  would like to have, but no worries...
---
if it someones camp,go dump your loot in YOUR stash box.
---
did something similar at  airport,dump the loot and wait.45 minutes it took for 2 twats to come and kill me,then watched them turn on each other as the
---
 workshop turrets laid into them
---
I actually have a few t-60 jet pack plans from the SBQ, they seem to drop more commonly now.
---
Also I tried to get a group photo after a SBQ fight once and everyone ignored me. :(
---

---
If you hit the VATS key (Q on PC) the Pearly Peepers will zoom
---
Sounds like a very unlucky night. The other night was the best night in there I have had to be fair. When I ran with my friend I only got at best 2 or 3 legendary mobs.
---
Damn that'd be cool.  If the prize isn't aton shop bound, they might be able to do that.  I'm guessing this all happens in the atom shop though, and they can't really interact?
---
The pun is better if it was unintentional.
---
Chinese robot poster?
---
Oh yeah an extra 20% would be a godsend
---
Early May
---
No, make it so that u can chuck them in normal mode too but make it so that you throw it right in front of you and you explode, killing everything around
---
I also wonder if Tenderizer stacks from multiple sources
---
Oh yes it has happened several times.
---
Is it stack per mutation or just one layer?
---
Multiple stack with this will be op...
---
It works if you are mutated with or without starched genes. As long as you have a mutation
---
Bethesda-This game is about coop and helping each other and teaming and surviveing the fallout together 
---
Players-don’t ever join teams 
---
Me-oh ok.........
---
Two level 13’s who were clearly grouped together happened to have their base just outside of mine. It must have been right on the edge. I saw them on the map and ran over and they got their guns out and hid around the corner of their wooden house. I dropped all my spare plans for them and they took them. In general low levels seem to expect high levels to brief them. But when I was looking at them both and their little wooden house with it’s decorations and all that, I couldn’t understand how someone could justify pulling out their explosive guns and destroying it all. Doesn’t make sense to me.
---
Lol I don't know why there's a discussion about levels. That's not what it's about
---
I think that’s a really cool idea. Maybe super mutants could scrap bigger items, like shopping carts, grills, cars and such, since their weapons and armor requirements are somewhat different.
---
My vnc is thru work.  Are there free and safe ones Der F could use?  And what would you need to access remotely?  A phone or another computer?
---
Whoa...  you should totally be able to remote access your computer with your phone.  Is this a thing? It should so be a thing.
---
I didn’t realize they used to drop from maps. No wonder people want them... was always curious why so many people were hot for lvl 25 shotguns. Thanks for the heads up on that
---
Says parkerjohn601, can’t you read?
---
There will always be those people who always follow meta and never come up with anything themselves, thus never going through the studying of the gear, thus knowing jackshit about what they are talking about.
---
So.. (for many of these idiots) of course, if the meta says 'unyielding cav combat', everything else is instantly 'useless'.
---
I'd take weightless shrouded wood armour any day as it takes up 0 weight in my stash.
---
The real issue people have is with the lack of understanding how some items differ from the others. Weapons with higher damage, but low RoF; high RoF, but low Range. Armour with higher DR, but lower ER; Less weight, but lower durability; great stats, but costs more to repair.
---
Pick your poison. It's all useful to somebody out there.
---
Southern Belle Motel is the hotel starting point, but looks like I was mistaken by the directions [https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/The-Mire-Fallout-76-Map.asp](https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/The-Mire-Fallout-76-Map.asp) it's near the M3 violet mark (treasure map). It's north of Harpers Ferry, not south, sorry for that.
---
Doubt they stack or this would be the effect everyone is after. But damn, that would be op!
---
upvoted and made my day for last two sentences
---
Yeah i know, but discussion about legendary will always lead to this.
---
They always find new spot to hoarding legendary.
---
wood armor should be a craft only and not dropped to begin with - make it the early game option of armor and leave it out of drops
---
I use to but after a awhile I completely stop looking and worrying bout that sub or what they say I don’t hate em there free to say and post what they want I just don’t go there no more 
---
Off topic kinda 
---
Any one remember that bar tender robot in good neighbor in fallout 4 man he was dope I wanted him as a companion the voice work and personality on him was amazing
---
Why do you ask?
---
Yep, lost 2 T-51 arms.  Fortunately, took less than an hour to replace.
---
Nah. move it to Aid. i wanna drink the forbidden lemon aid and fruit punch
---
What does the lvl 25 shotgun mean?
---
I ran the bourrow solo once last night while it was nuked. There were actually quite a large number of legendary ghouls.  The highest star level was two.
---
 I came out of there with over 10 crappy legendaries.
---
10% for a whole unique opt is let down lol.
---
Instead they should change into 10% mutate buff/debuff more effective and stackable.

I had never played an online game because, like you, I was worried about the griefing. I bit the bullet and started playing. I played solo until level 35ish, avoiding any other player. I got griefed at Flatwoods by a level 200+, then again at Morgantown.  Then in Charleston I got a random team invite and I figured, why not, can’t be any worse than the others that have griefed me. He turned out to be level 70+, and did the same thing with me. He was wonderful, and helped me out so much!  He introduced me to his team, who were all great, and I’ve met others along the way that I still play with. I’m now level 122 and I always help whomever I can...specifically lower levels. I get random messages from lower levels to help them with quests, supplies, advice, etc, and I always take the time (even if I only have a few minutes) to help them in any way I can. The point is that there really are a lot of great people out there who just want to help!
---
Getting same issue, this is top result when searching.
---
I crafted like 10 plasma cores, the plasma Gatling wouldn't use the damn things no matter what I tried but it sure as hell used all my fusion cores without telling me. Biggest game ruiner for me right now
---
honestly the crazy people blowing up random camps and stuff is more the exception then the rule 
---
also the robots didn't attack him because there is a quest that makes them neutral you can get and then you can just walk past the bots and they will ignore you 
---
that said I prefer the follow me emote over randomly shooting when someone doesn't have a mic as it scares people less
---
also switch on pacifist mode then no one can hurt you in adventure mode and you can make friends easier because your not worried about them eating you lols
---
No one knows when players will have the bans lifted if ever. OP is posting an unanswerable question. If the OP has been lurking here they'd know that. 
---
Players are still "salty" over duping wrecking the in game economy. It directly lead to TSE being nerfed. TSE should be the rarest and most powerful weapon. It is now neither of those TSE is nerfed and very common. 
---
So yeah people are gonna shit on these post we are all still pissed at them for exploiting the shit out of the game and quite frankly don't want them back.
---
Don't get me wrong. I don't expect or want the spawn rate to be huge as that would take away from the whole fact that legendary is supposed to be rare but come on. They should at lease be 3 Two star or above spawn as standard. Even if just for the first few weeks.
---
Stone bench plan is sold by your boi pendleton at whitesprings. Can't remember if it's an expensive one or not.
---
really it should be crafted in a box of 100 just like the other heavy weapon ammos or increase the burn damage and give us 25 per craft
---
Ugh I know exactly the sound you mean, like someone trying to plug a guitar into an amplifier
---
It's a shotgun that you can equip from level 25...
---
Lol...
---
No one knows I doubt even Bethesda has an answer for you at this point. Hindsight is always 20/20 you shouldn't have done whatever was that got you banned. And no I don't believe you when you say that you just pick up some stuff that someone dropped
---
Would probably be too OP I think, so they prematurely nerfed it ha! You can get around the negative effects of mutations with class freak, that's why everyone has them. Whereas junkies and bloodied actually make you vulnerable in exchange for the positive effects. Balance, I suppose ha!
---
Watoga merchants have the letters but not always so might require server hopping. The winter jacket and jeans comes from the responder bot at Charleston station but again will probably require server hopping to both get the bot and then the clothing.
---
Ugh slow internet, sorry for the wait. Here you go.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqtoBCWTae0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqtoBCWTae0)
---
1: AFAIK, only melee gets dmg boost from specials (although vats range, hit chance, etc are affected)  
---
2: Hindenberg was a Hydrogen filled Airship. It flew once before a spark turned it into a massive demonstration on the power of oxidization ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgWHbpMVQ1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgWHbpMVQ1U)) Basically: "It flies and Explodes"  
---
\#3: Wouldnt say useless, more of a becoming adapted to, kinda deal.  Vats distance is slightly affected by perception. Higher perception, higher distance. (also affects how far you can see them on the compass)  
---
\#4: Gauss rifles, Dragons, etc high damage for CritSniper. CritSniper is countered by getting close. As theirs hit at full damage from extended range. Yours are likely not setup to advantage that range. Most builds have about 2/3 - 1/2 the range capacity of a sniper. They want you out of your weapons range, which severly reduces dmg.  
---
\#5: Cavalier allows melee builds to close the distance without fear of getting squished at range. Never seen a non melee run it.   
---
% resist blows flat DR/ER out of the water. It doesnt work the same as in PvE, (I take \~1-2 dmg from super mutants, if any at all)   
---
I run 5/5 sentinel, Dodgy, and Lone wanderer for 95% dmg reduction . PvP has different damage rules (which changed again when survival came out) havent yet worked out the exacts, but heres some numbers from PvE to illustrate the diff in % and flat DR/er.  
---
I run \~300DR &amp; 95% dmg reduction. My setup turns 300 incoming damage down to \~2.5 dmg.  Without % mitigation, thats over 20million DR.
---
You can double dip pipe gun perks? I have a nice"ish" anti armor pipe pistol I've been holding on to. I'll have to play around with my perks
---
I've seen the mirror ball plan once and I didn't buy it, can't remember where though sorry.
---
It seems someone suggested deleting some game files and then verifying the instalation, but what I hadn't seen at the time were the replies by people saying it didn't work for them :(
---
Shhhhh
---
It won’t count for getting the mystery Easter item at the end of the week, you need to  acquire the egg plan for each egg each day
---
They want people to actually explore the world not just fast travel everywhere
---
I found all 3 last week took me 5 days total of  12 hrs 😅
---
I think is safer throwing than kicking a nuke in my opinion. Just for saying 😂
---
You did Sbq while wanted? Dont blame the game.
---
It makes me happy to see people post about this because I so desperately want the same. I always hope that each patch they do they address it, but so far nothing. I saw a post a few weeks back about the same thing, and one of the devs said they were going to bring it up again. So here's hoping its fixed in the next patch!
---
Takes so long to get the ammo made
---
So I'm sure you've noticed most of the weapons are left hand operation/left eject, even though they are mounted on the right shoulder.
---
No problem, sir!
---
It seems you found another oddity in how fallout76 works.
---
Two-Shot hunting rifle standard Receiver: 87 damage; 87.5 on calculator. (in-game is rounded down)
---
Two-Shot Hunting Rifle hardened receiver: 104 damage in-game; 109.38 on the calculator, 108.75 if you do the math (0.25*87+87)
---
With perks equipped standard receiver: 146 damage, 147 on the calculator (probably some rounding thingy)
---
With perks equipped hardened receiver: 175 damage, 183 on the calculator.
---
It seems that for Two-Shot rifles, hardened receivers only add up ~20% more damage instead of the ~25% for one-shot rifles.
---
tagging /u/akarnokd
---
/u/DontJealousMe I think you have the 60% from weapon specific damage + rank 3 bloody mess? If i equip those perks i get the same numbers. 191 in-game 201 on calculator. Math checks out with a 20% increase in damage from hardened receiver.
---
Anyway, nice find.
---
The 9 flamer fuel mentioned is including the ammosmith rank 2 card (+80%), normally it produces a whopping 5 fuel. While I don't have scrounger maxed out, I still feel flamer fuel drop chance and quantity are very low. =/
---
Definitely seemed like there was more on PC, I prefer PS4 for convenience
---
i think the only real limit is weight but there are perk cards that help make ammo lighter
---
This happened to me early on, so I will not accept any trade requests, unless I know the person. I had one person follow me around and keep trying to trade with me while I was doing a quest. I finally served hopped.
---
Thanks. Updated the website with the new calculation and also added adrenal reaction and nerd rage settings.
---
I still don't fully understand melee. I've read that each strength point adds +5% of the base damage, but your table has Strength x 5 which becomes 3.25. How does that work exactly?
---
Got the golden holotape yesterday went to the scenic caves to see if there would be anything going on I ran into three level 50 scorchbeast one left me in the ultracite armor mod plan one gave me a prime receiver plan and one gave me a legendary assualtron head I mean I didn't really need any of the stuff that gave me but they work pretty good drops for scorchbeast
---
But here's the problem:  you won't suffer.  Part of this game is exploring areas and coming close to dying.  Scrapping everything and surviving.  Getting things handed to you makes you miss out on some of the early struggle that I love, it also makes higher level enemies appear before you have the skills to fight them.
---
After level 30, the grind to 50 is real, but those first 20 levels to me are priceless.
---
READ THIS, back in the early days people would power level with a glitch that let them disarm traps indefinitely using the perk home defence. It doesn’t work anymore but if you’re on pc you can can use a macro to spam R and disarm a single trap between 5 and 200 or so times, it’s random. Can get a few thousand fuel in ten minutes by doing this and server hopping. I don’t usually condone exploits but it’s pathetic how long Bethesda have left this problem.
---
I apparently had the plan and didn’t know till just recently I’m not even sure how long I had it
---
Thank you, for going into so much detail. Your help really is appreciate! I might be able to get a nice build in order now. Thank you again!
---
golden holotape?
---
That is pretty low. 😞 I feel that it is pretty weighted towards ballistic ammo on the crafting but then it is realistic as that requires relatively little to make.
---
Received!  Just so ya know it's the Marine tactical helmet, the bug eyes one.  I've already disappointed 2 other people hahaha
---
Well.
---
It sucks you had these bad experiences.
---
I'm a male, but I experienced this situation in a lot of games, especially WoW (as a spectator as i was in the chat room), and everytime it happened I really felt ashamed, and the thing that makes me the most sorry is that I understand that these experiences may cause female gamers to actively avoid the social aspect of playing video games.
---
But I never took pity on the girl. It's the guys behaving like they never heard a woman talking to them (which might be true?) that really make me feel sorry about them.
---
Now, I'd tell you go just troll them with stuff like "is this the first time in your life you're speaking with a girl?" etc. But it's not really worth your time.
---
Take pity on them.
---
They should be helped, certainly not you!
---
Yeah I got the 60% and rank 3 bloody mess, just checked the pre nerf figures 🤣🤣 ridiculous with explosive shot like 840 damage. Wtf
---
I’m level 122, with over 10,000 caps and I still like to just wander around. I’ll walk from station to station at times just to explore. You’d be surprised how much you’ve missed!  When I do want to fast travel, my camp is centrally locates on the map to make it cheaper no matter where I go 😁
---
i have level 2 ammosmith and it still feels like i'm spending more time looting steel and lead than anything else in the game
---
Awesome for you! Did you do it by visiting locations the plans would spawn in the wild, or do you have another method?
---
I like the idea. Half price maybe.
---
To teach you something? Twat.
---
sorry not english native, bit dislectic (why s that such a hard word) and I type to fast xD
---
Or, they can make Sturdy versions of it, add some mods/plans &amp; make the Light/current version craftable right out the vault.
---
Even as things are now though, it is good, \*IF\* you can get a full set with Weightless, +1 Agility and Harder to detect while sneaking.  Run it with the Camo mod you get from the Free States quest line, and max stealth perks/Agillity and the only npc in the game that can detect you are scorchbeast(curse their sonar).
---
Who is still broadcasting these adverts and only these adverts in a post apocalyptic hellscape? XD
---
it's a one of the random spawns you'll come across a guy in a top hat named Willy he's got the golden holotape it's a reference to Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with the golden ticket.
---
The holotape is for an upgraded tour at the end scenic caverns on October 1st when I got the tape in the game it just happened to be October 10th so I went there anyways just to see if anything was going on and ran into three scorchbeast.
---
and they actually had pretty good loot for scorchbeast I mean not the best in that game or nothing but normally scorchbeast don't have loot.
---
The same automatic system that is broadcasting Radio Appalachia and Classical Music.
---
Lol broken economy there has been none to begin with. If you want what the current meda is you have to have 3 characters with max caps or have to trade for it to get it. For the people that can't spend every waking minute on the game to sell and trade to raise enough caps to even buy said weapons or armor. If they can buy with caps. If anything the dopers stabilized it by keeping people from getting so out of hand with prices. Plus TSE getting nerfed was a good thing.
---
They paid for the game same as everyone else, it's a game they seen an opportunity to make caps and toke it. They got punished because the game its self was not done and tested well enough before launch. It was half assed like your thinking.
---
They indeed need modified if it become real. But i dont think so, the risk from the debuff which stackable still high.
---
But it fun to play that way. A bit of risk, a bit of rack... lmao.
---
So I'm part of a group called "The beach boyz" everyone thinks where just a bunch of griefers, and fair enough we attack a lot of people but not without a reason and majority of the time we end up just fighting each other and having a laugh.  But there a times when we will sit at overseers for a while just handing out sets of BoS heavy combat armour,  mutation serumes and any legendary weapons we find to people, also did power armour for a while.  We're out to have a good time and while we pvp a lot, we mainly stay on survival servers and even then it's usually just all for one and we end up killing each other
---
Protective perks can be very useful: fireproof, nerd rage, serendipity.
---
I think that means "i've won a sweetie","lucked out"........if not, then ditto
---
golden holotape ?............................and now i need to look up scenic caves.
---
Oh you got me
---
Heh, yeah, guess that's one advantage of 76's 'Lol everything is automated' system. You can justify even the nonsensical.
---
If a token is 500 caps, then a single full-item reroll is 20 tokens *500 caps/token or 10,000 caps, and that doesn’t get you the item you want. It might get you from junkies to mutant slayer. 
---
Yes with these ratios 10 rerolls or 200 tokens is likely to get you a 10-20k cap item but would require 200 stars of legendaries or 100,000 caps (@200 token * 500 caps/token). 
---
How many tokens do you think you have, if you think you can “roll all day”?
---
How so? Is there a youtube vid explaining how that works? I am on pc and I have used makros in other games.
---
For some reason I’m always the main target of mobs when doing SBQ. I’m just shooting the queen and out of nowhere I’m getting lynched by a pick of mirelurk kings, bashed up my a glowing deathclaw and drowning in mirelurk queen spit. It’s ridiculous. And while I’m looting the SBQ they all gather inside the body so no one can hit them and hang up on me while I’m trying to loot. I get pushed around and shit. It’s annoying as hell and I’ve lost flux too.
---
Yes I went to the location, Arms I found at grafton steel open locker next to the armor workbench, chest inside  Eastern Regional Penitentiary at the amor workbench and legs I got right out side top of the world armor work bench.
---
Not true, I've personally found a single 3 star piece, although it was several patches ago and I guess luckily I haven't had any wood armor drops since(get a lot of rolling pins instead).  Anyway, that 3 star piece had Mutants, +1 Strength and Acrobatics/reduced fall damage; it was also an arm, which coming from FO4 was weird.
---
Nah. Violet flux isn't hard to make. Especially with everyone nuking Harper's ferry. Kill a few things, collect a few plants. Easy peasy. Costs nothing.
---
I'm mute on all the online games I play if it's not with friends. Fuck that noise.
---
Yeah I agree, I've been using Weapon Artisan to craft plasma cores with extra durability and my plasma gatling just ate them up in about 500 bullets, I was so done at that point, had to take a break.
---
don't think i have found end scenic caverns yet, i will go exploring. the top hat guy was probably a time event though
---
Yeah it was hard to find fun content about 76 since most of the top clicks well yeah.... After the first month I started looking up more but try to avoid it. One of the better things in Bethesda games are those little things and I want to find those myself if at all :p
---
yeah me too
---
LOL scrolled straight to the bottom knowing there would be some negative person
---
Rose. 
---
“LISTEN UP MEAT BAGS! I get a helluva kick out of these,  so now - YOU will TOO! ON EVERY CHANNEL!” *giggle cackle*
---
They removed the need for budget two or three patches ago :) 100% sure
---
Okay, I should have 3 but gave my buddy one so I have 2 sadly I’m on Xbox
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again, gaming subreddits do not represent anything more than a very small minority of players actually playing the game.  The only place to really find the community of the game is in the game itself, and I've found myself enjoying more and more games that the 2-3k people trolling subreddits all day tell me are terrible.
---
If those commercials are running in 2162, I can believe they are running in 2102.
---
As i know, no.
---
BOS exclusively plan only doing their event quest relates to BOS or doing send technical data.
---
I think I managed to use it two way - but only a short while after using it the "only" way
---
Can’t deflate a nuke lol sorry had to
---
I’m deciding to buy the game for the PS4 or PC
---
Never seen the Pulowski or the Fat-man ads.
---
&gt;They paid for the game same as everyone else, it's a game they seen an opportunity to make caps and toke it. 
---
They also agreed to the TOS like everyone else. They exploited it to get caps so yeah bye!
---
Instigating explosive gauss? That’s good right there. Whoever said it was trash needs to be sterilised in front of the world goddamn.
---
I use an explosive pipe rifle. I also use a two shot crossbow, pipe bolt action, among other things. Weapons that aren’t something you’d use against the SBQ or in pvp, but are fine for normal adventuring and aren’t actually that weak.
---
There are others too, for VATS for example. Most of them were made for Fallout 3.
---
This ain't it chief
---
Still 1k cryo ammo is consumed almost as fast as with a flamer the workshop your talking about where I’m farming crystals and acid but if I want to actively use my cryolator then this isn’t enough you juste can’t craft cryo ammo and exclusively use the cryolator while I can do that easiywith my Gatling gun or 50 cal
---
sheeeiiiit I just bought it yesterday
---
The key opens a metal door in the burrows.
---
Uncanny caverns **.  Sorry was using talk to text and didn't notice the mess up
---
Awesome job! What's your loadout?
---
We wouldn't need all these emotes (or see requests for them) if we could Simply get a text chat on all platforms already.
---
Some times you need to spell it out to people for them to leave you alone. An emote doesnt cut it.
---
Haha cool I just like sharing it because I want other player to get the same results 👍 with it getting fix soon I may have wasted my time but it's okay I couldn't wait 🙂
---
This totally seems like a lag to me. I once shoot a laggy player. He took four magazines (enough to kill 20 people, four magazines from vats headshots bloodbuild auto rifle) and just stood there. Then he died randomly from my hand, two minutes later, 300 meters from the point I shoot him at.
---
Treasure maps mostly give out mid level weapons like rifles, pistols... and shotguns.
---
That’s a solution till they fix it but it’s not the way it should be they just should decrease the ammo consumption of the flamer or increase the ammo you can craft at once
---
Yeah to keep them damn bastards from using my stuff..damn wastelanders all over my lawn
---
Lol couldn't come up with anything about everything else I said? Also the TOS changed after launch hahaha do some research bud.
---
Imo most people are helpful or will simply ignore you. Most griefers went to the PvP mode.
---
Even those who would grief can be ignored easily.
---
Remember, death means little more than the junk you drop. When killed In the normal game mode block the person who killed you then fast travel somewhere else or log.out then back on for a new server.
---
Also in the settings there is a pacifist mode or something, turn that on.
---
Not 100% sure of this changed since December. But that was how i played. Welcome to the game
---
Missing as in completely gone and I need to use a level up to get it back, no. But in the early days there was a common bug that would constantly unequip your perks. Not happened to me for months though.
---
They don't have damage drop off. You can fire those bad Bois way down a cliff past your render distance and still do damage. Pretty nice to deal with sneaky snipers on roofs
---
Stealth perks, Rifleman, That ignore armor rifle perk, and an anti-armor Sniper Rifle. You will one shot soooo much.
---
been there (caverns not caves)...........GUY ?    or robo  never got any of this.
---
got there by tring to avoid the scotchbeast on patrol further down the road from charlston.
---
that kicked my arse SO many times. now that I can kick 'his' arse , been back many times for revenge. but as the original post.................well a coupleof bits of ultracite I suppose
---
I try not to, but I still spam take when I see certain containers.  Racks up some plans over time.
---
Experiencing similar random disconnects a lot too lately.
---
On cable/Ethernet link and only getting poor connections with fo76 other games just fine online.
---
tank killer?
---
Last fight i was in as soon as the queen died she showed loot but it disappeared almost immediately.  I waited 10 minutes and nothing.  Left and fast traveled back and she still showed empty.  I wanted my loot.  I pounded her the whole time with my TSE shotty fir nothing.  Anyone else have this problem?
---
Do you want to use VATS? Because that determines quite a few perks
---
It happens sometimes. Even rarer is when it's just full of level 1 eyebots lol.
---
Yes
---
Maybe they are Germaphobes and they don't want your dirty hands touching everything in their house.
---
 Or maybe they just like privacy.
---
Who knows.
---
Ok, I am working on a build for you right now
---
I have a Vanguards combat armor chest piece I got from fighting the queen 2 days ago, weighing down in my inventory.  I really want to use it NOW, hence why I made the post :) 
---
Quick follow up question, do you go inside the prison to find the plan at the armor workbench, or is it inside the courtyard?
---
That was a lot of lag 😂 it went on for like 20 mins
---
I recently moved the game onto an ssd, didn't make any noticeable difference with anything.
---
The other heavey weapons. . .*cry's in .308*
---
Focus on the stealth part and sneak shots, so covert operative, sneak, mister sandman, escape artist
---
Unfortunately PC. But thanks. Perhaps I shall learn patience.....
---
What the...? Eyebots? Well, thank you for easing my mind. I was really scared. 🤣
---
Some one should go and check. debuff it as much as possible. I know syringer debuffs stack but no clue if any of them work on the robots.
---
I know it doesn't work for the axe, but my knife and power fist get the bonus.
---
Do you mean \[Imgur\]this([https://i.imgur.com/yVP2E89.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yVP2E89.jpg)) safe, at east of \[Imgur\]Harpers Ferry([https://i.imgur.com/vXg5HK3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vXg5HK3.jpg)) on east side of the river?
---
The safe says needs a key, but when trying to open it says "Opened elsewhere" this usually hints at terminal or keypad. The safe usually tells what key is used to open it, if you do not have that key it shows the keys name on top left corner of your screen.
---
There are other posts about this going back to the start of game and no idea how to open it yet.
---
Thank you all. Hopefully fixed soon. Don’t want to pay7500 for plans when lucked into the mod
---
my house is my house. you can use the outdoor crafting area.
---
If Rose went to the effort of setting up a TV Broadcast, it would be some Running Man meets Saw shit. Let's be real.
---
Absolutely.
---
As a person that has two PvP characters, one 4 pieces of cavalier, one sneaky sniper, I can assure you: cavalier armor cannot influence VATSability at all.
---
There is a way tho to negate vats and its related to maximising your sneak so much that enemy perception check fails. Its through sneak perks and harder to detect while sneaking armor. It reduces range from which your character is discovered by enemy character. In fact you can vats invisible people too - its just your perception must surpass the sneak attribute of your enemy, and invisibility gives a shitton of sneak, which pretty much happens only when bloodbuild with unyielding armor and 30 PE fights a chameleon mutation where the enemy aint crouching. Its super obscure hence not common knowledge. Oh, and also, the sneak bonus damage and covert operative perk works in PvP, but is only applied when enemy toons completely fails all possible perception checks against sneak. Not common knowlede either. I don't know why I'm even sharing this. I like it hard I guess.
---
I've got a full set of "harder to detect while sneaking" armor, also modded with shadowed/muffled effects and enemies will sometimes push me aside trying to find me.  I think my AG is in the low-mid 20's.  I haven't checked.  The only time I ever get spotted is if I'm forced to fight in broad daylight in the middle of some field.

---
The adrenaline is two switch out for Mr Sandman when it isn't night time
---
Good riddance it aint truth
---
Also would recommend getting a full set of chameleon armor or chameleon armor and standfast
---
Yeah you can use it to go down only if the quest is still active.
---
A majority of them have the crafting stuff inside of the house 😬
---
Unfortunately the average American today doesn't understand what the word communism (or socialism, for that matter) actually means, and that knee-jerk McCarthyist reaction is all they know. Their capitalist upbringing has ensured they will never dare open their mind to the possibility of a system other than the very one that oppresses them and serves to keep them enslaved to the almighty dollar their entire lives. 
---
If true communism could ever be applied in the real world, it would be a wonderful thing. Sadly, though, when anyone tries there's always someone at the top who decides (in the words of George Orwell) that while all animals are equal, some animals are more 'equal.'
---
There you have it. The cheater cheats are in fact server shits
---
Well... that escalated fast!
---
Sentinel assassins armor. If you're playing survival without it, you're dead.
---
I actually encourage people to come in to camp and take all of my water and harvest all of my veggies. 🤣 But I think some people are just protective is all.
---
Appreciate the clarification
---
I haven't heard the noise, but I let a workshop I'd taken get overun and the mission to retake it said it was overrun by sheepsquatch. Fast traveled there without thinking. Got a prostate exam from a deathclaw. Was very disappointed. 
---
I have found quills in a few places and what seems to be sheepsquatch hair on a tree at Larry's Meat'n Go. There was also some holotapes im the shed and a nearby camp that allude to the sheepsquatch.
---
yes, but it's not fixed or strictly defined.
---
The rules doesnt seem to be really clear.
---
I wouldn't want to discount wood armor outright.  
---
It should either get the benefit of being able to be three stars, or only drop on single starred enemies.  It's a little irritating to kill something challenging like the Impostor or SBQ and get a wooden leg that you know has only one effect.
---
The games great in my opinion. Plenty of places too explore and quests too do. There is story too if u want too pay attention too it all but I’m usually running through all my quests for the loot. Their are still a lot of flaws like legendaries being so random and stuff. And the stash weight always being too low and the amount of glitches. But even accounting for those things it’s still super fun too be hopping on with friends or joining people in events or just too explore the wasteland together.
---
If u have some friends who might play and won’t leave u half way through because of the majority’s opinion of this game being “bad” then I fully recommend it. 100%
---
In fact I even recommend without some friends but only about 80% 😅 as long as u try too interact with people in game sometimes. And if anyone says “I’m just roleplaying as a raider” and starts too destroy ur camp or workshop in full Ultracite Power Armor. Scrap ur workshop and leave. They are just idiots who wanna troll.
---
If i remember is about 56k ammo base on game engine bit unit or something like that.
---
But how is the Violet flux situation?
---
I always seem to find boiled or purified water where ever I go and I have the carnivore mutation so no veggies for me 😋
---
Thank you for the info!
---
I got the scenario at Whitespring after a nuke that replaced all the ghouls with level 1 eyebots.  Soooo much level 1 wood armor.  I was going to leave it there, but then one of them dropped a level 1 Beszerker's pitchfork and I though "hmm, low DR with legendary effects and a high damage weapon ... interesting build idea."   Its been fun so far.
---
those are mine. outdoor crafting area is for randoms
---
Ok, thanks
---
Nice try Bethesda.
---
🤣 it must be nice! I am the official Stimpak Supplier for all of my friends so I am constantly running out of water.
---
If people are being mean I recommend u just change ur voice chat mode too team only.
---
Assuming u can do that on ur device, I play on PC 😐.
---
Lol we still don’t know if that was it
---
That was me. I was going to log off but I usually check all the missile silo's before I do to see if anyone is going to launch a nuke. Saw that you were in the silo then you weren't a couple of times and I figured you might need a hand. That was only the second or third time I was in a silo. I had a blast ( no pun intended ). That's what I love about this game, most people help each other out. Small world!
---
What isn’t truth?
---
Teach me what exactly. Have you even read the post. And what's with the insults?
---
Interesting idea. 2 points:
---
1. Bethesda uses the cap limit to limit the economy. When you hit it, you have no choice but to buy stuff and/or stop selling selling stuff to vendors. It means that high level players have to leave some loot for lower levels and trade with them.
---
2. A working bank with an active network of ATMs running on caps would be a bit difficult to fit into the lore.
---
Depends on the distance and the build. If you can swap perks accordingly to preferred distance, then gauss is better at range higher than vats, and handmade is better while in vats range.
---
Well there's non undergroundjn the Burrows
---
That sound strikes terror into the heart of many a brave wastelander. Almost as bad as those fucking beeping collars in the Sierra Madre. That shit made me jumpy af for weeks. 😳
---
So why didn't I get One?
---
Kudos.
---
Cavalier does not deny sneak and I have four months of testing cavalier builds to back that up
---
That’s a bat my dude.
---
But I can see how it looks like a bird!
---
Maybe try leaving some bird feed outside with an open window? Or maybe build a birdbath outside!
---
Wearing power armor? With nerd rage and emergency protocols mod I get REALLY tanky at low health.
---
It would at least need to be a boss versus normal enemy style loot.
---
Even normal Yaoi Guais and Gulpers give much better loot than SB's
---
It's almost like they thought no one could be able to kill them and thus gave them a minimal loot as after thought.
---
LOL
---
Nice!
---
Most people i find lock stuff so mobs cant get in a destroy anything.  My ground lvl is locked but the rest isnt. Typically if theres a generator in my camp its not ground level and behind locked doors
---
Every time someone says Matt Damon, I hear Sarah Silverman singing "I'm f*$%ing Matt Damon" in my head.
---
They weren't wearing power armor
---
There is an emote name “no” find them in atom shop.
---
They feel less guilty if you ask me.
---
I'd settle for a Guage being in the camp terminal tbh
---
Every time I see a lvl one at the vault I tell my wife “ look, a baby”. We both then travel to the vault and unload plans,  ammo, health items and a few cranberry relish, on the corps at the bottom of the stairs then we ft back to camp.
---
the tour bit did seem familiar, i found the caverns when i was looking for the brotherhood, looking back it seems obvious i should have gone stright to the local insane asylum.
---
Weird. I logged on last night and it was in a nuke area and I had no problem running over and joining in.
---
Text chat would be great, but how many people begging for a TSE or Unyielding Sentinel do you want clogging your screen?
---
There is No matchmaking.  I play Ps4, it's hard to judge player count since only 24 people can be on the same map at once.
---
yas
---
Actually did a quick loop before work today and ran into half the dungeon being lvl 22-38 ghouls, so it's not a guaranteed max level area.  A slight bummer, but still a good runner-up to Whitespring.  (I feel confident that there's more ghouls in Whitespring, but Burrows is close.)
---
You probably get downvoted because you are coming of as telling everyone what to do and how to play.
---
What? No matchmaking? Even on PC?
---
Then how do you play if you have no friend playing the game?
---
I think most folks are just buying the serums from other players for way less rather than seeking out the recipes.
---
Yes! That's the one! Shame no one figured out how to open it...
---
And what about my other questions about more mounted animals - anyone knows how to get others that I've mentioned in the topic?
---
+5% is correct
---
3,25 = 45str (45×5=225)
---
There is actually one more explaination besides lag. Lag is still the most probable. The other one is that the fight happened at the border of an event and your "event team" vs "pvp status" has bugged. Seen people exploiting that.
---
“Baggie poops”. 😂
---
I bought the game originally on Xbox One Size and the performance was too rubbish for me to handle. Since getting the PC version I've been having a lot more fun.
---
All posts must be from, directly reference, or talk about something to do with Fallout 76.
---
I just log in and play, I have no friends that play this game either so I play solo 99% of the time.  I'm sure there's reddit sites or discords that have some kind of matchmaking service but you can't find it in game.
---
A lot of people wreck others camps, especially decontamination arches. I’d rather keep stuff behind a locked door so if they break in they become wanted I can kill them before they do damage
---
My first time at the camp I was getting shot just standing there over and over. I'm like well this will be interesting.
---
Since then tho, it's got all the fools outta the game. Now it's just legit fallout fans. I mean not all, just imo. My pvp experience has been about as anti violence as it should be out in the wasteland. Waves, hearts, helping a lower level like me (32 I think). 
---
Been fun, anyone have some fusion cores to sell? Haha.
---
I love seeing everyone's different builds. Some love hardcore power armor. Some love walking around in a bikini shorts. Good times out there.
---
Even with that XP farm that got you a ton of Fuel, it is still not worth it to use a Flamer.
---
Weird. It definitely used to.
---
but looks good now as i can tell - gr8 work .)
---
Well if they Don't half ass it you would have different channels. So begging would largely take place in a trading tab. 
---
Aside from that i would take a take a text chat because it brings more good than harm. There will be minor inconveniences, People spamming, People RPing in non private channels etc. But simply Make spam a bannable offense and we're good.
---
Actually that's a good idea. We should be able to have Liberty Prime themed power Armor. Not the huge Goliath that we know and love but scale Prime down to fit a power armor station.
---
The economy is broken in this game. Players have multiple mule account simply for savings accounts. I get the idea that Bethesda wanted but this game has evolved and we need to with it. Why continue this way? Why not make a cool enhancement and keep it on their terms? Plus the lore with the banks/atms would be no different than the BOS mission where you have to stand at the DMV. i guess if we question every aspect according to lore, we need to ask our selves how alot of the stuff we already have is relevant. Player vending and things like wiffle ball bats dont really have a place according to lore but that doesnt mean we dont want them and they arent cool lol.
---
When I read this title I thought someone picked up the 100 plans I dropped on a responder corpse outside vault 76.
---
I had too many known plans and thought it best to drop them where the next new players would spawn.
---
Guess I might never know if they got found :/
---
If they allow upgrading legendary tier of items (i.e. make 2* out of 1*) then there will be a particular playstyle for which the wooden armor with right mods will be the most efficient and useful combination. Its all about the mods and effects anyway, and shrouded wooden armor, if 3*, would be the most useful one to quickly penetrate enemy territory while sneaked.
---
Ha! Yeah, I kept getting killed by those awful chrome robot ladies. So I'd spawn at my camp next door to the silo, and try again. I think I died three times trying to get to the control room, and then another two before you showed up.
---
To date, that's the only nuke I've had time to launch. So I appreciate the help :D
---
yeah it does feel like they didn't expect people to finished the game so quickly, i fight the Yaoi Guais and Gulpers on a regular basis and it always feels rewarding
---
I read ya! I found a bobby pin on the floor the other day and rejoiced.
---
I hope to get to those levels, feels like it's taking forever! I'm only lvl 32. 
---
Nice video I enjoyed watching it.
---
Try going for Light Leather Armor with Swift mod for the legs, "move almost as fast as walking when crouched". Stabilized arms, "Almost no scope sway". Ultralight Chest Piece, " Armor weight dictates how stealthy you are to a point. Try and get chameleon on what you can since it stacks. Silenced lever is the best weapon I've found thats a non legendary to use for normal enemies. Switch over to a handmade when things get rough.
---
Locked doors stop scorched and etc... wandering in and getting all tunnel vision on your fusion generators
---
Best skin in the game 😎 but yeah, too bad my best pistols are all western revolvers
---
I am interested in any legendary shotgun you have, explosive or not! Currently using a two-shot but the recoil and accuracy from TS makes it really hard to use sadly.
---
Don’t hold your breath.  This game was DoA.
---
I only have a lock on the door to the sleeping area on one of my camps, and I only close that door if I need somewhere semi-secure to put my character if I’m going to go make a snack or something. Used to have a lock on my generator hut in the hopes of keeping creatures out, but then they spawn inside the hut anyway and people would get wanted just for trying to get in there to help, so I took the lock out. People want to use my workbenches, facilities, resources, they’re welcome to.
---
You should probably have pacifist mode on when in big crowds you probably became wanted but accident hitting someone
---
Oh okay
---
BAGGER 288!!!!!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azEvfD4C6ow
---
Nah I feel u man.
---
Some of the community on this sub reddit is what drove the few friends I had with this game too getting “bored” of it.
---
Now we were at the power plant so that could have been what happened and we claimed a his work bench but we couldn’t kill him but he could still kill us
---
Man, I sure wish I had a morningwood0917 when I was your level...
---
  I have some.  Don't use them, so I'm not sure how many I have on hand.
---
Won't be on until midnight (EST) or so tonight though.
---
need to do a vendor run, so will likely be in WS.
---
GT aj ninetyeight.

Yeah same for me, i have the best western revolver with tse and 1 perception. I bought the skin like 10 minutes ago after grinding Atom Points from challenges for like 2 hours and now i'm sad that it cannot be applied on my pistol. But maybe I will be lucky enough one day that I do find a god .44 pistol :D
---
AAE laser is a collectible legacy piece. E laser weapons have been removed from loot pool. Don't drop anymore. Laser weapons sucked when duping was rampant, were mostly ignored by dupers, besides the TSE variant. AA came to rise after the TSE nerf, and duping was mostly eliminated by then. These conditions makes any energy AAE BE whateverE rare, unique, most probably undupped collectible pieces.
---
I think they could just allow us to bulk caps and store them in our stash to give us more flexibility in trading
---
It never ceases to amaze me how many new players / low levels don’t just take a second and look… just look… at what is going on. “Oh this person is shooting the ground specifically. And he appears to be humping the ground. They keep flashing their light at the ground too. Fucking psycho. Well, I better server hop.” How do people not see the paper bags. I’ve had to recollect my dripped care package more times than I can recollect. Glad to hear you didn’t panic and had a blast!
---
Oh you thought I say what happened to you didn't happen and you made it up? Nah, I don't think so, I believe you are interested in learning the reasons hence I try to provide as accurate info as I have.
---
I did the original nuka paint with the clues the game gave. Any ideas on where to find clues for the quantum paint? I just don't want to use datamined info.
---
Used to be may favourite weapon build in fallout 3, but it's been useless since fallout 4. I think it should be classed as an explosive weapon so that demo expert would buff it and also I agree, definitely not enough ammo for it at the moment.
---
I’d love to have a ladies PS4 76 group!
---
The atom shop actually has one
---
Its not just reloading, but when you attack w/melee or shoot a projectile as well.
---
Then my bet switches from the lag to the event bug. Workaround: go to pipboy, data, events, select the problematic one and press the reject button
---
You make friends as you travel through the game.  It is quite an amazing experience actually.  I play with players I've met on here every day and meet new ones all the time.  I'm on PS4.
---
did you pacify it or tame it
---
So it’s not like The Division where you only meet players in PvE if you matchmake/make a group?
---
The OP was free to opt out of the offer to be power leveled and just say I appreciate it, but I'd rather explore new shit.  Clearly they had a good time and appreciated the experience.  
---
I personally like exploring, but it's cool if that's not everyone's cup of tea.
---
I've offered to bodyguard low level players at the Whitespring and they politely turned me down because they'd rather focus on the main questline or just explore at their own pace.  That's fair.  I wanted to do the same with my first character so I get it.  I participated in xp/loot farming much more with my second character, and he's nearly the same level as my first after about a month.  LOL.
---
Candles are basically cloth and oil, so I don't see why not?
---
Try playing Survival Mode.  You could have... taken care of.... that problem.
---
Yup. 
---
Visit my shop. alteron_command.
---
Ok. How much will you sell them for? I dont have a lot of caps since im just level 27
---
I agree. Everyone down voting you has a TSE handmade they sure didn’t from a legendary drop. Now that they have their illegitimate god roll guns and armor they can easily sit high on their perch and judge.
---
Maybe they’ll add it during the thirstiest time of the year
---
I'm glad others are thinking this. I think they really missed out on allowing us to play as gouls, mutants, vault dwellers and raiders. Could have had seperate story lines that would have caused us to have conflict with players from other factions and races.
---
Nope.  Here, you just walk up to folks and start talking, just like in real life.  You might help someone in a tough fight, share supplies, etc. and have a friend for life.  I was leery of it at first and I believe it's what makes the game special.  You can form teams here, too BTW.  I din't want to mislead you.  They are great.
---
What does that mean
---
https://youtu.be/3SgND89KUWE
---
So has anyone found a way around this or are mods just useless now?
---
Disappearing dead enemies. This is happening especially in the new Burrows dungeon. You kill something while it was moving and it's body either disappears or stays visible, but not clickable/lootable. After a while the meat pile appears on some random location around that spot and if you can find it you can loot it.
---
Unable to attach premade mods to anything.
---
Enemies regenerating health as you shoot them. Seen especially on high ROF and high DPS weapons.
---
I have like 20 I can get rid of, I can be on in a couple of hours, might go for like 5 or 10c per, I think they're all full too. Will have to check back, PSN is Fluffyhooves
---
Sorry that my PSN name.
---
there is no text chat (yet), you can only communicate with emotes and voice. On xbox you can send messages to their profile through the xbox home screen though
---
Nice. If you meet another player can he/she kill us or we kill him/her?
---
Yeah... I’m maxed on caps and these are all I really want (and can get without trading). Oh well, Modus gets my money I guess
---
this is a cool story, and hopefully now once you get high level too, youll remember this and go back to V76 and help some noobs out too!
---
tats what happened to me, instead of a viscous cycle, its more a of a helping cycle
---
Ok, sounds good!
---
Are you that inept to find it yourself?
---
My friend, two days ago, got a drop off the Sheep:
---
3 star Tesla Shotgun: Executioner, Explosive.
---
I was teamed with him, and I got my usual 1 star wood armor...
---
People use mics? I rarely ever see anyone talking. Could some of them be following you? Cause I never hear people talking.
---

---
As others have stated, workshops can be contested anywhere in the build zone. Once a workshop is contested, the current owner is automatically labelled as hostile. The owner can be killed regardless of their location in the world. 
---
Example: If there’s a team of 2 players. While 1 player contests the workshop, the other can be on the other side of the map killing the owner. Also, a solo player can contest a workshop, leave the build zone fractionally before the “Claimed” meter fills, and travel to the owners location to kill them. This method would give the contesting player the most amount of time to leave the build area before the meter fully restores the workshop back to the owners possession. 
---
Its clear the system implemented is far from ideal, however it’s a vast improvement from the previous “claim at the workshop bench”. I can imagine it’s difficult for Bethesda to find a solution that’s 100% fair for both parties. At the end of the day, claiming a workshop provides great rewards while making yourself vulnerable.
---
For the Gattling Plasma, Just find one with the Quad Prefix.  It does the same for it, that Power User does for the Gattling Laser, of course a Quad Gattling Laser would still be better.  Also, if Ammo is an issue for the Gattling Plasma, you probably shouldn't turn around and complain that Plasa Cores, which aren't actually that common a spawn, spawn in too large a number.
---
For Drills and the like, Weapon Artisan + Makeshift Warrior + Luck of the Draw.
---
And that "separate perk" thing isn't ever going to happen.  Also, quite litteraly, the only perks that aren't passive are the ones that require you do "search" to get their benefits.  So what you really mean is Combat perks and non-Combat perks.
---
Best of luck in your recovery man, that's a pretty serious procedure
---
I'm on PC. I wish they had cross platform play. I have been helped out by some really awesome players, and I have been griefed  by some jerks. But over all, I've been having a great time. Sometimes I go looking for low level players and try to help them out, Food, water, weapons and ammo. Pay it forward people.
---
That's some 50 cal.........Great work.
---
I thought it was just me not figuring out how to place it properly. Bethesda, please fix this! I paid good pretend money for this sign.
---
Not all of them are available/found yet. I think I have five of them.
---
Four can be started from the Lying Lowe starting building, by clicking the map notes on top floor.
---
The fifth one came with Burrows opening and can be started from Toxic Larry's Meat'N'Go just west of Berkeley Springs.
---
Instigating DMG doesn't show in weapon stats because it's conditional. Simply if enemy is full health you will do twice as much DMG as without instigating effect.
---
Thanks. It's wacky indeed. Tried to work out a formula:
---
**Hardened**
---
Base \* (1 + two shot) \* (1 + hardened + rifleman + bloody mess)
---
`70 * (1 + 0.25) * (1 + 0.25 + 0.6 + 0.15) = 175`
---
Base \* (1 + two shot + hardened) \* (1 + rifleman + bloody mess)
---
`70 * (1 + 0.25 + 0.25) * (1 + 0.6 + 0.15) = 194.25`
---
**Standard**
---
Base \* (1 + two shot) \* (1 + rifleman + bloody mess)
---
`70 * (1 + 0.25) * (1 + 0.6 + 0.15) = 153.125`
---
Base \* (1 + two shot + rifleman + bloody mess)
---
`70 * (1 + 0.25 + 0.6 + 0.15) = 140`
---
Still inconsistent.
---
That depends on various circumstances.  I have 'Pacifist' enabled so I don't worry about all that.  They have Survival servers that have fewer restrictions on PVP.
---
Yeah bought it thinking it would work on my western. Should have check reddit first! :[
---
You left out 1 step.  Perma-block before server hopping.  If it was actually a real trade, he would have stopped after 1 attempt.
---
In most all of my C.A.M.P builds, I've usually always left my home open. Over some the the last builds, I've been "renting" rooms, and have an active shop. If I'm not around the area, the shop/work area gets closed, but the waiting room is always open. This is also coming in preparation for permanent C.A.M.Ps and player vending. I'll definitely go back to open building at somepoint. 
---
One of my unlocked builds.

---
It’s not very nice to feed homeless people dog food
---
That sounds incredibly unfun tbh. One of the best aspects of the game is how you become stronger by yourself and being able to explore more higher leveled areas, that's how the game's supposed to be played. I still remember the moment when I was finally strong enough to be able to set foot into Watoga, it took a while but it was worth doing on my own.
---
Wait till you meet a level 50 Colonel Gutsy... Guy cuts you down in seconds (level 90 here)
---
Yeah I got to 52 before I decided to just start over then got to 21 on the other before I decided to play Skyrim
---
I've just been having the game straight up crash to desktop in the middle of doing random things.  Walking aimlessly around Cranberry Bog, swapping perks, eating food, vending, the middle of combat, you name it.  Shutting down Discord seemed to help, but it still happens like 2-3 times a day instead of 5.  I've validated file integrity, made sure I don't have any updates pending, you name it.  I'm sure it's some kind of conflict on their end.
---
My initial load-in also seems to take a good 30 seconds or more.  I have a decent PC rig with 16g of RAM, 4g graphics card and a SSD, with a 100mbs hardwired connection to the station at the end of my block.  I could probably stand on my front step and hit the building with a baseball it's that close.  Clearly it's not a problem on my end.
---
I'm sorry you encountered those situations. Also a woman FO76 player here, tho currently not playing due to busy schedules. But I've been on the fence often enough just hovering over those mic settings for a good few minutes when I start to play to know how you feel.   
---
I would so love to play with the mic on. Heck, I even think of making sure to play in a quiet area with the windows shut and no background noise, so as to not annoy fellow players. But playing with Mic On is feels like a game of 'instead of going on a roadtrip by yourself you can group up with new-found friends! Buuuuut you have to keep a non-stop lookout and guess which one of these pals is going to stab your tires!'   
---
WHY would anyone want to play that game, exactly?
---
I hope you find good people to hang out and enjoy FO76 with, maybe we'll even share a server one day. But until a lot more people (including awesome guys) start calling out players who make disgusting remarks as a cohesive cultural effort, I'm out there in the wasteland having a riot and drinking brew. But it's a private party, and that'll be just fine.
---
Oh.. Thirstiest time of the year?
---
*want a sprite cranberry?*
---
The only person I would feed dog food is you.
---
Dont do much selling other than to vendors, so I have no idea on what they are even worth.   
---
 I'm sure by now you know they are craftable (under energy ammo, I think)
---
I'm sure we can work out some sort of trade.
---
Yep i never count on others i always take all conduits and kill sheep myself.
---
What does that mean in english?  I'm not computer savvy.
---
If you're on Xbox and the drum is bloodied I'd be interested
---
Now that you can seel serums to venders they are a lot more sought after. They are still for sale but the price is going up as all the dupes are running out.
---
That would make sense. Can any one confirm that?
---
1*?
---
Yes, Level 50
---
Nah back in the dupedays some friends had over 500.000, of multiple types.
---
I had a similar incident but I was already maybe level 70-80. I was launching my first solo Nuke and when I got to the final room a much higher leveled guy came in and stole the nuke from me lol I wasn’t too upset since I’ve done nukes before in groups. He then invited me into his PS4 chat with his group of friends who basically took up the entire server. He brought me with him into the nuke zone to kill the SBQ and afterwards him and all of his friends helped me out (and each other) by giving away gear/plans that we didn’t already have. So it’s great to meet really nice people in this game :)
---
Lol ty
---
Yeah, like how most of the higher tier enemies drop a couple of raw scraps, Scorchbeasts should drop like 6-9 ultracite scraps instead of or in addition to their wing or bone. They should also drop maybe 1-2 of a random pure Flux so you don't have to nuke places to get them.
---
Or at least a please wait / emergency alert system screen
---
oh...
---
I thought taking a workshop marks where you are on the map or something. I guess that only happens for the defend event, you guys are saying.
---
I’ll remember that ty
---
Just pointing one detail that nobody have: The mutation only works in combat (as per the in-game description). That means that if you holster your weapon it won't trigger. But i'm not really sure if that's a positive, negative or neutral thing.
---
THE ANSWER IS CLEEEEEAAAR
---
Maybe they could show an Emergency Broadcast when someone launches a nuke.
---
Cause people are stupid lol
---
Okay, so it does not mean someone can just kill me while i’m exploring the world right?
---

awesome! 
---
cherish this time, too soon teens will only want to be with their friends
---
hopefully this will be a great time to bond and spend time together
---
Nuclear hot potato.
---
I just had to reload the game.
---
Whener I see thse posts where a high level Power Armor dude helps out new players it kinda feels that it plays into the narrative of the game. All these other factions failed: 
---
* Brotherhood had the equipment, but wasn't open to new contact. 
---
 
---
* Responders were kind and helpful, yet they lacked resources and technology.  
---
* Free States were just holed up and relying on science, which actually just brought all the misery.  
---
But now all these players have learnt from the past/the history in the game provided. They follow the overseer and create a better world.
---
G-DAWG!
---
hey add FOR SCIENCE to anything seems more legit
---
Can I have your wallet... - no....
---
Can I have your wallet for science? - hmmm no
---
I said more legit not completely legit. To get the wallet you need spread sheets and when they are distracted you grab it and run.
---
Wasn't wanted.
---
honestly I got a two shot gatling plasma and 102 plasma cores that no one ever wants sooo yeah.....
---
The same happened to me and my friend, the only good thing was the flux I needed.
---
Yeah it's the one propaganda poster about it being a war machine.
---
ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Bethesda could just stop breaking things with patches? like they did with the mods?
---
I figure every post about it until it gets fixed helps motivate Bethesda to do better 
---
We need feedback.  All you have to do is not read the post that offends you so much. simple!
---
Ouch. That really hurt. Luckily I have the perk where it’s 3 times as beneficial so yeah actually I’ll take it
---
It’s the most THIRST, THIRSTIEST TIME OF THE YEEEEAAAARRR
---
Bethesda Support refunded atoms once, I wrote a nice letter, said I loved the game, and just felt the purchase was unclear and it was quick and painless! :)
---
SB bones scrap for ultracite
---
iron viens in nuke zones become ultracite veins.
---
if you dont need to to craft flux, hardended mass scraps for ultracite
---
wendigos and mutants drop screws.
---
most toys, desk fans, near workbenches....
---
Bans are not typically undone. You have lost that account, any character on it, and any other games held by that account. Go away, we did not like you anyway.
---
Bought the holiday emotes lol
---
Did you do the quest?  It's easy to get once you complete the quest.
---
Wtf.gif
---
Full set of wood armor with Shroud mod.
---
* Tank Killer
---
* Tormentor (especially for PVP)
---
* Rifleman (rank 1)
---
* Master Rifleman (rank 1)
---
* Expert Rifleman (rank 1)
---
* Evasion (Agility Defense)
---
* QOL: White Knight (Equip to Repair armor)
---
* Ballistics Perk Rank 2 (Weight reduction on all ballistic ammo)
---
* Research Mods on Wiki for +sighted Accuracy mods.
---
* Sneak Rank 3
---
* Escape Artist
---
* Grim Reaper
---
* Lone Wanderer
---
* A few more of the Crit based perks (Forgot names, but use less AP per crit/higher crit damage)
---
* Action Boy/Girl if you got any points left -- But they don't regen during battle, just speed up downtime between.
---
I lock one room and my generators. I have two bedrooms and one I'll go afk in.
---
I'd like them to tease a big update like Wastelanders through the TVs. No warning through reddit of inside the vault, just suddenly a small video or gif appearing on the screens by surprise. Would cause so much hype
---
Go ahead and mention how the broadsider is kinda useless and doesn't really have a niche. They need to increase the explosive area ot its damage. Or give it 100% knockdown. Idk
---
Oh yeah. One bad personal experience and it sucks. Yep.
---
I have no idea what the market rate is for an All Rise.  If you're not focus on melee, then some people have no use for it.
---
Also enable level 3 super duper when you craft ammo. 30% chance you get double ammo.
---
Nice man, great job
---
Now I want a Starship Troopers game.
---
I still haven't gotten the "Get killed by a nuke" trophy yet. And I killed myself a bunch of times for if
---
Now, if I downvote this, am I a Bethesda employee, or just someone who thinks that's a silly theory?
---
Love,
---
Definitely-not-Todd-Howard
---
Especially now that they separated pvp
---
That would works also with the radio, like a Podcast about the game made by the developers.
---
No worries, thank you for responding at least :)
---
Cant blast damage from tse initiate combat after sbq is dead?
---
There’s two modes. Adventure mode is mutual PVP mode (outside of workshops, which are designated PvP points). Both of you must shoot at each other to initiate PVP, otherwise neither does damage. 
---
Survival mode is full PvP all the time.
---
Lol thanks someone else with a bit of perspective. Thank you.
---
Found a couple 1\* Legendaries.  That was it.
---
They really need to do something about getting a run on the same kind of Legendary.  I don't farm Whitesprings, but it feels like whenever I'm passing through a nuked area killing Legendaries, I find numerous items of either the same type or prefix.  Which would be great if it were a nice prefix, I guess, but I have no use for Stalker or Junkie crap.
---
I stopped even looking for them from other players and have started just buying them from the Enclave.  Gotta spend the caps somewhere and I have all the weapons and armor I want.  This way, I can sell the crap legendary drops I get from farming for caps and actually participate in the market instead of looking for TSE, BE weapons or AS armor trades.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
Okay thanks!
---
I can see where you are coming from but this is actually very helpful information. This is at most minimal constructive criticism and it's sad that people can't take that as a means to learn.
---
I'm able to get one 3 star item per 2 runs from there, worth to mention sometimes it's from 3 star gutsy not the ghoul tho.
---
Cool - ghoul slayer better than TSE?
---
I can’t speak to player base, but I can say PC has the advantage of being able to run mods. I consider Perk Loadout Manager to be an essential mod; when patch 7 broke it I stopped playing until it was updated. There’s several others that are really nice but not essential (for me)
---
Is the game soloable for 100% trophy?
---
yeah for the number of things that need flux there should be other ways to get flux than just nuke zones because it puts a limit on lower level players being able to survive long enough to get the hardened mass and the others, even at level 50 i was dying alot and losing that stuff in places like whitesprings
---
I see.  Well I suggest 1 thing.  There are sites out there that allow you to plan your perks as you level.  Figure out what you want to end up with and then you already know what you need to get for the end state.   Its difficult in this game actually because of the drops.  You may not even get a good rifle legendary drop.  But if you are willing to use just crafted stuff vice legendary its ok.  I am using crafted handmade.
---
You have to be dead center, ground zero.  Took me a few tries too.
---
Money.  Purified normally sells for like 5 caps each depending upon Charisma.  So at a rate of 5 caps per pound, it's a decent and easy way to make some dough.
---
Will give it to u for free, add me nick is Knifo
---
GOT TO GRIND BOY
---
I'd be curious to know if you notice the same thing.
---
Given that it's an event, I don't like to just jump in and kill the thing before others can participate.  The cards aren't crazy expensive and it's pretty easy for end-gamers to buy them in quantity with nothing else to spend caps on.
---
When the voice actor is talking, I swap in Chem Fiend, Field Surgeon and First Aid, then grab all three pylons, finishing with the one nearest the shack,  and jump on the roof while everyone else runs around like maniacs.  If I can see the impostor, I'll shoot at it, but otherwise just take out gutsies and minimize trash while eating stims.  If there's like 3 minutes left and the event isn't progressing well, I'll just get off the roof and light the thing up with VATS crits while eating a couple quantums and a hoppy hunter.  
---
Some people have less than stellar connection speeds and may require a couple seconds to finish fast traveling in.  It's not real sportsmanlike to just mash the thing, unless you're on a dead server and feel like going full HAM for a cool video.
---
Not trying to tell you how to play, just offering my opinion.  I get a little bummed when I spend caps to port into the event and the thing is a smoking husk because I wanted to store some ballistic fiber before FT.
---
Mine too, and I love exploring (pretty sure I've got nearly everything now...), but sometimes you're skint and just wanna fast travel to a nuke zone to try your luck.
---
Nice 😁
---
I was thinking more in-universe, like a Responder who left Appalachia with some other people to escape the Scorch Plague is sending a message back to see if the area is safe again (but better and more intriging). 
---
But radio would also work and probs be a lot more realistic storage wise, I remember the F4 mod to add in videos to TVs took up a massive amount of space.
---
I mean - I'll try it again for science. But my first experience wasn't very encouraging. And the Whitespring does what it does \*every single time.\*
---
Have you thought how you are going to prove such violation in court? You need strong evidence that something sexual harassment has happened. You know what means strong evidence? Court won't judge people, because some anonymous person was insulted by some anonymous person inside game. You don't even know that person is girl who is telling she was insulted. Buying a game doesn't mean that there can't be some else playing with another players account. She/He might be underage and then legal cant do anything etc. This was just a one point to this case. Believe me its not going to work.
---
If pacifist is off. Sounds like maybe someone exploited the fact that he had a workshop though. But maybe he also left pacifist on.
---
All I'm saying is that it'd be nice to have a cheaper option for the skint players.
---
Nobody likes a poopy pants. Downvote.
---
See, someone gets it!
---
i do have level 3 super duper but for 3 points you would hope for more than just 30%, 50% would be better without overpowering it
---
OH GOLLY
---
Hello. Apprehensive is the word you want. &lt;3
---
That I couldn't tell you, I do not pay attention to trophies.
---
 What I can tell you is I have done every single thing in the game solo except the final boss/mission.
---
YEA ITS SUCKS ASS
---
Bethesda eh
---
Yeah mate there is a few. Although there are some kiwis that tag along so bare with them :p
---
Is it possible to get it as a drop for killing the imposter sheepsquatch?
---
Just tell them to go to the Mayor's office instead.  Those spawn 10 stims per person.
---
lol Troubleshooter's Spear for your trouble
---
WOO YEAH SADNESS
---
I chain "no" plus "heart" emote, like "no, but thanks love", when someone tries to donate me his 1000 units of wood
---
And in the case of trading, i just emote "no", it's just business vibe.
---
will do.. I will logon in 5 min
---
They should consider mods on camp equipment like Generators, turrets, etc.  Let me equip gauges, solar backups, battery backups to generators.  Let me equip solar panels to turrets (run without wired power during the day) and battery packs (allows for recharging and running overnight/bad weather).  
---
Better targeting mods, explosive rounds, ultracite rounds....
---
I don't want anyone to see the excessive amount of cat photos and commie propaganda on my walls
---
This is embarrassing.
---
High value junk should have a percentage drop imo. Similar to aid in survival.
---
Still punishing, but not completely unfair.
---
Don't cheat you won't be banned simple solution
---
*uses card to start event no-one knows how to activate the pylons* INTERNAL SCREAMS FROM HELL.
---
An odd suggestion, try the reflex dot scope rather than the traditional scope/recon scope. First benefit is there is no scoped sway, secondly, there is no delay to ADS in case of emergencies.
---
Once you are accustomed to long range shooting I don't see a big benefit to the extra magnification.
---
There’s blood leaf in the rivers, I went there yesterday.
---
x-01 calibrated shocks are also a rare spawn at the MODUS terminal. I think they are more common now though, I've seen 2-4 PA mods per server there ever since the update that added all recipes to vendors. Before then I remember coming in to MODUS not having any
---
I've met 2 griefers and countless cool people; I think the toxicity is very low in this game.
---
Armour is 100% superior, when imo it should be the other way around.
---
Annoying too as Chameleon is a prefix so I can't get all pieces also having Assassin's and Sentinel.
---
..will the paint work on Voice Of Set? 
---
(sorry if this has been asked)
---
I'd day the game has undoubtedly improved a LOT since launch but if you're brand new and looking to start, I'd honestly tell you wait a few weeks. 
---
Reason being they're releasing some pretty MAJOR overhauls to things and as usual with Bethesda games it's almost always two steps forward and one step back, and this last patch broke stuff and I'm sure that the player vending patch will have something game breaking as well. 
---
Once these major summer patch bugs get worked out, I'd say you're entering into an entirely different game then most of us who have been here since beta
---
Dont know about fo76. But discount product keys are really nice for pc. Picked up numerous games for a fraction of the cost this way.
---
You cheated... you got banned... and now you're crawling back and begging for Bethesda to let you play..... dude have some self respect, seriously.
---
&gt; Players have multiple mule account simply for savings accounts. 
---
Must be nice. I have to grind weapons to sell to vendors to get max every day, and mostly right now am using to buy shitty combat armor to scrap and try to learn plans. When I'm not grinding plastic to feed my very hungry shotguns.
---
Why just let you remove items from your inventory? Why not completely wipe it clean if you want back in the game.
---
I like to put on the witch faschnact mask and garb of mysteries, and stand on top of buildings and throw pumpkin grenades at anybody that walks by.
---
i am like level 173 right now, but I remember being in white springs killing ghouls and there was another player there -- we instinctively just split up the territory and didnt step on each other toes.
---
I am killing a few and I see him sprinting at me at full speed.  He emojis to me to come to him while he is running at me.  The dude brought a 3 star bloated legendary to me just to tag.  I will never forget that guy for doing that.
---
Ever since then, I never don't help people.  If I find 3 star armor and weapons, I find a lower level person to give it to.  I will fast travel to them, drop it and make sure they see it then just wave and take off.
---
It's a great feeling.  also .. always wave hi to people.  It makes a huge difference in your attitude while playing.
---
Do a silo run for mobs, plenty in there.   You will actually complain about too many.
---
For Bullets, just go ore mining with excavator.  You can craft 2k bullets in about 20 mins easily.
---
But what does it taste like?
---
Yeah and on at all hours I guess I’m not the only one doing shift work
---
Better yet should delete all characters related to those accounts if they let dupers back in.
---
I'll take it off your hands, all I have is boiled leather.
---
You can stack cha for a cheaper buy. With my unyieldings and grape mentats. I get mine gor 1790
---
1 cap = 1 unit tho. Economically you can't generate interest, deposit and withdraw. By turning it into a large scale pyramid scheme, you'll just create a house of cards that will crumble into a US like great depression. The value cannot systematically increase, it can only be perceived as increasing and decreasing. The only way to "fix the economy" is to address how caps are generated and destroyed. Depending on how it's scaled will impact player buying behavior. Usually if they're generated higher than they're destroyed prices drop. If they're destroyed faster than they're generated, prices rise. You need a balance and I think the only true gauge for it is by watching the price of a common consumable that is somewhat hard to get. I watch serum prices. 
---
But we should be able to carry more caps and store them if we want, like a capstash. It'll probably impact player buying short term.
---
People have an opportunity to learn from their mistakes by accepting the consequences of their actions. In this case, the consequence is a ban. 
---
The ban shouldn't be lifted simply because it's been "x" amount of days and or you feel like you've been in time-out long enough.
---
As far as I am concerned, the community is better off without the likes of you polluting it.
---
I actually really like wood armor.  Due to its subpar damage resistance, it’s great for the Berserker’s legendary rifles I have.  Once you get shrouded (I earned it somewhere, somehow) you get extra stealth bonus.  And it’s weighs next to nothing.  My almost-complete set of Vanguard weighs less than 2 pounds, and the chest pieces I use with it weighs less than a pound up to 3.5 pounds so overall under 5 pounds of armor.
---
It would be nice to have secondary perks on the pieces (such as decreased ammo/food/weapon weight) and of course Sentinel (I have a few Assassin’s pieces - I keep all the wood armor I find).  There are times I don’t even use the Chameleon pieces I have just to see if I can blend in with the environment for PVP (let’s face it...if they can kill me in power armor, wearing wood armor is just the same).
---
Like it or not, I’ll be the guy rocking the ghillie suit looking for bounties to cash in on and living out a survivalist role play.
---
I'm lvl 58ish and have enough caps to drop the 30if I want to, but oftentimes I'll take the long route because you find some cool stuff (and if you're lucky some ballistic fiber and lead) and some beautiful views.
---
This post was more around when I was low level and how frustrated I'd be that I was in the top left corner, and someone dropped a nuke on Whitesprings and I couldn't afford to fast travel for the XP, lol.
---
Now I make sure to always accept team invites if the person is low level, so they can avoid the fast travel cost.
---
Thank  you +karma
---
Hang out in the forest through about L18.  toxic valley 18-25, western edge of the devide into the low 30s.  Ash heap though 40.  Points east after that.
---
Follow the overseers quest line.  IT'll take you though generally level appropriate areas and enemies.
---
Parts of Roses quest (top of the world) will take you to areas you don't need to be at lower levels.  THe mysteries quest line is also a fun one, but will do the same thing.  
---
Be aware locations in the central and western divide and parts of the ash heap will have higher level enemies if a high level player has been around - if not, then the enemy level will be lower.  Server hop or come back later.
---
All points from the center of the dvide and east will have high level enemies.
---
fast travel is convenient, but you'll miss lots of stuff.  Walking helps the discovery process.
---
Most players, high level or otherwise, will try to help you.  
---
As you have unfortunately discovered, some are @$@hats.
---
When the game started i made my fortune farming raw flux, glowing blood, and crafting civil war outfits. On top of that i invested that money in all 19 mutation plans which are still paying off as i sell mutations to everyone. If you are a hungry businessman you can drum up funds in anyway. Find your market and squeeze!
---
Something definitely has to happen once the player vending machines go online. What happens to the caps if someone buys a gun from my machine for 2000 while I'm all maxed out with caps already?
---
It tastes like snozeberries.
---
had this happen at whitespring last night, then suddenly non legendary non diseased ghouls started dropping two separate legendary items per ghoul. i didnt want to ever leave that server
---
I also operate with the intentions of taking care of the lower leveled players.  You did good in this story and I agree with you.
---
Why not help out in some small way to make some gamers day better?  You already share a common love and thats fallout!
---
Queen of the hunt isn’t a new quest. It’s a daily. 😊
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Voice_of_Set 
---
It says here that the voice of set is a normal .44 pistol, so I would assume that it does works on that, but i'm not completely sure since I cannot check it in game, since I don't have the pistol anymore in game :(
---
I just started playing last week. Loving it so far.
---
You forgot these: ,.;:" 
---
Jokes aside, that's actually some decent loot. Haven't been that lucky so far :(
---
It’s the live updates server side, game servers and even file servers don’t like major changes to happen server side. Servers start to lag and get unstable especially for a game.
---
edit: I have to be honest.. I'm kind of retarted... and the fact is.. We don't have Sprite Cranberry in Australia either. Lol
---
Lesser of 2 irritances I guess?
---
I hope the bans won't be reverted. The game doesn't need cheaters back, its better off without you. The ban is how you learn from your mistake - you cheated and were banned, bet you won't do that again.
---
..how about we lift the bans, but in recompense the individuals are forced to follow and mule for a level 1, fresh outta the vault rookie for one week, weaponless, with only the thumbs up and heart emotes available, and no mic..
---
Yeah I realize I’ve only been pacifying, I haven’t tamed anything yet. I’ll have to keep trying.
---
Its expensive. And many still cant complete it with a pub group. 
---
2500c for a chance to kill it and not doing so is a real kick in the teeth
---
Is raw flux still worth a ton? now that you don't have to vendor hop, that could be a pretty  nice way to get caps.
---
well, thank you guys for the responses, I see the game is still as divisive as ever
---
Secretly the gunners are trying to get some honest pay so they're using the radio station to broadcast old shows ._|
---
I feel ashamed for you
---
How doesn't a picture of the real life vehicle that is also in the game not count as something to do with fallout 76? I mean I've seen tons of people post pictures of just random places in West Virginia. How is this any different?
---
This is why I was kind of reluctant to nuke it. I’ve done nuked Harpers ferry and the respawn times are abysmal. I can’t see the nuked burrows being fun with the whole server crammed down there.
---
The card only cost 1700 for me with hard bargain and herd mentality but still ig it's just too much for everyone
---
Same here just finished the ranking quest in the bunker only went out of my way to kill SB for the commendation. Now i just go around them when i can or help lower guys in trouble.
---
you have to decide which aspect benefits you the most - high rad resistance, high DR, or carry weight.
---
In WS, there are so many critters that drop so much stuff, I opted for carry wieght.  Loot it all, sort it out later.
---
Excavator for me.
---
The ISS?
---
Negative posts get the upvotes. I'm glad you enjoy the game.
---
Yeah. When they got rid of respawns for when a new player enters an area, it closed an exploit, but also makes it way more likely that nuke zones are empty and boring. 
---
The game needs much faster respawns in nuke zones. It’s immersion-breaking and anticlimactic to be sitting around waiting.
---
Yeah, I get mine down to 1790c. Pretty sure 2500 is its base value from vendors though.
---
imposter sheepsquatch.
---
&gt;They said the more stars means the better chance of getting the weapon of your dreams
---
I mean, it could be 50 tokens to do a full random re-roll that is literally just "random new legendary item" and that statement holds true.
---
More stars on item = more tokens, which is a bigger step towards (another) re-roll, and (eventually) getting your dream item.
---
3 Star items giving 3 tokens rather than 1 would by default make them a "better chance" with ANY system they implement.
---
Semantics are a bitch.
---
Yea after going on the wire (highly recommended) I don't experience things like this anymore. Made a world of a difference. Do your self a favor and run an ethernet cable, wifi for gaming blows imo.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
only rank 1's for riflemen?
---
For the love of Gary, someone needs to just sit down with the facial software and painstakingly recreate his face.  Is his hairstyle even an option?
---
Nope.
---
I currently have Instigating Quad The Dragon.  Its nice for those two insist on using TSE for Legendary Mobs.
---
It used to be but they patched it. You can get 5 caps for scrap ultracite if you mine it. I have alot of savings so now i just sell weapons, armor, and mutations. Oh and every now and then i mod power armor for people. Knowledge is power in this game. If you can build something others cant, your skills are valuable.
---
Ah I didn't mean to come off like that. Just trying to be helpful and get people to stop wasting limited items when they will not have an effect.
---
Playing FO3 and just finding that vault was enough "Gary" for a life-time.
---
I'm ot a fan of cheaters, but they paid money for a product only to have that product remotely deactivated.  There are hundreds of other products where if this happened, people would be losing their crap.
---
Don't like official kcups in your Keurig so you work around it...BANNED!
---
Did you just refill your printer ink cartridge instead of buying a new one...BANNED!
---
You didn't just install an aftermarket mod on your car did you....BANNED!
---
You want to be mad at someone, sure be mad at the cheaters -and- be mad at the poor software development that enabled the exploit.
---
But don't pretend that a banning with two months of radio silence is an acceptable business practice.
---
I calls it how I sees it. Unless FO76 are just such blatant idiots they wanna cover up bugs and glitches too? r/fo76 is the only game reddit i follow where bugs get downvoted.
---
I wonder why the quest popped maybe just a bug
---
Thats a good point...
---
Nope but the challenges for it sure are. 😥
---
Literally me yesterday
---
proof, got any?
---
That was excellent.  What's the stats on the .50?  If you're wearing excavator, that's even more impressive.  (skinned ultracite?)
---
The stim-spam in power armor is incredibly beneficial.  Since all my armor is geared towards stealth, I usually just take the pylons, jump on the shack roof and focus on trash while using stims with chem fiend/field surgeon/first aid and just shoot at the impostor with sneak attacks and vats crits when I can see it.  If the PUG is really bad, I'll dig into my quantums and light it up with sneak attack and perk boosted vats crits.  Usually there's at least 1-2 other players involved that can carry their own weight, so I just keep the gutsies off them for the most part.  
---
It's pretty rare that I ever leave the roof to hurry the event along.  She's a bad bitch if she hits you, which is why I stay on the roof, but not nearly as durable as the SBQ.  You can utilize terrain to block the death beam, which the OP is clearly aware of.  A couple other hard hitters make pretty quick work of the event without having to blow through most of my ammo like I do during SBQ.
---
Great job.  That was very entertaining.
---
Just used it, now I feel even ruder lol. I’d prefer “no thanks” than “no way!”
---
..forget it until we get pineapples.
---
Wood armor has some of the best energy resist in the game the low damage resist is what balances it   
---
Along with the camouflage it offers it might be good for a stealth beserk build
---
That's true, but then you are spending your time marketing, following up, waiting for people to log on.. No doubt profitable, but, I prefer spending my time playing doing as much fun stuff as possible. Then again, having more caps takes stress off and makes stuff fun. 
---
For now, clearing high level areas and selling guns works okay (and can give me scrap too). I wish enemies dropped armor in addition to weapons. If scortched or supermutants dropped combat armor it would be a game changer.
---
I'm also wanting to know if they fixed this or not
---
Its just a bug. They rolled out the daily quests before the camera it would seem. Its been a problem since the burrows at least.
---
Yes bathesda if you come across this post please fix fuel crafting. Its broken we need more fuel, for us that enjoy the flamer, the fuel struggle is real.
---
Plus that seventh white wolf fedora isn’t worth it
---
I'm assuming worst case scenario.
---
* Stars == number of tokens you get for destroying the item.
---
* Some number of stars allows you to generate a random item.
---
Basically like the slot machines in Borderlands but with tokens from legendaries instead of normal currency.
---
I'm assuming you have no control besides weapon or armor.
---
MAYBE paying some increased # of tokens for guaranteed 2* or 3* items, but still effectively a completely random item.
---
So in order to get your "dream item" it's just another wave of RNG. And technically "more tokens" give you a better chance of getting that item (eventually).
---
Is this item still available?
---
PvP is buggy as hell all the time, what do you mean?
---
Fucking Raiders.
---
Wow. That is, excuse my french, super shitty. Did they at least announce they were going to do this out loud or was it by stealth?
---
Damn true I want so bad to use it but there’s just no use for it xD
---
I tried it a few times and forgot I had 1200 acid on me at that time. So greatful everyone was focused on the event and didnt grab it.
---
I wish it wasn't useless. The aesthetic of it is neat, but you can't craft it and as far as I'm aware there are no mods for it. If it was brought up to par with other armor sets at least on those two points I'd probably go out of my way to wear full wood armor just for the fun of it.
---
At the same time you are leaving a vault, a vault that would have had security. And since it seems like it wasn't a "testing vault", it would have a manufacturing area, so in theory you would have access to Vault tech security armor pieces. Even if you level capped said armor
---
One showed up within the Atomic Shop, like you've said. Keep an eye on that area another may also.
---
One run through lucky hole mine with excavator power armor gets you about 250 lead ore which is worth around 625 lead without super duper. Equip scrapper and kill mass amounts of super mutants and mole miners for shotguns, assault rifles and missile launchers. Assault rifles and missile launchers scrap for 20 steel each with scrapper and 8 intelligence. 25 per minigun. You can get thousands in a fairly short amount of time this way. I don’t even use intelligence boosters like chems etc. Garrahan headquarters, where you do the excavator power armor quest, is a decent place to do this.
---
I'm all for this solution.  Wipe all characters completely from all their accounts before enabling them.
---
Common wait time is over a month tbh..
---
&gt; That's true, but then you are spending your time marketing, following up, waiting for people to log on.. No doubt profitable, but, I prefer spending my time playing doing as much fun stuff as possible. Then again, having more caps takes stress off and makes stuff fun. 
---
Not really, once you get well known enough you don't have to do anything like that. People will just come to you knowing you are a high end trader and you end up not needing to do any kind of marketing to let people know you have items for trade.
---
OP can keep his shark. I'd happily shell out 1400 atoms for Atom Cats!
---
Why bother you can't fix stupid. Also I'm playing 76 so I don't have time to.
---
I have not sold it, might use it in a build, but you can still make a offer. It's also lvl 35.
---
Is this a poorly timed April fools joke?  I really hope it is.
---
What part are you stuck on?
---
I like trading genuinely. You never know what someone has or what you'll get! Ive made alot of money on these subreddits and also met alot of very cool people i play with now. I'm with you, i love clearing crowds of glowies for legendaries but making connections in this game can make you very successful also. Just a different aspect
---
PC is always populated but with high level 100+.
---
Your PC has to handle the game first to be worth it. There's no text chat system.
---
I freaking HATED liberators as a low level. I didn't discover Watoga until around level 38 or so. I remember crawling across the map to Harpers Ferry at level 12, that was a rather alarming slow crawl. 
---
Around level 35ish, I started making a point to go discover all of the railroad stations so I could travel better. 
---
If you got to Watoga though, I believe you want to hold off until lvl 50 to do the Mayor for the Day quest, so that the weapon you get is max level.
---
The Burrows spawn mechancis are the same as anywhere else, with one caveat - no global cooldown on respawning enemies there. It's good if you have a friend that can stay on the server, then you leave server / rejoin him. The ghouls will respawn and you can clear it out again. Alternatively, if you have a super computer or two consoles, you could park a second account on that server and just rejoin with your other account over and over. 
---
ALL spawns in the game work like this - when a person who has not been on the server loads into an area, the game loads mobs for them. The difference with other areas is that they are linked to a global respawn timer of about 5-10 minutes, so no matter how many times you reload, nothing new will spawn until that timer is up. The Burrows does not have that, and BGS specifically made it that way because they didn't want players to get there and everything was dead.
---
The crappy thing is that you can respawn an area, and others will just kill your spawns. 
---
Anyway, if you do a proper route through Whitesprings that clears 100% of the ghouls, it takes about 8-10 minutes (if you're really fast), and by the time you reload and restart the run, the global respawn timer will be reset, so you get fresh ghouls, and AFAIK, this is still far better exp / more ghouls in a run than The Burrows, because there are probably \~30 total ghouls in the various houses, on porches, on the golf course, etc., around Whitesprings, and another 25+ in the golf club. Easily 50+ ghouls killed in 8-10 minutes. The trick is getting everyone else to either leave or group up with you so you don't have to fight other people for the respawns you're making.
---
We have those! I never noticed and just did the math the old fashion, guess math can go to hell I got a device to tell me how much Im using now.
---
Yes, many of the other perks are more valuable.
---
here is the logic:
---
Rank 1 perk = 10% dmg
---
Rank 2 perk = 15% dmg
---
Rank 3 perk = 20% dmg
---
You are spending twice the cost for the same benefit for Rank 2 and Rank 3.
---
If you really want to spend 1 perk for 5% damage, get bloody mess.  It gives the benefit to all weapons, not just rifles.
---
There are many perks in this game relating to criticals that are better than 5% damage.
---
Yes, you can solo everything in the game currently. they claim you won't be able to solo the new vaults they plan on opening up. But they claimed you couldn't solo sheepsquatch either, and people have been doing it since the day it came out.
---
google is your friend
---
I can reload and switch weapons while stooped down and I remain invisible. With the Chameleon Armor.
---
If you’ve done it before. Search for the soldiers letter. You should only need that on you to bypass it.
---
I found the plans for The fixer, and can craft a lev 50. On XboxOne.
---
Don't rule out future content, where the Nuka-Cola traveling robot sales team arrives in WV for a limited engagement.  (that's actually a good idea for a summertime event similar to Fasnacht)
---
A bunch of robots traveling the states hawking Nuka Cola, unaware of nuclear disaster or unable to stop due to their programming seems like something that would happen.
---
My legendary luck is also really poor. I have like 5 things chilling in my inventory for when the legendary vendor makes it's entrance, but... nothing really. My main only has like 2 legendary armor pieces and they are 1* or 2*. But, I haven't grinded (ground?) whitesprings very much. It's my fault, I don't have enough time to play enough to grind effectively. But thank goodness you folks are doing this for those of us who can't.
---
How is the ps4 more convenient? PC is far more convenient due to the mods out for it, and you can use a controller on the PC if you prefer controllers(I've got an xbone controller on my PC).
---
True, still had a problem now with complex blueprints with that problem and noticed most just get everything on one foundation because of it.
---
Bethesda are unresponsive af, theyve obviously seen this thread at least once
---
Damnit, now I want pizza.
---
Most people have done it once.  After that there's not much incentive to pay 2000 caps for an event where a lot of people don't activate pylons and I end up wasting tons of stims.
---
Barrier of entry is just too high for no reward
---
Lmao good for you buddy hope that handmade doesn't break on you any time soon. ;p
---
Text chat is the biggest reason why PC is better than other systems.
---
Even if you can sneak behind a player and explode yourself like a sucide super mutant?
---
unfortunately you don't seem to be.  You must work in IT.  (joking...mostly)
---
Pretty sure he's getting downvoted by upset morons, but okay. Saying "Hey, you shouldn't do that because it literally does nothing" is not "telling everyone what to do and how to play".   
---
I'm sure you were a great and valued team member throwing hand grenades at an invulnerable enemy while you got carried through the event, though.
---
Oh, okay.
---
Still waiting..
---
Yeah, I based this more on Path of Exile’s approach, where players have some choices to direct the RNG system. You’re probably right though. It’s likely full lotto.
---
Good job man
---
I wonder what it's like to be the kind of man that feels the need to tell someone that they're downvoting them.   
---
I feel kind of sick just imagining it.
---
About the watoga bots: when you finish a questline called “the mayor of watoga” or “mayor for a day” something like that, the robots are friendly to you
---
We get it, you watched an Oxhorn video.

Glowing mushroom

My stuff is locked to keep the scorched and mutants out. I've had the occasion to show up when they are whacking away at my stuff.

I would have just kept blowing it up and had my mate pop me to clear the bounty. Turret bases are going to suck when pacifist applies to camps.

Anyone with a turret camp behind the golf course is a douche and deserves to be nuked

Software developer here. Updooted for truth.

Hippity Hoppity, get off my property.

Why? It's only slightly radioactive.

Yeah, my thought is: if I'm wrong, it can hopefully only be better than my assumption. And if I'm right, it's still just extra chances I otherwise wouldn't have.

This has been how external and internal cells work since fallout 3, there isn't anything new about it technically. ;-)

they create a door (or in this case a manhole) and link that to a seperate map.

Ok, Bethesda support does not respond on weekends so if you support your ticket on a weekend send it again today.

---
You haven't noticed times where you switch weapons and nearby enemies instantly put you in either caution or danger? This happens to me daily and I have 21 agi and 5 pieces of chameleon armor.
---
The wood armor has better damage resistance than leather armor. Most enemies don't deal energy damage. Also, the wood armor is cheap to repair.
---
Oh no! The challenges are messed up for a whole week. Grab your torches and pitchforks folks!
---
I had this 3 star flamer and wanted to try it. Had around 1k fuel and thought this would be enough testing it .... 😝 lolz me ... 
---
All gone in a few seconds and the damage is pathetic.
---
It was sent in on Tuesday around noon est.
---
You probably didn't favorite it and sold it to the vendor.
---
Do you know if it works on Somerset Special?
---
A lot of people ignore the fact that thematically, it’s a cooperative game!! Vault dwellers who hurt other vault dwellers are the outliers (in terms of story). So happy you had a great experience— welcome to Appalachia! I hope to see you around!
---
I’m always super happy when I have positive co-op experiences like this! To be fair, sometimes it’s a mixed bag
---
Danger pops up whenever they're scanning for me. But I do try to keep my distance before the attack.
---
I like them ... binoculars have a lot of black area on screen but the peepers use more screen space I think. They also zoom in whereas I've never managed to make the regular bins zoom although some have said they do (XBox)
---
We need more people like this in the world
---
It feels fine because it's not that serious.
---
This. Blame is easier to Express than fault is.
---
The truth is, people don't like to be told what to do or what they doing wrong.
---
Most of the trolls are in survival mode. Stick to adventure and you'll have a pleasant experience with 99% of the playerbase.
---
How much are these explosive flamers worth? how rare are they? Are explosive cryolators legacy too?
---
Buy yourself a new license and don't cheat this time.
---
So why, in the RifleGaming video, does he say that as more people piled into the burrows, more and more ghouls spawned?
---
Hmmm. You say you want to join the Enclave, but you have Brotherhood flair....seems.....suspicious.
---
Taking a level 2 to Watoga. Bold move Cotton.
---
it does i bought this last time it was  a LIMITED TIME OFFER!
---
Sure, I don't mind not playing.  Refund the money.  The full price we paid for pre-order.
---
I get 3-5 Legendaries per run on normal burrows. Only once found nuked one and it did have more legendaries, but also more people killing them.
---
So I'd say it's has huge RNG on leges and some see none while others might see half dozen of them.
---
Seriously? Bypass? You are my new favorite person and will marry you, whoever you might be!  Thanks!
---
Yea do challenges. Death blossoms. Tea time. There’s one by graftin with mirelurks. The one at the lighthouse in the forest. Wolfs count as canines

Nope. Always favorite my equipment and rename to keep them at bottom. I had it before logging out and I didn't visit any vendors.

I would really like them to reduce the time it's takes to get the well rested/well tuned perk. I get it, I'm sleeping in a bed/playing a guitar, I don't need to sit there watching it everytime. I know it's short, but waiting for the load before and time taken, I actually don't do either of those things anymore when returning to camp, purely because it annoys me to waste that time, everytime I want to do it.
---
Not sure where in configuration it'd be on your particular router, but QoS stands for "Quality of Service". It'll allow you to prioritize certain types of traffic so that your kids streaming Peppa Pig won't interfere with your gaming. Port Forwards means (if you've got multiple computers or devices connected on your network) that all traffic in a certain range goes straight to your machine instead of being analyzed and routed by the router. Skipping that lookup shaves off time in getting packets to you.
---
lmao
---
Lol.
---
It's hard to go five feet in the mire without tripping over a clutch of gulpers, but I've had a hard time finding a good area for farming yaoi guais... Any ideas?
---
Except they announced it was a completely new engine that'll support the new ESO too.
---
I think it was a stealth nerf. 
---
While the old way limited how often solo players saw empty areas, it was OP for teams. Teams could have one party member leave the server and re-enter and all of Whitespring would respawn. You could get eight full clears off one nuke. There were piles and piles of legendaries (even if. 98% of the were trash).
---
What system? I wouldn’t mind buying mutations from ya
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah sure, np. Meanwhile, I leveled a new char to level 8 (and I’ve killed three higher levels, lol)
---
I love all you cheater apologists. It's really hilarious.
---
Fallout Fandom says its a normal .44 pistol, no western revolver, so I would assume that it would work on the Somerset Special, but I'm not sure since I don't have that gun anymore in game. :(
---
&gt;When they got rid of respawns for when a new player enters an area
---
When did this happen?  Initial reports seemed to show that respawns were happening, and there hasn't been a patch since then (not that a patch is absolutely needed for something like that).
---
I haven't seen anything announced about it.
---
Wait, I think there was item Nuka-ball back in closed beta? It was thrown grenade and looked like mininuke? Or was it a dream...
---
If you run into a team outside an event, and they get you,  you consistently have to respawn on your teams camp or v76, then port in a on a teammate or vice versa. After an event the option to respawn on a teammate is there intermittently. And respawn on a dead teammate that has respawned.
---
If you look at the armor it's not solid or sturdy looking. It's mostly bits and bark. So unless it's raining, you're swimming, or you've been belly crawling through the cranberry bog... You're a walking tinder box in this version of wood armor.
---
Punched?  I have shot, stabbed, electrocuted and nuked players there. It’s just part of the madness. As long as you are in Pacifist mode, people generally don’t care.
---
That would be so freakin' cool. Perhaps with the dlc "Wastelanders" we'll see Travelling robots from say the Capital Wasteland visits.. and brings with them exotic flavours of Nuka Cola.
---
This is a video game, not Bank of America lol. Your point about the serums is right on though. Even now with the pooling capacity of the vendor bots, the price of a serum has gone up a tad. I agree that capacity would greatly impact but trading one max cap amount for another just sets more of a short term obstacle rather than a long term fix. A bank account with no cap limit that assesses a service fee an excellent way to keep players actively spending. You cant at all say this would be like US banking because there is an infinite amount of caps that this game generates.
---
This game has by far one of the friendliest online communities I've seen. 
---
The stories about griefers...they exist, sure, but stories are overblown and I can't help but think that the people saying their base is destroyed/they are griefed constantly are just camped in a really stupid spot.
---
Lots of Violet and Crimson and a bit of Yellow Cake around Harper's Ferry and quite a few mobs to kill to get the materials needed to convert them. Not too bad.
---
If I could trade that little time out of your day to teach you how paint a portrait with oil paints or create a compelling logo (my skill sets), I would.  Thank you.
---
I'm trying with my new survival character...not there yet. Hair you can get close but not quite.
---
I'm glad you lost your milk money
---
Or, just don't get banned
---
Don’t get banned and you won’t have to worry about it.
---
You got the product, you just went against the terms of use.
---
Oh, and where would said letter be hanging out?
---
Why?
---
Coming soon*
---
*provided the world isn't nuked :P
---
Nope, I just hate anti-consumer practices more.  Just because you are playing video games doesn't mean its not a real-world crappy practice.
---
Perfect! I’m on Xbox as well, quick question, what’s the maximum amount of mutations one can have?
---
Honestly, the story and lore of this game are the best in the series, you just won’t have a living person telling it to you. Gameplay is great and the vats system works really well in real-time. If you loved and fallout or elder scrolls game you’ll adjust to the changes and fall in love all over again, as long as you can tolerate the bugs that are sometimes frustrating and sometimes hilarious
---
Thats like saying everyone who had guns taken away from them for shooting someone should have the money refunded
---
Pretty sure you can have all 19
---
Nah. I have a feeling that you take reddit very, very seriously. It's kind of like your personal Matrix. If you didn't feel that way, you wouldn't brandish downvoting like some kind of weapon that has any actual effect on anyone, at all, ever.
---
That isnt the reason. Its because they upped the sell price of them to the vendors. So now you can reliably sell them to a vendor for twice the standard going rate on the forums. Buyers will need to adjust to open the market back up.
---
It depends, what do you mean by "max"? Because if you end up with over 100k ultracite ammo you risk being banned as a duper even if you've never duped or broke any rules. 
---
Aside from ultracite ammo though, the only limit really is weight.
---
No, I have not completed it, argh. I can't manage to do it.
---
Music to me ears!....eyes? Anyways how much do you charge for each?
---
yep :D there are, in my experience MANY more helpful players than not. glad you enjoyed!
---
Ever want to play and be treated as if anyone else I'm ps4  Psn name: Boiker
---
Generally don't matter I just like to play and anyone is welcome to play with if they like.
---
YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH. That's like saying "enough ice cream for a life-time". Until **all** is Gary, there is no "enough" Gary.

I haven’t seen a camp there in a little while, but saw one the other night there.  I am all for blowing them up.

O.o
---
Thanks for the feedback on the sign, I'm going to bring this up for discussion in case there are improvements we can make.
---
Oh look, this thread again.
---
As least emote something. I found a T-51b jetpack plan that I've been trying to get rid off. Everyone I've found wearing t51-b won't stand still long enough for me to offer it. If anyone wants it, I'll sell for 2k caps (PC).
---
Was it renamed? I think i saw someone say it's a point in common for everyone who lost something.
---
Awsome
---
MVP dude. I've wanted something like this for a while. I'd love to see a "sustained DPS" number as well that takes into account fire rate and reload time over a 2 minute period. However, even without that info, I think I can definitely confirm that the .50 cal is the best sustained DPS weapon in the game.
---
In the bathroom? That’s a weird place for that. I usually leave mine the woods next to a lit fire near a sleeping bag that is flammable and next to a table that has the plans for a metal bed

200 caps a piece. Big drop off compared to what the vendors sell lol
---
Maybe you should have thought about that before you cheated....
---
The target range.  Haven't even tried the obstacle course yet.
---
That’s a completely reasonable price if you ask me
---
Thanks for the offer but on PC.
---
Nah, too gimmicky for my taste, but it *could* (rarely, mind you) capture stray transmissions from, say, MOTHERSHIP ZETA!
---
Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.  ;\^)
---
Downvotes mean I have a point right?
---
So everyone that cheated in university and got kicked out should get refunds too? You had your chance and you blew it.
---
Now I feel like I might have given Bethesda an idea for free that might have been worth a couple bucks worth of freelance brainstorming.  LOL
---
And thats why we need text chat and not blind trade inviting
---
That's definitely wrong.
---
Syringer debuffs stack? Meaning if I shoot the SBQ with ten shots of endangerol it's 10x better than shooting her once? I was told I only had to shoot her once per minute. But if shooting her more is better, I"ll do it
---
So are you willing to guess how many tokens for a new random? I did this publicly because I think it’ll be interesting to look back in a little over a month and see how close our guesses were. 
---
I’m also expecting casuals to think 20 tokens is a lot, while players with mules might already have 300 tokens-worth of trash stored up.
---
That is the job of her attorneys. Just remember that most violators such as sex offender, pedophiles, murderers, even insider traders or speed violators go to jail when there are videos &amp; recorded conversation. Imagine a recorded video with live voice over live chat - confirmed with logs from Bethesda's server. Good luck running away from that.
---
In my experience, luck matters:
---
* First 100 hours in game, luck at 4 &gt; Never got explosive or Two Shot or Medics
---
* Changed character (level 85ish) to focus more into luck for crits
---
* Around 8-9 luck, started getting a couple Explosive dropping
---
* Around 10-12 luck, got about 5 medics in a single day
---
* Around 13-14 Luck, I got a Quad The Dragon, and Another two shot.
---
So between 1-85, never got anything good.  After raising luck, I got about 10-12 good items in about half the time.
---
Always keep a fatman handy just for those guys
---
Seems pretty cool, but slightly rng based.
---
I try to keep it modest. Which ones did you want?
---
Or alternatively ask them what is going on and please fix it or at least apologize that it can’t be fixed, even better, do a small thing to make up for it. Would cost them literally nothing to offer a few free atoms as an apology if they can’t fix it. Oh no,how dare we criticize how something is being handled or even ask them to do something about it. It’s not like we paid for this game or that they are trying to get us to pay more money into this game. They’re making this game out of the goodness of their own hearts, right?
---
could you also share a link to this other post mentioned? Me too I'm curious. As of today, around 550 hrs, I only found Bos combat arms. The funny thing is that I dont even remember how I ended up with the plan in my inventory.
---
Thanks
---
What fixed it for me, is I completely unplugged my Xbox as I found out it was just not letting me load into interior cells.
---
Have you ever seen 3* wood armor? I feel like I have but also could have been a dream...
---
There is just many good stealth-crit perks and its often a better choice to go with the others.  Tormentor is especially good because it gives you defense in PVE (mobs will walk slowly to you and wont be able to reach you).
---
There is also a Strength perk called "Blocker", it reduces melee dmg toward you by a good amount.   Snipes usually dont get in melee range, but this is for those uncommon instances where you want to go inside places like Burrows or buildings.
---
I have heard about Serendipity luck perk is good as well.
---
Not a single robot spawned the entire 17 runs??
---
Mostly what I’ve found, on PC anyways, is the the bad people who want to ruin your tome are the “unicorns”, but when they do come through they leave a lasting impression, as a unicorn would but in a negative way. I know personally my group of friends that play just give new players a ton of extra items when we run into them.
---
Also, are you just gonna post these dumbass threads all day because you're upset you broke the rules and received consequences?
---
The spawns are not tied to any number of players. its not "theres five players so 5x ghouls", its whenever a player enters, spawn ghouls. there is a short window where if players enter too close to one another that they are basically counted as the same player and only get the one spawn of ghouls.
---
this is great idea. 
---
and they're black &amp; white, so the video files can be heavily compressed.
---
Diseased don't count. I assume your including them?
---
No problem. I figured an honest question deserves a straightforward answer. u/c-137_MrMeeSeeks' advice is excellent and accurate, but assumes a level of knowledge many players don't have.
---
Does carnivore work with the cannibal perk?
---
*Following total atomic Annihilation*
---
So here's the thing - when you set off a nuke, you basically have  to SPRINT in to make sure your ONE SPAWN isn't annihilated by other idiots. But when I SPRINT IN to the Whitespring the game inevitably crashes and I get nothing anyway. And that's what happened here too, I took too long to get there and everything was gone. Just utter BS really. 
---
So what you're saying is if I go in and there's nothing there I should go back to my camp and curse quietly for ten minutes and then go back. I considered that...
---
&gt;How is that in ESO I can have top build and I still have a challenge? If "god" build is so OP, then f#cking nerf it. 
---
ESO is 5 years old; FO76 is 5 *months* old. The average player hasn't put in 1500 hours and collected all of the 1-in-5,000-drop-rate items yet. Give them a chance to catch up.
---
&gt;If first dungeon raid were impossible, I would want to play it even more and would be eagerly waiting next one even more. 
---
I forgot games these days aren't considered "fun" unless you die 50 times trying to kill 1 enemy. Personally, I like games that are possible to beat with a reasonable amount of experience.
---
There's another reference to Nuka Cola Cranberry on a terminal, some note to another person that says something like "One word: Nuka-Cola Cran. Trust me" something like that.
---
I'm no expert on in game economy in the slighest but even I can tell you it was worth a lot more than that, sorry.
---
r/DumbassPostOfTheDay
---
You broke the terms of service, why do you think you somehow deserve a refund. Get bent.
---
You might want to research that, i am not 100%. I only run certain ones and carnivore isnt one of them.
---
Dodgy under agility is good for the Bloody PA build as well, and MedX since it gives actual reduction instead of DR like psycho variants.
---
If you can get Empath on you then PA is actually PvP viable at that point, especially since people don't expect it to be even close to good. You even get Pain Train as yet another stagger effect to fuck up their Sentinel with.
---
The last update introduced a bug that takes away the ability to mod anything.. it’s a pretty bad bug this game is all about modding. Can’t believe it doesn’t  warrant a hot fix.
---
I kinda figured that was a no-brainer for the terminal. Was really disappointed to see how little it actually does.
---
Yep.  That is why those single foot camps exist really.  People take their favorite spot, they can relocate it somewhere else easily instead of server hopping 5 times to be able to put their camp back down.  
---
I for one experience this on a daily basis because my camp is shaped around terrain and I do not want to spend forever building it again.  I don't like look of the single foundation camps so I prefer to make it more appealing visually.   But the single foundation thing will allow you to build your initial build in more diverse places.  Wont help the move camp part though.
---
it takes forever the areas to load. I'll run by power armor stations at camp to see them empty only for me to kill enemies and 40 seconds later a power armor pops up.
---
Well, the stash increase is nice for collecting stuff. I think they should have implemented an upgrade system, or even made items such as junk or ammo weigh less. I like features such as mutations and weapon condition, but they could have done something abit more "refreshing" with the storage.
---
Think Bethesda wanted to expand the stash even further...
---
You went to the end of burrows when we fight robots first time for the quest? Gutsies are respawning there as well and at least one can be a 3 star.
---
i have a tse cryolater and a tse tesla. Holding onto those bad boys and see how much I can get one day... or what I can trade for
---
Look through OP's post history, all he does is piss and moan about how it's unfair that he faced consequences for his actions.
---
That's a great joke!
---
I've read that you can just go punch all the targets if you're having trouble shooting them.
---
Thanks for the reports! I'll bring this up with the team so we can investigate.
---
I follow a few simple rules : Always wave hello, always deposit plans, recipes, chems, and gears I don't need at the Overseers camp, always try to give noobs what I can spare.
---
I've met my fair share of morrons but 95% of the time people are great.
---
Yeh I know where they are, Just saying that in  17 runs on 2 separate servers they never spawned for us.
---
Damn good to know, thanks
---
10,000x this. You can make a "door" out of any object and make it lead anywhere you mind can imagine. (as long as it's been made first) So, this new format is... well how the game has worked since fallout 3.
---
If 25000 caps can buy me 500 tokens, each token is only 50 caps not 500. Each roll cost 10-20 tokens so my current balance allows me to easily reroll 25-50 times. There aren’t that many effects to choose from, if I’m lucky i can reroll my ‘40 more bash damage’ into ‘bullet explode for area damage’ in a few tries. Especially I have a bunch of Legendaries that have good 1st effect, all I need is a nice 2rd or 3rd effect to complete it. 
---
Using caps to buy tokens makes it way too easy and it’s different than what they’re saying. What they said is legendary for tokens and tokens for reroll Legendaries. If all is measured with caps, you don’t need Legendaries, my three star grog axe only worth a few caps at vendor bot, I’d collect junk and costumes instead. 
---
Garbage legendaries for tokens, then tokens for rerolling our legendaries, that seems to be what they’re saying and it makes sense. Caps are way too easy to acquire, three-star stuff is harder, and god tier three star is the ultimate goal which is the hardest to get.
---
Oh, ok I hope they fix this or that t out can at least get a new one then
---
morningwood0917 getting an erection from helping new players.

---
 &gt; Thanks for the reports! I'll bring this up with the team so we can investigate.
---
Because he doesn't know better most likely. I don't watch Rifle Gaming. I've heard the name before. I run two accounts and I can 100% confirm that players in the area does not affect spawns or spawn rate. Whitesprings for example, has VERY specific spawn points. I've run it thousands of times, and I know exactly where every ghoul spawns, with the exception of the golf club, because that's a crazy clusterfuck of ghouls, but they do have specific spawn locations.
---
Something else you'll notice - the servers crap themselves if there's too much loot / too many players in an area, and this can also prevent spawns. Leaving meat piles on the ground with loot on them can bog the server down to where it won't respawn stuff. This isn't a mechanic so much as a limitation on the server - it's probably hitting max RAM.
---
Or played Fallout 3? Wtf is this comment
---
I don't know, for simplicity sake, 10 for a 1 star, 20 for a chance of 2 star, 30 for a chance of 3 star, and maybe like 40 and 60 for guaranteed 2 and 3 stars, though that might be getting a bit complex.
---
As you mentioned, difficult balancing between casuals who may never use it, vs the hardcore legendary farmers who have been waiting for this.
---
I have, last I checked, 1100 "stars" worth of legendary items on a mule account lol.
---
My explosive flamer says otherwise. It's like a silenced minigun with insane range and burn damage....
---
Laughable
---
I bought cards, spent about 6000 caps in the last 24 hours, started 3 (last night and 2 today) and every one of them froze the game while I was in the respawn loading screen. Had to quit out. They felt really buggy and it was like fighting in a tub of treacle, I’ve also had them where the Sheepsquatch is visible but takes no damage and where all pylons are activated and the Sheepsquatch is invisible for the entire event and not taking damage even though it says it is vulnerable, I’ve wasted about 10000 caps in total and the 2 events that I actually completed were other peoples so I’m probably going to throw in the towel with it. I’ve sent a support ticket in so hopefully they see it and can do something to improve the performance of the event.
---
Well I couldn’t find anything really conclusive about it so I might hold off on that purchase. And if I do find anything on it then I’ll purchase it from you in the future. I would like the healing factor mutation, marsupial and speed demon. So that’s, 600 caps.
---
PS4? Were they a melee build probably rocking the civil war dress or swimsuit? If so, this might have been me. I remember that exact situation. If not, I'm glad others like to play like this too. It's like a real life karma mechanic. :)
---
Day 2 had some bugs right after reset. Second egg wouldn't show up.
---
Do Swarm of Suitors in the pioneer scout camp in toxic valley for Mirelurks. It’s a fairly common event. I know for a fact 2-3 bloodbugs spawn at point pleasant so you could server hop. Tea time has insects also. As for wolfs just explore ash heap and savage divide.
---
And I can't do that cause the "hacked terminals" trophy is broken for me....
---
I think this week I'm gonna try on another character to unlock it, to see if it's still broken on another character
---
A third grader could do that, and I'm not talking from the douchey programmer perspective, I barely know anything about that, but you can do anything with google
---
I've done it all... twice with two different characters. Where are you hung up?
---
Same for me, try on another character maybe it'll work
---
That's actually insane the loss ratio even if you did get something worth it
---
I'd be happy if they added glowing mass/hardened mass/highly irradiated fluids so I can keep a steady supply of flux making materials on hand. If the damn things are going to commit suicide against me every time they see me, I might as well get something I need.
---
Damn
---
Yes please
---
God dammit, I forgot to make fun of these threads, too.   
---
Oh well.
---
No problem! How about scaly skin? Thats a popular one and i have a few crafted. Actually found a few good spots that have coal deposits!
---
We are talking about recipes not serums themselves.
---
I’ve never seen pumpkin grenades. How do I make them? Where do I find them?
---
He's trying to let you know what a genius he is.  If you have an ISP modem, the stuff he's telling you to do is probably already done.
---
It depends..my ghoul slayer is 30% damage to ghouls..10% extra damage while aiming 60% extra to glowing ones..I have covert operative card maxed so that's like2.5 and 3.5 x damage while sneaking..and I also have tormentor maxed..I bought it specifically for whitespring
---
As of now it's not be confirmed
---
The Whitespring nuke zone is a disaster..... LOL
---
Nobody understands how the respawn mechanics works. It's so annoying to watch 4 groups of players spread out running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
---
I don't even bother. It's just a waste of time going there these days. I usually wait until the rads clear and sneak in so that nobody knows I'm there and I can get in a full run without anyone stealing my spawns.
---
Grow up and take your own advice then.
---
Good lord...
---
To be fair, this happens all the time to me at the Whitespring.  I kinda wish the enemy spawn instancing was very small, so you have to be within a short distance of the area for it to re-populate enemies.  If I'm on a server with friends and "that guy" is also on the server, they just go through with their instigating super sledge and mash 50% of the spawns immediately.
---
I feel like a nuke launch on anything but Fissure Prime is basically putting a big poster on the map that tells the whole server "hey, come steal all my loot".
---
Having private or invite only servers is something that needs to happen at some point.  I'd pay like $10 a month to maintain my own little private instance that was password locked, only open to players on my friend's list, or was limited to four players.  Having to share a server with people that apparently missed pre-school social lessons is probably my biggest annoyance with the game.
---
I was under the impression that the classical music station in 76 was the same as the one in 4, and thus was being broadcast by the Institute?
---
It happened to my armor once and a explosive hand gun.
---
Thanks, [jaj22](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bemnww/weapon_damage_calculator_and_comparator_webpage/el76rfe/) posted some fresh values from the game files. Maybe you have buffs that turn 43 into 49.
---
&gt; Sustained damage
---
It complicates a lot of things and I know even less about time calculations affecting DPS. Maybe one day.
---
&gt; HMR armor pierce receivers
---
Not sure what you mean, the Submachine Gun has an armor-piercing barrel. I did not hear about AP bug.
---
&gt; I'll try to get you some raw data
---
That would be great, I don't even have the plans for most weapons.
---
Hmmm I’ll pass on that.
---
I looked for this option on PS4 7nder game and I don't have a toggle for it.
---
Just don’t cheat it’s very simple
---
Nah, unless you leave the server and rejoin, they won't respawn for ~30 minutes. AFAIK 30 minutes is the "natural" respawn timer. To reset them before that you need to leave and rejoin the same server. This should work indefinitely with no respawn cooldown for The Burrows. Other areas have a 5-10 minute global respawn timer where, even if a new player joins the server at that area, they still won't respawn. They did this because their servers can't handle constant respawning in areas like Whitesprings from groups that would constantly reload the golf club and farm thousands of ghouls in 10-15 minutes.
---
I can get him down to 17500 with a 25 charisma, 3 ranks of HB and grape mentats.  Then when you sell 1400 caps worth of crap back to him, you only spent 16,100.
---
F
---
Ok i should be online around 4pm est. Would that work for you?
---
Keeping cheaters out permanetly isnt anti consumer.
---
Are you mentally ill?
---
If your'e going for mainly PvE, I've found that once you get yourself a moderately end game weapon (I have a 1-star instigating sniper), sneak attack will one shot just about everything 'normal' without maxing out all the rifle perks.
---
I went full bore rifleman (all 9 points) and was doing fine, and then I found a 3-star AAE shotty.  I moved a lot of points into shotgun skills to test it out, but found that I was still one shotting normal mobs from sneak, without even needing a head shot.  Now I leave most of the shotgun perks on and still do all the same farming I did before, but have a nice explosive backup.
---
For PvP, I'd probably put most of the rifle perks back on for extra damage because of the high damage mitigation armor/perks.  But I don't PvP, so you'd probably be best to find someone who does if you're going that route.
---
Once you get a bit higher, and can reasonably survive on your own throughout the wasteland, I'd highly recommend not fast traveling as often.
---
I had been fast traveling everywhere, but decided to start raiding weapon-heavy areas for caps. Got encumbered with rifles and had to march back to Whitesprings in my excavator armor. Had like 5 or 6 random encounters that made it feel like a genuine journey instead of just a waste of time.
---
I bought one before I had completed the quest thinking I could do it twice, and not only did we fail to kill the dang squatch, it ate my 2000c card.
---
Not doing it again.
---
I believe so yes
---
You can read more about it from terminal in watoga sunken depot. (yes, looks like we'll see it in the future)
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Frankly I come here for the irrational screeching. It helps keep perspective on what's actual important in life.
---
Only sometimes.
---
This isn't one of those times. So don't tell yourself it is.
---
My group observed the change on April 7th. I don’t know when they made the change. It was before patch 8 (April 9).
---
insects and dogs at the teapot challenge.  
---
Mirelucks in the wendigo cave.
---
Best they'd give you is 500 Atoms.. :p LOL
---
Nice job, I've wanted to see this event soloed ever since it came out.
---
Misc quest to talk to Jack at pumpkin house. He gives you seeds to craft them afterwards
---
There is absolutely zero end game of any kind whatsoever, but I still manage to enjoy myself. Over 500 hours in now, and there are folks who have played a lot longer than I have.   
---
If you like it, you'll like it. A LOT of the bugs and issues from launch have been addressed, and while it's still not a bug free experience by any stretch of the imagination, I can't remember the last time I encountered a bug that REALLY adversely affected me in some way.
---
I got very lucky and someone had vendored a lvl 50. I snatched that thing up. I wonder if someone could make a business of just selling lvl 50 version of all the quest weapons and armor.
---
I rather have a delayed camera than a bunch of bugs with a realese
---
It's the gun range that's the problem
---
I count on number of legendary items I get. Not what it says or doesn't say on mob's name.
---
I didn’t know they make the target take increased damage. Gonna be crafting up a bunch of these for my next run at the event. Good tip!
---
A lot of people will pay decent caps for the clean helmet and clean spacesuit.  They are harder to find in game. Yeah, you definitely cheated yourself. 😥 some of the more rare outfits like the clean spacesuit,  hunters long coat and any of the asylum outfits that are not white(forest,brown,blue,red and pink) can get you a lot of caps if you sell them
---
That will happen....never.
---
if you were legitimately banned, you were banned for a reason. No refunds.
---
Maybe,  but since most of Appalachia is already automated some Radio stations could be automated too. 
---
And even if the Institute broadcasts Classical Music something must be broadcasting Radio Appalachia.
---
They cheated by exploiting a buggy product.  They made no modifications to the product and just played within the product that was created for them.  They didn't use external software to give an advantage.
---
By all accounts that would be within a EULA.  If it isn't acceptable behavior then Bethesda shouldn't allow it.
---
Perfect ill let you know when im on!
---
They should always be legendary. 1 or 2 stars. That might help
---
So you come here to get some sort of validation via likes on your posts?
---
Thanks, I will. I was pointing this out because so many people edit their post and ask why they're getting so many downvotes. It's because of people like you :)
---
I would recommend you not complete that quest until after level 50 so you can get the best version of the quest reward.
---
Thx for assuming that i dont like F76. Can you go away now? Thank you.
---
That's exactly what I did, my mate left the team just before and earned himself some caps haha
---
&gt;  It's because of people like you :)
---
You poor wittle victim....

Grafton Steel has the plans as a random spawn. [Location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk&amp;t=42s)
---
I tried this method myself and have chest/legs now. Still trying to find arms.
---
Nope, just pointing out that there are other subreddits they can follow. So many people edit their posts to asking why they're getting downvotes for helping other people out. Just like this
---
I would tested for you but I wont be back to playing till monday
---
Inside whitesprings they are more expensive than the outlying train stations.
---
Hey! He had to post this because of people like **YOU** don'tcha know! Now shoo!
---
Urban scout armor should feel special. Maybe have the legendary versions only drop from enclave events.
---
When I finally got ghouls to spawn for me down there , they were glowing , but none of them dropped any flux conversion materials. So I went up top and farmed those enemies. My first attempt at nuking it no enemies spawned at all , two vault dwellers and myself walked the area over for about an hour before giving up, I switched servers , dropped another nuke. Finally ghouls, but they don't drop masses and fluids. For some reason I get a lot of lvl 35 -40 loot of from lvl 50-60 enemies. Has been this way a few weeks now.
---
If you violated the terms of service, which is a legally binding agreement that you consented to in order to play the game, then you have no right to any compensation. Something to that effect will be in said agreement.
---
Not a victim. Just trying to help people out :) 
---
Thanks again for proving my point :)
---
I need that  REEEEEE to align my Chi
---
For the shooting range it’s best to start on the left side and slowly walk right. 
---
For the obstacle course just get marsupial 
---
And finally for the patriotism it’s in the middle room. Talk to the intercom until he talks about his password and read the last entry
---
Yea, its not too hard to make a lot of cryo, but with the fire rate it has and the amount of rounds you need to land to apply the slowing effect, it's all kinda absurd. 
---
You can get an absolute ton of lead ore from the Lucky Hole Mine (hundreds of it), but it's also a good bit of raw crystal. Unfortunately though, raw crystal isn't cheap to process into crystal with how much acid it costs.
---
I'll keep an eye out, I haven't noticed getting 'respawned on' lately, though for me it's a bit rare.  Videos I've watched certainly seemed to show otherwise, but I wasn't looking at them for proof of this, so it's not 100%.
---
Uh...how about a toaster? Cuz that would be rad.
---
So you downvote every post that comes across this subreddit, even if it is helpful?
---
I agree. It should really  be free between train stations.
---
I guess I thought it was kinda funny. Went over like a wet fart.
---
No, it doesn’t exist yet.
---
Third-ed!
---
So clearly,  I just suck.  Looks like it's the 1,000,000,007th time for me!  Unless someone from Bethesda wants to just do me a solid and skip me past it?
---
You wanna farm yao guai then do the enclave event at Seneca Rick's visitor center . Whatever its called big explosion one where it does orbital strike. I did that one time and had to fight off at least a dozen high level yao guai. It was one of the hardest instances of common events I've ever had to do.
---
Or how bout alarms before nukes go off.
---
That's weird because my snozeberries also taste like snozeberries..
---
Anything to help! 😘
---
Just copied my comment in case it helps others.
---
They spawn in any location with blueprint plans (static or safes) in the Toxic valley or Savage divide. Apparently also Cranberry Bog but I can't confirm that.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
Grafton Steel.
---
Top of the World.
---
- It's best to server hop a static location to find one. 
---
- There are a few [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk&amp;t=2s) videos on the exact location. 
---
- People know of these locations so you may only get a ~30-50% success rate on a plan appearing.
---
- They used to be sold at vendors and that will be fixed for patch 9.
---
If anyone wants to **trade BOS Chest for Arm plan** (XB1) please let me know.
---
I would disagree with the above poster, damage is by far the the most important thing you can put points into, as 5% more damage is actually better than it sounds because more damage is also more psuedo-armor-pen. you should take all 9 in rifleman and 3 in bloody mess (especially since bloody mess is a different multiplier and actually gives more damage than it would seem). 
---
Tank killer is less damage per point than rank2/3 of rifleman, although you should still max it.
---
You do the same amount of damage maxing base damage perks and not taking any  situational damage perks, (crit dmg, sneak dmg, etc) as you do taking only situational and no base. the best is to take em all however. 
---
once you have all damage increasing perks, then go for survivablity (lone wanderer, fireproof, blocker, etc)
---
example build;

---
Your post wasn't helpful.
---
Thanks. I corrected the math. 25,000 caps is 50 tokens and a mere two-and-a-half rerolls. Hardly an efficient way to buy legendaries but does provide an inefficient caps-sink.
---
What special is that under?
---
Uhhhhh. Who cares?
---
From memory (which is never a good idea for me :P ), it's in the game settings choice, from the same menu you use to log out.  For PC, it's on the map, then pressing Z, then Game Settings.  I'm sure it is pretty similar on PS4.
---
But the software still works.  If you sold it to another person, they could register an account and it would work.  Its your account link to Bethesda that has been banned.  Make a new account and the product works fine.
---
The people who do this 90% of the time don't know it's annoyinf. If you send them a very VERY nice message they normally will turn the turrets off.
---
Nah, no one bothered to update the wiki after heavy weapons got their damage buffed, so if you're basing your damage off that, it's probably outdated. I'm almost positive .50 Cal is 49 base damage per shot now, but again, I'll remove all perks, get to full HP and check later tonight.
---
It change due to the dupers but what do i know lol?
---
Enlighten me...
---
Which is crazy considering how easy it is to beat. Just have one person take all the pylons, then after they get a few good hits for loot they will eventually hide near the respawn point. While you are in “down” status but not dead you keep the pylons activated. One stim pack to revive and repeat. I run a kamikaze build on it so it works out great I get a run maybe two and stim the pylon holder.  Usually only use 3 or 4 stims and dude stays vulnerable the whole time unless they game wont let you stimpsck your teammate.
---
I just close the double doors and keep closing them while my team herd the enemies out the other door and clear them, unless of course they attack me and then my team puts them down or they get the message and finally leave. Although we’ve gotten really good at leveling these bases.
---
I love Yao Guais, springs and acid are crucial for weapons and ammo. Sb sucks because Bethesda doesn’t want people to fight them, they are being used to add only difficulty not rewards.
---
Okay, unless you're pointing out a bug, making a suggestion OR watching people cry about the game lol
---
I'll give it a whirl.
---
Seems like a YOU issue, not an issue with the subreddit.
---
I've posted tons in here and rarely get downvoted, maybe you should increase the quality of your comments and posts if you keep getting downvoted?
---
I know that all again it leads to the same problem not having ammo while I never run out of Gatling gun ammo Probably got about 30k now lol and it is my main weapon ... but i can’t get even close to 5k cryo ammo when I barely use it
---
For PC?
---
I’m sure someone will read the comment and feel the need to make an asinine comment while trying to act like they didn’t “care” long before they commented!
---
Let’s wait and see
---
No need to vent.  It’s the only time I will intentionally blow up a camp.  Say hello to my Nuka Grenades and Orbital Strikes
---
Doesn't seem to understand it isn't the content people are downvoting, it's the whinier, holier-than-thou tone most of the posts have, much like OP's
---
Haven’t done the event and probably won’t so nice assumption there. All I was saying was how he phrased it might have come off as telling people how to play instead of just saying “hey in case you didn’t know this doesn’t do much etc etc”
---
How about these tvs are at train stations
---
The gun range and agility course definitely were peak frustration moments of mine, keep pushing, you'll eventually complete it and try playing with different guns for the range, I finally managed to complete it with a .44 revolver after numerous failures and nearly giving up.
---
Handmade Rifle is what I was referring to. I've heard from multiple sources that AP magazines are bugged and don't add armor piercing. I'm not sure on the accuracy of that - they claimed they tested. I'll try to do some testing on that too, think I have all the plans.
---
People already run armor in power armor which is generally superior than someone running armor in regular armor. Adding hazmat on top of regular armor still wouldn't make it better than power armor. Plus people like to play dress up more than worry about ambient rads in the local stream. Some will always be in hazmat suits, sure, but I feel the vast majority of the population will still be running around in silly hats.
---
Yeah, I'm digging deeper into it at the moment while working from home.  I'm supposed to be making a flyer that's due to print later today to be ready to ship on Monday, and I'm finding that my router has already dummied me through most of this.  I just have to set some parameters so that I get a 80/20% ratio vs my wife mindlessly watching House Hunters, scrolling through Instagram while drinking a couple beers before bed.  I feel like that's generous, and she'll never notice.  I could set her even lower, but that would just be mean.  If you don't tell, I won't.
---
Really? Thats seems like a strange feature.
---
Good to know, since I havnt went vending at any other area than whitesprings since the vendors were put in.
---
Right, he is whining claiming. Everyone gets downvoted in here, yet I post in here quite often and rarely get downvoted. So it seems like the issue is with him, not the subreddit itself.
---
.. just be careful on FilthyCasuals tho..they take the positivity to an extreme. I jokingly said someone belonged on a "short bus" and got banned.
---
..only for one day, but still.
---
(my apologies if you used that mode of transport in school..no offense meant)
---
Someone who thinks the reference is from oxhorn apparently
---
This is something they would need to patch out of the game, and putting up a patch (particularly on consoles) isn't an easy or cheap thing to do.  It's not worth going through the whole exercise just to patch in a bug fix that will get patched back out when they get the cameras working.
---
If cameras get delayed more, I'm sure they'll fix it in the next scheduled patch.  If not, it will be fine after they patch in the cameras.
---
Clean spaces helmet is not rare the clean suits are.
---
I totally get it! Just know some people can be super sensitive to phrasing and saying something along the lines “omg don’t ever do this it’s wrong!” Can come across way differently then “hey if you didn’t know these blah blah blah” 
---
No hard feelings from here just seeing how you might be getting downvoted!
---
No touche, It resets if you leave the hut. 😉

Who knows, I said it outloud on reddit so I’m sure it’ll get fixed really quick.
---
Only offer newb stimpak, nothing more.
---
Let them play the game instead invite him to take off sqb queen for nothing.
---
That depends if he was one of the people that just got banned for having too much ammo, then no he didn't break the ToS. Nowhere in the ToS states having over a certain amount of an ammo type is against the rules and a bannable offense.
---
After completing the event half a dozen times without issue, I traveled to the event last night and the group I was with couldn't complete the event. 
---
I'm a high level and everyone else looked to be in the double digits. I get there and nobody has claimed any pylons and there is a mob of gutsy's so I clear the mob with my Tesla and claim a pylon but nobody else claims any pylons. I start feeling like I am doing all of the work so I look around and start finding everyone just standing around freeloading. I wait trying to help and spent the event looking for 3* gusty's.
---
As a solo player I definitely will not be paying 2k caps to do this event anymore. It seems like the excitement has worn off and only low level players who want to be carried are showing up.
---
I had a lot of trouble with it. I completed the gun range after I got the Marsupial mutation (around level 32). I jumped on the roof and used my explosive combat rifle from there. You can see all of the targets from the roof without needing to move much, if at all.
---
So if you loke FC masuals so much, why are you whining and complaining here? 
---
Go home.
---
Not sure,  but if you didn't know and want to save some atoms, the column is going on sale tomorrow for 90 atoms.
---
Yeah, saw that too.  Yet here I still am.  Time to go to my cave, where I go to cry.
---
Man it just isn't that big of a deal. You can't get some free atoms this week, oh well?
---
Lmao, duping wasn't as simple as a random machine spitting it at you as you walked past. Don't downplay the active intent to commit a bannable offense. Duping gets people banned, you duped, you got banned
---
I have a 2S MG42. It amazing but you can go through 1k rounds without even trying.

As a human , I have been very reluctant to play Fallout 76, simply due to other people. So yesterday I finally installed the game, created my character, and stepped outside Vault 76 for the first time. Things were pretty quiet at first, I looked around and made some photos, but pretty soon, a high level player by the name of Babysitterx102 approached me. He was a very gentle and mindful guy, and dropped a bag full of junk and garbage , even giving me some stuff i could have collected by myself! I thanked him, and he invited me to a team, and we spent the next couple hours with feeding me exp breast milk and cleaning my poopy pants together. It was a great experience. We friended eachother, and went our separate ways.
---
Anyway, I guess what I want to say is, thank you, Babysitterx102. You really created a mess out of my game experience know i need to run again everything through and actually do some quests, despite what all the people who have played for more than 4 hours say. It just goes to show, that even as a Casual Baby like me  with no personality other than (AFORMENTIONED DESCRIPTOR OF MARGINALIZED DEMOGRAPHIC), I can still have fun playing video games on the internet.
---
I'm not doubting your faith in Google, but I spent 3 years learning from a master jeweler and all the videos in the world aren't going to equal three days of training with her.
---
It's not how much, it's how you got it.
---
I only come to this site for the mindless hate and anger the kids seem to want to express to everyone about everything at all times
---
Actually, legally yes the government does have to compensate you for anything they take from you and give you the monetary value of the items they take.
---
It's definitely thanks to the last large update they did.
---
Before then, continuous slap damage was definitely ridiculous.
---
The good/friendly players aren't necessarily far and few between, but the initial state of this game had left some bad tastes in a lot of players' mouths. So, there is still a large portion of the community that is quick to avoid contact at all costs.
---
This game is truly great but I wish more of my friends played it with me.
---
I still get on every now and then, but I have to try and find strangers to explore with.
---
That being said, add me if anybody wants. I'm lvl 41 and haven't had the chance to do a lot of missions.
---
If I'm not playing 76 then I'm either on Rocket League of GTA
---
Oops! Looks like you're wrong...AGAIN. Check out the latest posts. The one about the pumpkin grenades got downvoted and the OP asked why they were getting so many downvotes. Just trying to help people out. I'm not sure why you're so angry at this post. Are you okay?
---
Does anyone have a link to the TOS?  Everyone references that it has everything under the sun in it, but I barely even remember seeing the thing.
---
Man I have never seen someone actually have **negative** Karma
---
I'd say even before that. In Fallout 1 and 2 the locations were split by level, and to reduce map size. When you arrive somewhere you arrive at the ground floor (usually) and all the internal and external areas are in that ground floor model, but if you want to move up or down a level, by stairs, or ladder, or manholeyou'd get a loading screen. To get to another piece of the map, the edges had highlighted areas that you could move your character to and once it got in, it would load the next piece.
---
What about a conversation rate for caps to atoms? Make a wondering trader that basically allows you to buy atoms with caps. That way players can spend caps and it would give another Avenue for gaining atoms.
---
Unfortunately there can be some toxicity around here sometimes. I do like filthy casuals as it appeals to my preference in play style, we just need more traffic though as people heavily populate here yet there’s only a new thread every half an hour or so there lol.
---
Because nobody wants to carry a syringer around, they all have their super build to suit to or, the idea seems dumb to them would be nice to see some more support builds out there
---
It could definitely use more damage, especially with how much the ammo weighs. A high chance for knockdown/cripple could definitely work quite well.
---
To even make it somewhat useable (although not much...), you need a double or quad legendary effect. Same with the Harpoon gun, which I dearly wish had the ability to increase it's capacity via mods.
---
Bloodied is the way to go for max dps, no question. Bloodied builds are also entirely viable for all pve content and you won't die unless you don't run the correct build or don't look at your health while taking 4-5 big hits.
---
B25 is the way to go for maximum sustained DPS on single target.
---
BE is the way to go for maximum sustained DPS on multiple, clustered targets.
---
B + 10% while aiming falls behind both but is reasonable.
---
Other thoughts -
---
BE (explosive) will get you killed when farming ghouls quite often, even with Fireproof on, and it's totally unnecessary for farming. It's also rather crappy on the queen (explosive damage doesn't do a ton to her).
---
B25 would be the way I would go.
---
Ive  got an explosive handmade, so I'll get the mutation.  Thanks!
---
Check out the pumpkin grenade post! This is actually the second time I've posted on this sub!
---
Look, if you want your money back contact your bank and do a charge back. Bethesda can't do shit to stop you from doing that. At most they can try to do is ban you, but if you're accounts already banned, then who cares.
---
Lol!! I get the same thing. Makes me look like some psycho chasing them - re-dropping and trying to point at the bag. I tried 3 times to give away a three star low level weapon last night  and they all ran away.
---
Yes!  So much this.  Make a quest out of it and let us find holotapes around the wasteland with different commercials to collect.  It'd be so awesome to find local ads for Wavy Willard's Water Park or Camden Park and other local companies.
---
It's all static at the moment because nothings broadcasting
---
What If there was a quest / event to change that?
---
Aren’t these part of the inventory of the Watoga Super Mart bot?
---
A single orbital strike beacon is sufficient to destroy most camps.
---
You mean for having an abnormal amount of ultracite that you couldn't craft within the 30 window?
---
Seems to be, yes. From what I've read it requires you to know the protected lining which is still bugged. I did the quest that is supposed to reward it yesterday on a char that already knew treated and resistant but it just gave a shadowed combat plan.
---
 Vault suit is it's own catagory of underarmor.
---
I'll assume you did all the normal hardware and networking troubleshooting (and you didn't bother to post what you're playing on, not sure if that matters much though).
---
In case you didn't (or for anyone else reading this that doesn't know), REBOOT ALL THE THINGS!  Take your hardware all the way down to powered off, and restart, including your PC/console, and any network equipment you have (switches, routers, etc.).  Optionally, reinstalling the game, though for this I'm not sure I'd go that far.
---
After that, start (politely) complaining on Twitter.
---
I'm not!! Read my post! I'm just showing people that there are other subs to follow!
---
I'd love if they animated clips of episodes from Captain Cosmos! :(
---
When modders can code the game better then Bethesda 
---
*smh*
---
Well you've came to the right post lol
---
When I do farming runs I usually plan on just not going to the nuke zone for an hour or so. It sucks to do all that work and have everyone else enjoy the fruits of your labor, but it’s better than being stressed.  On a plus side it can give you an hour or so of an empty-ish map.
---
They got the message with the thousands of posts about it ok? Just fucking be patient
---
the new vegas dlc with big mt worked through a satellite, instead of a door.
---
Sounds like a plan man
---
Nope, the math showed it absolutely is craftable in that amount of time, /u/aten_ra did the math and it is completely doable in 30 days, I think it turned out it was actually possible to do it in 2 weeks.
---
That is exactly why I posted this but apparently I'm being whiney, attention seeking and looking for upvotes lol.
---
I like that option! Ive always wondered why there isnt something like that in place.
---
You can jump off the platform and just run up to the targets and shoot them. This can counter a problem if the target in the back far right doesn't always register a hit. 
---
Depending on your system, the obstacle course can be either easy or hard for some. On PC, it's generally easy, but if you're on a console, you may need to adjust the sensitivity of your controller if you find that your falling off the course a lot.
---
Yup.  Pull a pin, clank it against your helmet a couple of times, then give it the heave-ho

Well that new quest that ends near the meat shack has proof of a real sheepsquatch killing teens at lovers lane with razor quills no less.

That does makes it harder, it takes more than two weeks to accumulate 25000 caps at their current 1400 per day policy (which is really crippling), then for the 2.5 rolls we probably won’t get top tier effects unless extremely lucky. It’s easier to just keep farming ws lol

This was the exact reason I sold my AAE MG42, thing is god tier but man I go through 1000 rounds like it's nothing
---
Yep! It still got a bunch of downvotes though! Just like the OP said!
---
Maybe you should re-read the post.
---
A few downvotes don’t mean anything. You’re overreacting. That pumpkin post is upvoted just fine.
---
Yeah, and even those that just crafted or traded for it were banned. By all means ban the dupers, but don't ban people just because they traded for a shit ton of ammo especially when that ammo was also being used at the time as in game currency because the cap limit is so low at only 25k.
---
I used to have a locked door but always keep a chair or workbench next to a window so anyone could glitch through the wall if needed.

My bad i will edit this post thank you for pointing lack of info out.

Which many of us do. But pictures of camp builds, and posing with dead things only holds so much interest.

Then we come back here.
---
Also the advertisements and newsreels from the [Fallout 1 intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvRW46pyKCY).
---
i would agree, but they still stickied the repair kit issue which Bethesda employees purposely avoid commenting on here
---
This is how I fast travel for free ☹️
---
Clearly you take things way too literally. 
---
Also, I never mentioned anything about being able to fast travel into a nuke zone.
---
Your assuming that he got angry, but in reality he just wrote a simple answer without any feelings attached to it. Don't take everything personal and your world will look much more brighter :D (See now i assumed you take everything personal. Now you need to correct me and write that i'm wrong and i will answer you nothing in return ever again)
---
Yeah, I've only been griefed maybe five times since November's release. The vast majority of players will either ignore you or help you out. The sad thing is that the posts about griefing get so much attention that I have given up ever trying to help a new player directly - they tend to run when I try to get their attention to give them anything. Mostly I leave nice low level, modded armor and fully modded low level weapons and ammo in containers in Flatwoods, hoping someone will find them.
---
Level 90 plays the game for you.  Thrilling!
---
That was just my example! There are tons of posts that are edited asking why they got downvoted. And they were actually helpful.
---
I haven't seen evidence that crafters were banned. 900 hours guy outed himself as a duper.
---
Us???
---
good for you for helping homeless shelters bro :)
---
*combat inhibitors: disengaged*
---
Yup, did the quest, never received the reward. You can only do the quest once.
---
Lord I hate to necro but people are really off base here with how things went down. 
---
The Enclave didn't use the scorched to reactivate the nukes, they used the liberator bots - they fired up the fujiniya complex under mama dolce, simulating an "invasion."
---
The Enclave did however, create the scorched even previous to the Great war. 
---
They were firing nukes in the Glassed Cavern to try and create artificial Ultracite.
---
The first scorchbeasts come from that cavern, as well as mole rats and mole miners. 
---
They were captured and studied, but smaller versions escaped to the far reaches, mutating further and tunneling outward, creating the fissures, from where they then emerged.
---
They were not directly responsible for their release, nor were the majority of them even aware of their existence, as evidenced by the fact that when you first reconnect the Kovac satellite, Modus goes "What are these things? They're everywhere!"
---
Right .. good point
---
Where did he out himself as a duper? Because I've been following this whole thing quite closely, and no he never outed himself as a duper, because he isn't a duper and he actively reported dupers and exploiters even before he got banned.
---
Leather is usually treated with some kind of oil so it's not really comparable, leather is by far more flammable than even a 3cm thick plate of wood.
---
My first ever SB kill dropped 8 stimpaks. I was ecstatic.
---
The mod that gives text chat is working again
---
Yes but thats for only 1 min so its not for that long but that was only a "shower thought"
---
I dont take anything personal. This guy is just arguing his opinion, just like I am! No hard feelings! 
---
Kinda mean he called me a baby though :(
---
yes. looks great on my survival challenge reward .44
---
 You won’t get any of those for a two shot dragon

Practice in the obstacle course a few times before activating it so that you can get a feel for the order and make sure you can do each part. Do it in first person. On beams and the wire, just keep the little center dot on the beam or wire. Sprint between obstacles. If you stop past a button, just turn your head, you should still be able to activate it. I don't think Marsupial is a bonus since it gives too much air time. If you don't land on the ground between each log you need to jump over, then it will DQ you at the end. 
---
You need to complete all three parts, plus the live fire exercise that comes up after you finish the first three tests in one session. If you don't, you will have to do the whole thing again. You don't want to have to do that. So, put down the weapons test for now and practice the obstacle course as well.
---
Also, for the live fire final exercise against the robots at the end, again I found Marsupial useful. I just jumped on top of the little camp buildings and killed robots from there.
---
Most people get bored after you don't respawn things for them for 20-30 minutes. So yeah, I'll just leave the area for 20 minutes until people get bored, then I start farming. If lots of new people start camping, I leave again until they get bored. When I try to group up with people to take them on my route, they inevitably go off course and leave the group and start doing their own thing, so I've given up and I just wait until they go away.
---
 No. That's Enclave stuff and you will have to go to the bunker.
---
Exactly where I went and didn't see the option. I did a search on YouTube and seen where the setting is and that after level 5 you can adjust it. I'm level 70 and when I went to game settings the mode wasn't there at all. No option to toggle because there isn't an option to toggle at all......just odd I don't have it at all unless when I created the character there was an option?
---
Nope, still almost impossible to acquire ... it's unfortunate. Also what's the deal with the X01, why we get plans.
---
Reddit lets you save posts
---
Sweet roll and grape mentat and hard bargain does the job as well.
---
lols I karma darted a deathclaw 2 griefers were fighting snagged the loot bag ran over handed it to the guy who had his camp damaged by them
---
id avoid pc if you have a 960m or anything less powerful.
---
tbh id only do it if you have a 1060 or a 980 or better.
---
its basically the same, most people you meet are nice on pc. same bugs though and the ui is super freaking wonky. like random ass keys do the same thing depending on where you are in your pipboy, crafting table, or menu.
---
Ill keep that in mind but I'm really hoping to get the issue resolved to were i can play again, was just about to break lvl 100 with a fantastic bloodied unyielding build and was really starting to have a lot of fun.
---
He just needs to do a chargeback with his bank and he will get his money back. Bethesda won't be able to do shit.
---
Ran across it by accident for the first time last night (in the ash heap.)
---
I did not see a server or area broadcast/notification for it.  
---
I saw an announcment for a nuke launch - I check the LZ - nuke was on the other side of the map, but I also saw the SSQ event right next to where I was, so I Joined the fray.
---
Killed several robots and gutsies, got a couple hits in on the imposter, then died.   Not that I was alone - saw paper bags all over.
---
Respwaned, killed again.  
---
System refused to allow me to respawn. (completely ignored the X button., all other controls inop.)
---
No choice but to close. 
---
 Server hopped for 15 or so mintes trying to get back in.  
---
Couldn't find the event, and no servers I logged showed a nuke, so I'm guessing the entire server crashed....
---
Yup, I had the attitude in the beginning that every second player was a jerk and asshat model but then it flipped and 99% were awesome players, who cares where the other 1% asshat models went to, maybe playing COD 100.
---
Cheers!
---
I’m thinking all the dupes ran out.  Cost a lot to buy from vendor hard to get as drop, once you have them all you stop looking for them.
---
Then it was a bad example. You’re still overreacting.
---
Also public events like this should not have you drop a bag on death. It's annoying for me when it's just a few circuits and some steel for my camp that was chewed on. But I really feel bad for the people who carry tons of junk.
---
Sweet as. I'll have to take another look at Watoga Sunken depot, as I don't remember that.
---
I love satire
---
Most ppl that carry support wepons use the enderol (idk hows to spell it) to lower a targets DR. 
---
Usually shoot her with it, pop a drug, then engage. When the drugs wear off i know that the syringer effect is also gone. Then it's just shoot again, drugs again, then repeat.
---
I see you have literally copy and pasted that into almost every post in this particular thread, if you would have bothered to read mine and what I said, I already took that into account.
---
Thank for the cut and past comment though.
---
just had a vision of all the fo76 devs hanging out, laughing, saying, "Why don't they use the damn syringer!"
---
I like how on GTA you can watch other players
---
More or less sensitive?  I'm on a PS4
---
I don't think he claimed for his post to be helpful though..
---
Did you try a build without PA? 
---
because, except in nuke zone, regular armor build with proper legendary effect is far better (and, IHMO, funnier too)
---
PA is just an easy way to get good protection quickly, but it's really limited overall.
---
Yup, nuke zone are usually dead after awhile, it used to be that the legendary drops got better after the nuke had left, but I am sure they’ve patched that.
---
You are most definitely just unlucky. I ran through the burrows once and got 15+ legendaries. Including 1 3 star, 4 2 stars and the rest 1 stars
---
It makes me sad people assume the player based it toxic, not only have I never run into a griefer/troll/OP asshat, I think it is one of the better online communities to ever exists.
---
Also only ever dealt with minor, comedy endusing bugs
---
its not really telling people how to play its warning those with pumpkin grenades how not to waste them - it doesn't stop me from chucking them at him and hes not creating a meta build its just hey if you are a debuffer person the grenades are wasted
---
I mean lets face it debuffer builds are team based so most people with them are going to be the upvote people as I wouldn't waste my pumpkin bombs on him now till his shields are down
---
Ya
---
Wow that's alot of ideas and they sound really good. Hopefully they get these in the game.
---
Aid please. Then it gets reduced weight perks from Travelling Pharmacy.
---
Range... started on the range (not in the hut) on the left, moved to the right.  It's ok to move to the targets.  I think you could even shoot them in the back
---
I used a lever action, but the reload time hurt me.
---
Obst coirse.  Um, let your offspring do it. After failing 20 times, I handed it to my 12 year old...twerp made it on his 3rd try.  Oh the shame...
---
Make it 5000 and we have a deal.
---
Nope, no option on creation.  Unfortunately I'm not a console guy (never owned one), so past the above I'm afraid I'm not going ot be much help.
---
Salt of the earth and commanders charge looks decent
---
I doubt they have access to their parents bank account.
---
I sometimes do that in a queen fight
---
Ikr
---
Oh yeah, they're absolutely one of those. They all are.
---
Love it, needs to be tougher though in my opinion. Loot is always pretty good, lowest legendary drops from a run was 6, best was 14. Had a few 2 star drops which is always good, if they keep adding these and increase the difficulty each release, we’ll be on a winner.
---
AFAIK they did yes. I re-nuke or go to a new server after it dissipates, since i'm mostly there for the mass / fluids.
---
Or create a new fucking character and give up on dupe shit, little does Bethesda care about players that actually play the game ( not the ones that waste money on atoms ) why would it care about banned accounts ?
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll show you how to do it
---
if you’re getting griefed, the absolute best thing to do is leave the world, block the GT/PSN/Whatever the hell PC players do and join another world. It can be satisfying to kill griefers but that sort of attention is all they want so it’s important not to send them a strongly worded message either.
---
This is seriously your second post within a 2 hour time frame in which you ask for help on your banned account. If playing the game was so important to you why did you do whatever got you banned in the first place?
---
I think it’s a lot better, yeah. The game still has occasional crashes and freezes, but no where close to as many as it had near launch. There’s a new decent questline that was added recently, along with some repeatable dailies and new brewing mechanics. Atomic shop items are getting better too, if you enjoy that stuff
---
Make sure to just run around saying Gary. Also, if you teamed up with 3 others doing the same that would be pretty crazy.
---
Yeah, it feels like they had more they wanted to do with it.
---
Idk maybe sometime down the road? Maybe when backpacks come out they'll start talking about more stash stuff.
---
Agree. The Burrows got a bad initial rap for being "boring", but it's real purpose was to give grinders a place other than Whitesprings to nuke. Having similar areas (whether sewers, mines, bunkers, vaults, or whatever) in more places would finally make nuking more interesting in general (and maybe give veterans a reason to visit the north end of the map!)
---
Simple dungeons that turn into glowing-monster-madness when nuked could be added *anywhere*! I'd think that Wavy Willard's Water Park, The Palace of the Winding Path and the Red Rocket Mega Stop would be excellent places to expand out in the North end of the map. The Valley Galleria, Berkeley Springs and Monongah in the central-East area all scream out as places that could use some love.
---
I think people mistake this dungeon with Arktos Pharma. Which is the one advertised in the wild Appalachia. (The one with the guy in power armor super sledging the mirelark queen) . That dlc will be a lot more great. 
---
This addition to the game was more for lore expansion and nuke running.
---
Sorry man...my biggest nightmare ..my TSE lever action is my absolute fave
---
It's actually easier in survival because you cant really be stalked outside the workshop to be farmed for caps. They can't just see you on the map and come find you like in adventure mode.
---
Than* and that would defeat the purpose of having a limit in the first place. I think our current limit will go up  in some way, at some point.
---
They need to make the terminal even more versatile.
---
I’ll still get a nocturnal wood leg

He isn't a kid, he is an adult and chargebacks are stupidly easy to do.

I have all girls.  I'm doomed.

Is Cryolator explosive a legacy weapon yet? I have this one.
---
I second that, did a surface to air event and as mentioned, different body parts meat and irrelevant junk I don't even remember, got better stuff from a box.
---
Yeah, we'll see I guess...
---
As a non American, I pity the state of American culture that giving opinion must begin by stating one's identity
---
I'm looking for some mutations...I have 6 and am looking for the rest of them.  And I have plenty of caps!  I'm BadWolfSat5 (same as on here).  If you don't mind hitting me up when you're on.  I'm at work now though.  I'm also looking for a Bloodied SS if you happen to have one...can't hurt to ask.
---
I'd rather see the videos depicting each S.P.E.C.I.A.L attribute. It'd give some variety, and I kinda like them.
---
I entered the burrows with a friend was disappointed the we were only attacked by ground of 3 ghouls at a time more confused that they were level 46 ghouls. We expected larger mob size and level. Also the military tech the BoS detected was a single Assaulttron. That was also level 47... It wasn't intense it wasn't nerve racking it was just boring and unorginal. They could have forced it to spawn large groups of enemy's higher level enemy's and maybe made the boss unique like a Frankenstein abomination of a sentry bot and Assaulttron like something from the automaton dlc from 4 that would have been awesome.
---
Do your self a favor and take a quick look at the map and see if there are more then five 100lvl+ before activating. If not server hop.
---
They absolutely know it’s annoying and it’s outright stealing the loot and xp others spawned. They are simply selfish low lives who likely also steal from others in real life.
---
Thank you for using your brain 🧠 and yes , I agree with you
---
My first reaction here was "What the fuck?  The International Space Station is in the game, and it has a cloaking device and shields??  How did I miss this??"
---
TIL there are pumpkin grenades.  Man, there's a lot more of this game I haven't gotten to than I thought.
---
The building to the game is great! And it's getting even better patch 9! I do love the collaborative effort i see sometimes :)
---
For bodyguards by bodyguards!!!!!
---
I think some in-game personalities and their actions reflect their some part of their actual characteristics in real life...
---
If his post isn't helpful or ontopic then it should be downvoted, that is part of proper reddiquette.
---
It's survival and I'm cowardly while soaking up that sweet XP, but once I'm leveled up I'm coming into adventure and I guarantee that's what I'll be doing. Vault suit, lead pipe, "GARY! huh-huh-huh"
---
If are under any type of mutation at all..starched genes or not does not make a difference
---
They have already said it's being fixed in next week's patch.
---
How do you know any of this? They could be a computer AI for all we know.
---
Burn it to the ground...
---
Because in a way those extra 80 atoms ( or more missed this week ) would had put me on that silver suit for free , ain’t buying atoms, so bye bye skin
---
Nonsensical? Fallout 1 opened with a TV broadcast post war about war bonds and corvega cars
---
Actually it was in an alcove between the two bathrooms, and I usually get an assortment of plans at mine.
---
I feel like a quick fix would be for every chard and gangrenous ghoul add 10 reavers or stalkers. It’s still doable but swarms of low level ghouls can still present a issue if you aren’t prepared and those kind of numbers could quickly overwhelm a lot of people. I also think it would work well with the setting. The problem with this idea is of course massive frame rate drop
---
Yes yes 100% yes. I've been saying this since release.
---
Zzzzz screw this posts thumb down
---
can't send messages on PC

Ehhh Xbox has innate chat functions, not sure about PS4

Cool story. Maybe try melee?

Oh sweet as. Can't go wrong with that.

No super sledge but i do have whatever mutations you need my friend! My gt is oneeyedcole and im happy to help you out.

Oh no, not downvotes.  How will I face my family?
---
best they'll do is 5 caps and a firm handshake and a thank-you. xD
---
I mean all the farm spots are well established now and with ammo smith and super duper... I’ve got ammo to spare.    Two must have cars to be able to swap out for crafting.
---
Naw, it's all good, it is usually helpful to know what you're playing on, but some things are independent of the platform.  You issue *looks* like a login issue, which would be on the server end, but it's always good to get the basics out of the way because they're easy and something you can do without help.  Plus, anything is possible.
---
Your error is similar to the ones you get when you've been banned (but it's not the same, I think yours is the 'servers are down for maintenance' code, which could mean that you're not connecting properly for some reason (hence the reboot everything comment), or that the server you're connecting to is down (but that shouldn't happen for days on end).
---
I see you're on PC now, a couple things if you haven't tried:
---
[Bethesda Support diagnostic](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/38219/~/how-do-i-create-a-bethesda.net-diagnostic-file%3F)
---
Try running a tracert to the game servers or to bethesda.net and see if you're getting time outs (you'll have to look that stuff up, I have to run to do work stuff).  Google a bit on how to do that and how to find what hte IP address of some of the servers might be.  They're on Amazon Web Services servers or something like that.
---
So many people have purchased it and been like “wtf” already with this one. Did ANYBODY at Bethesda even place one to look at it after “designing” it (obv they did from the sales pictures that make it hard to make out, and they put it out for sale anyway).  Reminds me of when I purchased the alpine horn and nobody around could hear me blow it and it can’t be played like an instrument like your expect from an interactive horn
---
A gamma gun, really? I hadn’t heard of using one of those yet, I’ll look into the torso, and fireproof perk though thanks for the tip
---
ROFL, so you don't understand how vote fuzzing works....

Those aren't real downvotes, the more popular a post gets the more "phantom" votes it gets to help make it hard for bots to spam vote. Those aren't real votes.

With those weights this would be like a 5 lb pizza thanks Bethesda
---
Actually it was on pc, but you are definitely my kinda guy!   Keep up the good fight!
---
Yeah it’s still whitesprings for that stuff.  I watched that video where they had a nuke on the sheepsquatch event, all of the robots there make it possible to grab a lot of it in a short amount of time, but that seems like a risk, and really difficult.

I always take those blocks in honor of our one true God, GAAARRRRRRYYYYYYYY!!!!

There are plenty of posts on here that aren't helpful that get upvoted to hell. They're just trying to shed light on a subreddit that's a little less toxic. It may not be useful to you but it can be useful to others.
---
Which has over 70 upvotes and is on the front page. You literally just disproved your own post.
---
Damn that sucks :(. Did u try closing and restarting FO76? Or even after that it didnt show up?
---
Ammosmith and super duper are your friends
---
I had fun with it solo. Does 4 or 5 times with my level 46. No power armor rifle build.
---
Imo power armor makes everything in the game easy mode. If you want more of a challenge, wear no power armor. Also, play without melee weapons. Melee is OP, especially if you have anything instigating. It ones shots most everything.
---
What bugs me the most is when I’m in the middle of a farming run through a nuke zone, carrying 400lbs of junk that I desperately need, and die. When I attempt to load back in and reclaim my loot, the infinite load screen hits me and boots me from the server. FML
---
Send a message with an orbital strike instead? Can't believe there isn't a message service on PC though.
---
Are you become wanted if you destroy those camps @ whitesprings?i always thought of blowing it up because its annoying ass hell but dont want to be wanted..
---
All you have shown is that you don't understand how reddits vote fuzzing algorithm works, you are literally whining about your post that has 70 upvotes and is on the front page, because it has some vote fuzzing added making it look like you got a handful of downvotes.
---
&gt; But I really feel bad for the people who carry tons of junk.
---
At this point carrying large quantities of valuable junk into that fight is bad judgement on the part of the player
---
This week or next week I think
---
I’ll have to get my .50 cal out and try that
---
If you have marsupial when you do the course, try with and try with it suppressed with full strength Rad-X. You can see which works better.
---
You'll get it. I spent hours on it. Felt like rage quitting lol. But finally got it.
---
It's not really a grind when you can easily get 2000 Caps each day just playing 30 minutes, assuming you are high lvl of course.
---
I don't see much you can improve on. If you don't mind the repair though you can move 3 points of intelligence to agi (removing power patcher) since ap is very valuable in many circumstances. But that's all I have to say. :)
---
Thanks for the info! When iget home from work ill try these and Google what ill need to know/do i have a diagnostic report saved but at the time had no idea what to look for in it, thank you again!
---
On pc so can't message, tried to talk to them for a few minutes after but they just ignored me. Rebuilt their tower and walked off like we weren't there!

plus, how am I supposed to role play as an ent without wood armor?
---
treebeard would be ashamed.
---
I would love to have a Super Mutant Hound to roam the wasteland with. I think it would be cool to have the dogs available from like different factions maybe? 
---
Like if you could get super mutant hounds from Grahm, attack dogs like Dogmeat and the random dogs from 4 from the BOS?
---
I think cats would be a neat pet but I don't think they'd be too good for wandering the wastes and should probably stay at your camp. Lazy things lol
---
You know law is not the same in different countries? Girl in US insulted by Boy from India doesn't lead anywhere.   Those violators you mentioned has nothing to do with this case. Murders etc are totally different things. Bethesda isn't recording any player voices to their servers. You can't ever prove that voice you just recorded belongs to person who lives in another side of the world.
---
You can say that its job of attorney, but they are not free. If you can't prove anything you pay the bills.
---
100% agree
---
Yesterday I logged in took over Berkeley springs got a level 160+ kill me stole my junk , so I decided to server hop , I’m not about to loose my caps for a shotty explosive guy.
---
New server sheepsquacth event is on , fast travel is only 37 caps sure , fast travel event is ending...
---
Got 100 and the fixer plan I’m glad I did that move :)
---
this game is getting shit ,,
---
1) the lag 
---
2) the way the enemy spawns
---
3) the stupid quests 
---
4) dropped loot inside caves / dungeons 
---
some special equipment are useless in some cases 
---
auto heal stimpacks that revives you..
---
how it works ?
---
u got killed, it revives you, then u lag and freeze and then gets killed , then respawns, goes back down, lag again and gets killed, then your dropped loot disappears, and then before u can continue to finish that stupid quest , system maintenance please exit ...
---
FUCKING hell seriously ?
---
Except if you read more in this thread he is literally whining about his post that got 70 upvotes and is on the front page. He is literally crying about the fact reddit vote fuzzing added a couple downvotes to it to keep bots from being able to know the exact score.
---
That isn't shedding light on anything other than his ignorance of the vote fuzzing algorithm.
---
I jumped on the roof. It didn’t reset.
---
What gun are you using? A 10 millimeter pistol would help if fire rate is your issue. Plus you don’t have to stand in the firing range box to complete it. Just run up to them point blank.
---
True but with a stash limit and the legendary vendor coming soon pve people tend to carry everything with them. Not saying they shouldn't have be prepared to lose it, just sucks.
---
Scorchbeasts, Mothman and Flatwoods monsters all should give better loot honestly.   
---
For the cryptids to be pretty rare their drops are super lackluster. Grafton Monster's drops are actually really nice which is why it baffles me that the others don't drop anything useful.
---
Lost my 10mm like that.  Just poof.   Traded for a sniper tse and then 3 hours later....poof.    Out the armor I traded for it and got nothing :(
---
Can we get legendary scout armor? fuck wood armor lol
---
Right excavator arm and leg randomly lost to nowhere
---
Jw how is it useful?
---
Does it have built in clan functions like the chat mod too?
---
Ya man I agree. I did it in less time than that with 1 diluted stimpack my shotgun and my powerfist.
---
I would be fine with them making WS not Nuke able or plant bases near it if they made it a free fast travel point. And maybe if people made it a trade hub.
---
Because I talked to him in PM after he posted this and told him about how to do a chargeback to get his cash back.
---
Thanks for your input, I may just take off the card for a few days and see how it feels and then either go Luck or Agility with those points. ive heard 4 leaf clover is OP with shottys.
---
I know its going to suck but as you just stated your mate can just kill you after you destroy a base to clear your bounty without actually cap lost hence why they making it invulnerable to deal with everyday griefers but don't forget they plan on moving boundaries later for whitespring and lastly if that happens just server hop. Wish you luck and hope your grind goes well and you get some epic legendaries.
---
This is nice and all, but stories like these you are letting someone else play for you basically. Just play normally, run to Flatwoods, start fighting Mr Gardeners and learn the struggle it’s actually a good enjoyment
---
I doubt any bottles were ever made. Surely Bradberton would have had a bottle in his of office or Vault.
---
Took about 25 or so server hops to get mine. But I can't attach them due to the paid mod bug....😑

The PUNisher lol
---
You do but if you have a friend there to kill you they get the caps from the bounty instead of the base owner
---
There would be if they had used Steam like a sane game company.

Friend have you just asked them to take it down? I always do and I haven't had a soul deny my request.
---
Don't ever open your ports to outside if you don't know what are you doing. You might give free access for people to mess with you computer.
---
No. You're telling people to stop posting here, and mentioning filthy casuals as an afterthought.. The downvotes are for insulting everyone who comes here. If you had made a positive post promoting filthy casuals, you probably would have gotten positive responses.
---
With player vending supposedly going live next month, will this be viable?

Lmfao
---
Yay floating foundation what weve always wanted. Not realistic aspects or proper bulldozing in camp mode. Or getting the grass out my floor and walls. I mean lame very lame .i would prefer a weed wacker honestly i hate floating bases and this promotes invunerable Camp. Not happy.
---
Oh, for sure. I wasn't arguing that. I was just adding the little Institute tidbit.
---
Not anymore. Unless they changed it back. That little, unannounced exploit fix really hurt 😢
---
It's ridiculous that there isn't global/local text chat! Needs to be implemented

Heck yeah!

I want a protectron newscaster who announces events, and cycles through how long is left on them, and maybe how many players are in an event area so you have an idea if you want to go or not. He could announce how many people are waiting on the hunter/hunted channel, and the looking for group channel if we ever get one. He could exchange snark with his assaultron co-anchor.

Leather armor that was used in historical combat was mostly "boiled leather"  aka cuir bouilli. A vegetable cured leather which is then hardened with water, either hot or cold and then molded to shape.

I approve of this idea.

The New Jersey devil could might as well be the Sheepsqautch, they are pretty similar
---
No, its because you are whining about the vote fuzzing taking effect on your pumpkin grenade post. Reddit puts in phantom downvotes and upvotes on posts when they start to get popular to help confuse voting bots. 
---
You are complaining about downvotes that don't even actually exist, they only show up there to make it hard for bots. 
---
Please if you are going to make claims like this, at least look into the situation more before making assumptions.
---
That thing seems to be my unicorn.  I definitely appreciate it!
---
Friends that require materials I need to farm.
---
Same place you buy Ultracite plans :-)
---
Preach it, brother. I've tried three times. Used up over 200 Stims being, for the most part, the only one activating pylons and yet never did complete the damn thing. With the pylon effects, the minion lasers and explosions and the @#$% stealth effect I couldn't even find the damn thing to get a shot in half the time it was "vulnerable".
---
I suppose I could be "happy" that it forced my hoarding ass to clear some weight... but I think from now on I'll simply sell  or give the stims away rather than burn them uselessly.
---
i get home around 830 pm est if you still havent gotten help by then look me up. psn: Silune
---
Gamma guns have always been regarded as a bit of a joke in 76 as they're only really effective against humans. If you mod them they do 125 rad damage a shot minus what rad resistance your opponent has, which usually isn't a lot as rad resist chems cancel out mutations.
---
Agreed.
---
I don't usually agree with this sort of thing, but as a Brit, I have to say "fuck me it's hot today"
---
Odd.. my snozeberries taste like irradiated radberries.... Uh oh!
---
White springs turret camps aren't so annoying when you find better places to farm.
---
Yeah that assaultron was nothing
---
It’s definitely better than back in Dec/Jan. Still crashes and freezes from time to time but nothing like before. The market on Reddit is full of trades/sales so you can acquire good weapons and armor for caps. 
---
As for me, I’m glad summer is here so I can put down the sticks for awhile. I’ve been playing around 500hrs since December and I think I need a break until Winter.
---
*licks glass*
---
I liked it but got literally zero memorable loot.  Not one star to be found, and the have a single Assaultron as the boss was a little underwhelming too.
---
I think I’m fucking cursed when it comes to finding legendaries.  Level 60 and my best gun is a zero star short Gatling.
---
We can't assume this is known, I have asked 20+ players and none of them knew it was annoying people, to their credit its a good idea to farm free items when you return to your camp as anything hit by turrets lets you get loot from them plus saves ammo and this is what most tell me after I speak to our fellow vault dwellers we have spent 50 years in the vault with.
---
Then if that's the case educate them on the vote fuzzing? He's right about the fact that some people on this sub reddit are toxic and a few people in these comments are proving him correct. I didn't know about "vote fuzzing" until it was mentioned here because I'm fairly new to reddit, and I appreciate you telling me about it. It's really not hard to explain to someone how things work without being rude, you know? :)
---
Can be hard to do when they were banning people just for having too much ultracite ammo even though it was currently being used as an ingame currency when they did the bans.
---
They didn't get rid of it, they just added a global cooldown to respawns. When you kill something, the timer starts, and that mob can't respawn for \~ 5-10 minutes, regardless of how many times new players join the server and load the area.
---
The Burrows doesn't have a global cooldown on respawns, but I still think it's less efficient than doing a proper clear route at whitesprings, which will take long enough that enemies will start respawning once you reload.
---
No thanks.
---
Server hop at Dolly Sodds (sp?) Two spawn there every time.
---
Leather is barely flammable, real leather. Not faux leather which is made with petrochemical compounds.
---
No problem. Only recently found this out myself while having the same issue so it's nice to be able to pay it forward.
---
How do you avoid being banned when they banned completely innocent people just for having too much ultracite ammo even though at the time that ultracite ammo was being used as in game currency because of the 25k cap limit.
---
It would be hilarious  if one exploded and sent you flying upward in the blast.
---
If we are lucky they will connect them like fallout 3 for me that part of what sets it apart from the other games!
---
If it was capable of becoming 2 and 3* legendaries maybe someone would wear it. As of right now my junk legendaries mule has a full set of assassins, unyielding, bolstering and auto stim. Could be good if any were powered, Sentinel or cav as well maybe I would see someone where it then, but I have never seen anyone wear a wood armor set, or even a single piece
---
The issue for me would be that you can't reload it. If I take 15 minutes to nuke, I want to be able to farm for 2 hours.
---
Blocker doesn't work in PA.
---
what am I doing wrong then? I have gunsmith level 1 and no more gunsmith perk cards show up in the choice of cards to take -- I am level 60 and still gunsmith level 1.
---
Or at least let them be 3*. 
---
You know I wouldn't mind a full set of 3* Unyielding powered wwr wood armor. Slap the stealth mod on those 5 pieces and I'd be invisible indefinitely. And my sneak speed would be so fast.
---
I've actually seen 10 legendaries in a single run and 2 were 3 star. I think its pure rng.
---
I had just made my first set of Excavator armor and I was getting in it when the server crashed and then it was gone from my inventory so I posted on Twitter and they told me to submit a ticket - only to tell me they couldn't help me :&lt;
---
Kind of pointless to have me submit a ticket when you know you can't restore it.
---
I did Bomb Retrieval this morning. Had no issues whatsoever.
---
Sadly not everyone was legitimately banned. Many were banned just for having over 100k ultracite ammo, even though at the time it was being used as ingame currency because of the 25k cap limit.
---
Nowhere in the ToS did it say you weren't allowed to gather that much ammo, so how would you expect someone to know not to trade for or craft that much ammo?
---
Get a shotgun and one with explosive effects is better.  Very easy to complete the gun range that way
---
And if i just log of after blowing up the place and log back in,i stay wanted?
---
I'll help you what's your gt
---
I would love to see the poles with the skulls and stacked cages as well as the more rickety building sets - like the junk walls and scrap ceilings to give it a more "I found this stuff and did the best I could." feel. 
---
I really like seeing pretty camps but I really want a beat up, creepy camp.
---
What's an ISS?
---
You can pick a card every level-up you get. So, no, not 240, just 3.
---
You can apply the shrouded mod which makes all the wood armor pieces extremely light (cuts the weight down to 25%) and makes you harder to detect in dark areas, it has some other effect too, i think it was fast movement speed while sneaking but not sure, its designed for a stealth build, the low resists and durability of wood armor shouldnt matter due to the goal of a stealth build being to wipe everything out without being detected, the main thing that holds back wood armor is that it can only be 1 star, which makes it much less favorable to other armor sets, btw, full unyielding wood is very useful when selling to vendors
---
Sadly you did not read my original post. Your comments in this thread in context to my original post are irrelevant.
---
Pick one when level up
---
Pick a new rank each time you level up?
---
Once again, there is no proof he actually broke the rules, there were people banned just for having too much ammo, even though nowhere in the ToS did they say you weren't allowed to have that much ammo.
---
Keep in mind around that time was also when people were using the ultracite ammo as in game currency because the cap limit is so low.
---
So how does someone break rules that aren't even written in the ToS? Where do you expect them to find these unwritten rules?
---
This is why the "Bethesda pls let us show off our bland unremarkable power armor"-type posts are annoying. 
---
The game has real problems that the devs should be focusing on, like the server disconnects, game crashing, SBQ disappearing, etc.
---
I had it pop up on 1 char a couple of days ago and thought maybe this has been fix. Switched chars and went to the same spot. Nothing. It's still an issue. I've done 1 Mire daily on 5 chars in months.
---
Not you I suppose 🙄
---
I think all the cards are available after 50.
---
So... you can't get about 140-210 atoms out of about 420 (maybe a little less, a few days they only offer 50 atoms worth of challenges). So that's about 1/3 to 1/2 of what you can make all week with the dailys. Which are stingy enough. I realize they may not be able to fix it, but it wouldn't be asking too much to just offer at least 140 for free. It costs them nothing (other than the potential to make us pay more, which theoretically wouldn't have been there if not for their mistake) and gives off good will. And when it is so little atoms you can work for, those few atoms add up.
---
 With Ammosmith I just make my own. Have not farmed ammo in ages and I make 5.56, and 40mm Grenades all the time.
---
I named all my mules Gary, kind of confusing now in hindsight when I need to get something off them now.
---
don't you need a gunsmith card in the lower window (there is one in the upper window).
---
Do I uninstall the existing card and then somehow upgrade it when it's in the bottom?
---
QQ
---
He may have not done anything against the rules, people were banned for having too much ammo a while ago. Yet nowhere in the ToS did it say anywhere you weren't allowed to craft or collect over 100k ultracite ammo.
---
So if he was wrongfully banned just because he was collecting ultracite ammo (which was being used as in game currency at that time as well due to the 25k cap limit) to trade with , why wouldn't he post until he got it taken care of?
---
If that happened to me I'd be pissed too, break no rules and still get banned? Yeah you bet your ass I'd be making a huge stink out of it if that happened to me.
---
It's not just us, man. The west is diseased.
---
Alright, I agree they may not be able to fix it. But I don't think it asks too much for them to at least acknowlede it, say sorry we can't fix it, and maybe as an apology, let us have maybe 140 for free (which is a little less than what we could have earned seeing as some days some of those undoable challenges are 20 atoms). It costs them absolutely nothing and would give them a lot of good will.
---
Hell, R* offers free in game money just for logging in sometimes to GTA just cause (to drum up more business really). It really isn't asking much.
---
As an American male, I completely agree with that
---
I'm not counting on them handing out anything. Lol
---
Yeah I try and log in everyday. Like I've learned my lesson can I come out of time out now please? At least let me get my shit back that I transferred onto it when I was unbanned for those 2 days ..
---
oooh yeah, great idea!
---
I wasn't asking for the camera. I'd like either the challenges changed which I realize may not be doable in a week (at which point it's a moot point) or them to offer the minimum amount we'd have gotten to us (140, if we could do the challenges it would actually be a little more as some days one of the challenges is hte 20 atom challenge, I'm just going by if every day it's 2 10 atom challenges).
---
 You can make different parts and mod them. I have a Jet Pack on my Torso, but I could make another one and put, say Reactive Plates on it. Then I could just switch out Torsos for different effects.
---
Why doesn't blocker work in PA? I just tested it and it seems to work very well. Level 22 ghoul was doing nearly double damage against me with the perk off vs when it was on. Good to know about Action Boy/Girl, thank you for your input!
---
No
---
You must have Steel, Lead and Gunpowder for ages then.
---
As a horse , I have been very reluctant to play fallout 76, simply due to hand sanitizer prices. So yesterday I finally installed the game, created my character, and stepped outside vault 76 for the first time. Things were pretty quiet at first , I pulled ham and scrubbed stone , but pretty soon a high level player by the name of xxxpeexpeexsmallxxx approached me. He was dapper and smelled good and dropped me a bag full of McDonald's monopoly game stickers and chickens feet, even giving me some kind of rash! I thanked him , and he invited me to a team, and we spent the next couple hours peeling tree bark and eating dirt together. It was a great experience. We friended each other , and went our separate ways. Anyway , I guess what to say is , thank you , xxxpeexpeexsmallxxx. You really created a bag of dicks, despite what all the people who have played more than four hours say. It just goes to show , that even a horse with no personality other than peeing on my feet . I can still have fun playing video games on the internet.
---
I'm guessing we will see quite a bit of releases like this. Most of these things have been pre-planned by Bethesda; they are just releasing content that has already been made. I remember reading about there being "huge, underground areas" in Fallout 76. I'm guessing places like Toxic Valley and Ash Heap are going to have quite a bit of underground things to do.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch
---
Did you miss the part where I said "that depends if he was one of the people that got banned for too much ammo". Where in that does that insinuate "they all are"?
---
I have no issue with dupers being banned, what I have issue with is people being banned for having "too much ammo" in behtesda's mind. 
---
You do realize that at that time people were using ultracite ammo as in game currency because of the 25k cap limit and high end gear being worth a lot more than 25k cap.
---
It's like 1830 with Hard Bargain, and then you can sell stuff back to him for like 400ish caps that he gets after the purchase, reducing total price to around 1400. Or just server hop to find one
---
Yeah I should have put (imposter sheepsquatch) after that.
---
Hah!  Are you using an ISP-provided router or something off the shelf?  And not on WiFi, right?  I wouldn't expect an ISP-provided modem (like one from Comcast, say) to let you dick around with QoS too much, but I've been wrong before.
---
It’s pretty OP and you can save up a ton of ammo to use later.
---
Oh, they have fixed it then!
---
Depends on if it is a physical copy or digital. If its digital PC copy, pretty sure he can't make a new account.
---
All he needs to do to get his money back is to do a chargeback with his bank. Completely remove bethesda from the equation and get your money back from the bank.
---
Yeah theres a back entrance. I looted everything inside there for 2hours (even if its a small place) to make sure I found everything in there. No dice for the said safe 😪
---
OP welcome to the club. Interesting that there’s always someone who blames the player vs the UI and or client/server data integrity. Those people will “get it” when it happens to them, but I hope it doesn’t. Wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
---
Didn’t think you could scrap it at all..
---
he says please withing the very first few words
---
besides, its good info
---
fuckin kids these days are just assholes 
---
adult: careful, drinking bleach is harmful-
---
todays kids: DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO! *chugs clorox*
---
LOL. I have about 35lbs of non junk in my stash. The rest is junk, and I do have rather a lot. ;) Gunpowder you make at a Chem Station, and Steel and Lead are very common.
---
I really really like that gun after they buffed it. But holy shit keeping up with the ammo usage is insane.
---
Debating on priming it just because you craft like 4x more than regular .308 with ammosmith. As long as you have the flux...
---
Same, did it couple of days ago. Works fine.
---
agreed,  those "super sensitive" people are the problem not the OP
---
way too many snowflakes nowadays
---
If they do they better put all the eggs on sale for a few hours before.
---
I haven’t played for a while, why are we fighting  the international space station and when did it get shields?
---
Not like that, if you had two different debuff syringers you can stack both debuffs on it. Not stack it like that.
---
Thanks, im not terribly worried. Im rocking some chipmunk miner head right now.
---
Thanks for demonstrating you have no point and can't defend your position so you have to rely on meme's.
---
He will get his money back, I already explained to him and walked him through how to do a chargeback with his bank to get the full amount of money back from the transaction.
---
To add to this amazing point with scrapper.  For us shotgunner folks, scrapping the super mutants laser rifles nets 10 plastic each! Honestly killing super mutants nets you enough steel, gunpowder and plastic to stay positive in the ammo department. I just need a lucky hole mine run every week or so for lead.
---
...and those people will never learn from their mistakes then
---
True, problem is I already have a pistol build, and I find melee boring.
---
I read your post, which is why I stated that not everyone was legitimately banned. Maybe YOU should try reading better.
---
This issue goes back to beta. If interested search vanish, missing, disappear. Skip the posts that don’t apply and you up with an awful lot of relevant posts.
---
I'm reading just fine.
---
But how about all those daily quests?! I’m losing Atoms! :(
---
Doubt it, but I don’t Xbox
---
I tried he just downvoted me and ignored it and continues to whine in here.
---
Reviving 20 other players is the last for me.  I’m guessing it has to be 20 on the same character which I know I haven’t done, but 20 spread out I’ve done easily.
---
In the case of it being digital, the software is still good.  Its still intact.  Its the account link that has been banned.
---
spoiler

ISS in this case talks about a raid boss assaultron.

Sometimes you have to dig a little to find them, but they do usually respond.  IMO, this is something the mods here should be addressing (stickies, or something...).  We seem to get a lot of questions about the camera dailies, and a fucking metric shit-ton of mod not working posts on a daily basis.
---
Still able to do a chargeback to get his money back though.
---
You get those materials just by playing the game and looting on the way. Quite a lot at that.
---
I have both, I’ll be on PS4, I can’t haul my desktop everywhere, the PS4 pro however I don’t even need to bring a power cord, I have 2. And I use the Xbox controller for PC. thanks for the advice, I remember my first beer too.
---
Honestly the purpose of this was likely to make Harper's Ferry a more attractive nuke location, not to dazzle us with difficulty. I enjoyed it - with no nuke it's a fun run with lots of lore and atmosphere. With a nuke it's a grinder's dream.
---
Expanding other areas similarly could just making running nuke zones fun again... or at least not as dull.
---
I'll stick with PC then, I prefer the group chats and clan chats where you can add any group of friends into a large chat group all together instead of having to rely on the xbox messenger.
---
Had this happen last night. Confirmed launch and immediately got the controls disabled server unresponsive message. 
---
It's happened to me a half dozen times since  my first launch.  I've resigned myself to the fact that server stability will always be an issue and it's not worth getting pissed any longer.
---
its been an issue since the 16th apparently. they delayed the cameras and stuff but not the challenges.
---
Seriously, if leather was flammable it would not be used by..... welders, blacksmiths, foundry workers, electricians.
---
The camera has not been released. It was pushed back until May. Maybe the forgot to update the quest, but as of right now I am guessing you can not complete them.
---
Find one piece of chameleon sentinel and the 8% that assasins would give you really does not matter at all.
---
I used my mortar strike on one this week. Very gratifying.

You did the right thing. I need to carry more strike beacons.
---
Could have fooled me by claiming I didn't read your original post. I read it which is why I stated that not everyone was legitimately banned.
---
What exactly are you trying to claim I didn't read?
---
Hell yeah Pumpkin Grenade Squad
---
Ok I will
---
I heard it was shit to nuke
---
you realize that Op stated all that in his post?
---
The only QQing I see in this thread are the people crying that he will be getting his money back. LOL
---
Level 112 and I’ve not gotten around to launching one yet lol. Will add it to the list of things to do on there this weekend.
---
Still its just a game, plus what lore breaks this game is how a bunch of bats killed all the original survivors in West Virginia but we a small amount of people in a 24 room vault took it down.
---
Aw men... this SUCKS!! Tks a lot for the answer. I’m was feeling stupid like I was missing something simple and looking for it everywhere. Cheers
---
wow that is the worst hot take of the actual doomsday clock ive ever heard
---
those of us who remember the cuban missle crisis shake our heads and sigh for the generations who have came after who make statements like : *"the kind of thing nihilists or fatalists or whatever created so they could have something scientific looking to point to when they say the end is near."*
---
That was the last one I needed, at least it can be 20 random players.
---
Then a hard reset is what you gotta do, those are nice because it lets you rejoin on your team.
---
It’s still absolutely unacceptable that this happens. I know that server stability isn’t easy to fix, but seriously, it can’t be hard to add an option to rejoin the last server you were in. If you want me to play your game, don’t immediately erase my last hour of progress.
---
Yeah I saw the repair kit sticky, which is an issue they stated they want user feedback on. Curious why the mods wouldnt sticky a bug thread then. Presumably they dont work for Bethesda, right? Maybe they do. I doubt they would post as username "BETHESDAEMPLOYEE1" anyway. I come from being a heavy ARK player which is also a buggy mess, but many of the devs are super active over there and bugs and glitches still get up voted and stickied. Funny, since ARK is still 60 new for xb1 and ps4 and fallout76 is $26 and it's 6 months old.
---
No idea why to be honest, they were always there for me.
---
Ah, see I run it on my pc and have my PC stream wirelessly to my main TV and use the controller with that. So get the best of both worlds, higher resolutions than any of the consoles, ability to use mods, and being able to actually stream it to any of my tv's in the house.
---
So if you prefer not being able to use mods, or stream it to different tv's sure the consoles are passable I guess.
---
And please for the love of God take a look at the map and make sure there are plenty of higher level players on the map! 
---
It seems to me on Xbox higher levels have given up on the event though..because my last few experiences have been a bunch of lower levels who won’t active the conduits. Pretty much useless when no one else higher level shows up either.
---
do to the witch mask, the green goblin is in fallout 76
---
Yes, unequip the card and fuse the two Gunsmith cards together
---
Ny God thank you in trying to get xp then ooh 5 fucking missiles kill a legendary before I can land a hit
---
Yup I agree but just a sad fact of life.
---
For weapons, the Auto grenade launcher heavy barrel does not increase its damage while it is suppose to. as of now it is just a heavier long barrel
---
I didn't know one player can take several. I thought it's one pylon per player.

??!?!!?!? i know im on a video game forum but this type of thinking is the laziest most self absorbed reasoning ive herd in along time

yes.
---
Clearing the silo is only fun the first few times. Bit of a chore afterward. I’ll assume you’re pretty decked out so you likely won’t have any issue soloing one.
---
Go turretless.
---
I get those atoms could have gotten you an outfit for free but there is a reason you can buy atoms. I'm just curious why this is portrayed as such a priority when it really isn't.
---
Whenever you level you can choose any card that you want (after level 50, some cards have level restrictions on them but level  50 is max).
---
Then you have 2 cards of Gunsmith perk level 1. You choose to combine them and you have then 1 card of Gunsmith perk level 2.
---
When you next level you choose again Gunsmith card and you will then have 1 card of Gunsmith perk level 1 and 1 card of Gunsmith perk level 2. You choose the perk level 2 card and combine again and you will have 1 card of Gunsmith perk level 3.
---
Continue until you have Gunsmith perk level 5.
---
This was thought by the game before level 5.
---
That would be such a great wrinkle for the survival game mode.  A series of tunnel dungeons that would allow you to effectively fast travel to areas without train stations.
---
Thank you, too many acronyms for my an old man
---
The Fallout 76 Vaultboy toons can be there also
---
Oh I'm with you on that. In my last case I had posted a thread here so I know the entire server crashed because everyone was booted so even the rejoin option wouldn't have saved us.
---
The camera challenges are gonna be there till the camera update,will you understand this?
---
The real problem is the escalating level of difficulty. We all joked ,but today's one is actually like a joke.  Pvp in a rad storm...sure i get that all the time,so boring.
---
Stack damage, armor pen and range
---
Given the option of freemium vibe to the game , kinda like a phone that only people that pay get those things , and it’s unfair for grinding players which I assume is most of this sub
---
They're banning dupers which there are alot of. If you get banned chances are it was a mistake you can solve by contacting customer service or you are duping
---
With what mods?

Well they might have changed it but you used to be able to have absolute loads

right, hide your head in the sand... nothing to see here! everything is just fine!

geez what am i doing? trying to talk actual real life issues with a person who has no idea of real events 
---
"a scare tactic"
---
my god
---
Seems like the OP is upset.
---
I just got it actually. Reddit complaints always work.
---
Modders dont make games from scratch
---
900 hours guy didn't dupe and had the media even pick up the story, all bethesda did was say he was banned for having too much ammo, even though nowhere in the ToS does it say that wasn't allowed.
---
This is brilliant. I wish I could upvote this more than once
---
Yes, but you are basically able to do that for anything.  However since its the player that violated the TOS and not the company, it would be fraudulent.
---
Upvote. 
---
I did them each twice in 700 hours. The "vox syringer" is another.
---
Yesterday I stumbled into a rad storm in Morgantown. I killed everything in sight. No reward. Pretty frustrating.
---
Thats two days of getting enough junk to sell to vendor and also higher Charisma and Hard Sell Perk will lower it that price too.
---
If you're on PC, check out my [mod's page, just uploaded these classic skins to FO76 nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/290/) \-)) Enjoy!
---
If you put up a CAMP in Whitesprings you are consenting to PVP. 
---
This is known.
---
The Mire is the one zone I still can't get dailies to appear for weeks now, since the Booze patch. Like many I couldn't get any of the zones to pop their dailies. Over the last week or so all the zones now pretty reliably give me dailies, (of course if I D/C with an active daily, its gone for the day). But the Mire still won't give anything to me. Fast Travelling or manually walking to all the locations in the Mire has nothing pop up. Even going directly to where the dailies start does not help. Hell, even for Cranberry Bog dailies, I have to manually talk to the Police-Bot to get it started, no notification to go anywhere like I still get Divide, Ash Heap, Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
I've soft reset, hard reset, even re-installed on my Xbox One with no change. So far using Blizzard support, they asked me to do a reset, and then they haven't responded to my inquiries since. Very aggravating.
---
Damn, bad luck man... ☹️
---
I really thought this subreddit would be more welcoming
---
This is what I hate about the event. Its like the sbq only you waste less ammo. I've litereally got a lvl 5 wood leg from it while the guy next to me was complaining about getting a tse 50 cal.... Would be nice if it was more consistent. This guy is also extremely lucky it didnt' touch him. if that thing even brushes up against me i go flying in the air to respawn lol
---
Everyone gets a set of Ultracite by completing the BoS quest line.
---
You then get free plans to make more from the BoS fortress.
---
No one should be needing to buy a set, unless they accidentally destroyed their own and don't want to gather needed materials.
---
I don't know stealing from others is annoying them either... or maybe it's just convenient for me to say I don't know?
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
Waahhh, Waahhh... Waaahhhhh!
---
Your shit at pvp so you make up some bullshit so that things go more in your favor. Go eat a dick.
---
o.O
---
Do you want me to spoil what dataminers found? Might just be a regular atom shop item but... A chocolate easter bunny head with one of its ears bit off. They didn't find a costume so probably just the head
---
Except that legitimate players were banned for having too much ammo, and nowhere in the ToS does it say having over 100k of ultracite ammo is a bannable offense. So no he may not have broken the ToS.
---
If he was a duper, fuck him. But if he was one of the legit players banned, then yes he absolutely has the right to chargeback the money.
---
hardened receiver is probably best for damage (at least it is on most guns) armor pen is probably the stinging clip and range is barrel. pick your favorite.
---
Exactly.
---
Yes it is.
---
Not much better on one x, I’m afraid.
---
Don't be so scary. It happened to me to except it flew just outside map and then died so everyone was just standing there looking at all the potential loot with no way to reach it.
---
Events scale up with number of players, and I think I've read that one player adds like 10k HP to the SBQ according to datamining. No idea of the numbers on this event, but with 15 people around you, this event would be very hard to 1-man. It's another story when there are only 2.
---
Sadly I'm still a console peasant, but good work!
---
There is a post from earlier this week that may indicate what you get. I am not spoiling it, but if it’s correct, the reward doesn’t get me all fired up.
---
K, thanks a lot!
---
Not since I told him how to get his money back. Why do you think he stopped responding in here? I already walked him through how to call his bank and exactly what to say to get his money back.
---
If you were around for the Cuban missile crisis, not to mention a few conflicts in the following years, you'd certainly be singing a different tune.
---
Don't they still teach kids about 'duck and cover' in school any more?
---
There is certainly ignorance around here.  Mostly the ignorance of youth.
---
Somebody else has said he did admit to duping but ok. You are commenting on everyone who is shitting on op, you're basically defending somebody who has cheated, his entire post history is whining about being banned, face the facts Bethesda are banning people for cheating and duping, simple as that.

I've been using wifi for a while now and rarely have problems with online games. But for Fo76 I can't play for more than an hour without issues. Running a cat5e isn't a big deal if you have a drop ceiling, but in an older house, it's a full project and I'm not opening up walls just so one game can be more stable. There are still massive stability issues they need to fix. I check in once a month to see what has been fixed and wind up becoming frustrated with new problems until I get dropped.
---
Hardened is best
---
Doubt they ever will. Shame too, since there was a car in Fallout 2 AND most of the factions had access to vehicles pre-scorch plague
---
Cool story bro.
---
I like grog axes and flamers but thanks
---
Start PvP in a rad storm then take a picture of yourself?
---
Ah. Thanks. We’ll have to do more testing with that in mind.
---
Less sensitive. With a mouse and keyboard, it's no problem. With a controller, people generally want to move spin and move side to side really quickly, but the course is more about just moving forward on zig zagging beams and such. You don't want to be overcorrecting your path.
---
There was a guy on here a couple of months ago who was a bit older (so am I) and really having a problem with it on Xbox. Changing the sensitivity fixed the issue he was having.
---
But first, go take down those targets, soldier!
---
Thank you! I hope someone will find it useful -))
---
'Decontamination Arch Thought'
---
TBH, the event *is* too hard IMO, I do 1500 damage per hit via power fist, and it feels like I'm the **ONLY** really making a difference.
---
Im kinda mad yesterdays egg didnt appear for me. Only have 2
---
Anti-Armor Legendary effects and perks should also work with energy weapons.
---
Which one? Crafted a level 30 with no scrapper
---
What eggs have we had so far? I’ve got Painted and Flowery, did I miss one?
---
Buy your ammo from a player, it's cheap
---
I'm level 103. I know what I'm saying.
---
Neither do developers sometimes. They just reused the same engine from fo4. The Moders use those same engine to build models of their own to create unique content for the game, sometimes better than the original.
---
Excellent review. I've not seen a better one. One question, do any of the PA mods stack?
---
Nice. Hope you enjoy. :3 find a good community to join. Makes it better.
---
Where did he cheat? You have no proof of that, meanwhile there have been multiple times bethesda has banned innocent people. So why couldn't it happen again? I mean hell they can't even get their daily or weekly challenges right. They have challenges up that aren't even able to be completed.
---
So to act like bethesda is incapable of making a mistake is ignoring the track record they've gained in the last 6 months.
---
I'm all for them banning people who actually broke the rules and duped, but that doesn't mean everyone who was banned was banned for duping. Hell, bethesda themselves even said they banned the 900 hour guy just for having too much ammo, not once did they claim he was duping.
---
If you were wrongfully banned, you wouldn't be bitching up a storm about it and trying to figure out how to get your money back or how to remedy the situation? You are acting like the fact he is doing what any normal person who was wrongfully banned would do as proof that he cheated. That isn't how things work.
---
I'm level 207. I know what I'm saying. See? It works both ways.
---
At least you didn't waste all your ammo to kill it, walk up to it and see a blank window where all the loot should be...this has happened to me a few times in the past month.
---
Many thanks. No unfortunately not. Unless for the headlamp/helmet mod combo but headlamps are technically headlamps not mods :)
---
Why did you not mention any of the machineguns? .50 cal or LMG, are they not heavy weapons? They are not gatling guns or similar.
---
Otherwise yes, good points and hope they will add some variety to weapons.
---
There are almost no conditions or effects you can give to enemies and those are usually a big thing in any multiplayer PvE game.
---
By conditions I mean stuns, dazes, blindness, rooting and such. Only conditions we can do is stagger and knockdown and those only with perks or very few weapons.
---
Weapons which are no longer included in random drop tables i.e. explosive flamers. They we're patched out of the game but still exist
---
Bethesda Please!
---
I have a set of x-01 shock mods and don't even have the armor yet. It was a good vendor day.
---
Still need a t-51b shock tho. Can't find the mod and don't have the flux to make it :(
---
Yeah, I saw those, I'm pretty sure they all were posted earlier this week. I was just posting cause we never heard back other than, "Uh, oops, we'll look into it.". I mean it's pretty obvious now they can't really fix them (or never tried, since they didn't respond back don't even know if that was just to placate us). 
---
But it would be nice to hear a, "Sorry, we can't do much about it." even better if they gave us a few of the atoms we missed not being able to do it as an apology (which would cost them nothing).
---
Even better story is OP getting his money back. :)
---
As three raccoons in a trench coat, I am offended at shiny things that require long arms to reach.
---
Legacy in this context means something you can no longer get.
---
For Fallout 76, it's explosive energy weapons. 
---
Explosive is a modifier that's supposed to only apply to ballistic weapons, so they've currently stopped new energy weapons from spawning while they work on an alternative modifier for them.
---
That stinks I think I have them all but idk I'll have to check
---
Lvl 60 and you’re just figuring out how to combine cards?
---
I don’t think anyone here has any little tidbit of knowledge to give you that’ll help your experiences on the game buddy.
---
This seems to be a central site for everything instead of having to server hop to view individual vendor after vendor.
---
Enjoy that ban fellas
---
Been here since day 1 and I have only had one bad experience with another player.  The vast majority are, almost overwhelming, friendly and helpful.
---
Except for the guy who built his camp in my favorite hidden spot.  I want you to know I crapped in your garden and mixed it in...how them Tato's been tasting? Lol
---
Wont be much of a legacy if we can make our own at the end of may though.
---
I don't mind that, I dislike the random can't spawn ANYWHERE bug. Luckily I don't die alot.
---
Still its just an (unfinished) game. What is the actual lore behind WV in fallout . or are we making lore.
---
When moded, improves sneaking and boost speed while sneaking
---
So your saying you would never use a turret base to make it easier for you to farm and would you take down the turrets when you leave? Also would this still count in Scorch Beast Queen fight that the turrets someone places down will take your kills away? Logic says its a good idea to farm but the lazy butthurt say its wrong to exploit the game that way and making ghouls spawn indefinitely isn't wrong because you kill them yourself. Either be a good person and point cursor over turret to see owner and message the chap whos turret it is to put it away like a good person not a child.
---
Oh I love madlibs!
---
I've seen a single rad storm in the last 100 hours of gameplay. I'm sure I could find one if I actively sought it out, but I feel like this isn't something that will naturally happen. Not to mention, taking a picture of yourself (or anyone) in PvP when so many fights are over in a matter of seconds leaves very little time to even open the games' photo mode.
---
Maybe this one would be easier in Survival? You could just stand out in the open idling in photo mode until someone shoots at you. Not sure if that would count, honestly, I personally avoid PvP as much as possible. But it's the only way I could see it being feasible without hoping your game doesn't lag out by opening a menu. =P
---
I like the idea except I’d suggest leveling twice as slowly and making everything harder.  I can’t stand playing anymore because there’s so little challenge and I’ve explored everything.  I need one or the other, more challenge or more to explore.  Loot grind doesn’t really attract me and that’s what end game is.
---
Do bleeding damage if your using fist attacks in power armor.
---
Challenge yourself with a Berserker melee build.  It doesnt seem OP compared to weightless sentinel AP refresh builds rifle builds.
---
Careful with that, I got a comment on r/Fallout downvoted to -370 points cus I called them snowflakes, lol
---
Good for you. Dismissed, thank you.
---
Awesome, I will be keeping that then :3
---
My friend has the explosive flamer so I told him to keep that.
---
Bethesda literally made fallout 4 from nothing, and tbh they did more than good job. And making new engine for every game wouldn't be profitable, yes?
---
Welcome to the game
---
*sliver of health
---
I just started playing 76 a week ago despite being a hardcore fallout fan. I couldn't get it at release and was watching youtube videos on how bad it was and got completely swept up in the negativity that I let it influence my decision not to play 76 and I feel that I should say that I was foolish to let other people influence me. This game is fantastic so far. It's a beautiful landscape that I find myself just staring out into the distance. All of the players I have encountered are absolute stand up folks that wave and offer trades and drop loot. I have always wanted to be able to share a world like fallout with my friends because, ultimately, the wasteland was truly a lonley place to be. Especially after pouring 100+ hours into building settlements in FO4 and then lamenting the fact that the only people who would see it would have to be sitting on my couch. When I reach high levels I fully intend to pay it forward for all of the newbs. Cuz at the end of the day we all could use a little help.
---
TL;DR - I let other peoples bias prevent me from playing FO76. I did and its the bees knees. 👍
---
Ohh, the game could always use a little more of that. lol
---
Too be honest I have a lvl 100 + sniper , and you really don’t need vats.... just use damage perks, bloody mess, Adrenalin, sneak crit dam perks including the silenced at night one. ( by the way sneak critical perks are buggy in vats)
---
Rifle wise I would use.... i have tried all of these 
---
Handmade - 1 shots about every thing with perforating mag  if sneaking (currently use this)
---
Hunting rifle armor pen mag like perforating .. 1 shot if sneaking ( currently use if target is a long way off)
---
Guass rifle - 1 shot if sneaking (break it out some times for fun but ammo is heavy)
---
Combat rifle haven’t tried it yet or assault rifle,or lazer rifle
---
Mods wise on rifle I prefer instigating explosive while I’m at long range ....  up close I prefer anti armor just in case they see me
---
Legendary mods on Armor wise I would look for bolstering or vanguard , regenerating , cloaking, chameleon 
---
 Reduce weight  armor , chems, guns since you will be low strength
---
Also strength on armor helps carry weight
---
No sentinel or cavaliers... neither work in crouch (sneak) and you are sniper you should not need to sprint because you engage from Long distance
---
Mods wise I use deep pocketed because of low strength 
---
Hope that helps
---
Also, if you're not doing so already, check the suitcases, trash cans, mail boxes, and cash registers at vendor locations. Lot of us drop unwanted ammo at high traffic areas.
---
Brain fart but they to would be hybrid. Rate of fire plus one gun army kinda helps them out.
---
You mean like Big Bend tunnel?
---
I was thinking the same thing, lol. I wonder if taking a picture of yourself works.
---
Cause no way in hell ur getting a pic of someone in pvp.....in a rad storm....or anywhere ever for that matter.
---
Id love to see a video compilation of how many times someone was blown away by another player while trying to accomplish this challenge
---
I don't mean to sound rude, but is it really worth 2k caps? You can buy mutation serums for a fraction of that.
---
Yes - this happened to me this morning while using treasure maps at Soloman's Pond. I am on PC but do not use any mods. I used more than one treasure map at that location. Glad to see that I wasn't imaging things !
---
Could try metal, or possibly warehouse if your ok with rusty walls look. Metal has better protection and don't think I've noticed issues with hanging stuff besides in certain spots, if I remember correctly.
---
Same, last night on PC trying the new quests. No problems at all.
---
I nuked the burrows last night and every single glowing ghoul in there had no hardened mass, glowing mass or high radiation liquid. All they had was glowing blood and meat.
---
Only one legendary too.
---
Luckily there was loads of glowing ghouls and super mutants on the surface that had all i needed. And a couple of legendaries too.
---
Hear hear to this! To date the worst person I've come across shot me without talking to me first to clear my bounty.
---
It’s been 2 months has anyone gotten unbanned yet l. I haven’t been able to play with my friend since February 18th.
---
rofl
---
Legendary spawn rates in a given area seem to be tied to the server somewhat. I'd suggest running Burrows and server hopping until you find a server with at least 3x 2-3 star legendaries there. Nuke that one and run it over and over.
---
The picture has to be with a camera obviously so you cannot take one of yourself. But you may be able to take one of the guy you engaged. But you still need a rad storm first. This one will be reserved for those that have a close friend that can react in a snap.
---
Ok, I knew there will be such posts, so here are some hard facts:
---
No one was ever banned for pure cosmetic mods in FO76. (Please, feel free to post prooflinks with this kind of info. I haven't seen ANY proofs yet)
---
I personally made more than 15 such mods and still use these (and at least 25-30 other mods) since game's release, not to mention hundreds and thousands of downloads on my pages without a single unhappy review or ban report.
---
The PvE fortnite tried to have a text chat, but it became so bogged down with trade spammers that epic turned it off altogether.
---
There is an image up right now on the splash page of fallout 76 when you load the game. That shows the guy in the back wearing what looks like the hot rod paint. Check it out. I'm sure it's coming
---
And almost no one you run into will be wearing a full set....
---
Found a ton of tractor trailers in and around Dyer but can't open any of them....
---
I really love the idea of being able to reclaim the boarded up houses - I think it would be possible for them to add like a little quest to it - since we're supposed to be rebuilding the wasteland. 
---
I think it would be really fun to like claim a house in Flatwoods or other low level places and spruce it up and then invite low levels to your team so they can have ownership of it and have somewhere to travel to.
---
Explosive isn't available to energy weapons anymore. Really doubt they will be available with the vendor.
---
So will still be a legacy weapons.
---
Really miss selling my explosive tesla gun.
---
I've got this mental image of OP lying on the floor in a kitchen someplace, slowly starving because he only eats food that falls directly into his mouth and can't be bothered to sit up and look in the fridge...
---
Not relevant to the picture challenge but i was looking at character challenges and noticed you only get 20 atoms for exploring the wasteland for 7600 hours!! Wtf is that? If i play the game THAT much the atom store should just be free
---
Yeah totally. Someone will pay dearly for it at some point
---
I'd probably cry. My tse lever has been my main for months!! I bought the skin for it in the atomic shop and everything
---
It doesn’t work. I tried it yesterday with the “take a picture of a player wearing fisherman’s clothes while fighting a mirelurk Queen” and it didn’t work. Gotta be ANOTHER player.
---
Nope
---
Was that the documentary? Tbf I completely missed Gary when I played Fallout 3 so after I watched that I bought it for PC since my PlayStation was dead and went back to find Gary.
---
I have these issues and more, namely the persistent ghosts of a player after they die or respawn. These ghosts are very distracting when you are trying to target actual players.
---
I'll try it thanks
---
I had a similar experience, as I emerged from the vault, I was wailing on some of the propaganda robots. Up comes a guy in t-51 armor, with a big ass gun. My first thought, was I am SO FUCKED. Then he walked to one of the dead robots, and did something. Then he started jumping up and down in front of it. I went to look and it was full of boiled water, stims, a pump action shotgun and shells. He then did the thumbs up emote, and buggered off. 
---
I really, really, love the community in this game. Everyone can be so nice!
---
Nope is full off asshole as you can see. Lol
---
Link me to your page?
---
I would love to buy a helmet from you if you can craft them
---
Got my pitchfork ready, just let me fit this burning mod, oh, wait a mo ...
---
One gun army is a must for any rapid fire heavy gun. They feel so useless without it.
---
Also stabilized for armor penetration so you actually will do some damage even.
---
I admittedly have no idea how spawning mechanics work, but I had a hell of a good time nuking the Burrows last night. My camp is just south of Harper's Ferry, so it was easy to fast travel there immediately after launch and I was on the scene right away. 
---
Not only did I find an abundance of super mutants to kill in Harper's Ferry, but there were also a fair amount of roaming glowing ones on the surface. I also went down to the Burrows a few times and got to fight off two separate hoards down there. And, by hoards I mean dozens of glowing ones at once. I just backed into a corner and swung away with my vampire gold club; had to use radaways mid-battle to avoid being over-irradiated. There was nothing but glowing ones in sight, and it was glorious. 
---
In summary, it was definitely the best experience I've had with a nuke. Just one experience, but will be repeating again.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain some detail. I have yet to see how the current system is more ideal than "claim at the bench" since most of the tactical advantage appears to on the side of the invading party. I"ve mentioned many times that my turrets at no point came into play to assist me in countering/defending the workshop against other actual players. That fact in itself is a massive oversight on Bethesda's part. 
---
Also, the fact that invading players can tap into your caps pool om   
---
Adventure Mode" via a direct pvp-specific action that ultimately you didn't opt into is completely asinine and amounts to nothing short of highway robbery built to attract trolls and griefers. Simply "claiming" a workshop should not be construed as a pvp action. In fact, any action construed as "pvp" should be completely re-worked, phased out and dumped out of Adventure Mode. Can I get a Hallelujah. 
---
You can find more unclaimed workshops in any given server for utility use yet the invading part has " have to have YOUR  specific workshop" right at that specific moment that they're forced against all their good judgement to engage in last-resort pvp in Adventure Mode to acquire it.  Server jumping for either party will solve any territory conflict 99.9% of the time. I call bullshit on the current system for workshops. It needs a complete overhaul.
---
Use troubleshooter gear, along with fireproof &amp; refractor perks.
---
They’re a game studio that’s their job 😂 however when they transfer that engine over to an online setting and the game barely works as it’s supposed to and they release it anyway, then that’s a problem.
---
ITS TRUE!!!! WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?!?
---
I dont use op armor with my build. Just random stuff I find. Level 62 mutants 2 shot me. It makes gameplay fun. On my heavy weapons PA build I can just stand there and take hits easily while also one shotting everything.
---
Boring
---
put some dirt in there and you can grow more corn in the toilet
---
I dunno but I had that crashes for 2 days and only now I understood that it’s stupid combination of god damn buttons
---
Anything.
---
I love your name more.
---
One run of the event Breach and Clear in the ash heap should provide enough materials to craft plenty of ammo.  After it’s smelted usually 200 lead and even more steal.
---
This is what I do. Works great.
---
I like the challenge
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking
---
They could use the images from the tattoo magazines you could find in FO4 as posters!
---
Also, all the camera challenges are impossible to do as well because cameras aren't even in the game yet.
---
You literally can’t scrap it, it’s a miscellaneous item not a junk item. You probably scrapped a regular old assaultron circuit board.
---
Yep and started posting tons of threads like "It feels different now, enemies can see me so easily" when in fact it was just normal stealth coupled with the old always in caution bug
---
Now I know to put tape that tells me don't press those buttons.
---
Same here. I like having to sneak around.
---

---
Probably not.  Which sucks. I enjoy the challenges too, but now there's at least two a day I can't do and 2 weekly ones.
---
Yeah... my new character is a pyro because I thought it would be super fun, and I bet it would be if I could make ammo. Here I thought having to make .50 Cal ammo was rough. Boy, I was wrong.
---
People expect the worst because of what they read here, but the negative reports are a very small vs all of the un-reported kind acts like this.
---
My friend who plays the game, every time he sees a level 1 in the vault makes us craft a bunch of things for them and greet them on the outside, its really quite common.
---
I like enjoy reading posts like this.  I, too, was a victim of bullying/griefing early on in the game.  Mostly in the first 2 months of release.  So even now, at level 190+ I am still leery of random team invites or messages.  However, I am a pay it forward person,  and prefer to help than ignore.
---
So last night, just before I am about to logoff for the night, I got a XBox message from a random level 28 player asking for 70 screws.  I was like, "WTF?!?! MUST be doing the quest to get excavator PA!!!. So, I message back and offer about 30 screws.  Thinking was, part of the game IS the grind to get materials.  While I could have easily given him all of them, I figured I'd offer some and then teach him where to find a bunch quickly.  Teach a man to fish, so to say...
---
I invite him to my team, and tell him to fast travel to me at my base on the cliffs halfway between WS and Watoga.   We start communicating over voice at this point and I ask him if the excavator quest was why he needed the screws, and he laughs and confirms that he is.  
---
So I start asking about the weapons hes stumbled across, what armor hes rocking and whatnot.  I tell him, if he trusts me, to trade me a couple of the weapons he uses the most and I'll mod them up for him, knowing that I probably know more mods than him.  He hands them over, and I mod his level 25 gear up, discussing each point,  pros and cons of each change, letting him be involved in every decision.  The entire time he keeps saying, "only if you got the materials" or "as long as it's not going to use all your stuff up". I assure him that I'm good on that front.  
---
After modding it all up, I take him down the cliff to test it out and make sure hes happy.  He sheepishly asks for one change.  I am guessing because he doesn't want to seem greedy.  I take him back to my camp and make a couple changes.  Then I let him know I've got to bounce for the night and tell him to grab all the water out of my purifiers before I go.  He thanks me again, adds me as a friend and tells me he hopes we can run through the wasteland again sometime.  
---
Had a great time helping out a fellow wastelander.  :)
---
Tl;dr  I stayed up about an hour an half past my "bedtime", wanting to pay it forward to a lower level guy, so that he will hopefully do that to a youngster in the future.  Had a great time and glad I did.

If you're set up for sheepsquatch with armor and weapons and chems its easy, if not it's hard. Scorchbeast queen is just an even hard
---
If I’m feeling really mean, nuka mines at the door
---
I can't wait for people to say that they should be reimbursed for atoms lost.
---
Idk I ran into two rad storms yesterday
---
Noticed same thing. Anything under the town did not drop any of the nuked items. All the mobs above ground, even non-glowing ones did drop them.
---
Maybe now the ones who think glowing ones in Burrow was intended, might actually see that BGS never intended insides to be affected by nukes.
---
Enjoy as long as it last, but I'm not optimistic and they might nerf this quite soon.
---
Any word on the poster??
---
This 👍
---
(I know it is an old comment but is cool to see people using the old noggin!)
---
Well I dont  have one so I'm assuming I've scrapped it. I've checked miscellaneous and I dont have one.
---
It is because it has to be done with the new cameras that aren't out yet. Basically any of the challenges that say anything about taking pictures or using a camera are impossible to complete, because they require an item that isn't in the game yet.
---
PUNCHY! PUNCHY! PUNCHY!
---
 I sell my Legendary crap to Wallace mostly. He will have a level 40 Grognak 1* Vampire and a some Medic energy 1* weapon in a while. ;)
---
Hell no.... It's mirklurks I'm having trouble getting. Besides that dogs are found on the upper right part of the map (wolf pack quest)
---
I've lost a couple of weapons and 1-2 armor pieces items here and there over the months of play.  I say with some certainty the item got dropped on the ground.  I don't know what it is, some weird combo while switching weapons with a hotkey and moving or what.  It doesn't involve actually hitting the Drop key.
---
Had it happen for the first time in a month or two earlier this week, but I saw my weight was way down...there was my Trouble Expl Combat Rifle in a paper bag.
---
Bethesda buffed the challenges so it takes more effort to collect in-game atoms. They want us to spend real $$ in the Atom store.
---
Leveling isnt too rough if you have a decent amount of int. 
---
Radstorms aren't too uncommon. Just kinda annoying to find. Clipping through the map textures lets you see rad storm fronts if youre having too much trouble
---
Leader of the pack event
---
There are usually 3-5 dogs when going south by the road from Overseers camp toward the town. Kill, switch servers, kill, switch servers, kill, switch servers, you get the idea.
---
They really need to add an emote to better convey to low levels that you come bearing gifts, not grief. Given the general shittiness of a lot of other player communities, it's understandable for low levels to be on edge when super high level players run up with wild-looking weapons and armor and start doing come hither emotes and shooting at the ground. I remember being uncertain whether or not I was being lured to my death sometimes.
---
Thanks a ton. Enjoy
---
&gt;The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.
---

---
I don't remember them saying it would take a team to clear tbh, I think the expectations were blown up a bit on this sub.
---
And again.
---
Honestly with their weight and actually payoff in dmg i dont think it would be broken just save you 20lbs of heavy weapon
---
I would like a less rude "no"
---
how about the ever obnoxious title, "to the level ___ ____ that ____"
---
No but I do know fusion cores drain really fast.
---
leveling isnt the problem, but all these strange special conditions like wearing a clowns outfit... i mean wtf??
---
What platform are you on? Have you been upping your special or not leveling up at all?
---
Gary for life? =P
---
thats what i feels like to me too.
---
Right? Like what kind of moron company would make an online PC game without in game chat?
---
Don't look at the challenges unless your bored it's better to surprise yourself sometimes.
---
As a Raging Homosexual, I have been very reluctant to play Fallout 76, simply due to Lumbago. So yesterday I finally installed the game, created my character, and stepped outside Vault 76 for the first time. Things were pretty quiet at first, I shitted and camed my pants, but pretty soon, a high level player by the name of xXx\_D0n4LD\_TRUMp\_xXx approached me. He was level 2020 and reeking of Cheeto, and dropped a bag full of aids and sadness, even giving me some sense of pride and accomplishment! I thanked him, and he invited me to a team, and we spent the next couple hours having raging sex behind the Slocum's Joe and having a smoke after together. It was a great experience. We friended eachother, and went our separate ways.
---
Anyway, I guess what I want to say is, thank you, Jrrizzo666YT. You really created a cursed as fuck twitter, despite what all the people who have played for more than 4 hours say. It just goes to show, that even as a Lumbago riddled cripple with no personality other than being a raging homosexual, I can still have fun playing video games on the internet.
---
You could always BE Gary. Run around in your vault suit, a knife, and scream Gary at people

It’s probably the usual 2,147,483,647.

You're not losing them, you're just not gaining them.

I used the same strategy. 17 year old killed it in the first run after I spent hours screaming at the tv.
---

---
I mean you probably are as well.
---
Probably 2,147,483,647
---
they are the only way to get atoms, also i completed the map and im level 123 or something ...
---
Let the new people play and be happy about it. Don’t give them a hard time.
---
Yeah but like I said it starts to add up. What if they don’t fix it for next week too? We are looking for sure at 500-1000 Atoms (Atoms to start buying PA skins)
---
Could we add C.A.M.P. Relocation?
---
In the sense that someone placed a C.A.M.P. And regretted it so now they’ve gone back to rebuild everything at their old place but with a Relocator it defaults your C.A.M.P. back to the previous place it was built (with a maximum of 5 previous locations that can be saved for reuse or defaulted by placing a camp a 6th time, deleting the 1st if not favourited beforehand)
---
it was already open when i came in so i was like "well then"
---
This is how you do it. I love helping out people myself and hearing stories like this.
---
Not if you earn it. That over 900 hours guy that got banned either DID duplicate the ammo or it was a wrongful ban.
---
Maybe even have some footage of the garrahan vs hornwright competition.
---
Lol ppl are still on this dude it was talked about 1000000000000 times. It would change a thing. 
---
P.s. sounds like you got your ass kicked on PvP and now you are posting a Me me me me post. Lol go back to adventure 
---
Learn, adjust, and move forward.

I always imagine the knuckles having some rusty nails sticking out. And that’s what the damage is.  
---
Never used it in fo76 though to see what it looks like.
---
I can.  Just tell me when you are on.
---
I've only gotten the barn building set and the metal warehouse building set from workshops on my  5 characters, never heard of anyone getting the metal one from a workshop (probably not part of the loot pool due to how expensive it is). Brick I don't know tbh.
---
Some day I'll fight a SBQ.  And when I do, I'll probably forget this idea.
---
&gt;Noticed there were two guys already there - great! Three times the spawns!
---
That's....that's not how it works.
---
Bethesda just said he was banned because he had over 100k ultracite ammo. They didn't say he duped, just that he had too much of that ammo.
---
Yeah, outfits are kinda weird. I think last week I had a "level 5 times wearing formal wear". Just threw on a tricentenial suit.
---
thanks for the help, instead of whoever decided to downvote me for asking a question about fo76 on r/fo76
---
It's american culture anymore.
---
"I'm mildly inconvenienced, give me free stuff"
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/PN1si5PJOeo) might be quite satisfying to a lot of you guys
---
I've got over 600 hours right now and I've only seen about 3 Radstorms sadly. I really wish they were more common.
---
Fast travel to the Mountainside B&amp;B. From the spawn point, head down the hill towards the train tracks. Guaranteed spawn of 2 (occasionally 3) will be hanging out by the busted rail cars.
---
Sorry, let me rephrase: I’m losing the chance to get them. ;)
---
Honestly, it amazes me how friendly people are in this game. I've got about 300 hours in it and other than the beta I've been griefed maybe once or twice (which honestly in an mp game is astounding). Hell, the other day I tried to participate in a PvP even though I dislike PvP just for the atoms (I figured I could deal with it for an event at least and maybe it might even be a little different than the usual). The guy who was in tehre with me actually helped me. Despite me accidentally (I think, maybe I missed) hitting him once or twice when I first saw him (he startled me and I thought he was a mob. I knew it was PvP but I was not about to start a PvP unless the other person did. Because this game's playerbase seems so nice I didn't want to assume they were going to gun me down even in a PvP event without proof. And it paid off :) ).
---
You can't apply the new lever action skin to the Sole Survivor so it's not guaranteed that it will work, however sole survivor is a challenge reward and set is a quest reward so they might work differently
---
How do you search for certain weapon type of legendary effect?
---
And today’s Useless Post-Award goes to...
---
I have that but plus one strength... it makes tse’s before the patch look like a rolling pin.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Never mind had to click the weapon / Armor first
---
I put 5 100% cores on me before the event. The event lasted less than 5 min for me. They last alot longer than that.
---
I loved karma, I was pissed when it got removed after finishing Rose’s quest.
---
Personally I would never use a turret to do the farming, it's just lazy ass and selfish especially when you put them on WS lawn you intentionally steal from others. Logic says stealing is easy so everyone should be doing it right? Those who are doing it know exactly what they are doing, they didn't set up their camp there and point the turrets at the club house by accident. I haven't seen turrets being used in SBQ battles, if someone has been doing it good for them, at least they aren't as coward as those in WS.
---
I attacked a persons camp doing this, im on PC so I had no way of messaging them, I got them to add me to a team where I wrote them what the reasons were behind me attacking it and how turret bases are shitty AF, they gave me a thumbs down and left the server, presumably to do it again in another server
---
Mmmhm.... been something Ive been complaining about lately. More threads about this are popping up also. For good reason! The daily challenges are getting more and more ridiculous and specific and complicated just for 10 atoms. Wear a blank hat and a blank outfit while in a radstorm and killing a blank while taking a picture of another player with blank. They need to be more generic as daily challenges. Kill 5-10 enemies, scrap things for 5-10 copper or whatever, drink 10 boozes, sell 100 caps worth of items, claim any workshop, and such like.
---
We did it 3 times now. Honestly looted more legendaries from the supermutants above ground than the glowys under ground. But constantly went under for stable flux mats
---
Yeah after killing a dozen of them you just roll your eyes at those flying fuckwits.
---
I wish...I'd learn how to turn these videos into the holotapes and make a talk show of the appalachian wasteland and hide new episodes all over the appalachia LOL it would be amazing.
---
Frankly speaking, your argument has very little reasoning. How do you know it's India or Mars and not US where the majority of players are? Like I said, it's the job of her attorney. God help the violators if they are in US.
---
Voice analysis is frequently used in court. You can also  match the recording time and server logs.
---
Many attorneys are affordable - just google them. She can also contact *feminist groups* for help which will probably cause all hell to break loose. 
---
I find it strange people put a price on their freedom or even trying to discourage someone to protect their *rights*. I guess the abusers don't want the abused calling the police.
---
Yeah I was told to just leave, and I was planning to, it’s just as I was about to, I saw my chance so I took it
---
Um no.  That’s not been my experience.  The people planting their turret camps behind the golf club know exactly what they are doing.  As a result, they should not be surprised if their “camp” gets decimated.  
---
I shut the doors first, then send a thumbs down emote.  If they stop, great, but that’s maybe worked for me about 20% of the time.
---
Personally I have burned through at least 3 cores doing each event. Jetpack hovering is expensive. I hate when I spend so much ammo and health then get server kicked for dying, no legendary, no fusion cells, nothing.
---
For the leveling challenges, I wait until I’m close to leveling up and then try to meet 3 of the conditions at the time when I actually level up. Like the other day I killed a deathclaw with a protest sign while over level 76 and wearing a Fasnacht mask. 
---
Yesterday’s was annoying though because I had met 2 conditions by leveling up in power armor while over level 76 and I was inside the AMS building in Watoga. It didn’t give me credit for being in Watoga I guess because I was inside a building? 🤷‍♀️
---
Store junk before entering the event. Ive forgotten or been in a rush to get over there and it happens you get jacked. If your fighting you will die at least a few times in that event, so don't even leave it to chance #stashbeforesquach
---
Following...  also interested.
---
You can’t solo the queen. You can do it with other people in the server but that still isn’t soloing it.
---
Really? My camp needs 4 fusion generators.
---
So I never said I did have proof, I simply said someone else said they did, thus rendering you first attempt at an argument invalid, and if they did ban someone who is innocent they might have just done something extremely fishy such as obtaining ridiculous amounts of ammo in minutes, and if I was wrongfully banned I wouldn't be bitching I'd man the fuck up and deal with it like an adult by contacting Bethesda and dealing with my issue properly
---
Are you 5?
---
Fair point lol
---
There's literally another thread above this that's doing the same "thank you random Fo76 player" thing lmao.
---
Yea for a second I thought I scrapped mine, only to find out later that it's not under Junk, but Misc instead, if I remember correctly, so it was still safe after I hit the 'scrap all junk' button.
---
I nuked the place last night and it was filled with level 42-52 liberator bots instead of ghouls. I was pretty bummed.
---
Not available yet
---
You realize that if that tank on your back gets hit by live fire, your ass is going to go up in flames.
---
If it's the guy I am thinking of, he put the email he got from Bethesda on Reddit which had all the details about his inventory. It has since been removed but there is no way he could have amassed that much stuff without  using some exploit. I stand to be corrected on this point but I remember seeing 25k black titanium.
---
I one time had a low level that was using all my crafting stations. Every time he moved to another one I kept trying to get his attention (and i didn't want to leave them if he didn't want them so I wanted him to look). The come here emote, shooting at it, pointing at it, etc. So I finally remembered I had a mic and plugged it in and said, "Hey, there's a bag here with plans in it". That finally got his attention.   
---
But yeah, very hard to get the point across without just talking (and hoping they don't have all mics off or are in a party chat).
---
I’ll test it for you now
---
Yeh, the mire is indeed brokeded.
---
Sadly, what few griefers are in the game would learn that emote and just use it too.
---
This is why in GTA you don't trust people even if they say they are friendly :(.
---
It's a repeatable quest, too.
---
I *think* it qualifies as a Daily, but I don't know if it specifically will trigger every day. So just to play it safe I'll call it every two-days. 
---
It's not a quest I bother with, but I guess if those 'nades induce +100% damage on target, I'll start!  
---
Do we happen to know the duration on the debuff?   
---
Or is it something short like the "Reduce damage output for 3sec", which for a weapon is fine given repeated shots, but a grenade on a boss will mean everyone would need to make it count during that short duration... heh
---
Mad libs?
---
So how did duping mess up your economy? Lol
---
Yeah, you doing weird shit if you need 4
---
Yeah I understand fighting over a workshop, but destroying someone’s camp just seems like a waste of everyone’s resources. I could almost get it back in the day before you could just server hop to replace your camp, maybe if someone else was on your preferred spot and you’re stronger than them... take what you want. But especially now I see no point except to be a jerk or RP as one.
---
I would be VERY Supprised if people could pick them up. I imagine they will work like standard  camp decorations and count towards your build budget.
---
I also image it will be VERY restricted to what you can put down. Pretty much just weapons in display cases it seems.
---
Im gonna grief you and your daughter 
---
Jk i won't do that
---
1 more was added on opening of Burrows, maybe wait until more quests and content is added.
---
Very possible that they are not yet available in the game.
---
*proceeds to farm karma and get gold*
---
I carry an endangerol syringer with me all the time, I started when the sheepsquatch boss came out, since the timer was pretty limited.
---
I probably fought her 25 times.  I used the syringer twice.  I've fought SBQ a number of times since then as well, and never remembered to use it.
---
Use the Bramco Mac and Cheese for the cheese portion....Nothing new to add but the recipe
---
Couldnt agree more
---
When they do this, they're generally xp farming, and they're trying to get away with an easy ride to 50+ at the expense of everyone else. Do not feel bad for destroying their camp.
---
It should also give you a couple minute window to reconnect and not lose claimed work shops.
---
Reimbursed?
---
This is a video game, not a job. 
---
Find something else to do until its fixed.
---
For me it feels easier to attempt a solo sheepsquatch than to do a solo SBQ.
---
SBQ is a bullet sponge and while I'm sure I won't die I don't know if I can solo it. Never tried it tho...
---
Sheepsquatch hits hard as a truck and you do need to activate those pylons but it feels much easier and less tedious.
---
As far as I can tell, Base \* (1 + two shot + hardened) \* (1 + rifleman) \* (1+ bloody mess) works with rounding. Fibblezz only has one rank of Bloody Mess in his examples.
---
Hardened is certainly the odd one out in the ESM. The others are all 1+x multipliers.
---
Even with most of the server being 100+ you still have people who dont know what to do
---
I used it on a queen yesterday. Didn't really have any effect.
---
Take my -1 you sexy mole man!
---
Yes. Last night I claimed a power plant and then immediately lost connection.
---
It will be an extra 140-210 atoms (somewhere between there since some times the challenges are 20 atom challenges) by the end of the week. Seeing as the most you can get at the end of the week if all challenges can be done is 420, that's a significant chunk.
---
It’s been two months has anyone actually gotten unbanned yet. I haven’t been able to play with my friend since February 18th.
---
The game is visually stunning. There are no NPCs, but you do hear their voices via holotapes and the voice acting is top notch. I'm only a few hours in, but there's enough quests to keep me busy, in addition to the constant hunt for food and water.
---
Priming both the Ultracite Gatling Laser (UGL) and the Gatling Laser (GL) converts the receiver into one that requires Ultracite Fusion Cores.  It's just the UGL that has the extra bonus damage from being a native Ultracite gun that in addition to the bonus damage from having a Prime receiver.
---
There are a number of locations in The Whitespring where a camp can be placed without impacting the spawns.  The location behind the golf club is the only common one that causes problems.
---
As with almost everything (ratings, reviews, feedback), what you see is skewed towards the negative but a huge percentage. People tend to go out of their way to complain, but don’t post anything if they are satisfied. People aren’t bitching if they’re in the game playing.
---
It's always the same thread.
---
[Name it the Beast](https://www.snappytomato.com/menu/beast-style/)
---
Exactly
---
I’m on PS4 and believe it was a Stalkers War Drum.
---
Someone on my server launched a nuke and it froze the server - luckily we didn’t lose the server.
---
This brings me great happiness. I'm going to spend the rest of the day trying to work this into conversation.
---
It’s going to be a shelf, like the bobble head stand, where you tag items from your stash, like the fermenter, for display.
---
Real shit? I'll check as soon as I'm home
---
Well I have 30 industrial water purifiers and about 20 water purifiers that go on dirt
---
No prob, have the mutation but don't use it as I always have armor on. Many mutations have zero downsides so you can choose to what you want and at the moment I'm not even running the Class Freak as the only downside it affects from my 6 mutations is INT -4
---
What a spledid pie piecce of pizza pie.
---
Great idea. And murfuit as pinaple unless the add a new fruit or canned pinaple lol
---
“How do people learn from the mistakes?”
---
It’s not Bethesda’s (or any company) responsibility to provide life lessons to its customers. If you didn’t learn by the time you were 5 years old that cheating is wrong and have enough moral character to simply not do it, then no additional learning is going to help anyway. 
---
They were crystal clear in the communications I’ve seen. When duplication exploits are gone, you’ll be reinstated. Apparently exploits are still being used, so your suspension will continue.
---
Yeah, but they did from fallout 3 to new vegas
---
PvP? Handmade.
---
Anything else? Also handmade
---
&gt;Tide pods anyone?
---
I might be able to craft you one. I’ll be back on in half an hour
---
Oh, xbox, thanks anyways
---
Because you can buy those atoms this comes off as extra sleezy. They can give you this, "You can work for the atoms" while making it even less reasonable.
---
Honestly, I'd have preferred they not even let you work for the atoms, keep anything non cosmetic off the atom store (Which they are planning on putting non cosmetic stuff in btw), and not try to pretend tehy aren't making this grindy to get the atoms. Hell, I'd prefer if they kept it at least cosmetic only (then at least I would just buy the atoms honestly, but out of principle I'll not give them money for atoms now that they went back on that and if the game gets too grindy, I'm out. It's already grindy enough with the few atoms they let you earn each week, nevermind when they mess up and make it even less).
---
Would love some photos
---
There is a space station though
---
I nuked Harper’s Ferry yesterday just to run the Burrows while nuked. You’re correct, the mobs down there won’t drop any flux stabilization materials. I think the whole point of it was to possibly create more legendary spawns and get better drops. I personally didn’t experience this. There were a lot of bloated glowing ones, but I didn’t get any legendary spawns. It was about the same as normal. 
---
However, above ground I got lots of flux and materials from those spawns.
---
CROWTIEN *CAWWWW*
---
Yeah exactly, it takes like 2 full minutes for the damn thing to load the music and its always off when i come bac to the camp
---
*comes in with a ragged blanket over their back shaking a tin cup* "Caps for a poor level 44?"
---
You didn’t find any? I nuked Harpers Ferry on survival last night and found only one high rad fluid and glowing mass in the dozens of ghouls we killed.
---
1000 caps?
---
I think im more annoyed at the fact that they feel its fine just to ignore half the posts cause theyre questions that bethesda employees dont want to answer, thats not right at all. A complaint is a complaint and they should have to respond.
---
My bottom floor is locked, which is my living area &amp; fusion generator.  My workshop is on the top level and open.  If you have marsupial or the jet pack you can get up there easily and use whatever you need...and enjoy the view.  I also have a speakeasy...if you can figure out how to get in!
---
But that's how rarity works. Not everyone can get a shiny Charizard but there are a whole lot of shiny Machamps.
---
Lmao! So true, I  keep getting the same dammed plans over and over again. I honestly thought this issue was supposed to be resolved, and I  thought Bethesda said there would be better looting a few months back, not the case I guess!
---
Are you talking about the wendigo one?
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/U0qVFRJ here is a picture snapped off my phone. That's the hot rod right if I remember from f04
---
“Waaaahhh stop having fun”
---
I wouldn't even just focus on the radstorms or even the camera. At least the camera ones seem reasonable once it comes out. The nukashine ones, make 50, consume 50 seemed like I would spend all day. Of course as one who hasn't done the quest yet I don't really know. 
---
And now the level up 3 times one are becoming difficult. Fewer and fewer are able to overlap, over level 76, under level 20, in TOW, in Watoga, idk even what is considered sleep wear. The bathrobe?
---
That's surprisingly expensive.
---
YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!
---
But upvoted because you are right. I only go after the turret camps anyway, and those are pretty much always behind the club house.
---
I am using my excess caps to buy bulk ballistic fiber, the recall card, and stimpaks (for the ISP fight). I have soooooo much ballistic fiber.
---
I went back and re-read this very, very slowly for immersion effect. :)
---
Look on the bright side, it could have spawned dozens of commie bots instead of ghouls like the nuke I dropped last night. Unlike ghouls, they don't drop glowing meat or blood, and for some reason they weren't dropping mass or fluids, so all I got for my trouble was a couple trash legendaries and a bunch of steel scrap.
---
Is there such thing? All you need to do is farm some by the power plants 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’ve done it a few times, and by myself (arguably worse because you can’t get back to your farm if the connection breaks)
---
which other ones have 0 downsides?
---
Twisted muscles is the one I'm really looking for. I work night shift so I won't be on until like 1 am. We can do this over the weekend.
---
Damn it, I completely spaced and forgot about the sbq. Guess that shows how often I run her. :(
---
LOL @ #stashbeforesquach... but yeah I love this event best one By far... 2nd IMHO was Mask thingy... Bots is not bad for fun again IMHO rest are MEH...
---
This was an oversight because of the push back with the camera. A problem on a weekly challenge that will go away on Tuesday. That is making a huge fuse and causing you to acuse them of sleazy practices. I just feel like this situation is someone making a problem over nothing.
---
Come on those are easy...we should hope they were all like that.
---
The new one are a mess, photos of people with sunglasses in nuke zones,radstorm everyday.
---
At this point i even liked the alchol ones.
---
Thanks man, but I'm taking about the hot rod shark, the one you find a magazine for on the atom cats garage http://imgur.com/gallery/Zge13Ei
---
Dear lord, no. You won’t.
---
This week's encryption offers 2 possible codes. How did you determine which of the two solutions is the right one?
---
Is there a rule that you can follow or have you just taken 2 cards in the silo?
---
I love finding low level players and dropping a bag of plans and ammo at their feet.  Unfortunately, most of the low level players run away from me.  I don't know if it's cuz I'm level 60 something and they're level two, or if its because I'm dressed in ritual rags with a skull over my face and am wielding a power fist.  Either way, please don't run.  I want to give you goodies.
---
Yeah the "limited time" is just to create urgency to make you spend on atoms. They'll all cycle back in eventually most likely.
---
Just for clicks sake

The start of event, the delay times seem like they have quite a bit of variability built in, I've never seen the time between ISS showing up and the activate the pylons starts, I wonder if this is some of the issue that confuses people and they don't help?
---
Oh I see sorry about that
---
No it doesn't. I've done that quest on 3 different characters, and every time I just ran around the area rather than staying in the hut.
---
um, im the one advocating the relevance of the clock in this thread, i specifically referenced the cuban missle crisis above, and now the nationalistic chest thumping hawks are back in power and the arms race is back, and now we even have hyper sonic rail weapons to deal with, plus threats of industrial/cyber sabotage of nuclear plants from across the globe
---
its not a meme and its not inaccurate
---
135 here and I'm still surprising myself with Adams I'm addicted to my mini gun sounds that muffled my enemies screams.
---
Yeah, I think Wendigo came with Burrows opening.
---
Call me when they bring the blackbird skin back.
---
The pressure plate is useless. It only works on foundation level and just generally feels out of place :/
---
I usually mount a switch on the inside so I have a toggle.
---
You can still exit if you're fast enough :P
---
I already got it. It’s on my wall of heads.
---
And the thing is your first character build is the one you mutt build and do everything wrong on and end up abandoning. He'll still get to explore and all that good stuff, just when he's made all the mistakes. I'd do it.
---
It's more of a joke/tracking challenge than a proper one. Besides, don't want to encourage idlers by making the reward decent.
---
Oh that would be great then! Would be nice to give these shelves a real purpose! 
---
Now I wonder if we'll actually be able to use the magazine racks for magazines - since they currently count as a "stash."
---
for the penitentiary, which armor bench?  I found 2 in a building in the yard.. is there another?
---
I don't really wanna farm tho
---
smokin banana peels! nothing is real!
---
*tips hat to dead milkmen*
---
Yep, dont need that.
---
Are they going to reimburse you for the free things that have been delayed?
---
Ermmm... nope.
---
My man!
---
Considering the usual time it takes for people to join anything(even rare events), i believe the storm would be already ended. They last like 2 
---
real minutes.
---
I joined a workshop defense event and there were 5 feral ghouls left to be killed and they were outside of the event area and attacking a player's camp. The player had those big concrete walls and the ghouls had already destroyed the bottom portions. I sniped them and somehow hit the wall and instantly became wanted. So stupid. I just fast traveled to White Springs then went afk for a few minutes and came back and was killed.
---
Sorry I didn't see this til now, i will be home in an hourish. Will make one asap. Usually I get a push notification for reddit. Guess it's been weird lately
---
It depends specifically on how you want to play, I mean best armour hands down is Heavy BOS Combat Armor but very hard to get a full set of at the moment and is quite heavy, second to that would be Polymer Forest Scout Armor and much lighter compared to the former mentioned set.
---
Perks in general rather than specifically I would advise to build around the amount of damage you want to deal and negate, for example unarmed weapons do better than one handed melee so use iron fist perk and talons mutation to milk to damage or the Ironclad perk and Grounded Mutation to receive a combined 100 energy and damage resistance at max rank when not using Power Armor.
---
But if you want something more specific there is a link to a character build simulator to fiddle around with and figure out in theory what works best for you here;

Up until 76 I played as male and avoided using a mic on due to harassment from the typical asshats. I’ve been fairly open using the mic in 76 and haven’t had any real issues yet. The fellas I’ve encountered have been pretty chill. Also, I seem to be hearing a lot more women’s voices than in other games but I usually greet first so maybe once the “mic off gals” hear me, they respond.
---
I think I'll have to pass. If I don't end up using it in my rifleman build I'll let you know.
---
Aww it would be disappointing if they're too limiting. I hope we can at least place junk or misc items maybe.
---
Hopefully they'll give us a little budget increase when they release it!
---
Same with WS, as soon as the nuke dissipates the glowing ones won’t drop mass and fluid, only glowing meat. The mechanism makes them only available when dead bodies are exposed to radiation, which isn’t available in the burrows.
---
Serendipity in luck, dodgy in agility, and bodyguard in charisma are pretty popular. There are also some good DR/ER boosters in endurance.
---
Maybe a "Furious" .50? Damage increases with each consecutive hit. I have one hanging out in my stash. May give it a try. Cryolator works wonders too, as far as holding the Impostor back some.
---
Took you 25 minutes... Hahahahaha
---
Weird, it honestly reset for me, had to go back to the terminal to restart it. 🤷‍♂️
---
Appreciate the post. I found the holo at Toxic Larry's; but, I am confused about the second. Boomer is in Watoga, which has hotels, versus motels. Have not found the note at either place, Harper's or Watoga. Likely just a rng spawn thing. Nonetheless, you mentioned the Mire, so I'm guessing you meant Harper's, not Watoga?
---
Well it really doesn't help that this follows after they went back on their promise for cosmetic only (and they definitely have not responded to that one). And that it is noticeably that the challenges are getting harder (a very well known F2P tactic). And are going the way of a lot of F2P games (and MP games trying to follow the same path). Make game grindy, pay to avoid the grind. And don't tell me they haven't done that, you can follow the money on how every other game that has non cosmetics to know how they'll use this. It is way too lucrative (balance game badly to be frustrating enough to just pay to skip. And yes, there are several ways they can rebalance the game to sell repair kits).
---
I do. I supply the wasteland with food and water and trust me you get lots of caps from water.
---
The spinning racks and yellow upright stands practically  already work in FO4 like the fermenter. 
---
I’m glad you’re excited. I was hoping to be able to drop, a rifle on a table, or put a plate down with a steak on it. But I don’t expect that’ll ever happen.
---
The root cause of the problem is the same root cause of the weight.limit problem: Fallout's  players' learned behavior. 
---
We learned to loot everything we could in prior games. We learned to store and stash the junk. We learned that the only way to gain an advantage at lower levels was to have the best equipment, which means materials and caps. We learned that best settlements required tons of building supplies.  We were trained to be horders. 
---
No we can't accept that after a certain point, we don't need the caps.  Having 500 units of asbestos isn't going to me any good, ever. I've got a pretty nice load out, buying something better isn't going to make the game that much more fun. 
---
 "Just let go!"  Tyler Durden
---
Up vote for Cheryl reference !
---
I run a no power armor build and so do alot of people. It works much better if you are interested in PvP at all. Depending on what exactly you are running I would say Iron Clad is a good card to have
---
Three words, civil asset forfeiture.
---
Carnivore/Herbivore (food is abundant and available all over) and perk does not affect this.
---
Electrically charged/Unstable isotope (does little self damage) Perk does not affect this to my knowledge
---
Speed Demon (increase food consumption) Perk does not affect this
---
They do have downsides, but to my opinion they are very minor and the Class freak has no effect on them.
---
Come to think of it - it would be nice to have those magazines back in the game so we could find some in game tattoos / hair styles. Would be a nice way to introduce new styles without having to rely on the atom shop all the time.
---
Dude I wish they had this in the west coast
---
You can get 1400c worth of trash from mobs in 15min. Why bother?
---
I hope op is trolling
---
420 I see what you did here Bethesda
---
That appears to be correct. Several perks and effects are added to the value STAT\_DmgAll, which is eventually used as a 1+x multiplier. Mostly-complete list:
---
Adrenaline (perk)
---
Bloody Mess (perk)
---
Revenant (perk)
---
Adrenal Reaction (mutation)
---
Psycho (chem)
---
Overdrive (chem)
---
Mutant's (legendary weapon ability)
---
you aren't going to make a counter?
---
Honestly sometimes you get two solutions and you have to just guess which one is right. I don't know if anyone else out there knows of a proper way to figure it out so it might be worth creating a thread and asking. I know I would be interested to see what methods other people use. 
---
When in doubt you can try double checking other sources to see what hey have. Chances are if two different places have the same codes then that's the correct one. Good luck!
---
I got really excited when we went into the Burrows for the first time and found that mounted Deathclaw head - I was hoping there could be like a Deathclaw burrow down at the end but sadly no. Hopefully they release more soon. I've been wanting the taxidermy since I found that lodge in the Toxic Valley.
---
I dunno man... wet farts are pretty hilarious, just not so much for the person creating it since a mess likely occurred in the process, which in turn their discomfort/humility only makes it all that much more humorous :P
---
In this instance, it is a fair comparison to a wet fart for *you*, but unfortunately there was no funny to be found for us even if you meant for there to be (regardless of whether you actually downvoted).
---
For humor, not that I'm an expert and have had many similar "wet fart" situations of my own in life, I'd have approached it differently --assuming you weren't downvoting-- by saying something like:  
---
*"Genuinely helpful criticism for players??? How* ***dare****....*  
---
*DOWNVOTED!!"*
---
Or just \[/s\] heh
---
This was confirmed with the hunter camo skin. No point in purchasing for the limited it's not limited only limited time. Only purchase from the atom store if you really really really want an item.
---
Where’s you eat the death law head??
---
I would however I probably will use it in my rifleman build.
---
Kinda makes the shelves I’ve already placed feel a little bit redundant in that case, however the excitement and likely the lack of disappointment far outweighs the current concerns
---
I know it feels like a kick in the teeth to drop a nuke and waste it.  However, my brother and I got lucky and I nuked the burrows and no one came but him and I.  We did 4 full runs through there and I forced the spawn each time.  Took us 30ish minutes or so.  Got a ten of legendaries maybe 20 total.  Every single one of them were one stars.  I’m convinced Wes Tek is the best farm for high star legendary loot.  Nuke zones IMO are only good for flux material and glowing bloods for vendor trash.
---
It's been previously suggested and already confirmed that it will be a thing. Ever hear of Seasons in Diablo 3? It's going to work like that. New start for everyone, survival mode only, will probably have seasonal rewards for completing challenges like killing SBQ, killing certain # of players in pvp, survive for certain amount of time, etc. The sky is the limit with what they do with it really. I'd expect seasons to last 2 months or so.
---
Isolated Cabin, south east of Vault 76, always 3-5 mongrels spawn here consistently ..
---
like that silver excavator skin. i love it.. partially because it turns off those red lights on the arms.
---
has anyone seen the flatwoods monster or the mothman lately, i haven't seen either since christmas although the grafton monster is pretty common
---
They aren’t the only way to get atoms. The continued work of the developers and server hosts have to get paid somehow.
---
I just want a car like original Fallout with dog or Pikachu.
---
You can set up CAMP up by the hunting lodge that has both a junk heap &amp; lead source.
---
Then go claim the munitions factory. You might have to build a fusion plant, or go power up Monongah. It's also got several other resource dumps if you feel like wiring them up.
---
Go do your thing while those places do their thing, then come back and reload.
---
Gt CycloPhile  ...on right now
---
Class freak 3 negates 75 percent of the negatives. You will still have negatives to your specials and other things affected by mutations, but it is minor amounts.
---
It has a cloaking device, that's how.
---
&gt; stopped gaming to play with his kids on hot mike.
---
Hello yes officer this comment right here
---
Mothman spawned at my camp the other day. Startled the rads out of me!
---
1500
---
They've already confirmed adding an optional seasonal mode to survival in a future patch. If you don't like it, don't play on it. Go somewhere else with your toxic attitude and ebayed / duped gear.
---
It would be nice if they dropped stable flux.
---
Also, they need to up their plan drop rate.
---
Bethesda, please give out 2000 atoms for the invisible camera challenges.
---
Rusty knuckles or hydraulic bracers on one arm. Tesla bracers on the other. Appropriate mutations, and voila, you’re doing 100+ damage with your fists in power armor. I use it on One Silent Night. Still not sure exactly what the bonus objective gets you, but it’s fun.
---
You have summarized my new outlook nicely.  There have been times when I bought borderline limited time items in case I regretted not buying them later.   But no more.  I will just buy things I unquestionably like....and every weapon skin ever.
---
In addition to Fisher site prime there should be other legendary creatures like the Scorched beast  queen! 
---
Why not make it so no matter where you nuke you will be up against a 4 star legendary creatures and make the battle last for duration of the nuke zone, well it's still hot! 
---
In my opinion this what makes the game fun, everyone comes together and we all work as a team. Instead of killing each other for amusement. 
---
Just imagine 100's of glowing ones chasing everyone around with some other 4 star beasts trying to kill you, I think it would keep everyone on the edge of their seats. 
---
The game need more frequent battles like this. Or a string of missions tied into one another that last for hours with this same mindset, with enclave doing random nuke launches all over the map. 
---
You can only craft so many different types of  moonshine and alcohol. Let's bring more action back to the game.
---
Yes! I used to love working on decorating my settlements in FO4. It wasn't perfect but at least we could decorate with items we found! I miss those little shops we could place down for the settler's to use - like the Weapons / Medic shops? I think it would be nice if we get the option to place those in our camp with player vending, so people kind of know what you have! 
---
I am trying to stay positive about the game and be hopeful for some things. I was hoping to do things like that as well - kind of create your own little environmental story telling in your camp!
---
I also have around 40 grenades, some of them nukes, pocketed throughout 5 pieces of armor.
---
I tested armor piercing magazines on Watoga robots a few patches back, and they worked correctly then. DR reduction doesn't do anything beyond a point though, and AA+Tank Killer+Magazine can easily hit that point, especially if you're running bloodied.
---
karazhan was, brd was just a dungeon. But they both are examples of good design in both a mechanical sense and a thematic/atmospheric sense. 
---
Bethesda would do well to study them a bit.  It's not an entirely appropriate comparison, due to fundamentally different gameplay mechanics, but in broad strokesthe design philosophy is applicable.
---
They used to have one years ago that they advertised as being 10 pounds....wasn't that good, but the rest of their selection is not bad.
---
Just be aware that these are client-side only. No one else will see them.
---
This leads me to believe at least one person has tried it with a troubleshooter's gamma gun.
---
I've completed it once. Got a legendary wooden right leg for my 2500 caps. What's the point?
---
Bleed dmg if you use unarmed in power armor. Unfortunately, it’s almost impossible to make a go of unarmed in power armor in this game. You could almost beat everything in FO4 with PA unarmed, but it’s just not viable like it used to be, and it was already pretty weak last game. I miss power training and power attacking a flying opponent.
---
&gt; \- Have Gatling Plasmas deal half conventional and half energy like Plasma Guns do, to me it was weird that Plasma Guns Fallout 4 and 76 deal both but the gatling version doesn't, it would also help it stand out more instead of just being a stronger but more inaccurate Gatling Laser. 
---
This is a really bad idea because it will directly NERF gatling plasmas. Having split damage means less of the damage goes through DR, due to how armor in Fallout 76 works.
---
Bethesda support for FO76, and the way they handle this game in general, is horribly shit, so while it might not take a month for everyone I still wouldn't expect them to respond in what's considered a timely manner in literally every other online game made and maintained by a AAA company. Not even EA is that garbage and, quite frankly, that's saying something.
---
No no I didn't get it - I found it mounted on the wall in the burrows. I am sorry for not being clear! I was hoping since there was one on the wall that it would be a reward from the burrows but it wasn't.
---
You act like they made this game out of the goodness of their own hearts. You do realize they want to make money, right? And that we all already paid for this game (hell, I paid full price even and I'm not complaining about that. And I'd probably give them more money if they didn't do the BS that is repair kits can be bought in the atom store. I honestly was thinking of maybe buying some atoms this week until bethesda pulled that BS off. let me guess, you defend them for that too &lt;- and by the way, I mostly defended Bethesda until that point. I still think it is a decent game but I'd really hate to see it get like GTA where there are obvious frustrations put in there just to get you to pay more. A good game that has a lot of purposely done bad game design that could be even much better if they weren't trying to purposely make it frustrating in a certain way. It's way more annoying when it is on purpose because you know they are making the game bad to manipulate a certain mindset (usually gambling type people) into paying more.
---
Oh
---
I understand what you're saying.  I just think you're wrong.
---
When they go back to teaching elementary school kids how to deal with the issue, I'll start to believe it's serious.  Even in today's hyper-sensitive atmosphere, no one is really taking the threat nearly as seriously as the people who taught stop drop and roll, and built fallout shelters in their backyards.
---
It also helps a lot that back then, news was disseminated by much more fact-focused and neutral news sources compared to today.
---
By the way, I'm fairly recently removed from involvement in that arms race you speak of.  If that was really still a thing, I'd be long retired.  And your rail weapon fear is completely unfounded, it's a non-issue.  Espionage/sabotage issues are real though, if moderately overblown in the current world situation.
---
Updated the website so that two-shot is calculated via the unmodded base damage. 
---
Also I'd think the game truncates the two-shot and hardened mod values (17), but then the subsequent multiplications are done with full precision. Also it seems the bloody mess (and adrenal reaction and adrenaline) is applied before mods and two shot so the numbers are a bit different:
---
floor(70 x 1.05 x 1.25) x 1.6 + floor(70 x 1.05 x 0.25) x 1.6 =
---
91 x 1.6 + 18 x 1.6 = 146.4 + 28.8 = 175.2
---
The workshop closest to death law island sometimes has 4 waves of dogs that you have to kill to take over workshop
---
No need to be a dickhead, i like to take my time.
---
All around true.
---
🤣
---
I am hoping we will be able to use the display shelves, I know I've seen player vendors that already have them set up in their camp ready to place items on which I think would be really neat. 
---
Personally I really like that white display shelf too - would be neat to put knick-knacks in!
---
Pretty sure the plan is ~2500 from the vendor iirc, so that would make it worth it.
---
I would like a LoL emote please.
---
Yes they went back on their promise but has anything noncosmetic been put in the atoms shop? 
---
Is the inside the vault articles that talk about the repair kits in even still posted on their twitter??
---
They have not actually gone back on any promises yet. 
---
Ever since the inital announcement there has not been more said about the repair kits
---
please for the love of god, don't use "ISS" for the sheepsquatch. There's already an ISS in the game.
---
Deathclaw island drops gears, doesnt it? Pretty sure it can be server hopped
---
What level are you? I used to find a bit of grind for ammo at a certain level, but I'm in my high 30s now and it's not a problem anymore. Are you a lot lower or a lot higher than that?
---
There are places you can grind. Whitesprings is popular but I like to hit the lucky whole mine, top of the world, places like that.
---
McRib is back for limited time only!
---
It was mostly the pictures of the burrows they released with the teaser stuff, but i guess im just a little more equipped than i thought i was. I kinda just wish it was bigger
---
Non-PA builds are common. It can allow much more freedom with perks not relying on PA, and some perks don't work in PA at all like Marathoner. I have 400 carry weight and 41 strength out of PA, and it's way better than any version of PA could be. The fusion cores are a pain to carry, plus the game is randomly deleting them when it crashes. I still carry one of my 7 chassis for certain things, but it's mainly useless now.
---
I think there was the one yesterday that didn’t pop up for me.
---
I haven't found this watoga place yet, buy everything I've read here has me excited/terrified to find it.
---
It’s just beyond careless and sloppy. It’s just one big shoulder shrug at the players. I was pretty stoic throughout the initial bugs the first few months because corporate rushed the game. Now I think they just don’t care. Especially after this and the mod problems.
---
Depends on your build. My bloody HW build only crafts ammo once a week or so,  but I do a lot of random stuff; if I was launching nukes or killing sheepsquatch regularly I could see needing a lot more ammo. 
---
A bloody build with a bloody or instigating Gatling gun is veeeeery ammo efficient. Craft large batches of ammo at a time, still do enough damage to 1-3shot most enemies.
---
Bloody stealth sniper with a bloody/instigating lever action is even better- .45 ammo is really common in the game world.
---
And so delicious each time.
---
Ah yeah it does but that's just from the single deathclaws, but hey thanks for reminding me that Deathclaws drop them!
---
At that point just enjoy, explore and have fun levels will start to come quickly as you grow stronger and get more xp from higher level enemies.
---
Or you can go to whitespring and slay ghouls there especially when its been nuked
---
It never works for me, that's why I use a mod for the jukebox that replaces it with the Vault 76 radio music. My camp is always pumping out tunes now 🎵
---
I genuinely thought that ISS stood for the International Space Station and was wondering what the fuck but then realized oh, Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
They arent in the game. Please use the search feature for the love of god
---
A lot higher.
---
Thanks for this, suppose it's worth using on the HMR then. I was curious because it severely reduces ammo capacity, so it would need to be a big boost to be worth having to reload much more often.
---
Did someone say we where getting a pet?
---
Mainly because 90% of them aren't on reddit.
---
This is what I usually explicitly state in all my mods' descriptions, yeah.
---
PVE lever. PVP handmade.
---
Same with me I got one from enclave but can’t equip it. They shoulda fix the mad bug last week. Getting old not bein about to attach mods.
---
I’d consider it a very nice thing for any bloody HW build since most also include explosive perks. But I might be the minority- I carry fat man/missile launcher/autogrenade and use them all regularly.
---
Why removed:(
---
We do some damn fine grenade throwing with the south paw.
---
Oh sorry I already got someone else to sell me one. Thanks so much for offering though!
---
ugh that happened to me last night. I was inside that building and it didn’t count as Watoga. so frustrating
---
No, no one anywhere is selling a level 50 lever action rifle.
---
I got a Prime Receiver, T-60 Jetpack plans, and T-51 jetpack plans after 110 hours in this game. I may have gotten lucky but as tough as Scorchedbeasts are even high level (screw you bloodied builds), this isn't good. We need more rewarding loot like screws or aluminum just not ultracite only as some people don't even use ultracite too much.
---
Oh I know, I saw it on your page. I’m just putting it here too because I can see people reading your post, and going straight to the download page.
---
I also got two quests once. Can't really consider any bug here since both quests  an be completed and turned in all fine.
---
*And your rail weapon fear is completely unfounded, it's a non-issue*
---
ok, i can now discount your arguments, you obviously have not been keeping up with real life events, the arms race is real and happening again globally

It was by the arena with the raider power armor in the middle. Down that street/corridor. There are always at least 2-3 places where plans spawn.  If you don’t see/find any plans, it means someone already got them. And to this day, I’m still looking for the bos plans for the arms and legs.
---
Sorry, but no. Just because YOU don't have or see a use for it, doesn't mean there isn't one. It's the best sneak armour in the game, it's lightweight, and is incredibly cheap to upkeep.
---
if you pack up your camp and redeploy it all the stuff will be fixed at no cost to you, fyi
---
This game is becoming easy mode. But you all complain about burrows being easy lol
---
This needs to be a thing.
---
It was never “unplayable” on PS4, and it’s better now than it ever has been. If you’re truly interested in it, then you’ll probably enjoy it. I would still wait for it to go on sale though, as the price seems to drop often, and I wouldn’t want you to spend more money than you have to.
---
Thank you. Are there any particular quests you would recommend me doing? I find my biggest issues are that I often run out of ammo for my favorite weapons and I often find myself overwhelmed by tougher enemies or large groups of hostiles.
---
If you havnt done the main questline yet thats a good place to start. Biv's daily gives me 400xp a day, and sheer terror questline gives like 3-4k xp for its completion.
---
High int then farming enemies is an optuon as well. Popping a berry mentats before completeing Biv's quest awards an additional 40 xp ime
---
Yea I figured it out the other day. I’ve been checking there and the blown out building near grafton mills
---
Personally I compromised with the 35-round magazine with the 20% DR reduction. Was plenty to kill landed scorchbeasts without having to reload in the middle.
---
If your playing alone it might be worth putting some point into the lone wanderer. Also sleep often to gain well rested for extra bonus and if you do the mama dolce event you can get food which gives increased xp gain
---
lol who is saying that it is new?
---
all video games that have "doors" that lead to new spaces  have worked the same forever
---
but for Fo76, its new that they can just pop in new dungeons!
---
Oh,ok. The link above is for the title page which shows mod's description, though.
---
No, that would defeat the purpose of people signing in every day to claim the eggs.
---
Reddit is just a cesspool for people to congregate to agree with each other.
---
To others like me it’s something you do while taking a shit and never look back at any posts.
---
They always did that?
---
I can help
---
What building are you referring to?? I don’t think I have checked there. Is there supposed to be bos plans there?
---
I got all 3 so far, I'm in the UK but the store didn't update each one untill about 9pm I noticed
---
When
---
Never thought about using pumpkin grenades (I tend to throw nuka grenades out like they are candy). Will have to try this idea at some point.
---
I had one guy try to grief me at Top of the World. I motioned for him to come outside. I knew there was a radscorpion patrolling at the elevator. So I headed out and crotched since I have decent stealth. He came out and had to deal with the scorpion. Then the guy falls off the cliff into the lap of a group of mutants. If he survived the fall he didn't survive the mutants. 
---
Oh, and I did have someone try to harass me at Harper's Ferry. I'm not sure what he was shooting me with but I had a couple of pieces of health regen armor on. So slap damage was being renewed as soon as it happened. So he wasted ammo and weapon condition. I just stood there making heart emotes. I guess when he figured he wasn't doing any damage he decided to give up.
---
Which building? Is there supposed to be bos plans there?
---
I feel left out.  Gary?
---
Ya it wasnt there. Oh well.
---
I feel the same. I forgot about the bug the other day and purchased a few more mods then realized I wasted my time...seems like they've been pretty mum on the fix for it. This is my only real complaint so far for the game
---
Go fuck your self. This shits happening to a handful of pc players all night. 
---
Word is it’s a new dupe server crash being abused and Bethesda should’ve been on it ASAP instead of letting it run rampant again. 
---
Company doesn’t even know how to run its own game and fuck wads like you are just a fan bois cancer.
---
You’re correct! I just looked in my build menu and 45 is the max
---
&gt;Really miss selling my explosive tesla gun.
---
I almost sold an explosive cryolator that I picked up, but the vendors were out of caps for the day. I stuck it in my stash and forgot about it for a few days until I started running low on space, and during the time it was sitting there they patched out that effect so I opted to keep it.
---
I'm a melee dude so it usually lives in the stash, but the thing is fucking awesome for SBQ battles.
---
There should also be a hardcore mode.
---
Yes in the way back. There a video on YouTube showing the exact spot. I forget the name of the guy but he shows the way to go from the spawn point next to the mills. Kinda near wear swarm of suitors is.
---
Rad Storms are essentially the Graham and Chally of weather systems.
---
Is the strength calculation done for each piece, or one general equation?  I was fiddling around with your page to recreate the fire axe I had and the str numbers seemed to be a bit off.
---
I would be happy to grab some melee weapons and help test your numbers.
---
Yeah. Seriously Bethesda needs to remove that from the rng. I got 2 decent drops, its been nothing but fedoras since. Vending comes out I'm putting all mine up for 2k caps. Idgaf that no one will buy it, just my way of protesting.
---
Ah, I’ve been a bit nervous about the main quests as I’d probably struggle to fight Scorchbeasts on my own.
---
Seriously.... how goddamn boring!!
---
How about some nice HS boy good at video games come ask out my daughter and do it for me?
---
It's not that it's becoming easy for me, it's just the insentive for the people trying to bait others at the expense of other's work, my CAMP is for fair public use, everything except for my soon-to-be shops Employee only place isn't locked.
---
And hell I love difficult things, such as the Encrypted event, it's a blast and even though I'm against the ridiculous price, I have guzzled a lot of caps for the Circuit board.
---
And yeah the Burrows was easy compared to what was marketed.
---
Yes, I’m planning on getting that perk as soon I level up next.
---
Great idea.  And the comments... still cleaning off the screen of my phone from the drink I expelled while laughing.
---
Oh damn really? Never knew that, well I guess that's good to know for future reference, have most of my place fixed up thanks so some other players who saw the state of my  CAMP
---
Yeah it happened to me once as well.
---
I'm with you hear you probably can't get much for it but I carry launchers regularly as well and I think it's the most fun in my opinion
---
Yeah but that's a problem with the game, not  with people standing on roofs.
---
Started as a question, now just looking for confirmation (limited at work as to how much I can dig)
---
It seems all transactions are caps (or maybe item for item trade, not sure), I assume there are no real money deals?  This would be a deal breaker IMO.
---
It looks like you have a feedback loop (YAY!), anything in place to prevent gaming that system?  (don't publish your methods if you do, you'll compromise your system if the details get out).
---
Can you set language at a site level, or only on certain categories?  I think I ran into a place where language filter wasn't set, or at least I didn't see it in the few seconds I was popped in there.  Set and forget would (IMO) be a good way to have that, even i it was just per session (but should be able to be tied to login or cookie at a more complicated level).
---
Also, Next and Previous buttons on long lists are needed, it's a bit hard to navigate those with the font/spacing option used.  I can't imagine it on mobile like this.
---
Figured that was probably the case (most players are). As others have said in other posts, 10 minutes in the Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator power armor, and sometimes an easy 5-10 minute run for acid at that farm in the forest, and I've got enough for hours, but I'm up against weaker enemies than you're probably facing. That's a shame that it was enough of a drag to make you quit.
---
Not saying it is, just saying what dataminers found. I mean it couldn't be too interesting otherwise people would complain like OP is doing lol. Gotta make it neat but boring
---
Fuck me, this game would be 10x better if all this stuff was added.  Would be a lot cooler if they'd focus on these kinds of additions. Instead it's stuff no one is asking for like spawn nerfs, brewing alcohol, and underground tunnels.  It really makes you wonder where the disconnect is that the devs aren't prioritizing every one of these items.  Meanwhile, even my most diehard friends who've been playing since beta with me are dropping off because despite all the patches, the game is still just treading water instead of moving somewhere.
---
I just figured it was a bug because you aren't supposed to get two. Its a cool one though
---
I think mebbe that requires lead lining not copper... but now if it's for arthritis.....
---
And also the laser trip wires would be good if they worked as intended.
---
Where are you at with the main questliine?
---
I should be angry that we still don't have the camera but it ultimately doesn't matter because the challenges are so damn crazy I just wouldn't bother.
---
PvP in a Radstorm? No way in hell. Dressed as fisherman fighting a Mirelurck Queen? You would need a friend to set that up, and I wouldn't even bother for a small amount of Atoms.
---
If they want us to buy Atoms they should make a limited sale that cuts the costs in half and stuff like that, they are really going the greedy way about it right now.
---
lol people can't shoot at you for your junk anymore unless you shoot back
---
I always thought the meter just looped the charge, I didn’t know it displayed used power
---
Ah, I was thinking more about sustained dps over a minute or so when killing SBQ. I mean, the .50 Cal is just straight up the best for that it seems, unless maybe you can pull off constant sneak attacks with the handmade. I usually just pull out my BE harpoon gun for landed regular scorchbeasts =). 1 shots them from close range.
---
Which honestly says to me they are planning on doing it and hoping any furor dies down (which it has). I will say they are doing the "smart" thing when planning on doing something they know their playerbase won't like. Especially with gamers who will bitch and moan but don't put their money where their mouth is - after all, EA still makes a ton of money despite gamers bitching and moaning about them. And I've been told several times I should just buy their games and yet gamers still go on and on about how evil EA is... well, gee, guess it's cause despite all the bitching people still buy them.
---
I expect if they had gone back on this they would have responded to let people know. There's no reason to decide not to do this when people have expressed hatred for it and not loudly proclaim that you listened to the players. Absolutely no reason to stealthily go back on it. So, I'd say their silence speaks more that you're foolish to  think they still don't have plans for this.
---
Every time anyone here thinks “It would be so cool if they added -X” you need to step back and remember that they couldn’t deliver a camera on time in a game where you already take pictures all day.
---
Wasn't this announced as a coming feature?
---
I would buy atoms if I got more atoms per $$ spent. Ratio is just too low as it is, that's why I haven't put a penny into atoms yet.
---
Yes Bethany please!
---
For real? It’s been happening a lot and I’ve been wondering why. Thanks for sharing
---
The game's actually a lot easier after level 50. There's a rush of strong perks towards the end, and you're not continually running into monsters 20+ levels higher than yourself.
---
If you're playing alone then non-stealth rifle is a struggle.
---
not in survial
---
One thing worth considering is that the pipe weapons benefit from both pistol and rifle perks, so with 1 rank of all 6 of those cards you can get an easy 60% damage boost. I'm working on a similar build right now, and my level 20 character is putting out over 100 damage per shot with a standard pipe bolt action rifle
---
I have a Furious Prime MG42 and even though I have to nuke Whitesprings every other day to keep it fed it's such a dream to use. Though I'd recommend you also have another workhorse gun that you can reliably craft large quantities of ammo for such as a .50 cal.
---
Personally I use a Furious Gatling Laser since despite the fact that its broken in so many ways, its hard to say no to a gun who's ammo is pretty much free if you take a workshop.
---
Was it?? I would be so happy if that's the case
---
You will lose 1 point even though it will show up as &lt;1
---
You might be old but you apparently never grew up. Dick measuring contests stopped being cool after middle school.
---
No but it would be nice to get something out of it since that would be almost 7x more hours than my most played steam game (fo4)   
---
I think it should give 7600 atom points, which, in the grand scheme of thibgs, isnt that much, and youll probably pay more in electric costs than it would be to buy the atoms so jokes on anyone who is gonna idle that
---
Who's setting up trades in survival? Damn let me buy some flux off of you... In survival lol
---
Little correction it was made on the creation engine, same as Skyrim so they had probably 2-3 years of experience on that engine before they started working on Fallout 4
---
"If you don't trust my Maths please feel free to try it yourself."  
---
I don't trust your "maths" because statistics do not work that way. 17 runs is not enough of a sample size to make an accurate determination, especially since you changed servers midway through (way to invalidate your testing by altering variables); and since you don't have an exact count of the number of ghouls, you can't reliably calculate a spawn rates.
---
Don't comment often, do you have to wait 7 min to able to reply back, I can help you now
---
No, they don’t. Not if you committed a crime.
---
I'm not saying they don't still have plans I am saying that as of now nothing has happened.
---
One day we'll be able to burn out the Scorched. Also can't forget about the Cyro boys out there that want to kill the ~~Dinosaurs~~ big bats.
---
I've seen a Mothman and Flatwoods monster like 15 feet away from one another near Dyer's Chemicals, was pretty cool.
---
Explore, explore, explore and then explore some more. Don't try to rush through the main story.
---
PA or stealth style is very OP and easy in PvE, so if you want easy aim there.
---
Use perk calculator to study and plan your build and stick with it to level 60. 
---
I'm 150+ and have change my build three times now, it takes a little while but can be done easily.
---
Now doing Stealth commando when solo and PA heavy weapon machine gunner when in big event
---
I've never had issues w items despawning, and there's a really good mod called OCDecorator that makes placing and moving things WAY easier/keeps them from clipping !!
---
That's my point, venders are you only chance in survial and no one trades in adventure on xbox
---
Any inventory items is better than none, imo! I wanna put creepy dolls and bones in my home Bethany!!
---
Why would they need to patch it out of the game? It should be a server-side change, not a client side one. Maybe I don’t know the console tech that well, but the servers are Bethesda’s, right?
---
Wtf did I just witness
---
It is sad that we are fated to accomplish nothing in 180 years....
---
wat?
---
No you can comment whenever. Ill get on now my ganertag is TruJoe_
---
And I'd rather try to get them to go back on it before it happens.
---
If you use vendors in survival you're a sitting duck, train stations are the only respawn point beside V76, workshops, and camp. Do all your trading in adventure, dude
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
First off I said the in game economy second supply and demand became fucked TSE's are super rare duping them changes this and makes them less valuable but I wouldn't expect you to have reading comprehension skills or even the slightest concept of how an economy works.
---
I’m not making a post on Twitter because I don’t care about the game. I just thought it was a funny meme considering that they decided to add it this late in the game and make it monetised. Let me make it clear, I am not a die hard Fallout or Bethesda fan but I enjoy their games and the “news” surrounding Bethesda. I’m sorry if this offends you but I thought of it as a little funny haha.
---
You're still trying to justify it. Think about it.
---
Not too hard to get ammo- 
---
Make gunpowder at the chemistry bench from cloth. 
---
Farm lead from can chimes and take your excavator armor to lucky hole mine and walk out with 500 lead ore. 
---
Farm any low level place for steel from scrapped weapons. 
---
With ammosmith and super duper my ammo runs and production keep me going for several play sessions without having to stop and make more.
---
And how do you plan to do that?
---
Buddy had the flatwoods monster show up at his camp the other day. First time I'd ever seen one.
---
That's incorrect - i always trade in adventure mode on Xbox - I refuse to join survival on my vendor characters. I think you may have just run into a lot of unpleasant people. The majority of the people that I know on Xbox that are vendors only sell on adventure.
---
I think rn the plan can only be found with treasure maps or maybe in certain spots in the world but I don't know the spots
---
hahahaha I was like, who does a Jim Nantz playthrough? that’s hilarious
---
I just have a friend trade me something for the exact caps I have on me and then vice versa, say like a random hat for 10k that way you lose no caps in the abyss when you die, because your friend won’t receive all the caps you lose and you can just give your friend a cut amount for helping you out. 
---
just sucks when your friend has max caps or cannot take everything off of you, but it’s still worth it to destroy annoying obnoxious camps such as whitespring missile towers
---
I don't buy that guy's story for a minute, much like I don't buy any of the so called "legit players" who got banned.  I had friends that duped and when they tried to give me stuff, I turned it down.  Probably why I'm still allowed to play.
---
What do you even mean if they don't fix it for next week?
---
Found my own answer.  Yes, I missed the first egg (flower one).
---
"Each Deathclaw Easter Egg will be available for free in the Atomic Shop for a limited time, starting and ending at 8:00 p.m. EDT (23:59 UTC) on the dates listed below.
---

---
Sadness....
---
I’d settle for the SPECIAL cartoons during the game installing screens of Fallout 4
---
Read. Geezus.
---
They could make it a despot box bank at the whitesprings, you have to go there if you want to withdraw or add more caps to it, or, craftable cap stashes for CAMPs that can be stolen from, so yeah you can have them stored away, but its a risk you might lose them all
---
Oh here we go the sub downvoting is here
---
Bethesda didn’t make the game from scratch the engine uses many technologies bashed together to make the creation engine. 
---
The points raised about 76 using fallout 4s engine are 100% correct. They didn’t make this game from scratch they reused technology each game to create their work. 
---
But the downvoting police don’t allow facts for some reason it’s so fucking bizarre
---
Just got the Final Departure quest
---
There is a spawn in the back of Grafton Steel, but its super, super rare.
---
100% correct ignore the bethesdrones
---
It's considered a daily and you can get it every day either by chance or by being in the area/talking to Jack !
---
That’s a little rude
---
so 1989 spawned enemies is too small a sample size? 
---
(Physically counted by the way)
---
Also that 9.9% only changes by 0.2 percent on either server. The 9.9% is the average spawn rate. 
---
I think the sample size is large enough.
---
Unless you would like a peer reviewed double blind study of course!
---
The percentage is not going to go up or down by a huge amount regardless of sample size. Do you anything about generating stats or are you just another keyboard warrior who like to post negative things for no reason at all. wait let me guess your a maths teacher or....
---
Huh?
---
I’m personally trying to go for a tank character who uses heavy weapons - thing is, I haven’t found many heavy weapons yet...
---
I’m a casual level 81 player and try to help new players when I come across them. I like to craft Brotherhood Recon Rifles for them and drop armor, ammo, and aid. 
---
Last night I encountered a player who hooked me up with some legendaries on a trade and gave me some tips for my build. I’ve encountered some great folks on this game!
---
It basically means your weapon is crap. Unless you are withdrawing from using drugs/chems in the game. Or, if it’s a multi star weapon with other effects.
---
I’m on ps. Been using an Executioners missile launcher for a while. I’d buy it, but I’m not a 25k caps player. I’d give you idk 1500 caps for it? I don’t pay attention to prices so I don’t know what it’s ‘supposed’ to be worth, but I’m looking for more interesting missile launchers.
---
Telling someone to use common sense isn't rude. My bad, "NiggaOlympus".
---
I’m currently planning do a heavy tank build who uses big guns and wears power armor
---
Try closing and restarting your game to refresh the atom shop, works for me.
---
Go to the item in your inventory. Press whatever button it says to "Inspect" (R3 on ps4/xb1). Read the legendary effects.
---
From nothing? I’ve clearly seen asset reuse from fallout 3 in Fallout 4
---
File extensions have crossed over from game to game meaning they’re using the same underlying tools with changes and reiterations. 
---
76 uses mostly fallout 4 assets and any modder can see that. The build sets (excluding occasional specific places which have been designed for the theme) are practically identical
---
Odd then reddet not letting me comment into 7min past every time.
---
If you are tagging this as spoilers, what are the spoilers FOR? The title gives no direct indication that this has any relation to the Sheepsquatch fight until you start reading and figure out what ISS is. Maybe give your post a bit more of an accurate title next time so folks know WHAT these are spoilers for? Cheers for the info otherwise.
---
There’s always a yaoi at missile  site alpha and I think I frequently encounter multiple at the train yard east of Watoga station.
---
Im on now
---
Well he couldn't take him to the Ash Heap. The poor guy would just choke to death out there.
---
if you dont quit your game once and restart it during 24h thats possible
---
Would rather not farm Biv quests again, already got all the rewards for him, instead lets do a quest in a new cavern where we in a team of 4 have to fight the scorch beast queen in a cave to get passed her and find the dead body of the man who created Nuka Cola Cranberry.
---
What time are you on? Got a Troubleshooter's woord piece with your GT on it
---
You're two levels away from getting Ammosmith. Does wonders for ammo production.
---
Yep... You can still shoot the robots if they are legendary and you want some loot, but they stop bugging you.
---
Pacifist is great BUT please be careful with explosives around neutral NPCs/robots.  It will turn them against you.  Whiterun can suck when suddenly all the robots turn on you because a little splash damage scuffed their paint.
---
Doesnt allow it, no. Voice of Set has no nodding screen beyond repairing
---
What kind of ammo do you use? There's some ammo you can get pretty decently from farming low level scorched around that farm by Flatwoods or that hospital near the Ash Heap (sorry I don't remember the names off the top of my head) but they always have low level scorched.
---
Not gonna joke, i did 2 solo runs; first one, i s*** you not.. 11 legendaries, all dropped crap loot. 2nd run: 1 legendary-drops 2 shot handmade with 10% increased damage while aiming..... yeah
---
Best drop since i started playing, too bad i respecced my rifleman into a heavy gunner. So if anyone wants it, add me we can trade
---
Thank you for the offer, I will definitely consider it.
---
I'm afraid I can't do that, as I will most likely need it for my bloodied build. I will contact you if I am going to put it up for sale.
---
I'd be cool with that. It'd also be nice if there was a "Can I buy your workshop?" and a "I don't want it anymore, someone else can have it." options.
---
What if it removed a disease and gave about 20% extra damage dealt to enemies?
---
voila*
---
I think storing up to 5 might be rather memory-intensive for the server given it's tracking up to 24 people. Also there's the issue of that past spot being currently occupied, so would involve a lot more instances of the server having to start a new thread just to calculate if its available.
---
THAT being said... I don't think that it'd be too intensive to actually have the ability to set "favorite" locations, like browser bookmarks. Setting the spot as a "favorite" would in turn mark **specifically** where you had initially placed your CAMP device *(as you can move it after in the editor, without changing your build-zone's location).* I feel this is a valid option since we already have the Blueprint option. With our device being placed in the exact same, original location, it'll mean being able to place the blueprinted structures into their same spot as well. 
---
To avoid the unnecessary loading on the server to auto-calculate if a spot is taken, this could perhaps work off of the editor's ability to show where a damaged structure is in the editor and then let you see that ghost-location while trying to place your CAMP device; it would 'snap' to that spot. This would also be amazing for Blueprinted structures, if they were also "remembered" in this same way and would allow you to place them back exactly as well.   
---
Now as for how that alleviates server load, is it'd simply be relying on the already-in-place game mechanic of *"Can we place a CAMP here?";* therefore, being no more of a load than we'd impose by relocating our CAMP in any other instance. :)
---
Of course, we'd be limited to 'favorite' locations, just as we are with how many blueprinted structures we can have. 
---
***Alternatively...*** Though I kinda feel like this may be a bit 'unfair' as a way to sorta circumvent the fast travel system, *but...* They could again make things easier by reusing a system the game is already capable of by allowing the favorite locations menu to operate just like the blueprint menu, where we are able to label the spots and later select them from the list. Once selected, **just** the CAMP device would be placed at that remote location. Alas, I'm not big on this as I've already said at the start, as I personally like having to do leg-work to travel around. Letting people set various 'favorite spots' and auto-place their CAMP there would let them easily fast-travel around and save caps (though, I suppose that eventually the relocation cost **would** become far more expensive than the actual fast travel cost). As an example of things getting a bit too easy... While I love the vendor cap pool being shared across them all (except for the Enclave and traveling vendors, as they should be separated from that pool)... I didn't really like the fact that early on we could find pretty much all the same Plans at any vendor, and now that we don't even have to travel around to different locations to make money. It's all handed to us by traveling to the Whitesprings Hotel :\\ 
---
At any rate, there's my contribution! :)
---
After level 50, any time you level up you can choose any perk you want.  So, choose Gunsmith again and you will be asked if you want to merge the new card with the old one, which will combine them to make the next Rank.  It does not have to be unequipped to Rank it up, but you do need to re-equip it.  You also need to make certain you have enough points in that stat (Intelligence) to use the newly ranked card.
---
Yeah and serum plans cost 23k caps, but nobody is paying even close to that much.
---
I’m gonna guess they’re rare event drops or something now. Would be cooler if they were random drops from the respective creatures though.
---
I agree, I think someone that hoards enough caps to make Jeff Bezos jealous should just spend.
---
I don't think we should have a banking system, I think they should just sell things and trade with other players. I don't see much point in just putting the money aside, why not use it and if you have to much just give to other players. 
---
You could even start a competition, whoever completes a certain task first wins a cap bounty. 
---
You could get other players to:
---
- Make a certain gun with specific mods
---
- Find a rare or random item / items 
---
- have them complete a maze 
---
- Get them to hold a workshop the longest 
---
The list goes on
---
got a friend trystan357 on ps4 pretty sure he can bos your legs and arms, think he is missing the chest plans. get ahold of him let him know in the friends request i sent ya (silune) and what ya needin done so he doesnt ignore your friends request, doubt hed charge ya anything for doing other than maybe material costs. hes a pretty decent guy most of the time.  
---
from my own diggin into it when they changed over the plans from random to static through vendors, bos plans got dropped out of the lists available to be sold. debate if it was intended or a glitch but its also being said one of next months patches is supposed to fix that issue.   
---
i "hear" / have read that bos plans can be found at grafton steel sitting on a locker shelf, on spawn run straight (on road up hill) circle around (sorry dont know direction at work) then head down hill you will see a trailer next to the road and two buildings one next to the trailer and then one further down with a busted out corner, go in and there is the locker. i started server hopping there today for about an hour or so lookin for the plans myself and when there was a plan there it was an armor plan but i didnt get lucky enough to find any bos plans yet.  i do know there is a youtube video of the location you can find and he found a couple of the plans there.
---
That's what I like about video games. If someone says something you dislike, just kill them.
---
When I try it in the real world it's suddenly "murder" or something smh.
---
You can't get the BoS plans from scrapping. People get confused because the BoS helmet paint does unlock by scrapping, and the text is ambiguous.
---
They can be found by treasure maps, but the chance is probably very low, and may be area-specific (I found the torso plan in the Toxic Valley). I've never found a BoS plan at an armor plan world spawn or from an event, but that may just be an extremely low chance.
---
I can mod armor to BoS on PC, but not PS4. Finding someone who can is probably your best bet.
---
I'll be on in the nezt 15 minutes for an hour or two after that i probably won't be on until 11pm central time usually.
---
I agree, I've been trying to buy some for a couple weeks on Xbox and haven't had any luck.
---
Just a normal level 30 flamer. I just made a couple more to be sure. Sometimes it gives 100 fuel, sometimes 50. Not sure why.
---
Hidden self-destruct like when I open outlook then *immediately* open microsoft edge on PC. Sigh.
---
Great, send me a game invite in approx. 20min - GT QuasarSilva
---
Oh don't be worrying about Scorched Beasts then. The main quest won't force you into a fight with one for a long while yet.
---
As far as I know the only ones currently available in game are the wolf, radstag, yao gui, owlet and (now) wendigo. Kind of annoying/weird that they "put them all out" but you can only get 5?
---
My gf did it with hand grenades.
---
I was indeed.
---
Really hoping I can display power armour. I already have garages built for it lol. Would also like to be able to put a microscope and scorched heads in jars in my lab.
---
I normally try to stay around 20% since I use Nerd Rage as well!
---
Radstorms are so rare and pvp is even rarer so I have no idea what the dev team thought when making that challenge besides acting like trolls.
---
Many thanks my friend!!! I will definitely take you up on the offer. At work now, but will send him a message later today. I do have the chest plan. Just really want the legs and arms. Thanks again!
---
My teammate and I said, as we mopped the place up, that all we want is “waves and waves of enemies to crash against us.” Like fighting the Mechanist. Or a nuke silo on steroids. 
---
The level felt very FO4 to me. Most of the game’s levels don’t feel like FO4s level design, but this one did. It’s ok. But it’s not even as interesting as fighting the Rust Devils in their hideout.

This is WV we're talking about. No pizza until we get pepperoni rolls.

This greatly improves on the idea and should definitely become its own post :O

You would have been better off just spending that much buying the outfits from traders. That is an ouch amount of caps.

Gary. GARY! GARRYYYY!!!!!

I had an AAE combat rifle that did the same thing. Just gone. Poof.

Going to be a quest reward for one of the scouts quests

I would like to know as well.
---
Very true lol
---
Little hot under the collar bud? Lol must have struck a nerve. Sense tse were being mass produced how is it that it affected you negatively if you used axes and flamers? Which infact it stabilized the economy so that most people could infect afford the guns keeping a patched together online game some what far. Do you have an understanding of what an economy is or needs in order to sustain?
---
You can also head up to Aaronholt farm in the NW corner and harvest cranberries. Cranberry juice gives you +2% XP, and if you can manage to find gourds you can make cranberry relish for +5% XP. These stack with well rested and the mama dolce meat stew, for a potential 12-15% XP buff.
---
Other tips:
---
* capture workshops. The initial claim will get you ~150xp, and the defense mission that follows will give you another ~200xp plus whatever you get from killing the mobs. That's ~400xp in a matter of minutes. There's a good chance someone will try to initiate PvP , so don't bother building anything at the workshops other than a stash box and a chemistry bench. Stash box for obvious reasons, and chemistry bench because it uses the least amount of resources of any of the benches that allow you to scrap stuff.
---
* Super cheese ball technique: the vertibot landing pad at Poseidon can be repaired for 6 steel and 8 aluminum. Once it's repaired it spawns a non-hostile vertibot that can be killed for ~150xp each time. If you have spare steel and aluminum you can just sit there and farm the vertibot over and over again.
---
People either cannot read or don’t want to help. Everyone runs around shooting it when the shield is up. Just crazy.
---
As someone who is level 56 (?) and is ready to launch a nuke but has never ventured into a nuke zone (and on top of this is a pretty casual player) could you tell me if I'm reading your comments correctly? So you drop a nuke, enemies spawn, they're killed by you or another, and when a new player enters the nuke zone they are respawned?   
---
How long does the nuke zone last? Any other tips if you have a minute or two?
---
Get yourself a good Melee weapon no matter what build :)
---
If you play without op builds the game is quite difficult. Dont use an power armor or OP armor. Don't just melee cheese everything either. I am level 47 using a non PA rifle build and it is quite difficult in some places.
---
That’s racist you can’t say the n word
---
That’s epic
---
Must haves are One Gun Army (Luck), Stabilized (Int), Power Patcher (Int), Heavy gunner perk lines (Str) and Bandolier (Str)
---
That's the way I leveled over 100 level, it's fun and easy but very ammo costly. Get a Gatling Gun also as it has decent DPS but very low ammo consumption.
---
If you are on PC I can make you some stuff. IG Alerno
---
The best way to fix this would be making the next week challenge give twice as many Atoms. You wouldn't get stuff for doing nothing yet if you do the challenges you would earn what you didn't thanks to the bug this week, so it would be fair and square.
---
Though I wouldn't have much hope after they rammed up the difficulty and rareness of the challenges with the radstorms and stuff.
---
That is... a lot of typos
---
Epic
---
I have a couple (I think 3 or 4) if you want them!! My psn is morgantim916
---
I had that happen a couple days ago. Completed the first one, but the second one wouldn't register despite me drinking whisky and killing something with a melee weapon. I just hid the quest to get it off my screen and went about my business.
---
When I logged in yesterday it popped up with a different challenge and completed just fine, so if you can't finish it today just ignore it for 24 hours.
---
depends how much you want for it
---
Still hoping to see the red rocket sign come back...
---
This was also in the trailer, a group fighting ghouls in the sewer.
---
Seriously.  The joy OP felt in being helped, getting a lot of cool stuff, and exploring things with someone is all a total lie.  OP should feel pain and sadness, because they didn't have your experience.
---
I like getting a little bit of help (leather, cloth, reasonably priced legendaries, and plans are always welcome!  If we are at a vendor, helping me make bank is welcome too!).  All of you who have swooped in when my health is low to finish off the mob on my back, thanks.  I will sit at a distance and do the same thing when I see someone's health bar dipping fast and the mob growing.  I try to snipe the ones you've already tagged so you get your loot.
---
I agree, I don't want someone to do TOO much for me, but thanks for the help that has been given, and hope all those that I've helped   were not too annoyed.
---
People have tired contacting Bethesda about it. They don't respond, only reason 900 hour guy got a response was due to the media picking it up.
---
Weird part is why can't I scavange or search all fridges some open, others don't, and why can't I cook on a bbq like a cooking station.
---
Got a few 404's in there just FYI.
---
I worked for a company that developed some of that (and a lot of other things that have an *actual* effect on your doomsday clock). I'm keenly aware of railgun tech, but no one is going to be creating a doomsday event with that technology.  It has some small scale, localized cost/benefit advantages, but that's about it.  It really isn't a part of any potential doomsday, global catastrophe event any more than a Tomahawk (or, I guess, a Malakhit  if you're getting technical about who's doing the firing).
---
I understand your concerns (really), and I don't usually try to talk people off the ledge when it comes to this stuff.  But I don't get my information from people selling ad impressions, I get them from DoD experience and friends who are in charge of the people who get the business end of that tech pointed at them.
---
Personally waiting for repair kits and refrigerators then I'm going to buy atoms.\*

If you get so offended by words maybe you should go back to the kitchen.

PA heavy weapons is solid eventually, but the heavy weapons perks unlock rather late. Stabilized at level 36, Master/Expert heavy gunner at 40 and 50. Still, they might be a good way to economize on ammo at the moment:
---
* There are static spawns for the 50cal and minigun at least. Should be listed online somewhere.
---
* You can buy plans for the Gatling Gun, and you'll want those because it has a number of useful scrap mods.
---
* Treasure maps often drop the more exotic weapons.
---
args, that feels uncomfortable for me :) But this +3 excites me. Have to rethink about it
---
Your doing what I’m doing on pc after finding out how badly my stealth sniper on PS4 did.
---
At 25 you can use the Gatling gun with its 5mm ammo.   
---
That’s cheap to make and gets cheaper after ammosmith and super duper kick in but very viable before too if you run top of world or prison, or Wes ten for ammo mats. 
---
Check all the ws vendors as a night doesn’t go by where I don’t see one in there while I’m looking for a good 1 star to base a weapon off of. 
---
Tbh though, it really should be melee with a sledge or shotguns until you can equip a .50 cal machine gun , then that last leg towards your real end game guns. 
---
I’m 25 and with 2 perk cards for melee I can clear very small top level ghoul packs in ws - big groups still own, but that’s to be expected.   None the less, I’ve racked up levels and a lot of starred gear I can’t use yet doing that.
---
lol imagine how many players are trying to unlock camera now, I spent a day looking for tourist locations to try and start the quest and wasn't even in the game.
---
And? You legally have recourse to have it returned to you.
---
Or just disconnecting during SQB fight.. it sucks D:
---
Mods need to put a sticky up or something my goodness
---
I got a full set of plans hopping Harper's ferry before update. Got my second set from savage divide treasure maps. I'd be happy to mod your gear after work. About 6pm central time. Just put BoS in the request.
---
PSN: t33gs-oosah 
---
I have heard that you can find the plans at Grafton steel yard and at top of the world. I have found combat armor plans there, but never BoS.
---
Radstorms are cool but personally I hated them since I'm always naked.
---
The loot seems to be very hit or miss. I see posts of people saying they got lots of legendaries but I have run it twice now and gotten a grand total of 1 legendary and I make sure to loot all the bodies.
---
Grammar nazi lol... 
---
English isn’t my native language I wanna see you writing and talking perfectly in other languages you can ..
---
Stop by Southern Belle Motel in the Mire and take a peek around the front on the tables. I think we've still got a little while to go before they add all the plans for the mounted creatures though, sadly.
---
I'm just saying, alright? Calm down, I don't wanna fight
---
After the trial is over they absolutely have to give you your stuff back even if it was part of evidence.
---
Didn't some earlier daily challenges require you to lvl up 5 times in same day.

40-60% hp: +1

The real reward is a seventh egg that hatches a winged glowing deathclaw companion with lasers for eyes and blades for arms who eats steel scrap to summon a storm cloud that rains axes on your enemies to the sound of Megadeth's 'Symphony of Destruction'.
---
They shouldn't change the ratio because atoms are worth $.01 each, which makes it easy to calculate the "real world" price of atom shop items. What they need to do is lower the prices on the vast majority of the offerings. Paying $7 for a race car bed or $8-10 for a PA skin that only works on 1 set of armor is fucking ridiculous.
---
I'll be honest. I didn't wait even 30 seconds to see. With my main treasure GONE I just left.
---
He literally put a video in the post.....
---
Damn if this isn't legit they just found their $100 worth cosmetic
---
I got that quest at like level 10 and didn't pass until level 40. The epiphany was when a friend told me to melee all the shooting range targets. Start it, jump out the front window on the left and get close to the first target, and when the timer starts slash them with a combat knife or something. I wasted so much ammo trying to pass that damn thing because I suck without VATS.For the obstacle course just practice the balance beam and wire a few times and you'll be fine- just run when you can
---
Ya the "boss" was only level 26 for me and I'm level 181...
---
Sorry the Easter content really irked me, because it’s so NonFallout and lame to me, while big holes like mods aren’t patched, new content is delayed or underwhelming, etc. 
---
If this game had any balls we could have got a crucified Raider skeleton camp decoration in the Atom shop.
---
How much do you offer, dont really know the prices
---
Unyielding sentinal armour probably gain plus 3 points on all stats on low health and 15% dmg resistance while standing if he has all pieces its 75% damage reduction plus another like 30% with a max lone wonderer perk
---
He showed the response from bethesda, and photos having 300k+ ammo.
---
Its a trick by Bethesda so we ask them to bring back drink 50 alcohol dailies and its working!
---
it's a hard place to be sometimes and coming from being a high health build it was a weird transition but I do like it\~ and if you get a whole set of that armor too- even better!
---
ores and gunpowder should be junk! HERE HERE!
---
Assuming it's not explosive?
---
I do have a 50cal in my stash that I’m really excited to start using - I just have hardly any ammo for it...
---
Your just rather blaming people than being productive ... what do you expect as a reaction to it lol?
---
I didn't know they had any Easter related quests? Thought it was like the Christmas/new year's stuff. Right now I think the only real holiday content is Faschnacht
---
I can second this on Xbox. It’s quite frustrating.
---
Blaming? I don't like where this is going
---
Pretty sure it's a daily, it's one of those that triggers whenever I enter the region (like the Camden Park dailies)
---
It lowered the price so any sweet god roll Items I have are now worth less because players can easily get a duped one smh
---
Right now I’m also using an upgraded sledgehammer. I have a 50cal sitting in my stash that I can use, I just don’t have much ammo for it
---
But I see them much more often\~ I see them about once a day normally!
---
Start a new character. Almost all of the non-daily challenges are character based and you can rack up 400-500 atoms in a few hours. When it slows to a trickle just create a new one.
---
Some photos or, even better, video would be much more appreciated.
---
Definitely getting that as soon as possible!
---
You’ve become a god, embrace it lol
---
It always plays Old Man Mose for me :c
---
**BUCK-BUCK-BUCKET!!!**
---
It’s just another scam.  Lots of them here, why even be bothered by it at this point?
---
Nuke zones last ~ 2 hours (maybe 2.5?). 
---
Respawns happen naturally ~30 minutes after a mob is killed.
---
Respawns also happen if a player new to that server joins the area, but have a 5-10 minute 'global cooldown'.
---
If you clear an area out in 3 minutes, then a new player spawns in, it won't respawn. However, if you wait until the timer is up, you can spawn new stuff in again. The best way to take advantage of this is to find a good route that takes about 10 minutes to complete, and then you leave the server and rejoin it by joining a friend or 2nd account that is still there. You count as a new player when you rejoin, and stuff respawns.
---
Wow, so basically un-killable 😆 even if his HP bar drops to zero. Seems balanced. This is why I don't even touch  PvP just wanted to help a friend...
---
I see, thanks!
---
Could be. I've updated the website several times fixing calculation errors based on feedback.
---
In principle, the each point in strength adds 5% to a base damage, so strength 5 is 72 x (1 + 5 x 0.05) = 72 x 1.25 = 90. If you have it repaired to 200%, that is +30% so 117. All perk bonuses come after this.
---
However, I had problems with certain weapons not matching up. 
---
Please post your weapon and character specs and what damage you get.
---
another spot: near pumpkin house
---
Pls be usefull about the topic? :)
---
i get 2 usally when i spam the interact button on biv
---
Yes, and pieces of my power armor.. I'm really fucking thrilled that I have to redo my calibrated shocks because my leg just vanished.  And an arm... This is the most bogus glitch I've had happen.. And all my flamer fuel just disappeared
---
The skin also doesn’t work on the survival reward guns like the one that was released called medical malpractice.
---
It's a serious condition!
---
Great tips, thank you so much!
---
As far as I know, the mobs don't do anything different when you're wanted. As for other players, most people probably aren't going to spend 20+ caps fast travel to you in order to claim a 10 cap bounty, so if you want it cleared I'd suggest traveling someplace populated, dropping all your junk, and using the mic to ask for someone to kill you.
---
You can always join another server. The game forces you to server hop anyway.
---
Yep forget to mention fire proof perk 60% explosion resistance
---
Sure send a dm if you think to sell it eventually. Keep it triple barrel too, i prefer that mod over quad.
---
Plans too, lots of duplicate garbage. I’ve got 12 schematics for ivory revolver grip for no reason. Thank you rng god.
---
r/birthofacopypasta
---
Yea kinda of bad, might be better to make AI for SBQ fight more simple like unable to leave a certain range but if it does it auto returns or commits suicide and gives all players rewards still but anything better then buring 1k ammo on it and still losing.
---
They're Amazon's from what I hear, but that's not a real distinction.  And it's not 100% certain, but generally speaking things can't just be turned off at the server level that easily.  
---
It's possible to design things to run way, and there's no easy way to know for sure if daily quests are totally server-side or not, but since they've come out and said it wasn't intended (a statement that I don't think accurately encompasses the situation, but that's another story), I think it's safe to assume that it's not something they can just flip a switch on.
---
Even *if* it's all server-side, they'd likely have to deploy a change to the servers (as opposed to flipping a switch), so that still means a shutdown for maintenance, something that hasn't happened since the bug went live.  It's a judgement call as to whether or not fixing this issue is worth the downtime (if that's all it would take).
---
I wish they had a cctv system you could set up at your house
---
Alright, I will add all those to my perk wishlist. 
---
Unfortunately, I am on Xbox, but thank you so much for the offer!
---
Leader of the Pack event that starts near Tyler County Fairgrounds also counts for the event as the wolves are considered wild canines.
---
I usually start off at Aaronholt Homestead as there are 5 wild mongrels including a boss version.  Then there are usually 5-7 insects there, too.  And if the event pops, then you get more canines.
---
So your upset because they took your ability to be a greedy pig away from you? Sad.
---
It’s not worth it now that they fixed it.  I mean unarmed and unarmored?  
---
This game makes it a pita to change into non pa armour, so your basically asking to be one shot.
---
Granted, good for sneaking through an area you can’t fight in but it’s slow af to do and boring as well.
---
Only way to kill him is with staggering perks with breaks armour so you can expose him to dmg
---
I have to agree with you. While I greatly appreciate when someone wants to help me as a new player I don't really like it because I miss out on getting a feel for the game. How I stack up against different enemies. How the AI works. And taking my time to explore. It's also the reason I didn't team up when I first started playing. Some people like to rush through a mission while sometimes I just want to look in every nook and cranny to make sure I'm not missing something. And that could get on someone's nerves really quick.
---
Take 1500?
---
Anyone with a Whitespring turret camp is free game.
---
50cal ammo's not too expensive to produce as long as you have the Scrapper perk to get plenty of steel. Something like 12 lead per 100 without Ammosmith.
---
The Gatling Gun is the real ammo-saver though. You pick up quite a lot of 5mm, and it does good damage per bullet.
---
If I truncate with Fibblez' numbers, I can get a reasonable value, but then somebody else's config gets misaligned: lvl 45 bloodied explosive handmade with powerful automatic receiver, 4% health, bloody mess 3, adrenal reaction, adrenaline 5, nerd rage, demolition expert 5. Without receiver rounding: 555.98, with rounding of the receiver: 554.75.
---
Nope just glad they're banned no salt here I can still play
---
You should hop to a new world where you can grind for xp in peace. The Burrows is a place where turret camps cant get to.
---
TSE Handmade has benefit of an Armor piercing mag eg perforating mag, plus its larger magazine size makes its DPS much higher
---
I really need an "I'm sorry!" emote!
---
My last camp wrecking episode cost me 300 caps.  Big deal.  It’s worth it and I’m at 25K caps now anyway.  
---
It’s not quite as fun as blowing up random cars but blowing up turret camps parked behind WSGC is a lot of fun.  It’s even better if others get in on the action.  Two weeks ago another 150+ lvl guy entered the turret camp wrecking fray with me and it was glorious.  Then the idiot owner fast travelled in and we nuked his ass too.
---
🙃 oh sure, yeah forgot about that.😆
---
Sounds like the glitch from Skyrim where Dragon would just fly up to roof of game out of range of player. Next thing we going to have in Fallout 76 is giant chickens.
---
I dont think you're trading with the right people then. Trades are almost never done in survival; even the subreddit advises against it for YOUR safety
---
If you're going this route, definitely pick up the nerd rage perk and get yourself an adrenal reaction serum. My 1 star bloodied baseball bat does over 1k per swing when my health is below 20%.
---
Yeah I don’t understand the reason behind that. I was going to go around town killing robots but after about 10 or so, only eyebots respawned or level 8 Mr. Handys.
---
super duper also works on smelting. one trip through lucky mines will yield ~250 lead.
---
The effect stacks? Thats an importante information :)
---
thanx
---
Oh man sorry to hear that. At least I know I'm not alone...
---
2 server hoppable deathclaws in that Mire waste cave
---
You can not believe it all you want, evidence for his story was everywhere.  Even Bethesda themselves said he was banned for having too much ammo and never said he was duping
---
Just server hop I don't see the big issue. Looking forward to the day no one can grief camps. You're crying over a video game dude, and all you're doing is reinforcing the idea that those whose camps that are being destroyed need more turrets to defend against griefers. Take a chill pill, turn the game off, and go outside. How much goddamn xp are you missing out on in the long run?
---
I’m not sure. I didn’t start doing these challenges until recently because I don’t have much else to do. Did the 5 a day have conditions or was it just level up 5 times?
---
Watch out for those morons who claim to have tons of hours in the game get all high and mighty and tell you to get creative, and farm somewhere else.
---
Because turret bases at the clubhouse haven't been an issue since day 1 and are definitely not an easy fix. /s
---
For me it just took time. I can get a level every day or two. If you want to power level, team up with someone and hit Whitesprings. You can solo it, too. Just run around, pop a bullet in everything, and then hide somewhere. If you're still in the area, you get exp from from everything you put a bullet in, even if someone else kills it. A lot of people, depending on their niceness level, will realize a lower level is around, and drag the ghouls out of the golf course, so you can "tag" them. Wes Tek is also great, nice spot for legendaries, but it can be a bit more challenging once you go inside the building. 
---
If you're in a group, use Inspirational, and if you don't have it, ask if they can share their card. There's a recipe you can make with cranberries and gourds that give an exp boost, as well as sleeping. There's the Mama Dolce Food for the People that gives you a can of exp+ stew, but you probably knew about that already.  I'm not really sure how those stack, I imagine the cranberry and stew don't stack, but the other's do. 
---
If you need bullets, check containers in Train Stations, and the Overseer's Stash, people will often leave hundreds of rounds. Popular spots for this are Overseer's Camp, the overseer's stash in Flatwoods, a suit case in the Train Station in Watoga, and the vendors register in the Whitespring's Artist's Corner. You're nearly to the Ammo Crafter perk, as someone else said, that will help a lot. 
---
Another perk that can be helpful; I was dumb and didn't even realize how helpful the Concentrated Fire perk was until fairly late. It makes a decent dent in my bullet usage. Being able to get 95% headshot in a couple hits verses 25% or whatever it'd be without it, plus is super nice for not having to repair your armor all the time. 
---
Easy ways to get lead ore are to wear the Excavator in the Lucky Hole mine. Acid is needed to turn it into usable lead, but that's fairly easy, pick up every soap you find always. Easy ways to get steel is to use Scrapper perk card, and break down cheaper guns. Plastic can be a bit more problematic if you're using shotguns, but good spots are the High schools in Morgantown and Watoga. There's a house slightly north west of that has some, too. It's easy to identify by it's silo. 
---
You probably already know 90% of that, but hopefully it was a least a little helpful.
---
Support is a myth.  
---
They can’t even run servers correctly, why would you think the one janitor they let review support emails has time to do this after flushing toilets all day?
---
I purposely lobbed a Nuka Grenade right next to the “camp” to get their attention and that didn’t work.  Upped the ante with an orbital strike and thumbs down emote.  The turrets kept firing and the owner gave me the confused question mark emote so I did 4-5 more strikes this time on top of him and his turret farm.  Then I gave him the thumbs up emote.
---
He's definately wearing sentinal armor, that's why he's jumping in place. Auto stim armor &amp; perks, with spamming stimpacks keep his health continually filling, and the rest is server lag showing his health dropping when it's actually not.
---
If he's popping Med-x, that's an additional 25% dmg reduction.
---
It's possible it was some exploit, but I would think it's just more evidence of poor PvP mechanics.
---
You really should have been spamming as many VATS crits as possible.
---
So can they just different profiles. Lol you thuot there not playing? Where do you think all the aae are coming from legendarys?
---
not when i commented
---
Oh wow, just like all the other overpriced skins that only apply to one fucking gun in the game
---
pretty sure they'll make whitespings un-campable. as they have a few areas.. well hopefully
---
Lmao
---
Sometimes mobs don't attack me (usually Mr Gutsys), have you tried a different server?
---
Zero fucks given unfortunately.  This studio could care less if fo dies and us with it
---
Seems the number of officers with codes has increased a lot! Yet it seems nukes are few and far between since this happens a lot.
---
It’s a dying horse they keep kicking to make thrash so it looks alive but deaths on its way.
---
It's much better than it was. I only get randomly dced like once a day if that. It's a good time to come back to grind caps for camp blueprints and such before new content gets released
---
That's a great write up- thanks, man!
---
I need summer time Nuka-Popsicles
---
How about all the broken challenges like the fact that it says I havent discoverd the cranbarry bog or that I've never killed a scorched beast queen. Lol I assure you I have alot. And their are many challenges like that. Please make challenges possible it's what keeps me playing
---
You have to back out all the way and quit the game and go back in. The next days egg will be there. 
---
When it has updated twice now, the server freezes and kicked from game.
---
I have a grand or two. I don’t log in unless , like now, the pc version is fucked. 
---
What’s your offer?
---
I also believe it's mostly lag. The guy clearly has sentinel gear but the health thing is lag. 
---
Even with life saving gear,the effect happens when you're ko.
---
Where did he show pictures of 300k ammo? Because Bethesda never even said he had that much. Do you have a link to these pictursz? Becausr as i said ive followed glorf12s story since it happened. If you know how Bethesda was counting "gathering ammo over 30 days" and knowing he was using mules gives a very plausible explanation. Not to mention people already did the math and the amount of ammo Beth claimed he had was in the realm of very possible to gather in 30 days. With grinding it turns out it could be grinded out in about 2 weeks.
---
and i believe 0% of what you said
---
have a nice life, im done with this nonsense conversation
---
A few tips for pvp. USE VATS! You’ll hit more of your shots and the vats crit is the most deadly thing in game. When people wear armor. Switch the vat lock to there head (there’s not sentient armor there) Next switch from rifleman to commando. You’ll loose a few hit points. But you’ll make up for it with your overwhelming fire rate. A few good perks: concentrated fire, Better vats, 4 leaf clover and deadman’s sprint. As far as more pvp in adventure servers is due to how few of caps are earned from killing in PvP. It’s easier to earn caps in adventure.
---
I don’t bother no more, fuck it !
---
Only to just lvl up but this was months ago and was more meant for hardcore players I would assume.
---
This is great info. Do you have to be sneaking(crouching) to have a chance to negate enemy VATS? Can you be standing, walking or running? I'm guessing sneaking gives you the greatest chance to negate enemy VATS, then standing, then walking, running. The perk escape artist makes it so "running no longer effects stealth," does that mean running will apply the same amount of stealth as crouching?
---
I saw the Flatwoods monster in the woods near the lake, west of Watoga. That's the only one of those I've seen.
---
Same. When they said new challenging dungeon I was thinking like an MMO party required for hours kinda dungeon with a couple unique characters, not just a few tunnels filled with ghouls.
---
Like you said, I appreciate the content and efforts greatly, but to me it seemed like it was going to be some huge thing.
---
After reading this I'm glad I have a high perception(13) and agility(15) build.
---
Damn. That thing duped itself in my os4 game , so I dropped one in a bag to be rid of it.  
---
Had no idea it’d go away later or I would’ve kept it.
---
Same, it's so annoying
---
You get the wendigo mount by participating in a cryptids event at the motel in the Mire. It’s a piece of paper on one of the tables.
---
I sadly figured that was it. Makes the most sense. People are abusing the Wanted system. Getting people to fight them, then a while team shots you.
---
All bought in game ya soft ass.
---
I will say good point.... I assume on pc they can create a new name with a new email. How would they do that for consoles.... unless they go through the hassle of buying a new ps plus membership or xbox live
---
Bunch of pussies.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s entitled, but it makes it seems like their game is half assed. But, honestly it really doesn’t seem like they care what it looks like on the surface.
---
And he's a tad bit of a cunt
---
Dude, I'm done with this, white knight him all you want. You obviously **haven't** been following this closely, or you'd already know what I'm talking about. He was called out on posts he made, which he then removed. The bs crafting speculation came out after.
---
I fast travelled into the event just as it ended,  and still got credit for completion.
---
Yeah the broadsider could be a really cool weapon if it's damage was higher.. love the 50 cal.  And the fatman is a mini nuke launcher, it SHOULD one shot people!
---
Yeah, I need to put on concentrated fire, I'm a VATS-crit Rifle Build actually. I was just frustrated at his damage reduction. Thanks for the advice. 😁
---
At least I'm not alone on this one...
---
Made a post about this very issue a couple of days ago and the only reply I had was a fella for whom these were working just fine.
---
Well, at least the one 'Boomer' gives you.
---
I have never, across 4 accounts and 5 toons, managed to do these more than once.
---
I have no idea how they become 'glitched' but I guess I have very good at 'instinctively' doing it :P
---
This would make more sense than having an auditory hallucination every time a nuke gets launched. I say add an element of surprise! We never knew where people would drop nukes in C&amp;C until it happened so just let people figure it out.
---
Is Tormentor good in PvP it has a chance to stagger with rifle shots?
---
Good lord, Bethesda. Are you fucking stupid?
---
crits and stagger counter all of this.
---
That sums up my experience.  
---
I heard a new exploit was out on pc and assholes crashing servers nonstop for it, which of course, Bethesda wasn’t even trying to stop.
---
I'm confused are you actually a transman or what
---
Look into Ethernet over power, you can have Ethernet without tearing up your house.
---
What about this advertisement from [Washington DC?](https://youtu.be/V5dlaF4rqrA)
---
Yea
---
As for duped to? Not one ban, nor do I have one looming over me sir..  why you ask? Just an honest player kicking ass and taking names.
---
Just good at shooter games, the op clearly should be playing sims.
---
What a nice read.
---
Wow, this is very impressive, could I use it as part of my video?(AlexKGB)
---
For what it's worth, the general damage (bloody mess etc) and weapon class damage (rifleman etc) multipliers are applied in the same way, with the general damage following immediately after the class damage. I'm not sure about any of the other ordering yet.
---
Yeah? whats confusing about this? (Did I phrase smth weird?)
---
I just want the stairs to connect like they did in Fallout 4. That cent of the block crap is infuriating
---
Yeah I'm on xb1 and noticed that too. I think its the daylight texture but at night lol
---
I personally think it should show a missile launch alert whenever someone launches a nuke.  There's something broadcasting the alert, so make it show up on the TV too.
---
glory hole
---
I had to fight six of the damn things at my camp last night (not all at once, but every time I went there one - or two - was there), literally all I got was two armor pieces, a lever action, and wing pieces and meat. That's it. I expended probably 500 rounds of 5mm for a tiny bit of Ultracite that I won't use, armor that isn't as good as mine and sells for next to nothing, and meat that weighs over a pound a piece. I'm only lvl 63 and that loot is already useless to me. I definitely agree that SBs should drop legendary loot always, as they're the hardest things to take down. But at this point I'd rather farm Whitespring than fight SBs, since like I said Ultracite is next to useless for me, and the ghouls give better loot. 
---
Scorchbeasts are functionally the endgame here, since people nuking site prime is so rare (due to all the issues). It just doesn't make sense to fight them as is. If the loot is useless to me, I can't imagine the 100+ players. Loot is already an issue in this game, but the tables for SBs are literally broken.
---
I've heard at least one source say that it's actually pretty good, if a little high maintenance.  You don't have the low health issue from bloodied, but you get a similar benefit.
---
Nowhere did they go into a numbers comparison, or talk about what (if any) effect withdrawal has, so I'm still a bit skeptical.
---
How many caps ?
---
Banned and Suspended are being used interchangeably... that’s not correct. 
---
IF they say you were “banned” then you are actually “banned” HOWEVER “Suspended” was used for many and Bethesda has said it will turn those accounts back on. 
---
Many that were suspended had ammo also doesn’t mean they “duped” anything. Those that duped were banned in their letters. 
---
A number of players I believe picked up bags for example at White Springs, when you “take all” especially in a nuke zone and realize you just went overweight and then dump, how is that duping? It’s not. 
---
The banned players won’t be returning however Suspended players will be eventually. 
---
Either way create another character and start it over.
---
They really should change this in some way, either by making the skin compatible with the western, or just taking the time to give the western a new model so it's actually a different weapon entirely. (It's not even an actual western revolver, it's a modern DA revolver!)
---
Also, the gold skin seems to have an error with reloading where it suddenly has two cylinders, one of which stays inside the gun, unless I'm the only one with that problem...
---
Yeah! I also totally forgot about Stairs!
---
• New Types of Stairs: possibly fancier, wooden stairs with country vibes! I'd be so down for that!
---
Family pack profiles and just having hard copies
---
Oof I thought there was a level 50
---
Doesn’t. I was using services at someone’s multi level camp when I tried to gun down a mob below, but the kick back sent shots into his wall and I was wanted ASAP.
---
“We are going to level you up” - that would be the hardest pass from me. Welcome to the game. Let me ruin the little content there is by making you overpowered for it.
---
Wrong
---
Would now work
---
That crap is garbage ^^^please ^^^help ^^^me ^^^I'm ^^^addicted
---
I haven't tried it, but does the target range care who shoots the targets? Could you get a bunch of friends together to each pick a target and murder the thing in three seconds?
---
I laugh when people ask for new content... fix the fucking original content first.  Like how does a piece of my power armor disappear off my chassis?
---
 And just the mk 3 ones don't work for me.. regular ones do
---
Gaivinnnnn, have you seen my mate gavin?
---
Who uses pistols?  Literally the most horrid weapon type in the game next to a board.
---
very nice. Using nerd rage already. Have to save my caps for the Recipe now. But since the last patch its not that hard anymore to have the needed 19k caps
---
I still need the recipe for Cranberry Moonshine.
---
Gotcha, well you taught me something new. Basically there is no real punishment for duping nice to know.
---
Well you said you're a man that plays a female character. But you also said you're a transman, which is basically the opposite of that, because transmen are born female but identify as males. So what are you exactly now? Are you just a man that plays as a female or are you actually a transman in real life?
---
&gt; I've been grieffed more times in the past week in Adventure mode that since beta? What is going on? Anyone else having this problem 
---
People who were farming caps in Survival mode were mad about the cap loss reduction in the last patch, so they switched to Adventure mode.
---
It’s better than buying that e cavator raider skin and when applying it you look like a bare frame with no head walking around.  Literally the worst and I paid for that shit.
---
You know how hard it is to get flux, right?
---
Tank Killer for the stagger. Tormentor only does crippling, and explosive weapons are probably more efficient for that.
---
Noticed this the first time I played always thought it was sorta dumb lol how you gonna pull the bolt back on a hunting rifle with your left hand while your right hand is on the trigger in real life you’d probably drop the gun
---
I've asked three different people and they absolutely refused. They were aware what they were doing and they didn't care. They seemed to care a bit more after I destroyed the camp a few times.
---
Better yet. Nukashine sequel quest where a pizza chef robot teaches you to make pizza and we unlock the Pizza Oven crafting bench.
---
I've been disconnected more in the past week than at any other same-duration-time-period since launch.
---
The last turret camp I saw get set up the group I play with set up an artillery battery in range of it and just kept lobbing smoke on it.
---
It was glorious to hear the cannonade of a half dozen artillery going off and striking true.
---
But are you tho, have you fought for the valiant enclave. Or are you an actual good person and joined the responders
---
With serendipity (3) and dodgy (3), you may find that 20% health is pretty comfortable as long as the thing you’re fighting cannot do that much in one hit. Gutsys and the faux Sheepsquatch are dangerous. Most other things aren’t that bad.
---
I’ll definitely keep my eyes out for a Gatling gun, then. I’m almost at the level where I can get animosmith, too.
---
It’s a shit design as usual, people got fucked and Bethesda will do nothing about it. 
---
Broken as intended
---
transman in real life, sorry if my phrasing made it seem like I was talking about character? I usually play female characters because imo they're easier to make decent looking w Bethesda character creators (though recently I accidentally switched my character to male and since you can't revert back to your original changes apparently, I now play a male character)
---
Nope :(
---
Does work on the Sommerset Special though.
---
I just heard it too. I was looking for a pet and instead in the event spot i heard it. There was nothing around.
---
It's definitely a random event but i couldn't figure out what to do.
---
That’s definitely more than a little helpful! Thanks so much!
---
Yes it does, and it looks hella pimpin'.
---
Tree fiddy and not a fiddy less
---
As a newly minted lvl 30, the only help I can offer regards ammo.  Someone mentioned Excavator armor for getting lead or.  One can also get beaucoup Pb from weight rooms.  Took me a while to figure out the dumbbells and full weight bars produce lead.  The Charleston Firehouse is my usual goto.
---
It's in the floor decorations with all the small atom shop decos, (death claw statue, power armor statue etc.)
---
I am a casual player, do not fast travel, play solo most of the time, and explore everything.
---
Leveling up through about 40 can be a slow process.  
---
Once you get into the 40s, levels will come faster.
---
Took me 4 months to make L50 - about 12 levels per month. But I've gained 14 levels in the last 2 weeks - and my play time/style hasn't changed.  
---
OK, maybe a little - I used to run from WS nuke zone, now I run to it :)
---
You should be able to explore the west and middle of the divide, and ash heap if you haven't already.  You'll get more and higher level enemies (with more XP.)
---
BTW, as you level up, you can remake excavator (5 level steps) to L45.
---
Of course, you'll need to kill a lot of more miners and a deathclaw or two for the mats, so that a lot of time in the ashheap and a couple specific areas of the divide.
---
Do the questlines.  Roses quest and the mysteries quest will both take you into the higher level areas.
---
At L27, I started farm runs though WS nuke zones (albeit, with melee weapons - didn't want to run the risk of accidentally hitting a robot.)
---
Surviving will yield legendary weapons, armor or both, and some other maerials that are quite useful.
---
Keep an eye out at vendors for better weapons, especially if you do WS.
---
Explosives / Heavy  Weapons "us time" is glorious. I'd love to stumble across the two of you obliterating some mouthy stain in the wasteland. KUTGW!
---
I had a couple like that last night, 6+ addictive chems on the body.  I think maybe your luck (not your character's luck) has just been bad.  They're fairly rare, so streaks of not finding any are possible.
---
Is it possible to have both? I envision a messed up man who's shaking due to lack of chems with a sniper rifle after he aims at some it just simply blows up. He's so messed up he blew stuff up with his mind.
---
I think a nice rustic log cabin set would be nice. I'd be interested in some new rugs / carpets - both clean and dirty introduced as those seem pretty limited right now. 
---
I also really want those creepy clear bottles that have glowing yellow fluid in them with a rope around the bottle. I've seen them randomly throughout the wasteland and I just feel like they're perfect for the creepy vibe. And those hooks with meat on them you find around like Toxic Larry's would be neat too.
---
What makes their mansions gay?
---
That's crappy. Sorry :(
---
As stated, they are not showing there.  I have looked multiple times and scanned and validated install several times.  They never show up.
---
hmm na i dont buy mtx, only games. Everything bought with real life money in a game is wortheles to me. If i want something cool for real money, i buy myself something real  ^^
---
I *believe* junkie's and bloodied both occupy the same slot on the legendary list, so it shouldn't be possible to have a weapon with both.  But wouldn't that be something!
---
Feel free to add- same psn as here. Toxicity not tolerated.
---
New Vegas I made a money bed.
---
And drills
---
I've had the same issue on PS4.  It takes a few times for me to load the build menu and find it down under floor decor right where the little deathclaw atomic statue shows up.  Just tap left on the deathclaw statue and you should see your eggs.
---
It’s fun. It also runs better than before. There are still issues but it’s definitely worth $20.
---
Use the sledge then and grab a pair of perks for it.  You’ll end up using melee at sometimes in the future so not even like it’s a wasted level or anything.
---
Have you found the answer to this? I've had it pop up twice. I ran all around watoga and look everywhere but it doesnt show an actual quest marker just a giant circle around watoga to investigate. Would love to know what this leads to.
---
Full drum set
---
More instruments
---
Planters so plants aren't on rugs,lol
---
More plants/food, I want tarberries
---
More resources like the brahmin
---
Working tv or fountains
---
Different roofs
---
GARY?!?!?
---
Responders are commies. It's hinted at in the lore. Nothing American Hero about *them*
---
Yep I wanna see a comic about said man. lel
---
I lost a weapon after crashing out of a scorched Earth event. Still salty about that
---
Tbf, I do this (the only two achievements I haven't got yet are the kill 20 players and revive 20). I don't go around killing randoms but I figure wanted players are fair game. I don't loot their shit and usually drop them a legendary or ammo &amp; stims when they spawn back in.
---
Oh just buy a serum off the appropriate marketplace. They sell for about 200 caps give or take. If you don’t have starched genes yet buy a couple and just be very rad aware. Grape nuka cola removes rads and doesn’t affect the mutations.
---
That would be fine too. But I also agree with you on the second paragraph sadly.
---
I learned to ignore feedback about games to a certain extent and build your own opinion on the game. I took the leap and bought it for $60 and really enjoy it. I am originally from WV, so it definitely helps that it's home. I enjoy it, and for $20, you probably will, too! It's not perfect, but it's worth it. :D
---
I'm level 71 and post players I find on Xbox are level 130 or over and they don't trade
---
I think it's always gonna have some bugs and issues but it's definitely worth picking up. Been playin since the Beta and still find things to do all the time, stuff I haven't seen yet!
---
Thanks for assuming my perspective on how i play my game is boring for me. My junk is low, my loot is high. I like trading... so what?  The game lacks mission content. You can either associate gameplay for my behavior into gane updates, which is a very popular behavior for other who enjoy being traders, or you can continue playing the game for what is.
---
1600? Jesus Christ I only go through about 500 per fight with them
---
Gary!
---
My guess is that "guilds" will be a part of the Wastelanders update sometime this fall.
---
Jump over the counter and run into the range.  I completed this on two characters this way.  Just wait for the markers to appear on the targets so you get credit.
---
thats what i'm talking about.. HORDES!
---
True silos filled with robots.. hard to digest robots.
---
That's fine, no reason to believe some anonymous internet person.
---
If you knew I was who I said I was, would that even change your mind though?  Or are you immune from having your opinion changed?
---
No need to answer, just think about it.  You have nothing to prove to me or anyone else.
---
Scripting isn’t coding. Or at best, it’s the stepchild of coding.
---
I've seen 2!!!! I feel special. Of course I had to play three times as  long as you to see two (and the first one I think was during beta).
---
I am actually level 130 (just last night!) and most of my friends are in their 200's - you should probably try the LFG to find people who are actually selling things - instead of just trying with randoms in game! There's always people buying and selling things there!
---
If it likes mansions of the same gender, that means it's a gay mansion
---
I use mine to buy plans. Knowledge is power in this game
---
Hard Bargain level 3 and a beer. Really anything that ups your Charisma.
---
Everyone can play the game the way they see fit. Building camps, having bars, even being a raider. 
---
Come May, people wont be able to destroy camp for players in passive mode. If this is your reason for this post, then go to Survival mode and destroy at your heart's content  but dont put others down for playing the way they want.
---
If you destroy someone's 'gay' mansion when they clearly dont want to play the game that way, your just being an asshole.
---
I will know revaluate all my choices
---
I've got a pretty decent (I think) one for the Muties, race benefits/drawbacks:
---
BENEFITS:
---
\-Drastically increased Strength and Endurance
---
\-Naturally high Damage Resistance in all forms (ballistic, energy, etc), likely on par with a high-end set of armor
---
\-Completely immune to radiation
---
DRAWBACKS:
---
\-Can only wear Super Mutant armor, cannot use Power Armor
---
\-Lowered Intelligence and Charisma (Intelligence is debatable, but I'd argue that East Coast Super Mutants are *generally* less intelligent than West Coast ones; particularly the Institute and Huntersville strains, even if they're non-hostile. Grahm and Strong, while coherent and friendly, are noticeably less intelligent than say, Marcus.)
---
Let's not be \*hasty\*
---
Radstorm requirement aside... this one would be easy as shit?  For four fucking days now people have been bitching about challenges that require the camera, this is one of them.  All you'd have to do is tag someone, they tag back, you each switch weapons and click.  Done.
---
You bought the game with real money. If you like the game, and want it to continue to be playable and evolve, why wouldn’t you spend money to that end? This is a multiplayer game that has server costs, and has continued development costs. If you enjoy those things, they won’t exist without SOMEONE continuing to support them. Why wouldn’t you be one of the supporters of something you enjoy? You prefer being a leech?
---
Actually if your trading in survival (successfully mind you) you must be legendary and well-known trader in all Appalachia.
---
There will probably be way more turret camps there once Bethesda takes away camp damage.
---
Makes sense
---
It has not been confirmed at all, you are twisting Bethesda’s words.
---
I should have...a generally hate fast traveling but I wanted to see if a scorchbeast would ignore me too - that seemed to have killed my godlike abilities.  That's what greed gets you I guess.
---
I won't buy atoms until they confirm they are going to go back on offering repair kits in the atom store and going back to their cosmetic only promise. Too bad for Bethesda... I was actually thinking of buying some the week they announced that they were doing that. I don't mind them making getting atoms grindy long as it is for cosmetics only. I do mind them putting stuff in the store that will encourage them to make the game itself grindy (pay for these or the game becomes just a huge chore to play period).
---
I get what you’re saying about not knowing whether the daily challenges are even able to be changed without a patch, but I just want to point out that ESO does server-side hotfixes for stuff like this pretty frequently for consoles with no downtime, and I think they’re both running out of the same data centers because that is a publisher/parent company decision, not a developer one.
---
Yeah level 4.  Drink beer/booze?  I had no idea.  Thanks.
---
Yes they do. So if say you had a full set of Bolstering Sentinel armor. That should roughly  give you +175 Dmg &amp; Eng resistance at or below 20% health, and an additional 75% Damage reduction while standing still (or jumping). Add in all of the low health perks/Mutations and you can become a walking tank real quick. Same goes for weapons and Bloodied/Adrenal etc. . .
---
This sub: This game is so boring!  There's nothing to do!
---
Also this sub: WTF! Why aren't my daily challenges to drink a nuka cola, scrap a toy car and kill 5 ghouls?  Who has time for this other shit!
---
How much would you sell for ?
---
Art is misunderstood beauty can't be evil.
---
Serums sell for 200-450 depending on charisma. The right one can be really easy to craft. I sell herbivore. (5 bone, 5 fertilizer, 1 flux , and 1 ultracite)
---
And who made Fallout 3 assets?
---
You can't put that on the Sole Survivor?
---
Lame. Good thing I didn't buy it
---
I spend more money on the game than its worth ^^ Im a programmer myself, an i would get fired for delivering a product like this, so yea, no. The only game i ever bought mtx is warframe, because its a great game and the devs earned there money. 
---
If the game gets better, ill consider it.
---
Amazing
---
If you were the kind soul who came to kill me with two mini nukes....I apologize that my godlike ability apparently prevented that (I was in a menu when it happened - does that negate damage?).
---
I stripped naked and begged for a third shot, but they gave up.
---
Unfortunately they've pushed the SnapMatic! off until next week. The daily quests hogging up space is irksome since the other ones are ... well, also irksome. :(
---
My dad basically introduced me to video games and then fallout four. I played for almost a year and then when 76 came out he got it for me for my birthday. Now we argue over who's turn it is, but it's honestly a very wholesome way of bonding with your kid :)
---
THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN
---
Ok this is epic
---
You get downvoted for being factually wrong. They made the Fallout 4 assets. Any assets brought over from Fallout 3 was made by them. Reusing art assets doesn’t make them magically lose their origin.
---
Especially if you melee and the turrets are actually working. Just switched to a 100% melee character and the turrets in there absolutely suck.
---
God himself would be shamed by the beauty of you're creation.
---
trystan357 is great. He was really helpful to me when we were hanging out after the hot tub party.
---
Scrappy sets to make structures that look like they were just thrown together.  Some buildings you find have the look and they were also in Fallout 4.
---
Tall junk walls and spiked barricades.  I think it would be a better alternative than just concrete walls.
---
Those really tall windmills you can find in the Toxic Valley.  That asset was also in Fallout 4 on the highway by Sunshine Tidings Co-op.
---
Trailers to make a small home out of.
---
Pretty much things that are very post-Apocalyptic.
---
stretching existing content and adding new content are two very different things ;)
---
Maybe the scrubby people who cared about caps to begin with. All the good pvp’ers are already loaded with caps and could care less.
---
Name a price, I’ll put on whatever mods you need
---
griefing doesnt equal pvp
---
Yup, I'm melee and carry the syringer with that Endangerol barrel (reduces damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes) and a cryolator to freeze her with before going in face to face, special thanks to u/doop101 for the info.  Has been working wonders on finishing this fight.
---
You can disable them by hacking.
---
Atoms are shared between your characters on the same user profile. At least the longer term exploring ones are. We looked at that.
---
Just put in the unlockable only enabled then you see ez pz
---
This is simply untrue.  All challenges that reward atoms are account wide.
---
Nope the only thing that lose is time. However duping has been in every mmo that has trading even coop games. Yet most other games just patch it shortly after launch and move on no banning. They only banned people who exploited the game like getting in a dev room or cheating to the top of leader boards. Not because someone to the best crap in the game and gave them to everyone else to enjoy.
---
Sounds fair, though I still wouldn't put it past people to lose sight of the costs to get something easy and 'for free'.
---
This angers myself and my group. They build right outside the clubhouse back doors.
---
Here you go, you are the reason for games becoming grindy and designed to be frustrating so you play to fix the frustration. Rather than designed to be fun so you want to pay so you can play them.
---
Yeah the same thing is happening to me but only in the forest areas - I haven't noticed it outside of the forest. It's like there's a weird light ring around my character lol
---
Take a workstation lol. Forget about it and go do something else. You'll really love those high levels then BWAhahahahaha!
---
FO76 is a single player game that was ported (and I use the term loosely) to online, by an indie dev, brought on to make that happen (see BattleCry Studios LLC).  ESO was (correct me if I'm wrong) purpose built as an MMO.
---
Really unfair to compare FO76 with an actual MMO, or to expect it to work like one (aka 'well').  And no, the different parts don't *really* play well together, no matter what the almighty Todd may have to say about it.
---
Lead: weights, no acid needed.  Several locations (probably a lot).  170ish scrap per depending.
---
Steel: shouldn't be an issue, but WS yields about 200ish scraps per reset in a 5 minute run.  I admit that doesn't keep me full, but I can farm harder if needed.
---
Oh yes, forgot about those.
---
Bro
---
I've heard of this from several other people.
---
Couldn't have said it better.
---
Unyielding armor and low health, especially if you can find some with +charisma.
---
Yes, but usually results in fighting another player.
---
He trembles in awe at the masterpiece my hands have wrought.
---
I like this idea.
---
Canned Boiled Dog
---
Food Water
---
Yes, melee is definitely more viable in this game than others
---
I can do all the BoS mods, also all the dense chest mods, also most other mods in the game lol, you seem like a nice guy and you’ve actually tried to acquire it for yourself also, I’d be willing to help you out if you need it.
---
On PS4, username is Arcanian88
---
I upvoted you cause in the end, you're right, it is a lost cause :(. But I'm going to answer the question. Because I like this game and hate to see them start making it worse (and on purpose to in order to sell atoms). I wouldn't mind supporting the game if they made a good game designed for fun rather than a game designed to manipulate you into paying more.
---
Kickstarter that shit!
---
If you are doing a high health build I think the Vanguard's armor is the one that you would want to help out with your special stats :) it's the opposite of unyielding I am pretty sure!
---
Its the same emote, just a different icon.
---
There you go.  Thanks.
---
I felt the level thing was in 4, too. Once you get to a certain point you just start speeding through levels and the game becomes much easier.
---
Thanks, Matt. Very Cool.
---
Try what I'm doing:  new character in survival and NO HUD... it's super challenging and actually makes you have to pay attention to quests and the environment.  It's like fallout morrowind style and it's really difficult.
---
Definitely useful advice though! Thank you!
---
I've played 300 hours and seen two radstorms... you must be extremely lucky. I know I'm not the only one who has had a ton of hours and barely seen any radstorms either.
---
I would try using two weapons or more as your favorites.  When one runs low swap to the other so you can collect more ammo of the other type and keep going.  I usually switch between my lever action and sniper and handmade.  3 different ammo types.  By the time I run out I usually have plenty on my next gun.   I am always grabbing anything with steel or lead or acid top make more bullets.  Cans are excellent for this as you get lead and steal.
---
Looks like burning hater of FO76 can't accept the fact some people really like this game... Pathetic
---
Am I seriously the only person that has yet to see a live cat in this game?!  I want one...or a few...for my camp!
---
When modders can SCRIPT better than Bethesda 
---
Is that better for you Mr. Wiseguynitpicker?
---
That is awesome.  Thank you for doing that.
---
Not that I am aware of. Is it possible you got the plans from doing one of the power up events and just didn't realize it?
---
Oh cool!  How do you find out what is on sale and when?
---
....Fuck......
---
This. 
---
To the OP, sort by buildable only (see option at bottom of screen when you first open the builder). Then it should be under floor items. I've read that if you also have the deathclaw statue it might be an option there.
---
You have to server hop to get another mutation.
---
Wait, so you think taking a picture of another player in PvP during a radstorm is more reasonable/doable than drink 50 alcohol? Or a litlte better at least but take a picture of another player not just fighting a mirelurk queen but wearing a specific outfit.  
---
Really?
---
Hi! 
---
We've been reading feedback posts similar to this one and I'm happy to share that we're planning to increase the amount of flamer fuel and cryo ammo you receive from crafting when we release Patch 9 in May. We'll have more details on the numbers in the patch notes for that update.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Yeah I thought about that too as it has been a little while. But I just never knew because I never scrapped it!
---
The easiest answer to this is people not being fucking stupid and actually activating the things the game specifically tells you to activate in order to be able to actually damage the otherwise invulnerable monster.
---
But since that's not going to happen, I have one word, "Cryolator".
---
One or two vulnerability cycles and its frozen solid and dies in a second or two, even with previously inept levels of DPS.
---
They are on a timer. You can only mutate once per server for about 30 minutes or so. So you either need to wait or hop servers.
---
Hey all,
---
I mentioned this in another thread as well, but wanted to let you know that we're planning to increase the amount of flamer fuel and cryo ammo you receive from crafting when we release Patch 9 in May. We'll have more details on the numbers in the patch notes for that update.
---
I'm pretty sure you can only get one per server. So if you want to farm mutations that way you have to exit to main menu and load back into a new server, but if you stay in the mine you should spawn back in just outside when you change server.
---
How much is it?
---
Well holy cow we might just get this is game
---
Its 400 atoms!
---
Normally i entertain all ideas but its hard for my to give into socialist hooey. I earned every cap i have since day 1 of the beta. I buy all the plans i can and sell alot to vendor bots so others can benefit. I also gift low level players with a gift bag of armor, weapons, health, and ammo. So the idea of my having to spend my caps because someone feels i have too much is laughable. I trade alot! But as it is, i already possess a sickening amount of explosive energy weapons, best 2 armors in the game, every prime plan, every current camp plan minus a few rare ones... i mean the list goes on. What do you want me to buy?
---
I got a little further past the riddle and it did the same thing
---
Funny thing is I don't really see them. When I repair my armor it does list them as being on the left and right arms, we'll see.
---
Ever since survival came out I just take the workshops there and then hop back into adventure. Nobody bothers with them there and it's so easy to find a dead server with nothing taken. Also they can't find your base in survival to trash
---
Though it's also really easy to simply server hop to another adventure mode and just retake the workshops. 
---
I don't think this is as big of a deal as people say.
---
Don’t go with your heart- that always ends badly.  Go with what your head tells you, and from all our collective experiences, they DO NOT intend to offer a good game here.  It’s all about life support and milking us to make every last dime whilst walking the thin ea line to keep us from running away en masse.
---
I hate it too, but it’s out of our hands and it was a lost cause as soon as they handed it to this particular studio branch.
---
Alright it's really bothering me how ignorant people seem to be in this game and i couldn't give an f about down votes.  We all start from the same vault, what we become when we leave is down to ourselves. Want to join the Bos? Go ahead. Enclave? go ahead. There's already 90% of the game base running around mutated, sure they aren't super mutants but they are far superior to super mutants with their mutations. There's already raiders, you know those trolls and pvpers?  want to be a ghoul? Get the right mutations and build. The only thing missing is the choice of actually having the same character models as them which would be ridiculous. It goes against the whole FO franchise. I am  100% with factions and it has crossed my mind multiple times. They definitely need to implement factions that we can exclusively join and in the future maybe have skirmishes with.   Bottom line: you;re in control of your character you decide what happens and how it progresses and there are an abundance of choices. YOU decide what you want to be.
---
Thanks! I’ve been looking into getting mostly vanguard for sure with maybe one piece of unyielding Incase I do take a lot of damage and my health drops.
---
Especially with the faster fire rate of the handmade.
---
I’m debating on getting it! I have a pistol build and use a TSE Western. I have a 2 shit .44, and an explosive .44 but my main is a western. 
---
Perhaps when the legendary vendor comes out I can upgrade them :)
---
I do that as well. Depends on how much ammo I want to make, room in my stash for materials, etc. But yeah, I don't think there's a real issue here. OP just doesn't want to craft at all, and wants a straight shooter instead. Fair enough, and to each there own. No offense meant, OP, but I'm not sure why you even created this post.
---
Thank you that explains aloy
---
And if they hadn't gone back on the cosmetic only promise, I might have caved and bought some.
---
There is no such thing as workshop griefing, workshops are for PvP, if you take a workshop, you have agreed to PvP, it even says it when you attempt to contest the workshop.
---
That sounds like an awful flavor
---
Considering you downvoted me for pointing out you were factually incorrect?
---
Sure. Sarcastic twerps are always fun to educate.
---
By the way, if you bother to read the Videos of the Wasteland mod information you’ll find out it’s significantly more complicated to add this functionality than a 10 minute clip job. It’s EASILY understandable why Bethesda didn’t commit resources to what is essentially frivilous, likely used by a small percentage of players feature when you consider the state of the test of the game.
---
But sure, keep trying to be witty. I’m sure your passive agressive comments will make a difference someday.
---
I stopped taking over workshops and decided to figure out what I needed most of at the time and find that deposit out in the world and built my camp over it. It saves getting griefed at least or getting trolled.
---
About a week ago I moved my CAMP from the western edge junk pile spot to directly outside whitespring station. I made my Camp pretty cool and inviting and every single time I have been on since, I have had multiple visitors (sometimes more than I can count) and so so so many people hang around a while, trade and give away stuff. Some people run through ignoring my party CAMP completely but most people at least pop in and wave hello. 
---
It has changed the game so much for me. I was getting lonely over on the Western edge and had spent many hours making that CAMP. It wasnt an easy decision to make to scrap it, but I wanted to be closer to the action,and boy did it work. I've made a ton of friends since and I dont have a mic but use the app on my phone and it hasn't been an issue once. I dont like using mics cause I feel like a weird obligation to say funny shit and be jovial and pleasant. I'm usually gaming late at night after work after baby is asleep when I just want to drink a beer and for once in the day NOT have to talk. 
---
So if anyone is feeling apprehensive about the game, or just feeling like the world is empty and boring like I was, just push yourself out into the middle of the map. I'm not sure which other hubs are good to build near. I knew I didn't want to build right ON the golf course but wanted to be close enough for WS runs but also near a lot of people. Maybe there are other train stations that you can build as close to the station as you can WS? It's nice having a vendor 10 steps away from CAMP gotta say!
---
TL DR: I made a party CAMP right beside WS Station. It cranked the social aspect of the game to 11 and I have people running through saying hi and helping out CONSTANTLY. If you are feeling isolated or burnt out on the grind through the 20-50 lvls, try moving somewhere a lot of people congregate.  Try Next to spots where people land when they fast travel!
---
&gt;(This should have been a hotfix)
---
Sorry to say, that's really not how things work.
---
Thank you so much
---
I just checked not nuked Burrows after release and found three 1-star legendaries and one 3-star. Seems like totally random
---
Uh... pretty sure the character based ones are based on you, not your character. I've managed to finish a few with my current character that I had started with my previous character (That I scrapped so I could start off new with my friend when he got the game).
---
Hey Ernie! You want a job main? 
---
-Scarface
---
It's also got way less mob density, way less legendary spawns, no fauna to harvest when nuked, is tight quarters where other players can make hitting enemies difficult, etc.  It's inferior in every way to white springs.  And the respawn time is at least twice as high.  As long as whitesprings is what it is, going anywhere else for farming xp or legendary gear just isn't worth even considering.  If someone's there doing something you don't like, hop servers if you don't have time to deal with it.
---
There has been so such thing stated by Bethesda. 
---
Also, the search feature is you’re friend.
---
I'm on PC and haven't had anyone contest a workshop recently in Adventure. But just in case I immediately build a stash box and stash my junk whenever I am there.
---
It would be nice to have the scrap and cloth roof options we had from FO4
---
Yeah, that is also a possibility. And if not, there is always a good change you can buy of loot a tse .44 one day! I think the golden skins are definitely worth buying if you have the good weapon for it, I love the design!
---
Thanks for the help
---
They are collecting all of your items and planing to use them against you
---
If your husband us looking to replace the underarmour, then I'll sell him a BoS Officer/ Solider or Marine wetsuit, both Shielded, for 125 caps
---
There are actually banks already in the game. Why not utilize them?
---
For me, Anti armor or two shot with a multi canister works better for the broadsider if you want a combo of ammo and damage. 
---
Harpoon gun I am inclined to agree. I ditched my anti armor one when I found a quad and not having reload after every shot is much better, even if I lose out on armor penetration
---
I've had a bunch of these drop for me as well.
---

---
Hey, just a little concern here.  Having "Sheepsquat h Imposter" in the title is a bit of a spoiler.  It's been a while, but not everyone has played through the quest line and it's a bit of a cool reveal that it's not actually a real Sheepsquatch.  Any chance you could adjust it?
---
Technically it's impossible for a computer to do anything at random. Just create the issusion of randomness. 
---
It would be nice if somone with a lot more expertise than me could data mine the legendary spawn coding and see what the script is
---

---
Put on ricochet, stand between turrets and enemy NPC's.  Turrets will aggro you, you can now destroy them AND their owner without accruing a wanted bounty.  
---
You can also do this to get white springs robots to aggro on you while attacking other NPC's - this lets you farm them for exp as long as they aggro'd you.  And you get loot.
---
Note that if you keep pacifism on, you can attack the base (which will still continue to shoot you, it will turn red) but not the player until pacifism is disabled.  Even if that player is present and red to you once the turrets flag off a ricochet.
---
Yes, the devs know about this.  They don't care.
---
Ricochet is one of the most useful skills in the game, anyway.  You have at least one luck.  Get it and use it to deal with shit like this or a dozen other creative ways.  Standing between any friendly NPC that's shooting at (anything) if ricochet procs, they'll turn red to you but it counts as their aggression.
---
Now you know.
---
Hey do u have mr fuzzy tokens for sale?
---
Yes they are broken, overpowered, and only scrubs need to use them to win. I’d tell you how to get them to work, but then you would just be another scrub spamming stealthboys just to get a kill, yeah nope.
---
I really don't even bother with daily challenges. The whole system is just so aggravating at times. I just go out and look for high-level things to overcome and that's how I level up.
---
Lmao that funny haha
---
Seems like a real uptick in these posts. Hasn't happened to me yet, though. Were all these items renamed (for the PA pieces, were the full suits renamed)? I get that you're trying to talk to Bethesda and not some curious random, so feel free to ignore. Just wondering, if it is a bug, what would cause it.
---
Make sure you didn’t scrap them by accident, I almost scrapped mine a few times. What happened is when I scrap unneeded armor pieces the server lagged and didn’t respond, so I press the button a few more times, then when the server responded it reacted to multiple scrap commands at once, so when the unwanted armor piece was scrapped it moved on to scrap the next item in line.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Burrows is the new meta. Get with the program.
---
Xbox, sorry :(
---
Just better hunger and HP heal.
---
Well it's obvious they are chasing that GTA online/EA type money (especially with their adding in the repair kits. They also aren't the first company to promise cosmetic only only to go back on their word once the game is more established. And sadly it works).
---
Don't worry, they aren't getting a dime more from me on this game until they at the least go back to cosmetic only in the atom store. And I'm stubbern, EA hasn't gotten a sale from me for like 7 years at least now (more than that but I know since at least 2012) and I have not spent one dime on GTA online (though R* has proved it doesn't matter how many people don't like it, the people that don't care will spend enough money to make it way more than enough to make up for people like me :(  EA has also shown this and I was trying to warn people that other companies would watch EA and follow. So far I've been sadly proven right).
---
I used to park my camp directly in the middle of the road next to the whitesprings station, usually just out of the nuke zone. I wish the game allowed you to make drop boxes, so I could leave more than one bag of loot for people.
---
No I'm buying them and doing the quest things to get the required 450 tokens the get the suit
---
He just couldn't believe you're actually trans and dumb enough to bring this bullshit to a Fo76 sub. Assumed you're actually a troll. Stop trying to let everyone know when you find a smell that reminds you of your ass.
---
Yes sorry, just arrived home. Am in process of hopping on now.
---
Well, fuck.
---
Would have been better if you did it using the round tower technique.
---
So you spent, what, 2,000 caps plus about 10 stimpaks, and in return you got a fedora, a troubleshooter's spear, some chems, and a pulse grenade?
---
I swear to god, this feels like "Two Tokens and a Blue" all over again. Endgame itemization is in such a bad state right now it's depressing.
---
Meh, I've made "wall of text" posts with my previous suggestions. See my other post I just submitted as a stand-alone reply to this thread.
---
The link in that one, as you can see, didn't generate much either. 
---
I also had one detailing [transforming Survival Mode into Raider Mode, complete with classic Karma System](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b730e5/raider_mode_instead_of_survival_mode_better_name/). Sadly, little attention, either :( heh
---
Nerds have taken over yet another post. Pffft
---
welcome to the wasteland! glad you joined us!
---
also check out the sub https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
its the sub for good vibes, this one can get a little choppy sometimes
---
when you attempt to take a workshop, you make an agreement to enable pvp.  This is your fault.  People taking advantage of this are not griefers, just pvpers.  Im tired of seeing pvp actions being called "griefing" by these fallout veterans who arent used to human interaction outside of their basement.  Maybe next time, read the warning the game prompts prior to taking a workshop?
---
Search the sub . Its 20 of these posts a day so I’m sure people are getting tired of answering them
---
Can confirm, I frequently stand inches in front of a SB on the ground while shooting it in the face and don’t come out of caution.
---
Ummm... Did you play Borderlands?
---
Lower level players shouldn't have a need for flux.
---
Unfortunately the most obvious things are the most impossible for Bethesda to figure. It's this or they just genuinely hate us.
---
Those shouldn’t stack with assassin from the beginning. It’s like having two tier one legendary effects in one item. How about a Quad Bloodied explosive shotgun or lever action Bethesda? Why stop at the OP magic armors, lets go all the way.
---
Next time, fam.
---
No, the doubled benefits is only for health replenished and hunger satisfied. With scorchbeast meats, this means 400 health over time, which during Sheepsquatch allows you to actually tank ALL pylons for a while. Pretty amusing.
---
Never played it. why?
---
Just server hope near Camden park the get the quest things that's what I'm doing
---
And there's the reason I wouldn't normally bring it up! don't know why you would look at a post where I said the fallout community was nice and went "oh I'll show him" but that's none of my business
---
Maybe 750 or 1000
---
Just oay whatever you want. Gt knucklessyrup
---
Just play/do research for yourself
---
Good to know, I'm not one to PvP. I'm also one to not let someone destroy my CAMP either...so knowing basics is helpful! 😁
---
And hardened mass, while we're at it.
---
Use chems and alcohol. You can use the party girl perk in charisma that gives you 3x the effects of pre war alcohol. Psychobuff and bufftats give you another 3 points in strength.
---
Definitely didn't scrap them. None of us were even anywhere near a work bench. I feel really bad now because when the 1st person in our team complained about this I really thought he was just being a dumbass and scrapped it. And the 2nd and the 3rd time. Then it started happening to all of us.
---
Yeah i have to level up up again. It's just so random that it vanished. I wished it qas unequipped
---
Except assassins is trash compared to cav/sent
---
Oh,  that. I'm on PC and with keyboard/ mouse is not an issue. Probably helps that I do a little IPCC in real life. You just have to shoot,  move,  then shoot again until done.
---
Love this!
---
you mean getting killed in pvp, not griefed
---
thanks for the link! I'll check it out, always here for good vibes ✌🏽
---
Annnnnnd that explains the lever action scope Mod that won’t install either. 
---
Thanks for the follow up
---
Yup, that’s exactly where I’m camped and get business non stop for my plans shop. People will show up constantly just to look around, even when I’m off exploring elsewhere. I’ve had camps all over the map but will now be keeping my current camp for the foreseeable future. Mainly for the traffic, but also because of my flying carpet that Bethesda has since patched so I can never rebuild it again. Here’s what it looks like: https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U
---
Yea after the patch my ground has often been rainbow color, I’ve been expecting unicorn encounters.
---
I'd buy it for a dollar
---
Nuke zones become trivial with a friend where you share rad sponge and ghoulish because you can tank most glowing one damage. Even at lower levela.
---
I don't really either, it was more of a buddy helping a friend. It was the first time I ran into someone with that kind of PvP setup. Didn't know you could basically be a wall lol 😆
---
That’s like 100 atoms!!!!!
---
Pretty much. People will just stand there trying to get one shot in and then just avoid fighting for the whole event. It sucks when you've already spent a lot of ammo and stims yourself only to turn round and find half the people there hiding. 
---
Worst one I had involved everyone going after a 3* legendary gutsy, which spawned half way through the event. I don't really do this event any more unless I can see at least 3 people there over 100.
---
Ah yeah my mistake.
---
Exactly! I qpuod always have a fridge full of water and booze and nice tickle trunk full of costumes for anyone that wanted to pop by and dress up haha.
---
Because you're an attention whore, and no one cares about you politics.
---
SB aren't even hard once you're leveled. They are just an ammo/stim pack tax and otherwise annoying AF.
---
I stopped playing once I realized how trash the end game is.
---
Still, I don't think it would make idleing any worse than it already is, since you get kicked for being inactive for 30 mins or more, still need to eat and drink ect...
---
I would buy it if you're on PC
---
Hmmm...dunno.  anyone know?
---
Yes.
---
I remeber this post! Maybe it was subconscious when I moved haha. I love your CAMP. I dont play enough to stock a store but I'll definitely pop by some day if you're on :)
---
That's true, I need to get hacking lvl 3 but I am still working on more pressing perks. That's definitely on the list though
---
You mean bank buildings?
---
Very nice, furious 50 cal?  My bloodied isn't great for this event at least for solo... I die in one hit if I'm doing any kind of bonus damage :/
---
You can level out all your perk cards you want... but you will only be able to apply 15 points worth of cards
---
What exactly are you hearing?
---
I'm guessing it's a bug. It's happened to renamed pieces as well as pieces that weren't  renamed. My field scribe hat also vanished from my head yesterday 😨
---
Yes sir!
---
Well a lot of tbem sold it so they did have some personal gain. It wasn't entirely altruistic as you have framed it to be.
---
There’s about 5 ways you could’ve killed him in 1-2 seconds. Just gotta do your research.
---
Ok tell me when you are on
---
:( Thanks for the kind offer anyway
---
That’s funny, small world LoL. I’m on PS4 unfortunately. Thanks for the kind words!
---
Just another awful comment that deserves down votes, lol. Not offended in the least. Blocked #bye
---
As I said in the OP, anything "PvP" in Adventure Mode now belongs in Survival Mode. Adventure mode is for "adventure" aka questing aka solo/co-op. More importantly, PvP is specifically what Survival Mode was built for. Sure, the current rule-set for claiming workshops imply "PvP" but let's get real, a minimal % of workshops in Adventure Mode actually get claimed let alone contested let alone contested to the point of 2 adventure mode players battling each other for the territory. It happens. It happened. But a far cry from a common every day occurrence. Despite the defunct "opt-in" for pvp, Workshops + PvP together do not belong in Adventure Mode.
---
I'm confused
---
I very rarely take a workshop any more, as I don't want to hassle with PvP, but when I do, I go in fully prepared to get killed. Stash junk, be totally willing to drop caps, and find someplace to hide nearby (with mic off). Usually no one comes around, and I only go back in for the retake event. Then I server hop. 
---
But I'm not trying to craft ammo and power cores. Just want plans and xp.
---
&gt; if you didn't read this subreddit you'd never even know they knew about it. My friend doesn't bother with this but has checked their twitter and said they never ahve said one thing 
---
Completely by design.  They've acknowledged a post or two about it, avoided saying anything that youtubers will take out of context, and overall minimized the issue so perspective buyers dont see an official forum/subreddit/twitter feed full of "this issue is unresolvable" statements.  
---
I'm frustrated too but realistically this is probably low or nonexistent in terms of priority for the devs.  This entire issue will take care of itself when the camera comes out and it has no effect on gameplay.  The only effect it has on anything is reducing, though not completely eliminating, the amount of "premium currency" you can earn for free.
---
Every time I get something from the shop, I have to reboot the game. It also is the only way the shop updates after 8pm. (PS4)
---
This is gonna sound really silly, but I've been away for a bit and now that I'm back playing 76, I can't tell if the new camera feature has been added to the game or if it's still been delayed. I saw where it was delayed last week, so I'm not sure if it came out this past Tuesday or not. There's challenges for it, so it would make sense that it's in t game, but most of the stuff I'm seeing online is talking about how it was delayed. If it is in the game, where do you go about finding it? Same thing  for the player vending that was on the road map. Is that in like it's supposed to be?
---
I thought you could totally change appearance as much as you wanted , I haven't tried to personally. I have a teammate that changes his all the time to different celebrities.
---
After one of the patches my PA often unequip certain pieces, like torso or a leg. But those pieces were still in my inventory, i just had to constantly check and put them on. It was a real pain but seems they fixed it in later patches. Did you check your stash to see whether you put them away by accident?
---
Yeah they could be good too, i pretty much just say the whitesprings since its becoming the "player hub" and it has the robots and stuff already there, also like the other guy above me said, it wouldn't really fit into lore to have these banks but then again, neither does stash boxes so meh.  
---
I dont mind either way, would be nice to be able to put caps away then go and engage in pvp or something instead of spending them all or losing them on death
---
You can store it and be able to place it back down, but if you scrap it you won't be able to make it again.
---
Im not asking anybody to care about my politics, and I'm not asking for attention (if anything you are, by trying to start shit with a total stranger online). The only reason I brought it up was to note it as a positive, which apparently went directly over your head
---
The same thing as would happen they buy it directly from you. The extra caps get lost.
---
Haha duh. No worries take it easy!
---
TFW you're reading a conversation about Football in a Fallout thread, and someone mentions throwing INT and you are confused for a moment as you wonder why they'd be throwing *Intelligence*...
---
Sick thats pretty good
---
Octo Barrel has 8 per clip and reloads all at once.. but has a non-recyclable ammo
---
Quad Harpoon has only 4 per clip, ammo weighs more, BUT has recyclable ammo
---
On now
---
You can change appearance! But if you switch sex and then switch back, it'll just give you a random preset, so when I swapped back, the F character I had designed was gone
---
lemme talk to my circle. Pm me a list of which ones you need.
---
Glad there's at let one person out there who appreciated this. I guess there's not a lot of crossover between Fallout players and golf fans.
---
I ran it once nuked and found no legendaries in the burrows but there were plenty street level and it seemed like hardened and glowing mass were dropping on everything with many dropping 2-4 of each. Tons of raw flux over there also
---
I guess all these unroasted radroaches will just have to wait...
---
\[Thanks\]([https://i.imgur.com/dvv1Te9.gif](https://i.imgur.com/dvv1Te9.gif))
---
Vanguard provides +35 DR/ER when at high Heath. Sadly there is no prefix that gives additions to special on hight Heath.
---
Yes! I agree to all points. Having a safe place to store caps is very beneficial. You could even make it so all purchases from the player vending machines all go to your bank account.
---
Damn it, are you on PS4 , if so we got a cool group , if you're ever looking for allies.
---
If you're confused about part of this post, please let me know which part so I can edit for clarity!!
---
I think it only works with events. Uranium Fever, for example. When I’m solo there are hardly any mole miners. 2 other guys show up and shit it’s the fan with how many there are.
---
Trash or not the effects are being multiplied, that’s why you see people stand still or hop like a bunny to be unkillable most of the them. It’s just absolutely absurd for this to happen in a shooter game when a 12 year old knows you need to duck and hide when pew pew each other.
---
I play PS4, yeah! (think my computer would explode if I tried to run a Bethesda game lol)
---
*This* does make sense, I've noticed the same thing at Uranium Fever.
---
If I see someone struggling, ill help them out. Anyone who needs some rad away, stimpack, food or water. Simply has to ask. I henerally havr 100+ purified water and 50+ grilled ragstag
---
Anyone launching any nukes today? Got robbed this morning during a SBQ event now looking for redemption
---
No, it's not.
---
Oh my mistake sorry!
---
Just wait for next patch on Tuesday 
---
Last patch created this bug
---
You know you don't have to pick a card from the same category as the point you picked.
---
I would like 1k also
---
Happened to my low level character last night. I was just dumping my junk in the stash box when someone contested the workshop. Me (mid 30's)  vs. A level 80 player. He contested and 1 shot me with an explosive shotty, Then destroyed the turrets and extractor with ease. It was enough to make me switch to my main character and have an easy fight.
---
The woman character transman thing
---
Don’t rush levels, enjoy the scenery of the game
---
- Follow the main quest. You'll level up at a decent speed and hit a lot of places. After that, explore your ass off.
---
- Have an idea of what kind of build you're going for. It'll take time to respec if you don't like it.
---
- Most of the people you meet in Adventure mode won't give you a shitty time and can be very helpful. Be friendly back.
---
Give us more free stuff :P 
---
I don't think you realise where this is heading all that cool new stuff they keep putting in the shop is useless to them if you can make enough atoms to buy everything you want or even most of what you want. No they want it set up so you can buy maybe one or 2 items per 60 hours and newer better  stuff is always around the corner an endless treadmill made for the 1 in 100 who actually pays out any buys the atoms on the regular the rest of us are just here for window dressing for them. "Live service gaming" Almost makes me wonder what comes next after this like what the next big "innovation" in separating fools and their money.
---
I wished there wasn't even a stash limit. I don't see how it makes the game better. It's just annoying. I want to go out and spend time exploring and not managing my stash weight.
---
Sorry, I cleared this up in another comment so I'll just make an edit to the post at some point. I'm a transman (irl) and my character is a woman bc easier to design (in my opinion)
---
That really depends on you - is the weapon worth it to you to grind out? Is it something you're really going to use or is it better than your current weapons? If not you could always just buy it from another player.
---
No they’re not hard at all, but why fight them when i can spend quality time with some handsome ghouls.
---
So does this mean my hobby of developing in Unreal Engine is coding or scripting?  Honest question.
---
Yeah, no ones gonna buy your bullshit. You're self absorbed and are here fishing for pity points, fucking protected up the ass and you still need to try and get people to sniff your own shit.
---
Yes, checked and checked again. I really wish that was what happened. My hubby is collecting the flux he needs to make a new shielded suit right now but I think he'll quit the game if we lose any of our rare items.
---
I'm hopefully here to laugh *with* you, not **at** you, when I point out that you said:  
---
*"paper* [machete](https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=machete) *armor"*   
---
... instead of paper-mache lol
---
^((or) *^(papier-mâché)* ^(if you want to be) *^(really)* ^(anal heh))
---
Oh ok I see I thought you meant you were a transman in game and I thought that was a anew update lol
---
You sound like you think you make the rules, you don’t, Bethesda does. And the rules are clear when you contest it, workshops are PvP areas, that’s why the game lets you fight other players there, either accept that and the possible consequences like you should have when you clicked yes to the ingame prompt, or stop whining about a game mechanic so many have whined about before, it’s not going to change, Bethesda wants these to be contested.
---
Get over it or move on.
---
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that because Survival mode was introduced, that Adventure mode is now a pvp-free space.
---
This is false.   
---
Workshops are a PvP objective, if you don't want to risk PvP, don't use workshops.
---
Todd please...
---
was posting for brevity before my phone died; forgot my charger. Theyve been getting a little picky about my browsing on work machines.
---
as I kinda figured, a bit of google and others commentary would get ya the rest if the way there. 
---
Get it worked out?
---
No they aren’t . The standing still and hopping is all sentinels . The math is different on how they work but yes sent/cav=op assasins=icing
---
Go to Toxic Larry meat and go      Grab every note
---
Then go to Southern motel belle and look for other note in the patio table
---
I missed the camo hunting rifle on the first go around, it's the only thing I still want to buy. I'm sure they'll make a "Hunter" pack at some point.
---
No the challenges cannot be completed.
---
Would have enjoyed watching the orbital strike. 
---
I Hate lazily built bases. Put some effort in , have a few pretty purple lights , have a garden with a shrubbery , place a TV , plant a few potted plants , put up a nice picture and stick an Owlet on it, throw down a nice rug and a Piano ontop...Choose luxury, Choose proper camping.
---
Thanks I figured it was some sort of new bug
---
A turret gate, (junk, wood, barn, warehouse, brick, metal) with a platform either side of the adjoining hinges that you can snap turrets to, to divide access to your main structure and make harder for enemy mobs to raid you
---
Leaving access down to whether or not it’s locked for other players
---
Appreciate it :) thanks, going for a power armor build I think
---
Definitely
---
It was fixed for quite a while, they recently broke it again though.
---
Immediately drop missiles and don’t even think about keeping rocket launchers.
---
If you haven't done the Burrows yet - you can pick up the Waste Management quest from the dead BOS body in the entrance.
---
Personally?  
---
When I come across a Mini Nukes that are sitting out waiting to be collected... I just really would like to be able to detonate it by **shooting** it! \^\_\^
---
The already offered that twice.  Once by itself.  And as part of a camo pack in March.
---
I agreed. That's why I think their whole purpose is the act as an consumables tax (mostly bullets/stims) so it forces you into a scavenging loop for powder/lead/steel/plastic.
---
They’re bad?
---
Already did it, was wondering about all the other new side quests and daily quests
---
That’s good to hear...it’s a great source of some of the harder to find chems I like to use
---
So, useless then, thanks sad. Oh well, thanks!
---
Hmmm.  I reboot after im done playing every day.  Ill try rebooting the game after I buy the egg tonight.  If that doesnt work, i may have to reinstall.
---
400 caps
---
You got a good point. Saw the weapon for these week which didn’t look half bad but I am not a heavy build and I don’t have the room for a fat man. I guess I will just check weekly to see if any good melee weapons. Thanks for the input.
---
You're right, the servers arent laggy enough. That'll do the trick
---
So foods like mole rat chunks that increase STR by +1 should be +2 then correct?
---
Lol. It was rather late and I had a feeling I had it wrong but convinced myself the t was silent in this context.  With the nerf of weapon damage they’ve done it does feel like our machetes are made of paper.
---
Oh wow 300/150? Whenever I clean up my stash, I keep 50 of the important and 30 of the other stuff, never had any problems. (Except gears and springs, I always have 200+ of that)
---
I have never seen that happening ever since Halloween last year, they fixed it like for an hour or something?  Also u/zakificus \-- how do you get the faction tags next to your name, like the "Enclave" you've got.
---
Only HP and hunger, never mind I misread..
---
ok look I'm gonna stop responding after this because clearly you're getting off on "provoking" me (despite the fact that, you know, you aren't. You're a mild nuisance at best). Being trans probably has the least to do with me as a person as it possibly could. I only brought it up in the post because the gaming community gets a bad rap (because of people like you) in regards to their treatment of minorities. I mentioned it because I thought it was really cool that the community was so accepting contrary to what people believe. Idk why you seem to think I'm trying to garner attention here when you're the only one that keeps going with this argument. If you'd have said literally anything else, I'd have just left a polite comment and been on my way (as I did with every other comment on this post)
---
They're really heavy! They will weigh you down quicker than you can spit!
---
No problem. it’s not easy finding low lvl armor, but if you do all the horde events and any others that give legendary enemies in the forest region you’ll find a set eventually.
---
No. It should mean it will be easier to move camp with multiple foundation pieces (though the language of the newsletter is not extremely clear).But they didn't say anything about the other parts of the structure that cause problems in moving camp to a new spot.
---
Me too, I'm on PS4 and it's the only way to update.
---
I’d like to see a second stash with a much lower limit, (the additional 200 you mentioned would be plenty), then I could separate the sets of gear I switch between regularly. That said, I’d settle for a standard stash increase.
---
I appreciate that’s probably never going to happen by the way. But it would massively improve my game.
---
There is a website, whose name escapes me, that'll let you look at different builds. Someone on here may know the name (or Google). Use it to your advantage for sure. It'll give you a good idea of what you need to get perk card wise.
---
It has to do with the stability of the game. It's annoying, but necessary to having stable servers that aren't bogged down with too much stuff.
---
I’ll look around for it thank you!
---
It was supposed to be added this Tuesday but it was delayed until next Tuesday. Why yes, half the daily and weekly challenges do need the camera and can't be completed without one. Yes that is silly. Of course they know about it. No, they aren't going to "do" anything about it. I know, I'm disappointed too. I don't know when they'll "fix" it but it probably won't be until next Tuesday. Well they might break something else when they did, I don't know. Maybe they will fix the modding and repair glitch while they're at it, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
I would definitely recommend looking up perk cards that are good for your build so you have an idea of what to pick up here and there as you go- I know I messed up my cards pretty bad my first go round. You can always change them after level 50 but it helps to get started on the right path :)
---
Figured, thanks!
---
We’re gonna need it when our decorations are taking up our stash space also ;).
---
Stopped being available at vendors in February.  And is a rare drop otherwise.
---
15 is the special limit, you can select a special that you already have a perk card for (from a pack) then select master slugger but if your plan on running all the slugger cards that leaves you with 6 points in strength to use. This is why having multiples and remembering to switch between combat and passive cards when appropriate is important.
---
Best of luck. :)
---
That’s the main thing I’m worried about is messing up the cards but I’ll do some research while it’s downloading thank you!
---
My friend was shooting stuff in my camp (we were making fun) when all of a sudden he was like “dude my tse lever just transformed into a 50 cal”. One second Insaw him shooting his tse, the next second it was gone. I checked his inventory, checked every corner of my base for a paper bag – nothing. It was just gone.
---
You act like this is new or changable behavior. Kids will be kids
---
1K.  Maybe 2k with the right buyer.
---
No problem, I'm not much of a pvper myself. But they've actually put a list of the upcoming weapons in their most recent inside the vault that even lists the challenges you'll need to complete to obtain them- sorry I don't have a link rn but I'm at work lol - there's going to be a deathclaw gauntlet that's pretty neat in the beginning of June that's actually going to draw me in there.
---
Squatting or stealth boys
---
The current rule-set for workshops in Adventure Mode comes down to griefing plain and simple. Griefers and trolls exploit it despite having Survival Mode. They're not there for PvP on an equal playing field. They're there specifically to exploit and profit off a player base largely uninterested in battling other players. If they wanted genuine pvp, they'd be in Survival Mode servers. Opt-in or not, PvP has little-to-no place in Adventure Mode except in the most extreme events that scale properly between both players ensuring an equal playing field. The opt-in and rule-set you're referring too is completely defunct and will be changed in the near future by Bethesda for the greater good, guaranteed. It's almost comically out-of-place in Adventure Mode.
---
Bethesda said you can't have a functional game but you can have this ! 
---
In reality yeah on rereading my original post it sounds like that's what I was saying but I just phrased it weird lol
---
I think that may have changed. A month ago I could do UF solo and see barely any spawns. I did it solo 2 or 3 days ago and there were a whole lot more spawns than I remember. I did it again yesterday with one other person and don't remember seeing more spawns than my solo run.
---
I'd have to run in a bunch more times to know for sure though.
---
Your realize your entire reply is an entire paragraph about your self. That's my whole point, you're a self center twat. You don't deserve any recognition or attention for what amounts to an uneventful fallout 76 session. 
---
No one gives a fuck about you!
---
I would be salty too...Ive had 3 star weapons from sbq turn to one star the next day as well. Always a good feeling when you find out..
---
It's possible I'm mistaken, I thought a couple of patches back, they actually corrected it. I could be confusing it with the fix for hardened masses getting scrapped automatically or something.
---
On PC (not sure about mobile) but to the right side of your screen, underneath the "readers" and "users here now" counters, is a check box with "Show my flair on this subreddit it looks like:" followed by your user name, and an "edit" button. Just edit, select and save.
---
Next challenge: take a picture of another player on February 29th!
---
The Brotherhood is and always will be the best faction. (Ignore Arthur Maxson’s Brotherhood)
---
Broken for me too.
---
Like where else?
---
Nice thanks I forgot about that definitely will go look at the forms. Thanks
---
That is fixed though unless they broke it again too with the last patch.
---
Would a two shot fat man do anything to a camp?
---
If player vending machines were a separate stash, with a limit independed of the camp stash....
---
Main reason I'm so overloaded right now is all the stuff I would like to sell (for more than what vendors offer), but have no place to store it...
---
Do as many hoarde events as they usually spawn 3 star legendaries that aren’t that hard to kill. Also it gets a fair amount of xp.
---
I'd be fine if they reduced the number of allowable players on a server to 1.
---
That way I can play the game by myself with no restriction. 
---
"Just play fallout 4."
---
No.  I want to play FO76..... by myself.
---
To be completely honest, everyone gets harassed online, not just women. I had a group of 3 women and one man grief my camp and then start harassing me in the party. The dude was pretty chill but the 3 women were fucking horrible. I did kill them multiple times but that's not to say that all women are angles online
---
Sure. I'mat work right now, so you'll have to wait though. It'll be home in about seven hours from now. I'll message you then.
---
It's 6700 caps from a vendor for me, so I thought 2k was fair.
---
Good luck in Appalachia!
---
Amazing ! Could you show me your perks build ?
---
You may be able to do that with private servers soon enough
---
How? Those both take place hundreds of years after 76...
---
You might enjoy a bit more Adventure and consider Survival for a time when you have a good handle on the mechanics.  Both modes are awesome, and have their own issues at the same time.  The Adventure community can be great when you're new.  Pay it forward!
---
Westtek
---
Omg. If I lose my gun I'm quitting the game.
---
Here's my two cents- 
---
I enjoyed the dungeon it looks awesome- it's so confusing it makes any trip down into a full on slog- I even enjoyed the little bits of PvP that happened down there since it's cramped and shots are going off all over. 
---
The only thing I didn't like is how everyone in the same area were all put into the same quest, so when I got lost and a random finished the quest i essentially missed out on the 'boss'- I wish it wouldn't do that, I was having fun exploring and finding my own way, to be slapped with quest complete halfway through. 
---
Other than that one slight problem and the fact BGS made it out to be something it wasnt- I really enjoyed it- and being able to nuke there makes a great piece of repeatable content. 
---
I'm with you on the negan thing, I had a similar feeling when I went through it- not that BGS ripped it off or anything but the feeling I'd met someone who sounds like this before. Couldn't quite place it, but you're right it is negan
---
They did say that it would allow for them to place down junk items as static items in the camps so there was that.
---
I didn't realize you were the president of adventure mode
---
I want to be sure I understand this right, pumpkin grenades are useful against the the sheepsquatch? I figured they wouldn't be considering what it is.
---
Still not appearing in the atomic shop. Wtf?
---
/r/AmItheAsshole 
---
NTA - not even remotely on you.
---
I feel like Bethesda should make the area right behind the club a no camp zone.
---
Even I try to help all glass connoned out. Can’t hold a pylon for more than a few second without dying but I’ll give it a go.
---
I doubt this would work (for a number of reasons), but what about a weapons/armor specific stash (or both) with no weight limit, but a limit on the number of items?  That seems like a reasonable compromise.
---
Hell, make individual stashes for armor, melee, ranged, PA, cosmetics, food, aid, notes...etc.  I'd even go for them having a shared stash limit...make one container where you can dump stuff, but the individual types only *display* what the stash type is designed for (though I'd still like another stash increase if they did it that way).
---
It’s a exploit I also posted about this last night as well sadly
---
Now that's a shitty bug. I haven't seen that one yet, but I plan on playing until the servers go down for good so it's only a matter of time ...
---
Same to me! Try to add some differnt mods on my Power Armor but it is not working like whole fallout 76!
---
I have a female character in game and one day whilst playing with my guy he called me into the other room to look at his screen and my female bodied character had the default Nate head. Everything looked normal on my end. Sooo who knows what Bethesda is doing, some days I don’t think even they do!
---
I can make them for you for the materials and some caps
---
Make motovs. Team with a friend. Whitesprings Golf club. Sleep. Inspirational perk. Cranberry relish. Have friend keep spawning in ghouls. Have member run through golf club. Get them all to come outside near red truck. Through motovs to get hits on all of them. Have friend kill all ghouls. You will gain xp quickly
---
It makes the game better by not affecting server stability by dedicating limited resources to tracking the inventory of the thousands of items of the dozens of players per server. However, given their hard limit of 1500 pounds per player (that's when you have to destroy stuff instead of drop it) that indicates stash limits can probably go a bit higher (likely that magic 1,000 number) but they probably want to keep their powder dry on that and use that storage capacity for camp displays, player vending and upcoming backpack content and assess how that affects server stability before they start messing with increasing stash capacity.
---
The 3 egg us not appearing in the atomic shop
---
Go to survival for 20% more experience. I level all my new characters there now.
---
That’s a bummer, did you also checked mules? Happened to me once i lost a leg piece, I got really upset and thought there must be a glitch. Turned out when I unloaded a bunch of stuff to my mule account I unloaded that leg by accident. Hope you can find the fluxes you need. If you’re on PS4 I can give you some, i have a bunch of extras I crafted when I had nothing better to do lol
---
Just like my life surronded by garabage
---
I am considering moving my camp soon so I dont want those to go to waste. How much are you thinking?
---
I’d be pretty pissed as well, I have to admit.
---
Oh dear god that would be been strange
---
Was that mod for Xbox 1?
---
Which is why I think it’d be good to have at least one or two pieces of unyielding in the event your health does drop low while still wearing the vanguard to increase dmg resistance. Or do you think I should just wear unyielding regardless, then if in battle my Heath does drop low I’ll have the boost to get out of a pinch.
---
Dunno about the rest of you, but I read this is a pirate voice
---
For me, a lot could be solved by my rifles not weighing twice as much as a full suit of PA.
---
Double barrel no question, damage might be higher on the harpoon (not sure) but the dps will be better on the shotty. Plus you can afford to carry 1k of ammo without it weighing a ton
---
And magnetic personality, if in a group
---
Crouching requires you to shoot the enemy once for about 5 seconds of vats time. Invisibility is permanent protection.
---
There was one time it bugged out and I could not vats target a standing or sprinting player. It was weird.
---
They've posted about it, it will take a (probably minor, if you can call it that) rework of the item type listings to enable 'scrap all' to exclude bulked scrap.  Doesn't seem like a big deal, but nothing is ever as easy as it seems.
---
I *think* they tried it a while back, and it broke something else...someone with an actual functioning memory would have to chime in here :P
---
500 caps I’ll do it
---
Yep the taxmen on wings, screaming at us until we give in lol
---
True but no one just sells junk, always legendaries
---
If PC I will offer you 2k for it.
---
Boomer is not at Watoga. He is northeast of Harper's Ferry at the Southern Belle MOTEL (not Hotel for your information). If you go from the bench where is his propped up against, take a left and walk towards the railing. On the furthest white patio table is a note which starts the other one. It helps to do your research.
---
Careful, if Bethesda reads this then they'll likely just nerf the loot drops of the rest of the creatures instead.
---
Source? Like from the wiki or something?
---
Honestly if that's what you're looking for you should just quit playing the game.
---
As you play the game and experiment with different weapons you'll find some more fun than others. I would stick with the fun ones.
---
Unfortunately it’s XB1 but thanks for the idea of worthiness.
---
Gary?
---
That's true but not 50k caps
---
I am a glass cannon. Take one, die and bleed out for 30 seconds  I stay the conduit the whole time I am dying.
---
Upvoted..
---
we live down on the 3rd hole near the mirelurk pond in a civilized estate with proper houses, and we will not be having any troubles in our neighborhood !! By all means wreck unsafe structures up near the Golf course though as they do not comply with Whitesprings health and safety and the make our neighborhood look rough :P
---
I like to set up on the top pet of whitesprings where the little office building is
---
I don’t know about armour but for weapons you should look for :
---
&gt;literally anything with explosive 
---
&gt; Two Shot
---
&gt; Anti- Armour
---
&gt; Poisoners ( machete )
---
&gt; Bloodied
---
&gt; Furious 
---
&gt; Quad
---
I don’t know about Junkies since it’s a thing people with a junkie build needs but they don’t really sell that much.
---
I’m on PS4 and can do all the underarmors if you need one no charge of course, enclave I think has better stats but I can make you which ever one you want
---
If you get him to Level 7 you can grab Hard Bargain...  Might be worth it.  Pricing looks like Hard Bargain 1, 2 or 3 is the equivalent of adding Charisma +3, +6, and +9, respectively.
---
You could always make a "Buying XYZ junk" post tho\~ I actually sell junk / plans / outfits - I don't deal in legendaries\~ I think maybe you are not looking hard enough at this point lol
---
What exactly is the point of this post, other than to bitch?
---
Will def get him to 7 ASAP.
---
And I thought the wrong animation triggering for those AoE mutations was wonky!
---
Someone might have mentioned already, but the perk called starched genes available in luck at lvl30 allows you to have permanent mutations with diminished negative effects. This is always for me, the the point where the game becomes so much easier. You can get mutation serums for around 300 caps from people. Pick 4-5 you like ( for a rifle build you can get speed demon, eagle eye, marsupial, adrenaline, etc.)  And turn your self I to a mutant!
---
Nothing explicitly stated, but there is evidence. Just some notes and connecting the dots. I'll have to put together some evidence and make a post
---
I suspect they'll reword the linking on the base items so that one item becomes the anchor block (probably specific items, since I don't think your armor bench would make a good one :P ).  If that's the case, either you'll need to rebuild your camp to take advantage of that, or it will assign it to a random foundation (or decided in some other specific way), which may or may not work the way you want it to.
---
It's an interesting step, but I suspect it will not be without some drawbacks.
---
This problem will continue as Bethesda keeps adding claim workshops as challenges...
---
Yup that’s the idea, if one person takes all three then they have the bleed out time and if they park their ass next to the respawn area they are easy to revive.  As glass cannons we are waaaaaaay more valuable in the fight than working the mechanic.  Only think we haven’t tried yet is a healer flamer build keeping the conduit player alive the whole time.
---
Mods. Scrap all would scrap mods. Something of how everything is set up,... You can either set it to scrap all and it scraps mods, or set it to scrap all and it scraps bulk. I prefer the latter until they come up with a solution.
---
Watch out mentioning this here, they'll down vote you out of existence.
---
Workshops! Despite the pvp element they are fast and easy to take/defend. And you get plans every time, and usually enough stims to make it worth it anyway.
---
I bullet vs many pellets. It’s like a rifle vs a shotgun
---
I’d just read through the posts in the market and you’ll see what sells well. You’ll also be able to monitor trends in what people are after. 
---
The bloodied sentinel build stuff seems to sell well, instigating tse and assassins also seem popular atm if that helps at all. I’d certainly check for yourself though.
---
Imagine a fucking wendigo dungeon and there is like 100 wendigos that are level 60 each
---
I apologize for disagreeing with you but... Historically Pvpers have the attention span of a puppy. They'll be long gone as soon as the next big PvP game comes out. Not every game is suited for PvP and shouldn't cater to the PvP crowd IMO. FO76 is not, was not and should never be about PvP. It is a nice side thing to do ingame when you want to experience a more unpredicted adventure but the key to this game's longevity is replayability, period. What bethesda should focus on if they want people to keep playing this game which should be the most important thing on Bethesda agenda is either, make the end game a WHOLE LOT more interesting or they need to cater more to the folks that like to re-roll toons and re-experience the game all over again from a different playstyle without having to actually start from scratch. Making it easy to transfer items between characters would be a huge step in that directions.
---
It does less base damage, I know that
---
In case anyone else finds this thread the suggestions by WorldsOkayestDad (farm by pumpkin patch) and jkateel (Wavy Willard's Water Park) both worked well for my needs. I already had all of the stabilizing materials, I needed quick raw cobalt flux. The water park takes a little more effort as you have to hunt down the blood leafs but you do get more flux. The farm is super quick - just gather the corn from the two patches of it at the farm. There are some berries and glowing resin on the hill overlooking the farm as well to make up any amount to the nearest 10.
---
deadpelicanguy's suggestion of Morgantown is also probably your best bet if you needed the stabilizers from the green booger monsters as well.
---
Are you using another account to transfer to your mule? Group and share hard bargain.
---
I read this while eating pizza
---
I am now searching my home for cameras. I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING ME, OP. YOU WON'T BE GETTING MY PIZZA THAT EASILY!
---
Thanks for this, I tried it today and it worked really well. I've written how it was in a separate comment as I tried the other suggested spots as well.
---
you agree to enter pvp mode when taking a workshop, plain and simple.  If you cant wrap your mind around that concept there is no argument to be made with you.
---
Pearly Peepers
---
And it's a Sentry Bot wearing a chef hat
---
Cobbleton Farm
---
I think it's still a possible drop at top of the world or Grafton steel. I can't remember which, but I picked it up from one of two about a month ago.
---
That’s great to hear! It’s harder to get the masses and fluids you need since there isn’t much out there. But if you have saved up from other places, you’ll be set for a long while. :)
---
58 year old guy her. No hand eye coordination. I used a tse shotgun on the shooting range. Tried 30-40 times before passing. On the obstacle course i kept failing. I got marsupial after failing it 20 times Get a veiw where you can see the beam. If u fall jump back up. Learn where the markers are. Make sure u don't start till you can see the gold diamond  to show you starting  and completion. 
---
It can be done. Its not impossible. This old guy did it and so can you
---
PS in one sitting i started trying to finish Back to Basics  At the shooting range. 12- 15 Attempts,  I finally beat it one time. Then i failed the obstacle course twenty tines. then i went and got lucky and got marsupial on my first attempt. I returned to obstacle course and just kept trying. Finally I was screaming for joy when I completed it.
---
i couldnt agree more.  Adventer never was/will be a safespace for weenie hut juniors who cant handle pvp.  If you dont like pvp, please see fallout 4 or its predecessors
---
West Tek, generals steak house, sunny top ski lanes, and basically anywhere else you can spawn high lvl super mutants. 
---
Heck even farming the sentry bots at whitesprings give TONS of XP and 5.56 and fusion cores, circuitry etc. And they respawn about as fast as you can kill them.
---
There are all kinds of places to farm where asshats can't put a turret camp. I don't like turrent camps either but they are far from being the worst things in the game. At least in my opinion.
---
Putting your weapon away in survival
---
Just read your other comment. Sounds like you did well. Awesome!
---
So what you're saying is that I have to crouch to be in stealth? What if I'm not crouching and I'm instead standing upright, can I be in stealth mode? What if a player is standing right in front of me? Will there eyes stop working when I equip this perk?
---
I'll get back to you on that
---
You exaggerate greatly dude. I'm level 72 melee and carrying that much purified water+boiled water+wpns+armor+food+other aid would be possible but unfun weight micromanagement.
---
Free purified water would break the vendors easily everyday as soon as 2 industrial purifiers are able to be made by a player during  a playthrough leaving no reason to loot the world unless Beth made all loot untradeable since everybody would just buy what they needed.  Unless purified water was also made to not be also tradeable like ammo. 
---
40K?? There may well be somebody who paid that but that was his/her last trade for 2 months...and they don't fast travel or buy plans/recipes. What's next cook books containing guaranteed unknown recipes, guns and ammo mags that give 20 mod plans apiece??
---
TL;DR: Free purified water wouldn't work with game dynamics.
---
More damage to scorched and lower base damage than the normal one but has a faster fire rate to make up for it
---
It has been removed
---
In TES5 Oblivion there was a Painting that was a door that took you inside the Painting.
---
@ 1 min 45. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMy8iMXqVKU
---
It would have been fine if players did not duplicate the shit out of them. 
---
I see one piece of sentinel it cavaliers about every 100 levels. Nobody would be able to farm up their own complete set. Trading could have been an important part of the game, but dupers tainted it. And now everyone is just angry at each other.
---
Or a medic weapon. Life saving and Mysterious Savior help too.
---
The tv anchorman from the beginning of 4, talking about the bombs dropping for 3 minutes then *BLEEEEEEP* Atom bomb image.
---
No.  They weren't stealth.  I was engaged and could see them clearly.
---
The guy's name is Usain Bolt, not "Hussein"
---
Seems to be an uptick in posts about loosing gear. More than can be explained by fat fingers.
---
I'm putting my best gear in my stash for a bit just to be safe.
---
Definitely not on a mule. The first time it happened to me I thought I was losing my mind. One minute I was running around thinking how freaking awesome my character looked in her outfit, next minute my hat was gone. Lol. (I had just checked one of the vendors to see if I can sell to them but their caps was 0. Exited the trade menu. No more hat on my head. Re entered the trade menu and now the vendor had R1400 caps).
---
The problem isn't people camping Whitesprings, the problem is there are very few places worth a fuck to camp.
---
I’m guessing we’ll get them as a trickle over time
---
3 have been released so far!
---
I'd like it, but people would moan about camp defense/not being able to attack people. I could also see it being about someone attacking someone and then retreating into an invincible fort in pvp. For adventure mode it'd be awesome though.
---
Definitely starting out with Adventure
---
Sounds familiar - don't mark mods or bulk as scrap.  But then you might not be able to use bulk items in crafting if it only uses uses scrap to craft, so you'd have to be able to craft with scrap *and* another kind of item, so bulk would be an item type of it's own, which might cause other problems, and you'd need to make sure you use scrap before bulk....yep, I think that's what it was.
---
Simple problems don't always have simple solutions :P
---
Radium rifle or anything with rad damage will help finish them, but, its tough enough to stay alive without thinking about swapping weapons while trading shots.  Weapons with an "irradiated" prefix - so you're dealing both physical and radiation damage - are a huge help.
---
About A 10-second Sprint Northwest of Summersville, small bridge that can spawn 3-5 scorch or 3-5 mongrels. In the riverbank south of the bridge spawns several low level mirelurks!
---
The noise of the disc reader is more or less making a sound constantly and thats normal, but when inspecting an item it makes a slight break in the sound the reader is making.
---
i honestly dont see a problem. could you explain?
---
The 4th one will come in 4 hours I think
---
Damnit I only have 2.  I missed one!
---
As Mason said, I use it for diluting stims or other meds. Plus, I never have to worry about water. Plus Plus, if I have extra or am at a vendor that has like 123 caps remaining I'll just use my water. It doesn't weigh too much so /shrug
---
No I need to work on that.
---
I'd take less stash space for a larger photo gallery
---
Ohhh ok gotcha
---
No from one interactions with the responders
---
Personally I love weightless and no one can convince me otherwise. Having an extra 30-40 lbs of loot space is worth the two or three extra shots an enemy takes with a non combat maxed build.
---
Worked out great. But I think I confused everyone else on the server 😁
---
Tips for power armor at low levels:
---
Remember that power armor pieces have level requirements. You have to be at least level 15 to use armor pieces. At level 15 you’re looking for raider armor, it’s all you can wear for a few levels. 
---
Power armor chassis aren’t level specific. So if you find power armor before level 15, just strip the armor pieces off and take the chassis. 
---
Always place power armor instead of dropping it. You can get into it either way, but placing it doesn’t cause issues. If you drop it to get into it, someone else could take it. Or if you disconnect before getting in it, it’s just gone. 
---
Best place to find raider power armor regularly (to farm for all the pieces) is a location called top of the world. Head that way early on, but be careful, there are super mutants or mole miners there. 
---
Those are just a few tips off the top of my head. Enjoy the game!
---
Absolutely not an exaggeration. 
---
Thanks for being a negative Nancy on a cool idea though.
---
Damn that sucks :/ I missed out on the first one not knowing that it was a thing.
---
This may sound like a stupid "workaround" but it's... worked for the most part.
---
(a) if you're on PC, get this delightful mod called [SaveEverything](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148), by the creator of [PerkLoadoutManager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) (the latter which was JUST updated to allow local saving of loadouts again!)
---
(2) Make sure to select the Holo tab before going on adventures... that way if you fat finger the R key doing anything PipBoy based (like changing perk loadouts...) you won't drop something unbeknownst to you.
---
I say this as someone who's thankfully only lost trivial things (black cowboy hat, bottlecap sunglasses, a sweet handmade I... made) but who's deathly afraid of losing the handful of 2-3\* legendaries I use.
---
Outer Worlds will be much better game than 76 for sure, but what you’re doing is not right. Let them enjoy their Fallout 76.
---
Hahaha. I swear there was a post here yesterday of someone going “why did they nuke Wally’s Water Park.” And I thought of you when I read it 😂
---
Does that go for the Gatling laser as well? It seems like my ultracite GL eats enemy's quicker than point blank with my TS GL.
---
😂a real veteran of the game I take it . Thanks .
---
Any good?  I just got one
---
Was your friend able to replace his gun?
---
Do you mean from random plan locations?
---
Link or other citation?
---
Exactly... Lol
---
lol it was probably a really windy day. Yes sometimes it takes 7-8 tries before the bots actually show caps correctly. Funny thing is if you know they should have the caps but is showing zero, just go ahead and sell your unwanted stuff to them, suddenly they will show the correct amount minus the caps they just paid you.
---
Thank you so much! I did get it! 
---
That was very kind of you to go out of your way to alert me.
---
They could even connect them all. Like the metro in DC FO3
---
I run a shop and what the first post here says is spot on. Granted people are always looking for weird things.  Items like junkie hunter zealots trouble shooters those are generally not very desired ( I call them junk stars) but just because something is one of those things does not mean it’s worthless. For instance I just landed a troubleshooters explosive .50 cal the other day.  Remover to look at the other legendary effects too. Melee with swing speed or power attack is usually always going to be worth a few, rifles with vats Crit or vats % are always good too.  Armor is the same with the junk stars, always fully inspect though. You may land a troubleshooters with reduced weapon weight ( speaking of ,ANYTHING With weight reduction is worth keeping) armor is interesting because it can land you things out of your price range easily through trades. If you end up with a sentinel piece with weapon weight reduction you can pretty much choose anything you want.  Again I am piggy backing off the first post.  I hope it helps.
---
Yeah, the shelf in the abandoned vendor area by the ski lift and the building in the northwest corner of Grafton steel.
---
I hope it's fixed
---
Whenever I hear a female player on mic I drop whatever ammo I don't need say good job keep doing you girl and carry on. Made a few friends doing this.
---
Honestly it's the fact that they put up challenges that are literally impossible to do. It's not being entitled to ask for something they literally locked us out of getting but left the rewards up for us to see. It's not asking for lost time back, it's saying "Hey this is broken, and you've been letting us earn these since launch, if you can't fix it, can we at least be reimbursed."
---
If you think that's entitled youd probably never used a warrenty to return or get anything fixed that stopped working within that time period.
---
800 was fine until I started in survival. I leave almost all my aid in storage and closing in on 800. Before I had a lot of buffer. Problem with junk is I get rid of a lot to make space , then ohh damn I need more "xx".
---
I stream it just fine while my playstation at work, I sometimes play using the vita while I work. I’m also content without mods. The only thing I like more about the pc version is the frame rate, it crashes 3x more on pc though even though everything I have running it exceeds the required specs by miles. I really only get on to abuse my floating base that has the foundation glitch or play with my brother.
---
Workshops! Taking a workshop guarantees a plan, and the first defense is like two minutes later and guarantees another plan. So within 5 mins you have two plans, like 10 stims, and +400 xp. I levelled my last character from 6-13 on just workshops, because I love building plans.
---
Youre not stupid, bethesdas stupid, they released the challenges before the camera.
---
The game needs a phone app really so no matter where you are, what your doing or what platform you play on you can access the atom store and download the limited time things and get notifications of new free items/special events etc. Lots of folk will be away/visiting family etc and won’t be able to log in.
---
ThE bAlL iS iN yOuR cOuRt REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Instagating and Sentinel's are good
---
They're great if youre specced for it, but otherwise they aren't worth the weight ever. Same with mini nukes, which is sad.
---
McDonald's pizza? As a New Yorker that hurts my soul
---
I have 3.
---
Yup, all would be interesting, I think it might be over kill though as the current bleed out strategy works really well. I’m sure it isn’t supposed to happen that way and think they will probably patch it.  I love the mechanic idea even if people can’t seem to grasp it sometimes lol. I hope they do more of it in the future.  Imagine a SBQ with a mechanic involved.... madness pure madness.
---
I'm always dropping known plans, aid, and ammo for low level players. Paying it forward
---
Can we have an "off line" vault. Some weapons or apparel I save, but almost never use. They don't need to be on the world I'm on. Charge atoms to access .
---
Sounds like a cool idea, you could place a hatch on the ground that goes into the bunker. I like it.
---
Thank you so much for the offer! Luckily there is a blast zone on our server so my hubby was able to make a new one.
---
There's no way to "mess up" a build. It might take longer to optimize, but it's good to explore and feel out your playstyle. And after lvl50 you can respec your character, albeit slowly.
---
I don't play a melee character, so if Bethesda could go ahead and remove Melee weapons out of the legendary drops that would be great. /s
---
Full shrouded wood armor allows you to move as fast as if you where standing up. Some of us sneak every where to get that sweet sweet 2.5/3.5x bonuses.
---
I imagine that's the intention, but as far as I can tell from the ESM, it only fires one projectile and counts as a pistol rather than a shotgun.
---
It’s fixed
---
Only thing I don't like is that by the time I get there everyone clears out shit before I get a chance to even land a hit.
---
A Power armor build using Emergency Protocols torso can actually be really tanky. I just put together a tank perk loadout for my bloody HW build, about 64hp at 20% but I held sheepsquatch Aggro for a lot of the fight last night and only died once. Dodgy, blocker, Serendipity, Emergency Protocols... I had +3 endurance from food and +30 max hp from Lifegiver, which basically gave me an extra 9hp. But I also have a group mate with Empath, so that helps.
---
I really don't think they would just as a blanket give us atoms - as some players don't even do the dailies etc. However it might be good if they increased the amount of atoms we get from the "corrected" dailies once that is updated perhaps?
---
I do agree that it is a mess that they pushed back the cameras but forgot the dailies/weeklies. I've never bought atoms so they're really my only way of obtaining atoms so I'm with you that they should acknowledge it but I just don't think they're gonna give us all atoms you know?
---
Seriously, they want their players to spend 7600 hours in the game yet they don’t let your stash and caps limit grow with you. It’s like have an adult living in his childhood room for the whole life with monthly spending limit of a few hundred bucks.
---
Also, when it comes to melee gear, good melee weapons with the +40% Swing Speed are often sought after.
---
I have 4...
---
Most people are incredibly nice in this game, it's just that the jerks are so much louder. It's easy to forget the 3 people that gift you stims and armor, and hard to forget the one idiot who levels your camp.
---
Oh no that I remember!
---
With mods, if you were out of a material, say steel, but the mod would have steel in it - it would automatically scrap when you went to build something that needed steel.
---
Scrap all is/was always limited to ONLY what shows up on the "Scrap/Junk" section, but when building things, mods could be deleted if you didn't watch your stock of materials.
---
*drops challenge next week*
---
Sweet!   Shouldn’t have had to but still sweet
---
Well heres hoping anyway, they have mentioned plans to reiterate the survival mode, but i think they should consider offering multiple variants along side one another similar to what fortnite does with its rotating modes to see how the community responds.
---
You sound so gay dude. I’ll just code my way OH i mean script my way out of this conversation.
---
I can help you out with quests and stuff if you'd like. I'm usually on after 7 CST.
---
I don't have a handmade with perks n stuff so that's probably why, and my class setup isn't perfect yet
---
As in permadeath?
---
Who cares. You do you and have fun with it
---
You have to hit the Search button with Can Do equipped
---
Someone else posted their testing, they were reporting I think around 36% damage boost with 5-6 addictions. But there’s a few significant issues- apparently addictions vanish when you die, and also apparently sometimes vanish on their own, so upkeep to stay at max addictions can be difficult/costly. The other problem is that while you can have 5-6 addictions at a time, you can’t have that many chems active at once, so you’ll basically be running permanent special debuffs. Minor, but still.
---
I found this out accidentally on my second character.  As an FYI to the readers, you pick the perk point you want, then shift over to the other special stat for the card you want.
---
PSA: Sentinel and Cavalier are not major modifiers and the name of the armor will not say sentinel or cavalier.
---
Oooo... Now cranberries give an exp boost as food and drink we can currently make. It'd be cola if a Nuka Cranberry gave an exp buff that could be jacked up with Cola Nut.
---
Yeah I can help out. I’ll get on and add you in a few minutes.
---
Man that would be cool if you could place the hatch in the bottom floor of your normal camp - so you can have like a business in the front, sneaky bunker in the back!
---
Eh, why would an old broadcast be playing?  Might be difficult to get a full motion video with that too.  They could instead just have the snow screen change to a image with a flashing alert that there's been an atomic launch and to seek cover.  Something more simplistic like that likely would be more manageable.
---
Yeah cell won't reset under certain conditions.
---
Buy a second account, use a friend (lol) or ultimately spam friend requests to everyone on the world until you get someone to accept. Rejoin the world and you should get all the spawns back.
---
Notice that this might won't work if people are inside the cells since they tend to persist.
---
Currently, there are 3 out. The fourth will come to the Atomic Shop at 8pm EDT. You'll have to completely close your game and reopen it for the shop to refresh, but each new Egg arrives at 8.
---
Sounds fun. Couple questions. Fight time? Registration fee? Armor or bare-knuckle/ass?
---
I'd rather they make junk weightless and keep it at 800 but Bethesda doesn't seem to want to do that so 1000 is a nice round number and even then it'd be less for most people than having junk be weightless.
---

---
Not useless at all. The fact you don't have to carry so much food to get a full hunger bar is great. Instead of 7 pieces or molerats it's like 3.
---
If I told you, I would have to send a sheep-squatch imposter to visit you.
---
No.  Floating CAMPs are easy to replace because they are built around a single foundation piece.  As long as that piece is on valid terrain, the rest of the structure can be placed too.  The more foundation pieces you have, the more likely you'll have problems trying to replace your CAMP.
---
Supposedly, this change will make it so that no matter how many foundation pieces you have, only the first one is considered when checking validity.
---
Only PSN?
---
If they holster their weapon, you cant vats them.
---
Correct, this will be addressed in Tuesday's patch.
---
This past week the game is totally in the crapper - server lag is astronomical!

---
awesome THANKS :D
---
Oh boy! Time to get SCREWD!
---
Honestly though this makes me whet.
---
Instigating is great for a slow, heavy hitting weapon. Examples are super sledge for melee or the dragon for ranged.
---
/u/Ladydevann any way you can get this to the devs? Thanks!
---
A stat stick that gives garbage items I see it gives. I don't bother doing it anymore.
---
Can we have normal in-game mods work first?
---
&gt; For adventure mode
---
Yes good points, and adventure mode (PVE) was definitely what I had in mind. 
---
I agree there would be quite a few ways to exploit that for PvP, unless they introduced a penalty for retreating from combat by doing so.
---
It's not the more. It's everywhere. Dailys won't activate on same characters in some regions. It's bugged. For instance, Ecological balance always comes up on my main when I enter the region. On my alternate it never does. but on my alternate, I always get mire daylies. All three of my characters seem to get the camden daily though.
---
Ditto this. Join a facebook group for trading. You will quickly get a feel for the price of items.
---
Workshops are not it a good state, they were better when you had to contest at the actual workshop bench. Did not enjoy trying to find the chemeliond ass hat that was hidden on the outer edge of the workshop.
---
Notice that these areas at times won't respawn enemies if people are inside of them, as cells can persist. Some people don't understand this and will hug the area.
---
r/meirl. They say that the home is the expression of the heart and soul.
---
Believe it or not....
---
It means that you can crouch and move without capslock on and you'll not be having your sneak lower than you'd have when crouching and not moving
---
Yes. I enjoy having to strategize and plan rather than smash and dash. You can plan getting equipment or aid or whatever to defeat the boss
---
Do you have a set time you gonna dot it?
---
Thanks, it took me forever to see that but I did finally open my eyes.
---
I thought I was going crazy. Couldn't find anything about a camera despite these challenges being in the game now.
---
Are you sure there's no griefing? Are you sure? A group of folks fast travel to you and one initiates a claim and they all unload on you? That's pretty greifey to me. If it was in the area of the workshop fair game but on the other side of the map?
---
ohh yeah its one of the best ways to get people without them knowing you are there - shooting scorch beast and yoa guis and boom boosted attack and such can give people a shock
---
Thanks for the detailed info! Leveling up 3x in one day separately can definitely be a chore if you don’t have the time or patience to grind it out, especially if it’s only paying 10 atoms. 
---
At this point I’m trying to level up a lot because I’m trying to change my build, but I do try to maximize the 3 in 1 for the sake of the challenge.
---
The thing with Fallout 76 is that, if you're good at it, you wind up with SO MUCH extra crap lying around. My primary mule is sitting on 3-5K of almost every type of scrap (besides acid), 20K+ of most ammo types, and I have hundreds of 3 star legendaries muled for when Purveyor comes out. There's really nothing to do end game besides hoard stuff, and this game has gotten such a bad rap from reviewers and some youtubers, that I try to make the game as good as I can for people, especially new players that I see. 
---
Another thing - most people don't mule stuff like I do, so they literally just have to get rid of excess. The game gives you so much, and you won't have the space in your stash.
---
UFO? do you mean the space station or is there an actual crashed UFO in the game.
---
As to why, it was one of the last known broadcasts. Hell, our music is barely touching the 60’s, so suffice to say 25 years after nuclear apocalypse, there wouldn’t be many, if any, new broadcasts.
---
I could dig the simpler cutaway. If only to hear the alarm belt out form the TV.
---
Probably fairly soon, might run the silo in the next 10 minutes. I have a few Keycards so I might run a couple more throughout the day.
---
No, but you can repair it. You probably got the plans and just didn't realize.
---
I agree that there should be some changes to bring workshops more in-line with adventure.  At very least maybe a warning “workshop is being challenged you have 30 seconds to prepare” because just like you said in adventure the workshops are supposed to be about gaining resources and working together, and that does make you an easy target.   Myself I took the   poseidon power plant and started collecting fusion cores, since it was a level 1 area I was outside my power armor just roaming around. 2 guys roll up doing squad maneuvers, I see them and wave, one starts the taking of the workshop the other one-shots me as I wave to them.  
---
Why couldn’t I have been given a moment to get ready? You do for everything else in the workshop, if I had been able to get in my armor and pull a gun, at very least it would have been more entertaining for them to kill me!   That isn’t what you are all jonsening for is it, easy kills on people not expecting it, cause that’s sad as fuck.  
---
Personally I’d like adventure mode workshops to give options to team up or relinquish the workshop to challengers.  
---
Also in general workshop defense activities should include a legendary in the last defense, give people a reason to do it and not just wait for the retake event.
---
Depends. I did some work back during the first release of the unreal engine- before ‘Tournament’ was a thing- and because you generally would need to inject libraries to add functionality you were coding. Script engines are meant to make coding easier. You generally write a script engine in code- though I’m aware there are a few oddly ‘inception’ script languages within script languages.
---
From looking at the Unreal Engine 4 information, I’d say it could be a mix of both. UE3 was predominantly scripting, but from what I’m reading they’ve hybridized the two in UE4. I guess it comes down to if you’re actually being forced to use something like C# externally then plugging it in, or if you’re entirely using UE4’s engine as the code base. The latter becomes scripting. 
---
Code tells the OS or hardware what to do generally, and is usually compiled into machine code. Scripts pass through a program that turns your basic instructions into code, then either functions AS the executable following your script, or converts your script into code then compiles it.
---
Scripts typically require a seperate executable or framework to run. Code is typically compiled into an independent executable that doesn’t require something else... of course, because everyone in the last 10-15 years started using things like DirectX for library injection, the lines have been blurred quite a bit.
---
It gets more complicated the further in you go. If I was being fair, I’d say you’re doing a little of both.
---
I guess i should be more specific remove the abundance of this one star drop from three star legendary spawns.
---
Are you referring to the escape artist perk? It specifically says running no longer effects stealth, not crouch walking.
---
This baffles me!! How do i export the pictures anyway? I want to take more.
---
I also noticed an increase in the amount of hardened and glowing mass that drops in nuke zones lately. It used to be so hard for me to find and now like you said the corpses will have 2-4 on them at a time. It’s a nice change for sure.
---
Registration fee, 250 caps. Cheap...make it fair to everyone. Price of admission to watch, 50 caps. (gonna have seating and send server-wide blasts) uh....bare-ass, but clothed. I'm setting up rooms with locked doors as a fighters "lockeroom" type thing. Stash box will be there, if stash box full then drop gear in paper bag. Door locks behind you, so no one else can get in there.  
---
Empty inventory checks before the fight, all the rules posted at the arena. Prize 25,000 caps. Gonna make a big spectacle out of it. I am tired of waiting for Bethesda to create content for me so I'm just gonna create it myself.
---
Hey All. I've had mostly great experiences. I'm on ps4, playing in Ireland. I'm currently level 32 and someone gave me a vampire walking stick last night. Lovely weapon. This dude invited me to join team from a good distance away and just drops loads of great weapons. Was well chuffed. A gang destroyed my camp a couple of weeks ago but apart from that, all good. I always help anyone I meet, whatever their level. Love the game BTW.
---
it would be good to have a massive community event that lasts for more than a few minutes, the parade was fun event to do.
---
Yeah
---
Anything would help at this point. All I see is the lack of consideration for cause-and-effect when it comes to broken content. What was the last time we got a public apology and a considerable solution to our problems that the latest patches keep introducing?
---
I love the game but the way it's handled by the company is outrageous really and most issues are simply overlooked. The steady stream of updates keep pumping out Atomic Shop content updates and broken gameplay elements, that's why they can't just pull a lever and roll back to a more stable release, e.g. Patch 6, as that would be bad for their cash-cow
---
There are two modes of crouch walking. Crouch walking and crouch running. You have 5 total movement modes, 3 uncrouched: sprint, running, walking, 2 crouched: running and walking. I refer the Escape artist perk and what exactly falls under definition of running here.
---
Honestly it would be nice to be able to create our own Nuka Colas (and get the mixer back). The trade-off could be the requirement of some rather unconventional ingredients or ingredients in a large enough quantity to offset any monetary cap gain, similar to how the Nuka Cola Dark recipe is.
---
I've always said 2000 lbs.
---
I don't have a PC that runs Fallout, or a copy of the game for Xbox. I wish I did...I'd hold 3 events a month, one on each platform. It would be hella fun. Might recruit others from those platforms to try and do it.
---
How many guns did you buy on ebay?
---
Xbox?
---
*actually looks it up* Oh, yeah. Crashed space station. IIRC, that spot is just to E/NE on the other side of the water from Graninger Farm.
---
I want this too.  Unfortunately I have a feeling that if this does become a thing it will be drip fed to us via the ATOM shop and we will have to pay for all the cool things that were already part of FO4 and are already in the game files somewhere I'm sure.
---
Shit yeah, my bad thought I put it in title. I’m on Xbox
---
We need a bar set!
---
Well, I need a bar set.
---
That I agree with. I'd also love them to fix wood drops so they also drop 2* and 3*.
---
6 str from whiskey with party perk is nice.
---
yeah the queen drops stable flux and it wouldn't unbalance the game, plans are needed though
---
I can't tell you how much plastic I have absolutely wasted with this. Its probably in the thousands by now.
---
And youve closed and restarted? Try going directly to the atomic shop via the news menu. Otherwise I don't know. I've had no issues myself :(
---
 Someone call the whaaaambulance. They owe you nothing.
---
More like confused. Do you have some issue with people who are homosexual? 
---
I wasn’t aware sexuality was even involved with the subject.
---
Haha nice. Great spot
---
I had the raddest TV mod for Fallout 4. Looney Tunes and Mr Bean to ride out the rad storms!
---
Got it last time it was in store, nice skin... Just wish I could get an explosive. 44
---
Answered your other comment :(
---
Glad you met some of the nice players who make up this community. I normally hang out by my shack near George's Junkyard (on the xbox). Often end up handing out purified water, stimpacks, some canned goods, and even a couple starberry cobblers to guests.
---
Oscar?
---
200 years later, no less.
---
You sound like a calm rational individual.
---
Oh here we go. Crying victim.
---
Armor pen probably doesn't do anything beyond damage \~= 6x DR. Difficult to prove in practice.
---
Good point!
---
LOL! You read my mind sir, I was going to post about this today because it is very time consuming to scrap items 1 by 1 and bulked items should NEVER be scrapped unless done manually and NEVER when "Scrap All Junk" is selected. If Bethesda can't do this for some strange reason.....MAKE SURE I AT LEAST GET MY PLASTIC BACK FROM THE BULKED MATERIALS TOO!!
---
I'm Lv. 167 or so.  400+ hours.
---
I've found 3 of these pieces naturally.  Two Sentinel, one Cavalier.  One ended up being Nocturnal and the other Vanguard.
---
The fact is, as you say, Unyielding Sentinel/Unyielding Cavalier is supposed to be extremely rare.  Dupers ruined it.
---
The last one I saw was in BETA.
---
I legit thought they were removed from the game.
---
Price range for two shot lever?
---
I picture them sitting in a meeting room.
---
"OK. Nobody is buying atoms. They are using daily challenges to get what they want. We need to brainstorm impossible challenges, so frustrating and enraging that nobody even tries daily challenges anymore."
---
One way they could sort out the stash limit is by removing weight of junk (either just in the stash or for everyone) and then in the stash limit them to stacks so you can only hold up to 250 of each in a stack and a stash has a limited amount of stack spaces. 
---
They could give you like at least the same amount of resources as stack space + a bit more for any extra stacks of stuff u need. 
---
They should also give the option the scrap all junk in a stash so you don’t have to sort through a bunch of junk to find the heavy things.
---
I assure you kind sir, I'm a tad loony but apart from that stickle I'm completely 90% sane. Good day to you sir.
---
Since most heavy guns are fairly high level, I'd focus on melee or shotguns at first, that way once you can get a good Heavy, you still have a good backup. And it allows you to constantly make ammo and stash it for later.
---
The blunderbuss is supposed to be a shotgun spread, but in FO76 it is not and retains the cone barrel. So basically it is a blackpowder pistol with no range and no accuracy that reloads very slightly slower with more damage. It cannot be legendary. It sucks as a weapon and needs replaced with a full size blunderbuss to actually be effective.
---
actually, they kinda have that already but its with a key pad and there is a count down timer but I never played with it before.
---
[Gary!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gary_(clone))
---
To all the PvPers who are taking this post as a "Whaaaaa pvp is unfair, someone is in my safe space in adventure mode", you are missing the point.
---
OP, I agree with you that time to kill in pvp is far too low. By that I mean that people one shotting, or killing you before you can react, is currently a thing and it's a problem. It's especially bad in Adventure because the survival mode modifiers on damage aren't present. I shouldn't die instantly in full power armor while running dodgy, med-x, and having an empath teammate, but I do.
---
So yes, pvp damage modifiers should be tweaked, and the ability to stack so many different consumables to do such insane damage should be nerfed. It's not fun to die instantly. 
---
It would also be nice if you had a grace period ... like a countdown timer, between when someone contests the workshop and pvp is initiated. 3-5 seconds would be fine. That would give you a heads up that you're about to be attacked and give you time to pull your thumbs out of your ass.
---
That's the spirit!
---
I have come back to adventure to pvp because survival isn’t worth it anymore, kill a 100 and get 25 caps? Cool, waste of ammo. 
---
Plus no one carries junk in survival and everyone runs at you with bankrupt characters.
---
I'm down
---
okey thanks i will check it out
---
I found that re-picking up notes and holo tapes triggered spawns for me, give it a try. But yeah no point going in till the place is empty, just wait it out. Same with whitesprings.
---
Sucks really, before fo76 was released a review rated it a good game apart from you would get more loot and better prices while playing it solo!
---
I'm down. Of course that depends on the fight time (career to maintain and whatnot). 
---
Lol I like the inventory check idea better than the bare-assed one. And I only ask because I did something like this but you had to be in your skivvies.
---
Also, dont know how build space is for you but in addition to the arena maybe set up a vendor area and charge them for the space
---
Maybe try horde events in mire  forest and ash heap, and when you get to enclave part those events are pretty cool.
---
And of course the main quest which gives a goof amount of xp and unique legendary weapons
---
Should we rate their product garbage and move on, or give them some costumer feedback and actually help them improve? Which one is more feasible in your opinion?
---
I somehow got plans for Sheiled lined Vault76 jumpsuit at like level 20 or something, lol. It's probably worth my time to go hunt down flux, even I am barely 50 now.
---
Keep in mind, this trick is more likely to work if your CAMP has a minimal number of foundation pieces.  The more foundations you have, the less likely it can be cleanly replaced (although you could always scrap your blueprint and rebuild it manually, again just for the Cap cost of moving it an inch to the left.
---
Your experiences aren't universal.
---
I just want to be able to "shift" my camp borders a few feet to either side without having to pay to place a new CAMP and have to rebuild everything, especially when the area I wanted WAS inside green borders before dropping.
---
Sorry i already sold it.
---
I don't have time to look up the post, but they said they would look into adding it as an option in the future.
---
Wuuuut? Are you sure? Because it's only been three days now since this atom egg collecting thing started and the 4th one comes in a couple hours. I guess if you have a pic of all 4 in your camp then I'd be thinking, but I'm pretty sure only 3 have come out.
---
I have level 20 robot left arm 2s it has unyielding and plus 1 Agility. I will sell for 1K
---
Indeed, that and making some of the armor less heavy would also solve this situation.
---
Every time I meet someone.... Is that you Gary?
---
 It’s almost like the more you guys complain the sillier they get.
---
I wouldn’t be at all surprised if some mild trolling was going on on the Bethesda side of things.
---
*And* what is a modder??
---
Cool, we're running the silo now but you're welcome to join when we hit the nuke.
---
I like the idea...like cloud storage.
---
I would prefer an additional 200 pound stash that’s shared between players so I can freely mule items around.
---
you would have gotten a 1 star piece of armor either way. you wont get wood armor unless its rolling a 1 star item
---
Aww. You'll find a couple, sooner or later. I didn't even know they were that rare. :)
---
How do you walk around all day and not step on your massive dong? Do they make special pants for that?
---
This is that website. :) I used it to create my build when I got started out; it's invaluable.
---
I mean, that would be a bit too much imo, 1000 should be around perfect with a bit of junk management.
---
If you need folk to play with, the Enclave is recruiting for efforts to rebuild America. https://discord.gg/SUqWXMb
---
Ahh okay, my CAMP consists of three separate buildings with a lot of foundations, and I mean a lot. Ah well still that's also good to keep in mind if I ever do decided to move CAMPS or do the replace-camp-in-same-place trick thing, Cheers!
---
They must be in your world if you want to have access to them in the first place sadly.
---
All they have to do is log out and rejoin on a friend :0
---
I want to watch that battle
---
I’ll add u soon
---
The respawn rate in there is abysmal. It takes 10 minutes to run solo while taking your time. there is a lot of wait before anything respawns. And that is if you can be there alone. Triple the misery for every additional player present.
---
I mean, with some of the materials you use less often I suppose that could be done, but with things like lead and black titanium the more you have, the better.
---
I would not recommend going with unyielding for a high Heath build. The extra defense of Vanguards will help keep your Heath high during combat.
---
Sounds like something from Old World Blues... A toaster that when touched leads you to another dimension :/
---
The mire has max level mobs. It just doesn't have as many say, scorch beasts. I face level 68 super mutants all  the time up there, and it's honestly more of a challenge than watoga.
---
That would take you to heaven for seven minutes only.
---
Thanks man!!! I get off work around 230pm pacific time. Get home around 330pm. If that time estimate works for you, let me know? I’ll definitely give you something for your trouble.
---
no...
---
Why would you need to follow people around to obtain those materials?
---
I'm kind of lost, they are farming for xp? Just to get to lvl 50?
---
It still works on the .308
---
tey fixed the fact that you gould get the meat, fluid, and mass off corpses you did not kill. That was my main source, harvesting the flux and cleaning up the corpses from the people making kills. Now I never have enough.
---
Are you referring the the whirling humming sound the ps4 makes which can get louder or quite depending on what you're doing?
---
It doesn't always have max level mobs.  They are leveled based on who was there last.  I've walked into quite a few lower level mobs after a level 30 or 40 player has been through there.
---
I think they should shoot for an infinite amount of storage.
---
Let me store whatever I want damn it.
---
well if it was on the ground in there i seriously doubt it was a death bag someone probably just dropped it
---
I've also crashed a good few times running it as well. Fixer plans would be nice, though a buddy of mine crafted me one already.
---
Wow, well i'm convinced.
---
Sure, hope you get a fun pet :)
---
Nice! Yeah I went to inside the prison armor workbench immediately to your right. In between the workbench and wall.
---
Thanks for the help everyone. After a week of farming I gave up and found someone selling it for 2k lol. I did find it in the watoga train station vendor thought - just the mod, not the plans.
---
stable flux is my primary water source.
---
That’s ridiculously inane.
---
Mett Demunn
---
Yeah...And I run into level 14's in watoga _all the time_. So I'm not sure I get your point.
---
In Adventure to clarify.
---
I seriously doubt this game will ever see a competent form of instancing
---
Second point, exactly what happened
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
They can't take pvp away from workshops. Then a group could be even more "griefy" and take all the workshops and just sit on them so no one else can use them. While I believe the workshops should still have the aggressor have to activate the workshop, it would be super counterproductive to not have them be contestable. This is as close to an even playing field as it gets for workshops.
---
Scrap junk b4 stashing
---
I don’t need to. I just think if I am in the area why not help
---
I’ve had the people I play with tell me there are cats near them so I FT there and they’re gone 😞  I’ll keep looking...I’m determined to have one for my camp 😺
---
So, you took a workshop, then while still PvP enabled, you went to farm valuable PvP drop materials.
---
And you wonder why you ere killed. Someone saw you owned the shop, looked at map and saw you farming, and saved themselves a lot of flux farming effort. This is a self inflicted wound.
---
Thank you so much!
---
The main complaint was that BGS advertised this as being challenging for 2 level 50+ characters and it isn't challenging at all.
---
Three. Take it or leave it.
---
Well thank you, I will definitely keep that in mind!
---
How about fixing the mods issue too Bethesda?
---
Ooh! It would be great to have them as camp decoration. But yeah, good luck in finding them. :)
---
I love me some flux. I craft shielded marine wetsuits. The crafting ingedients from the meat piles has dried up lately. Need an event like **scorched earth** to be in whitspring and above/below burrows for all of the players to whack the mobs.
---
I hate PvP but I want the atoms.  I check the map to make sure the workshop is empty, scout around it for a bit to make sure nobody is lurking, then claim the workshop and immediately hop servers once I get credit for the challenge.  It is really not a problem.
---
I try to promote exactly this kind of play.
---
Yeah I’m on now and should be for a few hours at least
---
Last night, I helped some character (15+ levels lower than me) clear out the Posiedon energy plant, and finished up in the workroom. Whilst the other character was working on some gun-type stuff, I went back to get stuff that had been dropped, as well as nailing a few scorched that we'd missed. Upon returning, I dumped all the stuff I'd collected for the other player, along with a good number of rad-x/radaway things too.
---
As I was in power armour, the other player dumped a couple of power cores. Hopefully they understood me trying to say "No thanks" by shaking my chars head/body/whatever... I've already got about 16 in my stash.
---
There's a lot of decent players out there. It's just a pity you'll also come across the odd few who are general arseholes. Such is life though, I suppose. :)
---
this happend to me too! i lost my shielded Enklave underarmour and a  friend lost 1 piece of his power armour and a VTU-jacket. nothing was re-named! first i thought i selled it or something like this ,but after hearing his story i am no longer sure. I mean i would recognise if i sell something important like my underarmour!
---
I store less than 200 of each junk and only the aid that I really use or need for crafting and &lt;20 mods that I’m holding on to until I get a suitable legendary to put them on, plus the 4 suits of power armor that I swap around with 1 in my inventory, one of each shielded underarmor and the limited drop apparel such as Fasnacht masks that I don’t want to part with. I probably carry too many weapons, mainly because I just can’t store them on top of the things that I actually use, plan to use, or store based upon their rarity. Otherwise, I’d be stocking up all the useless legendaries to trade in to the legendary vendor instead of selling for 4-30 caps.
---
Melee makes sense as you will be naturally wanting high STR for the related heavy perk cards. You can also try and mod a critical hit receiver on pistols for a nice bit of cheap burst damage.
---
I am casually playing.
---
I always like to give start packs to people just leaving the vault. Try to compensate for the griefers out there. Last night I was coaching a new player and after he got to level 5, someone griefed him (and me also). He seemed to be going around wrecking people's camps for fun. If that person happens to read this, please take up smoking and drinking and don't wear your seatbelt.
---
Please. I like to collect items.
---
Well, there's the Martial Artist perk, which not only reduces melee weapon weight, but grants a bonus to swing speed too.
---
An argument can also be made that if you have a Bloodied Super Sledge, you don't really *need* anything else.  Keep in mind, 388 is on the low end.  With Slugger, Twisted Muscles, Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, and Bloody Mess, it is *considerably* higher.
---
I wonder if they increased the quantity since you have to tag the kill in order to get them.
---
Armor workbench inside the prison once you enter the one immediately to your right entering the cells.
---
They have never said that, again you are twisting their words or misunderstanding what they are saying.
---
I can’t say for sure on the ultracite GL I’ve never used one I’ve never found one haha , I only use my executioners Gatling laser
---
Looks like Sir Galahad was AFK, so you lucked out this time. LOL
---
im on ps4 and doing the same
---
Oof
---
We have a mix of casual, hardcore, and role players across all three platforms. You determine your level of involvement. 
---
If nothing else, it’s a link to other players!
---
I would prefer any other type of content.. this "dungeon" sucks
---
Ive got a 2 shot double barrel thats 2.2 pounds. Only reason i ever put it away is because im out of shells.
---
Think it does 115 without any perks for shotgunning. 
---
Legendary weight reductions and perk cards are op when stacked.
---
I'm pretty sure the Kill Laugh Love is in the Atomic Shop. 700 I think.
---
That's not a bad idea....I'm sure I would be able to provide a "vendor" space in the build. The actual arena doesn't take up that much build space. I'm trying to work out how I would be able to effectively give people "entrance music" without it being loud and screechy over everyone's headsets.
---
So you think all Vanguard would be better than just having even one piece of unyielding?
---
For a long while I thought that was by design since I didn’t get mass from the ones I killed. So I thought their idea was either you kill them for loot, or you let others kill them but you’re rewarded mass. Good thing is sometimes you can get more than one mass out of one kill. It’s probably their way of balancing it.
---
Do you enjoy sharing random pointless links for no reason?
---
If you haven't done them yet, there are also 4 notes on the billboard at the taxidermy place.
---
How would you know how old he is unless he tells you?
---
They said on Tuesday.

[mod issue addressed ](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1119326518902251520)
---
My hubby was just complaining about this. Can't mod power armor. On ps4.
---
When you hit level 350 you’ll feel like mass ghoul murderer lol
---
Right. The other short-lived option was to prevent crafting and fixing from auto-de-bulking for needed ingredients, which was also unpopular.
---
Both times I went through the burrows I got less than 3 legendarys.  I can get the same from any other dungeon, much less nonnuked whitesprings.  Haven't seen the burrows nuked but I can't imagine it's that much more impressive than whitesprings.
---
Gotta be more sneaky. I will admit destroying someone’s camp because they are flagged in PvP from a workshop is pretty cheesy, but that’s not what this post is about.
---
And give survival a try, people can fast travel to the top person and start unloading on them.
---
Are you wearing weightless armor?
---
Dude, the cap limit is there for a reason.  If they wanted you to have more cap capacity, you would.
---
You can swap things out as you like, and have different sets of cards at different levels for different builds as you go. As an example, I have all of my shotgun and 2h melee cards maxed out. And I also have level 1 versions of each, for when I want a nice boost in damage but don't want to swap out cards while running around killing standard mobs.
---
Did I say anything about that? You’re a douche because you’re a douche, not because you quote popular tv shows. Quoting GoT just makes you lame. It’s the doucheyness that makes you a douche.
---
Hopefully that clears things up for you.
---
That wasn't it.  I fought this guy for approximately 20 minutes and couldn't VATS him at all.  It must have been a bug or glitch.
---
Just like the stash box right
---
Cool.  Don’t change, expect everyone else to adapt to your wishes and give you what you want.  See how well that strategy works for you as you grow up.
---
By the sound of his voice?
---
Bear arms, bandolier, bloody mess, stabilised, I think there is a bullet shield plus the usual heavy weapons ones. The ammo and super duper are a must. The rest kind of depends on armour type and legendary preference really. 
---
This is based on my heavy weapons/pa perk load out.
---
Is there an existing junk-use spreadsheet?  Seems like if everyone knew cork (for made up example) only had 3 uses, and then saw they had 0 need for it. People could empty their stash of cork.
---
So far I don’t know why I have so many gears or screws, but I know that I may need them, but not sure for what.  Having that spelled out may go a long way to alleviating one’s stash concerns.
---
Yeah, when you make posts like this, always include your platform, markets differ greatly.
---
Scorch orgy?
---
Are you actually hitting the queen?
---
And you wonder why we wanted you and all your kind in their own little sandbox away from us.
---
I would never pvp wreck your dumpster shithouse camp. It's beautiful
---
It’s a mod for combat armor, not a new type of armor, so you have to make a regular piece of combat armor and mod it to BOS.
---
Ah. Thought he hadn't gotten on mic yet. Sorry.
---
You have one stored generator. It will travel with you as you go (store it before you move your camp, shit bugs out in this game \_every time\_ I move my camp I loose things).   
---
You will be able to place down that one stored generator, you will not be able to craft more, you will not be able to craft them at workshops, etc.
---
It’s a primary mod, and it could be for any piece regardless of what item you are scrapping. Craft an arm, leg, and chest and see which one you can mod to BoS.
---
I have a 3\* Combat Shotgun with the 90% weight reduction perk that somehow, inexplicably, weights 7 pounds.  I keep it around in the Stash because it's explosive (with the awkward Exterminators prefix), but I never figured out how I ended up breaking the weight.  Must have been a modification I did.
---
"Your wish is our command. Power armor now weighs 100 pounds!" -- Bethesda
---
Bullshit. At some point you cannot excuse behavior as kids being kids. As a kid I knew better than to call some one n\* or to be a sexist pig. It's called raising your kids right. Not just chalking off bad behavoir to kids being kids.
---
Or...hear me out, youd also need a cap as an ingredient!
---
That’s what I mean, it’s not showing up. I just have Shadowed and Reinforce.
---
We wont he able to destroy these camps after the new adventure mode patch
---
If I come across a low level I’ll give them some stims, water, plans, whatever I can help with. I know I had people help me out as well, and I remember how much I appreciated it, so I like to pay it forward 😁
---
The Ultracite Gatling has a higher base damage AND does more damage to Scorched-flavor enemies than the normal Gatling Laser.
---
It would seem that the trade off is that the UGL can NEVER be Legendary and uses separate Mods from the GL (i.e. the Prime Gatling Laser Receiver will not work on the Ultracite Gatling Laser. You need the Ultracite version.).
---
Literally has nothing to do with what this post is about...
---
Well that was a dramatic baby-like way to take that. If you see how my love for trading and wealth of caps is somehow triggering your fragile feelings then please... do tell🤣🤣🤣
---
How you know majority is in the US? Your argument doesn't have any more reasoning. You are playing just lottery with your arguments and not even understanding basics how legal court and lawyers work.
---
1. Bethesda isn't recording any player voices. This means you can't prove anything in court even if you record voices by yourself because there is no timestamp for your voice recording where to compare. Your evidence is worth of zero.
---
2. By mentioning feminist group as a last help you already failed all your reasoning. I think this discussion is finished if your arguments are on that level.
---
Are you sure it said limbs and not arms/legs specifically? 
---
Also check check piece, that can be BOS
---
For some strange reason the mods took down my post, removed for rule #2....I spoiled nothing for no one and was simply showing that it is possible to solo with the right gear. I will update the info and loadout/perk/mags/chem I used to achieve this after I get home from work tonight on the video itself or maybe try to repost it using a "Spoiler" tag since that's what the FO76 mods had an issue with. I will get back with everyone ASAP.
---
A fully loaded combat shotgun weight about 20 lbs. So does a minigun. The weapon weights make absolutely no sense.
---
I just spoke to someone in chat that lost 4 of his power armor pieces 😨. He crafted new ones but the game wont let him put mods on them.
---
My bad, I thought you meant like the LLL sign wasn't available yet and all that.
---
They should have thought this through when they decided to delay the camera.
---
People use black titanium?
---
Zealot's legendary weapons and Scorched Killer receivers both apply to all scorched creatures and scorchbeasts, which may be a surprise. Ref: Perk\\STAT\_DamageVsPerk and dependencies.
---
I'm not absolutely sure about the next part, but as far as I can tell, the scorchbeast queen is not a scorchbeast. Prime receivers do specifically apply to the SBQ though.
---
We've commented in a few other threads, but we are aware these are showing and are working to address it.
---
I’ll take a pole hook over a super sledge anyday, and it’s all because of that awful Whoosh! sound you have listen to every attack. And I agree the super sledges aren’t worth it because of the weight, it’s why I prefer just about anything else (40% swing speed mole miners gauntlet ftw)
---
Yea good luck with that audio thing
---
I'm definitely down and I have a group that might  enjoy this as well. 
---
I sent you a request and I'll direct my people to this thread

Why are you putting unscraped junk in your stash!?!?

My point was to look at it from the perspective of a player of a *lower* level player.  Drop yourself back to a level 30-40 player with normal weapons and armor and evaluate how hard it is then.  Your perspective will change when you aren't way stronger then what it was intended for.  I'm level 187 right now and when I ran the Burrows for the first time it was easy for me but I could easily see how hard it would be for someone new or for a much lower level character.    
---
From that perspective it's a good addition to the game and would be one nasty challenge for a player just discovering the area for the first time and hasn't completed the main quest.
---
I have lvl 50 unyielding metal armor with + 25  energy resistance. Left leg.
---
Actually that's with a bunch of those included as well, but that's not the point because all of those would still apply to using the pole hook which is STILL two and a half times more efficient to carry around.  
---
Without factoring in the armor puncture and ballistic/energy damage differences the pole hook in my example does just 4% less damage than the super sledge yet the super sledge weighs over 250% more.
---
What do they show right now?
---
It's just the helmet paint mod. The torso/arms/legs BoS mod cannot be unlocked by scrapping. Get a combat armor helmet and check it.
---
Look at the pic in my post. It just said “Crafting item unlocked: Brotherhood of steel” 
---
It appeared after scrapping an arm piece so I’m assuming it’s for the limbs. I also checked to see if it was for the Chest Piece and it’s not there either.
---
Bloodied builds can be terrifying, there are a few perks that help. Dodgy in agility is a great choice, maxed out  you take a lot less damage at the cost of AP.  As long as you have AP, you take less damage.   
---
Serendipity, maxed out, gives you a 45% chance to ignore all damage when bellow 30% health.   
---
Goat legs is also a good idea when exploring the world, because fall damage from fairly low heights can kill you dead when you're walking around at 15-20%.
---
? 3 what
---
You can't learn BOS limbs or chest from scrapping. You unlocked it for the helmet
---
+karma. If you cld inv me to the team
---
I saw one today but it was over in about 30 seconds. I was putting stuff in my stash and then ran out to try to enjoy the storm and it ended as I was leaving the station.
---
Honestly I wasnt even thinking about killing stuff for the atoms. I just wanted to finally get a pic of my character in a radstorm.
---
There's a pretty sweet spot slightly NE of the Watoga train station. Nice flat area just across the water
---
Same here and I'm on PC. My alt has Level 15 Raider PA and I cant add any of the mods that I've bought.
---
Lol no no Im talking about the items off to the left side if the screen that look like a locker with a terminal hooked up to it and a SALE sign
---
Checked all of them, there’s no option for the BOS variant :(
---
Super low chance of a spawn at the BOS fort in any of the spots plans spawn. I've gotten legs and chest there.
---
I'll go scope it out, thanks
---
Right! Some of my favorite screen shots I took from FO4 were in the rad storms!
---
I know you are aware.. but by this point the week is more than half done. Hell, I'm aware it may not be changeable by the time next tuesday comes around. Is there any way you can make up for the lost opportunities (though some of them are pretty ridiculous and not doable even if we had the camera... rad storms are practically non existant so already one of today's would be only theoretically possible really even if the camera existed)? Maybe add more challenges next week or even just be super generous and give out the atoms we could have gotten if the challenges were set right?
---
I have mimosa, 500c
---
Pumpkin Grenades are in the same vein without having to wait out the initial superbuffed period.
---
You linked a hateful video showing why you were mad and told someone to watch it. Someone linked a rebuttal video that wasn't hateful but you refused to watch it to see the other side of the story.
---
 You were spreading unnecessary hate and too busy being mad about what some random Internet stranger told you to be mad about instead of checking into it yourself. You didn't check into anything beside those same hateful videos according to you. Even tho you don't want to see it that way, it's what you did.
---
Its actually quite pointed.  The discussion at hand was that the OP was complaining that since he purchased a piece of software, and now he cannot play that software because of his own actions, that he is entitled to a refund because as he put it "No product?  Then return our money."  The product he purchased was not altered in any way, his account that was required to play was.  No amount of SHIFTING THE GOAL POST (see the link I put) to talk about supposed innocent people who did not cheat who got banned as some sort of mitigating factor.  Even if those people were not full of shit, which I for one think they are, the OP is not making that claim (and even if he did, I'd think he was full of shit too.)
---
It may be for a specific type of combat armor. I had previously unlocked BoS paint, and when scrapping a heavy arm I unlocked BoS paint arms. So maybe you only unlocked for heavy?
---
I just want to place down thousands of Mr. Fuzzy plushies all over the build area
---
Done! I will buy :)
---
Any rewards for collecting all of them?
---
I thought the creation club had underground assets, would love a fallout bunker.
---
You say that like it's crazy that a piece of armor that only covers the chest would weigh 50% more than a full-body exoskeleton with heavy plates and jet packs attached...
---
Could kind of be like Housing in Elder Scrolls Online or Grand Theft Auto Online.
---
A separate cell that requires a slight load screen, but allows much more decorating (Except maybe for walls/floors since it's a pre-built base. Maybe you can change to a different design, but not remove the built parts?), and helps improve performance of the game world by being separate.
---
You could have a group of fixed bunker locations, and a one time Caps payment to gain ownership inside (and limit players to one Bunker, not multiple, to keep things behaving well). If you visit one of the locations and other people also have Bunkers that they allow public access to, when you use the main entrance, it could prompt you as to whether you want to enter your Bunker or another players.
---
...Maybe also disable weapons while inside, to prevent a mess.
---
No problem. Saw a camp there a few weeks back. Nice setup &amp; pretty visible from the high school parking lot. LMK if you decided to lay your shop down there, I'll come check it out :D
---
It's not aimed at level 30-40 players. It's aimed at level 50 players, _per the description in the announcements_. I keep saying this, but level 50 characters are capable of exactly the same shit as level 350 characters, especially if you bank the last ten or so points to finish out your build.
---
GT DAPANDA280 send a msg I’ll inv
---
Alright man
---
I have bear arms.  My minigun weights 1.6 lbs
---
It's probably one of my favorite mutations. Meat is so plentiful. You dont have to carry much on you at all because you're usually killing animals as you play thru. Ionized meat from nuke zones never decays and 2 full your health bar. With the cannibal mutation it's even better.
---
Not intentionally, sometimes I’ll just dump a load of junk before remembering to scrap it
---
Rofl, you think it's a quote from a show... It's much older than GoT (Which I didn't even know someone used it in that show. Which character says it?)
---
So once again you just don't understand what I was saying. You both misunderstood what inwas saying. That isn't my problem if you two misunderstand what I say. You are just some random no name on the internet so I really don't care that you think I'm a douche just because you can't understand the way I speak, that isn't my problem. 
---
Sweetheart I'm probably old enough to be your mother and I've spoken this way since you were probably still in diapers. Very few have trouble understanding my way speaking so it sure as shit isn't going to change just to cater to a couple of kids on the internet.
---
Sorry it's a joke from spongebob.
---
Amazingly well-said, Knight!  For gosh sakes, we have  2 minutes to prepare our defenses against a wave Mole Rats invading our workshop and ZERO time to prepare for the biggest threat in the game...other people. It's almost comical.
---
Agreed. Far Harbor radstorms and pics in the glowing sea were my laptop wallpapers for a long time.
---
There's nothing to justify, it's objectively something that can be improved by removing unnecessary clicks.  
---
Let's review, it wasn't about weight, it does affect things and no one was bitching. Where you plan on moving the goalposts to next?
---
Level 139 and have only found 2 pieces so far. But I also only recently learned that sentinel doesnt appear in the item name and may have sold a bunch without knowing it as well.
---
Yeah, let's reward people for staying afk for months, that's smart.
---
Sent
---
Nobody understands the respawn mechanics *because* there are so many people running around like headless chickens. Myself included.
---
How does it work exactly? 
---
I remember when the game first came out and people were hitting 50, I saw a nuke at whitespring and stopped by. Everyone was standing way out in the golf course, and one dude would run in, aggro that one building full of ghouls, and then he’d run out with a massive group behind him. And then everyone just started shooting and chucking grenades. It was way more efficient than what I see now...
---
Wha too you play on?
---
Can't nuke it it's in the safe zone
---
Woo downvote me because a product is shit! Yeah buddy!
---
Soon™
---
Are you getting a loading circle or nothing at all?
---
I had no idea ionized meat never decays and does that for your health! That’s nice for a strength build as well!
---
I don’t know why OP limited this cool idea to PA in the first place. Then again, I hate PA so there’s that.
---

---
yes it has already been figured out those are the vending machines
---
25th
---
Yep. That’s literally it. It’s a really good place for scrap, but the story was underwhelming. I’ve also heard it’s loaded with legendaries when you nuke it but I can’t confirm this.
---
Update your drivers, I'm running at 3440x1440 and I can't remember the last time I've had a crash, so might be having an issue with an old driver if you're crashing.
---
Thanks for organized and direct feedback free of emotional outbursts. This is how things get fixed.
---
Once legendary scrapping comes out, I have a feeling much of our stash space woes will be solved.
---
That being said, it's still ridiculous that we have stash space limits at all, in a game where the primary content of the entire game is farming loot. C'mon Bethesda, is your server architecture from 2008 along with your game engine?
---
Same
---
Suggest any
---
The challenges are made well in advance, probably a month ahead of time and are added via update. When they pushed back the release of the camera they likely forgot to go back and change the challenges to no include the camera. Hard to say if they plan on pushing an update out to fix the challenges so they are not impossible.
---
Well “BOS combat limbs” doesn’t exist so it’s definitely not that, it could be arms or legs, those exist.
---
I believe it may weigh a tiny bit more than other meats but it's so worth it. The food bar fills so much off of it. I usually always keep a grilled radstag on me for that extra carry weight if I get over encumbered and a ton of ionized meat and nothing else. The canned dog food takes about 8 to ten to fill my whole food bar. Ionized meat is two at most. And you can stash extra because it doesnt rot.
---
Bethesda must have the worst servers ever then, given that many other online MMORPG's allow players to save ridiculous numbers of unique loot items. WTF is Bethesda doing that their servers suck so much?
---
New challenge today for 20 atoms is "Take a picture of a player engaged in pvp while in a rad storm". Saying that it's hopeless to complete that challenge is an egregious understatement. It is 99.99999999% impossible. I know it's a camera challenge and that the camera isn't implemented yet, but that doesn't make it any less impossible.
---
Also, yea we didn't complete the challenges, so I think a nice compromise would be 75% of the total atoms we could have earned with those challenges.
---
Thanks for the tip. So when you’re Pacifist you can still destroy their base because of Ricochet? I thought when in Pacifist their turrets can’t hurt you and you can’t damage them either.
---
The one on the left looks like the back of a nuka cola machine... but I haven’t checked
---
Yeah. What's up with that? LoL
---
Lolol, you’re delusional. Crazy old bat. 
---
Once again, the GoT quotes just make you seem lame. It’s the doucheyness that makes you a douche. If that upsets you, then maybe you should look in the mirror and change yourself. Don’t take it out on the internet lolol.
---
Nobody misunderstood anything. You’re just a douche. And it has nothing to do with what you said, and everything to do with how you said it. 
---
Dumbass.
---
it`s a really scarry bug/problem and the Mod bug makes it even worse!
---
Okay i will make sure to grind pumpkin house
---
I know that.  But a the point once again is look from the perspective of the lower level player.  If I had the guns I do now at level 30-40 I could run it with reasonable ease.  I had much worse weapons and armor at that level but if I was geared close to where I am now it would be easier. 
---
 Take away the gear you spent 50+ hours getting after level 50, the experience we have dealing with mobs in a confined space, and a clear idea how we want to build out our character and you get the experience they were promoting.  We have enough knowledge, experience, and gear to make it easy, the people it's geared towards don't.
---
Limbs are another word for arms and legs.
---
Please read other posts, this has been mentioned to death. Camera got delayed, but they haven’t removed camera related quests for whatever reason. You can’t do that one yet.
---
They want a live service, pseudo MMO experience, without all the maintenance and hot fixing that comes with such an endeavour.
---
thanks, I had found it already, but not the plan.. I found a plan, just not the BOS CA.
---
I got the plans on my second try at grafton, and am still checking at top of the world, haven't found anything there yet.
---
the chest plans are the only ones I need, the others I just want extra copies of
---
It’s always that ivory grip.
---
Haven’t played in a few weeks but that’s hilarious, what happened to the dailies of “pick ten plants”
---
Many thanks for the reply. I got a Zealot's Dragon in a drop and wanted to see if it would become my new SB killer. 
---
The Queen I did once and that was enough..lol.
---
Glad to hear that, mate, lmao. Just gonna rebuild my camp itself as one a dumpster tower so that it's a permanent structure instead of a mere workshop creation that I made the mistake of not blueprinting. Once I make it into a functioning camp, then it will truly be the peak art that it was meant to be.
---
I've done three nuke zones at Harper's and the Barrows. Each time sucked. There does appear to be a higher chance legendaries will spawn, however... but good luck finding those spawns. Up top or down below I found almost no action any of the times I went.
---
(it's a video game)
---
The ability to earn MT currency in-game was touted as a feature by the studio even before the game was released. Why are you surprised that some people prioritize this? Cosmetic skins and base building are a big part of an online rpg for many players.
---
I imagine our characters tuck the butt of the gun up under their armpit and hold it there while they reload? Who knows? Video game logic maybe? LoL.
---
Eloquent tables?
---
I’m thinking this was it too.
---
I love that slow awkward turn towards the stash box like: "I'm just gonna.. put this right... in heeeeere"
---
Did they say that. Or will it be a part of the build budget? I was having this thought the other day
---
Nope he didn't remove his post. See now I know you are less informed on this than I am. The mods took his post down, that is why it is still currently on his profile.
---
He wasn't called out at all, people ended up doing the math and it turned out you can farm enough mats to make all the ammo bethesda accused him of having over 30 days in a 2 week period.
---
So unless you can offer me any link to something ive not already seen you've been misunderstanding this whole situation thinking he deleted his posts and comments.
---
Yes, high DR/ER means you'll take less damage which will keep you at high heath. So it will be better long term.
---
Why then has Bethesda introduced a dedicated Survival Mode? Reality check for you trolls, your griefing days are numbered in AM while it gets re-balanced and most if-not-all pvp-centric (thus troll bait) B.S. gets dumped into SM. Smart move on Bethesda's end to keep trolls who can't hang in real PvP from toxifying the larger community. 
---
On the same token, you want PvP...go to Survival Mode. Unless you can't run with the real PvP dogs, stick to trolling Adventure Mode until the meantime /s
---
I can't say that it properly scared me, because at the moment I didn't feel endangered, but it did fill my mind with that sweet sense of mystery (which I didn't think I'd find in a fallout game). I'm sad it was just some fx, but I love the general creepy vibe they have chosen for the game, with the cryptids, the stories, locations, etc.
---
Careful, you don't want Bethesda "balancing" anything 😁
---
I wouldn't mind a piggy bank or a vault boy/girl bank that I could place in my camp and not carry around 24,000 caps all the time. Also make it so that if you go into someone's else's camp with a piggy bank that you can access your caps just like the stash box.
---
Well yes, but in this game limbs means both, and legs and arms are specific, for example the “deep pocketed combat armor limbs” unlocks both legs and arms, but the “BOS combat armor legs” only unlocks the legs.
---
In my opinion the most effectiv way would be reducing the junk space to something like 500 and giving us dedicated stashslot with space for like 50 weapons+armors and 50 aid items which ignores weight all together.
---
What is that guide?
---
It’s the official guide
---
Adhesive is tough to keep stocked too
---
Price on auto ‘nade launcher?
---
The +x% increase depends on how much base damage the weapon has due to how the equation works. Yes, FO4's was only 30%, but I was looking through how the effect was programmed to see if it was mechanically different in what it considered a x% reduction to be, and they don't disagree.
---
This may be more because FO4 had much better options for straight damage increase, though, as many receivers would give 50-100% bonus damage, versus a piercing receiver would only give 30%.
---
My low level character killed 2 higher level players &amp; was just about to kill their third when my target yelled "I don't want any trouble!" on the mic. So I stopped &amp; teamed up with them to help get them through the main story line (first time Fo76 player who'd decided to start in Survival).
---
I really am terrible at PvP.
---
I would have preferred it if they had just kept the mystery, so partially agree.
---
It isn't a GoT quote idiot. That is the point, it is a common turn of phrase from about 30 years ago. You're very slow aren't you? ROFL
---
Maybe u/Yabvone
---
Check a combat helmet then. That’s the only other option
---
I have a carry weight of 400, my stash is full, and I use bufftats + nuka cola dark + Party Boy + Cola Nut to fast travel. We definitely need more space. The backpack will be a godsend if the +150 carry weight is true.
---
They essentially expanded the map even though it doesn't show on the map. Glad to see it.
---
Ah okay, thanks
---
yes when you mod a gun those don't get the weight reduction
---
Limiting the economy is a shitty way of Bethesda saying, "we don't have enough endgame content so we're going to artificially cap how much you can save".
---
Instead of capping your caps amount, they should just add endgame-tier items that cost lots of caps. Cosmetics usually fulfill this purpose in many MMORPG's.
---
And my response, as hard as it may be to take, is grow up. Life gets harder that idiots being idiots.
---
I have 12k atoms because I’m the kind of person that wants to complete all the challenges. At this point, daily/weekly challenges are the only thing I really even log in to do anymore. And guess what? Nowadays I actually dread looking at them because I know I’ll be lucky to do 2/5 (camera ones notwithstanding). I’ve barely logged in this week.
---
What do you think OP? Would it make sense for your carry weight to go down as you increase your strength?
---
yea exactly their fix would be raise the weight of the polehook not reduce the weight of the sledge
---
its actually a bit easy with the right build. i hold just fine with my Vampire's .50 cal, Blocker and Excavator power armor. other builds could do even better.. just depends if those who can tank claim the Pylons. Mr. 2 HP bloodied build cannot claim a Pylon to lower her shields
---
Its one of the pieces of gear that isn't level gated so yeah it would be beneficial to you but it isn't needed and as an "end game" piece it should be very hard for you to create at your level.
---
It is a game of throne quote, whether you’re aware of it or not. And using it makes you seem super lame. And, AGAIN, it’s not why you’re a douche. Fucking dumbass.
---
Your lame tv quotes have nothing to do with why you’re a huge douchebag. How many times do I have to say this for you to get it? You’re very slow aren’t your, old bat? You sure you’re not going senile?
---
On the note of rad storms, I know we are making changes so Nuked zones count towards those challenge rewards. Unfortunately I don't have answers for the other questions at this time, but we are bringing up those player concerns to the team. I wish I could give you a more solid answer than that!
---
What about the picture? there is literally 2 ghouls in one of them...I don't see hordes of ghouls anywhere.
---
Idk maybe 1000?
---
It's actually not too bad once people know what they're doing. My friend who has a high health / power armor build usually takes all three pylons and I'm a bloodied build and I can get hits on her pretty good-  as long as everyone is doing what they need to do - holding pylons /clearing adds- it's really not that bad.
---
no me and 3 other people killed it just fine and i was all 3 conduits
---
Nope. But the more I play the more I seem to rethink how important some Special traits are. I’m at 6 right now for strength and would definitely go down to 5 if it means more carry weight
---
If you would havr lookrd at my original post is specifically said. "That depends on if he is one of those banned for having too much ammo". So no from the beginning I've been specific on this. So no it isn't moving the goalposts just because you didn't pay very close attention to my comments.
---
Todd Howard said at PAX that allowing all characters into Survival was a way to Beta Test survival mode, and that he was interested in maybe doing PvP seasons that last a month and require you to make a new character.

This is what makes me crazy about Bethesda.  Fix this shit!  We don’t need a new quest or new items in the atom store.
---
I think I haven't seen yet a single wendigo of a level higher than 42.
---
Thanks for this. I had no idea. I’m going to have to rethink my strength points. I just figured the more strength points the more I could carry.
---
The harder part is finding a radstorm unless you’re on the game all the time.  The pvp part can be done by playing with friends and then having two of them PvP and getting a photo of it....
---
You want to unload them? Lol - I’ll pay good value - seems to be 2500-3000 on these forums
---
YYES, sorry I mixed the two words up
---
Minor correction. It's not the same set of tools. The tools in an actually engine or sdk are absolutely.massive and allow you to create something like this. 
---
People push the limits of the small subset of apis and introduce their own graphics, but to equate writing a game from scratch or even in part using a compiled serious game enginer,builds , pipelines etc.. to making mods is crazy. 
---
The amount of resources it takes to make a game, the people, the infrastructure, minimizing that because someone did something novel with what is essentially a plug-in for this architecture is naive af.
---
Nice! I'm excited, this should allow me to use my Cryolater more often than SB Queen fights.
---
In a similar vein, the Light Machine Gun chews .308 crazy fast. I realize this is different since many other weapons use .308 rounds as well, but I think that it should still be increased on precedent of 5mm ammo (and also 50Cal rounds).
---
Both Miniguns and Gatling Guns use 5mm. The Gatling Gun has high damage and relatively low fire rate and could easily get by on a lower crafting yield, but 5mm is easy to make a lot of to (presumably) facilitate players who use a Mingun instead, which wouldn't be viable if 5mm yields were balanced around Gatling Guns. 
---
Hunting Rifles that use the 50 Cal receiver gain a similar advantage, since their ammo's crafting yields are balanced around the 50Cal Machinegun.
---
Light Machine Guns got the opposite treatment, compared to Miniguns and 50Cal MGs, and it makes me sad.
---
(And while we're giving the LMG some love, please give us an extended magazine mod or something!)
---
I'm good at shooters too. Getting oneshot by someone who i can shoot 50 times without dying doesnt show skill just gear. Having equal gear and weapons for most of the time, and better stuff if you invest more into it would be fair. Massive duping on op gear was the issue, not that the gear exists. Even if you bought it "fair" you benefited from dupe plummeted pricing.
---
I’ll have to check, not sure that’s what the plans are called
---
It certainly can't help the server instability!
---
Cork is for 'Light-Weight' armor
---
Gears are for Turrets
---
Still unsure if Chalk or Coal have any use whatsoever.
---
Just launched my first ever nuke at HF and hit lvl100 in the process.
---
Got a Ghoul Slayer's Sickle and a piece of Regenerating Wood Armor in the Burrows. Yay! And topside, there weren't any legendary enemies whatsoever. What a great location for a nuke!
---
Afterwards, on a super short loop through regular WS, I picked up half a dozen legendaries.   
---
Granted, these sucked, too... but considering the additional time and effort it takes to launch a nuke at HF and the meager rewards you get for doing so - just for the illusion of variation - it's just not worth it.
---
If they wanted to make the Burrows an alternative to WS farming, they f\*ed up.  
---
And if they didn't want to make the Burrows an alternative to WS farming, then there's no reason to come back to this place after the initial visit (doing the quest) - except for the music, maybe. The music in the Burrows is really cool.
---
But to be honest, I'm fairly convinced that this whole "Nuke + Burrows = Glowing Ghouls without radiation" business is a completely unintentional side-effect... it has this certain "Bethesda Seal Of Quality" to it...
---
ROFL, it can't be a GoT quote when it existed long before the show. That isn't how that works. You really are that slow holy shit. You've got to be trolling at this point.  There is no way someone actually believes that some modern thing uses a phrase or song it becomes theirs and not the modern thing quoting the older thing...
---
Let me guess the Beatles need to stop sampling jayz too right?
---
Yeah I just realized this the other day. Has no one at Bethesda ever held a gun? A hunting rifle typically weighs 10 pounds max. The heaviest ive ever heard of was a rifle being used by someone in the military that had a light, laser, scope,  and high Cap. Magazine. It weighed 16 pounds. So why the hell does a handmade assault rifle with no attachments weigh 21 pounds?
---
Don’t suppose you still have one spare do you? Willing to buy.
---
I would like some faction-related items, like flags and statues.
---
There's hardcore PvP players in other games that come onto F76 for the questing and co-op. Making sweeping generalizations that all Adventure Mode players are, "...weenie hut juniors who can't handle pvp."  is indicative of dopey perspective of what true competition really means. Let's talk about level playing field. That's what true pvp is. Killing unsuspecting players modding their hunting rifle while you waltz up pretending to use their stash is just anarchy and just straight up griefing. Where is the line drawn in this wild west? Can we dox you, pull up to your home address and break your xbox with a sledgehammer while you're at work and call it "PvP"? /End Sarcasm. Level playing fields are imperative for true sportsmanship and true competition. Bethesda has responsibility to provide that balance. Workshop rules in Adventure Mode are defunct and part of an old version of Fallout 76 where Survival Mode did not yet exist.
---
It's cool. I definitely think I have it. 100 caps &amp; it's yours, if I do. I also have a large assortment of other plans you may need as well. I can jump on in a few to have a look. What's your GT?
---
Yes I'll admit ocd is the main reason, but it's just so hard to find stuff sometimes!
---
I play heavy as it’s more viable on weapons weight than rifleman is. I’d much rather play as a sniper/stealth character but never mind lol.
---
I've tried every other week since about a month after release to enjoy this shit show of a game. I can't give up, but I really want to.
---
Take a cryolator, it's really easy then.
---
How do you know what weapons are coming as the weekly reward
---
Yeah, I just did mine with a combat knife.
---
Its getting fixed next week with the camera update, hang in there
---
Yes. Consumes card to start event.
---
Well it might not be true!
---
Yes, it’ll still use up the keycard if you fail
---
\*daily challenges.
---
Not quests. You're probably confusing people that want to help you. But yes, the camera is delayed but some moron forgot the daily challenges go along with the camera since it was being delayed.
---
Switch weapons via the quick button... it switched back fully loaded with some delay...
---
I’m rocking a quad crossbow and that’s how I reload so I pretend I’m hip loading.
---
Next patch i think.
---
&gt;removing the weight of junk
---
I’ve mentioned this with my buddies. I’m constantly scrapping stuff as it’s important that I do, but my stash is almost all junk, nothing else
---
Yes it's so annoying, especially when I didn't even mean to pick it up, just clicked away and went "crap I did not need another one of those keys"!
---
Just what already op builds need, another 1 hit weapon lmao.
---
I believe he may actually be correct. My uni statistics is a bit rusty (couple of years ago), but I do believe that the sample size here is the number of runs (thus N=17), not the amount of ghouls you have killed (N=1989). The reason being that you are trying to find out the average spawn chance of legendary monsters in a run. 
---
I’d compare it to a huge bag of colored marbles (1989 just for easy comparison), and you’re trying to find out the average chance of pulling a black marble out of the bag. If you try doing that 17 times, you would be in the same situation as the runs and the sample size would be N=17.
---
Again, I might be completely wrong. It’s just my thoughts on the matter :).
---
fair enough, might try messaging people first - like "Mind if i tag along" or something like that as some people do like to just play solo\~
---
XB1?
---
Lvl 50? If you’re on now I’ll snag it
---
Oh man me too. I was constantly quick saving in the Sierra Madre so I didn't lose a fuckton of progress because I'm not the most observant person.
---
Yeah 👍🏻
---
Colonel Vosch! I was planning on taking a break but I’ll stay afk for now. Shoot me a pm on Xbox when you wanna trade
---
Damn when would you or anyone recommend I use it to ensure a success? I am a solo player for the most part so dont really have friends that play fo often.
---
Nah hardened mass is still safe
---
Yes exactly, even as a sub-menu like in New Vegas. And I'm on ps4 so mods aren't really an option.
---
HA! Gaaaaaarrry
---
If you're on pc let me know when its rebuilt I gotta see this in game lol
---
You wait for the devs to add it in.
---
(It's in the game data, but hasn't actually been released yet.)
---
it specially says for the .44, you can't hate on bethesda for your mistake
---
Because Todd wills it
---
Sounds good. Gimme like 10 mins and I'll hit you up :)
---
I’m sure there’s lore or reasoning why there’s nothing on tv anymore since the world ended.
---
Yes it's lvl 50 and yes i'm online
---
Love it. More people should do this! (not that I want free ammo because I'm a girl but seriously, who would complain haha)
---
I think I might still... will log in and check now but can help you out either way. Will DM you 👍
---
I’d be so down. We ain’t got any sentry bots with personality.
---
Yeah, me too. There's like three of us that must have started at almost the same time. Pretty awesome.
---
But can i get a channel with 3 dog tho?
---
I once got two dirty water in trade for a wood piece. What a steal!
---
The best is, the pieces the game wont let him mod are pieces he had to craft again after the game swallowed them. One of our team mates had 4 pieces disappear and he can't mod the new pieces he crafted either.
---
The stash limit is the main issue I face when trying to get my best bud to finally play 76. It's something that we talk about a lot.
---
I think that bumping the stash limit to 1,000 would be really nice. But I think they need to do a complete rebalance of item weights. A whole bunch of weights don't make much sense, and even more items have weights that are overly punishing compared to how valuable they are. 
---
The game also desperately needs a global stash that's accessible by all of your characters. I've been away from this subreddit for a long time, but I'm sure there are a bunch of posts explaining why that's a necessity.
---
But man! I've been getting back into this game and I'm having so much fun with it. It just blows my mind how much time I spend managing my inventory in every play session. I enjoy a bit of inventory management, but it's just WAY too much. I really don't get how solving this isn't their prime concern. It's a constant buzz kill.
---
Both of those guns, and to a lesser degree cryolators, should get buffed.
---
Thankfully it sounds like Flamers and Cryos are getting ammo buffs, crossing fingers for LMGs
---
Not when it's in your STASH it doesn't.
---
Read the ITV
---
Thank you.
---
It could even be made from actual trappers! That would be awesome! "I thought it was the Necronomicon, but it turns out it's for putting papers in..."
---
Smile and wave is what I’ve been doing. But a ‘no thanks’ emote would be way better.
---
[Discussion] Okay, let’s discuss how this is totally on you for not paying attention.
---
Ah damn. I think I have one but I’m on PC. I’m not 100% sure it’s for X-01 but... well that doesn’t matter anyway since we aren’t on the same platform!
---
But I don't want realism dammit. I want infinite stuff so I don't have to make hard choices. I want my stash to be run like Gmail.
---
Sure you can cheese it like that and share it around among a group of three. But that is not how it is "supposed" to go. It really does feel like who ever came up with that has never though about implementing it. It is also just 10 atoms same as just killing ten enemies whilst wearing a common outfit.
---
Yes, it will. I also learned the hard way that you can only have 1 recall card at a time in your inventory, as it consumes any/all that you have.
---
I want to be able to hang photos you take in game on my wall.
---
Sorry, can I ask what you mean by cells? I really do appreciate these answers! I have one more question that if you guys don't mind.... why is Whitesprings nearly always the nuke location?
---
But the single action uses 44 plus they are the  only two revolvers in the game. I could have spent atoms on something better but at least have the paint for both guns. If they both can have the ivory grip then why can't they both have the gold paint.
---
It will be fixed on Tuesday.  It was announced here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bf2ovw/unable_to_craft_or_install_mods_to_armor/
---
I would recommend if you’re on Xbox you can do a group post and tell people to join off your profile, or you could post in a fallout 76 community form that’s your doing the sheep. :) good luck!
---
Kinda wish I had that, just for the goldeneye throwback
---
I assumed as much.
---
thing about tesla rifles is they chain their damage to every target in the area. so if you have a good one you can just thrash hoards instantly.
---
i use a two shot shotgun tesla in low areas and i can clear rooms with 1-2 shots.
---
New cryptid hunt quests each week to look for it, doomed to fail, and then eventually you will find the real clue and the sheepsquach will be in game.
---
Pay attention to the other post I'm talking about kid. If they both can have ivory why can't they both have gold. Instead
---
You will soon
---
It's for server stability.
---
I'm pretty sure you can overcharge cores just be having really high int. I've got a set of random 1* unyielding i use for crafting and I always get 120% cores, which seems to be the max?
---
According to other posts I've read here, you may be able to open a ticket on the bethesda support site for a refund.
---
Your assumption is incorrect. The only time i even think about using them is against the teams of all (no doubt 'legitimate' 🙄) ass/sentinels that just sit there and jump up and down and call everyone trash. They tend to love spawn camping as well. 
---
I've no illusions about being an elite player, my best run is only 19 kills, and average is only 8.
---
Stealth boys are broken. There are lots of broken bits in this game.  They are the only broken bits i can get my hands on legitimately
---
"Your wish is our command. Your stash now contains infinite stuff. You can scroll for hours and never make it past the A's. Good luck!" -- Bethesda

Daily Challenges for the week of April 22: 
---
have 10,000 or more atoms 
---
Kill the scorchbeast queen with a laser rifle
---
Take a picture next to a legendary radroach that dropped a vanguard's wood left leg for your party member
---
Level up (3)
---
Take a picture of a level 69 character using the finger guns emote at a level 420 player, who is naked with a tinfoil hat and sunglasses while using a legendary pool cue
---
Does it eat into the budget though? I’m already at max budget.. ;(
---
10/10 best RP
---
1.  Make sure there are a lot of high level players on your servrer before starting the event.  2. Try to find someone who has a good Cryolator that can freeze the imposter so that everyone else can destroy her quickly and control the minion bots
---
Just cheese it and move on. You’ll be happier with  that new (insert favorite atom store purchase) you just bought.
---
Yeah I've made probably 160~ of these things trying to get the mods and I'm pretty sure I'm still missing 5 of them.
---
Yeah, even without +40% swing speed, this is the first weapon I’m interested in acquiring. I forget the eventual challenge except that it sounded easy.
---
itv and i think theres a update thread that has the weapons listed :)
---
No, unfortunately not. It was nowhere to be found.
---
What's the Borrows?
---
Why is raider power armor so rare though even though it's wood tier I always see t 51s
---
OOF the skeleton costume has a designated spawn, so it’s not rare :/
---
For excavator PA!
---
Gotta keep it nice and strong :)
---
I'm really excited for this one\~ it's actually gonna get me into Survival. I already have a Bloodied Faster Swing but I just gotta collect all the deathclaw things\~
---
Well.. now you've heard that it's GREAT to nuke. Looks like you have a difficult decision to make...
---
It is not too hard, it is a difficult event, but people know how to win now and are able to even do it solo. 
---
You can not depend on other people, so become the conduits and take her down!
---
Ok to be fair, I did not take lead and steel into account, I keep plenty of that as well for ammunition. True.
---
I believe the issue is in part the engine they use for the game.
---
I would love the garage door in different materials like the metal set and the brick set.  I just can't bring myself to use it the way it is right now.  Glass in the windows would be really nice also.
---
Yeah, its a real bummer. I want to keep running the event as I would REALLY love to get the Imposter set, but this event is way too high cost/high risk and low reward. 9/10 times the group fails the event, and it seems like when we DO win, I just get the damn fedora.
---
I say they should drop loot for any lower levels that do damage too. It's unfair for them to do a total decent damage and get nothing out of it
---
Kid?
---
QQ Dumbass
---
Yea, I think it might not be right. I found this, which shows a straight increase with no back-offs:
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Strength
---
I sold 2 before someone told me this;)
---
No. The branch that made this game was the first of it's kind otherwise what about all the elder scrolls online. Idc if it's online. I'm talking about one specific gun as to where if you're gonna have a gold paint for one revolver it should at least carry over to the single action. It's not that hard and the single action revolver is probably more common then a 44 and all they gave us was an ivory grip that doesn't like to show half of the time
---
And again and again
---
Adrenal syringer is good too
---
My cores tend to be 140%, with Weapon Artisan on, tho I only get one core at a time.
---
Invite. Because ammo PSAs are, in fact, useful to us need👍
---
I might be misremembering but isn't there a "sour face shaking head" emote? I get invites all the time and feel especially bad when it's someone close by and I have to deny. Often I just run away but sometimes I have used the thumbs down emote.
---
Heres the semi short answer to your question. To level efficiently you need a consistent system that requires low inputs [ time, ammo resources etc] and high output [ item upgrades xph]. To maximize your output start by deciding how you want to farm: spam events like uranium fever for low lvl guarenteed 3 legendarys per run and decent xp or something along the lines of whitespring by commercially farming those areas and cycling through. How do you maximize one of those processes? Save up some caps, aprox 15k and buy yourself an explosive weapon, ideally bloodied,  but that will depend on your build. That will greatly speed up farming. If using power armor get the emergency protocol mod and 3 pts in your luck tree in serendipity  to guarentee high dps for maximum tankiness in power armor.  Repeat this process until you get to high lvl and can afford buying an armor set for pvp or pve depending on your playstyle and goals. Also note if you cant afford explosive ranged weps go buy a bloodied meele wep and 1 tap anything w the right perk and armor set up. This can be done in power armor w the righ build.
---
Yeah my guess is typo. Even right above it (I should’ve included this in the photo) it says, “so the higher the strength, the more you can physically carry”
---
Thank you for the tips.
---
I’ve been forced to forgo mutations for about 15 levels, so a strong basic weapon like this is appealing to me. I like that it’s heavy attack focused, I haven’t found a melee weapon with both power attack effects.
---
Obviously if you didn't care you wouldn't be getting but hurt 🤣 trip
---
I believe this is simply not true. I’m at 15 strength and my base carry weight (naked, no meds etc) is 225. Formula should be 150+(strength*5).
---
And my response is you grow up. The problem is not the people getting harassed daring say something about it or the people who disapprove and want people to not be assholes saying something about it, the assholes are the problem. So not sure why you want to side with the assholes and claim the people saying something are the ones that are the problem unless you happen to be one of them.
---
It's an error. Carry weight goes up by 5 per Strength point. Experiment with strength-boosting drugs or food if you want to check for yourself.
---
I live in the US but never saw a single ad for it or the product in any stores. Yeah I don't go out much. I only found out about it because it was a meme
---
Ask your friend to add me. Kung-Foo-Kitteh. I have one for him. I stopped using mine when I switched over to a bloodied Gauss.
---
How do I get there?
---
It's not so much the servers themselves as it is the architecture of the game engine. The item management is based on a single player game whereas most MMO's were built with multiple players in mind so there was better item handling from the get go.
---
Also keep in mind that most other MMORPGS's don't keep tons of items loaded on the map at all times. Most have static shops with rarely changing items, random loot rolls for every instance, no/little on map items to pickup, no/little on map chests that store loot information, and limited on character inventory. There are only a couple I can think of that are exceptions, ARK and 7D2D, both of which store items in the world rather than a floating file.
---
Thanks for confirming.
---
There are posts of the model on the subreddit that people have dug out of game files. Mysterious hints are trickling in in-game. Most recently people (myself included) have stumbled across brahmin corpses riddled with "mysterious quills". These quills match the sheepsquatch model that's been posted. I'm assuming we'll see them before Nuclear Winter drops.
---
You made an entire butthurt post.
---
In that case, you can simply click the left stick to sort by weight, and all the unscrapped junk should go to the top, for the most part.
---
Im a pvper, but try to live in the survival servers but sometimes it's nice to be able fast travel places and I need more ammo so I hang out in adventure while I resupply. If your at my workshop I'm probably going to stop and and take it from you, maybe murder once or twice to recoup the fast travel and capping your workshop costs. 
---
Theres a big warning when you go to take a work shop "hey stop people might come kill you" you signed the waver and I'm not gunna feel bad for playing a game the way I wanna play it.
---
It specifically tells you its for the .44
---
Well, there goes the value of my only good SBQ drop :P
---
You should call it dumpster-henge.

sick bot Phoenix charged me 6000+ caps for it. I’ll burn his shopping plaza down next time I’m in watoga.

The recourse involves getting a lawyer and building a case that you are innocent, the onus is on you. Sort of a guilty until proven innocent thing.
---
At lvl 160 the burrow was ok for me. I don’t expect much in the game to be a challenge anymore. 
---
When I was level 50, my best weapon was an all rise and my perk loadout was garbage. I can see the burrows being a difficult and fun side quest.
---
Thanks for taking the time to say what you know anyways. I know you are the go between so I appreciate the response anyways.
---
I hope this isn’t true.  I used one today and had 2 in my inventory.  I’ll have to check if the other one is still there.
---
Maybe it is a graphics driver issue? Update your graphics driver and try other games to see if they have the same problem. Also try from the main menu changing display mode from window borderless to fullscreen or vice versa in the video settings.
---
This.
---
Same way you find Big Foot.... ;-)
---
2004 I think.
---
I disagree, I think the world needs 64 players with 600 stash each.
---
That's incredibly scumbaggy, luckily I had only one of those experiences. And that's not roleplay, they are just using bad game design to annoy players. It's no other thing than bullying.
---
Wheres the ITV
---
i'm a pistol build also and was disappointed since my western is a full 10% more damage, but i'm just glad we finally got a decent pistol skin, now where's my 10mm skins at?
---
OUCH
---
I wouldnt say nothing
---
I just give mine to lower level players. I do with you could bulk it and sell it.
---
Hah.  The only bounties I have ever had are from smashing the WSGC turret camps.  Just want to point out that I've seen some pretty cool and useful ones without turrets on the fairways.
---
Where do you get even a regular one?
---
Zenimax is a whole other studio/developer.
---
Sweet roll gives you a cariama boost, I forget where to find the recipe though
---
Why isn't this more common? People want NPCs but this is 10x better.
---
yes please this, it's super annoying since when you create bulk items you don't get the plastic back when you scrap a bulk.
---
Right after ypu show me the math that allows someone to amass 300k+ammo in 30 days.
---
The 300k that **I saw** in the pictures **he posted**.
---
Funny thing is, you can make like 72x .308 when crafting ultracite ammo. I believe it uses something common like fluorescent flux too. Making a prime LMG and using only ultracite ammo is a pretty good alternative
---
Also, saying that .308 crafting needs to be low for the hunting/pipe bolt action balance is just rubbish because you can make 180x .50 cal ammo from one stack and that can be used by the .50 cal hunting rifle, which is supposed to be the high-end mod for it

Fallout 76&gt;Submit a ticket&gt; Billing/Purchase/Code&gt; *I need help with the atomic shop&gt;I  want a refund*
---
Pretty good but I personally would change a lot
---
Firstly you’re playing nerd rage so you’ll be doing a lot of damage with any weapon regardless of perk cards so I would lower the 2h cards to 1 star each and completely remove rifleman and replace it with glow sight. I would also use martial artist because the extra swing speed and decreased weapon weight for 2h is a must have. I personally think serendipity has to be 3stars so you’ll be dodging almost half the attacks against you
---
Changed the build to what I would use:
---
[Fallout 76 Build with 15/1/4/6/5/14/11](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4AAwUEDQoBAQEPAQIDBAUHCQoNDg8QERITNBMBTwMLA1EDbAEPAjUBdwONAQGzAQO1AQKTAQF4A4IBAzYCNAF5A80BAcIBAVkB8AEDqQEB1QEB8QEDxAEDQAUA)
---
Mirror: https://streamr.nz/MUSIZ6
---
I buy random stuff to try out and when my stash is full I have to scrap them. It’s such a pain to have to deal with this caps limit.
---
So basically your saying level up melee then make the switch to heavy guns? At what level should I start dumping points into the heavy perks?
---
I RP as a wood elf from TES so you can fuck right off bud.
---
The developers of 76 said they found code from Morrowind still in the engine, so try 2002 atleast.
---
Unless in small groups starting out
---
Thank you for being a trooper and telling the fan boys that their game is just a really bad copy paste
---
I can't get to the main menu, it just goes through the loading screen and then crashes. And it isn't a driver problem I already updated those and other games are working. I sent in a ticket and they believe it is a wifi problem but everything they ask me to do doesn't work
---
The time communism is usefull
---
Yes. It’s a surprise however :)
---
&gt; I didn't even know what the paper bag looked like.
---
Unfortunately this is how most new players react. I’ve tried helping tons of people, and half the time they just ignore me or run. And even when they don’t, it’s such a struggle to get them to even look at the bag, let alone take the stuff :/
---
It would be nice if there was an easier way to gift things. Trading for 0 caps sounds easy, but trading in general is a nightmare.
---
Ah well, good luck out there.
---
Yes!!
---
Place one above each other on each wall. And link them up. Should connect and give power.
---
Bobble heads and magazines need to become decorations or lighter in stash...I’ve not used any since starting and have a huge stash budget for those things
---
I haven't missed out on killing OR looting the queen in months; what platform are you running on?
---
For now the best you can do when someone is grieffing is just enter another server. The pvp mechanics are still ridiculous and allow for shitty player behaviour. It's another one of the factors that sadly bring down the game, at least for me. The others being the bugs and the incredible lack of human NPCs (this one is personal).
---
Thanks anyway, no worries
---
Australian also...never heard Sprite Cranberry.
---
You wouldn't happen to still have this would you?
---
Where in hell did you get this made up theroy you brotherhood wannabe
---
I’m about to go try! LOL
---
Totally agreed. I found myself playing less and less because i have most of the stuff i need and thanks to the caps and stash limit the hoarder in me wants to quit
---
im i f\*cking dumbass i forgot to connect my generator to my power connector xD im sorry
---
All good it happens.
---
I *am* saying it needs to be a higher yield, my guy. Using the exact example you mentioned as precedence.
---
Also, doesn't the 50Cal receiver lower the damage?
---
I only lock my water purifiers because i need every single one I can get haha

Yeah this has been their technology since Morrowind 2002.

Pepperoni and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives?

I wish more people would carry them. Endangerol is soooo good.

---
Actually a working automated ATM system fits perfectly into the context. I’ve spoken with a BOA banker the other day, she told me they are going full automated system and will be shutting down most branches. Their competitors are even quicker in the game.
---
get cucked
---
I am forever throwing away infinite amounts of shit that is entirely useful, just because my stash is full, only for me to need it a few hours later when I run out . . .
---
“The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone” lulz
---
The biggest problem seems to be people lack or inability to read. The game tells you you can’t hurt it while it’s in stealth. Yet people always bring their explosive something and blast IT instead of the gutsy or eyebombs.
---
Well we do have Captain Ironsides but that's 4 not 76
---
And once you drink it you get the recipe....because we are intelligent!
---
I know this is not personally your responsibility to fix, but seriously, how is it possible this has not been addressed after several days? The only thing I can gather is that Bethesda stands to make marginally more money if they give away fewer atoms, so they are not prioritizing this. I guarantee if it were costing Bethesda money, it would have been fixed on the first day.
---
I appreciate the replies and everything you do. I've worked in customer support so I am aware it's difficult to be a mouthpiece when you have no control over what your company does. But this is a really terrible look and this particular response does nothing to persuade me that Bethesda is serious about fixing what I consider to be a glaring and major issue. If we don't get some type of compensation for this, it will be the last straw for many people.
---
I'm disappointed the deathclaw gauntlets good but there aren't any pistols
---
You. I like you.
---
Yeah, 94 Million Deaths good.
---
Didn't say i wouldn't be (very much enjoying my gold gun),  it is just indicative of a larger problem.
---
Well, you COULD fill a house full of guns.
---
Doesn't help that they're one of the most resource intensive things to craft in the game, even with perks, and I've gotten ONE to drop in the hundreds of hours I played.
---
OH yeah, lick between the Ultracite.
---
I always loves building the vault in 4 this could be a small replacement.
---
Wait 4 real?  They found ES3 code? That's insane, also shows how good ES3 was back then but also how cheap Bethesda are now
---
Hell I would settle for just the adds from fallout 1
---
Void is a weeb
---
Im not surprised it's just funny
---
Lever action reloads all rounds no matter if quad or double. 
---
Even with the reload bug fixed.  You can. Sit there and load all 20 rounds with quad effect.
---
Yeah I agree, I don't need more stash space as much as I need my rifles to not weigh unrealistically large amounts
---
Thank you :)
---
They could have done this at any time. It is jist creating a new space in the world.
---
1000 would be great if they reduced the number of players in each server to compensate I wouldn’t mind that. 
---
Or even have a stash that you and people in your team can share where we can all put Ammo, plans, and aid in would be helpful to reducing the amount I carry around as well.
---
I found a normal deathclaw gauntlet at the sons of dane compound on one of the tables by the banjo - I believe you also get one as one of the quest rewards during the bunker quests.
---
Needed for some PA maintenance.
---
I wish we could do this
---
I’ve done that before. Lol
---
Ah, that did it!
---
Welcome to the magical world of gunfight, only in fallout. When you put on this unicorn armor, stand still or hop like a bunny, Bethesda will make you unkillable to most players.

Sheepsquatch!
---
Please make this happen Bethesda, I need to eradicate communism and channeling my inner Liberty Prime is the only way.
---
I'm a giant noob at crafting, so I'm not clear on what Bulk stuff does. I've always just made them and scapped them thinking that I was getting the number of X back? That and I tried to sell bulk steel like someone suggested to me and I got peanuts, so I've never known what to do with them.
---
I’m not going to sit and argue with a bunch of people that more than likely have no background in coding. I’ve built my own games. People like to think they’re always right and you can’t change that.
---
Everybody not happy with items from the Atomic Shop should immediately write a Support Ticket, asking for a refund due to lack of quality.
---
In this day and age, we vote with our wallet and this might be the only language these corporations actually do understand... more than anything else.
---
I need low level only
---
Oh god, now it's just like when you try spawn a building in via debug menu in C:DDA. But worse!
---
Change it back!
---
June seems a little far away
---
Eggsellent!
---
Glad you posted this, OP.  [Adding it to my collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgrv5/items_are_disappearing_from/) (I mean that respectfully).  Another person posted about this today, and others have before and after I did. No confirmation, fixes or restoral process from BGS. That's a loud message and not a good one.
---
wait i have another question how do i turn it on, on the second story floor that isnt working for some reason
---
Communist detected on American soil
---
Chalk for asbestos u run marine armour, which I do a full set of sentinal assassin. So im putting my armour under huge amounts of stress pretty much all the time so I need tons of the stuff.  Like 30-40 each repair which happens each 2-3 long fights. Coal on the other hand is only useful for making scaly skin serumes
---
I mean bethesda ruined survival incentives, it’s not my fault
---
Except a two-shot fatman followed by a nuclear football
---
Oh sorry
---
I think we've all been there at some point.  Sorry bro/bro-ette
---
Bug that happens sometimes
---
Dude I would chuck mini nukes in fissures all day long
---
I dunno there's at least perks for it. Try making railway rifles @ 16 screws a pop and then come talk about resource intensive crafting
---
Your information is faulty it's kill the SBQ and 100 ghouls using only a gamma gun
---
Uncle Sam thanks you for your service
---
Yeah, sadly seems so 😑
---
Do you want to join me?
---
Sorry to double post at you, but I just noticed something. At the 0:19 second mark, when the switch happens, the corpse label changes from Legendary Ghoul to Ash Pile. As soon as that change happens, the loot changes too, and the 'transfer' button is no longer grayed out. That's actually why I didn't pick up the loot right away, I like to use the transfer screen so I can examine the legendary effects.
---
I definitely won't be killing legendaries with any guns that transform the remains (plasma, laser, tesla) until I see some patch notes about a fix.
---
Well at this point of evolution in computer power, that illusion is achieved pretty damn well. Most of us know that random isn't really random in games and computers in general.
---
You can buy Nuka Dark from Bubbles in the Whitesprings. She's on the floor above the other trader bots.
---
Take a right when entering the front door and then a left into the small room with pink walls.
---
That should be the backpack for power armor
---
I want more budget on top of stash. I have to constantly taje things outta camp for new stuff in the atom shop. This is gonna get worse of we're able to decorate with items from the stash.
---
I've found Marine Armor under-performs nearly anything else at equivalent levels, which is sad considering you can't craft it.
---
Fire as fuck
---
That what I'm saying, they can't use that excuse because it's already in the game with a different ammo. And I said the .50 cal hunting rifle is supposed to be the high-end mod but there isn't a hardened .50 cal so it's not even that good
---
I would prefer a fair system, not just to increase stash for all but to make it possible to raise it when you build additional Stash Boxes in your camp. People would have to think about if they want to sacrifice CAMP Budget for Stash Space.
---
Must be right balanced.
---
I can't remember where I read it but it is going to work similarly to how the fermenter works where you activate items in your stash. This will allow you to show your wares but not have some shmuck with sticky fingers be able to just grab the weapon and run.
---
I can see it already. Stash space extenders! Already in atom shop! Only 2000 atoms for 100 pounds!
---
Well I certainly hope so!
---
I've no explanation.
---
Run connectors up the side of the house and connect the cables
---
I play on ps4. NFI what you are talking about.
---
bUt If yOu nUke iT it'S bEtTeR
---
This is what I know because it has happened to me personally.
---
You used to could buy them from Harpers Ferry and BoS robot in Watoga. I haven't seen them there since they normalized the inventory though.
---
You can learn them from scrapping. Stupid hard to do though (and this was before they nerfed the learn chance).
---
Any place that can spawn combat armor plans can also spawn the mod plans.
---
I do know at one point Bethesda was "looking into it", but that was more than a month ago, and still no response.
---
yeah ive done that but it still gives no power to the floors
---
No loot or no good loot? It’s 100% normal to get shitty loot.
---
I know morningwood and she’s helps players whenever she can. Love to play with her...
---
800 is ok
---
Decided to boot it up again today while doing laundry. Been a spinning wheel on the Atom shop for an hour now.
---
This this this!!!! 🤞🙏
---
That was the design intent, we are supposed to be filling the gap.
---
I've got a few pieces that say cavalier in their name
---
Well that guy had a pretty good test going
---
Gt: blacktiger7001
---
I'm a collector in fallout games. I need one of everything. I also collect junk to sell. I cant do both on one character.
---
&gt; The harder part is finding a radstorm *unless you’re on the game all the time*
---
Yea, no. I played since release and over 600 hours, I've seen 3-4 of them. Some people have seen less than that. You can play as much as you want, and almost never encountered it. The chances of finding one on the exact day of a challenge is basically astronomical.
---
Gt is blacktiger7001
---
How about this idea. They could lower the weight of items to help us out. I mean come on, that would fix alot. You need stable flux and the ingredients to make them but they are way heavy.
---
I feel like we're saying the same thing but not understanding the other person lol.
---
Beth should revise the Whitesprings jewelry store that already exists and have it sell bling for really high prices. It would be a caps sponge for the same kind of people that buy Rolexes IRL. It would help with the overly-capped problem.
---
I think it is because the menu on the pipboy is skipping around. You think you have one thing selected but the bar skips at the past second and selects something seemingly at random.
---
I dropped a daisy cutter on the ground on accident during a SBQ fight like this on accident and if someone hadn't been nice enough to ask who dropped it I would permanently have lost it.
---
Yeah but all melee builds need Martial Artist 100%
---
during a rad storm
---
Funny thing is.... none of the picture challenges even work lol. I tried to do a challenge where I had to take a photo of player above level 50... never worked
---
yes
---
Wowza!!1 I wonder what amazing LOOT he got from clearing the Burrows at such a low level!
---
I was disappointed we didn’t get a new mob.
---
What do you have on the floor that needs power? I've only ever had to use the connectors on the outer walls/roof.
---
I meannn it is a challenge I suppose
---
There's no reason for you to ever take a workshop. You don't have to, it's not necessary, there's little incentive besides the take/defend quests
---
Executioner is nice to deal with bloodied builds. I'd pay good caps for an executioner gamma gun or fat man.
---
I have enough junk to last me a whole year of mods.
---
I need to get back over there. Those boys throw awesome parties!
---
Hush you S'wit!
---
This isn't just 99% impossible. All these 'take a picture' challenges are currently impossible as the improved Camera has been delayed. Yet, they are too lazy to update the daily and weekly challenges. Real good.
---
Teslas can still drop with explosive huh, did not know that. I thought it was removed from all energy weapons.
---
Do you have advanced connectors
---
 "800 is plenty space, just get better at weight management"
---
You play a wood elf in fallout 76?
---
Well, the cap limit is limitless in actuality. You can have 5 characters with 25k, adding up to 125k, and then multiple accounts at 125k each. If you level those characters on those accounts to about level 9, where they can have 9 charisma and hard bargain 3, you could easily be raking in 25k a day if you had enough serums to sell.
---
You could feasibly get millions of caps, or max out your character in one day, and in a few weeks, you’ll have 1 million.
---
Good thread.
---
But while you're doing that in the next patch is there any chance you can fix molotov cocktails to work with **any bottle** instead of just **beer** bottles? Thankz &lt;3
---
Depends on what animal you want, where it will spawn at your camp, and what you are lucky enough to run into.
---
I can’t have anything too big, because at my current camp the animals spawn inside my home for some reason (usually they patrol around the perimeter). I initially had a Megasloth that was far too large for my house. You won’t know where it spawns in until after it arrives at your camp and you reload the server.
---
Be aware that the animal has to walk all the way to your camp from the spot you tamed it, so it’s possible for them to die on the way. They have a better chance of survival if you tame something tough (like Kings, Deathclaws, Megasloths), or find a spot close to your camp.
---
Cranberry Glade is a good place to hunt for a tameable animal, and there is a second spot to the right of there. There is a spot by treetops that I’ve had luck with (got the Sloth and a Deathclaw there). Fast travel there, then turn around and walk forward until you see a bridge. The spawns usually appear under it, though sometimes they are past it a bit. There is also a spot by a lake with a crashed Vertibot far north of Abbie’s Bunker. If all else fails, people have created maps of random encounter locations that you could look up for reference.
---
Oh thank the lord for that. I thought I was doing something wrong this whole time. Fml.
---
at least scrap it for lead
---
Clearly says .44. Clearly shows the gun.
---
You sir, make my point for me. Thank you.
---
Compulsive hoarder of cool stuff here.
---
I need more space for cool guns and cool outfits. I tried getting rid of excess junk but it did not help. I need more space
---
Man, that is more than generous of you. I sent you a DM, he’s in Thailand for the next 1 1/2 weeks, I’ll be back online on monday. Let’s talk again on monday and if you’re looking for something in particular yourself, let me know. Maybe I can help you in return!
---
My hunch was that they were Vault Tec. Note at the airport saying the current leader was insistent on the creation of the odd terminals in Flatwoods as they were "expecting a large amount of people". The "first responders" after the bombs fell completely ignoring the provisional Charleston government and taking charge of everything.
---
Anything alated to commies would be interesting though, considering the rest of the communist lore in game is straight manufactured in order to raise the threat level for nukes. Anything legitimate communist stuff beyond maybe Free States would be news to me.
---
Yep.  There is a ton of stuff you manipulate/use in the world.  Not just you, your stash, and your camp.  Many MMOs force many more inventory decisions than fallout.  Even the brand new ones.
---
Adhesive isn't tough to get once you have a appropriate farm (preferably 4 or 5) malfruit corn tatos finally bunch of purified water earned by quests/purity generators. Add a duper level 3 now your set. Just don't forget green thumb that's the most important. Adhesive is too thin to find naturally alternatively killing anglers gives it also.
---
Cool do you have one
---
I understand your point. It's not the ATM machines themselves that would be infeasible, it would be the transaction network and clearing entity to connect and run them. 
---
But I see the original poster's point as well. In a world where blue chests are magically linked to one another, the lore problem is pretty much moot.
---
Only thing that need to change is the respawn inside cell after death. FO76 loadings are not the best experience in the game and having to load the map again, then the cell again could sometimes be pretty alienating.
---
Arthur Maxson's Brotherhood is very close to the West Coast (Original) Brotherhood.
---
10,000 caps for 20 atoms!
---
Sounds of entitlement
---
how would they go about making that balance? you cant really let players own a workshop indefinitely until they log off the server, and of course someone who is several levels above the player is going to have a competitive advantage.  Are you suggesting that all damage needs to be scaled so everything is just as fair as a newcomer as someone who has shed hundreds of hours?  People who have spent hundreds of hours gathering and farming materials to make/find that perfect rifle for pvp should be punished and have their damage nerfed because a level 30 took that workshop?  If they really want to balance, they'll have to implement timers to workshops so everyone can play "fairly," which of course is counter intuitive because workshops operate off a timer.  The system is fine as it is.  Dont like workshop pvp? build your camp near resources.
---
Less folks running the queen I haven't seen a nuked queen in atleast a week
---
That's exactly what I do, but still...
---
Mama Dulce's terminals were manufactured?
---
Table lamps because they Are on dressers and stuff
---
now i might not throw away all my mini nukes
---
Thats a 50 year old virgin living at his moms house beating his dick all day
---
I'm having fun.
---
.. just me maybe.
---
True. If it hadn't have made me get stuck in a loading screen, I probably would have made it back in time
---
That is true, so fine, the Lyons Brotherhood will always be the best ha
---
I gotta have time to work everything out. I'm building a sweet arena, giving away a 25k cap prize, organizing 16 fighters, vendors, streaming (since only 25 people per world) so folks can watch, etc. I want to make it really cool and really memorable, so I'm gonna take my time with it.  
---
I want it to be a really fun event for the community. Not some rushed slop job that people are like "eh...it was okay" you know?
---
Vendors rip you off but do it to relieve you of not needed items.
---
Omg yasss it needs to happen. Going to put one in my CAMP this evening.
---
Saw this and it was fanfreakin'tastic!!!
---
OP AM is not a pve server. This is not a strictly pve game.
---
Easiest 'legit' way is the Advanced power connectors you can buy from a vendor.
---
Easiest way (cheesiest way) with the base stuff? Place a connector on one side of the wall and then replace the wall with a door, the connector will be floating in the doorway and you can move it into the inner room and place it where you need to.
---
Then just change the doorway back to a wall the wire will be phased through the wall but still generating power. Then connect from the now inner connector to the rest of you inside stuff.
---
Dogwoor water filters
---
Everyone wants the Easter Eggs, dude ...... so  they're comingon to play and well ..... I know what you mean, I got dropped multiple times too
---
Ye apparently that's not allowed lol we have to come up with and essay on why we like it whenever we tell anyone lol
---
Now you’re talkin!
---
Same universe daaawg
---
The dungeon was definetly in preparation for the legendary vendor. 
---
I wouldnt be suprised if the next few additions to gameplay are harder than the ones we have received simply because the legendary vendor will probably make them more avalible on a global scale.
---
What about other players radios like you could be a radio host
---
Yea, Don't care.  I'm just talking to the wind.  Have a good one.  Goodbye.
---
The advance power connectors or conduits have wall passthrough cabling that allows wiring inside and out.
---
Do all those other games allow you to craft with items directly from your stash or do you have to remove them and have them on your person?
---
Someone from Bethesda mentioned the limit was because the game has to track your inventory constantly since we can use any crafting station anywhere and have it access our stashed items.
---
If we had unlimited stash but you had to remove any needed crafting item before using any workbench would people be ok with that?
---
Could have sworn the connectors still worked for those. Going to have to experiment now.
---
That is fantastic info! I have the Good Doggy perk so it only takes 2-3 dog food to fill my bar, but if I had ionized meat that would make life a ton easier. I usually carry around glowing meat steak and Yao guai ribs for the extra %20 percent melee dmg, but if the ionized meat has health benefits that good I’m definitely going to add that to the inventory and getting the mutation at that point would help a ton.
---
Also a LOL emote 😅
---
They weren't counting on how awkward and antisocial many fallout players are (def including me)! I've actively avoided other players at times, and am rarely comfortable interacting with them. I'm trying to be better with it but it's still difficult.
---
I like it as well. Legendary drops suck, but its nice to have a new xp farm.
---
taking a workshop doesnt give a waiver saying "if somebody wants to take your workshop, they must let you prepare first." you shouldnt expect complete strangers to hold any honor.
---
I really want bulldoze to do what it was advertised as when they first mentioned it. We should be able to pick items and choose to remove them from the camp area completely.
---
Yeah, I've had that before. I got to the queen but saw the loot disappear item by item like if the person next to me was looting it from under me... I think there's some bug where if two people get to a body simultaneously, the loot is suddenly "shared" rather than instanced. I now try to make sure I get to her as quickly as possible then mash the "take all" button.
---
Meh. I must be playing a different game. I've been having a fun time and they keep adding more stuff that's fun.
---
Good point, the time I’d be low Heath would be mere seconds compared to pretty much all the time being at near max health. Especially with the healing factor mutation I have.
---
Fuuuuu....I can only HOPE.
---
No just 30 or 40 at 5k each lol
---
I’ve been wondering this same thing. I haven’t seen an active sheepsquatch event in a week and I don’t really like server hopping in XB1. It takes too long to load in, and with the ten minute time limit to the event it seems really unlikely you will land in a server with one going or about to start. 
---
It would be way easier if there was a way for people to organize for it
---
Hey im online whenever you are ready
---
Definitely! I will he on in a lil bit
---
Msg me on XB1 - my gt is N 3 1 L 5 0 N (letters, spaces and numbers)
---
I’m not sure direct messages are getting through here, or at least via the mobile app 🤷🏻‍♂️👍
---
The game has a future, but how bright it is depends on Bethesda's ability to reach out to Zenimax Online and start learning all the lessons ESO already did
---
Gonna need your GT man
---
there's a long orange-red bridge north of Top of the World on the train tracks
---
I guess I didn’t realize there were level caps on plans
---
Yeah, I agree, but I just don't see it.  They'd basically need to double the main quest, or drop the longest DLC they've ever done.  The world is well done and the system seems to get better every week, so IMO it would be worth it, but I doubt they will ever do anything that big for 'free'.
---
Yeah definitely
---
Oneeyedcole
---
Power Radiator gives off a radius similar to Large Pylons—-just clip the open end back inside, attach Power Radiator and done.
---
I think 1000 would be the sweet spot for stash space.
---
I take workshops every time I play. Owned or not, sometimes I win. Other times I lose, that’s the nature of an online game. Play fallout 4 if you can handle conflict with other players. Also, leaving your resources unlocked goes a long way. I usually don’t take a workshop over if I can just grab some junk and go. And remember that if you are lower level, you are a small fish in a very big pond. A well spec-d level 150 with crazy weapons and armour is going to be extremely difficult to kill. Don’t waste your caps, just leave......
---
Quit your whining. Jesus.
---
Dm
---
Yeah, unlikely but since it’s probably still in preproduction, we can only try and help them along
---
I sure hope they fix it in next week's patch. Irritating to luck out on possible Atoms because *someone* didn't have a plan B for challenges with the new Camera delayed.
---
There isn't.
---
what system u on?
---
will report back to confirm after im done surrounding a strangers camp in spike trap catapults
---
I got mine around level 20 from the super mutant vendor whose name I can't recall.
---
I've seen the recipe, what are those?
---
So, I assume if I make everything Standard again, it would be fine?
---
Now i know its not the same, but theres loads of locked rooms at the whitesprings that looks almost like bethesda intended for them to be personal player homes possibly similar to what you saying here, i think i counted 18 of the bungalows so it wouldnt be too much of a stretch to add a few more and give everyone access to one when they log into a server and have it an instanced player home
---
Radio is global I believe.
---
Bethesda you guys need to watch and learn here for real!
---
yes it should go back
---
Endangerol is great, but does it actually work on robots?
---

---
Its funny watching new players looking at me shooting the paper bag like "dafuq" 🤔
---
Well that’s not very nice
---
It could also show the “What makes you S.P.E.C.I.A.L” videos from Fo4 and the vault tec videos from Fo76
---
Invest in strength and melee.
---
You are correct
---
You forgot to start, "Dear Bethesda..."
---
i think the enclave vendor sells it
---
I'm really glad they skipped instanced building, it would be a very boring game if it was.
---
I found a 3 star handmade the other day with 90% less weight, thing weighs like 4 pounds and it’s beautiful.
---
Indeed. You would be supprised how many people don't understand how computers work at all. Even in this day and age. The moment a computer can truly do anything at random is the day AI is born.
---
That's actually one of the caratristics of the test for a true AI
---
Do the power plant events. They drop generator plans.
---
radio: yes
---
servers are not constant, game will attempt to place your CAMP back where it was on the next server, but if it can't, you will get to move it for free.   Personally, I build my CAMP with only one point of contact with the ground, so it can go almost anywhere.
---
Your friends can't build on your camp, but they can build theirs next to yours, and you can use each other's crafting tables.  When they log off, their camp disappears, even if  you're using it.
---
Awesome, I didn't realize either of those- thank you!
---
I too would have interest in this.
---
Upvote this person if you agree!
---
Time to crawl out of that shell and make friends with your equally socially awkward fallout players! 
---
I mean there are definitely douchebags playing but the vast majority here are in the same boat as you.
---
Maybe come up with some stash box mods?
---
Weapons take 80% space, Chems take 50%, etc..
---
Servers are not constant. If your camp clashes with another player's the game will let you chose to stay without your camp or try another server when you load in. Team mates can build in your camp, but they must be on your team, not just friends.
---
Do bloodied weapons go for this much? I’ve got a couple sat in my stash, think ones a crossbow lol. I’ll have to dig them out now.
---
Thanks for the advice and info.. noted.
---
That was fixed [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejlcj/fallout_76_january_10_patch_notes/)
---
Limited infinite is what they should go far. Like basic scrapped materials should be infinite. There's no way they could do true infintie though because there's probably millions of different possible items listings (each weapon x each unique combination of mods (which includes atom shop skins) x each possibility for max durability x each possibility for current durability, and that's just weapons)
---
Yes. Per person.
---
I think the outcasts would (rightfully) disagree
---
Thanks.. I appreciate it!
---
I server hop as soon as I get the notification. The people who attack camps like this are typically decked out in gear and perks that makes attacking them back essentially gifting them caps and whatever junk you might be carrying. It’s just a broken and unbalanced part of the game, so if they’re going to do it to you, just rob them of the pleasure. 
---
I actually sympathize with people who want to play as raiders, if they’re going to be a sport about it. But unfortunately the game isn’t conducive to that kind of play.
---
What sucks is that there are plenty of people who put the camp there purely for a free spawn point near WS and for people to check out what they’ve created, myself included. I’ve seen some cool buildings there, I saw an awesome restaurant just the other day, that were clearly not a turret base. Just make the back area directly behind the golf club a no camp zone. That would solve 90% of the problems.
---
The watoga train vender is where I got mine.
---
Give me 5 less players in a server for 200 lbs more of stash space. Tell me that won’t work, Bethesda.
---
200 lbs is 90.8 kg
---
Back in my day it was 200 pounds
---
Like even Fallout 4 (and Skyrim, and Oblivion, and Fallout NV, and Fallout 3, basically all of Bethesda's TES/Fallout games) had problems with items storage. They just don't know how to do a good system for it.
---
I remember Oblivion was the worst though. That game would actually make me think the Xbox 360 locked up when I scrolled through my main stash.
---
I think it's fine.  It's just that you're bound to get your butt kicked the first couple times before you realize what's going on.
---
The way I approach it is to first put all my junk in the stash.  Death is pretty likely no matter how careful you are.
---
Then I go for Action Girl, Marathoner and Dead Man Sprinting in Agility and Field Surgeon in Charisma.  Between those perks, I can generally take pylons and play keep-away, running laps around the arena and taking pot shots at the Sheepsquatch when I see her going after someone else.
---
My discord is Weazmeister#6954 add me
---
Go down to the crandberry bog, equip green thumb, and loot as many pitcher plants as you can find. Their goo is 4 adhesive each. You'll get even more from them if it's a verdant season.
---
Then you cut out a major portion of the game and it dies.... people already don’t take workshops out of fear. 
---
If you want to shoot someone and feel good about yourself go to survival, if you want to build and play well with others, adventure.
---
Still?
---
No problemo. Its kinda a super secret, since its never brought up in game. But int boosts xp gain. So if youre looking for quick leveling keep that in mind.
---
Yesterday i had a player message me to let me know he found a flaw in my defenses at Sunshine Meadows and i thought wow, that was super nice of him to do that. I sent him a message back saying there is no flaw, the defenses are ment to keep out the a.i. and that the food is for everyone to take freely.
---
 There are alot more helpful people out there than i think alot of people realize. Ive had a couple of bad encounters but the good ones far outway those.
---
See you next month when the all the niggles ruin your fun.
---
I don't see why there would be a problem in next weeks challenges as they will be brand new and these will be gone.
---
&gt; track your inventory constantly since we can use any crafting station anywhere and have it access our stashed items.
---
Is that really true? For me it only seems like it counts items in a stash if the bench is near it. Like if I access a bench in the middle of some building or mine it only shows materials I actually have on me.
---
Go to your settings and switch on pacifist straight away. You don't want to accidentially shoot someone and end up in PvP. 
---
Do power station events to get generator plans.
---
If I player is acting weird, jumping up and down, throwing random emotes at you, turning their light on or off etc. Look on the floor for a paper bag as they will often be trying to gift you useful plans, ammo, weapons or just some food and stim packs. People in this game are much friendlier than you will be used to on most online games.
---
If a player does initiate PvP with you and you have pacifist on, you won't take any damage which helps but does not totally stop griefing. Until they release a planned update, a player can still trash your camp so be wary of random invites to join a team as some use it to locate your camp so they can leave the team and trash it.
---
The above said, lots of people like to help you level up so offer you to team for that so sometimes it's worth the risk - If they start trashing, just block the player and leave the world ASAP.
---
When in a team, get at least one shot on each enemy and your friend will kill them. This allows you to get max XP and loot from each with little risk to you.
---
Workshops are very useful but taking one does open you up to PvP even with pacifist on so again weigh the risks. All you lose is your junk if you die so scrap at a workbench and store at your stash box regularly. Your stash box can be accessed from other camps as well as train stations so it's not just at your camp.
---
Hope this helps and you have fun in the game.
---
Definitely not, having to constantly run back and forth between your stash to make items would be very annoying
---
No idea then
---
Yes the people I've met are cool but in the wrong time zones for regular play, and I have no interest  in playing with the little kids who have no problem with chasing people around until you switch worlds. I can't seem to find sensible adults in my time zone and I seem to be incapable of starting a convo myself. *sigh* I am trying to think of it as therapy but that doesn't help much. But I'll keep trying!
---
I managed to find a Mirelurk Hunter and it successfully made it to my camp, but it disappeared when I started up the game again. Not sure what happened there, as I’ve been taming for quite some time, and this is the first animal that’s just up and vanished on me.
---
...So I’m still searching for a replacement.
---
Put it this way: This is a game created by Bethesda. They decide what is PvE and what is PvP. Launch version of Fallout 76 mixed the two with some interesting results Bethesda could use when advancing their game to something better today than yesterday. 
---
Now we 'Survival Mode' and what is a clear campaign by Bethesda to redefine the boundaries between PvE and PvP to improve the experience for both sets of players. ***To think that a new PvP-exclusive mode was created specifically to preserve the original Adventure Mode experience is living in denial.*** I challenge any pvp-er to succesfully argue against that. Waiting...
---
Interesting, I wouldn't have thought that.
---
There's another thread of this. One of the Bethesda reps said that it may soon be a rad storm OR a nuked area.
---
Quad Single-Action Revolver is a lesson in patience lol
---
I think it would help if they upgraded their servers. Makes you wonder a bit about how much was/is invested in them when they have all these stipulations like not having a stash limit over 800, no more than 25 players on a server etc because of server balancing. I could well be wrong but..
---
I'd honestly be fine with the stash staying at 800 forever if we got a larger CAMP budget.
---
twins lakes in the savage divide is a good place. i’ve got a camp on the lake right across the street. i’ve been there about 5 days now. 12+ YG and if not YG then gulpers or honeybeasts. my team and i killed 5 legendaries there in a 30 hour period. it’s worth a look.
---
Thank you so much! Appreciate the help
---
They would, however for all their boastfulness, Lyons still obtained far more technology than the outcasts did, while helping the people. I think this should be the Brotherhood’s goals, however extremists push it too far. And the outcasts wouldn’t allow the lone wanderer to join its ranks when the Brotherhood back west did take in an outsider. I think all games showed a different Brotherhood with the same goal of keeping dangerous tech out of the hands of the wrong people to in the end help humanity, like project purity in Lyons’ case.
---
Opinions. Melee won't do anything if my tse dragon melts your face before you're close enough.
---
extremely lucky
---
Good bot, thank you bot.
---
the bos, whitespring and white powder jumpsuits always drop at the same time, but they’re the only rare outfits that do that. everything else is separate
---
I absolutely would make this tradeoff
---
Go watch his video from yesterday, he addressed a lot of the concerns and tbh I see his point (The homophobic quotes were from when he was in college, he says he regrets it and his views have since changed)
---
Yeah. I was testing with some people on a discord but since lost contact with them. Last test was on Queenie and we could place the %  she was reduced by but it seems each per person shot isn’t the full amount but fractioned down.
---
This would be cool. The main problem I see is that you wouldn't have any good views, and they're one of this game's strengths. But overall it would be awesome if we had instanced housing in general-- doesn't even have to be just bunkers, could be a home you click to enter like in FO4.
---
That said, they would likely charge us in some way for the separate server space or whatever.
---
well the fact you triggered both is lucky but no on the second one that is what happend on that if you get one you get them all for some reason
---
Where did you look this up?
---
Once obtained get pharmacist level 1 on it. What they do is simply either press 'craft' on food station there is a purified water option in there or if you square button any water source (toxic same effect as well) it will purify the water but sacrifice the filter for pure water.
---
four games as the lone wanderer. what did they expect?!
---
I'd like to shoot it with the vox syringer. Hear what she's thinking.
---
It's kind of like watching a Fallout game get developed, one quest at a time.  Sometimes it's difficult to appreciate the forest when all we see are new trees every couple weeks.
---
“The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone”
---
It would be great if there a weight reduction perk for rifles. Thanks to bear arms, I carry 4-6 heavy guns for less than 20 lbs, but I hesitate to pick up assault and combat rifles. There’s something for pistols, melee, and heavy guns, but nothing for rifles.
---
I would argue for the different weapon types for the ammo we can't sell.
---
Because we can't benefit from ammo other than using it, I collect one type of each weapon as well as unique weapons. In order to manage these as well as having resources, we do need the space.
---
To add, the weight is only going up with new weekly survival weapons.
---
The addition of survival mode does absolutely nothing to change AM. 
---
If Bethesda wanted to turn PVP off in AM they would have with the addition of SM, but they didn't did they?
---
I’m down.
---
I must say, I appreciate the forethought to the continuity. It all sounds legit. My only change would be X is likely the Overseer, and with actual people to direct in ‘New Cin’, we eventually have to help her get to some-heretofore-unmentioned Vault-Tec tech (G.E.C.K.?) in hopes of restoring Appalachia (her character seems very dedicated to her home; I don’t think it fits her MO to run.) 
---
Plus, even in Bad Holotape, she makes it a point to scold us, believing we’re better than to misuse the nukes. If anything, New Cin might be a call for aid, needing more people to help secure the other 4 Vaults in WV.
---
Enter us. We get to decide whether that help is robotic (Automaton) or human (Companion), locking in the choice for that character in regards to companions (easier to manage?) You may actually get both, but the upgraded, modded, perked-our versions are locked to either/or.
---
I’d also like to see a return of niche skins in this regard (like cyber-dog, Nuka paints, and custom companion ‘styles’, like Raider or Enclave). All of which would give End-game a whole other avenue to explore.
---
My thoughts. Take as you will.
---
That would be extremely helpful. So many times I’ve accidentally nearly blew someone’s head off when they run in front of me in White Springs. I’m sorry bro I thought you were a ghoul don’t kill me ;-;
---
Bos combat armor is awesome.
---
I feel its a sad commentary on the weight assigned rifles that one of the best legendary abilities a rifle main can hope for is 90% reduced weight.  They could have at least given us a damn weight reduction perk like every other weapon has available (I actually don't see the point in pistols having that perk at all either since 2 to 3 pistols are about the same weight as a single rifle without it).
---
?
---
r/monkeyspaw
---
Maybe?
---
Only if you cuck me first.
---
The only Gary I need to know is the pet slug from spongebob. And yes we need more from him
---
I can be of assistance.
---
Dude one of the coolest cats I have run into on a random was 11 years old :(
---
I misunderstood the effects of the Karma syringe and the first thing I shot with it was a scorchbeast behind the ATLAS observatory.  Rose immediately came on the radio and gave me props for being absolutely insane, and added that it was too bad i was about to die.  And die I did. But still one of the best moments of the game for me.
---
I hate this. I can’t see what the weight without perks would be.
---
How would you ever have someone visit your house?
---
lmao!
---
The first time I saw another player I turned around and ran the other way- I had actually forgotten it was mmo and he scared me!
---
Ever sort this out?  Same problem!
---
Psn?
---
thx, that I wanted to know :)
---
It is a grim future.  That's what happens in a nuclear wasteland.  And it obviously doesn't improve much over the next 200 years, based on what we see in FO4. 
---
Oh.. that's probably not what you meant is it?
---
&gt;and putting up a patch (particularly on consoles) isn't an easy or cheap thing to do
---
Well, that's THEIR problem, not ours.
---
Fallout 76, from the very get-go, has been designed and developed as a "games-as-a-service" kind of game - which means that it is going to be actively developed and maintained over a long period of time. This "service" entitles(!) us customers to be provided with regular updates, in order to have new features added to the game but also to have bugs monitored/fixed in a timely manner in order to ensure the integrity of the game. Because that's the very essence of this business model!
---
It was Bethesda who chose to go this route and thus it is Bethesda's job to make it work. Whatever it takes. That's what "service" means. They deliberately chose to release this type of game not only on PC (which would have been difficult enough) but also on consoles, being fully aware what this would mean (e.g. limitations due to different hardware, difficulty to apply urgent patches, the additional costs, etc). 
---
Imagine if you were going to the barber and the staff would be like: "Well, uh, it appears like all of our scissors and knives are dull and the electric razors are all out of juice. But don't worry. We're going to look into this and in two weeks we might have a solution."... if you can't provide a service like you said you would, then you need to get you sh\*t together or you'll have to step down and let others do the job. 
---
It's that simple, really.   
---
But don't expect your customers to be sympathetic for your own inaptitude!
---
What technology did Lyons obtain that the outcasts did not? I am not familiar with any records indicating he was more successful in this part of the mission than the outcasts.
---
I completely forgot about the other weight reduction perks for guns. It really screws you over with a rifle build. I usually only carry one rifle, sometimes two, and nothing else because they’re always in excess of 15-20 pounds and I don’t want to waste 1/5 of my carry weight on two or three different guns. Hopefully it’s something they can add in
---
Or let us store drugs on the Chemistry Station, guns and ammo on the Weapons workbench, PA/PA pieces on the Power armor station and armor pieces on the Armor workbench. This with 400 of space on every crafting table.
---
Elder Scrolls Online, made by Bethesda, has unlimited crafting storage that is accessible anywhere, be it actually stored on character or in bank.
---
The situation is unjustifiable, under this light.
---
I have a feeling that Creation tracks each individual item, regardless of whether it's in a stack of 1000, or a minigun. They need to transition to certain items (basically anything that can stack) is just an item in the inventory that has a stack count, so you are storing one integer for Copper Scrap, even if you have 1000 of it, instead of storing 1000 copper scrap items in inventory.
---
K tell me when
---
2+ months of that fuck up and they still haven't fixed it
---
I'd love to get harassed every one in a while. You up for it?
---
I use the heart emote. Works most the time.
---
I mean, realism has never been a thing in Fallout games, just think about the .50 receiver doing less damage than a .308 receiver when the difference between the two irl is [this](https://i.imgur.com/hPMDrtq.jpg).
---
The ones I've met have not been cool. One tried to instigate pvp by accusing me of bullying his friend, but it sounded like he was reading a script (and I've never bullied anyone in my life). It's good to know the are some good kids on there.
---
it does.  what planet you on?
---
Welcome home bitches lol
---
What daily quests are new? If you mean the camera related stuff, we can't do those.
---
They have two junk types - Autoscrap items which scrap with scrap all and when you need the scrap type to make the item and Safescrap which only scraps if you specifically ask it to. Mods and a few other things like hardened mass are Safescrap. 
---
Safescrap used to be usable if your were crafting something and bulk items used to be in that class, but it didn’t work out well for people who accidentally scrapped the X-01 Calibrated Shocks they just bought while making ammo.  So bulk items had to be moved out of Safescrap so they could be used for crafting. 
---
Essentially we’re waiting for them to build a new junk class Bulkscrap which will protect from scrap all but still let bulk items be scrapped for crafting. 
---
As it’s a QoL that would require work in a deeper level of the game it’s probably low priority compared to say, stability.
---
The event is fine and super easy once you learn the mechanics of the fight. We honestly need more like it.
---
I think it used to do this, except it also meant that bulked materials couldn't be used in crafting unless you un-bulked them, so they changed it.
---
They need to label it as "crafting material" like beer bottles or qssaultron head.
---
And Beth is silent on it
---
This, so much this
---
Why would I stash it?
---
The point I was making is that even if the camera was currently in the game, this particular challenge is completely asinine. With the camera, it's 99.9999999... impossible.
---
I already got that mount. Thanks though.
---
and check out this suck up!!  ha ha ha HA HA!!
---
Well for one they had Liberty Prime, which came with the Pentagon that Lyons orchestrated the capture of. He also helped get Project Purity up and running, as established to be canon.
---
Bulk goups thing for sale to vendors. Some people claim the weight savings is negligible but as an inveterate junk hound ( haven't been able to fast travel for like two weeks) it seems to  add up. When you scrap all it just breaks it back down to the component parts minus the two plastic ( this is a recent bug).
---
Tldr: bulk junk for sale and weight reduction.
---
You’re in luck, soldiers—our Discord is multi-platform, with multiple fireteams on each system. Come help the true effort to Rebuild America! 
---
https://discord.gg/SUqWXMb
---
We have casual, serious, and RP-types currently focused on task. All patriots welcome.
---
Or like they did in Grand theft Auto v, with the news camera. But this would be an eyebot instead of a chopper that was chasing you.
---
On the target practice section you can simply take whatever gun you want out on the course and shoot the targets from point blank range. The obstacle course is just a bitch and there's no way around it. For me the tight rope walk was the one that literally had me throwing expletives at my TV. With that one your best bet is to get as centered on the rope as possible and then run. The rest of the obstacles aren't too bad and as long as you don't waste too much time on the tight rope. You should have plenty of time to leisurely pass the rest. That quest is by far the worst in the game in my opinion.
---
Servers last about 12 hours before they stop allowing random joiners and eventually shut down to for maintenance, as far as I know. Basically, dont store stuff in random containers if you ever want to see it again - not only are they public, so other will be able to take the stuff you leave, but they are not persistant like in other single player fallout games, so will dissapear when the server eventually restarts
---
What I meant is that the fact of things not being truly random is in this case irrelevant, as you would start recognizing patterns only when performing an analysis on a scale so huge that to practical effects we can assume is random.
---
With a full set of Lvl45 Shrouded Wood armor and sneak perks, can crouch in front of the SBQ's face while landed, shoot into it, and still not be discovered
---
I would have asked who you bullied as it sounds like a mistake.
---
Even if it goes south think of it this way, your chances of interacting with that person again is minimal, and you got a little more xp in the dealing with people level :)
---
At least with melee you have weight reduction.  Rifles weigh a metric shit ton and there's no perk available to offset it like every other weapon class.
---
Very Interesting, and I have to agree, I definitely got overseers MO very wrong, she is very “homey”(idk if that’s a word, an i’m also a fan of your other ideas.
---
Click the challenge for specific objects: steel, springs, gears, concrete, fertilizer, wood, and glass are a few examples, but defiantely not the full list
---
Lmao I think the radiation has gone to your head 😂
---
Then his soul must be rotten. Lol
---
theyre dupers that are griefing my workshop.
---
I'm have the same issue after an update (that I can't go back on!) to Win 10 1809.  I'm not on a 2700, but a related 1900x Threadripper chip, and I'm wondering if our issues are related.
---
I find that performance takes a slight hit, but I have better stability if I go into task manager and set affinity to use only half the cores.
---
Beth support has said that they are working on bug to do with "high thread count" systems, though they didn't say AMD specifically.  I'd tried turning off SMT, but the performance hit was too great.  Strangely, 4 cores and 8 threads performs better than 8 cores/8 threads.  At least for me.
---
I'm only playing at 60Hz, with a 2080 Ti, 32gb RAM, and also a NVMe drive (Samsung 970).
---
I did see that the dumps from my hangs/crashes all say something about UI scaling.  Curious what your dump files say.  The game makes its own from time to time, and they're in the game folder, with a .dmp extension.
---
Did you ever sus out anything else about this issue?
---
So melee or shotgun it until about level 30 then start throwing points into the heavy perks?
---
I use the “help!” emote if they’re significantly higher level than me because it looks like I’m panicking that they might kill me lol.
---
I_ Was_Trying
---
I hope so too. Please update when you know!
---
I have a junkload of ammo it's at 6k bullets and I have also 6k 5mm bullets
---
Hey asshole, we have a right to be entitled, this is the ONLY non-monetary way to EARN atoms!  Some of us actually WORK for our points instead of buying them.  So yes, jackass, this is an issue for people who don't believe they should have to purchase something that was promised to us for free for completed challenges.  You're probably the entitled one, seeing as you most likely purchase all your cosmetics because that's all you have to spend your money on.  Some people prefer to not waste MORE money in this tragedy of a game!  They never reimbursed me for a shitty beta, or lack of content, so we shouldn't HAVE to pay for atoms!  I don't think dude is entitled at all to something promised to us by the company, dick!
---
This is a God damn stroke of genius! Really I like it.
---
Even making stuff affected by perks would be a plus.
---
Cool, a challenge run where a power-gamer does high level content with a low level character, those videos are always fun... oh wait, we're just shitting on the Burrows for being too easy again?
---
Weapon names are lost when you drop them
---
When the vendor comes tou can trade it to him I like it cause it barely weighs anything
---
Was just stating that I messaged you on Reddit. Some turn off message notifications.
---
I saw a Juicehead video the other day, discussing the Burrows, and the background gameplay had him doing a new daily quest I haven't heard of
---
Well, we (the PCs) had more to do with Project Purity than he did. And he also lost Liberty Prime in a questionable fight.
---
Or have legendary scout pieces, that should be the mid-high replacement
---
I just want a shared stash to use between characters
---
That's not really saying much, tbh. Source/Source 2 has iDTech1 (AKA Quake, 1996) code in it. Windows has had bugs from 17 years ago that were eventually patched.
---
Guided meditation gives all 3
---
This happened to me on the excavator power armor helmet. Walking around, then boom gone! Had to craft another one. Thought it was just me.
---
The more you play, the more you know what you need and the less you need space.
---
For now I tend to stash some \*\*\* legendaries for the future vendor/token.
---
I think this will free a lot of space then (but it's still in a month.)
---
Remember you can level on stat and choose a card elsewhere. You can just level strength and then pick relevant cards for your build in other states trees. Around lvl 30 I found a heavy gun I could afford the ammo for. I used what I could find until then.
---
You are totally the first person to mention this
---
Why not have a separate stash for different items, personally I would love to have a gun cabinet
---
All the perks that panda said earlier, but melee will get you through a while. Most of the low level perks are survival based anyway.
---
I hear that, and appreciate your effort. I had a similar idea a while ago but never got traction. Best of luck. I'd sign up to fight if your still looking for combatants.
---
You only have access to level-locked perks when spending the point gained at that level, not necessarily when your character is that level.
---
In other words, if you save up 10 points from level 21 to 30, you can't spend them all on level 30 perks; you'll only have access to level 21 perks, then 22, and on.
---
oh ok thanks
---
Thanks, we appreciate the effort.
---
It is entirely asinine. Just even worse it is 100% impossible, too.
---
That's fine imo, as long as they fix energy resistance not properly being ignored, because atm despite dealing more damage than the minigun, the minigun is more useful against heavily armored enemies.
---
I'm having a similar issue (so similar I'd say symptoms are an exact match), and my system shares 1809, RAM spec, AMD proc (1900x), and Samsung 970 series NVMe drive (Pro here).
---
Still having this issue?
---
If so, how does turning off the last eight threads affect the issue?
---
Full screen or windowed?  Has the game produced dump files? (check game folder)
---
I’ve had so many people in the last few weeks only attempt to take the workshop to kill me but not take it.
---
Few days ago, someone started taking Hemlock Holes while I was in Watoga. He didn’t fully take it but apparently it puts you in PvP across the map. He traveled to Watoga and continued to hunt me down once more before I just left the server.
---
A friend and I last weekend were playing dealing with an attack on Grafton Steel Yard, two guys show up with a 500 cap bounty, start claiming the workshop without us even noticing and killed as soon as the claim started. They didn’t even try to claim it.
---
I feel like you should have an option if someone wants to claim a workshop. Give me an option to let them have it instead of them taking it by force, I don’t know. I just don’t like the amount of trolling going on by these people who probably cant kill anything in survival.... so instead, they troll people who probably don’t want to PvP.
---
LIKE DEADASS B!!!
---
I could be wrong but I think I got like 5 mutations in an hour fighting ghouls in white springs...
---
They can combat this problem by making it to where you have to be further out to place homes on the golf course.
---
Because the post is about STASH limit. Why would I assume you're not talking about STASH?
---
Wanna buy mine?
---
Part of the core code, like cell based loading is from the ES 3 era. It’s one of the main problems within the creation engine. It’s a module of the engine that has no alternative and sorely needs removal and replacement.
---
They have actually made inroads into updating a lot of the engine, for example notice how almost all the assets in game are shockingly old school looking when close up? Well they’ve finally added a new module to the engine that allows “photo realism”, basically decent decals etc that mean graphics of the metro exodus level are going to be possible for future games. Whether or not this change was made in time for ES 6 or not, or star field, remains to be seen.
---
Even so, nice graphics doesn’t change the overall core architecture which causes the bugs, constant load screen requirements, that sort of caper.
---
Uh, no?
---
Various game engines still have code from their predecessors. The Source engine still has some code from Goldsrc which is a successor to the Quake engine.
---
that's not being lazy, especially since off-shoot engines are always being gutted and revamped. The Creation engine, despite having code from Gamebyro, is a vastly different beast in comparison since it supports things like more plugins, 64-bit support, godrays, better shaders, etc. Yes Creation is still not the "best" but its still a far cry from the outdated engine of Gamebyro.
---
This x1000
---
That's not even the reason we have limited stash space...
---
Touche
---
"A power-gamer" What does that even mean? Is he just so good at the game it statically alters his characters stats?
---
Hmm about as useless as I suspected late-game.
---
Purified water is pretty plentiful
---
Yeah, it's rough trying to keep decent legendaries for the vendor that hasn't happened yet, and still have room.
---
Can I join you?
---
2000
---
800 stash space with broken down scrap taking no space would be good with me.
---
In my experience playing since beta, 85-90% of the people playing this game are either incredibly nice or neutral. The others are not, but even then, you can often just ignore those types.
---
You'd be surprised at how often old code stays.  It's been working for YEARS, why not just keep using it if it's doing its job and meeting your requirements?
---
Hold on how are you level 60 again? I thought you mastered ranking up your cards by now plus you should outscaled the need to eat/drink by said perks.
---
Rad storm on top of a nuke zone*
---
Dont give them any ideas
---
I beat that survival mission in like 2-3 hours, super easy, there's horde missions for wolves and mirelurks, plenty of places with ONLY scortched, robots are at watoga and insects are EVERYWHERE!
---
Oh interesting. If you find out lemme know. :p
---
i have some mutations already so starched genes and class freak is a must have. because i play in a team i like to have the recipes so i can made the serum for all of us. sometimes, when i am i a good mute i give marsupial serum to others. it is one of my favorite mutation. just for the fun factor :)
---
Hover over the challenge, it will tell you.
---
Got it
---
You’re absolutely right, because if there was no workshop pvp then one person could claim an entire server with no recourse. However, there are still some issues with workshop pvp as is, and OP addressed some of them.
---
Basically, people are abusing the workshop pvp mechanics to kill people anywhere on the map, completely ignoring the actual workshop. It’s clearly not intended to work that way. 
---
You might say: “Don’t take workshops if you’re not ready to defend it/yourself”, and you’re right, but the issue is that it’s just not fun to stand around workshops waiting for pvp or the occasional defend event, because 90% of the time you’ll be doing nothing. 
---
But I think the biggest issue is actually that workshops generally aren’t worth holding when they have the downside of opening you to pvp anywhere on the map. As OP points out, the smartest thing to do is to get in, afk and hide till you get what you need, and then server hop. Which, as far as pvp goes, is super boring. And the people who aren’t smart or don’t know any better get preyed upon, which is also pretty boring pvp.
---
Again, I absolutely agree that adventure mode workshops need pvp, but I also agree with OP that it needs a rework. Not to make it easier for anyone, but to make it actually fun.
---
You can craft marine armour, and type of armour doesn't matter at high lvlz it's always about the effects and marine is the best sent/ass armour as its the one that can give a good amount of rad resistance against gamma guns
---
Yep I use any heavy weapon I see no scratch that I use EVERY weapon I get my hands on.
---
For the record, the ivory grip only applies to the bash damage based modifications. Also the reflex scope looks really odd with the pristine gold - I'm running it with just the iron sights as a result.
---
But still, not everybody has that perk or wants to spend the time doing the work, or has the water purifier. I have that stuff and to be honest, I’ve made a small amount of adhesive. I prefer searching. While it’s not an abundant resource by any stretch, it’s better than military grade tape or ammo bags! My god I wish there was a way of making that. I end up buying the stuff usually.
---
While there is a storm occurring near your most recently used billing address
---
We praise our glorious prophet and welcome his divine waters.
---
very nice. thanx for that info
---
They are not real. Just like birds are not real. Birds are government drones. When the government collapsed, birds disappeared. This is why we see no birds anymore. Follow the money.
---
I would have but he kept following me repeating the same line over and over, the same way each time - it sounded like his crew (there were at least 3 more on the map) decided to make the "role playing" more realistic but forgot to get a willing participant. But eventually I'll get a level up in "interacting with strangers outside of work" and it will be easier :D
---
Definitely! So far in the couple hours since I posted it, one person has signed up to fight. That's honestly more than I thought would come in the first day!   
---
Add me on PSN: apexigod (we'll talk about everything)
---
I can craft and make heavy BoS non legendary combat armour and pretty much every armour,  and for non legendary variants BoS heavy is the best, and for most legendary varients it is as well,  but if you find yourself running into gamma guns which most sent builds do marine is better
---
The weight issue is one of the reasons I stopped playing , it's 800 now? Not bad
---
Of course! I was eating dinner. But im in the silo and about to launch now
---
I can't say I agree with your reasoning.  A barber shop operates on a totally different business model, where you pay each time you use their service, and if they break all their equipment, you just don't pay them again and go elsewhere.  Fo76 is more like a lifetime membership to an amusement park, where you pay once and use it as much as you want.  And getting atoms for challenges is more like free passes to prize games at the park; it's not the main attraction, but it's a nice addition that people know and like.  If a few of those games are down for a while, it doesn't prevent you from enjoying the main park, and if you've been playing a while you've gotten way more value than your 1 time fee cost you.  If you haven't been playing a while, the daily and weekly bonuses are a tiny fraction of the atoms you're getting.  Either way, complaining that you're not getting enough free bonuses due to a temporary side effect of them adding even more value (for free) is pretty petty in my opinion.
---
One of the main reasons I stopped playing fallout 76 was because I was constantly having to micromanage my inventory and throw away valuable items all the time.
---
Why is it so damn hard to have unlimited stash space? Like, just have items stored as names (ex. "wood_junk") and then give it a numerical value (ex. "wood_junk:1000"). I don't understand why storing items and junk is technical issue.
---
Can u wait like 20 minutes? Pleeeeease?
---
The new change in vendors with the 1400 shared limit has been a god send. I went from struggling to sell to raking it in.
---
There'll be radstorms a-blowing,   
---
And ghouls will be glowing,   
---
When nuclear missiles are neeear...   
---
It's the most thirstiest time of the yeeear.
---
On a side note I can craft all pieces of combat marine etc armour and can mid with pretty much any mod including BoS for Combat
---
I came here to say this.
---
True fans still have a couple stored away in case of emergency throughout the year.
---
I would take it. I may not be on for a few hours though.
---
Hussein Bolt plays?
---
You also used "then" instead of "than"
---
It has gotten much better since launch
---
I want a quest that lets me build an instanced [sky mansion](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0nd7g/thoughts_i_had_while_exploring_the_mansion/) that takes over the location of the unfinshed one down by Garrahan Mining.
---
That wasn't your main issue yesterday. I know because I saw you throughout the whole thread mainly calling him a neck beard and homophobic.
---
Abusing the repot system was the thing you talked about the least. Guess you just latched onto the next thing to be enraged about since his video addressed all the things you were mad about yesterday.  Which, in my opinion, was the worse side of the situation.
---
If he does abuse the system it's NOT right at all and should be addressed but
---
you speak of those few hateful videos like they're the truth. 
---
Honestly no one knows what's true for sure except the random people on the Internet who made these claims, youtube and oxhorn. It mostly boils down to a he said she said situation.
---
It's obvious you're determined to be mad about something, which must be exhausting, so I'll cut this conversion here. I hope you get the truth you seek and have a good day.
---
Appreciate the offer but at the rate I'm going they'd be scrap in no time too!
---
It still has the occasional issue, but it's a LOT more stable.
---
No way. I want some more stash space, but not at that cost. 
---
Imagine running a silo or future vault raid and needing to repair your weapon, you find a workbench...but you lack the materials to make the repair because they’re in your stash and not in your character.
---
This is always my resource for Armor stats: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0
---
Scroll to the bottom for best gear.
---
I got mine at Whitesprings around level 25
---
now i know which perk cards i take at the next few level ups :) Never mind this perks until now
---
ahh assuming Bethesda are using such an intelligent program to govern it's legendary creature spawn. 
---
Considering FO76 is made using the Creation engine it would be safe to assume they are still using the same combination of "Encounter zone and the random encounter list" and perhaps a few others I can sort of recall from my modding days to populate legendary enemies. From what I remember it was a pretty simple task to set up a random encounter list from your list of NPC's using the percengage spawn variable and also linking the available loot drops with their own percentage drop variable. 
---
However don't forget that those lists had to be made and with the amount of potential items that can drop, not to mention all the sub loot lists. I would imagine these were made very early on and probably by junior members of the development team as it's very laborious work and pretty low level stuff. Changing the list could (and alreqdy has) caused some unexpected changes with other NPC enemies. 
---
For somone with more development experiance that me it would probably be a reasonable simple task to get the exact figures if they could get the appropriate data files...
---
Phew that was a  it longer than expected
---
They’re all updated, like I said duder I remember my first beer too. The only thing I need to update is my graphics card. But honestly it would be like throwing money away, mines less than a year old.
---
Idk what you’re talking about (;
---
I found a solution!
---
I had a junk node right near my building that appeared to be blocking building anything near it. I built a shed near to put the power generator and whatnot, then built the collector and that sorted it out.
---
It's more alarming that Bethesda couldn't manage to catch this in the first place before pushing the patch. This is basic as fuck.
---
The fact that you people still have any confidence in their abilities is why you won't be getting shit. You're already willing to accept mediocrity. 
---
I wouldn't give you anything were I Bethesda either. You'll play either way.
---
Noooooooo.
---
If you favorite them the game will give you a warning before it let's you scrap them.
---
I build toy stash towers. Now you can fit 500 in your budget you can get really creative.
---
Did it with a random group last night.  Nice replacement for Watoga. Make sure to clear the town 1st b4 going down.  Lots of flora2
---
I legit don't play this game cause of the stash weight. Lvl 92. Haven't played in four months. Bought the collectors edition with the helmet. Fix your damn game
---
But there is no in game economy. Whenever you go to trade with someone they will always just decline
---
I burned through the game (main quest line and much of the side content) at release, stopping around 45.  It was a lot of fun.  Worked through to 48 without power armor, doing remaining side quests and dailies, still so easy.  Maybe I’ll try removing all armor.
---
My cooking oil keeps getting scrapped from inside to stash. I wanted to make fasnacht donuts and I need the cooking oil to do it, but I just gave up LOL
---
It means someone who's deeply familiar with how the game works, and knows how to optimize their build and which strategies work the best. 90% of the player-base isn't going to casually walk into the Burrows at level 15 with power armor and wreck house like this.
---
I meant what I said, too. I love stuff like ManyATrueNerd's challenge runs in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, or all the no-hit runs people do for Dark Souls. I'd love to see something like a group of lvl20s do the Encryptid event and succeed. But I'm so over the complaints about the Burrows being too easy.
---
The real issue is weapon and armor weights. I know for damn shure that an AK does not weigh 25 pounds or that a fucking bolt action rifle weighs 22 pounds both of which weigh more than a damn civil war era gattling gun
---
I want to display my stuff. I lobed my displays of my collections in FO4. Legendary weapons hanging on the wall, bobble head collection, I had display cabinets for my toys I collected and magazine racks. He'll i even had a pool table with a full set of balls and cues.
---
Well damn. I'll be having dinner.
---
This is definitely a thing, I lost 3 TSE shotguns now and I was nowhere near a crafting bench....Just last week I was putting on my excavator PA and I noticed my bracer arms were missing. Getting really tired of having to make up for stupid bugs from devs....
---
What platform are you on, maybe someone could help you?
---
Yeah, it'd have to be bulked before being scrapped though, so that you couldn't get 1 lead per bullet.  'Cause that would generate lead by crafting and scrapping it.  So a new crafting option for Ammo Crates of each ammo type, which could be sold or scrapped!  Two birds with one stone.
---
Uh, did you read the title of the thread?:
---
&gt; I really don’t wanna grind the power plant even again.
---
Maybe for Jesus birthday party?
---
I’ll be on here in a minute, just getting home
---
I have a tse 3* 44. Might part with for tse 3* lever action.
---
Just give us 5,000 and be done with it.
---
Hey if you'll respond I'd like that Western revolver
---
Are you still around to play today?
---
I’ll try the no HUD idea.  I have a character only played in survival up to ten, running around in skivies and some random armor.  At first it was a bit exciting.  Maybe I’ll remove all my cards, too.  No HUD, no cards, and maybe no crafting unless required for a mission.
---
What system are you using I can give you a power armor chassis and some other things (xboxone)
---
Oh YEAH, I totally forgot about him. Gosh, I loved him. Okay, slight correction then; we have ALMOST no Sentry Bots with personality. I think Ironsides is the only one.
---
In previous games I spent more .32 than I ever fired
---
So I actually did decide to after reading that and it turns out they did refund me, rather quickly too. I'm used to online games never refunding cash shop items. 😗
---
I'm a level 7 character my psn is NotArtamus. I have a lvl68 but its build is horrible so im making a new character. I cant get on however until late sunday esrly monday
---
.... I'm aware what is the best gear but you need to understand that legendary effects matter more then the type of armour
---
Ok cool
---
Oh so the black trail comes from Mothman? Awesome, heard something in a bush and then heard a noise and saw a black trail into the sky wasn't sure what it was.
---
That's fine! Add me and we can link up when we are both on
---
Thanks man
---
And lighting must strike your house at the exact time you take the photo
---
Its not
---
Yeah, if I ever do try and attack back, it's from a long distant or with a gamma gun (only thing really effective to bloodied builds) and yeah, i feel bad for raider Roleplayers that get grouped into the whole camp demolishing bs.
---
I'd love if there was a way to stop this from happening without making CAMPS invulnerable, but it's either impossible or gosh darn so hard that there may be some unjust doings, so it's gotta be Invincible CAMPS sadly, and watch how that'll get its own exploit soon enough...
---
It's incredibly easy to do once you found a radstorm. All it requires is a friend, you know what friends are right? They are those things you drove away with your shitty and paranoid attitude.
---
What’s your psn I will add you when I’m home to and we will meet up later. That will work
---
I wonder if that's some kind of weird lighting bug.
---
 I will bid my entire char that my legendary armour will offer a lot more protection then your non legendary versions
---
Only time I've ever fought a mothman was when I was overencumbered after a long loot spree, with just ammo for the black powder. I ended up slowing falling down a mountain to escape, he chased me like two miles back to my camp before disappearing.
---
Most of the kids in this game are obnoxious, I've met three who I never want to meet again, one was like 5 and couldn't even grasp the concept of food and water, another was some self righteous transphobe and then theres the one who threatened to rape my gf when she was online with me because we were in area chat. The games rated mature get the damn kids out of here.
---
1,000 stash space would be really great right about now
---
I sent it to you via message
---
Umm, he's not alive yet?
---
As long as we can customize the size and layout of the bunker. I don’t want anything premade
---
That sux! I'm so afraid that will happen to me. Or that the game will swallow one of my armor pieces! My gun is my baby (my whole build was done around it) and my armor took forever and a LOT of caps to get.
---
Did he address the copyright strikes?
---
No, I mean I wouldn't have thought it worked on robots at all being, you know, syringes loaded with some kind of drug.
---
It definitely works on the SBQ and normal Scorchbeasts.  I don't profess to knowing how it works with multiple players though.
---
Stop hoarding. You dont need fifty thousand rifles...
---
Play what you wanna play. Ignore the rest. Buddies will be buddies.
---
Not sure on drug vs robot. But it does. Somethings you don’t question.
---
To all who answered.  Thank you for your input.  After several attempts and sorting by buildable only, I was finally able to see them.  They are now placed. :-)  Thanks for all your help!
---
A good amount of my stash issues should be solved when the Legendary Vendor comes out. I do have a good amount of junk but a lot is being taken up by legendary items at the moment.
---
"You high levels with your god weapons and builds of course think it's easy, you're not the real player base!" -whoever that dude was that told me the other night when I said I accidentally beat it in under 10 minutes.
---
Reading comprehension FTL this time.
---
On PC rebuilding Dumpster-Henge the sequel right now actually. Of course, I try to log on daily. Hours vary. [Beth.net](https://Beth.net) name is exactly the same as my reddit name so no issues with confusion there. I'm pretty close to being done I think lmao. I'll probably change things up and whatnot but just getting down the basics atm.
---
Search every container at a train station. 
---
You can get camp plans by taking workshops and defending them but you can always do what I do and take them over and just leave them. While at one though you can be attacked by other players.
---
Sell or scrap everything you dont need. Scrapping weapons can give you mod plans so can scrapping armor but not as often.
---
Train stations always have a vendor, stash and work bench of some kind.
---
If a higher level player shoots the ground, look at where they ahoot they might be telling you they dropped some stuff to help you out.
---
Thats just the things that pop into my mind.
---
then dont be defenseless? take a workshop prepared, or dont take it all.  Again you are warned that you will be flagged for pvp if you take a workshop.  stop playing victim and READ
---
Truly inspirational. I just keep building upwards lmao
---
Obnoxious is a starting place for some of the children I've seen/ heard. Sometimes I want to slap them, sometimes their parents for obviously not paying attention to what their kids are playing. Or saying.
---
I found a furious explosive .44 last night. Got an explosive theme going on so I bought the skin. I'm rolling 3 pieces of weapon weight reduction gear so it's only setting me back by 2.4lbs. Ammo for my primary weapon isn't an issue, but when I do daily quests I'm often fighting low level enemies that aren't worth the condition degradation on my primaries. I'm hoping this .44 will satisfy my needs. Wish it had a suppressor, though!
---
I think you would understand that finding Legendary versions of the armor listed on that sheet would be the optimal build.
---
How could the best house be made of me?
---
Think it's fine, def on PC.
---
At level 15 not only does his gear have a significant statistical disadvantage but the perks available to him are few and far between. BGS hyped it up as WELL GEARED level 50+ MULTIPLE party dungeon... 
---
Even if he min maxed his damage at level 15 he would have barely anything on a single level 30 player with okay gear. Yet he still completed the entire dungeon solo... Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if someone did it at level 10. He wasn't even attempting to use sneak damage. He just ran up and starting swinging his fire ax... the dungeon is a joke...
---
also if you think somebody is going to pass up the chance at easy loot and caps, you are sadly mistaken.  dont blame pvpers for seeking easy loot when their victims arent willing to buck up and arm themselves. welcome to the wasteland
---
I know, I stocked up on pre-war money just to scrap for that one daily.
---
We all been there lol
---
Been like 8 or 9 weeks now, Bethesda seems to refuse to answer our support tickets. 
---
190218-002701
---
190320-004484
---
I was suspended for picking up a bag with a large stack of quantums.
---
My account didn't even have the mentioned items before the suspension was launched.
---
Sad I have to wait for a patch to remove items from my account - which aren't even there now to begin with since this suspension was launched. 
---
All I want is a human to look at my account and see that I do not have posession of these items anymore so I can have my account reinstated....
---
Or at the very least perhaps an eta of a fix for this....
---
8 week has gone on long enough now bethesda please correct this!
---
I like it. Might give it a try and see if it sticks
---
Definitely, although with some of them slapping is the least of what I want to do, fortunately with that one who threatened my gf I was streaming so I sent bethesda the video file to report him, this was shirtly after they banned those kids spouting a bunch of homophobic stuff so I can't imagine they didn't ban him as well.
---
Wait, won't they not be able to get the loot either because when my turrets kill something no loot appears.  So it seems pointless to do that.
---
Me too! I was wondering where the cooking oil was going, hadn't realized it was plastic. A "keep this" box would be fantastic.
---
Haha, just the other day I was arguing on reddit with some utter moron who tried to pretend he knew all about the database management in the game and that there's absolutely no way it could cope with such a system, everything would come grinding to a halt with lag.
---
Both are good points. Then I guess the Brotherhood is only as good, or as bad, as the player permits. He/she can avoid the parts that make the faction questionable, especially in Fallout 4; an example is Teagan and his settlement quests. I personally avoided these quests and tried to limit the prejudice by keeping Danse alive. As for Lyons and the outcasts, I do not like how hostile the outcasts are for such a noble faction origin, however its just their flaw, as Lyons’ openness is his. All Brotherhoods are not perfect but I believe the underlying goal, and their strength, is what makes them the best faction to me.
---
I got someone to start it with me. Im not finished, so can you help me with that tomorrow? I will have more time because its saturday
---
Yup. Half of my friends stopped playing the game because of the stash limit. They had simply no fun in micromanaging the inventory every 30 min.
---
But the people here on reddit kept insisting, that  the stashlimit isn't a problem.
---
Check out the video from Captainoob on this weapon. Even as a one star, it's very OP. I've been saving one back.
---
That's cool
---
Nuka cranberry starts the party. I have just on query
---
Wanta nuka cranberry?
---
They started putting more effort into the atom store + free content. I imagine sales revenue has dried up, so I think they are trying to gently coerce people to buy Atoms. Some of the new Atom shop stuff is time limited for a day or a week, so yeah. You ain't saving with challanges.
---
2 stimpacks, some ammo and about 50 caps worth of clothing almost every time plus it’s right outside of the nuke zone so I’m not accidentally pulling legendaries and  grieving players that are trying to level grind lol
---
Might be 20 for the Large Generator and 30 for the Fusion Generator, but not many items use that parameter (LVLV) so I'm not sure.
---
Most the people in this subreddit are cope posting , I did have a lot of fun with fo76 but I'm not sure if it's in a state where I'd come back. I mean there ain't much to do anyways that I would enjoy
---
It's coming soon.
---
To be fair, I feel it runs with the theme of the game. Kind of a let down.
---
Did you mean to reply to something else, my friend?
---
I can't place them in my camp. Frustrating.
---
Silent additions over the course of the past several patches make me think an alien story line is coming.
---
It would be nice but I think they will put a limit on it or tie it to our stash box limit.
---
&gt; Why then has Bethesda introduced a dedicated Survival Mode?
---
For a more challenging experience for players that want that.  It's more than just open pvp, there are other game mechanics added as well, such as limited fast travel.
---
&gt;Reality check for you trolls, your griefing days are numbered 
---
You assume much.  I don't PvP.  At all.
---
In fact, if I take a workshop because I want something, and someone comes and kills me - I let them and move on because I don't care/am not interested.  I figure if they are willing to attack me, then it's their turn for the workshop.
---
Perhaps you should stop looking for an argument where there isn't one?  Not everyone that disagrees with you is a troll.
---
I've also just come back after sinking 100 hours in the first 2 months, and found the game to be way more enjoyable than previously. I've sunk 60 hours within the past 2 weeks because it's so damn fun.
---
I actually bought the game and have enjoyed it. The atmosphere is amazing! But now im stuck on a mission and cant find a solution. The mission is called “Follow Madigan’s trail”, and now the market tells me to go to the elevator but when i press the button of the top floor, Rose tells me to fix the signal thing which is one of the previous missions i already completed. Ive tried server hopping and even reinstalled the game. Its really a shame im stuck since ive had been enjoying the game immensly.
---
Why not both?
---
That's fine as long as things don't get scrapped!
---
Make the lock pickable.
---
If you’re picking someone’s front door then you’ve already accepted you’re going to at least get shot at.
---
I’m sure everyone is experiencing stash problems  currently whole we’re trying to stock up for player vendors.
---
My stepson plays a lot online. This culture is completely foreign to him. He questioned all of the helping and giving until he watched me play one night. He was blown away.
---
I the the POINT of bulking shit was so it didn’t get scrapped.. what’s the point of bulking items?
---
For those wondering, I was using Slugger 1 for a total of 10% increased damage. I do this have an unfair advantage and knowledge of the game, and The Burrows is in fact perfectly balanced.
---
As all things should be.
---
I certainly hope so! Good thing you had that.
---
Yeah sorry guys,I was talking about the spot with the little office at the top of whitesprings. It’s a pretty good social spot lol
---
I just want the legendary vendor. That'll clear up alot of stash space
---
Haha yes actually, but I haven't played in a bit. Iirc, it was a problem with my audio rates. I went into my Windows audio settings for my mic/headphones and set the sampling(?) rate to its highest level. Then I restarted the Besthesda launcher and booted the game. Apparently, CSGO had no issues with lower rates, but fo76 did. Hope this helps!
---
I keep 700lb of extra gear in a random box ive built my camp around because it and others have unlimited storage. I then try to join random peoples team to use them as a tether in case of a server crash because my extra gear becomes stored on one server
---
I’m wearing a full set of Shrouded right now for stealth stabby-stabby.
---
If it was like a Destiny raid, would you pay $35?
---
:)
---
Where and how did you “glitch in to” it?
---
That's funny because less than 3 months ago I lost hardened mass by scrapping all. Hence, my making the statement -- actual experience.
---
Not on Xbox unfortunately
---
if I remember correctly there is a long bridge at the Devils Backbone waypoint near Huntersville
---
With the 90% ammo weight reduction perk, and excavator PA with shocks, I routinely carry around well over 50k ammo.  If it can cope with that, and they're all individual items, why can't it cope with more than a few thousand scrap items?
---
I don't actually like to PvP, so I am happy about the changes being made to Pacifist mode so I can avoid it completely.
---
But I get that workshops are a pvp objective, so if I claim one I accept the risk.  As another player pointed out, without pvp at workshops, there's nothing stopping a single player from claiming every workshop on the map.
---
I would like the workshop pvp to be limited to the workshop area though, in Adventure mode at least.  Not sure that it's actually possible though.
---
At this point I’m ok with the stash size. It’s not great, but I’d rather they allow larger camp sizes. Server sizes are already small so what’s with the super small camps?
---
Is it really? How do u know?
---
I did use alcohol once or twice. Oof. Take 2?
---
I wouldn't mind
---
I just think it’s an opportunity for new content. I mean they couldn’t put everything in the beginning so this is ripe for a dlc that explores what happened more. Maybe a flashback?
---
I am level 27 and have maybe 20 1-star trash legendaries. I keep holding on to them waiting for the legendary vendor. My 3 CHA means selling anything to a regular vendor is almost pointless. 
---
Give me some way to recycle my junk legendaries that feels good and a lot of my stash problems would go away.
---
It's been leakead as coming with the legendary vendor. Dataminers have found legendary effects such as "almost unbreakable".
---
I was so excited to find mine. I always wanted to be a movie cowboy, with an infinite gun.
---
Tree fiddy
---
/r/britishproblems seriously.
---
Yep. Read title, yep. Fully support, yep yep yep.
---
This!!
---
Now there is a topic i can agree on.  finally an argument i can get behind.  Yes pvp for workshops should be limited to the workshop zone, if the owner doesnt contest it, it gets taken. easy fix
---
So how exactly does it work? What's the conversion rate for legendaries you bring in?
---
Don't forget a jack danials.
---
Omg I'm so excited now! Hopefully the legendary vendor doesn't get pushed back or is a disappointment.
---
So how exactly would I take over a workshop that another player is using? Or do I have to server hop until I find and empty slot?
---
I’m just saying there is a whole world for pvp now, maybe the rules for the non pvp can be adjusted.  While one side kills each other the other side build together.  I’d like persistent workshops, let us build on each other’s work.  
---
I’m don’t blame you, I just don’t think it’s really a game to attack on people who aren’t ready/willing when there is a whole world of people who are.  Further, doing that for caps/ loot is pretty sad it’s all worthless, you can’t get anything good, you have to kill a legendary for anything good.  You’ll make more caps selling that legendary then you will capping me.
---
No! I keep calling it SS and people keep asking me what that is. When people ask what something is, they're more likely to remember it so soon everyone will just know. It's just like TSE was back when that first got abbreviated.
---
How much u want for BOS
---
It would be cool if, in a future update, they just dumped the recipe in the nukacola plant and didn’t say a word to anyone.
---
I don't think it will be, and we already know it's location.
---
BETHANY YOU FILTHY WHORE HELP US
---
Great idea! And someone was talking about defenses, what if it was on a land plot run by protectrons who were programmed to guard the area like white springs
---
It'd be cool if it was a flashback where you fought on the space station, zetans or robots or whatever, and at the end you crashed it to save WV, and whatever loot you gathered you find in a locker back in the present day world.
---
Honestly dude I think your might be over reacting. Like the other commenters have stated, you’ve agreed to pvp by taking the workshop despite playing in AM. My advice for you would be to not take workshops at all and consult a map of resource deposits found through a simple google search, and placing your camp there. If you would like to continue claiming workshops then I suggest investing some perk cards into Home Defense so you can build stronger and more diverse turrets to protect you. Leaving the extractors unlocked too is something. 
---
Personally I take multiple workshops every play session and never have had a griefing problem. The only time people will take a workshop I own is at the munitions factory. Also I will take a workshop by force when I want the resources and the owner hasn’t made the extractors. 
---
Hope this helps and curbs your poor experience.
---
When does the vendor arrive, early May right?
---
No perks is pretty extreme... you'll be struggling enough without it, trust me.  It makes survival super tense too, because it's so hard to spot players without an indicator of any sort.  Let me know how you like it, glad there's one or two likeminded individuals on this sub... everyone around here seems to want it easier.  Give me dark nights! Extreme scarcity! Make shit meaningful again!
---
Tons of people have drunk dialed before- it happens ;)
---
I ignore everyone and have all chat turned off. 
---
When I see other players, they may as well be NPCs.
---
Custom weapon names are only viewable for the person who named them.

Power armour

Well, that 1 star bloodied shotgun I bought from the whitesprings bot for 600 caps is going to pay off
---
Abstract house v nice
---
That mod was the best!  "Piiiip boy...3000 part of your life!"
---
Nope.  It’s terrible.  They’ve added new content, fixed ‘many’ bugs, made some good adjustments and the servers tend, I say tend, to be full of decent folk.  9/10 would not play as I still don’t have the exact 3 star legendary I want.
---
Either May 23rd or 27th, sorry don't really remember the exact date.
---
I don’t drink though.
---
Allegedly something is going to happen there eventually, according to bits I've read here and there. Hopefully it's true.
---
I've never seen a level requirement on plans before. The Enclave vendor always has that plan available.
---
Bulk never used to scrap. When they fixed it so mods wouldn’t autoscrap, they also (inadvertently) made it so that bulk scrap couldn’t be used to craft/repair items. Their fix for that made bulk junk now autoscrap.
---
At this point the Vandigos and Deathclaws provide better loot.
---
Basically you prefer looking for your stuff then just producing it.
---
Ok thanks
---
Furious by far, as long as you do not miss your shots. Add a big guns bobble, psychobuff/tats and a magazine/comic for whatever your needs and you'll do massive amounts of damage.
---
The background of all three is different...
---
Np.
---
If you're trying to get Acid, this is a lower section farming method I use. 
---
Starting at Disposal Field just west of Vault 96 there's a Snallygaster there that you can get acid from. Next fast travel North to the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast, go to the destroyed traffic/train overhang there should be two YG there. 
---
Then head West by North West to the Capitol Building. When you load in from fast traveling, look down below to your left there should be a patrolling Grafton Monster in the water below. If it's not there then you may have to go down there so that it spawns from the ground. It should only be level 10 or so. 
---
Next in the SAME area, head south then west when you've gotten to the clearing so you run into a Snallygaster that should be a regular spawn in that area like the Grafton Monster.
---
The only other guaranteed areas I know of for Acid creatures are the YG at Civil War Cemetery parking lot and one near Dolly Sods Wilderness in the Mire.

Im level 28. Just realizing how important it is to preplan your build. Definitely do this.
---
I keep 700lb of extra gear in a random box ive built my camp around because it and others have unlimited storage. I then try to join random peoples teams to use them as a tether in case of a surver crash lol waiting for that legendary vender too
---
Photo mode is disabled inside. probably to prevent this exact thing
---
How rude.
---
Same but with bubblegum. I was hoarding bubblegum for the past month but have yet to see another “eat ten pieces of bubblegum” challenge. Now it’s this bs from the OP.
---
those last few sentences hit me hard :(
---
True less time wasting caps traveling more time doing actual searching for stuff. Plus if your in a shopping mood go to white springs they have a great variety.
---
Nobody has really done the leg work to figure out DPS tables for all melee weapons. Bethesda balances everything based on their own DPS data.
---
I timed and compared a super sledge and deathclaw gauntlet for some pistol DPS article I wrote up and it was obvious the gauntlet attacked leagues faster than the sledge. The gauntlet should win in a DPS race with a comparable build.
---
The main issue we have is using DPS as an argument for "what is good". Everyone cares only about the number in the pipboy. That is all they use to quantify the value of a build. Look at what is popular. TSE directly improved the number in the pipboy. Everyone jumped on that train. Bloodied does the same, everyone jumps on that train.
---
This could also be paired with the player vendors
---
I'm gonna suggest you remove this post in case one of the CM's sees and passes your username onto the admins and you get the old ban hammer.
---
They do need a hard mode really. Probably is, game is very imbalanced.
---
This
---
Lmao yesterday I ran through it with a fuckin drill (I didn’t realize till right before hand there is a mod for the drill! It adds armor piercing and a few points of damage) granted I did have power armor but still it was a great time 😂😂
---
But where
---
Xbox, PS4, or PC?
---
Swear it didn't used to, but might just be an optimistic memory.
---
It's just a extra element unnecessarily in the game I mean we could have bigger like 1000 stashes but we have terribly useless items/legendaries holding it down.
---
Instanced housing would be awesome especially if it allowed for more building space. Of course you would still need an outdoors portion so you can put up thinks like vending and statues.
---
We all know why they’re doing it and haven’t changed them. Let’s atoms earned forces us to use real world money. It’s another greedy tactic. Fuck Bethesda bruh
---
Then you messed up your days, tomorrow is 4/20
---
In all seriousness though, I don't have any idea how it could be possible to not just be missing atoms, but have it actually buy something and complete the checkout. It's multiple confirmations before I can even acquire something I intentionally am trying to buy, so if not you, and not someone else in your house, maybe start giving the stink eye to your dog til it admits it wanted a decorative dog bed (since we know all these beds are unfortunately child sized)
---
You're not able to sell every type of scrap to vendor bots, but you can if you create bulk scrap, which is essentially wrapping them in plastic. For a couple scrap types, it will lower the weight, but not many. Being able to sell your scrap is the main reason for bulking. If you make a bulk and scrap it, you lose one of the two plastic pieces it took to create it.
---
Same here.
---
YoUre AwArE. Piss off dude. Honestly I’m sick of you guys pulling shady shit with atoms and the Atom Store.
---
While your correct and heavy BoS would be optimal foe legendary armour.  You have to think situational. Realistically when your running sentinel assassin when 1v1 and even 1v4 unless they have a crit build you'll win 9/10 regardless of armour,  sure heavy bos combat would help but if your a sentinal build most people will pull out a gamma gun,  combat armour offering no rr will be melted,  marine on the other hand gives u enough rr to stand a chance.
---
Does it work on the Mistress of Mystery gun?

---
Its annoying.. I close the doors in the gold club, helps a little. Also most of the time the campers aren't around while the turrets are going off. I was cruising through Youtube not long ago and saw a video how to level up quickly and the guy showed where to build a turret camp at WS lol, so lame..
---
I appreciate your time to type all that out, my fellow raider. Still somewhat new, kind of and my curiosity is out of not wanting to be a leech in groups. Thanks again!
---
Make a door out of a fallen Eyebot then make it go ghost rider on you.
---
I totally agree!! They are such badass weapons, but they are so underwhelming!
---
Ask Bethesda, because they are the ones who have us locked to 800 pounds because their game cant handle the load of more items in the stash.
---
That said, if every player was running around with as much stuff as you, maybe it would be a problem. You are taking it for granted that it can handle that load. You are 1/24 people on a server.
---
Well what I've been mentioning here and there for a while is alternative storages. Think of those weapon racks to store a few weapons on e.g. Prime ones which you don't need all the time. Maybe those mannequin thingys to store some armor on..
---
Also if you understand the legendary effects then type of armour and damage resistance doesn't matter it may as well be whatever u think is better looking,  however in reality to get a full set of sent/assassin or vangaurd/sent or cav/assassin etc you'll have to mix armour types unless you have other sets to trade and like 100k caps
---
Best idea I’ve seen on here in along while
---
Yes i know that sound is normal but its specifically changing when i inspect an item, and very consistent
---
Every minute. Every second. PIPIEPIE PIIEE
---
Thanks.
---
When you’re near your generator, place a sign on the wall, then a power conduit on the sign. Connect a wire from the generator to the conduit. Now select the sign and barely move it to either side just once, so the the wire is still connect to the generator. Now when you move it a second time, you can move the sign anywhere in your camp and the wire will stay connected. Through walls, floors, roofs, objects, or whatever. It’s the best way to get power anywhere in your camp. Put the signs in just the right places to completely hide all wires too.
---
So if I cant play MY RPG game the way you think I should, then I shouldn't play it at all? or participate in events? That's about as stupid as saying since Mercy can't tank damage, players should choose Bastion even if they could be greater asset to the team choosing the former.  
---
As a "glass cannon" I rely on healers to keep me in the game. You do your job keeping the pylons active so I can do my job dealing massive bursts of damage. when I (or others) go down the healers swoop in to keep us in the fight, especially helpful if you run revenant.  
---
If we weren't supposed to have different roles in a fight we'd all be Snake from Metal Gear Solid...
---
The best thing they could do is reduce damage between players enough that there's no chance of a one shot kill and also do away with the loosing caps upon death.
---
i was just griefed by everything mutation, pvp armored, every weapon players. I want npc's back. Love the map though.
---
I don't believe for a second that you're only getting 388 damage out of a high end or god roll super sledge and you have even half of those. With just twisted muscles, adrenal reaction and 45% (out of 60%) available from slugger I can get a non-legendary super sledge well [over 500 damage](https://imgur.com/0N7WjZC) (this pic was taken around 40% hp, non legendary sledge should be able to hit 600-700 without much min/maxing). Add on nerd rage, bloody mess, bloodied legendary affix and unyielding gear you can get **well** over 1k easily.
---
With the weight reduction perk (which you should have if you're a 2h build as it increases swing speed like u/Riomaki said) it barely weighs anything. Ultimately if you're a 2h build there your strength tree is basically pre-set. You can give up damage for survivability like I did (gave up 15% damage for 3 points in blocker) or go full glass cannon. But you need all 3 sluggers, incisor and martial artist. If you want blocker (flat 45% damage reduction from melee attacks) you can give up 1 point from one slugger card and 2 points from another to maximize your % damage increase.
---
I’ve seen this before, can I ask why? As far as I knew, everyone hated wood armor. Ive also only ever seen 1 star legendary wood armor pieces. Am I missing something?
---
Every minute Every seconed piepiepie Pied
---
Yeah I've noticed this too, it's usually pretty easy if you keep an eye on your current xp and read the conditions thoroughly.
---
They are for me, I'm not going to sell or trade it.
---
This is a pretty common bug. Some people have said you can intentionally trigger it by running in and out of a nuke zone. Eventually, when you go back in you won't be taking rads. It can reset if you leave again, go into an interior cell, or get in power armor.
---
We long for his teachings and welcome each lesson!
---
I also love fallout and really enjoy this game, it's having some growing pains but I imagine the more players is has the more support it will have. In only a week in and have been mostly fuckin around.
---
I'm doing it to get a full set so I can kill players in survival with wood armor and a rolling pin.
---
May 23... Presuming it's not delayed
---
Harpoon gun and im sure the Crossbow still need buffs. You would think both of those weapons would be able to 1 shot scorch.
---
removed
---
Using the Bloatfly syringe would probably leave people confused.
---
i was in the mire taking a public workshop when i was being swarmed by scorched with barely any medical, i was prepared for death, when a savior in the form of a man in a sheepsquatch outfit appeared to save me.
---
Thank you Sheepsquatch fellow.
---
You could snipe with a broadsider....or harpoon gun lol
---
Use Unyielding gear. The Steadfast is worthless... Just have a single chameleon armor piece, preferably a leg. Run at about 40% health, have Barbarian equipped and the Adrenal Reaction mutation.
---
Yeah, she also said they were "working" on fixing the dailies, they're full of shit.
---
[Valseek said they were looking into it 3 days ago.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdvtqk/hey_bethesda_if_the_camera_is_delayed_why_do_we/el16xmv/?context=1000)
---
But seeing as how they don't do hotfixes, we can't expect anything until they patch the game.
---
Empathy and kindness is the true endgame
---
Please be more specific you can place the PA through any of the windows
---
Lol try taking Bear Arms off. That nade launcher will easily be over 20lbs. Not on Bethesdas side but i know this can easily be solved with a WR perk for rifles.
---
I have martial artist and 3 pieces of equipment that reduce weapon weight. I can carry like 300 super sledges...
---
I'm just worried that buying an EU key would lock my matchmaking region to EU, is there a region select?
---
"dungeons"
---
I want to know the reason why every Weapon/Armor/Power Armor does not have a Legendary?   
---
I want to use a Pipe Revolver or Bolt Pipe but it cant be legendary.
---
Post removed sorry
---
sorry had to remove it. got warning
---
I forgot to post my build😂! And even though it’s a range build sometimes I like to get insanely close to every enemy every😂! That’s why I have a ton of chameleon pieces
---
The ammo just kind of snuck up on me, I was aiming to get 1000 rounds of each type but I stopped paying attention and ended up with rather more than that.
---
But what I'm getting at is, I strongly doubt that it \*has\* to store everything separately.  I am fairly confident that my 5000+ rounds of shotgun ammo are stored as one database entry with a 'quantity' property of 5000.  As such  I don't see why scrapped junk couldn't be done the same way... in fact for all I know maybe it already is.  And if I'm wrong about all that... then in god's name WHY isn't it done that way?
---
Reminds me of that Bob’s Burgers Christmas episode.
---
Same. I have my Vault Suit (nostalgia and I just don't wanna get rid of it) for 1lb, Assaultron Helmet for .1lb, and a level 45 or 50 Perfect Storm SMG, which is *maybe* 7 pounds, closer to 5.
---
That's 790 pounds **at least** of junk. And I carry ~ another 200 lbs on me with Pack Rat 3, Grenades that could kill a dozen assaultrons with Mac Ordnance, 2 suits of PA and like 4 guns. It's an irritances, and yes, I have a Bethesda-game hoarding problem. FO, TES, I take everything in those games. 
---
Not sure how much strain it would cause on the servers, but best of both worlds: Have perk cards equipped transfer to stash, or be able to pick 1 perk card to equip the stash box with. It irritated me that in my inventory a bulk item weighs, oh, .5 or something, and then it takes 2 in my stash. Same concept with the 1000's of steel on me, weighs maybe 1 or 2 lbs but can not store any of it.
---
Any of these ideas valid, if the servers/engines could handle it?
---
I've been lucky, only ran into a couple griefers so far. But that's definitely part of the problem.
---
I rented this game to see if I’d like it, back when it first came out. I hesitated buying, because it was so glitchy, and all the little brats that got it for Christmas really aggravated me to no end. 
---
Fast forward to now. I found it new on eBay fro $25! So I bit the bullet and purchased it. 
---
Now when I play, there’s hardly anyone around.
---
And the ones I run into are muted, and refuse to interact, LOL!!! 
---
To be honest, it’s OK either way. 
---
While it would be cool to belong to a group,
---
Going it alone is OK too. 
---
Now that I’m playing the completely patched version, all the videos on farming are useless...
---
So, here I am, with a handful of Blamco, 3 jars of purified water, and a stun pack... LOL!!!
---
What do you do for a chance to get the jumpsuits? it is events in a certain area?
---
Sometimes the game likes to set the in game chat audio to 0 so you might need to go into the settings and jack it back up
---
There is some stuff that don't like to scrap when you hit the button for scrapping all the junk in your inventory. 
---
I see it happen alot with the hallucigen gas canisters.
---
I believe what you are referring to and actually hearing is the fan on the graphics card chip in the console.
---
They said in patch notes they are ditching it
---
Yet another reason why I love this game!
---
I think it's removed as an option, this was in the April 9th patch notes. 
---
Voice: Removed support for Xbox Kinect as a microphone option in the interest of overall performance and optimization for the game.
---
That’s pretty lame :/
---
Kk request sent PSN:tTobiasUnderdog
---
Trading is what players are good for "hmmm waddya buying stranger" "waddya sellin" -resident evil 4 gun merchant.
---
I believe some patch notes somewhere mentioned removing Kinect voice chat... I'll see if I can find original.
---
No need, some else found it. It’s a big bummer :(
---
Wait... I also scrap bulk junk.. have I been royally messing up
---
Sweet as?
---
Oh cool thanks! It would have been nice for them to at least apologize and address it in yesterday's Inside The Vault maybe. I've been extremely patient but the dailies are what has been at least keeping me want to log in each day...and lately I haven't cared much.
---
Where are you in this picture?
---
can you still explain it though?
---
Does anyone have a clip showing his perk and equipment load out? 
---
Also showing his party if he's in one?
---
And which perk cards that are being shared? 
---
Side note; . I'd literally rather take a screwdriver to the ear canal than listen to his voice and laugh. He looks and sounds like he just featured in a "Worst of America's got talent Auditions" segment and realized his Acapella covers of straight to video Disney knock off tunes wasn't gonna hack it so he moved to game streaming. 
---
Though I still would like to know the exact specifics of the character he's playing.
---
Yes, I only PvE as well. You can get up close and personal with only one chameleon piece. In fact I get as close as possible all the time with my sniper rifle, just a 1* Bloodied lever action. The closer you are the better the damage, the better the damage the fewer the bullets. You're going to at least want to switch out the Steadfast for a good Unyielding chest though.
---
I am displaying spring golf fashion.
---
I noticed this recently as well,  are they saying you could do it 3 times in a day?
---
I only disagree with two points here, the rest are spot on. Especially the point about the enemy AI being jacked to all hell in some scenarios...
---
I will point out I’m on console here, not PC :P 
---
I’ve played the game for about 35 hours with a friend the whole time and we’ve only experienced two actual game crashes and a single server lag out. Loading screen times can sometimes be a little ridiculous, but once we’re in there’s no post-spawn lag/movement delay for us which could suggest your internet isn’t quite perfect? (No offence meant ofc, I’m just sharing ideas and my experiences)
---
Am I the only one disappointed by the lack of campfires on each dumpster?
---
I am surprised by the amount of other players that are happy to buy ammo from me at a cap a piece.
---
I pick up all ballistic ammo and have max rank bandolier. I have made thousands by selling ammo to people passing by my CAMP. Can't wait for vending.
---
Is the chain gun you use your hand to crank and mini gun and 50 big guns
---
No matter what your mode, crap legendaries is what we got ;) hahahah
---
I can't believe so long after the mission comes out you can still be the only one on a pylon while 8 people are there doing god knows what.
---
Now as a pylon I ping the robots, at least I'll get some XP.
---
This guy is bsing. The legendary vendor is not set up to work yet as there is no binding in the data files or the exe for any of this. It was a nice try though.
---
Sincerely,
---
A dataminer and reverse engineer
---
Unless your going all In 0 mobility pure sniper rifle that one fight thing . all perks dedicated on killing on that one target.
---
Fun fact. It takes more than "less than ten minutes" to just run through the quest without killing things....
---
To the door- To the valve- to the assaultron......
---
I experienced the same thing last night. It's so frustrating.
---
I feel you, homie. I thought the latest update would keep me busy for a while, but I finished all the new content in a day. Now I wait again.
---
Where? Behind one of the five Mannequins?
---
Looks like it's reward for events or dailies in Savage Divide region (that's where Guided Meditation event appears
---
It's only happened to me once, but I hopped a couple times and found the server I nuked
---
Reminds me of how I used to sit in a suit of excavator power armor outside Vault 76 looking like some abandoned suit. In the time I used to do that, I think I got like five players who wondered why they couldn't grab the suit, until I stood up to reveal it was occupied.
---
Do you not think its wierd that the system does this specifically when inspecting? Would like someone else to test this if possible.
---
So you didn't show your actual perk load out on stream? Or your equipment load out? 
---
How about how many party members and which perks they had shared?
---
Don't be such a pooper.
---
And you can take points out of endurance and put them in Strength and Intelligence. All you need in Endurance is radicool, and some ranks in Gunsmith will go a long way for you
---
I'm gonna play devil's advocate for a second. While I would love more stash size, of course, I don't even think 1,000 would be enough. For my specific example, I only have one actual weapon, daisycutter, which is 6lbs. About five more pounds of grenades and orbital beacons. I don't have any real armor, just clothes and hats, so there's about ten pounds there. Another twenty in armor frames. The rest of my stash goes to aid and junk.
---
I think the best solution would be having a separate junk storage which would be huge, but you can access it anywhere (like now), and a smaller storage that's only accessible in your camp for weapons, armor, aid, etc. It would make your choices matter more, since you couldn't resupply in the field, but penalize you less for having a bunch of junk. It sucks when you have to ditch some junk to make more room and end up needing it later. Looking at you, copper.
---
Or, reduce junk weights for everything except lead, ultracite, acid, things like that. For balance.
---
These are just my thoughts on how to fix things
---
I preordered it but didn't have time to play til mid January. Now I'm addicted. I'd like someone (or a few someones) to do difficult quests and areas with sometimes, but mostly I like the lone wanderer thing.
---
I did actually have a similar idea with the concept of basements a while back, where the lower half of the foundation would negate the normal terrain allowing you to build down into the ground. I also thought it could be used for making a pool (firstly, because pools would be awesome, secondly it would provide a new way to grow crops).
---
Well if it is the graphics card it's common. Certain actions on the screen cause it to lag so to speak.
---
true we need weapon racks too
---
I live alone.
---
Awesome thanks, I always forget what that part of the map is called!
---
Well out of context, but perfectly played 😂
---
Thank you!
---
Even though everyone asked for all the vendor cash pools to be combined, I feel it has deterred me from traveling and exploring as much also
---
Especially if there’s going to be more of these new events with unique rewards. I’m holding onto The Fixer for dear life. I’m still upset that I lost my All Rise. 
---
If they want us to get excited about cool shit, they have to let us store it!
---
Ok. Then no one believes you.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Scorched/mutants/robots 'opens door'...  Say hello to missile turret and his friends before before they even  breathe out their growl all you hear is hellfire of missiles blocking their screams.
---
I tried. No one responds. Gave up.
---
Lmao don't give them ideas!
---
I think it makes sense, all other weapons have a detachable magazine. Doesn't matter how big a magazine is, it reloads the same speed. But crossbow have no magazine and so will need reloading one bolt at a time.
---
Hmmm ... I thought I was going crazy, too, but I had this happen with an arm that I was frequently switching out with another arm.
---
I had a full sent-ass set, and then would frequently switch out one of the arms for a chameleon arm when I spotted someone; then one day, the full set became a 4/5 set.
---
Well it just doesn't seem like the game was designed for that amount of wealth. I feel like your case would be a rare one so I don't think they introduced a banking system
---
Awesome! Add me on discord as well. ChrisK#3420 we can play anytime.
---
Oh yeah, the amount of times I’ve run into rooms blindly swinging for ghouls and hit a player in the face lol
---
Holy crap I have taken a very similar picture!
---
The sarcastic is strong with this one ☝
---
This is the devs getting back at us. "Keep talking shit about our content you ungrateful bastards!"
---
To be fair, this was simply a reply to a comment.  Can't call that an announcement.  An announcement would be a separate post by itself, like a PSA post.
---
Wouldn’t mind the ability to Bulk Ammo and then sell it
---
The skipping silhouette does look like her image in the achievements/trophies. This does sounds like an interesting rumor/idea/theory.
---
There's an argument to be had for sure. It's 'pvp vs pve' in workshops in Adventure Mode. Are you a troll or griefer? If not, my piercing words aren't directed at you.
---
I like to go to low level players and hand them my known plans and recipes. :) I also like to help them out whenever they are in a tough situation. I had two level 15s alone in Watoga today who where constantly getting killed so I just started shooting with them so they could gain their XP without dying.
---
Does it at least move when you run into it or do you move right through it?
---
Question does anyone tried artillerying it?
---
Yeah, we need the physical camera which was pushed back, so the pre-made challenges are put of sync.
---
The only issue I see with this is what happens when you shuffle perks. 
---
If you remove a perk that takes your 100lbs of chems down to 20 in your inventory you just become encumbered. If that applied to your stash and you remove it, then what? Does your stash explode? 
---
Orrrrrr ya know QoL perks could just be always on and not require a perk slot... but ya know that’d make things too easy.
---
The technology for dynamic configuration changes just isn't there yet.
---
When they do, I’ll move out of the hills (maybe, the views ARE fantastic) and maybe on to that main stretch of route 64 between 76 and Morgan Town so I can be next to my sweet sweet snap tails for Nuka Dark brewing and a bit “easy access” for player vending. Maybe.
---
Got the witch plan not far from the skeleton 1, been mapping the random appearances. They also have a life span now.
---
Nah, there's no lag - I'm running at 100mbps with a direct line. Other games don't cause any sort of issues like this. I'm also running on a M.2 SSD so it's not load-up times that are killer for me, it's the actual placement of world objects, texturing, then global illumination that seems to be killing me whenever I fast travel/load in.
---
Crashes for me happen the most, when there's some sort of "event" (like pop-ups for legendaries, solo code pick ups or lockpicking)... It's like it doesn't know what to do after it's done showing me the thing, then justs shuts down :/
---
See the deal is if you're letting a young kid play don't have them on mic &amp; def don't let them play alone. But it's why I'm always nervous letting my kid play alone on these kinds of games. He loves them &amp; usually just wants to aimlessly explore cool locations. Luckily he only ever wants to play with mom or dad. 
---
It's also why I never mic when I don't play with my husband I don't want to deal with jackasses ruining my game {even if it's a rare occurrence}.
---
Well, the game engine isnt the same as the data base where things are stored. By the way Bethesda talks about it, seemes like the game engine is keeping track of all the things a player has on them - they are loaded into memory, in other words.
---
We know the engine is limited in this way, because Bethesda said it is. It's not really something that we have to figure out or debate. The game keeps track of every item and players having too many items causes server instability. Fact, we know this.
---
From a technical perspective, the game engine should be able to handle a few hundred integers representing junk, aid, notes, non armor apparel, misc items, etc for each player. The fact that it cant means it is doing some very inefficient things in how it keeps track of these things for each player. 
---
I dont know for a fact that this is how its keeping track of stackable items, but I know that most people are loaded up with stackable items (junk, aid, ammo) and that it causes problems for the whole server if too many people have too much stuff. That's part of the reason why they hard capped characters at 1500 pounds... too much stuff on characters on one server can bring the server down.
---
I've not wandered far out of the forest til recently, so I don't have much anyone would want, or a lot of caps to buy with. And I don't carry much I'd want to trade just wandering around. I'm the lowest level lvl 70 you've ever met!
---
Yeah ive heard with the PS4 Pro the hardware sometimes tries to do things so fast that theres actually a small delay
---
I will usually respond if addressed but generally won't start. A lifetime of crippling shyness continues...
---
id also love it if the terminal could do the following
---
\- Open/Close doors on a pre-set timer (ALL doors, including the ones people leave open)
---
\- Change Turret Effectiveness (more power used per connected turret if increasing, less used if decreasing)
---
\- More turret targeting parameters. (Hostiles, Non-Hostiles, Non-Players (everything NPC, even chickens and foxes), Non-Hostile Players, Everything, and Shut down)
---
\- Control Extractor Effectiveness (same as turrets)
---
\- Wireless Lights (Off Daytime, Off, Always On)
---
\- Change Purifier Effectiveness (Speeds up water made, but Changes water type made. can make dirty, toxic, boiled at faster speeds then purified)
---
What you don't realize is the game can only hold so much stuff, that's why the limit on items is like 1500 or something so the server won't crash.  And this entire game is ABOUT hard choices dude, you sound very whiney lol!  There's a reason behind everything.  Stash limits are there so servers won't crash as much!  If everybody had 100000000 in their stash, your game would never load sir!
---
There's no other way to direct a players eyes to a little brown bag that sometimes blends in :)
---
I think it would be cook if we could have journal entries on our our termial.
---
"Dear Diary, I killed two scorched beasts today but man, my arms are sore from shooting that heavy ass minigun!"...
---
Ohhhhh there's worse there's someone who doesn't know how to rank up perk cards at lvl 60.
---
The very existence of Survival Mode is clear evidence of PvP's inevitable elimination in Adventure Mode. The writing is on the wall.
---
ha ha i get mine for 1750.
---
Not shit loot no loot
---
Welcome to new MMO/RPG style games. An immense portion of the map is un-utilized … we passed through many of these areas they in a trivial way. They *are* the foundation for future content.
---
That day players stop looking at the map like FO4 where content is basically there on launch (and DLCs are totally separate maps … Far Harbor, etc) and start looking at the immense open world detail for what it is they might see a brighter future.
---
Frankly, if everything had meaning on launch I'd be very afraid of the possibilities in the game over time.
---
I am now 104 on my second character and haven't even been to more than 50% of the locations
---
Probably sounded like a script because the poor kid rehearsed it so much.
---
Odd, I died multiple times during that event from people engaging pvp though Workshops
---
Yes I hit it in VATS and normal time
---
Nothing at all
---
I really wish people would stop making this completely false "it's aimed at level 30-40 players" argument. it's not. it's aimed at level 50+.
---
That’s super annoying. Apparently, this game was built for console in the first place and then they really badly ported it to PC (not sure if that’s true though), so maybe that’s a factor? Interestingly both of our crashes happened when exiting buildings in areas we’d barely explored.
---
Fix your engine Bethesda, because if you did... this game would be even more fun. Honestly, me and my friend (a Fallout virgin) genuinely love playing the game and exploring together. We build our bases up, fight terrifying monsters way above our level and get really immersed in the world. But then the games like “uh, no” and just stops all the Gutsys from moving, or crashes the game, makes Scorchbeasts constantly run away from players half its level or randomly decide you can’t place damn doors in your C.A.M.P because they’re apparently floating. That genuinely ruins the immersion and can be really stressful.
---
omg, they STILL haven't fixed this? It's been, what, 2-3 patches we've passed with this issue not being fixed?
---
Sweet roll?
---
That's a God roll if I've ever seen one
---
full unyielding build with hard bargain 3.
---
I'm not sure how Beth worded that because I haven't actually seen it.  Do they mean they separately track each individual item in a stack, or each item as a stack?  And if they said the former, I'm not sure I believe them.  They definitely do for food items, because they spoil at different rates, and as they're the same category as chems etc I wouldnt be at all surprised if it tracks them the same way too.  But I have doubts they do that for ammo or scrap.  Like you say though, only Beth know for sure.
---
Is the poster now missing at the train stations? I thought it was still there.
---
Thank you so much for your answer! And what about the player vending machines? Are those also pushed back or are they out and I've missed them?
---
If it was in a bag on the ground it's...flat out gone.
---
I’m with you. Plan ahead before you leave camp, and repairs won’t be as big an issue.
---
That’s the one, thanks....going to try build my base on here if possible
---
Ahh I only have 3 pieces of unyielding.
---
Well, passing on that then.
---
Yeah. Only creature I have encountered. Have yet to encounter the Flatwoods Monster.
---
"are working to address" means to me that they are working to ensure that it doesn't happen again in the future but unfortunately due to the way 76 is patched/updated, they can't do anything until patch 8.5 or 9.
---
Amen
---
Omfg I'm certainly not that bad! I've always liked to be higher level than the enemies so I will grind for weeks to get levels. Just finished upgrading the scorched detectors yesterday! I'd like to do some legendary farming but would like at least one person to do that with. I've got semi decent gear but of course I want better. Just don't have the mod plans, which is why I finally left the forest. Honestly probably at least half my levels are from crafting!
---
I mean with a few perk cards being shared and a few of the right mutations..... 
---
A level 15 Melee character could do some serious harm to some lvl 30 random.
---
I havent seen a windigo or the flatwoods. Though I have beaely left the forest.
---
I use my grenades launcher to get splash damage on mobs, and sometime cripple them. That's all they're good for for the most part.
---
OH GOD NOT THE SCHUTZSTAFFEL
---
When’s this supposed to be happening? Got a lot of assholes lately griefing my camp too.
---
I'm not melee or bloodied and that's still beautiful.
---
Skip adventure mode, it's unnecessarily restrictive and makes for a far less organic and interesting experience. It's not death match mode like most people on this sub seen to think. In my experience I've had more friendly encounters than hostile and not knowing the intentions of the other players adds a lot. Obviously this is entirely subjective and and many people will disagree but I've had a great time starting a fresh character in survival.
---
You should still be able to get the poster from the atomic shop for free, and use it from your camp?
---
I want instanced housing at whitesprings gold coarse. The ones with the hand scanners and they can be workshops similar to the home plate in diamond city. 
---
I also want craftable underground hatches that lead to personal bunkers, non instanced though
---
It’s more like, why not both?
---
It's a straight upgrade to the quest reward one, black diamond.
---
Here's [my best burrows drop](https://imgur.com/vbSUf9R), doesn't suit my build but I can't complain
---
agreed
---
Yeah, I think alot of it has to do with the engine. CryEngine, Unreal and even *unity* are lightyears ahead of bethesdas in house creation engine.
---
\&gt;also deleted from fo76filthycasuals
---
so youre just a compulsive liar, cool
---
That is... damn.  My heart's going pitter pat over here.
---
Yeah that's what I figured. I don't know what was going through his mind but it wasn't my bullets that day. If there was any actual bullying, I hope they found the actual culprit and reported them.
---
If you don't have the perk get it, and if you don't want to spend the minimum amount of time it takes to make an adhesive farm... Then don't be complaining you can't find it. Adhesive farm is the fastest and easiest way to get adhesive, aside from doing what dude said about that goo...
---
...That's a pretty gun. What platform are you on/is it for sale?
---
T Series and Raider armor, for some reason, are exclusive spawns. A frame can spawn pieces from any T Series set, or just pieces of Raider. The frames that spawn raider tend to be in lower level region as well. I can't recall ever seeing any in the Bog or the Mire.
---
They could probably chuck another 50% damage on the grenade launcher and missile launcher. If not straight double the damage. They're very heavy, the ammo is heavy and scare. Why do so little?
---
Yeah, my Fiance lost a calibrated PA earlier this week and we had to do a lot of work to replace it.
---
Yes and no, I don’t think slower melee is fair as anyone that goes a melee tank build will need to use power armour
---
That’s the main reason for me not to do it. Bethesda killed their nicely crafted boss with lousy loot.
---
It's not that bad just hit up some missions and it's normal to have that "Now What" feeling since stats don't increase anymore. I went master of all weapons build but no melee involved.
---
Alien blaster is complete garbage, i went through all the work to convert it so i could have actual ammo, and the damn thing cant even pop balloons. You can punch a balloon and it will pop.
---
POOF
---
Yeah, got offered 25k caps for it. Prob will sell it after I mess with it a bit.
---
From my experience, the servers aren't region locked.
---
I myself lost a bloodied 10mm pistol. Placed a few mods on it tested it for a little got off to go eat lunch came back on and poof its gone. Didn't rename it and had it equipped but suddenly its gone when I came back. Something very weird is going on.
---
Thats sad.
---
On PC, you can tell from the hud controls. Not sure about selling it, might do so when player vending comes. For now I just modded it to take up as little space as possible
---
Grab the first workshop you come across, if it isn't taken already. Taking your first workshop unlocks a lot of important plans like the Small Water Purifier.
---
Otherwise, I would follow the Main Quest, and Side Quest that look interesting, until you're familiar with the game.
---
You should be able to still trigger it at train station posters or the poster at the back of the tattoo parlor.
---
If you're on PS4 I can drop by your camp and install you one as a temporary measure if it comes to it.
---
It's so rare to see in my games.
---
Pc, and yeah after I play with for a bit. I currently have a bloodied supersledge with ss and reduced weight.
---
How does medic weapons work? You hit the enemies and you gain HP? What’s the difference between medic and vampiric then?
---
If you want to trade it i could probably give something for it, ive been looking for a good bloodied handmade :p
---
As dumb as this sounds, just have fun with it. Take your time exploring the map. I would stay away from workshops early on because usually when someone attempts to claim/claims one, they get killed pretty quickly.
---
Yes but we don't need to post it every day
---
Really yes
---
But no
---
Contact support if this is a legitimate issue. Doesn't do Jack posting about it here.
---
It's not the local connections. Although your suggestions are good for general gaming I manage a noc in my real life so have white a bit if monitor running all the time at home. It's never the local drop.
---
Ouch!! That really really sucks! I'm so afraid that will happen to me.
---
I literally have seen 1 rad storm the entire time I’ve played this game, and that was during Beta.
---
Nuclear launch detected....
---
You.. I like you. My kind of camp haha.
---
Well, now I just wear the chameleon arm full-time ;)
---
My first mothman encounter was a funny one. My game was still loading some textures so when he flew off instead of it being that creepy black trail it was bright pink. Was like a cool mothman then died laughing seeing it launch into the air with its pink trail.
---
Also very nice.
---
Mega POOF
---
There is an inaccessible door that I'm just assuming they'll use later. Baffling that such a cool location isn't used in the base game though.
---
I've been trying to go to Whitespring for the Misc. quests but there's always a level 100 there. I'm level 25. Hell no. I'll pass.
---
That is currently the setup I use. 1* 50. Cal furious with psycho tats, big gun bobble, and the new ballistic bock drink that increases ballistics damage by 15%
---
Same man lol. Was like um why can't I mod this harpoon gun? I'm sure I got everything I need to do it
---
This is up there with those guys in Fortnite that pretended to be scarecrows and survived to the end of the match.
---
For you maybe.
---
I just pooped a little
---
10/10 Bethesda
---
Yeah this is fucking ridiculous! Wasn't like that before the update!
---
Oh my God... Dumpster fires... Amazing. Not certain I could put campfires on every dumpster but I could line the top ones with the fires kinda like beacons on a wall. And of course, the dumpster fire part again. Yet another good idea to add to the plans for Dumpster Henge the Epic Sequel, lmao. Bless.
---
Many lower level players simply don’t know what to do. In one of the events i participated I took one pylon and got on top of the roof to shoot the sheep from above (explosive guns benefit from splash damage when hit the ground), then when she’s out of my sight I shot the eye bombs and gutsys. One melee guy seemed to think everyone should be chasing the sheep so he came to the building, tried hard to get on top and when he eventually did he stood in front of me to block my view,  so he could keep giving me the thumbs down. It was such a wtf lol moment 😂 that event failed miserably.
---
I was asked to remove it. Please use your brain and figure out why
---
Im curious if the guns from the pvp challenges are anything special. Do you use it often
---
Hi. If you need a friend in fo76. Friend me. I can help ya out.

These are the same people that think a 5.56 is more powerful than a .308, ever. Or that a .45 is sometimes more powerful than a 5.56. I could overlook that one if I knew it was a .45-70. But they also coded the longest range "rifle" to be the likely smooth bore shooting a freaking round ball. Uh... No. Oh and then they don't let you put a scope on the longest range weapon there is!? Not sure if it's even worth bringing up steel case ammo. Yeah, it is. This game really needed some zinc.
---
Oh course they got the weights wrong to a crazy degree... For balance! Or something.
---
Might as well end with the magical alchemy of turning tin into lead! Bethesda hates all the sciences. Physics wasn't left out.
---
Look I’m not trying to mooch on free atoms but in my opinion we’re getting ripped off on atoms by having literally impossible challenges with the pictures, I’d be fine with free credits.
---
..."I like that the game launched with very little content, because there might be more later".
---
I'm not getting ONLY that much out of it, I said that's how much I happened to be getting at my current health i.e. not the base but not the max.  The point of putting it like that was was so that hopefully I wouldn't end up with people complaining about why the values were too high/low but... here we are.
---
I'm not even complaining about it's damage values, that's not the point of what I'm saying here at all.  I'm just pointing out that there is a massive disconnect between how weight and damage relate to each other between different weapons.
---
I'm not using a weight reduction perk or a 2h build, these are my "I'm in PA and I can't use my h2h weapon and something in melee range needs to die" weapons.

He wasn't in our party, and didn't have any mutations on that char. It was a fairly new and unused alt. Used a lvl 15 fireaxe.
