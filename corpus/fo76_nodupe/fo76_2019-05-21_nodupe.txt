Actually, it does tell you. It's quite subtle, it replaces the Bottle Cap with a Possum badge when you're awarded your caps.

---
I have yet to see anyone report being able to compete it, so no known solution so far.
---
Cool...third perk?

I don't know i fast travel to people's camps and all they sell are non-legendary level 20 heavy weapons. Very far camps mind you which costs around 30-40 caps to travel to. If their purifiers aren't unlocked and I waste caps to travel there for something that's pretty mediocre of course I'll let whatever's attacking stay there. It isn't "douchy" it's just me showing i don't like the fact I traveled all this way for nothing.
---
You took the time to write down the main post. Someone took the time to read it. Everyone wasted time on a post that had no need to exist in the first place. Your 'story' has been posted by hundreds or thousands of others. How is your any different?
---
Why should people care that you lost caps in a trade or that someone took your workshop? Those thimgs happen to everyone and are meaningless.
---
Uhhh... Like, agility I think
---
I will be online in the next hour at some point if you are still online, thank you
---
Happy day! 
---
In future maybe put an edit in your original post, instead of an update comment. This one didn't blow up, but you never know if your next one might!
---
For the most part no one really steals workshops on Xbox. If someone currently occupies the ammo factory the person looking to take it will just server hop until one is available. No one really pvps lol. Before  the latest big patch though you could kill the owner of a workshop without being anywhere near the workshop. Just go contest it and then find the owner on the map an kill them. It was a glitch and Bethesda finally patched it. Not many people pvped though so not many bad instances of being killed for no reason ever really happened.
---
Pc and I bought it of a stranger who was wearing it
---
Cores multiply randomly. The number of cores in my inventory goes up, not down. They are half used (no, I don't reload it and cause this myself) but when they are loaded, sometimes they give full ammo, sometimes they give more ammo than the gun is supposed to be able to fit, and sometimes they give partial ammo.
---
  
---
Have been using a gat plasma for over 3 months now. Suppressors ffr 50 Dr when aiming. Never had this issue. 
---
\* When using one of these half full cores, switching to my LMG randomly unloads the LMG. Only seems to happen when switching from the gatling plasma.
---
I switch between my gat plasma and my action hero depending on if she's in the air or not. Have had this happen once didn't pay to much attention to it tho.
---
Can also be caused if you get hit whith her aoe blast while switching weapons.
---
\* Sometimes when firing, the firing animation will play but with a faster rate, firing no projectiles, using ammo, with no recoil, doing no damage. nice.
---
Known bug since beta
---
\* Sometimes when firing, the gun spins up, then stops without firing - you have to release and try again.
---
Know bug. Since beta
---
\* Sometimes when firing, the aim point is offset 15 degrees to the upper left of centred; you have to switch weapons to fix this, and if it happens once, it'll probably keep happening on and off.
---
This happens alot in silosby the Lazer doors. I find switching to either 1st person or 3rd and back again fixes the issue till the next door.
---
Too bad you can't equip a frying pan.  But agree with the Cranberry XP recipes and the quest-related foodstuffs.
---
Go find a "Farmer" char to supply you with ingredients, and you should be golden.
---
Are you on PC, so I can look at your wares?
---
Damn that's even worse
---
&gt; Pistols are trash currently so everything is better.
---
My pistol toon is doing just fine. I don't have any problems 1 shotting anything just like my rifle toon. Bloodied western revolver ftw. Also I didn't have any problems with making a solid pistol vats build. If anything I felt like it complemented the build since you get shitloads of AP. Both my pistol and rifle vats builds have stacked perception and agi... you need both for a vats build not one or the other. I'd actually argue that agi is **far** more important as you can get accuracy via legendary effects and perk cards.
---
You are right ;)
---
Yeah, same thing happened today. Like riders said, one of the players will have a quest marker on them like they are the last item. Not much you can do
---
K, I think I'll buy...will u do 9k?
---
If you're looking to make donations with your too many caps I have a vending machine with 10000 cap propaganda flyers and toliet paper in it
---
Yeah, missed that.  Normally put at least 1 pt in all rifleman perks.  Always debate if 5% increase is worth a whole point for the level 2-3 of each.
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Sure
---
I had it happen to me last night where I was the player with the marker. I tried leaving the quest area until the timer expired and then went back, but the marker was back on me. I left the server to hope the other 3 were able to finish, but I don't know if it worked or not. I was on Xbox.
---
No prob
---
Ya, found one in the wild a little while back as well. Haven't seen one since. Don't think I have ever seen one on an actual Deathclaw though.
---
Not to mention, those of us who would want to go hunting for such ingredients would be able to sell you high grade recipes for reasonable prices (provided we eventually get refrigeration for our stashes and vendors). Thus adding to the in game market and unlocking more potential for the player base, especially if players are looking to not rely on chems or alchohol.
---
Honestly besides that I wish they reworked some of the early endurance cards by combining some and creating new ones that could buff the benefits from food and drink or things like well rested and well tuned.
---
I'm always looking to make some new friends! I've only got one friend who plays and he's not quite as addicted to it as I am Lol. If you're on Xbox, feel free to add me, GT: Hugh Jeffankawk
---
Ok, coming back. Pls have piece and I'll pay 9k, ok?
---
in my experience, once I dominated it, block worked very solid and great in FO4.
---
but in FO76 I don't feel the same.
---
I guess the server dependeance (lag, sync, extra time..) kills it...
---
not that I have noticed, usually do one run a day at least and run across 3-4 on average.
---
Yes exactly it is outrageous, i don't understand why they're not doing anything about it
---
The first 2 times, no. But 3rd time (literally rn) yea lol. That means it's not just that but something else.
---
I haven't had any issues so far.
---
Hey that’s alright. I don’t mind what anyone does. If they wanna lock everything, go on ahead. I’m not the type of person to destroy things because I’m angry or whatever at peoples choices. 
---
Also may I ask how fast does speed demon drain your water and food? Was thinking about using that serum but I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep up with it
---
Looks like amazon is price matching that as well
---
For me, it seems to be very inconsistent in the usual farming spots (golf shop and maintenance building). Sometimes, it’s zero legendaries, but sometimes there are multiple legendaries with 1*-2* drops (plus some “diseased” legendaries that you have to check). I’ve noticed that one of the ghouls that is actually on the golf course (NW area of Whitespring) is often legendary (I’m hoping that’s not just luck).
---
The sad truth.
---
Try around white springs. I found a legendary stingwing last night near where the snake is on the map
---
Ok
---
I said industrious, not skilled artists, we all know that super mutants are the most cultured creatures in the wasteland, aside from deathclaws, those guys are super ritzy.
---
Nah im not utuber but try my tip 1st then complain
---
I want FONV power fist skins please. :(
---
This is hilarious
---
It's happened a few times for me. Have been the one with the marker and seen someone else marked. Fast travelling away doesn't work nor does leaving the server. Once it happens it's all over but the crying.
---
the mole MINOR part wait that's illegal
---
Finished up getting all the serums a few days ago. It's been a goal, the market helped a lot but I got the last 5 from the enclave. Now I need the x01 plans. Broke as f :D
---
Oh ok, so it is bugged for everyone then.
---
Good to know !
---
Nah everytime i purchased purveyor with high luck unyielding i got so many god roll
---
Funny how Bethesda can find time to add new content but cannot find the time to fix bugs that have existed since beta.
---
Haven’t gotten a back pack yet but I thought they said that backpack benefits stay active when your in power armor?
---
We all jump out of a vertibird inside little cryo pods kinda ODST from Halo then we land and look for weapons, ammo and stimpaks. Oh wait that's the next DLC not project paradise. Oops
---
And laser rifles are still absolutely terrible
---
The vendor bot in Harper's Ferry has one pretty commonly. What's your GT? I might still have a spare one. I've been collecting them lately just to give them to people who get unlucky with it.
---
It’s how you beat it. It’s actually necessary to have someone tank the health loss of the pylons. Nice explanation.
---
Which is part if why I haven’t bought any.  They are costing themselves money.
---
If you're main weapon is a rolling pin, wouldn't gladiator perks make more sense?
---
Younq Nasty Man with a q. I have found some on the ground but I think I need the bucket list note to start the quests
---
Yeah was gonna say.. Probably a mole miner and a mole rat. There is kinda a strip club with a mole miner and robot in it- can't remember where but I remember being in there. Even had the std toilets in the back
---
Dont see on.
---
Don’t know how much you get at Big Maw but here’s a good amount around the dumpsters behind whitesprings
---
I have been here! Very cool shop, love the way you set it all up.
---
How did you get your bleedout barrel? I have only found a couple but for the longest time I only had endangerol
---
Oh ffs really? I didn't know about that one, but I'm completely unsurprised.
---
Nobody knows, it's never been seen.
---
Oh, howdy! If that's your ign, I've definitely seen ya around!
---
Seen him again today next to Berkeley springs
---
This is my biggest complaint currently. My charisma medic character is so unimpressed.
---
Small world
---
Yeah it feels like Bethesda doesn't care because no one actually knows what going on
---
Don't forget about steel, the Vault 63/Abandoned Mineshaft 2 Location/ridge area has tons. Like I've usually walked out with 150-250 wearing excavator. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For some detail: When you fast travel/walk up to Abandoned Mineshaft two, you'll see a (smallish) cliff to your left, (look for the red crane). It'll have like five viens of lead to the left of the crane (if you're facing the cliff). Also if you go towards the Abandoned Mineshaft, (closer to the fence), you'll see some iron veins near the bottom. Then if you go to the top of the cliff and travel along the cliff, you'll come across roughly 10 or so veins of iron. Then from there, you'll want to go through the fence/locate a stump with the yellow glowing blight on it, then continue on and look for a little cliff with a ton more iron on it, roughly 7 or so veins more.
---
Also there's gold veins in the little heap of heated rock to your right when you spawn from fast traveling in.
---
Yeah games literally unplayable
---
Shouldn't have to rely on bloodied for something to not be terrible. I argue that the affix is not even working as intended and Bethesda didn't think people would actually want to live at low HP.
---
And break way too fast
---
I feel like the responders fireman (not fire breathers) has to be. I’ve never even seen anyone with it. Half the people I see have hunters long coat.
---
Look out for those volunteers who activate the pylons - they're usually able to sponge the Pylon damage, but may need help getting any aggros off their back.  Revive them when you can.
---
The volunteers usually have mutations and perks that zero out the pylon damage, or are at least willing to spam Stims until the Sheepsquatch is vulnerable.
---
If you don't fall in the two categories above, at least focus your attacks on the bots, as hitting the Sheepsquatch while cloaked does NOTHING.
---
Hit the Sheepsquatch at least once when it's vulnerable -- if you have a mic, hopefully you can help check that everyone nearby has hit it at least once (so that everyone has a chance to get the legendary loot).
---
Once the Sheepsquatch goes down, please wave over everyone to where it died.  The Pylon volunteers may not be in a position to see it fall, but they definitely deserve a piece of the loot like everyone else.  (Sometimes it will already look like a junk pile on their UI, making it very difficult to locate.)
---
Same. I carry one when I'm going walkabout solo to reduce wasting ammo. Getting your crossbolt back 2/3rds of the time is the best.
---
I've only ever had it crash inside the nuke zone, but when they fight the SBQ outside the nuke zone I have zero issues. 
---
If I see the nuke zone is over the Bunker, I don't do the SBQ as I know I'll have issues.
---
I haven't moved!
---
The lead lined might be interesting if you run combat armor.
---
Thanks! I shall make note of that! I usually get my steel from West Tek supermutants by scrapping assault rifles.
---
Sometimes it really is. Today it took me half an hour to sell something to a vendor because either the game would freeze, never stop loading, spawn me inside a wall or not spawn any vendors at all
---
Yw.
---
It's exactly the same as fire breathers though
---
Ya or atleast themed groups like all Old timey wepons or Energy Wepons etc. atleast.
---
I see you, should I join you?
---
four leaf doesn't work anyways, neither does grim. 
---
I know the formulas from fo4, but no one seems to have discovered the crit bonus value that severe receiver adds
---
Also would buy for the right price on PS4. Just saying.
---
You.... really didn't even read the post did you? Bloodied build (so low health all the time). First time died to massive rad damage because PA wasn't equipped. Second time, same deal. Then got bugged so couldn't open inventory (which makes using rad-away difficult unless you had it hotkeyed, so then you die to rad damage anyway).
---
Yes, pls.
---
Punch everyting with a bloodied powerfist and if that doesnt work blast it with a bloodied lmg
---
It’s very similar but has different colors and markings.
---
Sold just the helm for 10k. No idea what the buzz is about. So its white, big whoop.
---
Revive someone in the water isn't necessary to get the backpack. I did archery, hunting and athletics.. Didn't need anyone to complete those.

Does that include everybody nuking the area trying to level 400 4* legendary glowing deathclaws?
---
Yeah yeah and it will drop a 1*nocturnal wood leg.
---
This happens to me a ton, especially with other heavy weapons I use, the gatling plasma and the gatling gun just seem to have their projectiles glitch and go higher to the left through the enemy for no reason.
---
Too true
---
it is! Always make a round of all the camps, really neat to see what people do with them
---
No one ingame would be able to tell the difference
---
Yup. Happened to me. The marker was on me and I felt bad because I felt like I messed it up for everyone somehow :/
---
&gt;Except the blast radius.
---
Ok so there is something wrong. I guess I'll save my nuka quantums and check again after the next update. Thanks.

LOL literally just happened to me in Charlie, codes reset every Monday night. We're SOL, buddy.
---
*3 Wood armor is why I always keep 40 scrip in the Legendary Vendor. In case I get Wood (🤫) I can scrap it with a smaller penalty.
---
Yeah I would never pay that. I just collect outfits. I personally don’t get the hunters long coat. A big blue wool coat? Neat? 
---
Also OP said most rare not best or coolest. Just saying I’ve only ever heard about it.

I'd be happy to but nuke codes reset on Monday nights and it's unlikely they'll be solved right away.
---
what time do they reset?
---
But you can attach walls to a flat metal roof without stairs.
---
At least on the weapons side the only  issue you have is assaultron heads, and those can often keep 2 stars.

Oh, me too. I've become quite addicted to it. Love seeing so many builds. Just came across this gem, it was really awesome! You may have seen it before

I love this nerd. Sitting around on Reddit trying to be someone talking about a small group of people he doesn't know anything about. I don't know if he's looking for acceptance or is bored doesn't matter. He wouldn't know who we are until he saw our picture. But he doesn't know us and never will. The Whitesprings Mafia is a group of solo vendors that came together to specialize selling and making alot of money in the city of Whitespring. It's about being a exclusive money making machine. We aren't running around having a grand ol time. We are working. Camp Destruction is rule number 8 which is to extort local vendors in our area stealing business. It's fallout, nothing's free in this world. Rule number 1 is make money which is the superceeding rule. Since the Duping patch attaining high end gear was difficult. We took that time to develop systems to make as much caps as possible. Everybody wins depending on your gameplay as long as your group mentality. If your solo which most are in this game we strongly urge those to think about joining in the interview process. Then at our meeting we vote on the person to take on new members as prospects. If they follow the rules and work out they are made a full member. If not they are dropped as money is the number 1 rule. You don't know one until you talk to one. I am one. You want to know talk to me.
---
Ones white and one is red and black. Idk man just my input.
---
I'd have to say the Jester mask is the rarest then. And then kind of the old man winter. Though it was duped beyond belief recently.
---
Wow that long. Damn I think know going to quit right now!
---
And free magazines in the machine.
---
It might be quite a wait, this is an issue that was imported from Fallout 4.
---
damn didn't think it was until later
---
Personally, I try to grab 1 or 2 pylons and leave the third for someone else.  I can handle 2 with constant stimpack use (I keep about 80 on me most of the time, for no fucking reason).  Squat in the roof, turn invisible, then pick off eyebombs and hit the imposter when I can.  Only hard part is relying on the whoever gets the third pylon to not be a complete tard (aka: get pylon then rush the imposter to die in one hit).
---
Have to be honest, 3 out of the last 4 times I was in the event people were just using it to farm bots and level.  One group of... 5 or 6 people avoided the imposter and never activated the third pylon.  Twats.
---
I agree with you, but definitely need to point out the fixer has unique legendary qualities, just no stars so you can't craft weapons worth scrip.
---
The fixer gets a ~20% damage bonus over regular combat rifles, plus the stated stealth buff. The gutter gets a similar damage bonus if I'm not mistaken.

lol That's not an ad hominem. It's me asking if you don't understand the world and lore of Fallout. That it was essentially a "futuristic" 1960's. You know. When everything was made of steel because aluminum was a rare and therefore rarely used, material.
---
If you live in a world where every desk fan is made of steel, rather than plastic or aluminum. It's not at all unreasonable that weapons, which need to be much more sturdy and well constructed than a *desk fan* would be constructed of steel as well.
---
Have a nice life to. Getting upset about an internet argument.
---
Free?  Those magazines are collector items!  Look at the list price!  Ok, so they aren’t mint copies, but an apocalypse will do that!

Yesss
---
I found that if you bash with the crossbow, it will degrade faster allowing you to repair it.
---
Ok. Here's the fix but don't think you'll like it.
---
The glitch you use is no longer available. So you have this blueprint in your stored tab. Highlight it
---
And scrap it nthis will love the plan from stored and put into sotred all items used to create the plan you just scraped.
---
Got myself a Bloodied Bone Club with swing speed and reduced weight from the Babushka. Not the hammer, I know. But I just love this thing!
---
Yes I have it happen all the time now. Used to be just in power armor. I heard someone say it happens when your FPS gets too high. I don't want to download a 3rd party program just to limit my fps though. Maybe we can do it in the INI somehow?

Four boxes of industrial strength and it still looks like a melted snickers bar is in there.

Oh, so that's why I went from having 3 Plasma Cores in my stash to 8. I just thought that I always had 8 and was being forgetful

Nope, that was redacted from their initial announcement of it and it doesn't work with Power Armor.

Wait, are you actually me because that just happened to me about half an hour ago.

At 8pm eastern US time, I got a message that my silo code had expired. At 8:05 I finished launch prep in alpha. I entered the code and got an “invalid” message. Figured, okay, first time typoing, it happens. This is why I try to always have more than one card with me. Entered the code again, same result, and then I suddenly realized what that code expiration probably meant.

Anyone have a screenshot of the Vault 51 dweller? Ive been looking for hours and cant find the body

If you go just east of Big Maw and have Green Thumb equipped, you can pick up so much brain fungus.  It's all over the place, kinda like grabbing corn and razorgrain at Silva and Billings homesteads for "make 10 alcohol daily challenge".  
---
If you need Glowing Fungus to make Radaway, the river area just east of Harper's Ferry is an all-u-can-eat buffet.  From the Harper's Ferry spawn point, walk north until you hit the little dam, then follow the waterway south until you hit the small river bridge west of Big B's rest stop, where the random encounter location is on the roadway and the "mad scientist" skeleton is laying under the bridge.  You'll have all the glowing fungus you could ever need.
---
Yes.  Very rare.  Sells for max caps on trade reddits.

Why would you spend your last caps traveling to a camp to browse thier goods?  If you are that low on caps your not gonna be able to buy anything when you get there.

Oh! The FPS thing might fit the bill as I upgraded my GPU since played last and am usually around 140-160 fps. That was such a non-related thing in my head I didn't consider that being the case. I'm gonna look into that, I'll report back if I find anything useful

Uh, did you report this to them directly?

Well it's worthless because literally 70% of the time, even when the enemy is clearly full health, and where my instigating explosive lever action's instigating effect would work flawlessly, this instigating explosive hunting rifle is doing jack shit. I'm really pissed cause I traded 3 unique sent ass pieces and 20k caps for it, the owner never told me about this.

I know there's mod for that but I'm not into seeing any trouble for installation and stuff. i can barely use nexus mods when they are just click and play style, not to mention "download this and those and then click here and there while singing Country roads and then joggle with chainsaws while reading this text and choosing right option when wrong one will lauch nukes and destroy the world. After than uninstall your windows, reinstal it. Paint your pc pink and dance a rain dance before choosing 74 specific files from 14 different locations and delete those, then copy these weird suspicious files from this internet page and paste them into these 17 different folders while painting  it black plays on the background... and also I forget what was this even about... Oh the weight system...
---
Would be the "Rare" Fasnacht Masks.
---
Crazy low drop rate and only had a very short window of availability.
---
Oh yes, forgot about that one. For that one just stalk a low level, or go to Scorched Earth or Encryptid
---
Worthless to you but might work for me
---
I would guess the mechanisms running the Purveyor are far more complex than they need to be, in order to "texture" drops in accordance with pre- prescribed outcomes (i.e. manipulate the RNG to avoid being overly generous, and favour certain outcomes over others, while recording outcomes in order to ensure the same preferred outcome isn't too common to be detected as being interfered with).  
---
When you turn your game into a gigantic Video Lottery Terminal without keeping the RNG completely random (the easy way), and introduce unpredictable events of multi-player interactions with a large open world, you slow down the processing time of your servers on normally mundane functions.  Like when the dupers were active and killing the game ....
---
It would make total sense if the Squirrel rank was dropped at certain point it would require 3 to 5 possum badges in addition to a quest.  My numbers maybe off, but as I recall there were 10 total tadpole badges and a requirement of 3 to rank up.  There are 14 or 15 possum badges, so the rank up requirement may be slightly higher than 3.
---
Mirelurk Kings, Cave Cricket Piercers, and unexpected high level Yoa Guais are the only things that can induce panic for me.
---
It's been asked for numerous times and nothing from Bethesda
---
Can you be a bit more specific? How far from the road? Which direction is the bush from the tree? How far west?
---
The forest is full of trees and bushes and hills.
---
Grim works. I get AP bar refills quite often. It just doesn't tell you.
---
Closer to 15%, and AP regen does not kick in while you are moving (unless you are on a horrendously laggy server)
---
it drains 50% faster when moving. which doesnt seem like much until you use it or run etc. not that speed demon negates any speed increase of any other armor or perk effect. its a flat 20% increase in speed and reload time
---
They are preview as junks. I have 11 Stable Fluorescent Flux and 9 Stable Yellowcake Flux. 50caps each.
---
I’ve always fully invested in it. Hmmmm..... How good is concentrated fire?
---
“Misfire” causes your gun to explode every once in a while because you play instruments bad :/
---
I'm well aware of that and was pretty sure I made it clear in the original post that I didn't want to use it anymore (not simply because it's due to a glitch, but ugly and uninspired).
---
I simply wanted a way to break it and rebuild from scratch... thankfully I was able to once I ignored R being greyed out while highlighting the problematic blueprint (under Stored) and pressing it anyway to break the blueprint apart.
---
I used to complain a lot about class freak and empath but it was mentioned in the patch notes that it was fixed and I noticed that I take less damage (the proper amount) than before the update when solo. It now also shows the stat correctly for me. Maybe I'm tripping but you sure it still doesn't work?
---
K. I must if misread the post sorry. And am glad you got it fixed. Happy building
---
Stubborn skidmarks.
---
Crossbows generally don’t take the same wear and tear as guns and the game plays on that. It’s more a long distance melee weapon.
---
They want to rip my legs clean off to create modernist, contemporary works consisting of found objects to create visceral, fugitive imagery in a tribalist style that tells the story of their emerging cultural heritage.  I totally get it.
---
No worries :)
---
I enjoyed the THEORY behind the "invulnerable" base... though in practice EVERYTHING could teleport in at will, even though completely inaccessible areas and wreck non-cement pieces on a whim. Very frustrating that pathing is just so fundamentally broken.
---
Time to make a functional and pleasant looking base for my further adventures in vendoration!
---
heh. If its legit, then its worth 8 possum coins. How much would anyone pay to skip the process of getting that? I know I would have paid a lot more then 500 caps.
---
nope, I'll do that right now, thanks for reminding
---
Still shows I take more damage on the status screen.
---
I got one just now at kiddie corner in a drawer... 4 to go
---
Nevermind...
---
What platform are you on? I’ve helped people and someone helped me. After the revival we just part ways.  No need for extra interaction! It just works!!
---
Isn't perception tied to rifles and agility tied to pistols?  Seems to be. As does Strength tied to Big Guns.  I could be wrong.
---
I am finding broken cameras almost everywhere. Check every container or cabinets.
---
Lead and maps
---
Maybe because of the 10%tax?! Had the same issue with 1cap items
---
Feels server based for me. Ran one and got one legendary, swapped servers and got 14.
---
I found the archery and done that but where is the Hunting and Athletics?
---
Alright thanks for the info and heads up! Might give it a try the next time I play
---
Mostly buying plans or nice weapons from people's vending machines.
---
By accepting the certificate you agreed to pay for 40-52 weeks of storage and they're not responsible for deliveries over 52 pounds. I love the T&amp;C on these
---
Now kiss. ;)
---
Also here's another heads up. More info.
---
If you are going to mine do it right and in style in your very own under Excavator Power armor. No training needed and nearly no drawbacks.
---
As an example . Luck hole mine total can net you 400 ore I excavator armor.
---
With a little help from chemist and super dupper. Is close to 4k in lead ore.if not more depending on procs.
---
EXCAVATOR works on ALL nodes even the nodes where a extractor is placed. As long as you get the "MINE" PROMPT you can use it.
---
Excavator doubles all ore yeilds. So it's a good suit to carry around even if your not speced to use it.
---
I'm PS4 but I'm glad to know that. I found a vendor but I'm sure I'll need more soon enough.
---
There's a noticeable difference if you're paying attention - the firebreather uniform is armoured and dark while the fireman uniform has a lot of blue, white, and a big usa flag on the left arm. It's a very noticeable difference as I've seen it, though I've only ever seen two people wearing it so far. I've heard that the leather coat or the travelling leather coat are the rarest outfits we can find right now, something like a 1/8 chance in 0.25％ of the drops
---
Yep.  When a rifle that is noticeably small weighs more than a minigun, or 50 cal that are noticeably big (without perks), it makes the difference ridiculous when perks are added.  I changed my build to Heavy Guns after the TS nerf, as they do far more damage, more quickly, and I can carry four of them at the same time.
---
Alright, that definitely seems to be the problem. I hadn't had fraps on so I didn't realize I was actually getting up to 250 fps indoors, the 140-160 outdoors. Ran into a few buildings with fraps on and consistently getting stuck right at about 190-195 fps.
---
I agree with not wanting to use a third party program just to limit my fps so I changes my vsync settings in nvidia control panel. Dunno if you're using green or red but in nvidia control panel I had the vsync optin in 3d setting set to "Fast". Set a profile for fo76 and left everything global except vsync set to just "on" so it limits to my monitor refresh rate. Stays at 144, ran into some buildings again and no more getting stuck! What a relief! Thanks a ton friend! Really appreciate your help!
---
The game is fun for me to. It just runs like shit and has no real end game. But it can still be fun, moreso with friends.
---
This is extremely helpful !! Thanks for putting in the work for us !!
---
I have found a ton of broken cameras but I haven't been able to repair or make a new one :/
---
This said .... I would be very very happy if my melee weapons actually hit their targets.
---
Oooh, I have one to share with the OP that isn't on the list. Crevasse Dam. I know this evidence is anecdotal and purely circumstantial, but I have seen one legendary super mutant on the roof on several of my trips there.
---
Won't mods get you banned? I just started playing again yesterday and when I last checked mods got to banned
---
I have found a ton of cameras but I cannot repair or make new ones :/
---
Inventory space is more valuable.
---
Mods have never gotten anyone banned. Chest engine and other similar programs get you banned.
---
Nope they are still there. I usually get 2-10 per run from the clubhouse to the main building. Note : if your scanning them in a scope a lot will say deseased or something else and not show any stars if it's a 1 star. It's cause the legendary prefix is being overwritten. But if it's 2\* or 3\* it shows as
---
Diseased golfer goul \*\*\*
---
So funny to see when I walking them with my ski sword. But yes they are there.
---
To save travel time in starting a daily quest! It's a basic mmo feature.
---
System?
---
I've found 2 in footlockers and i found 1 on a gulper yesterday while doing the daily.
---
Nah nah want trying to criticize just wondered why so many deaths....
---
I am pretty bad overall with my builds. Hence the PA and strength build. Just seemed odd to die so much at that level.
---
Bloody build weakens you that much?
---
Wait....you want to make traveling around the Mire at night even darker?  I literally get stuck on rocks and don't realize I'm not moving like 50% of the time because I'm sneaking, not using my pip-boy and it's pitch-fucking-black.  I'm not just going to hand the mirelurks at Highland Marsh a free lunch by running straight in there as a sniper.
---
Maybe they can just add 25% more light intensification to camp lighting.  I feel like my fluorescent ceiling hoods should provide way more light than they actually do.
---
Yeah but rest doesn't cure Cancer.
---
True, 2 screws and a steel plate dont make power armor either though.
---
A sneak perk card also helps!
---
Yea I food around with the palnts on a rug glitch. Put them on my roof came back to 6 molerata wandering around and 5 dead muties dead, and my crops nubs on the rug and my turrets no where to be seen.
---
That's when I gave up. Moved and build a small 1 story house with extractors pruifiers and a small fenced garden out back. Or out front or in the side. Damm mole rats.
---
But happy building . Post some picks when your done would like to see what you've built
---
1. Yes. Because you attacked me and ignored my simple point that blew you the fuck out entirely.
---
2. No. It's an alternate timeline entirely, you daft cunt.
---
3. There are literally aluminum cans, you useless mongrel. It's not rare, you are definitely a special little snowflake, though.
---
I WOULD DIIIIE FOR YOUU. WAALK A MIIILE FOR YOU. GET HIGHH FOR YOU, SMOME A BOWL FOR YOOOIIuuuUuuu
---
Yep, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But my crew and I always launch nukes so if you wanna launch with us once codes are up feel free to send an invite PSN: Skizzunky
---
Bloodied builds need players to aim the nuke correctly to leave a segment of the Battlefield to be exposed from thr blast?
---
To be fair, they didn’t make you.
---
sounds good
---
you missed a trick. Contest, waste the lowbie, take their junk and caps as payment for services rendered, then bug out.
---
Ignore it for 2 weeks to let Bethesda get the bugs out. As I continue to drop fire from on high on the queen or mine for bullets
---
Lead. Acid. Alum. Adhesive.  Stims. Flux. Maps. Armor.  Playboys. The usual
---
Yep .... tried it solo.  Didn't see a marker over me ... but I bet it was there.  The event is a gigantic pain in the ass.  More-so than just doing the challenges.   Music Challenge needs fixing.  Prices (badges) in the vending machines need to drop to compensate for the crappy bugs.
---
8675309
---
Oh! XB1
---
Really? I was under the impression they held a fat man to my head and told me to fast travel to their camp.
---
And if you keep waiting.They will say something like "whats that?" and a deathclaw will come running to attack them.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble. But arktos is in the safe zone it cannot be nuked
---
I do like my water purifiers embedded in walls though (thanks rugs!) but I'll find a way to work around not doing it again. I'm leaning heavily towards a round brick base (ala Jug) with a 5x5 base, with either a 1x2 metal tower on either side (one for power the other connectivity to personal items) or a rounded metal tube behind the main base. I need to find a suitable location first...
---
I see what you did there
---
get the tribarrel mod. slows down rate of fire enough to make the minigun primary weapon usable. I have a Furious Minigun, that was my main weapon until I got a TSE 50 cal.
---
Oh if you're using a minigun without the One Gun Army perk maxed, you are doing it wrong.
---
Barely have  walls much less locks..
---
If they did, maybe you’d earn the use of their purifiers.
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
Well if you’re referring to biv or the new daily camp stuff then that’s why we have one of those personal terminals they just added for free
---
Amazing how fast time flies when you’re having fun :)
---
But to be fair, i highly doubt I'm obligated to kill anything that comes to their camp if that's the case. They probably should have turrets up. :)
---
Omg so this.  With a opp to send a tip.  Like how we can choose vengeance on pvp.
---
Oh I am so glad you can’t kill pets I attacked a deathclaw once thinking I was doing the camp owner a solid. Oppps!
---
Big Guns, Shotguns, Two handed Melee, One handed melee, Unarmed Melee all rely mostly on Strength for most perks.
---
To flyx or not to flux that is a question. But who gives a flux if no one is around to hear said flux did the flux happen?
---
Better get the midwestern lawn deer too if you’re starting this party up.
---
The original daily quests only trigger if you go to their start location!
---
Stuff like this happens a lot.
---
 Id try to take panels surrounding it off, then put them back. Try rotating it. Try putting the roof pieces back in different orders.
---
Sometimes exiting the build menu and trying again works
---
Magazines
---
They've given us a lot of QoL fixes, so there must be something gumming up the works with an idea that's been requested weekly since before the game officially launched.  I know a version exists as a PC mod, but there must be some kind of exploit or major malfunction that they haven't been able to fix in order for this feature to not have been rolled out officially yet.  I avoid mods because I don't want to be inadvertently banned after some jerk figures out how to exploit a third party mod for personal gain and the ban-hammer goes full-Daenerys.
---
You and me both lad
---
Since the required crafting ingredient is glitched and only spawns during the end of a non repeatable quest line, it is pretty hard to get!
---
Harpers Ferry. Manholes in the street.
---
I would just love them to give me the option to build the integrated stairs (the one that has the mesh wire floor) on more than just foundations. And to build the other version of it (when I have already unlocked both versions of the base stairs)
---
Yes please!
---
I sell legendary stuff for much much cheaper than most, for example one star stuff for ~50 caps instead of 2000 like I often see. And 3 star goes for 500 so even those will get sold often. And Aldo plans, for reasonable price (e.g. recipes for 10, every armor mod for 10-25 depending how rare those are, 25-50 for camp items, 50 for weapon and grenade plans and so on...) those sell better than well. And treasure maps. I used to sell those for 10 each but after I went out and dug up one myself I won't no longer sell cheaper than 50 each and still people buy those immediately. Healing items and ammo will never sell despite prices being sometimes technically free like mininukes for 10 each, radaways for 3 each and so on. Not common clothing for cheap prices goes as well like welding helmet for 10, different brotherhood clothing for 25 and protective underarmor 30 or shielded for 50. Except with those I see many high level players buy all those and sell them again for 1000 and so on. I had today this one lvl250 guy who bought all my legendaries (including two 3* legendary weapons for 500) and when later I visited his camp those all were on sale there... with enormous increase on prices. For example my hunting rifle with 100% vats, 40% bash and increased damage after each consecutive hit was on sale for 5999 caps....
---
I have the serum in my vendor store for 300 caps
---
There’s easy SM’s in Summersville too.
---
Serums and shotgun shells
---
The rarest outfits are the Daily/Event rewards for each region that have super low drop rates.  A few examples:
---
Forest:  Responder Fireman/Helmet
---
Toxic Valley:  Western outfit/chaps
---
Savage Divide:  BOS, Whitesprings, White powder jumpsuit
---
Mire:  Tattered Field jacket, Traveling leather coat
---
There was a really great spreadsheet on reddit somewhere that had a breakdown and even some of the drop rates.
---
20% health means you have very little leeway if things go wrong. He had lots of things go wrong, mostly weird buggy stuff. I run a bloodied build, but it’s a HW+PA build, as long as I’m in my PA I’m still very tanky even at 20%. Out of power armor though... yeah, very easy to die.
---
Ah, On PS4 :/
---
What other things are you looking for
---
Resources
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
Flat land. 
---
May I suggest either around watogga (stay off my lawn) or twin lakes. Course there's the ever present green fields of the golf course by the snake on the map.
---
Or are you looking to build around other objects?
---
So many possibilities so many things to go wrong. Let me know if ya need help (pc btw)
---
That’s hard lemonade and raw fertilizer. Both are useful.
---
I don’t cook anything. I eat the meat RAW, baby
---
Corn soup for me - wit hthe herbivore mutation it is an amazing food source. And so cheap to make
---
I'm taking Friday off from work to play Fallout 76. It's a perfectly cromulent reason to use a vacation day.
---
There is currently a bug with stairs and roofs. The way I’ve gotten around it is to build a temporary external stair case remove the existing internal one, close the roof, replace the internal stairs and then remove the external stairs.
---
Banana hammocks and g-strings for all!
---
Hey quick question. I picked up what I thought were recipes in arktos pharma but they are in my misc tab. What are they for?
---
Question: does the perk card that makes stimpacks heal 45% more work with Healing factor or am I wasting my INT with that?
---
Did it let you spawn up top?
---
You have any issues of the Lusty Assaultron Maid?
---
Still got any? ign Nanobreak
---
Yep.  If you want your rifle to shoot with more damage sink 18 points into perception, and then buff it out with X-Cell and other such substances.
---
You just want to slather yourself in mud so you can fight the predators. Perfectly responsible.
---
Preach
---
Water, vegetables  and lead available for free at mine. Just buy my cheap ammo
---
I thought mods were broken  and mad you fall through the world, when I was using them they had an update that broke them
---
Both I and my brother have those on our games since the last patch. None of the other friends we play with do, though. It's very strange..
---
So yeah I know people are still doubters.  Yesterday the Purveyor gave me a 2\* Assassin's Explosive Harpoon Gun which I decided to keep on me for a bit (easy enough to carry around with Bear Arms), and today at AWOL the single legendary I pick up is a 2\* Assassin's Explosive Black Powder Pistol.  I totally believe the legendary effects of your inventory can influence the drops you get.
---
This poses a chicken and egg problem though - if you don't have enough of what you truly want and keep around other legendary prefixes and modifiers to sell, etc the system doesn't work for you.
---
I ended up using the angled cieling tile for the top of the stairs, I just pretend it's an architectural feature.
---
I always give the person a chance to explain why they're inviting me by sending them a message asking why they're inviting me, but 90% of the time they never respond so I always assume the worst.  
---
First time I accepted a public random group invite was a few months back, from a level 127, and about a minute after I joined he removed me from the team. Then, a few minutes later, four level 100+ people, himself included, marched into my base and blew everything sky high. I didn't have enough time to quit out before a good 60-70% of my base was gone.
---
Oh god yes pls.... seems my plants hate getting together
---
Im also waiting for the Prince of Nigeria to give me my inheritance.
---
All that needed to be done was update your custom ini any fo76 mod page will explain it.
---
Unrelated but Bran knew Dany was going to burn Kings landing but didn't say anything because now they have to rebuild it wheelchair accessible
---
I've looked at the code and the mods code. Yes I'm on PC. Knowing Bethesda, it was assigned to intern Alex "kenny" Jones. Who was supsequently stuffed of the the dark dank cellar of codding forgotten.
---
Just kidding but it makes a great read. I have nothing against Bethesda. But looks like the coders are busy with the roadmap items. But I agree they have put out a few qol bennies that are interesting and helpfull. I hope and pray they keep it up
---
Melee totally needs a balance look. it has 75% anti armor perk, + 3 mutations for  added damage, armor that adds significant strength, then add all that to bloodied. And on top of all that ur more likely to get a god roll melee legendary than a ranged weapon
---
Nope, it's one of the few that's working exactly as intended. Also no one's relying on anything to not be terrible. I'm not talking about barely being viable without a legendary weapon. (my pistol is just a 1 star btw) I can 1 shot lvl 68 mutant warlords with a non legendary western revolver. I think you're going to be disappointed when you switch your toon over to something else and still suck. If you can't make pistols good, then the pistols aren't the problem here.
---
Gt same as ID, if you haven't gotten it yet.
---
I literally just wanted to say 5k.
---
Wall turrets would be amazing, but turrets still need to work properly.
---
The number of times I have had a mob sit and shoot my garden to pieces, while the turret (with a clear line of sight to the mob) just ignores them completely.
---
Anyone else have the problem where they picked it up off the tourist, but it isn't in inventory?
---
Hello uhh I came from google but, they finally added John wick to Fortnite I came from this post btw https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/7zdr4e/this_badass_needs_to_be_added_in_same_the_world/
---
Nah bro they added him to battle royal not Save the world
---
I've spent entire play sessions cooking, just to have the shit spoil next login.. I probably just need the refrigerated backpack, but fuck.. That's gonna take me a while to get.
---
All food though, I've learned to just let myself get into the red part of hungry and make a game outta finding something good to eat CAUSE I REFUSE TO EAT DOG, RAT OR INSECT!
---
I horde my caps like the mizer I am. And try and split them in half or wights if I have to pay for anything
---
I've got 3 of them completed but it says 0/4!
---
Sure you are.
---
The game is still a tiny, premature baby in the MMO/Online game scheme of things.  Both WoW and DDO are aged dragons and they still have (had? haven't played DDO since 2014) a lot of junk in the trunk after many, many updates.  Honestly, 76 is in sprint mode compared to those titles.  I think it took DDO over 10 years to overhaul their clunky, basic crafting system that was wildly out-dated.
---
It's always been tiny compared to Fallout 4!
---
I'm playing totally casual even high every time I do, this game can be very easy going and relaxing you don't have to do high lvl content all the time
---
I'm on Xbox and have the full responders fireman outfit If you want to see.
---
The fact that you get given a tadpole branded backpack makes me think the quest is glitched and it gives you backpack later than it should!
---
Yeah same for me, I just wish it was better at higher level ... And also have mods (like other bolt type, faster reload mod or more bolt before reloading etc)
---
Agi/per/str provide no damage buffs to guns.
---
That's what the op means when talking about str/melee.
---
Would be helpful as lately the game has stopped giving me the popup telling me what gets sold!
---
Ah man PS4 here. Unless you meant screenshots :/
---
Guess that answers it. Thanks!
---
That is a mod for the primary attribute.  I’m not sure on robot but you may have got the sturdy one when you only know the normal one, or got it for chest and not limbs, etc.
---
Same issues here with musicians badge. As pictures, I have had lot of issues but eventually those have worked. For example filming fossils the camera didn't recognize fossils at all, no matter when I quit the game, server hopped and tried all distances, angles and stuff. Then one moment I filmed the gloving deathclaw on that cave next to pumpkin house, and name "fossil" appeared belov "gloving deathclaw". So it might help to aim enemies near targets you are actually trying to film. But about instruments, I have no clue, I have tried all places and with each I play until I get well tuned from that instrument. And none of those challenges counts :(
---
Sometimes I get stuck in danger but i can still sneak past most enemies. Killing everything in the area fixes it... sometimes. Also gets stuck on detected alot. Very frustrating to lose all that sneak attack damage!
---
Its those damnedable exploding Eye-Bots that get me pretty much every time! Gutsy are turds too but I haven't gotten any dense/explosion protection at the moment and it utterly destroys both my characters.
---
Do you have mats split between your person and stash?  That can prevent building some items.
---
Damn damn damn. I suppose submitting a ticket is the only thing that will help right now.
---
It only works when you are in caution/danger and need to heal as far as I can tell. Otherwise, you don't need the stimpak.
---
This.
---
I tried a few other spots for hours on Xbox and no luck. I got it here eventually. Make sure you wait a minute or so before relog, cause they may not load in instantly.
---
I would love to have the spiral stairs you see in the game
---
Hey I agree with ya. Just hope they can keep it on the tracks
---
Mod your pieces.  I’ve had similar things where the legendary pieces wouldn’t seem to activate properly and missing them fixed it.  Hope this helps.
---
Plans.  That's most of what I sell and I've made probably 50-60k since vending came out.  If you have the right plans they sell well to the right players.
---
We should be able to play instruments like the junk item instruments you van pick up
---
What I forgot to mention, I believe there's nothing we can do and it's up to Bethesda to fix those, for normal challenges like "visit grafton dam" is issie with everyone, so I guess Bethesda needs to patch challenges before we are able to complete some of those :(
---
Unless I'm tasked to make some fancy food for a challenge, there is absolutely no reason to go out of your way when any simple soup of your choice requires no effort and achieves the same basic results.
---
I think herbivore mutation is a lot better than carnivore, because simple soups become super-foods that supply you with both hunger and thirst at a very efficient weight/benefit ratio.
---
Second this. They're too damned useful to not have.
---
I wish PS4 was that peaceful, it's exactly what I end up doing when  I want a workshop that is owned!
---
My overall theory with the fallout universe is the enclave was about to leave Earth knowing it was fucked but had no way of testing equipment. The vaults were all designed to test different plans and theories on how to survive on another planet and colonize it. Every fallout game has hints to a space program, and I think the enclave nuked the world to run their experiments but we're unable to survive long enough to leave the planet.
---
Or the zetans stopped them.
---
Its duped to hell now
---
I approve of this post.
---
agility has damage bonuses for pistols, both auto and non auto pistols. only pistols though
---
Here since launch.
---
Exactly..... I just wish we could make soups with \*\*purified\*\* water.... so I can eat without taking rads
---
What platform are you on?
---
I think it was from Cranberry Bog events, but I got no clue.
---
Here's a tip..
---
When you send a nuke.. which exit do you use?
---
Try using the exit and keeping your eyes open for a lil some some.. ;)
---
Found one in a camp venture locker.
---
Hopefully with the patch they fixed the glitched badge quests
---
Shotgun/Melee here. I used to use a rifle, but once I got a hold of a combat shotgun, it was all over
---
Also, not sure if you are looking for more data points, but I went to West Tek and found nothing. I then went to Defiance and found one 2\* and one 3\*.
---
I wonder if the explosive is triggering before the instigating so when it goes to process, they are no longer at full health.
---
It's been bouncing, rattling and threatening to break loose since November, but somehow they've managed to keep it on the road even during the smoky, sputtering bits.  I feel like it's been a smoother ride since Wild Appalachia was announced and the TSE/duping debacle was largely snipped away.
---
Same thing on xbox a few weeks ago i haven't went back since.
---
I'll give this a shot. Thank you.
---
Tomorrow
---
I see mine still but it's good to look back at the sales. Sometimes you can't pay attention when you do something else.
---
there is downtime notice in the launcher
---
On the way, has been for some time now.👍
---
I got the night vision for prosnap but it is crap
---
No, it pops up from time to time, usually when it's raining. I used to make about 50 radshield a day
---
I've gotten the snare to work. I did it at a friend's base. And he had set up. Not in a group and I was waiting on him to get done with an event for trading. Don't know if it helps. But give it a tey
---
I sell for 50c/ea
---
The Bethesda message board said its tomorrow
---
Once I took over the Sunshine Meadows factory to churn out Sugar Bombs to use as ingredients for this.  But it makes pre-War quality goods, which means no rads but also means it doesn't count as a component for Brain Bombs.  Pissed me off because I held the factory for like 4 hours before I tried crafting with it.
---
Quirks like this are kinda annoying.  Why can't we use non-irritated ingredients?  Why can't we use purified water instead of boiled water for soups and drinks?
---
I've only ever seen it when another player has freshly completed the quest!
---
Grilled Radstag boosts carry weight.
---
It's pretty fantastic.
---
Everything DOES spoil way to damn fast though, especially cooked stuff.
---
And a nuke was not there before
---
Guns. Lots of guns.
---
Why. It's easy to get the meds to cure them. Or the free on at the pagoda in white springs
---
I’ve played all of them that I have seen. Found one at a building with vending and it didn’t count. I’ve also tried my own, the one near the event where you make noise, and where Biv is. I’ll keep at it, of course, because this badge looks doable.
---
I've seen all of those spawn in whitesprings. You can also find deathskull radscorpions, close to the golf club parking lot
---
Thought it wasn’t meant to be in yet, people got it from the dev room but weren’t meant to.
---
Madam, actually.
---
Sir Dim of Wit, how dost thou not recognize sarcasm?
---
Thanks
---
Its under appreciated for sure. I'm glad to see Legendary versions though. 
---
I put the one I used for the challenge in my vendor for 50 caps, I actually got a standard one dropped on an SBQ and put that one in there damaged as well. No one has took em yet, may lower the price to 0 cause its more just to assist anybody stuck on em.
---
Yeah but that was on pc. Not to mention a Beth employee confirmed its existence and that its obtainable
---
Can you get shovels in fallout??
---
you ever jumped in PA? It goes from 100% to around 95%.
---
This is the last studio I would want building an in-game ladder. Plz just let them focus on cleaning everything up. Also excited for the new dungeon tomorrow.
---
You PS4? Add me on now...
---
Might explain wood armor going from 3 star to 1 as it has been rumored wood armor has some hidden sneak buff
---
It's because of all the different mod options on weapons. But honestly I'd be fine with just having a basic version being visible.
---
The miners are all busy
---
Do you have any at the moment? I'll buy a few Radshields
---
I've had my fast travel point for other players move 4-5 times, once it was in the foundation but people floated up, then it was next to the porch, then on the other side of the porch, then in the foundation to where I have to dig people out at times.  There is also the place they spawn when I'm not there.  It's a bit of a mess.
---
please, please, PLEASE give me your build that lets you jump 20 times in a row. it will really help out with all of the recent dailies asking me to go climb around the savage divide mountains
---
Ok sweet, thank you. Mine still says something about the purvayor (sp?). Probably need to restart the game.
---
Plans, mats water ( even though it's free from my purifiers). Ammo of 45 5.56 5mm and 50 cal. Cores of all types
---
In your world challenges. You have to select the badge you are looking to get and scroll through the tasks on the right side of the screen.
---
I think I said two star, sorry if I didn’t.
---
Rabbits are as well.
---
5 lbs
---
I locked one out of three, cause I've been caught dehydrated and somebody had pilfered them already. 
---
Take what you need, not all of it.
---
Please tell or show me more.. :)
---
What I'd like to see is for spoilage to be suspended if something is put up for sale. 
---
I hunt a ton of Radstags near my camp and have the meat. If I grill it, I should be able to sell the damn things without them spoiling in the store.
---
Yea I tried them all to. And was just going for 5he ao refresh bonus and this piped up
---
Grahm? Yeah, he still exists. Not sure about selling the helmet though. Most if not all people who have it got it in the dev room or bought it from somebody who then scrapped it to learn the plans. I remember seeing one post saying they found it lying around in the glassed caverns but I've done many runs through there and never found one. Also no confirmation from anybody else of ever seeing it out in the wild
---
Id give you 5k for it if you are looking to sell it
---
..I mean, or you could just buy it off the website for $25 and not do that pointless shuffle?
---
I didn't place my camp there. People say that you can't really place foundations there though so I'm glad I didn't.
---
Many others have confirmed seeing it on Grahm, but that was only during the beta when nobody could afford his stuff.
---
If you decide to be a conduit, the best thing to do is take 1 pylon and stay by it. The DOT is greater the further you get away from the pylon you are conduit for. Also, go to the event with no junk, and don't waste your stimpaks; just die and respawn if the DOT takes you out.
---
So many fails on this mission. Ended up just bartering for the rewards I wanted. Legit, don't use your Stimpaks.
---
Except the bug people are abusing to attack your camp. Won't put any up until they fix that bs. 
---
I dunno, my camp is never attacked unless *somebody* is there. No one can feasibly sell wares that every single person would be interested in (at least reasonably). Seems...outlandish to just go "well they don't have shit I want so BURN IT TO THE GROUND." 
---
If I zone in to somebodies camp and enemies spawn with me, I'm killing em, cause I kind of have to reckon "they followed me there."
---
Do you share plans/camps with alts? Or is it an entirely new character from scratch?
---
Just checking to make sure you mean legendary mobs and not legendaries being sold on the vendors. If it's vendors, ppl stopped selling legendaries to vendors now that there's player shops.
---
Thank you oh, you have saved me a great deal of trouble.
---
How about a banana hammock with a super mutant on the dong.
---
We’re in the endgame now
---
Absolutely! If you stay in the forest region, you'll see mostly low-level players.
---
The campfire tales event.Go for it.I was able to do 1 challenge in one playing session to earn 1 badge.Next night,after learning about the event,i got 5 badges in the same amount of time + 1 additional hour.You will also get:xp,caps,buff magazines (chances to spawn on a bench when you hop server) event plans and recipes,all bugs part for the bugs parts daily quest,aid stuff (from the event reward) and fun speaking and joking with other players.You will loose....maybe ammo?  
---
Challenges,in my experience makes you loose a lot of stuff,like junk by crafting and repairing weapons and ammo you at the end will not use.And you will waste most of your gaming session googling shit like,locations,plan and recipe locations and the freaking exams (now there are sites with the exam answers,not when i was doing them)So for me,challenges are a boring waste of time with the exception of the athlete challenge.  
---
When you earn a badge in the event you will see the the cap icon turn into the possum badge icon and the number 31 instead of 30 (31=30 caps + 1 badge).Most of the times the "collection?" tab will not show that earned badge.Just interact with the scout vendors to fix that (or log out/in.)  
---
I found the only worth backpack mod for me is the armored one.Give you + 80 res and only -30 carrying(so you are still earning + 30 carrying plus the dmg res).I was able to dump a dmg res perk card and equip other card thanks to that dmg res from the backpack.Or you can keep the perk cards and raise you dmg res to almost that of a PA.The refrigerator was the 1st one i wanted but then realized i really dont have much issue with spoiling.The carrying capacity one gives you an abusive penalty of -60 energy and rad res.Only good if you are going to horde stuff without much fighting.Hope this help.
---
It will be better with freezers.... But I'm not into everything bring marked in the stash. Its cool it's innovative but over complicated.
---
Yes it does i don’t know what you’re talking about, I’ve seen lots of three star scout armor for sale from players plus you get a legendary urban scout chest piece from an enclave mission
---
👍 I like this. But think just keep it to junk and aid.
---
It tells you if you're tracking the mission status which pylon are active and who is carrying the charge
---
If there was a decent LFG page, I’d never bother anyone else. I’m just really bored doing everything alone.
---
Believe me. I know the routine too. I told them it was their website and was sold and shipped by them. Idk. They made it seem like I was ripping them off. They also didn’t like the drop to 25 bucks from 60. She looked at me like I was crazy. They also told me the haven’t price matched in a couple years which I know is BS. I would always price match games there.
---
I like living la vida loca with 20-50% health to get some miles out of my Adrenal Reaction mutation and a couple Unyielding armor pieces, so I don't mind an extra rad or two to keep me looking ugly.  I stay this way most of the time during "normal questing", when danger levels are low.
---
I do heal up to full health when participating in tough events that I know are going to irradiate and damage me continually.  I don't need/want to max out my damage to one-shot a boss that everyone else is looking to benefit from during an event, like Free Range, Uranium Fever, Campfire Tales or Encryptid.  It always pisses me off when JackassBoi2006 rolls in at the end of the event, jumps in the air and one shots the Wendigo from One Violent Night with an explosive shotgun, then stands there like he's presenting himself as some kind of all-star hero.  I went out of my way to shoot the wendigo in the foot so all 6 people in the event could share.
---
Whoa, ranted out there a little.  Back to the point....soups are tasty and nutritious.  I'm on board with purified water versions, so thumbs up on that.
---
That’s what I’m afraid of.
---
Cant you just start a pylon and see what number goes away then figure out what each is numbered? If I recall the one by the shed is 1, down the hill is 2, and the far one is 3.
---
Where/when did they say it would be like rust?
---
I dunno, I have like 30 food recipes and I periodically craft everything I can. I get XP with each craft, and always have food to eat. Granted, most of it goes unused and spoils, but so what? I always have 2-4 buffs on due to food.
---
Honestly I can’t say which bits I have available after my last scrip scrap run. If you’re on Xbox, I will keep you in mind. I’m assuming you want max level armor?
---
Yeah I need perk loadouts....
---
I have a specific loadout when I wear Power armour, and when I do not!
---
There's nothing more frustrating when you get jumped on by a Mirk Queen and you're fiddling around with perk cards.
---
I want a robot that we can build that will go around and fix your camp to 100% health.
---
I have a few tech docs if anyone wants them. Add me on ps4 and msg me I get off school at around 3:30 ish so ill probably be on. Its free, aswell because im too lazy to go through all the BoS quests
---
My name is Aki-Flare32
---
(I know its a crappy name)
---
Is this the double barrel?
---
I've never heard of these geese, I do however leave most of my friends the occasional flamingo.
---
Before the game released, they said it would be similar to rust and ark.
---
They don’t yet. But dupping didn’t get anyone banned for months and months until suddenly it did
---
Underwear shotgun build,... nice
---
You don’t want that
---
I mean, go stealth chameleon, minimal armor?
---
Wish I had thought of that.
---
No it’s a combat shotgun
---
I too question if they ever made this “promise”, in fact Id believe that they said the opposite at one point.
---
possibly, but why would my lever action IE and pump action shotgun IE be working fine?
---
Did you noticed that sometimes Sugar bombs don't stack properly? I had 4 and went to make the sweetroll recipe, but in my inventory I had Sugar bombs (3) &amp; then Sugar bombs, and couldn't craft the recipe. Weird.
---
When? And where?
---
And why must u focus on destroying someones work?
---
I used dog food and boiled/purified water. Sell everything else. Less to think about.
---
Definitely douchebag by the sound of it.
---
Let's face it. They only need to make one for male characters. Every guy is going to buy the one with the biggest package and that's it. Unless they continually release more with bigger junk. Which would be evil genius level thinking.
---
And it is
---
&gt;Don't do it. If you do, there's a well known exploit where they use blind team invites that are accepted to make you active in PVP and kill you and your CAMP.
---
It's "well known" but the odds of that happening are so fucking low its not worth worrying about.
---
Seriously, some of ya'll are unnecessarily paranoid about shit that almost never happens.
---
Yeah but let's say pylon #2 needs to be activated again. Which one is #2?
---
Saw that as well.. i also read something about clearing your messages on dash board leading to smoother game play not sure how much of a difference but try giving that a go.
---
As for that spot I've had a wolf appear a mega sloth a doe and my new deathclaw
---
What is your stats for luck and charisma?
---
You give me hope, Dawnshie. Thank you.
---
He's full of shit. The budget is static, regardless of your level.
---
The lightening is kind of a give away for me. I don’t know. Maybe it doesn’t do that for everyone’s settings.
---
Starting in order, the one closest to you when you spawn is 1, the middle pylon is 2, and the one close to the cabinet is 3 
---
Hope that helps
---
Yeah. I’ve got quite a few.
---
was it summed by another player? did the box land at someone's camp?
---
Im looking for high up places to place my camp where i can fast travel to, the only decent place ive found so far is the top of the hornwright building
---
Would love it if they made an option for team invites from friend's only option as well.
---
This. Environmental cues, people!
---
&gt; Remember though that the budget increases for every levelup
---
Stop spreading this stupid rumor. The budget is what it is, and it doesn't change regardless of level. Period.
---
This is almost as prevalent as the "queen scales her hp based on the number of people" rumor, which is also bullshit.
---
I like turtles
---
I heard from a friend that you get more damage the higher your level
---
Wow such empty.
---
Exploding ammo, yes. Exploding shotgun, yikes.
---
i could have sworn they always did that, mostly because you can still make the sausages from the event if you know the plan
---
Ya I'm pretty sure it was all there. Not sure about the interior. I do know music always played from inside.
---
Yup
---
That's Bran the Broken
---
It landed nowhere near anyone’s camp, it was by Dolly Sods at the building out back where the bugs are. 
---
I don’t know if it was launched or not.
---
I see these posts a lot and I'd just like to share my 2 cents worth...
---
The idea of a selectable perk system as you level up forces you to choose perks based on your play style. There are limits to the maximum number of perks for a reason - so that nobody can play an unrealistic character that is exceptionally good at everything.
---
When you ask yourself "what makes you special" is it absolutely everything or do you have your own strengths and weaknesses? 
---
To me, hot swapping perk loads outs is not in the spirit of the whole S. P. E. C. I. A. L. system. 
---
I'm quite happy asking another player to mod my guns for me or selling the massive amounts of ammo that I craft to other players that can't make it as efficiently.
---
When everyone can do everything the community feeling is lessened.
---
*Braces for downvotes*
---
I love doing that... It's better for me when they don't know.
---
It's a pay it forward kind of deal.
---
This is hands down the least toxic community in gaming history...
---
Two shots are extremely inaccurate especially with the shotguns. This is why I sold my tse combat shotgun when I found a quad explosive double barrel. I went from 15 accuracy to 57 and I have skeet shooter maxed out
---
But you're losing out on 91 DR with that thing vs armoured and it doesn't seem to stack with good with salt. Thats a 3 point card. No 3 points will give you +91 DR. Barbarian is close at +80, but it requires maxed out STR.
---
Maybe someone launched it and had the retrieval quest active?
---
There are two versions of Sugar Bombs.  One has no rads when eaten and the other is the "dirty" version.  You can only use the dirty ones for recipes that require Sugar Bombs.  A good, easy source is to give your excess scrap and a handful of stimpaks to a humble low level player at Flatwoods, then make your way to the top of the church's steeple where you can gather two boxes of filthy, irradiated, sweet, sweet Sugar Bombs and hoard enough to make a Sweet Roll and Brain Bombs to make some headway towards your Cook tadpole challenge.
---
Hm ok. Knowing that, how do you install mods for an online game?
---
No prob. Good luck and keep tooting away
---
OK, thanks.
---
I server hopped and found him on the 4-5 mtg time... looted the body and got the list and the holo... but the camera didn’t show up in my inventory!
---
Great thought! Would love to be able to do this!
---
You guys seem to forget that when WOW launched most of us never played an MMO. That's one of the big reasons why WOW was so successful, because it introduced the concept of MMOs to the mass market.
---
It's been, what, 15 years since that launch? 
---
Since then, the gaming community has ever increasing standards and expectations from games and game companies should KNOW this otherwise they'll keep releasing turds like Anthem, No Man's Sky, FF14 (first launch).
---
Then you get to the problem where we as gamers have THIS level of expectation of the game, but the development time of said game will take X amount of time to do... which might bankrupt the company if they don't launch early.
---
I think we're at the point where development speed is far slower than we like. We're talking about games that take YEARS to create... but somehow we still get turds like Anthem...
---
Dont apologize for having fun. This game is dope.
---
Great info, thanks!
---
Just up the road from the first town, can’t remember what it’s called, there’s a clearing right in between the road and the river, there’s an iron site, you can place your camp on it and mine forever.
---
You’ll have to visit Nexus Mods, find a mod you like and follow along with the instructions. It’s fairly easy.
---
Oh
---
Still No
---
The ‘burn it’ idea is just entitlement. It exists even in a video game. Lore-wise, the entitled elitists became raiders. It’s kind of fitting.
---
No one owes anyone anything, really.
---
You don’t have to unlock your water purifiers.  
---
You don’t have to kill your spawns.
---
It’s all nice, but not necessary.  Some people just expect it anyway.
---
I read a dev say that it was intended to be available but I guess the drop rate or the numbers are fucked so it very very very rarely appears. I have seen a screen shot of it as a quest reward for completing the Scorched Earth event. I don't have any sources though, so take this with a grain of salt. Hoping it becomes available tomorrow with the Arktos Pharma dungeon since the devs say in the description "new and unique loot"
---
I myself have been relentlessly hunting this helmet down and cannot find it... Have been using a black combat armor helmet with a gas mask to tide me over but its just not the same.
---
Also annoying the only enemies I want to hit in VATS with melee is flying sting wings and the lime and I can’t even swing cause it’s always a 0% chance to hit.
---
Stop it you child.
---
I want a jockstrap that has a mini nuke top as the cup, female variation uses the tops as.... tops.
---
Or Grahms Yield sign crotchplate!
---
Arrrrghhhhh!  Top of the Flatwood's steeple for two irradiated boxes of Sugar Bombs.  I went there once a day for a few days until I had enough for a Sweet Roll and Brain Bombs.  I'm sure there's other areas, but Flatwoods also has a bunch of Brahmin to milk for s'mores.
---
Are you over incumbered, wearing PA with shocks installed?
---
If so. Loose some weight/clean out the stash. And belighter on your feat.
---
TBH 1 had it happen to me once, that's why I ask. From then on, nope I stay under 500/450 and since then haven't had the issue at all
---
......... oh
---
"Try our new Brahmin Herder line of men's underwear, now with extra space for your extra head!"
---
&gt;Get a backpack and slap a refrigeration mod on there. It slows down food spoilage by A LOT. I don't think anything I've cooked has spoiled since I made it two play sessions ago.
---
Better idea: allow us to create a refrigerator/freezer vending machine so that you can sell food and not have it spoil in 15 minutes. I can make every recipe in the game, but I don't fucking bother with 99% of them because it'll spoil melt I use it or sell it. Instead, I just have a handful of carrots at my camp, and every hour or 2 I go home and make 15-20 carrot soup.
---
I maxed Snek early , so i just stuck to the dark walls. Eventually I DID pull a Mirelurk King after the second Wendigo spawned, so i ran it into the Wendigo, and they kind of did a little jig in the back area of the cave, then I ..guess the Wendigo killed it? There was no body , but the King was just gone, and the Wendigo was at half health lmao.
---
It can be the second or third star.
---
To the right player it CAN be valuable. I've seen them go for up to 10k depending on the other perks besides zerker and exploding. If ya on PC I can take it off your hands if not put it in your vendor for 10k someone will buy it
---
That's the one in the Bolton Greens houser ight? Or did I miss that in the cave? Don't fucking tell me I have to go back to that cave and look for a holotape now, oh god damn it .\_.
---
if it lands in the boundaries of an owned workshop ive noticed it is the same as it belonging to the workshop's owner. ones launched by other players may have their names on the cargo bot (replacing the cargobot's name) ive only seen it twice though
---
Just another issue for this game to fix. Oof
---
You're a wild ride.  Screenshot of your stacked shotguns though?  I don't believe it
---
yeah except plasma is a headache to make.
---
I literally saw this all happen in 5k
---
I jumped to the rail-yard in the Cranberry Bog to do the Distant Thunder event, and I found a Sheepsquatch ripping through the Scorched I was supposed to kill.  I never had to fire a shot.  The Sheepsquatch killed all the Scorched and the artillery barrage from the event finished off the Sheepsquatch.
---
I’m on PS4 sadly and I want to try a stealth build because I usually fail when I try even though a shotgun might not be the stealthiest weapon
---
I'm very happy to help.  You can also get one Royal Jelly behind the largest cabin at Middle Mountain Cabins near the fresh grave.  The jelly is in a basket with honey jars and flowers.  A really sad scene, especially when you read the terminals in the location.  I'm not sure how often it respawns, but I picked up one a day for three days until I could make the Blackberry Crisp and never looked back.  Radscorpions suck.
---
Those are normal. At least the bots help.
---
If the black officer version exist, that's probably rare
---
I switched once I got resolute veteran from a two shot, dont regret it yet.
---
They do near my camp on and off.
---
Oo yeah. We could get really tricky if we had gates and timers. Last I tried the timer it didn't do anything but advance in 76.
---
Oh man. That holotape (in the cave) was the best part of that quest.
---
=\]
---
Thanks guys
---
Mansplaining survived the apocalypse.
---
Maybe it'll be streamlined in the future.  Your guess is as good as mine.
---
FYI, I'm lvl 211 with a lvl 150-ish alt, played since BETA hour 1 and never knew I could process food at that workshop.  Thanks for the info!
---
That is legit!
---
They just need to make the AA mods useful or reduce ballistic armor defense a bit on mobs.
---
I get 9 stars into rifleman and 3 stars into tank killer being needed for bosses and mini bosses like scorch beast or Mirelurk Queen. But does the generic spawn super mutant really need it?
---
Without tank killer even with a level 50 maxed out assault rifle with AP magazine mod can take over 40 rounds to kill a generic level 50 super mutant. But add maxed out damage and tank killer it reduces to a more manageable 10 rounds give or take.
---
Which wouldn't be to bad if even with maxed out ammo perk 5.56 only makes 36 rounds per crafting.
---
On top of all the other comments, I'd like to suggest that the brewing station should be used to "can" food, just like how my wife can use my home brew system to "water bath can" various foods. Use the existing Mason jars and lids as part of the recipe, but give the food unlimited shelf life one it's created.
---
For real, anyone who's into caning knows that something like canned cranberry relish would have a shelf life of 12+ months, not 2 in-game days.
---
I agree that this is a huge issue. I just built a 4 story apartment building style camp and I HATE that I cant remove any floor tile once placed. WHY?!?
---
To be fair, swapping perks is something new to the Fallout world. The whole 'spirit' of being special is now more based on your point allocation  than it does card choice.
---
Just imagine how much faster you could lock pick/hack &amp; go. Let alone scrapping, smithing, and vending every single time. Less time doing the perk changes, and more time for the fun. 
---
Upvote for creativity.
---
Nukashine doesn't spoil. It turns into vintage nukashine.
---
I dealt with this but I use carnivore so now I can just eat a single piece of uncooked meat and my food bar is usually close to full the water issue is real tho. But if you just do a couple of events you’ll get plenty of aid.  I feel like I am always having to drop water and pawn off stimpacks on players to keep weight down.
---
&gt; selling a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet for 200 caps 
---
LOL. My initial pricing on all 1\* items was 100 caps per item, regardless of the quality. I considered nearly every 1\* item grist for the legendary vendor mill. I have since modified prices, albeit only slightly... more in line with the 200 cap selling bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Is it super low level? I'm just doing the main quest line, and I did a lot of side quests already. The Wendigo was level 30 Elite. The FIRST ONE THAT SPAWNED WAS LEVEL 40 FOR SOME FUCKED REASON.
---
I run my hvy weapons/shotgun/Melee build (non zerkers). And here's a tip for you. The exploding attribute will eat durability just like TS. So if your stying for a sneak build it's not gonna work well for you cause the silencer ( witch does work wonders on sound cuts the durability almost in half.
---
My shot runs are modded for (in order of preference)
---
Damage
---
Range
---
Durability
---
Utility.
---
None of my shotguns use a muzzle mod. And all have the max duabulity that u can get for them. And yes they are all combat shottys
---
civil war outfit is still more profitable.
---
gold+ cloth.
---
what do I really use gold for after upgrading my vault suit? I get like 20 caps am outfit. Cloth is so dang plentiful
---
Add a perk card that lets you dual wield mole miner gauntlets. I want to double slash everything in sight.
---
Speed demon and class freak are probably for the best. If you run straight with speed demon as is the game doesn't have time to load, with class freak itd be alot worse
---
BOS version 500-1000 caps
---
The code reseted so you will need to farm the new codes
---
I presume vortex wont work
---
Bro, the "cache" at the end, there was a box I couldn't picklock, THANKS BETHESDA, adn I think a fusion core, some ammo, and a LEVEL 15 (I'm level 26 damn it) Revolutionary Sword. Yikes.
---
Goddamnit. That blows. Takes so long to knock out that many drunken Events/Quests
---
Aww im on PC RIP
---
Would help to know your platforn.
---
And to the other joker's responding to you post
---
Ya'll might not be in the end game but I am and launching nukes your way
---
True long for VATS shots, Aligned long for sighted shots. Depends on your preference in rifles.
---
If you want "dirty" Sugar Bombs, there's always two boxes at the top of the Flatwoods church steeple, assuming someone didn't grab them already.  If they did, just server hop and grab your share.  There's also dozens of snaptail reeds along the river to make all the sugar you could ever want for making Sweet Rolls.
---
Thats terrifying! It was a very high level for me too. I was b-lining the main, only did the misstress of mystery early quests
---
Only if vendor is near camp for now. Hopefully fixed tomorrow!
---
I did not know the suit had the ability to bet more ore with harvesting. I thought its power was carry capacity. Damn, now I have to go make a set.
---
If you need a black combat armor helmet to tide you over I can hook you up. Its a pain in the ass getting mod for it
---
Correct! These are basically manual install. There is a mod manager for them, but not needed at this point as there’s really only a handful of useful mods.
---
I'm on PC thanks for actually responding
---
I have both robot arm plans (left and right) and both robot legs ( left and right) .  I do not have a robot chest.  I'll check tomorrow after the patch.  Thank you.
---
I'm on PC
---
There is a recipe that uses intestines from a Sheepsquatch quest that starts at Toxic Larry’s now, iirc.
---
I really want a ladder and a roof with a hatch.
---
Those camps are fun the first few time. I take note of the owner and if I see them again. I nuke it. Nuff said
---
Despite of vendor, you only have to ‘almost purchase’ the object, before confirm you can see the full name, no need to inspect the object
---
They straight up disappeared for my buddy. He was pissed when I flashed my gift emote in game a proof of life.
---
Also if you're bloodied - took me a bit to wrap my buddies head around the fact that he can't have bonus strength if he's dead 🤷‍♂️
---
No offense to the builder, but it looks like the Avalonian (I think that's what it's called, it's Avalon's ship) from lbp2 to me
---
Is it right above a staircase? Cause I have seen that and it was annoying. I moved the staircase, built the ceiling, then moved it back.
---
Google foo works great. Also it's on the wish list sticky on the Bethesda forums
---
I use Excavator as my main power armor set. I have two calibrated shock legs so I can carry +200 more. I reach 500 with Max strength
---
I like the superior mods. Max the traits you want. The only one I don't use a superior on is tuned vs hardened receivers. If you're bloodied or instigating you probably want hardened. Tuned is awesome for semi auto though. That's what I came away with in my testing anyway.
---
I sell the black officer one base or upgraded for like 100 caps at my vendor station. Stop by sometime. PS4 agent_august
---
To each their own I guess I roll all the way thru it.
---
Yours is fine, but the person I'm replying to said
---
&gt; Explosive railway rifle is a lot of fun. I had a one-star version and it was great at headshots,
---
Ya know I literally just did that quest and I couldnt help but laugh
---
Wow, my current character has minimal strength so getting that would help offset my carry limitations tremendously.
---
The grind is real. I've got the capacity, refrigerator, armor, lead lined, and just butt the camera nv mod. I think im done.
---
Known bug. It's in the Bethesda fous sticky
---
It made me laugh because they did such a good reperesentation and want to nuke it after I was done.
---
Literally just about to do this one 😂
---
Damn, that sounds cool actually. How much did it cost? I didn't get the game until launch day, and actually met grahm on my very first day in flatwoods. I don't remember what he had, all I can recall is a super sledge plan for like 3k or something
---
What do you sell maps for?
---
That is still damn low. The going rate for a 1\* lvl 50 bloodied deathclaw gauntlet was 1000-2000 caps before vending started. I bet a lot of your sales are traders who buy to resell. At 200 caps I would if the prefix was right. 
---
I am expecting the price to resettle near previous market value in time. It just doesnt make sense to grind for an hour plus to find some trade-able legendary items and then sell them for what would take me 2 minutes to get in caps. The 1\* price has always centered around a roughly 1 days worth of caps.
---
I got it from a vendor so it dropped for someone
---
I can absolutely tell the difference. I got the Responders fireman outfit and it is distinctly different from the Firebreathers one.
---
Many hundreds, along with the other marine gear he was selling. Definitely not thousands though
---
The dead tourists is a random spawn.
---
No the other vaulta are still currently not available nor do they have quests.
---
As to other quest you haven't done I would look on the Bethesda forums at the previous patch notes
---
What mutations/perks mitigate pylon damage? I just spam stimpaks.
---
Also, you can use your camera to locate the imposter body.
---
Yeah. You price a low weight 1\* weapon below 100 caps and I will buy it just to turn it into scrip.
---
Gotcha! Will check that out 😁
---
Nah man it’s good. I’ll have to look for the tactical helmet to tide me over. Thanks though :)
---
Make sure that they are actually marked as equipped first. I had purchased the "gift" emote and it took forever for it to actually show up. Had to quit out a few times and retry equipping the emote...it finally works now.
---
Mmmmm, ionized meat.
---
yeah I still cheap too and move product. I always wonder if the resellers are turning profit.. I just don't like all that junk in my box. legendaries are too easy to come by so I can get enough for script without effort.
---
I got it on PS4. I have tried and tried to get the Tattered Field Jacket to no avail. Got lucky with the Responders Fireman outfit. Finally a benefit to my constant re-rolling. XD
---
If you want I can sell ya my super dupered Excavator right leg with calibrated shocks. Each leg gives +50 and the full set gives you +100
---
If you mean pressing R1 to expand to the variations, there was no option to.
---
🤔 I don’t remember if I was. I will have to be sure to keep it under. I normally do but I’ve been making a lot of ammo.
---
I just love the droll tone of the workers
---
Yeah sometimes had to build things in a certain order. Like the roof prevented a lot of things from being built up high, like pictures. So you put the pictures up then place the roof. The staircase sounds like a good plan to provide a support you can remove later. It should be removable if the roof is touching another piece.
---
Thats crazy, id of taken that in a second
---
Than you for the offer but I think I’ll build up my own set. I like the adventure of finding materials. Plus I’m broke as crap. =D
---
Ooh. Theoretically possible to have gotten it then, unless vendors didn't have 200 caps each at the time.
---
Sorry, you'll wear the gear gawd blessed you witb.
---
haha
---
They've been doing that for me since the Fasnacht event happened.
---
It totally screwed up my immersion by being too much like real life.
---
They did only have 200 each :\
---
DUMB
---
Have any Bethesda games *ever* had actual ladder climbing?
---
It's brown.
---
Treasure maps, disease cures, plans, magazines, quest/event items...
---
PS4?
---
Apparently someone found out renaming your camera makes it start registering the photos again.
---
For a while.
---
I haven't had the issue, but its worth a try
---
They shouldn't be equal
---
Melee cant stay back and just pop shot shit so melee should be more powerful esp if you run bloodied melee and the more hardcore enemies can one hit kill you... Its the tradeoff
---
No xb1 sadly
---
Speaking of...where can I find a decent kilt?
---
I would love to see this happen, possibly get some type of reward for helping someone else out.
---
That’s the only thing stopping me from accepting team invites. I would love to accept all of them but I’m just worried about my camp. I’m sure most people wouldn’t do anything but until a feature is implemented I can’t. There’s a big difference between a friend you trust with your base and a brand new team member.
---
It bothers me more that the plasma cores use the same model as fusion cores instead of looking like the ones that are actually loaded into the weapon.
---
NP!  You can control what it produces at the terminal, similar to the ammo plant.  IIRC, salsbury steak is the best to make for satiation/weight efficiency.
---
Same. After reading all these posts and comments about people being fucked over I don’t even bother accepting them. Even then I can’t even pull up the invites on the menu(been like that for me since beta) and I have no useful charisma perks for group play 
---
Solo 4ever
---
I love using the crossbow, I just wish there was some cool mods for them. The sight leaves much to be desired. Still trying to figure it out and chameleon makes it a real pain.
---
It would be great to see this added in
---
I too love how it is. Are they thinking of nerfing it? I carry around 2 backpacks, one with fridge mod for regular use and the other is high capacity one to help over encumbered. Pretty handy
---
On a positive note you can get the BoS Recon Rifle plan at the terminal to the right outside of Fort Defiance after getting the military id.
---
request unclear, it is now a microwave.
---
That would remove the cap sink with people fast travelling vendor to vendor looking for that particular item so I doubt they'd do this
---
Ran into the same guys trap base twice.  He didn't kill the first time, it launched you off the top of the westek sat dish. The second time, I was on my alt. He followed me up, we waved at each other as I pressed the button. Some of these guys are pretty creative. Mine can kill anyone any level almost guaranteed, but it's not as funny as falling off a sat dish!
---
Carnivore mutation and ionized meat from nuke zones is how I beat food spoilage. :)
---
I've gotten it as a reward from one of my first ever enclave events. I think it was dropped connection in watoga, if that helps
---
Bran the wheely wheely legs no feeley
---
I've got it. Didn't even know it was rare. Need it?
---
Yeah I think I might have better luck farming enclave events if it’s true that other players can buy it first
---
I have a locked house and a guest house, too! I always hope people figure out what it’s supposed to be.
---
I must have gotten the plan at some point since the beta because I’ve never used raider under armour until yesterday, and I was able to craft shielded.
---
Yeah I’d definitely buy it off you as I’ve been farming all day for it but no luck so far
---
It's the only way to make fasnacht sausages
---
I filled to roof of my buddys house with vault boy cutouts he didn't notice for two weeks. I enjoyed him bitching about how he had no build budget
---
Note to self:
---
If camp getting nuke countdown, log off for 5 minutes.
---
It’s not telling me I need any perks but I’ve equipped all of the perks that would be necessary for something like this and still nothing happens.
---
This and have an option to sell ammo at 1/2 cap. And fix ammo sales, it's broken.
---
Does your username have any special meaning. Mine is because I love doctor who.
---
No I have tried with all junk in my stash and all junk on my person.
---
What worked for me (and learned from here) was to scrap what ever the turrets are on. That SHOULD put the invisible turret into storage where it'll then appear in your list.
---
Can’t you buy it at the enclave vendor, or has that changed?
---
I would agree with you if perks were much harder to be swapped out.... if they were permanent like previous games. But they’re so easy to swap now, why not make it easier. It would be kinda nice to have different builds and have to rely on others but we don’t completely have to.
---
It would be lovely if we all ended up on the same server at the same time. The friendliest, most helpful wasteland ever.
---
That’s the place I’ve been server hopping at but I saw a post that said other players can buy the mask before you but I’m not sure if it’s true.
---
I dunno...
---
I have speed demon and food was never a concern. Pair it with carnivore and you can find food/meat everywhere. Kill a dog/yuan gai/crab etc etc = Free food.
---
Hell I've been playing since beta and all ive been doing is just piddly spunk. I created a whole new character sfter i realized my whole build was stupid. But now, after some studying  ive come up with a build and I'm doing a re-play, a re-do if you will.
---
Oh I see that you said that in your post, my apologies for the misunderstanding! It seems every time I did an enclave event I was awarded a different piece of the Urban Scout Armor. Might be worth to hedge your bets on doing enclave events a few times?
---
Rad Shield is making a good amount caps
---
Yes. You cant get the scrap collector in you camp if you place high. I'm in there with one character.
---
Yep. That little park spawns all kinds of things.
---
I'm at the begining so yeah sure, what's your Bethesda?
---
I noticed that some legendary corpses don't spawn the legendary loot until a good 10-20 seconds after it's dead...
---
You can, but it takes some tweaking to get you levels right. Let me find pictures
---
Lol well if you need help finding junk! I'm probably going to make a Junk guide as a counterpart to this one
---
Sucks cuz I just got the stealth boy mod and I want to ball out on the HUD but now I have to wait.
---
Probably better off as scrip :\\
---
That, my friend, is really good to know. How did you figure that out?
---
Yeah I might have to just try that instead, I’ve seen a couple people say that’s where they got their mask but no worries thanks for the help!
---
I paid full price and I’ve always been happy playing this game.
---
Considering that as it is now, night basically doesn't exist, it would be nice for there to be you know something to indicate day and night. The only place where it's actually different is the heavily forested Mire.
---
I repair camp stuff time, as well as hunt down whatever I spawned on their camp.  I wish I could fix broken fences.  I don't really need or want the credit, though.  
---
If the player can opt to be an "anonymous donor", I think that would be better.
---
I wouldn't want a lvl 50 player spending caps while traveling all over the map to give my lvl 200+ character a thumbs up just for being a decent human being.  Basic courtesy should be free and without expectation of reward or acclaim.  The resource expenditure of fixing broken turrets is the equivalent of picking up after my dog after she shit on your lawn during our evening walk.  I don't deserve a parade for that, it's just basic decency.  I already got the benefit of looking at the stuff you've got in your vending machine, regardless of the fact that I might not need any of it.  "The Hunt" is good enough for me, but I also like flea markets in real life and accepted the fact that I might walk away with one huge score a year and the rest is just potentially valuable stuff to someone else.
---
By VATs'ing my way through WestTek right after I got the gun.  Lots of "ugh" "agh" red-rimmed vision but the health bar barely budged.  Then I stopped and stood there sure enough they started chipping away my health again.  Did a few times to verify.
---
Hell yeah, fucking awesome idea.
---
I haven't run into one yet but they're pretty hilarious. I'd like for the C.A.M.P. system to have more ability to build such death contraptions, I think it's a fun part of the game and people should be cautious in other people's camps. It's not like you lose that much when you die. Though fast traveling to the middle of the camp probably needs to be fixed so it's at least fair :-p
---
Delightfully devilish, seymour
---
I would love this, I hate leaving something with a sliver of health.
---
Then people will price grilled radstag at 25k and just use it as spoil free storage
---
They're called Broken ProSnap Camera, the other broken camera's don't work. I got the quest from just picking up the camera and I believe they mentioned that they added that in in one of the patch notes because sometimes the bucket list note would glitch out. Idk if it'll work or if you do have to personally find it on the tourist, but I do definitely have the correct kind so I figured it's at least worth a shot.
---
Maybe I was doing it wrong. Lol
---
Well you have more budget now lol
---
Maybe I'd do that the day we can hot swap perk card builds. I too often find myself forgetting to swap back to my build after using them for bargaining or repairing etc.
---
Yep! You can find normal shovels near graveyards etc and I got a 3 star Instigating shovel from the Purveyor
---
Join r/Market76. They should be able to help you out
---
I have heard spotlights make a difference as when a spotlight sees an enemy all turrets will light them up.  Can't 100% confirm if true but since putting a spotlight over my Brahmin I haven't seen Bessie die like before so give it a try
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Yeah they need to add these more complex objects in... there's a couple existing items that won't work right now without the more advanced camp items. The interval counter and the powered speakers for example.
---
Lol true but its the idea that if a neighbor gets better business or crosses me I can rain down death and destruction on him 😂 now no more. I have no problem getting a bounty on my head
---
I think I’d like to see a rating system.
---
YES ima get one and name my char digmon
---
&gt; This is so cool! Post pics of your restaurant please!
---
Thanks! and sure :) [\[Video\]](https://youtu.be/2h-qPgHeagc) , [\[4 Imgs\]](https://imgur.com/a/dsdn9wy)
---
Thank you for the masterlist of recipes!
---
&gt; You're going to need to replace the Heavy weapons perks with One Handed ones to get the most out of your rolling pin
---
To be honest, my build is revolving around flame weapons like the flamethrower but I haven't gotten to that level yet.
---
Biv quests. :)
---
When you make the post, put: [Discussion] Price check (insert level) (insert number of stars) instigating the dragon. They usually are pretty good about responding
---
Or diglet!!
---
Will do
---
To be fair its subjective what other people have or want. What you consider garbage I've found great for filling a few new niches I was missing out on. I would love a preview but Bethesda want us spending more caps on travel so they'll never do it
---
if an item is undroppable, it will tell you when you try and drop it.
---
Do they spawn at junk piles?
---
I'm mrduckmd1
---
Hehe the good old bait and switch, just as a little question but I'm around level 15 now and I've gone a little too wild on the "Ooh let's explore there" and I am not quite sure where I should be questing?
---
Thank you! *^**^*
---
would be a silly concept, perhaps costs 50 caps to make (with everything else) and you can only get 10-25 salvageable caps from the pile remaining after detonation, i say 25 at max because of super duper
---
GT is knucklessyrup. Shoot me a message
---
Camden
---
Do you need another card?
---
I kinda enjoy wasting my fucking time.....also disconnected servers when you have four workshops is the best. This game is awesome🤔
---
Whitesprings for xp (middle of map the giant white building) the black part of the map towards the bottom by the towers there’s a building that gives you excavator power armor plans, very useful
---
This is what I had to do.
---
Would he 500 caps of pure profit as I'd hand it back.
---
Whatever works though. Wont be using the high capacity for a while, just wanted to skip the event grinding.
---
Last week, on Wednesday, my fiancée flew to New York for some nursing conference. A couple days before she left, I decided to take that Tuesday and Friday off from work. I got well over 40 hours of uninterrupted time on fallout. I stayed up well into the mornings and was back on before noon each day. Picking her up from the airport was a bit saddening, if I’m being honest. Dead games are the best games, I guess.
---
I'm on desktop rn, I appreciate both of your support though *^**^*
---
Ultracite armor plans are obtainable for free. They are not valuable. You complete the appropriate quest, you check the terminal, and boom, you have the full set, and you can craft as many suits as you want. 
---
I just left a camp where literally half of the plans listed were ultracite armor plans. More than a hundred plans, and more than 50% were obtainable, for free, through in game play. 
---
Mutton is only obtainable by killing the sheepsquatch. Mutton plans drop all the time from the sheepsquatch. There is no reason to have a stack of 25+ of them in your shop. 
---
I'm calling out two specific types of plans that make up about half of the inventory I see, more or less, that _have no value_. 
---
I'm all for people listing all the camp plans, and all the armor plans, and weapon mod plans, and everything else. Awesome, go nuts, please, keep doing this. I'm HUNTING for those few "wait, that's a thing?" plans that I haven't unlocked yet.
---
Ad? I’m confused. 😍
---
Have you tried placing a flat roof with a sloped roof on top of it? Sorry if I am misunderstanding the size of the loft
---
I'm on desktop rn, I appreciate your support though *^**^*
---
Automatically cooks raw meat we pick up and boils dirty water... sounds nice
---
I was just browsing reddit, thinking of doing this exact same thing tonight. I think I'll give it a shot then too.
---
I do all of these too, plus what others have posted...then I server hope until I find an untouched Whitespring Golf Shack, put on Weapon of Choice by Fatboy Slim, and kill me some ghouls.
---
I literally just horde canned dog food. With the good doggy perk, it cures so much hunger. AND it never spoils. Why bother with anything else?
---
You're right, sounds like modding isn't for you.
---
You're definitely not the only tiny home lover. I've got a 2x2 single story home with one of the squares as a porch. I'd also love a ladder option for a loft!
---
More of a circlejerk if anything lol. I'm not getting paid by anyone and I'm not in contact with Bethesda at all. Just wanted to say I'm glad this game is still being worked on. I loved it before and missed it while my xbox was gone, and I'm just happy I get to play it again.
---
You are a trusting soul, and I commend you. Hopefully no one takes advantage of your generosity.
---
If memory serves me right, you should be able to do the main story with little to no worries. Side quests, like Mistress of Mysteries and Mayor For A Day give you one-time only legendary weapons that are level specific. Max weapon level in this game is 45-50, depending on the weapon, so it's better to wait on those.
---
Main story wise, again if I recall properly, the biggest challenge will be end game nuke launching. The mission to do it can be a bastard, so team up or double up on your level.
---
Hopefully, more people chim in and can point you closer to the path than I. Best of luck.
---
I have a real life...I just play the game when I can...I love the CAMP...but not even paying attention to the dailies...if I get atoms I get em...if not..I was not trying for them anyway...just focusing on enjoying the game with the limited time I got. There is no other game I would rather be playing right now...and there is nothing I would rather do with my spare time other than game.
---
They'll be here once decrypted - https://nukacrypt.com/
---
This is how I picture you running around the map.. https://youtu.be/_1q8PFJ163w
---
Wow I never expected to get so many upvotes but it's great to hear Im not the only one who would like to see these in the game. Don't forget, the squeaky wheel gets the grease....(or something like that). I'm sure if we all make enough noise about our wants for this in game Bethesda would acknowledge it and place them in. And even if they were planning to put them in at a later date enough people asking might make that date earlier. I don't care if they respond to this post or yours. I just truly want to see this game be as amazing as it possibly can be.
---
Haha yeah it's so easy to get lost in the that looks cool moment and not fully know what your play style is
---
Thank you for the info!
---
I'll remake my build soon with these ideas in mind
---
I thought that was the point of the postman uniform
---
Need to add “canning”. 
---
We have all the ball jars lying around and tin cans - they should let us craft good quality food that doesn’t spoil or does so very slowly (72 in hours).
---
Don’t even need to make new recipes, just add “canned” versions of high end items - “tinned mirelurk queen steak”, “canned yao gui ribs”, etc...
---
I'm on desktop rn
---
I understand what your saying ,but hot swapping or not what you are saying isn't there anyway.  you stop getting new points to allocate at 50 but I'm 137 so I have 87 more cards than I have points.  I don't need to find someone to mod my guns or pick my locks.  but to have a quicker more organized way of swapping perk cards would improve all of our enjoyment of the game.
---
I can craft casual shielded underarmors.
---
the floor ones work a lot better then the wall mounted design.
---
I just wanna toss in to this something i saw in another post that I agree with 100%. Most of the High end recipes are way way too hard to farm. Like Scorched beast mixed meat stew. By the time you farm up all the parts it's all spoiled. The thing that takes Rollyjelly but not the easy to find Rollyjelly the crap RNG jelly.  Lastly the Cranberry meatball grinder can only be crafted with one type of SB meat that's a random drop. Also. Theres a few recipes that require Stangler bloom that only come from one small location in the mire.What a waste of time and it's more like work than fun.  Fix em lol
---
I found an awesome builder in game!  Realized we can build stuff in each other’s camps!  I have been lucky nobody messed with my camp when teaming up so far.
---
Try submitting a ticket - heard some people got help that way- I’ve heard mixed results from reinstalling
---
Same same
---
Same for me. Some people said server hopping works but I haven't gotten it to. Hoping this is patched tomorrow.
---
What platform?  I have seen some on PC—I assumed dev room.  But if you are on console....  PS4 by any chance?
---
Same happened to me. :/
---
I will keep this in mind for my later levels, thanks!
---
Right now as a level 19 with a rolling pin, glowing ghouls will drop kick me over a fence
---
Ticket is submitting. I will reinstall if there's no other work around. This sucks. Ty for the reply.
---
Ahh ok. Thank you for the response.
---
Last time I accepted an invite I got yelled at from some guy saying his friend was saying I was bullying him and then he threatened me saying he has plenty of high level guys who got his back. I had only been in the server about 5 minutes.
---
If you get attention from it, it's not charity but self advertising!!!
---
Give it another 6 months if you’re going to bother, it’s more stable but BSG still hasn’t fixed a lot of simple shit and it can be super frustrating.
---
I hate when people take advantage of this and abuse the lender its harsh, but the lender is so kind.
---
I bought the game with the full intention of having a bar/diner so Ive been focused on food crafting. I feel like certain recipes are great for all the time and cheap (glowing fungus soup, corn soup) while others are special and take some specific farming (brain bombs, bloatfly loaf, steeped teas). The farmed ones could def use a little buff since some are only twice as good as a simpler recipe, but take 3-4 times the ingredients.
---
This is appalachia. I'm fairly certain it's spelled "crick".
---
Mr_Awesome001 sent friend request we’ll do a cap trade as deposit
---
PC, no dev room shenanigans, no idea how I got it though.
---
All right.  But the melee is horribly bugged with first hit misses .... the guns may be weak in comparison (mostly due to the best being nerfed because of duplication of the most desired but ridiculously programmed to be narrowed drop rates), but at least they don't put you in the middle of a mess of ghouls or mutants, while lags and first hit misses cause massive damage being taken (the melee for the monsters is just as "buffed" while their guns are just as "nerfed").  I see no need for anything but weight reductions on them.
---
I'm on PC as well but I'm mainly sticking to my chef's rolling pin for novelty until I can get a flame weapon. Ty though *^**^*
---
Diglet!!!!!!!
---
I couldn’t decide where to put the vending machines so I shoved them in my ass.

I was happy there until some mod mentioned not swearing so much.. Place is losing it's lure..

The new alchohol recipes are kick ass. I have all the alchohol perk cards and have been doing dailys with Biv to get those awesome new recipes.

So the bar doesn't visually fill, but the crit effect does happen?
---
No it’s not just you. Imo the blood looks like red paint splattered over the armor. Unless it’s supposed to be red paint since real blood wouldn’t stay on the armor very long.
---
I’ve been able to get in by server hopping
---
not enough
---
I feel bad for them out there trying to grind to 50.  all the while there little platform is sitting there with the generator busted.  I've fix more things on others camps than I have my own and it's a good feeling.
---
Chaos is a laddah
---
Bookmark that site and you’ll never need to ask again. Or search
---
Ill give that a go tomorrow when I get back on. Thanks and Ill let you know if that fixed it.
---
More complex food should have a longer shelf life, you are seasoning it after all.
---
You can get it from any glowing animal
---
Ill take any amount. Name your price
---
Old maxium from wow. Was aimed a a stupid rogue but still applies to all players
---
" Hey NUMBNUTZ your DPS is a big fat ZERO when your DEAD"
---
Same then wander a zone looking for the perfect camp spot and taking workshops in the area or knocking out good events in the mire/bog.  Will hop to player vendors if there are a few clustered together.
---
Rarely venture in the forest, ash heap, or TV anymore which is a shame, as ash heap and TV both have a great atmosphere.
---
I just eat dog food and collect/cook meat only if I'm near a vendor.
---
No yes
---
I still need my lifetime supply of cram!
---
Mostly, at this point it's just farming:
---
- Sell my marine tactical helmets and drugs for the 1400 in Flatwoods. Hit the motel and look for lead, if needed.
---
- Hit Grafton High School and farm the rubber, mutants and whatever event is triggered. 
---
- Hit Lady Jane's, farm the two spawn points (if there's anything good) then go near there and hit the one spot that has a Royal Jelly.
---
- Go to Charleston Train Station, hit the Grafton monster that spawns down there and then try to get the wandering Responder vendor bot to show up. Then hit the fire station and get the lead, if needed.
---
- Hit Watoga and look for dog food.
---
- Hit Appalachian Antiques and look for Brotherhood gear.
---
- Finally, hit National Satellite Array and West Tek and farm the mutants.
---
About once a week, I'll spend the session server hopping near Treetops for tick blood (if I need Stimpaks to use/sell) or the dam in The Mire for a spawn point (by the route 65 sign on the map), hoping to get rare plans to sell.
---
this guy SCPs
---
Wait, you have to say you’re not in contact with Bethesda if you say you enjoy the game?  Do people actually believe in paid reddit shills?
---
Nuke them then, make your house just outside the zone.
---
Dumpsters were there....rest of outside stuff came about a week before the vendor came in.
---
How would it be worse?
---
Nooo thanks. I was really tired of seeing my base (or others) destroyed because people were bored, or "in their spot" or just because they liked the design and thought it would be funny to trash it.
---
Yep
---
It’s being released with the dlc tomorrow. It’s part of the rewards from the event
---
Eh
---
Just had this happen to me yesterday and has been 24 hours since it first started. On ps4 btw. Not sure where I left off on my character or if I was near my usual camp area which was near whitesprings but I guess I'll know if it's ever fixed
---
oh I thought we had a max cap of 20% running/20% sneak movement, etc
---
Thanks for the info, must be glitched for me because I was so happy when I found a broken prosnap just lying there but didnt recieve a quest when picking it up. Appreciate everything you let me know!
---
I appreciate that.
---
 I found, at least for me, putting the turrets on something small, like a 1/4 size floor or even certain tables helps IMMENSELY with the ease of this.
---
I'd take the 5K offer.
---
I put the exact same weapon in my vending machine for 2250 and it took over a week to sell.... .and that only after i reduced the price to 1850.
---
Not much as y'all be asking ridiculous prices for broken shit
---
do we have a list of what the perks actually do and stack, etc in the current play state anywhere?
---
Our overseer?
---
I've had this happen to me yesterday, any luck logging on yet?
---
Others have answered your questions but I just wanted to share my setup. I use Troubleshooters armor and a Vampire's cryolator. This allows me to slow down the ISQ and barely use any stimpaks.
---
I get my caps and scrip I do horde events launch at least 3 nukes restock on nuka grenades restock serums if I need to and then I’ll look at peoples camp vendor stuff.
---
And real blood doesn’t stay red, it turns a sort of rusty reddish- brown.  
---
I started to get it then thought twice and was like naaah
---
Damn! Should have been more patient.
---
"I was just scrapping.  I promise I'm done honey....no don't leave"
---
I'm not sure what they're g going for but I'd imagine 1k is a reasonable price
---
Lol I see them every time I log on, and it takes like 2-3 shots from my TS level 45 lever action to kill each one
---
We have the tato salad surprise, many soups, cobblers, and I would suggest a steeped melon blossom chai for a drink.
---
You must not sell regularly because I sell ultra cite plans alllll daaaay looong. Sometimes people just want to buy things instead of hunting for them :)
---
Any explosive is likely worth putting on a vendor.  I’d buy the 10mm if you’re on PS4
---
Yes, I'm on PC
---
What console?
---
Indeed it would. I might pick it up for a raider build I plan on making eventually but wait until the atomic shop updates later on once the new patch drops to see what new items and sales there are. If there’s nothing good I might just pick it up since there’s still a week left on it.
---
Eeeeeeeeh
---
their from the dev room someone offered me one he said got from the dev room I didn't respond because I dont want to get banned
---
Because 90% of the people left are those who will apologize for them endlessly and just write anything off as trivial.
---
Came here to comment the same thing. Would’ve been nice if the prize bot brought along at least one can 😂
---
It's not the middle, perse. It's wherever the C.A.M.P module thing itself was originally placed down. From there it just depends on where they built up from there. Mine for instance, spawns you at the front door.
---
This would make the game at least 10% more fun tbh
---
I see you too are a man of class.
---
Dang
---
Do they still have the glitch from FO4 where they would be shut off if you left/fast traveled away and came back later? That was a PITA to the Nth degree.
---
Imagine having some of Ark Survival Evolves building sets in game. I’d build a damn castle if I could.
---
&gt; If you're main weapon is a rolling pin, wouldn't gladiator perks make more sense?
---
I'm only temporarily using the rolling pin. I'll be swapping it out for a flamethrower once I level up.
---
Thank you for the info, especially on the watoga farming area!
---
People have been asking for this since day one... At least we have nice cameras :\^)
---
This also happened to me at Bivs. Sever hop fixed it
---
I wright that stuff down.  Bro it's like a business.  Gotta stay on top of it.
---
I guess not, but I did just for transparency's sake.
---
My herd mentality works perfectly with class freak and strange in numbers?
---
Happy to share some advice.
---
About the same as Todd Howard measuring Bobby pins I'd wager.
---
oooh! okay, well that makes it a lot easier. Thanks!
---
It’s not. I could fire a nuke at it the other day since I tried on the map and I was allowed to launch it.
---
I'm sorry you've had this issue.
---
I just "returned" and have been enjoying the game too, but after I had completed the new content, it's really hard to find a reason to play. Loving the survival too.
---
And my PS4 has some serious issues with loading the map. A Lot of times I am adventuring in a world without buildings, trees, cars, water etc. This wouldn't be an issue if it was minor loading problems, but these cases happen often and last a long time.
---
The game is great and I can't wait for the new main missions.
---
Yeah they work together, one just counts the penalties. But healing factor saves you stimpack uses passively, at the cost of worse combat stimpacks and chems.
---
Hahah apple ape cha cha
---
The health benefits of raw water are indisputable!
---
the wall ones will need to be turned off and on again in order to use on server change or leaving the area. the floor ones work without doing so
---
With Good Doggy perk the best stable food by a wide margin is......dog food.  Ugh.
---
Player vending is really cool, great way to get rid of ammo that you don't use. But it was a bit glitchy when I was just trying to set mine up.
---
I've had this happen to me yesterday and there's a bunch of posts about it. It's been 24 hours for me with no resolution.
---
That's good to hear.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
The game should note, in the list of what is for sale in the camp, how many people have died in the camp bounds.
---
Well then, that sucks. 😕
---
I haven't even tried the new content, just messing around with player vending and finally completing my heavy combat armor set. Vendors having all of their plans at once instead of it being RNG makes it so much easier.
---
You're right the instant perma part is definitely a bad idea and would cause a lot of wrongful bans.  Someone could easily sell a stack of duped weapons for 1 cap a piece in their vending machine and get random players banned.  I just would like to see the scrip limit lifted, the legendary grind is fun and dropping items sucks. 
---
Got a bit passionate with my wording, the duping situation frustrates me.  Before they ban anyone they should certainly find proof.    
---
Maybe some day we will see an attempt at player tracking and anti-cheat in F76
---
You don't have to hunt for them. You complete the quest that gives you a set of ultracite armor, you check the terminal, and the plans are RIGHT THERE. 
---
They fixed that MONTHS ago.
---
I spawned into the wall of a kill camp yesterday.  the owner must have felt bad for me because after he edited his camp(I would normally just spawn close if it happens) they took me on a tour.  Its obviously a trap house and I've already fell for the bait. I thought whelp if this person took this much time to build this and manipulate me to trusting them, doing them a solid and playing along wouldn't be a big deal.  Then as they go to show me the actual trap. they emote like crazy to make sure I didn't trigger it.  I was like wow dude respect and went on to buy a bunch of items, friendly salute.  would shop again.
---
Oh I know :) I’m just saying some people would randomly pick them up than to do that~ they’re buying convenience lol
---
You are seeing what it looks like, It will change whatever power armor you apply it on to what you see in that picture
---
Had the same problem just wait it out for 24 or so hours and it should start working again.  Meanwhile play on lower characters. Its a known bug an thats the generic response you get from a ticket. It eventually started working again.
---
Thanks for letting me know..it sucks it happened to you too but hopefully this happened to enough people that they fix it quickly.
---
Did you ever get this resolved man? I'm on ps4 too so just wondering
---
Yeah bc they can’t have any legendary effects that make them hard to kill. They’re fleshier in PA then in regular armor bc of how the game works- with the exception of a really good tank build but it’s definitely Assassins Sentinel armor
---
WoW was 15 years ago...
---
All the tech for multiplayer online games has improved massively since then. Part of wow’s initial server issues was its massive sales. And while mmo’s were fairly well developed then, they were much less so than multiplayer games today.
---
Comparing it to Fo76 in these ways is pretty silly.
---
Oh sorry then lol
---
People still care about pvp in this game?
---
f
---
An explanation: Some PA skins override the original armor, making it look like one armor on all the rest. This means your X01 and T60 look like T51 with that skin.
---
If nothing else, plants like soot flower and aster should have max spoilage time. I'm fine with needing to collect fresh meat and garden vegetables, but don't make the herbs spoil before you can do that
---
Thanks. I really can't play the lower level ones. I'm so spoiled by mutations and so many hours invested into the right build and everything lol.
---
I'm wearing Sentinal assassin marine so if they do happen to find me before they are dead I'll probably win the battle of the tanks.
---
Yeah tomorrow I think they have a new patch so hopefully this is one of the things they fix. There's a guy who has been locked out for over two weeks so they've known about the issue since at least then
---
Yep.  You set your rates reasonable, and a level 250-350 player shows up and sacks your whole machines (either to scrip or sell at HUGE mark ups)
---
You set your rates higher to discourage that, and the players that really need the improved legendaries can't afford them.
---
Before player vending, I got 90% of my used items (armour and weapons) from vendor protectrons for reasonable rates (I tend to get nothing useful on drops and even the best God-Tier weapons sell for about 500 caps at a vendor).... presumably discarded by higher level players that no longer needed them.  Now they hoard anything with value or scrip it.  And because they are at 25000 max caps already, they just travel around buying up anything they see that has value.
---
Yes it sucks that it doesnt work. I stopped using speed demon because of it.
---
Yeah but it did get nerfed pretty good I’ve got a set too and it never feels like I get the full effect anymore
---
Tell me, what other content is there? Everything else is done for players that have been here from the start and each new "content update" takes 3 days tops to finish.
---
Also you can get a legendary that reflects melee damage when blocking. It reflects the sheepSquatches attack.
---
Power armour mod that plays music when you walk
---
It literally says it changes the entire appearance lmao, just gotta read more before posting
---
I thought it was funny.
---
It's not even in the same realm as before. Still the best though.
---
What's this?
---
I’d definitely make better stat food if it didn’t go bad in my vending machine or stash. Slaughtering a few SBs could go a long way...
---
I felt the same way lol all mortal again hahaha. was kinda bummed my main is 220 thought i wouldn't get him back.  it just eventually started working about 24 hours give or take. Haven't had a problem since then.
---
Good idea, too many dumbasses "roleplaying" raiders lol
---
Idk it’s kinda RNG now. I mostly run unyielding weapon weight w AP refresh now since it always works and I can do massive melee dmg
---
Some of the skins look VERY different on different armors. The Nukashine paints, for example. On the X0-1, there is gold plating on the face, whereas on the other armors you don't get that. The pictures of single armor give a decent idea, but aren't identical and can't be because of the different armor shapes and sizes. And why not just take a few pictures of different armors if you are bothering to put up 5 pictures anyway?
---
What's on the Broadsider?
---
And the Plague Rider made all your PA look like X-01. Which was a bonus 👍
---
Camden park, the amusment park on the west side of the map
---
It literally turns whatever power armor you apply it to into a pale rider t-51.
---
For example the black rider power armor turns excavator power armor into the black rider. There is no variants for each set of power armor. It all has a static look which you see in the pictures
---
Got the rest of the random encounter coordinates!

I'm excited to see these maps finished, so please hit me back with the results as soon as you get them!
---
What? The description says NOTHING about that. At the very least they should have made THAT clear, don't you think?
---
Game loads. Character moves. Everything is wrong.
---
Lol. FO76.
---
South and west for now, then north to Morgantown, then north west to Grafton.  Take your time, and explore everything.  Read every note and listen to every holotape. Once you 25ish, then it’s Ash Heap, etc.   the Overseers journey takes you to various places in the approx order.    Wait on Mire and Cranberry bog until you are 40ish or higher.  The general faction questlines you go through while doing the main questline are Responders, Raiders (I love Rose, she’s a trip), Free States, Brotherhood of Steel, and Enclave.  I’ve just finally getting to the enclave, at 85.  Lol.  It can be done earlier, I’ve spent a lot of time doing events, workshops, etc.  
---
TLDR; explore and have fun.  If you get into an area too tough, grab a friend or go somewhere else in game for a while.
---
Build some random items untill your camp budget is maxed then they can’t change anything. Idk I don’t care much if someone adds stuff to my camp though but I think that would help.
---
Oh, I read the description in it's entirety. That was never stated. I guess THAT'S the problem, then.
---
Every single time I've had the event fail is because someone keeps grabbing a pylon before I can (I easily tank all 3, got dozens of super stims and nuka cola) and then runs off and dies, either them or another random grabs its again over and over again, and we fail. I would just wait at the pylon but when you're already tanking 2 and everyones shooting at an invincible enemy and not at the adds sometimes you gotta move.
---
I am having a great time too. I hope the game really runs forever and that it continue to get better.
---
Plans/recipes, decent 3*weapons, ammo
---
It started working after 15 hours or so.  Now i refuse to join worlds where someone has my camp position to avoid this.
---
They have a high stagger rate with every hit and tend to hit a couple of times in a row. Basically because they can stagger anything they prevent actions like healing and reloading and that helps make them difficult. At least that’s my experience with them.
---
Roger, thanks for info.
---
Dumb
---
Reactive plates vs the bloodied melee is funny
---
That's a new bug.
---
And a melee and gun user has to deal with the same problems.
---
Melee has so much stacking its crazy.
---
There is nothing unique to guns like melee.
---
No flat damage mutation (melee has 2), no flat damage special, 75% anti armor vs 36% (which doesnt force anti armor as a required legendary prefix), no food buffs for damage (all meats for melee).
---
Only drugs have damage for both but melee can pop multiples there too.
---
Its a wonky balance that I'll never understand why beth won't even look into any of it.
---
 melees only downside is playstyle choice. Not numbers, not even close.
---
The fact that tse had to add 200% (boosted to 300% with demo expert) more damage to even compete makes it obvious.
---
Aluminum, Screws, Useful weapons and armour (guns and armour that you would actually use, nothing that is heavy and has no real damage).  Maps (if prices set reasonably) High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass.  10mm, Fusion Cells, 5.56 Ammo (set at 1 cap per round)
---
I sell about 8000 caps of product a day.  With a 25000 maximum on caps, one third of that maximum a day is pretty much all that is useful to do.
---
Oddly enough, Power Armour plans that go for 6600 caps at the vendor bots, don't even sell for 1/6th of that for players (Jet-pack plans are everywhere now, being that they are just about the most common drop at SBQ events right now - saw a guy with five T-60 plans for 50 caps each in his vending machine.  Clearly he couldn't move them faster than he was finding them).
---
I just want a real, solid balance pass - fix armor rating making bullet sponges, spawning mechanics that screw low/mid level players constantly (and in general), fix all the various weapons that are useless/bugged/broken - plasma, laser, etc... fix all the busted perks and mutations/interactions, fix/rebalance stealth post nerf/bug, add some kind of “cold storage” that doesn’t tax the servers...
---
Then stop the over use of RNG to create the illusion of content - a craftable legendary system, stop with the ProSnap rng type shit. Add
---
More actual repeatable content through procedurally generated dungeons and mini bosses with mechanics to learn. Add an actual “rebuild” aspect by having us build
---
Faction based cities - add selectable “server clusters” with some level of permancy/differentiation. 
---
Also stop with the stupid, intentionally ridiculous atom dailies like “take a picture of megaton while in New Vegas while killing a daedra” crap and just add more new, attractive cosmetics. Stop with the non cosmetic micros and just up the cosmetic quality like with the horsemen power armors.
---
Make legendaries cooler - mutate multiple times, grant them random powers as they do: laser eye attacks, stealth fields, bloodied effects, etc...
---
What fast travel glitch?
---
Yea, that counter is literally almost non-functional when not paired with an interval timer.
---
Cool. I'll never set foot in survival due to how hilariously imbalanced pvp is.
---
And i don't even run PA.
---
This is why you should always buy before turning in daily scrips, so if you get a wooden 3star you can get some scrips back before it implodes.
---
They def hit harder then deathclaws....
---
I thought we were having steamed clams?
---
Geese can be terrifying. Let alone a mutated 3 headed hissing monstrosity.
---
flop around to see what crap people think are worth caps
---
Most of the horde events have low level bosses that drop low level legendaries anyway. I only do those events to scrip the reward.
---
If ur on Xbox id Gladys buy this!
---
Oh man...YES! I absolutely feel your pain. This unprovoked assholery happened to me today, and I swear it felt like it was some sort of planned Scorchbeast military operation to destroy me and my camp because I keep getting away. Same routine...thought I heard some flapping outside, maybe from above, but it seemed distant. Next thing I know my camp is being destroyed by a bastard Scorchbeast, but just one and no Mothman finale.  Though three beasts had come after my boyfriend at a neighboring vendor station a couple of hours earlier.  Here's some [crappy pics](https://i.imgur.com/xF36j42.jpg) of the [damage](https://i.imgur.com/RBaBUk3.jpg) and one of what it should look like on a [normal day](https://i.imgur.com/kvxz7NE.jpg)
---
Had to leave it like this while I went scrounging for junk to repair everything for the next hour. After [yesterday's shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/br5j8d/well_this_was_certainly_an_interesting_day/) I can't wait for the next phase of random destruction that shows up on my doorstep.
---
The spawn point item will be abused to trap people
---
When you fast travel to someone’s Camp and get stuck in the foundation/walls/ etc and can’t get out unless if you ft again
---
I said steamed hams! It’s a regional dialect!
---
Bad Wolf Satellite 5...where Rose took in the essence of the TARDIS and became Bad Wolf 😁  You’re the first person to make a comment about it. I love it! And it’s nice to share a name with another Whovian!!
---
That 3rd week plan is real.
---
The loyalty article on anthem really showed how it was just pure mismanagement.
---
But in general the tech has improved for multiplayer games, while player expectations have either increased along with it, or just excused the new trend of “live service/patch culture” where companies rush out half broken, barely beta quality games and promise to “improve” (finish) them as they go. 
---
Fo76 made this glaringly obvious. I beta’d WoW, it was more polished and complete when I started beta (comparable to its time and standards) than Fo76 was at release, by miles.
---
Yep there might be no way around that which is why I said a fix for the bug.
---
Oh man. That's awful. I know it's bad to be defendant on a game but it's become such a part of my routine and I'd hate to go two weeks without it  really hoping tomorrow fixes it.
---
Fuck me that's a lot of content that I am gonna enjoy the shit out of, thanks!
---
Your welcome good luck out there if your new to the game
---
there is a while completely different set of servers people play on specifically for it
---
Ha - I bought 30 Disease Cure for cheap off someone... was it you? :) I never remember to make them and prefer to just have a big stash of them to dip into!
---
Yup. 1 shot build and get 1 shot. Many hit build and tank many hits. Those are the options
---
I guess but it still shouldn't happen.
---
exact same thing I do lol
---
Yeah.
---
My slightly damaged camp structures trigger my OCD so bad.
---
I want a map of the creatures that have set spawns.
---
I see, I'm going past 24 hours at this point
---
Certainly not a very good business plan for them in a game that you can easily go and get more stuff, and you have a stuff and cap maximum set by your Stash box and wallet upper limit.  But whatever.  I've seen some pretty decked out stores selling a whole variety of magnificent stuff for a minimum of 3000 caps.  If it's for the show and tell aspect, and not for sales, they might be accomplishing exactly what they want.  
---
They have, however, essentially eliminated the ability of a level 25-50 player to get decent gear for that next level of monster they are now encountering coming out of the forest into the other areas of the game.
---
Well I'm on ps4 welp
---
yeah, NPC vendors don't work that way, unless it was something sold to them.
---
Same here fingers crossed
---
Yes until I fought FolkAuto who wears PA
---
true but then you can’t put more walls round it
---
I think they should add it back bc people can trap you in unbreakable Walls now and you have to fast travel away just to leave. Like at the very least make doors breakable the bounty for the door is probably cheaper than fast traveling away
---
My most recent one is a strip club that has a “peep show” room. It’s one by one with an open powered gate, There is a garage door brick window overlay and two plain walls. If you sit on the couch facing the overlay garage/brick window it closes the open powered gate, opens the overlay to reveal a vault girl statue, and turns on flame throwers and radiation emitters to burn you from behind :) 
---
It’s triggered by two trip wires hidden inside the couch and you can stand behind the peep show window when it opens and watch them burn
---
i mean... it’s not like i’m exactly taking up hours of their time just by making 1 reddit post
---
Bloody builds need unyileding or Bolstering armor. Perks play a big role into a bloody build so things like barbarian in strength, iron clad in endurance, and those sneak/evasive perks in agility help alot. Most times the enemies don't see me anyway. A bloody handmade or lever is what you should start with and use at least 1* in the three rifleman perks add bloody mess for more damage if your special allows it. You can also run a mele with a good bloody mele weapon and not have to use any mele perks. It's strong enough without them.
---
That's not really a glitch, the owner just needs to move their CAMP unit within their CAMP boundaries so players appear in the right spot.
---
Okay thank you, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.
---
My go to:
---
“Take a picture of Megaton while in New Vegas while the Dragonborn fights a cliff racer”.
---
They're there. Most likely someone just cleared it out and they haven't "matured" yet. I got a near god roll pistol a couple of hours ago. Definitely not changed...
---
If the Queen drops \~3 per, then you've fought the SBQ \~33 times.  
---
Less "pay to play" and more a question of: why would you throw yourself at that bullet sponge so many times?
---
My ps4 has issues loading as well.  Got behind the purveyors desk because of it.  Nothing important back there but I got a closer look at the weapons and armor on the wall.
---
Why does everyone run Bloodied with a sliver of health? I just fight normally, but try not to stim over 60% health. Usually battles that matter wear you down lower than half hp and you’re doing really good damage for most of it anyway.
---
Yeah I figured they were known bugs.  Never noticed that the misaligned aim point was common in the silos but now you mention it, damn, you're right!
---
There isn't much else to do so when it pops up why not go
---
My trust in other players was broken today. I had a very small memorial on a wall of my camp for my best friend that passed away a couple weeks ago. It simply said RIP Aaron. Teammate asked who it was, I told him it was my brother &amp; didn't think anything else about it. Walked inside shortly after to see it changed to rape pauls asshole. He could've put that anywhere else &amp; I would've laughed my ass off. 
---
Sorry for the rant, shit hit a nerve.
---
i’m ps4 so we could meet up if we can both get our timings right otherwise sharing a video or pics would be really great if you wouldn’t mind
---
It’s a great idea, but really, we all know why :(
---
Sell it
---
I have some extras and no use for them. PS4, same name as here. I have a little of each (I think only 1 cobalt but a few/several of the rest) color. I won't be back on tonight but will be some tomorrow.
---
When it happens I bet you find the core count is wrong in your inventory.  Sometimes it even shows multiple cores selected at the same time.
---
It honestly takes about 15min to kill her if that so why not spend the 20 or so caps depending on your locarionto shoot some rounds
---
They’re the scariest enemy in this game, I’d say, by far. Maybe a high level mirelurk queen is tougher. YG will kill deathclaws no sweat.
---
no. assassin cavaliers works only on sprinting as we know. see the video, he took a dmg one time and never after that while crouching/running/jumping/whatever.
---
I’m pretty sure that’s their goal though.
---
I'm good with my bloody build. I have full unyielding. I can't use bloody because I'm using the mutation perks and serendipity and I don't have enough space to relocate 3 points.
---
Was just wondering about not bloody. I feel so weak. Like when I switch for a nuke zone and go AAE. I'm so weak I usually just go melee with instigating cuz it's the only thing that doesn't feel so terrible comparatively. But then if I try SBQ that doesn't work so I go AAE and still feel super weak. 
---
Any advice for that? Do you try to balance keeping your rads up still in nuke zones? I've tried a few times but I always get sidetracked eventually and kill myself
---
I see your confusion, keyword is "skin" vs "paint". The skin doesn't care what Power Armor you apply it to, will convert it to what you saw in pictures. The paint will just change color scheme or whatever of the Power Armor your'e applying it on. That's why all the pictures are the same, because that is what it will look like regardless of the Power Armor you apply it to.
---
“Stay up all night”
---
They definitely need a few programmers sleeping under their desks for a while. They should take some notes from a Japanese company or two.
---
They have done that since Fasnacht - opossum, rabbits, squirrels all do
---
I just like to maximize damage really. Dropping that 40% will make a 4 shot kill into 1 or 2
---
Yeah. Darker nights and lighting mods are always a must for myself when I play skyrim or fallout 4. Makes a world of difference.
---
Just built my X01, spent almost 12k on plans for the jet pack and leg mods. 
---
Also, I can't keep enough circuits because my camp keeps getting beat up by big green dudes with buckets on their heads.
---
You can trap people right now, you only have to remember where the original camp spawn was. But camps fade in so slow, every time I spawn in the middle of someone’s base I have ample time to sprint out to the edge of camp.
---
“”Ppl that say it's free nyah nyah aren't coming at it in good faith. We're putting in the time and effort and staying with the game and playing the game and filling their servers and contributing to events to make the online mmo-lite world go round.””
---
Thank you. Someone gets it.
---
How did you get all the badges? I thought some are not obtainable yet?
---
What platform you playing on? Would love to see this!  Have a video of it, at all?
---
Don’t matter what your level is past 50. It’s all in the correct build. Probably a Bloodied build that’s getting ya.
---
That doesn’t work. You spawn in the center of camp, where it was dropped, not where you eventually place it.
---
South of flatwoods worked for me
---
Wasted 6hrs of my time hopping to find a tourist before finally giving up entirely.
---
I was thinking it had to do with how your character build was geared towards. It makes sense that each time I’ve ran across this, it was always by someone purposely trying to fuck with me.
---
Maybe ammo too,
---
If they’re wearing a set of Assassin armor and they’re running a bloodied build, wearing power armor is painting a giant target on your face. Perks keep them at exceptional damage resistance at low health and prevents them from dying when their health dips too low.
---
If you don’t want PvP, don’t take workshops.
---
The ISS seems to drop them too because I have one and never fought the queen..
---
Thank you! I finally managed it after wandering around for ages under the bridge in the middle looking up about 10 feet out so you can see the side. 😊
---
If they are going to force camera challenges, then let us trade and sell cameras - we use to be about to trade them. Allow others to help those that dont have it. I have found over a dozen broken cameras that I can fix up and use - but the game simply will not let me sell them at all. u/Ladydevann u/Valseek what is with that? What was the game logic that means I cant help other players
---
Challenges should award gameplay, not force you to do strange convoluted things that take away from your experience.
---
Eeeh there's a difference between a puzzle camp and kill room :/
---
Good advice, makes sense that each time I’ve ran into this issue, it was from someone purposely trying to fuck with me.
---
Same. Absolutely refuse at this point. Between this shit and the non cosmetics I won’t give them a dime. 
---
Paid 60 for a broken game and trying sleezy tactics to get me to open my wallet while the game is still buggy and unbalanced. Man, the fucking gall is astounding.
---
I totally agree, there really isn’t much excitement in the game at this point other than jumping on to see your vending and then jumping to a SBQ or white springs nuke on the same server you are on... without having to spend the effort and time to set it off yourself. Why not enjoy in the time someone else put into a nuke on the server you are on or jumped to. And when I set off a SBQ nuke, I pray for the powerful hitters to join... I don’t want that queen to last the whole event time lol I want her down ASAP.
---
I can make it a prime receiver, what if I were to do that?
---
I fast travel away, wait a bit, then fast travel back.
---
Should be 0 until they add a fixed spawn for at least 1 tourist. Lots of ya have spent hours and still don’t have a camera.
---
It was changed back in like patch 5 or 6. Yeah, I think it's dumb too, ESPECIALLY since you can still be given the quest to go retrieve it if you're nearby when another player calls one. You are basically told to go steal something and get bounty'd.
---
That suuucks
---
thanks!
---
Yeaaah especially for the players playing since november ... ewww :( Why are our underwear glued to our skin :( ?
---
See I'm on the fence on whether bolstering or vanguard is better.
---
High risks and high rewards. If you want to max damage then you need to be low health. Why reward someone who is at full health ya know. It's a trade off. Either you want more damage and have to give up some HP or keep a high HP and do less damage. Either way you win. Low health guys can destroy the enemy faster reducing the time they get damaged vs high health guys who do less damage but can take more of a beating to inflict that damage. 
---
I used to keep myself at around 20% thinking that I had to stay there. Now I run about 50-75% and as I get hit my damage increases. When nerd rage procs I then start to focus on my health. I use radaways constantly to monitor my health but it's never a problem. 
---
When I go into a nuke zone I lose all my unyileding armor stats so obviously I'm weaker. But monitoring your rads is key. That nerd rage proc helps alot when your busy. I'll usually radaway til I'm over 50% in nuke zones and when that nerd rage alarm sounds I'll hotkey a radaway. But when fighting the queen I'll let myself go down to about 5% health. Most times I'll die firing but that's max damage output.
---
Take a picture of a deathclaw in (region) at (day/night) is as complex as anything should be.
---
huh i should do this. I'm always crazy overweight because i keep hoarding food to the point that it's almost as if i haven't acknowledged yet that the apocalypse has already passed.
---
Is it too much to ask that we get a switch that looks like a bottle of lotion?  "It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the flamethrowers again?" written right above it on the wall. Ya put the lotion on and the door opens while I creep around you wearing nothing, but welding goggles. It's a win win for everyone.
---
Qif you use a gatlin gun, you don't use anywhere near as many rounds   &amp; use something like a lever on her followers
---
Or maybe they could fix them so they actually don't randomly ignore enemies?
---
If you take a workshop then you agree to pvp. Don't want pvp, don't take workshops. We're 6 months into the game and this is still a topic that gets posted about often
---
My advice is to play the game for what it is not what you want/think it should be
---
Camden park is my only must go these days. I need 450 tokens for a full Mr Fuzzy costume. It’s taking a long time to gather them.
---
I think a better remedy would be to not allow for rooms to be built without a doorway leading in/out. Would promote lockpicking rather than the usual blow the wall down mindset.
---
Or at least have items default to the price of existing items in the machine when adding more.
---
Sorry bit if you use fireproof, dense chest mod and a bit of tactical play they are just bloodied rifles which require a bit less skill to play. I'm playing pvp like 24/7 and yeah sometimes the lasers are annoying, but they are not godmode or something. I also have players which can last a whole 25 shots of a BE laser rifle. Btw recon scopes fucking rule.
---
Weeell the biggest weapons may look stupid on our back but HEY that's part of the fun ! ... RIP your back though
---
I really agree with the OP but I didn’t see my fave recipe mentioned, it’s a good one: 
---
Craft lemonade, add vodka at the brewing station=
---
Hard Lemonade!
---
The AP regen it provides is extremely useful. 
---
It’s the only thing I cook that I consistently use and search for the ingredients for.
---
Yeah but say it’s a lv 3 lock and you only have lv 2 your still stuck
---
ABSOLUTELY!!
---
I use a BE 50 and it does eat up some rounds but they are easy to make and people selling them so I've kept stock
---
Those can both work though. Set up pressure plates to the counter to the speaker. Every 10th person to enter your shop gets a fanfare and surprise.
---
I'm definitely still for complex objects though. Those conveyor systems would be amazing.
---
The one where the ability to see the obvious hasn’t been bred out.
---
&gt;"Braces for down votes"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'm sorry I have to give you an up vote.
---
What's the ISS
---
Get rid of exploits too. We don't want people seeing content on how to break the game. Bethesda has enough as it is and people who do this will make it where we won't have a game anymore.
---
They should honestly do a small c.a.m.p dlc containing just building items like, vertical half walls, diagonal half walls, half &amp; quarter foundations &amp; roofs, stairs that connect at the center of a foundation rather than the edge (a ladder would be badass, too). I just want more functional build items.
---
Don't know if I can spell it 😅 the imposter sheepsquatch
---
Yes this is a another good point
---
This guy is 100% legit. He hooked me up with a 3* handmade today.
---
I'll take your 5mm and 556 as well if you've got any left :)
---
I understand that claiming a workshop makes you agree to PvP, that wasn’t my issue. My issue was with how I was getting killed so quickly/easily.
---
I'm glad you agree.
---
Duh I feel not very smart right now lol
---
Ever think about about the other player? Maybe it's you that is fucking with them? 
---
They see a claimed workshop and think oh great finally some pvp! They show up and it's some asshole who wants nothing to do with pvp and calls them a griefer. 
---
Not saying this is the case here or often but i see these posts all time and i can't help but think it must suck to want pvp in this game
---
I'll give you an up vote also.
---
I agree because my level 109 character got one shot by a level 5 with a tse on pvp
---
Downvote all you like. You know I'm right.
---
I don't understand how someone could not upvote this.
---
Come to think of it, maybe I got some from other events and didn't realize it. I've fought the queen a lot but not enough to amass over 100. So who knows.
---
Vamguard is soaring up lately. Unyielding is gold ATM. Expect bolstering to get more popular
---
I'm pretty sure it's only if you store it or move your camp but I'm not entirely sure so pls don't hate me if I'm wrong
---
No. It just does not display your camp location.
---
at least you didnt upload this 4 times in a row like i did last night hahahaha :)
---
for me Vanguard is the best for low levels with a difference. 
---
The +35+35 bonus is the same for level 1 than for level 50... so +185 +185 to star the game is brutal. I feel like cheating, pasing one set of VAN/CHA + shielded armor to a fresh char to level up. 220DR 220E in the door of V76!
---
For late game, debatable. Anyway, I personally don't like to play "anti-natura" to stay at low HP so bolstering and unyielding are not for me.
---
On which platform do you play?
---
i believe healing factor negates the damage over time
---
The simple answer is no. 
---
Vats sneak can be fun but it lags way behind bloodied and everything lags way behind bloodied melee.
---
The swamp you too crawled out from I see.  
---
"I dont like the atom shop..... it must be the players fault, screee"  
---
Fucking gremlins
---
Same thing happened to me. Exact same loot. Jumpsuits will be worthless in a month im sure.
---
Answer to question 1. Yes. If you disconnect power it resets and you will need for reload the machines.
---
Answer or most likely scenario.  Yes, you should be able to rewire and then disconnect the old wires as long as you maintain power to the machines. Just do not scrap the wrong wires........
---
It made me feel things I’ve never felt before.
---
I guess I must be really lucky. I found it for 500 caps
---
I made those S'mores for the challenge the other day.... never making them again
---
O.o that's not possible. It shouldn't be.
---
I also had a player kill me with one strike and then destroy a workshop. Then kept assaulting me as I tried to run away. Told me to drop all my stuff or he will harass me. I told him that I will report him via a trouble ticket and he backed off.
---
People are feeling too powerful when they get an exploit and take advantage of other players. We need to squash these guys at the source and make those who give the exploits and tools tools for others to be banned permanently. They can't do anything if they don't have a game to play.
---
Thank you very much. 🙇🏼‍♀️👏🏼
---
Ahh i see. Don't mind me then. Got confused by the not a pvp player line
---
On the player not dying at low health...serendipity perk at level 3
---
The small wire connectors (forgot name) can attack to the back of the vending machines and you can't see the wires from the front.
---
Same here! Psn: laxerunlimited
---
I can help you out, when are you online and what's your psn?
---
Would love to but I won’t be on till a few hrs
---
Lol thank you😊🙇🏼‍♀️! Your not the only one saying it so I should be okay lol!
---
To add to the ridiculousness of it: 
---
There's sometimes random encounters with drop boxes (though they're unlocked so you can't get wanted).
---
Nuke keycard drop boxes are locked, but they don't make you wanted (and shouldn't, but is just pointlessly inconsistent behavior)
---
So- true long has the highest hit % in vats? Does it use more Ap per shot? Any idea what the optimal mods for vats action cost are?
---
I want a good three star plasma but I keep getting miniguns
---
Right now and BHOhmygod
---
Well, I have a 3\* version of it.
---
\+100% dmg if the enemy has 100% HP (thats the instigating)
---
\+25% limb dmg
---
\+reduced VATS cost
---
SBQ dropped it few weeks ago. I think, with the correct build, it can do a hell lot of dmg for the first shot to the head, or other limbs.
---
this was a thing in fallout 4 so i dont see why not
---
Ultracite?
---
I know right it's like the people that hate on the game are the ones making it bad for the other player I dont remember who said this but he said that 
---
"Players are duping and getting high level items and calling the game boring for somthing that they did"
---
I do the same with a 10mm, it’s a pistol sniper. You usually waste the first two shots, but after that it’s all head shots, at low AP cost. 
---
It’s more versatile than rifles: faster rate of fire if you get jumped than a hunting rifle, lighter weight, only need one kind of ammo, seems to get more bang for your buck per AP with Concentrated Fire bonus.
---
Super mutants go down harder and it’s fuck all useless against strong single mobs though like legendary assaultrons, esp since the stealth nerf.
---
I don’t think fresh vault dwellers have caps to buy anything. Or they are new to the mechanics. Or Probability looking for a hand out. Chalk it up to location.
---
I'll keep u in mind
---
My psn is YoungSpud-san. I'll take any lead, steel, and screws. You sure you domt want caps tho?
---
burn
---
On PC? Grab SFE and Perk Loadout Manager from [nexusmods.com](https://nexusmods.com). Not on PC? HAHAHAHAA PC MASTER RACE!
---
ascarin1988, any lead and steel?
---
It’s all good bud, I don’t have a prob with the PvP aspect, I was just frustrated at me getting my ass kicked even when I was trying to put in a good fight. Makes sense now though considering I don’t have jack shit geared towards it in my character build. I’m definitely gonna check out that serendipity perk though, thanks!
---
No cook. Have carnivore, eat only roach meat.
---
It’s ok. I ignore them also.
---
Was really debating doing this myself too
---
It's not a matter of remembering or anything, it's just tedious
---
Can you add me? I can't find you through Search 🤔 ascarin1988
---
What the hell. I've been playing since beta testing and I'm level 119. I take my time and I'm not that powerful. I still get knocked around like a rag doll.
---
Some spawns in the back left building of the grafton steel plant.
---
Invest in fireproof lvl3 and dodgy lvl 2-3 always. It'll buy you at least a hit or 2 while in power armor. After that invest in anything that gives anti armor and go to town. I've shredded entire groups with a tesla using commando and tank killer alone. The arcing of the tesla is super nice vs grieving groups lol
---
Same but I swapped to xb1 after getting harrassed by people on ps4
---
I use it at lvl 2 for pve build, works great and procs often
---
Found you and added.
---
Ya I got ultracite
---
Where's WestTek?
---
Yeah, I use a non bloodied 10mm on a stealth build and a super mutant takes most of a clip to take down. Some
---
more than that.
---
The gap between bloodied and non bloodied in terms of damage is huge.
---
Pistols are very weak, but fun.
---
That's straight disrespectful especially since he know the context of the memorial. Not cool. 
---
I remember awhile back that another player had honored a fallen friend and I thought it was very kind hearted and a great way to honor his friend. 
---
You just don't mess with another players camp like that, destroying a camp is one thing.... That would hit a nerve for me as well.
---
Ok cheers mate will look there
---
It would be the same weight we already carry so no biggie. Just a display thing. I love it in Destiny
---
One time this guy initiated and I killed him- he sought revenge and it took him a couple minutes to come back... this time in power armor. I giggled and gave him a dirty look and he died~ people really think it’s gonna protect them lol
---
Sent you my psn
---
Yeah I couldn’t find it at the vendor at all but a player on here was nice enough to sell me his earlier so I’m happy 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Joining you. Do you have a discord or something we could chat on super easy? Here would work if it works for you
---
Aluminum and adhesive??
---
And that’s why I don’t go inside other people’s camps.
---
Let me take OFF my underwear! Appalachia just went through 3 separate apocalyptic events in 25 years, I should be able swing my dick around!
---
Giving away everything if u want a weapon or armor too
---
Joining you now.
---
Oh awesome man I appreciate it
---
Agreed, they really need to split up the plans tab though into weapons/armor/building.
---
Just gave you an up vote.
---
So you are still scrapping this character?
---
I would love to craft Sweet Rolls to max trading sesions. 
---
* I can take to get the recipe (it's not so common).
---
* I can take to search, to collect and to stock the +10 ingredients one single sweet roll needs.
---
* I can take to go to cooking station.
---
but I can't take to have to use them NOW or to see how they spoil in rl minutes.
---
I am with you now.
---
Not to mention you can just continuously reset your well rested to cure a disease. This isn’t needed. 
---
I agree that cure disease meds seem to be way more common than diseases themselves, but maybe melee get more diseases? I always have a surplus, but always sell my cures really well.
---
Thank you.  Are you getting rid of ammo, too?
---
Yup. Kinda wish I hadn’t set up there in hindsight but the little shop I have done is probably one of my best builds so stuck between a rock and a hard place. Surprisingly I get bugged by a lot more by high levels must just be a poo location.  Thanks for replying 👏🏼
---
Thanks man that's really nice of you I appreciate it 👍👍
---
I heard this too but it's not true at my camp (I always spawn at the edge of the circle). I've been moving the camp module around to see if i can change the spawn point and i thought i did it. I'll have to check next time i log on.
---
Joining ur world
---
Well you asked if it was an ad, so he explained it wasn’t, he was just excited to play.
---
I am ok with state of game itself (still better than oblivion), but if they are trying to force us to donate, then it is same as drunk homeless and i avoid those people.
---
I need to do the same! Add me PSN r_castro33
---
Thank you😊
---
Cool, does they count as "Kill wendigo in the wendigo cave" ? :D
---
I must admit there were a few mornings in my younger days where I woke up hungover and figured, “Guess I live here now.”
---
It would be cool to have a killer camp leaderboard.
---
Bloodied, stealth, and VATS crits are 3 general meta builds currently. 
---
Go with what you like though. It's no fun playing a play style that's forced. And a lot of builds have counters to them. So nearly nothing is perfect. 
---
I even saw a medic based build that self revived every time he was downed. Couldn't be killed as long as he had stims basically. 
---
Tldr: ignore meta, follow your heart. But current metas IMO are bloodied, stealth, and vats critical based (stealth and VATS can go hand in hand but not all builds combine the two)
---
I was up on the cliffs on west side of water park...finally saw a flatwoods, shot at him but he took off.  Went down cliff a bit and ran into a robot lemonade vendor.  Hit vats button and locked on to a mothman.  Shot him once and he took off.  How are you suppose to engage these guys?
---
Dear lord, yes.  Some of the longer skirted outfits (I'm looking at you, Golf Skirt) do some rather scandalous things during certain sitting actions, especially playing instruments.  I would prefer to play the banjo without flashing my dirty knickers.
---
This is what I thought as I at the last shop I had when I disconnected the power I swear it dumped it all back in my stash. Going to risk it for a chocolate biscuit. Thank you 🙏🏻
---
Lousy molerats...

added
---
Not with a name like "Snippy Snallygaster", you don't.
---
Psn
---
No I think imma save it like u said
---
You can actually build bloodied stealth VATS crit too. That's what I am, one shot everything but a select few mobs, and two shot most players, if not one shot.
---
how did you message them? is there an option in game?
---
The could catch a break if they stopped hitting themselves in the face?
---
It ain’t gremlins doing these things, it’s them...

The only time I notice a team invite is when I get the popup saying I've declined it (I presume from not replying soon enough). I never see the original requests, not sure if it's because they're sending them in the midst of an Encryptid furball, or I'm just that ignorant, or what.
---
Guns have "explosive" which is multiplied with demolitions, and they used to have Two Shot which counted as Double impact .... until they got nerfed due to the demand for more of these extremely powerful weapons, and so they got duped.  
---
Melee has only ended up being the most powerful because it has always been the most unpopular (in Fallout .... due to it being simple slash, slash, slash, not fun).  The more you complain about melee, the less they will do to amplify guns, and more they will do to bug and nerf melee.  They might just do something about the weight of guns though .... so complain about the right things, you won't ever get the guns to be more powerful  than they already are

Sounds good. Join me
---
Some people on here say they spawn at Harpers ferry(not the vendorbot). I’ve been looking with no success.
---
True has the highest VATS accuracy, yes. I don't know about the AP cost, it's not something I've had an issue with. I have 300 AP, action cost isn't something I've had to consider for a while?
---
It's in Maine.
---
I have yet to come across one. The only thing that's happened to me that is slightly annoying is when you spawn at a camp and get stuck in the foundations.
---
I heard that the span location for your own camp works differently and spawns you a distance away from the original camp device  location. Also moving the camp device in build mode isn't supposed to change the spawn location.
---
Been looking there with no luck
---
I made a thread the other day going over the issues of Energy Weaps, and I can tell you that Energy Weapons not getting armour penetration benefits has been happening since Fallout 4.
---
At the risk of a downvote, can someone explain the abbreviation DoT to someone who doesn't normally play multiplayer games?
---
It’s not even tier 0 armor. You skip it right from the overseer’s camp as soon as you leave the vault. It’s tier -1, like one team made it to be the first armor you make, and the team implementing resources and/or building the actual game play never got the email.
---
For some reason, I picture you being the ancestor of Philippe from Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Very true. Those 3 just seem to be where the trees seems to diverge into sub groups.
---
I think this is solid advice. I find a stealth vats but not critical heavy pretty viable. Bloodied is very powerful from what I’ve seen, but takes a lot of work. But I can one shot a lot of things, and a powerful combat or handmade with a decent legendary effect can help me when I’m swarmed out of stealth using the same rifleman perks as snipering.
---
thanks

They want a cap sink right? Well there you go! I use mines to defend workshops and a sometimes in survival to get out of a tight spot. Bottle cap mines are so satisfying
---
I'm confused. The only thing OP is really asking for is what I think 90% of people would consider a QOL upgrade. It doesn't change the games mechanics at all. All he's asking for is, say you have Gunsmith Lvl 5. You're probably not gonna need it in combat, so you usually just have some other perk cards equipped, then when you're back in base modding/crafting your guns, you put the Gunsmith back on, do your stuff, and then unequip it before you leave. 
---
Sometimes it takes a minute to swap back all the crafting perks you used - armor, ammo, gun smith... and a minute every time you're doing this adds up quick.
---
Or sometimes you forget altogether and don't realize until you're already Fast Traveled over to Death from Above and you get railed and your stimpacks aren't healing extra like you're used to.
---
All OP is asking for is to be able to have a system where you can, say, press a key to equip a specific set of cards. So maybe F1 equips a bunch of rifle/combat perks, F2 equips your crafting stuff, and F3 is a bunch of group/party effect cards.
---
How does this change the base ideal of the SPECIAL system?
---
Bgriff91 if you need another
---
It would happen more frequently, and faster.
---
That makes sense
---
It is supposed to be leveled but that seems to be bugged, if wait until the patch tmrw to see if that’s fixed. Unless you have space in your stash to lay down any god rolls you get.
---
Now they actually give you items specific to your level, I'd just use them now &amp; when you go up levels scrap them for higher level ones
---
They've mentioned a possible fridge coming in the utility section of previous 'inside the vault's.

Bethesda please just let us place a welcome mat landing pad for FT or respawn. Why is this not a thing.
---
That's not how it works for me. If you move the location of the unit after claiming an area, the point at which you spawn changes. I've literally moved my CAMP unit until I see players spawning in where I want them to.
---
Thanks for the tips mate, much appreciated!
---
Usually 50 caps a piece at my camp.
---
Yours wouldn't be able to kill me :] I take zero fall damage without power armor!
---
As you get higher level you'll do harder battles &amp; pick up more legendaries, at higher levels its pretty easy to get your 150 scrip per day
---
&gt; The gap between bloodied and non bloodied in terms of damage is huge.
---
This is true for every gun type. If you can't put together solid damage for pistols, you can't put together solid damage for anything else either. First off, you're using a 10mm. They're shit. If it's full auto then its fine, but expect to eat ammo. Full auto builds throw ammo away to get that juicy high dps.. and they are absolutely the highest dps builds in game. If you want to use single shot pistols, then revolvers are your only choice. Alternatively you can use like 6 black powder pistols and just switch to the next gun after you shoot. They're suuuuper light weight and strong AF.
---
What’s so rare about it ?
---
Hmm isn't he in fact Ivar the boneless?
---
If I were putting together a "sub level 50" gear shack, i'd probably stock auto-stim in there as well, as it's quite handy lower level.
---
Class freak doesn’t boost the positive effects of mutations though. All that would happen is your food and water consumption wouldn’t drain as fast
---
Already been fixed, I picked up 2 level 1*** armors this morning from the purveyor
---
I might be on a little later or tomorrow and I'll give you one
---
I'm just going off things I've read here and forums so grain of salt and such
---
I'd wait til after level 50. 
---
You don't REALLY need it right now and a lot of the low level legendaries are either entirely useless (even for resale value) or have a limited use window before you level out of them.
---
A good level 20 weapon or armour piece is only really useful for maybe 10 or so levels, give or take. A good level 50 weapon/armour piece is good at every level above 50.
---
They see me rooolin, they haaatin
---
Tried to do a post but it kept being rejected, so I gave up
---
it would glitch out due to the CPU not being able to pull enough frames to render a higher amount of changes more frequently.  at least that makes sense in my head.
---
Class freak wouldn’t effect running speed
---
Let's not forget that they buffed the spoil rate... Long time ago, when you have a stack of the same time, only the top item of that stack will spoil. Now, they all spoil at the same time... Which makes it even worse to cook foods, especially rare food. As you're punished for preparing yourself for a long adventure ahead and are forced to find alternatives on the road or FT to specific areas to gather more easy to get food.
---
Just a heads up, Serendipity does not work while wearing power armor.
---
Serendipity and Dodgy can get kind of ridiculous.  Auto stim has both a perk and can be on armor, so that too.  Ghoulish and regeneration armor as well.   I tried to die for someone to revive me and I didn't take off the perks, took at least 5 minutes for the Scorched at Wavy Willards to finally put me down, pretty funny actually.  
---
I don't PVP, but for me to die it seems to take 1 big blow.  I can withstand ghoul hordes surrounding me in a hazmat suit or a peppering of fire from the gutsys most times, but 1 big blow will negate all the perks and it's over.  Maybe an auto weapon isn't the best to strike the finishing blow? Just a thought.
---
oh ok. thanks for the info
---
Gtfo that’s a bug fix not a nerf.
---
RIP Fixer 2019-2019
---
Nice thanks
---
Forgive me, what's so special about this?
---
?
---
The ones in the shop are. If we only had the ones from the queen and other major bosses, there wouldn't have been a problem. 
---
The issue is they're selling non-cosmetic items in the atom shop, when the VP of the company explicitly stated that would not happen.
---
Lol sorry I meant np
---
We don’t need loadouts so much as things like lockpicking and crafting stuff to just be passive ffs
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
In the west.
---
West of Uranium Fever Mines thingy
---
Good to know. :) in which case I say it’s probably worth a go. Possibly focus on two stars, depending on how much legendary stuff you’re finding.
---
yourfavdeputy I'm not great but enjoy playing as a team (old fart)
---
*people tries to launch me off
---
me: i have 100% fall damage armor
---
the other guy: ey that's cheating!
---
it starts playing at the beggining of the next song just give it a moment
---
So you’re basically that group of suburban middle school kids who call themselves a gang, just in a video game.
---
That’s totally not super sad/weird.
---
Only if undetected. Which can be a pain.
---
What ammo u looking for
---
I know it's under "roofs" and it should be part of the barn building plans.
---
1/1000 or 1/800 drop rate for these, He is right to be excited. Nothin g special about the healing
---
Just upgrade him a couple levels. My level 2 got 1 star armor while my level 9 got level 50. So it's only kinda fixed.
---
They’re CRAZY hard to get. The chance that the machine will give you a pie is really low, so people like to hold onto them as a “trophy” symbol.
---
I took workshops and completed the first defend the workshop mission. The ones in the forest arw give 125 to 150 ecp For, taking them and the same for defending them so I, used to do 4 or five. You also get cp from the hordes that attack wade Airport is Good as there are usually super mutants to clear first
---
I also concentrated on one primary damage type and the damage support perks before leveling up any other perks. You'll never feel under powered then
---
Do it..
---
If you're on tomorrow, I can craft you a lvl 50. I should be on around 2pm EST.
---
press f for this buddy
---
hope beth do something about it we have chat, perk card presets and this... seriously it's there cmon devs
---
Ok, yesterday he got level 50 &amp; I didn't try my level 24, ill give him a go
---
I don't understand why anyone bothers to lock those things I always end up with hundreds of purified water just from doing events.
---
I rarely play but have 3, maybe good rng
---
I am not...seeing it.  It comes with the barn plans you say?
---
I’ve heard that ammo isn’t paying out correctly right now. People are saying they are getting significantly less caps from it than they should be (or none at all). Haven’t tested it out for myself, but be warned..
---
Yea its gotten to the point of annoying that i had to leveled up a completely different character. Im just gonna wait till it gets fixed tbh. But unfortunately gat plasma doesnt get much attention. It took us a month to get the one shot and stop bug fixed. I dont mean to be a debbie downer but it doesnt seem on their priority list. I mean AA hasnt worked for energy weapons since launch.
---
I saw a base with a bunch of traps hidden and it made me sad because there was a button that said press me and I knew it was a trap and I pressed it because I wanted to be launched off of the roof and it didn’t do anything :(
---
The other traps did work but didn’t do that much damage, 1/10 for disappointment
---
Can I buy those from you?
---
Forsure I'm at work till 630 EST. But I'll toss you my psn if you're not gonna be on. Either way much appreciated!!
---
I've got on on my camp so I know it's under roofs. You scrolled left to right on some of the roofs, to see the variations, right?
---
You finally came back! Can I get some cigarettes?
---
Ive actually shot around some of the whitesprings bushes and I'll legitimately shoot the roofs. Ive swapped back and forth and it still have the issue. Though I'm not so sure its a gatling plasma issue alone. My brother had the issue (mostly in 3rd person) with the minigun. You could see the roof explode.
---
Send me a message on here when you do get on tomorrow and I'll hop on too.
---
You're very welcome.
---
Holy shit.  I cant believe i never noticed that...Thanks 76er!!
---
I love Nukashine. It saves the day every time I’m not sure what to do next..
---
Will do!
---
For anyone that’s a fan of trap bases check out [Rcham](https://youtu.be/_jzmRAK29MM) on YouTube. He has some great trap bases in Rust
---
Hahahahaha!
---
You're very welcome and I'm glad you found it.
---
We found her today at the walkway on top of the lighthouse... had never heard anyone mention them spawning there before.
---
yes i was falling too but just disable the mod and wait for the update even bethesda talked about that in their tweet. modders are quick to update tho less than a day. but the last updates didn't have any major bug
---
Oh yes! The simplicity of youth... Now a virtual refuge.
---
Cheers my dude.
---
Might have something to do with if you ever completed missions with the character too. Not sure since my level 2 got 1 star and 5 min later my buddy got level 50 with his level 2. Beats me.
---
*has strange in numbers and bird bones*
---
"You didn't hinder me, you helped me"
---
Try it - It's great fun ... And addictive :D
---
I saw one that was pretty clearly a kill camp, but decided to go in anyway. I kind of forgot that you drop all of your junk when you die (I'm lvl 10) and he picked it all up. I asked for it back and he just said "welcome to the wasteland" lol
---
A shine a day  
---
Keeps the boredom away :D
---
that mod have food and drink tabs inside aid but still i keep scrolling for purify water xd
---
Yeah just tested my sons level 30 &amp; he got L50, so it is only partially working, ill delete the post
---
I have found one in a footlocker at Cobbleton Farm.  Seems to be totally random.
---
The base idea is that you aren't good at everything... Hot swapping them takes value away from being good at some things and instead everybody can do everything whenever they want.
---
Ever tried just not swapping perks? It's a different kind of challenge. I need to trade or do deals with people to get my armor and weapons modified.
---
This is just my opinion and how I like to play. Take it with a grain of salt, but I think that is how the system is intended to work.
---
but you still keep changing the cards but just it's annoying and take time lol
---
in eso you can change anytime from any class and it doesn't punish you or make it less immerse
---
I wasn't ready for that, caught me unawares...
---
I think with the challenges of kill sbq in a team etc the game encourages random adds too much
---
I completely agree! I just choose not to swap them. I've never hacked or lockpicked on my main, at least not above 0. He has other... skills... That makes him special.
---
I have a feeling that unmarked Vault has something to do with this.
---
It's a the thing. Not really fixed totally
---
Clear dolly sods means do the quest that's connected. Speak to the scout leader bot.
---
Now imagine how much easier that would be if we could play cross platform and/or cross character.
---
My best friend doesn’t play Pc like me, but we both have our children’s ps4, so when he bought 2 fo76 for ps4 I found out that you cant link your pc character to ps4 and I have to start over on level 1.
---
I've been using my QE railway, it's crazy fun.  Put an automatic receiver and it shoots as fast as an lmg... I can't spam space bar fast enough.  And it uses so little AP I can go thru 120 rounds before I leave vats.  It's silly
---
Okay so i should just take the legendary drop i get, use them til they're not worth using, and scrap them, all while saving my scrips for level 50?
---
I gotta come pay homage at some point. Gt?
---
They are supposed to give stuff based on the players level.
---
I asked this the other day, they can drop randomly - camp venture was suggested to me. Also try treasure maps - I'm pretty sure I got a set from there once upon a time.
---
Anyway, what worked for me was player vending. I found these plans in someone's vending machine. So worth checking them out.
---
*slow clap*
---
My man.
---
It probably was greeters trying to setting you up. I get invited all the time from randoms that are no where near me. I play it safe and don't accept
---
That's some Mad Max shit there.
---
the survival challenge requires a team. I don't have enough friends for a full squad.
---
I try &amp; give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're not a-holes. For me it's just a matter of inconvenience &amp; interruption.
---
Med-X was originally morphine in FO3 -- had to be renamed to allow the game to be sold in Australia.
---
Might have missed that. Thanks, didn't knew it.
---
"don't know what they're doing" -- hahahahaha
---
Shotguns are broken. Enforcer makes shotguns stagger and cripple opponents. Shoot at the legs of a deathclaw and they fall down. Legendary enemies collapse on the ground (note that when they do their heal thing it removes the crippled effect and they get up again).  (Sheepsquatch however doesn't appear to get crippled legs).  I had a group of super mutants spawn right on top of me one time and the thing that saved me was taking out their legs with my shotgun as I ran for it. 
---
I'm only 59 but I've been running around with a combat shotgun since I first could use one. With a suppressor on it its great for quick, close kills. I do go through a LOT of plastic keeping the ammo going though (although the Ammosmith perk helps a lot with that).
---
Waitaminute. Did that get fixed?
---
I could swear I used to use it in PA.
---
Oh no no i meant realistically speaking ^^' For those carrying a heavy weapon + their heavy armor + ammo :3 But yeah it would be nice to see them back (dunno why theh removed it...)
---
What about fuel? I didn't see it, unless I missed it.
---
Nah, take an upvote, I dunno the guy i don't accept either
---
agreed. creative puzzles or traps set up are one thing but someone fast traveling to purchase at your camp...is another. I totally would not mind one bit if it was NOT something that happened automatically upon fast travel. even a puzzle room without death is entertaining. but a kill room ? IMO something like that should be setup for people that break in and aren't minding their own business.
---
Server hop and/or wait for the area to completely load before interacting.
---
I am located near the Station at Top of the World. As the poster beneath me mentioned it was most likely done by griefers as there was quite a neat cluster of other camps in the same blastzone. Some people, seriously &gt;&lt;
---
did they fix your account?
---
Been away from the game for a long while, but this stuff sounds incredible. Seems like this game has come a long way and is in a good place right now. Is that so? Worth jumping back into?
---
Truth.
---
...no. This is shitty game design, not a player problem. I wouldn't call it a "glitch". I'd call it "incompetence". Every other game I've ever played has some way to get you unstuck when you're stuck in terrain.
---
Not necessarily.  A good power armor build isn’t that far off an assassin sentinel build anymore.   The thing is most power armor builds you come across are shit.
---
I just want a server away from all the dupers and exploiters. Bethesda won't police their own game, and people will always cheat. Fine, let it happen. Just give me the ability to keep them off my goddamn server.
---
I accept them, because some people just want a free fast travel, and since my camp is at whitesprings, it's convenient for them
---
Unfortunately I cant remember anymore, sorry.
---
Food could give you full on invincibility for an hour and most people still wouldn't make it. The problem is everything spoils quickly, making it completely impossible to trade or sell food in vending machines. Additionally, many of them require specific resources that also spoil and can only be obtained in one locale of the map. Meaning you HAVE to fast travel around the map gathering a bunch of crap you'd otherwise never want, all on an arbitrary time limit, just for a slightly better food item.
---
And why? None of it will ever be good enough to be worth the trouble. Damage buff? You'll most likely get a better one just from psychobuff. Better healing? Stimpaks are more common than broken cars. Stat bonuses? Legendary armor already does it better. Xp boost? You would have gotten more exp if you didn't waste your time running around the map for a sheepsquatch's asshair mixed with the grass growing around mama dolce's sewer pipes
---
I was running behind a fox near new had, long expanse of basically desert. Swinging my heart out with an axe and despite the blood, despite the fox's cries in pain and the clunks of metal on fur, nothing could hit him. So I adapted and sprinted in front of the fox about two metres then swung and sure enough, with a clunk and a screech the fox died back there. Server lag is OP and keeping those critters alive.
---
And fix the counters that have been in CAMP and don't work :'(
---
You've got the map upside down -- it's east of Blackwater mine.
---
I have the same issue I think.  Wood doesn't show up when scrolling, but you can scroll past Ultracite to highlight it (since wooden junk items then show up on the right).  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's possible to un-tag it.
---
Yeah for exemple, put a trap/puzzle room with a vending machine with cheap item as a reward at the end, but the way fast travel work kinda kill that idea... *spawn inside the foundations*
---
I too, will pay for Mothman booty shorts
---
Huuuh... Good idea i admit, that cliff over watoga is nice but a change is welcome :3
---
I don't know I've run the queen over 100 times since I hit level cap/end game.
---
For me it's a way to pass the time. 35-40 mins per silo. 5-15 min per queen kill. Repeate 1 more time on a server. The hip to a new one. Reppeat again till I'm low on ammo craft more or stock up on mats. Cook all the junk meat that I've picked up and vendor it for my 1400 caps per day. Drop the junk legendaries off at the script machine. Place the rest for sale. Ammo up repair my PA and do it all over again till I run out of play time.
---
Me after going into a hole that was labeled "enter here":
---
Oh there's someone in here
---
What are you doing with that mace?
---
You still on?
---
Or GoT related like sitting around doing nothing just like Bran Stark in the Battle of Winterfell.
---
I pvp all day too and I see the complete opposite. I have friends with full vanguards heavy leather, dense, and fireproof 3 and they still get killed with just splash damage easily. 
---
We even did tests with it because there was rumors the BE laser is ballistic because of the explosive. It definitely is still energy but even the best armor in game can’t stop this gun.
---
I've had ghost camps I couldn't go to; I've fast traveled to a camp but when I arrived the camp isn't there; and one time I was at a camp going through the vending machine, and just as I exited it the whole camp phased out of existence. If I'd bought something just as the player owning it logged out, would I get the item? Would the owner get the money? Would I lose the money but never get the item and the owner lose the item and never get the money (because that would suck)?
---
I feel the same way, I had some random send a team invite and thanks to a glitch in the interface I accepted instead of denying it. This player then pops into my camp and starts building bone chimes everywhere, by the time I dropped out of team there had to have been about 20+ of the damn things and I ended up scrapping the whole base because I couldn't find the ones he had glitched into foundations or wherever.     
---
I will occasionally accept a friend invite as I am willing to act as a free fast travel point but a team invite is automatically denied, I have a team that I play with when they are on and have no reason to be in a team otherwise.
---
Private servers can't come soon enough. Players like that are always going to do some sort of bullshit instead of just playing the game. They'll ruin shit, get bored and move on to a different game. You can't stop it.
---
You CAN make private servers with active admins, to keep those people out. I have no idea why Bethesda is dragging their feet on private servers. It'll be the best thing to ever happen to this game.
---
&gt; Well you asked if it was an ad
---
u/Phypur is not u/SavoirFaire71
---
No still not fixed. Did have another email saying they can’t help as something wrong with the code and need to look out for the next patch.
---
Not sure if you’re serious, but... [nope](https://www.destructoid.com/random-why-there-is-no-ladder-climbing-in-fallout-181444.phtml).
---
spawning into foundations really is terrible.
---
I'd think it was clever to fast travel even into a puzzle if I'm not dying, I'd enjoy it. if there is a chance of death, it's easy to mark that because it's fair if you want privacy.
---
I have spawned into plenty of camps directly into living rooms or private areas and it felt weird. I just came to buy. I don't want to invade nor have to hunt down vending machines. seriously, I want to respect privacy... but again, I would not mind non lethal puzzles (or lethal ones with a heads up)  like a "stash junk, lethal ahead" something like that with a stash box. idk ...
---
Yeaah... I found new recipeeh but what's the point if a standard meat can do better and cheaper...
---
my photos with night vision

---
I kind of went PA 2handed melee for a fair while after I kept running out of ammo for the heavy weapons.
---
When the backpack update happened I had to switch it around because I can't have my fridge modded backpack in my Power Armor.....
---
So now I'm unarmed most of the time. If I'm going to do something that hits hard like sheepsquatch I switch back to 2handed power armor just for the event.
---
My build isn't quite meta as I swapped things out for things I wanted in my build. But it can still 1 shot  non glowing ghouls at the golf course. And for nuked areas I can still 2 shot them while in a hazmat suit. Power armor 2 handed also 2 shots them.
---
&gt; As for dot I'm not really sure
---
I think he meant Damage Over Time -- i.e. the damage the pylons give you.
---
And 1x2 and 1x1 variants to accompany the existing floor skins.
---
How the hell do you function in real life if you can't be in the presence of some ones digital Avatar?
---
It's never going to stop, people who dupe and exploit don't give a shit about this game or the players. The only solution is private servers with active admins.
---
Oooh museum of glitch curiosities, I like it !
---
Nice
---
Just got off now.
---
Copy level2 character fresh from the vault got particle 1 stuff today, bout my business level 30 a still got for he 50.
---
Wondering if eww can get different levels to work out where the 100% cut off is between level specific &amp; L50, would be nice to know
---
Alright maybe tomorrow
---
well thats good then, that is just tomorrow. I really hope it is fixed tomorrow. I have invested a lot of time on this character. Not to mention my rare items.
---
Your also supposed to get the neon letters
---
Yeah a rework of spawn would be cool...It feels weird to be in your camp and you see someone in your floor -_-
---
 (like for whatever reason i never spawn in my camp when i fast travel but a bit outside so why it's not the same for others camp). 
---
But no placable spawn point, it could be abused too much...
---
This happened to me Friday and I still can’t log in. I’ve done everything that I’ve seen on post and Google. Had 5 replies back from my submitted ticket and basically told they can’t help me at customer support as there’s something wrong with the code. Said to keep looking out for the next patch. I’m on ps4 but I think if you’re on pc then they can help with the corrupt file. Good luck.
---
Yes srry,i have them but only 1 sign
---
Broken prosnaps are everywhere now, lots of containers have them also.
---
I like the current system, having switchable loaduot in every instant would make every character the same the whole time, At least switching perk requires time and attention, or SPECIAL investment keep the perk equipped. With loadouts the only limitation would be the level, deleting the purpose of character creation.
---
So u have the open sign and the neon letters?
---
I'd like a star slot to be "two mods can be installed on this armor piece$ or something.  Ultralight and dense would be a great combo.
---
Maybe you can get max level stuff with low levels but not always. My lvl 8 shop got 3 lvl5 items in a row, now I dont use him to cash in items.
---
The companions
---
Yes
---
Yeah I figured it out @.@
---
Oh then you have everything
---
10/10 would walk into kill camp again.
---
Oh thanks I was looking for when the next was out. I know I’m level 118 so not quite as high as others but so annoying. The worst bit is the last week I had a free week and spent hours getting the possum badges to get the bigger backpack. I can’t go back and do that all again.
---
Still being closed minded
---
Thanks for info :D
---
Wetwork Merc
---
Ikr , go play fallout 4 if you don't want other players in your game
---
Make it plan:sign and letters then...ok ty for your reply
---
Bethesda listens to it though
---
Good point, when everyone can do godly everything the role play is absolutely dead.
---
Ok I will let you have that, I’m closed minded.
---
Yeah np
---
yea it happened again to me recently
---
Im unfortunately on xbox. I just don't understand how a file can corrupt just from server hopping. If they can get into character inventories to combatdoping, how can they not reset a character back to a prior save like a few minutes before. I'm sorry it's been so long for you
---
You will only find them in containers _after_ you find the tourist. It's annoying.
---
This may still be pararel content to PvE raid on adventure mode. I will belive in it until release, because of "Kill ZAX" in checklist :D
---
I also play a female avatar, although my reason is purely selfish, I like to look at a nice ass when I play and the rocket girl outfit has a great ass. I also have a female IGN due to it being my favourite HHGTTG character.      
---
It's so frickin funny when some player rolls up on me being all white knight and shit and then realizes I am better geared and know more tricks then he does.     
---
They usually move on to trying to pick me up thru praise and that's when I drop the voice, I'm 50 years old and smoked most of that time, I sound more like Leonard Cohen the anything else.     
---
I have over 10 thousand hours in fallout games, and about 4 thousand in the creation kit, so far just passed 1200 hrs in 76. I do still get schooled on some things, there is always something more to learn in these games.
---
I had the best luck at Miner's Monument.
---
It's random and that's completely arbitrary, but that's my two cents.
---
Was that today? 
---
Because I've used the same L2 character since it was in game &amp; up until today its all been L50
---
I was looking for a great place to build that would really suit me: Quiet, out of the way, and with few distractions. After running around looking for the asylum so I could join the Brotherhood I caught a view of a little area that was perfect. I came back the next day and start building. Didn't realize after that I also have a view of [this.](https://i.imgur.com/b3x7nyO.png) Now I need more plans to make the observation deck more cozy.
---
This is interesting information. Everybody except you told me they had max level legendaries from Purveyor, with low level characters.
---
In Aus it's $9 pre-owned for PS4 from eb games. I think that's hilarious.
---
That's really cool ! ... But where's the throne made of the skull of your victims &gt;:( ?
---
placeable spawn would be abused - as the non placeable spawn gets abused now....
---
No, the day after it released actually. Kept hearing about people getting max lvl stuff from mules (which Bethesda said themselves was a bug) so I figured I'd try it so I wouldnt have to transfer. Guess my file didnt include the bug.
---
I pulled that exact weapon at Berkley station an hour ago.....
---
I know. I’ve played a lot of online games and never had a problem with my online saves. Sort out takes away playing online and not just playing a solo game. I think what happened with mine is I deleted someone I added to help in the game and realise maybe I should of exited the game to do it. I’ve  added this person back to see if that worked but it didn’t.
---
It's hilarious that i have a problem and come to reddit to see post about the same thing. Idk i just turned the game off
---
Everything get abused eventually :/ But spawning outside of the camp could avoid it for a bit, no ? (No trap here after all)
---
Thanks for the replys
---
the way it works is if it rolls an item that can't be that low of  a lvl lets say combat armor for instance you will then get the maxed lvl item ,,so items like hunting rifle and wood armor you will get the low lvl item because there are low lvl versions of those ..does that make sence?
---
Well I guess you can do this until the next update.
---
You are supposed get gear based on your level. Max level gear for low level players is a bug and will be fixed soon.
---
yeah I think so, idk I feel like something could be done I just don't know what
---
They should add a slug modification to shotguns.
---
yut and good hunting
---
I don't hit on players in game and forgo explaining anything to anyone unless explicitly asked, I'm too old to try and help if not asked to help. Of course once you get me talking I will explain every detail of what I know on a subject with laser focus, I.E. ask me about conduit and that's a 30 minute course in uses and tricks.     
---
I love the feeling of helping someone grasp a concept when asked to do so, you can't teach an unwilling student.
---
First an FYI, Beth is changing that max level bit. They want everyone, including low levels, to be able to partake - giving each character a weapon that's close to their level.
---
I agree the scrip cap needs to be increased. Even with holding them in vendors it is still taking far too long to offload the few hours of accumulation. Increasing the daily limit to like 500, but KEEPING the Character Max 1,000 limit is a wonderful idea.
---
As of Patch 9, my game time has been solely determined by how much I can squeeze out of the system - scrip and daily caps/recycling caps for stuff I want, for one reason - my weight. I need to squeeze that scrip machine because picking up 10 legendary weapons, and 5 pieces of legendary armor is a ton of weight to hold - especially when it's done in most times I play.
---
I like running far too much, so when I hit that cap of weight for the day - my game time is done. Increased daily scrip cap = more game time 😁
---
Looking at comment below, maybe it is more wide spread. Just thought maybe they did a sly patch that only half worked or something???
---
Yeah no matter what, griefers huh... finds a way
---
Thank you!
---
Seeems right. So what do i do with legendaries, if i will hoard 100lbs of them every day?
---
I had saved corrupt on fallout 4 before, but there was always an auto save file just shortly before that worked so I could not lose everything. I wonder if this is related to them recycling code from that game. 
---
I literally fast traveled to camp, waited a moment and left world. No idea what in those actions could be corruptible.
---
Wait it's from bioshock ?! I've been playing it recently, how didn't i heard that !
---
The amount of times that I’ve killed something 15 feet away with my shotgun and still got a disease is too damn high, nevermind actually getting hit. It’s as if the game literally rolls for disease when it thinks you might get hit, rather than after you actually do.
---
Better yet, Wendigo cave has loads of both brain and glowing fungus.
---
Oh shit, you right! I thought it increased the positives. I agree that it should reduce the hunger drain.
---
B-but i like my camera :'(
---
Same experience, I was confused when other players didn’t attack him. I took 2/3 of damages and people farmed Mr. Gutsy without help. We failed obv. 
---
I didn’t know it costs 2000 caps next one, I’m disappointed.
---
I've only had it glitch out on flying targets. For example the damn cargobot that has the nuclear keycard that flies in circles. Sometimes the rocket will fly in large circles around the target until it disappears. I wanna say like 25% of the time. Same issue with vertibots. Haven't tried it yet on the scorchbeast queen. Against everything else it seems to work just fine, just the normal issues like if the target hides behind cover while the missile is en route. Never used it in pvp before. Hope this helps!
---
Just ran West Tek and Whitesprings at 18% in power armor to test.  Serendipity did not proc.   I wish that it did though!
---
&gt;  so +185 +185 to star the game is brutal 
---
?? From where are you getting the additional +10?
---
5 pieces of Vanguard is +175 (5\*35 = 175). Please share from where the extra +10 comes. Thanks!
---
I have to thank bethesda for releasing backpacks before this, because i am running around with 300+lbs of crap. 500scrip daily limit sounds good to me.
---
no the other way around, you're gonna get infected.
---
Keep N eye open in player stores I hit the plans for like 150 caps. And yes, it’s a great gun at level 50
---
What drops are you after if I may ask?
---
That makes sense, I only got wood on my L200ish character, but I guess he is a bit older :)
---
If you're on ps4 I believe I'm selling those plans cheap.
---
Im on Xbox
---
Im on Xb1
---
Bummer
---
Everything is easy in this game if you play tactical enough, just saying. Leave me your IGN or fell free to add xXDemolisher
---
ahhh i need to make a nuke list and whenever i dont know where to nuke, just look for someone on the nuke list. hell, we could even start one on reddit!
---
Yeah, I considered many of my sales may have been other players looking to resell. That didn't concern me. I actually have been struggling the past 2 weeks to find items on which to spend caps. I've hit the max 25,000 caps two or three times and have had some difficulty figuring out what else to spend the caps on so that I can get down to a level at which I can sell enough of the excess legendary items I either don't need or don't use... and avoid selling items and not receiving any caps for it because I'm already at the max 25,000.
---
I keep accidentally scrapping the skulls into bone shards.  The most worthless crafting component.
---
I think you're right. A guy bought around 1k ammo off me for 1 cap each, it looked like I only got 300 caps or so.
---
Yeah been checking everyone's vending machines for them but will try treasure maps i have about 100 or so will start doing them now to see what i get
---
Here’s what I don’t understand, whether it’s OP or some of the other PvP advocate posts and petitions I’ve seen recently...
---
Based on what you’ve written and what you say you’ve observed, it’s obvious that you know the vast majority of Adventure Mode players don’t want to engage in PvP. Why insist on forcing them to? Adventure mode is basically where those players want it to be right now. Just let them have it. 
---
Instead of spending time and energy arguing for changes to that mode—which you’ll never get—spend that time and energy advocating for the changes you want to see in Survival mode. 
---
I enjoy both aspects of the game, PvE and PvP, but I like them being separated. I like knowing that the people I’m engaging with have completely consented. I like knowing that I’m not ruining anybody’s fun. 
---
There’s a lot I’d like to see changed in Survival, it could be a lot better than it currently is. But those changes will never happen if PvP players spend their time advocating for nonsense like exploiting workshop owners across the map to get easy kills—and lets just stop pretending that was anything other than that. 
---
OP, I’ve seen you say several times that Survival was awful...how would you change it?
---
Oh - that’s why a few people don’t want to enter my night club. It looks like a death trap.
---
Hmmm my guess would be that the game still consider wood armor to be 1 star only, so when bought the game try to fix them ? (Forget it if you can loot it above 1 star T-T)
---
I had my camp there, not a good place you can't FT to the top. You have to walk the rail or have a jetpack, which I don't.
---
Best of luck.
---
A fate worst than death for them &gt;:) Even dead they're worthless &gt;:(
---
This game is quite hard sometimes but you dont need to cheat to get passed them just keep trying with different ideas
---
&gt; Yes it is exactly, because you attacked my credibility and ignored my simple point that blew you the fuck out entirely.
---
Didn't ignore your point. I raised a counter point. And you didn't "blow" up anything, you made a poor point, that was inconsistent with the lore. Hence my post.
---
&gt; No. It's an alternate timeline entirely, you daft cunt.
---
See. That's an ad hominem.
---
&gt; There are literally aluminum cans, you useless mongrel. It's not rare, you are definitely a special little snowflake, though.
---
Oh look. Another ad hominem. Are you paying attention?
---
&gt; You know what else they make out of aluminum IRL? Motherfucking airplanes, because aluminum is stiffer and lighter than steel. I mean how many kinds of wrong can you be in a single post?
---
This is why I asked if you knew the lore and story of Fallout. Because it's not "IRL". I didn't think I'd have to explain this. But apparently I do.
---
Also. It's impressive how quickly you lose your shit and resort to ad hominems when you have a poorly argued point. Didn't you say something about have a nice life? Usually that means you want to end the conversation and leave.
---
Cheers
---
I just run what I brung, I never change them.
---
Oh no. They, to my knowledge, weren't thinking of making any changes. I was just making the general statement. Because, well, you never know. Right?
---
I have put my camp in the circle build on the top and had the junkpile too.
---
Melee gets diseased like crazy, just about every encounter with a group of bad guys will result in something, and I even use the perk, it’s just crazy common
---
This is a good idea, and I’d say the percentage should be 100% it’s the CAMP healing everyone’s always wanted!
---
I wish we had some form of in game LFG channel or app.  Among my characters I run a level 100+ healer/support build.  When I bring her to an impromptu SBQ fight it would be nice to somehow flag that I’m looking for a group to heal.  Failing that I just try to revive anyone I can and tag as many mobs as I can to apply tenderizer and suppressor debuffs.  I absolutely understand refusing random group invite requests as we have all been burned.
---
But you're already good at everything - with a 10-60 seconds delay depending on what you were good at before!?
---
Yes. Yes indeed.
---
When all quests are done and no more are forthcoming.  Main story done.
---
If they add more quests in the future, then that is expansion or DLC.
---
So for the current "End-Game" that means when you have finished 95% of all content in the the game.
---
It’s getting better continually.    I hope your PS4 gets fixed soon.
---
I've named my armour "A left arm" and so on so anything not named I know I can scrap or sell it
---
I have low lvl legends for retail price, but I do don't sold anything yet. Can't ask higher prices as I'm a the cap limit if sold. Money has no value once around 25k. Can't buy stuff cuz I'm hoarding junk 😝
---
Regrettably. My low level alts had a bunch.  Now I am afraid to cash it in.
---
Thank you it will be soon but that's like a week
---
So many troubles would be avoided with text chat... I'm just waiting for the day it arrives. I know there's a PC mod that gives it, but that is not server wide IIRC. It would be so cool to have it per server. Someone could go like crap I am short on one screw for my hunting rifle, and you could actually help that person. Even with voice chat when you're short on one no one not in your vicinity will know :/.
---
Hope you can soon get back to the wasteland, best thing might be to search on you tube for “pioneer scouts” “backpacks” “legendary vendor” and once today’s update has dropped search for “project paradise” that way you’ll get a visual look at the latest content
---
I know the tactics. I’m actually pretty well known on the PS4 side to be one of the top pvpers in game. I’m just speaking from experience that the BE laser with beam splitter is way more overpowered compared to any other gun. I just want more balance in the game.
---
I'm hunting for my paramedic suit again. I had it and it disappeared 😫
---
added a few of your ideas with some small adjustments
---
Hell yes.
---
Fissure Site Sigma confirmed sealed after nuclear strike.
---
Question: does anybody know if fissure will seal if a nuke is dropped near them and not on top of them? I've discovered 6 unmarked active fissures in-game that are in such close proximity to three marked sites that 6 or more sites an be exposed to just two separate blast zones.
---
Ahh cool man i love me some spike traps i got some set up at my camp in exact direction to whitesprings clubhouse and a sign sayin you can jetpack there lol cheap to get there and fun jus bring a jet pack power armor and fly like a bird🤣😂
---
Definitely - current recipies are just not worth it. Complicated recipies should at least have the added benefits of the ingredients plus something, also they shouldn't spoil as fast or even at all.
---
No one has videos of anything on here, because none of the things posted actually happen. I'm actually 98% sure that no one here actually plays the game, they just roleplay on here.
---
Pretty sure I bought Robot Armour plans at some of the vendors in the Whitespring Mall.  I can make arms and legs, but not the chest piece.  I have bought 3 separate plans for the chest piece from various vendors but cannot make it, it just does not appear as able to craft it even when I learn the plan.  Nots sure if this quest is bugged or I'm just unlucky.
---
i always use the fandom wiki, i feel like that’s the most reliable one or it has the most useful info and usually has details for item locations and such for when i’m looking for something specific
---
I agree tc, I wouldn't mind more better gun related bonuses as everything is melee damage or perception which does nothing for gun damage may be slightly better vat aim  percentages. Anything to feel like I'm helping more with scorchqueen damage than slotting tormentor and maiming her wings
---
Wait hang on, you don't think it looks good on male characters?!
---
Getting this to when in third person, swinging my axe right at them and miss everytime. Pretty annoying.
---
but i is haves am bild ta whitesrping or mom wil no get me gam no mor
---
Because people come by and steal your water and sell them at their camps..that's why. Lol also the reason why people should lock them. Someone I met the other day invited me to trade and when I looked in his aid tab he had 1500 purified water on him. I asked why the hell does he have that many and why carry them around and his answer was "I server hop to go walk around to everyone's base and steal their water, and then I sell it for 1 cap each at my camp". I thought to myself "wow, this guy is just like the top comment on this post and gets pissy that he can't STEAL water so he brings animals to destroy someone's camp and calls it "justified karma". Douche-move!
---
Did you just link to your own post?
---
Radaway doesn't suppress mutations, Rad-x does.
---
You can add me if you want, I_was_trying.
---
Thanks the the info, just got a Stalker/Vats railway rifle and a Vats railway rifle, was tons of confused about the % when I found the accuracy in Vats was the same lol
---
I still a bits of confuse about the 'Combat' part though, is caution count as combats? Or only when I being damaged/attacked?
---
that’s cool and all, but you can still just not use the hot keys. playing as a specific build instead of swapping cards on the fly doesn’t suddenly become impossible, and the game becomes much more convenient for people who *do* prefer the convenience.
---
You’re welcome to add me I’d love to play with you, I’m in the uk though so we may not be on at the same time much? Psn- zuperfly1
---
Yeah, I can't believe he hasn't read an obscure 9 year old article either. Pathetic on him really.
---
Yeah, not happening in that event.
---
I used multiple level 2 characters and got level 45 to 50 legendaries
---
Yeah me too.  I wonder if it’s just after the last patch as can’t see any post from before that. Let’s hope tomorrow sorts it out.
---
I do at least 20 sbq every week and team with my regulars having a good laugh over mic and will normally get team requests which i ignore, on the other side i do give back i drop stuff at overseer camp at least 3 times a week and will at random follow around low levels and snipe from far after they hit a enemy. Good fun as i think they are probably freaked out by it.
---
Not if you never change your perks
---
Just test it on a cheap 1* item to see if there was any hotfix or not. If it still works I would suggest spending them while you have the chance.
---
It was a thing in fallout 4.
---
I'm well known on pc for being an asshole and top pvp hehe
---
This is not how "economy" works.
---
Sounds like a bug to me. Their is no special process to my knowledge other than assign items and connect power.
---
Are you actually serious?
---
Probably a bug.
---
Are you having to switch worlds because your camp location is taken? That's another reason this happens.
---
I'm not looking forward to doing that quest and the DMV one again.
---
That’s a great name. Add me if you want. Sir_cakigton. I’m on GMT though.
---
Whichever one added the items from the updates with the little "wild Appalachia" tag is the one to use, the others don't really update.
---
I dont repair anything anymore just use repair kits, when by armor is round 40% i use a repair kit
---
How did they hide the tripwire?
---
Also i owned the BE Laser players in survival with a simple AA/firerate build constantly befor i got my hands on one too
---
If that was the way the system was "intended to work" they wouldn't allow you to unequip perk cards... 
---
They can implement this system and then people who wish to play how you do can just not make use of it, similar to how you already are not swapping perk cards. 
---
The "Not good at everything" is simply due to the fact you can't get enough perk points (since you hit a cap at lvl 50) to use more than X number of cards and shouldn't be held back instead just from the way the UI was created (I would consider the inability to create perk card loadouts more or less of a UI decision)
---
I tried on 6 different server but later in the day it worked
---
I bought mine for 2500 but had been looking for a while and saw it so I wanted it *right then*. I know I overpaid, but I do the same for alcohol recipes. You got a really good deal
---
I k8nd of just use Google. It brings up the best answer usually.
---
I'm glad you like paying 125k to 200k for 1 item! That's what prices were at before the last dupe. FUCK THE DUPERS! right? It's funny that people that dont work at bethesda balance the economy better than they can. Also please dump any weapon you have that may have been duped, dont want anything unfair or unbalanced
---
Damage over Time. Like fire that burns you for a while, or a wound that keeps bleeding, or poison/acid effects, etc.
---
Not sure i agree here. If they didn't want us to swap perks, they wouldn't let us earn them beyond level 50. The fact that we do suggests swapping perks is a key part of the game.
---
I would KILL for wallpaper.
---
There are 6 unnamed sites. They're all in the Cranberry Bog and very close to Fissure Site Prime and Firebase LT.
---
TIL xbox has a semi chat option but pc don't.
---
Hi, I know this might be irrelevant since the post is 2 months old, but I found that music being very catchy aswell - first, you hear it sometimes in Whitesprings resort on a loop, then I heard it in Bot Stop event, and decided to look it up on the net but didn't find anything related to it apart from this post. So, after some countless hours and e x t e n s i v e research I finally found it. Turns out it's a goddamn 30second Fallout 4 elevator music loop. It was worth it
---
https://youtu.be/hLg4DYzHrEQ
---
Aaand i think a bloodied heavy gun build with a good cal.50 or tse / bloodied plasma is close to be as good as a BE laser
---
When I stopped dashboarding to server hop it hasn’t happened to me since.
---
I used to play WoW and played a female character, never thought anything of it really.   Met up with two female characters in game and they were really good players, just assumed they were males.  We played together for over 16 months usually about every time I or they found me online.      Eventually found out they were mother/daughter.  I never knew, but did not treat them any different.  Just thought it was cool.  They said they liked grouping with me because I treated them like gamers and not as female/male.
---
I have been to all Vendor bots but no luck i have learnt on my first low lvl character but can't remember where i got them from as that was just after beta lol
---
[finally got a picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/D2s7Amd) 
---
This one is pretty mild but I’ve seen like black titanium and other random junk on that row before.
---
My melee is totally broken. I stand in fort of a Scorched, hit it with my 1200 dmg Powerfist 6 times and no dmg. The next hit leaves 5 % hp left and then I need 2 more hits for killing it. Really?
---
You must be a food build.
---
I FT'd to a guys base and it was on a cliffside and there were 5 of us wondering where his base was because it was just a platform with a bunch of stairs leading off the cliff, then we noticed something, the slight edge of a sleeping bag sticking out of the side of the cliff and as soon as you interacted with the sleeping bag you were teleported and phased through the mountain wall and into this guys huge base in the mountains. It was a total trip and pretty awesome as well.
---
actually I have plenty to do I'm in a self work inflicted cycle. I need fusion cores to power my laser gat which is still fun for me to play with - for that i need to farm fusion cores so I take power plants - taking power plants uses a bit of junk because I tinker around with defenses and the base building aspects of the workshop. also I try to keep my cap stash reached daily and my vendor machines stocked any way getting all the junk for shop and workshop defenses causes me to use power cores.. aaand theres my new next thing to do. again. this time i will defend with a tower build idea I had.
---
I need to use one of the god damn end terminals because I need to buy the X0-1 Jetpack.
---
I would say from what I read that heavy weapons and melee along with stealth builds are not what you are looking for.
---
I could suggest either a shotgun, automatic rifle or pistol build that doesn't require stealth. 
---
Energy and laser weapons are not as bad as people make them out to be. Yea sure they may not deal as much damage but they still kill things.
---
Backpacks for increased carry weight and legendary vendor.
---
I wish I heard about this two months ago. Honestly, if I heard about this a week ago I would have told you to start this back up lmao.
---
There are 9 named fissure sites, and six unnamed, that spawn scorchbeasts. I hit Fissure Sigma with a nuclear strike and it sealed up. If we need to drop the nukes directly on the fissures, we need 15 nukes in one server. If not, we only need 8 or 9 strategically-placed blast zones.
---
Before I found this yesterday I started Operation Panther Den. In the last 24 hours I got 11 volunteers willing to move out after May 26 the moment we have the codes for all three silos. Your discovery that fissure sites have separate cooldown times once sealed was valuable in determining that we may need a specific missile strike pattern to keep them all closed for as long as possible, before a server goes down. If you're interested in trying again, or even how the operation goes, you can find us on facebook under "Panther Den." I don't monitor this account, I'm afraid.
---
I literally get mutant everything. Mutant spears, mutant rifles, mutant pitchforks, everything mutant.. and that sucks cause my character build does not go along with mutations
---
Yes, exactly?!
---
Pool cues and canes.  Every 3 star melee world drop I have ever received has been one of those two useless weapons.
---
Thank you.
---
Automatic rifle sounds good, and if I know right, I can make automatic laser rifles for that.
---
Also, I can use my tesla with that too. Or that one is counts as a shotgun?
---
I did I was slightly amazed. I wouldn’t have paid 2500 (I likely wouldn’t have had that much) but I was happy when I found it at all.
---
Nocturnal anything and everything....
---
I sell it at what I would be willing to pay for it.
---
But I am cheap, so most of the time its 1/2 - 1/4 the worth price.
---
I've hit max caps twice since vendors rolled out, sometimes the caps have to go, sometimes they just burn a hole in my pocket
---
Is it your actual job on this sub to boast and act like you’re a God?  I’m asking a real question here.  Your posts are so out of control dude.  There’s so much more to this game than posting every 12 hours about how awesome you are at PVP or complaining about things that counter how awesome you are at it.  It’s just dull.
---
Sometimes you have to flip it to auto. Voice has always been buggy. It’s not a guarantee but what has worked best for me.
---
I feel the caps burning even without a lot of them! But there are fantastic bargains to be had out there too. My level 50 instigating hunting rifle is my precious, someone was throwing it away for 200 caps. The thrill of bargain hunting is a fantastic addition to the game. I’m slightly bewildered that people want to be able to shop without travelling to be honest.
---
its highly debatet and a lot of people swear it doesnt work that way but a lot of people believe the legendarys you have on you and in your stadh box determine the chance to get the same legendary effects (for me im fairly sure about this as on every four characters i have a consistent pattern of same effects in my stash box)
---
I'll try that. Thanks mate.
---
what about the "gun runner" perk that increases run speed by 25%?
---
Around 1800. Grab some grape mentats before you buy though, should knock it down a bit.
---
I might be mistaken but iirc it's only 20%
---
Sort by WT without entering any tab?
---
Nope Bethesda changed it in the last patch
---
foobadoop. I play usually in the mornings (10-12, east coast time, and early in the mornings on weekends.
---
oh well, I addded the shielded bonuses and rounded down…
---
so, to be exact, with "help", we can to star in the vault with...
---
* 175DR +175ER from 5 vanguard pieces
---
* 5DR from 5 "compatible" clothes: glasses + bandana + helmet + custome + underwear.
---
* 9DR 13ER from the Enclave shielded work, that also adds 2P 3S, +15 carryweight to start!
---
so far 189DR 188ER bonuses
---
Then we have to add the base stats of the 5 level 1 pieces of armor. Level 1 leather pieces, max modded and repaired at 200% end with respectable stats!
---
Can only do it in survival now if you engage with a player
---
[My current build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e715ba8&amp;d=l71lt2ls2pd0pk0pl0sq2s32sr2cu0s12ip2ic4a80a30an2a04p00pp2s01sb2e00c72&amp;w=&amp;n=Sniper%20/%20Heavy%20Gunner&amp;m=)
---
For normal adventuring, you're a sniper with a bit of gun fu play. When things get close, or you're clearing rooms indoors, you break out the plasma flamer and melt shit. For the tough fights (SBQ, Sheepsquach, ect.) hop in your PA and go to town with a big ass gun. Starched genes is included for whatever mutations you want.
---
I designed it to work with a gauss rifle, plasma flamer, and .50 cal machine gun. You could swap the gauss and .50 cal for any other sniper rifle and heavy weapon and it will still play the same. It's not going to put up the numbers of a min/max bloodied build, but it'll get the job done for anything you need. Add consumables (psychotats, ballistic bock, ect.) and a control weapon (endangerol, cryolator, ect.) for extra effect.
---
Dangit
---
Yeeee sadly
---
Well, there went my plans
---
I don't have the luxury of getting to play with friends making the idea; If I could, I would. Your idea is understandable and very immersive though, and I'm glad that you and your friends can work together in such a way.
---
Well your not the only one effected, all the survival trolls who do nothing but destroy bases got effected to
---
Supposedly if you pick a lock on someone's camp, the turrets will turn hostile to you and then you should be able to destroy it.
---
My in game name is of a female tv character and my  character in game is female. I'm just a gay dude that likes how stuff looks on females in games...it often just looks...better.
---
Maybe, but it doesn't mean that we should stop asking. They recently said that they get a lot of their ideas from this reddit; they notice the popular posts and attempt to work in what they can, when they can.
---
I have one, but I always try for another every time I find another machine.
---
I have one to,i one shot a level 90 glowing deathclaw with it,im not even bloodied:)
---
I've not known the joy of fast traveling to camps and falling to my death or being stuck in foundations as i've been over encumbered by about 500 pounds for the past several months and don't see any possibility of that changing. I probably wouldn't fast travel anyway even if I could since it cheapens the whole exploration aspect of Fallout IMO. 
---
I don't think i've seen any trap bases yet but as I always approach them from the outside it's hard to tell. They look so innocent but anything could be going on behind those walls.
---
I sometimes run a dozen or so buffs and that's just from food! Add on top some rum or lead champagne and when things get serious some overdrive. I couldn't believe my luck when I found a player vendor selling a bunch of salt and pepper for next to nothing. I'll be taking all of that, with thanks!

Rocket Girl outfit is still no America's Ass. ;o
---
Not saying that it shouldn't be limited. Usable in [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps), stores, and maybe after fast traveling only? I don't want to be able to switch back and forth on an absolute fly. I just want it to be easier to change what I need to when I go from crafting to selling to responding to events that pop up.
---
Freaking bashing damage. I have about 5, 3\* weapons with bbbb-b-b-b-b-bbbbbaaaashing damage!
---
can you find any ignition cores?
---
Ammo! Make it ammo!
---
Hey, I have the caps now. Took a lot of work but I got em.
---
Alternatively, I suggest a complete overhaul of the perk system. A far more permanent build where your perks selected are locked. But also have the sufficient perks to have a jack of all trades or a specific weapon proficiency as well as a type of crafting. The swapping of the perk cards is unique in itself. Especially for online games. Most online games have set skill trees, especially RPGs. You pick a skill, you learn that skill, that's it. You're stuck with it. They also usually have a reset skill tree function at some cost of coinage. But that is something I'm most familiar with in an RPG mechanism. 
---
Concurrently, if they insist on the card swapping, 3 preassigned card loadouts would be absolutely tremendous. We could have our primary load out, mainly for vanquishing scorched and super mutants, a secondary load out for that other build to vanquishing scorched and super mutants that we are trying to tweak slowly, and our tertiary load out with crafting everything. 
---
Click, click - load out selected. Brilliant idea. Yes, the time spent swapping cards alone is about 10% of my game play 😢
---
You're pretty close to me at the Devil's Backbone, i'd guess you're a bit to the south of there from the angle.
---
Oop there it is
---
dude, it's called stealthboys
---
It is a good idea, but it should not work for all diseases. But the concept that there should be alternative methods to cure most diseases would be a nice one. Rest would work for some. being Well fed should help for some, radshower could work for some etc etc.

Add me r_castro33. I’ll play with ya anytime
---
Sure, the problem is food spoiling too fast and some complex food having same buff as simple food, but even if you eliminate those two problems, food is not going to play role in this game. If you are steamrolling this "endgame" content in basically gear that is vanilla, then no one is going to bother about food. I mean look at SBQ, level 35 are participating in that.
---
So basically either you redesign your endgame content or you are going to just create another alcohol content that no one really pays attention. Instead of building content, that doesn't matter, use that time and build content that matter.
---
you will spawn abit north of it, move it towards the south edge. think other players still spawn were you originally put it
---
There's also Serendipity, Dodgy, Evasive, auto-stim armor, there's a bunch of different reasons he might have avoided damage. Immediately assuming he's using an exploit is not the type of jumping to conclusions we need in this game that is already ripe with misinformation.
---
Oh no, they should not. There are companies that do just that, force overtime and extra hours. Are those companies putting out better games? Better patches? No, no they are not. I wonder why, forcing the fun out of someones work should make them produce better quality programming after all. 
---
Or not.
---
So I should either be able to carry a lot OR use a shotgun effectively?  
---
So shotgun builds can never have a high carry capacity? Why don't rifle builds get that disadvantage?
---
Lmao nice!! I’d have the same reaction! I’ve never gotten one. NEVER. I’m a long time Fallout fan, but I actually didn’t even know that the porta diners even dispensed them until someone told me - I just thought it was a gag put in by developers because, well, it’s Bethesda. Eventually I got fed up trying to get that stupid pie and just bought one off of a player vendor. :P
---
last reply is correct. finally got all the way thru. No glitches,bangs or bumps.
---
terminal and note in fort defiance is a must every time.that will unlock the vtu.
---
if the quest is in reset then you might get line in the sand ,and heart of the enemy at the same time.Saves wandering around for dna.
---
the prize at the end was what we have all come to expect tho. continue to live in hope.
---
cheers, and thanks to all for replys.
---
I can craft shielded raider under Armor! Don't ask me where or when i got it though...
---
Only started actively using reddit recently, and somewhere i've read that shielded raider is hella scarce, and I was like.... wait a Minute. 
---
I recall beeing able to craft shielded road leathers. 
---
I log into the game and voilà, i can in fact craft shielded road leathers and Raider harness stuff
---
Deadpool would be Canada's Ass.
---
If you collect a thousand swords from your defeated enemies I will craft you a throne with them. Well, I would if I could.
---
I wish they added an item called preservatives that makes your food almost unspoilable, I mean, just like IRL
---
This exactly. The amount of maths I've had to do to manage my stash in game is insane. I removed over 200 carry weight of aid from my stash I had no idea was taking up so much space because on my character it's only like 30 weight. Like an idiot for the longest time I had no idea weight on stash was so different to carry weight which is my own dumb fault
---
Troubleshooter and Blocking returns Dmg....
---
I dont mind em, I one shot it with my power fist with 250 damage
---
Stealth rifle builds yes, but any tard telling you that vats build are the best are simply wrong. It's a crutch build but vats is avoidable even without stealthboys. 
---
FULL HEALTH BEATS BLOODIED. Remember this. Bloodied works for surprise and finesse but is NOT meta. A full health commando build is hard to take down especially if using every anti vats perk he can.
---
I am basically bulletproof even without +250DR while reloading. Being bulletproof in PVE, is not something that is hard to achieve.
---

Stealth boy + Secret Agent = 2 full minutes cloaked, Mark 3 stealth boy is 6 mins with the same perk

lol i just spent 20 minutes figuring out which armor to wear and moving weapons and food back and forth a bunch of times
---
Of course, because exploits don't exist.

---
Someone must be the Gourmands greatest fan. Pity the Dark Brotherhood got to him before Vault-Tec did.
---
Yes megaluigi is correct. However your post is still somewhat accurate. Stealthboy tesla gunning is certainly the meta for skirmishes which is such a cheesy way to play lol
---
Have no fear of you want to destroy still you can! Just lead a pack of monsters to the base and sit back and watch them go to town!
---
Pretty damn sure they're craft-only
---
It helps if you have a radshower at your base as well
---
only way to cause harm to someone's camp is to be in active PVP with the person in adventure mode. unsure about survival. since i never go there
---
pretty much all the ones i don’t want
---
Gosh, that would make the daily challenges requiring pictures of other players almost doable. LFG to finish dailies, LFG for recover other player in water. LFG to eat some s'mores and chill.
---
That's what I think too but why the hell does the quest say "find"
---
You got cloth?
---
And a not-so-thank you to the two guys mowing me down with tse miniguns
---
Besides those three, f76 has been a really great community recently
---
I tend to get lots of 1 star Exterminators stuff.
---
Intresting and sounds fun! I consider to zry this out, thank you :)
---
No reason to accept a random team invite imo. If someone wants to join your team for a good/valid reason, they can send a message saying so.
---
have a newer example, say since last patch?
---
i think it works for types, ie. Raider or Ranged Weapon but that’s about it. I avoid picking up Robot, Wood, and Marine and I rarely get those as drops. Once an event awards me one of those types, then it’s game on and I get a bunch of those for a couple days.
---
Biv's recipes.  500/beer, 750 mixed drinks, 1k+ Cranberry Moonshine/White Russian/Nuka Dark.
---
Things I have too much of, that if I had none I would be desperate for. (Disease Cure, serums, sometimes foods).
---
I sell weapons that are worth using, for reasonable prices.  Anything that I wouldn't buy, if I was using that playstyle, goes to the Mole-Man for Mole-Man-Money.
---
Oh I'll keep that in mind, thank you! All I ended up doing was explode all their cats lol
---
I went with a more traditional trap. 
---
If you walk to my camp, you're fine. You'll see the danger long before you would ever accidentally trigger it.
---
But if you fast travel to my camp, you wake up Dave, my resident Behemoth. He lives in my pond and watches my stuff. He doesn't like to be startled.
---
I started on getting all the serum recipes when I hit max caps the first time.  Hasn't paid off in profit yet, but they've been selling here and there and totally worth it to be able to get more caps coming in.
---
It's hard to find videos on it, because it's been useless since survival, but here's some guy within the last month.
---
Well shit, seems I need to start this game up again, this sounds interesting!

Could you explain a little more how you accomplished this?
---
The RPG elements of Fallout are just one part of what drew me into the series. What keeps me playing is exploring the world that they built. I recently started playing Fallout 3/New Vegas again with the TTW mod (almost no load time with NVMe!) and I still occasionally stumble on things I've missed in my previous playthroughs.
---
Fallout 76 does the exploring part just as well as the old games, if not better, due to the more varied environments.
---
I'm always overencumbered and in Europe so I might not be your ideal wasteland companion, but I'll drop my psn here just in case.  retrnsnxchngs
---
Yeah but throwing hundreds of bullets is fun. I have a B gatlign gun and a B minigun, I prefer the later, way more fun than just a boring "pom pom pom".
---
Well that was before I looted a AA FFR LMG of course. This thing taught me to burst fire for sure.
---
yup - agreed along with power armor being a death sentence the ability to stack damage to be able to one shot players, they fixed the horrible death penalty though 50 caps at getting my butt kicked makes me more willing to at least try to fight back once. I have anjoyed a lot of pvp in a lot of games but i am hating the pvp mechanics of 76 and try to avoid it most of the time.
---
Seriously, gamemechaniks im fallout just don't work in pvp.
---
The massive amount of aid items for buffing and healing. The legendary effects. As many explosives as you can carry. Vats. The buggy engine.
---
Bethesda forced pvp on a system that can't handle it. It's a mess. Additionally most fallout veterans don't like pvp in general.
---
The result is a widely disliked pvp modus. (don't know, how ppl here on reddit sees it, but I can assure you, that non of my friends ever enjoyed pvp in this game)
---
A working pvp mod in this game would acquire drastical restrictions in terms of weapons, perks, and aid items, as well as adjustments regarding player health and damage.
---
Sometimes less is more.
---
Upvote.
---
Vampiric automatic rifle. Simple handmade does the trick, but if you want to go crazy go for minigun. But simpliest most basic of them all... Stimpacks. Later in the game you make so much stimpacks, that you press just X and your hp is back to 100%. You are no longer "hard to kill", you are "impossible to kill".
---
Was browsing shops as usual when I saw someone selling a Anti Armor Crossbow for a low price and picked it up instantly. Been using it to turn lvl 50+ enemies into pincushions with my sneak vats build and it's honestly half decent even without the prime mod. Like everyone else I wish they gave it more attention and hoping they do that in the near future due to so many people liking the weapon. It's literally the ultimate stealth weapons and I've always enjoyed using bows over guns in fps games due to them feeling so satisfying to use. The weapon is weird though whenever I've used it, noticing it functions more like a shotgun than a sniper rifle with falloff range being a major issue.
---
I can get behind that. kek
---
If you take ghouls there you can boost their health with the gamma gun
---
Nuking it still works
---
This or the corner stairs that were in F4 in Boston. Half stairs up, small platform where you turn, half stairs continue up.
---
Honestly, if I get glitched into a foundation or spawn in a locked room, I just go to the next camp.
---
Isn’t some of this buggy though too? You can show up in an area but that doesn’t mean you’ll trigger it. Don’t know why Bethesda didn’t just put them all on the terminal but then again that would be a bunch of dailies but I wouldn’t mind. They are dailies after all
---
Pvp in 76 is basically as chaotic as the the whole fallout world is. I can basically one shot anyone with my anti armor black powder rifle with +50% crit dam. After stacking chems and using firecracker berry juice to bump crit dam even more my crits are gnarly. Meanwhile I still get killed plenty, it's all over the place in that game.
---
I guess I better drop off all my junk before I ever visit a vendor. All fun and games till someone takes my hard earned loot.
---
but  hey I know where you live and my artillery would love to meet your camps foundation.
---
I wanna go to your camp. Please say you're on Xbox
---
Exactly. All obtainable ones are done.
---
Changing the key binding worked for me
---
Stalker's melee weapons &amp; +damage for VATS crits on low DPS weapons.
---
I don't see any of my friends playing PVP neither do I. It's no fun too bugged too unrewarding. Separate servers for that is also dumb. I voted for something like a wilderness. PVP on normal servers in special areas which give a benefit. Guaranteed 3\* Hard monsters. Or even a special 4\* Monster that would add something to it. So players who want to have the top stuff need to get there the others have to buy it.
---
This here. I'd say out of all of them it's the Mire outfits that are the rarer of the bunch as according to datamining they have the lowest drop rate to start plus most the dailies there are bugged and don't start so it's pretty much 0 chance if you don't get one on the first run.
---
Bro. Over made like 3 posts ever about PvP. Most all of my posts are suggestions for more content or questions about the game. Is it your job to come on here and be a condescending prick and be over dramatic and blow things put of proportion? I'm asking a real question here.
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Yes, usable in CAMPs and stores only (i don't agree with fast trave, too easy) would be a great QoL improvement and preserve the perk balance!
---
We're all going to run in there solo and either
---
A: get murdered and come on here complaining it's too hard/literally unplayable
---
B: murder everything and come on here complaining it's too easy/literally unplayable
---
Then just play.. you dont NEED a build.. im almost lvl 165 and I can DO ANYTHING.. you will have more than enough perk cards.. then you can be whatever whenever... I'm just against 'builds'
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
Use this site to tinker, I use power armor and vampiric laser gatling so my build wouldnt work for you 
---
my build centers around fusion cores for ammo but I hardly ever craft, swap perks or server hop, I can facetank the queen and all the bog but im only about 20% win in pvp. If I were in your shoes I would build around the campiric .308 and i would always capture the ammo factory and be prepared to make lots of ammo. My IGN name is garlandtd if you want someone to discuss things with. also I can demonstrate how not lame lasers gatling can be :)
---
People need to design their defenses better. 
---
All the time I see people place turrets that couldn't even target an enemy attacking their camp due to line of sight. Spotlights are also very important to have, but not many people use them. It's not hard to design a self defending base, but you do need to put a little thought into it. The mire throws some nasty stuff at your camp sometimes, but my camp can easily protect itself with 5 turrets. That's not a lot of budget. People in the forest could probably get away with two.
---
Players "rent" them for 2K
---
Food, water and Raiders would be a bigger concern i suppose. I don't mind to be honest, it tells a great story about the bleakness of man in the future and one of the things i love about Fallout. Each their own i guess!
---
It posted a 4 day delivery for me, so I just drove to get it.
---
I don't care about others, just let me have my immersion gameplay if thats what I want and let others play the way they wan't to!
---
Not those two - scrip scrip! Thanks for the info tho.
---
that was like the first thing I did. If I have  a PTT I usually put it on my mouse, since I have a button next to my thumb that is easy to use.
---
&gt; When all quests are done and no more are forthcoming *[ ... ]*  ~~If~~ *[ when ]* they add more quests in the future, then that is expansion
---
We know that more are forthcoming.
---
The whole "it's DLC" thing makes sense for a game that you buy, buy a few addons then that's it.
---
That's not how FO76 is planned to work.  There is no reason for the game to ever end, assuming people keep playing it.
---
A better name for it would be "stuff to kill time while waiting for next part of the story", rather than "end game content".
---
Up with you!
---
During the last maintenance i head a bit back to fo4 and build exactly this. A settlement of small vault houses and tought how great it would look if the put that in.
---
I got a 3 star mutant slaying bone club with +50% limb damage and +1 agility
---
First mod on private server: Place everywhere!
---
Bethesda wants you to travel all CAMPs to find out if there is some for sale, so that you waste hundreds of caps.
---
Fallout 76 Reddit edition.
---
World of warcraft had too epic items, buffs, healing,... and it had so great PvP! Just learn to play and stop crying :P :D
---
There is. It had the satchel and everything... you just had to buy it for like 750 atoms when the game first came out... I think that was one of the first items they took OUT
---
If it is a bugfix, why doesn't a stack of fermentables ferment all at once rather than seperately?
---
Because people would abuse it by waiting till a fermentable was about to be done, then craft 10 more.
---
Stuff should spoil individually
---
After many hours - deathclaws and Sierra Bravos are no danger at all.
---
Yao Guai, Mr Gutsys or Mirelurk Kings instead... Oh dear.
---
I moved my desk I had under the stairs and couldn't put it back. I was very angry for a good while and played other characters to forget about it.
---
Good to know the old rug glitch still works. Pity you can't remove it.
---
I habitually carry pepper with me and make the Scorchbeast mixed meat stew...
---
More purifiers = more storage for water, not faster production. Camps have 1water/5min production rate, as I can remember. So, try to wait longer, all powered purifiers will be filled with water eventually.
---
Yeah I know it's not faster production, I built so many just to have more water storage. I've already tried waiting and nothing happens with the ones that aren't producing anything.
---

---
oh I just wanted to point out that discounting pvp I find the new mutations combined with jetpack make power armor even better than fallout 4 for me. marsupial plus bird bones plus jetpack is some super nice mobility and the fusion core consumption is not that bad at all. so even though my build is probably not for you I wanted you to see it.
---
built around my vampiric laser gat the strengths are - no crafting of meds,  ammo, I farm watermelons so no cooking either. no repairing armor or looking for ballistic fiber, the X-01 is very durable and repaired far easier. my build is super lazy to play, just one weapon no going in and out of inventory no constantly swapping equipment I tend to kill the queen with one hand while sipping coffee. good for me maybe not others who could find it a bit boring. 
---
I think if you altered my build around the vampiric .308 and focused on taking the ammo factory and ammo production you would be pretty happy. if you dont like stealthing and easy gameplay.
---
WEAKnesses are. I am not good at pvp. I tend to lose 80% of the time and only beat players when they're playing badly. I dont have to craft ammo but I do take the powerplant workshops for fusion core farming . they fill up every 24 minutes. so I have a timer going to not waste production time and sometimes that can stress me a little if im past pickup time and im still halfway through a side project. being "on the clock" so to speak is probably the biggest annoyance i have with this build but its not constant because after i stockpile 50 or so fusion cores i feel i can relaxe and not hurry back to the plant all the time.
---
Buff complex recipes, even if it means adding a perk card like Cola Nut that doubles/triples the advantages of complex food recipes.
---
A good idea to buff most recipes is to just be a little more lenient on the amount of ingredients needed.  Not necessarily removing entire ingredients, but for example, does a Cranberry Meatball Grinder really need *3 pieces of scorchbeast meat*? The scorchbeast is a huge creature, so 1 piece of scorchbeast meat should be enough.  And are 3 cranberries really that necessary as well?
---
I've made my own thread about this next issue, but another big thing would be add a way for players to craft their own salt, pepper, and spices.  Sugar can be crafted using snaptail reeds, but these three cooking ingredients can't, which means you can only find them in the game world, and they weigh a lot more than they probably should.  Make these ingredients craftable, and a lot more food recipes won't be as inconvenient to create because you need to find salt, or pepper.
---
First you have to pay your GAS debt lol
---
Bloody hell! It's taken me this long to almost complete the first level on one character!
---
thank you this was the issue.
---
Is this for real? Holy shet Bethesda do something? Developers pelase fix your game, again..
---
It's not really worth having to go through menus. I've had to use a notepad and pen.
---
This is my biggest problem. The only justification I can see is to avoid free flying structures. Then make walls support floors if you don't want flying carpets. You still have these extremely unrealistic CAMPs hoovering in the air supported by just one set of stairs. It creates more problems than it solves, and more importantly, it creates problems for those who try to build realistically!
---
Learning to play and having complete broken mechanics such as...
---
Literally invulnerability to damage for as long as your being shot at
---
and
---
Weapons that can shred players with EXTREMELY high resistances to that damage type near instantly without any perks 
---
Shouldn't exist in this kind of game.
---
It gets to the point where the only way to kill other players is to run around with Tesla's yourself and just shooting at your own feet in hopes the arches hit and kill your opponent who is permanently cloaked and doing the exact same thing to you. Its fucking stupid and requires zero skill, only knowledge of what is broken and how to abuse it.
---
Think it might be a fixed amount. Have only really used Perfect storm in regards to burning dmg. I'm more curious if the burning dot refreshes the suppressor and tenderizer perk cards.
---
So because some people may abuse a separate system this system should have its bug left alone? Go away.
---
I might need to revisit Fo76 havent been playing for months.
---
Is the game playable with a broken left trigger to aim?
---
If I pick a tato, then 15 minutes later pick another tato. That second tato should have a separate spoil meter, not simply stack and start half spoiled because the first one has been picked earlier.
---
the way the system works now with all items in a stack spoiling together means that I can pick a fresh item and literally have it go bad in a second if the item in my inventory that it stacks with is about to go bad.
---
Broken system is broken.
---
Unfortunately I must bring up the fallacy that what your saying is simply not true. Without constantly follow up damage like explosive you CANNOT one hit kill other players period.
---
This along with some of the other broken mechanics I've metioned, I've also tested. One of my friends and I tested an Explosive Harpoon Gun with Flechette (it does 1043 damage), that when I hit him. One shot him, putting him into the revivable state, then I hit him with an Instigating Harpoon Gun also Flechette (which with Instigating active deals almost 700 damage) and he survives with like 10% of his health left.
---
He tried the same premises for me, but without swapping weapons, punching me with a Power Fist that should deal something like 1100 damage with Instigating and I survive with about 10% or so of my health.
---
Without explosive or some other effect (like fire or rapid fire weapons) players cannot ohk one another anymore. (This is my experience in Survival at least, Adventure I kind of mind my own business and play Mr.GoodieTwoShoes, Survival on the other hand if I see you I'm killing you because that's just the type of toxicity the environment of the game mode creates)
---
Didn’t say it was a perfect or even good system. I said they fixed a bug and that is not a debate.
---
Handmade is absolutely one of the best ranged weapons in game.
---
Yeah I built my camp into a bar/restaurant type thing and made a load of booze ready for player vending. I've now torn the whole thing down and sold all my food and drink to robots since no players are interested in anything even for 1 cap.
---
While you can't really use them with a build based around strength the Handmade is always a great gun.
---
If that fails you could always find a shotgun. I regret ever selling my quad legendary shotgun it was a beast.
---
Dear god don't scare me like that. This thing has been a blessing for my food build. I have constant plus 2 or 3 buffs to most of my stats. I am amazed at how long everything lasts now. It just says a 60% slow down, but it seems so much longer than that.
---

By any chance are they unlocked and maybe other people as they come through you camp helping themselves to some water?
---
For science...... It must be done.
---
I see that now... good find.. been wondering this whole time why they set the body's where you cant see the num.. it's a good sign.. we may get people someday.. not any time soon
---
Never built one myself, I did build a puzzle one with coded doors and lock pick challenges near the overseer camp for newbies - at the entrance door it simply said "Win a prize" and at the end was a little bag full of supplies.
---
I'd say only 1 in every 10 made it through - the rest blasted there way out and took off.
---
Good laugh though for all involved
---
I named my marine wetsuit under armour and mask, they are now gimp mask and gimp suit, also named all the different power armour to their respective names
---
The Handmade Rifle will never let you down!!
---
There is 1 ranged weapon that beats out just about any in DPS right now but most of the people who have it aren't talking about it because they don't want Nerfthesda to catch wind.
---
I think the weekly updates happen around 5 or 6 hours from now. 
---
I could be wrong but who knows.
---
They ruined shotguns recently. That's why you are seeing less and less of them. Now ots shifting back to a blooided meta.
---
&gt;  even a fresh 3lvl character will get max level legendaries from Purveyor. 
---
That's a bug and will be fixed.  Possibly today.
---
spent hours last night trying to make one building and got extremely stressed due to issues with the stairs...should have gone to bed early instead hahaah
---
Still when I use my combat dagger with faster swingspeed and the perk martial arts to attack several times a second the supermutants seem to parry me a lot and the parry stunns me so they can get their power attack in. Super annoying. And as said, I can't parry anything due to timing and I can't jump away because of their reach and they for height of jumps they still hit me as long as I'm not on a roof, but the same height as a roof? No problem.
---
Yeah. I played my tiniest violin for them.
---
struggling with my builds lately, would love more options too
---
Nope they're locked and I spent a long time guarding them myself. No one's been to the camp :/
---
Yeah probably
---
I sure would like to see that!
---
I just wish spiral staircases were a thing we could place. Something other than the single, ugly option we have now.
---
Considering camp stays in the world as long as player does (meaning no offline trade) - this is good request.
---
&gt;knowledge of what is broken
---
That's part of skill, knowing which walls are shootable throught in counter strike for example.
---
U can still sneak shoot most people, after sentinel assasin nerf noone should survive more than 4shots from decent gun. I don't play much survival, because i don't like loosing my shit and your inventory get full pretty fast on that mode, but i have kill egouth people since beta to know, that everyone is killable now.
---
So yeah get gut, improve your build agains tesla spamer if you have problem with them.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Didn't work for me, maybe just a glitch.
---
&gt;PvE sucks atm nothing to do
---
We have different expectations from FO76, I was not being flippant when I said tri hunting rabbits or other critters. I really enjoy adventure mode and spending my time skulking about with carnivore mutation surviving on found meat and found fluids complimented with my camp produced water.
---
I really do avoid other players as to me they are dangerous just like other apex creatures in the game, I like to think I am surviving my being solo. I only have a single player in my friends list because their vendor camp was awesome and I want to visit it again sometime maybe for trade.
---
Horses for courses I guess, you do you, and I'll do me :)
---
Yeah they really need to just not allow teammates to be able to edit your camp.
---
I dont have kill camp.. i got death camp, inside my base there is a little cave that is closed with garage door, if you open it, 2 max level yao guiai spawns a kill you. But if i keep it closed they are just chilling there.. its pretty good, sometimes they are legendary and they respawn everytime some1 visits me.
---
yes they are tougher. if i couldnt jump onto a nearby roof, i would have died many times to these monsters
---
I like to keep up with the times, ahead of the curve, I am the tip of the spear :D
---
But there isn't anyone left to mutilate and hang.
---
The cranberry meatball grinder wasn't that difficult as all the ingredients are readily found in the bog. I think the hardest one was the brain bombs due to the reasons you stated (i'm over-encumbered so the trek over to Point Pleasant and back was quite troublesome.)
---
Just anecdotal, but I feel like it rains more often in the cranberry bog.
---
I thought they had done something similar to Sea of Thieves? All my instruments seem to loop up in time 😏
---
Lol, well ironically I did get the Gatling Gun which is TSE before the nerf which was excellent, so I can appreciate that at least
---
Funnily enough just did it by shooting a grenade with the pipe syringe to get the killing blow.
---
The best ones are the pies you find in cafeterias which have presumably been sitting there for 25 years in a pristine state and as soon as you pick them up they start spoiling.
---
I will have posted this on the other replys too, but what sort of legendary perks do we look at on this? 
---
I imagine two shot is still viable of course. What makes them so good?
---
You can tell I don't have much experience with rifles lol, always been a melee boy lol
---
Actually think I did sever hop to get mothman eggs maybe that's it
---
Sorry the title is wrong... 'requires US to drop A nuke'..
---
I got a Quad crossbow with 250DR while reloading. Something else I forget.
---
Quite fun. It was my first  purveyor item. I recommend this gun to crossbow enthusiasts.
---
Hell the way your presenting your argument is like for what is cheap, me and a friend both have over 400 ER without even being in Power Armor and Tesla's melt you in what feels like under a second. their is no way to improve when the dudes your fighting are permanently invisible with guns that don't even have to aim, they just need to be close enough to shoot in your general direction and the arching damage will maul you in a split second.
---
I mean for fuck sake at least with Explosive you actually kind of have to shoot at the persons feet to damage them, Tesla on the other hand? Nope you can fire the shit at a wall 20 feet of their shoulder and the arch will still strip like a quarter of their health away...
---
Also killable yes? Reasonably killable? absolutely not, if you encounter anyone with Serendipity 3 they will eat enough damage to kill them like 100 times over before dropping which to me again, requires no skill and shouldn't exist.
---
Please don't act like abusing absolutely broken mechanics in anyway is skillfull or requires much thought or effort, any idiot can read my first post and go...
---
Hell the way your presenting your argument is like, and I'll use your own analogy. Imagine your playing Counter Strike with wall hacks and aimbot, your not actually good, your just killing people because your using crutches/cheating, and everyone else should just download wallhacks and aimbot too to make it fair...
---
Serious about what?
---
Whoever figures out how to get Place Anywhere to work on Fallout 76 whenever they start mod servers is going to be a god among men.
---
In my eyes they fixed the shotguns. But the shotguns need a damage buff to non explosive shots. If you build a shotgun vats crit build it still destroys everything in range but as soon as you are out of range you may as well just try kill it with toe nail clippings.
---
Comeon wall hack is not part of game, that is hacking. Using tesla is part of game. U die because you think DR/ER/RR have any effect. Do you know there are armor reducing perk on every weapon? Yeah get serendipity, lone wanderer and other things that actualy reduce damage.....
---
That stealth exploit is shitty move, so was camping with full sentinel+assasin set.
---
Fo76 pvp is not the best ever made, but it does work somehow, you are speaking here like you are super pro, but you have only basic knowleage about game mechanics. We can argue whole day and never find who is right. So have fun not playing broken game :)
---
Happened to me too. 3 turrets disappeared but still taking up CAMP budget.
---
You can mod it to hold up to 80 rounds with a drum magazine. It's very accurate, has a nice RoF and modded for recoil it's a pleasure to use.
---
Legendary effects can vary. I use Instigator (it was a gift) which is really nice. My goal is to get Furious Explosive/Faster RoF. Some swear by Bloodied or TSE.
---
There is a perk for shotguns to reduce weight. Only rifles seem to be lacking it.
---
Too many self righteous dweebs on here I agree lol.
---
This. This is everything.
---
Jump after today’s patch with new event
---
Invest in some Unyielding gear for extra CHA boost. Only need about 20 with Hard Bargain 3 to get the best prices for your selling pleasure.
---
Thank you. I'll try to alter my build aruond the LMG (like, move some INT to STR, remove battery inclueded and add the normal ammo reduction).
---
.308 is easy to come by, I can kill a few level 1 scorched and voila, they drop a lot.
---
Hmmm interesting. Well by using my shop profits I have been collecting all the vendor plans I can find. Been recently clearing out the vendor at Watoga station who has a lot of rifle mods it seems.
---
Think I may go again for TSE since I already have demolition perk cards and Grenadier cards maxed from my gatling gun. 
---
I think ill have to have a look tonight at building myself a rifle to do some practical testing before I start trying to a legendary one.
---
On a side note, not being  much of an online gamer I had to google 'pug'  
---
For others like me; here be the definition.  
---
&gt;They are the same thing. Folks that come from a MMORPG lineage, especially WoW, will tend to call them PUGs (Pick up groups). PUG is also defined as "Pick up game" in some circles. Folks who haven't been in the MMORPG scene may simply refer to them as Pub, short for Public Groups.  
---
&gt;All told, the common vein is that these are games with people you don't know.
---
I’ll tell you, buckle up, buckaroo!
---
Rifles are great! The handmade in particular, because it’s base damage is higher than the other combat rifles. On top of that it is highly modable, and can have both armor piercing magazines, and drum magazines. From testing, it’s recoil and stability when firing, especially with full auto, is immensely better than say the combat rifle.
---
Now, for another insane weapon we’re looking at the railway rifle. One of the best in the game as well. Even higher base damage, option for full auto as well. But significantly higher recoil and such. This is really good with say, VATS builds, cause of this, and is probably the most sought after weapon on the market right now.
---
Unless you’re running bloodied build with these, and you’re going for PVE, I’d recommend commando perk cards, with the full auto mods on, and either the furious legendary mod, or say two shot (unless you’re using VATS). Anti armor works, but is useless against many enemies, and is more reserved to PVP.
---
Any questions?
---
I prefer be trapped by a troll (always’never happen) than in a foundation because Bethesda is not able to put a point of spawn.  There is less troll than camp to visit.
---
This is the definitive answer.
---
Ok so this has nothing to do with the update but I think it would be awesome for the game. What if you could build a terminal that when players access it they can choose something like “player X would like to play musical instruments with you” and it would send you a notification if they did. I just think it would be awesome. In fact I have so many different ideas that I think would be cool it’s not funny. Like maybe a bayonet for the black powder rifle but you had to do a grafton quest for it.
---
You should've waited and tracked him using the map to his base and orbital striked it lol.
---
I was getting the slap damage from a TSE in the imposter event once from this guy, and I kept killing him over and over until he sent me a message calling me a bitch, whore etc haha. Not my fault you're stupid enough to keep repeating the same mistake lol.
---
Nope, not right. Last night my lvl 15 character rolled a 3* lvl 50 10mm pistol.
---
Oh yeah, ps4 name is Indytechnerd
---
Agree. Sometimes if you want to talk you have to switch to area or team.
---
yeah that smg eats it fast as hell though lol i could see that being my only problem with that build. I think with the double ammocraft perk in agility and super duper in luck - would help that. the silos are excelent sources of lead steel is easy as hell to comeby - plus the ammo factory workshop will make batches of it for you - i can see it being very doable even for me and i hate crafting anything lol . good luck man o7
---
100% on this. Though honestly, even just doing recipes in general gets boring to me. When I cook, I don't stick exactly to the recipe, and I don't get the same results every time. I also don't get just one portion every time.
---
I admit that this is more than a little beyond the scope of a simple suggestion, but I'd like cooking that's more like...well, cooking. Or at least more like Alchemy in The Elder Scrolls. Give me a recipe that's more like a skeleton. Some ingredients might be mandatory in some recipes, but in general it's just something like, "Liquid + Two Vegetables + Meat = Soup". Maybe have some with optional ingredients. Give the ingredients properties, and the effects of the finished dish are based on the combination of ingredients used to make it.
---
I personally like the idea of having melt downs at the power plants. It happens once or twice a day. You get nuked flora, some glowing enemies, either less or not as high of a level as to not take away from launching.
---
Here's some more data. My lvl 15 character has gotten only max lvl stuff, meanwhile my lvl 27 character has gotten both lvl 25 and max lvl stuff. What Tanaas said is wrong btw.
---
Haha, bullshit.  
---
Nobody uses Reddit mobile.
---
If they start attacking you before you jump, they ignore elevation yes.
---
That's the way I'd approach it.
---
Yea that would be great
---
That is indeed, exactly what's going on. They ignore elevation if they start swinging before you jump
---
I didn’t even mentions the Pioneer scouts, Burrows, or the limited seasonal events.    😜
---
Oh i guess i forgot to add "/s" lol. I don't lock mine because I'm not that greedy and get plenty just out in the world and figure if anyone needs the water they can get it. They are still always full when I go back to my camp anyway.
---
I have so many I've started using them to heal instead of stimpaks.
---
I got Carnivore, Marsupial, Speed demon, Chameleon. All 250 each.
---
12 luck and 6 charisma.they've worked for every pet i had. I think it's a problem of loading. I have a full stash and like 350-on me. Or it could be that the backpack conflicts with the spawn mechanics. I'm just randomly guessing at this point.
---
Are you still online? I'm really lacking of lead and plastic, my psn is pajisdelic
---
Oh well hopefully its fixed in the next updste
---
Wendingos and Ferals it is then!
---
Exactly: The amount of time spent gathering the resources for crafting food is far too high given that all cooked foods spoil: You're putting all this effort into something that you can't prep ahead of time.
---
Yeah I’ve gotten used to it but it still annoys me every once in a while, especially when there’s a lot of enemies around or fighting the SBQ
---
So now you’re adding in self-imposed limitations to justify your point, instead of looking at a reasonable compromise. 
---
Here’s the reasonable compromise; perk loadout hotswapping cannot be done while in combat, and still requires you to access the perk screen itself. In the perk selection screen is the option for the ‘selection wheel’, which is greyed our/disabled while you’re in combat.
---
Ah, I'm not in need of any of those, unfortunately. I'm looking for twisted muscles, healing factor, grounded and maybe scaly skin. Thank you anyways.
---
So many acronyms
---
No point doing a reinstall that doesn’t work.
---
6 months old video lol
---
Sorry.. didnt want to have wild app and nuclear winter making it any longer
---
You do realize that the arch damage from the Tesla Rifle seems to bypass your damage resistances right? I don't know how many times in this topic I've mentioned or hinted at that fact. When shot directly with the Tesla my health bar barely moves, when that arch hits you its like"good bye 25% of my health", this can be done without even having associating damage perk cards, and even having Grounded which nerfs your damage.
---
Also mentioned that Serendipity literally MAKES YOU IMMUNE TO DAMAGE WHEN IT ACTIVATES, which ironically a Telsa arch can still manage to kill you through because its apparently raw unlisted damage. (much like Explosive damage was in Fallout 4 where their was only effectively two ways to mitigate it and that was to either wear power armor or use Dense Lining on your chest piece, except in this case their is essentially no way to stop yourself from getting bent over a table by the arching damage, other than to just be lucky enough to not get hit by it)
---
For someone advocating to just get gud you also seem to overlook that fact that players have access to these kinds of tools. (according to my buddy during a nuke on Fissue Prime, he had Serendipity proc nonstop for somewhere between 2-5 minutes straight due to the constant incoming damage seemingly refreshing the effect without any internal cooldown, and all of my friends have experience instances where players we're shooting at simply do not seem to take damage or die for several seconds. On the flip side, my one buddy who had zero ranks of Commando and Grounded was killing the two guys using the Stealth Glitch in like 3-4 shots) How is that not broken?
---
Git gud in this case might as well just be a fight fire with fire situation, and has nothing to do with bettering my play style or build as I typically wreck an overwhelming majority of players myself and my friends encounter. Same server we were in about an hour prior to the engagement with the glitchers, we were fighting a 4v4 and absolutely dominating, killing this other group of guys 10 to 1 easily.
---
So while yes everyone has access to abuse this shit, its not fun to play against and needs some serious changing, which is the whole point of the thread. Game desperately needs another balance pass.
---
Yes...
---
Like several other quests, I found this confusing primarily due to the formatting. 
---
It lists two main items to investigate and then has a separate item for optional clues (4/5). To me, that indicated that the two main items which were listed were unrelated to the remaining clue &amp; I needed to continue searching before moving on...  when in fact one of them actually is the remaining clue. 
---
(I'm sure you figured this out by now, just leaving this here in case anyone else arrives via google)
---
I think the lever action is the best. With all the rifleman perks and bloody mess you get 171 damage per shot. Add gun fu and concentrated fire head shots and blam blam blam blam blam, rooms cleared in seconds. 
---
Speed demon mutation means you reload fast. Accuracy and range are great. Quad ammo legendary ones are fab- 20 shots! And a crit hit does a visible chunk of damage to a scorchbeast queen once your adrenaline is up. I like the handmade too but my fingers get tired of all the rapid clicks and I think it's less vats friendly.
---
I've started doing some tests.  
---
So far only completed one, updated https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76  
---
Got a few more planned, but no gaming 'time 'till the weekend.
---
How much output power are generating?  Each purifier takes X of power, and each generator makes Y power.   There are different sizes of generators, and the larger ones make more power.  You can see the #s for each while in build mode.  The more purifiers, the more generators you need.
---
 [Yeah.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/343741/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-may-21-2019?language%5B%5D=en) Fuck i wont be able to play again today. I should move to 'merica.
---
Bethesda isn't even trying to fix all problems. There are simply too many of them. They are just cherry picking easy problems to fix so  they can do fixing as cheaply as possible.
---
Yeah that useless video is getting so many view lately for nothing.
---
A point in favor of bolstering, is that it'll kick in around the same health % as nerd rage and serendipity. So you're getting the bonus stats along with bonus flat reduction + the avoidance %.
---
I was walking into a raider camp just past the Freak Show when 3 Mirelurk Queens spawned.
---
My first thought was how the fuck did I not see these before I was surrounded. 
---
My second thought was there's no water here you're not supposed to be here.
---
My third thought was I hope I have enough stimpaks. 
---
Whelp after an ungodly amount of diluted stimpaks I'm hobbling down the road looking for a PA station to fix my suit. Fun times.
---
I think there is a hood in 76
---
Was going to upvote you for your personal honest perspective... until you started trying to justify your point with ‘I never swap out my perks, so you shouldn’t either’ and ‘it’s not in the spirit of Fallout to be good at everything or a super-character’. 
---
How about Fallout 3’s DLC increasing the player level cap from 20 to 30, thereby granting more power to the player character beyond the intent of the base game?  Or New Vegas’ DLCs (+5 level cap per)?  
---
Or Fallout 4’s... oh, wait, no level cap at all. And you can literally have max stats and all the perks. 
---
All the perks. All the time. 
---
The only reason we don’t have that here is because it’s multiplayer and additional balances are needed. 
---
So now you’re adding in self-imposed limitations to justify your point, instead of looking at a reasonable compromise.
---
So, you play how you want to play. But don’t insist that your personal choice on how to limit your own options is a justification to prohibit a simple quality of life improvement to let the rest of us do what we’re already doing anyway, but with a little more ease. 
---
(Bet you never sort your inventory based upon Value or Weight for convenience either... so ‘Hardcore Mode’...) 🙄
---
Armor piercing, always explosive, faster fire rate. Bloodied can make a handmade just nasty. I haven't tried a  vampire and would also be interested in hearing from someone who has.
---
Yea I'd like this my inventory is always full of spoiled meat and veggies
---
Yeah and that sucks
---
Also the magazine and you have 12 minutes.
---
Knowledge of the game is not a glitch,bug,cheat
---
No, take an upvote instead
---
They need to recajigger how the vendor works. This data should be stored in a way that won't be cleared by moving your camp.
---
I've gotten a 3 star and a 1 star on the same body once, last week
---
I upvoted 😂
---
The atomic shop stairs do have a different "hitbox" in a way, but it's more that they're even harder to clip into certain areas/with certain items than the normal stairs are.
---
Idk about all that I just know after a couple shots with another gun then a good crit shot and they go down. Happens all the time. Not exactly a one hit kill but with just a little health chipped down then one shot them before they can heal. If their health is not at full I can one shot ppl
---
My best rolls are usually ruined by junkie.
---
Ask for me too! Well, maybe not the actual bodies or anything, but  I don't want a nice, cosy, sofa-infested camp. I want poles and spikes and bits of tarp stretched over tree branches.
---
Y'know - a proper raider shithole. I've been scouring the whole map for places I can build a decent raider-like camp, but they're mostly in out of the way places or have daily visits by the local Scorch Beast :/
---
Cheers.
---
They will make it... but only on exPA and it will cost 1400 caps... so..
---
Not that many but I've had two a few times and three once after they did their recent update. 
---
I think, and I might be completely wrong, that what might be happening is that if the legendary has lasted through multiple respawns it doesn't "die" and have the loot pool rerolled, it just rolls on top of what's existing since they made hard adjustments to the RNG to ensure legendaries spawn legendary items now. 
---
Similar to what happens with the Saboteur password.
---
&gt;Where is this pagoda?
---
If we're talking just running up on someone and dropping them in one hit then no but taking a shot or 2 then switching to a crit can insta kill. most people don't stand a chance when I do it
---
Tatos are potatoes and tomatoes heres a quote from the wiki:According to some old botany texts we found, this appears to be combination of a now extinct plant called a "potato" and another extinct plant called a "tomato." The outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown. Tastes as absolutely disgusting as it looks, but will keep you from starving.

Hooded rags are in the game, but is currently bugged. The outfit replaces all armor slots. It looks awesome though, and I wear it around my camp when I don't expect to fight anytime soon.

I’m on PS4, feel free to add me! I’m pretty terrible at staying up to date on videos and I just finished the strip club but the first two Camps in this video have hidden trip wires in stairs and the second Camp has one hidden in a bed :)

Atom shop starts selling underwear.

OP starts running around in "Juicy" underwear
---
The same as everyday. There won't be any lvl 560 in there.
---
They're exactly the same as the normal metal stairs. They can he selected in CAMP and "replaced", just like the walls and floors. That being said, you might he able to squeeze more decor in with the vanilla model than switch it.
---
Leashing points for building though? Same as the stairs for sure.
---
The strip club is very new so I don’t have video yet but you can see some stuff I’m doing in the first two Camps in this video! Sorry it’s a bit long 
---
They did fix it though? Allegedly.
---
Paraphrasing, but, "Unruly Golfers can now spawn at higher levels, so anyone can complete the quest."
---
Even Two-Shot Gatling Gun without PA works fine as an all-arounder.
---
Handmade is second best, imo, because of it's automatic damage. Assault Rifle and modded LMG might be better DPS due to their fire rate, but they consume ammo really fast.
---
go to the whitesprings golfclub turn around and follow the tennis courts and turn left you will see stone gazebo with a statue of a woman on top of it go there within the outer ring on the wall is a drinking fountain this is a mineral spring drinking from it will cure any disease

Got locked and killed in an entrance kill room with flamethrowers and wasn't even mad, it was kinda cool. Fuck that junk anyway, sometimes it's glad to be rid of the stuff you don't really need but keep "just in case"
---
Yeah, i'm pretty sure i've actually got two from the SBQ before, but five is weird. 
---
You're probably right though with them rolling on top of each other though.
---
This yesss. I just found out Stable Flux weighs 1 pound... I had 250 pieces in my stash I thought it weighed .25 I was wondering what's taking up all my stash space.
---
It doesnt help that glowing enimies and ghould give off radiation and that damaging you can give you a disease if they are diseased
---
Explosive with every arc would be godly, I can see why they nerfed that
---
They're all powered up and chugging.
---
Special Gear? Maybe Hallucigen Grenades and Cryo Mines for shits and giggles, but my BOS Rifle will do me fine, I think.
---
**Rad worms intensifies**
---
You have to use a conduit or something to raise the chair/bed, otherwise the trip wire will be too tall. You can hide them under stairs, behind walls, and all sorts of stuff. If you start with a metal half wall window you can place the trip wire inside of it and then use replace to change it to a solid wall :)
---
Yesterday i got a nice 3 star armor-piece with decent effects, but unfortunately it was a level 5 :(

---
I've been killing them all night, maybe my game is just bugged then
---
Yeah it is. I wouldn't use it as the main weapon on my main character; but Doctor Frickles is my pet face melter character. I probably play three hours on my main for every hour on him just to keep him outfitted.

Likely during Freedom time zone's lunch time today.
---
You lead in your artikel with an incorrect statement. Any non legendary gamma gun with a signal repeater and deep disch could counter sentinel. 
---
Also lasers burning damage
---
Tank killers stagger enables you to kill a sentinel with a non legendary gun.
---
Every second swing by mellee will also stagger your opponent. 
---
Als i see here is complaining you dont understand the game therefore it needs to be custom fitted to your load out 
---
This entire reddit page is just dupers black market and people crying about pvp. 
---
I hope after this sentinel nerf you can stop thinking of excuses why you die in pvp. 
---
Im leaving this dupers market and cry baby forum

Nice :)

I've got 12 so far from those!

Once i got one on my First try, i legit cried

Yes. But a single defense barricade and turret should be enough to deter them tbh.

Sign me up.

Bethesda, if you're not clear on what to do, please see loadouts in Division 2. Takes about 1.5 seconds to switch.
---
This is incorrect.
---
&gt; **Bread**: Made of razorgrain flower, oil and boiled water (and maybe some bark, yes you heard right). Like come on, it's the best thing you can learn on scout, how to bake your own bread in wild. Not to mention those recipes that includes pine bark. I don't know what it's called in English but in Finland we call it Pettuleipä and we made those during war time. 
---
Bleach dogwood comes to mind, its just used for water filters and those seem to be underused.

Just same gear I use every other day tbh. Not expecting this to be difficulty if it ends up being like the Burrows lol

Yeah it drops them

gonna try this too. thanks. kinda weird that a big studio has problems like this.

Nuka cola and chems
---
Yep, they did. Finished it on all my chars since patch. It still has to be the right ones, the dressed up ones, but they're at all levels now.
---
I’d just like it if we couldn’t spawn in water. I keep getting diseases because I’m not paying attention when I first log in lol
---
Only works on Ghouls dressed as golfers.

The other day there was a lvl 40 running around trying to trade everybody during the middle of the queen fight.

Completely oblivious to what was going on around them. I just dont understand the mentality of people sometimes.

If we add salt to make it non spoil food the food should lower our thirst by a small amount.

---
I sell the qauntum X01 paint and the nuka cola T-51 paint. qauntum goes for 1000 because the quest is a pain to do and people pay that price and nuka goes for 300 because the quest is easier but people still buy them. I sold all my fasnacht plans and am currently selling all my extra masks from the event for cheap.
---
Dont forget that the Sheepsquatch explodes...this will always kill a few people who were running in to loot. \^\^
---
I hear ya, what I do after a long run, I tend to have go back to my stash and dump all of my AID items then just grab what I need, seems to help me manage weight because guns and armor weight is visible plus junk could just be stored with a press of a button.
---
I have a high strength build with 5 in perception for my rifles (1 each rifleman and 2 tank killer). My handmade does 3/4 shots per super mutants at range. Laser rifle 2 shots. Bloody mess and demo expert help with that though.
---
Fun Fact the fast travel mat from fallout 4 WAS in 76 but they took it out
---
Yes, I understand you.
---
But I feel my SPECIAL points are... bad. For fix that, I need a basic "build". I do not asked a cookie-cutter demigod build, just a fun one. I got some ropes that show me a way.
---
For now, I use mixed guns, and no perks for them. I have to collect those first and then I can arrange my points. But I plan ahead :)
---
Do the campfire tales event a couple times. So much blood bug proboscis you'll have a ton of acid in no time!

---
They've been pretty regularly adding new little spots along the map as named locations or unnamed points of interest but no other major reworked areas to the scale of Morgantown in known spots.  That was actually a cool update and one of my favorite areas anyway.
---
They could change it so perk cards get consumed when you equip them. 
---
which would solve:
---
* having repeats of cards
---
* making perks count
---
* allowing people to still swap out perks but not so much that it defeats the point of the system
---
* give you a reason to keep leveling up and get more perk cards
---
Much noted and thanks :)
---
If anyone buys too much stuff from me I get kind of nervous like I made them too cheap and some asshole is going to make a killing selling my stuff on ebay to some kid who got a hold of their parents wacky digits and is going on a shopping spree
---
Well my phone just froze up while writing a 3 page essay on what I'm planning on doing. You will now get the short version.
---
1. If the place is full of things stronger than deathclaw and yogi  bears I will switch up to my PA build with my super sledge that deals extra power attack damage.
---
2. If the place is full of mostly stuff easier than yogi bears and deathclaws and a few of these I will go unarmed with my deathclaw gauntlet with extra swing speed. And I can just switch to my power armor build above for any powerful bosses.
---
3. If there is flying stuff or things I don't/can't kill with melee for some unknown reason I will go with my .50 machine gun that's got extra limb damage.
---
4. If the place is full of radiation I will go in there with my deathclaw gauntlet and a hazmat suit for easy enemies and switch to power armor for harder stuff.
---
Just gonna keep updooting these
---
Good point
---
Well its just the slow movement rate when using Gatling Gun. It wasn't really an issue since I was wearing power armor but it really hurts if something gets up close without it :/
---
"Pillage the wasteland adorned in the Jam of your Sweetroll with the Jam Raider Excavator Power Armor Skin."

Is it bugged or is it for ppl using berserk weapons coz thats wat i thought it was for?

r/fo76 is my go to for answers usually as long as you have a decent bullshit detector. I joined reddit because Google kept sending me here for my fallout answers.
---
it can be just you and 1 more person, not a full team. also doesn't have to be the queen
---
I wish you could place down notes and stuff. Leave clues around the room to figure out the pass code to leave.
---
You dont need PA to be a conduit.
---
The majority of the times I did that event I have been the conduit for all 3 pylons. I have never even put on a piece of PA in my 170 lvls. I use a fair amount of stims if I am all 3 pylons but I still manage.
---
Amazing how many lazy leeches there are standing around doing nothing.
---
Will have to look into this too :) I have lots of different perk cards to acquire it seems and the points to move lol
---
Okay. Is it just me or do those spike traps not work properly anymore? I travel like 200 metres and then just magically teleport back to where I was which is no fun
---
I might be interested in grabbing grounded and twisted muscles off you, whenever you're available.
---
the friend request was weird but the team invite was probably so that he could fast travel to you, happened to me before and didn't bother me much. 
---
but yeah he has no right to get mad if you are too busy to accept
---
I'll be on tonight 8or9est I'll send you my psn
---
No, you can paint modded armour in Fallout 4.
---
If it wasnt planned it wont be added. They are probably finishing up internal testing.
---
SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
---
I would personally prefer loadouts but passive lock picking and hackung would be nice too
---
Well I will help narrow it down since I do have questions lol. I only really do PVE, just like adventuring and tending my shop too much :)
---
I aren't really fussed with vats either so can avoid those. I do like my TSE so I suppose that's two perks used immediately. Would any third perk be fine?
---
Im going to have to heavily build a handmade later and railway rifle for testing. I can finally put all those plans Ive learnt to test! :)
---
Furious .50 cal with 80k ammo.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Nice one, Shield Brother. May you slay many milk drinking elves.

It's nigh on impossible to craft anything of any complexity without specifically travelling around to find spices or some shit

Completely valid and agreeable option.

I’ll upvote that hahah :) I took this when I was building the main structure

Same I’ve been using for months lol bloodied explosive handmade...maybe will bust out the new bloodied plasmas

I hate spesific parts of the  game but I don't hate the whole game. I'm sure anyone who really hated the game wouldn't bother to even play it. I mean why play a game if you don't like it?
---
One of the burrows entrances gave me that message got in the other one and everything seemed fine. seems like a new bug when the dlc areas haven't loaded yet. Its really weird how this game handles the dlc because all the doors to the new areas load after a couple seconds sometimes minutes after get into the game and when fasnacht was happening it sometimes took 5 minutes for all the decorations to pop in.
---
I can craft you one tonight
---
At that point harvesting anything would just be a pointless endeavor... They need some actual high level content for anyone over 200..
---
Consoles have groups, at least on xbox you can make groups and join them, some one can throw up lfg posts and it appears on everyone in that group... 
---
if youre on pc, they have that chat mod you can use to find a group, or just use reddit.
---
Buddy, that post was 4 months ago. At that time the chest was the only piece to drop as legendary, and even then it barely counted because it was max 1* and had a set modifier.
---
oh, uh  
---
hmmm, I never even looked... i mean it isn't like we have to find an alter on  the day of the Revenant Shade or anything...  
---
but i guess being multiplayer I should have figured
---
I haven't started the camera quest yet. I have 3 Broken Prosnaps for sale in my shop so I don't accidently scrap them.
---
Just read all the patch notes released on the Bethesda website for these last weeks.
---
You still have the commie wacker? I'll pay a good couple hundred caps, or trade some legendaries I have
---
I would do only that if they made it so
---
Levers are definitely my favorite also, I have a bunch of different levers and handmades but a lever is usually what I use. Once the 2 I carry break then the handmades come out. But the handmade gives much better diversity, can go sniperish or balls to the wall full auto commando.
---
If you're on PC, [try this](http://www.fallout76mods.com/ceanos-reshade/)

Assigning realistic weight to real world firearms would be a good place to start. 
---
Savage arms .308 bolt action with a full wood stock, and 21 inch barrel weighs 5lbs. the fo76 equivalent (hunting rifle) with a short stock, and short barrel weighs 6.6 lbs. A  lever action Winchester model 1892 weighs 6 lbs. with full stock and 20 inch barrel. the in game equivalent (lever action rifle) weighs 6.6 lbs. with short stock, and short barrel. By the time you mod these to have a long barrel, and full stock they weigh around twice as much as the real thing. That's just two examples, but I am sure that this is true across the board for all of the real world fire arms in the game.
---
You can drop orbital strike beacons on someone's camp if you really want to cause damage. Don't even need to be pvp/wanted.
---
To make trapcamps harder to implement
---
This is brilliant!
---
all you need is either the chameleon mutation, chameleon armor, or a stealth boy. It does take a specific build, but that build is a godsend

I'd just like to be able to build 50% more than I can now. Not extra turrets just using the space in my camp to build what I want.
---
I am how much?
---
This is already accomplished by a third party mod adjusting the hudmenu.swf, perksmenu.swf, and plmhudmenu.swf There is absolutely zero reason Bethesda could not implement this as a first part feature. (It also has the nifty feature of not forcing you to pick a perk/move a special point every time you open the perk sheet after 50!)
---
Prior to patch 8, I believe, it was a stand alone mod and then it needed a script extension (based on FO4) to save/load again from within the game. Alternatively it used Nukesandragons to load loadouts per character. (It actually does the in game save as a Nukesanddragons URL)
---
A lot of the time, the friend requests are so you can get back on the nuked server if you crash. At least that's what I've seen them used for a lot.
---
^Pretty much. Like I hate how sometimes you get dropped into a players camp only to get stuck in their building. Sometimes I wish there be little things they could of added like human npc and other assets from fo4 but I really have enjoyed the game and perhaps have played a little too much
---
I wouldnt bet the farm
---
With luck in 30s, FLC and appropriate weapons you should be doing noncrit-crit-noncrit-crit
---
Uh, just what I usually use, bought a Sent Assassin Armour Set do that’ll probably be my Armour or I’ll use my Modded PA If it’s Radiation (Ghouls). 
---
If non PA I’ll probably use a Instigating SS RW Deathclaw Gauntlet or my other bloodied one.
---
If it flies I’ll use an AAE Handmade or my AAE 50.Cal.
---
That isn’t what was done.
---
Auto rifles are now one of the strongest positions in PvP meta.
---
Ah yes, because everyones best work happens when they are in a foul mood, looking for a new job and sleep deprived.
---
Just as god intended.
---
If people payed attention they'd realise you *already* spawn in an exactly defined position now
---
I’m always building over a resource that I’m in need of, but there have been times when I’d like the experience of relocating my camp to be random. This is a great idea and one I’ll have to try. And I usually move my at least once a week, because eventually I get bored of the location I’m at.
---
I’m in the same boat mate
---
Insults aren't ad hominems, you absolute mungbean.
---
Same happened to me, this is why i dont accept group invites from randos.
---
I was thinking about having a nukashine party at my camp. I have about a hundred bottles of vintage nukashine.
---
I use a tse handmade for general combat and a tse dragon for one shoting stuff. Both are awesome for stealth
---
As to which question?
---
What's broken? Just curious. I've been buying a lot of .308
---
Bulking ammo would fix the "sell for 1/2 cap" problem.
---
My black powder pistol has this on it. Finally that long ass reload comes in handy.
---
The haters never played it before.  It was just popular to hate.
---
Yesterday I got stuck at like 4 out of 10 camps.
---
I mean, spawning and entering your Power Armor can solve this.
---
But it is still annoying.
---
I was also stuck in a locked room.
---
But since there was a bed inside, I left some glowing mass on it *g*
---
Damn radioactive food ... :D
---
That's like having delivery in the wasteland radstag steak every login.

Level 90 and you have this mindset? I've seen level 150 and as high as 250+, I wonder what they're mindset is like or what keeps then going? I'd be happy if someone of that level would be chime in.

Loading will be faster on PC if you have the game installed on a SSD. You can use the same Bethesda account but your characters won't migrate across platforms.

loading screens..

youll have to start a new character on PC

Nocturnal wood left leg like really why all the left legs?

People under level 50 shouldn't be able to get into nuke zones IMO. I hate low levels just hiding in the scorched earth event
---
I'd like the ability to view peoples legendaries even if they aren't in their camps area. And that the weight of stimpacks was much less
---
I moved my Camp around the other day and I left my machines off for a very long time they didn't dump out though and they still work. I have also come across other players camps that didn't have power but their vending machine still let me buy stuff from them.The only time they where emptied was when I was server hopping and I came across a world where someone had the same camp location as me so when I relogged all my machines where empty and still powered the game is very inconsistent though because I logged on the other day in the same thing happened but my vending machines didn't clear.
---
Handmade for sure. It really is the only rifle I use in my build. I do use lever action rifle for fun too. Good damage, slow fire.
---
I wish the would give some love to the other rifles.
---
But can that position be changed?
---
Got a copy for my wife and I, thanks for the heads up!
---
FO76 is not like WoW or other MMOs in that there really isn't an "end game" at all.
---
FO76 is a survival/exploration game, and if you play it like so, I think your enjoyment of the game will increase by leaps and bounds.
---
I cannot begin to tell you how many "end game" characters I run into, and they are lost/clueless as to how most of this game works, and where anything actually is.
---
Pick an area like the "Forest". Discover every location, explore every building, read the notes, listen to the holotapes (listen to Colonel's story and report back). Pick up and scrap every weapon and armor piece you find. When you know the Forest like the back of your hand, move on to the Toxic Wastes, etc. There are so many missions/stories that trigger just by going inside a structure that don't show on the map until you do so. For all the technical bugs that plague this game and often infuriate me to no end, the writing and story-telling part is excellent. More than a few times I had to stop and just soak in what I heard or read. Men with beards don't cry dammit!
---
This will accomplish quite a few things:
---
1. You will develop a play style that fits you. You will quickly figure out how YOU want to play the game, and can work on a build to support that. I am more than happy to give you feedback, etc. as you go once you get a handle on it.
---
2. You will be self-sufficient. By scrapping every weapon and armor piece you find, you will learn all the mods that can be learned by doing so, and won't end up on Reddit asking other people to mod your armor with "XXX" because you will know them all. You will never be lacking in materials to build anything.
---
3. You will be a walking atlas of where anything/everything is, because you have already seen and done it.
---
Don't be the level 100 guy that doesn't know what Excavator PA is or that it increases mining yields x2.
---
Don't be the level 100 guy that doesn't know you can modify a handmade or assault rifle to be either full auto or semi-auto (and which perk set applies to which).
---
Don't be the level 100 guy that thinks every melee weapon falls under 1 handed because wearing PA causes all melee weapons to be held in just one hand.
---
FO76 doesn't have an "endgame" beyond killing the Scorch Beast Queen. If you rush the levels just to get to the point where you can kill her, you will end up going back and exploring all the stuff you missed or just quit because there is "nothing to do".
---
FO76 is all about the journey, not the destination. You can find me on PC, IGN BossHondo.
---
I personally dont have it but have seen lot of people who have the same problem
---
It was always in a good place if you weren't a tryhard metagamer and/or a cheater.
---
Yeah. Grinding has never been my thing, and yet I play more games that involve it then ones that don't.
---
So loading screens are based on read and write speed? And I might as well make a new Bethesda account then..
---
I am confused there is a condition bar already when it hit zero your item spoils. Nuked flora seems to spoil faster when you leave a nuke zone so I immediately craft stable flux when I leave a nuke zone.
---
As of right now all I have left are a bunch of Healing Factor serums.  Feel free to add me (PSN is same).  I will be online this evening and open for business
---
that'd be great. I'll send you an add now.
---
Do you source local materials and are they organic?
---
Wishing that this would be a thing. It shouldnt be difficult for the transfer of characters from one system to another if they tied em into the Bethesda accounts and had it do the equicelance of a screenshot when you swapped systems
---
Agree on the need of adding an opt in text chat, it will be the factor that will make this game have a longer life cycle.
---
Also the log is needed, to know what we sold, and at what price, so we can make better offers and adjust prices.
---
And I would also agree on a Final stash increase to 200 lbs, as 1k lbs stash would be a definitive amount no one could complain about.
---
All these 3 suggestions would make the game better, and anybody not wanting them can opt out or ignore them without any perjudice.
---
Love the game! I think it's a blast!
---
I don’t data mine or anything. However, I did get a medics explosive pipe pistol and my thought process was that it would rack up crits and be a steady stream of health. I was thinking the medics proc worked as a set percentage of health restored. That’s not the case, when I land the crit the health bar barely moves up. I was a little disappointed, but I think a higher damage weapon would heal more. I have not tested but I am hoping that the medics prefix can’t be that bad on all weapons.
---
Same issue here. Placed it on the ground directly
---
Praise Todd.
---
I always kill the robot afterwards
---
Free States vendor sells it. Used to be 450 caps before they "normalized" the pricing. Now it is around 1,500 or so.
---
Not the best gun to "level up" with btw; 5.56 ammo at lower levels (pre-68) is very hard to come by. It sounds like you are still in the early game.
---
wow had no idea about this, what did they change? dungeon you say? will have yo check!
---
Easily goes above 25k for a god-roll
---
Scorchedwendigo. Aussie so times might not match but add me just in case
---
Some guy literally came and got onto me on the reddit for trying to trade my non forest maps for 50 caps apiece, saying he would sell his for 20-25 and give away his forest maps free
---
Sounds good M8. We shall catch ya in the wilds.
---
Well, spit it out. What is it?
---
Right? I never understood the clout.
---
7 or 8k but that's on both sides. Of never sell anyrhing for more than that. I don't use mules though.
---
same problem it let me move it once now its stuck and I want to move it over like 2 feet its so frustrating
---
I have seen guns sold for 50k +
---
Just recently they changed up the inside of the building
---
It just works.
---
Isnt that the important bit? ;)
---
The most I've ever sold for is 10,500 caps. It just seems like a waste of caps to go over 5000, even 10,000 when I'm being generous.
---
Same issue on ps4
---
Most of them have had their accounts permanently banned.
---
When you don't have anything else to spend your caps on it's easy to pay 20k for something. I get nervous when I hit 20k so I turn off my vendor stations and search Reddit for something to buy. Now I'm even running out of stuff I want so who knows what I'll do now. 
---
To answer your question, I would say nothing should cost so much to where you have to switch characters to buy something. So IMO, max caps on 1 character would be my limit.
---
Whoever bought that either had too much time or that was the best dant gun to exist in the universe.
---
See im liking that about the handmade from what Im seeing. If I need to spray around like at Whitesprings I can with it, and snipe turrets down when im doing a supply run at Harpers ferry as those things are nasty :/
---
Broad assumption that all the hate comes from people who never played.  I'd venture that most of the hate *videos* are from click-baiters who played very little, but just open your eyes and read this sub and the '76 forums and you'll get plenty of legit criticism of the game.  
---
**Note:** Criticism does not equal hate.
---
Some guns are hard to find, so it depends on what drops you are looking for.  
---
3\* Best weapons go for around 20K  
---
2\* Best weapons go for about 10K  
---
1\* Best weapons go for about 2K  
---
Everything else (Troubleshooter, mutants, ghoul slayer etc.) is used by Bethesda to lower the chance of getting the BEST drops. And as these weapons are 'enemy type' specific, they are not very popular and so are classed as JUNK weapons and should be priced 250 to 1500 depending on the number of stars and what the level 2 and 3 rolls are.
---
Well this is good news but if the accounts are perma banned how are the stores still online?
---
For normal enemies the BE Handmade and BE Lever and for the big guys the BE Dragon ;)
---
Thank you for common sense in this area. For the most part it seems like people only put prices so high because they know that people in your situation are looking for something new to buy
---
Re-SUCC’d

Cant break stairs anyway
---
Savage divide treasure map gave me light robot arms plan yesterday. Wanna say it was number 4, but don't think it matters. Seen a few robot plans for sale in Player vender machines as well.
---
Supply and demand. It all depends on what it is. Rarity plays a huge role. Right now thanks to the dupers its a buyers market. My stash runneth over with insane 3* weapons and armor. In a month when everyone is thirsty for those bloodied handmades and explosive lasers, the price will go back up. 
---
Now ill shell out alot for a rare drop or something very specific. But my average is also 5k for most things.
---
Exactly.
---
They had us untrue first half, not gonna lie
---
I love the game most days, when it works properly, and I currently have a love/hate relationship with Bethesda. I would love for them to remove their heads from their asses, and go back to their roots, making amazing games, instead of meh games designed to run on shitty cash shops like Blades, and 76. Although 76 is getting better daily, so that's a massive plus.
---
Free market baby!!! Free States!!! Damn the man, Save the Empire!!!
---
There are guns you can't even buy with caps generally cause they're so much in demand.  The most I've spent is 15k for a single weapon.  5k to me is a good deal if I can only pay that for an in demand 2\* weapon with a good 2nd effect but not the top 2nd effect.
---
The market on different platforms might vary - this is on PC for me.  25k for top tier 3\* if people are willing to sell them for caps is not far fetched at all.
---
Really, Well, im from utica and ive never heard anyone use the phrase 'steamed hams'.
---
Cheers im about to start my treasure hunt now lol

(not specific to this weapon)
---
Shooting when something is very close in front of you causes the shots to come out at an angle and go wildly off target
---
Are you killing the golfer's on the course?
---
Again, another person who knows that they shouldn't go over a character's maximum cap limit
---
stalks?
---
When they do obviously see these, they usually will. Best thing to do is forward them stuff you see, because while it might be blatant and obvious for us, it doesn't appear at least that they have someone actively scouring bad YouTube streamers for tos violations and if they do, I do not envy that person for their job.
---
Fridge backpack is very handy
---
This is and was how I sold my stuff out of my shop before I moved my camp over
---
Not from noob
---
Fridge pack doesn’t let me carry more and I could just toss on good with salt specifically when needed
---
This I have thought about doing... it’ll be my “resource collection” haha. Hey man game needs raiders.
---
I have been running a shotgun build since the beginning.... got myself and instigating pump and quad double barrel
---
Handmade is just the best. There is no semblance of balance: it is objectively better than the assault rifle or combat rifle. You can go for a two shot, quad, anti-armor, and honestly even instigating on a good hardened/prime receiver build
---
Not to mention spawning underneath someones base and being trapped, and since you're not in combat you can't break their base... I think you should be able to destroy it but have it heal in a minute or so.
---
If I could make them into soup I would have been there months ago.
---
snooker?

Why wouldn't loading depend on read speed?

yeah on PC after messing with the different ini files my game runs great and loads really fast .. it's just the bugs that aggravate

Could you define “god-roll”?
---
Chill out Satan. Just stick with the orange shag carpet and cat topiary.

Backpacks, spheepsqautch, and Boy Scouts, oh my!
---
I bought 3 star handmade for 40k and it wasn't expensive i was ready to pay up to 70k
---
It gives 30 pounds of additional weight. 3 luck points is terrible price for lesser food spoilage. Also, you can use multiple backpacks and switch them whenever you want
---
The crazy stuff hou have to do to get around bethesda's dumb limitations makes no freaking sense I can't place that object there but some asshole can have a base 50 ft in the air floating with no way to get to it. Fallout 4 didn't limit me so much it's the same exact building system.
---
If you want a real fun glitch place a foundation with a wall on it now place 2 flat ceilings going off of the wall build a doorway off the floating end of the ceiling you can now scrap the ceiling and have a floating wall just replace the door wall with any other type of wall. If you want to screw yourself over put a slanted wall on top of the floating wall there is now no way to delete either of them because they are both "support" for each other.
---
Update later today should be unlocking new content under arktos pharma. Some sort of biodomes
---
Remember that 400lb stash box. That took skill to keep that managed.
---
I started buildings “Trailers” so I can lay them down easily where I was gunna be in Survival mode.
---
This exactly, I want to be able to sort by weight and see what is so heavy but it only puts things in per unit weight, so the 400 stimpacks show up as 1 pound not 400 as an example.  I fight constantly with the weight shown.  I'd like to play not grab a calculator and micro manage a ton of items to find what the real weight is, give me a total stack weight at least even if you don't allow me to sort it that way.  So much a constant struggle of carrying several weapons and armor because my stash is filled with items I don't want to lose like flux, hardened mass, bulked junk for repairs, aid items.  Rant over, ;p
---
It doesn't have to be on the golf course.
---
They have to be wearing golf clubs.
---
I did it by running along the front of the houses.
---
Which I do. But I’m also just gonna swap the perk on for the rare times I need to run some stuff around since I just use good doggy anyway and don’t have to worry about food. It just makes challenges involving cooking annoying
---
Proof
---
Yeah but unfortunately since you can’t see all three rolls on a three star (unless the player is home), I too often see weapons priced in the “premium” category you listed above only one of the stars is lockpick, breathe underwater, or falling damage. 
---
Bunch of scammers in Appalachia if seems
---
I disagree. I play a lot and cook a lot and there is a lot of powerful food wich can help you in your journey
---
You haven't learned them?
---
I do that in my friends camps. I usually use toilets on top of their roofs...
---
  This is an amazing solution, I just met a really awesome group of players last night and one of them had done this for his friends. It was an amazing thing. Apart from the main vending area, in a corner of his beautifully crafted camp.
---
I bought the stairs also, but the pre-made ones have never been available, at least to me.
---
I’m at work 🤷‍♂️ you’ll have to wait
---
Or you can collect unspoilable ingredients and cook sweet roll when you need it, like i do
---
I found mine when I scrapped a few armours
---
The atom shop  metal stairs did not include the platform version, it's not out yet :/
---
Underrated!
---
Im thinking handmade is the winner :)
---
Not sure if you know this but Radstag and Brahmin give you an additional 20 pounds of carry weight when cooked.
---
Can always get more caps. Can't always get the gun you want, duper's not withstanding.  Max people will
---
Pay will likely always be as much as they can hold. If they get capped they'll get multiple characters and when they have maxed characters they'll get multiple accounts. I imagine the practical upper limit is currently something around 250-350k just due to the pain of moving that much caps. Never heard of anyone actually transferring more than 70-80k for a single item. 
---
Most I have paid is 45k for a gun (although I may have bid and lost for more before not sure) most I have sold one for is 35k plus some trades. 
---
To me, it's just not worth the hassle of paying for anything that takes more than 3 chars to transfer just because it's a pain. But I still play the game some people just trade so to them maybe no limit. 
---
Max price is more of an economics question. If you capped everyone at 5k the market would likely move to some other currency (like real money only) for super high end stuff.
---
"Fix" has variable terms of definition, as does calling something a bug. Bethesda's "Fix" for a "bug" in this case arguably made the system worse.
---
I could "Fix" your car by putting a limiter on the system that makes it impossible to go over 70 and say "That's a fix. The original intent of a car was to go places, but not TOO fast... The first cars made couldn't hit 150 and you don't need to go faster, so I 'fixed' it for you" 
---
Doesn't mean it is something good, necessary or useful. And you certainly wouldn't likely be happy.
---
Putting a label on something as a "fixed bug" doesn't mean that it is actually dealing with a problem
---
Which platform are you? I’m on PS4.
---
Same, PS4
---
im upto like 165 :)
---
Stopped at first sentence I’m not arguing semantics goodbye
---
“The messenger” event clearly reveals there are refrigerators in game, and they are currently running... we just can’t catch them.
---
I was more just thinking of a countdown timer which gives you an indicator of exactly how long you have so you don’t have to keep checking to see if it’s spoiled.
---
I don't fight creatures that attack locked houses.  The houses have that covered themselves, what with the locks and all.
---
I have sent emails with these websites listed in the past. They're still up maybe there is some legal hurdle I don't know about? I'll post a pic of one of the sites that has been up from day 1. This should've been taken care of and I've reported them before. I won't post a link but it's literally the first search result.
---
 https://imgur.com/a/XKogimx
---
It really feels like they're doing nothing to protect thier intellectual property. Or the integrity of the game.
---
Hidden/Caution/Danger is consistent with previous FO games;
---
Hidden means the enemy has no Idea you are even there.
---
Caution , means they are aware but your stealth is still intact, and you are still getting the Sneak attack bonuses.
---
Danger means you have been fully discovered, and Sneak bonuses are no longer applied.
---
I think as long as they are wired to power you are okay. It is when they are disconnected from all power sources. I could be wrong, but that is what i experienced. Have a good one.
---
I don’t think I’m remembering wrong but I’m 90% sure I used them and then took them off because I wanted real floors in my CAMP build 😐
---
Wood armor doesn't have a hidden sneak buff, but there is only one mod for it that is a sneak buff (Shrouded). Where the wood armor shines is in the weight (it weighs almost nothing) and repair costs.
---
Sneak is determined by 3 things: agility, movement, the weight of armor.
---
Agree. Without perks I crit every 3rd to 4th shot. I am ok with that since I can invest those 3 perk points elsewhere.
---
You might be right, I just know I could never use them, which I was fine with because I only wanted the interior kind.
---
Maybe not suspended, but definitely slowed.
---
Bethsoft has looked at making refrigerators for C.A.M.P.S anyway. So I could see making a powered refrigerator (have the power draw be the downside at like 25 power draw or so. a quarter of a fusion gen) but slow the rot of stuff down to near nothing for anything in storage.
---
We have corn, carrots and silt beans so why not have succotash?
---
I've 2 weapon weight reduction pieces of armour so I carry 2 levers, a handmade a gauss and a railway around but always end up going with the lever. Can't get used to the Gauss for some reason- it gets me in trouble. Does anyone know if the stated damage is for a fully charged shot?
---
Doesn't that mod slow it by 30% less than good with salt?
---
Well deserved Gold.
---
Circus of valuessss
---
Try the "Explorer's Outfit". It's basically a long parker jacket with a hood.
---
I’m pretty sure I placed a few when I first bought the new stairs. I can at least still scroll the item over see the big ole “🚫” they slapped on it
---
tse handmade with 36k rounds, my vampire 10mm smg(insta heals) and weightless deep pocket armor for all the loot
---
I understand what you're getting at, and I'm not faulting anyone for their buying methods. This is more of a view of how people look at and price items based off of what they see in their minds as a good choice. It's funny how much the trading base of this game has taken a departure from the normal methodology of human value in how it's based less on the length of use and the deals that can be made, and more on how rare or powerful an item is that can save them time in the long run when it comes to combat or cap earning time investments.
---
The stone is not always there. It just spawns with the task. No idea, if I it will stay in your inventory. But when you take the stone, it will register for the event task, so you will def not disrupt the event.
---
I've heard it's bugged &amp; will stack with rank 2 gws.
---
I mean cooking is a preservative method, so cooked stuff should spoil at a reduced rate (doesn't seem to)
---
They could add smokers or drying racks or something. (I want my Brahmin Jerky)
---
[](/ce02)Is your .50 cal explosive? I still have issues with regenerating enemies sometimes while using explosive guns.
---
I’m the only one in my group of friends playing. We have played online games since Quake 1.  They all read the horrible reviews and won’t give the game a chance. 
---
Bethesda really screwed up releasing the game in the state they did.  They pushed it for a Thanksgiving holiday release and it was not ready.  This has killed other games in the past.  Google Vanguard.  That was a fantastic game rushed into release that was a buggy nightmare.  Eventually it was a solid game and had a small dedicated community but it never achieved the success it deserved and I am afraid Fallout 76 is headed down the same path. Bethesda has made fantastic improvements but you only have one chance to make a first impression and for a lot of gamers it’s too late.
---
Nope no mods either just a base .50 cal machine gun lvl 25
---
Lol the stash struggle bout the same carry weight 250-280 of my 350 with backpack 
---
Ya you shouldnt have any problems taming
---
So 30 free storage spaces? A nice idea, that will get abused.
---
And the clean sugar bombs don't work with the brain bombs recipe
---
Grafton vendors sell most of them now. If you don't find it, you can check Watoga or hop.
---
I’m convinced we have no raider anything as an attempt to not have people play as raiders
---
But there's nowhere else where these 3 perk points would do as much for you as they do like that. Even if you crit a lot, this still means you now crit twice as often with these three perk point card. IMO Four Leaf Clover is the ONLY mandatory vats build perk card.
---
I was happy to have something that looked a little neater but they still aren’t 100% clean.  I don’t really care about the platforms THAT much but it’s the idea that I paid for something that I don’t have now. Based on what people are commenting I’m starting to feel crazy 🤭
---
They usually are the best of the best and i have heard of even bigger numbers but havent seen them myself so dont know if its true
---
Well heck, that sounds like latency, maybe? I dunno, I hope you get it figured out tho.
---
I just drop them a message if the item is of interest.
---
I should have all 4, can be online in a few hrs.
---
This has happened to me for a few days in a row now.
---
Anyone else getting a bug which shows ghouls laying down in the default position but they slide all over the place and still attack ? It's a pain when tryna deal with them
---
I agree it needs a solution
---
Interesting anecdote, it's from a side line in Fallout 1's manual! The game is described essentially as a training simulator for vault dwellers.
---
Bloodied/explosive or anti-armor/explosive anything
---
Bloodied/anti-armor swing speed +strength super sledge or deathclaw gauntlet
---
two shot explosive shotguns or dragon
---
Instigating gauss/hunting rifle with either explosive or vats crits/ap cost
---
Not a location really, but I’ve noticed at least in the forest more stuff. Specifically under all the power line towers, sometimes there’s. A dead greaser or civil war reenactor. Yesterday was a tent with 3 scorched where there was never anything under the tower before.
---
There is a skin for the super slaug
---
How is a store 30 free storage? You can only sell 30 items per shop, but it's still topped out by CAMP storage. 
---
If you are stuck at the 800 limit, you can't get more storage from building a vendor. 
---
As an option for this they could put in specialized vendor recipes that add things like ammo compression or refrigeration, but require more power draw for the mechanisms/refrigeration or cost more to manufacture/repair.
---
There are sites for other games that sell in-game goods and benefits which break ToS and laws in most developed countries. Even if all the sites were taken down, new ones would pop out.
---
I think these actions constantly require lots of resources which is too much for relatively small companies like Blizzard and Bethesda. Still, it would be to their benefit to invest resources for raking these weeds. I doubt that they aren't already doing it.
---
They post the notes after they have started doing the update
---
Thanks, I've been doing a bit of research and it seems people months ago had the same problem and it appears that it still hasn't been fixed
---
bloody mess
---
There I have changed it 30 spoil free slots
---
I actually really like just farming for junk lol, so I've worked out a good system for myself. I give a lot of junk and clothes away to anyone I see at my camp (same name as my user name here) so if you ever happen to see me stop by :) I just logged on to make sure I'm giving you good info, so say an aluminum scrap, for example, weighs .03... when you bulk aluminum there's 10 in each bulk and the bulked weighs .13 instead of .30..... its a small difference but it really does add up to saving you the most space by bulking. There are a few things you can't bulk, but they'll work themselves out. Make sure also to check that all your Ore, (under misc) gets smelted at the Chem bench too. That ore weighs alot. More than he ppm to help if you have any other questions :)
---
:)
---
I am sure they’re working on them and I’m pretty sure people have datamined skins for the handmades and there is a skin for the super sledge already
---
In my opinion, here’s a reasonable compromise; perk loadout hotswapping cannot be done while in combat, and still requires you to access the perk screen itself. In the perk selection screen is the option for the ‘selection wheel’, which is greyed out/disabled while you’re in combat.
---
Another option; setting favorites, so that instead of having to scroll through an entire list of Perception perk cards I rarely/never use, I can have my Lockpicking perk cards &amp; Butcher’s Bounty prioritized to the left so I can swap them out faster. 
---
Being able to fast swap like you can with weapons may be a bit too much, though. But some form of Perk-related QoL improvement would be well received, I think.
---
Steal it ! Report back here for us.
---
Is that the mallet?
---
Regardless, more would be nice and probably a good idea for Bethesda.
---
That was a good idea.   But...I was asleep when you made it!
---
You need rank 3 super duper :) one of the best luck perks in the game
---
I don't know with the latest patch one of the only ways left to destroy someones camp is a nuke....
---
It's a super mutant paint. Just makes it gray and green. Barely noticeable imo, costs 300 or 500 atoms
---
Have that too, should’ve specified.
---
Some examples, to give people what's really expensive...   Bloodied, Explosive Handmade with a good 3rd effect like faster VATS crits or reload speed; Bloodied, Explosive 50 Cal with reload speed; Anti-Armor/Explosive LMG with faster VATS crits; Bloodied, Swing Speed, 1 Strength Deathclaw Gauntlet.  LMGs are popular with the PvP players, DCG is the most wanted weapon for unarmed builds, Handmade/50 Cal are staple weapons in game.  Lever Action Rifles are likely up there as well...  shotguns are more out of favor these days.  
---
Bloodied/Anti-Armor are the top prefixes, explosive is the top modifier for ranged, swing-speed for melee, faster fire rate is also commonly requested especially by players that already have their explosive variants of the same weapons.  There's other stuff that might command premium prices but they're more niche so the pool of buyers for those weapons isn't as big (less demand).
---
Check your map - if you don't see the fast travel icon it's not loaded in yet, so give it a minute (I had a similar problem at Bob's)
---
You’re doing good then! Personally I have level 3 super duper and bloody mess and serendipity and I love that serendipity can work on fall damage
---
I paid 15,000 for a legacy weapon but that’s definitely my limit, I’ve got well rounded guns all around and don’t see the need to buy an entire inventory because there goes my entire will and excitement from farming or running into a legendary creature... but a weapon that’s not possible to drop in game anymore? Hell yeah I’ll pay up for that. Now if only I could put it in a display case lol
---
Wow! paying for something that will drop just by playing the game, some people really are desperate and lazy.
---
Didnt even realise we got an update today. Yay? I guess.
---
Meanwhile at bethesda headquarters: How do tell them this week that display cases are still put off, hmmmmm
---
Yeah, the recent datamines have been disappointing. No new skins for the handmade (other than the one that was datamined a while ago and not released yet), nothing for the combat rifle/combat shotgun/gauss rifle/deathclaw gauntlet/gatling plasma/gatling laser/plasma rifle. What DO we get? Three fucking pickaxe skins
---
Passive perks would've been great if they had decided that before release. It now seems like that would be a nightmare to do right.
---
Yes.  I have now seen three on PC who said they can do casual shielded (including the guy on this thread).  But zero on PS4 and zero on Xbox.   And this is after being on both trading subReddits nearly daily since January.    No plans are sold.  And no one can make the armor.
---
The one you're thinking of is for the regular sledgehammer
---
Lol too funny, I heard there was going to be a patch today wonder what that’s going to cover
---
That's not cool. I won't switch systems ever.
---
Role play as Dr Girlfriend from Venture Bros.
---
What platform?
---
A few incidents early in the game taught me to not accept random Team invites, and even now there is an element of uncertainty when teaming up with new players you don't know. 
---
There are events where it can be very beneficial to be on a team, and Scorched earth is one of them, Rad Sponge is one of my favorite Perks, but sometimes I want the benefits of Lone Wanderer, and that's why I'm not already on a Team.
---
I do realize that many who send invites to random players in the area are just looking for a free Fast Travel, or they have not yet discovered the area, but the truth is, if you can't afford the FT, or you are a Low level who hasn't yet discovered the area, then you probably don't belong there anyway.
---
I will continue to ignore the Random Team invites, friend requests, and on my main character, the random trade requests as well.
---
 ZeniMax Media (BGW's parent company) is a $2.5 billion company. I'm pretty sure they can spare a legal intern somewhere who could send cease &amp; desist notifications.
---
Yeah, artkos pharmacy opens up today
---
I sell one in my machine, for 99 caps. Nobody's buying it, I guess people want to win one themselves:)
---
I play on the X and while i am a console pleb that knows not of P.C quality i think it runs great on it.
---
One little trick I play on here and other forms of social media is I ask the complainers who their favorite npc is.  If they tell me grahm or rose or biv I know they played. If they say things like “there aren’t  any the game sucks” then I know they’re just there for internet complain points.  A way I ween out the fakes.
---
I read somewhere that ghouls sometimes will pick up gear thats left behind. Dunno if its true, but seems plausible at Whitesprings where a lot of people will just dump the trash legendaries.
---
What would make you quit this game?  If you haven't already? They aren't your friend and they know they don't have to treat you well.
---
My friends and I plan to start a new character, run the vault then drink a nukashine. First one back to the vault wins.
---
First outfit you find, you wear. First weapon you find, you use!!!
---
Hi, i have the same problem and a simillar PC config.  
---
I hate this bug SOO MUCH. I hope one day to see a fix for that :(
---
I thought my Grim Reaper's Sprint wasn't working either, but there's no indicator of any kind in the game that it has worked - your AP just refills suddenly after a kill. I had missed it every time as I had been looking at the targets!
---
Bloody Mess isn't bad either :)
---
Pre-made was never available, trust me I've checked repeatedly
---
You makes sure you find the golf dressed ones! I was able to finish it last night no problem!
---
Well, that's not technically trivial to implement. 
---
I don't think the fast travel costs are really that much. 
---
Maybe we could eventually have something like that, but I can see it taking quite a long from purely techncal point of view.
---
Maybe a Perk Card that has this effect?  Maybe make this a 3rd Rank of Happy Camper?
---
I doubt Bethesda is too bad off. Thier annual revenue was almost 90 million in 2016. Activision Blizzard was 4.6 Billion for that same period. (I didn't find a newer report)
---
I just resubmitted a report on this site. I'm letting them know again. Hopefully they take this seriously.
---
I sever hopped like 20 times in a row at the civil war monument in the Toxic Valley, I said to hell with it and ran over to the graveyard and found her over there instead 😑
---
It's just a verdant season. The message says either "It is a verdant season in LOCATIONNAME" or "The verdant season in LOCATIONNAME has ended" I never figured out what it does in 400 hours. I think it makes plants regrow faster or something.
---
How come I never knew this? :O Thank you my good sir! I'm always sick you see? Burdens of a melee build.
---
And looks really good with the leather coat
---
At least some of those will be people misclicking you ( i do it often enough you find some nice people sometimes.)
---
And at least on a few occasions I've randomly invited people when trying to invite a known friend and it just freaks out and sends a bunch of invites to random people on the server -.-
---
It says "Verdant Season" which means Flowers and other plants respawn faster after picking it up.
---
After I acquired most of the workshops solo, you could not believe how difficult it was to have someone accept my team invite. All I wanted was to pay it forward and share ownership before logging out.
---
Dozens and dozens and dozens of alt accounts
---
I agree that coming from the stash is annoying but it's necessary. Otherwise everyone would have access to 120 weightless storage slots.
---
I have gotten 2 many times, mostly at WS, and got 3 on a few occasions, but never more than that.
---
My mindset is stop sending me trade invites while inside my house. I got 4 vending machines if something is for sale it’s in those not on me. So tired of people trying to get my equipped weapons and then shooting me when I say no.
---
Dense doesn't seem to be dropping anywhere at the moment! :(
---
It runs way better on PC. I have a 1060 and I run on High with ZERO sutters and frame drops at 1080p 60fps. Sadly a 1070 will probably not give you 4K like the XBONEX.
---
For weapons, from armor effect.
---
I got it for an event... I've never bought a recipe and I got it.. you can also get the royal jelly on top of tranaga town
---
I could see them but never place them i think you lucked out on a bug in your favor
---
It's sad. But absolute worst case scenario and while rather unlikely items like this being sold may influence Bethesda to adopt a similair system.
---
Seeing what people will pay for these items just lets us know how bad the problem is.
---
It's called Cat's Paw in Fallout
---
Ive got a Green hood and a Wrapped Cap in my stash. So there are def hoods out there.    
---
    
---
I once saw a guy with the Trappers hunter hood (hood with face mask), but I think that only come from expoiting the dev room. 
---
One good sniper attire combo you could try is this:
---
Longshoreman Outfit    
---
Yellow Slicker Hat    
---
Veil of Secrets    
---
I used to use that before I went Scout/Wood armour combo.
---
You can't steal it. It's a quest item and it will despawn from your inventory when the event ends.
---
It's really cute though.
---
There is only 1 quest per day, right?
---
I've just found two boxes in a rail carriage at the New Appalachian Central Trainyard. As you exit the main building where the power armour is heading north there's an orange open carriage to the left, they're sitting in a wooden box inside of there to the left. Not sure if they're permanent spawns but I was sure happy to find them.
---
So whats the best way to get enough acid to smelt it all?
---
Can Do and Pharma Farma are quite good. Scrounger less so because ammo is easy enough to craft. 
---
Can Do works on garbage cans. Whitespring has seemingly infinite garbage cans. A quick run through there gets you tons of food that doesn’t spoil and purified water, but more importantly it gives you a bunch of canned coffee. Canned coffee gives a ton of AP, so it’s a great item to have on your hotbar or to sell in your vendor. 
---
Pharma Farma gets you tons of disease cures, antibiotics, and stims. Everyone needs these things. Stims are super easy to farm for, but disease cures take a bit of effort, antibiotics even more so. Slap on Pharma Farma before you go anywhere with a lot of med kits and/or bathroom mirrors and you won’t have to do any farming for any of those things. Not to mention all the rare uncraftable chems you get.
---
You know I’ve seen mixed results. I’m level 25 and I bought two 3 stars and both were level 50 but my friend tried and got a level 20 - same day
---
You close out or log off? Lost power suddenly? Seems it's caused by the server not being able to save your personal data
---
Marsupial, Bird Bones, Speed Demon, Class Freak &amp; Starched Genes, Well Tuned (AP bonus from playing an instrument), Marathoner, Action Boy, Food &amp; drink that give AP bonuses, 12 points in Agility, and 2 pieces of armor that both have -50% fall damage.
---
They should be able to figure out the main accounts. They have to have connections with every major platform.
---
It’s luck~
---
I have paid 25k for items on innumerable occasions.
---
Yeah I’ve got 4!!
---
Without marsupial mutation I challenge myself to get on top or inside most locked bases without attacking or lockpicks. I've found with a little luck you can climb the player vending station and get on top of a one story base. If on PC I would love to see what you come up with.
---
Class freak is not on your list. Need it for mutations.  I normally run with starched geans, class freak, boost mess, the gun repair one, and with an extra point left I have mysterious stranger.  
---
Look like the valt teck sales man from fallout 4.
---
ok cool, let me know when you're online please.
---
I want a skin for the Gatling gun and the combat shotgun.
---
I dig both those weapons and am partially built around each one.
---
What are you on
---
Today I had a scorched swing at me while I was walking back so they wouldn't have hit me, but then they zoomed up to me mid-swing with no walk/run animation and hit me.
---
PC
---
Alcohol also suffers from weak high tier recipes..
---
Low tier vodka, whiskey, etc. is pretty good with the perk buff &amp; readily available at your base from a handful of crops.
---
The Yao Guai have a full set of enforcer perk cards.
---
They cripple and stagger on just about every hit :P
---
I did a little bit of testing and the health restored seems to be a flat 15HP, and only triggers when you use a VATS crit. As far as I can tell the crit doesn't need to connect either, just be used, and have your crit bar drained. I also have not seen any datamined info or any actual testing, so take what I say with a pinch of salt.
---
Yup. Sadly they only account ban. If Bethesda would ban the MAC address of PCs, and systems, we would have far less trouble from these twats. I doubt people would be willing to buy more than  one system to play on, unless they are whales, so a ban threat that heavy would be more than enough to scare the cheaters straight, or they would just get 100% banned. Either way, problem solved lol.

---
I have a screen shot of someone selling one for 25k caps.
---
Depends on platform. I heard they dupe instead of farm on consoles so you can get some decent guns for less than 10k. Not the case if you're on PC. You'll have to pay more than 100k if you want some really good ones. It's not about supply and demand it's about people not wanting caps. Imagine having to switch characters to trade something for 75k. Very inconvenient and frustrating especially if you got some trust issues. That's why people stick to item for item trade. People would rather accept 25k worth of items rather than 25k caps on PC
---
Okay thanks
---
I don't have a 4k monitor yet anyways so wasn't worried about 4k. Hoping to get that for my christmas gift this year haha
---
Sweet. Totally forgot about that. My mind is a sieve.
---
I tried to place a 2nd brahmin/fertilizer resource and couldn't. Other than that, no problems.
---
It came out broken (only shot a bullet that exploded with no other effects), and yeah it would have been ridiculous indeed!
---
Same here. Every time I go to move it the game says “ This item is in use”.
---
Idk for certain but I guess some players have had their ammo sell &amp; their profit gets like 70%+ tax taken out
---
When you buy ammo, you pay the amount set (say 1000 caps) but it's counting 90% per round, so instead of receiving 900 caps, you get around 200
---
Yes, I notice the game momentarily stutters when changing weapons on my PS4 Pro.
---
Just farm "Feed the People." Now the Canned Meat Stew never spoils, plus you get 5% XP bonus from eating it.
---
Is...... is that........ *^(heresy)* ?
---
They mean the tax rate. It's trying to do 10% of a cap. Doesn't really work. Bulking ammo would again help with that.
---
PC is definitely a good choice either way. Once you go 60fps there is no going back.
---
Ok. 
---
This would actually be amazing.
---
I could nerd out just like I used to in the good old days!
---
Only have carnivore in terms of mutations, so that’s why I haven’t bothered
---
Go to the trade subReddits and buy them (around 300 each).
---
PC has chat-mod though, great community there.
---
Everything in this sub gets downvoted. Pretty sure there's some No Mutants Allowed types that have a bot set up just to downvote every post here.
---
where are the trading subs?
---
I got a 3 star legendary crossbow from Grandma. 
---
\*Two shot
---
\*10% extra damage while aiming
---
\*90% reduced weight (It weighs 1.8lbs)
---
You better believe I keep it in my inventory just in case I feel a little Daryl Dixon coming on.
---
If you constantly farm glowing ghouls at whitespring for about 6 hours straight you should be able to get the levels to switch over if you only need 20 levels. I got about 3 levels an hour just screwing around doing my legendary farming track.
---
I would say start a new one only because you might not like it and want to go back to rifles. Also most of the best heavy gun builds use power armor to take advantage of the stabilized perk.
---
If you have a shotgun er build you should be able to change to heavy gunner pretty easily since you already have some points in strength.
---
The medical clinic usually has a legendary super mutant on the second floor.
---
"relativly small companies" relative to who? They're bigger than 90% of all businesses, I'm sure...
---
The transit hub spawns plans, bobble heads and magazines, check the locked room and elevator shaft.
---
The things people do when they are bored..
---
Buying more copies of the game helps Bethesda 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Pump action shotgun skins. like a new shotgun skin. Or tactical skin of sorts.
---
It's all fun and games until someone tries to fast travel to your store/camp :P
---
If you replace your camp.
---
Players can already make death traps if they want, so give me my fast travel mat to fix mine.
---
&gt;but nobody bothers to craft anything beyond mutt chops or glowing meat steaks because there's no real benefit.
---
Well that's just wrong. Maybe *you* don't, but I do as do many others, and there are a slew of benefits.
---
I'd love to see the gatorclaw reintroduced to the game and put into The Burrows, maybe as a new boss fight. Snapping turtles would be cool too. Overall, there should be more aquatic creatures in the game.
---
After a long search I found her at the war graveyard south of pricketts fort. There's a few places they can turn up though.
---
*Nelson laugh*
---
Given the prices in these shops it'd be more benificial to them to just start thier own shop lol
---
Clearly what this game needs is a radbadger. :P
---
That’s why I love my powerfist.  It has a 30% bonus damage to beasts, 50% limb damage and increased damage to power attacks.  Yao guais are teddy bears if you take out their arms.
---
Cool. I can't took last night off the game and can't get on right now, but will gladly meet up as soon as my brother's done watching Game of Thrones finale or so other time that works. Where are you in the world so we can schedule something? It's 7:40 am in the middle of America right now.
---
Players just need to learn visitors spawn where you first set down the device, so stop building over it.
---
Level is not the greatest measure. But, if you play the game long enough, why would you particularly stop at any moment. 
---
The game is very open "ended". The game has fairly low amount of super exiting stuff. Whatever you like in it, it has it. I would guess most players form their own loop. Something you can do and then keep doing it, over and over. It can be small and more simple, or bigger and more complex.
---
It's difficult because I feel like the vast majority of the community is like yourself and is helpful but such a small percentage of the community has soured my tastes for most general cooperation mechanics in the game at times. Thank you for being a kind player though.
---
Easy part of the game should be easier for no logical reason?
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
I enjoyed blizzard d3 with the RMAH... finding sweet items and making a few bucks just by playing the game. Unfortunately on the down side is people still used 3rd party websites because of the 15% tax. It’s hard to control.
---
Me too. Last night against a Yao Guai.
---
Oh my bad, whats the perk for shotgun weights?
---
Those are good builds and guns for sure, but they can’t kill with just splash damage.
---
Don't worry when group content comes around bloodied will be terrible, just like it is for doing Encryptid. You get 8 people all running bloodied and none of them can be conduit so they all just sit on a roof shooting pointlessly at an invisible assaultron.
---
Ok, I got like 6 or so.
---
Pharmafarma +2
---
Always have tons of Stims for events is why I got through Death from Above alone below level 100.
---
Also you can sell the extras for good caps....
---
Usually have over 50 stims and radaway and Rad-x in an hour of play.
---
Also get disease cure all the time. Only thing I cannot get random is addictol.
---
If it hasn't been looted, there's a guaranteed crossbow spawn at the middle cabin at Middle Mountain Cabins, just up the road from Whitespring Station. Leaning up against the wall, same cabin with the PA frame out front.
---
Always 3 Yao Guai, Radscorpions or Honey Beasts spawn there. Good farming spot for any challenges associated with those creatures.
---
Bloodied LMG’s, Explosive and VATS variants with my handmade.
---
I agree! I didnt know the real world weights but I've held rifles before and they definitely didnt seem to be 12 pounds which is how much a fully modded lever action is... lol
---
Havent been trapped yet but if i found i was i would fast travel.
---
They would probably be upset if someone even bought it! I’m sure it’s there just to show it off or be funny 😂 I leave a “my dad needs a job” sign in my vending for 10k just for giggles
---
and those crashes happen a lot on xbox!!!
---
huh, I assumed it was a glitch having to do with spawning other mobs legendary rolls all on one mob as the server catches up.
---
I did dozens of server hops and could never find the camera until a wonderful redditor helped me.  I have seen dozens in the last week.
---
Yeah we definetely need that. The monthman and "76" are okay too.
---
all of them. I run 15 luck and it is not enough.  but number one is bloody mess 15% damage increase is huge.
---
Yeah it’s for project paradise and to fix the backpack mods
---
Not always. Sometimes I spawn in different areas.
---
Same. I had 3, deleted one to do the possum challenge thing and can't place more than 1 now.
---
Yea but no one dumps trash legendaries anymore. They all get turned into scrip now.
---
Vats critical damage is gold on certain weapons. I vastly prefer it from explosive on most of my guns.
---
 +33% hit chance on weapons which purpose is to fill your bar quick is nice too.
---
+10% damage while aiming, on certain situations, provides highest possible damage output from the 2nd star.
---
This game is more complicated than it seems, and it seems ridiculously complicated.
---
no its been like this for a while now I've had it since day one - basically its caused by laag and the fact melee weapons take a sec to swing and the enemy isn't where you think they are - its gotten worse since camp stores have opened since there is a large amount of data right at start up of a server so you need to wait a bit some people have 90 secs of laag I've seen though up to 3-5mins before game settles down - if you run around though the time goes up rapidly as the new data loading and the server data seem to slow each other down and you get invisible enemies and enemies you can't hit at all or that heal after you shoot them
---
Not if you're over encumbered and has reach your daily scrip limit in any case
---
Antique shop to the west can have a few rare BOS clothing drops.
---
I too would like the pet rock.
---
I would put it next to Prince Jim, Princes Jimina and Prince JFC.
---
BECAUSE I CAN'T GET THE FROG CHALLENGE DONE SO I HAVE THREE HABITATS!
---
Yes.
---
We had one that was made out of concrete foundation and had a powered door, he closed the door and turned on fire turrets (which still hurt in pacifist mode). It's all good a little while later and a nuke was launched to deal with it! No regrets!
---
I think you also can't discount the collectibility. I have spoken with numerous high end traders who really don't even play the game anymore except I to trade and collect items.
---
I think that pvp and collectors drive the ultimate market price for stuff. I am only pve really so you can really get away without any of the super high end stuff anyway. But if you want it you have to fight the entire market. =P
---
Will be interesting to see how the purveyor impacts the market long term. Duper's I think cause the biggest shifts but hard to fault people *too* much for doing that some (at least for me) when the queen drops 1 and 2* wood armor 9 times out do 10.
---
Its actually made for people in power armor.
---
\&gt;  I can 1 shot high level super mutants with a regular pistol. 
---
Unless you're using Nerd rage/other low hp stuff. You're completely full of shit. Even on my full VATS crit build, it takes 2-3 shots with my strongest revolver. That's with using a VATS crit.
---
I still have a piece of Dry Kindling in my inventory....
---
Yes. Mostly at White Springs and sometimes it was a few ghouls dropping 2 legendary during a full sweep.
---
Why omit the name of the game?
---
yea... I got a lv 40 piece of armor the other day @ lv 46... PSA SHE DOES **NOT** ALWAYS GIVE MAX LEVEL
---
Try the LMG. It used to suck but it has been buffed significantly.  There aren’t any mods available for it so don’t be an idiot like me and buy the plan thinking you can make them and scrap them to learn mods.
---
It's fine where it's at now. If you're hitting the limit like this there is more to do in the game then just farm legendaries all the time. Go do something else for a change.
---
That's been an on going battle since the days of Chineese gold farmers in WoW. The reason they're not shut down is simply because the sites are hosted in countries that don't care about intellectual property rights. Some of these companies have hundreds of people farming, duping, hacking, and stealing items and currencies. 
---
The newer sites allow other people to sell as well, the companies take a small percent of that profit as well as sell their own stuff; basically outsourcing the advertising, which is a bit ironic considering the places these businesses reside.
---
I'm east coast, almost 9AM. Unfortunately, it's my bedtime.
---
Once upon a time someone tapped me up during SBQ to trade... it was odd given the hulking beast thrashing at everyone but I said ok... they needed stimpaks... I sold them half dozen... we slayed the queen and lived happily ever after, the end.
---
I eat the flesh of my enemies
---
I would like mutated fish so we could have fishing + new cooking recipes! 
---
Wild boars would be a neat and terrifying addition since they already live in Appalachia! Can you imagine a giant boar with a ton of tusks just ready to rip your guts out D:
---
How i feel stupid now with personal sell price limit of 3k... 
---
Good topic though.
---
I actually have it for all three -- PC runs really well and no futzing with the graphics on the monitor. I use an Xbox controller instead of keyboard though.
---
Yeah sure. MAC is trivial to change.
---
&gt;I doubt people would be willing to buy more than one system to play o
---
If we are talking about PCs then one system can have 50 systems inside it.
---
If they did a perk card loadout system (or if you're on PC you can use the mod for that) you could just hotkey a no perks loadout. That's what I have set up for this purpose (also for comparing gun stats before modifiers).
---
The "better sorting" mod on PC shows stack weight in brackets and is really helpful, but I don't think there's a mod that displays native weight of items.
---
This stuff would be nice for Bethesda to implement like they did with the known plans thing though.
---
I just did few events. On weekends i can play for 16hours, which is extreme, but why should i be limited this way?
---
Man I want raiders back. Sick of the NO people in the world thing. I hope next mega update will bring it 20 years in future and the map will change and introduce raiders and other factions.
---
I'll be up around 4ish my time, 3-ish yours. Otherwise, I'm usually on around 3-4ish in the morning your time.
---
Kinda. So basing this purely on previous FO games and my experience in modding through CK and what has been seen so far in the modding groups looking at 76, but since this game does a fee things entirely different, it might be something else entirely.... 
---
So, the presumption is that game spawns would sometimes "bug" when trying to load new spawn in an area if the area "leader" was still living during respawning. This seems to especially be the case if the leader spawns legendary. This can result in multiple "leaders" in a particular area. ( Ever go to a spawn point and see multiple enemies with a crown on their name?)
---
So it seems if this leader spawns legendary, and the next leader attempts to spawn legendary, something else in the game scripting that likely is to prevent TOO many legendaries per area is likely interacting with the leaders spawn, causing it to spawn additional legendary rolls on top of existing legendary leader rather than having to legendary leaders in the same location.
---
Can you explain further on how extending a credit line to someone is going to be a great cap sink? Especially of this person is spending more than they can afford?
---
I'm with you about the boar... but I do not want fishing.. then we will get 30 days of 'daily challenges' that would just be another chore to add to the list of annoying things
---
That's alright. East coast is easier to work with time-wise than someone on nights in Bristol. We can meet up tomorrow or another day. I don't mind holding.
---
LG Ultrawide 2560x1080 -- pretty nice.
---
You are correct.  VATs builds can make good use of all three stars.
---
We could fish up enemies too. Like a percentage chance to either catch nothing, catch a fish for cooking or catch an enemy that needs to be defeated.
---
Honestly, IMO all of the Wikis have been trash for this game. Every search i do for something usually leads me to Reddit for a thread that has the answer, and a lot of the game sites have walk-thrus for quest stuff.
---
I've never had either issue. 3 characters over 50, 250+ hours in. Only issue with weight was on release with 400lb stash. If you're hitting your scrip limit why continue to farm legendaries? Also, if you're hitting your scrip limit, there is more to do in this game then just
---
Yeah you’re right it would be WOW all over again. I caught hundreds of fish... maybe thousands //sobs
---
But would be a break from camera dailies!!
---
Would be nice to add military rations to the mix also. That shit lasts forever
---
And Blizzard is a hot dog stand with 3 employees :)
---
It really depends how far you're shifting your special. 
---
Heavy guns are a bit funny in that they're great for big bosses, but I'm not a  fan of using the big guns for routine leveling. Try and shoot a cockroach with a gatling gun. Ugh. Stabilized forces you to use power armor for armor penetration, which is limiting. On the other hand, if you use a bear arms all the time, you can carry around an incredibly diverse arsenal.
---
CRANBERRY JUICE FTW. It’s easy to make and find. And provides the only true buff I care about +xp
---
Like the anglers!! It could be a fishing event (the one that got away) and if enough people join then you could fish up a legendary angler!! That would be fun 
---
Or you could fish up junk too sometimes xD but sometimes something good
---
One camp wasn't necessarily a kill camp, it just had a cage around the Fast Travel loading point.
---
So I just fast traveled out to a nearby point and just walked over. Making angry emotes at the owner for the locked cage.
---
There was as much duping on PC.   And more dev room hijinx.   But markets do vary considerably across platforms.
---
Bad idea but hopefuly will never happen
---
I would like new meats and recipes.. even if you fish meat some other way..
---
Today is the first day I've tried days. We can try a quick trade when you get up if you like because I'm not sure if days are going to stick for me or I'm headed back to your schedule.
---
Other bigger media companies that litigate their IP offenders effectively, like Sony, Warner Brothers, Google, Microsoft, various recording companies. In MMORPGs, Blizzard is relatively big, though.
---
once every 24 hours  
---
and so do Yao Gui  
---
but at least the last time I went I saw my first legendary Yogi and a 3\* to boot (1\* wood chest piece, but at least i got credit for "kill tough enemies")
---
Can't we do that already?
---
The cap sink would be from the lending fee so if Bethesda set a 3% convenience fee and you buy a 2000 cap item 60 caps would be paid to Bethesda before you could get any credit extended to you.
---
In the atomic shop you have to make sure that the emote is equipped. For me it kept saying it was equipped but when I’d go to the game and try to use the emote it would not be in the expanded menu.
---
No I think he was joking to answer for such a trivial question.
---
My team had a drink of the shine at White Springs and had to get back to it without looking at the map.
---
There were quite a few "where the hell am i now" and " i know where i am .... no wait ... where is this".
---
It was a fun race.
---
I would think player vending has changed a lot.  There are many players who would never go outside "in-game" trading, and many more that would prefer it.   I am surprised to read that the market still exists for 25k+ prices.   I would have thought that the market, after losing a large portion of customers to in game vendors, would be in flames right now.  How did that not happen?
---
That’s the latest griefing method.  They pull mobs back to your camp and let them destroy your stuff. I have a low level mule I just sell on. I park him there at the camp so people can inspect the legendaries.  Three times bored idiots have pulled level 68 scorched into the camp to try and destroy it.
---
Relax. People have fun in different ways :-)
---
YES! Mine is doing that too, it says "This item is in use"  but no one is around using it!  Its been like this for at least 2 weeks i think, id like to be able to move it or scrap it or store it please
---
on ps4
---
Oh noooooo whyyyy?? I already FT and end up stuck in people’s foundations or accidentally in locked parts of their camps, now I need to worry about this crazy shit too?!?! 
---
I mean it’s totally evil genius  and I never would have thought of it but still, ahhhhh!
---
Smelly meat, old meat, slimy meat, meaty meat, squishy meat, dried meat, roasted meat, crispy meat...
---
Haha, work smarter not harder
---
This is why you should not accept team request from people you didnt know, those griefers always trying to find a way to destroy the things.
---
You can- inspect - rename
---
They fixed the lighting in the watoga station, so nic enot having to use my headlamp inside there any more.
---
Yea I second this. 
---
Hitting a scorbeast queen? Not a problem even if your two miles away
---
Hitting a tick that's two miles away and under? Borderline impossible :/
---
It's kinda telling that griefers target lower level players that can't really fight back... They must be so bad at pvp and pve that they have to remove the challenge. I keep orbital strikes for this reason and look for their base when they get bored and leave me alone. Love how those orbital strikes don't get me wanted :)
---
Does anyone else use light footed when traveling to trap camps ?
---
Really? So no movement perks stack with speed demon?
---
lead lined sure, but you can't learn Dense by scraping torsos of any armor...
---
Man that's pretty messed up. Just sucks it seems there isn't much that can be done. The site I posted pics of had reviews no idea if they're real or not with items being delivered in under 10min.
---
There’s only one draw back to the handmades for me, they love bullets 😅 what do you play on? If you want I have some of each you can try out for a run, see what you prefer and go from there on how to spec your build
---
I'm not running any mod that mentions that it fixes that. 
---
Maybe this is one of those things where it's not happening for everyone. Like the post the other day about zero percent hit chance on flying insects... yeah I don't have that bug either. I have had the vats "keeps missing" bug but nothing related to flying insects.
---
The amount of people who have been grinding this game for caps through duping, trading, cap stashes, legendary grinding, etc have or are still collectively still around
---
Ooh I have one of them but I haven't even used it yet. I never even thought of using it on them but I'll have to remember that for next time
---
If you need Dense for Combat Armor and your'e on PC I can do it for you (500 caps, my mats).
---
We already have the Good with Salt perk, seems like that's very similar to what you're asking for.
---
Seriously, I have so much meat that I just end up cooking and selling. The only "advanced" recipe that's worth collecting the ingredients for is the Cranberry Relish for that sweet +10% XP bonus.
---
I have a furious + 10% aim handmade, and it's good, but I'll caution that you're really only getting the benefit after you've poured a whole lot of bullets into a given enemy. It's better than trash legendary effects (e.g. nocturnal), but I'd suggest keeping your expectations low, lest you be disappointed. It's also a very ammo intensive approach.   
---
Bloodied is the absolute king of damage if you're willing to pay the cost of having low health. I have one character who lives at full health and one who lives at 20%, and there are advantages to each.
---
I have Bloody Mess, Good With Salt, Starched Genes and something else I can't remember.
---
Other than that, I swap out Bloody Mess for Super Duper when I craft stuff.
---
All are maxed out.
---
I thought someone said you could. I imagined it was something in the armor workbench, but couldn't find it. Does this mean you can do it from the pip-boy?
---
Yeah if they put those minds to work on something productive the things they'd be able to accomplish
---
What?
---
Given that caps have little to no value at all in the game.
---
Maybe it’s just me, but the idea of managing debt and paying bills in a Video game sounds decidedly not fun.
---
Also now with this PC lag issue being tied to friends list it seems, I dont want any friends invites making my friends list any bigger than it already is! I dont accept invites from those I dont know anyway due to all of the stupid games going on....
---
This
---
There's a spawn on the road as well.
---
Inspect item &gt; Rename.
---
Play on Xbox one. Name of Kaisers Curse. Im usually at my shop for a bit when I first log in lol.
---
Im not sure what cards I will need for this, but Im sure I can have a look around and start farming to re-spec and get some rifle cards so any help is appreciated :)
---
Plus I always have extra bullets and never have an issue making more lol
---
I don't think it's hysterical to kill random innocent player that ultimaliy did nothing wrong
---
So is it exclusively got tier stuff in the marketplace now? Or full armor sets or something not well provided for in vendors, like ammo?  
---
Or is it more like a bunch of junkies selling crack to each other?
---
I actually am not sure about the gauss, I have a tse I play with sometimes and honestly can’t tell to much of a difference. I will have to try it out on a SB or something, but I’m going to guess it’s max damage at full charge. But I very much agree with you on always ending up using my trusty sidekick my lever/any lever.
---
Yeah all my fallout friend with the exception of one have been through random invites and I have made the few great Appalachian companions that way but unfortunately due to griefers that's gonna be one experience I'll be missing out on in the future which sucks
---
I put one in my vendor the other day for 1250c to avoid scrapping it.  Someone bought it last night
---
Oh it's not just a melee build. I've picked to diseases simply by being in a certain radius of something with diseases before it even attacks. It's garbage.
---
You can do it from the pipboy yes! And I believe you can do it in the workbenches as well but I think you need to go in where you repair it? I’m not 100% sure as I just name from pip boy!
---
Why are you licking scripts?
---
You need it for one of the possum badges.  Oddly deathclaw don’t drop them
---
Hey if you like it and it’s helpful then that’s awesome! I was just saying I’ve never seen it used haha. Well now that I know, I will start putting the wood armor I get into my vending machines! 
---
I learned a lot yesterday! I also asked if there was anyone that actually uses the railroad rifles because I always seem to be getting those too and I’ve never seen anyone use them! But someone told me that they have seen them used when people need a change. 
---
I like learning new things in this game! And I like knowing how to help people out!
---
I'm actually doing this as a back up because I find it is easier to find really awesome Heavy weapons than shotguns.  I have a Troubleshooter's explosive gatling I keep around for encrypted. 
---
If I need to I'm just going to swap my shotgun perks for heavies, since I already have the points in strength.  Unless you really want to min/max for heavy it shouldn't require too much respeccing.  I'm only going to break it out for the big fights anyways.
---
Anthem really put this game into perspective I'll tell ya what 
---
The support and Bethesda's behavior have still been abysmal tho. I guess thats the kind of thing that gets you bad PR more than just making an average game
---
It could be called it the Wimpy lending system.
---
 "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a TSE today"
---
Wimpy https://imgur.com/a/dap2wrM
---
So if the people who loan dont pay, then what? There are tons of people on here that have never been in a real world loan scenario. Also loans are based on income/collateral/down payment. These would all have to play a part otherwise youll have a bunch of people stealing and not paying back. No one cares about negative karma when you have 5 characters. I feel this is destined for problems. 
---
In all actuality the right way is to introduce a banking system to the game ran by vendor bots. Service fees applied to savings accounts and atms for caps all over the wasteland. People would apply for collateral loans with the vendor bots. If they dont pay, they lose their item they put up. On top of the fees and interest compounded by the loan its self. Also they could offer a safe deposit box option for extra storage. This would stop the interest in multiple mules for caps.
---
yea... Some people "have fun" by griefing other players. Some people would have more fun in God Mode. Does that mean it's a good change to the game as a whole? No.
---
They may have had sentinel’s that might have protected them I’m not sure. I’m not so quick to assume people are cheating just because the way the game works half the time - people were invincible doing basic in game things so
---
Sounds interesting, I might try that on the small bear cave I found at the white springs! I tried to make a bullfighting pit with that ghoul hole by the golf course, didn't work how I imagined so I scraped the project, but it might be worth checking out on other creatures
---
Cazadors....
---
Scale wise it is actually on the small side.  If a character lays on it with the photo mode pose, from elbow to foot they basically fill the play area.  Small coin op bar tables are 7 feet from end rail to end rail, and 9 feet on a full size. The one in fallout looks like it would be an 8 or 9 foot table, so it should be bigger if it was to scale.
---
This stuff keeps the game alive. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
I find the problem with vampire is, when I'm using a handmade, I don't want to be tanking damage. Against most enemies, if I can maintain separation, I don't need the damage mitigation and it's a wasted affix. All it saves you is a few stimpacks, which I find are pretty abundant. Vampire is more valuable on closer range weapons like shotguns or melee.
---
It could be a bunch of things the games really buggy when I’m in assassins sentinel armor and people hit me sometimes it says I’m on one and then it like rubber bands back to what my actual health is. And it’s possible he could’ve been using assassins sentinel armor, serendipity, and dodgy and been chugging quantum’s for infinite AP, I used to do that and was mostly invincible but it was kinda a random number generator for serendipity so it just depended
---
Assassin's Sentinel gear was nerfed, but if they got lucky then, yeah, next to no damage gets done.
---
Max I've ever paid is 5000 caps for a mutants explosive two shot 50. Cal MG. Best damn deal ever. Lol
---
I generally charge a Max of 1500 for my 3 star weapons, seeing as I don't have any super rare ones that I'm willing to sell just yet.
---
I do like that
---
Yeah i got to test it out yesterday ...its pretty awesome ... i was having fun running through packs of ghouls ... i appreciate the tip, i think in going to make the switch too
---
Given that Bethesda already has, in other games, the infrastructure and code to support in game **text chat**, I am not sure if you are aware of what is required to implement that (including monitoring and logging). Adding a chat will generate tons of problems that will result in increased workload for customer care. It can even create legal issues that the company has to investigate.
---
Lol.  Thanks for replying to that post.  I had forgotten to edit it after I found out my information was faulty.  I have since edited it.
---
I will gladly take yours I would hate to have you be weighed down by them.
---
Big tea pot, found one for myself and a friend two server hops each time . now that I have one tho i see those bodies everywhere.
---
Alright I play on XB1 as well. Rifleman for the lever and handmade can use either rifle or commando (depending if you want it automatic) but the handmade is definitely better as a full auto gun. What level are you? I think all my handmades might be max level but I have levers of all levels if you need
---
I think you're missing the point of the 150 limit.  It's not so that you have to save up legendaries for later return, it's so that there is a limit on how many you can get over time.
---
You're asking for them to let you have more than 3x more legendaries from scrip, which I have a feeling isn't what they intended.
---
While I'd personally love removing or raising the limit, the effect would be pretty significant, and I have a feeling you're asking a bit more than they'd be willing to change.
---
I want either a hot rod flames or shark face plane paint on my Browning .50 cal.
---
Then I want a black and gold trimmed MG42, Like the other nuka-shine paints.
---
Are extra pickles a microtransaction?
---
If you haven't already, try the perk card "Blocker" in Strength.
---
The survivalist, it was in the atomic shop
---
Lots of fun
---
Np
---
Yes. The new weapon weight gear coupled with bear arms, lets you carry about 10 different heavy weapons for only 10 lbs.  Now a walking Heavy weapon death machine.  Was the last piece for my puzzle.  However I dont think ill be running in my power armor much.
---
Unless it's the Sims, then you expect it.
---
Other thing is that Bethesda don't sell the items for real money that the sites do. If legendary items were sold in Atom Shop, that could be incentive to heavily legistate those sites and corresponding perpetrators.
---
Friggin sexist. It's pioneer scouts. Duuuuuh.
---
Backpack sold separately lol
---
The wood armor is a known bug and they are working on a fix, most likely today's patch.
---
If you are that upset about a video game, delete the game.
---
Mole Miners I can kite in circles without getting hit using a shotgun.
---
Ghouls have Michael Jordan Space Jam level reach. I use to play melee exclusively, I don't mind the reach of the enemies as much as direct hits not registering. 
---
Certain enemy types seem to be worse, I find ghouls the worst.
---
lol.  That was a nod to Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.
---
Assassins Sentinal + Dodgy + Serendipity may explain your results. Which is why Assassins Sentinal is so expensive.
---
 serendipity, bloody mess, class freak, starched genes, grim reaper Sprint.
---
If you are not playing an unyielding build either FLC or critical savy but not both. If your luck is in the high 20s / low 30s you don't need either to have a good crit rate.
---
I haven't had too many griefers, closest I've had recently was one guy robbing my acid extractor with his two friends waiting stealthed nearby to jump me when I came to check the wanted person neat my camp. I run pacifist constantly because I use heavy guns and people constantly walk in front of my line of fire. So I shot the wanted guy with my explosive Gatling Laser to bait them causing his friends to run up and hit me, doing nothing because I hadn't actually attacked any of them. I waved goodbye with the emote and just hopped servers.
---
A decent 2 stars TSE is often sold here for some 12K caps.
---
Now, how long does it take to farm/craft clothes that sell for a lot of caps at the bot vendor? Given you can do that on 5 characters for 1400 caps each every day.
---
Considering the chances and time it takes to get that weapon, is 12K a good price?
---
Honestly, caps are useless.
---
.50 cal and Gatling are already good. The rest suffers from more or less issues. Example: try to feed the LMG with ammo...
---
Fruit jellies or jams would be a fantastic recipe addition.
---
VATS for the lil buggers, and iirc One Gun Army provides stagger and cripple under the Luck category. And yes Bear Arms is the bomb! Right now I'm carrying : AA Gatling, Bloodied Gatling, Furious .50 cal, Furious Prime Gatling, Instigating Gatling, Assassin's Explosive Gatling, and Vampires Gatling. . . (phew). Primarily this is to save stash space, but I do use 2-3 of them on the regular. I'm honestly probably carrying a few more than that, but there not weapons I generally use so I'm not remembering them at the moment. . . Oh, AA Pipe Rifle for caps runs/trash low lvl enemies I don't want to waste my 5mm on.
---
Its forsure not a dupe, noone would waste time duping that
---
&gt; you are on my "Shit List" now.
---
I'm sure they are terrified.
---
Also irradiated vultures
---
It's just all about what is the best weapon and build to be one of the cool kids.
---
And no patience to get them as quick and effortless as possible.
---
Instead of having a good time and enjoying the game. Maybe we just have to wait till the next big thing come out where they can move on doing the same thing somewhere else.
---
That could possibly be an outcome of this however just imagine the blowback on here. I'd rather have no Legendaries or caps for sale.
---
Same.  Haven't been stuck in a wall yet because the minute stuff starts to rez, I'm running a safe distance away
---
Yes! Forgot about that place.
---
Because RL pool tables are huge. This one is actually a little smaller scale than a real one.
---
I dont think it was duped. Someone probably gave it to him
---
No one has ever intentionally duped that gun.
---
There is no best armor, there is only armor thats most suitable to given playstyle, team and position. This often means sentinel assassin, the defender, is the best one to, you know, defend an elevated position.
---
But if you plan to do something besides defending an elevated position, sentinel aint the best armor by no means.
---
Also, thats an oversimplificiation but they way f76 works it's better to have 10x 20% bonus than 1x200%, hence, more often than not, mixed sets are the best/most versatile.
---
Literally every God tier weapon or armor I've bought off here is def duped and I've never been banned. You get banned for duping, not buying dupes. In this case it seems like you've encountered a newbie who didnt know the value of what they had and you probs should've bought it. Even if its crap, 300c for 40 scrip isn't too bad either.
---
Nailed it!
---
I can't speak for how good the weapon is, but you won't get any trouble for buying duped items.
---
It's also still there for workshops
---
Select - Uninstall
---
Yes, PC Master Race. Don't forget it.
---
Handmade train here too. 
---
I recently switch from semi auto to automatic and the dps is much better, but at the cost of more ammo to craft, but not by much if you land your bullets (92 dmg instead of 103).
---
Lever action lacks anti-armor receiver. I'd like to try an AA Lever action though.
---
That relish stuff right? Yeah that’s great
---
thanks for the tip, I managed to get all the serums I needed!
---
Just to update you, I found someone who had all the serums I needed on sale. Thanks for posting here, though!
---
Since they excluded the bots at Watoga from being Legendaries, not a whole lot.
---
The only missions there are Mayor for a Day, an Enclave event, and the PVP at the high school.
---
It is, however, a good way to farm for Power Armor pieces since 4 sets spawn there (*roof of school, crashed vertibird, roof of civic center, trans center behind a locked door*) and to get tons of steel and lead from killing all the bots.
---
Hey bud, I got my serums, but thank you for offering!
---
You definitely can. I'm always renaming new items as "sell" or "scrap" and my main armour is named "A left leg" etc so I never accidentally sell or scrap the wrong stuff
---
I believe this a random encounter.  It may not be there when you get back.
---
Hey there. I managed to get the serums I needed, thanks for replying to my post though :)
---
You can from workbench as well! I like to put an exclamation point in front of my “oh shit scorchy” weapons/PA so that they are always at the top, in case of emergency. 👍🏻
---
Eh, DR is kind of overrated. I'd much rather have outright damage reduction and/or stealth to avoid being hit in the first place. I'm definitely gonna go for the refrigerated mod once I get my carry weight under control.
---
This is a big game of hide and seek. Map control, visibility, seeing and not being seen is the most important variable.
---
Recon scopes are great. On big distance mark all your enemies then sneakily come closer being cautious to be obstructed as you close in.
---
Always crouch. If you don't crouch you are red dot on my compass. It stresses me out and makes you dead. Don't stress people out, put them to sleep calmly :)
---
At least one person in your team must give up on having camp and place it at good defensive positions during the fight. You can dominate any encounter by spawning above previous battlefield.
---
\&gt; For me it’s auto-stim armor 
---
This is mine, my wife thinks it amazing, but I've had so many drops of it that I've evolved her through 3 sets of Auto-stim and still scriped 2/3 pieces.
---
They can't really do anything. The youtubers are just referring you to the site and they get a sample percentage of the sales. It is not the youtubers site. Additonally the sites are hosted oversees and use many many many accounts to move items around. Bethesda could identify them and ban them but the sites would just buy new accounts.
---
&gt; Your ignorance is that of legend
---
LMAO
---
It's more of an Albany expression
---
One base me and this dude were just locked behind a metal gate while he played creepy music over his mic and stared at us while my cellmate freaked out trying to break and shoot everything.
---
 This post is awesome! Great ideas, I hope this gets some updoots and lots of people's notice cause this is the kind of insightful suggestion Bethesda need to read.
---
 My own additional suggestion to this would be to make the Cookout an event that players could trigger at their own camp, similar perhaps to a Workshop Defense Event. Prepare the table, send out a server wide invite and shortly there after your camp is attacked by a Supermutant Horde.
---
No. Some old manager at Bethesda believes emotes and hairstyle are way more important in the wasteland.
---
No good. Try and post for a medics double vats. Or ME With fast fill. Either with faster fill so you get those crits quicker
---
Shouldn't need to on a game of this level and age, bugs and glitches that screw over the players this bad should not be happening any more, Beta is over.
---
Or just skins that you can apply on any weapon in the game and not only for Bowie or Lever action rifle
---
People are dicks! I’d be a liar if I said I never 1 shotted any legendaries but I can honestly say it was never intended!
---
I know it’s frustrating but honestly if you keep up here at all you would know the wood armor and assaultron heads are reverting to one stars - and Bethesda said they’re working on a fix. I think the majority of people here have also lost items which doesn’t seem to be acknowledged- frustrating yes- gonna throw a tantrum - no.
---
Do you play high charisma medic? What kind of build do you use? And what type of weapon do you recommend if not tesla?
---
My usual carry around. AAE minigun, AAE lmg, ts auto grenade, action hero and vampire.50 mg. plus thousands and thousands of rounds of ammunition lol.
---
This would be awesome... I always hated the idea of starting over - making a new character but it would make total sense if there was a benefit to doing so. In fact I think it'd make sense to add other things with the prestige like increased stash storage, increased CAMP budget, increased special points, etc
---
Anything worth visiting that is nearby....Fort Defiance being the maximum travel distance West, Ranger office furthest North. East and South no limit
---
It went away for most stuff at one time, but high dps stuff has always triggered it for me. This last week in particular has been very bad.   Ive also noticed sneak damage getting healed, delayed damage in servers im new in, occasional half damage, and major melee vats issues recently.  But the new content keeps coming, so I server hop and go till it happens again.
---
Why would i quit the game for something we all knew was going to be a part of it long befire release?  
---
If they stick to the "all dlc is free" part of the atom shop deal im fine with it, if they keep the atom shop then suddenly say the next dlc is paid ill kick off, i wont quit but i wont be happy about it.  
---
What would make me quit would be when i no longer enjoy playing the game or i enjoy payong a different game a lot more and move on
---
Imagine a Lurker Below type world boss that gets randomly fished up on a server and takes everyone to kill it.
---
Probably because it was Super Columbine Massacre RPG, *OR* some VR sex simulator game.
---
10-4. Thanks for keeping me up to date. Feel free to drop me an add anyways and stop by my humble abode if you ever need something. We got goods for everyone!!!
---
The endgame hoarders are as bad for the economy as dupers are. Change my mind.
---
Yes that would be so much fun!! I’ve been wantin like real world bosses for a while that would take almost everyone to take down aside from the Queen you know? We need more!
---
If you want PvP you should be in Survival (Or a different game all together) not in Adventure mode.
---
Except for the fact that bug is from a new feature that just released thursday
---
Also, to answer your question about which foods are best for general use and end game... not much honestly. Most recipes are effectively pointless.
---
The best food for general use is any food that doesn’t spoil, cheaper/easier to get the better. Or whatever meat you pick up by killing things. It’s just not really worth it to go out of your way to craft/buy general use food when the buffs aren’t that good and don’t last very long. The notable exception here is Cranberry Relish (and a few other crandberry recipes). It makes you get more XP for an hour. This is useful for everyone.
---
As for end game, there’s a little more variation. The Good Doggy perk means some people just eat dog food. The carnivore mutation means some people just eat what they kill. Herbivore means some people just eat what they grow in their camp. Problem is, all that stuff is easy to get on their own. Dog food sells well, but that doesn’t make you much of a chef...
---
Nuka Cola and alcohol also have perks, and you can craft Nuka Cola Dark as well as other alcohols, and they will sell well/be useful. A lot of the new alcohols added in the brewing update are pretty good, and actually aren’t even affected by the alcohol perks, meaning they’re universally useful. Ballistic Bock raises gun damage by 15%, for example. 
---
But as far as end game food, there’s not much you’d be able to craft that other people will find particularly desirable. I’d look into food that doesn’t spoil, like Brain Bombs. But even then, don’t expect these things to sell very well.
---
1) Find two pieces of 50% Fall Damage Reduction Armor
---
2) ???
---
3) Profit!
---
As a white elephant gift.
---
Then again, when I get a random team invite I am guilty of ignoring too. Oops!
---
Here's my problem with "Waiting for other players to get a hit in."  Yes, I know it's common courtesy and I always try to do that for other players.  But it bothers me a little.
---
It makes zero sense from an immersion standpoint.  If I'm running in to help some strangers battle a group of grotesque murderous monsters in real life, especially if I see that the strangers are all weaker than I am, I would want to destroy those monsters as quickly as possible so no one gets hurt.  
---
Why in the world would I hit each monster one time and then back off?  
---
I don't play other multiplayer games but surely there has to be a way to share the XP/loot that makes more sense.
---
NP glad you found them
---
Tbh, hes fully within his rights to be pissed if stuff has disappeared from his inventory TWICE. Ridiculous that stuff like that is happening months after beta...
---
I dislike perk hotswapping, because I think the inconvenience of manual swapping is an intentional and important part of the perks system.  However, I like your system.  You remove the most aggravating part while still keeping balance in mind.
---
I'd maybe go a step further and restrict perk swapping to camp, workshop, or vault only.
---
They've turned the corner though. Most people are really happy with the Wild Appalachia expansion, and they're about to roll out the next set of enhancements in about an hour or so.
---
And frog jar crafting.  Lots and lots of fjc.
---
Other major games have done things to atone for their mistakes, but Bethesda just keeps on like everything is peachy.
---
Some people want wood armor due to shrouded effect.
---
That's what I sell it for and I get sales.
---
r/restofthefuckingowl
---
U have ammosmith and super duper..where u farm lead
---
I know. I'm saying the PR has been a disaster because of Bethesda's behavior and not because the game is as bad as journos make it out to be.
---
wow,  dont pay that guy any mind, you sell what you want for the prices you want!  I think 50 caps is a reasonable price
---
Drop Site C2 (East) is good for armour plan spawns, and farming mutations (Toxic Water).
---
There's a Monorail Car to the west of the Drop Site that can spawn Weapon Plans too, (You can wake up from Nukashine here too).
---
Thank you, but I'm on PS4!
---
You’re just being salty.
---
Damn, I had no idea.
---
I guess it's time for a Flux sale in my vending machine.
---
Here's what I think is going on, strictly from observation and some understanding of how online games are designed.
---
Some calculations are done on your local machine, but for the most part the server is doing the 'actual' math.  This is done for security (otherwise you'd just have a program running on your side that tells the server that you hit every shot and they all do 1000 damage, which people have done on other games).
---
So in the interest of making the game look good, your local client approximates what you're doing, then corrects when the server gets back to it to tell it what *actually* happened.  I think the local client assumes a lot of things that end up being wrong, like it's overly optimistic.  So *Your* game says you just hit that ghoul 5 times for 150 damage per, the server (within a fraction of a second) comes back and say no, you missed twice, and you're only doing 100 damage because of (armor, luck, whatever).  So then the mob health adjusts.
---
The alternative is you hit the mob 5 times, and nothing seems to happen.  Then after a tick, the health drops a bunch...kind of the opposite of what happens now.  Not saying that would be *worse* per say, but it would be very much more noticeable.
---
They need to balance this to make it smoother, for sure, but if your latency is particularly good (including your game speed, internet connection and ping, and the server speed), you'll barely notice it at all.  If any of those things are sub-optimal, you get that 'regen' sometimes.
---
It does work the other way sometimes, if your client thinks you hit for 100, but the server credits you for a crit, it will bump the mobs health down.  It happens a lot less frequently, but I have noticed it a few times.
---
If it's chameleon, I want your wood armor
---
Keep in mind that while you can rename things, as others described, there's a max limit on the number of total letters you use across all your custom names, and it's not particularly high, so don't plan on renaming everything.
---
Its great every time. My favorite are the ones where if you didn't buy anything, they lock you in a radiation room.
---
I bought Twisted Muscles serum recipe and crafted 70 of them this helped greatly
---
Well answered here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aiigkg/whats\_the\_max\_strength\_you\_can\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aiigkg/whats_the_max_strength_you_can_have/)
---
A small thing I also would love some Enclave and BOS flags in our camps, perhaps the flag of the Eastern Commonwealth that West Virginia belongs to.
---
" **Anytime  I see someone wearing PA it immediately tells me that I'm almost 100%  guaranteed to beat them in PvP. Anyone else feel this is a problem in game balance?"**

Seared venison recipe is in the food vendor at white springs.

The royal jelly is easy enough to get. One in a bath tub at top of a two story house on top of tanaga town in the Mire. There one in middle mountain cabins and north of vault 76, there is a crashed bicycle with royal jelly in the basket.
---
You need pectin to make jam and none of the plants provided have a lot of pectin in them.  Pectin free jelly/jam must be chilled once opened.
---
Yeah because you’re selling it for lower that it normally goes for...
---
A million times yes. So many bugs have been fixed and there is so much more content
---
Try it and get your own opinion. Don't let strangers on the internet decide for you.

Im around 170 so I don't think a level requirement is going to be an issue lol.
---
I just really want to practice on a few bots/ghouls just to get the feel of how they work before I start investing the cards into them.
---
Correct. Cap is set at 20%, so once you hit that cap any other movement speed bonuses aren't applied.
---
 If someone sells you anything good for caps they might as well have just given it to you for free.
---
How heavy are serums, if you don't mind my asking?

Yeah, can't place beds on a Boat I set my Camp on anymore, they float through the roof, same as Radios and the Alarm clock.
---
You also can't place Footlockers or Floor Safes under beds now either.
---
Oh, and stairs now don't let me build above/below/beside them if it's above the ground floor.
---
Since the update where they fixed this issue for tents, things like that don't work anywhere.
---
Yea I think ill have to have anti armor since im used to that with the gatling gun and stabilized
---
Did you need the plan specifically or just the weapon?
---
No problem 😊 can meet you after the update if you’d like?
---
First, I do not want to be mean but there are plenty posts asking the same question and second to answer your question, it would not hurt to give it another try. The game is a bit more stable and less buggy and theres a lot more content such as quest to complete.
---
SBQ and the imposter sheepsquatch both drop them, and probably the real sheepsquatch as well.  I haven't noticed it in any other events, but a few may drop them as well.
---
I don't do a lot of those fights, probably 10 queens and more of the other fights since the kits came out and I have I think 30+ of them.  They're pretty easy to forget about, I've broken weapons on the queen fight and just soldiered on with my crap weapons, forgetting I had the option to fix them.
---
100% agree.  I would wait for people to tag legendaries in the WS resort while getting obliterated by 7 ghouls, a wendigo, and a glowing radstag.  After having to repair my armor often after this, I said screw it and just started killing. If you're low level, or not prepared, don't come.  We don't have time to babysit.
---
Yes, it's today.  In theory, the patch notes should arrive shortly after downtime begins at 10am EST.  That's typically how it goes.
---
Thank you that saves me some perk points.
---
I will be on roughly about 6 hours from now when im home for work which will be about 8pm for me (uk time) if that's ok?
---
That's a random spawn encounter. There should have been 2-3 ghouls around it. Searching the grave use to be the only place you could get bone clubs.
---
If you're N of munitions (looks like the spot in pic), you can find the skier and halloween corpses for plans.
---
Radicool boosts strength too. I stick to instigating. Useful if you play alone and don't have others tagging enemies.
---
How did you get it to 29 with armor and weapons? I need this bad😂
---
No kidding. Their PR on this was pure shit. I'm a lucky one that bought cheap in February once they seem to have decided to start fixing things - game's been nothing but smooth sailing and constant upgrades *that are actual upgrades* for me. I can't imagine how pissed I'd be if I'd preordered the power armor edition. It's both hilarious and not at all funny that they still haven't dealt with the canvas bags.
---
I name my characters after the build I plan on working them towards for easy selection. Like melee, rifles etc.
---
They released a bad, unfinished broken game, the people still playing are people they know will keep playing virtually no matter what.  Like even in your own post you are admitting that if they make DLC paid that you will still won't quit. They have you, they don't need to do anything to keep you.
---
I take it you can't wear it with a hat either? I was hoping it would be a face mask like the bandana, because it might look pretty cool with the black cowboy hat :/
---
I would like to see a few flying creatures.. not like the SBs though.. easier flying creatures
---
Hmmm I hadn't noticed the anti-armor with stabilized not working on heavy energy guns, but I wasn't doing any real testing. I just figured it was working as my explosive Gatling Laser sheds most things that aren't scorchbeasts in short order. Would be nice to see that work properly and see the results against targets like those and mirelurk queens.
---
So you can make multiple characters and differentiate them
---
Yeah great, Chinese style social credit based of fake money in a imaginary world.
---
Was the mod ok'd by Bethesda?
---
Yes - nothing obnoxious like the SB. Small flying creatures would be welcome. I mainly just want to tame a vulture haha but they'd be neat to see in the game personally - like there's dead animal bodies scattered around - it would be neat if there was a chance for maybe 2-3 vultures to be at the body.
---
Yeah that should be fine, I’m +1 hour
---
Actually had it say "The Verdant Season Continues," the other day.
---
Only noticed it because it seemed different than the usual pop-ups that I ignore.
---
Lucky Hole Mine with the excavator and at vault 63 by the red crane for the ores. 
---
Yes I have the perks equipped but I don’t know how Super stacks in, I think it is 30% based on no ammosmith so it’s negligible.
---
People don't understand how computers work.  Honestly, some people believe that the game loads once and then everything just runs out of memory (and to be fair, small programs do work like that).
---
And to be fair, HDD speed is just one limiting factor, though it's one that a lot of people can fix with some ease.  Other bits in the hardware can slow things down as well, but that's getting into details that a lot of people don't have a really strong understanding of.
---
Just offer a layaway system, to make sure you get your caps up front.
---
You can wear a hat.
---
You can keep mutagenic slime too.
---
Go to low lvl places and kill scorched and trash their weapons for free steel
---
Go into nuke silos and collect all dumbells in the training room for free lead

Kill snallygasters for free acid

Server hop and you saved alot of time
---
I have one and it never leaves my inventory! Question though- do all creatures have armor?
---
Modify the camera at the workbench to upgrade the lens.
---
Thx

The item would be returned to your inventory and negative Karma for the buyer.
---
Iirc .25
---
I subsist on diet that's 90% grilled radstag and ribeye steaks. Several guaranteed spawns for each all over the map and also a ton of random spawn locations for radstags.
---
Gotta have that carry weight.
---
I do the same at West Tek, and have a BE Handmade. It does feel weak near full health, but using sneak attacks, headshots, and the covert operative perk (2.5 x dmg) it shouldn't take 6-7 shots to kill them ;)
---
Plus. you really need to use Demo Expert 5 with your AAE handmade, just in case you don't have that maxed already.
---
Also, swap out Serendipity 3 for Bloody Mess 3 (+15% to all dmg) because Serendipity only works at low health so you won't need that if you're running near full health.
---
Use chems eg. Pyschotats to give a damage boost, just keep enough addictol in your inventory to cure addiction.
---
No worries- I figured you out eventually!
---
Don't think anything is as complex, or at least as difficult to get ingredients for, as the scorchbeast stew thingy... and if I recall rightly the benefits from it are worse than if you just cook each SB part individually... if you go to that effort then the damn thing should not spoil for a week... a real week not an 'in game' week!
---
Which means they are either 1. Not learning from their mistakes, 2. Simply don't care, or 3. Did it on purpose.
---
I can't imagine any other potential causes, and those are all inexcusable.
---
are you fucking serious? lets see how you react when your best legendaries disappear, you fucking prick.
---
Yes that's the problem most people don't even know that it's not working. Why fixing bugs no one knows or complains about?

After collecting 1400 I spend the rest of the time buying bobby pins for as much as 5 per cap. That's the only thing worth doing imo.

2 - herd mentality

Oh, wow, actually this might make this a buy for me then, thanks!
---
dont do it, theres a bug that causes items to disappear that is commonly thought to be linked to naming said items.

I somehow acquired a Lead Lined Combat Armor plan yesterday.  I suspect it was from a treasure map.  I think that one can be bought, though.
---
Combat Armor Dense, on the other hand, is like a unicorn whether it's a mod or plan.  Prior to Patch 9, I had come across the mod once at the inner Grafton vendor - along with pretty much every other Dense mod - after it had gone totally missing from vendors since Patch 5 or so (the same time the BoS plans vanished).  I haven't seen it anywhere since Patch 9.  I have heard players say that it can be a random drop from treasure maps or Megasloths.
---
Ultimately, I came across a 2\* Unyielding piece of Marine Armor and tossed Dense on that, because the Marine Dense Mod is really easy to come by compared to the others.
---
The  ProSnap Deluxe 105mm Lens 📷 is a craftable mod attachment for the ProSnap Camera. It can only be obtained after you complete the tourist quest line. A broken camera can only be found via several spawn locations, including the tourist and random world boxes.

In reality, pectin naturally occurs in berries, apples and other fruits. Let me scrap some dandy boy  apples!

Now build a shopping area underneath so all customers may bask in your depravity
---
Why is the hunters long coat so expensive?
---
A majority of people with a rifle build do use LA, but I agree, who the hell uses pickaxes after level 20. 50 Cal, Garling Gun, A good skin for Super Sledge (the super mutant one looks awful), and a handmade would be nice.
---
Hopefully these aren’t troll posts...
---
Oh sounds about right thanks!
---
good thing is you made your caps, but those resellers are not gonna sell that stuff so that crazy price!
---
 For me it's outfits that keep disappearing.  I've lost tattered field jacket, forest camo jump suit, and two other lesser ones.  Very disappointing but I'm glad it's not my guns
---
15hp? Shit, I've been stocking a variety of these for a pistol medic build I was making =[
---
That would also work maybe you could pay vendor bots your layaway payments.
---
&gt;So it looks like you actually don't get max level legendary, with low level character, every time. Thats even more annoying than i thought. There is no reason for me to play longer than hour daily, with those limites.
---
Please understand that I'm not being snarky when I say this, though it may come off that way, but that mechanic isn't there just to annoy or thwart you.  The weapons are meant to be used in the game.  Why should a level 15--who is not a mule or an alt but genuinely just wants to play the game--be forced to wait 35 levels to use a 3* they got from the Purveyor?
---
I can get 5k caps in 4 days easy.. I don’t get god rolls every 4 days,so I’ll will charge more than 5 k for them.....
---
I finished the quest last night and I tried to build it but it said I needed a broken camera, but I guess turns out I need to mod my current camera instead of building a new one!
---
The only vendor that sells it is the wandering Responders vendor, and it's kind of a first-come-first-serve-hope-no-one-kills-him thing.
---
What if Tuesday is today
---
U can add food + Chem buffs too
---
2 - deathclaw steak

6 - whisky

2 - psychobuff

You had it on a gatling plasma. Oh boy, you are a brick wall.
---
In game trading has good items but for those looking for the perfect prefixes or top tier gear that other players would just keep and use for themselves, that's where you get people willing to go overboard with prices.  Its the high-end top 1% of the market, but prices have moderated since the addition of player vending for most things and caps is not totally worthless anymore.
---
Player vending is hugely positive for the market, but neither that nor the Purveyor really addresses the scarcity of certain stuff.  The only way to really fix this is to allow people to reroll effects or allow rampant duping back into the game (although it seems Bethesda has allowed some duping back into the game since the last patch - hopefully that gets patched out today).
---
That is awesome! Are you on PC? I would love to visit, haha.
---
Creatine.
---
This would make sense if i were shooting them and they were regaining a portion of health but in reality i shoot them until their health reaches to a sliver and stops so they don't die and then they proceed to regen to full health with nothing lost
---
Yeah, it was pretty daft.  I don't think it was big enough to even hold all the main quest rewards, once you factor in stupid stuff like the Bunker Buster and the Pyrolizer.
---
You do understand that just because it may be a similar bug to one which happened before (which the 3 star armor becoming 1 star is not) does not mean that it has the same cause or solution nor does it mean it is somehow a simple fix.
---
As a creator, I get daily spam emails from these legendary/cap selling websites and it's incredibly annoying. Tried to report them and even once tried to make a GDPR complaint, but to no luck.
---
😝 snort that shit through my eyeballs with this character

I never said you can't fast travel because your social score is to low. ( or take the bus or buy a plane ticket)

I havea bunch of treasure maps, will try! Thanks
---
For what it's worth I actually sold my heavy guns because I got sick of changing perk cards. My Gatling plasma and minigun just gathered dust because Everytime someone nuked the queen I caught myself saying "nah fuck it I don't feel like changing all my cards"
---
i've had people try to pick the lock while i'm standing there...
---
what are you selling your fasnacht masks for? so far noone seems interested in mine at 200 caps each
---
Sure I can understand that but this was Uranium Fever where there is literally no threat and really its only purpose is for the legendaries. And for your example of being surrounded while waiting, what would stop you from killing the non legendary mobs really quick?
---
Lawn deer and an array of god awful christian statuary.  I want a distressed Mary holding a partially cracked baby Jesus plus a manger scene
---
love this.
---
Not as a visitor
---
QE Harpoon gun. 4 harpoons.
---
If Cazadors get added and hell is unleashed on Appalachia, I'm blaming you.
---
I didn’t know there was a wandering responders vendor, I guess I’ll keep my eyes peeled for now on.
---
Level gated content is a major issue with any game that has it...
---
Better pay up
---
I always one shot enemies. If i come to a place where someone already is farming i just server hop. If im first i kill as quikly as i can  . I wont kill myself to be nice.

Move your camp to a acid resource spot 
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/?st=JPAVIYXC&amp;sh=f13b5e38
---
Halucigen gas canister at the Poseidon Power Plant yield 5 acid and are in the workshop/locker room area down the bottom of the plant behind a locked door when scrapped each one gives 5 acid
---
Alternatively Hemlock Holes (workshop) has three acid deposits.
---
I agree if you're running up to help random strangers, but this was during Uranium Fever where there is zero threat and you're stuck for pretty much 8 minutes.
---
Can you suggest what else we should be doing? Bethesda has made a concerted effort to push the endgame towards gear grind, which means grinding legendaries. So if the game design is pushing us that way, Id love to hear what it is other people are doing.
---
Yup. I work from home though, so I can multitask ;)
---
It could be auto payments you sell stuff to vendor's 25% goes to the lender.
---
Love that idea! 'Cannery' piece of equipment you can build in your camp... after having done some monster quest to obtain the plans. Needs 20 electricity and can only make 10 a day... but then it doesn't spoil.
---
How did you get them into your shop?  I have tried on ps4 and it isn’t listed. Are they prosnaps or deluxe prosnaps?  Only the latter is reparable for camera challenges.
---
How do people place teddy bears?
---
Did not mean to come off that way. Life is too short to be that upset about weapons and armor in a video game. Way too short. That's all I was getting at.
---
OP didn't mention their system, but it seems like I've seen this a lot on consoles.  Don't know why that makes a difference.
---
I'm on PC.  I hop servers a *ton*.  I've had quite a few times that my base couldn't be loaded (and I stay on that server anyway, most of the time).  I occasionally turn my vendors' power off, though I never remove them.  And I've never had my vendor inventory reset.
---
You don't get a lot of the heavy weapons perks till 30+ anyways. Starting a new character will take just as long as respeccing.
---
They aren’t helping steer people away from those sites by making decent drops virtually non-existent.
---
My rule of thumb for pricing (more of a guideline, really) stuff I sell in my vending machine is base 500 for a \* legendary, 750 for \*\*, and 1000 for \*\*\*, regardless of legendary effects. If I break the rule, I sell it for its in-game value. What do I need 5K caps in one transaction for? My stash is full, I need space more than I need caps. I just want to price it so it's not so low it looks suspicious, but certainly not so high that I've priced 95% of the player base out of what I'm selling.
---
That's why I carry a shotgun and use the enforcer perk.  1 bear is usually no trouble.  2 will play handball with you if you let them both get on you, 3 is usually a death sentence.
---
I would love to find a gun like this, thank you!
---
I see it sold at .5-1c each but people rarely buy it. I have 60K if you're interested.
---
I would settle for overall carry weight by category.  That way I can see how much total junk I have..
---
Someone who seems to genuinely get this player vending thing
---
Is it a Colonel Gutsy?  Yeah, they're tough little bastards.
---
Just got the mod for dense, hope one day I'll be able to get the plans for it
---
It would be 25% less underwhelming I guess.
---
Thank you all for your suggestions, it certainly gives me options to try out! Thanks for being so helpful and informative!
---
I had a dream I got one, then was disappointed when I woke up.
---
Depends on the enemy. Gutsies have a ton of armor and hit like a freight train. Their thrusters are the most vulnerable point.
---
Yeah, this glitch basicaly ruins almost whole experience, because game is just plain ugly to look at. And damn I can deal with bugs, but this one is so persistant and all over the world... what have I tried to fix it, nothing worked. I dont even know what to do at this point. My PC works perfectly with every game that exists and I simply just do not want to bother anymore with this. All good things in this game are burried under tons and tons of issues. And I am damn tired of digging for them every single time I play it.
---
It is because it is a damn Gutsy. They are the video game version of the spawn of satan himself.
---
They're listed in the junk tab I moved them to my stash and priced them. I'm pretty sure they're prosnap Deluxe.... now I have my doubts.....I'll check tonight I didn't know there were 2 cameras
---
Yeah they are, also make sure you have demolition expert on for some extra damage!
---
Sure, but again this was during Uranium Fever. This guy was in full X01 power armor. There is no threat. Plus he wasnt one shotting, he would unload with a TSE shotty 5 or 6 times.
---
I dunno, maybe.  Play it for an hour or two and see what you think.
---
Its a bug with the gatling gun.
---
It sure seems like it happens more and more often these days...
---
Where do you get the recipe for hard lemonade?
---
The Root cause is lack of proper testing before releasing something, in this case they proudly released the Purveyor early, with 2 major bugs, one of which was absolutely intentional, and the other that was very short sighted.
---
not at all how it came off tbh, but fair enough.
---
Yeah my bad, did not notice that. Its enough to bash them if i remember .
---
Your listing a video several months out of date, and it's clear from your comments that you don't understand fundamental game mechanics and how to counter "op" player sentinel builds etc. You don't need end game gear to wreck havoc in PvP. I've seen people tear up with a non legendary handmade.
---
 I see so many players Going into pvp with excavator power armor and 5 points of luck while expecting to compete with people with glass canon builds and sneak Crits. Like any other MMO, there is optimal builds and play styles for PvP and pve. 
---
All you need to kill an "unkillable" player is a few Crits to the head, and that's as simple as using vats. You never needed a god roll handmade to compete, just some common sense, knowledge of how luck tree perks can make you a vats killing machine and a basic understanding of game mechanics.
---
I'm pretty heavy on perception and next in strength.  I can give you exacts when I'm home and on later today if you like.  And I upvoted you, some people are really sad sacks of human excrement and pushing the thumbs down button validates their existence for the day, just ignore them like the rest of us do 😊
---
&gt;You can craft items and then scrap them to learn plans.
---
how can i craft items, before i have the plan?
---
Where would we be without Señor Scribe Neriah (that's how I read it initially, dont remind me that she's a woman lol)
---
You can get the plans for it and make one.
---
HUGE FIX NEEDED....EASY: 
---
When we leave the game (or it crashes), save our place for just two minutes, so we can log back into the same world, so we don't lose workshop building progress, etc... or creature respawns, etc..  just two friggin minutes will save HOURS of wasted investment!
---
You can find broken pro cameras in various containers around the wasteland. Just check everything as you go around. I find probaly 2 an hour if I am looking at everything. Also did you check all tabs? I seem to remember it going into something I didn't expect like Misc or something.
---
Use cheats for "the sight"
---
(Don't actually you will get banned)
---
Im low level compared to my friends. Whenever they come apon a 3* creature or whatever, they let me know and i go to them and get a few hits in before they kill it. Their nice that way.
---
Colonel Gutsy eats your weapons and your armor
---
I have no idea what my character’s name is either. But yea, if you have more than one you need names in the Character screen.
---
It takes me more than a few hours to just do all the daily's... That's what I'm doing most of the time. Other than that, it's getting 5 characters @ lv 50+. I have 3 now, about to start on the fourth. Just finishing all of the quests on 5 characters. Not an easy task. I also spend a fair chunk of time doing challenges.
---
I accidently send friend and team requests just trying to fast travel to locations with player dots covering the area...it's a hot mess.
---
Class Freak does not effect Herd Mentality \*at all\*
---
Is there pancakes on the roof?
---
Their official stance to mods are:  
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod) 
---
So while no mods are individually ok by them, they don't ban people for using them (a lot of people here will claim that, however the people who got banned was using CheatEngine, not mods). Their stance simply is that the game might not work properly for you. That is all.
---
Be aware that some mods might create problems after a patch, since they are not updated to work with the changes in the files. An update to the custom ini file will most often fix this quickly.
---
The way I look at it, every company needs a reliable cash cow to finance the riskier things that potentially won't be.  For the longest time with EA, that was Madden.  And because of Madden, you could have your Dead Spaces and your Mirror's Edge.  The problem is, as time went on, EA stopped taking risks like that and went all-in on the cash shop like a cheesy mobile developer.  Worse, EA would make all these bold proclamations about the death of single player games and why no one should make them.  It wasn't bad enough that they dropped the ball on a hit like Titanfall 2 - they had to poison the well for everyone else.
---
So, when I look at Bethesda, yeah Blades chafes.  But at the same time, we still got those games EA said no one could make anymore.  We got things like Prey, The Evil Within 2, Wolfenstein, TNC, etc.  Prey, especially.  I don't see 2K lining up to make another BioShock anytime soon, do you?  They've bought the narrative that smart games like BioShock can't be made anymore, at least not by triple-As.  And yet, here's Prey, which sacrifices little as a homage to System Shock 2.
---
Bethesda is far from perfect.  But as long as they deliver content like that, I can overlook certain transgressions.
---
I explored most of the map, at least enough to get a handful of FT points, before I even hit level 50.
---
Participated in a couple nuke zones and SBQ fights.
---
I never initiate team invites, but I was super grateful when a level 170+ sent me an invite for a nuked Whitespring.
---
I had been following him around already, trying to tag as much as I could, because obviously I wasn't at a point where I could solo more than 1 enemy at a time (if that, lol). And the combo of so many enemies and so many players, plus the nuke zone itself, was wrecking my framerate, so I was struggling to do anything on my own.
---
I got so much loot after we teamed up, haha.
---
If you ask around you can probably get a 1* Instigating pretty easily to start off.
---
proof?
---
You will be bored soon again. Game have not a proper endgame.
---
*laughs in melee build*
---
I do all of that besides the sneak attack and chems, I'll have to keep that in mind, I never use chems lol
---
That’s how they work, those youtubers are the dupers and their profit sharing buddies. Before the mid Fed dupe removal some of them shat their pants. A guy called polarbear or something almost cried when he said he probably won’t have anything left tomorrow but said it won’t affect him lol. Then when all Bethesda did was to remove hugely overweight accounts, they resumed their duping exploit and ‘showcasing’ stuff their duper buddies fished from noobs.
---
Someone else already mentioned the Good With Salt perk, but I really like this idea. I really like little details as they're almost always the ones that make the game more immersive.
---
My camp is just off the bridge at sunshine meadows farm near flatwoods. 
---
For a full effect at seeing the camp, I suggest travelling in to the hotdog stand/shack nearby and crossing the bridge to see the camp in its glory :) 
---
Anyway, was thinking we could then do a route on the road to flatwoods, and up to the nearby radio tower on the hill. I can kill the trash mobs there along the way while testing performance and feel etc.
---
Ill make sure to have gunsmith on so I don't break them easily! lol
---
There's so many better designs when it comes to the current perk system.  Especially for the various quality-of-life perks that simply don't affect combat.  Whether that is reducing the number of SPECIAL points needed to equip certain perks, allowing someone to gain an extra perk slot for leveling past the point where you gain SPECIAL points, or having slots dedicated to certain activities that don't need to take perk slots.  
---
But especially if someone runs different kinds of combat builds.  Like once you've gotten a decent set of power armor, being able to swap back out into a stealth build for when you don't run around in power armor.
---
They are nice, till EVERYONE starts doing them. I'm a low level player, that plays maybe 4 hours per week. Having player vender camps are a great idea because it helps me to store my junk/guns can't use yet etc. And I can buy healing/ammo as well. But if I have to be worried about every camp being a Saw movie, that just turns into a new form of griefing.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
I've done a bunch as an under-50. I probably have little to no positive impact, but I do at least participate.
---
I'll hide on a roof or as far from the big enemies as I can and snipe. Iv'e taking out a couple of the spawns during the SBQ fight.
---
But I've never gone and just loitered safely to try and mooch rewards.
---
Form your own opinions! But then again if you need people to tell you what to like, your probably best playing something more mainstream
---
*one hits the gusty with my power fist* but shoots 10+ grenades to kill a single robot.
---
That's okay, maybe you die in a nuke zone if you haven't damaged in over a minute
---
I would agree that that’s a fair limitation.  I just don’t want to see hotswapping in combat, and to be fair, I’m usually only swapping a lot of perks in my C.A.M.P. anyways.
---
What legacy weapons don't drop anymore?
---
Bug fixes are still considered nerfs/buffs...
---
I don't think you're looking at the right item.
---
Check your tinker bench and see if you have a Camera tab that will let you repair all of those.
---
Broken (and fixed) aren't tradeable.
---
I did the Fasnacht parade a half dozen times. I tagged the Sloth... once. Hell, I think I only managed to kill one mob the entire run. It was nothing but douchebags one-shotting everything.
---
That’s also the personality of those dupers and youtubers, outright stealing from Bethesda.
---
Worth more than that imo. Pretty much the best role for that gun... I wouldn’t sell less than 2.5k
---
How is that a fun game mechanic? Ugh I'm fine with them having advantages but not being invincible.
---
Yeah it’s 91 dr. Worth it IMO I use it over the high capacity
---
It's a video game. Server hop. While I think its dickish  to do what he did, he did buy the game, and can play how he wants.
---
I got one but tbh I don’t use it; still use the high capacity to hoard bc don’t need the resist?
---
Every time I have encountered this I have had to fully move my camp ...it.... *sucks*
---
so does the surgical mask.
---
Good analysis. Thank you.
---
Oh nice. I'll  probably end up getting it if its that high. How much does it affect carry weight of the backpack?
---
I named my 3* Instigating .44 pistol Shooty McBangBang and my Anti armor handmade ‘A Handy’. Also my explosive laser is McBeamy
---
Kinda.
---
What I'm asking for is crafting.
---
yeah it seems strange there are no rifle weight reducing perks
---
a post recently on this sub was : "why does a fatman weight less than a modded rifle?"
---
I like having too much resist. Lol it makes me feel like I'm in a safe place.
---
I agree, it was his response that surprised me more than anything. And I wasn't having issues getting hits in, I was arguing for the 3 other sub lv 50 randoms.
---
Yeah, Instigating builds are really good as solo, You can normally one hit colonial gutsy and Lvl 68 Super Mutants and I only have 3 ranks of slugger.
---
Colonel gutsies are tough. They can shred you and are tough to kill. Always have been.
---
I run both and the charged hit does some good damage still. I never tried it without both of them on.
---
There is always a Handmade rifle spawn at the Burrows, on the wall in a locked (lv3) cage, to left of the only weapon bench down there
---
Ahh yes, bethesda is intentionally bugging their own products. They released the tin foil suit into the atom shop just for you I think.
---
You might check your grenade perks and enable some that increase the blast radius and damage.
---
That sounds utterly cancerous.
---
I kinda like the falling damage one as i use marsupial and speed demon and i take some crazy jumps sometimes :)
---
Beths server would go kaput with the extra math crunch.
---
This is going to be an unpopular reply but it’s how I play...
---
I’m around level 140, if I’m running through an area and there are players above level 50 then it’s as simple as first come first served, if you want to get a hit in then get it in quickly because I’m not waiting around for people also capable of one hitting enemies.
---
If I see players below level 50 I’ll hang back and provide support to ensure they are able to gets hits in and I’m always happy to revive them if they get into too much trouble lol. I feel this is fair play.
---
Instead of discarding bloodied, you could put more perks into resistance.  Dodgy, evasive, serendipity, nerd rage.  It takes a lot to bring me down, even when I have a sliver of health.  Bolstering armor with strength perks helps your DR too.
---
I found that selling things on the reddit fo76 market/bazaar subs gives you much much much better prices than selling in game
---
what would sell for 10,000 on the market place sells for like 1000 in game
---
you cant have mutants and two shot on the same gun
---
 I had the crossbow plans so I crafted a level 15 to save on repair costs later.  Like you, I went to the forest for quick and easy kills.  I've noticed some people in various threads talking about how long it took for their crossbow to break, but the challenge isn't *break and reapir* a crossbow.  It's just *repair*.  So the moment my condition bar was even a fraction degraded, I headed to a repair bench and made sure Weapons Artisan wasn't equipped to keep it from repairing to 200%.
---
I'm not sure. If you're talking maxed-out Good with Salt, maybe? I only ever had the first tier of that perk and the backpack mod works a LOT better than that, for sure.
---
I used a L20 1\* vampire machete as my primary weapon from L24-L45.
---
@L86 now, and my primary weapon is a 1\* vampire serrated switchblade.
---
So I would say yes, use some to see what you get.
---
Since Arktos is located in the forest just my regular gear.  The Burrows was in a higher level area and it wasn't a problem so see no reason to switch up anything.
---
If it does affect Herd Mentality, it would only be 75% reduction. Some of the mutations have been bugged for a while, so that might be one. Grounded was unaffected by Class Freak until the last patch; I'm really glad that's fixed now!
---
Im just gonna have 3 backpacks, one High capacity, one plated and a refrigerated one...
---
I don't like PA so this was a huge win for me. I'll trade 30 capacity for 91 Dr all day long
---
Ever read the patch notes?
---
I mean yeah, sure, but I was focusing more on solutions that are actually possible in game at this point in time.
---
Twisted muscles on its own adds far more damage than tse.
---
The math doesn't lie.
---
Popularity and a bug doesn't make the numbers any different.
---
Pretty sure class freak works with speed demon. My hunger and thirst don't drain really fast. Think it just a visual error on the effects screen.
---
Those made me chuckle. Who actually uses the pickaxe?
---
It's the tinkerers bench I know I was confused at first I assumed it would be on the weapons bench
---
A new set of cookable items with extended shelf life would be fantastic too
---
Nope it's not a visual bug, it has been tested and confirmed it's actually not working.
---
Yea if the DR wasnt high enough to me, i wasnt gonna invest in it and instead go with refrigerated.
---
Drops it Down to 30 instead of 60
---
Yeah, but personally I have other things I'd rather devote 3 points of Luck to than food management, so I'll take a penalty to DR over not having to devote my perks to keeping my food from turning into inedible mush any day.
---
I meet a lot of players through trading with my vendor characters, and frequently team up with lower level players and help them with events like Uranium Fever, or One Violent Night, but on one occasion a couple months back, I got a team invite from someone while I was at Scorched Earth, and accepted only to find myself on a team with someone I had a run in with earlier, who quickly travelled to my Camp. you already know how the rest of that story goes.
---
Good ideas, but I'd never drink that coffee! Creamy coffee isn't for this guy. I only use whole milk if it's a cappuccino. Black otherwise. 
---
Loving the planters. Maybe being able to grow different plants with perks like Green Thumb would make the game loads better.
---
It depends on your setup. [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Thanks, I have the map and knew those things but I really appreciate it nonetheless. I may have to move to an acid deposit. It’s too time consuming IRL.
---
I was the only dude not in power armour, and the only one without explosive ammo. It was awful. 
---
My ONLY complaint with this game is that Bethesda made it way too "power gamer" friendly. 
---
Maybe, just maybe... they'll come out with a true "realistic" survival mode/ RP server at some point.
---
Oh wow, credits to who made that. Thanks
---
Good With Salt doesn't effect things kept in our stashes, though! We must have lost the knowledge of preservation techniques because Cranberry Jam expires about as fast as a fresh cooked cranberry cobbler -__-】
---
Lol, yeah I’m roughly 500 hours into the game but haven’t actually got around to buying it.
---
I didn't know that! Thanks for the tip :)
---
they are down for me on PC.. no patch notes yet I can see rn
---
I actually put like 3k rounds of .38 and 1k of .44 for free. I don't really need caps, so I thought it'd be a nice treat for someone who needed those and found my camp randomly.
---
Don't worry, his anger is clouding the fact that he has absolutely no idea how video game development works.
---
Right! I don't think physics breaking builds will go up in frequency, just potency. And some insane people could do elaborate builds breaking all the rules. It's not like the budget allows for much in terms of size anyway
---
In fact the terminals before you leave 76 are quite clear they *refused to issue the weapons they had* when the time came!
---
Charleston Fire Dept has a gym room with a ton of lead as wellz, just thought I'd mention.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/343741/fallout-76-maintenance-may-21-2019/2?language%5B%5D=en
---
Should be down now.
---
I have a slight addition to your suggestion; the bot that runs Appalachia's cooking radio show and/or teaches you about cooking stuff is a Gordon Ramsay parody.
---
They released a buggy game yes, broken? No, if it was broken it would be unplayable, I have over 500 hours in it that says otherwise.  
---
I play it because its a fallout game and its fun to play, they dont "have" me any more than FO4 "had" me, If I enjoy the game, I will play it, if they make it unenjoyable, I will find another game to "have" me.  
---
"They have you" Seriously what is this? What do you expect? them to make a game that makes them no money and pander to your every need because you paid a bit of money for something they never promised.  
---
They said the atom shop was going to fund future DLC and servers (so they dont lose money from keeping the game online)  
---
And thats what it has done, they said you can earn atoms in game, which you can, and dont try and use the excuse of them making atoms harder and harder to collect as we all knew this would happen, there was no way in hell any game company would keep the in game currency as easy to collect as at launch.  
---
Even with these harder challenges, there still isnt a game that ive played with easier to obtain premium currency.  
---
For you to say the game is "bad" is just a matter of opinion again, you say its bad but I enjoy the game and so do many other people.  
---
If you dont enjoy it, dont play it, its a very simple concept, I dont enjoy skyrim, so I dont play it, I dont enjoy Fifa, so I dont play it, I enjoy Fallout, so I play it, and Ill play it until I get something else that I enjoy or I stop enjoying this one
---
Thanks for being awesome.
---
Yeah, just got the notice 5 seconds ago :D
---
No. There’s one for both. The regular sledgehammer has a croquet mallet skin, and the super sledge has the super mutant one
---
where? for containment and research purposes
---
FWIW - I've killed a number of real sheepsquatch, regular and legendary - have not gotten a repair kit as a drop
---
I have a xim (not apex) and i don't use it.
---
Nothing in this game rewards faster twitch capabilities than a controller. 
---
I wouldn't buy one for this game.
---
You know it used to be you could put on the ammo perk that reduces ammo weights by 90%, and then put on some armor that reduced ammo weights an additional 20%, and it would work. Now it doesn't. Annoying.
---
I just want a door that automatically closes after 30 seconds. We know they have them -- Nuka Cola machine door in the Nukashine, for example. Put it in the atom shop, and charge whatever you want for it. I'll PAY IT. Oh, how happy I'd be to be able to come home to my CAMP and find all the doors CLOSED. :)
---
Anoying is, that u can't avoid 150 daily limit. Low levels should be able to reroll legendaries to their level, that's right.
---
You can get the royal jelly from that picnic basket once every 24 hours. Grab everything in the basket when you do. Then when you come back the next day, if it's not there, but the other stuff is, that means someone beat you to it and just server hop. If the whole basket is empty, you just didn't wait long enough and it hasn't respawned (or the previous person grabbed everything too, but less likely). I got 3 pieces in 3 days from the basket.
---
There is a chance you may already know the recipe. It's under the prepared category IIRC and not meat. I had that issue trying to make the cranberry meatball grinder. But yeah, the Whitespring vendor should have it.
---
Yeah I have one of those. Tried to sell it for the longest time and no one wanted it. Fine I'll wear it myself.
---
I talk to people all of the time (On PC)
---
This got me thinking... Would it be nice if all of these perks passively applied to our stash whether they were equipped or not would significantly boost stash size for high levels while keeping the same 800 limit? Or is that just too OP
---
IIRC there are implications that the War happened before that plan was ready--the ArcJet building in FO4 is a good example.  The "Mars mission" was almost certainly a cover for this plan, but the bombs dropped before the tech was proven and ready for use, so they got stuck on the oil platform, or wherever else they holed up.
---
Hmm. I didn't notice when ammo sold what it did to my caps. That's kind of shitty.
---
I use those too! :) but also bird bones, which I find very much worth it
---
Doing 430-470 with my BE one
---
I happened to get a [Bloodied Handmade](https://i.imgur.com/AVq1Cki.jpg) yesterday. This is with adrenal reaction, nerd rage, but zero rifle cards.
---
That's incredibly apparent
---
I hope they make it so if your teammate gets into Pvp, it is just him , not your whole team that gets drawn in
---
Yes all the time
---
Doesn't seem to reduce the rad. At least not what's stated
---
I’m on Xbox and I regularly use the Xbox text function. Occasionally use a mic.
---
Yeah, PC is what i'm asking for =)
---
That would be perfect for fixing the issue
---
Oh for sure. Whenever a nuke drops I make sure to note the username of whoever dropped it and a couple other easy names on the server. So far I'm 3/3 for people pulling me back onto the server.
---
Yes!
---
What I'm suggesting is basically you cook the meat first.
---
Then add salt in the cooking station to the already cooked item to make it "salted" as a prefix.
---
Have this buff its condition to 200%
---
Only energy dmg
---
I want a really scary REAL GHOST that can only be killed with energy weapon. With all the dead bu nukes, there should be plenty of uneasy spirit around. They will haunt your camp...and moving around stuff without you knowing...flickery lights...
---
And there will be a quest called Ghostbusting where we team up and go to a tall building to defeat the Master Ghost of all and close the hell door.
---
:)))))))
---
Right?
---
And salting meat is as old as time.
---
Have you tried lately? On the first day my level 2 character got level 50 items, a couple of days later it’s level 1.
---
I can see it working by the popups when people talk.. but Ive never been able to hear voice chat on PC
---
Some people do, other (like me) aviod people in game, prefer to go it alone except for some of the events
---
Excited to explore Arktos for that juicy lore!
---
New bug list, fresh off the press!
---
For anyone interested, here is list number [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a575z2/fallout_76_patch_notes_december_11_2018/ebkrjo0/?context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a83nxr/fallout_76_common_issues_and_solutions/ec8eabn/?context=3)/[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejlcj/fallout_76_january_10_patch_notes/edpv47p/?context=3)/[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/ef9gpil/?context=3)/[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/egsw5r0/?context=3)/[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0mjux/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_notes_march_13/eifkfp9/?context=3)/[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5qbmc/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_notes_march_26/ejf3ae9/?context=3)/[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb8c7d/wild_appalachia_patch_notes_april_9_2019/ekgwefj/?context=3)/[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bggxol/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_85_notes_april/elkoz4g/?context=3)/[10](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blra0h/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_9_notes_may_7/emqokw6/?context=3)

***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
Here's a few more yet-unfixed bugs that I am revisiting in case they were forgotten!
---
* Pipfall, Zeta Invaders, Grognak &amp; the Ruby Ruins, and Atomic Command holotape games are all [missing their unique holotape models](https://imgur.com/a/irWrIoh)
---
* Hallucigen Gas Grenades are not affected by Ordinance Express   
---
* Hallucigen Gas Grenades have no description, anywhere, that describes what they do
---
* Hallucigen Gas Grenades appear to have zero effect (they do not frenzy enemies like they did in Fallout 4, and don't have a message that a frenzy attempt has failed either)
---
* Event - It's a Trap - When you activate any lure, the ensuing audio is missing an audio filter
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Sheepsquatch has broken dismemberment; it has no stumps for its limbs, which lets you see through the model, and the textures on its dismembered limbs are stretched and broken, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/htYuuWY)
---
* If the Sheepsquatch Staff/Club have the Burning or Burning Barbed mod, inspecting them in the pip-boy/transfer menus will cause the preview model to slowly disappear, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/2OvQftq) (this may affect other mods as well)
---
* Weapon Iron Sights can sometimes become displaced; they will appear [lower than the center of the screen.](https://imgur.com/a/5A0OfXV) Re-equipping the weapon fixes this
---
* There is a table near Silva Homestead with [no collision](https://imgur.com/a/LuYh5Wq)
---
* Cultist Daggers can drop with mods like Stealth Blade and Serrated, but when inspected show [no mods attached](https://imgur.com/a/VP65ADu)
---
* When Bee Swarms die, they leave behind [small ant bodies](https://imgur.com/a/pt8HrQH) (posting again now that I have screenshots)
---
* If Campfire Tales/Stings and Things/Operation Tidy gives you a Possum Badge, it will display incorrect numbers, like [200,000 + 31](https://imgur.com/a/uJcaU7a)
---
* When viewed in the crafting menu or pip-boy, the Frog Jar has an [extremely large model](https://imgur.com/a/JswR3ON)
---
* [Horse trailers](https://imgur.com/a/LBtiP1L) have broken collision, you cannot reach items/containers that are inside them
---
* Reading an event description, backing out, and then trying to place a map marker will [add the event text to the marker message](https://imgur.com/a/vVHivLg)
---
* Inside Vault-Tec University, in the Young Dweller/Development area, there is a hole in the wall where the [void is visible](https://imgur.com/a/QeMX6Rx)
---
* Scout Leader Jaggy's first voice line, "Hello, what have we here?...", is missing an audio filter
---
* The Swimming Instructor at Spruce Knob Lake is missing an audio filter on the voiceline, "Obviously you need a swimsuit to take a swimming test..."
---
* The Swimming Instructor's line, "Ok twerps listen up", is incorrectly transcribed; it should be "Ok twerps, let's get this over with" based on ingame audio
---
* Enclave Events do not correctly count towards "Complete events" challenges
---
* Tadpole: Herpetologist - Crafting a Frog Habitat does not correctly count towards this challenge
---
* Possum: Chemist - Shooting animals with a syringer does not correctly count towards this challenge
---
* Possum: Musician - Playing any instruments does not correctly count towards this challenge
---
* Crumpled Fedora does not count as a fedora for the Tadpole challenge (it is missing the ClothingTypeFedora keyword) 
---
* Manta Man Costume does not count as a costume for the purpose of challenges, despite being called a costume (it is missing the ClothingTypeCostume keyword)
---
* Event - It's a Trap - If this event spawns in the Mire, at Cliffwalk Track, the Scorchbeast will frequently spawn outside of the event area. If it is killed outside of the area, the event can become uncompletable
---
* Backpack High Capacity Mod - This mod becomes craftable immediately on purchase, and also gives you a plan which automatically becomes (Known)
---
* Dying while Well Rested or Well Tuned will cause that buff to disappear (similar to how addictions used to)
---
* Survival Mode weekly challenges are currently completable in Adventure Mode
---
* Atom Shop - Hero of the Wasteland Statue cannot be moved or scrapped after being placed, it says "One or more related items are in use."
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Skins for Raider Power Armor (and maybe a buff so it is a viable alternative compared to the other armors)
---
* Make it a bit clearer that you need to complete challenges for The Order of the Tadpole Quest, the way it is currently worded is not very intuitive. Perhaps something like "Growth: Complete World Challenges - Tadpole (0/3)"
---
* Option to 'hide' our backpacks, so they aren't seen in 3rd person (they sometimes clash with certain outfits)
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Make Lode Baring Claim Tokens weigh 0 instead of 0.1. Every other currency-type token weighs nothing, like Mr. Fuzzy Tokens (or remove these alternative currencies from the Misc. Tab and add them to the new 'Collections' tab)
---
* Add Sheepsquatch Staff/Club and Shepherd's Crook to the legendary list
---
Cheers!
---
Miners mostly.
---
I've got all the grenade and shotgunner perks
---
Good amount of chat on PS4. Then again a lot don't as well. I don't always have my mic on. You'll find some just chill at camp and talk. Just depends on how busy it is.
---
For the what? That sounds awesome
---
I would prefer a half and half system.  Have some things be passive, but still have a few loadouts.  Being able to just flip a switch, so to speak, to change from my adventuring loadout to crafting or repairing would be nice.
---
But, I know that's just wishful thinking.
---
Maybe introduce some more perks that are hybrid cards.  Instead of a card for fixing weapons 200% and a card for fixing armor 200% you could combine the two for a card that fixes both.  Maybe call it master repairman and have it cost 5 instead of the 6 using both cards would cost.
---
It would bring a bit more variety to loadouts and maybe make end game leveling a bit more worthwhile.
---
But I've got a bloody armor piercing grenade launcher. One would think it wouldn't take 1/4 of my ammo to kill a single mob
---
Yes! Fixed the inspect at player vending machines!
---
Adding to this at the top of the monorail elevator there is a bunch of lead weights.
---
Feel free to break them 😅 I need to use up junk haha
---
Yes yes yes. Also, Marine armor needs a serious rework. Even the loading screen tips claim it's the best armor outside of PA. It's total garbage next to BOS Combat.
---
dont forget those are full upgraded max damage plasma grenades.
---
You are right but players expect a game to work correctly and this is a forum for such discussion. With that said, this game is most likely never going to work properly so it’s probably best to move on.
---
Everyone looking for 3-gold comments when I'm lucky to get just a 1-silver comment. With the new karma whore machine though, we can trade in our dignity for reddit-scrip and use that for new gilded comments!
---
It in. CLOSED ENVIROMENT of Power Armor. And getting multiple of them fighting gouls. WTF where is my breached containment I need it fixed
---
&gt;dauting
---
Fix that typo, Bethesda.  
---
Also, no change to the "Lower levels getting high-level items from the Purveyor" thing?
---
Yeah of course except it isn’t. It may change the balance except that’s not the point.
---
The “inspect” option on player vending. Sounds like it’ll be in the map view. Nice!
---
That sucks. I haven't had a bad experience yet, but I've also never accepted random invites.
---
One of the few times I accepted an invite in a nuke zone, after the other person was done farming they went to my camp. I panicked and immediately dropped the team, haha.
---
My budget was at max so he wasn't able to build anything anyways, but I wasn't sure what/how much damage he could cause while he was there
---
That may not be what you think
---
on PC about half the population does use a mic. Trouble is most are shut-in neckbeards that you wouldn't want to listen to for more than 10 minutes. The longer you play the more quality players you'll encounter.
---
I Want:
---
-the ability to build with rubble and trash (like the stuff you see everywhere in the game... knocked over desks, and filing cabinets, and piles of crap in the corner of a room)
---
-A secondary mobile tent CAMP, that allows you to set up a 2x1X1 CAMP, large enough for the tent, a cooking station, a bed, a stash. Maybe they could create a small workstation for breaking stuff down, too. You could set this up while leaving your main CAMP intact and in it's location.
---
-CHARACTER NAMES instead of player names. I know that player names need to be displayed, so do it like in ESO. Let each player decide which name they wish to be prioritized, and display both.
---
- a true survival mode... not a death match mode. a mode that puts focus on staying alive, rather than killing each other. NO FAST TRAVEL. NO PLAYERS ON MAP except for teammates. 
---
-More skins for floors and walls.
---
I’ve thought about running bolstering. But I think I want to try vanguard first. Coz if I can get my damage output over 1000 and still keep my 600dr and er then I’ll be happy. 
---
I know if I go unyeilding I can get damage output to 4000 but yeah we shall see. 
---
I will accumulate a set of bolstering and see what happens.
---
That's what I was saying in response to the person who was asking about the mallet skin
---
Few things in this thread I didn't know... i picked up healing factor few days ago sip i am going to try that on a conduit and see if i can stay alive for more than 8 seconds. 
---
What perks work best for a conduit?... lifegiver? refractor?
---
I'm confused though it could be cheating, you can't be one shotted in PvP anymore.
---
Take over a workshop at one of the 3 powerplants, it's a fusion core generator there, which need to be powered up
---
Take over one of the power plant workshops - they have fusion core generators. :3
---
lvl 54 Gutsies and lvl 46 Assaultrons are pretty tough relative to other robots. It takes 15/20 hits from a lvl 35 Troubleshooter's Handmade (89 dmg/shot) but sometimes 25/35 shots as they are pretty shallow. Gutsies have 1025 health and 110DR, Assaultrons have 1550 health adn 130DR. I have an unconfirmed theory. Their hitboxes are sloped and frontal hits do half damage outright. As others have said, try shooting the thruster on the Gutsy and the limbs on the Assaultron.
---
&gt; Floor Décor: Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop.
---
Are you serious? they should have been added as a free item for everyone due to your oversight (hell that's what everyone thought it was, a nice free item already unlocked), fucking greed.
---
Look up fo76 interactive map. You can find power armor frames that have them but they are only 25% charged. You can also find full ones in fusion core generators. Or you could also take a power plant and just use there machine to make full ones.
---
awesome, new event! I just hope they fix the bugged possum challenges
---
On PC I rarely hear ppl talk,(EU). Maybe it’s a cultural thing? Ppl are usually calm here
---
I've got all 5 ranks mate, but thanks.
---
I always use my mic and talk to people, although I keep it muted when I’m not chatting as people don’t want to listen to me slurping coffee and eating crisps lol.
---
Gonna be a blast to try out a new group event!
---
That would be the whole point of having passive cards so we don’t need to swap stuff around just quickly repair our armor or craft some damn soup. Moment to moment combat stuff should be what we are choosing for our “build” but convenience and crafting stuff is just an annoyance to switch to.
---
The best fix!
---
Yeah it's rad damage, gamma gun does full 50 damage if you take off any rad resist armor with grounded. The lead lined backpack is nice though, +90 rad resist.
---
I don't think it's a bug. I think they realized some mutations would be too op if class freak affected them so they deliberately "broke" it.
---
Then what would be the point of ever playing past level 50? If they didnt want us swapping perk cards they wouldve stuck to the old leveling system where you cant rearrange the perks youve earned. I respect your playstyle, but that is not the playstyle Bethesda intended.
---
~~on recepies~~\*
---
For PvP, all my encounters end in two shots, one from The Dragon and the other from my camera.
---
I have an AAE with armor piercing mag and it says it's only doing 144dps but I've also used a bloodied that does something to the tune of 400ish and my AAE lands kills in fewer shots. So..
---
“Please make a fix in the next hour.”  Yeah buddy hate to break it to you but if they haven’t been working on it all week, it’s too late to start now.
---
Also not gonna lie that card idea sounds awful. That’s still just a card we need to equip at some point. How would that even differ really? You’d be swapping one card instead of two then crafting then swapping back. Riveting gameplay.
---
I recieved multiple low level legendaries on my low level accounts but also recieved max levels in the same characters.
---
Isn't 25k the maximum amount of caps possible?
---
Does AA affect explosions? You are using M79 grenade launcher against heavily armored robots. If you had some kind of anti-tank grenade available it might be usable.
---
I have used several different weapons against them and fastest way to take them down is use VATS and take out arms and eyes. Same thing is for all enemies, aim for the legs to slow them down/knockdown and then go for the head.
---
Just got two shot gatling gun and from distance it's almost useless against them, but get close and they drop in less than 5 shots.
---
back stop, have you equiped the perk card to extend the cores life ? (power user,i think)
---
It was intended to be bought at the atom shop but a bug made the items already in you're inventory
---
Fantastic, thanks, I have a serum but didn’t want to down it without knowing
---
What are these fun defence options? 
---
I thought it produced ore in the  eta which is why I only ever did that event once to start it up.
---
And any suggest way to take out the scorchbeast when they pop up? Because I'm a melee character and I've just ditched that place because 3 of them showed up at once one time.
---
Nice but why ignore the mess survival is now? Not being able to defend yourself against other player's turrets is very annoying.
---
I wonder how many good things I’ve passed up because I couldn’t see the other attributes unless the owner was there. But hey, not a bother now!
---
I absolutely love the idea of mutant snapping turtles. Maybe they could be like an armored Deathclaw type thing that lurks in water and bites instead of attacking with claws? Could call it a Deathjaw as a nod to that one NPC from Honest Hearts back in NV.
---
Maybe some kind of radskunk as a new small creature? I'm picturing essentially a skunk covered in large green pustules that will spray you will radiation if you get too close; doesn't actually attack you, just irradiates you and runs.
---
I'd also definitely like some kind of mutant snake to add to the Mire, make it feel even more like a jungle. Maybe like a local water snake or something that's mutated to an enormous, anaconda-esque size, and maybe looks like a Strangler vine to help it blend in and surprise prey. Or, alternatively/additionally, it could have multiple heads and you could call it a Hydra, make it a new pseudo-cryptid like the Mega Sloth.
---
Final idea: a Snakehead fish mutant that lurks in the water systems of Appalachia, but is also quadrupedal and is semiaquatic, so it can chase its prey onto dry land. Could either be mutated snakeheads that were already in Appalachia, or they could frame it as the Chinese version of the Deathclaw experiment; a secret facility somewhere in or near Appalachia was attempting to weaponize the Snakehead fish (as its native to Asia) after witnessing how difficult it's been for people to get rid of the invasive species, resulting in a deadly new breed of postwar killing machine.
---
&gt;Weekly: Fixed an issue in which Survival Mode Weekly Challenges could be completed in Adventure Mode.
---
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
---
&gt;Floor Décor: Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop.
---
Well, it was fun while it lasted...
---
Inspect fix, finally.  This has cost me at least one sale.
---
The sneak is the crucial part, the damage boost is huge, without that you'll be wasting ammo and getting killed a lot.
---
Hush you. Lol
---
Hopefully the item inspection carries over to player to player trading as well
---
Vending: Reaching the maximum C.A.M.P. budget no longer prevents the player from assigning items to their Vending Machines.
---
Oh yes!
---
Yeah you'd think that but you'd be wrong... *-cries in 10mm-*
---
If you have high Luck you can get them as random drops from enemies. I've gotten a few 100% ones that way.
---
&gt; Floor Décor: Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop
---
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
Kill sentry bots
---
All I can say is I played the beta and when it was released for like 3 months after it nonstop because I loved it so much and then the bugs frustrated me so I quit too, came back about a week and a half ago and haven't regretted it. The main bug that pushed me away along with others was a bug that took them like 2 months to fix which was enemies' health regenerating and never being killable. That's been fixed! 
---
There's a lot of stuff to do and they've got a bunch of things lined up as well as a lot of the bugs that really caused us some anger, are fixed.
---
It’s sooo helpful, especially when farming legendaries. I would never sell mine. Hell, I want a second lol
---
Nice for stealth builds
---
I'm new here but you all are aware there is a mod called perk load out for fo76 right? Once set up you can use up to 6 loadouts for each character with one button push.
---
because Survival is still in beta and fixing things in the live version of the game is probably the priority
---
Bags of teddy bears, wasn’t actually open. He had help because it was multiple bags. I don’t think there’s a way to move things like in all the other fallouts....maybe I’m wrong. I haven’t figured it out yet
---
Wood armor being a possibility from the Purveyor's loot table is absolutely intentional (It's not paranoia if you are really being followed), and wood Armor reverting to One Star is them being short sighted, since the game was not set up to accommodate 3* wood armor in the first place.
---
It's worth it and they don't weigh much. Carry 3 or 4 backpacks and switch them out on the fly.
---
Overencumbered but need that last typewriter? Flip backpacks, grab, and fast travel home. :)
---
Right? I've been camp hoping looking for plans and mods since it started and haven't seen this yet. However, FT into a foundation is fucking ridiculous!
---
Upvoted. I can see where placing a foundation against existing terrain might be tricky for a game engine, but this kind of stuff just seems like poor programming.
---
Watoga is a great place to farm cores, though maybe not at your level.  I would stop by player vending machines. You might find a good deal on cores. Some folks charge much lower than full price.
---
99% of the time, I reject random requests. It also doesn't help that it's usually some username like XxYoloswag2005xX.
---
I think all of the masks and hoods do. :(
---
Pro tip: Stay away from other player turrets while in survival.
---
In my experience lately, when a 3* finally appears most people will get a shot in and stand back. Some will even gesture and dance around! Even complete strangers if you're lucky. I love that! That's the way it should be people!! Share the legendary items. Get all the karma.
---
I couldn't get that placement. Mine us inside the structure on a support beam.
---
Bethesda the publisher is pretty bad at everything. They just so happen to have some of the best devs in the industry under their umbrella like BGS, zenimax online, Id, etc. 
---
It has to be as frustrating from their point of view as it is from ours.

Yeah, I hate sites like that, catering to people who don't know how to play games and turning a profit. Same goes for the customers of said sites, and to them I say; Just cause u bought a god item doesn't make u good at games, infact it only serves to prove just how much you suck, ESPECIALLY in a game as easy as Fallout.
---
But Stabilized in INT....
---
If your crunched for time go to WS kill a Sentry not then server jump to lose aggro, powering up the nuclear plants can be a time consuming pain in the ass
---
The moment I built them I knew something wasn't right. I look at it as a free unintentional Atom Shop preview
---
Poseidon Power Plant
---
*If you have the fusion generator plan, don't bother doing Powering Up Poseidon, crouch, kill all enemies, take workshop, immediately build a stash and a workbench. Scrap junk. Stash. Build fusion generator. Hook up fusion core generator at plant to the fusion generator you just made (it needs 100 power and that's what the fusion generator is for - otherwise you have to do Powering Up Poseidon and can then activate it without building one)
---
Stay crouched and fast travel.
---
Go to Mt. Blair. There are 8 or 9 fusion cores around the entire area which is enormous.  Four are located right in the building with the power armor set and the abandoned train cars where the mole miners/scorched/or robots spawn. Look on YT for the rest. If Battle Bot event is active kill the sentry bot for another fusion core.
---
Then head to Welch. Kill all miners. Go down the steps from the train station, across the street littered with dead bots to where the workbench is with the ammo stash. Jump over the fence to the right of it. Right below the cliff is a dead sentry bot (one core) and three dead assaultrons (assorted goodies)
---
Crouch and slowly pan across the dirt to get different ores to smelt. There's one of every type. If you have Excavator PA you just doubled your yield.
---
Head to all the abandoned mining shafts in the area. There is usually one core in each.
---
Now crouch and fast travel to the Giant Teapot. From there, still crouched, slowly make your way down the hill to Poseidon. Enter from the back staircase. Go all the way up staying crouched and then jump off the roof down on top of the fusion core processor. Collect what's there and fast travel out of there quickly. 
---
If I see another player in the area I will toss a grenade in a different direction to distract them.
---
Remember, you're in the wasteland. You have to be sneaky.
---
All of this will net you around 15 to 16 cores.
---
If you get sniped or disconnected, switch servers and repeat.
---
handmade would be nice
---
Defending that workshop was the first time I fought a Scorchbeast. I was level 30 and my only ranged weapon was a Black Powder Pistol. It was... something.
---
Thanks for the reply, going to grab that backpack mod next, I use a bloodied build and need some rad control (the ghouls are wrecking me lol), I mainly use my gamma gun for shooting myself in the toes to get the rads where I want them after an emergency Radaway diluted but it’s an 3* Executers limb damage one so should I decide to have a go at survival mode I’d like to keep it fully functional lol
---
Glad you guys are on track with figuring out the glitched badges, Pioneer Scouts has become a big part of why I log on and having uncompletable challenges can take the wind out of my sails
---
Not that bad anymore.
---
The Gatling lost Martial Artist but the Minigun is now actually usable.
---
Not yet, eventually we'll get display shelves and they definitely had help for the individual bags lol..that's funny
---
"Addressed an exploit that could cause the high capacity backpack mod to be duplicated." 
---
I bought the mod at the vending machine, I auto learned it, and then it appeared as known in my inventory, so I gave it to a friend. 
---
Yea, I really cheated the system here... Love how they screwed up but I'm the bad guy.
---
What about paying for 3* armor from the purveyor then getting wood armor which reverts to 1*? I've lost the best part now of 1000 scrip to that. Apparently it's happening with assaultron heads too.
---
You wouldn't like to pay for a premium product to get the base model would you?
---
Really? All the broken things they could fix and this one they make a priority. Everyone has them, just let them be unlocked at this point.
---
This a real bot or a comedian??
---
The problem is when the people highlighted on the map go hide in their bases and there is nothing you can do.
---
So is the Arktos stuff instanced or is it like the burrows?
---
True never though of it in the keep the weight down sense. But i just realized we should be able to access or freezer from any stash so its a win win. Lol used to fo4 had 30 stash boxes.
---
This is correct
---
Does pemican or whatever it's called go bad? Pretty sure it's a salted meat? Is there a recipe for it?
---
I haven't had that happen in the last few days.
---
I was looking forward to this week’s gun, but there’s no way I’m going to Survival mode. I’m bad at combat
---
We don’t have apples.  cranberries and blackberries don’t have enough on their own to keep without chilling.
---
I was hoping so, thanks for putting my mind at rest, 1st beverage of the nights going to be a grounded serum 👍
---
&gt;Hallucigen Gas Grenades appear to have zero effect
---
I crafted a bunch yesterday for the Possum Challenge and threw one at a pack of Super Mutants west of Harper's Ferry. They did start shooting at each other.
---
Cat is already out of the bag on it though. So why not just introduce another item to the atom shop and let everyone keep this one?
---
Fusion cores are hard to come across early on. Mount Blair Trainyard is a good spot to server hop as it can spawn up to 3, but they decreased the spawn rate of cores in generators a while back.
---
The best way at lower levels is to take the Poseidon power plant workshop (next to Charleston Station). There's a resource extractor there that can produce 8 FCs an hour (all at full charge, unlike that 25% full crap you find in random generators). You can either do the 'Powering Up Poseidon' event there to get enough power for the generator (it requires 100), or save yourself the trouble and plop down an FC generator of your own if you have the plans to build it. There's another workshop like it at Monongah power plant in the Savage Divide, and Thunder Mountain in the Mire.
---
I'd also recommend taking that INT perk that makes your cores last longer - Power User, I think - whenever that's available to you.
---
Lastly (this goes for anyone else, too), if you're on PS4 I'm happy to lend a hand with workshops or gear or whatever. I collect PA of all levels for trade (for junk) or selling cheaply. Working on finishing up some lvl 30 and 35 suits atm.
---
On defense, all attackers start on the ground.  There are 5 (I think?) stairways leading up to the extractor.  We had a great time optimizing turrets to cover approaches, extend in-range duration via turret placement and barrier placement.  Mainly I like that there are ready-made choke points.  On traditional workshops, we have to make our own kill fields, and it's fun when it's set up, but this one is like a head start.
---
I read older threads that said it ran for an hour and produced ore.  I guess that was an update.  I've only started running it in the last week, and it's definitely scrap for 30 minutes.
---
We only had 1 scorchbeast at a time, so maybe that is updated too?  Either way, I'd suggest to build rocket turrets on one side, pull the SB there, let the turrets work, maintain the turrets, and whittle it down.  Personally I carry a .50 cal just for SB fights, really accelerates things.
---
When will it be safe to emote with camera in hand?
---
You could probably start the enclave mission at level 1 by going straight to the cave.
---
Been a while. I'll have to check what the third star was later.
---
Isn't plain sentinel better damage reduction than assassin/sentinel now, because there are 2 sets of 75% chance to avoid damage with assassin/sentinel, instead of 1 set with sentinel?
---
Thank you as always! A lot of these are on our radar for future updates, but we'll look into the full list.
---
I think they should let you display it as a small title under your name, as well as letting you change their name for a fee.
---
I'm pleasantly surprised to see there are no "balance changes" reducing the number of legendary scrips per day.

Well, judging by the state of the corpses we're finding in game... I'd say it's reasonable to say that they're only a few days old in some cases. So, it's not out of the realm of possibility that there are people out there... we just don't see them.
---
Bought the lead lined last night. Do the same, wasting diluted radaways
---
To my knowledge that never stacked, unless you had that legendary armor during the beta!
---
As long as I can shoot straight tonight I'll be happy
---
Lol it doesn’t stop ghouls from jumping out and scaring the bejesus out of me
---
Pretty sure Purveyor items are meant to be max level only.
---
Yeah, so often I cant hear what they say cause low mic or at all. Turn the ingame volums down a bit and let chat stay max, might help you. I rarely use the headset, unless playing with friends and using discord.
---
This is a great idea. Similar to the water purifier that you can craft at the chemistry station and the one you can build.
---
yes and a lot of other perk cards
---
If you did stuff during the beta it didn't count towards achievements, and alot of people never went back to redo them on alts. Thats what happened to me.
---
2-2.5 hours
---
I mentioned the same in a comment, keep loadouts changeable in perk screen only, and only changeable in train stations, [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps) and MAYBE a few seconds after fast traveling. Nothing worse than a good even popping up, and then fast traveling to it while you have crafting perks.
---
Did they address, or plan to address, the 3* wood armor changing into a 1* when you leave the server?
---
Casual shielded still not dropping—at least on consoles.  Combat dense mod not available since February.
---
No mention of fixing sneak that was broken in patch 9 (at least on PS4).
---
Text chat, Better Inventory and Perk manager are a must!
---
After that it is just QoL, but those are game changers!
---
I stopped trading a while ago, but I believe it's done either with mule alts that carry 25k caps per character or by trading multiple other god-tiers for one
---
What does the datamined handmade look like? I've missed it.
---
Developing new items isn't easy and considering Austin only has 100 employees (which in the video game scene is small). It could take alot of time.
---
yes i use power armor, just cant run. i carry way more in armor than power armor
---
so you can stay on the server and it wont give you a wanted level if you use an orbital strike on another players CAMP?
---
Well you never know. There's a melee bug that makes you miss even if the enemy is right in front of you so who knows what's next.
---
The fact we need/want perk loadouts for these kind of reason just shows how bad the perk system is right now; they need to give non combat perks a reason to be kept on or just get rid of them
---
You can’t go by the percentages, as progress made during the beta never triggered the achievements, lots of folk played constantly during the beta and missed out on certain achievements
---
I *believe* I remember getting them from the imposter 'squatch, though I remember it as seeing the notification that I had gotten some...it's been a while, and I don't run the event much now.  But I've run that a lot more than the queen, even lately.
---
I generally try not to rely on my memory these days, but that's all I have to go on :P
---
You can't. You need Sam Blackwell's entry code to get in.
---
+1 for a fishing mini-game
---
Myself i usualy have my mic set to Mute, Since i don't want people hearing my Mechanical keyboard, Or my speach impediment.
---
That's the only question i really need answered. I want to chat to people but i don't think i could bare it if i got banned.
---
also upvoted. Given the super basic stuff I've encountered trying to make a really basic (read: crude) camp, I don't want to invest time in more complicated stuff. Including DON'T MAKE STUFF TURN GREEN IF I CAN'T REALLY PLACE IT. Bethesda, new content like the scouts is cool and all, but you clearly see players invest a lot of time in camps and stores - without this the game would probably be doing much worse - so please make it a priority to make camp building just ..work.
---
Will do 👍
---
My buddy did the athletics exam, I joined him on a whim, having already done it. I figured it was just a repeatable quest, but no, as it turns out I am a low down dirty scumbag cheat exploiting the game.
---
Of course it could be a bug, but no they want to label it an exploit.
---
I’m starting to think this is BS. I’ve done campfire tales 13 times now and not once got a possum badge from it. It’s boring as hell and I don’t think I can stand listing to Ronnie McAdams sing in that annoying childish voice even one more time. I have 3 badges total from challenges, archaeologist and railway enthusiast were really quite easy
---
Very, very rarely on PC from what I have seen.  Mostly just a wave and move on.
---
please correct if wrong. reruitment blues is a requirement in both bos and enclave.surely you don't have to do it twice ?
---
I plod thru the game, no hurry, so only now doing enclave at early stages.
---
Huh, perhaps I just got very unlucky, I tested them pretty extensively and never saw anything.
---
Surely RobCo invented a vacuum sealer or food dehydrator somewhere along the line that we could use to preserve foods. I'd gladly give up a some plastic or salt in order to extend or remove the CND bar on food items I want to keep around.
---
Could've been mutant Slayer or just a random special stat upgrade. Either way, still one hell of a buy. Lol
---
Gonna be a grump here but.... 
---
Fixed the herpetologist challenge. Great. However about 5 or 6 others are either broken or completely undoable.  Van lowes taxidermy is closed and inaccessible. As are several standard challenges since the games release that are totally not completable. 
---
My main characters account is no longer playable, and several other people are having the same issue since last patch. 
---
Ghouls are attacking while laying prone on the ground or stuck frozen and don't move.
---
Bodies, usually legendary ones keep vanishing upon death.
---
Scrolling while selling stuff in vending machines is broken and will get stuck at the top of the list so you have to sell items one at a time, exiting after each one. 
---
But Hey no one gets a free cat Bush anymore! Hurrah.
---
sylvester the cat intensifies
---
You can skip almost all the Factions to do later ones, except Rose...
---
You need to complete her quests to finish the Free States Quests.

---
Vending is awesome, but on the flip side.... When I've been home the player shoppers are just a huge PITA. I've already been shouted at for "duping" because I have serums, some yutz was shouting about stimpak prices, people who buy stuff hang around and stand where you're trying to put a workbench, and one random tried to RP a begger or something. :P
---
I'm glad we have a reason to visit each other. Most CAMPs I've been to have been really nice.
---
Ffs, though, I'm not bothering to sell stuff like Stimpaks for 1 cap if I can just sell them to the vendor for more and not be harassed. :P
---
Aww, dang that typo. Thanks for pointing that out! 
---
The fix for the Purveyor giving high-level items to low level players didn't make it in time for this update, but we're currently looking to include it in another upcoming patch.
---
It's such a fun playstyle, squishing a bunch of ghoulies with melee after they are all squirming on the ground is hilariously violent :D
---
Fair enough. I never had a huge problem with it, I liked it when I played at launch. But I got a little annoyed at servers constantly being super laggy from I guess people duping and stuff. And just moving so slow all the sudden, or not being able to pick up anything and then disconnecting. There were definitely some issues but they weren’t game breaking. And there were a lot of small issues that added up over time.
---
I normally leave it on because i often forget to switch things out
---
Same. Too many headaches and things you can't rebind to other keys. Game isn't designed for mouse and keyboard and it shows.
---
Buffing a skin would make it pay to win you know
---
Tell me about it I’m a melee build too
---
Maybe they can data mine a little harder now with new skins.
---
It’s because the achievements/trophies were not retroactive to the beta period. If you did the tasks to get the achievement while in beta then you didn’t get credit it for the achievement unless you started over with a new character and redid those tasks.
---
I don’t have the trophy for leaving Vault 76 or the one for reaching level 10 but I do have the one for reaching level 50 and for winning Scorched Earth.  It looks bizarre but it’s because I didn’t restart after beta.
---
yeah i’m ps4 would be interested to see what you’ve got
---
Laser rifles with explosive prefix. I still got one. was one of the very first decent drops i got.
---
Shouldn't have fucked the last one up then. Why are you defending their right to put out bugged content consequence free? Haha
---
Me too it better not be gone. Ima be pissed
---
We do have apples... refer to my previous comment. Wasn't aware I was conversing with the owner of Smuckers...
---
Yes to enter the lift way but you can just enter the cave entrance then get the holotape to bypass the 2 Nd lift
---
im ps4 and this is just for my own camp haha
---
i don’t like to lock my camp i want people to come have a look !!
---
I mean the 2 lever action skins are pretty 🔥🔥🔥 but i would like skins for the weapons you mentioned
---
Bethesda are you aware of the many Gatling Plasma bugs? Just wondering if you know they are out there. As someone who uses it as their main weapon it's disappointing to see it so bugged.
---
Normally two ish hours, but since this isn't a "full" patch (patch 9.5) it might take less time
---
I picked up a raider dense plan from a Wendigo last week. Now if the vendors could sell dense plans/mods for ALL armor classes that'd be great.
---
Hey Bethesda - seems like you forgot to fix people traveling to vendors spawning in CAMP objects.
---
Hasn't this been fixed since a patch or two ago?
---
Great list, thanks for taking the time to put it together!
---
Varies, but usually a good couple (2-3) of hours. This means I may have to face the real world and get some sunshine lol.
---
same thing happened to me. feral ghoul blood sample disappeared and also the wolf sample now a few days ago. wrote a support ticket 2 weeks ago and only got a walkthrough of the quest. so i can not progress through the main story now for a game i paid full price for and the support is ignoring me.
---
Not instanced.
---
&gt;When Bee Swarms die, they leave behind   
---
&gt;small ant bodies  
---
&gt; (posting again now that I have screenshots)
---
Pretty sure that is intentional as they most likely took the ant model and just shrunk it down to count as bees.
---
It was fixed last patch two weeks ago.
---
It's really annoying how they nerfed the good with salt perk!
---
&gt; The “Inspect” option can now be used to view additional details about items in other players’ Vending Machines, making it easier to find that perfect Legendary for your collection.
---
This by itself is good enough to warrant its own update tbh
---
RIP
---
Kind of a small update though, but hopefully with this dungeon we get quality over quantity
---
Use conduits, no need for power-lines through windows.
---
Alright thanks
---
Ok I'm trusting you👍🏻
---
Don’t google them and don’t watch the videos?
---
Check into Casual Shielded Plans and Combat Dense mods as well.   No one on the trade subReddits has ever seen Casual Shielded Plans on console.  Ever.  Consensus is that the third tier does not drop making the fourth tier unavailable.   There have been a very small number on PC claiming to have it—I suspect Dev Room may have been the source there.  I will not buy casual underarmors from Atomic Shop until this is fixed.  Also, Combat Armor Dense mods disappeared from vendors during February patch.
---
This. Or find the plans (they are cheap, around 250c) for your own fusion generator and you can skip the event and power the processor up with your own generator. It's tedious and time consuming but you can get plenty this way and they are at 100%.
---
You're going to want the perk cards to extend your FC life as well as "batteries included" because they are 3lb each.
---
The preorder bags were the only thing that seemed downright shady and underhanded, but at the same time, the buyer should beware.  In any market, dropping money on a product that hasn't been commercially released is risky, especially if it's a limited release from a third-party contractor.  Really, game companies should not be promoting their game sales with cheap gimmicks anyway.  Thre public likes to act like they screwed over serious collectors.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  They screwed over a bunch of neckbeards who are bad with money and the bag will end up in a closet stuffed with old clothes or game systems and controllers whether it's canvas or cheap vinyl.
---
Skip all of the advice here and run Line in the Sand at Fort Defiance.
---
You'll be level 50 with a surplus of high charged cores in no time.
---
I used advanced power connectors and they go right through the wall.
---
I want 5 of them. Most of my perks are weapon reduction items.
---
No fix for melee against flying targets. . .
---
I’m hoping for deathclaws to suddenly start dropping deathclaw hides on death, musical instruments and locations where they’re played to start registering and for the plasma grenade to become a purchase-able plan from the vendorbots........ I need more scout badges lol 😂
---
Here's some images
---
Monorail elevator camp https://imgur.com/gallery/cyWMIy4
---
I built a camp on the bottom, then stairs up. Once inside I moved my camp, and started it in the structure.
---
Most difficult was getting the floors to line up with my foundation outside. Took some time, but by doing so has allowed me to put additional stairs and rooms inside.
---
Lots of spawns and some serious ones but they mostly just break my junk collector. Small squat tower outside is basically every turret I can and lots of lights to minimize that. I've not had anything actually come up the stairs inside the camp beyond other players. My vending area is right as you come in, then crafting. Over the vending is my PA station and one generator. On the other side us music, cooking, brewing and sleeping upstairs.
---
It did terrible and it lost a huge chunk of the user base early on because of it. Infact that's why it was removed. The drop rates were so horrible that a normal player was trapped in an endless yellow tiered item grind and praying to get out. Tiny upgrades were going 5-50 bucks. Good items were going what 100-1500.  Hell when you did get something useful you had to ask do i want to wear it and get better or just make a couple bucks. 
---
Fallout 76 isn't that but it does have some pretty bad rng. To the point where i did play every day for like 8 hours a day. I have received nothing useful other than 50% armor pen one/2 handers in the first month of ghoul grinding before they nerfed the hell out of it. Since then i have not seen one single explosive or any 2 shot worth using. Most of anything i have that is useful holds more ammo and adds +1 to a stat. Maybe its improved this month but i wouldn't know i only log in to see if theres any end game. Out of my 35 player list there are about 3 left. Many because of loot/ammo issues and lack of content. I can't imagine in game player cash stores doing the rng hell any justice.  Since the 15% tax would be on your sale. They probably would want the guns worth even more pricing them to comparable real life guns.  That would mark me as an uninstall.
---
Question about the lead lined mod. It says +30 carry weight. Is that in addition to the 60 carry weight of the standard backpack or replace the 60 with 30?
---
Can we all agree this is BULL  
---
.
---
Floor Décor: Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop.   
---
.  
---
You should of did the right thing and kept it free for all. Bull Shoot.
---
Yeah I think Ive got about 20 cat topiaries at my base 🤣
---
I think there is also a chance for the plant to give double the resources. I've noticed that sometimes I will get 4 of random plants during Verdant Season with Green Thumb equipped.
---
I've made it a habit to have a friend fast travel to my camp during new builds for this reason.  It's irritating that we don't have a way to control this.
---
Yeah no you really can, just outside. Check my pics above.
---
I actually use a Vampires apickaxe religiously with my melee berserker build.
---
TSE does 210 to 300 dependent on perks, radiation and health
---
AA and Instigating around 110 to 150  dependent on perks, radiation and health
---
It depends on the situation what to use:
---
for mobs the TSE (because of explosive splash damage)
---
for super mutants the AA
---
for ghouls and anything that can be one-shotted the instigating
---
Luckily people spawn into on open area since I moved my camp. However if you spawn in while the camp is being “built” into your session and you start running around you can get stuck inside a foundation. I had a guy ask me to take my foundation apart to get him out last night.  Bro you can throw a rock from Berkeley Springs and hit my Camp.  Just free travel there!
---
&gt;The “Inspect” option can now be used to view additional details about items in other players’ Vending Machines, making it easier to find that perfect Legendary for your collection.
---
Thank you the Lord thy Todd
---
THIS FUCKING GUY RIGHT HERE^^^ IS ON IT!
---
Not the first time it's been suggested; thank you for keeping the call alive!
---
I personally would settle for two - power armor and non-power armor. Hell, I'd settle for a filter or the ability to hide shit cards I don't use or want.
---
i got resolute veteran in survival mode in about 5 minutes. my advice: 1. unplug your vending machine, 2. leave all your junk in stash. 3. transport to vault 76. 4. quit to menu, 5. join on survival. 6. finish the challenge as quickly as possible (e.g. for me claim a workshop/build a turret/kill a ghoul took 5 minutes) 7. quit to menu again. 
---
i never even saw another player.
---
Any word about the [3\* wood](https://i.imgur.com/gsGys4y.jpg) items becoming [1\*](https://i.imgur.com/2pDGUH4.jpg)  ?
---
I do...religiously.
---
It's different for yourself vs other players
---
The beta screwed up cheevos.  I'm level 211 and I still don't have the level 10 trophy.
---
You can not play at their base. They'll get bored and come out eventually if you leave them alone.
---
Also a possibility. But in that case, it would be nice if they were up front and just included it on the card, like with the armor perks that specify PA isn't affected.
---
My cousin joined the Enclave before even making it to the asylum.
---
Two shits in sneak and they’re dead I don’t see why people are saying they’re tough as nails.
---
Fun fact: The US is the only nation that separated their youth scout programs between boys and girls.
---
I feel your pain!
---
I'm selling a bunch of them at my camp, I should probably test to see if they actually work before selling to people. Although I set them to like 10 caps each, not a huge loss even if they don't do anything lol
---
Sweet! Where do we get that for Xbox? Play Station?
---
No.  It was never intended to be free.
---
I've made a post about it. When you hit an enemy it sometimes makes the sound when you hit something but the enemy takes no damage.
---
Joined enclave at lvl 7 on alt still havent been to dmv yet and im a general now.

Maybe I will. Thank you for the encouragement

Exactly, I'd be much more likely to invest in my camp if everything worked okay. Hell, if everything went good straight away i would even buy stuff from the atom store to pimp my camp
---
It doubles the amount you harvest from plants. 2 without Green Thumb, 4 with.
---
Happens a lot with ghouls and players for me
---
I hope all the enemies in the event are all Cryptids. This is going to be where they were created, right?
---
When I was lower in level I used to claim a workshop at one of the power plants and drop a fusion generator to power it.  Now I just farm sentry boots at WS for them.
---
I was referring to that it should of stayed free.
---
yeah thanks i’ll add you later
---
How do you get mutant's and 2 shot?
---
The buff is intended for the raider power armor, not any skin.
---
I'm level 200. Most of my levels were gained as a side effect of farming legendaries.
---
Some challenges need other players, bad for solo...
---
They're aware of the Inspection bug, and have said a fix is coming.
---
Me too!  We're a rare breed I think.  Bird Boners unite!
---
Wait...
---
Thank you very much for the info.
---
How about carry weight perks just apply to your stash so it weighs the same either way.  That would mean that carry weight buffs eventually become passive skills, not stupid cards you have to keep moving around.  I don't mind trade offs with combat buffs and some other ability type stuff...  but things like this are really silly to have to keep managing.
---
Oh hey its you, i like your vids
---
Regardless of the controversy on this game, I picked up a used copy for 13$ just to be safe. I still believe this game is gonna be really fun to play. I believe in you, Bethesda!!!
---
It seems hit and miss, mostly teams are always chatting, or if you are trading/selling.  The line wanderers, usually just a wave and that's it.
---
I usually have my headset on, but don't chat much.
---
Long enough for me to go back to FO4 for a bit and get all confused by the different controls, only to get used to them and then go back to 76 and be all confused by the different controls.
---
But usually right around 3 hours.
---
Other people are not sneak attacking them? That bonus damage helps a bunch.
---
i literally bought the game this morning (UK time) installed it, it finished installing 10 minutes before maintenance!
---
i cry.
---
Yes, love it. Gladly trade in the 30 carry weight for extra 91 dmg resist. I do not like PA and with unyielding/bolstering armor now have dmg resistance &gt;500, which seems more than standard PA....
---
😂
---
Why are you asking for something for nothing?
---
You need the plan for “Advance Power Connectors”, there is a power pass through conduit that goes right through the wall, when you have them unlocked look for the piece that is a vertical pipe with a curved top and bottom and a conduit sticking out of it half way down, that’s the one you want.
---
Sometimes the chameleon effect won't work on players. If the armor is removed and put back on it usually fixes the problem. My team mate and I are constantly checking each other to make sure it's working.
---
I'm in the same boat.
---
Some players told me to search the corpses in the last cave of Glass Cavern for them. No luck.
---
&gt; Scrolling while selling stuff in vending machines is broken and will get stuck at the top of the list so you have to sell items one at a time, exiting after each one.
---
Just changing back and forth between a tab fixes this for me. It's a much easier work around than completely exiting the machine, and I'd rather they fix the challenges and the wood armor glitches first.
---
Some sort of mutated Feline would be awesome to... Make it that it tries to stalk you around for a while before it tries to sneak up and attack us.
---
Occasionally you’ll hear the most random things you’d never think you’d hear I heard a man running through flatwoods screaming bingo was his name O
---
Its all about the atoms
---
Wasn’t there a mat in FO4 that let you land on it when you fast traveled? That would be nice to always land where you want not off a waterfall (this happened at my old place)
---
Says on the patch notes that its coming today
---
Details on the build? Newer to the game so I’m just starting to set up my build and been looking into all variations of a melee build
---
Looks like a good update. Arkos here we come! Can I ask when we should expect firecracker whisky to be implemented/fixed?  I haven't seen any official word on the subject since it was mentioned in the inside the vault article.
---
What about the players who can’t log into the game at all? Disconnected from the server error message,when is that going to fixed.
---
yeah bro, exactly, you have 500 hours and are the perfect customer and admit that even if they decided to charge for DLC that you'd be "not happy" then buy it anyway.
---
Same thing happened to me. Although I bought it when it came out I started playing now in May... on the very day I hade commited a full evening and all.... maintenance...
---
No problem,  I was curious as to the negative effects myself (since the high capacity mod has a few negatives so I was worried)  but I bit the bullet and bought the lead lined myself. Was pleasantly surprised that the only negative was giving up 30 of the 60 lbs carry weight from the max lvl  backpack
---
Only 5 character slots.
---
You've used plans before and know they are meant to be a one-time use. If a vending machine gives you two sodas instead of one, you know very well it was only supposed to give you one. It's still stealing to take both even if you don't see it as a big deal
---
I've been having the same problem, nearly a week of Ash quests, server hoping, checking every player vendor going.
---
Nothing.
---
At this point i'd probably give every cap I have to someone who can give me this damn plan xD
---
Depending on the requirements you might not have to engage in combat.  I am PVP averse, but I have gone in a couple of times for some rewards and either did not see another player, or was able to work with  another player without either of us murdering the other.  Not sure how common that is, but it did happen.
---
I am afraid going back to FO4 now, and I love exploring Far Harbor, but the confusion....
---
Sorry, to clarify I meant those as 2 separate things. Adding skins for the armor, and buffing it (to give people incentive to actually wear it, it's the only armor I never see anymore)
---
Curious what all is still broken on it - I use it occasionally.  Mine is reloading to 281 rounds which is a weird number.
---
Nice. Well, unfortunately in this case my camp was completely built I happened to be inside when I heard the commotion, but was not in build mode.
---
Oh cool thanks for the heads up
---
Jokes on the Sun. Just bought Mutant: Year Zero :)
---
My buddy went wendingo mode this weekend. A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
---
Is van lowes closed? The sheepsquatch questline taxidermy shop in Lewisburg? I was in there last night to get the photo of the mounted cats heads (this was on XB1)
---
That's when you ask to speak to the manager and pull up their price match policy on their website.   "Look, I am asking you to follow what it says on your own Walmart website.  Pull it up for yourself:  Do a google search for Walmart Price Match Policy.  The first walmart link that comes up is likely for pricematching purchases on walmart.com but ON THAT PAGE there is a link directly to the in-store price match policy and the very first thing it says is that you pricematch walmart.com sale prices."   
---
https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#00000150-2910-d285-add2-fff8e8700000
---
I have been through this about 5 or 6 different times and they have ended up doing the price match each and every time.
---
I’ll be shocked if they reply. It’s gonna be the ol’ “policy of silence on one specific player screwing issue” here.
---
Kinda like the ominous “permanently disappearing from existence weapon glitch” that has been happening, even though some people haven’t recognized it yet.
---
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a Fox cartoon called The Simpsons destroyed the minds of an entire generation.  From there, humanity remained in a state of stupor until we assimilated with the Brain Snails in 2115.
---
I didn't pick up a new camera till after i had this problem, so I'll try that &amp; see what happens.
---
That is, if it isn't fixed w this update (though im not holding my breath)
---
Yeah the purveyor glitches are pretty bad as well. The tab thing never worked for me. And oddly it only does it on the vending machines with weapons and armor. I have one that's exclusively plans and it doesn't do it. 
---
Just wish they had addressed more major bugs in this patch.
---
Really? I've never been able to get 4 of any plant, even with green thumb. I guess I've been very unlucky with the seasons
---
That mid eye seems to be a more consistent weak spot IMO. When gun-fu switches from a humanoid target with a head, to gutsies, it defaults to the mid-eye.
---
They emailed me about my ticket and said look out for the next patch for a fix, regarding not being able to log in. So where’s the fix. Like not being able to actually play the game isn’t important.
---
Yeah I miss 90% or more of them. Way to fast!
---
In my  experience (on PC), vast majority do not talk. This game badly needs text chat. I'm currently playing Division 2, and it's like night and day, just having the text chat and clan support built in, as well as zone chat. Makes doing literally everything that isn't solo so much easier. 
---
Not everyone has a mic, not everyone has the ability to yak away (playing late nights, with thin walls). I'm honestly kinda shocked Fallout 76 and Anthem developers still need this explained to them, in 2019.
---
That is good to know that that it’s sometimes empty, sometimes friendly. I’m afraid of being sniper out of nowhere, all of the time
---
that's...... that's it?  How about fixing the social menu FFS
---
How well does it work? I would think vampire's on a slow melee weapon is not very helpful
---
The fix for this didn't make it in time for Patch 9.5, but we're currently planning to address it in another upcoming update.
---
I'm wondering this also after 1000+ hours you would think I'd have found it by now.
---
the only issue with that is if they pick the locks they get a wanted status
---
Don't forget to store not scrap when you move your base!
---
Just using all the health regen perks, theres some for during day, while irradiated, whenever you revive someone, then I'm using the melee perks for my wep, nerd rage, armor penatration perk, and extra damage when you're irradiated. 
---
The pickaxe or really any health regen wepon that's melee really sets it off, I also use a 3 star meat hook that has extra damage while I'm mutated...safe to say I have 8 mutations idk if it stacks but if it does I get more benefits.
---
It's not like you're getting punished for their mistake. People got it for free, now they can't. Even if they take away the ones already built, no one has lost anything they put any time or resources into gaining. They made a programming mistake and at the least everyone got to have these topiaries for a couple weeks for free. 
---
Just because everyone thought there was a nice little gift in the atom shop doesn't mean they are entitled to have it. It wasn't intended for that.
---
Can't you use the back of a brick wall for the same effect?
---
Have a target range at your base for example?
---
I think the weapon switch bringing you out of stealth has been around for a while, maybe launch. It's always a surprise when I forget about it and get mobbed unexpectedly. 
---
In my experience, switching to all ultra-light armor with shadowed material has made the most difference for reliable stealth.
---
Wendigo mode?
---
My impression is that Dandy Boys contains apples but was more of a candied apple which should impact their ability to be used as a pectin source. 
---
Do we know what tarberries are IRL?  They could be a source
---
hmmm, I sold 50 inert flux for 1 cap each and I got 45 caps after tax
---
I didn't. Im simply in favor of their being consequences for their mistakes that aren't just pushed down to the consumer. They wrote the bad code and prevented these from being sold in the atomic shop. They should own the consequences. Who the fuck cares about these specific items anyway? To devote development time in this release to moving such a trivial item back behind a pay wall is a mismanagement of resources and shows us what their priorities are.
---
If it walks like a duck, has the ammunition class of a duck, then it should have been under the ducking weapons workbench.
---
You can straight to Blackwell's bunker and do the quest. I finished it and launched a nuke by level 13. I skipped literally every other quest to do this (now I'm level 100+ and still haven't been to Morgantown airport)
---
That mat existed in this game during the BETA. And it was removed.
---
Is there a download file?
---
Dunno why they'd remove that prefix from lasers. Makes perfect sense in the fallout world that SOMEONE would modify a beam focuser or something to make it cause things to go boom
---
Heeeee
---
(im dyslexic)
---
Let me double check when the servers come back up but I think I’ve got the plans
---
Can you elaborate?
---
At The Poseidon energy u can make full ones
---
I don’t understand. Her power armor was trapped in your structure?
---
Oh almost forgot about how fast travel was also broken in patch 9
---
Yup. I thought "well, I guess I'll build one of these before they take it away!" Even if they take my little cat away, it's all good. Doesn't really fit my CAMP anyway, it was fun while it lasted.
---
No more photo yeets
---
Years ago whenever I tried to get back into WOW for some reason I always picked patch Tuesday to do it.
---
good info, thank you!
---
Wait, so it adds 30 carry weight to the 60 on the standard backpack? So you have total of 90 carry weight and 90 rad res?
---
Boys outs will be accepting girls now(soon?), so one organization is getting with the times
---
Still debating on waiting for bethesda to say yes you can use mods at your own risk or just install them and wait for a ban wave...
---
No, they released a statement that it was intended to match player level so items are usable right away.
---
* Collecting recipes/mods. 
---
* Exploring the world to find new and interesting places to stick my camp
---
* Attempting to roleplay my character with other players
---
* Hunting down the random encounters that occur
---
And I am hunting legendaries as well - but I'm not expecting to have unlimited chances to turn a bunch of bad legendaries into another chance at a good one.
---
Nah, that's just a very small bug :)
---
They did fix +1 dmg you got for free on Apparel items, good one, that was really bugging me, now i don't need to worrie about being over protected in the wasteland , hahaha :D
---
Been having this problem A LOT lately, AGAIN.
---
Cat is out of the bag? I see what you did there.
---
I bought it properly, and wouldn’t care if people got it for free.
---
Does it take longer to find the ground or close the game and reload?
---
i know they're not all that simple, but just trying to help people get over the fear of dying. i put ~1200hrs into fo4 without dying. came into this game and had to realize that respawning is just a thing that happens. it's fine. 
---
i see my kids play games where they die every minute and respawn. they're totally comfortable with it. i'm trying really hard to adjust my mentality; i put way too much mental effort into avoiding dying in games.
---
You know i didnt think about carrying multiple to switch around just to fast travel. Lol i kinds feel dumb. In that case I'm gonna invest in the all.
---
I see it as a gift. It gave me two.
---
If I smashed the vending machine and took what I wanted, that's stealing. If it gifts me an extra, lucky day. Besides, even if I had the inclination, how would I return the second? Shove it back up the shoot? Call Todd on his cell?
---
Eggszachary
---
Lots of people do and that's the problem. These people are profiting from duping. None of thier items say limited supply or only 1 availible. Duping is way too easy to profit off of.
---
What happens when there's a knee jerk reaction to this? How far will they go? TSE's used to be the most OP weapon in the game Assassins Sentinal could be nerfed further they could do a game reset who knows but it'll be bad....
---
You don't have to do it twice.
---
hmm, I'm trying to liquidate an explosive + reload 250DR black powder rifle...
---
So it is started. Good. I'm still in my workplace, then I go a bit of shopping, then walk our dogs, like every day.
---
I'll start update the game before the walk, and hopefully, the maintance will end when we arrive home.
---
Exactly😂😂😂😂
---
&gt; Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 5.5 GB for consoles and under 1 GB for PC.
---
They are hiding something from those that would datamine. Somebody get in them consoles.
---
You overly sensitive shits. Will your little feelings not be hurt if they called it and exploitable bug instead? FFS it's not like they attacked you in the patch notes and said you were all evil for experiencing a bug. 
---
&gt; but no, as it turns out I am a low down dirty scumbag cheat exploiting the game.
---
Literally no one said that until you did. Guilty conscience much?
---
Worked fine for me on PC over the weekend to get a pic of the cat heads. Not sure what the others who say it's closed are experiencing.
---
Oh I didn’t know that! They should have left it I loved those in FO4.
---
Whilst I totally agree about skins for the handmade and stuff, I also love my shiny lever action skin and the chrome skin for my explosive minigun.
---
Their official stance is that your game might not work properly. The only people who got banned used CheatEngine, not mods.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Helmeted_cage_armor_%28Fallout_76%29
---
Was it datamined though? I feel like I could do without new emotes, or princess beds, and give me some weapons and armor from FO4.
---
I'm still trying to find raider armor plans myself - I keep hearing they drop in the savage divide from events, quests, and treasure maps but nothing as of yet.
---
On xbox, already downloading.
---
I wouldn't count on that without first trying it out. There were some changes that were not mentioned in the last release notes. Food is rotting faster. I am constantly consuming water to such a degree along with all of the other people I play with are constantly looking for wood to make 60-70 boiled water, or our camps have 10 purifiers.
---
It is a very good game overall.
---
Why aren't the cores reloading to round numbers?  And I thought they used to be at 500 per core?
---
I've visited it 4 times, and server hopped each time and it still reads "inaccessible". I know this glitch doesn't effect everyone, or all the time but it's very frustrating. I'm on xbox as well..
---
Wanting that hunters hood right about now from FO4 haha
---
Or let my ice cooler stash reduce spoil rate :)
---
Another time there were 4 different players racing though from levels 3 - 5 and it was so funny as each was wanted and trying to take out the others as I had made it clear there was only 1 goodie bag at the end. 
---
Everyone was in tears with laughter trying to get through and deny the others.
---
As i type this I cant help but want to build another now 😁
---
It's sheer madness. But I really wanna finish my complete mid-century restoration of Sanctuary, so what's a Wastelander to do?
---
Also yeah, Fah Hahbah is the best. I grew up in Maine and I really miss it. It's like going home again. Same with New Vegas, as I used to live in the desert in New Mexico and it's insanely similar.
---
Bro, I’m a girl.  And bro, you may have high karma and occasionally have a post suggesting in game content go hot but I know a boaster when I see one.  And instead of addressing a previous argument, focus on the one I just did.  Bro I’m genuinely asking you a question. Bro.
---
&gt; You can normally one hit colonial gutsy
---
Now I want a Colonial Gutsy that goes around in a tricorn hat firing a black powder gun that it has to reload with its other two arms. Maybe some versions with revolutionary swords too.
---
Whats your platform?
---
I've got a couple for sale in my machine.  1c per % of charge.  I think the ones I have in there now are about 60%
---
Get the batteries included perk when it comes up.  It will drop the weight of cores to as low as 0.3.
---
there is a consumption usage perk as well, but I dont think you get that until L50.
---
At L31, you should start the Excavator quest and venture into the ash heap.  There are several PA spawn there, including one area with two right across the street from each other.
---
Do you know where all the PA spawn points are located?  
---
Most of those have a 25% core. There are well over a dozen in the forest alone.
---
 Any fusion generator may also have a core - and several locations have more than 1 generator.
---
Check out camden. 
---
Theres 2 generators, 1 PA spawn, completing the event there drops a core, and there may be another one loose in an ammo box.
---
Since you  are walking everywhere, it may take a couple of sessions, but on a good day, this route can yield over 20 cores, (without PvP, which you will likely get if you take posiedon) And of course, higher level PA:
---
&gt;!Wavy willards, Grafton steel, grafton dam, penetentary. west gorge bridge, pharama, WV lumber, camden, nuka plant, wade airport, poseidon, mining HQ building in charleston. !&lt; 
---
Five of those places are usually filled with super mutants, so you'll get some good XP, gunpowder, screws, caps, and more than a couple of levels while you are at it.
---
As an aside, with some decent DR armor, you may find you dont need to be in PA full time (yet).
---
&gt;Exploit:  
---
&gt; Addressed an exploit that could cause the High Capacity Backpack mod to become duplicated.
---
 You must return here with a shrubbery... or else you will never pass through this wood...   alive.
---
Thank you for my first Silver random Redditor.
---
Yeah I got my email today, just told me to wait while they get around to it. I know it's not affecting many people at the moment but I was hoping this patch would address it as well.
---
“Enjoy the abundance!”
---
I know it's probably a question that you can't answer, but just in case you can....
---
Should we hold onto our 3 star wood items? If there's a fix will they regain their attributes? Or have they completely reverted to being rubbish and we should just grind them?
---
The only down side of that is getting it lined up with everything else in the room you're wiring. Grid snapping would be amazing here.
---
Again, really quick to patch the things that benefit the player. Really slow, if ever, to take care of the things that don't.
---
....that's an amazing idea. Why have I never thought of that?! It *is* bugged though.
---
*sigh* Gonna get downvoted for this from die hards, but...the tired statement really is true. That show show was pure amazing comedy bliss - for seasons 3 through 7. But it’s been crap ever since.
---
I usually run with a full party plus a few extras on mic, we use the console party system as a team is usually only 4 and we can fit 8 in a party. I play with chill people that all get along
---
I expect we'll probably get one more update for camp decorations and general bug fixes, and then it'll be over. Nuclear Winter will probably start around BE3, probably after but possibly during, we'll see.
---
I've joined the Enclave at level five, just go to the waste dump and get the code then head to the Whitespring.
---
Was a bug when game came out where going out of power armor made your body look similar to a wendingo
---
My skirt gets bunched up showing my fufu, when exiting a workbench, very embarrassing.
---
Please fix or I'm suing for sexual discrimination.
---
I love the power conduits over wire.  However, be aware that they take up slightly more camp budget than the wall connectors and wires.  
---
Place the power conduits before you place your wall.  
---
I use them on the outside public areas to make the facade look nice and to run across flooring but I replaced them on the back side with wires to make a bit of budget room for vending. 
---
Also, the set has “power radiators”.  These put power to a section like a wall but also light up.   For example, I ran one across outside steps to a foundation outside my building to power up the Welcome Home neon sign on an attached wall.
---
We're supposed to get Possum Badges for completing those events? I haven't received any badges at all except for doing the challenges. I've completed S&amp;T and Op Tidy at least twice apiece, and Campfire Tales about a half-dozen to 10 times, no badges of either Tadpole or Possum level received.
---
Maybe I don't know what "promoted to the Possum rank" means. I did all the things in the Tadpole quest and now I have been working on several Possum challenges (completed about 6 of them). Am I "Possum rank"? Do I need to talk to a bot to get officially christened or something?

Campfire event is great for acid, sometimes you can bring home ~300 acid from one event. If you are at the event solo, you can make it last longer by not rushing the goals. Every time you meet the goal the timer gets more time on it. So just stall and farm, every bloodbug is 2 acid.
---
I run unstable isotope and it’s useless on anything but players
---
It shouldnt be.  I see them constantly for 3-5k.  Just be patient and don't overpay.
---
I’ve had about 5 emails as the first one was just basically no help whatsoever. The last email said it was top priority and look out for the next patch. Peed off is an understatement.
---
"Let me use a 6month old video to highlight a glitch" - Let me just say I've not seen anyone using this and I go into PvP all the time, y'sure they're not just using Secret Agent + Stealthboy MK IIIs?   
---
ER/DR doesn't mean shit and never has and that's obvious to everyone with a braincell since the new things called "Perk Cards" yknow, kind of go off of %s rather than actual figures, infact the more DR/ER you have the more damage they're doing, who'd of guessed? Having Sent/Cav/Ass/Mutants pieces are  the only way you'll survive in PvP and if you don't like it that sucks, learn how to PvP some. Tesla rifles can be beat if you use your brain and tactics (i.e. range the fucker).  
---
Also you're wrong with Serendipity, it only mitigates the instance which procs it, I have literally thousands of clips on my HDD where I die and when I respawn it shows it proc'd during the barrage of bullets. This just sounds like the moronic ranting of some kid who has 0 idea of how to PvP properly and instead of looking into it with some intelligence he relies on screaming "EXPLOITS, BROKEN GAME MECHANICS, HACKS, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE".
---
Where is the metal dense mod? Has that ever been available?
---
Ah yes had that happen as well, kind of funny though
---
Nice! I didn’t know that. Proboscis??
---
It's true, now you can emote while holding the camera and sitting too, so it's even better.
---
whats shrouded effect
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Hey, you got me. I only know what I have experienced myself.
---
I wonder if crafted cores are subject to the same "repair to 150%" (etc) rules that crafted armor/weapons/etc are. Maybe someone who can make a 200% weapon can make a core with 500 shots?
---
Grind them. They've said outright that they won't be fixing it. Further, the game lacks the admin tools to address this, so far as I'm aware.
---
I'm hoping we dont have to wait to long lol. I've enjoyed the pace they have had lately. I hope they keep things rolling fast like this 👍
---
They're RNG drops.
---
If they they started banning mod users, then almost half of the PC players would get banned. I'm sure they wouldn't want to lose half of the community on PC.
---
You say its broken but will you be saying it after (Spoiler Warning) &gt;!Battle Royale mode comes out? It looks like we bringing our character builds since some of the new perks are related to this new mode so we might be bringing our weapons and armor too. (Sarcasm)!&lt;
---
This is another BIG bug that was overlooked.
---
Like refrigeration mod, it takes 30 away from the +60 vanilla pack. So +30 total. The high capacity is +120 weight total with -60dr -60er.
---
Only ones I have.
---
I've only done the imposter event once, and that's a memory I'd just as soon forget :)
---
In general, though, you have my co-commiseration on the memory thing...
---
Are you on PC and live south of Twin Lakes? If so I think I've been there, and our bases overlap territory.

Until they reduce the penalty to High Cap.... Its only use is last ditch fast travel crutch after overstocking on mats/legendaries for the purveyor. :'(
---
Just don't forget to switch it back to Armor or even Standard before you get back into fighting.
---
No.  Build your own.  Leave mine alone.  If my missile turrets can't handle the crapheads that spawn near my camp, so be it.  Purified water is not hard to come by.   Why do you think you are entitled to raiding things at my camp if I don't want you to?
---
Yeah i guess you are right , i just don't want the ban hammer after playing so many hours. You know typical sneaky bethesda.

Nice! The last time I used it to find imposters body &amp; before I could loot her I tried to motion everyone over with an emote then boom, I was sent into the abyss that is disconnection lol
---
The freaking "Junkie" bullshit stat on weapons. Fuck that..
---
Did they fix it where the generators consumed the cores you have to craft?  That’s the only reason I only did it once.  I ended up spending more resources having to recraft the cores than I got out of the extractor.
---
Best comment is best at getting off topic
---
Why aren't you considering renovations? You can pretty much make a basement. The teleport spot is where you place the actual camp item
---
It is rare but I have seen them personally.
---
Well to be fair you can be sniped out of the blue and you should expect it to happen at some point since it is survival mode, but unless you are stalking one of the top three or hanging around an area where snipers likely to congregate for easy kills or walk blindly about it is not a major risk. I claimed a workshop for a good twenty minutes and no one came to contest it, and I expected that to be like throwing chum in shark infested waters.  Maybe I just got lucky, not sure as that was my second time out.  Good luck.
---
I love that their solution is just "play another character"
---
I've put 400 hours and 160 plus levels into grinding out my perfect character and base, but hey just start over. No thanks.
---
Not really there are still a few things worth buying for caps like flux.... so you know how much fluorescent flux I need to feed my lmg
---
On the Topiaries - It would have been a nice mea culpa / power move to just release the topiaries free after letting the community use them for (2? Weeks) as a “for the fans” move.  
---
If they want to keep the current pricing tier - the game needs a big injection of variety for non-atom-decorations/objects and atom-store-variants.
---
FWIW IMHO - the raider stuff was a great example of this - though for those watching I’d caution you at excessive fragmentation because it gets old fast.
---
There’s tons of pack-ins in-game that should be workshopp’d and I can only imagine people similar to myself would pay through the nose for “clean versions”.
---
For those who are skin/deco hungry - this kinda stuff rubs the wrong way.
---
Not sure why this got downvoted lol, nuclear winters starts in june, and E3 is june 11th, perfect timing to announce it all and start it off
---
&gt; I don't get it they have to know these store exist. They're violating the ToS it can't be that hard to ban these people from the game. So what's the hold up why wouldn't they go after these people? 
---
Stores aren't violating any of the ToS, the players are. So there is nothing you can do against stores. There is no law saying that I cannot make website, that has listed virtual items with prices. I don't even have to have game to do that, means I haven't accepted any of the ToS of the game. At most they can DMCA website for using images, but that process is bs, does little and webmaster can just replace those images with some placeholder image.
---
And to do something against user, you first have to buy the item to prove that user is involved in RMT. Even if you buy the item, you buy item for 25 $ while game costs 15$, the user still wins. You see, there is no point for Bethesda fight with these player, because they don't have any massive playerbase that they would care about. You can see that from the content they release- They don't care about players who have been since release, because they already got your money. The new player &gt; old player for them and new player, he doesn't care about dupe glitches and RMT. By the time he becomes aware of those things, his game had depleted. He is already playing something else.
---
To shut down these stores, start from the game design. You change design in away, it is not profitable for them to do RMT. It is totally understandable from player who buys for real money perspective. I mean look the game, it favors RnG. To gain something in F76, it is smarter to go play RS, get gold there, sell it to RMT, Use that money to buy F76 items via RMT.
---
Beta starters never got or will receive many of the first Xbox achievements unless they create a new character on the same account. Many didn’t register early on.
---
Nah Im on Xbox. I have a shrine to Mr. Pebbles with all the cats gathered around it lol
---
No feelings of guilt at all. But too many times they have found a bug then decided to call it an exploit. People who exploit this game can get banned. So, naturally, myself and others don't like the fact that something we have done completely innocently is now being called an exploit, or a cheat. Where as other things that have more nefarious connotations get called bugs.
---
My reaction is more about Bethesda's inconsistency and the fact that they seem not to know the difference between a bug and an exploit. I doubt anyone was redoing any of the athletics tests to game the system and stock up on poor rewards, if anything they may have redone them for fun (looking at you Sunny Top Lanes athletic course)
---
If Bethesda are going to call things like this exploits, then by definition they are calling anyone who experienced this BUG an exploiter. Again, these are the people Bethesda has been known to ban. So I, and I am sure others, would prefer some clarification on what is a bug and what is an exploit. 
---
I'm not being sensitive, I'm being cautious.
---
But but the pvp hype train every game developer wants and soon we will be forced to (Spoiler ahead on next dlc) &gt;!play Battle Royale to unlock game content since the location where we access is like the enclave and playing the new mode unlocks new areas(You can see this is the case with audio files telling us we can't enter yet similar to what modus does till we unlock various rooms of the enclave).!&lt;
---
yup, same on my PC, but my Xbox updated :/
---
No. It just cripples limbs 50% faster. 50% limb damage does not increase overall damage.
---
It's scheduled for summer release, so I'm thinking 2nd or 3rd week of June. First day of summer is June 21st, just a thought though.
---
I spent all my time fast traveling around to shops. This kill camp crap has slowed that waaay down. I don’t trust anybody anymore. I carry too much junk I don’t want to lose.
---
Mines started on PS4, about 5-10 minutes ago.
---
Did nobody see the refrigeration plan that can be added to your backpack? 🤓
---
I found one a couple days ago at the train yard near white springs train station.
---
In reality ... it might be a myth /s
---
Yeah I’m plus 400 hours but only level 118. I’ve bought stuff in the shop and spent ages building my camp. Just finished the possum badge challenges to get bigger backpack. I have started a new character but I’ve lost interest now.
---
My xbox update is downloading ok.
---
Same here...
---
Is unusual in my experience, previous updates they 'opened the floodgates' shortly after taking the servers down.
---
So you already went in ahead of all of us and confirmed that nothing else was fixed?
---
You don't have to power them up. If you claim the workshop you can build your own fusion generator and power the fusion core generator
---
Good god. The shit he was getting for drops made me cry.
---
I run bloodied and typically do 2-3 of the conduits without any issues. Lol someone's salty about doing no damage. No one shoots at the invisible assaultron pointlessly, they shoot the other 500 robots around trying not to die. Why are you so salty about builds that are good?
---
Farm nuke zones and make flux then have super duper on to make cores!
---
I talk to people, especially during trades.  Usually talk about good deals we've found, our best drops, annoying people we've been dealing with,  positives and negatives of the game.  As an introvert, its hard for me, but when people click that mic over and say "what's up man," I put my bigboy pants on and make a friend 😂
---
It is a draw back definitely but il take anything over dangly wires lol
---
Xbox is updating 4.9something gb
---
Perhaps that’s why my auto laser is MIA after Friday night. Just gone. (I favourite things so I don’t accidentally scrap)
---
Play updates and watches have to be submitted to Microsoft and sony for approval before going live, and the certification takes days.
---
This would be fantastic!
---
3* Rolling pin, chef hat, and swim suit
---
Ah ok. I never think about when summer actually starts. Its already in the high 90s where I live 😆
---
76 wasn't even the first open in the game yet alone lore. also most tke place about 100-200 years after
---
Maybe some things are just easier and quicker to fix than others?
---
Top tip, cheers I didn't think to do that.
---
Cut your losses, Bethesda. If they're removed from your CAMP as well I'm going to lose it
---
I only play survival. Everytime I see them say they fixed the one shot kills they most definitely have not.
---
I’m not sure if it’s the first to open but it’s an early one. The fallout games take place over a wide range of time. Fallout 3 and 4 take place nearly 200 years after 76.
---
On the other hand, can we buff all those shitty weapons so not only 10% are viable?
---
You can remove the wall to wire the conduit, and it just snaps back in place.
---
Yes! FO4 had so much more selection when it comes top armor combos.
---
Ooooo... so the "bush" cat was Atom only? I have one, sitting on the roof...
---
Will it be deleted?
---
Jeez, I live in New Hampshire and its usually in the 60s this time of year. Yesterday got up to 84, I was not prepared lol.
---
Oh most def. I really enjoy fallout 76 but the lack of outfit options is a bother
---
Those were our original builds.
---
Purified water is literally one of the easiest resources to come by.   Build a whole bunch of small water purifiers and a nuclear generator.     Go take one of many workshops that have water and place down multiple large / medium water purifiers.   Put your camp on a location with water and you can get 90+ water without even trying.   Early in the game I was emptying out vendors by selling excess purified water.   Literally all you have to do is DO SOMETHING about it and you'll have all the purified water you could want.   Can't build a nuclear generator?  Go do the powering up a power plant event anywhere from 1 to 5 times and you'll get it.  Each time you do the event you get a new power plan that you don't have.  Learn that plan and the next time you do the event, you'll get a different one.  Can't build water purifiers?  Yeah right.  How long have you been playing this game?  You literally only have to do the main story line quests near the beginning to unlock some and I'm pretty sure they are readily available for sale.
---
Stop being an entitled Douchey-McDoucherton.  If you want help making purifiers, move your camp to a location that has water and get someone to help you.   You don't get rewards just for fast traveling to someone's camp.
---
I team up all the time, sometimes to help a low level or for an anchor to the server during events. Ive was throwing random invites when I got free range. I have never even considered someone jumping to my base and doing anything malicious.
---
other fo's are set in future.
---
you might find dead bodys in fo76 from another vault tho.
---
somebody will pipe up with more exact times and dates
---
I sell high quality, fully guaranteed, Appalachia made, 100% capacity fusion cores in my vending machine [PS4].   PSN:  IceFire_DH
---
I also stock Nuclear Launch cards.  
---
I’ll be online tonight after 7:00 pm eastern.
---
Got mine from daily tadpole quest on two different occasions, talking about quest where you clean up gunk from areas near grafton.
---
Can't find it anymore, honestly I don't even remember what it looked like. It was leaked a long time ago, I think back in late March
---
Why thank you I’m just doing my best to be an evil bastard 😁
---
Same. One person’s “Hyuck hyuck that’s hi-larious!!1!” is another person’s annoying hassle.
---
At least the ones in the silos are weaker
---
I did this a lot when I first started the game. Basically took the power plants and hemlock holes and then did nothing but defense quests and ran the Earth Mover. Tons of exp and loot. Now that I'm 600+ hours in it isn't worth my time (easier ways to get everything that you can obtain there), and I got really annoyed at things attacking and getting stuck inside of those giant wheels so I couldn't kill them and the defense quest would fail. I wish it gave more scrap.
---
Ofc I am. Only fucking idiots don't use adrenal reaction. You don't even need to be super low hp for it to tremendously increase your damage. You can sit at a comfortable 50% hp, which if you built your character properly leaves you very tanky, and do tons of damage. The only mob that gives me any trouble tanking at 50% hp is the ISS, but that's also because I'm usually running 2 or 3 of the conduits as well.
---
God I'll love some wall skins
---
BE3 in particular is on June 9th, but yea it lines up.
---
Patch Notes didn't mention a lot of issues being fixed to be fair on them.
---
Cool looking ones atleast
---
My XBox update has completely finished, but the servers are still down for maintenance anyway.
---
I'm still put off by the "fixing" of feed the people. You would have to be a real asshole to not see how that is actually a cool reward for all on the server. It was hurting nothing.
---
... that does not invalidate what the guy just said. I still like to name my characters so I know which one is which.
---
Game breaking bugs that need patching? Nah
---
A small oversight that prevents us getting a little more money? Patch that asap.
---
Pure fucking greed, I hope people boycott the Topiary items, can't give something away for free (intended or not is irrelevant) and then take it away and start charging for it.
---
Oh ok that makes sense
---
Everything looks good except you need to change those rifleman cards for commando :)
---
They can use the f-ing hand pump if they are that thirsty.  Or, I don't know... bring their own water.  It's not like water is hard to come by in this game.   It takes about a minute to have 50 boiled water if your camp isn't in a completely stupid place or if you take a workshop that has water as a resources.... or if you literally notice ANY of the water in streams, lakes, ponds, puddles, etc and then fast travel back to your camp.   It isn't that hard.
---
wow the things that happen in the wasteland!  
---
good thinking to have to open a window to see the code!
---
i swear the best innovations and discoveries are made when people think outside the box
---
Oh no doubt. I've come to despise exposed wires even outside (but that's a necessity unless you build on perfectly flat land). I love the power radiators in the set, too. I can power my outside lights with no worries.
---
More than likely to be future dungeons. 76 was one of the VERY few vaults that did what they said they would. The rest experimented heavily on the residents. I wouldn’t expect Vault Tec to have another legitimate vault nearby.
---
I'm not sure about the layout of the PSN, but the QoL of the map is really sucks in PC when it's crowded in the event sites( like this: https://imgur.com/JIX0iXq ), you will often sent Team request, or sometime you are a bit in hurry, maybe other buttons as well, I later found you need to hover vertical for better 'chance' to actual hovered to your target btw, the one designed the map codes must never saw so many people in one location I wonder
---
Will there be a cool down on the new event similar to the imposter event?
---
Put a workbench nearby where they get stuck, they can get out that way.
---
Even closer, basically the first week of june pretty much
---
that sounds great! these are the stories that make this game great for me
---
Pemmican would be a nice option.  That was actually dried meat and tallow or fat.  Sometimes berries added (though berries reduced its considerable shelf life some).  But in truth pemmican can go bad, it’s just usually so long to do so that it doesn’t matter.
---
So, if you load your stash to the limit *with* the perk equipped, and then you unequip it, does your stash literally *explode?*
---
I didn't even realize it wasn't supposed to be like that, I sold it in my vending machine for 5000 caps
---
One thing that you didn't mention is the need for ignition cores. 5 of them. I attempted this a few times at lower levels and never had enough materials to build all 5 and I have never once actually found one (although allegedly you can..somewhere). 
---
So make sure you have lots of nuclear material (5 for each) and lead (5 for each) available. 
---
Luckily they are no longer treated as scrap and won't break down when you scrap junk like they used to.
---
I have started making a few here and there and if I see someone low level owning Mt Blair, I'll go there and give them some. It took a few attempts and updates before i was able to do it the first time.
---
This is ignoring the fact that the defend the workshop event is a pain due to the sheer size of the area and number of invaders and that you must own the workshop in order to start the quest.
---
Well shoot, there it is. Glad to know I’m not imagining things.
---
Bethesda has come a long way with their FPS mechanics, but they could use a lesson on melee hitboxes. That’s super frustrating. What good is reading an enemy’s tell if they’re guaranteed to hit you?
---
Exactly!
---
Maybe it was bugged for me but I never was able to play the event again.
---
Still no download on pc as yet.
---
*insert Benny Hill music*
---
My guess would be that any kind of bug that allows a net gain for the character is automatically considered an exploit - not that everyone who experienced the bug was exploiting it, but the fact that it can be exploited makes it an exploit. Everything else is a bug that causes some sort of negative or unintended impact on the game.
---
I wasn't a fan of the skulls on sticks they added to the shop recently, they just look so fake. Like someone would put outside their house at halloween. Give me the heads on spikes and other assorted impaled bodies any day.
---
To be honest carrying any rifle over 10 pounds long term sucks.... average assault rifle runs between 6 to 8 pounds in real life
---
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'd love some more performance and stability improvements. Neither of the ones listed above sound related to the choppy/stuttery gameplay problems I've been having increasingly since the Free Range patch. (I may not know the correct word for it, basically micro freezes where the screen freezes and the game is unresponsive to button presses when doing things like changing weapons.) There are also various crashing issues people have been having when doing things like entering indoor areas, if you search past recent posts here.
---
My skirt gets bunched up showing my ding dong when exiting a workbench, so it discriminates against everyone equally.
---
(oxymoron intended)
---
i dont use auto's i use lever action rifle's
---
Because I'll freely give away / drop what ever I can to help someone, but when I get back to my camp and I want to craft 50 adhesive or make any kind of chem, I want my purified water to be available to me, first.  I'll gladly give away excess to anyone that wants it.  
---
Also, early game I sold the crap out of purified water.   Every day I could empty multiple vendors of their caps from the excess purified water I had on hand.   I'm not level 300... so it wasn't me that you saw, but I did have a bunch of water purifiers in a pond...  like maybe 13 of the large ones.
---
I m using almost exactly the same build but i traded what you are using in str for melee so I can switch. I m a bloodied one also, mole gauntlet and lever.
---
Agree, it was nice they fixed the problem that it ate people's weapons and armor but should of left it feeding everyone on the server.
---
At least we have a new one that does it, I keep getting corpse flower stemens for no reason
---
For a non-auto rifle, don't need 3pts action boy and then adding 3pts grim reapers sprint is redundant.
---
I see this like every 10mins of traveling. I haven't seen it in the early days of F76 tho, so I think it's a bug added from an update.
---
If you are on PC, I have multiple fusion cores for sale in my vendor store. IGN: pokerplayr
---
I will be back on later in the day, around 2-3 pm EDT.
---
it's usually 90 in Sacramento about this time, but it was 60 today
---
Oh. I see.
---
Call it hardcore mode! Same restrictions of survival.
---
Hey there...
---
Very entertaining and informative. Two deathclaws up!
---
Get Class Freak.  It helps a ton.
---
Sorry no, I worded that awkward.
---
The max lvl standard back pack gives you + 60 carry weight. The led mod is -30lbs and +90 rad resist.  So when added it leaves you with  a backpack that has +30 carry weight and +90 rad resist. hope that is clearer 😊
---
Yes, you are Possum rank if you are doing the challenges now. The drops from the repeatable quests are random as the other poster stated. I have run campfire tales 4 times and gotten 1. My wife has done it around 10 and gotten 1.
---
What happens if say, I only have 250 caps and I say "Will buy Stimpak's for 11caps!", you have 300 so why not, and try to sell me 50 for 550 caps. 
---
I don't have the cash but the sale bugs and goes through, I'm now at zero caps and can't fast travel, and you're pissed at me because I've stolen your caps/Stimpaks. 
---
Or as your selling them to me, I'm at a vendor spending my caps. We both press "Buy/Sell" at roughly the same time, and both you and the vendor want 500 caps off me, and I only have 750 to my name. 
---
Or someone hates me, and you try to unload all 300 on me at one time (for 3300 caps) and I only wanted to buy a few! Now I'm down 3300 caps and stuck with 300 Stimpaks. 
---
We would need it to be regulated, like so we can set it to "Will buy 10 Stimpaks at 11 caps each." But how does the 10 Stimpaks reset, is it per person? Could 100 people sell me 10 Stimpaks? 
---
I agree it's a good idea but they would need to look at all the bugs and potential issues with it.
---
Ford once gave away some cars for free by mistake, does that mean they should give them away forever?
---
(No Ford comments, that's cheating)
---
I feel like they intended to have the normal double name plates but because it was rushed they left it on the back burner.
---
&gt;Character name
---
&gt; Player handle
---
Yep,  but you can see the contrail in the darkness.  Just neat to see.
---
This happened to me once. It was a surprise, but a welcome one.
---
Possible. I sometimes get upto 6 pieces of wood scraps with no perk equiped.
---
Can they not just allow wood armour to be 3* like all the other armour? Like, check the box for Wood that all the other armour has checked in relation to multiple legendary stars? Or uncheck wood armour from generating from 2 or 3 star armour pieces in the Purveyors shop. I know I'm just a lowly consumer, but is it really that complicated for the creators of the actual game code?
---
I loved the cat one :-(. Funny how they can't or won't fix bugs that have been around for ages, like the stealth bug that I'm still getting, but they can remove two camp items just to earn a bit of extra cash. Lol
---
Ok i think understand
---
I'm a lazy reader!
---
**Not sure if this has been answered yet.**
---
Here goes... In the Display settings. There is:  
---
**Crosshair:** On / Off  
---
 **General subtitles:** ***On / Off***  
---
 **Show floating markers:** On / Off  
---
 **Show active effects on HUD:** ***All / Disabled / Detrimental***  
---
 **HUD opacity:** ***Slider (0-100 in increments of 5)***
---
/reminds me of the maze in the parking garage in Fallout 4
---
Ah, okay. Thanks for clarification. 👍
---
Oof. Didn't know that.
---
I talk to other's in-game in about half of my play session. I hear other people talking in about 90% of my play session. Very rarely do I hear other people's background noise, as we have push-to-talk. On PC in NA.
---
Hmm, interesting.  You can definitely see the second shot fly thru the air tho.
---
Yeah i might buy that, but if you think they get the same attention you are naive.
---
Yea. I checked all tabs about 4 times... even jump servers to see if that would trigger it!
---
I did some running around looking last night but it was getting late (for an old man like me) so I just logged...
---
The only thing I can think of is when I got in there was another player right next to me... he might have gotten to the body right after me and grabbed the camera? Not sure if they are shared loot... and if they are if having the quest would unlock them in other containers for me or if I have to find another tourist..
---
if i got rid of grim reaper where would i put the 3 points in
---
You sensed the improvements
---
Easy to prevent, just stop aging.
---
It's too late for me, but you get on that while you still have a chance!
---
If you're on PC, use the fusion core map from the mod that I put together: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313
---
Well, its different teams who work on different issues. If the people working on the atom shop have to just make one item inaccessible, compared to other devs who have to fix an entire camp system, what will get done first?
---
Like I said, I don’t care. Just don’t understand it when they had vending machines and they were near vault 76. They didn’t have any plants to make adhesive either so. It’s whatever. Just stating what I’ve saw someone do and it was confusing.
---
Low levels hiding in the event is lame, but not all &lt;50 players are useless in a SBQ battle. I was in 3 SBQ fights before I hit 50. I am a healer main, so I dont do much to the SBQ but I run around healing up, and reviving teammates. I still dont do much to the SBQ post 50 but I burn through stimpaks and keep my team alive.
---
If you have conduits and cables inside your camp I don’t buy anything. Sorry not sorry.
---
use the barn or warehouse windows. they are wider and easier. put the wire through then turn the window back to the desired wall
---
you know you can just create a 2nd character to enjoy melee with, you dont need to make it a "us vs them" thing
---
dont be jelly!
---
When you tore down your last camp, did you store things rather than scrap them? If yes, then yes this affects your budget. You can use those stored things by selected the stored section when you are in build mode. You can also scrap them so you get components from them, and then your build budget will increase. Hope this helps!
---
That means mine is a bargain at 6969 caps.  ;p
---
Well, it certainly hurt me when I was fleeing a flock of enemies and suddenly the game put 5 cans of unwanted stew in my carefully managed inventory making me overweight and, five seconds later, dead. It hurt people, just not many people. Also, herbivore-mutants have no need for those cans. 
---
However, there is a solution. When the event is up, simply participate! That way you will get the reward!
---
Just started loading 8.48 GB for PC, so bit more than under 1 GB
---
Better start updating
---
How did sneak break?
---
This could not agree more. Way to much complaining
---
I am not taking one more step in survival mode until The leader board is gone.
---
I’ve done the power up event enough now that I can do it in 10 to 15 minutes.  Of course, I’m now a high level player so that helps.  
---
But yeah, it easily took 30 to 40 minutes when I first started doing them.  It’s a time sink early on.   Especially when you don’t know your way around the plant.  Those things were pure mazes for me starting out...
---
Why wouldn't they just bring back the mat that allowed you to set the spawn location in CAMPS which was in the beta, but got removed for whatever reason. I feel like that would help a lot with that.
---
Yep, my main (lvl 180) is still unplayable as well. It’s now been 2 full weeks since I’ve played because of this. I ended up starting a 4th character but honestly I’m going back to Apex until/if this gets fixed.
---
I have gotten Hallucigen gas grenades to frenzy enemies but the radius it does it at is tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiny. It may have been further broken since then, but at some points I have successfully triggered frenzy between enemies.
---
Marsupial mutation doesn't work while you are under the effect of Rad-X. I tested this many times with the same result. The patch notes don't say anything about this so I guess its still not resolved.
---
I was going to say the same thing. They're more focused on bugs that would lose them atoms/money than bugs that have been in there for a while.
---
Salt Pork? West Virginia?
---
Not just ore though, I found game also drain bulked materials without any warnings
---
Yep.
---
But I'm interested in a way where I don't lose carry capacity.
---
oo good point
---
You monster! I want to see these pics. (Also commenting on this so I can save it for later when Im on a computer that doesn't block discord, really hyped to see this build)
---
25k for any weapons that is close to TSE or above, because the market is so fragmented. Just finding such weapon is already worth that money. Market price (outside the game forums) for TSE is basically 16k on PC, but because vending is such RnG and Server hopping, while money have so little value, 25k is totally fine price. I would list it even more than 25k, if it was available.
---
Ya it shoots 2 projectiles one at 100% one at 25% damage they’re just randomly inside your hip fire box
---
Loss of friends family job health. Don’t do drugs buddy.
---
I'm beyond that point point where ya want to start counting backwards....
---
Who said regression was a bad thing? :)
---
You can also build a two piece conduit on the floor and then put a wall right over top :)
---
I happily enjoy the wiffle bat skin. 
---
And the lever action.
---
It's usually -1 charisma.  Maybe -1 perception too?
---
And there we go, random dude on internet who earlier tried to insult me, gives a better definition than Bethesda have yet to do. 
---
I have plenty of reason to feel jaded and frustrated with Bethesda. 1100 hours in this game means I have seen every bug you can imagine and seen them endless times. I've put up with a LOT of shit because I enjoy the game concept and playing it with buddies. I do like the direction the game is going and there are vast improvements, but if Bethesda could just communicate better, things might be less frustrating. Their communication has improved from the early days of '76 but realistically still has a long way to go.
---
I'd certainly be likely to see if they have a vendor camp up and running and see if they have anything I want to buy. 
---
Also, I like fixing people's camps when I come across them busted up.   Though, I'd like to leave them a burning paper bag of fertilizer as my calling card because life is confusing like that.
---
It's showing as 8 gig for me on PC...
---
Wow... the download started on my side, and it is for 8.5Go en PC.
---
Not a big deal for me since I am on very high speed fiber broadband but that seems a bit higher than the advertised 1go...
---
It would be great to display your created character name. Then when you select and view profile it shows your gamer tag.
---
Is there a fix for the finding Grafton Dam bug yet? I know some of those finding challenges are bugged but I don't see anything listed here, it's a major problem and a lot of us are owed those 40 atoms considering it's been like 6 months.
---
Yeah. Fortunately I had control of the workshop, so I built a weapons workbench to repair it mid-fight. Fortunately it can't reach you when you're hiding inside the excavator, so it was a dance of jumping out to take potshots, and sneaking back in to reload.
---
I realize now that if I had tried to fight it in the open, it would have at least landed once or twice for me to start melee'ing it. But this was also during the era of never-ending screech attacks, so I would have been toast if I had done that.
---
 Vault 94 open one year after the war. And 111 within a few months to a year or so. I’m pretty sure some one the west coast had short term stays.
---
So what did they “fix” this time?
---
You shouldn't lump everybody into all those groups. 
---
I wanted a survival unrestricted pvp mode but nothing like what they gave us.
---
The attackers spreading out and getting stuck in weird shit ruins the place for me. I'll stick to hard farming my mats and getting ~300-500 of whatever I need in 10-15 minutes rather than dealing with that buggy mess of a workshop. Plenty of other workshops that work much better for farming defense quests.
---
possible, it was level 20. One of the first three stars I ever got. And if I had it during the beta there's a good chance I hadn't maxxed out the perk yet either
---

Here’s mine. He’s a commando monster that doesn’t need Bloodied weapons to melt anyone.
---
Try waiting 1-2 seconds after grabbing the wire. I’ve found that if you move right after grabbing the wire you’ll always jump.
---
Ahaha oops I made my username random bullcrap.
---
Or just spawn people just outside the CAMP's boundaries on solid ground even.  The mats would be nice though.
---
Then this is not a stealth commando build, it's a stealth sniper/rifleman build.
---
You realise the servers, server personnel and developers all cost money, right? Without income the game is dead. It is not greed, it is maintenance costs.
---
Wished i'd get a buff from addictions in real life
---
Double post
---
The real vault tec experiment is that fallout 76 doesn't actually exist, except for you.
---
They are not a myth I have the plan along with like 200 other random plans I got it out of a savage divide event
---
Yeah all weight reduced caps at 90%
---
I use high carry backpack and only downside is i now must use more radaways = i have even more space :D
---
This was the effective grind in Ark, and it worked.
---
Raw Meat -&gt; time in preserving bin w/ sparkpowder + oil -&gt; jerky
---
Your point doesn't make sense either way, pistols are vastly weaker than the other weapons in perks and in damage. You either go with pistols and have No armor penetration perks, and low/No adrenaline or you use a rifle and have full Adrenaline + Armor penetration.
---
same here.. 8.48
---
I’ve had occasions where a piece of my power armor got added to my inventory instead of staying on the frame.  
---
I’ve also done things like the Monster Mash at Watoga High where my helmets gets removed to wear the hat.  
---
So it is possible to accidentally scrap a piece that ended up in your inventory instead of on you frame.
---
They did reply to this bug down below
---
Yup.
---
It's played Ark from alpha to live then stopped.
---
You don’t have to fight ppl in survival dawg
---
Damn, that sucks. I have read about people needing to replace one they dropped or scrapped and they found them in those other places so hopefully it is the same for you. Just remember it has to be the broken pro.
---
Thank you.  I thought so but my first review of my history didnt show both.  I deleted the other post.
---
They have confirmed that the 3* wood armor and assaultron helm were not fixed in this patch - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/braydy/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_95_notes_may_21/eobwk6s/
---
There was no mention of melee against flying mobs fixed, they have claimed several times that legendaries always drop but people have posted videos of it not heppening.
---
As of patch 9 you can't move the Hero of the Wasteland statue - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bovokp/unable_to_scrap_iron_hero_of_the_wasteland_statue/
---
These are just a few things that either were not fixed or not mentioned in this patch.
---
Most likely after E3, betting they will release the detailed roadmap for Nuclear Winter during the E3.
---
You didn't saw that you didn't care.  You said that you didn't understand.  I shared a couple reasons why they might do that.  With that much purified water, they likely login and every day they generate enough purified water to sell 1400 caps worth pretty easily, I imagine.
---
Also, I just notice the part about people threatening you / your camp.  That's bullshit.   There are some idiots in the game that think they are entitled to use everything other people make.  That is absolute garbage level idiocy.
---
PC 8.48Gb
---
I think it's a resolution thing. I get it on my laptop but not my desktop
---
Is privacy a concern people have in 76? Pardon my ignorance, I'm pretty new. I love poking around people's houses and taking photographs of nice details. It never occurred to me that some folks don't want me in their house. I'm not going to read their diaries or look at their web history...
---
My stomach gets bigger the worse my video game addiction get. Is that the same thing?
---
And that's bullshit, honestly.  Deathclaws should be the apex predator with the exception of a boss type fight.  They need buffed, or the freaking death bears nerfed.
---
There is also a bug where the weapon fires to the top left of the screen.
---
Server hopping whitespring over and over for many play sessions in the early days of the game, before any nerfs to xp
---
are there patch notes up already?
---
Lol? Damn you're salty. Stop bitching about powerful builds just because you don't want to run one. Even if it does get nerfed, low hp builds are still going to be the strongest way to run unless new mutations are added. Why? Because unless they remove adrenal reaction it will literally always outclass everything due to adrenal reactions damage multiplier.
---
Also they'll never bring it in line with other builds. It's meant to be glass cannon, the very nature of bloodied is risk/reward. You don't have the balls to risk anything, don't put your anger and jealousy on people who do.
---
I only had 5GB left on my SSD, but instead of saying "you need 8GB" it said i needed 62.8GB of space. ¬_¬
---
I uninstalled Sekrio and it's updating fine now.
---
Is the nuka girl outfit fixed? Tired of seeing that scar.
---
Your content is on fleek, big ups!
---
Ooo I didn’t know that, great tip 👍
---
Loos of friends, possible loss of job, blood shot eyes (withdrawl symptoms), inability to perform at night.
---
Or look here:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations
---
They did.  That limited period ends right now and lasted the last 2 weeks.  An announcement ahead of this change could have been a courteous move tho
---
...I think maybe bethesda need to work on thier maths. 
---
Actually canned the DL for now since that sounds worrying like the size of patch 8(?) on console..
---
...anything that is below TSE, is basically trash. Getting 16k, not that hard to collect. Then why bother buying something like just TS or E, go right to the best. In normally games, yes you buy something that is mediocre weapon and use that, because you get faster money if you do bit more damage, but that is not the case in F76. Because in F76, RnG &gt; Gear
---
👍
---
I auto-ignore all of them. I don’t want my base destroyed.
---
That's supposed to happen...
---
Also any chance you on xbox? So you can show me which one you at that allows you to put foundation on it? Really bored of this game and need a cool camping spot to keep me into this game because these daily atom challenges are becoming nothing but an annoyance instead of keeping me playing this game.
---
One shotting things from stealth isn't dangerous at all. A chimp could do it.
---
If you consider getting fat a buff then yes
---
The different notes and data in terminals says as much. Complaints about poor run times and running it at half power to run longer lol
---
Sounds like you moved too fast for your connection - has happened to jumping with marsupial between buildings while my connection was crappy
---
How much though ? the less than one gig they said it would be, or the 8.48 ?
---
I like this idea!
---
K, thanks. I was trying to figure out how I was going to get enough badges to get multiple backpack mods if I only had a finite number of challenges that gave badges as rewards (and that number was less than the total number of badges needed for all the mods). :)
---
No controller, but I remember lags during the whole session...
---
This is really annoying and frustrating
---
When is the disappearing from Team glitch on PS4 going to be fixed? ITs really hard to play a multiplayer game when you have to keep re-adding people to the team because the world keeps kicking them off your team
---
I'm afraid I'm on PS4, but to let you know, this is right next to that green workshop to the south, and is the second to last ring before the rail breaks, as it is the only one that let's you only just reach the ground when your camp is placed inside the ring!
---
yeah they dont mess around with ATOM store stuff, they are ON IT asap
---
but melee has been actually broken for about 2 weeks now and the reply i got was "we dont have a set timeframe but are aware of the issues"
---
I love this game, but its not a good look for the game when they ignore persistent bugs so they can patch up issues with the ATOM store the same day
---
That was just the first one to come to mind.  I'm sure there would be other combinations that would be useful for combat builds.  Maybe combining the regular, expert, and master version of cards into once card.  Maybe have cards that increase the damage of a weapon and decrease the weight.  Then having an extra slot or two for other cards that could benefit you.
---
but hey, fuck me for trying to come up with something new.
---
Yes - but I do discord on my phone
---
I'm having an issue where my explosive Gatling gun no longer does damage to targets. It was taking enemies down to 1%, but then not killing them. No it appears it does not do any damage at all. Anyone else encounter this? It's really hindering me since that is my main weapon.
---
-60 RR is just silly. :(
---
Try flipping like I mentioned. :)
---
Possibly duped? Why would you think it's duped?
---
They said "under 1 GB for PC" in patch notes. Weird.
---
Since you do this event often I was wondering have you ever received the plasma grenade plan from this event? I've been trying to narrow down which events in the ash heap actually reward the plasma grenade plan
---
xAynalDestroya666x
---
Dude get the fuck out of here and grow up.
---
it doesnt bother me,I don't even have full walls and doors in some of my camps, especially my tree house builds (since mobs open doors anyway...) but I have heard many a mention on Reddit that people don't want trespassers.
---
Showing as 8.48GB for me
---
I figure some of that will overwrite existing stuff.
---
I was worried because the download hadn't started yet for me, normally it happens right as they close the servers. I guess maybe everybody else's downloads are in queue.
---
Since I work from home, I better get my work done before the DL starts, or try to explain why my remote desktop session is lagging... :)
---
&gt;Loads of scrap.
---
When you say "loads of scrap", what do you mean? Because if it's less than two thousand per half hour it's not as efficient as my current scrapping/mining route.
---
That's pretty much whats worrying me.
---
The Stimpak Diffuser should be available soon for medic builds. Keep that in mind.
---
If it works like normal Stimpaks: get Chemist, Pharmacist, First Aid... Quack Doctor in a pinch.
---
It was to be expected honestly and I shouldn't blame them for that.
---
But on the other hand I was expecting that it won't be fixed. 
---
After all atom prices are crazy. It's like I can have a single power armor skin or Factorio in which I've spend over 1000 hours :U
---
Woo! I don’t have to use a rubber band on my controller to go afk at my camp anymore!!!
---
mutations?  He was looking for addictions........
---
Once you meet certain damage threshholds (which is easy btw) you don't need armor pen. If you're running a vats/sneak build it's pretty easy to get to the damage numbers you need to ignore armor without having armor pen. You only need ~1200 damage post modifiers to do full damage even on the highest DR target in the game the SBQ. If you can't hit that with a crit or sneak then you're building wrong.
---
Makes sense. Too many acronyms these days :p
---
Sadly I think explosives are best used on lightly armored things like ghouls and scorched infantry.
---
The anti-armor legendary effect does'nt seem to work on splash damage (or energy damage :| )
---
... hope this is patched eventually.
---
For a gutsy try something that has anti armor perks, ... incisor, stabilized , or tank-killer, and perforating / stinging magazines, and aim for the thruster / weapons. 
---
A shotgun won't do good damage, but with enforcer perk maxed is good for disabling their pop-gun quickly, after which they are neutered.
---
Are you giving adequate time for things to load in properly? I'm on xbox as well and since patch 9 it takes in excess of 5+ minuets for everything to load into the server appropriately. Sometimes even more if there are a large number of vendors in the server.
---
No argument from me there! I had a chuckle at your inventory comment 😁
---
Isn't it fun how they have hidden them in misc tab with weight of 0.1 each. 
---
After I found this I started destroying them whenever I accumulated over 10. Still prefer the workbench and 200% repair over this.
---
Let's hope not!
---
So Melee is still @#$@%#%@ broken????
---
but of course they fixed the ATOM store giving players free topiary items
---
goddamn it bethesda you are breaking my heart
---
Thanks for the heads up, also you using only one foundation? Asking since a pic partially came through then stopped when I tried using phone, checking because with last patch foundations can attach to another one even if floating mid air thanks to change in camp system where as long as first foundation touches dirt then any foundation can connect to it.
---
that makes sense
---
tah!
---
No electric chair?
---
Heavies, shotguns, tse’s/aae’s same drill.
---
Melee, furious +Swingspeed
---
Most of the time people just nuke to have the prime site just barely inside the radius of the blast zone. So people without power armor or hazmats can join in, So you’ll be seeing a lot of bloodied builds(rifles/heavies/melee) joining in as well.
---
If you’ve tried logging out and back in again and it still doesn’t highlight, you may be SOL. 
---
Can you connect another pillar on top of it? Just curious
---
[deleted]
---
I have one and havent had any problems ever, on ps4
---
I'd been seeing them more consistently even before they added the higher-leveled ones. Keep at it.
---
Is there a gauss rifle paint?
---
I did the musician badge, and the trick is to wait long enough to become well-tuned for it to register...
---
Oh damnit I’m PS4 but seriously you camp building skills are better then mine I mean I think my camp pretty good but yours is far beyond it
---
You can try to add a piece on it and then see if you can move it as whole to another location.
---
If that doesn't work then move camp and lose all the work you have have done on it.
---
I guess having a loadout to use shotguns and a loadout to switch to for heavy weapons would be worthless.  Or maybe one to switch to melee weapons if you come across a great legendary weapon.
---
It doesn't have to be focused on crafting.
---
That's intentional. Rad X suppresses mutations my man.
---
most of it will overwrite existing files..
---
I started with a ground foundation, but have replaced it with a sky one as two points in the ring count as dirt for foundations!
---
MELEE IS STILL BROKEN
---
Well no, I wont buy most things in the atom shop as they are too expensive, thats just that, I wont buy repair kits because they are P2W and I dont like that, when I say "super" P2W I mean when I can feel the effects of other people buying advantages over me, it ruins the game and becomes unfun.  
---
I wont squander my money away on useless shit, but If I feel its worth buying I will buy it (the war rider P/A skin for instance) then theres shit I wont spend money on (vault tec themed weapon bench and separately vault tec themed armor bench)  
---
I am an OK consumer, I will buy things I think are worthy of spending money on, If I feel im getting ripped off then I wont buy it, the perfect consumers are the youtubers who buy everything to show off to everybody what you can buy and make vids on it, so they'll even buy shit just to say its shit.  
---
To sum it up with me personally, I'll avoid buying atoms as much as I can  
---
If I feel something is actually worth buying I will pay for it  
---
I will not buy P2W items, simply on the moral grounds that they ruin games and ive seen loads of games that would be really cool, but are instead F2P and P2W when they would be better off as a one off big price. (war thunder for example, the grind put me off after a while because its supposed to be P2W, but otherwise a great game)
---
Melee is still broken
---
I’d look for a high rate of fire weapon, a handmade or 10mm smg or .45 tommy gun, with medic, +50% crit damage, and vats meter fills 15% faster. The tesla is not ideal, low rate of fire and low ammo capacity.
---
It's an 8.48 GB download for me on PC I have no idea why
---
Do you know how many camps I've visited on the sides or mountains or their peaks? 
---
Yeah, no thanks. I'd rather glitch myself out of the problem.
---
There's a lot they do that have no mention in the notes. Usually nerfing though.
---
I know I've seen it, it's tiny, like a glowing mushroom
---
As a Gen Z myself, I have a *crippling* Tide pod addiction which often causes me to yeet right into traffic.
---
second build

---
Hey a legit response!! Ty!!!
---
Hairstyles ARE way more important and the new ones are sick for raider characters !
---
My launcher also says 8.48 GB. 
---
Unfortunately for me that means 10 hours to download.
---
only seen it once, during the beta no less ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯
---
That's pretty much why I said on solid ground lol!
---
Good to see they addressed SOME of the bugged scout badges, but surprised they didn't make it to the Possum badges. There are lot of them still bugged to the point of broken, so I'm hoping that gets addressed in the next patch. Until then, I guess I'll just server hop over and over looking for possum badges via daily event... at least it's forward progress I guess!
---
&gt; **Floor Décor:** Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop. 
---
oh, so that was a bug? glad i already put up 2 of them, lol 
---
what do we need to add to the custom.ini for those of us who use mods?
---
It gives you a buff when traversing cold biomes.
---
 [u/Valseek](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valseek/)  Can we get some official word on if the patch notes were wrong or if PC users are currently all downloading the wrong patch ?
---
Let’s hope for their own public relations sake that fixing the topiary so it’s only unlockable through the atom shop is accompanied by them being free through the atom shop at a later date (when they were meant to be scheduled) like the orange carpet and alarm clock.
---
With my main char, I randomly do it, but he does not need Sweet Rolls to max carisma. He already has all the perks, stuff and buffs to get best prices from vendors.
---
Sweet Rolls are only usefull for fresh char, with no easy way to max charisma yet. and a fresh char has better things to do that to look for the recipe first, then to go to find the 20 ingredients to craft a single piece of food that it spoils fast. 
---
In resume, for me this is a bad design deciision (recursive, btw): to make an ítem, that is usefull only for fresh characters, but veteran characters can handle in areasonable way.
---
hahahah yes i get that too, very unlady like !
---
There is plenty you can do.... stealth, mini nukes, grenades, snipe the turrets, etc....
---
Why would someone show others how to dupe if they want to sell their dupes?
---
Dupers aren't very bright.
---
Same in that regard.  I typically add people as friends that have cool bases (and good prices).
---
I paid full price in 2018 for a game that is a copy of a 2015 game. How's that for income?
---
This update was more focused on project paradise than a huge bug fix
---
I really expected to read the legendary vendor will no longer sell 3 star legendary items that are capped at one or two stars leaving you with an item that will automatically lose a star upon reloading completely wasting your precious scrip
---
Just saw this comment now, I ended up tearing up the foundations on my camp for a few reasons (ocd) but I can show you a few tricks tonight, I should be available around 9pm central time till hopefully earlier than 3am (really need to sleep earlier but i was full ocd at the time), my reddit name is my psn name  
---
Will likely be rebuilding my base for another hour or 2 at least :D
---
Not interested in debating with you, i am too old and just don’t care....your point is taken though. Thanks for the comments.
---
Peace :)
---
This is my [favorite build I've done I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaK66vwqfJw), let me know if you think its any good, and would like to see your take on a county jail style build
---
That's cool. My character now has realized that he wants to become a sniper
---
I was disappointed by that. My character looks incredibly weird without his beard.
---
1200 damage isn't reachable unless you use a single type of build, which is bloodied/Low health builds. Having only one build that even comes close to the same damage is a terrible, terrible thing in a game. Build diversity is important and makes the game feel like you actually have options. Imagine a DPS in any other game doing 10x higher than every other DPS class.
---
Yeah dude an even easier way to be invulnerable: don't get hit. Or don't participate in combat. I'm smart /s
---
My 50 cal explosive machine gun takes them down quickly as does my furious sledge, though I take a ton of damage with the sledge if there are more than one of them.  
---
I try to save the 50 cal for QSB and sheepsquatch events as it eats bullets like candy. 
---
I still prefer sniping them with my 50 cal anti-armor TSE hunting rifle.  Taking them out from distance and in cover is the best option. 
---
And yes, all of them were drops...   but I hardly ever see any good Vanguard armor, go figure...
---
Maybe you just have the wrong weapons...   grin...
---
1) Click "YouTube" in the lower right to open video in YouTube window.
---
2) Once there click the three dots below the video to the right next to "Save" and choose "Open Transcript"
---
You get the entire transcript.
---
Again, I'd rather glitch myself out of the situation rather than traverse a mountain to get to said camp.
---
Perhaps they shouldn't be releasing new stuff that brings new bugs when the existing bugs haven't been fixed (some even from release)
---
\*wooden armor, almost every time.
---
Because it could be abused to trap players inside of a camp. Which can already happen with the current spawning mechanics, so if Bethesda fixes this it'll probably be by moving the spawn point to outside the camp's build radius
---
Best fix would to be remove wood armor from her loot pool.
---
I have been trying for these plans for the last couple months without luck. Been running Battle Bot every time it pops up and some others in the Ash but no luck. (PS4 as well)
---
I've got a lot to burn lol. But it is kinda nice to just repair on the fly especially my BE Laser rifle. That thing is like glass
---
You think Bethesda is strapped for cash? Lol
---
Still a thing you should do during the SBQ fight then
---
I mean major bugs. I still see a few little ones that aren't so annoying or game breaking.
---
its like 8.45gb update  for pc
---
Yeah, I'm super salty they didn't fix ALL the badge challenges. It seems like while they're in there it would make sense to address the others and have that whole part of their bug list checked off. \*drinks glass of internet tears\*
---
Yeah, I figured that's why you mentioned somewhere dark to shoot lol.
---
Thank you for finally explaining what the fuck has been happening. Swear it seems I can get diseased from across the room in whitesprings.
---
Me too, post first character at least. Once my buddy and I made toons and used a random number generator to decide what we were going to make the toons. I made my toon before the roll happened so I didn't know what I was going to get. Named the toon Rando Calrissian. 
---
I got heavy gunner (at the height of everyone complaining about how weak it is) and he got shotgun (at the height of it being the strongest build). I don't regret anything, had my foot in the door for heavy gunner OP train before it started and with the change to addictions my [explosive minigun](https://i.imgur.com/wYaxlYz.png) is actually strong AF.
---
But.... fast travelling really needed to be fixed, like really very broken 😢 otherwise good job!
---
I'm also on ps4 i teied that once i didnt work for me
---
Can people please stop using wooden foundations? It’s 90% of my problems
---
huh, that would make sense
---
maybe we're all idiots not grinding the daily tadpole quests
---
That is an annoying issue. I got an awesome Ghoul Slayers one that deals 10% more damage when aiming, and it shreds ghouls at Whitespring, but it runs out of ammo so damn fast!
---
No you can't damage the camps in survival anymore...
---
Well you know that would only make me get the Behemoth to trash your camp for me right? Call me vindictive but I think there a certain accomplishment kiting a deathclaw to someone camp and then using line of sight and proximity to get them to trash a persons camp.
---
There's food dehydrators in the game already.  They'd have to be enlarged or part of a new "kitchenette" workstation, I would think.
---
Theres a post exactly like this one 3 times per day
---
Its not just your gun, all auto fire weapons can possibly trigger this.  Happens a lot with tesla rifles too.  Basically the server is lagging, stops taking client side inputs and then tells your client no I don't agree, that guy is still at full health so it makes it look like enemies are healing.  The server simply never registers the hits.
---
Seems to trigger a lot when there's more client side hit notifications sent to the server (explosive weapons, especially auto fire or arcing weapons like the tesla trigger this condition a lot).  I find that burst firing helps (auto tesla, explosive handmade) but that's not a good option for heavy weapons like the gatling or 50 cal.
---
How long till the servers are back up?
---
Rubber band the controller
---
 **Why do you play this game?** Its incredibly fun and the steady stream of bug fixes and content keeps me engrossed.  
---
 **How much has been improved upon since launch?** Every single aspect of the game, just google it.
---
I skip bear arms and just find the guns with reduce weight 90%. I know it doesn’t work for mods.  But not a lot of mods for the heavy guns.  I feel BE Heavy Guns are better than BE shotguns of last patch...
---
Did you actually complete the Possum badges, or did you grind the repeatable events? Most of the possum challenges are bugged for me (Musician for instance.) If so, which ones did you complete?
---
Ikr, except raiders’ weapons look exactly like everyone else’s. Weapons have little character in a shooting/action game.
---
Can I come stay with you? My Fiance and I were out in Arizona in February, and we traveled from Tuscon up to the Grand Canyon. We pretty much stopped at every park possible. Beautiful state...
---
hate to tell you, but unless youve copyed to another disc,everything is exactly where it was,before you started, on the disc itself.
---
tring to think,why did you want to ?
---
&gt; gamer tag.
---
Someone plays on console.
---
Since when?
---
Man, that's such comfort weather, I'm jealous.
---
It's improved quite a bit as far as bugs and server disconnects. 
---
However,  if you have a bad internet connection,  it's not going to help. It's purely ocelot,  the better your internet,  the better the game performance.

&gt;Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 5.5 GB for consoles and under 1 GB for PC.

Oh dang, well once I get done with work in 6.5 hrs Im heading to a computer to actually see those photos, going to have fun making a new camp!
---
„under 1 GB for PC“ 
---
okay then why the fuck is my launcher downloading 9GB right now??
---
I just sold a bunch of cores in my vendor yesterday. I don't use PA hardly at all anymore.
---
My guess would be Julyish.
---
hahahahaha
---
Naawh, 390lbs is my love, i would die for her.
---
Yep, already tried that. 
---
And yes, i can add another pillar on top if it. (the reverse is how it got there in the first place)
---
Faster reload
---
You’re welcome. It’s a nice time to come back, theres a couple of cool new events. Particularly the backpack quest for extra carry weight and legendary purveyor. It’s a bit easier to get good legendary items now because of that, and also fun to check out other players vending machines.
---
Have there been any other seasons so far?
---
Reload speed of course
---
It's not hot enough yet.
---
That would ideal too
---
i’ll let you know if i’m around :)
---
You can see them [here](https://imgur.com/a/8VDV0ai).
---
If you couldn't play before then you probably couldn't handle it now to be honest. While the problems aren't as bad as at launch, server side dc and lag is still a thing as well as broken quests. There's new events, quests, and player vending. However, if you are only coming back for content then you will probably become bored very quickly because the new quest lines aren't very long and the scout's challenges are filled with arduous tasks such as milking brahmin. I've found that the main player base is composed of people who make their own fun in The Wasteland.
---
I'm still really worried that we're all downloading the wrong patch here &gt;&lt;
---
I have a bloodied/stealth/rifleman/vats build, and my 1* bloodied handmade does 328 damage at 20% health.
---
Sure...here you go! https://discord.gg/xqP3DaH
---
Eh hem oh, not in utica, no, its an Albany expression
---
I had this bug for a few days, and then it just stopped.  Its extremely hard to fix when I'm sure they don't know the exact cause.
---
On that note, the jerky should also not go back.
---
If I make Fox Jerky, let me actually jerk and salt the meat to preserve it
---
I had this issue also and thought that the spawn point was determined based on the placement of the c.a.m.p. unit, but the camp owner moved it and I kept appearing in their wall.  It would be nice if you just popped next to what you get stuck in...
---
okay so i‘m not the only one. 
---
this is fucking ridiculous.
---
Mutated Skunks could be fun. THey could do a noxious cloud-like thing similar to what robo-brains do.
---
Wild Boar could be good.
---
I'd like to see a giant mutated River Otter. There's also some lore associated with them being re-established in WV after being excessively trapped. So you could have some kind of science experiment gone wrong affect them.
---
When i add another piece on top of it, i still can't select the pillar in the stone. Or is there a way to select all connected pieces like there was in Fallout4?
---
Yeah, before moving everything i'd rather live with it i guess. :/
---
Yes it is, with sneak/crit. Having a fucking 5x damage multiplier on top of having a 100% increase on your base damage from legendaries? That's a 10x multiplier on your first shot from instigating. A gun only needs to be around 100 damage for that. Tell me your western revolver sits around there or I'm going to laugh at you for making shit up.
---
Yeah we cant wait.  My group was all in through January.  When they nerfed explosive builds (the right decision fwiw) on of our group had reached his limit for frustration.  Finally got him to reinstall this week so were stoked and want a fresh start.  Thanks again man!
---
That's actually quite cool - I really like the layout of the rooms. The contrast between downstairs vs the 'abode' upstairs is nice too. 
---
I had an idea for a 'commander's bunker' near one of the silos for that exact reason too, as I imagine seeing the nukes fly out would be quite cool. Still decided where to put mine though - thinking near Site C as I wanna build closer to the Ash Heap. It's on my long to-build list.
---
8.5 gb on PC, wtf?! they said less than 1 xD
---
The reason beyond a cap isn't lost on me - dupers always kill the fun.
---
I was staring at a 3\* BoS combat chest piece and all I could see is +1 agility, which is what I wanted, but nothing else.  They wanted 1k caps which could have either meant it was a total steal or the other attributes were crap.  I almost messaged them but I just figured it wasn't my day and moved on.
---
Where can I find a Scotch beast, and are they single malt or blended?
---
I get over 400 steel just doing a run through the Top of the World area, or any location with a lot of supermutants.  Wash, rinse, repeat...  Just make sure to pick up all of the weapons and equip scrapper before scrapping them.  
---
As for lead, there are already posts here describing were to find that.   
---
There is a workshop in the mid-north area that has acid deposits.  I seem to remember it having mid-level enemies.  But it seemed to me that it’s a workshop that is hardly ever taken.
---
Now I'm stuck being "IdontwantBethesdalauncher."
---
Since last patch
---
Technically it's still available for workshops. They just need to add it to camps.
---
I think 200 is a stretch.  Maybe design some mid 90s mobs and call em high tier monster. I’m sitting at 198 on one toon and 120ish on another.  But I feel 80% of the playerbase is still sub 100s
---
Board is fine, giving away location is dumb.
---
I was angry at how much gauss rifle eat, then i bought handmade, that was very stupid. Fuck that shit i am melee now!

Mats would be perfect for griefers

It was like gold and silver if I remember right warlord style

I personally quit grinding recently, mostly playing fortnite since checked for daily atoms quests for a week and almost everytime I can't do them, what really annoyed me was that grahm one.
---
the PC update is actually 8.9GB big
---

---
Well don't be too discouraged, if you have enough to AP and the right lucks perks, and doing damage is not your main focus, it's very doable. Crit builds be crazy. You eventually get to the point where you are spamming fire and crit buttons.
---
Well people got mad when Bethesda only made bugs fixes now people are mad that their adding too much content. I don't get it
---
Looks like all PC users right now
---
&gt;Is it worth a second chance
---
Fast reloads can be glitched on the black powder weapons start reload switch weapon switch back to black powder weapon. 
---
I’d pick reduced weight since your not gonna use it often but when you need it you’ll have it
---
Its an online game. It has costs. You don't have to like it, but the company has owners and they want to make money. It is not an altruistic construct. If they sold the game and then ran servers and updates without income they would be shut down within a week for losing money for the company.
---
There is good reason for that. Bethesda really rushed the game, and therefore caused alot of people like me that were turned off by the bad quality and want to know if they want to play the game again and actually get their money out of it.
---
I do think if it's a kill room we should be able to attack the base and not be wanted. It's only fair that if your base hurts me I can do damage back or at least have a chance to smash the room while it's killing me. Cliff launchers, not much you can do there unless you are b.b. and can hit it after the trap springs I guess. Just a suggestion for bes
---
How has it changed since January?  That was my original build and it jusr wasnt cutting it.  Thank you for the advice.
---
nah keep jumping back now and again.
---
tip for low internet speeds. let the update start, and log out of fo76. I get 5 times the download speed.
---
It works on XBOX, try playing an instrument or sleeping in your CAMP, it’ll idle out after 30 mins but gets you 30 mins!
---
Is anyone else getting the bug where every time you log into the game (after having the app completely closed) that it resets your "Chat" audio back to zero in the audio settings?
---
Very minor, but annoying to have to fix every time.
---
So why not use the search function and look up one of the many detailed ones?
---
i see, guess they forgot to add a 0.
---
That's not true, that only applies to Adventure.  This past weekend I destroyed multiple bases.
---
It was around 6Gb on PS4, downloaded in about 10 minutes. Servers still down though.
---
You sure about that? Melee hits don't deal any damage about 20% of the time, several mutations do not work with class freak, anti armor doesn't work with energy guns, neither the perks nor the legendary prefix, spawning in players camps often results in spawning inside a wall, items go missing from stash or inventory, never ending loading screens or freezes, locations not loading correctly and that's just the bugs i can think of right now.
---
Ive never tried workshops because im not sure if that will cancel out my camp or not. I have my camp in a kinda of weird spot and im worried that if i start up a workshop that i might not be able to place my camp down again. Do workshops put ur camp into blueprints?
---
Hear me out, paragraphs.
---
I think the only doenside to a commanders bunker is the limited building sets, mayne make outside like a metal shack but inside like the smooth side of the bricks?

I wanna try this now

---
Yeah giving away locations on a survival mode is kind of silly.
---
 The leaderboard bothers me though it feels like I'm playing an arcade game.  That and the dings Bells and whistles that go off every time somebody's killed.
---
Not having locked characters doesn't make me want to play that survival mode either.
---
 Just not my thing even though I did want unrestricted PVP.
---
Thanks!

---
Every time that message comes up I get to the word "verdant" I have to stop and remember what that means, and by that time, the message is gone :)
---
It's all good the Death Blossoms still gives everybody on the server the plant parts from completing so I guess feed the people pollen!
---
I've always been a rifle build and now Im at a level high enough to move some cards around..I'm gonna test out a bloodied build with it..basically after level 50..I've been one shotting mostly everything
---
It's not the same people complaining. Do you really not understand how i want to play without game breaking bugs?
---
The concentrated fire one...... the one where you can vats limb and increase accuracy with weapons in vat, don’t know what it’s called off the top of my head
---
Thanks for this. The cost in bulking is the plastic, but fortunately i have a pretty good plastic farming run that is pretty lucrative if you can beat others there. I had over 800 plastic at one point and ended up selling a lot of it. Now I wish hadn't. =P
---
Either back out of the build menu, or attach the wire from the other end; wire it to, not from the item yourjumping at. Both work for me.
---
Yeah to a comment posted after mine.
---
Oh crap, this means I have to move and build my camp all over from scratch. Last time I did it took over 4 hours to make it work.
---
Can't just move it as it's specifically build on the ground it is at the moment.
---
Have to think of a build where the central point is free for spawning.
---
One is much easier then the other
---
They took the topiaries away! A great fix indeed! /s
---
Turn off the quests?
---
Yeah, this pretty much why it's in the to-build pile. I get the impression we're getting some more factional stuff later in the year maybe, so maybe some Enclave/BoS/Free States bits especially might push me to give it a stab.
---
Well can't argue with that
---
You probably got downvoted into oblivion for this but it’s true.
---
&gt;If Campfire Tales/Stings and Things/Operation Tidy gives you a Possum Badge, it will display incorrect numbers, like   
---
&gt;200,000 + 31
---
ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Lazy.
---
You can't VATS crit every single shot. Western Revolvers have no silencers so you'd kill maybe one guy then you wouldn't be sneak attacking anything else. Instigating isn't useful against large enemies like Sheepsquatch/SBQ, and possibly the large enemies in the future like those from the Vault Raids. 
---
You ignored the whole second point though, you can do both of those things with a bloodied/low hp build and do 5-10x that damage.
---
I think it’s already been confirmed that a couple of them will be high level raids. So unlikely. That said, they could be full of humans that you have to fight. And they *could* start a new human raider-type faction out in the world. But I doubt it, they would need to segregate the players in to two worlds so that people starting their game weren’t overrun with human raiders.
---
Dig!
---
This is how online games work. Cant have an endgame available and beatable in the first six months of release. They are adding more content and more story missions. The SBQ was only the end of the first chapter.

Honestly that never made sense, or how we can't make cream, but we find prewar jugs of it that we still drink! We got brahmin milk so there is one thing. On the topic of dairy, what about cheese?

The leaderboard having people marked on the map does make it feel super arcade like.
---
For the love of god Bethesda give us a freaking handmade skin it’s pretty much the most popular gun type Ive been saving atoms and not spending fearing it will come on a 1 day only sale
---
4 cores. Not 5. Just did this the other day. Not a huge difference in the mats needed but can make a difference to anyone attempting to know, should they have 4 and think they need a 5th.

Imagine being too lazy to use the search function

Ahhh, I did store it, if I break it down will i get the same components I used to build it or less?

The first time I had a nukashine was today n I woke up atop a tree house miles above the ground somewhere in the cranberry bog n could see scores of bloatflys beneath the house..got spooked out n fast traveled back to the safety of my camp..should try it again..seems like a fun thing to do..

Reminds me of the hybrid mods that DE added into warframe recently.

Kids have got to learn how to cuss at some time and in Scotland it’s mandatory to learn how to call someone a cunt before you learn what one is.

I've been holding onto one for the day when we can decorate with junk items just so I can set it down
---
This is what I’m talking about. Somebody downvoted you, and I pulled it back up. What kind of morons keep trying to suppress awareness of this serious bug?
---
Just exit and reenter workshop mode. It's a annoying bug but not that big of a deal
---
It's weird, cause if I'm in CAMP the game will not log me off. Main menu? Yeah it'll boot me in 10 minutes or so. Makes no sense.

---
Well, I've never actually experienced any of those (except the occasional freeze or infinite loading screen).
---
And the CAMP spawning seems more like a design flaw rather than a bug.
---
I did about 30(probably more)campfire events and only got 1 badge. I did archaeologist,atomically, backpacker, electrician,  gardener, photographer, and rail enthusiast.
---
Got one in a cabinet during that short little event at Mount Blair trainyard, the one where you have to kill the sentry bot and run its keycard
---
That wiki also has a great amount of information about locations, items, crafting and similar. Just make sure you are looking at Fallout 76 articles when searching.
---
It’d be polite for people to drop a stash box at the front door ;-)
---
I have a weird feeling from the size it could be Nuclear Winter update early
---
Really hoping it's just a typo on the nots. 'cause patch 9 for consoles was about 8 gig. kinda worried we're all getting that instead of PC 9.5 &gt;&lt;
---
I thought I had but il give it another try and make sure well tuned comes up, thanks and keep your fingers crossed for me lol
---
Seriously, I've become so fucking tired of seeing these posts. You shouldn't need other people to persuade you to play a game. You can use Google or Youtube to find every last change since the last time you played. Make up your own damn mind because no one wants to try to convince you to play. If you didn't enjoy the game at launch then you most likely won't enjoy it now. While server dc and lag has been lessened it is still a thing. That, along with bugged quests. I've found that the main player base is composed of people who are able to make their own fun in The Wasteland.
---
They do have some code for a camp refrigeration system that was found recently. It seems there will be a base model added for everyone and some skinned/themed ones.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
When this has happened (has happened to many dlc doorways) fast travelling away to a place far away enough that the area would be unloaded, waiting a minute or so, then travelling back has worked for me (also helped when the door hadnt loaded in at all).

---
&gt; under 1 GB for PC
---
Meanwhile I'm here having an 8.5 GB download on PC. :(
---
Yeah hopefully, would like to see a return of the hardcore industrial style concrete pieces from FO4 again, they were good for building all sorts of shiz with.  
---
If wanna team up and play sometime send me a message, would be good to play with someone else with a passion for building like me :p
---
I once played a game called entropia? Universe the Sweden base Sci fi mmorpg. It’s basically gambling in game form. Had fun put 350$ into it got out 400$ and realized had bad it could get. Diablo 3 did not force you to buy anything though unlike that game. 
---
I would love to have a RMAH. I’d game to make money and still have a shit ton of fun.  I like items that are really good being super rare. Puts a good spin on the game like NM’s in ffxi back in the day.
---
Sometimes I don't even bother trying to cure them, they go away fast enough on their own?  
---
The only downside is I end up accidentally killing people's pets because of the Plague Walker mutation.
---
When you try to hit a flying creature in vats with a melee weapon it always shows 0% chance to hit and indeed, you can't hit it no matter how close you are
---
People would abuse the mats to trap people or kill you off a cliff or whatever.
---
Well but i did experience those and many people as well
---
Third tier could be increased DR while reloading.
---
Nice to know.

THANK YOU

I would recommend something like this for spamming that (https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=16111ff&amp;d=ld2lr2l12lk2le2a72ad2ak2al2a30ac0am0p02pb2&amp;w=&amp;n=Framework%20Crit%20VATS&amp;m=)[medic crit].
---
I give the fluctuating market a serious hard look. I think some ppl are charging way too much just cuz. Arguments I've heard are there's "nothing else to spend caps on" but that's not really true.... there's many expensive vendor plans to collect esp PA ones and serums. And if "there's nothing else to spend caps on" then why are you selling things for such high prices to horde caps that you have "nothing else to spend" on? 
---
Anyway, I see a good amount of ppl charging 1 star legendaries that aren't even "the best" effects for 6k to 8k  Not really optimum 2 stars at 10-16k. Great rolls 2-3 stars should fetch a pretty high price, but not 25-30-50-75-100k imo. Maybe that's just me and I come at it from a purely cooperative PvE experience.
---
Looks cool.  
---
Is the from Game of.........????  🤠
---
Since faster reload doesnt stack with speed demon, it would be +250 DR while reloading.
---
This games needs a HUGE patch only with bug fixes and QoL stuff (passive non-combat cards, fast travelling destination welcome mats, etc)
---
another fuck up on that scale wouldn‘t even surprise me anymore. disappoint, yeah, but not surprise. gonna spend the next 2 hours downloading then, nice
---
Its alot easier fixing a simple mistake in the atom shop then it is creating entirely new questlines and content
---
same, that's a very long download for me, RIP today's plan
---
Thanks, So I need to just keep trying it. It’s driving me mad.
---
None of your account info will transfer over, AFAIK (that includes characters, Atom points/purchases, etc.).  
---
As for performance, it really depends on your system specs. What are you running?
---
Aside from differentiating them, you need to type the name of the character you want to delete. It kinda acts like an extra kayer of protection. You will never accidentally delete a character.
---
You’re welcome but the real thanks goes to u/Yabvone
---
Then scroll down on your mouse wheel.
---
Wrong, if I were running tank i'd be using heavy weapons with 250 DR increase + the DR increase while shooting, Ironclad, barbarian, and Evasive, Serendipity etc etc.
---
Exactly this. I bore this in mind when I relocated yesterday, and no issues for people travelling to my camp. 
---
As for the camp owner it seems to me like we spawn at some point at the original green boundary. Not sure what decides it but I kind of suspect sort of behind us as we originally set camp module down. Reason I think this is because I camp on a lake and I was looking towards the lake when I placed my camp. I spawn in on the ground rather than in the water (unlike my last residency here where i did spawn in in the water).
---
My Camp is right next to a static death bear spawn at Nuke Silo Alpha, just to remind me how scary they are -
---
It's not a story Vault-Tec would tell you.
---
Luckily I'm a lady, so this won't be an issue for me. Been considering purchasing atoms so I can buy it.
---
What I dislike is now with the change I cant just level the camp and get myself out
---
Can meat stew no longer decays but I’ve yet to see the event since the patch.
---
I use an asterisk next to mine...  I use it to quickly get to my PA when I stumble into A bunch of Bears or a SheepSquatch.
---
Of course, it also helps prevent scrapping the wrong stuff...

Have you not downloaded previous updates?

I played on another character for a few days ... maybe that helped, don't know.  Lost all my photos though ...

Any information in regards to why laser weapons not benefiting from the Scorched bonus with Prime capacitors due to not being projectiles?
---
Actually a good video! I kinda noticed the same stuff dropping on certain servers buy thought it ought to be luck.
---
Well mods aren't allowed so I doubt they will answer you
---
Yes exactly that would be the best patch ever
---
Most frustrating is that vats melee didn't used to have this problem. They tried to fix something and just broke it. Going on two weeks meow
---
I’ve been playing a new character since Friday but it feels so pointless. Yeah I lost mine after I deleted the saved data on the storage. Wasn’t too bothered about that as mostly dead animals.
---
This sounds like a perfect idea to get rid of some of my weapons instead of waiting like a week to scrip them all
---
idk about OP, but for me if there is a NPC or another player fighting the same NPC I am, I rarely get any sneak bonus, which basically breaks my whole build
---
Oh wow, you’re right. That would be useless
---
yeah, me too
---
Take my upvote, sir!
---
I would think that writing out a thread and waiting for responses takes more effort.
---
And hey, you’re the one who clicked on this thread and decided to respond with something that doesn’t help the op (or anyone who searches up this topic and finds this thread in the future) in the slightest.
---
Different times of day, and definitely not the same server as I play with my s/o and made note of that. I am on the old gen xbox so things normally load slowly for me and that may be part of it but even when I stuck around lewisburg for a few it never opened.

I play this game because I'm not a whiny bitch.

no you just won't be able to make any new ones

I always follow the rule of thumb: *who smelt it, dealt it*
---
oh man i had AAE with DR /ER bonus while realoading and i scrapped it yesterday :D
---
Yep might as well save up the legendaries and script
---
It doesn’t? That’s great to know. I use speed demon.
---
 Looks like AAE with 250DR while reloading is best for me
---
Yeah, this is correct. Still, having 20 nuke material can still be a pain for lower levels.
---
Might be better in some cases, but i would still like to have the mat so i can design spawn areas and make it much quicker for players to access my store and while i'm sure there would be people who would make these traps, i don't know how frequent of a problem they would really be, considering you can just fast travel out and not comeback there again.
---
Same here, was a bit confused myself. So happy I finally got decent internet a few months ago only a 5 minute download. Before that though this would have taken all day and night probably.
---
Life is also too short to read essays on Reddit.
---
You’re joking...
---
lmao alright. i don‘t expect bethesda to answer, don‘t worry. some mods like 3d underwear textures and sunglass retextures simply make the game more bearable, and i‘m sure beth won‘t ban any more users for cosmetic mods, especially after their little essay scandal.
---
"I uninstalled Sekrio "
---
BLASPHEMY!
---
Any idea why my download is over 8 GB? limited mobile internet sooo that sucks..
---
Agreed - there "customer service" is simply nonexistent. Not their fault,, they just dont seem to have any tools at their disposal to actually help anyone unlike most other games where a ticket will usually result in the item being confirmed as missing and returned, something with an additional gift as a gesture of goodwill.
---
I think I’ve only run into one. All the doors were open when I came in but i generally, politely, close doors behind me and I soon found all doors were locked after. I just fast traveled out instead of getting a wanted status 
---
Another time I’m undecided if it was intentional but I was in a camp when they left the server. Problem is the camp was hanging over a cliff. Lol
---
Is that not already an option?
---
IIRC it's pressing "T" a couple of times on PC to do it.
---
Will have to wait until servers are back up to check though
---
I'm lightly chuckling at the idea of a wasteland loan shark, coming round to take a finger cause ya didn't pay.
---
Generally performance has been the same for me as far as I'm aware, however now I'll get a 1 to 3 second-long freeze every hour or two.
---
Can someone please confirm the total patch size to date? I would like to buy the game, but I am not sure if I have enough space on the ps4.
---
also, MELEE is still broken
---
Most of the survival challenges are a friggin' joke.  It's literally been harder to complete some of the dailies for atoms than it has to get a legendary weapon. I only log onto Survival once a week, specifically for the weapons, and have gotten most of them; the entire time I think maybe I have had two or three PvP interactions.
---
You can also place a wall with a door, put the power cable trough the door, then replace the wall door with a normal wall.
---
You could try making a blueprint of the two pillars maybe or try storing instead of deleting?
---
Anyone test if you can store pre-built ones and then place them?
---
It's because there isn't a better system in place and these guys are valid customers.  Yes they're breaking the rules but they have fans, and clients and people who risk online rep and real cash dollars on things in a game that needs as much attention now as it ever did as people are starting to come back.   If you boot all the cheaters and hackers, they'll run out of things to make videos of and then fo76 will fall off the mediascape.
---
I can't start over. I've spent so so much time grinding for my gear. I just snagged my perfect gun, had all but one piece of armor to my set. The thought of starting over is just not doable. I'll just go back to overwatch.
---
I'm telling you this past weekend I was destroying player turrets in survival in a multiple of ways.
---
I actually really enjoy the light boxes. I tried to make vault boy with them once but I ran out of budget, because they are in the "lights" category the used to take up even more budget then they do now. When Bethesda cut down the budget cost of lights, they also limited the amount so that people couldn't go overboard and lag out the whole server. 
---
I'd love to see Bethesda do something about the light boxes but I doubt they would.
---
Yeah that is a loading glitch- Happens to me with the Purveyor. Just wait a few minutes
---
/r/NukeForHire
---
111 was meant to open after 18 months according to the terminals in there. But it didnt. It opened just over 200 years after.
---
There's no mention of the Musician Badge being fixed for playing the musical instruments or building them.
---
im getting a 8.48gb patch in pc not under 1gb
---
Is it a tamed behemoth?
---
yep, at least the whole game didn't get deleted this time \^_\^
---
It's the wrong patch on PC I'm showing as being 1.1.2.9  April update after it finished
---
Lol look, you may not intend to be running tank, but you are. Are you as tanky as you could be? No, but you're certainly not running damage and you're pretty beefy at full hp unless you're just bad at building toons.
---
I'm sure someone already said it, but the Advanced power connectors will be your best friend. Learn to use conduit and it makes everything so much easier, plus it looks nice too!
---
you may be Brotherhood but you certainly ain't a scribe
---
YES THATS ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT THE FROG HABITAT WORKS THIS IS THE BEST UPDATE YET WOOOOOHOOOO
---
Plus you can use mods, if that's your thing.
---
PS4? If so, I think I've seen you. If not, then probably here...
---
Another vote for both passive perks and load outs.
---
"Digging Deeper" was last patch's moto
---
Yeah it's quite award that my female character's name show as Mr.Manly
---
Respect.
---
Nah Xbox
---
My fatman and minigun look fancy all shiny
---
Oh my bad 😅, yeah just a bunch of random being random. 
---
If you got to the part of the Brotherhood of Steel missions, the lack of discipline and coordination is addressed in there. It's like they knew 😂
---
I am running 0 tank perks, Mutations, weapons, etc so how am I a tank? By not playing the game with 50% of my hp as radiation?
---
I wish :/
---
That is exactly what I imagined
---
Yes it is exactly this. What everyone else has been saying is wrong.
---
I think they are right where they need to be actually.  If anything they have too high of Damage resistances.
---
Patience also work.  If you wait a few seconds after assigning something a price, it will scroll normally.  At least it does for me on xbox
---
...and a damned near unlimited number of MAC addresses on each of those systems including the host. They're controlled by software, not hardware, and changing them is trivial.
---
Huh.  There's a thought.  There is already the fermenter mechanic in game: make fermentables, place them in the fermenter for a while (or in your inventory for longer) until its condition degrades into its fermented form.  Placing prepared mutfruit chunks or strips of molerat meat in a food dehydrator could work the same way to make dried food.  Could be a neat mini-quest to find a food dehydrator in the field to repair for use in the CAMP.
---
Or it could be even more complex than that, requiring glass jars to be made from glass and steel (or found as scrap in the field, although it'd be nice to still have them as craftable), then consumed at a food station to make non-expiring canned fruits or whatnot.
---
That said, I kind of feel like it'd end up being more of a headache than it's worth.
---
I had to restart the launcher to get the download to start.
---
I'm not trying to be patronizing, but is this your first online game? 
---
Botters and cheaters always outpace the game devs

Why is my download 8.48GB on PC if its supposed to be under a GB?
---
I've just made a whole post dedicated to the topic of what is terrible about survival, check out that if you are interested I will keep this reply focused on the topic for this post.I am advocating primarily for PvP to have a presence in adventure mode. For the sake of a raider playstyle which by definition is robbing and looting unsuspecting/ or slightly less prepared players. I understand people shouldn't be forced into it so the suggestion I made was have pacifist mode completely protect you and your CAMP from player harm with the exception of workshops. So all a pacist player has to do is put on that mode and not claim a workshop. I fail to see how those suggestions are not reasonable.
---
I could be wrong and maybe screwed myself over but I went out of my way to avoid losing it and keep seeing these reports so idk. Take it fwiw
---
:D
---
That's illegal!
---
Quad explosive is probs high on the list
---
Cost to manufacture a soda is?   Cost to manufacture a high capacity backpack mod is?
---
I am usually the only person on the server with mic set on area mode :(
---
Haven’t seen this with my .50 cal one shot explosive [PS4].  But I mainly use it against Scortch Beasts and Sheep Squatch. 
---
I use my .50 cal explosive hunting rifle all of the time and never see it there either.
---
3 times the charm :)
---
It literally happened to me again today, it just works
---
If that's the kind of person you are then no, it's not worth. Play something else. Thanks.
---
Servers still down for ps4?
---
Bear arms bloodied melee
---
120s. Full health, rifle perks, explosive perk.  AAE and FE.
---
nice, I'll do that
---
Did everyone really think it was a free item? I thought it was pretty obviously a Bethesda fuck up.
---
Yeah that's my point. Don't think they could have it. That's all.
---
this was driving me nuts i could not assign any fermented drink into the fermenter and i went and scrap all my bedroom to make some budget but i still can't put any drink there it says max budget blah blah
---
I can create a blueprint with it (through 'select structure'), but is there a way to store the items i created the blueprint with?
---
 I see no other way to store it since i can't select it alone...
---
"most of them! is not enough, it should be "all of them".
---
It's as simple as Bethesda makes a worker to go to buy anythin from every eBay/websites active shop. 
---
The dupers will wil serve the product to the customer from an alt account. 
---
Then the dev team just needs to track that account and the connected ones.
---
Close them all and delete all the fraudulent items!
---
Dupers are an insult for legit players. The game will gain a lot of respect and good press when this problem is solved.
---
Is the game still a massive grind fest just to keep bullets in your guns and your armor repaired from normal use? That's the thing that put me off from buying it.
---
Nope, I was playing last night and also had a 8.5gb download. Looks like a lot of people in this post have the same issue.
---
Hey there /u/ZanthirEAS, can you add a couple additional items under **Oversight**?
---
Floor Items and Plants clip through terrain in various parts of the world, preventing proper placement.
---
Anti-Armor being spawned with Energy Weapons as Prefix legendary items, but the weapons can't benefit from the perk. This is either an oversight with the perk or the weapons. Either way, it should be addressed. [More info here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpfhr0/bgs_are_energy_weapons_supposed_to_have_antiarmor/)
---
Energy Weapons with Prime Capacitors do not deal the bonus damage to Scorched and SBs due to their attacks being energy and not projectile based. (I believe /u/Eckserah can confirm this through datamining)
---
Speed demon wont stack with any movement speed or reload speed bonuses.
---
Yeah! I've seen a lot of posts about it being 15 how. Which is trash lol. But then a few posts mentioned they were getting ~300hp??? If other people were getting different health regens from different play styles, I imagine there's a way to buff the heal from it. Or hope there is anyway. That could really help with a healer spec.
---
Thats a good point, it never even occurred to me that there would be an animation for the nukes being launched.  
---
do you know if theres anyway to tell which silo its coming from? other than launching it yourself?
---
Nope. Workshops don't have any effect on your camp.
---
Truth
---
Nice.
---
Also sometimes when you spool up to fire, you wont fire anything and have to keep respooling up till you can shoot again.
---
I was thinking maybe a condition boost kinda like weapon artisan or the armor equivalent.
---
Maybe even link it to a perk card named something like "Gourmand".
---
If you solo it is only 1 lvl 80 schorched beast
---
I’m not positive.  I haven’t messed with the blueprints much I just know you can “stick” things together with them so thought maybe it might trick your pillar.
---
Sure, if you got a tse shotgun that can shoot for 100 miles in third person, you're not complaining. All I'm saying is the rest of us csn band together and actually role play as vault dwellers instead of every encounter ending in kill for kill until all your gear is busted. If you don't like it get the fuck out.
---
I found out about that, set my ammo to free, but then started wondering if it applied to scrap as well, so I bulked all my scrap before selling.
---
Oh I agree. But in my case when I ran the excavator, I recouped my nuclear material. So it’s a bit of a gamble on whether it’s worth it or not.
---
Hmmm. Make sense. I *do* have a sign that says "no clothing"
---
When you get high level and have some decent weapons and perks its very easy to go through solo, I go through there when I want to collect ultracite ore
---
No.  Your CAMP is safe.  Take those workshops.
---
Yes, I agree. I have a pipe rifle, it's level 35 so does poor damage. But I've also had a few other drops with higher damage weapons like a handmande, 10mm, rocket launcher. So I'll have to run some tests to be sure. Thanks for your input! This is exactly what I've been experiencing as well.
---
Great plan, except you forgot the part where you have to get to combat to be invulnerable.
---
I rebuilt 3 near-completed camps because I couldn't remove a single wall...fucking silly.
---
Check the collections tab in your pipboy. The game doesn't actually tell you if you've earned a badge for an event, it just sort of appears. I thought it was broken too, but I checked and realized I had 4 of them already.
---
That said, they only have a 25% drop rate, so it's conceivable that you could run the events several times and just have a bad run of RNG.
---
Yeah, it's pretty unfair. I'm not gonna be too torn up about losing the topiaries- I really only built them because I COULD- but it's their own fault that they became available to everyone regardless of whether they purchased it, they already occasionally give out free Atomic shop items anyway, why not just own up to the mistake and make the topiaries the next official 'free' item anyway? It'd make way more sense than just ripping them out of the hands of people who already have it and saying 'No, you're not supposed to have these, give me $5 and then you can have it back.' Like what a dick move.
---
I feel like no one won with this comment.
---
I named mine Akara, which I thought was what it would show when I played. 🤷‍♀️
---
The entire art direction of the game is stuck in the 20-30’s, arcade look, nothing remotely resembles what we should be looking at in half century. It’s a funny mix, probably their approach in order to make a wasteland theme not too heavy.
---
Thank Atom they fixed the bugs with Tadpole challenges
---
I had no issue, but I tend to drag my heels a bit on quests and was well past 50 when I attempted it. I think expecting a 25 to solo it might be wishful thinking.
---
It was the largest game on that SSD, don't worry it'll be reinstalled this weekend on another drive, still gotta finish NG+3 :-)
---
Would have been even simpler not to make said mistake in the first place and then not devote resources to it again on the next sprint. But the fact remains that such a stupid item was 1) developed 2) incorrectly implemented 3) reprogrammed. Thats a lot of Dev time that could have gone to actual content. Almost like after steps 1 and 2 you would just cut your losses and focus on something that would benefit your player base instead of your bottom line.
---
I got lucky.  There is NO way I can move my camp (it's shoehorned into a small canyon on a creek.  But the spawn location is right out front of my building, which works out great.
---
Yep I was playing just before the servers went down
---
Is this... a rant about a game being too challenging? I can't even.
---
Just grind in high level areas
---
I had the same thing happen last night in Whitesprings on a Level 62 Legendary Ghoul.
---
Playing on PC
---
Plain Jane Level 50 caliber machine gun
---
Pumped it full of .50 for a couple seconds before I realized it was down to a sliver of health and not going any lower.  I stopped shooting and it's health started to regenerate very quickly.  Switched to Puncturing Power Fist and it was dead in two hits.
---
I know I have had the same thing happen with a Legendary Sheepsquatch.  Don't know if Legendary has anything to do with it, or if it's just because I am getting excited about killing one so I notice it more, but I don't seem to have this issue with "normal" enemies.
---
Dont players in survival just have to holster their weapons to not be marked as hostile?
---
Managed to pull it off with my stealth sniper &amp; bloodied melee without much issue? I can barely remember it.
---
May need some respec to drag up damage output or resistance?
---
Yes.  Very few times.  But yes, I’ve run across a couple since legendary drops became much more common.
---
No idea then
---
hey, i live there too! by the freak show, i assume. its great to live right next to a place with a caps stash and lods of caps strewn about lol
---
Nope
---
Yeah I see that now
---
bUt JuIcEhEaD sAyS....
---
I dont think they even read your comment.
---
The holotape has a 15 minute delay, so my guess is no. You'd just have to look for the noise (which I imagine would be loud). There's probably research out there on which silo gets use the most tbf.
---
Ive still never been caught by one of these (because ive never seen one).
---
I feel left out :(
---
Yeah this is what I'm working on. The medic pistol seem to be a good option for crits. Reason being they seem to consume less AP in VATS than the heavy guns and rifles. But I'm still testing this.
---
I get that at bibs often and it always corrects in a minute or two. So I'm aware of that. That's why this glitch is definitely worse for me.
---
Lvl 25 is way to early to go in there, probably 40 too. At lvl 60 I ran through it with careful skill and it worked fine. A good gun, a well planned build and some stealth takes you a long way.
---
Yeah this is what I found as well. You really need to think where you're going to place the workbench initially. You can move it later. But the original place is still where everyone will spawn.
---
&gt;You can't VATS crit every single shot.
---
No, but you can vats crit every other shot... No wait, you can't because you don't run unyielding.
---
&gt; Western Revolvers have no silencers so you'd kill maybe one guy then you wouldn't be sneak attacking anything else.
---
Except if you built your character properly around your gear you can stand up and crouch again to lose the mobs.
---
&gt; You ignored the whole second point though, you can do both of those things with a bloodied/low hp build and do 5-10x that damage.
---
That isn't the issue here, you said it couldn't be done, I proved it can. Now that you've been proven wrong you're comin' at me with a bunch of other bullshit. Who cares. If we're going to talk about ignoring, you've done quite a bit of it to go on your little tirade. At the end of the day my first point still stands, you're a salty player who refuses (for some unknown reason) to run the clearly strongest build (which is totally fine until this next point) and bitches about people who do. Quit being a bitch, quit bitching about other people who are utilizing game mechanics to do their best, quit being condescending to others for the natural game play progression. So stick your head back in the sand and leave the rest of us alone. 
---
That being said, I already said in a post **you replied to** that I think there should be some sort of equalizing mutation that allows non bloodied builds to compete. I agree that it has **too big** of an edge, but the fact stands that it does. You have no recourse to bitch because you have the same game mechanics available to you as I do. There is literally nothing I can't do in game because I'm running bloodied. I'm not limited by my build in any way. So why are you so set against it?
---
I gave up, I couldn't get 4 walls to match up. I just place a crapper for the view and a boring floor.
---
People are pretty cool usually tbh. Me and my wife are pretty mediocre at PvP. Together we beat most people, but those AAE, TSE, or whatever level 100+ with full armor sets still generally whoop us. That said just drop your meds in your stash and don’t travel to heavily populated train stations. You can also run from most people fairly easily if need be. Honestly it adds an edge to the game, and not all people are dicks. Did a challenge that involved competing events and only got one server where people were dicks about it. Multiple times there were groups of 5+ people in survival just teaming up for events and spamming waves and hearts at each other afterwards. It was pretty cool. Maybe it helps that I have a TSE 10mm justtt in case, and she just bought a TSE pump action we need to try out, but our armor is pretty garbage and our perks aren’t what they should be yet for PvP.
---
It's the "Y" key in XB when viewing your machine inventory. Pretty sure there's the same option for other platforms.

/u/valseek my PC patch is 8GB, intended?
---
&gt; Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 5.5 GB for consoles and under 1 GB for PC.

I once listened to a guy living 200km north of me in Western Canada incorrectly explaining indigenous culture to someone from Texas. It went on for maybe 15 minutes while I was crafting in the Enclave. Which was bizarre and teeth grinding, but also rather nice to hear actual conversation.
---
Generally when I hear people talk, it's them RPing some weirdness at their camp.
---
I actually bought a new headset for this game and have used it in-game maybe twice since launch, I play at least an hour a day.
---
I think it's more that it's a PC culture thing rather than regional. Most games just don't need to coordinate 40 person raids or have immediate knowledge of your teammates location, text works well enough. I haven't regularly used a headset mic since I stopped playing TF2 competitively maybe 5 years ago, and apparently I still don't...but it's kind of nice it's there on the rare chance I run into someone who won't run away when I talk.
---
Rubber band your sticks together so your character just walks around in a circle in your house. You'll never get kicked out then.
---
I wondered about that... didn't remember putting a scar on my character.
---
Absolutely this.
---
Yeah same on PC, currently 2.16GB into my 8GB download that is apparently under 1GB...
---
So why tf is my bethesda launcher downloading a 8.5GB Update? I was just playing yesterday.
---
Spoilers 
---
&gt;!Residents of vault 51 were all died because of ZAX prototype trying to find a new overseer, one of the vaults in mire opened up to help survivors of war but got massacred by raiders, Don't know about last 2 but one of them will be a raid vault, and remaining one is vault 63. That one vault is last hope for human NPCs.!&lt;
---
I guess you could just always go to the same one, and eventually you'd see it.  but that just makes me realize I dont know what part of the ground it would come out of....  lol
---
I've had issues with my gatling failing to damage targets that are "too close." I.e.: melee range. But no, otherwise no issues here.
---
111 opened due to food shortages and riots and whatnot. And opened 3 times once of the former riots and twice due to institute intervention. Once to take Shaun and once to let the sole survivor out.
---
Somebody get me the phone, cause i F\*\*\*ing called it..
---
I actually now want this in the game it would be the most amazing little update ever
---
But I have no expenses, maybe if I start buying mutations. Or a better sniper.
---
I'm not experiencing that particular bug, but when I get down to my final core it only has a single shot in it (1/1) and then is depleted
---
It’s cost me multiple weapons with useless bash damage 😂
---
Downvoted? I could care less what the hell these kids do. Doesn’t affect my life one bit. :)
---
Bunch of damn snowflakes- downvote that 😎
---
My C.A.M.P. is terrible for spawning in visitors. And visitors without marsupial. And visitors that take fall damage. People either get stuck in the lower level foundations, or spawn on the ground far below, or high up and have to drop. I can't imagine how many people have given up trying to check out my shop. Shame too, because my C.A.M.P. is quite a looker.
---
So far yeah
---
Ultimately, I think the item is set to a specific number or %, although I don't know what that number is. If there was a way to extract that quantitative measure and factors that contribute to increase the heal, it would be great! But I think it hasn't really been addressed by Bethesda because it's not exactly mainstream.
---
Not seeing anything any bit impressive there to be honest.
---
It's easy to hit camp's owner, mini nukes, orbital strikes, mortars, get creative.
---
It’s on her back because the textures fail to load
---
Not sure your images are right :)
---
I'm surprised that wasn't hotfixed the next day. Can't wait to see what they show up in the Atom Shop for - probably 1400 atoms each.
---
That's the end result, but not how updates (usually) work.
---
What happens is the updated files get downloaded and verified, then the old files get deleted, then the new files get copied into place.  So much of the stuff needs to exist in 2 places at the same time (the old file, and the new one).
---
They *tend* not to erase the old files before downloading the new ones, in case something goes wrong.
---
With that logic people would walk around with their head down and ignore any problem they witness. Never voicing your opinion leads to getting walked over. I'll be damned if I see a problem and don't speak up about it. For some reason people on forum sites are flamed for posting a thread that's been talked about before while this topic is brought up at least 3 times a day. I know I'm being a bit harsh but I strongly stand by what I said in my previous comment.
---
There are still other Possum badge challenges that are not correctly being completed. Specifically the Musician badge.
---
They've added a bunch of new content - as recently as a couple of hours ago. Really varied requirements too, things that require travelling all over and doing odd things. Right now I'm trying to learn the recipe for S'Mores to help with my cooking and backpacking Pioneer scout badges.

Not a joke.

On my main I have all except junk weight reduction perks. I think it fairly well works, as then putting any valuable junk into stash I've alway done, it doesn't "increase" it's weight. I've been trying to collect vanguar +weight reduction armor to replace those perks, so instead I could use perks and special points more towards damage and such. Ill probably go with getting 3 AID weight reduction pieces, that's 60%, allowin to free 4 perk cards/specials, as the AID composes of both food and drugs which on perks are separate.
---
Im pretty sure all weight reduction effects cap at 90% so 4 weapon weight reduction pieces would be more optimal, plus 1 other for something else. Also, granades and mines are weapons as far as the armor effect goes.

Yeah, you don't spawn at the same spot everyone else does. It's dumb. You spawn in a random spot on the edges of your own camp. Almost always at the bottom of a lake if possible. Rofl.
---
PC can do this by alt tabbing.
---
Should get even more by putting the console into rest mode
---
Far fewer components are returned when breaking down camp items versus what's required to build them, but yes, you do get some stuff back.
---
You will get a good portion of the scrap however you can also place it back down.

---
Snapping Turtle: I say it could replace the spawns of deathclaws in the eastern part of the map, and it would be extremely hard to kill. By Various
---
Fully Aquatic Species: I say something involving the pet trade and sportsmen who really want more variety would make sense. By u/[Sinfirmitas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sinfirmitas/)
---
Giant Mantis: This could work, as they were in other fallout games. They could possibly be a new challenge in the forest. By u/[LindenOLindenHill](https://www.reddit.com/user/LindenOLindenHill/)
---
Irradiated Vultures: This is a good idea, as they could possibly act as a small enemy that gathers at places of mass death, maybe they could be immune to the scorched plague, but are active transmitters of it? By u/[Sinfirmitas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sinfirmitas/)
---
Radskunk: Never thought I would hear people ask for a skunk but why the heck not. I say they could be a introduction to avoid AoE attacks such as scorchbeasts and such. u/[Ne0nP1nk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ne0nP1nk/)
---
Mutant Snake: I originally made a idea based around this, but it never saw light, as I converted the snake hydra into a skink (small lizard) hydra. I say something could be done though. u/[Ne0nP1nk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ne0nP1nk/)
---
Snakehead Monster: Hell yeah. It would make a lot of sense for the Chinese to be making there own mutants. A snakehead is the perfect candidate! u/[Ne0nP1nk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ne0nP1nk/)
---
I'm not a big fan of the full set, But the helmet looks pretty good with the Plague rider power armor.

"Apparel: Fixed an issue in which some Apparel items were incorrectly providing +1 Damage Resistance when equipped."
---
Ah man... I was getting 4 extra DR by wearing a helmet, bottlecap glasses, prison collar, and wedding ring.  :-P
---
Would love to see thing fix undone, it made me dive back into my apparel for new outfits.
---
He already said he did this beciuse he is lazy
---
In the Sell interface they should change it to have a same button for setting up an item in both sides of the interface. Maybe it's only me, but it's not very intuitive design currently.
---
This happens to me all the time with sneak attacks. I shoot a mob and land a sneak attack but then the mob regains all the sneak attack damage back. Mostly happens in high lag areas like the SBQ fight making it so I have to switch to a support role since I can't do damage.
---
I installed the 8.5gb patch and am able to start the game so I really doubt it is the console patch. Obviously not able to get into the world since servers are still down though.
---
Bethesda really has no idea on how to interact with it's player base giving there customer support is a joke, they routinely do things that benefit them at the loss of the player base. And ultimately they charged us 60$ bucks to beta test a game for them.
---
I've noticed I can't vats the SBQ with my hammer. Does that mean I'm not doing any damage when I'm swinging away while she's on the ground?
---
I'm on a xbox, but when I was having issues, I reinstalled the game and everything seemed to clear up. Probs holds true for PS4, too. You will lose your photos, though. They do suggest a couple steps here: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/42916/\~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-ps4%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42916/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-ps4%3F)
---
Man half of your comments are edited afterwards, you realize that those don't show up in the initial reply unless you go directly to the comment.  Right?
---
*puts on tin foil hat*
---
Maybe they already did...
---
Did they actually fix that? I haven't seen a patch drop since my wife lost a 3\* to that event. We avoid it like the plague, now.
---
I got few, on xbox gt fellowtankmain1
---
Four leaf clover is redundant at your luck and having critical savy. You could put that point elsewhere.
---
I’m sure you know this no longer a thing.
---
I'm pretty sure that there are platforms where the missiles actually come out of nearby the entrances. I remember seeing the Silo A one.
---
Why not give us the option to repair with resources, buy basic one, or fight to get improved ones?
---
Even airlines - the customer-unfriendly organizations around next to cable companies - know better than to pull this crap too much and will often honor mistake fares.
---
Caring about your customers - fine, fix the bug, but then put the topiaries in atom shop for free for like the next month.
---
"F\*\*\* you" companies (Bethesda, Comcast, etc.) - give us our f\*\*\*\*\*\* money.
---
I want to be able to open another app, such as Netflix or Hulu. That is a good tip for when I'm milling around cleaning though.
---
I have done this quest solo 5 times now on 5 different characters ranging from lvl42 to lvl56.
---
First time around, must have been early December, was with a bog standard T-60 PA and an All Rise.
---
Getting to the cave was a bit 'iffy' because 'back then' SBs used to play 'ground is lava' and never run out of breath then on land the acid spit of the MLQs would just two/three shot you.
---
Took a couple of attempts to get there but after that the cave was... unremarkable. I was just going around picking ultracite ore like picking flowers on a prairie.
---
Once the 'final boss' spawned she decided 'fuck this shit, this guy has a sledgehammer' and flew through the wall never to be seen again.
---
Take two, more of the same; this time she stayed so I bashed her head in until she yielded.
---
Successive toons have been... barely an inconvenience. There has been the unarmed toon, the heavy weapons toon, the shotgunner toon and the rifleman/commando toon. No legendaries, just stuff I could craft with Toon #1.
---
I suggest if you are struggling just go melee. I was taking on lvl60+ scorched with a lvl20 toon and death tambo just to speed up levelling a bit.
---
Thanks, nice to have something to read while we wait for it going online again :)
---
Btw, that is the exact backpack mod i am wating for, crossing fingers that it will be in there when we log on :)
---
Mine is 1.1.5.4 on PC after it finished.
---
You may have to server hop but they are definitely out there, usually a few hundred caps per serum from what I have seen.
---
Then no you can't
---
It would make my life so much easier. It's so stressful worrying about having the right cards on all the time.
---
I usually leave a few in my vendor but I can get 500 for them from station vendors and players don't seem to want to pay that much
---
their loss, would be irrational of me to sell them for less
---
I name them after people that fit the build. On my sniper, I named him Simo Hayha, after the Finnish sniper "White Death". My power armor heavy weapon build, I named it Tank Dempsey, after the COD zombies guy who just seems like he would use power armor :)
---
I mean Bethesda called it a season, not me. I think the notifications imply we might be getting other 'seasons'.
---
As far as I know they fixed it but I've never done the event, I wasn't taking any chances, I've heard enough horror stories of it that it has put me off trying it lol
---
Yeah I’ve done that and nothing. I even booted the ps4 in safe mode and did the rebuild option incase something was corrupt but that didn’t work either. Thanks though any help is good.
---
Was hoping they'd have figured a fast travel mat out with today's patch. Wasn't exactly holding my breath but a man can dream!
---
Not sure I could rebuild mine as it is right now, I was amazed I got it to work at all &amp; don't really remember how. But I do know my initial spawn point is in the middle of my main house foundation, goody.
---
Thing is I've had my alt fast travel on my main, show up in the foundation &amp; promptly get pushed up onto the floor. Fast travel to a camp via beacon &amp; I get stuck. Wonder if it's fallout (heh) from the recent changes to foundation.
---
Reddit; fighting the raider scourge one downvote at a time.
---
I sell marsupial and speed demon at the moment, about 400 caps each
---
I have had the exact issue with the explosive gatling gun (not the regen issue mentioned in the other comments). To fix it, I modded it, removed the custom name, I then traded it to a friend and got it back.  
---
 I do not know which of the above fixed it, but it is now fixed and its not done it again since.
---
Thanks. I have updated my post, I'm on PC.
---
I have 13 different serums in mine, including Twisted Muscles. They are out there.  Keep looking.
---
Thanks, nice to have something to read while we wait for it going online again.
---
Btw, that is the exact backpack mod i am waiting for, crossing fingers for it to be there when be get back online ;)
---
They need to be specifically the unruly ghouls and they wouldn’t spawn until after three hours after a nuke has happened. Your best bet is to go into survival mode as no one nukes whitesprings bin survival
---
Wellp. i have no idea what is freaking going on at this point. having already canceled the DL i'm gonna wait for bethesda to actually reply before i risk it i think
---
Yes, I had a whole run one day where every other legendary had 2 legendaries in it. Was a smorgasbord
---
Weak
---
To be honest, I’m not even sure where I originally put the camp down. Either it was on top of a rock and a perfect fast travel spot, or it’s now under a layer of wood and possibly a problem.
---
That is not the case for me. Patch is installed and at least according to the launcher the correct patch.
---
There really isn't. It's the same for 99% of phone scams where they call elderly people and tell them their grandkids are in jail/need bail money or that they are the IRS on the way to arrest them.
---
They call enough phone numbers, and they eventually find an elderly person with mild dementia they can scare into paying them.
---
And they perform these scams from outside the country they scam.... so very hard to prosecute.
---
Out of all the things they could put their energy into this is personally at the very bottom of my list.
---
We need spawn mats BADLY.
---
I'm sure there is, i just cant picture it.  I'm gunna have to go check now lol
---
\&gt;  At the end of the day my first point still stands, you're a salty player who refuses (for some unknown reason) to run the clearly strongest build   
---
Because there shouldn't be a single build that stands insanely above the rest, I didn't use TSE and I won't use Bloodied.  I don't give a shit if you do it alone, but when you're in a group one shotting everything you ruin it for everyone else. This is going to be even more true when dungeons come out if Bloodied/Low hp is still dealing insane damage one shotting things that a group is supposed to be fighting.
---
I'm constantly accidentally removing things from my stash i'm trying to sell, it's very unintuitive.
---
Bonus points for when my stash is maxed out, it lets me accidentally take something out, but not put it back in to sell it :-/
---
You’re doing damage. I’ve noticed you can only hit her in vats if she has landed and you’re all up in her.
---
I am disappointed. I liked us Adventure Mode ppl being able to complete the Survival challenges and get the rewards, instead of missing out. A lot of us have no interest or intention to go into PvP but it feels like we're missing out on getting a neat reward that isn't available in Adventure Mode playing. If Adventure Mode got a weekly reward challenge or something that'd be nice.  
---
I'm happy about the inspect fix for vendors. That will help tons. No more needing to idle at your base to sell stuff. 
---
I hope we can get a fix for the melee bugs ASAP. We can't target any flying enemy even when it's at waist height or on landing in front of you. It really impacts us melee players.
---
And some fix for the legendary vendor giving wood that reverts to one stars. It feels like such a waste of legendary currency when it happens.
---
In Belgium with my data limit, these updates are getting annoying. That means less porn to watch...
---
i've tried game after long time...Ok still happen to me dude
---
IN the meanwhile, 7 month already passed, without a big expansion. They release new content...a crumb at time...a crumb at time. Maybe F76 will get a proper expansion......when will be too late. Game have not a good reputation since day one.
---
I almost built my camp there! That rock formation is so cool, I thought it would make a great entrance. But the lack of water nearby made me change my mind.
---
Where is the silver Handmade skin?!
---
I did this to move my installation from a HDD to an SSD. Dramatically improved performance.
---
 Seems like a great price to me.
---
4.9 gigs for me on x1 not that im complaining
---
This is where I was finally able to complete it as well, post-patch.
---
Why? Just think of it as an item preview ...
---
Not just the mod kits, I don't think I've seen plans for any Dense mods being sold by any vendor. Wasn't that supposed to have been addressed?
---
Since we're on the topic of armor, where are the plans for Raider and robot armor?
---
He's off to a better place.
---
RIP Yao Guai.
---
... Freak show? Looks like I have some more exploring to do.
---
Watch out for the players who think they can charge the same price as the enclave, serums shouldn't be going for any higher than 400 caps, 200-300 is the norm.
---
I have almost every serum on sale for 249 and they are not selling. Pretty weird.
---
Bethesda didnt even pay for the game to be tested let alone paying people to write good shit about it, lol
---
FOUR TIMES THE DETAIL
---
PC, have them all, IGN eweneric once servers are up
---
Technical issues are better.
---
I built an elaborate shrine to my kitty bush.
---
 My present char was born to farm the Handmade, way back when. He knows how. ;) Thanks eh;.
---
Commando allows you to unload a whole mag quickly. It gives you an extra Crit or 2 per mag (of 20). It’s worth it for me.
---
This Davey bloke is to blame for me getting into this addicting game!
---
65.6 gigs on x1
---
Right but what they're saying is that it was Bethesda's mess up. It should remain free, not charge ppl for it after many used it for free already.
---
No most likely not
---
Supposedly the fast-travel Welcome Mat was removed because people were using it to glitch into locked areas.
---
Ps4
---
Only thing I know of that reduces rifle weights are legendary armor pieces with a 20% weapon weight reduction. I have one and it reduces every weapon by 20%.
---
The only time it's beneficial for me to even bother with cooking is when I have a bunch of meat I've picked up and I need my daily caps. Recipes are so disappointing and just filler to me.
---
100Mb fiber optic ethernet \*shrug \* 
---
I think the game has some rudimentary anti-cheat which gets triggered when you fling too far
---
Oooh, very nice. Cool idea.
---
You may want to check your sources on how airlines treat passengers. 
---
Canada had to pass actual legislation to ensure customers who had flights delayed, cancelled or were denied a spot due to over booking would be compensated....
---
And airlines fought this new legislation.
---
&gt; quit being condescending to others for the natural game play progression.
---
Dude, You've been nothing but condescending in every single comment you've made. Why don't you take your own advice.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Just make sure your console is set to stay connected to the internet in rest mode
---
i don‘t know, i see people all the time. like when i‘m trying to sneak in a dark factory and someone in power armor comes stomping in. people everywhere.
---
I do. I love my pickaxe! The skins even match my power armor!
---
Stealth Archer 1, Stealth Archer 2, Stealth Archer 3....

oh yes - very important step :)
---
Brofist to fellow Arizona vault dweller
---
I thought that was obvious but yes.
---
Yup, didn't register here either.
---
Where did you hear that? I must have missed that piece of lore.
---
Cuz people like me are always checking, sorry m8. 😉
---
Or maybe we could just use the million refrigerators scattered about?
---
This is the main reason why I DON'T set my profile to say I'm offline.
---
Vats ones for me.
---
I'm glad there's nothing in there that I want. That way I can keep grinding Atoms for a bit longer.
---
Any idea how long downtime will be? Had a good 3 hours set aside to dig in but only got an hour in before the downtime
---
Really? The backpack looks pretty crappy to me, whereas the one they brought out last week I thought was really cool.
---
Almost heaven, West Virginia...
---
mine almost always go for 300 eventually, usually dont have to wait for long until they’re all gone. might depend on what serums you’re selling tho, not all of them are popular
---
Scattershot
---
Not true. It reduces gauss rifle damage and that does ballistic damage but is considered a energy weapon.
---
I did the same recently. The performance issues I had at launch are completely gone. Can even run it on my older laptop which was getting about 5 fps back in November.
---
Really feel like the last patch is about exactly where the game should have been at launch.  On top of how the game runs, player vending has me exploring other people's camps rather than avoiding them and that has been a literal game changer.
---
Having played every single Fallout, this one is slowly creeping it's way up my list of favorite entries in the series. Hope they keep up the pace!
---
&gt;World: Building a frog habitat now correctly counts toward Herpetologist World Challenge progress.
---
That's the only challenge fix? What about the stimpack-diffuser thing? Medic can't be completed.
---
Wears PA, cusses a lot lol your defiantly a console guy!
---
Ha. They didn't forget, just not a priority like the grass cat.
---
Two shot and anti-armor can't be on the same legendary. They're both prefix modifiers. Maybe you meant AAE?
---
I hope they listen to the pvp community. It's just not worth it to play survival mode now and for many is the only real end game content.
---
A S C E N D E D
---
Non bulked junk aswell.
---
I think its because it splits the item into 2. So for example if you have 100 steel and are selling 50 it tags 50 for sale but puts it on the top of the junk list. It then seems to pull from that one first, they need to add it so tagged for sale items are unusable unless you cancel the sale manually.
---
Where is that cave exacly??
---
I found the mod for sale at a robot vendor recently.
---
If you have bought some of the skull deco you can place them at your friends camps, which you can't do with any other shop item. Found this one out yesterday. Now all my frienda have raider camps.
---
I've had it happen several times, but it's usually just two (occasionally three) pieces. Since te last patch I've also noticed that nuked enemies will frequently drop multiple pieces of hardened mass or glowing mass, when in the past I don't recall ever getting more than 1. Oddly enough, it doesn't seem to happen with the high rad fluids...
---
Darn
---
Shh! Don't mock the peasants, it's rude!
---
I dunno I can't even hit her on the ground. I don't have the vats perk where I can target parts so it just locks onto her body but it's to high off the ground and vats stays 0%
---
If you're on PC, you can select one object with the spacebar, but place the other end using E. Prevents you from jumping like crazy if the system doesn't like the connection.
---
*Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 5.5 GB for consoles and under 1 GB for PC.* 
---
8.5GB is not under 1GB... just saying...
---
Don’t know why people downvoted you. I keep mine in my vending machine for usually 450-650 depending on which. I don’t care to sell it from my machine when I can sell to vendors for 500c. Some days I’ll lower the price as a sale but I’m not a charity, I paid a lot for the recipes. If I’m selling here I sell for the average price or a lot of times give them free (check my history, I’ll happily help people). But that’s when I choose, I’m not playing to help the world. They aren’t going to do the same for me
---
Yeah half the challenges are bugged
---
I've noticed this as well.
---
I'm pretty confident that Beth's plan is to wait until they are confident that all the players have exhausted the Atoms that they can reasonably get for free, THEN give us a bunch of stuff that would be actively bought by lots of players, ensuring that money was spent to get them.
---
then we'll see skins for handmades, and 50cal and 10mm, etc etc etc
---
Seeing as I've always figured they're too damned expensive, and I have zero attachment to pre-war money...sure why the hell not
---
multiple means more than 1... 
---
5 is more than 1...
---
I have the cat topiary and I don't remember buying it nor do I have less atoms then before
---
You realize that just by playing
---
I had it happen on one server the other night, pop a mutant in the face watch it scream back up. Hasn't happened since luckily but I did have it happen.
---
Why is it, everytime I hear some dickhead say snowflake, it's right in the middle of a bitch session? Quit your fucking crying. Wa wa my videogame is broken.
---
yup
---
My 3 Star BE Lever action cost me roughly 15k. For my build it's the best weapon available. So, it is definitely worth it to me.
---
I did a breakdown of the math and didn't find much extra benefit. On occasion it let change the crit cycle from crit-normal-normal-crit to crit-normal-crit. Maybe one rank is enough for you to enjoy the difference. However I used to run full ranks in crit savy and flc and dropped flc without much combat effectiveness.
---
PC update better is giving us Behemoth companions that get oddly aroused when in proximity to toasters.
---
Oh yea. Or at cola machines. And newspaper stands. And claw machines. I want to rebuild the nuka cola plant.... nope i need to make a new post. Thanks for the inspiration!
---
Love the imput...  I said the snapping turtle.. haha... a radbadger could be like the molerat broodmothers...
---
I think this would be a great idea. Also, since the pre-war economy was crap, they could make things cost TONS of pre-war money.
---
but not mole miners for some reason
---
I feel like for number 1 it's fine as it is because if there was a penalty then low levels would be at an even higher disadvantage than they already are
---
I play on a team a lot so I use my mic all the time. If I’m playing by myself I don’t, but can quickly put it on if I need to talk to someone. I find it much more convenient than chat/messaging.

Whitesprings, just go south of golf club
---
That's very difficult technically, even if it's just flat paint color. Each skin has to be custom made to fit a specific model.
---
Spot on. Have you seen the rocket league subreddit? It's absolutely incredible with feedback and patches get their own sticky. 2 of them actually. One has the full list of patch notes, the other is for bug reports. Psyonix devs' comments are linked in a comment stickied to the top of each mega thread. Everything is fairly open and concise. The free items and events they do are freaking awesome and even though they added the rocket pass, it still offers people with little money the chance to grow their inventory.
---
They actually listen, talk, and interact with the players on their subreddit. The devs using Reddit seem like REAL PEOPLE giving real conversation and answers, not "we are aware of the problem but don't have a time frame yet." Or some generic customer service response. On top of that, the game was only $20.
---
The damage is pretty good but it doesn't have good range you need to be pretty close. This might only be a me problem though because I prefer sniping from afar.
---
Ewww I like it
---

Brainceps, my I ask you what armor you are using? I was in a team with 2 campers 2 nights ago, because I knew one of these guys and he invited me.
---
Then you came. :)
---
One of them rage quitted. .) "He doesnt get ANY damage, ANY!! 0! Fuck it, AltF4"). :)
---
LOL
---
The other guy damaged you but he said it's incredible what you can take. So I'm really interested in your gear. :)

Until you realize that each new bug fix patch comes with new bugs.

Solved codes can be found here if you ever need them.
---
Have you restarted the launcher? That is pretty weird.
---
If you got them from their mistake, you're cool.
---
There was a time you could use the atomic skins for the cooking and weapons stations. They fixed it but if you had them already, you still do. 
---
No bans for this.
---
Unpopular opinion ahead:
---
No thanks. I like that it takes hundreds of hours for your muscle memory to learn which perks to swap out in different contexts. I like that players without this experience are at a slight disadvantage timewise than me. This is one of the little perks (pardon the pun) of having ~~wasted my life~~ spent so much time playing.
---
You're right but I think missing the original point 
---
Yes they need to charge to maintain income and servers, even if this wasn't necessary Bethesda would still do it because its good business but it's the manner in which they conduct this.
---
For example the topiaries, they accidentally gave them to players for free, now they had a few options;
---
-Remove them from the players and sell them as intended
---
-Let the players keep them in good faith and will
---
-Let any player who has it, keep it and charge for future players
---
As players we're not really upset if they take them away (although it does suck) we're upset that this is more of a priority over issues that damage player experience and gameplay because from the outside it looks like they care more about small change (that honestly from this single item means nothing to Bethesda in the grand scheme) then they do about their players and the state of the game.
---
No matter your view on the game or Bethesda you can't deny that since day one they have poorly handled the state of the game and issues from players.
---
It's poor taste from such a major company and franchise leaving a bitter taste
---
Yeah I’ve been experiencing this a ton lately with other players while on survival worlds. Quite frustrating but nothing I can really do about it I guess. Kinda annoying when I get a critical with my hunting rifle, they drop to zero health, and then it just instantly revert right back to wherever their health was prior. They then proceed to take more shots with only some of them counting. I’m usually fine with dying, but it’s a little tilting when you know you should’ve been able to win a fight the game cheats from you. I haven’t experienced it much on PvE enemies yet, because I just made a new character after coming back to the game and I haven’t hit level 50 on it yet.
---
Thanks man, I already have the plans, but the damage is just nowhere near the LA.  It's a good gun, it's just a shame it's not a bit more powerful
---
Maybe not enough people complain about one but more so the other so they only notice so many 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
---
Lol, I wasn't mocking, just pointing out that not all of us play on little small machines that have limited capabilities... lol I'm kidding. It's not the size of your machine its the motion of the... loadscreen?
---
Lol that'd be a completely different context anywhere but here.
---
Yes. This is very annoying.
---
Ad hominem means “attack the man”. Insults are attacking the man, not his position. So yes. They are an ad hominem.
---
Do you know what isn’t an ad hominem? Asking someone if they know the backstory and lore to a game. Lots of people play a game without ever knowing the backstory. I played the Witcher 3 without ever having played the others. Knew nothing of the back story. Or lore. Still enjoyed it.
---
Do you understand the difference now?
---
Totally disappointing patch. One new event also....pppff. The game NEEDS a big expansion and a proper endgame ASAP.
---
They attempted that for about the first month when the game was released.
---
That would basically ruin the point of survival mode
---
Hey! Love your channel. If you started a "rate my build" thread we'd probably see a load of creative build ideas all in one spot.
---
I have noticed allot of bodies returning to their spawn point when they gooify. Sometimes they on rare occasion they go back in a t pose instead of goo pile.
---
I wish they would sticky this post
---
Yeah, it came back. Been doing it to my explosive handmade
---
Advanced conduits just need to cost less resource. I couldn't afford to wire my camp the way I wanted and had to settle for ugly hanging wires and connectors hanging everywhere.
---
Will give it a try again but tried twice
---
In PvP maybe that can explained by the serendipity perk?
---
Thank you. I guess that makes sense. As long as the mods don't give you the upper hand, they're fine.
---
Man i don't know.they must be keeping it for some crysis or something. It was leaked in march. Nothing that was leaked didn't hit the shop.
---
Ah, mind telling me what that does exactly?
---
Yarp. Also a filthy casual who doesn't PVP and has no aspirations to be an elite level player. *shrug*

what they really need to do is simply make your perks apply to the stash as well (and then make it so that they cant be removed if it would push you over the stash limit)
---
Tuesday is a bad day to launch a nuke because the codes are never all solved by then.
---
Something funky certainly going on.
---
I still from time to time will have my camp turrets just vanish, wires still attached but they are connected to nothing
---
oof someone is triggered

You can add me, my id is Need-More-Games

 [u/BethesdaGameStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_/) how is it that your company continues to come out with patches but can't do simple QA to ensure you don't have issues like the issue where players couldn't inspect player vending items unless the owner was nearby? This is repeatedly an issue, something where the community should not be happy about the correction in this update as the issue ***shouldn't have made it out in the patch to begin with.***
---
I just want the fixer skin to be available for the normal combat rifles
---
Huh, are you on PC? I have a feeling it has something to do with an ini setting. I upgraded my GPU not too long ago and changed my ini settings to increase the game's quality. I did not see this graphical glitch with my old GPU and ini settings.
---
Less Intelligence and more Agility and you're there
---
On PC here. Updated downloaded and installed but servers are still down
---
Awesome! I’ll be home shortly so I’ll add you then!
---
Holy necro Mr Mothman.
---
Just dropping a very late 'thank you'.
---
Was struggling to find Him for a challenge, found him under the bridge as you successfully predicted.
---
Makes you auto pop a stimpak when brought down to a certain point in health
---
Everyone should have Nuka Tapper, but I see your point. Maybe combine our ideas?
---
People on this sub are some of the most passionate pricks on the site.
---
Couldn't you just post better pictures on imgur instead of this?
---
I normally see it go for that, and the checked price if the item is around there bud. Its not a rare item by any means.
---
Well now I'm confused.... screw it 2.5k caps it is
---
i run lots of weight reduction, and trying to sell flux and ammo is a nightmare
---
Calmer than you are.
---
That is an addon you use to script out the item types?
---
Does it show weapon types too? What it is called?
---
Should I lower gunsmith?
---
And PLANTERS please Bethesda! I'm sick of relying on camp spots with dirt for farming
---
I wouldnt. My camp has been there since beta.  It would be a no build zone then
---
to the person this happened to, DON'T DROP YOUR POWER ARMOR!  you drop things you don't want anymore, deploy your powerarmor, don't drop
---
If they had just deployed, the armor would have come back to them in 2 minutes no matter where they are.  Since they dropped it, other people could take the parts.
---
Doesn’t need to be rare bud. Just needs to sell for what you’re asking for.
---
Thank you so much for that link
---
People consistently pay 6-10k for a good 3 star. I've sold several and bought several. There's an unspoken but very well known pricing. on just about everything. Any TSE 3 star is gonna be 6-7k for the most part. Is it duped? Maybe. I don't really care.
---
Thanks, do you recall which one?
---
Absolutely. It was... fun trying to finish one off with a syringer for the Hunter Tadpole badge.
---
Perhaps, and I guess that makes me a snowflake too. We can all be snowflakes and bitch and yell at each other all day.
---
I'm pretty damn nightblind as well and that translates to games too. On tv the brightness is turned up but that can start making the contrast look funky. Maybe they could introduce some night vision glasses for our characters. Then us nightblinds can see and everyone else can enjoy the dark.
---
It sounds like you’re not scrapping everything before it goes into your stash. If you make a habit of scrapping all your junk before you put it I. There it breaks it down to its components so you’ll know what you have and it saves a ton of space.  
---
I highly recommend pulling all your junk out and heading to a workbench and using the “scrap all junk” function. Make note, certain items that are required to craft things like assualtron heads, beer bottles, etc. will not auto scrap, you have to manually do it.
---
Hey why don't you join the brotherhood? We do events every weekend!

---
Do you have a plan on when you're going to fix the Early Warnings 0/5 motors crafted bug? It's been roughly 200 days since the game launched and still no fix.
---
Hey I’ve been looking at other peoples posts and it looks like Bethesda brought the dmg bug back that’s probably why you couldn’t kill the guy
---
For me i either spawn to the left of my camp out of the camp ring, or i spawn where i placed my camp. One time when i built my camp close to the edge on a mountain i would always drop to my death if i forgot to put my power armor on. Only thing is i never let my camp ring go over the edge just near it.
---
Definitely not that, as there’s no “healing” time so to speak. It’s just an instant revert of health. You know how when a stimpak is popped, it usually heals that first bit and then slowly heals over time. There’s usually no regen, even after a follow up shot where the stim would still be active. Maybe that’s just me being weird and the stims work differently when activated like that.
---
I’ll have a look ! Thank you
---
Sorry, I meant that it has the Stinging receiver, not anti-armor as a modifier.
---
FUCK FLUX FOR PRE-WAR TECH. 
---
Seriously? How much flux was used to make your refrigerator?
---
What do you think you can type on a keyboard that can make me care about what you think?
---
Hahaha maybe the factory could be the workshop inside. You'd just be super close to a new event spawn? Idk, this one would be big and take at least a year.
---
Logging in!
---
I just got this combo, and it often does literally zero damage.  Silly.
---
If they're regenerating all damage after a short period, I'm seeing that occasionally but with any weapon. Curiously damage over time effects (fire DoT from my plasma flamer) does stick. Logging out and back in is the only solution I've found.
---
Yeah i'm hoping that more bugs get fixed than new bugs get introduced
---
I think thats a result of the fix for heavy weapons firing right through enemies that are at point blank in front of you that was added a few patches ago.
---
Even if so the result of being able to hit them is still ocasionally innefective, and this behavour also triggers when there's some world geometry a bit lower down in front of you.
---
Those Energy / Power perks aren't necessary if you're running VATS rifles. Unless you're using Power Armor, but that's a whole different problem. Tanky Players with Power Armor can benefit from perks but if you're doing a VATS build, you need Powered (AP Refresh) armor pieces so you likely wont need PA. Also, consider Sturdy Frame instead of Strong Back, as you can mitigate the low carry weight with a Backpack
---
Yes it's back. Was attacked by mole rats at Ft. Defiance and got them down to 1 percent health and it shot right back up.  I've encountered this with blood bugs too, which is a yet another bug left over from Fallout 4.
---
Are there recipes with salt cause so far salt and pepper are useless to pick up.
---
Wa wa my games broken
---
Lets raid arcos plasmatos
---
Time and resource limits? Also, idk if those are the "description changed for clarity" bits they mentioned.
---
Preach. Though i really want to see the bug fixes first before we get new content

No way.  You can't just print money.  Nuka Cola = caps.

I’ll add you when I’m home, thanks !

I've played a medic extensively since last year and although this is purely anecdotal it appears to me that the heal is flat and activates per hit. What this means is that guns that fire either multiple hits-per-shot or shoot rapidly have a very clear advantage over single hit-per-shot weapons and slower rate-of-fire weapons. Based on my own testing I ended up using a medic's shotgun as my primary healing weapon because with two vats crits I can heal nearly anyone from nearly empty to full (one vats crit with a shotgun is A LOT of healing - better than a diluted stim pack with no perks but slightly worse than a regular stimpak with no perks). On occasion I will use a medic's 10mm submachine gun and just hold down spacebar (vats crit) while firing rapidly and while it works well enough it's nowhere near what the shotgun can do (if you are near enough to me to get the medic's effect you will never need a stimpak again). Here is the build that I use and it works very well and I've received a lot of compliments for it: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=86345ff&amp;d=sd0so0sp0su2pc2as2ic4p02cf2eh2cu0sg1a72am2au2ar1ao0l71lu2lv2lt2lr2l10&amp;w=p10pa0p80p90ej2c72ev0ct1ck0c52cr0cc0cq0i30ia0i50ii0ij2ik0if2i71ie2iq2im1ih2in1a40a31ag2an2lm2le0lg0lp0l20l40l90lb0la0lf0&amp;n=Toazd%20Shotgun%20Medic&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=86345ff&amp;d=sd0so0sp0su2pc2as2ic4p02cf2eh2cu0sg1a72am2au2ar1ao0l71lu2lv2lt2lr2l10&amp;w=p10pa0p80p90ej2c72ev0ct1ck0c52cr0cc0cq0i30ia0i50ii0ij2ik0if2i71ie2iq2im1ih2in1a40a31ag2an2lm2le0lg0lp0l20l40l90lb0la0lf0&amp;n=Toazd%20Shotgun%20Medic&amp;m=)  (note that this build link is not up to date with my testing and also hasn't been updated with the new features of the build site but it should give you a general idea of how you can run a powerful group healer that can easily handle anything on it's own - as a side note, this is the only other build besides my bloodied pole hook melee than can do sub-8 minute silo runs reliably).
---
This is something I'd really love man!
---
OP lack of effort in posting is on the same level of the series finale of GoT
---
He probably got reported by you no need to flex
---
Alternately, plant a few crops like blackberries or mutfruit, have the double-plant harvest perk.
---
Boiled water is free, basically. Craft lots of juice - you're good to go. At least enough to get by in between collecting Purified Water everywhere or at other peoples' camps.
---
If they have a bloodied build they would jump right back up to their max, I think. I could be wrong. Never used the perk or a bloodied build
---
That would be nice.
---
I've only had full suits disappear
---
a common problem in mmo games and why this never shoulda been one
---
You mean, all the Nuka grenades a man could want, I’m in...
---
Obviously you don't get to keep the ones you make. You just get to work there.
---
I'd like a quest to start brewing coffee and making donuts (similar to the creation club Slocums Joe's items) that will let us craft coffee from siltbeans and donuts from razorgrain flour.  Even better, they could have a robot (my vote goes to a sassy assaultron in an apron) reopening the Slocums Joe on the road to Morgantown as a quest location and player hub.
---
I think it happens only when the target has full health but i'm not sure
---
Your post isn't clear - are you talking about the original item (like a typewritter) or the component it breaks down to? They are both junk.
---
If it's the later, I don't know how you want them to do that. Many components can be used in a lot of different recipes
---
“Where are Yao Guai-ing!!”

So when someone comes to visit your house you offer them the hose? ;)

Thanks!!!

Serums sell for 300-400 on the website that shall not be named and apparently they get all huffy when you point out "but that doesn't make any sense, I can literally get more from selling to a vendor." The market price is what it is because of duping and I guess they get defensive.
---
Stimpaks for example sell for 7 each. But you can just sell them to a vendor for 10. The only time this is a problem is if you have a ridiculous number of stimpaks because you're a duper. No judgment but if you're just playing the game casually you will never have so many stimpaks that it would make sense for you to sell them for less than 10 caps.
---
One of the people I hung out with during the beta was a duper and he gave me some cool stuff for free and was nice. I'm not judging. I'm just, you know, pointing out obvious things.
---
I wonder if it’s similar to the old bug with explosive weapons
---
If you arent close enough to smell the fart trapped in their pants from five minutes ago then shotguns arent worth a damn now.
---
I mean knowing Bethesda and its previous Fallout games, bugs are one of those 'features' we have to get used to.
---
Well.... now I know why I keep spawning inside. And inside foundations....
---
Back to Appalachia it is!

Ya got me, now report mine too. Ya little bitch.
---
My visitors spawn just outside the circle, underground, or in mid air just off a large cliff... sorry guys
---
The pictures shown are not picture files (jpg, png etc.) they are texture files which bethesda is using like pictures for the atomic shop, so if i uploaded just the files to imgur, (i’m not sure if imgur would even accept them) most people would not be able to see what they are because you need a specifif plugin for image editing to see them. (I used a plugin for gimp, because photoshop is expensive)
---
Last patch (9). The patch before that one (8.5) was where the camera, along with the bug, was added.
---
I try to let everyone get a shot in, but too many times this has happened to me so I said fuck it and if I one shot it oh well.
---
I think it's very server dependent. I was thinking this same thing last night, server hopped, took ages &amp; ages again.
---
Fingers crossed though it is fixed.
---
Yeah, I forgot about them as well until I went to repair a weapon and saw that I had 16 of them...probably more now as I’ve fought the SBQ a few times since then. I did use one during a SBQ fight on my Axe. It was definitely convenient.
---
Don't know about that one
---
Bethesda has a problem with their code where you have to redownload the whole of the game to implement some patches... Some other developers are similar
---
Fallout... the game where we want to live in rusty fucking shitholes instead if the nice modern buildings available to us.
---
Why dont the mole miners use then religiously 🤔
---
Hallelujah!!!
---
I wish I could share.
---
100% was murder simulator 2019.

We'd love to have ya! Just make sure when you accept the invite that you let elder Robledo know Healey sent ya!
---
Tbh. Before the Purveyor and even after the Purveyor, a 1 star legendary isnt a big deal. I'd get upset if it was 2*+, but most of the time these new events have 1* drops. Like the one at campfire tales. Don't get me wrong, sure its annoying, but to me, in the end its just a worthless 1*, usually only worth like 3-10ish scrip by most (really only good if your trying to get every scrip you can.)
---
I don't mind a few bugs but some are really, really awful
---
half of mine have names the other half are named shit like ammo and rifleman
---
Cool, will post a message in the #general channel now
---
If you know of a way to convert these to jpeg or
---
Png, i would be happy to do that instead next time.
---
Did a quick search on medic tadpole badge. Is there a stimpak diffuser, or any mention of a stimpak diffuser in the notes?
---
Also, will it soon count as "killing the scorchbeast queen" in challenges when we kill the scorchbeast queen? There are multiple regular challenges that don't register when objective is completed, fixing these would be great for solo players since so many daily challenges are now not for solo players.
---
These regular challenge bugs have been around since November if I'm not mistaken.
---
That's definitely encouraging.  I'll keep sifting and searching.
---
Whatever it is i hope it is not like the burrows. Cuz i want a fight and a dungeon like glassed cavern, not whitesprings golf club 2
---
Tormentor R3 for any Stealth Commando
---
Survivalist 2 outfit hasn’t dropped yet. It was data mined. I’m pretty sure there’s a few more also. 
---
Ones that haven’t been data mined are the yellowish firefighters uniform, divers suit, tire armor outfit.
---
If my mattress isnt slightly sticky, moist, dry, and crunchy all at the same time from the blood that has dripped onto it out of the corpse nailed to the ceiling above I'm not happy.
---
Do this sometimes when cleaning my room- take over fusion core processor, leave game alone for 10 mins at a time while cleaning up. Only hard part is when defend events pop up and you’re afk
---
Look how well that worked.
---
My main machine has an 8.5gig update, my laptop (with 11gb free) is asking for a 60gb+ download.
---
So rifle, but not sneaking?  
---
I guess I'd suggest skipping the power armor and using those Intelligence points differently.  Five points of Gunslinger are pretty worthwhile, plus maybe a couple points of Demolition if you have an explosive weapon.
---
Oh yeah, we did that too.  5 glassed cavern runs over 5 days (the containers seem to be on the infamous 20 hour refresh) and no luck there either.
---
I don’t think this will ever stop. Most people are thinking, “If I don’t 1 shot him, the guy next to me will”
---
I do campfire for the badge. The lowbies can have the lvl 20 legendary.
---
Awesome, i will. Tjats a whole part of the game ive been missin out on since the game came out lol
---
Rad-X suppresses all mutations.  Rad-X diluted and RadShield do not.  This is normal.
---
Thanks for heads up but yea not to much hype for these items.
---
So add legendary PA. I'm all for it.
---
I love it when people try to tell me how to play.  cute
---
it's not my job to make sure other players get hits in on legendaries.  It's my job to enjoy the game, and if that means one-shotting an enemy, so be it.
---
Some players (myself included) are thrilled about an influx of random people poking around their camps. I spend a lot of time building around in-game content and making my purified water and etc. free for everyone. 
---
But sometimes the awesome stuff to build around (exa: boat, monorail car) isn't in a super visible location, so prior to vending I didn't reliably get many visitors. 
---
I sometimes even invite random visitors to join a team if I'm feeling social. I never felt comfortable going down a list of names and inviting people from it.
---
no some people in this sub are childish trolls who will downvote anything regardless
---
welcome back
---
Stimpaks not so true, I sometimes do loads of events an have 100+ of them. Those are pretty easy to get, most times I drop a bunch inside the dead body outside the vault for new players. But serums yeah that takes much more to get the items needed, I’m not going to give away all of them. I like to help out but in order to get good things you can’t be giving hand outs 24/7
---
Ummm... What? Lol
---
not sure why you are getting downvoted.  this is truth.  76 should never have been mmo.
---
If you're on PC, please give me all your legendary marine armor drops. I don't want you to have to deal with them since they're such garbage.
---
it just ridiculous these two item have be ''free'' for more that two week and now they decide to ''fix'' them by adding them in the store
---
Yea I need to edit this and add in a few more places I’ve found...glad to have helped
---
Okay that's irrelevant in fallout 76. Junk wants to be scrapped now. You can't save anything and you need Everything. If it's for Armor, just favorite it.
---
I feel like Bethesda really screwed up the balancing of the player characters. Shouldn't have let people level up beyond 50 and/or allow card switching imo. Choose a role and build it up. None of this become God of War melee builds.   
---
When the game started I planned on being a traveling merchant, but no one would trade due to the slow interface back then. So I ended up being a team medic and figured I got a good plan with Quack Surgeon, Chemist, and Super Duper, but EVERYONE had the same plan and they can switch to the cards at will. I wasted levels perfecting a medic build when people focused on the PvP and PvE side.
---
That might have been me, lol. I was visiting random camps and got stuck in a couple of them. My tag is HollowRoxyJ.
---
Leave most of your aid in stash too...
---
I would, but 9 times out 10 I'm watching something on my laptop while I play.
---
I think I clear 400 with high cap bag. Bloody/unyielding, though.
---
150 base (right? I forget)
---
60 from STR (12x5 without Unyielding bonus)
---
120 High Cap
---
40 Deep Pockets x 4 (I run dense, but add +20 for chest, right?)
---
20 Marsupial
---
I think I have WR for weapons and junk on legendaries, too.
---
I’m sorry you feel that way, i replied to a similar post explaining the quality, if you know how to convert the texture files to png or jpeg, i would gladly upload the converted images next time.
---
I was running through Whitesprings one day, towards the end of a nuke, and I was leaving crippling all the ghouls as I went so that a friend could catch up and finish them off. 
---
He was flabbergasted to find a room full of 9 ghouls laying around like it was a slumber party, and a trail of them leading across the porches of the condos.
---
I'm with you.  I have checked all shops (with plans anyway) on three different servers, and no luck.  Probably cost a grand in caps travelling, too...
---
Hmmm. I tried to enter the Burrows last night and had the "inaccessible" message. Hopped on another character much later and was able to load in. XB1 here as well.
---
Ya, this has been suggested a few times and a few people seem to have proven it.
---
Not only does it make the sound but the enemy sheds blood...lol
---
I love your recommendation. That clears up two points for me so I am going to try that with enthusiasm.  I also run a point of rad sponge and always play with someone who runs it as well so that combo should do it. Too bad about the silliness with immersion collecting water, though.  Still makes no sense to me.
---
It'd be nice if there was a background modifier to the random number generator that took play hours into account...
---
Depends on platform I think. On Xbox most teams are on a private chat channel so they can't hear or speak to the in-game chat. You can \*choose\* to use the in-game chat, but most people don't. I think it detracts from the game. It's interesting to show up to an event like SBQ or Encryptid and hear the different languages &amp; regional accents.
---
RNG, I guess. This plan and the Ultracite Gatling Laser kill me.
---
A friend of mine just got the Cryo Mine plan and I didn't even know that was a thing. Damn you, RNG.
---
Man, that would be sweet!
---
Also no mention of the random - game freeze after using an aid item, or game freeze after picking a lock.
---
Or the terrain lightin ocasionally being bugged/overbright. 
---
Both started happening a few patches ago now.
---
I was underwhelmed too lol, hopefully it just means that they’re going to start releasing some of the stuff they added previously.
---
Leaving something on a dead body is damn near impossible.
---
Stimpacks diffuser is a new item available with the dungeon/ event just released today
---
Aww, I was hoping the survival challenge would still be glitched till after the deathclaw gauntlet was on offer, I really want that one!
---
I always wanted to be Evel knievel... without the broken bones of course.
---
Omg, where is my creditcard :D
---
Younarent genuinely asking a question. You dont think at all that it is "my job" to boast on here. When 95% of my posts are about everything BUT PvP s isnt "occasional". You are angry that you sae me post twice in e days a bout PvP, which is perfectly ok to do. Stop cherry picking and just admit that your accusation is BS.
---
5 in adrenaline is not ideal.  You should take 1 only (much better per point value) and replace the other four with sneak and escape artist. Strong back is just an awful card.  You'll get more carry weight benefit from travelling pharmacy or bandolier. Critical savvy used to be good but it got nerfed in the first patch.  Now it's a win more card, kind of overkill.
---
some of them are just useless and cost way too many mats to craft. Why on earth would I make a water filter that takes 5 mats from 3 different regions to make 1 purified water I can get 20 of per hour through a purifier? There also needs to be a vending cooler that keeps food available for sale indefinitely but spoils immediately if you take it out to use, but lasts its full life in the buyer's inventory

Reward?
---
I'm not, Legendaries all ready break the game, let alone PvP.
---
I dont donit on purpose 99% of the time. I think events should just give the loot to everyone in the event.
---
So you agree that some for of pre-set perk loadouts is a fair QoL request?
---
You can with the various letters plans. I had the regular letters at a fairly low level, 30 I think
---
Learn to spell and maybe I will!  Have a nice day!
---
Its definitely back from patch 9, not sure if today's helps any.
---
I got nothing. A leather left arm. So I’m not sure.
---
I have not been looking specifically for those, but yeah, now that you mention it, I have never seen one.  A guy in my group finally got the plan for the laser pistol, that's another that's supposed to be really rare, but it did happen.  I think the slight hope is the most painful part!
---
I just have bird bones and goat legs lol
---
Where is my pink rainbow backpack damnit ಠ╭╮ಠ
---
Maybe they could fix it so anyone in the event gets  the loot from all dead creatures? They have it where there isn't friendly fire, so it seems like it would be doable.
---
I can sort of understand posts like this from people who don't own the game, but what is the fucking point of posting this when you do?  Seriously. You. Own. the. Fucking. Game.
---
In the time it took you to create this thread and post your asinine responses you could have turned it on and tried it for yourself.
---
I got stuck but fortunately the camp was getting attacked by dogs and they broke me free.
---
Thanks Todd
---
Cackles.... “dry loot everything”
---
It does consume the cores, yes, but since it generates scrap including that needed to make the cores, I always came out ahead.  That is, net gain on nuclear, lead and (I think) aluminum.
---
Thanks alot, will give it a check
---
i guess its easier to mine with a shotgun than with a pickaxe??
---
solo or with a team?
---
Blueprints are your friend.   
---
Yes, it’s annoying to have to rebuild, but if you can locate that one key block/keystone and mark or take a photo (ie use your phone camera) then you are all set.  
---
I’m not talking about the floating bases, but complex ones that are hard to set down.  If you have that one thing in the right spot, you’ll find that rebuilding is a breeze while referring to your blueprints. 
---
I got to the point in my last base that I could rebuild in 15 minutes.  My current one would take a bit longer as I have some parts, like water purifiers, that I like to have lined up with no spacing, that require fiddling a bit.  But sometime you can blueprint these by themselves and they will place just fine.  
---
Even if you can’t place one of your blueprints, it gives you a reminder of your layout.  
---
I use it to map out everything.
---
Restarting launcher didn't work for me, I had to click Play before it would check for the update.
---
Nice!  Thanks for the tip!  I'll add that to my search routine.
---
nah, think it will look good on my heavy combat armor :)
---
Oh, ouch, my hope!  ;)
---
Locking you in was probably not intentional. Some people like to leave their doors unlocked sometimes and not others. I think it's just poorly thought out game design because the door locks automatically once it's closed... I've accidentally locked at least 3 camps so far
---
I batted an external hard drive that one terabyte just work a couple of games. You may want to try this approach.
---
No problem! I'm sorry I couldn't offer more clarity or directly answer your questions.
---
&gt;you made a mistake that benefited the players and then took it away while at the SAME TIME mistakes that have hindered us have gone unchecked for weeks at a time.
---
I really don't like this way of thinking. For one thing, we don't know how complicated those other fixes are; marking an Atom Shop item as not Atom Shop is probably a very easy, quick fix. For another thing, what do you expect them to do when they make little mistakes? Just leave them until they fix the bigger issues? That's a really poor way to go about debugging.
---
Well... You're a tadpole... You shouldn't be getting possum badges..  You're right...
---
Yea it has crashed twice for me so far.
---
I'm going to hard boot my console if it does it again.
---
Usually I hate talking over mic. But when I’m in an event like that, I always ask politely for people to not 1 shot the legendary and everyone always listens.
---
Team. Big group.
---
Whats the rush? Im sure it will be fixed, like how long did Fallout 4 take to fix lever action rifle animation?
---
Totally off topic, and possibly dumb question, but how did you get the role after your name?
---
Grrr, I've done that daily many times too!  I'm starting to see the Luck score on my personal character sheet is fairly low...!
---
It crashes to Home screen for me and at least one other user /sad sigh
---
Could be kinda like using the mount Blair excavator, I like the idea
---
Like, a color or design you could 'wrap' around any weapon?
---
Nice that bag will match my space suit.
---
First of all, I'm not even coming across one video where someone shows a duping glitch, yet alone pimps out a shop. 
---
Second, third party website holders which focus on selling in game items from video games in general. Spanning from WOW and more. Can't really crack down on other unaffiliated sites.
---
I'm pretty sure it's legally out of their reach.
---
But yeah I've said this before, if the people selling 76 items on these sites weren't very clearly dupers, I wouldn't mind the prospect of selling the in game items for legitimate cash.
---
There's some things I'd pay real money for, but since it's associated with duping and I do not condone nor support that, I never will.
---
I think the worst thing about these shops is the obvious connection to duping. I'm not against the Moral of selling in game items for cash, especially in a game that relies on rng. 
---
But when the items is duped and the kid has 300,000 other of the same items, yeah that's wack.
---
The thing is I AM trying to get all the scrip I can. I don't have much int he way of caps or gear. I've gotten 3* wood armor twice in a row with what little scrip I had. Went to an event in the Toxic Valley and got a lvl 5 3* Quad Explosive .44 and some last perk to it right after getting those crappy armors.
---
Thankfully I got a weapon that goes for 15k the other day to make up for the poor buys
---
A refrigerated Vending machine would be cool too

---
*(sorry, just those who, at times, have been listed as "Bethesda employees in this thread" and may have an answer)*
---
Dear sirs and madams,  
---
Could any of you offer guidance on whether or not the PC patch size in the Patch Notes is correct? *\[Note: this technically impacts the Console size as well\]*
---
Is it ACTUALLY the "8.48 GB" we are seeing in the Launcher?   
---
Perhaps the update script bugged and doesn't **need** to download the entirety of the *"EnlightenExteriors01.ba2"* and *"EnlightenExteriors02.ba2"*, just slivers of it to --as the term implies-- 'patch' the updated information into those files?
---
\-OR- Was the 1 GB mentioned an error?   
---
As that's roughly the size of what everything totals to be when the aforementioned "EnlightenedExterior" files are excluded...
---
If consoles have the same files to update, I'm not sure where even 5.5GB is coming from since those two files are ***already*** compressed as far as can be so minimum would be 8GB (unless they already downloaded one of them in Patch 9?)
---
*\*EXTENDED CUT\**
---
 Admittedly, I don't know how some of the Archives are structured, but if it's only say 100MB on each of those 4GB files, there's really no reason we have to download 3.9GB of un-changed data. 
---
Back in the day we have an 80MB exe and it would access the game archives, inserting the updated files as needed. These days, an archive can literally only have a couple **lines** of code changed, but we're forced to download the *entire* archive over again just to receive the update... I just don't understand the reasoning since it's clearly not a lack of ability, given it used-to-be the de facto standard method for updates.
---
Please consider those of us who love your games, and gaming, but are at the mercy of corporate America and literally do not have access to land-line internet connections with high data caps... :(
---
Thank you for your time and response!
---
I'm probably wrong, but I think it just shows the items in the machine, without the stash.
---
Oh. So you just want it to be open world CoD? No rng or anything.
---
at this point in the comment chain, you are assuming that they aren't doing anything about it. they might be, but you wouldn't notice. they might also not be, in which case we also wouldn't notice.
---
You should, get a free legendary 1* 44 so thats some free scrip for level 6 scorched
---
I'd love to get some info about soloing it. Can you solo it? need a party? is it an event where you auto form group?
---
My e-peen demands I do it
---
Tell me if it works!
---
I would say DR reloading or 15% faster reload myself.
---
What does this have to do with being politically correct?
---
I've seen that a lot on xbox. Do most people use the mobile app for that? The controller + virtual keyboard thing is awful to type on...
---
It's almost like the items have always been marked as Atom Shop items and we knew this would likely be happening... 🤔
---
Exactly. Sometimes you won't know which junk you need huge quantities of and which ones you only need to keep 50-75 on hand... until you completely run out of one type and need to farm a couple hundred. *Then* you'll know, and you'll never forget.
---
I personally keep everything at ~100 except screws, gears, springs, steel, and lead. I'll never turn down those 5 items, although I do sell springs/gears/screws when I get over 250.  
---
I try to make sure I always have enough to make a handful of items if I need it, but I don't try to always be prepared to mass produce a gun to farm mods or anything like that. If I need those kind of amounts, It's farming time. Keeping that much on hand is a waste of space IMO.
---
Did the event today and for some reason I was constantly taking heavy damage for no apparent reason - wtf?  I even tried going inside, or, over a hill where the enemies couldn't see me and it didn't help - I burned through Super Stimpacks constantly, or, I died.  Server glitch?
---
For levels 1-10 it's useful
---
You have 0 diffense for your idiotic BS so you turn to insulting me for typos. That is proof that you are just a troll.
---
You can solo it. But I doubt you will. Everyone showed up.
---
Honestly my time would probably be better spent elsewhere if it was just for the scrap, but I'm also on a mission to get the Plasma Grenade plan, and reportedly Ash Heap is the best chance for it to spawn.  The event is just a nice bonus to being there.
---
The second one...make sure nuka has it before entering your key card as sometimes there's a delay and getting it descrambled.
---
My psn is pappododo im on fairly often lvl 87
---
I found this to be on a few enemies and the minute I see that health bar start to drop I just keep pounding and eventually I win.
---
that would defeat the purpose of nukacrypt if you had to bring them with you...
---
All you need is a key card and the code.  Currently only silo Alpha is solved.
---
I will! I've been on my other charas just been doing the missions ad hoc on this one XD
---
If you look at any “junk” item, you can see what the raw pieces that it breaks down into - like a typewriter will give you Gear, Screw and Spring.  
---
FWIW... Carlisle Typewriters give Gear, Spring (2) Screw and Aluminum (2)
---
I think there will be a break between now and nuclear winter. Might be a whole month of bug fixes
---
Just go with key card and nukacrypt code and launch it.
---
For the new quests (and really for all recently added quests), are they basically just fetch quests? Are there any meaningful parts of the quest like interesting interactions with NPCs? Or is it all just finding items and reading notes again?
---
They dont want to trigger people.
---
Do you mean like inspecting a weapon to pick up to see what it takes to make it? Your post is unclear.
---
absolutely nothing
---
Got a Formula P recepie. Whatever that is.
---
I keep getting the disconnected from server too as soon as I log in.
---
I'm not sure where I got it, but I have that plan learned from a long time ago, and I did a lot of farming in ash heap when the game first started so you're probably right. Best of luck on your search!
---
I like to jump up on top of the electrical stresses in the yard transformer area and then hide.  Even if a defend event happens the mobs can’t find you.  But...  you need the Marsupial mutation to get up there.
---
Yeah it was underwhelming considering how many things they broke in the last patch. They seem to still be focused on fun, unnecessary fixes vs the critical fixes ..
---
This. I've noticed ghouls have started dropping them at WS. I get one or two per WS run now.
---
I use my solid-state for gaming because it is faster, and have two 1 terabyte old-school drives for storage. Space isn't a problem, it's the fucking installer not being able to read drive space correctly...
---
Can confirm I had same issue moments before patch!
---
Whoa. That would drive me insane. Mine lasted over 80 shots in a fight with the queen recently (and prolly would've lasted longer but that's all the ammo I had.) Guess those intelligence perks are paying off after all.
---
After 6 months, haven't you tried the workaround?
---
So was I but after patch it works now. Got my main character back
---
I know. My current base has 4 bases with foundations on different level and a greenhouse to protect my plants. I can't move it a millimeter and hope to fit it back together.
---
The foundations fit very snug and that took time and redoes endlessly to make it look like one.
---
No, this is important. If it's per bullet hit, yes the shotgun would offer massive advantages over any other weapon. How does the shotgun do with AP? Does it drain very fast? Do you have Unyielding build to buff agility?
---
I say use till you get one low level leg that will have you lvl your toon. then hold off till 50.
---
For me it was an instigating lvl 25 fire axe that took me up to 50. remember hold on to good low lvl items in case you ever want to lvl a new toon that first 50 levels can be a real grind
---
We have found that the scrap produced more than pays out enough to make the cores.  And with some careful set up, we are running to the invasion sites to get hits on the mobs before our turrets take them out.  I could just as easily sit at the workshop console and just repair them and successfully defend, but where's the fun in that?
---
Nuke card and punch in code :) Happy Nuclear Obliterating to you!
---
Check out player camps, some people sell them cheap. I had a few at 75% that sold for 30 caps each.
---
Lol I can never keep enough plasma cores, 50 cal 5mm, and I used to say shotgun ammo, but found someone selling 5k if shells for 0caps. Grabbed them all, and the felt bad so I bought some unknown plans
---
The more you fill it up the better the rewards
---
I'm on ps4, but, just completed it without any issues.
---
I'm still waiting for them to fix the plans for Casual Underarmor.
---
On your main character? Do it not load into the world? Mine seems to be ok after this new patch.
---
&gt;what do we need to add to the custom.ini for those of us who use mods?
---
You can find it in the Fallout76.ini
---
CoD? God no. 
---
If it was my choice.
---
You would have to have a specific survival mode character, and the only legendaries in survival would be very specific drops (Kind of like the challenges, but more of them)
---
love my luck stat so much I maxed it to 15 but don't forget you always can get an unyielding set.
---
Going to the lumber yard to the north (WV Lumber Co). There are about 20 Super Mutants there, most drop .308 rounds and drop weapons that yield many steel scraps. There are plenty of crafting tables around if you get encumbered.
---
Oh man that sucks.  You should give it another shot if it sounds interesting to you.  It definitely works for us.
---
Hear me out, you may want to write in complete sentences.
---
I’m not prone to seizures... not that I know of at least. This game kind of scares me tho... it’s extremely unsettling when I glitch into someone’s Camp foundation upon fast travel
---
That one seems related to the 'enemy in area/15 second to travel timer they added in 9.
---
Ocasionally on clicking fast travel it will just fail as if you hadn't chosen it, no countdown either. A workaround is to walk 10 meters or so and try again.
---
https://nolife.gg/guide/63140/fallout-76-backpack-mod-list-with-their-effects
---
Thank the gaming heaven above I love fallout 76 to much and it would be a shame to be banned
---
Level 100 grafton 3 star
---
Light wood laminate light wood laminate light wood laminate!
---
Hear me out, you aren’t going to win this one lol
---
So no RNG... the only thing in the game keeping it alive for most poeple?
---
I thought that's what was happening to me on a bunch of sheepsquatch randoms and scorchbeasts last weekend.
---
This is the smallest amount of power i've seen go to someone's head.
---
complete what?
---
Tangent: Are nuke mines craftable? I glanced at a vendor and it said I knew the plan, but i havent seen it in the tinker bench. (maybe my brain bad)
---
Yeah, I let it download before I tried to log in
---
The new dungeon/event is out, huh?
---
can be a little surprising when it happens.
---
I’d like to see the swamp folk from fallout 3’s point lookout dlc make a return. They were really creepy and I feel like they’d fit really well in the mire
---
I see only one is decrypted for today, heard it has to do with weekly resets etc. I think I already chose which bunker to nuke in the quest, so will have to check. thanks!!
---
It's always like that straight after maintenance. Give it a couple of hours lol.
---
Why would you upload a screenshot of the thumbnails instead of just uploading the images themselves?
---
They're doing a pretty horrible job then, there's an outrage on this sub at least twice a week
---
I'm assuming Project Paradise.
---
And abandon the classic Bethesda tighty-whiteys? Lol.  
---
A very significant percentage of the mods in FO4 were underwear replacements. I'm looking forward to that in 76, but private servers and open modding will create some... interesting environments.
---
The model and all of its ‘models’ when you include how many weapons change completely with mods.
---
Kinda wild how much work goes into it bc of the mod system
---
Getting 8GB update, says 1gb here...that normal?
---
Powercycling the console resulted in yet another crash.....
---
Sounds like you spend a lot of time thinking about triggering people, and why people get triggered, to the point where you're projecting your thoughts onto random topics like Bethesda not putting enough gore into Fallout 76.
---
Also, considering how many heads on pikes I've seen in game, I'm gonna have to call bullshit on this one. Not to mention the lore of Fallout 76 does not support the idea that there should be corpses hanging from chains everywhere. It's not Fallout 4, and there is not an active raider territory war going on in Appalachia.
---
Does it show up as an event or do you just go there?
---
The last SBQ I fought, literally half of the people that showed up hid in the bunkers while 4 of us did the fighting.  Never wanted to PvP so bad since Ive started.  First time Ive personally seen that happen.  Decided Im not doin the SBQ anymore, not for that, but more its just not worth it anymore.  XP isnt worth the cost.  Rewards are usually not worth the cost.  Just a waste.  Imho
---
How much are they
---
i may have gotten lucky and this wasn't the thug server. i actually joined Survival twice, the first time i had forgotten to stash Aid (as another in this thread points out). the first Survival server i joined, i was number 2 on the leaderboard immediately. the second server had a couple more people, from what i can tell. but still never saw any evidence of another player.
---
Tankier than the sheepsquatch?  Does more damage than the imposter?
---
yeap. xbox here. crashed 7 times for me. restarted. hard booted. still crashes.
---
so, do you guys want to do fertile soil?
---
as in, it's not an instanced dungeon, but an event like the sheepsquatch or the SBQ, where everybody can come and become my team mate. great!!
---
It's update day. There is always an update today.
---
If the game gives you a badge for the event the caps reward popup for the event will show a badge icon instead of the caps icon.
---
Man I feel for you. It sucks starting over when you don’t want to.
---
 Maybe you have to be of a certain age range (40+) to appreciate the Evil Kenevil Outfit.
---
I'm gonna tell you right now that when they say +30 carry weight +90 rad resist etc they mean take away 30 carrry weight from a level 50 backpack, not add to it.
---
So the carry weight with mods other than high capacity bascially knock your bag back down to +30 carry weight. Not +30 on top of the +60.
---
Interesting mechanics. Took a team of randoms 7 total to complete it.
---
You can place the red stove too
---
All of my camps have been free of this bug because it never occurred to me to put the camp box inside my camp. I've always put the camp box on the ground near the garden. The camp itself starts with a single foundation piece and then has stairs into the air.
---
Shotgunner no longer affects the grenade launcher, only explosives expert increases damage.
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
I nearly FTd only at one (can't remember the name atm), and serendipity and bird bones saved me. But it was a really engineering build, veeery creative and a lot of work there. I traded with the guy and gived to him 1000 caps, and some purified water and canned food. He earned my respect
---
It is also worth noting that Legendary spawns are affected in different servers.  Sometimes they are abundant and sometimes they are quite rare.
---
Tell me about it if you get the chance, not able to play right now. Rewards? New Legendary creatures?
---
Hear  me out, "Lol" isn't a word, and sentences need to end with some form of punctutation, in this case, a period.
---
Thanks, expecting to be a little bit innovative with my nuke, Morgantown, Monnogah or something different but without being a waste :P
---
No problem. Good luck. BTW, Its definitely easier to get through the silo if you have another person with you.
---
So it's not instanced I take it?
---
Doesn't bother me much, you don't see anyone at burrows anymore (barely anyone at Harper's at all).
---
Gonna wait a few days for the seas to calm however. Said that about burrows, still haven't been.
---
makes no sense, they already spawn you away from the normal fast travel locations, they could easily do that for camps
---
Not sure if this happens to others, but the last couple of times during the camp fire event, killing the Legendary enemy for the end of the event too quickly seems to stuff up the event. I wait for the event to end and nothing happens.
---
Hmmmmm, maybe the raider bot at top of the world? I bought a marine dense mod from him at the same time.
---
Yeah, radsponge is really good. I play with bloodied people most of the time so can't really use it much, though wish I could in nuke zones, at least. And if none of your teammates have it, you can share it and get the benefits. But of course it only works to clear your rads if they are taking rads.
---
Good luck with this approach. I was nervous when I first dropped lvl 3 Lead Belly and used lvl 1 for a bit. But then I dropped it and haven't looked back.
---
Take the elevator in the main entrance.
---
Whenever I get frustrated with the 15k-20k items and the cap limit that won't let me save up much more than that, I just remember that game economies are screwy and Bethesda's fighting that in possibly the only way they can.  If there wasn't a cap limit, how many people do you think would charge way more just because they know some players have been saving for months.  Bit by bit, this would drive up the prices for meta equipment until you have a situation like most other MMOs; a marketplace that is largely populated by hardcore veterans charging prices that only other veterans can afford, making the marketplace virtually inaccessible to players who haven't dumped hundreds of hours into the game.
---
Any specific Savage Divide event, or just any events in Savage Divide?  Also we were wondering if that would be more likely since that or Cranberry Bog is a higher level area.  We'll keep running those, too!
---
I dont know who this is but I feel like I should.
---
Someone pitched a Canning crafting station. Would be a great idea. Not only is it local West Virginia lore friendly, it would give value to to jars that are all over the wastes. Also as another good thread mentioned yesterday,  a need for more advanced recipes.
---
So I made 1 post about skill in PvP. 1 post about PA being under powered. 1 post about wanting a fair counter to stealth boys because they are incredibly unbalanced. 1 post about hoping Bethesda doesnt nerf my new favorite gun, which isnt even a comment about PvP. 300+ posts about anything else fo76
---
Tell me again how all I do is post negative PvP stuff...
---
Haha I was literally just scratching my head thinking “I could’ve sworn there were more negative effects than this..” 
---
Thank you for clarifying!
---
and consumes 1 salt
---
The many assultrons will melt you
---
I'm bloodied too and at about 15% health my high-cap backpack puts me at 500lbs carry capacity (not kidding).   It's higher than my excavator PA with shocks and motion-assist servos.
---
Oh no don’t know what to tell you. Everything that was suggested to me didn’t work. Wait 24hr before logging in, deleted saved data on storage, reinstalled it, added a friend I’d deleted, booted into safe mode and many more things and none of them worked. You have to submit a ticket but they will just tell you to wait 24 hrs and look on the forum for updates.
---
Wont even let me make a new character
---
Son of a... I JUST BOUGHT THE DAMN LAMINATE.
---
I have a rounded walled walkway as my garden wall that’s like that.  It has to fit just right between my front porch and the dock way on the other side of my base to look seamless.  It takes some fiddling because it doesn’t snap into place, I have to manually place it.  
---
I recently took over the race track workshop to update the blueprint from the basic concrete blocks to the dark hardwood and it going to be annoying to place it back down again.
---
Equip bloody mess, you get proper combat dismemberment then. Also, have you listened to some of the tapes in this game? You have kids killing each other, terrorist attacks, kids begging their dead parents to come home, graphic descriptions of the miner riots, a creepy uncle kidnapping a child to use as a hostage, and a woman who trains her girls into assassins. I'd argue this game has more of "the old fallout carnage" than 4 did
---
Didn't they also nerf the explosive expert damage too?
---
Actually, no.  I just posted another thread about that freakin' plan!  The PG plan is the whole reason I started doing this workshop, lol!
---
Just had to fight a 3 star LV 100 sheepsquatch
---
u/Valseek, Is there an ETA for fixing the bug causing CAMP items to become stuck with an unnecessary "removing this item would cause items to be floating" error?  I literally have nothing but 3 foundation connected together, all touching the ground, and I can't move, store or scrap them.
---
I know I can move my base to fix the problem, but I really like my base the way it is, and it's a complicated build that I can't easily move.
---
What's the new content?
---
Well, people bitched about the last dungeon being too easy.
---
Appears as an event.
---
The fix one thing and break two. We all love Bethesda's logic :D
---
Eeeeeek, anyone else?  I hope this isn’t the norm I’m so excited for this.
---
yeah I was unloading unneeded aid items yesterday and looked at my stimpaks for the first time in forever and I had like 140. I have more than 100 radaways too. But even then that's just one days worth of caps. I'm grown up enough to wait until tomorrow to sell the rest of them. 
---
I mean that's my point - I'm willing to help out by selling these things at cost - at what I can get from a vendor. I mean it's not real money so who cares but I'm a raider, I've gotta look out for number one.
---
Eh I need to do a fresh install of windows anyways guess it's a good time to do it. Thanks!
---
No. There’s quite a few “unprotected” junk items that are used for crafting special things (or for quests “unscrapped”. The bug cleanup daily is one- bloatfly sacs and bloodbug proboscis are both required, and both will be destroyed and become useless if you “scrap all”
---
Not sure why it was weird for this player to be there...they can fast travel to your camp and people go out exploring anywhere, even if it’s difficult to survive.
---
As far as that weapon being duped, ewww no. Probably their first and only roll from Lady Mumurguguh or whatever her name is.
---
I know, it's almost like the stupid place is run my human beings or some such nonsense.
---
BGS, hire some infallible workers FFS.  We're tired off all this imperfection!
---
&gt; Only hard part is when defend events pop up and you’re afk
---
I just ignore them. It's much quicker to to a single wave "Retake" event rather than futz around doing 3-4 waves defending.
---
Whoa!  No, not that much.  In the hundreds range.
---
My god man, what are you *doing* with that much scrap?!?
---
XP and loot should just be proximity based.
---
I try but sometimes the baddies will super aggro me and then I'm just mowing them down.
---
That patch list was disturbingly short.
---
No mention of the ammo/vendor bug. Only fixed some of the challenges. Claims the high cap mod was an exploit when we all damned well know they fucked that up.
---
No fast travel mat either. Which at this point is about the only camp item I desire.
---
Not gonna stop me playing, but I'm just going to pretend they didn't even do this patch.
---
Maybe diffusers are something to do with the new Project Paradise event. Who knows.
---
That very same shotgun medic that I use started out and leveled to over 50 with pistols until I discovered the holy grail for healing (shotguns). I fully intend to make another pistol build. The increased carry capacity and especially the low AP cost make it more attractive to me than my current explosive rifle build (something I thought I would enjoy more but I was wrong). For the tougher mobs you simply need armor penetration (via the legendary effect, even a 1\* will suffice) if you don't vats crit a lot (even if you do it helps tremendously when you don't crit). I highly recommend going vats crit with a pistol because the crits eliminate the downside of using pistols (lower damage hits being significantly mitigated by enemy DR). Additionally, you will want rank 3 better criticals and optionally covert operative to scale the crits to very respectable damage levels. I understand your frustration from my own experience but there has to be a downside to pistols, right?
---
Xbox?  I have some solid 2*medic weapons that I'm willing to part for cheap.  Let me know if your interested.
---
Level 100 boss enemies spawn but rewards are crap. May give better rewards if you successfully complete all objectives; we did 1/3.
---
did you get plastic from the card tho
---
OP is aware of this, but is referring to the fact that the patch notes said it would be under 1gb when it’s actually 8ish.
---
Oh you’re on pc. Definitely submit a ticket first as I think they can help you on the pc.
---
Is it possible to solo? My internet is garbage for the next few hours, I won't be able to try it until tonight probably
---
Lol. But it's an outrage about game mechanics and not PC police that will bash you in the media until mothers are up in arms about violent video games.
---
Do explosive weapons still make enemies heal?
---
Also, did Nuka grenades and MIRV frags ever get fixed?
---
Good luck
---
Nah keep gunsmith. If not your weapons will break insanely fast
---
Got two star legendary drop form the boss and arktos lab coat. Almost failed the event. It’s like the free range where you have to keep three creatures alive. We were down to the last one. Probably didn’t get the best reward.
---
The Corvega backpack isn't bad.  It'll go better with some of the fancier outfits than the more rustic options we have now.
---
Oh no... Yet another issue that could generate a support group of which I would sadly be a member!
---
This bad boy is set up like a broken slot machine. Haha 😂
---
So the enemy changes then
---
No problem, I was pretty disappointed when I got a second mod. The description is misleading as always. Should have had my Bethesda brain on lol
---
Super tough
---
Yeah what the fuck. Bethesdas launcher downloads at a tenth of steams dl rate.
---
smh
---
Yes! I'm stuck at work at the mo so can't try it yet but this is what I was hoping to read. The game needs more difficult nonsense in it.
---
Exactly.  I don't need three scrip that badly.
---
I use the controller to start a conversation and switch over to the mobile app if it is someone I haven’t talked to yet. If it is someone I have talked to before then I go straight to the app.
---
This really doesnt surprise me. Looks like they are taking pointers from anthem.
---
Everything else in the game works fine. Unless there is some prerequisite that I haven't done.
---
I would wait till someone hashes out the mechanics. We are trying to acquaint ourselves with the dungeon so we know where the materials spawn and the drop points.
---
I'm a melee build; for the first few faschnahts I did, same thing was happening - I could not get in close enough for a hit on the sloth before the higher levels destroyed it.
---
Fixed that by swapping to an SMG instead of a melee weapon.
---
Pretty much ensured I got in a couple hits on the sloth.
---
If you think I am trying to make anyone care about what anyone thinks then you completely missed the point of what I'm saying. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS!! Whether someone recommends the game to him or doesn't, it will not effect what he thinks when he gets around to playing the game again. He will either enjoy the game or not and he will never know what the answer is until he actually plays himself.. He already owns the damn game for christ sake!! Lol
---
I've yet to get one from there. But definitely seems to be an uncommon drop from Ghouls which is awesome.
---
She is a cruel mistress.  Been haunted by Lady "RNG" Luck since Diablo 2...
---
Lol people complain about being too easy, now people complain about it being hard.
---
$14 for a power armor paint. That should say it all, these people are full of greed and wouldn’t know a good gesture if it bit them in the ass.
---
Got a source on the reload speed? I know about the movement speed, but I was just experimenting with reload last night and I’m pretty sure i had a noticeable speed improvement using the HW reload perk, and I already have speed demon.
---
I suspect that the problem is that 1\* wood armor is technically 3\* but you can't see two of them.  Data miners may be able to confirm this.  Salvaged assaultron heads have an invisible 1\* rating on them that adds the Charging effect and also irradiates the user.  Someone suggested that maybe wood armor has something similar that affects stealth or some other mechanic.
---
Now I want a side quest where Biv is desperate after running out of bøøze and turns into...
---
Biv. E. RAGE!
---
Why not? If it's suitably hard it's ok. Pick pocketing has long been a thing in fallout.
---
I don't usually comment to massive shade like this, but that was the best thing I've read thing morning. Helps I seen the problem on beth.net first - made this pretty light hearted. Have an upvote for the laugh 🙂
---
Bro Bethesda knows what's up when it comes to hooking up the loyal players anxious to experience new content
---
I'm on the xbox and it's doing the same.
---
Thanks man.  I need testimonials like this to keep my hope alive!
---
Wish I could, the multiple enemies kept staggering us.
---
People that paid for the game have the right to play as they like i believe
---
Damn.  Thought the Deathclaw and Cat hedge things were gifts. I feel like Bethesda just took my birthday present away. I hope my kitty is still on my couch and got grandfathered in. Oh well, probably buy if isn’t  lol
---
I saw Logic gates somewhere too. Is that for workshops ?
---
Yep, just failed
---
I'm sorry, I may have some mole rat chunk's if you're farnished
---
You sure you want your legendaries to be stolen ? (Even worst if there's a 'steal equippes item' perk)
---
I'm a lonely melee character..... looks like I'm double screwed.
---
10 hours for me, which is why I'm even more concerned if this is the result of a bigger issue that would require another download.
---
I go every time i log on, its part of my loop.
---
Treetops and big b for plans then up the road to bridge for random encounter.
---
Next to sunday brothers for plans and burrow south for 3-4 legendaries.
---
Sell stuff to harpers vendor and check for plans. 
---
Then sell legendaries and buy from legendary vendor and finally crevase dam for random encounter. 
---
Whole loop is surprisingly quick.
---
Once everyone is familiar then I can see it being possible. Not possible if it’s your first run. It’s pretty big down there.
---
Well it was low level, I was busy trying to get more core perks rather than durability perks. Even now my bpp only lasts 20 ish shots and thats with 160% repair.
---
Well that would be a while though as there's still a lot of people who struggle with the Encrypted and Free Range mechanics ;)
---
What do you not understand? I'm asking how heads on spikes is lore friendly but the bodies that go with them hanging from chains is just way to much?
---
Surething.
---
Hi all, thanks for the reports. We're investigating!
---
Maybe that's my key problem...my character luck stat is only, like, 8...
---
Too easy, too hard. Be more tactical.
---
I know. This happened to me three times out of four since patch 9.
---
* Edit:   No observed casual shielded plans on consoles.   One PC version was offered during that time.   But they could not or would not say where they got it—so it may have been before the bug arose or may have been a dev room item duped by someone.
---
thanks!! Well that's why after +300h I haven't launched any...I can't use mic, and I expected them to add text chat sometime....but no luck XD
---
So I finally took the decision to run it alone. I would love to do it with somebody but with no communication I don't dare to ask for people.
---
Anyway, my char (well, my 3 chars) can easily solo 2-3 scorch beasts at the same time (even more now that they fixed their blinding scream) and most of em run lots of weight reduction mods / legendary modifiers, so each one carries enough ammo, aid and weapons to play a whole week without restock, so maybe it will be slow or boring, but im totally confident I can do it. Thanks for tips tho!

 &gt; Hi all, thanks for the reports. We're investigating!
---
Good idea - thanks
---
yup 5 times for me as well on xb1
---
This Xbox?
---
Same here. Let's just hang in there until Bethesda does something about this.
---
Oh sorry I missed it.
---
Hussah!!!!! Time to get that sweet sweet cranberry relish and well rested things goin. Endless grind continues!
---
Misread*
---
What is tactical on boss that only smash you to death in one hit. I am melee so gg. And for ranget it is just boring kitting.
---
I had a few people join me but failed. It’s not easy!

Using Weapon Artisan it cannot be repaired past 100% (Credit to jchamlin, I totally forgot about this one)

---
**Issue: Grognak's Axe Not benefiting from "Martial Artist"** (Ticket Submitted on 02-12-2019)

This could be linked to the same missing keyword as mentioned before. (Credit to yellowspaces for reporting it.)
---
Add the Keyword ObjectTypeWeapon \[KYWD:000F4AEA\] to the Axe.
---
Aw man I thought we were heading in a raider direction...
---
Xbox and PC, I'm gonna assume PS4 as well, but can't confirm.
---
Because taking someone's 3 star anti armor vats crit rifle would make them stop playing.
---
I've wondered if the terrain problem was a video driver issue, but haven't bothered to update it.
---
Im on my 9th crash now. I just want to go in and look at the area. But it crashes from fast traveling to the event, and when just trying to take the elevator down.
---
Same on pc
---
I had a full set of bolstering. I switched out to a few unyeilding mixes and can say I sometimes miss it. I just didn't notice how well it worked until I got rid of it.
---
What's the primary effect?
---
No, it's definitely not about the scrap for us.  We're filled to the gills with the stuff this produces.
---
The whole reason I started it was to grind for the Plasma Grenade plan.  It *is* a fun event, though.
---
Damn, that sucks.
---
&gt;First of all, I'm not even coming across one video where someone shows a duping glitch, yet alone pimps out a shop. 
---
You can't be this bad at google. "Fallout 76 duping glitch" gives you a 2 day old vid with 2 working exploits. And in the video description is a link to a store smh
---
I won't post a link here for obvious reasons

Community : This dungeon is too easy ! 
---
Arkos pharma : Hole my nuka.
---
Yeah that's weird AF.
---
Good luck!
---
Oh then that really sucks. I’d definitely submit a ticket. They responded pretty quickly to me but couldn’t do anything really
---
What if any theft made you become wanted and drop all stolen items on death?
---
Anyway dude, I get it, you don't like the idea.
---
It is not hard. It is stupid. I did it technicali alone, but wtf? Why did he have to kill me in one hit? I will complain until they stop doing bosses with only bulletsponge+massive damage "tactic". Cheap shit.
---
 Clear your cache.
---
Second hand information, but yes, they are.  A guy I play with regularly got a nuke mine plan in like week 2.  I have yet to see one, though.
---
After a while you will know which items have stuff in it you need. But until then, use the "tag for search" option in your workbench. This will add a little magnifying glass in front of items you see anywhere in the map. This doesn't work for weapons and such though.
---
I doubt it was more of a priority...it was probably just an easier fix.  Changing the code to determine whether something cosmetic was bought in the Atomic Shop or not has to be *far* easier than reprogramming the more major issues people are seeing.  If you've got an easy fix for something and an already scheduled update why the hell not release it at the same time? It's smart workload management.  Hell, I do the same thing every day at work.  Knock out the easy stuff and then focus on the more challenging items.
---
Lol ok mate. Maybe that’s why they said you’d need people to help. It’s pretty high level.
---
So angry
---
An entire character just got deleted? Man this is bad
---
I'm on xb1
---
The file size says 8.48gb on my PC?? Taking over an hour to download :-(
---
It wasn’t included in the patch notes which is super weird.  There are like 4 or 5 that are bugged and they only fixed the 1.  Fingers crossed for a hot fix!
---
That’s the “all up in her” part I was talking about. You need to be clipping into her to get it to work.
---
It’s just a lot easier to hit her legs or something else though.
---
i was down there at first about to finish the event and i died and got put in an infinite loading screen so i restarted and now its just crashing in the loading screen when i enter
---
With absolutely no knowledge or schematics we can craft fusion cores which harnesses vast amounts of energy into an object roughly the size of a soda can. With it, we can power mechanized battle suits or fuel weapons of great destructive power.
---
Yet somehow basic concepts like food preservation are lost arts.
---
I don't have it downloaded.
---
Next Fallout title to be in Arizona, please. I want to jump off the Grand Canyon in power armor.
---
Did you try waiting until you were well-tuned? It worked for me...
---
I hear you, this is why I’m reluctant to get rid of my vanguard set. Right now I can even tank the imposter sheepsquatch for almost a full min before she kills me. That’s pretty epic considering she slaughters everyone in her path.
---
And I can hold the agro of the scorchbeast Queen Indefinetly for the whole fight without dying.
---
All right, ty for the info. I've got a solid 216kb/s download speed at the moment, definitely gonna have to wait until it's fixed before I can play
---
You don't want to know what goes into making Dandy Boy apples.
---
We need the MuteGoose (Mutant Goose)
---
Robot armor plans can turn up at world armor plan spawns. IIRC the highest probability is the Savage Divide or Mire. People are just a bit desperate because they need them for a possum badge, and you'd need a lot of time or luck to find all three.
---
Raider plans can only drop from Signal Strength, as far as I know.
---
It's slightly outside the safezone
---
I'm not being a dick, I'm just saying if you can pick pocket it should be reasonable stuff. I think the idea is fine is it's like a small random bit of their meds, junk, ammo, or caps, possibly depending on the perk you have equipped for it.
---
Dupers : Allow us to introduce ourselves ! *crash servers*
---
Oh yeah. Even more so longer lol.
---
I’m sorry I meant the last Grafton monster
---
Yes, good tip!  Personally that is one of my junk items I keep below 100 anyway, so I sell it off regularly.  It's nice to have something to do that uses it.
---
It was not hard to kill him, but annoying.
---
Hey man I'm an optimist I'm looking at the upside as you can see lol thanks
---
"It just works"
---
I send team requests in the immediate area when going to do SBQ because I run mainly a support build and bring in a team instantly makes me (and everyone teamed with me) do better.
---
Team with me and get free heals, rad-cleansing, speed boosts, and the three-star bloody mess perk!
---
I have like six cats so I'm good lol
---
Someone gets it
---
Same here
---
If you’re on PS4, I’ll gladly buy nuclear material from you. Im always in desperate need of it.
---
I can't imagine a scenario where a "used copy" of the CD code would work. I can't say with 100% certainty but I can tell you that you'd be gambling essentially $50 to try to save $2. If the "used" copy doesn't work your now out the price of that plus another one, or you just don't get the game and you're still it $23.
---
Complete the quest before scrapping then. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Just NO!
---
Scroll down in New on this subreddit. Lots of people.
---
Exactly. You dont even have to say anything for these infantile adults to throw a fit.
---
No. I'm not to keen on having my legendary weapons and outfit getting stolen. It took me forever to get my Mr Fuzzy costume, i'm not getting 500 tokens every time someone steals it.
---
really the only problem is making sure what silo you're in
---
lost two keycards once when I entered the code from the wrong silo in twice before I realized what was happening
---
There are more than one sort options. Hit it twice, and it shows only the machine inventory, with unassigned stash items under.
---
I know how ya feel when it comes to the Purveyor. Gave up on trying to get armor cuz of that 3* wood armor crap. I wouldn't mind a set of wood armor if we didn't lose the other 2 effects just from modding it or leaving game lol.
---
Sort by New.
---
Does anyone actually test this shit before release?
---
120 days later your wish has been fulfilled.  Limited time only.
---
Thanks for the tips I have been avoiding cuz Im not interested in being killed
---
What’s the advantage of the Pc? Clear cases and neon lights? Water cooled so it doubles as an aquarium? Web cam shows? Lol
---
If its just you crashing, it's most likely something local, not a Bethesda problem.  I haven't heard of any widespread issues with this, so I'd start looking at home.
---
Have you done any maintenance issues that are usually suggested?  I'm not a console person, but repairing/verifying game files, rebuilding the console database, things like that.
---
It shouldn’t be but it isn’t exactly the same situation imo. booze isn’t marketed to kids as heavily and there isn’t decades of research proving drinking gives you cancer. I don’t think either should be removed or anything, I’m just pointing out why a major media company like Bethesda probably wouldn’t let you smoke cigs in their game in this point it time.
---
I make 5mm ammo. *LOTS* of 5mm ammo.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
New atoms are a real P.I.T.A. to earn so wait and winnow down people's balance on crap so the desirable items cost real money.
---
So I have them up in my camp, will they stick around?
---
Silly question, but does anyone know if the punch bow bug was fixed?
---
It is interesting to say the least. Died 10 times trying to figure out the mechanics.
---
It's a feature, not a bug.
---
I swear I have every mod out there for them, and I honestly don't know WHY I want them (since the armor rating on them isn't great and crafting them would be non-legendary) other than possibly to complete the collection, but damned I think I have every mod for the armor already anyways.
---
You know how many acting career' s will be ruined in the wasteland from this think about it . I was trying to "pick pocket" him or her and they groped my buttocks careers will be ruined
---
Hey PC Police please don't reply back because that's bullying and Sheepsquatch (Use sheep voice) says " that's baaadd"
---
Okay is this better or should I max do 15 agility and luck or is 14 alright?
---
Same
---
Its a good combo. Its 50/50 I'll die falling off the gigantic monorail. When i don't die I have around 80% health
---
at any workbench/crafting table, highlighting an item to scrap will tell you the component parts it breaks down to.
---
On the crafting side, when you select an item to craft, the screen tells you what you need and (how much you have/how much you need).  Items you have enought of are white text, items you dont are grey.
---
For example, in crafting:
---
steel (120/4)  --&gt; in white text
---
spring (0/2) --&gt; in grey text
---
means you need 4 steel, and you have 120, 
---
and you need 2 springs, but dont have any.
---
in scrap mode, a clipboard:
---
wood (2)
---
spring (1)
---
means when you scrap the item, you get 2 wood chips and 1 spring.
---
Steel scrap is a precious commodity. Don't use it's name in vain.
---
lol, yeah. I can watch porn picture in picture while I farm legendaries. You jealous?
---
So basically over 100GB I need for storage. Damn I was really looking forward to get this when it was a little more within my budget
---
The last time couple of times we tried forming a team from the main menu, the results were very weird. Some parts of the game thought that some of us were teamed. Some parts didn't.
---
Haven't had too much trouble otherwise. We usually only team once we're on the server, which seems to work reliably.
---
Clicking the "block" button seems like a very bad idea. Is there even a way to unblock?
---
honestly, I don't do that event for the legendary loot anyway. And I've failed it so many times - hey, just kill the legendary that spawns and the event completes, yay.
---
We had snow over the weekend.
---
Is anyone else getting a crazy big download? For some reason mine is over 8gb and my brother has a 56gb download that says it's going to take 6 hours.
---
&gt;Can meat stew no longer decays but I’ve yet to see the event since the patch.
---
It's one of the events that only seems to trigger when someone is in the area. Pop over there and there's a good chance it'll start. I've been running it as often as possible and selling the excess meat stew for 20 caps each.
---
Also, keep an eye out when someone nukes Morgantown. I did it the other day and it was wave after wave of glowing bois.
---
Yeah but it’s a lot easier for a kid to get his hands on cigarettes and repeat that behavior than it is for a kid to buy a prostitute. Apples to oranges.
---
I picked up a copy of the Tricentennial Edition (for PC) dirt cheap off of Amazon Warehouse some time back. It was marked as used but wasn't - it was just a new, shrink-wrapped copy that looked like it got run over by a bus. :-) No big deal since there isn't actually a disk inside, and all of the codes were still good, including the Tricentennial bonus stuff. Your mileage may vary, though - just be sure to check the vendor rep.
---
I only have 2 A and C looking for B.
---
A is 97
---
C is 30
---
It's time consuming, yes, but not difficult.
---
If the name is "bad" it might get deleted
---
&gt; Should have had my Bethesda brain on lol
---
If you need a spare shoe box for that, let me know.  I think that's the approved container.
---
Obligatory Atom Store Comment: I'm not spending $5 to buy one skinned object. Please reconsider your pricing strategy.
---
Try it first. Once we hammer down the mechanics then it may be possible.
---
I got the same trouble, about 15 Gb free on a hard drive, yet it asks for a full 61 Gb download. Game itself is where it supposed to be
---
I used to have this trouble with only one game in the past: "Payday 2". It was impossible to update, if i had less that full game's weight free space.
---
Well I should have checked nukakrypt before heading into Bravo solo......
---
Let me try Alpha solo.
---
The issue is these guys just forgot to wait for the patch for the patch Bethesda trained as well by now
---
Same here but i just moved the game folder to a new one. Instead of the anounced 1gb patch it's 8gb for me...us.
---
Same here. Cant get in without crash. Sucks
---
Lol. You're telling me, I use a railway rifle as my main weapon and it costs 7 steel for 3 shots.
---
Nope.  Thats a horrible idea that just caters to griefers.  Im not ok with someone making a very focused build to take my 3* gear and then log out of the game.  Who cares about being super-wanted if they can just droo o7t of the game? And before you say "just make it so that the thief cant log out for x amount of time", what if they take your only good [pvp] weapon and you now cant kill them? What if their system powers down - does their character just sit there helplessly while you kill them? There would be no end of bitching about that.  Finally, that would likley open up a whole barrel of exploitable opportunities where duping can start up again.
---
TL;DR - No. Just no.
---
A huge 10%... So generous
---
The patch notes said it requires multiple people. You can try solo but will likely fail if the mechanics require you to be in multiple areas at once.
---
You mean the topes weren't gifts?
---
Booooooo! Give them back!!!
---
The character name was alone, but i was in 50 levels and a few weeks of work so why now
---
So I noticed I had the cat and deathclaw topiaries unlocked (free as I did not buy them in the Atom store but were already unlocked I thought it was a nice treat from Bethesda but from their patch notes that wasn’t the case in fact it was a bug and now we must unlock them in the Atom store and guess what I just checked and they aren’t even in the Atom store so Bethesda how do you propose we have block these after all they aren’t in the Atom store, they were newly added to our CAMP build mode and you want us to unlock these items which again aren’t even in the Atom store for crying out loud don’t give us stuff then take it away that’s so not cool! 
---
From the patch notes today:
---
Floor Décor: Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop. (Which we cant do!!!!)...
---
I dont get off work for another 4 and half hours... 12 hour shifts. Does that mean that no one has completed it yet?
---
Make sure wonder if they even tested it on Xbox before release
---
What's broken this time?
---
Nope. You have to defend three very weak animals from some of the strongest enemies in the game. It’s intense and no way you can be in three places at once.
---
Oxhorn just got all 3. Let's see.
---
It's 09 btw.
---
same here 8,48GB
---
Add juuls for the teens.
---
I haven't done anything to the game, I played it yesterday so it can't be a previous update queued or something. Weird
---
And I’ve found a dense combat armor chest mod. They’re there
---
I am going to try incorporate radicool to see the difference in my survivability and if I should go bolstering with unyeilding or not lol
---
I don’t mind talking my time with it.
---
That's what I meant, are there mechanics that would force you to team up?
---
Salty much? No crack down on this. FO76 has more players than you think and most of us don't dupe.
---
I was genuinely expecting for us to be able to keep the topiaries, on account of everyone having had access to them for such a relatively long period of time. I hope they haven't been removed from our CAMPs, I've yet to log in and check.
---
Because for every person who would use the mat correctly to assist players there'd be another who would use it maliciously to set up kill traps or force logs now that player CAMPs are indestructible. That's why they were taken away in the first place.
---
I get that part of it, I do.  Just as someone else has pointed out, Fallout is a game of raiding, murder, slaving, drinking, drug usage, etc.  Smoking a cigarette pales in comparison to those other things
---
What "vendors"?  I haven't seen the *plans* anywhere.
---
It happen to me. Then I cleared my cache and was able to complete it without disconnecting. Yes I’m also on Xbox.
---
The programming for the ones they rolled out fixes for was probably easier to correct than the other ones
---
At least one of the popular key sites, 12 euro atm, and it works perfectly.
---
The laminate floorings are easily the best available. I like to use a mixture of the light and dark in my CAMP, for some variety!
---
I’ll give it a try!
---
Ah the sherbet nuclear winter wonderland
---
Good thing is it's only 1 point perk card. So it's an easy one to run
---
&gt;Are there recipes with salt cause so far salt and pepper are useless to pick up.
---
Yeah, most of the fancier recipes need salt, pepper, and/or spices.
---

Prior to [Patch 9](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019) Weapons would receive a Bonus to Damage if repaired to 200% (Really anything over 100%)  and would slowly loose the bonus Damage as the "Over Repair" was slowly brought to 100% or Lower, that is now missing.
---
\*Edit\*  I've gotten a response from one of the Community managers, they are looking into this.
---
There's a mutant SS skin tho
---
I didn't realize you were the original creator of the thread. Just play the game! Assuming you still own it, you're not losing anything by trying!
---
If only some thought was put into it
---
I say instead we make "ammo packs" so I can sell a box of 40 rounds for like 10 caps. Or 1. Or 39!!
---
Given how long these websites have been around I'm assuming they either can't or won't do anything about it
---
When the game launched explosive weapons would heal enemies because their health would drop too fast
---
My topiaries :(

It's the fourth section of a multi-part chemical formula.

---
You have to use it in the bowels of Arktos Pharma.
---
I did find out it needed to be the "Deluxe" version last night.. I found a broken regular one in Whitesprings and thought I was GTG... then got to the crafting table! ha!
---
Hell, remove it from the game.
---
Wow. That's cool I guess but I seem to remember good old Todd saying that if you wanted to you could play this game solo like the other fallouts... but what an I talking about? That's like saying that he said the Atom Shop was supposed to be "cosmetic only".
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. You can change your Mac address so whatever you want with the right knowledge
---
They've always been 250 per core for me
---
I bet it was. But so are most bugs

---
 &gt; Is this recent since the patch or has this been happening to you before today?
---
You mean like how the SB Queen isnt worth it no matter how many poepel show up even if you killer her in less than 5 minutes. Lol.
---
Hm, what’s so bad about it?
---
I read elsewhere that is you clear the xbox cache it will load with no issues.  Still at work though so this is just secondhand information
---
Ok. Will do.
---
Damn i'd freak out if that happened to me
---
How do you clear the cache?
---
Maybe. This is a lot more fun though.
---
Sarcasm lvl 100 😂
---
U/valseek, still fall thru map upon initial load in, still unable to lock my water purifiers (3large with skins, 1 small, no skin)
---
Reported these bugs in several threads, never any responses.
---
Xbox one x
---
whatever happened to the camp bag not showing up when you wear an outfit that already has a bag on it?   cuz right now its clipping through all my outfit bags
---
I have had great success doing the same thing. I have only run into on tool that sounded like he was from Mobile Alabama and kept calling me the n-word for suggesting being fail to the lowbies...
---
Why removing the quest?
---
Me too - mobile internet limits r.i.p
---
Maybe its me remembering it wrong them - I get 281 because for some reason the ultracite cores I craft end up with some level beyond 100%.
---
Plenty of FPSs have been doing it for ages, it's not difficult.. lmao
---
it's not a boolean value (on or off). if they are doing anything about it, you wouldn't know - how could you? they might be reducing the amount of accounts available to people for this kind of thing. it could have a noticeable impact.
---
a better question to ask - instead of "are they doing anything about it?" - is "what/how much are they doing about it?", which no one except themselves really can answer. i'm also sure they are not willing to disclose exact methods of tracking people down. but given the amount of ban sweeps that have come, it's safe to assume they are doing \*something\*.
---
i can wear it with my imposter sheepsquatch helmet so i assume all hats can be worn with it on
---
Who cares ?
---
God I hope so
---
Hold down your Xbox logo on your console till it turns off. When you reboot, the green Xbox splash screen will display if done right.
---
Imagine a nukashine Gatling gun, would look so good
---
Yeah I just can't relate to you at all. I treat people how I'd expect to be treated.
---
Operation what?
---
It exists; I looted it for my collection and this is the only copy I've ever seen.
---
Proof: https://i.imgur.com/YCdY7WT.jpg
---
It wasn't practical even when it was just the SBQ though, let alone the Imposter Sheepsquach.  I don't see a reason to get chuffed about it now.
---
I mean, I guess you're still making an individual decision to participate in these events.
---
I had like 3 of them. I'm on PC and might still have one or two. Definitely put one in my Free vendor, though, lol.
---
Better yet squirrel stew
---
Then the burros what?  Don't leave us in suspense!
---
They cant make it through. Lol
---
excellent - i shall be the creepy bird man of the mire with my survivalists outfit and my cowboy hat. *creepy finger taps*
---
These guys are just dick bags...let others get a hit in.
---
Just got a two star armor form the boss and an arktos lab coat. But it was only 1/3 reward. Trying to get the 3/3 reward to see what’s new.
---
I hope so.
---
I'd like to know which ones also! It would be much appreciated!
---
Artmos Pharma just east of overseers camp
---
I can already tell you he walks around with a Mole Miner's gauntlet or DC with a bloodied build button smashing things in front of low levels
---
I believe I bought mine when it first came for 1200 or 1400 so base it off that
---
What if we already built it in our camp? Is it going to be gone when I log on?
---
Does it start with an event or just go in and Leroy Jenkins?
---
They shouldnt have allowed unlimited leveling. Go the route of WoW, hit a cap and you work on your gear, spec/build/end game content. New content is released and incrementally increase the cap rinse repeat.
---
Maybe, but it seems like the one where you play an instrument or shoot an animal with a syringer wouldn't have been that hard to fix .
---
Smoking is bad for you mmmmmmmkay?
---
I'm excited for people to fast travel into my trap base all the free junk.
---
nice, thanks
---
Well shit, I found nothing lore wise in there :(
---
Happen to me before AND after patch :(
---
This gets my upvote for worst idea I've seen so far!
---
Game crashes to home screen every time I enter the elevator.
---
That's a button mapping issue, so probably not the same fix.  Needs to be addressed though.
---
Reloading reseting the works to see if will fix itself
---
As a alchohol buffed melee main I need to know this info.
---
If you're collecting info from additional people- Crashing when zoning into indoor areas has been happening to me prior to this patch, at least for a month or two now. Once it starts it keeps happening till I log in and wait for a while before trying to go back in. Xbox. Same complete crash to home screen.
---
Oh dear God no!! A real money auction house would be so bad
---
No. If even one person had tested all the scout badges on the live server they would have seen that the instruments don’t register, frog habitat didn’t register, syringer didn’t register. Pretty blatant that there is minimal testing going on in a live test server.
---
your sentence makes no sense.
---
Like me lol
---
Yeah big tobacco is garbage!
---
Nothing shows up for me, just tried?
---
I just made the correlation between drinking in game (which has positive and negative effects) and smoking.
---
The event will start once the elevator opens in the basement. If it doesn’t then it’s on cool down.
---
Wait so the cat and death claw bushes were a mistake? Wow that’s gay I thought that was a cool little add in. I gave you guys props over multiple social media sites. Guess I gotta fix some stuff
---
Lies?
---
Mine is still green...
---
This is on Beth. Everyone should get drops in events just as you would on a team with legendries. If people were automatically on everyone else’s team during all event it would make perk sharing and charisma card actually worth it.
---
“COME ON BACK IF YOU EVER WANNA TRY AGAIN, TOLD YOU ONCE IM THE BEST THERE’S EVER BEEN”
---
The event is probably on cool down.
---
Wait what?! Mine is like the old power armor yellow which wasn't bright..
---
I have the well traveled skin...gonna go try to swap skins..
---
Agreed, if they were originally in the atom shop I'd gladly spend the atoms to unlock them, but since they messed up and everyone could build them, it's ridiculous to have them become locked.
---
There are actual enemy mechanics?
---
Sent you a PM asking for some additional info!
---

---
 &gt; Sent you a PM asking for some additional info!
---
No, there are some plans you can't get any other way but from events. I got a copy of Shielded Raider Under-armor from The Messenger event in the Savage Divide, which is rare as frog's wool and worth about 10-15k. Likewise, power armor plans for Raider through T-Series (the actual plans to build the armor helmets, arms, legs, and torso, not mods) have to be awarded by events or rarely dug up using treasure maps. Tomahawk plans can be obtained from the following:  
---
 [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_Tomahawk](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Tomahawk)
---
You go into Arktos Pharma and take an elevator down. Not sure if there's more than one elevator though.
---
Sorry bro was being sarcastic, last I checked it was never patched in Fallout 4 and they copied and pasted this game from Fallout 4 hence why all these bugs were known and exploited upon game release, and after patch to fix lever action rifle for Fallout 76 was done I still haven't heard if it was patched in Fallout 4. Might jump onto Fallout 4 to see if it finally works properly, stopped playing it since creation club updates often break mods I used.
---
They should let us mod the backlight on it. Changing text color and light color
---
Maybe it's just me, but I would hate that.  Everyone always says how they want human NPCs in the game, but to me NPCs are annoying.  At least with robots there's a *reason* that they repeatedly say the same things over and over (programming).  A human who keeps repeating the same garbage ruins immersion for me every time.
---
And if there would happen to be dialogue trees to navigate through as well?  What a nightmare that would be.  People aren't even patient enough to wait 2 minutes for you to finish your transactions at a vendor before they start whacking at you with a supersledge in an attempt to get you to hurry up.  Can you imagine if you were trying to navigate through all that dialogue?  Count me out.
---
They have to know if the datamined/teased fist weapon is a drop in the new event.
---
Only got a arktos lab coat if that counts.
---
Crashes every time I enter the elevator.
---
I came up on one doing the Rosie's quest. I just stood staring at it for a solid minute and then snapped a picture. It was amazing looking
---
Definitely an easy fix compared to more complex issues. But people see what they want to see.
---
I think your tv might need adjusting...
---
And I thought it was a goodwill add in. Nope! It was a whoops it was a mistake haha no no no now give us money kinda thing
---
Or they're brilliant let people know how to dupe then when you buy a weapon from them you have an unlimited supply of said weapon. Makes the high price tag easier for people to handle
---
I've got the grenade plan... plasma mine eludes me still
---
Agreed. Really put off by this light I have right now. Going to swap skins. Mines not bright at all rn.
---
This is what happens when we pretend that a micro transaction store wont affect actual gameplay.
---
I have explained this in another comment
---
Let us know how one set of maps can be used for any weapons then.
---
It is perfectly possible that he understood that just fine and just took the opportunity to point out that there is not much room for “differentiation“ to begin with.
---
Naming characters is a fundamental element of any gamedesign. Any speculation given so far about why FO76 does not emphasize naming seems unsatisfying so far.
---
My take would be that Bethesda wants to place gamertags prominently in an attempt to make players easier accessible and accountable in case of a controversy.
---
Just event mechanics like protect and collect.
---
F
---
This is one of those things you read and you need to process it for a moment to get it.
---
Thanks for the report! We're currently investigating this and I will let you know as soon as I have any updates.
---
The burrows wasn’t a raid, the burrows is a Wes Tek with ghouls
---
But is it rare? Like the western chaps or other event clothing.
---
Yes it does.
---
Is that not every game in the history of games? 🤔 Same group of enemies, just stronger?? Sheepshquatch is still brand new... let's focus on the kinks and bugs before begging for game breaking bugs Hmm?😉
---
I’d be happy if I could figure out how to do a doorway...
---
"And it's out now"
---
Don’t know. Didn’t see it before and been on since beta.
---
Haha right.
---
Awesome! Sounds good.
---
Damn it actually never got fixed? Now i'm kind of afraid some major bugs will never be fixed
---
Wearing the mining helmets with lamps changes the flashlight to the helmet's
---
Melee still bugged, challenges still bugged, getting 3* armor from the vendor still a risk... guess I’m waiting ANOTHER couple weeks to get back into the game...
---
True, but it sucks for anyone that wants to do any kind of roleplaying.
---
Did you buy/trade the piece from someone else or did you get it as a drop?
---
Dude, chill, the event just came out. Nobody knows
---
-Sincerely,
---
Captain Raymond Holt
---
I know it's new but I'm wondering about items with low drop rates form this.
---
World of warcraft was best at bosses with tactics. So not every rpg is thrash in endgame.
---
I have spares ... at least 3 plans in one of my character vending machines.
---
Maybe fix how when your trying to attach wires in your camp you keep jumping instead of attaching them
---
I  meant say guarantee drop
---
Btw, also ps4 ... will check this evening when I get on.
---
I'm not allowed to be curious??? I'm at work and excited dude.
---
*equips white night, gunsmith and makeshift warrior immediately....... lol
---
Thanks for the heads up il make sure I take back up weapons too
---
Builds with very high damage per shot are very effective vs armor. My stealth sniper 2-shots them as well. My heavy gunner needs to keep spraying for a while.
---
Game crashes for people getting into today’s content and characters deleted. GG Bethesda, def got a winning update here
---
Hey buddy, I'm interested in Marsupial, wont be on for a couple hours yet if you still have
---
Uranium Fever. If I aggro the Legendary, I bring it into the bottom middle after stabbing it with a combat knife. 
---
Other douchewaffles kill it solo in a small dead end room immediately when it spawns.
---
Yes agree 100%. Though i'd like to have different bugs fixed but they definitely shouldn't release new content before all of the major bugs haven't been fixed.
---
So they fixed the Herpetologist challenge bu didnt fix the Medic challenge issue with the Stimpack diffuser not being available in game or the Musician challenge with instruments not being counted as played. One challenge at a time I guess.
---
Thanks for your reply dude, appreciated.
---
When you team once you're in a sever do you invite eachother through the social menu or do you look at eachother and press E to invite?
---
Thank you
---
It's been happing for awhile now
---
Yeah I can make them anytime PSN yota151.
---
Same for me. Went to download the patch expecting to download close to 1 GB. Got 8.48 GB instead.
---
I've only got a 2.85 Mbps download speed, so I better finds some movies to watch for the next 8 to 10 hours. Or go sunbathe a little.
---
Bethesda, fix your patch notes to give accurate patch sizes! And PLEASE for the love of all that is sacred implement actual DELTA UPDATE METHODS to avoid these absurd patch sizes!
---
True that. And now if you stay outside of the workshop, other players won’t kill you- if they want to challenge, they can just take it :)
---
I got it too so not its common
---
It still can be abused. You can figure out your spawn point with a little help.
---
970930
---
Damn, they had us in the long con! I knew it! I guess they expect us to buy some repair kits, go to the nearest weapons workbench, and use those repair kits...oh wait...
---
One set of maps that can apply to any weapons? It's not just time consuming, it's difficult to design. But it's not difficult to make everything look the same, it's just time consuming.
---
Idk about technical issues but it might cause bad PR because it’s easy to lie and say you were banned for no reason and the drama channels will eat it right up. Prime example is the 900 hours guy who had like 60k super ultracite ammo (mathematically impossible to get that much unless you did some absurd grinding for like ten hours a day) whose story still gets spouted around
---
You mean money
---
Have you ever played an online first person shooter? They all have unlockable skins for just about any weapon, usually tied to competing certain feats with that specific weapon, you can also purchase skins for all in game weapons in many of their in game shops.
---
I'm glad you highlighted this; it does really betray where their priorities lie
---
I would absolutely love a Gatling Gun skin, I use most of the heavy guns but haven't gotten any yet, the Fat Man and Minigun skins they out out just aren't that good in my opinion.
---
Looking back, it seems like the .5 updates aren't heavy with bug fixes.  Just a few mainly to repair some bugs from the main patch.  Patch 10 should have many more bug fixes if the trend continues.
---
What can you do to mitigate being seen while youre running around. Does crouching work? Are you even on the radar even if you dont crouch? Im not sure how survival mode works
---
Not wearing one. I just spoke to 3 others at Berkley and asked them to thumbs down if it was the same green and teabag if it was different. 
---
They all teabagged. A level 97 even got on mic and said "it is. Yeah."
---
That's insane
---
Going to try a cache delete on Xbox I’ve heard that works.
---
Yeah, the one I'm asking about is sold by Amazon Warehouse as well. So I feel like they should be aware and know not to sell one with an invalid code, but I'm not sure.
---
Seems like everyone is getting it. I want some rare BS that I'll get bored of in a week to grind for!
---
&gt; I'm just whacking these guys off
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
This guy plays the game differently than I do.
---
Well that's the thing with fallout, when something unexpected happens you never know if it was your fault or if it's actually a feature or a bug.
---
What platform are you on? Just asked a group of people at Berkley and I'm on ps4. 
---
The color is not the same.
---
True. But it’s not the mobs that will kill me- it’s usually the other players who challenge when I’m organizing papers or something. Hated when they could just cheese kill you anywhere on the map
---
Yea that's the point. There are major bugs that effects everyone's playstyle differently. We need a massive bug fix patch. Not more content.
---
Actually thought everyone knew this. Although I suppose the amount of floors or locked rooms I've spawned into should be a clue
---
I ran the event alot and picked up any masks people dropped so im selling them for only 55 caps because I need the space in my stash
---
 Should clarify of the hundreds of camps I’ve visited, two have been traps- and one didn’t work which is even funnier. You’re far more likely to get trapped in the concrete foundation now the game does this sometimes when you FT to a persons camp than you are to get trapped in a trap. 
---
Also you can just FT out if you get stuck in the foundation. 
---
I will note, after inspecting the camp I was trapped in with marsupial, jet pack, FT out and approaching from the outside I got curious and picked on the doors . Sure I got 10c bounty but I don’t care about that, I know having a bounty blocks you from seeing other players on the map BUT it also BLOCKS you from seeing any of the player vendor camps. So I had to jump around blindly looking for someone to kill my bounty off for me.
---
You run a build based off living dangerous....  it can be dangerous.
---
Does anybody here think the light laminate reflects light too much and has a weird shiny effect, even when indoors?
---
Can confirm. Just asked other randoms at Berkley and they said same thing. I'm on Ps4 too.
---
2 guys I was playing with found the code we went down there and explored
---
How was this up for a minute and downvoted already? Downvote bots must be on it today...
---
I wish I could upvote this comment 30 times instead of just once
---
What are the rewards like? Is it a massive faff just for bragging rights (I’m fine with that btw) or does it genuinely reward you for the time, effort and ammo consumption? Many thanks.
---
Yeah, I've used them, but the prices are still prohibitively high for North American copies.
---
Did the event twice with no problems on Xbox.
---
Dunno if it's rare, but i just got [Recipe: Formula P](/spoiler) from it.
---
Grants [+5 Charisma, +3 Luck, and Increased Gun Accuracy for 5 mins](/spoiler)
---
Going to download Fallout 4 on 2nd xbox later after work to find out but in meantime asking fallout 4 reddit if it was patched. Would be sooner but Main xbox covered in cement dust and need to clean before using it.
---
Remind me... what's WoW's bug count? What was it when they first started?? And how many do they have after each new boss??? 🤨 You are comparing apples to oranges because Fallout still needs a many core bugs grinded out before worrying about a whole new beast. I would be willing to bet a $1000, that Beth will do the same with Fallout - contingent on the fact they stick with it.
---
Can confirm this is the same code I collected
---
Adventure. In patch 9 Bethesda said a change was coming to survival beta where the caps lost in survival would be capped at 50 and all players would drop 50. However, it was somehow implemented in adventure instead and no one has said anything
---
Just go around and take pictures for fun since the quests are broke :) (sarcasm)
---
I want more mothman cult stuff
---
Why are you telling us this if part of the quest is figuring out the code? Aren’t you spoiling it?
---
If you have healing factor that will affect it.  You could invest 2 perk points into the Charisma for the healing/rad away works much more quickly.  Can't remember the name of that perk.
---
The DL was 8GB for my on PC? Supposed to be 1GB?
---
I had 100 sheepsquatch too mfkr hit like a brick house too and I’m geared tf out
---
“Not suitable for fresh player” uh huh I’m sure. Where did I hear that from last time?
---
Trying to fire up the "P2W Reeeeeeee" crowd
---
You are  addressing the wrong. Those are issues for developers to solve, not for players. Players can hardly act differently in the given environment.
---
Quad crossbow with fast reload speed isnt bad, but I would only use it as last ditch gun
---
Yao guai in packs of 2 or 3 will stunlock you to death. It's a bit ridiculous. They also hit as hard or harder than SBQ. Thankfully they die really fast.
---
I found **0930 so looks like it's good for everyone.
---
Wonder if it changes weekly like the nuke codes
---
Is there anything else more to this room. We found the code after the event was over and came down here. Killed a few enemies and looted the trunker box.
---
Finished with 3 people including me tho
---
The more you deposit the higher tier they are. We easily finished it the first time around by coop
---
I’m not sure that magazines are technically a bug. Maybe they want you to find them in the Wild not just buy them all
---
Already done mate.
---
I'm just hoping that the latest patch made it so I don't crash every 15 minutes
---
The Challenge for acquiring every disease is still broken since beta. I'm only missing Sludge Lung, which my character currently has. Many other challenges are still not tracking properly, and the actual Challenge Tracker forgets what I'm tracking between sessions.
---
Teleport to the Project Paradise Event.
---
Load Screen finishes and I dead.
---
I resurrect, and then game crashes.
---
Goodbye delicious junk loot.
---
Is it Dandy boys?
---
Right on! I'll added you when i get in, my psn is wacchamp06
---
Sounds like TSE is a solid choice in that case, then. I suppose you’re not running a bloodied build, nor have the wish to do so. TSE is arguably better than furious for a lot of content, since a lot of creatures will die of 1-3 shots, if you have commando perks as well. This of course renders the furious mod rather obsolete. But for higher health priority targets, furious will quickly overtake two shot.
---
Daaaaaamn.
---
Bethesda please fix my humming sound issues on low ammo weapon .  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm0c6w/seriously\_no\_patch\_to\_fix\_audio\_humming\_sound/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm0c6w/seriously_no_patch_to_fix_audio_humming_sound/)
---
You must be new...
---
to like Fallout in general.
---
There a numerous discussions going back to BETA here on reddit, but as is the case for nearly all game mechanics, there is no official confirmation. Could well be misinformation, as I never bothered putting points into a perk with the assumption it wouldn't work.
---
With that said, and all the consistency issues with speed demon and its benefits and penalties, I think there is quite a bit of room for false positives in local testing. Sometimes I don't seem to be getting any benefits from speed demon at all. Run speed seems slower, reload speed doesn't appear to be working. I am also consistently dealing with the full negative effects even though I have class freak maxed.
---
Seems safer to assume it doesn't work, and in the context of the OP, lean towards the +250 DR since regardless of how long you are reloading, you will certainly be reloading very frequently with a single shot weapon.
---
We had lvl 3, lvl 2 and lvl 1. They all got slaughtered in a blink of an eye lol.
---
Love your vids, mate. Been subbed since you worked out how to repair the Sanctuary roofs!
---
The memes are real! Fuck the bag! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
For science.
---
It's supposed to be 30% off...
---
Bird boners for life!
---
bish
---
If you want a top tier weapon on PC, like a B25 or BE handmade or .50 cal, you need to either trade an equivalent item, a full ass/sent or ass/cav or similar set, or MAYBE you can find someone who will sell one for literally 125K (all 5 chars on an account maxed on caps), and honestly that's a steal. And nah, now that I have a B25 .50 cal, that's all I use. Nothing else comes close to the power of that thing. I carry queen fights in 2-3 minutes tops.
---
Then they should stop adding new under average content and fix their things first.
---
Is that how you want the game, and your account if you participate to go down in flames? Cause that’s how you get those to go down in flames.
---
There’s a plague doctor mask- limited time - 500 atoms - a minty looking excavator power armor paint for 800?
---
Thats better, you wont get the -2 perception from wearing it then
---
At this point, every bug still in the game from Beta will never be fixed, because they are too incompetent. Or lazy. THere is no excuse for them to ignore these bugs for this long.
---
Murder traps and mazes sounds like a great time!
---
Not instanced, like the Burrows
---
Great, I didn't get to do any of that.
---
If you tag more than 3 people, no one gets tagged just FYI.
---
They know they cant stop them. They sell the stuff on Smurf accounts. Nothing they can do is the smurf account names arent all compiled onto a list and shown committing the act.
---
I did it three times, had different problems than animals.
---
970930? I haven’t played it yet but someone just shared this passcode related to the event
---
Just brilliant. Someone call Bethesda immediately
---
It's not impossible with a PC, but I highly doubt it's so "simple" with an Xbox, or PS4. I never said it would be a perfect fix, but a good kick in the stones rarely sees a repeat of what caused it. Not to mention 90% of the dupers, are duping because they are too lazy to put in real effort, so do you really think these lazy dipshits are going to go through the trouble of changing their info, or console swapping, when they can't even be arsed with playing a video game, or will they most likely just cry on social media about how it's "not fair that papa Bethesda banned them", and uninstalling the game? I've watched the last few ban waves  and I can tell you that 80% of them cried, and rage quit, while the others tried to rebuild on new accounts. Each new ban wave makes less cheaters, and if they hit super hard, it would see less repeat issues.
---
Uh Xbox has more crashes, I can’t even load into most of the areas without crashing completely I was fine at first but then it all decided to stop working
---
Yes you can, wearing it with the scarlet sniper hat
---
It's true that particular one may not be a bug but it says "Collect issues of *magazine*"  Why is there a stipulation at all. And as far as I'm concerned Finding it at a player vendor is just as rare as stumbling on it in the wild. We all know consuming Mags is basically pointless and no one is consuming them so whats left other than to just save and collect. Whats the point in selling them if it doesn't count as collecting them.
---
Railway
---
operation tidy ....(the daily you do at kiddie corner cabins)
---
Thank goodness!
---
Come on man. He says right in the title it is the code he is going to share  You had to actively click in to be spoiled which you did.
---
I traded a bunch of plans  for it the night before the patch that put BOS plans on vendors. Ended up being a fairly lopsided trade in retrospect.
---
It doesn't spoil anything other than you yourself searching for the code.. as far from I know the event doesn't even require you to go down in the basement.
---
Just a extra bit of random loot and a terminal that adds some extra lore, haven't found else yet
---
What's it called?
---
Formula P
---
Dense combat armor plans are at the Watoga train @ station.
---
On consoles an update can be a complete re-download of the game.  Happened to me on xbone an update or two ago.
---
It can be panic inducing at times.
---
patch is way bigger than 1gb on PC (I'm downloading 8.4GB it says)
---
love your builds!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Some of the descriptions of the used offers literally say that the codes might no longer be valid. I'd say don't risk it.
---
What is your argument? I'm not understanding what is so difficult for a AAA game developer to do here, can you possibly politely explain it to me?
---
Nowhere in the title does it say he is sharing the code. It could just be a post about getting the code or problems with the code or how to get the code.
---
Could is not the same as should.
---
I’ve noticed this too, maybe it’s some sort of internal global cooldown from using other abilities and what not.
---
But they might be stolen.
---
I bought a used AMZ warehouse version. Code was invalid. (Then I bought it new from AMZ and someone had slit the plastic wrap and stolen half the paper insert and the game code along with it.)
---
That is kinda mean
---
Where do you go to find it?
---
It's only a spoiler if you click and look as it's not in the title
---
as far as an aware they can ban your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) Account since no matter your platform you need that to play so if you own it digitally on PC you have to rebuy it on another account if you wish to play
---
Good way to burn through my .308 but the DPS for a newer player with no good legendaries is great for about an hour
---
the one on g2a?
---
That's unfortunate. In online games you have to be ready to deal with various types of people. Don't let these guys ruin your experience. ALOT of people appreciate leaving things to take like purified water and resource nodes.
---
I've just checked it out. I see your point now… Amazing difference, 12 euros vs 41 dolars! I wish all prices for all things in world followed this patern… ;)
---
lmao chill my dude
---
So you your complaint is you dropped something for people to take... and someone took it..
---
Sounds like you cold use an ice cold Nuka Cola after that L
---
I’ve tried everything from hard reset cache clear, reserved space delete and still insta crash as soon as I enter the elevator. Maybe we’ll get to play tomorrow if there’s are hot fix. Best of luck if you find another way lmk . Thanks!
---
Wow. Killed the fuck out of my excitement.
---
Why not give the faction stuff free?
---
im not actually sure what you expected 
---
if i saw a bag of various chems on the ground I'd take them all too
---
Lmao
---
happened 0/3 times for me on XB1....weird
---
Maybe try increasing your luck stat? Mines at 15 but not quite high enough to partake in the event myself.
---
A Fishing skill/hobby whatever would have been a great addition to scouts, a new ‘minigame’ within the game. A ‘pokemon’ type minigame would be cool too, your own pet like dogmeat and battle other pet owners and ‘gym leaders for unique. I digressed a bit there.
---
Regardless some magazines/bobbleheads are bugged. I have never bought any and have more in my inventory than it says I've collected. Have been stuck on 3 or 4 of some of them since January
---
Could means you can. If the event has mechanics that force you team up then there is no "could" only cant.
---
I won’t be in until this evening, but have just started the quest and can assist. I definitely need a party member to revive. PSN: ParzAttacks
---
Yes, a friend of mine. Tried reinstalling and didn’t help. On Xbox
---
This is where carrying a Tesla Rifle is nice. Gets in multiple tags, doesn't crush mobs (well unless they are level 5).
---
While it's mean like others said, that's a chance you take with having everything free.
---
The title doesn’t say that the code is in the post, the title only says that the post is about the code. It could easily be discussing it or discussing issues. I could name a post “last mission of Fallout 76” and it could be simply asking what it’s about or how to trigger it, it doesn’t automatically mean that the mission is spoiled in the post
---
Aye same here, Xbox also. Dashboarded twice.
---
Previously I dashboarded 7 times in a row
---
Ok thanks my bad if I was rude
---
Yea, it sucks in that regard... "Groundhogs day", Fallout style.   
---
Or maybe "The Matrix"? 
---
&gt;*"You think that's irradiated air you're breathing?" -* Morpheus
---
Aaand cue all the other reasons people have come up with for why FO76 as we play it, is all just a simulation for our characters. 
---
Corpses disappearing before we can loot them? Glitch in the Matrix.   
---
Is the Marsupial mutation ***really*** a 'mutation'? Or are we just getting better at hacking the construct's simulated physics which lets us carry more and jump higher? lol
---
&gt;"*Do not try and scrap the spoon. That's impossible. Instead, only realize the truth...  There* ***is*** *no Wooden Spoon. Then you will see that it's not* *the spoon that is scrapped, it is your memory of it."* \- Spoon Boy
---
Cough cough valve cough cough
---
Thats why the biggest greediest mistake you guys made was not having a story mode.
---
I paid full price tricentennial for my pc and full price for my kids ps4 version and got a game where you have a kid level 7 having pvp encounters with chameleonic trolls level 200-300 with twoshot massively op guns that come and kill you for poseidon workshop and esrn a simple 10 cap bounty that you will never be able to get and they steal your junk (and you have the nerve to ask if they want revenge LMFAO) 
---
How about server with level filters? 1-45, 45-100, 100-200...etc
---
How about a 100% ricochet perk for low leveled players, they have to spend countless hours to get a screw, a gear and some lead for them to lose it to op jackasses. Maybe people would start teaming up instead of abusing.
---
How about getting rid of level restricted use (not craft) armor and weapons? You spend all your bullets, weapons and armor to kill some higher level scorched and then when you loot them you realize you wont be able to use it for another 40 levels!!!
---
How about after you scrap a set amount of the same weapon you learn the plan or recipe?? A set amount of scrapped weapons for different mods.
---
How about not leaving up to 100% chance what kind of legendary weapon you get for scrip, its really annoying to get so many black powder guns and never get some twoshot gatling gun. How about letting us choose at least the type pf subgroup within melee or ranged etc?
---
How about allowing bethesda account cross platforms so I can play in the ps4 with my pc built character? That cannot be as hard as cross platform gaming like fortnite.
---
You guys made tons of money with the purchase of the game, and earn money from all of those who enjoy online gaming plus skins and other atom shop items, but some people dont want to be bothered by internet trolls and just want to experience a story mode.
---
I stopped playing ESO and if you guys dont start motivating players by making it a little more beneficial for us, I’ll stop playing this one.
---
I sure hope the new elder scrolls have a story mode or you will lose customers like me.
---
Friendly Fire is a neat perk. You have to get it to level 3 to be effective at all though. It doesnt work with anything but the shishkebab and flamer though which makes it very limiting.
---
It’s an event not like the burrows
---
That is currently the only solution for this bug. I believe it is an issue with an anti cheat detection system if you do "too much damage" in a short timeframe. I get it on my explosive heavy weapons and very frequently on the tesla gun and flamers.
---
Yeah Xbox for me too
---
THE GOLDEN SUPER SLEDGE TO RULE THEM ALL
---
How do we even do the event lol
---
That’d be even better but I feel this way it’s good (not ideal) for the players and for Bethesda
---
I’m glad fixing the topiary and survival bugs were more important than this. Way to read the room.
---
Because most of us would be called God Howard or sth like that
---
Dam cool
---
Try experiencing it once, it's even better! Lol
---
Not with Power User
---
Met you and exchanged some shots. I agree with all these points besides no penalty for no caps. It locks you out of fast traveling and out of camps placement and thats enough penalty.
---
For fun PvP I suggest getting on leaderboards, going to a battleground you define, placing your camp nearby, placing another camp with a opened store for other people and waiting few minutes. They will come.
---
Playerbase asks for / posts about this about once or twice a week.  The people who are the culprits here will NEVER stop, unfortunately.  They are the type of people who only care about one thing -- themselves.
---
Those people are completely different teams, not saying they shouldn't be fixing that stuff but you cant just tell them to start fixing shit
---
D*ck move
---
Good point I forgot that everyone should have Nuka tapper, then I guess not game need be included
---
Lol was wondering why I was suddenly on the load screen (got distracted after fast travelling) . How annoying
---
Dont forget the Level 100 3* Legendaries that drop 1* weapon/armor. First and last time doing this event.
---
Or they could of released a complete game without these various patches....at least from what I've heard
---
Thanks! :)
---
There is an note from an random event in which the writer blames the vault dwellers for anything bad that happened. The writing looks like that of a child and the note give the impression that the writer is still alive.
---
Can we get a fix for the scout mods in enclave please. Currently it's a lottery as it doesn't show what type of armour they are for or for which part (urban or scout, chest or limbs) thanks!
---
That may just be, the *worst* argument for private servers I have ever had the misfortune to read.
---
Someone came into your *unlocked* house, took some *free* stuff, and slept in your bed. And you're *surprised* by that?
---
I would also like a response from Bethesduh on why an "under 1GB' just took up 9GB on my ssd.
---
What were you thinking right before you hit the ground, Evel? What were you thinking?' 
---
I remember thinking: 'Hey, did I turn off the iron?' Then, my leg cracked in half. Then I was thinking: 'Hey, maybe I should get a puppy?'  
---
What do you think I was thinking?  I was thinking "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
---
We can build a fusion generator by hand, but refrigeration technology is beyond us.
---
Agreed.
---
Yes, i have a Core I5 8th generation, GTX 1060 6gb and 8gb RAM. 
---
I will try to change my ini, any tips for it?
---
Neon letters would be better if you could see them from a better distance and also change the color like the light boxes.
---
Well on PC my light is still green, I don't know what to tell you...
---
You get a badge from the event? I've done it 5 times and I don't think I've ever gotten one
---
Thanks homie
---
Which is why PvP should be removed totally from adventure mode.  If people want to PvP, they should play Survival instead and leave other players in peace.
---
The problem is the magazines that spawn at the magazine spawn spot seem to be mostly random.
---
So assuming a magazine spawns in a spot (theres a chance it wont), and assuming no one has taken the mag from the spot, you just to have to pray to rngesus that it picks one of the 7 mags you need out of the 100+ total magazines.
---
The hell you say.  You trying to tell me that running around with more than 80% of your health gone is not a perfectly safe way to be OP?  
---
It's like you're a huge gun of some sort, but made of some super brittle material that can easily shatter...and then sometimes it shatters?  YOU'RE MAKING NO SENSE RIGHT NOW!!
---
Yes. Makes it significantly easier than trying to snap pics in the midst of a firefight. (of course, you then need to find the body, and maybe not have Bloody Mess on at the start... ? Not sure about that).
---
Also, in order to delete a specific character, you must enter their name, so accidentally deleting them isn't possible.
---
Oh my god, this bullshit again. It's fucking ridiculous that people are still bitching about repair kits. It's easy to fix a gun, easy to stock up on materials and have them on hand to quickly fix your weapons, not to mention the weapons workbenches that are in abundance.
---
#CryBabies
---
Mutants does not stack like junkies does.  Probably because the majority of us are like you rocking 8 to 10 mutations which are already quite OP compared to not being mutated.
---
It's not difficult to have multiple skins for all weapons, but it's challenging to have one set of skin that can apply to any weapons, as I replied to the poster who suggested that skins for the level action and bowie knife can be applied to any weapons. Even if everything look the same, like wood texture, each weapon's skin has to be made to fit.
---
Wait were we not supposed to have those?
---
I say find yourself an acid node somewhere in the world. I have my camp set up in an acid node surrounded by a scorchbeast. Noisy neighbors I tell ya. Constantly making noise at 2:30 in the morning when I'm trying to sleep.
---
This is a beautiful set up. How does the radiation to health regen work? My build is very similar with more of a focus on team healing, and alchohol buffs. Full set of life saving armor keeps me on my feet so I can heal and revive teammates. I use the shishkebab with level 3 friendly fire to heal teammates while taking iut pesky mobs that attack them.
---
Private servers probably wont happen anytime soon if at all.
---
Sorry wrote that on my phone and its all kinds of bad Grammer
---
RIGHT?
---
That'd be awesome!
---
Not very well. You have to defend three very distant critters
---
What is the workaround? I've not seen one :T
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Thank you so much for this.
---
Yeah he got it right, I bought a two shot explosive Tesla rifle 90% reduced weight. Things badass
---
YES TO ALL THIS!
---
This still makes me laugh. There's a mechanic that adds everyone to like a temporary team for the event, but the the proximity kill of teammates doesn't apply...
---
You are kind of asking for a handout.. just saying.
---
Found out what it is. Color bug after completion of PP. Spoke to large group of people. The gamma will not return to normal. You know the moment in completes the shift in color? Is sticking for a lot of people on ps4 and will not return to normal until server hopping.
---
I don't think it should be removed from workshops.
---
8.5 as well on PC here
---
Awesome!
---
I can't even get to a server. I'm in perma-loadscreen. :(
---
Well it does make the stuff feel a bit more exclusive
---
Mine was 8.5 as well
---
I've found the tourist more often at wavy willards water park, in the parking lot you spawn in against the side of a car.
---
Thats just the owners fault for placing it in a baf location move it and it will be fine
---
Its a drug, increases CHR, LCK and improves gun accuracy.
---
German descriptions for all Challenges are fucked up. For example in the music tab are challenges with Scopes etc....every challenge text did get changed into something stupid
---
The movespeed effects I researched around January, and yeah, its a movespeed cap. Not just speed demon not stacking. I guess the best way to test is pop some rad-x, reload my 50cal (it’s a good 5 second reload baseline), time it, add the reload perk, time that, wait for rad-x to wear off, time that, remove perk, time that. So times for each possible permutation.
---
It was a toilet thought for me.
---
I do my best thinking with numb legs
---
That one seems like the easiest (though there may be other spots that are easy as well).  Log in, walk 10 steps, check, log out, repeat.
---
I see it there occasionally, you may have to hop a hit to find it though.  I don't think there are any locations that are more likely to have it than any others.
---
Isn't it an event? If so, there is no friendly fire during an event and in the event zone. Also, I am not aware of any options to "reject" an event. Don't you simply get notification that you are joining an event as you enter its vicinity and the only way to leave the event is to leave the area.
---
I wish that after 3 "Level 2 Nuclear Alerts" where it isn't fixed it melts down with effects similar to a nuke going off.
---
What was missing from the scout challenges
---
Exactly. For those familiar with game theory, the choice is clear:
---
Do unto others, then split.
---
What do you mean "Those people are completely different teams" I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Anyone know how often the event can be triggered? Debating making a team to do this, but not sure if there would be a long wait.
---
Also, anyone notice if we can accidentally harm out critters we have to guard? Mine just suddenly died and I am not sure why.
---
Building is my favorite part about 76 so i definitely will
---
Rule 34 gonna go in full effect right after that face reveal.
---
There is a plague doctor mask, (beak looking thing you’ve seen in assassins creed/bloodborne, an Arktos excavator power armor paint which is teal and black, a Nuka cola backpack, a gold skin for a combat dagger, a blue door for your camp, a brown colored stash box, and a brown skin for your camera.

**Issues Fixed in**  [**Fallout 76: Wild Appalachia Patch 9.0 – May 7th, 2019**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)   
---
**Issue: Railway Rifle Automatic Receiver does not Benefit from "Ground Pounder" Perk.** (Ticket Submitted on 02-07-2019)
---
RailwayRifle "Railway" \[WEAP:000FE268\]
---
mod\_RailwayRifle\_Receiver\_Automatic1 "Automatic Piston Receiver" \[OMOD:001AC258\]
---
Changing the Receiver from Standard to Automatic, the Perk does not seem to be effecting the Weapon.
---
Considering the Railway Rifle Benefits from NO other Weapon perks, this should be a no-brainer, however it would require the addition of either the Railway Rifle keyword to the perk, or adding the "Rifle" Keyword to the Railway Rifle, honestly for balance reasons, and considering how worthless the weapon currently is, adding the Rifle Keyword, WeaponTypeRifle \[KYWD:0004A0A1\] would be an easy way to rebalance the weapon and make it worth considering.
---
\*Note:\*
---
*I am sure one or more of you will likely think this is QoL and not a Bug, but the Railway Rifle was supposed to be an Exotic Weapon, but that whole perk line was cut, so the weapon in it's current condition is not usable in any realistic way*.
---
I would love to complete the main quest line, but these bugs are more important.
---
I use mine all the time.  I don't always get responses but the times I do is usually pretty cool.
---
excellent.  thank you.  I'm pumped.
---
This is what I’m wondering.  The cat is standing on the bar in my camp,  it’s my bar cat.
---
Same here. Grafton Dam along with Galleria Mall and another site in the Mire, there's a few bugged for me. I'm at least 80 atom points down.
---
Gonna try this now 👍🏾
---
True - they can fix this by removing the slap/non-Pacifist outside of workshops.
---
That should be the only aspect of pvp in adventure mode.
---
Hey after my PS4 updates count me in
---
Sorry don't have that place unlocked
---
You can go into your pip boy while in an event, go to data events, then go to the event you are at and press X or Square to reject it. Now you srent on a team and friendly fire isnt an issue
---
Nope , we are on the same train again my friend . They still haven't had plan to fix this issues :/  contact bethesda reddit staff on reddit also no respond :((
---
What's broken about melee?  My level 201 main character is melee... haven't noticed anything wrong.
---
Server hop at the spawn points for it. It is fairly plentiful.
---
Received mine on first hop at Miners Monument.
---
so happy, this was maddening.
---
Cool thank for the response just wanted to make sure there wasn't something wrong with mine
---
Yup, I have the plans, tossed 6 around my base to fend of the random things that attack it.
---
&gt; just trying to point out that survival mode isn't gangs of thugs waiting invisibly near 76 to pwn you as soon as you spawn in.
---
Don't believe him, it's a trap!
---
Oh yea what happened to the nukashine minigun skin?
---
Yes, the only one they fixed is the frog habitat. I’d suggest not trying anything unless they include it as fixed in the patch notes
---
Damn, I'm sorry that happened. That's what I was afraid of. Did you get your money back at least?
---
I crashed to dashboard both times attempting to enter the basement and also when I clicked on join event. I restarted my Xbox - same thing
---
yea... this is my point exactly. Without buying them from other players the challenge is near impossible.
---
What ingredients does it require?
---
Man i think they broke the patch lmfao my budget wont go down and i can use wires just deleted a turret, half wallsb a regwall, conduites and a garagedoorwith coded entry still exceeding budget. FmL i was up all night bulding that beauty and i can use it. 
---
Thanks Beth.
---
So, an update. I moved some other files to external HDD and had roughly 65 Gb left on my main drive. Now it downloads 8.48 Gb of files for this update. I was playing fine yesterday and this update was planned to be around 1 Gb on PC. I'm not sure about anything at this point.
---
now do possum plz!
---
Did you guys find anything interesting down there? Both times I've been down there there was nothing even after one failed and 1 completed events
---
8.5 on mine also
---
Can you still wear a hat with it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/boy3e8/comment/ennyeah
---
Upload images to imgur.com, post link here. I'm interested to see them.
---
If your team is in passive mode then you won't. I want instanced dungeons too, but this is really grasping at straws. You can do the same thing at SBQ fights.
---
Same thing they did to 2se explosive shotgun  maybe a ninja nerf that when wrong.
---
Code is 970930 if anyone else wants to go down
---
I clicked join event and dashboarded actually so
---
And get sent to dashboard every time I try to enter the basement
---
Now they fucked up german challenge texts. i bet all the german players get a fix at the earliest of a month. Updating Atom shop is more important :(
---
We (friends and me) had so much fun doing challenges and stuff. Now we are stuck again and can farm some scrib oder SBQ :(
---
“Greed” comes with the territory. I don’t like it but I’m a fucking adult and understand how shit works. Would I like a better response from Bethesda? Absolutely.. but on the other side of the spectrum actions speak louder than words and I’ve become appreciative of their efforts in repairing this game and the consistent improvements and additions. I think you’re confusing desires with entitlements.
---
Yea... you can’t do anything
---
And easy to receive even better repair kits from ingame events 😂
---
People have been exploiting this during some events already.  Perhaps the real fix is to make all player fire as friendly fire in the event zone/area so a rejection doesn't allow them to exploit this.
---
Someone must have bought it off me. Sorry
---
Its actually not my idea. If I knew the name of the originator I would state it to give them full credit. Unfortunately I don't.
---
That’s the one were you punch in a number on a keypad right ?
---
Fuck that. It’s great for stealth builds.
---
I have both the armour plated and high capacity backpacks. The armour mod offers 91 damage resistance, so it’s totally worth it. I use when I’m pvp’ing or farming legendaries. Then use the high capacity backpack when I’m farming junk.
---
I server hopped about 20 times on my alt to get the camera from the top of the lighthouse just east of Vault 76. The same place where you do Path of Enlightenment event with fireflies.
---
Every time I’ve attempted the Camp Fire one this happens. It’s a waste of time.
---
Because the pacifist system would mean nothing would happen, or are you saying that would bypass it somehow?
---
1 gig extra data yes
---
Lol what a joke, doesn’t affect my gameplay at all mate
---
Wait the cargo bots box thing causes a strike when you take from it? 
---
I’m sitting on three(I think) key cards and never noticed anything. Maybe I just didn’t stick around long enough.
---
When you’re in an event player names change color to resemble the “teamed” coloration.  When a teammate kills something within a certain range of another they can both loot the corpse but only the killer gets exp if the other teammate didn’t get a hit.
---
This should apply to all events (minus PvP events of course).
---
i only use them to make phantom devices.  so they work for that 😁
---
It's a shame that playing the game optimally always seems to involve not playing as the devs intend.
---
I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what, but like 9/10 times I leave the world and relog, I get put right back into the world I left.
---
I make some junk runs, and porting in to Mama Dolche's to hit the power armor and junk shed before heading to cat lady house almost always triggers the quest.
---
My group goes through the social menu and it seems to work. We play on PS4 and do have problems if the game crashes. It will say you are on a team but you are not. We solved this by leaving team and invite again.
---
I received recipe:formula P
---
What you don’t like getting a one star wooden armor after using all your stimpaks and 16 tons of ammo /s
---
No idea mate
---
I meannnn I got nothing better to do so I'm down for some grinding.
---
HE’S RIGHT! FUCK THE BAG!
---
This... They should absolutely give these people the ban hammer
---
And homemade pemmican is fantastic.
---
Could it possibly be that someone figured out your username/password (like maybe a roomate/sibling with a grudge, or maybe some random kid hacker)?  If they log in it might be what's kicking you out for no reason.  Then they quickly delete your character... for sh\*\*s and giggles? =/
---
Hopefully you can get some character restoration.  But change your password just in case!
---
I don’t get it. Dark Souls 3 could allow character and/or account names.
---
The Burrows big brother coming over to beat us up.
---
I blame the people who end up supporting dupers and glitchers. Without a platform they have nothing. The top tags on youtube are "fallout dupe" "fallout glitch" "how to glitch 76" ext. It's a shame to be honest. I make random content and get downvoted to hell,  Granted I do spam but whats a guy gotta do to get noticed around here? Box logan paul? I only have one eye but im rickety like a cricket so I might got it. What do you guys think?
---
If you're wanting to use stims faster, just wear power armor and dilute all your stimpaks. You can just mash the button then.
---
I'd reccomend using chemist and super duper when diluting them to get the most stims possible
---
I just started playing a month ago so I didn’t know they actually didn’t drop before, I’ve seen them but they are very rare legendary pieces so I thought it was just a case of bad rng my bad.
---
try running back to the elevator again, event started for me then
---
It’s a direct counter to “junk wants to be scrapped now”. Yes, you can wait to scrap (or manually scrap) if you already know what things are needed to be saved. 
---
The OP is specifically asking about what needs to/might want to be saved. You said scrap everything. I’m saying no, some things have uses un-scrapped. There’s other examples as well. Which is exactly what OP was asking about. 
---
Radscorpion stingers for bleedout syringers are another example. I’m sure there’s more.
---
2 hours ago.
---
What they said last time.   
---
Doubt.
---
I caught on that if you pick a common enough name, the Mr. Handy inside vault 76 will address you as such. Then never again haha.
---
This is the better alternative really - keep PvP in a totally separate game mode.  If not trolls will be trolls and find ways to exploit the loopholes.
---
yes
---
Just got mine took about 8 times at whitespring butbthanks anyways
---
Its just a tesla rifle for the time being....
---
Denzel: My man.
---
I figured I was already Inside the nuka shine figure 3 birds one stone , but none work lol 
---
I did finish my frog habitat
---
I said before the Event starts. Me and a good amount of people loaded in and waited for it too start. Worked fine and no one Dashboarded.
---
Maybe ya the one preventing me from doing the quests.
---
Sorry. I need to go outside more than anyone
---
I thought that's already what was happening. I was unaware of this other 'exploit.'
---
Well that will be fun in a week then. Another event that will be very soon abandoned, meaning I wont be able to get all the rewards.
---
I was here and the event wasn’t active - waited for the event to show up and clicked the elevator button - dashboard
---
I know, this was my way of saying I wish it was instanced
---
At least half of players dont walk around in pacifist.
---
Ash rose, kaleidopore flower, blood leaf, and antiseptic
---
I was going to point out the same. Airlines had customer service laws passed because they got so horrid. IN the US they have several standards they have to meet or be fined out the wazoo. they are not offering $400 and a hotel room for a flight overbook because they love you.
---
Ok thanks 👍
---
King Kong ain’t got shit on us!
---
I'm also melee, without power armor, not the best armor pieces, and with some nice food (alioli mirelurk with carnivore), a drug (psicobuff), whisky (nuka dark better) and a silencer weapon I can take 4-5 hits before dying.
---
I have 9 END and blocker wich is a must for that last lvl 100 creature.

Also, lvl 3 INT +health from stims helps a lot.
---
You had two weeks to place as many as you wanted to. Quit begging for free shit and smarten up.
---
If you were already in the lower level why did you use the elevator?
---
Medic's Shotguns definitely have a clear advantage over any other gun type but they also have their own downsides built in. I tried to mitigate those downsides as much as I could via perk cards, legendary gear, mods, and drugs. Just by general feel the shotgun uses AP in between a pistol and a rifle but I don't know the exact numbers (it feels good to me). I wouldn't say it drains too fast or too slow which is why I put it between those two other weapons I've used a lot. As with any build you can drain your AP quickly if you want to but I've found it's much better to manage that resource wisely on any of my vats builds not just as a medic (you end up doing a mix of vats and hip-firing which I personally enjoy). I recommend at least one piece of legendary armor with the "increased action point refresh speed" on it (more if you can manage, max is 3 IIRC). Often times you may want to bank/save a critical or your AP and then just use hip-fire instead of using vats (but if you run the team medic card it's less necessary to bank a critical exclusively for healing someone). If you use vats you should already be modded for hip-fire accuracy (vats uses the hip-fire accuracy of the gun). The only mod I don't use max hip-fire accuracy on is the stock and there I use precise for the durability. I also highly recommend always using the highest armor penetration mod you have for the magazine (perforating) because shotguns fire many low damage hits. I do not use unyielding on my medic although that is an option I could try. I haven't changed my gear in a long time but there is no reason why I can't try out different legendary effects. Since I used to farm silo's and whitesprings a lot I have gear suited towards that that also supports my build ( [https://imgur.com/a/qETF9wj](https://imgur.com/a/qETF9wj)). I use shielded raider leathers as under-armor, and one piece of armor is missing ultra-light). I haven't updated my gear or tried different gear setups for several months though (I was playing other builds and then I took a break). I do have many different shotguns each for a different situation or enemy that I switch to regularly but I primarily just use two shotguns, one for healing, crippling, and general usage ([https://imgur.com/a/BHRwHWX](https://imgur.com/a/BHRwHWX)) and a prime shotgun for when the SBQ lands ( [https://imgur.com/a/b4etg5K](https://imgur.com/a/b4etg5K) ). I still have a lot of testing yet to do with this build especially after farming a lot of legendary gear on other builds.
---
No? If you use white knight it does.
---
I think I'll probably only carry the high capacity for an overweight fast travel crutch like one user said. Pvp and legendary farming would be the armor plating. Though the refrigerator mod will most likely be my casual play.
---
It'd be awesome if you could declare a faction in game, and have yourself tagged.
---
I think it might be a bit further down the dev roadmap, but we can hope :)
---
how do you know?
---
My main is a Beta character,  when I was leaving vault 76 one of the handys said “finally awake eh miss eve?” ( her name is Eva) they didn’t say anything to either of my two alts made after the game went live.
---
Maybe there was going to be a Codsworth style system of bots knowing names?
---
Get a letter plan and write out the rules of your house on the wall so people know not to follow them and piss ya off more.
---
+F
---
So many times I have been mass scrounging and just ended up sitting down for a breather.
---
Are you sure it's not a feature? lmao cool
---
Just got the bear arm skull fist weapon from the project paradise event
---
Cool! Add my psn
---
Amen
---
I can’t get to the lower level - it dashboards me everytime I try to go down..
---
It has actually
---
yeah, having some problems myself. not running bloodied but seems i cant push couple seconds after last attack animation
---
Maybe they meant gigabutts. Those are to gigabytes what gigabits are to gigabytes.
---
Trolls will be trolls either way. They'll spend 20 minutes luring a SB across the map to your camp.
---
if you can make it, you can place it at someone else's camp.
---
ARKTOS Pharma in the Forest. Just Southwest of Morgantown I believe.
---
Nothing inside. Phew....
---
I hope they do this!
---
Guess you didn't read the post from early last week where they listed every single day for the following 2 weeks what items would be on sale which day.
---
I found one in whitesprings in that spa place. It was in a container so it was probably random though.
---
Epic. Am I fucked with my bloodied tank build?
---
That event is getting unplayable.  Fuckwits running around one shotting everything.
---
Sure. Can you max rewards solo? No.
---
Yes! Noticed this one the other day while trying to axe a couple stingwings.
---
There’s rumors that crossplay may actually be happening very soon, across all consoles.
---
I'm getting on now.
---
They have teams of people who work on content, fix bugs, make atomic shop stuff ect... you cant just tell them to drop what they are doing and work on something they have no idea about
---
Heh... remember when they had two weeks of camera challenges and no camera? I mean, testing would have been as involved as "log in and look at the map screen."
---
According to the patch notes, they fixed two "rare issues" that could occur "under specific circumstances".
---
I guess asking them to address *common* issues that occur *every f\*cking time* is just misguided hate-mongering.
---
I wish Bethesda would fix some of these, its so easy to do.
---
If you kill the Queen everyday you'll get buku stable flux to craft fusion cores. 
---
High science levels will have you crafting them above 100%, I usually make 107% cores myself. 
---
Combo this with super duper to legally duplicate them and you will have so many fusion cores you'll be sick of them.
---
It’s not horrible though. You can server hop and do the event over and over. I’m glad this event isn’t instanced honestly. Took 6 of us to do it, 3 level 100 3 star legendaries are insane.
---
A pack of themed skins for multiple things isn't uncommon.
---
Interesting. Are the solo rewards worth it? I don't much like grouping. It's a flaw in my character.
---
Bethesda made it so you can't slap anyone in an event - everyone in the event is considered as a friendly like they are on the same team.  Players simply found a way to reject the event and all they have to do is stand in front of someone that might have forgotten to turn on their Pacifist, then they can PvP back against you.
---
There is a way to see this when you're in an event but in the chaos people might miss it.  The name of players should show up as a lighter yellow if they rejected the event and are attempting this exploit.
---
Haha 🤣 it’s optimal to beat the meat.
---
The three foxes that spawn at the BBQ Shack are untamable. They are a fixed spawn. Not really sure why Bethesda decided that fixed spawns were untamable, but whatever.
---
Just the one elevator.  If you want to do it all fairly fast bring a couple friends. You will need to do habitat a b and c relatively quickly.  At the bottom in C there is a coded door as well.  It is easy to find the code but spoiler:  970930 is the code.  It's basically Burrows with a boss mob 100 at the end. Pretty easily soloable tbh.
---
8.46 gb
---
If you can cripple whatever the lv 100 enemy is I guess you could. 
---
I was doing it with 4 people and when the fog crawler showed up two people just left. One guy died and didn't come back and it was just me and some on else. I crippled it after it killed the thing I was supposed to protect.
---
Wheres this?
---
same with all the Graften Mayor announcements. Man he's annoying!
---
While I agree that everyone that contributes should get a chance at good loot, we all know that if mechanics change towards that, then we'd have several AFKers in every event, scaling up the difficulty and just lying on the ground sleeping or chameleoned anywhere or even in photomode and permanently AFK.
---
Dope. Good looking out 🤘👍
---
This works just tried after 10 failed attempts!
---
Or the good ol’ “take a timeout” while ghouls are running you down at the Whitespring golf club.
---
I've had this happen before. I never got it out no matter what I tried. It will most likely live there until you move your CAMP.
---
It's a different format, but someone else did tadpole and possum. Here's a link to the thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i\_made\_an\_interactive\_checklist\_for\_all\_pioneer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/)
---
If melee is still broken I'm gana be pissed I have allways defended this game but I'm getting tierd of the bs stuff getting fixed when pretty serious stuff is broken
---
Yea I killed a fog crawler and got a 1 star item from it.
---
which one did they fix? and which other ones are bugged?
---
I see you found it, but for reference the water park is in the center of the northern most part of the map. Incase you want to do the swimmer challenges for tadpole
---
Teams of more than 4 should be a thing anyway.
---
The issue was them not dropping a legendary. They said that just because it is a 3*, it will not mean it drops 3* each time, its mostly just the possibility
---
how do you hit triple digits and not have marsupial?
---
This worked for me as well thank you
---
right on, headed your way now....
---
I’m sure it will be easy after every one gets the mechanics and layout down. It’s not a destiny raid after all. That’s why it’s free.
---
I'm pretty sure that's where mine spawns me anyway, it's a little annoying tbh
---
Been doing vlogs for a couple of years + instagram &amp; twitter have my face, so people be slackin.
---
Like maybe a third game mode “faction war” or something. A mode where you have to declare a faction (at least for a given length of time) and you earn points for PVP against members of other factions while playing in that game mode which can then be redeemed for non-tradable faction-exclusive rewards (PA paints, outfits, camp things, etc).
---
VATS keeps not working. It will be stuck at 0% regardless of how far away you are. Also sometimes even if you do "hit" in VATS it doesn't deal any damage. It even consumes your critical without doing any damage.
---
It seems to be worse on "flying" enemies like bloodbugs. 
---
Basically you can't reliabiliy use VATS right now with melee.
---
Server hop 76.
---
It looks great. Thanks for putting it together. It's a shame you didn't fine /u/Lunaeria's checklist which is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i\_made\_an\_interactive\_checklist\_for\_all\_pioneer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/)
---
Duration?
---
You can use the repair kits without a workbench. Go to your Pip Boy, choose inspect and choose Repair Kit.
---
This is how I died last night. Your character takes ages to get up from laying down.
---
You can use the kits from your pipboy.
---
Then.  
---
Don't.  
---
Shoot.  
---
It.  
---
Problem solved, and the ones that DO want it, get it.
---
This is going to be the first "limited time" item that I purchase.  I'm oddly excited about that.
---
My main uses unarmed. So powerfists, deathclaws and meat hooks.
---
Because Bethesda cannot even code their launcher right.  It is why i bypass their launcher.
---
Kind of disappointed there are a few enemies under level 50 to be honest.
---
I realise I might need to play it for context, but stuck at work.
---
Dammit.
---
Yea, there's still an hoard of items that have been datamined and haven't shown up in the shop yet.
---
Same here, I fired it up, saw the size, came over here, and went "huh? what the hell?"
---
I mean I'm cool with a big patch and not worried about it anyway, but like, this isn't a lot of stuff here, what is going on?
---
I am bloodied power fist user. U can do it, you will die few times.
---
5 minutes
---
Also melee can’t hit flying enemies atm
---
Yup or launch a nuke at it.  But let's not enable them or let them profit from it.  PvP exploits allow them to profit via caps and junk.  Destroying your CAMP is mostly just a waste of time and there's no profit in it.
---
There's no reason for it to not be an MMO.
---
It's a side game, not a mainline title, every now and again Bethesda tries this like back with the Gameboy Elder Scrolls games.
---
If Devs don't try new things, we don't get new things.  
---
Not to mention with a continually updating system in an MMO Fallout like this, Fallout 5 can have a lot of it's development time cut by seeing things like camp building perfected or mutations etc, which would allow for more budget to be spent on story development.
---
Seriously, I have over twenty without even trying.
---
Yea, I love the look of some masks like the scout one, but it sucks that they give that -2 per
---
&gt; **lvl 5** 3* Quad Explosive .44
---
Holy epic failures, Batman.
---
They just fixed Herpetologist.  Musician and Chemist didn’t get fixed (syringer shooting doesn’t work, tried like 10-15 times on each animal).  Medic doesn’t work cause Stimpak diffuser doesn’t exist (unless it was a plan that came out with today’s new event).  I can’t remember the others without it in front of me but I think there’s 1 or 2 others!
---
Really cool event, was a blast. We failed though, I was the only one following the last friendly with 10% hp while the others fought around. Only so many wolves, fliers and crickets i can take out fast lol
---
Thanks but i already use Power armor and i have enough stimpacks
---
Even the raiders in Fo76 can be represented by this line I guess?
---
It's not an orbital strike, it's just the box self destructing. After you pick its lock it gives a 5 minute audio countdown then does a nuka nade/mine/car sized explosion.
---
I was several hundred hours in and a couple dozen drop boxes in till I finally decided to hang around to see the explosion.
---
Check your collections tab. In my experience you don't get a notification like other event rewards, it just sort of shows up.
---
My alt has a pretty strong one. Plus you can mod it to actually just look like an axe.
---
That I do agree with, should be up to 8 imo. But in the current team state at least, I’m thankful it isn’t instanced.
---
Good to know, thanks :)
---
Not going back into the land of the so-called "healthy"!
---
I was attacked by an invisible enemy before the update today. problems been around since BETA unfortunately. :(
---
I would have to say that the hundreds of posts about this topic since launch answers your question for you
---
Also store any first aid items you don't want to lose. You can lose a lot of first aid items in survival mode.
---
Yes, there was no issue with the return.
---
Ah I smell NVMP
---
It feels like a lag to me
---
What event?
---
I thought that to and changed it way back when it first started happing and it still happened, do you think they still do refunds
---
I play it as a "lone wanderer survival game" interacting on as it comes and helping lower level players as best I can with small supply drops and game tips. I do not wear power armor,  enter nuke zones, don't care about the main quest. that's just my play style. and I love the game,  I find the game suits my play style perfectly.
---
Mine does around 200+
---
Definitely
---
So has human npcs
---
It's not instanced, so it's probably fine while it's new. If you're down there completely alone, no way the rewards outweigh the cost solo.
---
They have certain set spawn locations. I observed the chance of them spawning at each location is 5%ish per server session. Build your camp near one and hope for the best.
---
Enjoy!
---
Someone else suggested walking to the Pharma from Gauley mine and it did enable me to enter the basement without crashing on Xbox
---
Neither have I.
---
Why haven't you reported your test results?
---
&gt;Which is why PvP should be removed totally from adventure mode
---
This is never going to happen, so turn on pacifist mode to avoid the statistical anomaly in the op. 
---
Problem solved without ruining the fun for anyone.
---
Just bring it into Survival tbh. Give a faction bonus for declaring, then let the rest sort itself out :P
---
Declaring for a faction makes you visible on the map regardless of stealth though!
---
Damn. Hopefully a fix comes soon! I filed a bug report, but I'm not sure if that's the same as a support ticket. I'll look into to it and let you know!
---
They didnt gift it, they arbitrarily tied it to a time frame and took it away and then, limited time only, allowed you the "privilege" of buying it.
---
I don't know what this means, but I hope it smells nice?
---
Starts once every hour on a server.
---
I got the formula p recipe or maybe f not sure
---
Possibly, though I'm thinking if they can resolve the issue they likely wouldn't refund you.  
---
I'm curious what the issue will end up being, do you mind letting me know or including an edit to your post when they figure it out?
---
After the event I just went off exploring and there were enemies everywhere still. Max level assaultrons, max level ghouls. 3 star enemies. Was fun. 
---
I have to do some running around but I just want to keep exploring. Ahhhh
---
Holy shit dude it is not only 5gb I have 50g left on my system and it’s wanting 40gb for this update. These updates are getting way to big. It would be a different story if they would add in stuff that’s actually fun but it isn’t
---
I can't find the stuff to deposit. Where and what is it

---
Very strange!  I have not experienced any of these issues at all... and I use VATS regularly.
---
Bosses are cryptids bosted to lvl100. So basicaly boring mob with insane damage nothing more.
---
Place is buggy, textures in air, invisible enemies, disconecting,....
---
Reward is meh, but i don't care much about being rewarded.
---
I am extremly disappointed, they should balance SBW and imposter sheepsquatch instead....
---
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.
---
This does not look like 8 gigs worth of patch notes.
---
How many alive if I may ask?
---
Exactly. Fortnite has weapon wraps that apply to all weapons.
---
you are not on the map unless you are on the leaderboard, which contains only the longest surviving players
---
I have experienced this as well... Most people will downvote anything that says something negative about the game it's really annoying.
---
I know Class Freak 3 used to reduce the penalty to -1 while not in a group. I haven't checked on recent patches though, and mutations do seem to get bugged and patched lots.
---
Lmao you may be on to something there 🤔
---
If you server hop, enemies will not load for you so you will die to invisible mobs. It is so funny and enjoyable....
---
Very true. I remember a year there where it was 90 degrees fahrenheit (I'm an American, lived there for a few years) and had sunlight for 2 days, and after that, summer was pretty much over. Where I was, it was perpetual fog and rain, or cloudy 24/7. The sun is just a construct in the sky that the government wants you to believe is this thing called "the sun". No such thing exists in the UK.
---
I use a lvl 10 pump action I've named "teamwork" for when I'm around other people.
---
I knee cap things with the enforcer perk so others can get a hit in.
---
Loot really needs to be prox based though...
---
Honestly, I don't carry low level weapons because they weigh too much as is.  Try to get faster on the trigger so you get a shot in.  Also, specifically in the Campfire Tales, the fire burns down FAST on the third stage of the bug waves so if you don't kill the legendary fast enough the fire goes out and you fail.
---
So just get faster on the trigger finger.
---
I got it for completing the event.
---
Requires:
---
 - 1x Antiseptic
---
 - 2x Ash Rose
---
 - 1x Bloodleaf
---
 - 2x [Kaleidopore Flower](/spoiler) - unique to this event area
---
I haven't used it yet, but [I assume it has the downside of aggroing everything near you, based on the lore I saw in the event](/spoiler)
---
How is the performance on consoles? Slideshow or surprisingly good?
---
Definitely overthinking it, but perhaps one could attribute some symbolism to it anyway. 
---
What you refer to as the “pulse sign” is actually the output of an ECG machine when monitoring the electrical activity of the heart. This “pulse sign” on the responders logo is representative of the electrical activity occurring during a single cardiac cycle (“heart beat”). The positive and negative reflections in the symbol are indicative of different cardiac events occurring during a single cardiac cycle.  For instance, that first projection is called a “P-wave” and represented the electrical activity associated with atrial depolarization. The larger, bidirectional reflection toward the middle is called the “QRS complex” and the final projection is called the “T-wave”. 
---
Under normal, resting, healthy conditions the electrical activity will look pretty much exactly the way the “pulse sign” looks on the responders emblem which leads me to believe that the symbolism you attribute to the design is not actually there.
---
They should obviously give a temporary boost to charisma since smoking makes you look cool.
---
Community : The burrows are too easy that suck ! Arktos is difficult that suck &gt;:(
---
That's only partially true. If Bethesda really cared, they'd concentrate all their resources on fixing the bugs
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
After patch 9. I had this happening with ghouls. Now when i was at new event i was killed by invisible enemies multiple times.
---
95 degrees today in good old Hot Carolina
---
Great list. I'd like to add, five back the buzzblade damage the took away last update.
---
I know its never going to happen.  Bethesda seems to enable this bad behavior as is.  Pacifist is a lousy solution that requires a toggle buried in menus.
---
Sometimes if you're under hostile attack then you spring forth like you do in/out of PA in hostile environments.
---
Sadly, the above u/ seems to have not been so lucky last night.
---
Lol, what's a jag off?
---
Also, a guy taking free stuff in a post apocalyptic wasteland seems pretty normal, having a nap while there is nothing around to bother him and so on...
---
Seems like you did a service, maybe next time you could be that prostitute that relieves him for his next journey across the harshness of the wasteland, he may come back then to.
---
Always the social menu. Forgot that the other method existed. On PC btw.
---
What secret room?
---
also lost is carpentry skills...we cannot get straight boards at all.  we can break down paint to acquire lead for crafting ammo, but cannot figure out how to paint walls.  likewise, we can extract acid from cleaning supplies to smelt minerals from ores, but cannot actually use detergent for laundry.  can craft a machine gun out of old typewriters, some sticks, duct tape and a teddy bear, but all those tractors and tanks lying about are not even available as a source of parts.  let alone getting a car up and running.
---
If you type “PQRST” Wave into google images you’ll see a visual representation of what I’m talking about.
---
Good to know.  Plans still missing?
---
Got a bit laggy when the boss shows up.
---
Well said!
---
What do you consider a proper endgame?
---
Can you wear it with the green hood?
---
Playing since 1st of January - I've seen...4.
---
3 at a distance in the forest, 1 up close in WS during a nuke.   
---
Took a few shots at the one in WS, but nothing I had at the time damaged it, so I meandered on.  It did not follow.
---
same here! tried 4 times, game crashed 4 times.
---
SBQ bad?
---
Yea, this is pretty much MMO 101.
---
Obviously it is dangerous but i feel like it's some kind of bug and if i had full health it wouldn't bother me that much if healing doesn't kick in immediately but when you're at low health this can and will kill you
---
2 for me
---
Fix buzzblade damage.
---
Wait no more legendary bots?  Thought it had just been bad luck of late there.
---
Same, 2 weeks and we only get 1 badge bug fix; disappointing but not unexpected.
---
Because using a stim counts as an action you cannot use stims when you are performing other actions like attacking, or being staggered.
---
And it's seems like there is a certain length of time before action animations finishes due to design or server connection.
---
If you stand still and not in combat the stim has no delay.
---
Huh, TIL.
---
Hmm yeah idk
---
The bone raider excavator armor was a big slap in the face to me. Here's a new power armor skin that's unique and one of a kind. Bought it immedaitely.
---
*A few weeks later...*
---
Here's a new power armor skin that's unique and one of a kind... *NOW IN RED!*
---
Like, really Bethesda? Not even a month goes by before you're offering reskins of unique power armor? I don't expect exclusivity forever, but to turn around and slap on a new color that fast? Meanwhile, the Blackbird paint seemingly everybody missed hasn't come back, and feels it seems like it was in the store for less than a day.
---
It is a complete sentence though.
---
It’s just until we figure the mechanics and layout. Gets easier as you keep doing it.
---
Nuka-Grape has you covered.
---
I've had at least 10 encounters in total during the week. In between Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog right down the middle of the map... And to be exact, the cliffs in between Huntersville, The Freak Show and the Monorail. That whole area down to vault 96 is where i encounter them the most.
---
Thanks for the info yeah I'm going around snapping pics of people's CAMPS lol
---
Yeah, almost like an MMO dungeon :)
---
Only if the explosive guy show up. Wasn’t laggy when it was just us melee guys.
---
Unless they changed something, as long as you have fully ranked starched genes you can’t lose them even in the rad shower.
---
Same here. Thunder, lightening,rain. Also tried during radstorm and no luck.
---
I am using power armor so there isn't any animation. Also i'm not attacking. Maybe i am being staggered but i feels like a bug/lag to me
---
I've thought so a few times, but often find that they're hitting me from underground.
---
True
---
Thanks for the info!
---
What about when an enemy's body lands in water? Trying to loot them while not drinking toxic/dirty water.
---
I will check tonight.  Thank you!
---
Crashed multiple times. Cache reset helps but still resulted in two crashes after. Started an event but died and encountered the infinity loading screen. 
---
This thing is bugged.
---
I really want eating, smoking, and drinking animations be a thing in this game.
---
Just maybe let us choose when to perform them like emotes that actually consumes items in GTA5
---
How about just reverse pickpocketing? I would love to put my land mines in you. No seriously it would be fun to reverse pick mutants and scorched, but being able to pick Other players would just be a grief spiral.
---
Same on ps4. Keep crashing in that place
---
Once you max out Starched Genes nothing should be able to take your mutations away, unless something was done to change that recently.
---
Thanks for the post on this, we're investigating reports of crashing on Xbox when entering Arktos Pharma or trying to start Project Paradise. Will let you know as soon as I hear any updates.

The whole reason to employ QA is to mitigate the human factor as much as possible. Whatever QMS they are applying over there needs some attention. This shouldn't be happening.
---
TBH, all paintjob should be avialable which were in Fallout 4.
---
I would rather have my 1200 5.56 rounds back then my new 1 star golf club, that's for sure.
---
Yeah, I saw 8+ gig patch and figured, "awesome, must be something big coming!"
---
Nope, minor bug fixes... oh well
---
Ive seen some theorizing that it’ll begin after E3, since thats the second week of June and it’ll allow Bethesda to discuss the roadmap as part of their presentation.
---
Thanks for your post, we're investigating reports of this occurring and will let you know as soon as we have more info to share.
---
Friendly reminder that the Early Warnings 0/5 motors crafted bug still hasn't been fixed in 188 days since release.
---
This would be PERFECT
---
Your lips to Bethesda's Ears....     
---
Shocked they didn't fix the Wood Armor Issue....

Exactly. Someone make it and let me know the stats because I was hoping this reddit thread would xD
---
I crashed like ten times after it was over with!
---
This is what I'm worried about. Wouldn't be the first time
---
What are the stats on the mask? :3
---
its been out all of 3 fucking hours and you are complaining that people dont understand how to do it yet? sorry everyone isnt a video game savant like you.
---
"Under 1GB for PC" - Currently downloading 8.64GB on mine...
---
Worked for me
---
&gt;Well I should have checked nukakrypt before heading into Bravo solo......
---
I did the same thing last night. Didn't even occur to me that it was Monday and the codes might not be solved yet, so I got all the way to the keypad console on Charlie and realized I was fucked. That's 15 minutes of my life (and a keycard) I'll never get back...
---
You can also learn the Bear Arm plan I believe, a melee weapon
---
Hitching is not an universal issue and is mostly system related. I get 0 hitches at High on my mid tier notebook. Oxhorn used to hitch a lot; he cleared his pending friend request list and the hitching went away totally; a friend of mine had hitching and a scan and repair fixed it for him.
---
Saving your comment. I want to test these as well, get some more information. I think if we compile our data we can propose a legitimate mechanism to the medics legendary effect. I have a lot of other medics weapons but not a shotgun yet, so it's good you have experience with those. I plan to experiment different weapons on vats crit heals and different builds. Currently I'm attempting a sneak pistol, but that's because I have most medics weapons in pistols. So I haven't specd any strength, so. Glad you are here!!! We can use alternate methods without having to level up to 200 just so we can swap specials. We can just compile our data. It seems youre far more ahead of the experiment than I am! I got a lot of work to do!
---
perhaps you could tell me where ARIC-4's shutdown code is for the event? oh? you havent found it yet? why not its been out 3 hours already.
---
I think a barber pole paint scheme could work for the gatling gun.
---
That'd be nice, more camp to visit \o/
---
"Line in the Sand" rewards two cores every time you complete it. I have my house not far from there, and it usually pops two or three times a night. 
---
If you're really desperate, you can farm them from the sentry bots at WS, but that's a bigger investment for lesser reward in my book.
---
Because sometime the launcher is bugged and cannot detect your game, a problem since day 1 of the launcher is a thing.
---
Don’t let one wanderer ruin your fun.  For the most part the folks that visit my camp are pretty chill , but occasionally I’ll have the guy that buys nothing, loots all my crops, takes all my water and then does the pile emote on the way out.  It happens.
---
I can't find any terminals, notes or holotapes. What am i missing?
---
Cosmetic only.
---
paper bazooka
---
I had the same thing happen, though it was super bright colors. It is now my most shown loading screen. It is like the game knew it was silly and wants to remind me as much as possible.
---
I live in Ireland. It's fairly bright and not raining.
---
We consider this a victory.
---
94 days later, the Atomic Shop has fulfilled your wish.  Limited time only.
---
Problem is Campfire tales has a timer essentially.  If someone doesn't keep the fire stoked, which burns down FAST, then everyone fails the quest.  I've actually been the one to collect ALL firewood and the quest fails because you run out of firewood before all the bugs in the three swarm version isn't completed fast enough.  So sorry OP, shoot faster, we don't have the time to wait for you to get a tag in.
---
In the fallout 76 guide it shows a winterized power armor. I think they'll release it later on. It would make sense to release it with the nuclear winter content.
---
any body know what to do with the kaleidospore flower that you can find?  i haven't been able to cook with it or use it in chemistry, yet?
---
preview it full size, screencap
---
Bah, I was hoping for something fancier than that. My second character discovered it, but it failed for her too. 
---
Now I have to decide if the desire to get those atoms will override my undesire to make a horde of new characters. (Also, TIL "undesire" is a word)
---
Thanks anyway :&gt;
---
bugged and doesnt pertain to speed demon
---
I,ve don,t care about the stuff ,but to abuse my hospitaly and leave me a bag of garbage thats no class
---
Same with fruits , vegetables, and the herbivore mutation. Plus every veg or fruit I pick gives me double. I have thousands of spoiled food in my inventory and never go hungry. Also have hundreds of inert flux for water. Win win.
---
&gt; The devs using Reddit seem like REAL PEOPLE 
---
Wait...I'm gonna stop you right there...don't overestimate Bethesda and their ability to employ human developers
---
I want the cowboy wallpaper the purveyor has in her train station
---
Must be a console thing. In play in pc. Even my 5 year old work laptop (on low settings, hey it's an Intel chip get real) I never see any studder.
---
Are you taking for drops or lag. Your post doesn't clarify.
---
If ya have issues of lag. My suggestion is to hard wire you box to the router, either via a direct cable or a POE setup ($60 Amazon). If ya need help or have questions respond back.
---
Looks like they are telling you that you work too hard as a mechanic / plumber and that you need to relax and take all your bundled up stress out golfing... &gt;.&gt;
---
Waltzed in mid-event. Lol I kept feeding venison to the collector in A. Then told Event Failed. Marched around killing random mobs and picked up a few choice legendaries, then killed by a sneaky 3* ghoul. I still don't have a clue what to do other than feed the container tasty Radstag meat lol.
---
Very nice, that might just catch on!
---
3* is 40 Scrip though! Still a win
---
I’ve read in other subs that it takes an hour of cooldown to spawn the event.
---
Oh jeesus
---
8 GB of this update are for 2 Enlighten Exterior archive files. Given that the PC has differential updates, they are replacing both archives. Very interesting.
---
Could you not simply full screen the files and save a screenshot?
---
I mean, I *have* cut down a small tree with one before.
---
It has a cool-down just like all other events. It was probably finished recently on your server. Going down the elevator is what sets it of if the cool-down is not active.
---
Good points but this really underscores the fact that a patch may be able to solve the problem for the problem. 
---
Not everyone will find arcane community solutions that are generally anecdotal and as you infer, case by case.
---
Bottom line if something as simple as "scan and repair" or "clear friends requests" fixes it a patch could make the game client periodically do these things on behalf of 100% of the players and thus fix the problem for the entire community if indeed this is the problem.
---
Most people farm google for the codes.
---
You can use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [This Plugin](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gimp-dds/) to save it in another format.
---
Is it that good?!
---
People are trippin. I can’t build more kitties but the ones I have are still in here place.
---
If I wanna make more, 5 bucks is fair.
---
1. Could be mods.
---
2. Could be the PA no power bug. ( If your core has no charge.
---
3. Could be a corrupted save on the server ( contact Bethesda directly for resolution)
---
It seems pretty broke to me.  Cant enter it solo, cant in a team, cant enter the event in either mode as well.  How did this pass basic QA?
---
Ah, so that's what the new plant is for :)
---
My first time doing it i joined and people wasnt even collecting the samples to put in the machine  , once we actually completed that , it was to protect the friendly animals which they all died because we had some people that couldn't even kill a bloodbug without emptying an entire clip into it. I had to run around jumping with my TSE gatling plasma killing everything just to try to savd the animals... and then the couple of other people afk on the second balcony by the turrets just watching us fight... everyone is just worried about looting the legendaries rather than completing the quest.
---
We test this shit my dude
---
No, it's Dandy's "boys".
---
How?   I have tried twice now and each time it crashes out.
---
I specifically placed some down in anticipation that they'd remove them from my build options and hoping they'd stay placed in my CAMP. Anybody confirm how that works?
---
May I suggest repairing the game files. It's a known issue as reported on the Bethesda forums
---
It's a small studio, I've heard that at one point they had quite a few QA people testing, but I wonder if they didn't just list all the closed beta testers under that heading :P
---
I don't think they have anything like a dedicated QA group at this point, and *certainly* don't have a quality *system* in place (I've been through about 10 of those in my career, not that any of them were worth the effort).
---
Hitching is just occasional freezes.  It's not lag, and nothing to do with internet connection.  
---
Popular youtubers like Juicehead have highlighted this in fo76 on pc
---
cause you should have your own base and use your own stuff, the only reason people should go to my base is to browse the vendors, i put an extra stash box outside for anyone to use
---
True! I started looking at bad drops as scrip fodder lately. Not everyone is on the same wavelength though. I see 3*s sell for triple digits every day at Vending Machines and I buy them all
---
I'm guessing we'll find out at E3
---
Thanks for your reports on this, I'll pass it along to the dev team for investigation.
---
Strong agree

Yh dropped a Few stims once for a lvl12 and a lvl 89 piece of shit just picked it up and ran away
---
I don't think they exist. The mods do tho.
---
Level 100 3* Grafton monster and a level 100 3* fog crawler!  Both just in the last hour :)
---
I'm on xbox. Is that even a thing that is possible?
---
This weapon is great but the ammo is quite heavy and has a bad effect when you shoot at enemies, the corpses tend to fly on the stars.
---
They do use delta updates.
---
#STOP ONE SHOTTING ANYTHING IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE AROUND  
---
ffs I shouldn't have to say this
---
I’m a level 50 on my second character and I was walking along and there was a level 5 super mutant about to start fighting a level 100 legendary, diseased, and noxious fog crawler.  I just left
---
Yeah, when I try to use VATS, it’ll highlight the enemy but I can’t swing my weapon. But it works fine if I’m using a gun.
---
Just buy a couple meat hooks from the black powder whitespring vendor and scrap those.
---
Because the new Arktos event is in an enormous area with unique tilesets, duh.
---
Do not buy
---
I love all the new features, but they really just need to do whatever they can to fix all the CORE issues with the game. 
---
Every new person I play with the conversations always revolve around what things work, what things are broken, and how to get around them. 
---
So much of the core game mechanics are still very much broken.
---
They may be a small studio but it is not a small company and this is not a small game. If they are not employing a QMS and a quality team they are horribly in the wrong.
---
People forget to jump
---
Damn,
---
 thanks my guy
---
Burrows is pointless and should be reworked into an instanced horde mode after you've completed Waste Management.
---
Stay for the party! Get a tag in and keep a low profile. Pick off the stragglers when they're weak
---
Don't you think fixing an Atom shop item made available for build without purchase might be easier than fixing a bug in the combat melee system?
---
so far every boss i’ve gotten has been a fog crawler, three times now. didnt know there are other bosses as well :o
---
Scrip bud.
---
Honesty = downvotes
---
People like that deserve a courtesy orbital beacon. :)
---
Not worth it
---
scrip
---
When I first bought it there was some weird strobe effect that went on.  My second floor was a gd lightshow
---
You need to open that "secret" room and get it from one of terminals there.
---
Still found nothing :(
---
Stimpak*
---
Well, if you're so gullible as you seem to indicate, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
They only list it for the week, with a section for the New items they listed last week
---
Thanks ill pass on it
---
I’ve always run into one somewhere in the lower regions of the savage divide, Whitesprings being the highest I’ve ever fought one.
---
You're not alone at all. While I love the new features, I'm more excited that at some point we will get a "complete" and fully functioning game with just the features that it has now.
---
IIRC, they are generally near the Star in a circle symbol on the map.  
---
However, there are (at least 2) other silos I've run across that are not marked on the map, do not appear to have any building associated with them, and are not named/do not "discover"
---
even when you dance around on the center of "cover."
---
If you are patient it can load 12 shots vs the normal 3 and Fire them all at once for a large hit. It's a nice opener I guess for a pistol build. That wind up tho...
---
I wouldn't scrip it, it's definitely useful for a pistol character. Maybe not a 'everything' weapon, but at least something fun to play with, which is also nice cuz reduced weight so you can just keep it with you and pull it out to pew.
---
THIS IS GRRRRRAFTON'S MAYOR!
---
It’s all good. People will be in there a bunch I suspect. I enjoyed it. I doubt it will meet everyone’s expectations but as a sneak / heavy weapon user depending it poses some challenges I appreciate. 
---
The whole reason I don’t really go to the burrows is it’s poorly lit and there’s no architecture that we can possibly get to and fight from. This place felt different.
---
I've encountered 4 or 5 and every single one of them were on a cliff overlooking the area below. Every single one. So I think that's an aspect to where they spawn.   
---
Back when they had the increased Mothman encounter event going on he popped up on the cliff by my old house (I believe on the iron resource spot by Big Fred's BBQ shack) twice when I'd fast travel to my camp. So I'd say just always be looking at the cliffs for those red eyes. It's def possible for Mothman to be there but you never agro him and totally miss out on him too. He doesn't always just pop up and ambush you. I always seemed to get attacked by him when I got to close to him and his cliff, lol.
---
Nice meme
---
Exactly! Not everyone knows how to do it yet. Give us a break here!
---
It's easier to fix
---
Scrip it before you even log off. Those were losing stars when players logged off then back on, and not sure if latest patch fixed it. I can attest to that firsthand.
---
Yep exactly
---
No, the numbers are the same.
---
But your whining about it will only hurt the melee users, as that will be "fixed" with a patch if your whining draws attention to the ONLY weapons in the game that have any "solo" player reward.
---
Making the guns more powerful isn't going to happen.  But making them lighter might.
---
I'm not even convinced there is a test server. Best I can tell, it's Jesus take the wheel.
---
It’s ridiculous how specific the weapon skins are...
---
That is a lot of caps for the 40 scrip, which is all that's worth.
---
First thing to say is..F76 is way too easy. Secondly, it lacks of enemies and missions. Every noob can complete the game on solo, without any hard effort so far. That needs something like, very difficult missions.....VERY DIFFICULT. Something you have to achieve after tons of effort. Right now F76 have the same problem of other games. You finish every mission, explore every place......and you have nothing better to do than grinding your gear..weapons.armors....and to do what ? To fight the same enemies over and over on same places over and over.....what's the purpose of this ? Survival mode have nothng to do with Fallout world, because it transform the game into some generic FPS..
---
Just buy it digitally you’ll wait just to get a download code no disk
---
It for formula P. Reward from the event recipe.
---
for me it depends on the server. I'll get in one where I hitch every 2 seconds, hop, and the new one is smooth. ymmv
---
&gt; I farm scorchbeasts for xp 
---
I can usually get one per crevice, any tips on spawning more?
---
Tattered Field Jacket, imo. It just flies under the radar.
---
... They were a few days ago. I had to remove items from sale to make ammo....
---
Why everyone first playthrought in Skyrim is just like that? lol
---
Don’t get excited for any dlc. 
---
Only thing that lives up the hype is player vending
---
I have all the mutations with the exception of herbivore. Jumping doesn't get me out of every situation. Sometimes there's questions only the handmade can answer.
---
How many animals were alive when you completed the event?
---
Where did you find the pass word ? All I found was a holo tape lol
---
I completely agree about it not being fun that survival challenge rewards get cut from adventure mode. Hear me out here: survival mode is where all the assholes went that couldn't see any reason to leave anyone or their camps alone, and now they get rewards for being like that, when good, reasonable, civil players get left out? LAME.
---
Seriously, take this dudes advice.
---
I have 14 of each. 😛
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
adding to....  
---
there is a perk card for that.
---
I’m fine with that, it’s because the tricentennial edition is 8$
---
Good to know it’s made it in the game now. What does it do?
---
It happened to me last night, I was like wtf just killed me
---
Thanks. I realized that later. I guess was too scared to read properly cuz I kept getting chased down. I was level 2. Made it to Overseer's camp. Started to take a nap... dead. level 116 got me. Not complaining. I guess that's the game mode. I was hoping it wouldn't just be deathmatch. When I finally made it to Flatwoods, I helped a Level 4 getting beat down by Supervisor.  I had died multiple times trying to get to Flatwoods. After helping I was expecting to get shot in the face, but I got a heart emote and we went our seperate ways. Level 116 showed up there again though...
---
I guess you can say legendaries are kinda disappointing.
---
&gt;kills the immersion
---
Does it though? I feel more immersed when other people are in the building looting and killing. Feels like there's actual scavenging for survival going on instead of every location being coincidentally untouched for 25 years.
---
I believe all three were alive.
---
I don't really like that logic
---
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeel fuck.
---
Step 1:  Find a place where ghoul-officers spawn offten
---
Step 2:  Set up camp there with a shitload of turrets  
---
Step 4: ????  
---
Step 5: PROFIT !
---
All you have to do is fasttravel back to your camp ocasionaly to pick up the goods from the splattered remains of the officers
---
also for the codebreaker badge you only need to launch it so finding the code online counts
---
I play Solo I got mine and this was before I got the camera.
---
1. athletics badge this one is pretty ez didn't take to long
---
2. Archery this one is  easier than it sounds I had a two shot crossbow that helped somewhat but got to low lvl area that spawns alot of monsters I used grafton steel mill lots of low lvl mutants bash a few with the crossbow wears it out quicker for the reapair part.
---
3. Hacker so if you go to a launch silo they all have a ton of locked terminals you will find all your 1,2, and 3 in this spot , and added tip bring some mentats that increase intell by 5 this makes hacking way easier there is a light house near the vault 76 that has house by it with a zero terminal server hop a few times ands your done your hacks launch your nuke at the end and that's your badge and that's three.
---
as far as possums badges for mods that is the real grind good luck hope you get your bag its worth the grind
---
Gotcha - yeah based on your specs I’d say that’s more likely
---
I still have not completed this mission since November. Closet i got was i collected 32 fluids while 2 other people did nothing.
---
Juicehead also recently fixed his hitching in exactly the same way as Oxhorn by cleaning his friend request list. It's because the client keeps pinging the server periodically to update the friend list. Agreed, they could do with a "block/accept/reject all requests" type of option.
---
Nah, there are just textures for them in the files.
---
None of these are really "Desperate," but I'd give my left arm for a concrete/bunker building set, some metal railings and the "Abandoned mine" warning sign.
---
Wait, so i don't actually need 8 of those single codes letters? i thought i need then even before taking solved code of off google
---
I found it and got in. Pretty disappointed because you had to find all three pages to get the code. Was hoping for something a little bit better then jack all.
---
It says it restores health to you and nearby teammates.
---
The password is 3 pieces of paper with number.  One for each lab A-B-C.     Theres absolutely nothing useful/interesting down there.
---
This seriously needs answered.
---
It’s either intended, either for some head-up-ass “because we want it that way” non-reason, or it’s because the ability to code it as such is outside their ability. Either way, we need to know.
---
I still have both the cat and deathclaw topiary in one of my characters' CAMP and I did not purchase them and I have not purchased them.
---
3 separate papers in each lab, you’ll get a six digit code when you collect all the papers :) I don’t want to give away the answer. Don’t want to spoil that part. I didn’t find a holo tape, or I thought I saw one but it kept saying use the computer
---
That's a problem I have with Fallout 76's art direction as it is. Because the assets were re-used from Fallout 4 most of the structures look like they've been decayed for 100+ years. West Virginia wasn't nuked. It wasn't bombed. There's no valid reason for the roads to look like they do. For buildings to be that ravaged.
---
Oh! Handy!
---
If you walk from directly north of the converted ammo factory to the Phillips fort, you might run into one
---
Dont worry in a week theyll be at most vendors
---
Only problem is youll start to get players joining events and just standing around waiting for others to take out the enemies.
---
FYI - Two month old thread and still can't get "Buried With Honor" to trigger.
---
Is this a pc thing? I've literally had 1 instance of being unable to join my friend's team on ps4. We've been playing together since launch.
---
My second day in the game I was reloading the camp bravo for a bobblehead and encountered one nearby. Spooked me because I had no idea it was in the game.
---
You mean Bethesda used a deceptive marketing photo to sell an item? Never heard of that before.
---
The event project paradise just started for me. Maybe i can get it to work this way.
---
Yeah that’s what I found, wasn’t sure if I was missing something. Only like 4 enemies that’s all I found
---
If you got it from the purveyor, scrip it immediately because it will lose its prefix modifier. If you got this off an enemy, keep it; it's amazing. I don't even have a pistol build and a fully charged 20 fusion cell shot can almost one-shot a grounded scorchbeast
---
You can spin up VMs on your PC and have all the MACs you want, based on resources that is.
---
In that room you can find a code to disable that AISA-4 or however it's called, and don't quote me on that because I did it only once- but if you do that your friendly animals will be healed between waves/
---
It is frustrating. I started a new toon, and ran in to the quest. no ammo, just a walking cane to swing. Others running around too, but the quest died before we could finish, and no one would accept team invites.
---
Spawn at a location near arktos and walk to it. It worked for me.
---
Hey!
---
So I had to fight a little bit with that data - had a few awkard line endings and some changing casing and like one typo. Anyway ironed that out and [here is the result!](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg)
---
Really cool to have made!
---
I'm guessing you intend to share it? If so would be great if you can link back to this post and I can add it in to my master list?
---
oh wow :/
---
&gt;i never even saw another player.
---
based on hearsay...--&gt;from the limit of 12 caps for a kill..
---
You may not see other players there anymore..
---
the PVP players are coming back to the adventure servers.
---
I paid $20 for the game.
---
Nice, gotta get that.
---
The lazy ones no. But the people making real money, yes.
---
the concrete and wooden stairs can go in the water. the other stairs cannot.

Forgive my ignorance, but how would you know they were cheating? If you could see them on the map, wouldn't they not be in the room?
---
back to back hard crashes for me
---
I'll have to give this a shot. Its been persistent forever but so have those requests.
---
Pm code
---
But that’s why it would be cool with a team of people. Not just a bunch of randoms 
---
People will have different ideas of a good time and I respect and understand yours I would just like to be able to take my time exploring something for the first time.
---
Unless they changed something in the latest update starched genes 2 will not let anything take it away.
---
How to launch a nuke:
---
1. Get to the enclave bunker and use the terminal to find a nuclear key card
---
2. Literally type in "nuke codes fallout 76" on google
---
3. Go to any silo, insert key card and type in the code you got from google
---
4. Launch nuke
---
There’s another tread saying it’s where you find ARIC-4 shutdown password.   Aric didn’t even want to interact with me. Maybe its goes with one of the events and only when its active can we found it down there.
---
I mean, there's not much they can do as community leaders. They spread the word then it's up to the devs to actually fix it
---
i made it in once... but then barney the deathclaw died and all was lost =( 
---
gone but not forgotten.
---
You're a very nice person! Pioneer Scout badge for you!
---
Same reason you could pick your name in every other Fallout.
---
He's talking about the "New Vegas Multiplayer' mod. Last I heard it's a buggy mess/heavily unbalanced. Great concept though, if it was worked on more/made a bit more balanced then it would definitely work.
---
Anyways: Bethesda did say when Fallout 76 launched last year that they were planning on 'Faction Mode' or whatever it's called. So I'd keep my eyes open if I were you.
---
Ill give it a shot
---
I'm going to look for them and make a video on how to do it. Once I figure out what is the point of it lol
---
We killed the boss that shows up after the defend phase.
---
If they only thing someone has in this game is RNG gambling, then I’ll say the problem is with them and not the game.
---
Cmon. You know it is. Weve all failed encryptid.
---
Sent!
---
I found the plans on a player vendor so they do exist.

Always wear pants. There are a lot of weirdos in the wasteland, and you ** do not** want some furry wearing a Mr. Fuzzy costume dry humping you while your in line at the vendor.
---
What does it do? And can u send it to me too?
---
Same on PC. Crashing like crazy.
---
True. I'm just commenting as somebody who doesn't have friends tho lol.
---
Shakes fists at sky!
---
No you can just look up the codes for the week they are the same for everyone and just enter it into the matching silos keypad.
---
Thank you. It's appreciated.
---
If your foundation is built under the water and the metal stairs are rising up. You can do it that way, withother stairs i dont know. I cant build right now patch messed my game up big time im scared to play right now.
---
This screams too many participation trophies
---
There's (at least) one of every type of bench in the building.  PA, tinker, armor, and weapon.
---
dont you think its more important to have a playable game than for them to be able to shekel?
---
dont you think its important not to blindly defend a company?
---
The original character build was medic's pistols (played until a little over 50 with pistols). I almost abandoned the build until I found that shotgun. You might be able to make it work with automatic pistols (especially when combined with team medic). Anything that fires quickly plus high luck for a decent crit rate might be manageable but you will always need team medic to back it up if you are not using a shotgun. One thing that I have not tested thoroughly is to see how well Medics+Explosive works together. If you target the chest with an explosive weapon (with grenadier) you can hit every body part with one shot. The question is will it trigger 1 or 5 heals?
---
no I get lots now ask me if any are over 1 star  :( 
---
your best window to run white springs is when after a nuke wears off and the clubhouse may spawn low lvl eyebots or other bots the surrounding villas will be stocked with green ghouls and more seem to be leg I have had upwards 10-15 legs drop from one of those runs plus tons of mats.  Having said that it also gets run alot so there are more farming options out there that may provide better yields
---
Devs note said it was accidental to release it
---
Dude, the event literally says "collect X", "Put them to feeder/container" and I was doing it first time too. How is that I can figure it out and do 50% more than 5 other players combined?
---
Oh I killed them all because they all attacked me lol. Fuck that noise
---
I mean, lever action is good if you upgrade it, and have the right perks
---
Same here friend
---
&gt; basic QA
---
LOL... it's BGS
---
Yeah a lot of people like to bitch and whine about stuff instead of pay attention to things like that
---
I may have gone back to play some FO4 after crashing twice while trying to enter the basement
---
Well? What is it? I GOTS TO KNOW
---
Cool, I guess your experience is the one we should all judge the difficulty on lol
---
I said *ACCIDENT OR NOT* 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
---
It interfered with all of my hats... except Party Hat :/ Dissapoint
---
Not really. Maybe for seeing other camps and visiting them. I never bought anything because people don't put good stuff in there. Mostly beginner stuff which is mostly obtainable by doing events.
---
On PC you go into the challenges menu, select one of the categories (World for example), highlight one but don't click on it, then hit T
---
Only shows up on the map screen, and it will give a little splash on the left when you complete a step.
---
perhaps you are more interested in the event and they were interested in exploring? found ARIC-4's shutdown code yet?
---
Please PM!
---
Just go in the basement through the elevator and it will start automatically. If it doesn’t it’s on a cool down timer
---
meee-ow!
---
you mean the 970930 code? As I told, I didn't get to do code parts, yet I still know the code
---
I think we already learned from the encryptid event that a disproportionate amount of randoms you find in events in this game are indeed fully illiterate
---
Drink Nukashine as early as possible. It gives you wings.
---
Go into the challenges menu, select the one you want and an option to mark comes up at the bottom of the screen
---
But there's already a perk that does that.
---
because its survival mode
---
tbh, the shantytown aesthetic of FO4 irked me more. 200yrs and no one has remembered how to sweep a floor?
---
Yes you did but the point is it was an accident and its fixed now if its still in your camp cool you got it dont buy it
---
**UPDATE** inside the room seems to be very small with one terminal so far. Engineering terminal, talks about a “Project White Mouse” anyone have any further info on this?
---
Thank you! 
---
Figured it out 👍🏻
---
I agree there should definitely be some sort of use for the level points. Got over 60 of them just chilling not doing anything. Reminding me that leveling up has no reward.
---
You could just team up with them, then atleast you still get the legendary drop
---
The black cowboy hat clips, but it does look appropriately plague doctor-ish, due to their hats. Just need a hunter’s long coat or some other coat or robe, and a weaponized shepard’s crook (stick they used to examine the infected without touching them) and boom! Plague doctor!
---
Do I just Server hop until the event pops
---
It’s in the edit
---
In the edit
---
I've been experiencing this a lot (and almost exclusively) with mole rats.
---
I will still buy it.
---
And please fix the fucking camera.  With all the challenges that hinge on having a camera you'd think having it instantly recognize what you're looking at would be a priority and yet, here I am with an album full of dead things because that's the only way they'll sit still long enough for the camera to figure itself out.
---
Check the vendor at Flatwoods, I bought the mod from there.
---
Yes, a piece of shit update, now it takes several minutes to start the game and fast travel and the arktos pharma quest froze my comp when we were almoast done as usual, so I got nothing ofc as usual.
---
Nice to know. Is this a console thing. Cause I have a huge number of people on my firends list. And don't have this issue?
---
I've had Sheep and Fog so far.
---
This looks pretty good, imo. My only suggestion is to think about what your plan is for ammo. Bandolier will probably give more bang for your buck than sturdy frame.
---
Also keep your eye out for a legendary gun with +50% VATS crits. If you get one of those you can free up three points from Better Criticals because they don't stack and the legendary effect is better than the perk.
---
You may also want to see how things are going with two levels of Action Boy and Sneak. You might find that you don't need a third rank so you can free up a couple other points. Legendary armor can also supplement those since there are corresponding effects.
---
K thx
---
I wanted to wear the black cowboy hat with the hunters longcoat, your right it looks cool as hell but the forehead of the mask pokes through the hat.
---
It's a matter of easy fix vs. more complex fix.
---
Oh I paid attention. But I guess you don't know how to read. ♡
---
If there is a small group that can kill the boss so quickly that you can’t land a hit on it, I’d like to meet them. The boss is ridiculously strong. Also, why complain? Just team up with as many people as possible and you’ll get loot from all the corpses. Lastly, the event spawns every hour so you aren’t missing out on a crazy rare event or anything
---
Ten percent?  I'm holding out till it's 40!
---
Same. I was so disappointed at how it turned out. Wasted atoms right there.
---
15 ppl show up and no one take towers other than one person who wastes stimpaks trying take two towers an constantly dying.....
---
15 ppl shooting at an invulnerable boss...smh
---
 Well thanks everyone. I picked it up off a person set up near The Whitespring. Also picked up a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher for 750 which seemed like a great deal.
---
 I'm set up for explosives quite well. ;)
---
I just don't get how people can justify buying guns priced around 40$ when dupers have an unlimited supply... In D3 RMAH, at least there was artificial rarity involved...
---
Lol :)
---
Have no idea look at the games launcher. Ithere is supposed to be a way to verify game files. Sorry not much help I'm on pc
---
They had my curiosity, but now they have my attention.
---
I really rate pharma finder. I get tonnes of chems I never plan on using, so it gets me the chems I need as I’m going and also some caps in my pocket when I’m at the vendor.
---
Check the vendors in the basement of Pleasant Valley Ski Lodge and station. Zi'n pretty sure one of them carried it. I bought the plans after patch 8.
---
TY
---
Hear me out; nice usage of Oxford commas.
---
Yeah, that’s pretty annoying. Wish it could be fixed, but I doubt it.
---
This.  They probably don't have the direct, concrete answers we want because they only know the information that is shared with them; but at the same time they repeatedly get hit with the same questions a thousand times.
---
This is... kind of really serious, assuming it’s not user error somehow. If this bug were to happen to a top trader’s main character, that could be up to $1,000+ worth of items, some irreplaceable, sniped by RNG
---
Okay. I’ll be on the lookout for a rifle like that and the armor. If I do free up those points where should they go?
---
Nice ! Thanks
---
Lol. Not even close to first.
---
And not even the first BOS lackey to post about it
---
Thanks for tip :)
---
I thought it was pretty clear since it says "Corvega Purifier- SMALL" . I read "SMALL" in title and moved on. You really clicked and bought it ?
---
That's one reason why I'm glad to have Marsupial.  If I load in somewhere and I don't see any enemies I jump up on something high.  Odds are they're probably charging at me already and I just can't see them yet.
---
Yeah as the other person said, I would assume that if the game wipes the effect then it also wipes any traces of the previous one. If it still had the information of what it used to be, it probably would still have that effect. And since it's all stored server-side there's nothing you can do about that. Wood armor is just RIP for now, but with the salvaged assaultron heads you can at least keep them around as glitched little relics for after it's fixed
---
Exactly like Burrows.  Nothing fantastic here.
---
Started Archer and athlete, split between swimmer and codebreaker tho
---
I have one. I view it as a novelty—fun for collecting but not the most effective option.
---
Thanks :)
---
I wanna be your friend that sounds fun!
---
Thanks :) I'll check Hunter out
---
Got the grafton and sheep squash
---
MY POSSUM BADGES ARE ALL GONE. ALL 8. WTF. On Xbox
---
Can I mod my Bowie knife now ? That’s all I want from this world haha
---
This is seriously just for bugs pertaining to weapons?
---
A typical math fail from Beth.  I am sure they have enough problems that math is just a side one.
---
I shall call him.....Steve
---
Hoping to see a nice skin for the Ski Sword one day...
---
Ugh, why is the Ski Sword so good? Why is it so much stronger than the Assaultron Blade?
---
They could come out with 4 Star gear, they can add level 55 and 60 gear so that all the level 50 gear is worthless in the extreme bulk it exists in.
---
Omg you're totally right. And here I thought it was my mistake!
---
And of course, they still haven't made it right! I just read your new post btw
---
Don't forget about Well Rested (sleeping in a bed for 30 seconds bonus) and be careful going into Whitesprings at your low level. Also if you have any high level friends they can spawn in high level enemies for more experience. Remember you have to get at least one hit on (most) enemies to get loot and experience.
---
Honestly, I'd rather have AFK'ers than not getting anything because everyone one-shots everything.
---
awseome thanks
---
That’s what I kind of though. I have a tse ultracite laser rifle that I pretty much main and had people interested in trading with me for it.... but I never here talking about how “amazing” a tse Flamer is lol. Thanks for your quick response:)
---
Trying to play some but ive been disconnected 3xs in 5 mins.
---
Brilliant. So do you think the number of pellets from the shotgun each count as 15 hp then?
---
Your reward for playing Adventure is not having to worry about constantly dying.
---
The survival server requires incentives and progression. Adventure already has it.
---
I'm gonna miss having that +1 armor. Seemed kinda nice for a combat helmet to actually give armor to you. No matter how small.
---
Nukashine gives you wings!
---
No cooldown that i found.
---
Are you still ranked tad pole?
---
Awesome, can’t wait to start it tonight
---
Nope. Possum since last week.
---
Idk, check out
---
Battlefield 3/4, any Call of Duty since 4, fortnite, titanfall, Apex, pubg I think, Halo and that’s just to name a few that I know off.
---
They should jsut let people in the area get the loot, the game should be able having fun not the fucking loot nazi shit that works for mmos
---
There's a visual bug where they're zero'd out. Double check it by going to a possum vending machine just to make sure.
---
The best place for me is white springs, I can get 5-10 legendaries from one server
---
As someone said.  Logging is the only way to fix this. You can however switch to a melee weapon and kill the mob with a hit.  Seems this works when your gun doesn't.  You will still have to relog to right the ship.
---
Nobody wants to be a pylon, nobody wants to gather kindling, nobody wants to kill that swarm of bugs murdering our cows once sheepsquatch shows up and now nobody wants to feed animals. Sanjay must be rolling his grave.
---
Bless you for putting so much effort into farming nuke codes! I salute you!
---
i did get an explosive instigating combat shogun with 15% faster reload - happy with that :)
---
Take a chill pill. Maybe the only green topiaries you need are the type you roll up and smoke because you’re acting like a real entitled little kid rn
---
Happens on PC too if you have a large number of *pending* friend requests.
---
I know this might set people off a bit and I feel bad for you or other people like you. First off, I really do like your appreciation for your customers and other people who are in this kind of situation. While I do like the idea and all, the sad truth is: people are gonna abuse this kind of system (if it gets implemented to the game) to make all bases get forced to not go away which would make the server lag a lot with the other players’ bases. But I know someone would say: “But what if Bethesda implemented some sort of system that would not let other players enter the server if a CAMP (A.K.A base) has a player in it and the “owner” of the camp has left the server?”, well that makes it a bigger problem. You will not be able to join your friend’s server if a guy is abusing this kind of system. I feel like a good system would be:
---
*Guy enters camp
---
*Camp’s owner has to leave
---
*Owner leaves the server
---
*The camp stays there but only for a solid 10 to 15 minutes.
---
That’s just my opinion though, would love to hear yours.
---
I was just about to post to ask what they'd broken this time lol. 
---
I'm getting blue screened like mad now, but no doubt I'm just lying and this will get down voted to oblivion.
---
\-bought a super fun tse  3 star 10 mil hand gun to blast the crap out of low lvl monsters with
---
then bought a decent  low lvl instigating rifle to lvl my alt with
---
and a 3 star gronks axe that I now can over repair( Yay)
---
its weird ill go a whole day looking at junk like at a garage sale and blam one vendor has like 3 things that I would like to buy in the same spot....  Vendors are the real rng---
---
Just add the prime receiver. More Spikes for the same amount of steel.
---
I get a lot of the same emails and I don't think people realize how successful some of these businesses are. Some of the offers were $1k+ per week or one time payments of several thousand dollars for a working dupe exploit. It certainly seems as if there is a large market for this kind of stuff if they can throw that kind of money around on advertising.
---
Take the lobby elevator down at Arktos
---
Do you have the correct perks equipped (gunsmith)? Looking under "machined guns" at a weapon workbench? Even if you don't have the materials or perks, they should be there, but grayed out.
---
This...duh
---
If you can make a Children of Atom Faction, then I'm making a VTU Faction!
---
Optimistic of you to assume there's any previous testing or a "live test server" given how we're all basically playing on their test server...hence the dev room is still around on the map
---
Graham has them, I bought them about a week ago. But it's randomized, sometimes he'll have them and sometimes he won't
---
The problem with the presoner's dilemma is that the subjects are criminals :P
---
I've run into 1 person who did that with the campfire event.  And I was the only other person there (well over level 100).  Every other event I've been to went fine.
---
If I had to guess which of all those participants was a criminal...
---
Did you buy mod plans, or did you buy the actual shotgun plans?
---
Well the pictures show the small version of the Purifier you put in the water... Yes I clicked and bought it, I haven't memorised all of the camp items names.
---
What kind of recipes were they? Were they combat shotgun mods? like scopes? receivers? etc
---
Uhhh on second thought I’ll pass on the game lol
---
I've got 2. I didn't know there was anything special about them.
---
This has happened to me 5 or so times..
---
game crashes...
---
reload game, all works.
---
once you have been in the world and the character lands (where you are first able to make any movements). 
---
After to about 5-10 seconds game crashes again.
---
wash, rinse, repeat. 
---
If in that 5-10 seconds you try...(below \* list of actions) game still crashes again in that 5-10 seconds. 
---
\*Switching character
---
\*Exit power armor
---
\*Enter power armor
---
\*Fast travel somewhere else (anywhere)
---
\*Dropping various items..
---
Remember that in this mode/issue the game is completely unplayable as it crashes and your done.
---
this has the be the the worst error ever.
---
Only thing that fixes is wait until next day while you learn new curse words!!
---
You need to equip your gun Smith perk card not sure what level you need for shotguns
---
That's a bummer. Hopefully they'll come out with more types of wooden/concrete stairs one day
---
Sounds like its a player specific issue involving the XBox cache.
---
My experience says 10%, if that.  But I understand numbers enough to know that my singular data point (or points) doesn't necessarily reflect reality.
---
Nice. Wish I got that stimpak diffuser some people are getting.
---
Sadly its just me and my girlfriend , shes level 16 haha
---
I do believe the pylons damage to the conduit stacks if you hit more than one.
---
Completely understandable and you could add a feature where you could force the camp to be removed from it and into the server you want to join. Kinda like pulling g the plug right then and there.
---
I appreciate your thoughts on this.
---
I remember getting screwed on the last one...
---
That already exists.
---
1. Lay down on bed or play an instrument.
---
2. Go after game will log you out in 30 mins
---
Now you know
---
remove it from your basket
---
Hmm.. that’s a good idea too.
---
Use a tesla.  Problem solved. =)
---
If I can find the event I will feed and protect al large things :(
---
It's reddit, not a doctoral dissertation.
---
What was on the rifle?
---
The game can’t be that bad...
---
oh yeah i did a misc.mission regarding the unruly golfers  over there the other day and a sword for another mission needed to be picked up.
---
level 60 ghouls , we beat them but took alot of ammo
---
When you go to kiddie corner and dolly sods, you have to talk to the handy at each location, and the growth requirements are under world challenges
---
They are simultaneous, and widely spaced
---
&gt;“Of course you can play this solo. Your character isn’t tied to one server, as a matter of fact you’ll never even see a server when you play,” explains Howard in the first of many quotes that have caused the confusion. “Whether you choose to explore the wasteland alone or with friends, your days will be filled with fun activities,” continues the informational Vault-Tec video....  
---
&gt;“See, even if you’re playing by yourself doing quests, you will see other players. And you can interact with them or you can ignore them, because there is a main questline. There are no NPCs. That’s one of the big differences that we really leaned on, which is every character you see is a real person, but there are still robots, and terminals and holotapes.”
---
This is the quote I was able to dig up from [https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/damien-cox/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-that-other-players-will-always-be-present-in-fallout-76/](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/damien-cox/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-that-other-players-will-always-be-present-in-fallout-76/)
---
* saying your able to play an online MMO game solo is not the same as saying you can solo all the content.  
---
* At no point anywhere in the quote is it saying EVERYTHING can be done solo, but yes the vast, vast majority of content in the game can be done solo.
---
I call this behavior out whenever I see it. Most folks don't even bother to acknowledge me when I get on mic and do so.
---
Only happens to me when I just spawn in
---
I'm not a fan of dupers, but I know I've bought some pretty awesome weapons for cheap too, not sure if they were duped but may have been
---
Yes! Sadly, most of them clip.
---
Well fuck me. There they are. How do I remove this post -_-.
---
I happy with whatever is added to the game. If. BR is next then so be it. The next content will drop shortly after anyways. As long as it’s consistent. Today is a new dungeon and the last couple of weeks ago we got ever upwards.
---
Okay, but should the quest have markers on your map?
---
Same with the new skull mask. Faschnat or whatever beret seems to work best with the skull, maybe try that.
---
Cool. I've started to post about nuke launches to get more poeple . Good to know that I can start deleting all these random from my list. Who would use POTUS-DUMP-TRUCK as a handle is being me. Or WANTED-BY-FBI.
---
Or the ever favorite. YOUR-MOMS-CALLING
---
Glad I can get rid of them
---
It should, but you don't need them
---
God dang, i cried rerading this! LOL!
---
If there was anything my character needed for wasteland survival, it was surely laminate floor finish options. Still waiting on my unicorn pelt clothing cause... LORE!
---
I can solo this event in under 5 min. Radtoads give 2-3, and flies spawn continuously. It's a bit more difficult now with the flying melee bug, but just run around and bash them, "collect all" before they hit the ground and move on to the next.
---
I ran this (and others) event 100+ times trying to get the forest camo.
---
seems like less of a problem than one guy getting the legendaries and the other three or four people being completely left out. I'd take that possible consequence if it'd mean never missing out on legendaries.
---
Because you gotta give em time to make money if you're gonna sue them for profits. Doing it right away just costs you legal fees for no gain.
---
It's strange that they haven't already teased the Nuclear Winter stuff. We'll probably get a new Inside the Vault in 2 days and we might get something.
---
Stimpak diffuser is a possible reward item in the new Arktos event
---
Whenever I try to pick up the Alien Blaster, I take a drink and grab a Burnt Book...
---
Are you on xbox?
---
not agreed. A couple of days ago i just bought 3 2\* pieces of unyielding combat armor for 3k caps each, and on each server i'm trying to check some camps to get something interesting. Naturally, interesting stuff worth lots of caps - thats why personally i sell only uncommon stuff (rare vendor's plans, uncommon outfits etc, something from events etc) and better because i really trying to get caps, not sit with vending machines full of useless stuff which noone never buys.
---
**Bug**: *pretty old by now*; aiming down the sights with a scope while also firing will zoom into the mount, not into the scope. Happens with my handmade all the time. PC, long normal/night vision scope.
---
**Bug**: *pretty old by now*; some weapons (such as Gatling gun, but my Handmades do this too) fire to the side when near world objects (such as doorways, archways, stairs). Could be a bug with some aim assisting that tries to focus fire on the wrong coordinates or wrong objects in view. There must be some aim assist as I fired a Minigun without any heavy perks and once I hit an enemy, the bullets will keep hitting that enemy, even at moderate range and with bad default gun accuracy. Another example with HM is in the Nuke silo at the destroy cores section. There is an Eyebot clipping into the floor. Aiming down the sights directly at it won't hit it but land somewhere on the camera's height.
---
**Bug**: *since several patches*; shooting from the hip at enemies misses completely at point blank range (HM, Gatling Gun). As if the gun clips through the usually melee enemies and thus does no damage. I have to switch to VATS to land a shot. Especially annoying with the Hunting rifle as a missed shot incurs a long animation. In addition, the bullet is visibly going sharply to the left or right with such close enemies.
---
I did try that but I don't match with my outfit unfourtuanlty, thanks for the input tho :)
---
Yes I saw sweet!
---
You mean like the invisible, unkillable Liberator that came at me in the Charleston train yard building?
---
If you take a rad-x, it will suppress your mutations for a while but they come back when it wears off. With Starched Genes 2, there's no way to lose your mutations at all. If you take the card off, all bets are off.
---
Yeah. I mean, we've had these things for a while. Everyone has them in their camps. Should've just left them.
---
I got hit twice.. lol Joke's on me I guess
---
What is a Stimpak diffuser?????
---
Yeah i miss the song as well
---
Yep same
---
No both on PS 
---
i must say since returning servers are full.
---
Yep.  Three times in a row.  On xbox one.
---
No wonder I can't find anyone around arktos.
---
When you gain a level you have to put a point into a special before being able to see perk cards.
---
You can put 1 pt in str and pick an int card.
---
Picking a card doesn't put the pt into that cards special. Many ppl end up with tonnes of pts in a special they didn't want not knowing how it works.
---
Damn, I'm on Xbox
---
Not gonna happen sadly. The guy who wrote “The Wanderer” decided to be a big baby and complain about how it was used or something. I think there was a court case.
---
Also fallout youtube videos that used the song (specifically MxRs intro theme) all got copyright claimed.
---
FFS, I had to uninstall to get this 8GB patch, looks like I should've just left it uninstalled.
---
Indeed. If there is an issue for an idea you could always have something to add onto it to make it easier.
---
is that how you get it? i was wondering what the hell that was, and how i was going to complete that tadpole badge.
---
In other instances, perhaps, but this was something where we were pretty sure we weren't intended to have the topiaries unlocked. Fixing an obvious mistake isn't screwing us over, we aren't entitled to forever benefit from their mistake. It's like claiming that they're screwing us over because they fixed the way the high capacity backpack plan didn't consume when you learned it.
---
Have you tried logging on today? I haven't gotten the chance to see if the latest patch fixed this issue
---
Great more high powered whitespring ghouls.
---
Yup I have 3 4 Star machetes
---
Not currently, perhaps with future content patches.
---
You mean no one can see that I named my melee character JackHawk9000? Damn dude that's a bummer.
---
We do have super mutant paint for the super sledge, but I completely agree.
---
Dion sued Zenimax over the use of the song in Fallout 4, because he didn't approve of the violence in the ads that used his song. I can't seem to find an outcome for that lawsuit, but safe to say they weren't able to secure licensing to use it for FO76.
---
If you go to a location near Arktos then walk to it - it will let you into the elevator without crashing. It’s not great but it’s more than nothing
---
He might have not intended to leave you a bag of garbage, he might have picked up your freebies and got over encumbered and realised he needed to get rid of some weight?
---
They already have your money. The game still has bugs from the beta over a year ago. They've already tried scamming buyers on three separate occasions now.
---
Take a guess how much of a shit they give. You want it, pay money. The smart thing to do would be to stop giving them money, but I don't foresee people here going that route.
---
Walking into the dungeon triggers it.  Just take the elevator down. It's The Burrows with a boss mob of 100 spread out over three floors. Nothing big.  970930 is the code for the door in the basement.  It was laggy as hell and people were dying all over and getting punted.  But soloable. Definitely.
---
With some 3*** weapons, if you add the scorched receiver it will add an extra star. I had a 4**** gun a while ago but scrapped it.
---
Drop out of workshop mode and go back in, solves it for me, annoying but always works.
---
How did you get them? Just 3* legendary?
---
Ok. I'll try that.  Thanks.
---
one day my friend one day
---
Nope, I was level 30 when I first launched a nuke and I just looked online for a decoder and when other people find the code then anyone can use the same code.
---
Maybe
---
I hate this bug. Sometimes only happens on one side of the connection, so then you have to start from the other side. Jump for joy instead of powering that device!
---
Oh, fuck....
---
It's very easy dungeon to finish. Even solo.
---
Nothing is capped at two stars, you can find 3* assaultron heads out in the wild. Their prefix disappearing is just some crazy freak accident, but it does consistently happen and only from the purveyor
---
Interesting
---
I still cant believe there are people who are selling caps for real money. And the items, or they sell them for 20-30k caps. Its stupid.
---
There is only a single "Combat Shotgun" recipe, but a number of mod plans, as others have asked - are you sure you have the plan for Combat Shotgun first and didn't just buy the mod plans?
---
All I could do was stare at my TV in shock lol
---
There ya go
---
Yeah but Bethesda wont. Theyd rather have players miss out than reward players that put in no work. Im with you, itd be nice but this seems to be the status quo with any online games. Dedicated players miss out because there has to be restrictions in place to stop exploiters.
---
You can get them 3 star then add the sacrificial mod to it and it will become 4 stars and cause bleed dmg
---
Not really Im just feel with the back and forth they could have just left it. 
---
With the amount of things they have let go on it could have just been a good will gesture.
---
It's not like you would enjoy some one taking something out of your hand when you are using it?
---
Only can get 4 star
---
Event requires alot of the server I'd be surprised if a full 4 team could do much
---
Has the bear claw weapon been added yet?
---
Ahh I see
---
cause they are more so designed to go with foundations. so if you have a foundation on water, the stairs naturally should go with it.
---
the metal stairs are designed to connect from foundation up to make a second floor. they dont want a person to put stuff under water cause you cant remove it.
---
i know cause i figured out how to out foundation under water.
---
ooh can you post pics?
---
So if you want a go at actually cracking the code, [HERE'S](https://i.imgur.com/08DB7bD.jpg) how you'd go about decrypting it. The keyword is just an example from awhile ago, but you'd have to figure out the codeword for the specific silo at the enclave, and you can use the terminals in that room as well to start quests that will send you officers to collect all 8 code letters, then use the keyword to decode the letters, and then you need to figure out what that is an 8 letter anagram for.
---
Which is kind of bananas. It's much easier later in the week when the codeword is obvious, but just save yourself the time and effort of tracking down officers and creating an excel spreadsheet and just go to nukacrypt.
---
If you rejoin and your team isn't working just leave the team and get another invite
---
I'd play it by ear and decide based on how the build plays. A few more ranks in Adrenaline certainly can't hurt (I don't really agree with the other guy that you shouldn't put more than one in it). Blocker is good if you find yourself getting swarmed by ghouls or muties. Batteries Included if you want to carry fusion cores or gauss ammo. Fireproof if you want to negate explosions and scorchbeast sonic attacks. Traveling Pharmacy if you have a chem hoarding problem like me.
---
Can you enlighten us?
---
you mean like the new event ,the biggest point of this update? [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brd44f/the\_best\_project\_paradise/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brd44f/the_best_project_paradise/)
---
No problem bud, always happy to share a good deal
---
There's all kinds of OP lvl 50 gear. I'm not sure how much more powerful they can make weapons and armor before the crys for nerfs get worst.
---
But yes this would help.
---
He doesn’t sell them
---
So the first dungeon was too easy and this one is too hard?
---
Good point. And at 25% chance per roll, it’s entirely possible to do 100 campfires and receive zero badges.  Though highly improbable.
---
I’m not a fan of BR at all, but some people are.  If this is there none, let em have it.  Big B has released a steady flow of content recently all for the initial price of the game.  I feel more than content with what the roadmap has illustrated.
---
That I indeed did. An expensive lesson.
---
There are bugs that remain unfixed in their singleplayer games, did you really think they'd care about this one either lol
---
i got fog crawler
---
I can send you the pics but it's in italian, i can translate them faster than the pic loads lol, i can send you a PM but...it's spoilers dude...are you sure ?
---
I've been enjoying getting level 50 items from my level 7 mule, guess I'll need to level it when that patch rolls around
---
Vats are for range builds.  I don’t need to vats.  Queen and minions go down very quick.  Stop bitching
---
My hope is the entire map becomes 50+ content. Harder enemies and better rewards (4-5 stars).
---
the halway to the left of ARIC-4 the password is 970930 If you shut her dpwn the mr handy takes controll for the remainder of the event I dont know if it changes anything besides him as the announcer because I lost when I did it
---
A Really good app to use is Wunderlist.  You can make a list and then when you've completed something on it you just click on the box next to it and it disappears from the list.  I took the time and put them all in so I know what I have left to get.  It's a shareable app, which means if you make a list, you can share it with someone else.  For example, I use it for groceries and share the grocery list with my boyfriend so if he stops at the store he can see what I've put on it, then he can mark it off the list.  For this though, you wouldn't want people marking it off the list on you.  But it's a great app just to use on your own!
---
I'm more interested in the "legendary" characters new feature - I was trying to find the inside the vault that spoke to it, but it was something along the lines of once you hit 50 you can reset to level 1 with a bonus.  Depending on how that works I'm very interested in that.  I think constantly cycling from 50 to 1 could have some interesting effects on the game.
---
I’m in the same boat and have been looking for either the mods/plans/individual meat hooks to scrap and can’t find anything in the game. I’ve tried everything the people below suggest and nothing is there. Nothing at flatwoods, nothing in whitesprings and nothing at any of the train station vendors nor harpers ferry
---

---
[https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76)
---
Many people who never played fallout started with fallout 76. Makes sense
---
I ran into bootyslayer one time, he got killed by a mole rat in Flatwoods
---
Its not hard its reliant on every high lvl person on the server joining in pretty much
---
Isn't there already a Droid at Hemlock Holes that is a cook and has you find meat for him? You could use him as the source of that DLC quest.
---
I’ve tried server hoping that vendor and nothing
---
How do you scrap a legendary weapon?
---
Beth can't math. Shows why they can't code either.
---
Wouldn't hold your breath for anything great with Nuclear Winter. If it's what the rumors are saying it is... ugh. I was thinking it'd be a hardcore pve survival mode like FROST mod from Fallout 4. Looks like not.
---
Tried that and neither one have shit
---
The imposter event tells you exactly what to do, and people still can't do it properly lol. A lot of gamers seem to need their hands held constantly, but whatever.
---
yes! that's what I bought it for.
---
Well you can put these perk point into something else if you want to
---
And yet here we are.... or.... here you are rather.... requested new things 🤦‍♂️
---
I think many of us would appreciate if you just made a comment on this thread with spoiler text detailing some of it. I'm just curious to see what it's like
---
I can easily solo, too easy
---
I guess you could say it's infinitely hard for those of us who can't fucking get into it without the game crashing, so yes, it's too hard.
---
Why were you trying to trade in survival?
---
It's sort of dumb, whole point of flamer is AoE damage, explosive makes it a ballistic weapon similar to the. 50 cal
---
Are you on?
---
Weapon mod plans? Can’t get on till late tonight so haven’t done the event but new weapon mods sounds interesting, what’s been dropped so far?
---
probably some more "secret" stuff they didn't want to mention yet....though they've kinda forgotten about that telling us the patch would be "less than a GB on PC" doesn't hide the additional GBs that actually got added...I'm not sure if this time it was just stupidty on their side or they just attempted to hide something again
---
I try to be courteous to other players, and often play on a team, where we go out of our way to make sure everyone gets their hits in, but all too often I will have someone run in the clubhouse after I spawn enemies &amp; try to one shot everything.
---
My main character is a level 225, and I can easily One Shot most enemies in the game, but when I encounter someone doing that, I will give them a lesson in how to quickly kill everything.
---
The best way to make sure everyone gets to participate at the WS Golf Club is to kite all the Ghouls out to the Parking lot first, then everyone can shoot them with their 10mm pistols, and let the Whiffle bat guys finish them off.
---
They already received the handout and Bethesda are now being indian givers.
---
Wait so is this going to be in the shop for only 20 hours? Darn
---
You have an account?
---
Than* not then
---
You can get the plan for the bear fist and it's mod plans
---
 it seems if you stay on the server for about 10-15 minutes before entering it sometimes gets you in down to the lab, you just have to hope the event isnt in progress or finished. or try walking in from other areas to give arktos a longer chance to load in. but if you survive the elevator hard crash you may still encounter freezing once inside. for me its usually when i use a stimpack the animation freezes my game.
---
Pretty decent
---
I think there were leaks for a fridge which might help
---
I like how its tagged as “HELP”
---
I'll get on if you wanna make that trade.
---
Wow.. man.. Ya I get your pain.. BUT wow. that's kinda mean.. Even if you want to say this... dig down inside and pull out some professionalism. Your message will certainly be more listened to.
---
If you want to trade for one, just wait until they're reintroduced and prices fall. People are charging exorbitant amounts right now. Not sure if it's intentional, but traders are VERY keen on ignoring the fact that patch 5 notes said explosive energy weapons are only **TEMPORARILY** being removed from the pool until they are adjusted
---
Yeah! I use Wonderlist for my groceries as well. Best list app for those kinds of things. But I didn't know you could share them like that! Gonna be super useful once my fiance and I are married. I'll have her download it. Especially since we have a list for movies to watch as well, so she could add to it. For me personally, I like seeing what I've done already with video games so I like just having the check mark.
---
Wouldn't the baddies scale up if everyone showed up though? So if they don't help, we may not kill the thing. Like when the sbq gets away. I could be mistaken though
---
Exactly my thought. I was really surprised that I could build them, but I just thought it was a nice gesture from Bethesda... That deathclaw is staying on my roof, damnit! :D
---
And nobody ever defends area C. Like ever.
---
What's wrong with melee?
---
The sacrifice mod an Scorched receiver doesn't add a new star to the weapons since patch 9.
---
wat
---
my camp is in the savage divide (overlooking cranberry bog), and they occasionally spawn at my camp.  met one by charlestown rr station too.

You can try doing the queen of the hunt daily
---
That happens sometimes anyhow. Not very often, but there are those who stand around to get the event rewards. Plus they're missing out on xp as well.
---
Also, please don't shoot the friendly creatures. People in my event essentially killed them and we failed the event super quick
---
I personally didn't see much in there to get, for myself I just ran around a few minutes then the game pretty much puts you in a line to get a few items in a row, then pops you out. 
---
Plus right around the vault is some good locations to get a lot more things.
---
Unless, you know, you *like* that sort of thing. Then all bets are off, I guess.
---
Follow the Mr. Handys, grab what is on the tables around them and listen to what the Overseer says. Also balloons.
---
There are some supplies and perk cards to pick up on your way out, but there's not much else to explore or pickup inside the Vault. Follow the signs and arrows, it's pretty obvious what you're supposed to pick up. Enjoy your time in the wasteland!
---
&gt;Bodies, usually legendary ones keep vanishing upon death.
---
BIG one.. PLEASE FIX guys.. :)
---
Yes thanks for your help.
---
Maybe the common issue require more investigation?
---
Does your map tell me where to find Deathclaw hide?
---
Ok, well I powered through your post regardless. It’d be great to have more CAMP budget/lights to create with. 
---
I guess that’s it. I agree, the more the better, but not if it causes server instability. 
---
And just FYI... paragraphs are just easier for everyone. You’ll get more replies. Walls of text aren’t very inviting. 
---
I’ll admit I was a bit snappy. My apologies.
---
Ooo cool, thanks for letting me know, fingers crossed for later 🤞
---
I've managed to almost solo the ISS while holding all three pylons, I say almost because even though I did most of the damage the handful of others at least hit it a few times. Let's see how bad this event can get...
---
it makes the animals fight back
---
Hell yeah. IGN is Roe21
---
How dare you
---
My buddy has made this gripe a few times and I think all his stuff is Bloodied.
---
Sorry no, this is just for location related challenges. Like take a photo at someplace or sign in or explore, etc.
---
Ah thanks.. done all those, only have the bugged and ‘impossible’ left.. :)
---
In my experience this minimizes/reduces hitching but it does not completely remove it.
---
I've got five dollars. But they're prewar dollars.
---
put the code it, shut down aricas terminal. Quentin or whatever his name is will use HIS serum and it will make the animals fight back. so the higher level animals you have,(already seen a deathclaw) the better your odds at winning
---
Campfire tales' success directly depends on how fast the boss is killed, so no. 
---
And no, you weren't cheated out a legendary drop because you're too slow.
---
Had a run in with the beach boys last night. It didn't end well for them lol.
---
sure but does this mean they shouldn't try to fix it?
---
Hahaha, love it. 🤣
---
Ah I see. I only accept the finest caps
---
Leave it up. I'd have probably panicked when I noticed, too, but now that I've read this post I'm in the know.
---
Queen battles on scorched gulpers, got them all from there.
---
Put all the venison in that one feeder. Then it spawns a hulked up creature to defend like a deathclaw or yaogao, let the other 2 die.
---
Then have one guy look after the big creature and the other solos the sheepquatch. We did the event a few times. Got formula b whatever that is plan, and plans for the bear arm, couple of arktos coats. The fail comes because no one good stays behind to watch the creature, they all go for the boss. Server hopping works, no cost like encrypted, easy enough to start.
---
Aggressive introverts are the worst
---
As for the actual weapon, I don't have one but I believe it would be fairly disappointing. It shoots bullets instead of fire, but the flamer still has very low range so the bullets will deal minimal damage at range. And since it's explosive, you want to be at range. Damage isn't that great since explosive can only now provide you +32% base damage with max rank demolitions expert
---
Cool thanks will keep an eye out!
---
I agree with him on the legendary vendor. There's definitely a thing where servers are "seeded" with particular legendary items but I've noticed it more with the effects than the type of weapon or armor. I think I'm gonna do what he mentioned there and save up until I get a server dropping good effects and then head over to the vendor for a shopping spree.
---
Commie bastard got what was coming to him.
---
Now the Turret Farms are gone I couldn't give a tinkers's fart where anyone builds a camp in fact its kinda nice to stop at ones out side white spring grab a water and chill play on someones piano all good man
---
Need help grinding for some atoms?
---
It's not supposed to. Supposed to become free once you leave server and if you rejoin you're supposed to have to retake it.
---
At least that's my experience.
---
Took one and crashed. Loaded into the same world (joined a friend who was there) and the workshop was free.
---
&gt;beta over a year ago.  
---
Lol okay.
---
Game theory is fucking awful concept as a foundation for society. Unfortunately, it’s one of the cornerstones of capitalism.
---
Most of the rando's are probably 10 yr old kids who have very little reading comprehension. lol
---
I still fail encryptid  2/3's of the time because no one will activate the damn pylons.
---
I think there’s a bug in the workbenches. I kept on getting stuck in a submenu and had to leave the bench. Will post details later today but it’s super easy to spot...
---
Yeah that’s what I thought.. so imagine my surprise!
---
...why didn't you mute them?
---
Take a nap on the bed before you leave as you get a small xp boost for getting well rested. Other than that there really nothing in the vault bu try explore at your pace. One thing I'll say is if you can learn about putting together builds if you wanna play seriously as a good build makes a huge difference in difficulty.
---
SPOILERS since many asked
---
There's a quest named "Reach the Overseer rank" so i think it's gonna be something related to Vault 51, since it's overseer is dead. And many are named "nuclear winter boss type 1-2-3-4-5" and so on. Also there are some mods i've never heard of, or plans. Like for the wall mounted heads or for some CAMP decorations. But i think some of them are just things left in the files that didn't get in the full release...I'll update if i find more.
---
Yeah if you could translate it would be great to see what’s ahead
---
Wheres the gallarhorn when you need it lol.
---
There is!?
---
because then he wouldn't be able to bitch on the internet...duh.
---
Make sure you grab the pipfall game holotape. Inside vault 76 is the only place you can get it, as far as I know. It's really the only unique thing.
---
XD
---
The only thing i did was take a lot of photos because i thought it was the last time id ever see the insides of a vault! LOL
---
Do you plan on fixing it by keeping them in the game or "fixing" them by removing them from the loot table. I know I'm in the minority, but I play a stealth sniper and would love 3* wood armor.
---
When is the excavator carry weight glitch going to be fixed? It's been in the game for at least as long as I've had the PA and half the time doesnt apply the additional 100% carry weight bonus.
---
Ah. Well, awesome... :( 
---
Thank you for letting me know, though! I am but a humble n00b to Reddit :P

I started WS runs at L27 (w/ a vampire machete).  Tough, but doable.

This will take you through lots of mutants, and will yield lots of XP (and other things):
---
start @ grafton steel.  grafton dam, penetentary, WV lumber, S to nuka plant, ENE to to wade airport. SE to the the teapot, SE to the Mining HQ at Charleston, then ENE to riverside manor to pick up the mysteries quest.  Go around the back of Riverside, then head SE over the mountain toward the SE side of the ash heap and pick up the excavator quest.  From there, go north to WS or the Mine to complete a couple of quest objectves.
---
Yeah, but don’t they make your character look bald?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

---
Excellent write-up, appreciate your work for the community.
---
Thanks for the information
---
thanks for the confirmation 👍
---
Yeah well I was jumping vendors to find plasma grenade plan and failed, now I'll have to do it for this plan...
---
Three weeks ago I got an email to confirm my address for shipping
---
I like it, but, meh.
---
That's a fair compromise imo, let the people who already built them keep them, but they can't build anymore. We already knew they weren't supposed to be free, so I don't know why people are so upset over this.
---
Do NOT join a team from the main menu. It bugs out.
---
One player join a world. Have the second join that player. Then invite to team.
---
From the menu you can do it... But for me it only shows as a team to the second player. The leader shows nothing. Kick from the team then reinvite sometimes helps.
---
You are absolutely 100% full tilt wrong. The game was designed to have pvp in it and advertised heavily that pvp was a part of the game. Pvp can easily be avoided by not taking workshops, pretty simple.
---
What i sad is claiming a workshop makes you agree to pvp, whether people wanted pvp is meaningless if they agree to it by clicking yes in the pop up
---
all of the level 45 gear could use a 55 variant.
---
Finally, people on a gaming forming that understand probability.
---
Some wisdom in unexpected places over here.

---
Something needs to be done about it, like ghouls not spawning until the person who launched the nuke is within range to hit them. Too many fucking times have I launched a nuke just for some leeches to have already killed everything.
---
I would guess scrapped into scrip?
---
I mean. I get being upset but there's a very easy mute button attached to every player node.
---
If you press the option to select it will place the wire. For example, the option the select would be the ‘X’ button.
---
I don't think it was the nuke, I had server drops and got an offline message. Went to Google and a lot of people were reporting the same.
---
What rewards did you get?I’m interested what you get for saving all three.
---
Add ashtrays and empty bottles. I want those darn cigarettes for the cloth but I have to pick up the stupid ashtray first. Then, wait, is it a Nuka Cola or a Nuka Cola bottle? F, picked up the wrong one.
---
This is just such a clueless post. You are really out of touch with how things work online.
---
Similar things have happened to me too. Usually when I ignore team or trade invites. A few seconds later I'll get a pm declaring me a bitch or a whore lol.
---
You’re a joke.  FYI.
---
I had 3 people guarding the yao guai, self included and we just got bombarded by an assaultron and 10 cave crickets. I don't think anything other than more manpower would have helped. 
---
If there were at least 3 or 4 on each animal it would be easily doable. But I don't even notice the event unless I'm checking the map. I think all events that require multiple people should be a server wide notification.
---
How do you start the event?
---
I do the same damn thing! Named my sniper Vasily after Vasily Zaytsev (ever see Enemy at the Gates?) and my beta melee character Big Barda. 
---
My current guy is Doggert T. Washington. My plan was to dress him like Gen. Patton and only use a baton or cane but that idea quickly became stupid to me. He kinda just looks like a raider version of old man Crossbones now haha
---
Free states all the way. Self determination.
---
Just another piece of crap hiding behind a keyboard, and talks smack online cause if he did it in person he'd get his ass whooped.
---
The area itself is mostly just for the event, not much to do otherwise.  That having been said, I have tried to solo it and it's Hard.
---
I know I just read the unpopular opinion of someone who thinks they're entitled to everything when game devs make mistakes.

Thanks for your report about this, and apologies that this affected you twice. We'll address this with a future update.

I did and I got in. I don't want to jinx anything but it's working fine now.

It's always intresting how Bethesda approaches bugs. If it benefits the player hotfix it, if it hinders the player it can wait.

This was a problem before today. I know because I haven't played today and I encountered it. I think it was sunday?

There are over 300 options coming up when I type that in and I keep missing you (unless you left off a 2). Could you just add me? Jay_31_ That's Jay(underscore)31(underscore)

It's working on my Ultracite GL. PC

yes previous missing peices I knew had a possibility of me accidently deleting the random peice. no way I accidently deleted almost my entire suit.
---
You have take the elevator.In the lobby area there's a terminal under the glass floor and you have to initiate it by yourself like in the uranium fever event.
---
I really don't care who does what at my camp. Just don't go wrecking everything
---
Probably like the chemical the animals you gotta defend have in their system.  The AI during the event said that anything around animals afflicted by Formula P wanna kill whatever is afflicted.
---
Same.
---
Which Syringer challenge? I got the one for killing a Yao Guai with a stringer.
---
you need to chill and grow up
---
Ngl this is the best bug report I've seen atm.
---
Where does the event notification show up when you're playing?
---
I've never done this event because it didn't trigger when I first completed the quest and I've never seen it active over many hours of play time.
---
And it is never quite the things you hope for. 
---
I've been patient with the game as any of us Beta players have been... its bonkers I still hit like 20 percent of my melee attacks. My camp takes a full 2 minutes to load in after my game, also takes a full minute to be able to fast travel.
---
That being said I love this game more than any I have ever played. It's the perfect combination of choice and grind to me. 
---
I could tinker around or better myself today. Kinda like real life. It's a good balance.
---
General statement:  class freak helps a ton.  If you don't believe me, try having 7 mutations and going around without class freak for a week.  Then try class freak 3 for a day.    Different game.   As for the thirst / hunger, class freak seems to work on it sometimes and not others.  I'm not sure what triggers it to start working.  I have had days where my thirst and hunger were relatively normal.  Other times not.   There may be some combination at play.

Either way, Class freak helps a ton and stuff to drink and eat are ridiculously easy to come by.   The "hard part" is picking up 100 water from a stream, pond, puddle, etc....  I mean that takes a whole 30 seconds... it is so terrible.  Then boiling it down to 50 boiled waters takes a whole other 30 seconds... and then there is the 20 second load time to my camp... I mean making an entire day's worth of drinks in about 2 or 3 minutes is just so darn difficult, even with speed demon.
---
I wear it under my combat helmet and it looks pretty good
---
Sorry I forgot to add, Pink circles are for playing instruments
---
When I accidentally do this I give the legendary to the lowest level that I'm with
---
Yes into scrip
---
I think often, so far 4 ppl have mentioned it here
---
Says the boomer venting his rage on the internet, gotcha bud :\^)
---
Yup ive started using the machete since yesterday , will  give this  a bash tonight
---
I've had 2 of the 3 I've killed disappear as they die. No corpse, no pile, nothing for anyone involved.
---
And you'd get an assault charge :\^)
---
Yeah I buy the skull mask too and wear it with the Faschnacht barret. Or the alu hat. The rest looks horrible
---
LOL. I think people are downvoting you now, just to be funny. 
---
There are always more blue screens right after a patch. We'll probably get a hotfix by Thursday.
---
You scrap them at the legendary vending machines for legendary scrip. They're at train stations. You can then use the scrip at the legendary vendor
---
Very helpful! Thanks for taking the time to do this, appreciated!!
---
So.... There's no firm proof of this yet, but there's been pretty significant evidence that known duped items or items that were obtained through glitch exploits were what "disappeared".
---
Yeah i have it to
---
Alright, I hear what you're saying. I think we can come to an agreeable compromise.
---
Shit doesn't get fixed promptly if ever unless it is tied to the ATOM shop. We can insure it's fixed by players buying a building permit from the ATOM shop.
---
This will obviously be bugged during the initial rollout, but it'll be up and working in about 5 quarters or so.
---
...What system are you on?
---
3 star alpha sheepsquatch= 1 star stalkers board. i beat the game!!
---
Is this shit out now
---
lol yeah the update will be to the picture like last time, not giving the player the skin they thought they were getting.
---
Damn, taken down in less than 10 minutes. Record time
---
# ABSOLUTELY NOT. STOP TRYING TO RUIN EVENTS WHERE SUCCESS IS DETERMINED BY HOW FAST THE BOSS IS KILLED JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE UPSET YOU MAY NOT GET A SHITTY ONE STAR  LEGENDARY, YOU GREEDY SELF-CENTERED NEWBIES.
---
Yeah it happens to me too, it's really frustrating.
---
That and objects "floating" or "intersecting" when the object is green on my end. I love building C.A.M.P.s, only when it's not cumbersome as shit haha.
---
Oh noes. I didn't think of that. PS4.
---
Hey! C is my favourite!
---
PC here. Fuck.
---
That's the thing... the refrigerator is in the house.   If for some stupid reason I had to have to refrigerator outside, the f-ing thing would be locked.  Anyone that was visiting my house when I wasn't there would be S.O.L. and/or could bring something with them.  Then again, why are they at my house when I'm not there?
---
Just because it is outside, doesn't make it "yours".
---
Also, coming back from the tangent there:  any people I consider friends know that I have the social graces of an alpaca, but they also know that I have absolutely no problem sharing, so they ask or they just go get something out of the refrigerator.  So, no, I don't "offer them the hose"...I don't offer them jack squat most of the time and they are perfectly happy getting what ever they want themselves and they know where it is if they want more.   
---
So, I can just go to your house and if I see something outside I can just help myself to it?   Sweet. Where do you live?
---
[yes](https://bethesda.net/en/article/QZSsPQ9Mus9sRWZwcsdcH/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-5-notes-may-21-2019?attunement_sso=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Imp3dCIsImtpZCI6InBweUJSV3pMRVpTTGVRRHdZNmVBOVBLU2pIWlc5UXRxRFBHejdocGUwWGxZYTNWbXdmaE42ckR3azFvUFJmYzUifQ.eyJidWlkIjoiZWY4NWEyZmYtMjMzZi00ODAzLTlmYmYtOWVhODQxZGQzNWM0IiwiYm5ldF9zZXNzaW9uIjoiXCIyfDE6MHwxMDoxNTU3Mjk2Nzg0fDEyOmJuZXQtc2Vzc2lvbnw0NDpaV016TW1WbFpHUm1aV1ZsTkdSaVlXSXpPR1k1TkdGbE5qQmpPRGhrTlRFPXwxMjU1MTUzNzQ4YmY3YjMxMWFjNWQyOGYyNzczY2QyOGM2OWQyN2YyOTc4OGM2ZjBjMTUwYzZmN2Q0NGVkODJlXCIiLCJleHAiOjE1NTg0NjkxMzksImlhdCI6MTU1ODQ2OTA3OX0.tOSTx2Yx-IYHbwxV9uESYe8s-7kjRykI_IxQC6KK12rEYLSWPLhurxL8DJYlKK04mu36E-mMbnbJ0nQjSmyePgMHDuJ0vnOIht-g41asMGD_qUVidJi-Oy63J-JEYn_2AndBzIJGVNx-hXSsaNBc7rqpV-A4Fw18rru-aYpt5169PCViBywCdJ_UU8QT31N1yq7BLNrUz08AsZbr25KJDijXYYRxWGEb_Kxd3QDcMwfY5JG55BEvYc3R9n-6I_bTAEOrAjh8niM5QiENsdizTnZ6QRLPs99jZ3Q1GnyZeuidY-RDpULx5xnF-feVAkhXRMdoBEdlksD8QdPU196jAQ)
---
Nice nigga I got something worth logging in for now
---
Aside from the boss one-shotting the animal you're trying to protect, I think it's possible to solo.
---
I did the event twice with two wildly different results.
---
First run was in section C where you have to collect sludge.  (bring radaway)  End fight was a lvl 68 friendly ghoul vs a lvl 100 Grafton Monster.  I was doing fine protecting it from rats and bugs, then the Alpha shows up and crushes the ghoul in one hit.  Event failed.  It was me and one other guy in our section.  Still got a \*\*\* ski sword, which is at least worth 40 scrip.
---
Second run I tried a different spot.  This time it's collecting venison in section B.  Much easier.  Now I have to protect a friendly lvl 91 deathclaw from a lvl 100 sheepsquatch.  The deathclaw was at least doing ok vs the bugs, wolves and bears.  Eventually a half dozen players involved.  Luckily you can pick up venison off the radstags other people have killed, because I think maybe two other participants were actually trying to fill up the machine instead of mindlessly killing everything they could.  By this point I knew that keeping the friendly critter alive was top priority, so I put a 35 round clip into the sheepsquatch and just guarded Fido as it ran all over the facility.  Everyone else is just going HAM on the squatch and I'm wandering around with Fido by myself.  Event success.  \*\*\* executioners/explosive/reload lever gun and an Arktos Lab Coat.
---
Some of the friendly creatures vs a strong AF alpha just don't work.  A bloodbug has 0% chance to soak up one hit from a sheepsquatch, and 4-5 regular glowing ants are going to tear it apart in seconds.  You have to grab and hold all aggro for the creature to have a snowflake's chance in hell of surviving.
---
I'm already thinking that a tesla-coiled power armor build with the ability to swap in a lot of defensive perks is really going to be a good character for this event.  Grab as much mob aggro as possible and tank while the rest of the participants kill the alpha.
---
Clean new looking Gatling gun please. Black and chrome pump shotgun. No not a chrome stock with black barrel. A chrome barrel with a black stock ffs.
---
Yeah, I have like maybe 120 rn PS4
---
&gt;Most folks don't even bother to acknowledge me when I get on mic and do so.
---
That's right. We don't.
---
I just got the plan as a drop from the SBQ aswell
---
funny thing was he didnt go for mine had I been a bit more industrious and a bit more of a Jerk I could have sat underneath and collected victims lunch sacks but really not my grove.  No im pretty sure his main motivation was purely flinging people over the edge  to there doom.
---
Ah interesting
---
I'm 40 years old, been there and done that. The last thing I would do is let some piece of shit disrespect my daughter, and hide online. After 2 deployments to the middle east and getting into gaming while there, I learned that people love to talk crap and hide behind the anonymity that is the internet cause they feel like the big person who they cant be in real life
---
Have fun!I enjoyed it so far I think you will enjoy it too :) .
---
Please have this preserved pie and a beer. I can hear your sighs all the way to Canada. I'm Sorry.
---
You mean YAW2C2D has been discovered?  Man these easter eggs never end.  (Yet Another Way to Crash to Desktop)
---
I am already excited for the next patch so my Gatling gun might be able to kill an enemy again instead of taking it down to 99%
---
I dunno, that level 100 3 star Fog Crawler took some putting down.
---
I don't think it's pointing to a battle royale. That would completely alienate anyone who wants to play the game without PvP (or just wanna do it on their own). JuiceHead had that idea in a video and admitted it was pure speculation because that's what it is.
---
There would either need to be a way to bypass it completely or not have it at all.
---
Could there be a sort of deathmatch or free for all coming? Maybe. Even probably. Versus Vault raids would be sweet as long as we don't lose caps upon death in them.
---
Overall, I wanna see life just after the bombs, maybe a few years later. I want rads galore. I want a harsh environment. I want literal fallout where I HAVE to have a hasmat suit. I want the area just around Vault 76 and maybe a little farther out to be the only places that are lower-level. Gotta have a safe spot for folks who wanna start a new character.
---
Outside of that area, I'd like to see everything high level. Gangrenous Feral Ghouls at that White Powder place near Top of the World, please.
---
I found one down the map a little from yellow sandy's still
---
psa the pip boy display is wrong, check at a vending machine
---
Hm i'm using a gatling gun as well but i don't know this problem?
---
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I've wasted your time. On the bright side, you're not so poor. I'll keep an eye on the trade boards for any pc shotguns and message you if I see a deal. I'm a pretty active trader and I tend to look at all systems just to see what's going on everywhere. Again, man, I'm really sorry.
---
8.48gb. im pissed because i have slow internet. i would have downloaded it at work and copied it over, but the notes said 1gb and thats not that bad, so i didnt bother.
---
i kept my schedule clear for tonight and i still have 3 hours of download to go, which means it finishes at 1am - 2am in my time zone. so now im browsing reddit on 14400 modem speeds.
---
If the issue is consistency, they've been pretty consistent in how they treat bugs that aren't supposed to be in the game regardless of how beneficial or minute they are compared to other bugs. Feed the People was a minor bug that people liked, but it was still a bug, so they fixed it. I don't necessarily agree with that strategy of bug fixing, but I can understand why they'd do it like that.   
---
The topiaries are a little more complicated because they're atom shop content, they're losing potential revenue (little as it may be) by allowing them to be free when they aren't intended to. If they allowed us to just have them for free, that sets a potentially problematic precedent for them where were it to happen again, but with something like a Power Armor skin, they'd either break precedent and likely piss people off even more than they are now, or follow precedent and lose even more revenue. At least, that's my thought process as to why this was probably the best solution to the issue.  
---
I can't pretend to understand why items in the shop are priced the way they are, but I understand that it's what keeps the servers afloat, so I don't dwell on it too much. If people are paying 1400 atoms for skins, it's really none of my concern.
---
For fallout standards, its a good raid.
---
Lol thanks.
---
The "Alpha" you fight can vary. I've had it spawn as a Grafton Monster.
---
Morgantown can be pretty good for just Radiation Fluid and other Flux crafting materials.
---
I am very lazy when it comes to challenges - so when the tadpole/possum quests popped in, I found myself just a few goals short of some rather large atom payouts... maybe there are some you just haven’t noticed.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Sorry only got treefiddy.
---
Hm alright
---
Oh, the \*mod\* "Extra Hooks" pops up every once in a while... but not the \*plans\* to make a meat hook, which is what I am really looking for.   
---
I found a meat hook on a random drop and scrapped it... didn't do squat.
---
Ya it took me 2.5 hours and a 5th of my monthly data deffanitly a bummer
---
I hear you.. I’m not looking at this from a fanboy POV.. I’m more or less acknowledging what I perceive as entitlement from some people. Any other examples where it’s ok to keep something you got from someone on accident? I do agree it would of been a considerate gesture for Bethesda to honor their mistake. It would of been a better PR move as well but they don’t owe me due to an obvious mistake.
---
I'm starting to believe this as well, thus the message. 
---
I will give 100 caps to anyone that can show me the plans.
---
 One of the first things I bought for my house. Its nice. ;)
---
I've had the sheepsquatch 4 times in a row now.....
---
What about people still waiting on the 4:8:2000 fix?
---
Use the search bar for questions and save yourself a lot of snarky answers and downvotes.
---
Did you mean tips for the game?
---
I know right, too bad I fell in love with the bone mask which looks pretty dope together with the bloody skin for combat armor
---
but hey, its still nice
---
Understandable and I'm sure to some extent you're right and it probably was an easier fix but if that's the case then communication needs to be improved to notify us what they're are currently trying to fix.
---
So we can see that they're noticing the more pressing issues and actively working on them.
---
There are many more issues with Fallout 76 (not just code bugs etc.) And how Bethesda handle them/communicate them and why they even exist in the first place. It's very flawed on many levels
---
Let's gear it to be harder &gt;:D
---
seen a lot of ghouls at whitesprings that had names that seemed like tasts for quest like "find the entrance to vault ..." or something among these lines also a lot of game crashes wich actually is the first time i encountered them so often it seemed like a problem (im on PS4 btw)
---
The 3 wave boss can also be fog crawler lvl100
---
Or... you know... do the event. :)
---
Yes I did, and thanks a lot!
---
It happened to me once already too. Don't know what was different, I logged in and they were all not listed for sale. Only happened the once so far. PC btw
---
yep! I'm cool with that
---
I agree just saying people like to whine. Look at melee you'll still occasionally see post asking for nerfs. Balance is great asking for nerfs is lame. Balance can be achieved by improving armor and though buffs too many enemies are bullet sponges.
---
Was wondering what the conditions were myself. I consider rain stormy weather but guess I was wrong
---
Apparently it was supposed to be 30 off hmmm
---
Noted
---
It really bothers me that there is no mention of the Purveyor, and the 3\* wooden Armor Scam that Bethesda has used on us, this is such a blatant issue, that ignoring it only reinforces the speculation that it was intentional.
---
stimpack diffusser is probaly in the project paridise loot pool acordin to leaks
---
Well because they are a tough enemy that hits hard.  You are choosing to forgo Damage resistances for mobility, so you should be easier to kill.
---
Well thought out constructive criticism is always welcome.  It's the chaotic, trolly negative criticism that gets downvoted.
---
Nah, its fine. I have never used VATS though. ;)
---
Happened to me twice and I am not sure why.  No damage to the generator. I was fast traveling back to my camp and noticed it was just the tent and not the vendor icon.
---
I posted a comment up here with "spoiler" and wrote what i have found for now
---
its almost like were two different people with different playstyles. weird.
---
That would make more sense.  Ten percent is hardly a sale at all.
---
I have had it go both ways where it seems to have no effect but other times it does.  Last nigh, I felt so damn clever because I perfectly arced one at WetTek to get a Supermutant suicider in the gas but... he only punched other mutants and never went boom.  It wore off and he started running at me.  
---
"Come on, come on, do it... oh, fuck!"
---
They could have just said hey we screwed up but we are going to be nice and let you guys have it.
---
Honey attracts more honeybeasts then naplam
---
But honestly I think we just disagree in a few key things. Bethesda is in a fledgling state as far as needing to provide a consistent face to there customer service.
---
It's destroyed better games and way better game producers
---
also applies to rapid firing of a tesla rifle
---
This has been my best source. I have 52 fully charged, got them all for under 200 caps each, some as low as 50 caps. I just keep an eye out for cheap cores, player vending has been a god send for me.
---
Because the flood of whiny, crying posts gets so tiresome, that the community as a whole is sick of them?
---
That, or the fact that d%ckweasels seem to think they have some justification to being d$ckweasels, either in game, or in here?
---
Why only 10% its suppose to be 30%!!??
---
There's a few fissures that aren't marked on the map. They spawn scorchbeasts for events. If the event is up the scorchbeast will spawn from that fissure, as soon as it dies another will spawn. I camp the fissure and kill them before they fly into the air. You can get a good 15-20 in a row in just a few minutes. I'm not revealing my spot or anything like that, last thing I need is for my farming spots to get nerfed lol.
---
If the event isn't up I start on the northeast side of the bog and work my way south. I usually get 5 or 6 then server hop and work my way back north.
---
Re-equip the perk card, helped for similar problems earlier. Also are you sure you are loading in 100% charged cores,?
---
Please bethesda, make bug fixes and perk card swapping QoL top priority before nuclear winter. (Feedback based on XB1)
---
Currently, 3/5 events pop up on the map don’t actually exist, and running with a team mate last night we had two different events where only one or the other had the event or received rewards for completing at all.
---
Melee hits failing to register despite making a connecting sound effect and being well within the hit box is often a life or death issue
---
VATs is incredibly buggy as well. Nearly unusable with melee at the moment (your character just stands there doing nothing despite being well within attack range). Ranged weapon shots miss 90% of the time on the first shot event with 95% accuracy.
---
Perk loadouts already exist for PC and seem to be easy enough to implement. 3-5 loadouts per character would be plenty (solo/team/power armor/crafting). Another solution would be to allow crafting and modding perks to work correctly as long as you own the correct perk and level and not have it equipped.
---
I would suggest leaveing out all the locations you dont need. That will give you room to label what you need to do at those locations. Right now its pretty difficult to make anything out with all the other items on the map.
---
The bug fix:new feature ratio is insanely unbalanced.
---
Rather than the plan, I was awarded the Bear Arms weapon itself from my one run.
---
I will have to do some exploring and locate these events
---
Like, OVER over? As in we won't be able to fight Sheepsquatch or do anything else associated with Wild Appalachia?
---
It'd be great to have a full list. I've messed around a bit by getting to max budget then scraping one item and seeing how many potted plants I can then place. Gives one a rough idea. It's amazing how many things take up the same amount of budget.
---
Need fix.for buzzblade damage. After last update got insanely reduced
---
Happens when someone elses camp is in your spot when you load in, at least it was those 3 times it happened to me, ended up having to move, shame really you find a good spot and suddenly every fucker wants to camp there.
---
Encryotid?
---
Solid, well presented, mature, constructive criticism doesn't get downvoted.
---
Childish, kneejerk, trollish "criticism" does.
---
It's really that simple.
---
well for me it wasnt exactly a enjoyable ride too managed to do the event 4 times
---
1 time the servers crashed
---
2 time i killed the lvl 100 sheepsquatch with 5 other guys and got a crappy 1* wood piece and i got the formula p recipe 
---
3 time i finished the event but i couldnt find the body of the legendary nor did i get a quest reward
---
4th time i was getting no reward either the legendary was a 1* robot chest piece with auto stim effect and i killed a 3* ghoul during the event called very cunfusingly like a questinstruction and i couldnt loot him because he was lost under the water :D
---
&gt;Also try not to use explosive weapons around the creatures,because they take damage like the hostile ones
---
Are you sure of this? I was just down there blasting away with my explosive minigun and my crabby friend seemed to be just fine. Ditto with Free Range, cows seem unaffected by explosives.
---
Also, Glow Sight is basically a must-have perk down there because of all the glowing enemies. +60% damage is nothing to scoff at.
---
There is a NEW MELEE weapon you can get!  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/kbVsy9r](https://imgur.com/a/kbVsy9r) 
---
I can only give you the German name for it, i dont exactly know how to translate that one correctly.
---
The German name is "Bärenstark" and its a Yaoguai skull, when you punch it makes rawing noises (sudle but they are there), just like the normal bears.
---
Im pretty sure it counts as unarmed weapon since it dosnt benefit from both gladiator and slugger.
---
solid post.. hopefully it gets the attention it deserves
---
I can take out a level 80 legendary Sheepsquatch during the event free range with my mole miner gauntlet very quick depending on stagger.  So I believe a couple high DPS builds could.
---
I'm friends with his nephew. He was my HR manager long ago and we went on a couple of dates slightly less long ago.
---
Ooooh look at the possum challenges also, only weapon mods description, good luck doing them &gt;_&lt;
---
No, I don't imagine they'll remove content, we'll just be moving on to the content they've attached to Nuclear Winter for content updates.
---
I died downstairs, took me and my teammate like 1/2 way across the map....wtf?
---
&gt;Any other examples where it’s ok to keep something you got from someone on accident?
---
Yes. In the US, If a company sends you something for free or a wrong item by mistake then you are under no legal obligation to return it. It's considered a gift. 
---
Granted the situation in Fallout 76 is different, but you asked for other examples.
---
Also the fact that up until today, you were capable of receiving other Badges that were outside your current rank, so wouldn't that in turn also halve or even third your chances prior to the update today? (I say third, as I'm pretty sure there's another rank above Possum, yea? But I'm not *possumtive* on that... \*snort\* ^(\[/)*^(horrible)* ^(dad joke\]))
---
How is the new weapon?
---
i am on PC. 
---
localized StringsID has been mixed up badly.
---
You can see that in xTranslator (a tool made for translating strings for skyrim, fallout 4 etc..., on nexus)
---
Had the same problem, this guys too fixed it. Thanks dude
---
Sent you a friend request
---
Yeah. But it’s pre war money.
---
Agree, im more likely to downvote the click bait titles ( can we talk about, unpopular opinion, this is the last straw, etc.) that are nothing more than whining than any halfway thought out criticism.
---
yes the strings ID has been mixed up :/
---
are you playing in french too? or other language
---
Two shay
---
Yeah
---
Contrary to the other people, I find mine quite great. Definitely more of a novelty item but only for durability and ammo restraints. I have spoken with several pvpers that use them almost exclusively.
---
I've decided most of the downvotes are 13 year olds that just think it's funny. Not any actual substance or reason behind it.
---
3. The loot from events are most of the time just rare recipes, many people already have or simply don't need. So most of these events are simply ignored. Most Events are just good visited because of the legendary Enemies.
---
Reddit pvp
---
The code indicates they have been on the exemption list for a few months now.
---
Because anyone left has heard it all
---
I picked up two extra last night. Let me see if I can dump and share them.
---
You might be on to something here...
---
Pretty sure 1 cap sales are bugged? If you sell 100 ammo at 1c each, you'll only get 9-10 caps.
---
There's more money to be made by treating your customers well and foster a strong sense of loyalty to a brand than the short-sighted road Bethesda has been on for a couple years now. Create a quality product and people will flock to you for it. This industry is now built on lies and deceit for short term monetary gain so that they can tell their investors that their finances are still growing, and realistically when everything is so short term, it'll start crashing down on them. EA is a fine example of this, they lost half their stock value in less than a year, and their greedy practices have created mass boycotts of games.
---
The developer room is hidden underneath the map and acts just like any other location, hence why you can see their dots.  I went to the spot to investigate and nobody was around yet my dot was next to these numerous other dots.  There are also no caves around so they definitely got into the developer room.  If you see dots not really moving slightly northwest of Cliffwatch, chances are they are in the developer room.
---
Sometimes supporting it gets more downvoted. Hell I have a player advice the other day and got downvoted. No idea why.
---
I bought one this past weekend on the market for 7k, I don’t think that’s exorbitant.
---
I got a green lined lab coat, yay...
---
Not the case here. Unless there was someone else who tried loading in, wouldnt place their camp and that somehow may have boned the both of us.
---
Cause you could get that elf in the first town to be a companion. Then pay money to have him train you in archery. From there you could just open his inventory and take your money back lol.
---
I'm thinking that a good strategy would be to isolate the alphas from the friendly creatures, as the alphas hit like freight trains and can easily smash a friendly tick or bloodbug.  You can't herd the friendlies, but you can herd the alphas together by grabbing their aggro and leading then to an agreed upon focal point.  Possibly leading them all to the main foyer while 1 strong participant agrees to keep each friendly alive against standard bugs and animals.  That person is likely going to miss out on legendary drops, which leads me to believe the modus operandi will involve everyone focusing on a single section and trying to keep one creature alive, or allowing two sections to die, herding together all three alphas and completing the quest with 3 legendary drops and one remaining friendly.
---
I have a feeling that the friendly creatures get stronger if you fill up their machine to tier 3.  I filled up the radstag meat one completely and got a lvl 91 deathclaw to protect, while only filling the sludge machine to tier 1 created a squishy-ass ghoul.
---
Getting all three machines filled to level 3 and keeping all three critters alive is going to be no small task even for a 24 man server filled with fully geared end-gamers.  Even then, communication and organization is going to be key.  The free-for-all that is the landscape of 76 events is not going to cut it.
---
Ya I’ve seen that happen. But as far as I know these level 100 enemies are no joke. I’m sure somone out there could kill it quickly but its a very rare occurrence
---
I always switch to my 10mm when a legendary pops and others are nearby. It's the nice thing to do.
---
Was gonna ask if you were from the Pittsburgh area because of "jagoff" then I saw your name. Hello fellow Yinzer!
---
Killed the friendly creature with it (it was a bloatfly)
---
I got to arktos had 2 invisible ghouls kill me, then random instantly took the junk i had, and game crash. 2nd try killed a 3* grafton monster got a 1* died from random radiation and random looted my junk.
---
Was the issue that caused all your stuff in your vendor to get unassigned when you log out and log back in again, fixed? It is a pain to have to redo pricing every day because everything seems to get unassigned.

I mentioned this somewhere before but: the matter is not as simple as adding a travel mat, they need to first fix dynamic loading. Notice that others' camps finish to load after like 20 seconds after your character. If you add a travel map right now, you will have people falling from 3 stories because the house didn't load.
---
Compared to say a tse laser would you say its netter....or compared to a plasma rifle flamer?

Jump to start Press E to attach at the other end. That works best for me. And trying to connect the Fusion Core generator at Poseidon your spam E on it.
---
yeah im getting a little salty at this point. ive been trying for hours. managed one completion, got a few stimpacks and ammo...
---
didn’t they added refriges in backpack?
---
Than people who just bought the game would be screwed.
---
Don't get discouraged early on over lack of ammo, water, supplies, caps, etc.
---
The more you explore and begin branching out, the more you'll be rewarded with all that stuff, so just stick with it. But do spend a bit of time around the Flatwoods area to get a handle on collecting and scrapping things and doing events that reward useful items. Start branching out when you're ready and PLAY AT YOUR OWN PACE.
---
I didn't "get" this game until I started branching out around that beginning area. To me it seems to be more about building up your own little piece of land and your weapons and gear in the wasteland than anything else. You explore the map, collect items/junk and kill enemies in order to find plans to build things at your camp or craft new armor/weapons, which will help you when you venture out again. It's a nice little loop and having events and other quests to do makes it more interesting.
---
I have added it.
---
That wouldn't change the fact that you would still need twice as much space to download something on Playstation
---
Also these "patches"  are adding new free content and bug fixes which imo is never a bad thing

I paid $320 CAD for the Power Armor Edition and they didn't even send me the bag that was advertised, nor did they even give me a real disc inside my case, just a code to download the game. And I also had to buy a second digital copy at launch because their copy came in 10 days after launch, plus they're selling pieces of a 2015 game at $3 a pop as cosmetic microtransactions. 
---
They also cut down on a lot of fees, such as voice acting, for instance. Easier to create a big game when there's only a handful of voice lines found in holo tapes and robots rather than create branching paths and an atmosphere. 90% of their assets were already there, and enemy AI behaviour was already coded in (or in some cases, reused from even older titles).
---
How'S that for income?
---
I’ve never seen this, I’m on PC and it’s almost always a big group some are taking down the ground troops and the rest of us are after the Queen. There was one time when barely anyone showed up, just like three of us and that pretty much ate all of my ammo. I’ve seen people go in to recover a minute but they are usually back out fighting.
---
Tried to be comprehensive and I'm planning to add images (food,rewards etc....)
---
It all depends on the challenges- I write off the group ones but the two before the glitch- the .50 caliber machine gun and the junkies switchblade were fairly easy  
---
everything for the machine gun could be gathered in adventure then switch to survival and craft and scrap- i did it right at my camp and was in survival for less than 5 minutes  
---
the worst part of the switchblade was gathering 250 wood- took me well over an hour across two sessions and did it all at the lumber yard near flatwoods --never saw anyone even though there was a number of players at flatwoods on the second session  
---
(as well as no junk, minimize aid- I stashed all stimpacks and radaway and kept only spoiled food and easy to find boxed stuff like blamco)
---
Try talking about pvp if you want downvotes
---
Sorry dude that sucks
---
No, I am not wrong. and my edit shows nothing of the sort.
---
But hey, you do you.
---
It would be nice if they showed our chosen name above and then our account name in parenthesis below.
---
😢
---
Look out it's the internet police.
---
No wonder no one wants to talk to you.

I always wondered about MxR using that song in his intro. My YT channel is literally called "The Wanderer" based on Fallout 4 and I was sorely tempted to use the song as an intro, but was heavily advised against it because although BGS licensed it to use in the game, it's not licensed for players to use in their videos (same with any real world music in the game). Very glad I didn't use it. Always knew that would come back to bite MxR in the ass some day. He's always played rather loose with copyright laws.
---
As opposed to tagging everything and then doing that exact same thing? Which already happens. I don’t think this would make that issue significantly worse, but it would help make events better for multiplayer.
---
decent roll TBH
---
Fixing a bug in the melee system is a lot more difficult and time consuming then fixing a item with the wrong flag
---
I’m waiting to find out also. Didn’t see any mention in the notes they fixed this
---
We don't even know what he got banned for idiot
---
but you don't need to one shoot them just shoot them fast
---
yes, the "internet police". For answering a direct question.
---
Got it. Makes perfect sense.
---
If you look in his recent uploads I think me made a video on the entire situation.
---
Fast Travel to Watoga Train Stn. Head South from spawn point until you find a stream, head East along the stream. Remember to use Green Thumb
---
At this rate, it'll take them a year to fix what's on this list.
---
I really can't imagine it'd be that hard to put a small check in place...
---
If player is attending event... *(and one, or combination, of the following)*  
---
\-has dealt any damage to 'adds'? **/** has made kills of 'adds'?  
---
\-has rotated their view? *(moved mouse or thumbstick)*  
---
\-has been at event &gt;15s before spawning of the boss mob? *(ideally I'd say like 1/4 of event's current run-time)*  
---
Then player can loot boss corpse and receives Event Rewards.   
---
Else, player only receives Event Rewards.
---
*\[Note: I am not a coder, I have just a rudimentary understanding on how it works through hours looking through code for game mods and plugins on GitHub, which I have seen such triggers and flags used to ensure similar things happen. But again, I don't technically know what I'm talking about so it could be a nightmare to add this in...\]*
---
I'm not mad at it whatsoever.  I put it up for sale in my machine.  2000 caps.  Someone will have a lot of fun with it.
---
Bethesda really showing their hand here and that’s coming from someone who participates a bit too much in the atom store. 
---
As a tip - **You can store and re-place them.**
---
_**You cannot swap mode type**_
---
- at least from cat to deathclaw.
---
As a stoner myself, this tip you gave me is very valuable XD thx!
---
Does anybody know anything about the miscellaneous recipes? Like recipe:growth enhancer

Heard nerfs are coming.

Downvotes have a 75% chance to make the poster butthurt
---
The vault raids in the upcoming summer updates were said to be instanced (and recommended for 4 player groups) at PAX East.
---
Where have you read these rumors?
---
Just have it so that enemies that scale up with numbers in events, like the SBQ, require being hit, but normal legendaries in events like Uranium Fever, just require proximity.
---
What does it do?
---
I have done it about 2 dozen times. Nothing. I go when it pops up, but no joy. Kind of like Fasnacht Parade. Kept grinding it for a unique mask. I think the chance is less than 10%.

So, in the 7 months that the game has been out there's never been a chance for them, as the community leaders, to receive clarification from the dev team and report back. Yep, that makes sense. 👌🏾
---
why on earth would you travel to vault 76?  
---
this does sound like a trap-  
---
just go to places players are not at regularly- train stations, flatwoods, Morgantown, Watoga etc.-- generally just some place in the boonies at or close to where you need to be to accomplish the challenge
---
It's not just here. The thought police think they have a right to suppress your freedom of speech.
---
They have changed the Burrows since last update, no Handmade spawn there anymore 😢
---
This isn't the forum, but … no, it isn't.
---
Gonna be honest... I unsubbed from both of his channels a while ago. I don't mean to be judgemental and I'm certainly not a prude, but his slooty thumbnails honestly belong on pornhub, not YouTube lol. And his second channel.. which I thought was going to be gaming... has just turned into a shitty YouTuber personality channel full of clickbait and PewDiePie wannabe content. I mean I get it, he has to make a living, but it's still disappointing. Had a lot of respect for him and learned a ton from his Skyrim / Fallout mods weekly series.
---
You are the man. They should consider hiring someone like you to collate all the bugs the community brings forth. Someone like you could connect the dots for Bethesda. Thank you.
---
3star grafton one punch me to death lmao
---
Cool.
---
If it restores health to all friendlies near you, that thing will be a must have for the new event and Free Range.
---
Haven't had this issue to much lately until this morning, I was able to escape the Damage, but the invisible Mirelurk Queen devastated my Camp for about 3 minutes until I could finally see her and put a stop to her reign of destruction.
---
The Range and Damage of the MQs spit is the worst in the game.
---
The Handmade spawn is behind the chem workbench in the Burrows, not the weapon bench
---
Impressive.  Damn.
---
light wood laminate light wood laminate

I get that. I never minded because atleast he is self aware. He knows He clickbaits and he knows why people watch him and he takes advantage of it. Good for him Imo.
---
Me and my buddy who I grew up with live hours away from each other. We played a ton of hours of H1Z1 back in the early days.. building our camp and maintaining it while shooting the shit, etc. We kept playing together on GTA, Red Dead but this has been the best multiplayer experience for us considering our appreciation for the building functionality and all around chill factor lol. Nothing like sitting by the campfire after a few hours in a mission and/or grinding. I’m appreciative of this game.
---
I always say something on mic before killing anything. I am lvl 254, and don’t really need XP. I just either tap it with Tesla or ask if everyone else present has tagged it before killing it. It’s the nice thing to do.
---
Even if you have mics muted, I've noticed that voice chat will intermittently bleed through, especially as you fast travel to an area.  Maybe that's what you heard?
---
I just switch to my lowest damage rifle (I'm a melee/heavy guns build) and get a hit or two in. Saves me from having to close the distance with the enemy and watch it get killed right before I get there and I can't one shot most legendaries with it.
---
I'd drop 1000 Atoms EASY for an R91 skin for the Handmade

I think this should be a thing, but I think some of them should be made with less special requirement with less effectiveness, while some could be buffed using this function.
---
It is because the problem for some perks is that they require too much special for maximum effect or good enough effect, but sometimes simply offering less special requirement is too much of a buff.
---
Rule: You have to max out concerned perks first and then spend an extra perk point to fuse them into one perk but it does not take away the base perks. Cannot be used in conjunction with base perks. 
---
Here are some ideas:
---
All:
---
All the 3 card damage mods: Combines 3 of the same type into one perk with 50% dmg boost. Cost of 5
---
STR:
---
Incisor + Martial Artist: +60% Armour piercing, +45% weight reduction, and +45% SS. Cost of 3
---
Bandolier + Bear Arms + Ordnance Express: -50% weight for ammo, explosives, and Heavy Weapons. Cost of 3
---
Pack Rat + Strong Back + Traveling Pharmacy: +20 Carry Weight, -50% weight for junk and chems. Cost of 3
---
END:
---
Chem Fiend + Chem Resistant + Hydro Fix + Munchy Resistance: Gains Immunity to chem addiction; consuming chems no longer affects hunger and thirst; +50% chem duration. Cost of 5
---
Iron Stomach + Natural Resistance + Thirst Quencher + Vaccinated:  -50% chance of catching diseases from creatures, food, water, and weather. Cost of 3
---
Nocturnal Fortitude and Photosynthetic :+20 max health and basic health regen permanently. Cost of 3
---
CHA:
---
Suppressor + Tenderizer: Reduce your target's damage output by 20% for 2 seconds after you attack; make your target receive 6% more damage for 5 seconds after you attack. Cost of 3
---
INT:
---
First Aid + Pharmacist: Stimpaks restore 30% more lost Health,  RadAway removes 50% more rads. Cost of 3
---
Gunsmith + Licensed Plumber + Makeshift Warrior + Power Patcher: Guns, pipe guns, melee weapons, PAs breaks 30% slower. Cost of 5
---
Batteries Included + Power User: -50% energy ammo weight, +50% fusion core duration. Cost of 3
---
LCK:
---
Better Criticals + Critical Savvy + Four Leaf Clover + Psychopath: +30% crit dmg, -30% crit meter consumption; each hit in V.A.T.S. has a better chance to fill Crit meter;  kill in V.A.T.S has a 10% chance to refill your Crit Meter. Cost of 5
---
Can Do! + Pharma Farma + Scrounger: 50% chance to find extra canned food, chems, and ammo in corresponding containers. Cost of 3
---
Luck of the Draw + Lucky Break:  Chance your weapon will repair itself greatly when hitting an enemy; Chance your equipped armor will repair itself greatly when struck. Cost of 3
---
There are plenty of well thought out, non whiney posts that bring up bugs and get downvoted. Most people left in this sub don't like/want to hear anything negative about the game. It's been this way for months.
---
Sadly there's not one, either invest, or buy them off someone.
---
Pretty sure vendor is the only option
---
Hell, we had at least five people standing around the friendly ghoul, but mole rats kept popping up and getting hits in. Nothing we could do. 
---
I think getting the rank 3 friendly enemies is key to making them survive. And that means you need a ton of feed in all three troughs. I think it took 60 venison for us to get the rank 3 glowing deathclaw friendly.
---
The website might not be accurate. I would just go by what the game says.
---
Yeah, this map is super information overload. I can't really tell what I'm looking at.
---
I drink dirty water several time a week while collecting Cranberries, we need a "Spit it Out" button.
---
Highly doubt they'll refund the difference.
---
Glow sights dont give you extra damage against glowing enemies does it?
---
The difference is that many games use fill textures on the weapon models.
---
The Fallout engine uses full rendered models so every variant balloons files by as many as you have.
---
It is not efficient but it does allow for better detail if implemented correctly.
---
To shreds, you say?
---
Lol, the fact we both have downvotes for really discussing nothing but opinions kinda shows what im talking about
---
They did give it to you, for multiple weeks.  If you didn't build one in that time, it's on you.
---
Also for the slow ones, its EXTREMELY likely the team handling updates to the Atom Shop/models/etc are NOT the same team that handles the game code/fixing bugs/etc.  PLEASE try and understand how this works.
---
Horde events get u legendaries when you kill the alpha 
---
Uranium Fever gets you a legendary weapon for every supervisor you kill(3-4 supervisors) and obviously the golf course at whitespring. (Those are what I use to farm legendaries for scrip)
---
Been looking for a seller and going camp to camp in the hopes of finding one. No luck so far
---
I'd just like to be able to edit the name
---
It says it was updated today so I don’t know if it’s a mistake especially with 10 percent off not really feeling like a sale. I’ll just wait out the clock a bit out of hope lol
---
So far I've had 1 failed event (all animals died on first wave the first time I did it), 2 Grafton monsters, 1 Fog Crawler and 1 game crash.
---
What about Stimpack Diffusers?
---
First sane post I've read in this topic.
---
I wasn’t the one that found it it was the guy from the other post I just know I told my step brother about it and then I looked it up and got this
---
Ty
---
Tse laser definitely outclasses it by far in range but the flamer is really pretty devastating at close range.
---
Me and two friends joined uranium fever it was just us we got to the end and this guy showed up with a tse shotgun and 1 hit every legendary before we could even get a tag. This was in the beginning when tse weapons were first getting duped. Hate to hear there are still douchebags doing this it ruins the fun for others.
---
Hmm, ok. Just dug into my email account that's linked to Big B, and I can find my confirmation, but nothing since then. 
---
*Gets paranoid the dreaded International customer being last on the list feeling*
---
Just wait and see I guess
---
Hab nur nen kack raider armor mod bekommen.
---
Yeah I just read the thread about the cat and deathclaw bush. You’re probably right. I’m a new player, it sucks to see things like this but it’s not the end of the world.
---
Removes rads without stripping mutations.  Plus, it’s grape!
---
Chemist one were you have to hit a wolf, bear and rad stag with syringer. I've tried it with a moded one and a blank one and it didn't count even after I killed a bear with one.
---
Yup, loving that feature, CTD within 2-3 minutes of getting into the area whether the event is up or not.      
---
IT JUST WORKS
---
I just wish that you had the option to change your character's name, as well as the profile picture that shows up in the Characters menu. One of my characters has changed completely from when I first made them, from a guy named Jared to a woman named Rebecca, yet their name is still Jared and the profile picture is still the original guy I made.
---
Yeah even though I'm disappointed.. I get it. I'm still small - only 15K subs, but if I ever got to the point where I went full time and then after being full time I started not earning enough to support myself, I'd be desperate to keep my head above water financially too. And I mean... MxR got his teeth kicked in with the adpocalypse RIGHT as he and his girlfriend moved into a new house, bought a whole bunch of shit for their house (furniture, appliances etc.) and IIRC they live in... LA? It's not a cheap area, and their house is clearly upper end, probably very expensive.
---
6. Toilets :P
---
I know there's a pool behind that agricultural center in Flatwoods, it has tarberries in it. Make sure you use the Green Thumb perk like Dannyravenhall is stating for higher yield.
---
I thought I heard grunting noises when someone was hitting an Assaultron with a sword a few minutes ago, and nobody had a mic either.
---
The perk does. Not the actual glow sights on a gun
---
if you didnt know: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIvzY8H81bg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIvzY8H81bg)
---
to clarify- the leader board has the top 3 only  
---
tip: don't get on late at night if you don't want on the leaderboard, fewer players means it is easy to be on the board  
---
tip 2: if you caan, stick to the boonies since you can only fast travel to vault 76, train stations and your camp (most people are not gonna try to run for 15 minutes to get you if you do wind up on the leaderboard)
---
Where is it? For when I build my next character. :D
---
Who needs 100 bulk anything? Learn to let go. Sell it for your daily 1400 or put it all in your vending machines. You obviously seem to know where to get more junk should you later need it. I like the idea but I personally wouldn’t ever be in need of it
---
The grading system gives you stronger friendly enemies to protect. Rank 1/3 venison gave us a glowing wolf. Rank 3/3 venison gave us a glowing deathclaw. You can probably guess which one survived longer. 
---
The event ends after you kill the alpha, assuming any friendly enemies are still alive. I got a super stimpak recipe and an arktos lab coat.
---
Where did you find the code?  Granted, I didn't have the chance to fully check every nook and cranny of the area in my limited time, but all I found was one holotape that led me to the locked door in the sub-basement.
---
Is the level 100 boss a bigger bullet sponge than the Queen?
---
Oh ok forgot about that thx
---
OK good to know will hold off on trying those then.
---
More like a matter of future revenue vs. cost of doing business.
---
I think it produced ore before. It's been a while I've used it. All the workshop griefing as kinda turned me off from so many great things.
---
It's really a nice sight, if you get close. The whole thing, at least the long arm, is really shacking.(when it's powered up)
---
When I had it, I usually place the fast travel mat to the van near the collecting box. That way people can't easily rush in and steal the stuff.
---
Also the collecting box, so it will have the stuff inside. The "event"  also gives you some ore/ect as reward, so I think that's somewhat misleading. It doesn't clearly say you need to go empty the collecting box.
---
Just only had to happen once to me to go and downlod the saveeverything mod. Lets you type prices in with rhe keyboard instead of fucking around with the slider. Making things much easier to put back in the machines.
---
You can get out of the foundation when you’re stuck?
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.  They used to keep the known issues thread pretty up to date, but I don't think anything has been updated on it for more than a month or so now. :/
---
I firmly believe that each pellet from the shotgun triggers the heal individually but I have no idea how much it actually is. I logged onto my character and noticed two minor changes from the build I posted above ( [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96335ff&amp;d=sd0so0sp0su2pc2as2ic4p02cf2eh2sg2a72am2au2ao0l71lu2lv2lt2lr2l10a40a00&amp;w=&amp;n=Toazd%20Shotgun%20Medic%20v1.2&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96335ff&amp;d=sd0so0sp0su2pc2as2ic4p02cf2eh2sg2a72am2au2ao0l71lu2lv2lt2lr2l10a40a00&amp;w=&amp;n=Toazd%20Shotgun%20Medic%20v1.2&amp;m=) ). Move 1 point from charisma to strength and change blocker to rank 3. I also replaced rank 2 sneak with rank 1 marathoner and rank 1 adrenaline. I'm currently testing rank 1 mysterious stranger in place of rank 1 grim reaper's sprint but since it's one point it won't make a huge difference what you put there (I still think grim reaper's sprint offers an incredible value for 1 point I just want to try something different).
---
Im surprised there is no notification...
---
It was buggy, messy, and heavily unbalanced, but that's not the point.
---
It had all the factions you want (or don't), formed by players, and players fought for territory; waged wars against different factions; set up rules and tests for factions; did diplomacy stuff and shit.
---
It was role play to the extreme.
---
Sadly it died by now.
---
they do test, on closed in house servers for Xbox only and under ideal conditions with minimal stress on the connections and machines. Basically if this was a single console multiplayer game you play with your buddies in your living room on 4 xbox's then it really does just work, but in the real world where we all play it falls apart fast.
---
... you're just repeating everything OP said he knew about.
---
Do you mean blueprints into buildings?
---
I'm on XB1 and every time i try to go to the basement the game crashes. Is anyone else having this problem? Is there a fix?
---
I'm wondering if it happens like it did for me but people don't have room for the weight in their stash. I know that i didn't put it in there myself as I had just repaired all my armor before logging for the night.
---
Just ran it again with 8 people and failed. And they all focused keeping one animal alive. This is no joke lol
---
What components are required to make a diffuser?
---
I have my mic turned off and whenever I load back in the game it’s turned back on but in the settings is says it’s off. Maybe that’s why it’s not showing up when they’re talking.
---
If you need a mod i think i have one that dropped from a treasure map.
---
The upcoming content for nuclear winter had something along the lines of you resetting yourself to level 1 and getting special bonuses - perhaps that can be tied into it?
---
It’s kind of shitty The hoops to jump through to find the traveler and get your first deluxe camera. I got mine at the battlefield cemetery and ever since I have been finding them in random junk boxes everywhere. 
---
And to top it off there are three different cameras you can find and only one is the right one.
---
I had this exact thought today as well. I saw the new event was active, but I didn't go to it because  I didn't want to fast travel into complete chaos.
---
Maybe i'm wrong but could it be from Penny? The scout leader ms nanny?
---
“Dropping frames” is the term I’d use to describe it.
---
Did you pick it up and it was actually the bracelet? According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brf7h1/a_lots_of_strings_are_messed_up_in_french/) much of the French localization is scrambled.
---
the dev room cannot be removed from the game ever, it is the anchor for all models of items in-game, try deleting that room from FO4 and see what happens.
---
Honest mistake, I read the title and didn't notice the sub-details.
---
Yea same here man! I don’t get what all the fuzz is about
---
For real
---
You can server hop to trigger it repeatedly.
---
Downvote me as much as you want, these shouldnt have been in the full release, they literally block rooms
---
It was a joke
---
Go talk to SBQ. She will fill you in on next steps.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
North of Watoga in the river. Just follow the river east/west and with green thumb perk you'll get plenty
---
&gt;Why wouldn't they just bring back the mat that allowed you to set the spawn location
---
Top two contenders are duping and griefing
---
Why is melee broken?
---
To be fair, parts of West Virginia look like that now. Even without bombs, there was a few decades of unrest and shortage, and then 25 years of absolutely no government. Roads and buildings can go to absolute hell pretty fast without upkeep. I've gone in to renovate homes that were vacant 10 years and fallen through the floor. I've seen potholes filled, and 6 months later looking like craters again. 76 is probably way more accurate. If anything, the later fallouts don't have nearly enough decay.
---
&gt; plan:bear hand
---
Please tell me this is a gauntlet like She's Embrace.
---
No then it it affects gameplay even less 😅 I don’t see your point
---
What do the drugs do?  Are they like mutations, or like Psycho and Mentats with limited duration and addiction chance?
---
I've gotten the lab coat so far.
---
So far I've fought a sheepsquatch and grafton monster.  Both hit like freight trains.
---
Cool, I can team with you and we can go in for a survival speed run to complete the challenge if you want.
---
I'm sure he didn't drop the nuke on Fissure PRIME
---
Sell some of that shit, u don't need all that and I'm pretty sure they want us to be limited in weight so we do have to farm resources at some point. They're always trying to emphasize survival
---
And if anyone doesn't know, diluted rad-x or rad shield can be used if you want your mutations to stay active.
---
This isn’t unique to Bethesda. Every dev does this.
---
Oh holy hell in a hand basket. I need this.
---
I would love that. We can either coordinate here, or in DMs. Thank you!
---
Open your social menu, click on your own name, and click leave team.
---
You may be on a phantom team, and its blocking you from joining other teams.
---
I saw a player wearing it ingame once. It was definitely in the developer's room, at least
---
You’re absolutely right. I agree with every single word you have said. I also stand by my own opinion of some players responses.
---
Sounds like you have the same issue as me.. did you by chance have the quest appear before it was released when you were around the area its meant to start?
---
Fuck that lol

More like the Sheepsquatch from Free Range.  You can actually see the health chip down with an AA/E handmade rifle, and an instigating hunting rifle makes a nice chunk with the first shot and again when it regens.
---
Its not that deep, just switch modes
---
Sheepsquatch
---
My camp is very near site alpha. There has been several times that I am there or even just loaded in and watch one fly.
---
I had to delete an 80GIG game from my playstation simply because you need enough space to download all of fallout 76 plus the update to even start it. So stupid.
---
So I have tried 5 times to go down and keeps crashing. Lucky for me my house is right next door. On Xbox
---
Same here im on pc,when i logged in 2/5 daily done and 3/6 weekly done.
---
My game keeps crashing when I attempt to use the elevator at arktos pharma. I can’t participate in the new event.
---
I recently started hiding the frog jars around bases when I'm building or decorating for other players.
---
Mission accomplished  
---
dont forget if you shut down ARIC-4 the animals will fight back instead of being passive
---
Rework the salt perk that's already there. Instead of just extending shells life of things in your inventory, make it like weapon artisan where if you have the perk on when you cook you get up to 200% condition.
---
encryptid, the one with the imposter sheepsquash
---
Not only this is the wrong place, but you are wrong as well.
---
Which event?
---
No, I didn’t get the quest till it was released
---
Up voted for the down vote
---
Nuke-Cowla will live!
---
Ah not sure then, sorry
---
just you and about 50 other people that posted this within the past few hours...
---
Bethesda wants that you buy only pink and rainbow skins for your weapons.
---
For  **Issue: Combat Rifle "short scope"** , I have been able to repeat this multiple times with a scoped lever action. It only seems to happen when I'm button mashing vats, aiming, and possibly reloading
---
Yeah, you mentioned explosions dealing 1 or 5 since the explosive effect would hit the chest and deal damage to the 5 parts. Proc 5 heal vs 1 heal. 
---
So i was asking if the crit of the shotgun ended up hitting multiple body parts which triggered the heal. But I see what you're saying. I have a medics missile launcher so I can test the explosive effect on the parts.
---
Hmm Schade ;)
---
Gibt aber noch ein Bärenschädel als Nahmkapffwaffe und ein paar Pläne ;)
---
I want bug fixes too but the game would feel so dead if they stopped adding content for very long.
---
Yesterday's challenge included squadding up with 4 players but since I couldn't see anyone on the map and none of my friends have the game I couldn't get the weapon
---
cool looking, but ultimately just a different deathclaw gauntlet
---
Just because you dont use the weapons that have skins doesn't mean others including me dont. I love the lever action and wiffle bat skin.
---
if you fear dying, just stay crouched and always stash your aid/junk.  I play PVE, but jumped in to survival for the war hero gun.  it's not that bad.
---
I thought that's what they were doing as well.  But if they were, it was a long break.  Any rate, I still dont feel sbq fights are worth the effort.  Especially now that I have learned how to build an entire set of ultracite armor.  But to each their own.
---
Xbox will tell you if something's wrong and will prompt a  redownload.
---
Yep. Same here, although I've seen a few people playing on YouTube, not sure how they're doing it.
---
It is a recently died mod called "New Vegas Multiplayer", players could form factions (like it's shown both in game and forums), and fight for territories (with capture function).
---
The mod itself was kinda shitty as it had balancing issues, bugs, content issues, and stability issues.
---
However the players driven mod was once a prime example of extreme role play during its greatest days, as players really devoted themselves into it.
---
well, Im pretty sure they were designed to put smelling herbs into so the smells of dead/dying people wouldn't be unbearable.
---
But, thanks for the heads up. :-)
---
97/09/30, must be the oldest devs birth date considering how little they seem to know about the fallout franchise
---
What did they do, ban the guy for speaking the truth?
---
It takes time and money to shut them down. There's also legal implications. They're not changing code. They simply do what the game allows them to do. It's difficult to charge them with an offence for doing what the game let's them even if it's not intended to be used that way.  Bottom line is it costs Bethesda money for no gain.
---
For some reason Paulie, I get the feeling when you try to teach someone a lesson it never works out well for you.
---
You don't  mean that. They always consumed the cores. They are just like fusion cores, batteries.
---
You mean the thing where crafting more of them, scrapped the one you just crafted. Yes Im fairly sure it's been fixed. For safety you can drop each onto ground before crafting next one.
---
I know this is a funny post and all but... This has to be one of the most embarrassing updates for any game I've played. New event, they advertise it on the roadmap and main screen on login, but if you try to do it you crash to desktop. Unbelievable this made it through "testing"
---
Nah
---
Bethesda doesn't care anymore. They just cherry pick sometimes bugs that are easy and cheap to fix. Most of the bugs have been in game like 6 months already.
---
I'm curious. I came across a player vendor. Had 10k+ 556 ammo for 1cap each. I bought all their 556 ammo. How much did they get from that?
---
You sure this isn't because you have some mods installed that aren't updated yet? I don't want to say that you're lying, as I haven't even played the game yet since the update
---
Yeah I gotta say that the "echo chamber" retorts are usually irrelevant. Just because it’s a criticism, does not mean it’s constructive. People downvote because they disagree, not because they’re blind to the games faults.
---
You do realize this is r/fo76 I believe your post title was supposed to say Returning player- Does this game still suck please correct your title.
---
LIVE DAMN YOU!
---
Boonies?
---
It can one shot anyone in the game if used in stealth with a Gunslinger build but yeah scrip it.
---
Gauntlet from the wild apalachia trailer
---
I do like to hear that. I'm like already nostalgic about the few sessions fresh out of the vault and actually feeling vulnerable. Mad that one can run around with 20% or less health and still not feel very...threatened.
---
Thanks, the queen is still a bigger sponge then, which is only level 95 though. Maybe the sheep boss should be 90 instead of 100.
---
The excavator doesn't require baby sitting. Sometimes no defence event shows up.
---
If I had to guess, expect a preview roadmap with the ItV next week
---
Don't know, I don't run unarmed. Looks like a deathclaw gauntlet except with a bear skull. Which looks as badass as it sounds.
---
Is survival just junk?  No caps?
---
Also, no fear.  Just do not like pvp in such games. Its devolves into just griefere spanking their e-gos.
---
Same, I got down there first time and started event. Game crashed about 1 minute in and now whenever I go down the elevator it crashes.
---
Yeah I agree, there only so long you can keep a hungry legendary alive to try and let people have a hit on it before you have to kill it cus its dealing a lot of damage to you or wrecking your armor
---
Texture issues sporadically happen. Film at 11.
---
Thanks that’s good to know
---
Normal drugs like pscyho I have to p-serum or something like that and it gives you charisma gun accuracy and 3 endurance
---
how dare I
---
im guessing optimism is downvoted hehe
---
Exactly so why.
---
I haven't done that
---
Took me a few weeks. Hardened is still the top.   .50 cal isnt anything special
---
The things floating are because they're are sitting on things that haven't spawned in.
---
I really don't think the level of decay is that odd for 25 years.  Just look at Chernobyl.
---
If anything, it's odd in Fallout 4 after 200 years!
---
I can't wait to try this and see how bad it is cuz I remember when ppl were saying the imposter sheepsquatch was hard and I thought they were lying at first, I was wrong
---
Was there ever an announcement that they were free?  Did you ever have to go into the atom shop and redeem them like every other free atom shop item?
---
Maybe but it leaves everyone who plays honestly with a bad taste in thier mouth knowing people are cashing in on duping.
---
It's really irritating to run that silo only to see 10 players at the clubhouse by the the time you get there. I usually try and find a quiet server before I launch. Helps cut down on the leeching but only in a situation like today are you guaranteed EVERY kill.
---
Can’t imagine fighting the queen in a basement lol
---
A lvl 50 scorchbeast is way, way tougher than a lvl 68 super mutant.  Maybe they just have better DR or something.
---
I’ve got a full compliment of heavy weapons, including launchers... only ones I’m not carrying are broadsider (sorry, it’s trash) and gatling laser (it’s... okay.) I have a bloodied harpoon gun for sniping. Vampire LMG for health regen vs the sheepsquatch. Bloodied 50cal for big beasts or fast movers. Instigating FFR gatling gun for everyday trash and rough sniping. Bloodied Flamer because... because. I recently started carrying a bloodied minigun and gatling plasma, but I can’t stand the spinup mechanics in this game, pretty sure I’m going to sell them off. 
---
I carry 2shot fatman and missile launchers as well as a bloodied autogrenade as well- explosives synergize well with HW. Running a lowhealth build actually makes them significant- my fatman is listed at 3200 damage.
---
You can't do both because reasons?
---
To be fair, things tend to go from tickling to one-shotting, if it were more spread damage-wise across the board, bloodied builds might be more rare.
---
Yes! The right to Bear Arms! Now I just to duel wield them
---
Pc runs better, and you can run mods.
---
I’ve posted about the discrepancy between rewards for pve and pvp a couple of times. It really seems unfair to those of us more interested in helping players than killing them.
---
Can you do it solo?
---
That’s very true, the scale probably is not universal, sheep boss is the best sheep ever, on sheep scale lol
---
same in french, see in your pipboy possum badge, you have some nuclear winter info
---
Are you fucking serious?  Know why this got patched so "quickly"?  Because it was a single flag that was improperly set.  they didn't just spend weeks dedicating all of their time and manpower to fixing the fucking topiary over fixing actual shit.
---
Think of something more like a cavern that a dragon and it's minions would live in.
---
I need it and now.... is it a plan?
---
Nothing like finally getting in there, unloading all your ammo for no loot. Took down a 3* fogcrawler for zero loot, same with a lot of the other enemies. Killed a couple dozen enemies for empty corpses. Good times. Be back when this shit is fixed.
---
It's in Arktos Pharma; there's an elevator to a lab below it and an event to defend cute animals from predators.
---
Higher risk, higher rewards.  Seems fair to me.  And I am PVE only myself.
---
As far as I know, this one is exclusive to vendors.  I've never heard of anyone getting it from a random drop.
---
You have serious hoarding issues bud...this is not fallout 4
---
Cool,I'll be on in about 3 hrs :) IGN Meidara
---
Gimli is that you? R/lotrmemes
---
I think thats what he was getting at, every person is a jack of all trades so being special at 1 thing does help anybody, no need to be a team medic if they can medic themselves to the same level, no need to be a heavy gunner if everyone else is also a heavy gunner at will, no need to be team sniper/explosives expert/crafter/hacker/lockpicker/builder/trader/hauler........ect
---
Morgantown is one of my least favorite zones, second only to Charleston, but it is good for flux materials. The area just east of Ft. Defiance is a crimson collector's dream, and just south of the water park has as much violet as site prime. But nothing quit compares to good old whitespring.
---
Jokes on you! I cant do any of that because i lost all my money and junk to a troll who kept killing me for 15 minutes! Ha... ha... i lost so much junk
---
OMG true !
---
I’ll be at work for at least another 4 hours. It’s currently a little past 2pm
---
I'm a herbivore and if carnivores get jerky, we should get pickles and  sauerkraut.
---
Must be situational, I completed the event 3 times without issues...
---
behind aric4 downstairs. there is a door passcode 970930. find the engineers terminal and get shutdown code. go back to aric4's terminal and shut her down. THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE AT THE FIRST STAGE OF THE EVENT
---
I see 👌 can’t wait to give it a try!
---
How do we initiate the event?
---
or you could just sell it and use the tokens(caps) you get back to buy some if you ever really need it.
---
I may start using "sheep" as my universal measurement.  I weigh about 2 sheep.  I'm probably 2.5 sheep tall.  My house is about 10x30 sheep with about 800 cubic sheep of living space.  My place of work is about 17,000 sheep away.
---
I dont use mods on FO76
---
I haven't seen anyone excited about a battle royale, lol. Just people saying they hate the idea, which I agree.
---
Yep, same here, dashboard everytime I try to enter regardles of time in game.
---
I was in there for a good while they should have spawned in, we actually completed the event in there before I took these, maybe they just didnt spawn altogether for whatever reason.
---
And this is why I run two accounts - so when I nuke, if I d/c when trying to use a diluted radaway, I can rejoin, and if people are there taking all the spawns, I don't mind - I'll just wait 5 minutes, rejoin the game, and spawn them all again.
---
It was every doorway
---
Pretty much the same as the last time they broke sneak. Sneak will just randomly break and you go into danger even when there is nothing there to see you.
---
If anyone ever wanted to see what is wrong with some of the people that play this game, look no further than this thread I guess.  
---
Bethesda isn't allowed to fix ANYTHING unless they fix every single other problem at the same time.  If there's a bug that benefits the players not only should Bethesda NOT fix it, but if they have the nerve to then any benefits that bug gave should be provided for free from that point forward.  If Bethesda does fix a beneficial bug then obviously they dedicated all of their time and effort from the past weeks to that single project instead of fixing things that really matter.
---
so last time i had hitching it was actually linked to the weapons i was using. picked up a 3\* legendary missile launcher and had modded it up with a quad barrel and everything . normally run shotgun/rifles everything ran smooth till i pulled it out, then it hitched aver 20 ish seconds, other in my team had no issue. swapped to my shotty and no issue again. every time i had the launcher i would hitch. so finally sold that off for scrip and have not hitched since.
---
Stupid question perhaps, but why not move the entrance or location of the room every patch? Assuming the room itself can't be removed entirely from the map.
---
obv i know it's harder and less friendly but Survival doesn't mean PvP or nothing. There are player-to-player encounters in Survival that don't end in a gunfight
---
I just want more songs in general. Maybe bring back big iron by marty robbins
---
this is the real question
---
Welcome to the club, no go and do it again and again and again. One day RNG will bless you and give you 1 God tier item witch as soon as you pick it up will cause the game to crash, you game unit to catch fire burn you house down, make you SO leave ya for some random pharma sales person. And ......
---
Damm I ran out of things anyone else.
---
All kidding aside grats o. Your launch. If you did not launch @ prime go to site alpha and pick up the jolo tamp upstairs to finish the overseer's joirney (for now). And then go hit it again.
---
it's the release date of Fallout 1
---
I’ve seen this a few times but I don’t understand how it could give away spoilers? If it’s obvious I apologize I’m a total idiot.
---
LOL hope your boss is not as tough as imposter sheepsquatch 😂 😂😂
---
If I ever get in without crashing I'll let you know
---
Ya this has been an issue since launch. Seems to happen when a npc is fighting another npc.
---
green thumb doesnt work
---
Seriously?  I have something about that in my stash that I found eons ago and decided to hang onto it. 🤔
---
LOL same.  It smashed my friendly ghoul down with a single hammerfist, then came for me.
---
Heh, I'm a gourmand, I only eat the finest canned dog food. Asides from that, I'm not really interested in food. Ping me here when you'll be on, and I'll log in and go through my mules. I'm sure I have a few good ones for you.
---
so its ok for 2 weeks we cannot even use vats? for 2 weeks most hits dont even register? please remove the bethesda shlong from your mouth and try to think for yourself
---
Done it 4 times, failed 1. Make sure to get the aggro away from your pets quickly. Provoke and draw the Alpha away from them.
---

---
Yeah I've swapped back over to my stealth sniper and pulled the TSE handmade out for the hell of it, try and use some of that ammo while saving up 45. Feels off taking a few shots to drop a mutant. She's also got an instigating gauss that makes it too easy, any standard enemy is down in one. 
---
I like the handmade, its a super fun gun to use, but when you've got something that not only is more 'efficient' in killing but also consumes less to manufacture ammo...seems stupid for me to not use it 100%
---
I went in there and didn't find anything special myself... Just the Red chest that's it
---
They're not asking for a handout, they're stomping on the ground flailing their arms in the air and throwing a tantrum demanding one.
---
And if they don't fix all bugs they're not allowed to fix any bugs, gotcha.
---
You would pay the full 10k, but they would only get about 10% of the caps. I don't know if they fixed anything in this patch, but it was bad when vending first opened.
---
I accidentally changed my plasma Gatling to an ultracite model and so the plasma cores require yellow flux and I get that from the Queen.  They hardly happen anymore anyways though so I’m just at the ammo factory up north and collecting lead from my resource collector.
---
Good point. The vid below is Chernobyl now. Most of it is pretty close to what we're seeing. 
---
https://youtu.be/9DWnjcSo9J0
---
Hurr Durr u so funney z0mg
---
They just released an update with a new dungeon that most players cant even do due to crashing immediately when attempting to enter. Other languages have challenges for Nuclear Winter, and NPCs named after weapon mods and quest steps. Bad timing on this post.
---
Bethesda is waiting for several months in which they will ban every player who has duped items.
---
That has been their logic with this.
---
Don't go after the source. Kill everybody including the innocent people who didn't know they bought banned items.
---
thank you!
---
*the right to arm bears
---
That is what I do but sometimes it takes multiple times moving before it let's me fast travel.
---
So they were possibly dropping tadpole badges even after I graduated? I had no idea that was happening.
---
I’m still updating so I’ll have to check my collections when I’m back up
---
i think this would make berkeley station something like big cities in MMOs (WoW for instance). So every player would go there instead to any other vendor, which at least i would find annoying because it kinda crushes the wastelandfeeling.    
---
I do agree though that the mire could use another vendor bot
---
Did it occur to you that they are supposed to? Everything loaded fine for me, all items were placed upon other items. No floating. Seems to be your system to be honest. And yes, certain areas are blocked.
---
No some guy got mad at him and they both said words against the rules. Pretty dumb if you ask me
---
You have to trigger it by going to "pylon ambush site" and using a "recall keycard" on the terminal there, if anyone on the server triggers the event then a notification is shown for everyone on that server similar to that of the scorched beast queen event.
---
You are given one recall keycard via the mission and can buy more from just about any vendor for about 2k caps. It's not as popular as when it first launched and therefore not as frequent.
---
You sir win the trivia contest, didn't know that, thnx
---
1. Get more than one creature. More creatures means better chance to succeed. In order to do so:  
---
2. Communicate with other players. Turn on area chat and use your mic.  
---
3. When it's time to fight the Alpha, draw aggro away from your creatures. If the Alpha is attacking your creatures, you're not doing enough damage.  
---
4. Stagger is your friend. Stagger the Alpha as much as possible.  
---
5. Mop up adds as quickly and expediently as possible during the Alpha fight.
---
Usually every game calls it patches, updates are more for dlc per se. Plus they are still fixes bugs as you can see in the patch notes
---
Just the materials, for me.
---
Except theres a cap on those thats easy to achieve
---
And the code at the Crashed Space Station is the release date for Fallout 76.
---
I haven't checked out the codes at other locations.
---
I did, as I crafted excavator PA, repaired a set of  ultracite PA, then crafted a set of x-01 PA.
---
I mean in caps, so i dont have to get the materials, but thanks anyway
---
I believe there is a small percentage that it can be earned through workshops or something to that effect.
---
I had trouble finding all the parts, they are in each of the areas and are sheets of paper on desks and such.
---
I can say with 99% certainty that you're correct.  I use an AA/E handmade rifle that will easily kill a lvl 91 deathclaw with a handful of shots and I was defending Fido as he was running around the facility like a crazy person, and never saw his health move at all despite using VATS on ants and crickets swarming at his feet.  If my explosive ammo was hurting him, I definitely would have noticed.
---
If you use sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, &lt;your mods&gt; instead of sResourceArchive2List you won't have to change it after every update. Credits to the BetterInventory mod author who had it on his mod description page awhile back.
---
Thank you for reporting this. In this case, the article was incorrect and the 10% discount listed in the game client is intended. The article has been updated to match the actual discount in-game.
---
I won't come to encrypted because I'm tired of tanking pylons wasting my stimpaks and doing all of the damage to the imposter......then when I die there is some asshole hovering above me not helping kill the imposter because he is waiting to steal my loot bag which doesn't even exist because I dumped my loot before the event. I already got the fixer plan and all of the cosmetics and don't need anymore 1* legendaries.
---
well are you going to update the guide or what.
---
It occurred to me that they should load in anyway, havent had this issue anywhere else in the game, at least not to this extent, just left a bad first impression of my first walk around of the building to fine that it looked almost half assed.
---
I build you one (with my materials) for 750c
---
That’s not true look at my posts criticizing this game. Most of the time I give an alternative answer but it still gets downvoted.
---

---
Thanks for fixing that!
---
See, this is why I was against the idea of linked cap pools. There isn’t really anything wrong with hubs, and we need one other than Whitesprings. Watoga is kind of like this and you don’t see too many people use that as a hub so why would Berkeley Springs be any different??
---
I'm thinking that the bloatfly was just so squishy that it likely died from a radant bite or Gutsy attack.  Those things may as well be made of discount toilet paper.
---
The problem was the deathclaw launching itself towards the sheepsquatch but maybe I'll try next time ! :)
---
Thanks for fixing that for me
---
It is actually part of the quest. During the first wave you can go down here, get the shutdown code, go back upstairs to ARIC-4 and enter it. Then the animals will help fight against the waves of creatures.
---
Or at least that is what other posts have said....
---
I had a level 100 3star alpha sheepsquatch as the end boss, he dropped a 1 star assassins leather leg
---
Well I try again, thanks !
---
Deal, my gamer tag is KILLIETOTTIE. Im on just now (also how much budget does it take up)
---
Yes it can but will take a 4Gb patch to implement.
---
When you die in Arktos’ basement you get sent outside far enough that it can mean you aren’t participating anymore
---
cant be used in power armor, and the damage is underwhelming. but it is cool.
---
HES RIGHT FUCK THE BAG! LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
because there is a bit more risk.
---
It's like asking why does betting on black only double my money in roulette, but getting the correct number gets me much more.
---
Because the less risk, the less reward.
---
I switch to my, albeit lvl 50 and "Heavy" modded, Shepherd's Crook for this event. It's enough to easily wipe out the lvl 3-7's since it deal 150dmg with my Adrenal/Bloodied centric setup (perks tailored for rifles though), and takes a couple hits to take out the Cave Crickets. The legendaries, be it Naia (Nia?) or the Radscorpion, are not phased by even a few hits with it. 
---
I opt to use that, than anything lower damage dealing, like my bare fists, because I've often been screwed out of getting to loot a corpse on higher-level beasties, even though I've registered at least 2 or 3 solid hits on it. I just assumed that in the grand-scheme of its health, they were too minuscule and insufficient to qualify me as having 'tagged' it. 
---
Either way, I'm right there with ya. I go out of my way to make sure everyone doesn't have to deal with the adds  and can focus on the Legendary. I tend to the fire when it starts to go out, for the same reason. I make sure to hit just enough to ensure the game has registered my part, and let the rest do the same before I really wail on it.
---
As such, MMO etiquette: Afford others the same courtesy in return.
---
TL;DR - People, just play the lowbie events with weapons that are on par with what those enemies would face. We're there *too*, for the loot, even if it's lower than we'd use. Maybe we have friends we'd like to give the items to? So to borrow the old VHS Rental jacket's reminder: "Be Kind, Please Rewind!" :P
---
Because PVP toons need weapons. PVE toons need atoms to make their camps all pretty.
---
I have found, through trial and error... that if you move, AT ALL, while connecting the first wire... like.. any movement whatsoever between pushing that button and the wire FULLY connecting to the first terminal... you will "jump" when trying to connect to the second.
---
So, push button... WAIT til the wire turns green, THEN connect to the second.
---
You've got mules......and than you've got assholes who ruin the ability to have mules because they are abusing the game mechanics.
---
I haven’t played this game in months, reading the thread made me think there was a new cool logout cutscene or something until I realized it’s just something new that crashes your game lol
---
That one I knew, considering this I should just check release dates whenever I find a new keypad in the game. Probably save a ton of searching.
---
Like I just said, it’s a LOT more difficult and complicated than incorrectly flagging an item.
---
Then theres the fact that there is separate teams working on different things. Most of the team behind Fo76 is working on NEW CONTENT while basically a skeleton crew is working on bug fixes. It’s literally not that hard to understand
---
They probably dont bust them because its Sony and Bethesda making extra side cash off of dumb people willing to pay cash for items twice they already bought the game.
---
Ah okay, well, I'll see if I encounter these missing textures too. :)
---
Oops, okay so literally just nodded my backpack for the first time and now I’m out just a few materials for this. If you have 2 pure cobalt flux and 2 pure fluorescent flux to throw in, we are good to go. I’ll lower the price to 500.
---
White Springs can generally be good for all sorts of junk...also enclave bunker... or any hospital....or the .junkyard.
---
... you know you don't have to kill people in survival... right?
---
You want to roleplay a responder or helper character, you can. you just might end up dealing with an actual raider, or enemies that have better than AI behind them.
---
“Sometimes it be like that” - Toddd
---
Underwhelming compared to existing Unarmed weapons?  Not surprising, but kind of a shame.
---
Also I’m not sure on budget. But it needs 30 power
---
Is this just a canned reply you people are going to use for anyone that has any complaint about the new quest? It’s not even clever. And He’s not even talking about the difficulty of it.
---
Well, looked fine to me. Well planned, nice setting, well made destruction, hidden basement was as an interesting addition and the shutdown mechanic is a cool touch. Sorry your first impression was bad, but it does not seem to be a problem with the place itself since it loads as it should for others. Perhaps verify your files? Something could be missing or installed wrong during the patch.
---
On PS4, we have this happen. Or a team member looks like they are in the main menu. We just kick them, or they leave. That fixes it. Though it is annoying to have to do several times a night. We've never had problems being able to actually team up.
---
But... what kind of junk?
---
I have always had my jump key on shift, never space bar. 
---
I get this annoying glitch, and I have no key map for jump on space bar.
---
Gears
---
Freaking out, I just downloaded the update and it finally worked!
---
Wow. I didn’t see him say anything that hasn’t been said on here a million times. The other guy though, he was triggered with his potty mouth.
---
Scratch everything I just said lol. I have the materials now (with contractor on). So 750. I’ll join u.
---
Oh good question! I'm not sure if the pellets hit the same body part or not. I expect if each pellet triggers the heal then each pellet should have it's own accuracy check (sort of like the two-shot effect) and therefore could miss the intended target and hit a different body part or miss altogether. I have no idea if it's true or not. I think I would have to delve deep into data-mining to find out that sort of info.
---
And at full health you don’t get the OP power of a bloodied build. It’s called a trade off.
---
They already have new looking skins for the Handmade. All they need to do is actually put it in the shop
---
This thread is about one shotting things and your solution is be faster? Be faster than one single bullet? Weak.
---
Probably harder when the pet is an aggressive predator. In one of my cases our pet simply ran an hid. Smart boy.
---
Ok, cool
---
yes you loose caps, but it is apparently limited to your level number. level 76? loose 76 caps on death.
---
If you are level 647 you should have been playing long enough to know how to gain caps, especially with combined cap pool of 1400 without traversing the map.
---
&gt; considering how little they seem to know about the fallout franchise
---
Sometimes your own words just come back to bite you dont they
---
Lol damn. Were you in survival mode?
---
You don't really understand what I'm saying
---
They patched the game today and didn't fix this.
---
75% chance of downvote actually counting
---
I have seen him about 5 times. 
---
Once at the lighthouse... and the other four just around the forest in seemingly random locations. 
---
Another 2 times I have just seen the "poof" after he vanishes.
---
could be better if its unarmed, i dont have those perk cards i assumed one handed so i may be a moron.
---
So silly they didn't just let us have them in perpetuity, really WHO is going to pay atoms after they had them for free?
---
I built 2 deathclaws and 6 cats the day I saw them in the build menu because I knew they would "fix" that the first chance they got. Just wish I had a bigger budget so I could have stored more for future builds.
---
It came as a weapon without unlocking a plan. Maybe scrapping it would but idk if I want to yet. :c
---
Don’t hold your breath.
---
I agree with you. I was honestly hoping for a high radiation, dangerous enemies and special reward PvP mode that happens in... well, winter. Granted, that's waaaayyyy to much to ask for a winter redesign but the rest would be cool. For me at least
---
I named my player after myself so the Mr handys of vault 76 call me by my name because they reused codsworth's voicelines from fallout 4
---
It's pretty overwhelming if you go alone.
---
Different games different methods. They aren’t doing it because it’s fun.
---
Indeed!
---
Sadly, being triple-digits and fighting lvl 5 - 20 creatures is never one of those situations. This is from someone who is also a triple-digit level player, but running around with 100HP (bloodied/unyielding) and can do that event just fine ***without*** resorting to power armor or jumping on top of a building. :P 
---
This is what stimpacks are for, after all!
---
Ugh, 8.5 GB is nearly 20 hours for me and my shitty rural farmnet.
---
Only if we can change them in the file menu
---
I found one in a locker. Sigh.
---
I’ve been screwed before. Hope you’re okay with paying first
---
No, he was just a relentless dick with enough armor to survive a blast from everything i had, and i am... not known to give up lol
---
Especially when you get "that guy" during uranium fever rip
---
Add me ooOKLGOoo881
---
Did you decide to get the clear coat option?
---
I played it the other day to level up an alt. It wasn't really worth the extra 20% XP but my strategy was to let enemies kill me Everytime I got close to the top 3.
---
what the hell did I just witness
---
I do. It’s not a bug, there’s a delay. It forces a trade off for your overpowered build but not my less OP build, suggesting that it’s a check to make your build more balanced.
---
Wish I had known this before I logged off, 😝.
---
They did not fix it.
---
1:  $  The damage they do to the game is not worth the cost of paying someone to investigate, ban, read an email address for reports, etc.  The monetary damage dupers like them do is nearly non-existent in a business model like this - if that wasn't the case, they'd be shut down instantly.
---
2: They ban in waves, all games with intelligent people running them do.  They just haven't been banned yet.
---
But you can? He never said you can **beat** all the activities solo he simply said, you can **play** solo. This is still true with this event. Nothing is forcing you to party. You can go to this event solo. You can start the event solo. You can complete the event solo. I did it today at lunch without being in a party. There were 2 other people there but I was never 'forced to team up' with them, I was solo. Once again, he said "...you can **play** this solo." So tell me, what is keeping you from **playing** this event solo?
---
could not be mad if i ran into this one day
---
So i got an UGL with AA 25% and 90% weight. It's amazing but i don't have any mods. Is there an update to this issue or is it time for me farm line in the sand?
---
Sh!t. Is this going be another “killed instantly” event like Encryptid?
---
I’m so mad about this. I atom grinded and debated on that or the dark wood laminate and of course I had to go and buy the light one. Lol now I just have to grind again cuz I don’t want to spend money on this game anymore....
---
I've got about 200 hours in, and I JUST found 51 last night for the first time.
---
I knew that screenshot people had of it when pvp was first coming out wasn’t a skin for the deathclaw gauntlet -.- idk why people get so dead set in things and assume and throw it all over the place when it’s not even the correct information lol. 
---
But it looks really cool and thanks for sharing!
---
I mean if the deathclaw had more HP the fight would have looked pretty cool :D
---
And his wife?
---
because the QA team reported the file size.
---
^ this guy gets it. 
---
The Leroy Jenkins "Gimme mine" players of the world will never be patient enough for this sort of thing.
---
I crashed 3 times.  I am going to try restarting my Xbox and hope it helps.
---
Do the melee perks improve the bash damage?
---
Script that beach
---
I still neee the £*&lt;king camera
---
Now that is interesting! So it may be based on proc and not hit? But still also count hp toward number of possible hits? 🤔
---
Thanks for the downvotes but the op edited his post
---
What is it
---
From what I've seen from the community, "It's not broken, you're just not playing right". It happens every time stealth breaks. I don't think a lot of people play hardcore stealth characters. Just my opinion though.
---
Hey Bethesda! 
---
CE-34878-0 is causing issues again on PS4 version of the Fallout 76. 
---
Escpecially when there are more then 3 players in Arktos Pharma event. The frame rate is horrible and the game crashes with the lo0vely Ce-34878-0 error message!
---
Please fix asap! Or when you get the time!
---
What do they say exactly? Everyone says it without giving specifics
---
it sucks for me... I have rural internet, and these updates take me outta the game for at least 24 hours at a time.
---
I'd be worried Bethesda sees the potential to make income from this. Or maybe some of these sites are them as one Tin Foil hat theory already suggested. Lol
---
Good! A challenge for once.
---
You prob have a disease, a few affect that
---
Why do I have to work today 😭😭
---
On my character, I don't have any penalty it seems.
---
Awesome man! I just turned on my playstation I'm excited to see if mine is fixed too
---
It's the part where you feel that you are the judge, jury, and executioner of what is considered acceptable.
---
This is a game with a mature rating......not the Huffington Post. If you don't like someone's comment move on.
---
It's been the normal routine for me, with speed demon it's always dropping quickly, but with the right perks it's not entirely out of control.
---
whats the point of pc I like paying for internet and a subscription service to use the internet on my 300 dollar game console I like it when the game lags due to inferior hardware. The human eye cant perceive over 30 frames a second.  
---
also anyone who is downvoting, its a  joke not a dick dont take it so hard
---
Try repairing the gun. I think it happened to me because the client thought the gun was good, and the server may have thought it was broken.
---
Used 400-600 ammo, died stupidly coz nothing was dying to my 3 star gatling, when i logged in next time the bar only had tiniest sliver of 'condition health'
---
There being a miscommunication on weapon condition is my only thought... as the enemy health bars went from full to empty to full to empty, and despite other players killing them, never any loot for me.
---
I find that thunder mountain (inside and the workshop) provides a shockingly high amount of good junk (tons of hot plates, fans, plastic and aluminum trays etc.). Don't forget to search the exterior tents...
---
What are you talking about, most patches are below 1gb for me.
---
Red chest?
---
Make a post
---
Go to The crocodile park, there’s a brown car pointing to the main gate in the parking lot. And there may be a body with the camera. I quit and join 12 times to get it.... but my friend only took 2 times... so...
---
You cannot click join event - you must spawn at a location near it and walk to the pharmacy and enter that way - it worked for me
---
Are you [this guy?](https://www.youtube.com/user/KDbutler2)
---
Been playing since december, found one in the forest that bolted, and went AFK in savage divide and one attacked me so i killed it.
---
Are you kidding???
---
Are you also going to update the article to show it's the SMALL water purifer, not the Water Purfier, with the corvega paint??
---
You are complaining on a tool with which you could have used to get the weapon, instead.
---
Eh, I've been watching Oxhorn play Rage 2, which made me want to play Rage, which I picked up on a Steam sale a couple of years back.  
---
Having a ton of fun in that game, probably will get Rage 2 after the price drops.  Mama didn't raise no fool.  😎
---
[Here is the list its the same lines from fallout 4](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Codsworth/recognized_names)
---
I also believe that these are the same people who report memes on Facebook.
---
Maybe, Ill have a look again tomorrow, these were my only problems with it to be honest though, other then that, good level enemies, lots of them, interesting little event, lots of legendary enemies
---
I'm just adding to his point
---
Confirmed didn't work for me
---
I want to fail, it makes the wins better
---
Really sorry to hear that :( I walked from gauly mine if that helps
---
No idea but the Assaultron was light blue colored and had normal Assaultron hands, not the blades. Also im level 81.
---
You on PS4?
---
I guess the others who had this happen are reporting it fixed now too. I just started my update so we'll see
---
I found one
---
I’ll try it out
---
OP asks a question... I *assume* to hear answers.
---
I provide an answer...
---
then, ironically, along you come, to tell me that providing an answer makes me wrong... and you call *me* the internet police.
---
You do see how that's a pot-kettle-black situation, right?
---
This is getting surprisingly little traction. The only front page post I see about it is 'ha ha the new content makes us crash every time.' This shit is ridiculous.
---
Your E-rep is going to go down if you dare talk negatively about Fallout 76. The snowflake thought police are here.
---
Glad that you are enjoying the game I also bought the game at launch I was a little pissed at black Friday pricing but overall I have almost 400 hours into the game and I also enjoy it.
---
It’s a lot of fun, and a real challenge but the crashing sucks.
---
Haha this. Love it.
---
I'll try that, wish me luck
---
The Red steamer trunk
---
Remember, the only reason you have so much junk, is specifically because you DON’T use it. 
---
I followed the “Don’t keep more than 100” of anything rule—individual pieces, not bulk—and maintained stash space pretty well. Recently I’ve dropped that to no more than 50, and I’m doing just fine. If there’s a big project like a craft &amp; scrap to learn mods or a house rebuild, I’ll just go buy what I need from CAMPs or vendors. It’s so much easier than storing all that crap. 
---
Some things, like lead, plastic and steel that get used for ammo I’ll just make sure to use regularly. Everything else gets vendored. There’s no shortage of junk in the world. When you need it, you’ll be able to get it—and you’ll never need 700+ lbs of it.
---
There is a hidden faction that can reveal more to do with the level of destruction in Appalachia, but I’m not sure how deeply into the plot or how much you care about spoilers.
---
Yesterday... the challenge in question was still bugged, and you could have done it in adventure mode and gotten that sword along with the rest of us. #captainhindsightwinsagain  
---
fixed it this morning. :(
---
Light wood laminate
---
Fuck the bag, Lightwood laminate! lightwood Laminate! Lightwood Laminate!
---
Yeah please spoil what it is using the spoiler tag, it's what it's for.
---
General junk, I'd go for Blackwater mine, getting all the miner weapons as well as all the usual debris, and adding a snoop around the Whitesprings does the job. Hell  for giggles I stole all the table settings, vases, anything that was removable at the resort proper.
---
But this is an over-arching post covering all events. In which I apparently have to modify my play style and use more resources (stimpaks) all to suit someone else. How about not going to events if someone else is there? I usually don't. But if I do and I will let someone else tag when it's prudent for me but I don't want to hear it if you didn't get "your piece".
---
It's like BGS are purposely just making stupid events.
---
I really do hope it works for you. I know I couldn’t get in for ages
---
I can confirm: I bought this recipe at Whitespings.
---
last time I did this it deleted my screenshots
---
Good info, I'll edit that tonight updating to "Scoped Weapons" as I've heard reports on the Handmade and Radium rifle as well.
---
Hit up the deathclaw on deathclaw island. Has 6 gears, takes one punch lol
---
Fallout 4 CC skins had this
---
Delete before they fix it.  Save everyone plastic.  Shit.
---
I just wish these update were available at night not early morning, would be nice to to set the system to rest and download while I sleep instead of having to wait all day to play.
---
The limit is tied to the server, it takes 3 hours to recharge. You can server hop and use the cards nonstop!
---
I'll join in psn: nwa_terence
---
Everything hits extremely hard. All of the robots explode for very high damage in a very large (almost seems bugged) radius after dying.
---
I've waltzed through the game rarely dying and only if I was careless, but this place has killed me a couple dozen times already. Getting one shotted by assaultrons, slapping me down like an insect.
---
What does that do?
---
Thanks, just trying to do my part to make this as playable as possible...
---
Because at this point, they need all the players they can get. They also know that there are almost no youtube videos being made about their game, other than those rightfully mocking all the broken and disappointing elements. So, why ban the only content creators you have left, those that are showing players how to exploit a broken game that is little fun to begin with?
---
Shouldn't those be for Raids not Dungeons/Events
---
What!!! The shishkabab counts towards the friendly fire perk!!!!!!!!
---
Mechanics and strategy friend
---
Where? I have Friday off from work and this would be awesome to explore
---
That's great and all, but my camp is floating. Lol I'm not stupid.
---
If you do one at 830 est I'll try to be there psn is pasta_la_v1sta
---
Interesting! I'm going to try that out later
---
Pfft. I’m level 245 and I die instantly and constantly on Encryptid. Lol
---
Nope. Free-range pond-dwelling.
---
Yeah, hey a man can dream. They are op but so hard to get them cheap and only the ones you want.
---
Well, can't tell if this is more trolling or a real comment, but the "Process" for fixing issues can be time consuming due to red tape, they've already fixed allot, but have a long way to go.
---
If you're selling plastic in your vending machine, it'll subtract from there before taking it from the rest of your stash.
---
Thanks! Fr sent
---
Lol I see
---
Good point, I've got a note in the 9.0 patch update, as that was a stealth Nerf they admited to, I'll add and submit tonight.
---
A bug that benefits us? Hope it is on xbox one.
---
I get what you mean, but doen't look like overpowered weapons
---
I've got the polarizer or some shit flame that reduces damage output on things I attack by 20% so figured that would be a dope support wep.
---
Yeah, its the only melee that works with Friendly Fire. Its cool, but the shishkebab needs a serious buff.
---
I figure day one of a new area is not the ideal time to explore and "do lore" so I mostly just took advantage of constantly spawning enemies.  I tried to listen to a holotape, but couldn't hear half of it because of constant robot pods opening, explosions and gunfire.
---
No.
---
I'm just saying look out for the snowflake internet police. If you do not share their view point they will down vote you.
---
It's not just here...... look at Twitter and Facebook......if you don't share the same political view as the snowflakes they will report you until you get banned. There really is no need to down vote anything, just move on and find a post where someone is giving Bethesda an E-handjob.
---
Watoga Plaza is where I've had them spawn while server hopping, signs and letters the plan is called but they're expensive! 8-12k depending on how high your charisma is and perk cards
---
Thanks 👍
---
The vault raids coming this summer are instanced
---
Early on we were treated to extra couch/chair varieties with no warning or input needed.
---
Exotic weapons perk? If the survival guide mentions an exotic weapons perk then idk, theres no such thing in the game. You can craft them with Gunsmith (rank 5 I believe) and mod them once you know the plans for the mods, and presumably also gunsmith 5
---
there is a cap on the amount of crap you can have in your stash that is even easier to achieve.
---
I agree.
---
I didn't bother with it, as I feel it looks really stupid unless you have your base at the whitesprings, but it was Bethesda's eff up.
---
Assuming this is not trolling, yes...  
---
I've got an insane number of hours into the bugs, and there are more than ten times as much as could fit on a single Reddit Post.
---
I'm alittle dyslexic my friends have started pointing out...but the internet needs to make the scotch beast, all attacks make you drunk!
---
Not sure if it’s really abusing
---
Just fix the challenges. That’s all I ask. It’s about all I look forward to doing now and I start working on one challenge only to have to give up half way because it’s bugged
---
Wait what? People are cheering this bullshit?
---
How bout "Player vending machine items NO LONGER COUNT TOWARD YOUR COMPLETELY SEPERATE BUILD BUDGET"
---
I ended up in there right after an event so was just exploring to get the layout.
---
What platform you on?
---
I’ve had it not spawn as legendary 1/5 times
---
I honestly haven't touched the shishkabab yet...but I can imagine.
---
that's not even on the list of known issues anymore as far as I saw when I looked them over - Bethesda's attitude seems to be if we don't acknowledge the issues, then they don't exist...
---
The event is bugged as fuck and though I hate to say it, it probably should've been delayed. It's absolutely not ready.
---
Yep. I don't really care if someone else gets something they didn't earn unless it was by taking it away from others (including me). So long as I get my drops I'm happy.
---
Was the frog mounted head mentioned?
---
I just sold some this afternoon. I'll be putting more up for sale later this evening.
---
Any word about the lack of Deathclaw hides?  They have gone from obtainable to almost unobtainable.
---
We will get new challenges with nuclear winter and these are stated.
---
Thank you for the test.
---
Ah I see. Thanks!
---
I got Barney the friendly death claw, I thought it was a play on Barney the dinosaur
---
I mean.. should Bethesda just leave all of their exploits/glitches open in case someone is upset they missed it?
---
I understand that the gesture would be nice, but I find it the equivalent of asking for Bethesda to bring back limited time items, like the Deathclaw Easter eggs or Fasnacht event, simply because you didn’t realize they were in the game.
---
Not that I know of, many names are repeated over and over so only a few actually contain spoilers and such. Like...many different variants of ghouls are all named “Plan: .38 caliber receiver”
---
Lol for sure!
---
The guide is outdated. The exotic weapons perk was removed with the earliest patches. For the radium rifle, you would benefit from rifle-based perks like rifleman for semi-auto or commando for fully-auto. I'd also recommend getting concentrated fire and tank killer.
---
Yeah, it wouldn't take as much to just have fallout carried by winds and falling all over the place if it's meant to be a prequel of sorts. 
---
I think most of the nukes that fell were between 700 kt and 1 Mt. Bombs probably fell on places like Knoxville, Nashville, and probably Columbus Air Force Base in MS, and probably several fictional important targets nearby. All that fallout would create the eponymous Nuclear Winter...
---
That error code is common with all crashes.
---
Agree 100%, but my biggest issue with one shotters is when the enemy goes flying off so you can't even find the body...
---
For me, can confirm this.
---
The only announcement I saw about it was in the Parch Notes. I’m sorry someone downvoted you for asking a legitimate question.
---
Overall just a really lame way to play. Lmao
---
Is there a list somewhere of the loot that is possible to be rewarded from each event/repeatable quest? That would be really nice.
---
Ohhh dang, I actually do I think ... gotta check when I'm back at the house
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Hah, I guess so!  That 5mm does go fast, but even then I bet you're pretty set at those junk amounts!
---
I get it tho.  I carry at least 50k .50, and around 10k each 5mm, 5.56, and 10 mm.  Guns = 0 dps if you run out of ammo, amirite?
---
Ohhhh....thank you
---
Dungeon chest
---
I never claimed to have that knowledge or be that involved with the game to be aware of it. You however are merely being petty and a dick by insulting me over my wording when it has been abundantly clear that they really don't know the franchise that well.
---
If I remember correctly, I am inundated with gears at the moment and could give you maybe 100-200 for absolutely nothing. As soon as my update is finished copying (why does this take so long?!?!) I'll have a look. Doesn't help you in the long run but thought I'd offer. Cant remember off the top of my head what junk contains gears.
---
Cause Bethesda is not good at details
---
Its the same issue all energy weapons had, except the Shishkebab wasnt buffed when they buffed the energy weapons a couple weeks ago. I was initially going to go with the pyrolyzer and do heavy weapons instead of melee like you but flamer fuel is a bitch to make. I keep two melee weapons on me, a shishkebab I named Giveth for healing, and a Vampire assaultron blade I named Taketh for more damage output and solo play. I am a alchoholic pyromaniac preacher. The lord Giveth, and the lord Taketh away. Im just keeping my build and praying they buff the shishkebab soon.
---
We are the test server. You're funny.
---
E N T I T L E M E N T
---
Damn, I've been looking for the frog head forever!
---
Honestly not too happy with this patch they need to honestly chill with new content and fix the bugs they hardly fixed any bugs with this update
---
Funny how Bethesda immediately prioritizes fixing bugs like this because it conveniences the players.
---
Serious question.. What’s the benefit of using VATS in F76? I play melee too and find it more trouble han it’s worth so I’m wondering what I’m missing.
---
I hear you.   I don't *need* the Plasma Grenade plan or even the chemistry scout badge...but it's out there, and I *want* it!
---
Wow, I love real fake sales!
---
Aaaannd they changed the post to have Light Wood Laminate on sale for only 10%. [May 21 Atomic Store Updates-Updated](https://imgur.com/0ad2Dzq)
---
I like this idea
---
I love me some light wood laminate
---
Facts right here, so clean!
---
Thank god. I still haven't fought the Sheepsquatch, I would hate for it to be seasonal like Fasnacht.
---
pretty useless if it cant drop as legendary, i dont know why they dont allow all weapons to be legendary..
---
Like a picture of a unicorn, thanks!  The hunt continues...
---
Could you eliminate static enemy spawn points once a camp is placed? 
---
I found a junk pile in the mire that I built my camp on only to discover a small clan of radtoads spawn every time I visit my camp. I don't mind if it happens once in a while, but it's every freaking time! 
---
With the exception of fissure sights, if I stake my claim in their former home and clear them out, that area should belong to the Apex predator now, not a never ending source of giant glowing toads.
---
I was searching for that one from the beta too and I haven't find it yet so I think it isn't in the game rn
---
No that’s truly mind blowing, thank you for your hard work compiling this.
---
Bethesda has confirmed that it was not in the game by accident. someone else just posted about this and they got a reply back from Bethesda saying that they couldn't find it anywhere in the game files
---
Interesting. I've had both wood armor go down to one star and an assaultron head go to two lol in any case I hope it gets fixed.
---
No worries.  It's enough to know it *is* out there...  Thanks for checking!
---
I believe mole miner breathers contain gears. Might be their suits. Either way, after clearing Blackwater mine you should have a few.
---
There’s a lot of that around here, unfortunately. Having a different opinion will put you in the same boat.
---
Maybe we should hold hands and sing instead..
---
No, what is mean is ignoring professional bug reports for six fucking months. Bethesda doesn't deserve professionalism from me at this point after they've ignored me from the very beginning.
---
Yeah, buying from a vendor is far too pricey. Hoping to either get lucky in a workshop or find someone willing to sell.
---
same for me and my friends.. it's just didn't work
---
No problem, though admittedly, it doesn't discount the possibility that ore is different, or that there may be the occasional item that might be able to be taken from the vendor.
---
This is a game with \*lots\* of quirks (such as stabilized flux being junk not misc like gunpowder?) and it is currently impossible to test all possible options.
---
But from what I can tell, putting items up with a price removes the items from available inventory unless removed from sale/stash
---
Oh my lord that sounds juicy, if you're on ps4 add me Ragefright. 
---
Really sucks they didn't up the shishkabab, it's such a iconic fallout wep.
---
Also, I mainly want to go with the pyrolyzer (thank's for spelling) because of the other perks that reduce enermy damage/increase damage taken and AoE so more things effected by my support.
---
Looks like this is happening for my bf currently. Same server as mine. But I’m not crashing.
---
You could always try over at the marketplace subs
---
Sure know it better than Obsidian or interplay as the biggest success from the series is by bethesda
---
my Camp still 'auto dups' itself everytime i DC  maybe fix that also 600 ammo signs to scrap
---
I find if you use vats on them they die quicker.
---
I'm sure you know they haven't fixed the third person glitch with it. Normal range on a shotgun is only a fee meters but if you switch to third person it will spread the bullets across the map until it hits something. The damage may be reduced now bit it still doesn't stop people from spamming it from there glitch bases. If you're so down for pvp though, why are you wasting your time here? Are you worried some players might get wise and band together against the ass holes and start ganging up on them? Lol
---
And yet it wasn't mentioned in the original 9.5 patch notes that they are doing this.
---
Sadly just read in another post plastic is still pulled from the sale pile. So it seems to be an item by item basis.
---
I never had that shop before recently, but all the posts did say it was ore.  It definitely is scrap now, but as a balance (I guess) now it only runs for 30 mins instead of an hour, but the cores cost the same.
---
Finding the box was a trip the first time.  There's a waypoint quest marker on it during the event now, though, so not too bad.
---
I'm level 200. It currently takes me two days to get a level in adventure. Constant grinding. Fuck that shit.
---
Because the salt you are giving off is wonderful.
---
I have yet to see one and I have been looking.
---
But the tracking says I have scrapped one, and a few days ago I hadn't...
---
So... must have at some point... and no idea where. wish there was a way to track sub objectives, not just when you complete all 5. Just glad i am a pack rat who grabs pretty well everything.
---
Im on Xbox. Its a good build if you can stockpile fuel. My build is very similar but melee instead of heavy weapons. Have suppresor level 3 as well.
---
They also didn't fix the chemist badge.
---
This is an online game, and one that advertises and promotes grouping up and playing with friends. However, the friends list is almost completely broken.
---
For example, it routinely shows people being offline or in the main menu *despite them literally standing next to you in game*. Team invites routinely bug out and the other party doesn't receive an invite. Or you manage to join the team, but it doesn't show you the stat/health bars for your teammates. It acts like you're playing solo, but other players can see you.
---
These are all core, basic components of an online game, and have been broken since launch.
---
Sometimes it's the lil' stuff that makes Todd's "it just works" comment all the more meme-worthy.
---
Machine gun as well.
---
You're have to PM me your build when you get the chance I'm very interested. 
---
Does it work as I imagine and basically remove you from the Aggro table?
---
Yeah dont forget your free 5 levels in the other room.
---
Eh... I disagree.
---
I enjoyed RDR2 as a story, I just really hated the gameplay. It was the most fucking babymode thing in existence, it literally autoaimed for you and made everything automatic. But that story still blows FO76's out of the water.
---
*Now, if we're comparing the onlines, hands down its in FO76's favor*. Even with an absolutely abysmal launch, FO76's launch was still significantly more enjoyable than RDR2's. RDRO was just a glorified cash sink.
---
It is the faction in the Whitespring bunker.  If you want to rush it on a character you can explore the abandoned waste dump in the mire due east of the southern belle motel, iirc. It should start the questline to join them there. Sequence breaks the main quest, but its a fun rp thing. :D
---
bugger.
---
sorry to hear. I have an excess of plastic so when i sell it, I hope it gets sold rather than used at higher priority than other plastic. (much like how at one point mods were apparently the first source of junk used)
---
I really wonder how these items are coded to have such drastic differences to items being used in the same way..
---
ok so Gauley worked!! However since everyone else is crashing I'm stuck here solo. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
&gt;They also know that there are almost no youtube videos being made about their game, other than those rightfully mocking all the broken and disappointing elements
---
Really? Rightfully mocking the game gtfo FO76 is better than it's ever been and getting better. You want upvotes post that garbage on r/fallout but even they are coming around on FO76. Way less hate there than there ever was.
---
Everyone knows on youtube "Fallout 76 sucks" gets more views than "Fallout 76 is a good game no seriously it really is"
---
Stop dude...  stop comparing them and just enjoy both. Seriously don't ruin RD2 for yourself. Take it slow and enjoy it.
---
Omg I was joking but it's actually not there? OK we'll stop looking until it gets mentioned in some future patch notes I guess. Thanks for sharing, I hadn't seen that other post yet!
---
Kinda wish it was a skin cuz my main weapon is a Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
Ok that's funny
---
Awesome I'm going to check this out. Thank You!!
---
Try having a team mate make you one?
---
is Project Paradise permanent or timed event?
---
Rip
---
I was actually having a joke but hey ho, i guess i opebed up a bag of ready salted here
---
I'll do it here for all others that might not want to get it directly in the face.

Trying to find something to argue about here but I can’t .. damn you reddit I want to be offended !
---
It happens to me too after every new  update all the new stuff is never translated correctly,still in english or messed up like this.
---
Id like to think its more of a “Help!!!!!”
---
Its sad... for nearly every review I watched for this game.. my “douchebag alarm” went off just by the sound of their voice. 
---
I can’t speak for all reviewers... but from the ones I watched, these reviewers aren’t true gamers. True gamers approach new games from a perspective of love and curiosity. 
---
These reviewers (ESPECIALLY the bigger YTers) all have massive ego problems. And they’re more concerned with making you laugh and sounding cool than actually diving into the art of gaming.
---
I think I found one of these the other day. The fast travel dumped me in a basement of the camp with only a locked door to get out and a live turret. I didn't harm anything though so the turret never went off except to kill a glowing toad that had wandered in too. Wasn't really a good trap as I could just fast travel out.
---
No problem!
---
I’ve seen him many times server hopping at Charleston station trying to find that vendor bot. Lvl 35 - easy to one shot with my TSE BPR
---
If I have others with me I never do. Il get out a melee weapon and hit him once then back away. 
---
IMO, a good way to solve this would be to allow all players involved in the event able to loot a legendary creature.
---
Its not chaos until the lvl 100 end boss comes in
---
What’s up with that one? I haven’t started it yet.
---
I haven't seen the specs on it or what the task is what does the shotgun offer
---
Where do you see the survival challenge weapons list? I’ve seen it in the past but can’t find it anymore
---
short for boondocks-- boondocks is an American expression from the Tagalog word bundók. It originally referred to a remote rural area, but now, is often applied to an out-of-the-way area
---
Haven't played in months.
---
Still waiting for them to fix this game to what should've been day 1 levels of programming.
---
Have they fixed the Power Armor bug where if you have 2 or more sets of Armor out you can't collect them without going into and exciting each one?
---
Finally decided to start becoming addicted to Chems and alcohol and start using my junkies gauss rifle and I must say I’m very upset I didn’t try out this combination before because it’s a monster ... damage almost doubled on the rifle and no drawbacks like bloodied with that health cap
---
😂 raider version of old man crossbones
---
I never had a problem. Did it about 4x before work today.
---
Hadn't seen any since the mothman week (when it was more likely to appear) and then in the savage divide yesterday I was attacked by 2 within the space of 5 minutes.
---
The three animals you have to shoot with a syringer don't work
---
If only there was a way of discovering these features before the patch went live.
---
Can confirm, tried snare drum and acoustic guitar at my camp, neither registered.
---
Also tried the snare drum at Nukashine, didn't register either.
---
Damn, all this talk about pets has me wishing they would have made a pet one of the rewards.
---
Not even a pet to protect like the ones we tame. Just a cosmetic pet that walks around base and hangs out.
---
Come one Bethesda. Make it happen!!!
---
 Its not fine and there is plenty of video evidence out there to prove it. Just because you don't experience a problem/bug doesn't mean it's not out there. 
---
And the problem is more than just vats and BGS has admitted there is an issue that they are looking into.
---
As soon as the game came out I bee lined straight to the cave to join the Enclave and missed the entire main story lol, worth it
---
This is your president John Henry Eden signing off, god bless America and the Enclave now and forever
---
I have nothing to contribute ,  but when you capitalize GOT like that I just read it as “You gave GAME OF THRONES to figure out...”
---
Chairs &gt; Anything else
---
Better than what I use to make my sausages. Here's a clue, the health inspector would gag at the sight of the ingredients.
---
Glad to hear you entitled, little lord fuckpants are getting trolled during events.
---
It did the same for me today. I cleared my Xbox cache and deleted my fo76 reserved space then after another try it let me go down the elevator.
---
A work around on here I found was to fast travel to Gauly Mine and walk to the Arktos Pharma and it should work- it’s worked for a few of us on here so far
---
So does it get better? 
---
I’m willing to give it time but riding for miles with nothing to do isn’t my idea of fun.. I can do that IRL
---
I figured it probably jus because it’s getting hammered but the last sever I was on there was literally 3 other people 2 random somewhere else and another guy try to get down we both got kicked
---
It’s always morning somewhere in the world. Shifting it to night for you inconveniences someone else in the world. Plus, I’m sure they push updates when they’re working too
---
I get that. Im mainly saying it because I follow accounts on Instagram that post pictures and people ask what it is and the people that run the accounts say it was straight up a skin before even knowing if it was or not. So this was weeks back. They have a good number of followers too so it’s kinda misleading
---
*sigh*
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’ll be having fun playing today 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Not a bad idea
---
There’s going to be 5* Legendaries, vaults will open, and the battle royale mode. I’m hoping there’s more
---
Typing on ps sucks sooo ill talk here.
---
The event is rarely started up these days, so nearly all servers will be available. We just have to kill - hop server - check computer etc. I am not sure how many people we currently have, but duoing wont be a problem.
---
... you mean I got lucky and have avoided the problem by picking the right mod to start with?
---
w00t.
---
Purveyor might hate me, but at least i have this going for me.
---
Some events/dungeons needs to be instanced as well. Anything that requires multiple high level people to complete needs to be instanced and searchable.
---
I disagree because there is only like 20 hours of content
---
Got 4 poisoner armor in one go so that suxs
---
I know I'm a bit late to this thread, but new to the game. What new quest are y'all talking about. I cant seem to find any info.
---
Here: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_(Fallout_76))
---
Try to fast travel to Gauly Mine and then walk to the Arktos Pharma and enter instead of clicking join event or fast traveling directly there - this has worked for me to be able to get in and several other people
---
Will give it ago thx
---
Nuclear winter hollotapes are in game teasers
---
But it also costs flux doesnt it?
---
I’ve had no issues, but apparently there’s a glitch where VATS isn’t working with melee. [VATS Melee Issue](https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bqwj7y/pc_vats_0_hit_chance_melee_when_youre_right_next/)
---
... queen, thats where i must have got it from...
---
woot, a place to start looking for the next 4 i need. :-)
---
Thanks.
---
What are the three locations?
---
I’ve be walking to it rather then fast travel but I’ll try different point on the map
---
Haven’t even tried yet, but I may need this. I’m level 130 rifle build. Pretty nervous. I hear it’s tough!
---
Can our youth come to you for education?
---
mole miner scrap has gears, thrash around blackwater mine for a bit.
---
Have patience and be cunning. That should help you get through the game.
---
While you are at it , atomic mining services in watoga may have some answers too.
---
Ohhhh. I know what you're talking about for that. Yeah that's annoying. Lol
---
Gotcha
---
Just be sure to only clear the reserved space not your actual game saves I’d hate to see anyone make that mistake. Best of luck !
---
Plants won’t grow, and everyone has to be a carnivore😂
---
I did it once right when servers came back. Worked fine for me
---
Did you get 3/3 though
---
I robbed 12000 screws off a guy. Is that good?
---
Completely agree; it all comes down to how many people want to do the event. If an event takes 5+ people to complete, the odds of a server having 5 interested people drops really low the older an event gets. So people who join late, leveled slower, or make a new character might not get to do these "older" events. And judging by encryptid, "older" means like 1 month. I haven't seen that event pop in a week, even with the new Possum objective. There's just no reason for a lot of people to do it anymore. 
---
Instancing this and making group finders would solve this, but I'm betting that's a huge task.
---
I just want more Ultracite skins :(
---
They arent actually good, they just have numbers and stealth boys
---
Literally everywhere in the world there are items/objects that load slowly. You may not have noticed.
---
Whitesprings robots taking 6 minutes to load, Harper's ferry terminals 2 minutes to load, if you join a new server everything can take a minute to load.
---
The game isn't optimized for online play. They took f04 and adapted it's framework to work online and with multiplayer so things lag.
---
Network lag will make objects take longer to load.
---
Even f04 had times when items and ojects didn't load if there 2as any lag in the game.
---
I got the plan as a reward one time, so it’s possible
---
Events also give region-specific outfits, faction specific outfits and plans, and have a chance at the super rare loot pool for outfits and plans for the Enclave events. Plus they give stimpacks, purified water etc.
---
I have tons of gear, I can give away a bit if you are pc player.
---
White knight was nerfed by 75% to uo sales of repair kits. You just arent informed.
---
True and they hack was getting 1 shot with an explosive handmade
---
Studleyvonshlong....🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Yes, but this time it's the worse I've seen by far.
---
Strings that were already translated are now completely wrong.
---
Bethesda really needs to streamline the translation...
---
I had been in there for about 40 minutes by the time i took these pics, if they were going to load at all they would have loaded by this point
---
Okay awesome. I'm finishing up something else, so maybe launch in like 15-20 mins so anyone else can get ready?
---
Yeah will do. The gist of my build is Strength, Charisma main for One handed melee, alchohol buffs, and healing. Then Ive got Marathoner and Moving Target level 3 for running around the battlefield reviving people. When I play in a group I normally target the mobs and focus on keeping my team alive while the rest focus the main target. I use my 15 Charisma points to share my Team Medic 3 so that anytime anyone on my team uses a stim it heals everyone within range. With my full set of life saving armor usually I dont need to be revived myself. Ive also got Butchers bounty 3 and Chemist for crafting stims and other chems. Currently have over 200 stimpaks, and thats my average.
---
You sellin’? 😬
---
You can always donate that extra $40 to the original commenter. Would be nice payment for his point completely going over your head. (Kidding, of course..)
---
Sure! :D
---
Lol happy I uninstalled this game long ago
---
Also, try getting the PS Messenger App for your phone, makes communicating on console easier 👍
---
6 in a row.
---
Well got a trouble shooter explosive handmade today been a while since I got an explosive weapon so I’m happy
---
Thanks I’ll try that out
---
I’d better point out that I’ve been playing computer games since Horace goes skiing !  ( google it )
---
So I’ve played plenty of games and RDR2 so far is the most boring game I’ve ever played
---
I love WOW automatic LFG system
---
I’m currently in the Uranium Fever event and this cunt has one shot two of the legendary mole miners so far
---
When it costs 10 dollars to get a stash box skin but wasteland workshop alone was 5 fucking dollars. Everyone complaining about decorations being expensive as fuck are well within their right.
---
Logic isn't a big deal when trying to push a narrative.
---
Been mentioning this for a while, but people don’t seem to think it’s an issue lol.
---
Keep 50 of each item.
---
Up to 100 of the rare and more used items like screws, adhesive, etc.
---
Yes. Honestly every even should be instanced so that experience and loot can be shared among participants and we can finally make support roles a viable thing. The mechanics exist, it's just pointless because of the way events are handled and loot and experience are earned. The tap system is so 1990.
---
Yeah most of what you said would be in my build,  besides the move speed stuff it honestly skipped my mind gonna have to check that out. 
---
I'm curious increasing your damage with melee increase your healing via Friendly Fire?
---
I was playing earlier and people were doing just that, staring at the thing you put the items in. It annoys me that these people can't read and use their brain. They have to wait for a tutorial and have every little thing explained to them. It's pathetic and it grinds me.
---
Yes that's exactly what he's saying. /s
---
Thanks for clearing that up. But there’s no telling at which stage the event is at before joining.
---
wat? loot is supposed to be a seperate instance per player...
---
Amen. I’m so thankful they aren’t charging for additional content like most games do. The backlash over an item that was never supposed to be free throws me off.
---
Having unprotected sex leaves you open to STD’s. Does mean you want to catch one.
---
Hold my Nuka should be the official catch phrase for all WTF difficulty stuff from now on. Can’t wait to do this event.
---
Doesn't apply to my bar set etc.
---
Its always been like that, it's not a bug. Can't recall seeing an update about that in the latest patch notes
---
No, I shared my opinion earlier and I'm not disagreeing with yours.
---
A lot of computer chair game developers in here.
---
Have they fixed the issue where if you have bulked items in your inventory, they're destroyed or disappear if you hit "Scrap All"?
---
I've been working on CST scrapping items one-by-one since I first noticed it.
---
It's really hard to find Purified Water so I love this event
---
This is not a real problem. It may be unfortunate but this how games are moving now. Idk what other games you’re playing but games in this vein often have large size patches.
---
Nuclear winter is coming?
---
**Happy NCR noises**
---
Yes, because I'm not failing the entire event because someone can't VATS target the mob and finish it before the fire goes out.  What's weak is everyone failing the event because someone is whining about crap drops from legendary mobs.
---
I want to say that there is a cat West of the Welch station by the railroad tracks. I remember there being a little shack that it lived in.
---
Whitesprings trash cans
---
Ew, logic... It’s clearly a personal attack against the players. ;)
---
Now you got me wondering what anchors the dev room itself!
---
I went in once the servers started. I was 1 of maybe 10 in there. The whole thing went way too damn quick and didnt seem like much of a challenge. I'm glad they are adding more and more stuff but I would like something worthy of a "dungeon." Still a good time with a bunch of randos tho
---
Its been 6 months. We NEED weapon skins.
---
One gauntlet prior is far better
---
I have found plasma grenade plans and other grenade plans on super mutants while farming west tek research center
---
What? You mean increase our stash size without actually having to increase it? That's way too simple. They only do crazy broken things.
---
War never changes. The first war was with clubs, the last war will be with clubs... Golf clubs.
---
Posted this elsewhere, but it bears repeating:
---
* Glow Sight is damn near must-have for this event because of the metric fuckton of glowing enemies the game throws at you.  
---
* Explosive weapons will not harm your animal buddies. Light 'em up.  
---
* Revive people. If you've got the Quack Surgeon perk, you can revive them with alcohol so you don't have to waste your precious stimpaks.  
---
* Communicate. Turn on your mic and use area chat. Let other people know what you're doing, and speak in third person, for example "Wiener is going to collect toxic sludge for the feeder".
---
There's a known plans thing? Or are you talking about the word (known) before the plan?
---
I’m happy to see that the majority of people commenting here don’t have the same attitude as the OP.
---
But usually when i use a stimpack it makes that sound that indicates a stimpack has been used. But sometimes that doesn't happen especially at low health when a lot stuff is going on. So idk it feels like a lag to me
---
There is a dead cat in that farm near the starting vault
---
To tell your own chars apart, s'about it
---
I thought everyone loved crafting ammo and modding weapons to leave and get killed because you forgot to switch your perks back??
---
Exactly why they didn’t name it death match lol
---
Ya except for the first time everytime I go in there im the first one to start it and barely anyone is around to help or high enough level.
---
Seriously though, it started off as a balance thing, but really it's just infuriatingly cumbersome to everyone.
---
I think I'm getting the salt from you. I'm not asking bethesda to do shit. I'm asking other players to join in and keep a respect level going. Go back to duping and trashing the game, some of us don't need to use the trash mechanics to feel like big boys.
---
I hit it 5 times with VATS so then the boss dropped nothing
---
It's a mask, I have it worn with my opossum hat.
---
Mask. You can equip hats though it will glitch through most
---
Actuali its the real thing in the inventory . and ye the french translation is always messed up
---
Bug.
---
I had the same, but when I decided to get cute and bulk plastic it immediately used plastic, so i went back to bulking everything else, and nope, it used plastic for bulking everything after that.
---
So the new event / mini dungeon isn't instanced? It was just like the burrows during the release day. Everyone in the server went there, killing stuffs, if you went there late there was nothing, no mobs or anything left to kill?
---
join my lobby
---
Go try and kill a blood bug in vats and lemme know how that works for ya
---
It's not a simple solution just because you call it simple.
---
Ok.... it's actually in between the Welch train station and the mount Blair train yard inside what looks like a modular home. Slightly North East of the Welch train station.
---
Mirelurks all the way down.
---
Just like the Burrows, everyone's going to swarm it for a while.  It'll die down and will take longer in the future.
---
It’s a mask - looks nice with the engineer outfit + welding helmet
---
Fun side note:  you can give people alcohol addictions with quack surgeon!
---
I just got an Arktos Lab Coat and a Bear Arm.
---
Joining you
---
Well aware of that. Just saying I believe its not worth it going through an event with the off chance I may get a 3* after taking down a boss after spending aid and ammo when youre better off just taking out normal 3* enemies. At least the blow when you dont get a 3* then doesnt hurt that bad.
---
What’s the bear arm? A weapon?
---
I’ll sell ya purified water for 10caps a piece, since it’s so hard to find
---
correct. I overlooked that most atom shop items don't
---
Damn! Sorry I missed that.
---
Yup. Looks like a bear skull for punchin'.
---
Sent
---
It needs to be in the Mire, but thank you regardless.
---
That'd invalidate the perk.
---
Ahh that’s what it was in the trailer. It’s similar to a death law gauntlet I presume?
---
No mike to talk but we need to find water I can be hurt in and then you can heal. Vice versa if I can help you with same quest
---
Could you show how it looks?
---
Whoops, sorry about the errors! I must have accidentally hit caps lock a few times, and maybe my keyboard macros were running a bit too fast. Thanks for fixing those.
---
It looks wonderful, but some of the locations have multiple encounter types overlapping, so some of them just don't show up. If I may make one final request, a completely separate map for each encounter type would make this a perfect success. I hope it's not much trouble, but I know a lot of people are really going to appreciate it. Thanks again for all the help!
---
Do they actually weigh you down or are they weightless?
---
Personally, I would use the shit out of a group finder. There's already a partial implementation that might work as a starting point - hunter/hunted radio. Tune in, group up!
---
Launching the first in 10 Minutes! 
---
Add TheGrandDuke
---
I see...Well we already knew it was some sort of arena/battle royale mode.
---
yep. takes about 5 minutes for enemies to load at arktos
---
Ahh apologies. Used to seeing “where can I find a cat” for the scout thing xD
---
Does it glitch through asylum hats?
---
I finally got it to work on my Xbox by looking at the terminal in my camp and reading about the new quest. That created a way point at the elevator. The next time I went to the elevator the game progressed as normal, it didn't crash.
---
I always say: power armor protects you from the most dangerous enemies in the game, Chairs
---
&gt;Option to 'hide' our backpacks, so they aren't seen in 3rd person (they sometimes clash with certain outfits)
---
Yes, please  
---
I often dress dapper (especially for the level up challenge) but also like to wear the duster or hunters long coat and would like it visible
---
Looks like. I had to log off, so I don't have specific numbers. It's like a whole bear skull on your arm. If I were a puncher, might be cool.
---
Was it on ps4, me and my buddy launched 3 nukes at same time on bunch of camps. Just to see what would happen
---
because sometimes when you are in the wasteland of a nuclear apocalypse, you get the slight tension of... im about to get ambushesd and really f-d in the A.
---
In regular, that feeling dies down to a very low level.
---
In survival, the butt puckering intensifies.
---
Much like how some people like really hard core survival modes in fallout 4.
---
I prefer nicer games, and would totally work the survival part differently, and not making it instant pvp or whatever, but I do understand why they did it that way.
---
Solo'd it a few times, it's way easier with less people. I'm getting the kindling and keeping the fire- at the end, I really don't care much for the 100+ who's standing there on the roof. I one shot Nia with a insta dragon on bock, done. Otherwise she regens and the I'm the fire guy on top of it all. If there's a big group, I'll run the fire and let them hose down the waves. Most don't do it for the loot, it's for badges!
---
I think they weigh .1 not sure if perks affect it or not. Weighs less than the junk I would need to carry to repair my stuff 100 times.
---
Does it reset?
---
Rockstar is often portrayed as a developer that can do no wrong, and game reviewers love them because, deep down, they wish they were art critics instead of game critics.
---
Love it keep up the good work!
---
I personally can’t stand the explosive weapons and will leave if people use them in events. It gets to the point where people are using them and I can’t see what’s going on because of the explosive effects. Unless it’s the SBQ, I think they’re overkill and more annoying than anything, especially in an inside dungeon.
---
You can teleport with vats in melee for an almost assured hit
---
upvoted. even if it is hopeless.

This has nothing to do with being able to help you...but...I just got my first explosive 2 shot smg.  I have renamed it Dihharea Cha cha cha.  Good luck on your search.
---
I sent you a friend request- borderlander321
---
Enjoy, happy to point you in the right direction! I love this community. :D
---
sorry dude im overload i cant fast travel haha im going now to place with water
---
Melee VATS VS floaty/flying mobs is still broken and deeply saddens me. 😢
---
I thought I unlocked those from finishing the new content. They're supposed to be atom store only?
---
It’s important language doesn’t fall apart because of inaccuracies but you get downvoted. Astonishing.
---
Oookay
---
I'll join you at water since I'm over loaded too
---
Same!

---
Im not sure with how Friendly Fire works. Since its a level 48 perk it was one of the last ones I got so I wasnt able to see whether healing increases with damage. Ill be testing it out with the Arktos Pharma dungeon tonight. I imagine thats how it works though.
---
I was answering his question? How is that bitching? He asked, I answered. It's the polite thing to do!
---
This perk just become about 20% cooler.
---
Platform?
---
They just have to undo the failed fix they implemented. I rather be unable to VATS scorchbeasts than everything else that flies.
---
Should be 20 hours like everything else
---
Nope trust me I always blame myself before anything but no disease. Mostly just in my base and then attempting to do the new event....which is another whole thing lol
---
I agree, I'm doing it primarily to get Possum badges, though I'm happy to get crap legendary gear to trade in for scrip, but that's just a bonus.  Still, I'm not risking failing the event because someone thinks they're entitled to a 1 star piece of garbage.
---
There's a secondary path that changes the rewards. Find quercus during the first stage of the event
---
Weird, it’s not working
---
We already had one in Nevada 😂
---
Maybe its been like this and I'm just noticing now because I'm hyper attuned to anything strange after an update.
---
Little shack on the cliff near the river in between harpers ferry and the  sheepsquash event. To find it easyly fast travel to southerb Belle Motel then from the spawn point travel directly south you’ll come straight on it
---
Scooters shack has had dead cats before. Idk if that counts. Its Neast of harpers, unmarked location.
---
Hrm... I did try the recall key card the first time but nothing happened. And I never get the notification for Encrypted or the SBQ event either. Maybe I’m glitched?
---
Xb1
---
So Bethesda just amps up the damage of basic enemies? Like the melee damage from the top level Protectron Guardian's and Assaultron's? That's really lazy.
---
Did you delete the game at any point?
---
That's not heat. That's thick, humid, choke you out weather. I hated living in SC.
---
There is a design that it looks like they are working on similar to an lfg system.
---
Couldn’t have given it protection from diseases.  That’d be pay to win doncha know 🤪
---
I experience the 0% bug a lot. It happens on flying enemies like bloodbugs and bloatflies. It's not too bad because they're not hard to kill without VATS, it's just annoying really. The other bugs I didn't experience personally but I saw a video about it.
---
Have to talk to quercus during the first stage of the event
---
You could, but you won't get the best rewards, since there are three feeder troughs you have to fill. If you can get one trough to rank 3, you get a tougher friendly animal that can survive through the three waves of animals that come afterward. The problem is, you only have a five minutes to fill the trough and it takes a significant amount of material to get the trough to rank three. You definitely want either a large group of randos or a team of people that's well coordinated. If you get all three feeders to rank three and keep all of the summoned friendly animals alive, then you have the best chance to get the best rewards from the event.
---
Sorry for late reply.
---
G2A is known to be used by identity thieves who use other people's credit cards to buy game codes and sell them on there at reduced prices.
---
My bad.
---
I confused ash pile with the mire.... LoL
---
The food news is I found the cat for another weeks challenge.
---
Last arse patch.
---
100% thought you meant as a "Use Elevator to logout. On login, you'll be inside the facility instead of outside and can continue your adventures inside immediately." Like a save your progress in a raid sort of situation. Once I saw this comment chain, I facepalmed and laughed probably harder than I would have if I got it right away. +1 to you and your great bug report.
---
Is the NCR supposed to be part of it? That would make no sense. Caesar's Legion would make way more sense.
---
so another pvp mode? damn :(
---
Bethesda comments on other things so fast but why haven’t they said anything on this 🧐
---
You know how the rumors go though.
---
Link does not work on moble
---
My toon is full strength unarmed melee. I don’t even carry a gun. I would have to pull all perks to avoid a 1 hit kill. Easier to just let the others have it. 
---
I agree that anyone there long enough to kill a few adds should get a piece of the pie.
---
Does it make anyone else honestly have an small anxiety attack? I mean Jesus fuck it literally tells you the thing is invincible 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
In my experience it's a 24hr reset, just like Pharma Farma. The Whitespring, Camden park, Watoga are all great for Can Do.
---
Do you still have the plan?
---
As I said before, love these threads you make :D
---
To help out, these need removing due to being fixed as far as I've experienced:  
---
 **Issue: Crossbow "Bolts" Cannot be interacted with in the World (Picked up, etc)**.   
---
I have *never* been able to pick up any Bolts laying around in the world until Patch 9! Now every time I see them I've been able to. You can also literally interact with the ones you're fired into surfaces, using them as steps to climb with. (Same goes for Rails shot from Railway Rifle)
---
 **Issue: Hunting Rifle .50 Cal receiver does less DMG than the .308**.  
---
This was adjusted in Patch 9, so now these receivers **do** result in higher damage. Honestly, I thought it was intended to be lower, to balance out the fact we can craft considerably more .50 cal per scrap, than .308 \*shrug\* Either way, in my experience it at least displays more damage after added to a gun (dunno if it physically does more damage).
---
My data relating to the other listed bugs:  
---
 **Issue: Gauss Rifle "Hit" Bug**.   
---
This one is a curious one, because as of at least Patch 9 I've been experiencing the OPPOSITE problem. I can barely hit a Scorchbeast to save my life when aiming, but from the hip I do fine! It's so bad for me that I've stopped aiming my Gauss and just use the crosshairs.  
---
Caveat - I'm on Mobile Broadband in a rural area with shit signal, so that could play a role, but again... it hadn't in the past. I tend to have issues hitting SB in general, but Gauss makes it *so* much worse.
---
 **Issue: Combat Knife has an "Invisible" Blade**   
---
This also is the case with Sledgehammer, allowing you to remove the mallet and have just a "Stick" to whack stuff with. 
---
Keep up the good work, and I'll gladly contribute to this cause... Time for me to make some bookmarks :)
---
Fallout has the worst fan base
---
thats what I have my excavator PA for
---
So far when ever I try to play the new update for 76 my whole internet goes kaput. Disconnects me entirely then I am back on when off of 76
---
The cooking stove is decorative. There is a plan sold by responder vendors that is another stove. That's the one you want.
---
Todd actually has nothing to do with 76.
---
Yea you broke my game.  Try to go to the new area. It just crashes to home screen on Xbox one
---
It's been 30 mins always. 
---
Yeah I remember when I first completed it, I got some thingling sense that there might be more to it even though I got the event rewards. I went to google about it, then found about the box. 
---
I think there was some on-screen notification about get your stuff, but at the same time it displayed the normal event reward thing and listed several ore as received from it. If there was a quest with marker, I didn't notice one.
---
Just like every patch. Server are stable for about an hour when they come back online, then they’ll be crashing every 15 minutes for the next two days. The problem is not the event it’s the server loading. I had no problem getting to the event early on. But when I died I lost connection every time...
---
Can someone explain the method about the horde? I was just plain confused about that one
---
Supposedly you can get them from the new event
---
Found two there! Thank you ever so much!
---
I've seen the bush brought up like 4 times now, the bug got fixed already because in all likelihood it was a very quick fix. You all make it out like they had all their resources spending the last 2 weeks trying to solve it.
---
Nope but if you have good teammates their quests will already be hidden.
---
Someone said doing hard restart of the console (where you hold the power button on the console until it shuts down) fixed it for them
---
New Vegas remake when
---
Do you need me to help you?
---
I know. I'm not really complaining. Just waiting for that dungeon that takes a whole damn server to drop lol
---
I love how if someone asks for help a bunch of players are like hell yeah I love helping out let's do this. Yes, this community kicks ass
---
Maybe it has something to do with certain lighting settings. I can't remember which ones they are, but they are identical to Fallout 4, so you can search for Fallout 4 ini settings and start from there.
---
Same.. mine has just done it 3 times in a row.. on Xbox
---
I like that you’re being told you’re demanding too much for people to read a 4th grade sentence for comprehension and then act on its small demand 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Agreed, I've done it more then once purely for the Experience and Legendaries.
---
Yes and yes. Turned up with my friends and had 6 other people turn up one event
---
New Vegas Online, because Obsidian did it better 😂😂 you just can't play for more than an hour without having to hard reset your system, just like New Vegas 😂
---
Yup same for me
---
Found two there, thank you!
---
Yeah I’ve tried all the advice I can on here still crashes I’m just gonna wander Appalachia for a day or so and hopefully it will settle down.
---
Sweet thank you now I have 2 places to check out on Friday.
---
Backtracking almost always screws something else up, especially when there have been more additions after that
---
“Sometimes it doesn’t just work”
---
-Todd Howard announcing Fallout 76
---
Mine was 5.5 ps4
---
Every time?
---
Lol
---
The creatures you have to defend regenerate between waves because of the different chemical being used
---
It would be very easy to pair the sites with a major corporation.  They are not making nearly enough money for that to be worth their time.
---
If they thought it was more profitable to do X instead of what they are doing now, that's what they'd be doing.
---
I did the event once this night morning and got nothing.  🤫
---
Got in once then froze and haven’t  made it back in yet
---
You need to spawn at a location near the Pharma such as Greg’s mine supply or gauly mine and walk to the Pharma then go down the elevator instead of joining the event directly or spawning there
---
GREAT!!! and thanks you so much for answering!
---
I'm cool with losing my topiary Deathclaw but if they touch my topiary cat I'll riot. Jk ;p
---
The cat was nice to have, but if they take it away, I'm not gonna fret. It was nice to have, but I won't be tripping over myself to get it back.
---
Are the creatures being recognized by the camera in the upper right before you take the photo?  I was able to complete this today without issue
---
As others have posted. Try cleaning your game cash not the save and reboot. Not sure if it works or not.
---
Really soory for you, for us on pc its the first sentence
---
How awesome is the bear claw? Have they added it and the sheepsquatch clubs to the legendary loot pool yet?
---
This is cool and all, but the Dark Wood had a deeper discount than this one. It also looks better IMO. Maybe a 30-50% discount would make me spend my atoms; I just don't think saving 40 atoms is worth it if since it's basically the equivalent of 4 daily challenges.
---
Oh I knew that, I meant like was it worth it to put the effort into doing it, like is there a hidden loot drop or outfit that only comes from that version of the event
---
Thanks for your help!
---
First, it was a joke. Secondly, everyone got the bushes, it just seems silly to lock it behind atoms at this point. It should have just been a freebie for all the damn glitches the past two patches.
---
It's more of a joke but yeah it'd be easy to follow a paper trail if this was the case.
---
Probably because it’s quite easy to troll other players and intentionally place them in a trap if with that mat, or allow you to exploit geometry to get into locations you shouldn’t be able to get into
---
Wood can have shrouded mod for the legs which makes you sneak faster, but that’s the only reason some people use it as it has pitiful defense. I go 4 unyielding and 1 chameleon for stealth and that’s prob the best loadout unless you wanna rock full weightless or bolstering or something.
---
Odd, I play ps4 too but dont have this I don't believe
---
Yes, as stated in the post they are indeed identified. Maybe it’s a system thing. What do you play on?
---
Less damage than a deathclaw gauntlet, can't be legendary afaik
---
Left a downvote to prove this man's point
---
I love RDR2. I also love Fallout 76. They came out fairly close together, and I would play both almost daily.
---
They're not really similar games, so it's hard to compare. The story of RDR2 is amazing and kept me coming back, but Fallout is my go-to when I have friends online. 
---
I know RDR2 is slow at first, but if stick with it a little more. Once the world opens up and you can explore and do whatever you please, things get a lot better.
---
But also don't leave Fallout. We need you!
---
Happy to help! 👍😋
---
You folks are all awesome, thank you again.
---
Did the encryptid once, it was a pain in the ass and no one knew what they were doing. Imposter dropped a fucking drill...not even a legendary. Just. A. Drill. No interest in ever doing that event again.
---
I can make cores with ~120% condition (both plasma and fusion). For fusion, it states the condition as 120/100 when I select it in inventory, but the plasma cores only show the condition bar, no values.
---
Donnie you are out of your element!
---
Cool not sure if I'll be on tonight, game is still copying and it's getting late but I'll be kn tomorrow
---
 Chameleon on armour is real good. I have 2 bits and they lose track of me easily.
---
Not possible solo I’m my opinion just because of the time limit and the amount of enemies. I have no doubt I could survive solo but seriously doubt I could complete the objective in time by myself even at lvl 308 with top tier gear.
---
Hey Now.
---
You spent them?
---
Welcome to the new arms race. Forget nukes modern weapons that deal death from afar the new race is all "up in your face and if you don't agree with my boys , well here's you clue bat upside your noggin."
---
/S
---
To me I'll sit back and watch all the hooligans run around braining each other, till one steps in my property, them it's the boom stick-o-heavenly light and justice. That put another trespasser on the ground.
---
Have fun storming the castle if your fellow man with his buddies thigh as your weapon.
---
Ran across this today. Name was phunny something or other. Was at their vending machines and all of a sudden i hear this racket. Exit the screen and see a row of flamers going off and some rad emmiters and a closed door behind me. Not sure what that whole setup was supposed to do because I just stood there and didnt take any damage.
---
Absolutely not 😃
---
I REALLY don’t like fighting those high-level cloaking assautrons at all. But if Bethesda ever allowed us a companion in the game, bet your ass who I’d pick. :)
---
The last time I did it I was tanking 2 pylons because nobody else would take them. When I died another player hovered over me for 30 seconds and didn't stim me because he wanted to steal my loot. Maybe he didn't realize that I was the guy carrying everyone?
---
I'm done with that event.
---
Is it still bugged after today's update? They really need to get their shit together with all these bugged challenges, including the ones still bugged since BETA!
---
Didn’t think so 😂
---
God just thinking about that scummy shit makes me so mad 😡 I may need to go slaughter the white one server with my premium repair kits 🧨
---
I don't exactly have a build, I just put in the perks to what I need at the moment switch between some perks at times. I do use lever action rifle (not sure what category it would count as.) and heavy melee, more specifically, Grognak's Axe. I use my auto handmade rifle sometimes, depending on if I have enough 5.56 ammo. I typically use power armor and use light armor when I'm out of fusion cores.
---
Any idea when we could be seeing a fix for the crashes caused by lock picking?
---
Nuka tapper and all the stuff on the tables on the way out. Nap is nice, but get going, it's a huge world ot there. Check dead bodies for 1st weapons.
---
yeah its broken, i too have tried to stay positive, but melee is broken, building camps has become super irritating since the last patch. the ratio of bad days to good is quickly becoming skewed.
---
As of right now I think you’re out of luck; join the chorus calling for fast travel mats.
---
Easily my favourite review of Red Dead 2. Thank you. 😂
---
I thought the nuclear winter was gonna be a harder version of adventure mode, like you also need to sleep, no fast travel, and more diseases, and to top it all, an actual nuclear winter, snow and more radiation pools in the map (it could be lore friendly since the ATLAS program thingy) 
---
but everything datamined so far implies it’s just a BR mode and the other two vaults being a raid-like activity.
---
wasted potential imo, I don’t get why they think a BR mode would be something the player base wants, PvP is the weakest thing about the game by a landslide :/
---
I definitely will!
---
Not a lore expert, just played the game a bunch.
---
There's two radioactive craters in the savage divide that suggest a couple of nukes hit.
---
Everything south of the Charleston dam is wrecked because the dam was destroyed by raiders. It's done really well and you can visually trace the destruction, debris and sediments downstream (on two forks of where the river used to be).
---
The toxic valley is from the toxic waste that had been dumped in the lake overflowing, in combination with geyers suggesting some kind of reaction with volcanic hotspots.
---
The ash heap has been contaminated by the Hornwright 'air purifiers' and the coal mine fires.
---
The Mire is a result of a GECK going awry causing the crazy vine growths and either a natural or beaver log dam above Southern Belle Motel which is why it's so swampy.
---
Monongah has some destuction from a massive rockslide from the cliff above it. Thid is also done well, I actually pretty much stumbled onto this when I thought 'why is there a gigantic boulder in this house' and traced it back to where it split and destroyed another house, then up the hill with more boulder fragments and obliterated trees up to the cliffside it had started from.
---
Cranberry bog is because it was already a bog (ala real West Virginia
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Glades), combined with either GECK or FEV mutating the glades, plus more beaverification.
---
Thank you :)
---
The easiest way would be to make a new character because its pretty much guaranteed you'll get it first quest. Either that or the white fire helmet I need in my life, supposedly 😂
---
Thing to renember when it comes to bugs.  When they're dealing with thousands of lines of code, it does take a bit of time getting them removed.
---
The vast majority of perma bans are for duping. If it's not that, then it's some form of harassment.
---
Well, I for one want the new weapons added. They should have been on the list when they were introduced.
---
Yea there is there is. They just look like a dome. With a crack going thru it. Domes are around the launch sites.
---
I believe they'll always spawn wherever you originally placed your CAMP down at and you yourself always seem to spawn like a tad bit north of where you place yours. I think the only way I found a fix for it was to move my camp and try to place it in a new spot and try to place my entire camp back down again
---
Might be in the purveyor pool, who knows
---
Lucky me lmao
---
As of right now no. It is dependent on where you first placed you camp. My question why lock the doors at all I can partially understand locking resources but no one can steal your furniture.
---
Two-shot, faster reload and +10 while aiming
---
Your welcome chris !
---
That was beautiful, what poem was that from?
---
Or it was easy to fix and people just have a cognitive bias.
---
Ok but if the group fixing bugs is bing overwhelmed by new work constantly appearing and the teams pushing out new content can’t release it without it oh idk crashing on fast travel... then there is a problem.
---
I guess because it’s a jabbing weapon not a swinging weapon, and apparently one can’t jab in PA. But yeah, that sucks.
---
8 attempts to enter,  8 hard crashes.  Xbox1
---
Nice thourough explanation thanks. I just recently started paying more attention to the lore of 76 and this is good. I'll be checking out these sites.
---
And holy shit they nailed the Cranberry Bog. Thanks for the link. 👍👍
---
Pay to win. People could make more turrets for their camps.
---
Thank you, that’s exactly what I thought about doing eventually... but since I’ve built my whole CAMP around an extractor (merged in concrete), I’m sure I could never place it down where it should be.. I’d have to start over
---
Fingerprint any legendary \*\* or \*\*\*. Weekly wipe any instance of an identified duped weapon by it's fingerprint.  This would wipe out the market for these asshats. 
---
At least 60% of the player base uses some type OP duped gear, most of them knowingly ignorant, some truly innocent.  BSG is stuck and they don't know how to fix this. Probably too late. Cheating has become institutionalized when more that half the player base uses duped gear. Nerfing is the only thing they can come up with.
---
This has not worked for me, nor has clearing cache.
---
Hmmm you know I wonder if you get the liquor buff from what is used on you.  I doubt it....  but can you imagine reviving people with nukashine bwhahaha.
---
I thought this was a set up to a joke, I’m sad now.
---
If they could set a hard limit on turrets, would you support it?
---
Almost as good as giving your hard earned scrip into the vendor, getting a 3 star piece (wood...) and then finding it's turned to 1 star on the next login. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Online validation probably
---
Isn’t that kind of the case now?   I mean players are complaining about not having time to even get a hit in.
---
You need (random) people to help :)
---
I love the fingerprinting idea!!
---
If this is a valid reason to report them, I hope you did. Hate people like that.
---
Same here, on Xbox.
---
Thank you. I did see that in a separate post.
---
Attitude
---
Yeah it’s lag this guy is just salty about something I guess
---
Awe man I wish I saw that sooner. I bought the Dark wood one yesterday.
---
I tried it solo earlier. Died and failed. Too many things trying to kill you.
---
Beach boys?
---
I was 2/3 pylons for most of an event last night. No one rezzed me. We totally failed. Sigh.
---
Again they don’t even understand what you’re saying lol
---
That's always a possibility. This point does seem to be bought up each update, but I'm comfortable with it, not many places you can't find water of some description or meat piles.....
---
It's a better day tripper with added hit chance
---
What the hell is a toon? Do you mean character?
---
Nothing’s locked, it’s just a room containing the extractor and water purifiers, to protect it and also to make sure I can get some when I come back. I’ve been leaving my ressources accessible forever until now. My front door is opened, I’m gladly welcoming anyone into my home. :)
---
Some “complaints” are upvoted enough that the developers see them. They don’t necessarily fix them, lol....but they see them none-the-less.
---
So delete the post then...
---
as far as results go.. most of the time it doesnt seem like there is much difference
---
Actually they acknowledged it but said it wasn't done in time to get out with this half a patch. So it will be in next full patch.  Today was basically just new event and a couple of minor bug fixes that couldn't be fit into  the Patch 9.
---
I mean isn’t there anything else that would effect it like Ram?
---
Yeah i think so as well
---
Well, I dunno about *that*...
---
Patch notes implied that doing it as a Tadpole would occasionally yield Possum badges. Which I can confirm that did happen, as I have 2 Possum badges just from Campfire Tales event.
---
How do you explain this patch saying 61.63 GB required to update on my PC version? HWAT?!
---
Not yet. But I'm wondering what the reward is since they said it would be worth it
---
Yes. Good. Great (take your time, don't rush linear objective). Getting better, probably a lot better by the time you get there. Nope, never actually was, just a lot of people talking that weren't actually regular players.
---
Honestly, You'll either love it or hate it but if you try to take your time and enjoy it for what it is instead of trying to rush up levels and just quick complete like it's a standard Beth solo grind, you'll miss what makes this special.
---
It depends upon how spaghetti the code is, but basic version control software usually manages this for you very easily.
---
Sorry you said small locked room I thought you meant the door was locked.
---
Cause its the mob mentality and folks can’t use their brain and think for themself.
---
I upvoted btw. 😉
---
I still don’t know bcuz people said I’ll keep my Bethesda account and I won’t.
---
Well, that makes perfect sense for an online multiplayer game.
---
There are Spears ?
---
I’ll chat over mic if others are, but I mostly mute it. I swear too much when I’m playing, and I talk to myself too much.
---
What's the task ?
---
Bethesda’s coding is, worrying at times. Last time they backtracked they fucked up other things and it took them a little while just to get back to where they were
---
Thanks! I’m a HUGE Fallout fan and online seems so so very appealing!
---
Totally agree red dead 2 was the worst 60 bucks I spent in a long time and I bought anthem....
---
The story line might be good but the game play sucks...
---
It's a glorified hunting/fishing simulator...
---
I've fallen asleep while playing it because of how long it takes to ride your horse places. 
---
I honestly think that if it wasnt a rockstar game it would of been destroyed by game review outlets. 
---
For the life of me I can't understand why people defend and love that game and dont even get me started on the online "beta" what a joke.
---
The funny part is that at no point was it called a raid. Neither of these things were called a raid. You’re just a fool.
---
Reporting it might actually get it fixed? 
---
The way i see it, the more details you can provide the developers with, the better the odds of properly identifying the root cause and coding in a solution. 
---
Just complaining about it doesn't really give them much to work with other than venting and  spreading negativity.
---
 I highly doubt they have someone combing through reddit looking for bug reports. At best, if your post gets enough attention by the community, maybe they will notice it as well.
---
Nope, the improved kits are actually better than the ones in the shop. 
---
But the ones in the shop still shouldn't exist.
---
Oh alright, good to know thank you. Are you referring to just the Pioneer challenges when you mention they acknowledged it or also the old challenges that to this day since release/beta are still bugged? Like visiting certain locations on the map not counting even though I have them already. 
---
I was also hoping today they'd bring the display cases out, but like you said, it's half a patch. Maybe next week.
---
There is base building but much of it feels locked behind a grind. The gameplay is very much like fo4 but again 100% based on grinding as stories are boring with no NPCs. The early game is best, past level 50 it's all grind. The end game is all grind. I was pro 76 at launch and haven't played for a month because I was tired of needing to grind and have basically 1 of 3 characters (bloodied melee build, explosive rifle build, or ASS/SEN armor build) to make the game worth playing. It's meh. If you came here for anything but constant repetition and grind over and over for days to get 1 thing you can use to keep grinding you'll be bummed.
---
I mean handy for you, I think the closest wall-mart to me is...two hours drive?
---
Well it’s locked my a powered door! But my initial idea was that player could visit my CAMP but not that small room where my extractor and water purifiers are. I liked the idea of hiding those! But I also thought I could leave the powered door open whenever I’m not short on those materials.
---
might be so common that they'd lose a significant number of their OG player base
---
If you can find a friend or two, it's even better mid game. But currently for new players those of us who have been around since beta are usually pretty good about helping out new players get geared up or whatever. 
---
Take a look at some of the newbie threads and find some of the regular drop locations too. Flatwoods is usually good for this.
---
That sucks... I got legacy power armor sprays n items.
---
I got i9 9900k nvme Samsung 970 32gb ram and 2060gtx
---
I've hated this since they added it. Admittedly, the weapons are never worth worrying about in my opinion. The one I managed to get, ((from the Adventure Mode bug.)) I ended up scrapping for Script. But non PvP players deserve something as well.
---
Bring friends.
---
And a shit ton of stimpacks and ammo.
---
Know that feeling all to well. Got a couple of really good wood pieces out of the vendor. I knew theyd tank when I relogged so I had to scrap them to atleast get max scrip.
---
Screw that. I one shot with a bolt action pipe rifle.
---
No, developers need to make it so if you spawn into where a foundation is, it pops you up on top of the foundation. Or provide a /stuck command. Like _just about_ every other game where this is a concern. 
---
Players shouldn't have to do _shit_ about this.
---
Rng. Just did a whitesprings run with 5 legendaries. 2 were 3star but gave crap.
---
So basically Elder Scrolls Online’s Cyrodiil
---
There is base building unlocked by doing main quest missions for the C.A.M.P. The gunplay and overall game is almost exactly Fallout 4. Early game is fun but trudges a bit at around the 20's, then it picks back up in the 30's (Do not be afraid of nuke zones, etc. just because you are underleveled. I did them in my 30's and had a blast as a solo player). Endgame is kind of boring right now but is picking up with the new content they are adding and min-maxing a character is pretty easy to do (trade for legendaries do not farm for them). The game is a lot better than reviewers have said, and, while not being the best, is fun nonetheless. Overall get a few friends and just play the game. Do what YOU want to do, you don't have to meet others status quo to have fun.
---
Doesn't spawn (at least no one has posted that they found one outside of a vendor). 
---
Vendor only. Player or Vendor bot.
---
And if someone spent the 8000+caps... Don't expect it to be sold for less. Unless you get really, really lucky.
---
You can get enough caps for it in a week. Charisma, bloodied build on low health (raises all specials but end) and grape mentats can bring the price down but it'll still be 7800+.
---
PS4
---
I’ve completed it 3 times and all I got was a lab coat. Not worth it so far.
---
I thought it was only around 800 caps though,  [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_Handmade\_Gun](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Handmade_Gun)
---
Bruh i already out and waiting. Sorry. No smokes.
---
I’m still looking for unstoppables 1 and 4, for the collector challenge. Found 4 twice in vendor machines,  but never in the wild.
---
Anyone else got the \[Arktos Pharma Backpack?\]([https://imgur.com/a/OxEjvkJ](https://imgur.com/a/OxEjvkJ))
---
I did it solo, but was only able to save one animal and was only able to get it to rank 2 and I got crap rewards.
---
Yes please ! There's a lot of cool weapons who didn't get any skins... (Handmade, combat rifle, some heavy weapons etc)
---
How did this baffling confused response get upvoted?
---
Stimpak diffuser is still nowhere to be seen. 
---
Thanks Bethesda. Oh and Roddy Toddy Howard.
---
Completed it once tonight, was a Grafton Monster, got the lab coat.
---
I thought they were a gift to celebrate player vending... Cat was my fren
---
It's frustrating to my friends and I that we have to cripple ourselves to be good neighbors during brand-new events. We tend to simply not join events if low-levels are already there, and we try to shoulder-butt instead of shoot if we have to, but come on--if you had put time time and effort into a character since the beta, would t you like to actually play during new content? 
---
And it's not like our OP selves aren't "appreciated" by the low-levels who show up to tag and hide during the SBQ and Encryptid fights.
---
This problem isn't caused by high-level players. Everyone in an event should be able to loot legendaries, period.
---
Damn. Me too. Guess I’m just lucky
---
Yeah I got the Yao Guai to register but the wolf doesn't.
---
Yes... as the patch notes said... he’s talking PC right now...
---
Time, effort, ammo, repair costs, meds, and possible failure of the event. These are all things AFKers take away from people doing the event.
---
Hijacking what the other good person said, taking your time is a great way to experience it, at least in my style of playing. Only level 68 and I have plenty to do and with the new updates it's just getting better. 
---
So yeah, it can be a grind, hell, most games are now, but it's a fun grind I think. 
---
I may have been lucky too, but all the people I've encountered online there have been very friendly and helpful.
---
Samsies
---
Didn't say it is a big thing. But want to prevent folks spoiled by accident you know?
---
There are players which want to discover and get surprised.
---
Adds?
---
This is mixed. 
---
I've got the full intended price when listing ammo for 1cap each.
---
I've seen my son get nothing when selling 5k ammo at 1 cap each 
---
It's hit and miss.
---
When you come here to complain, there's a almost zero chance that someone will read about your problem and something will get fixed.   
---
If you report a bug, some fucking idiot will tell you that the game's crashing because you're not running it as administrator, or that your head's disappeared because your CPU is 5% under spec.   
---
I've given up, the reporting system is \_garbage\_. I don't personally know anyone who's actually gotten any actual help out of it.
---
What kind of creatures do you go against?
---
God roll role playing melee weapons.  Lead pipes, golf clubs, spears.  You name a gimpy melee weapon and I’ve gotten incredible rolls on it.  Anti armor swing speed lead pipe.  Instigating swing speed spear.  Etcetc.
---
I did like the zealot swing speed pole hook though, so I can’t complain too much.
---
I also get medic and vats related heavy weapons nonstop.  I can’t imagine people use heavy weaps + vats so they get shredded.
---
Uh, why are you giving them asspats and demands for DLC when the game still has major components, like friends list and rendering, borked?
---
Slow your roll.
---
More RAM will help, as would a good video card and fast CPU. But only a little, compared to SSD vs HDD. If you're not planning to use a SSD, you probably won't see much improvement in load times vs console.
---
Not at all
---
also is the level cap on the plans gone, you had to be between level 15 and 20 to get the plans from the free state vendors or watoga vendors
---
I don't personally want the button layout changed. Seems like a big change for such a minor inconvenience. But yeah, I share your frustration
---
this quest is ridiculous. several times now i get to the fill the troughs part and simply nothing spawns in, no possible way to fill the troughs when that happens. i wish i was one of the people who this is working perfectly for, some claim its very fun and gives great loot. i havent experienced anything but problems. i think today is a write off. i'll try again tomorrow.
---
this game has more expensive skins than virtually any other game, we should worry how “challenging” recoloring a few guns
---
Pcmr? Why should anyone?
---
also is the level cap on the plans gone, you had to be between level 15 and 20 to get the plans from the free state and watoga vendors
---
also is the level cap on the plans gone, you had to be between level 15 and 20 to get the plans from the free state vendors or watoga vendors, and yes i mean the plans
---
yup, they removed it when they gave the vendors set inventories.
---
Yup, my friends and I maxed out the venison one only and we got a glowing deathclaw as our friendly animal.
---
Yeah. Every time so far. You need 3 people IMO to 3/3 one Hanitat effectively. Always had Glowing Deathclaw Lv91 and get to kill an Alpha Sheepsquatch Lv100
---
Over 200+ hours i still have quest to do. Cause i take my time
---
That is the born survivor perk. Serendipity is a chance to dodge at low health.
---
Maybe eliminate the trade option until events are complete?
---
I have gotten all but 2 of the PVP weapons since Beta started.
---
I do not use any of them.  The only one that I keep on me is the lever action for when I am killing low end ghouls inside somewhere where my explosive guns would hurt myself.
---
The Action Hero is a really nice 50cal if you dont have a better Heavy already, but other than that, most of them are easily replaceable especially since the purveyor is now in play.
---
This is almost certainly server lag not a damage bug.
---
I have given around 80 stimpacks and water over the past 2 weeks to low levels
---
did you get a stimpak diffuser? I finished one and got ammo and a baseball grenade.
---
Niiiiiiice
---
Presentation!
---
All it does is make my game crash
---
get onto server, wait ten minutes. then fast travel to both mines on either side of arktos. after getting to the second mine walk to arktos on foot. but it seems if you dont let the entire game load every asset and then stop struggling before you go in it is a guaranteed crash. on xbox anyway.
---
There’s two waves that have just about anything, from blood bugs to sting wings to snallyghasters and more. He last wave has an “alpha” lvl 100 3* boss mob. I’ve had a fog crawler, sheepsquatch, and a grafting monster so far for the boss mob.
---
For atleast 5 patches now this has been the case
---
Yeah there’s a lot of that! Bug or not still frustrating and visually it looks the same as the damage bug from pre-December which is why I brought it up
---
I'm about level 140 and still have a lot to discover in this game. At times I've enjoyed it immensely other times I wanted to choke the crap out of it, but remember it's just a game.
---
Thanks for the insight and your input well said
---
probably not, this event is more crap
---
If the youtubers are explaining in great detail the duping methods and admitting to duping themselves they should have thier accounts banned for enabling this.
---
Been meaning to try that hunter/ hunted radio, how is it? Worthwhile?
---
I see what you mean, its missing animations in the PA
---
So fucking true
---
I had 4 ransoms and I working on one to get the 2/3 haha. I need to find a more coordinated group to play it with.
---
Yes I think it's got the highest base damage for a 2 handed melee weapon
---
Lol, just got sucked back into this game with all the great updates, then log in excited to play and it reminds me of release with the crashes. All said it’s trending in the right direction but this is really disappointing.
---
As someone who prides themself on not spending money on games past the store or dlc I still think its unfair to people who just cant afford it. Maybe if they made it available for atoms. I'm still weary on that though because I could see it being used as a currency drain so that people waste their atoms to where they have to buy more atoms to get decorative items.
---
I just started a new character and we are about the same level, roll with me. Psn is MyLittleShadow
---
So I assume 60 gets it to 3/3?
---
That's nice. I do not care. Those are things I am willing to invest in getting good loot. In fact so long as the leechers are polite and don't interfere I may actually get warm fuzzies from the (involuntary) charity aspect of the whole thing.
---
Sounds hard, what are the rewards?
---
I wish there was something to do with burnt books. Like a 1% chance they turn into a highly valuable “pre-war book” that you could turn in to a library protectron, or like that they would turn into readable books like in the elder scrolls games. Imagine accident picking up a burnt book but in the corner of your screen it says “Lusty argonian maid acquired” best Easter egg ever.
---
Okay Gandalf, keep your secrets ;)
---
To be fair the event is over pretty quick. Maybe took 10 mins or so to complete.
---
The cards like rifleman/expert rifleman/master rifleman are set up for the perk sharing system and for apparent diminishing returns
---
Haven’t seen it yet, it’d make sense to get it from here though.
---
Its just weird to not have them at all. They've been a staple since game one (before, counting Wasteland).
---
Uhh ones a grumble bee and the others a bumble bee? Idk this jokes terrible i have nothing to work with!
---
I’ve picked it up from the free states vendor at level 16. I don’t know if you can get it earlier but you can’t craft any below level 15 anyway. And I’m pretty sure about the price.
---
Tbf this has been debated since Fallout 3 came out (which was initally going to take place 20yrs after the bombs but changed late in devlopment, which is why everythi g really looks so crapsack).
---
I subscribe to the theory that all survivors are so busy 12 hours a day trying to get by that cleaning is a pointless endevour, espeically when the next bunch of Raiders/crazed synths/super mutants/radroaches etc come along and reset all your progress to zero. It's also why I think alot of the interiors in Diamond City and Megaton are relatively clean too. Just no-one has the time/care for the public realm.
---
This argument is stupid, for a couple reasons. 
---
First, servers are (pretty much) localized globally. You're not connecting to a server in Sweden when  you're sitting in a beach hut in California. You're connecting to a server somewhere in California. 
---
So yes, it is entirely possible to have a roll out wave that has servers down _IN YOUR TIME ZONE_ in the middle of the night. This is pretty trivial. 
---
Second, even if "somewhere in the world" arguments held true, they do the server updates at about 9AM for Bethesda's local time zone. Which is super convenient for employees, but pretty crap for everyone else.
---
I said so we don’t need to swap to craft for 4 seconds then swap back. Salty salty salty
---
Added
---
Add another one to the tally. I'm on Xbox and froze, crashed or got booted to the menu maybe 8 or 10 times - each time during the elevator entry -  before I finally managed to get in.
---
I haven’t got anything good yet. Got a couple 5.56 rounds and a single stimpack. Also got an Arktos Labcoat, probably will end up selling it.
---
Yup! The venison one and that one with the plant seem to be easiest. But yeah, I definitely think having a big coordinated group can get 3/3, around 18 people, 6 per each habitat.
---
tl:dr does this event give any rewards?
---
I'm more a fan of real fake doors myself.
---
So pay extra to use a system you already paid full price to be able to use? 
---
I agree it needs more space but paying extra for a feature that is central to the entire game? It's focus is being you and making the game your own.
---
I would walk away from fallout for that.
---
Well servant boy, make haste and tell Godd Howard already!
---
Yes they just have to holster their weapon before fast traveling to your base. It's on them if your turrets kill them.
---
This hasn't been true for more than a month now. You have a set limit on turrets.
---
Are you mad that people are upset they don't get to play the new content because it's broken for them? Get a fucking grip bud.
---
Agree, if its been a few minutes and noone else taking towers other than me i will bounce. Not going to waste stims. 
---
Same goes for blowing all ammo on sbq, its pretty obvious after five min if sqb is going to have a chance to ne cleared.
---
What’s this about a weekly gun? I must have missed the patch note whenever it came out
---
Ha.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Ive done the event like 7xs with absolutely no problems and i have shit internet with like 4 other things running on wifi... Maybe its you and not the game... Maybe... Just a little bit???
---
Which, I assume, is affecting Swing Speed
---
It’s quite OP at early levels (I made one at level 16 on my latest play through) so while I couldn’t always use it it was an excellent gun when things got sticky. I think I crafted 600 bullets before I made it in anticipation, but it is hungry.
---
Awesome idea. I still want my years supply of Nuka-Cola &amp; Sugar Bombs thought!
---
&gt;It growls when you swing it
---
Well fuck, now I have to have it.
---
Additional enemies that spawn during the fight. If people get too focused on taking down the boss and ignore adds, you can get overwhelmed very quickly.
---
I don’t disagree it’s absolutely embarrassing for bgs
---
I tried the kelp and it doesn’t spawn very fast at all. Only managed to get 26 the entire round.
---
Ah. Additional, adds. Not familiar with the terms
---
Well maybe that could cool vending machine item, that you build in your CAMP and gives you a free nuka-cola once every day
---
To shreds you say
---
Yeah but I still came back to the game and am replaying everything on a new character every day
---
I just jump on a tower and shoot the bots for xp and loot at the end so I still get a lot out of it.
---
I want to say my shotgun on my alt is very similar to that. Had people try to buy it off me unsolicited one too many times at this point. I'd take another in a heartbeat.
---
I'd be 100% for being able to purchase a larger budget exclusively for cosmetic items.  They already have water production (functionally) limited. Turrets are hard-limited.  If they hard-limited production from grown crops to something reasonable so you can't make massive produce farms for crafting/selling,  I'd be completely in favor.
---
Haha it’s the thought that counts!
---
Was in their event for the first time.
---
Learned the mechanics fairly quickly.
---
Not so much for the other guys.
---
Because QA picks up a Teddy Bear inside their private test cell and calls it long a day of testing.
---
I'm on PC and I crash every 5-10 minutes, and I haven't even gotten close to the new content yet. They broke something pretty fucking bad with this one.
---
Most of them are smart about it. They explain the dupe in detail but do not show it or admit to duping. Additionally they avoid showing their login name in the videos.
---
Well I certainly stay away from pvp. I really can’t understand enjoying it. Not conceptually, but it’s so poorly balanced and utterly broken programmatically that I actually cannot enjoy it.
---
Someone datamined her potential inventory last week. Unless it was added in today's patch there's no legendary bear arm or shepherd's crooks. :(
---
Even if this does work, you need a lot of people who all know to do this same thing to also do it so you can actually complete it. Otherwise it's just used to farm the few legendaries you might find down there in the beginning and rise/repeat.
---
Yet no stash limit increase...please for the love GOD increase the stash box. Vending and playing would greatly benefit from it. I want to delete my storage character which holds all my legendaries.
---
Honestly had zero issues on x1 been playing since it went live
---
That’s why I’ve been trying to spread the word as much as I can to help people. It’s not a 100% fix as it isn’t working for everyone but if I can help a few people I’m gonna try
---
Go to Arktos Pharma. Go infront door. Look for elevator. Enter elevator and push button. The event will start when the door opens. If it doesn't, it means someone recently did it and it's on cooldown. Server hop or come back later.
---
You sure? I have 2x kidneys I don't really need.
---
I felt the same way ab RDR2 at first and I just beat it last night and at the end of chapter 2 the game picks up and it actually gets really good. Chapter 2 is just boring bc it is a fishing/hunting sim. After chapter 2 tho it stops being that and starting being an actual good game
---
I don’t think we have enough of an explanation for the condition of TV.  White powder death from industry, sure.  The steam vents though... I’m thinking whatever area feeds into this zone is or is near an actual glowing sea style nuke zone.
---
I’ve been server hopping - I was just having the crash issue earlier
---
Overkill? My TSE handmade has the *weakest* output damage of my kit. Plus just use the splash damage to tag enemies.   
---
Can't help ya on the effect, but at least my handmade isn't an end-all-be-all gun its my tagger.
---
 Listen to the podcast here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ffKrbGSXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ffKrbGSXU)
---
Most freaking definitely.
---
No problem. It seems that legendary spawns have either a bad, good, or great seed. I have found that a server with low to no legendaries at a location will have the same at other locations. The opposite is true as well. If I find a server where one location is hot I will try other locations on the same server.
---
I got a 2 star forest scout leg from either the burrows or golf club. Can’t remember which. 
---
Sorry this is a little vague but in answer to your question, yes it seems to be on the loot table for enemies now.
---
Hope this helps you a little.
---
It depends, I think regular mobs are fair game, it's really difficult to not one shot them with certain builds, you literally need to shoot on the ground so your explosive effect tags them, its bothersome. Even my Auto Tesla gun one shots things like mole miners, ghouls and insects.
---
I've done the campfire event about 10 times, I think I've managed to tag the legendary that spawns probably twice. It's level 20 it just evaporates if you sneeze on it, it can't be helped.
---
For things like One Violent Night I make extra special care to only tag the wendigo and then just wait for others to kill it. Same for AWOL Armaments.
---
Sheepquatch and Imposter is fine, even the best characters can't kill them quickly.
---
There aren't really any other events that matter tbh
---
After the initial hate storm everyone is so black and white on this game.  You either have to blindly hate everything or blindly love everything.  You can't just make valid criticisms or valid praise without being labeled either a troll or a sheep.
---
The big thing for me is they just released new content (possum badges) that can't be completed (I still have plenty of other uncompletable challenges from the base game).  EVERY other game I've ever played if the developer made a mistake that prevented players from getting rewards they'd 1) fix it very fast, 2) give an actual apology for fucking up, 3) likely give you some free currency, a skin, or some trinket to make it up to their customers.  Since this game has had bugs since launch Bethesda seems to have just settled into, "Oh well it's fucked up, just deal with it".  I love this game (300+ hours), but we all have to say continuing to release broken and uncompletable content is unacceptable.
---
Giving the stuff away for free in the atom shop even if it's just a limited time promotion would have been a very nice and appropriate thing to do.  I don't know why everyone is jumping down you're throat.  I don't care about either item.  But just the gesture of "We're sorry, here's something for the trouble" would be much appreciated.
---
Food is pretty much 3 tier. +1 str +2str +3str ect.
---
Most of the+2 recipes require more actual food and most of the +3 recipes require salt/pepper/sugar/spices.
---
Few exceptions to this but thats mostly how it works.
---
You're doing gods work, I just wish Bethesda was too
---
Over 700 hrs and I routinely still find (mostly small) areas , little plots on holotapes or written note, or unique spots. I found a wired spot just this morning; a small pond with a broken dock that has its own locked door, surrounded by(defensive?)long pikes...
---
'Speak Celsius motherfucker!'
---
It looks really nice with the imposter  sheepsquatch helmet and the bos hood.
---
I know :( I’ve had so many random crashes - crash when my friend fast travels to me - crash when a random attempted to trade with me - random crash while fighting x x I’ve had more crashes today than I did in the beta
---
I have come to the same realization recently. I have played survival exclusively and the sheer quantity of bullshit was ruining my fun. So I went back to adventure mode yesterday and decided it wasn’t worth it. 
---
Also in survival, any time a nuke is dropped the server instantly crashes and kicks everyone on detonation. I don’t know if survival has always been like that but it has happened to me 10+ times in the last week
---
I'd rather they fix the bugs than try and revamp survival. Yes it's fun, not as rewarding as promised but then if they wanted it to work you would have to start brand new toons first with no crossover. But to each their own. Let's let Beth keep the game on the tracks for the rest of the major year ipdates and see what they so for balance issues at the same time
---
It certainly does.
---
Up vs down votes.
---
I still don't understand why people get all upset over dupers. There is no competitive part to this game. It's basically a farming simulator at this point. How exactly are these people hurting you?
---
I've been picking them up off and on here recently - nothing to really look at twice yet though as it was all 1 star 'so-so' stuff (IE damage against animals).
---
That's one count of being a bear... and one count of being an accessory to being a bear.
---
I personally don't even get 5 minutes in the game in general.
---
I mean, did you actually expect something different? I mean, really?
---
Enclave bunker also tons of trash cans
---
Thank you and the other Bethesda guys/gals on here for actively making fo76 a better game every day! You guys truest are an awesome dev team.
---
Yep, I literally have 2 cooking stove plans, the issue is that it shows as known so I can’t learn it, when I try to use it in the work shop, it says I need to get the plans, when I try to use the plans, it shows as known...  
---
So just to clarify, the issue here isn’t that I haven’t found the plans, they just won’t work.  Buying the atomic skin was to just see if it would re jig it.
---
Is this weeks any good?
---
Musician: Use musical instruments: None of the 3 working still after today's patch. 
---
Musician: Play instruments at locations: None of the 3 working still. 
---
Chemist: Shoot with syringer: None of the 3 working.
---
Dunno know if this is my luck or new bugs.
---
Chemist: Trick or Treat quest with Jack will not spawn to create pumpkin grenades.
---
Cook: Scorchbeasts don't drop meat anymore. Killed 7 yesterday wasted tons of ammo nothing from them. Cant craft the cranberry meatball grinder without it.
---
Leatherworker: Death claws not dropping hide same as scorchbeasts with the meat. 
---
Entomologist: Haven't seen a mothman to save my life. 
---
Collector: Unstoppables 1,2 and 4 will not spawn I farm mags regularly I have collected several hundred these issues have not spawned for me as I still need them for the world challenge to collect issues.
---
Musician: One violent night not spawning.
---
As of patch frog habitat works.
---
This happens pretty much every update. Some of us have game breaking bugs, complain about it, get insulted and downvoted for it, because...I don't even know.   
---
It's worth checking to see if you have a custom.ini anyway, because even if you don't run mods, sometimes one's generated, and it can break all sorts of shit.
---
I know the game has gotten boring at this point but your time could be better spent than policing how other people play.
---
Horse shit. I've gotten "Hey, anyone else having X problem" get NOTHING but nuke bombed and insults before.
---
Couldn’t agree more it’s a nightmarish pvp experience.
---
Just lock the purifiers and unlock the door.
---
Weird it’s been more than 24 hours
---
Yea this sounds like fun! Would love too hop on with some friends and goof around while making nuka-cola’s!
---
Any raider underarmor (road leathers, harness, raider leathers or long johns) with shielded upgrade for +3 extra Agi (and +3Per, +1Lck) which affects sneak. Armor pieces you wear on top of underarmor can be modded with various things that affect sneak (for example shadowed mod and ones that reduce weight, there are ones for every armor type). Armor weight also affects sneak skill, so less weight the better. Also few legendary effects give bonuses (Weightless, Chameleon, Cloaking and ones that have extra Agi ofc).
---
I'm just throwing a random guess. Could it be that you have to take a photo of a subject(with right corner name)?
---
I was bulking gears the other day and noticed I was bulking but the materials were not subtracting for the gears. So I bulked until I ran out of plastic. Had 20 bulk gears and still had the same loose gears. Tried to replicate after I got more plastic but it didn't work again
---
Why is my download saying its 61.63 GB......
---
First online game?
---
Very cool, thank you!
---
Welp with this new update I can't play the game no matter what I spawn and fall through the world. Did a complete uninstall and reinstall and still falling.
---
”Dont use certain guns because i think they are annoying”
---
Fallout 4 is always there for you
---
No. Ad hom attacks are attempting to discredit your argument by calling your qualifications into question. Insults are separate from that.
---
"Asking someone if they know the backstory and lore to a game," implies that they are not qualified to have the discussion, which you only turned to when you were blown the fuck out and had no response to my point directly.
---
In short, you are an entire galaxy of wrong on a lot of things and you aren't nearly as smart as you believe you are.
---
Pretty much this, sounds like a reasonable idea as long as it can’t be abused and as mentioned, the pre existing caps on water, turrets etc should stop it from being abused. 👍
---
agree, terrible.
---
I’ve found the quests so esoteric lately that I can’t do any of them. So I’ve gotten to the point where I may not even check to see what they are. So I could easily walk past you cause I didn’t know I could get atoms.
---
Can’t do it in adventure this week I take it?
---
Usually people either don't notice the challenges because they don't check, or they refuse to do them because it takes a little bit more effort
---
Whitesprings have gotten wild man, 8 out of 10 runs yeild 1 or 2 junk legendaries. The other 2 drop 3-4 2 or 3* junk.
---
I have server hopped WS hard, every since patch 9 it hasn't spawned worth a shit. Even when nuked it still holds alot back.
---
You can still get your daily scrip off a nuked WS tho.
---
Interesting, very good to know! Nice to know the name for the wood mod!
---
It's absolutely mind-numbing that all the feedback we get on camp size is a bar...and it's iffy. I've scrapped several smaller things before I've been able to place other small things before.   
---
Then again, I've scrapped items and then been unable to place \_that exact item\_ again.
---
If i have more than 7 minutes, i can usually clear it solo.
---
Was his apartment rent controlled?
---
Dailies are different for everyone in my experience
---
I’ve got a question then! I forgot to search the answer since patch 9. If someone unlocks something in my CAMP and becomes wanted, we’re not automatically set into PVP? So my base doesn’t become vulnerable if someone steals from locked ressources?
---
This! Just completed
---
I'd like it if items in vending machines didn't use up our stash space
---
Alright I'll have to do that tomorrow - just gotta weed the errors out of the other files too
---
I ignore them - most consume enough time that it’s all I’d be able to do in my gaming session.
---
I use them occasionally but rarely chase them, in all honesty whenever an item I want is released I just buy atoms for it.
---
OP: “Salty Meat?”
---
Bethesda: “2000 Atoms”
---
Yeah toon = character.  I've seen that terminology used in a few different MMORPGs.
---
exquige you? We all bought the game didn't we? The decorations were unlocked didn't we? I thought it was a gift. Snatched right out of my hands. "Asking for something for nothing." We already got it for nothing and then they were like LOL no.
---
Or they're just boring and the stuff on offer isn't worth the leg work? 
---
I mean I literally have no incentive to do them, and I've still got a cache of Atoms just in waiting earned while ignoring the dailies...
---
So far ive gotten in 1 time but i had to leave and snag my power armor.  every time since its crashed though.
---
they should change the explosives damage because my explosives character relies only on grenades and missiles
---
Nah. I think the trolls were lying about that shit too.
---
No, there was a problem recently if you build into like a broken building or under a bridge your wouldn't be able to put down items like chairs, and what you did put down would clip into the ceiling.
---
Agree.
---
Add me, I'm down to run it. 
---
Psn: Crimsonkingpiasa
---
I found the plans in a box at the ss quest pylon site
---
I dont but my buddies are builders so they chase everyone. I usually end up helping so got so many atoms idk what to do with them.
---
You can add me and message me when you see me on patchymccurdy
---
I’ve had a SheepSquatch
---
Those little rectangular yellow bits of floor trash that look like bullets or something else you can pick up, so you do a very quick double take every time before remembering
---
If it helps fast travel away then back it always works for me that way
---
Is there a reason things would not glow orange? I ask because I tried it once and didn't notice any glow effect on the radstags that gave venison.
---
Try to invite as many people hope your teammates get a hit
---
I try to do all the challenges daily. I've just about never randomly come across a player for the picture challenges though. I've always needed to organize it for these specific outfit/weapon/location picture challenges. 
---
The 1 time I had someone whip out a camera was just after the queen event when I was waving around a chainsaw during the nighttime for that picture of a player with a chainsaw at night challenge.
---
Atom challenges and events need some revamps. Atom challenges need to stop being aimed towards the camera which sort of fell flat on its face and Events need to be giving out more incentivizing rewards beyond the caps you spent to get there and some random aid items that stopped being useful thirty or so levels ago
---
I just don't lock anything no one can really steal anything. But if you wanna lock stuff that's fine I would do like TECHNIC said above me.
---
Lmao! That made my day, thanks again!
---
I've never even checked. I don't ever spend any atoms. Only ones I get are by just playing. Mostly the Level up one that randomly pops up.
---
No! Not my deathclaw hedges
---
On the one hand: very frustrating. On the other: Survival mode.
---
You get what you pay for.
---
Yeah or beating the alcohol crafting system right to death. Real creative n such.
---
What kind of syringer did you use to get that? I wore one down with a regular syringer for fifteen minutes till it was about 5% health left and then some asshole passed by and "helped me out" by finishing it with a regular weapon and I didn't get the credit.
---
This could possibly be why.  Lately they have been along the lines of "kill 5 Scorched glowing albino Megasloths in the Forest," so I have been skipping them.
---
ok im level 19, hope I can get it, Ive already visited Harpers ferry and most of watoga too.
---
the problem is that legendary effects are mods. the same as recievers, and other weapon and armor mods you craft.
---
the problem is that legendary effects are mods. the same as receivers, and other weapon and armor mods you craft.weapon, and when the game loads them it discards the mods that don't fit into any available slots.
---
I've played since beta.
---
I've seen 1.
---
I was under the impression they were the same for everyone.  If they are different that certainly adds a little spice to them.
---
+1 for Xbox.
---
The varying ones at whitesprings usually have at least one set
---
1% chance to win perfectly preserved pie
---
If you need someone to pose for pictures and assuming I have the gear I'd be happy to help.  I'm on Xbox
---
It crippled it once and when it regened I crippled it again.
---
Then I brought out my trusty tse gating and lit it up.
---
Storms are so rare and random for me
---
Here you get down voted. Everything else is pretty much the same.
---
not anymore, theyre too stupid to bother with.
---

They mentioned pioneer challenges
---
It could help if Bethesda would consider everyone in the event together as tagging the legendary for loot. "But wut about the leechers that will sit in the event and not do anything?" Maybe make it so that you have to at least be helping in the event even if it is just you having killed a few trash mobs. I'm not saying it's a great solution but I would rather that compromise than so many people missing out on a big part of the gear game.
---
Same. I’m crashing from things that haven’t caused a crash in weeks or months. One example is west tek, that place would cause crashes pretty often but it seems like it’s been fixed for at least a few weeks or more. Now today alone Ive crashed there twice. Typical one step forward, three steps back.
---
Honestly, this game has one of the best weapon designs. They are crazy but not anime.
---
I play stealth characters in every Fallout game. This one is the worst of them all. The "Hidden" to "Danger" because I switched my weapons is at the top of the list. It's been that way since a few updates ago.
---
It’s easier to pick up in Whitesprings! But good luck. It’s a fantastic weapon to get early. You’ll need three ranks of gunsmith too.
---
I loved it so much, you inspired me to try my own creation. It isn't great, but...it is what it is: 
---
I hate Rose. I'm not that keen on the Free States either. I keep following quest markers with no idea why. I might skip them next time.
---
True. But do you really need that lvl 10 1* sickle?
---
Theyve always been the same amongst the people I play with.
---
why are you rageposting about dying in survival? duh.
---
Probably because you’re not level 50+.
---
lol Ok. Let's go with *your* definition of ad hominem, for now.
---
Explain to me how saying I am a "daft cunt" doesn't call my "qualifications" into question. You are saying I am unintelligent. That I am *not qualified* to have a position. So. By your own definition an ad hominem.
---
Paying attention?
---
Now what about when you called me a "useless mongrel". Ignoring the obvious racist overtones of addressing a person as a mongrel. You're still attacking my qualifications. By saying I am "useless" you're saying I don't have a useful purpose, and therefore, don't have a useful opinion. Once again. Ad hominem.
---
Still paying attention?
---
What about mungbean? Apparently this is a reference to intelligence again. As well as a lack of substance. So, again, attacking my qualifications as being unintelligent and lacking substance. Ad hominem.
---
Are you learning yet?
---
Of course. All this precludes the fact that you are entirely wrong. Ad hominem's include attacks on a persons characteristics. All of which your comments obviously live up too. You attacked my character through attacking my intelligence, saying that I am useless, and of no substance.
---
Ad hominems.
---
Now. For the second, or third, or whatever time now. Asking if someone knows the backstory and lore to a game implies nothing. It asks a question. I don't know the level of your knowledge about Fallout. As I said. Lots of people play games and enjoy them without knowing the backstory or lore. There is nothing implied there. If *you* decide to take it as an insult, that doesn't make it an ad hominem. It's just you finding something to be "outraged" about because you had no actual argument.
---
And, you can keep saying I was "blown the fuck out" all you want. Doesn't make it true. I've responded to your point. Several times now. You're the one who is off track and insists on staying off track. Not me.
---
In short. Your last point is also an ad hominem.
---
Didn't you say something that *implied* you were done with this conversation?
---
Same, I just joined them. I think you only need it for BoS.
---
I'd drop 2000 atoms for a full set of matching 'rifle' skins
---
This doesn’t make any sense. I will definitely keep it in mind from now on. Thanks!
---
I got it down to 5% then finished it off with the Syringer. Took me 4 tries as other things kept getting in the way or getting the last hit in. I tried the Philippi Battlefield Cemetery as that one isnt too high level but ended up doing one of them at Dolly Sods. Kept hiding in the cabin and running out to do pot shots. Still took forever.
---
The reward scales with the number of surviving animals, not the type of animal.

First MMO style online game yes. I've never seen one that looked good before 76 was announced.
---
However the amount of upvotes though unexpected and greatly appreciated for the visibility says I'm not the only one who's concerned by this or wants more info.
---
I think it depends what you are looking for in a game. RDR2 is definitely more about exploration and story telling. The traveling, while sometimes tedious is apart of the experience. The first few hours are by far the slowest part of the game. Especially the intro in the snow. The biggest thing for me in RDR2 was how many different encounters and random events there are. It makes the traveling from one side of the map to the other a little more exciting. You dont know if a rival gang is going to pop out and ambush you or youll run across some stranger got their leg stuck in a bear trap. A couple tips to make it a little more exciting. 
---
-Make sure you hit up those train stations so you can unlock fast traveling.
---
-never pay off your bounty. It makes fast traveling more difficult, but keeps the game interesting and more immersive. Wont spoil any of the main story, but its fun having bounty hunters always on your tail and makes things a little more exciting.
---
-hold select to go into cinematic mode while riding a horse. Your horse will follow the road and go max speed without dropping the stamina. Id do this, and turn those long treks into smoke breaks lol
---
Or have a crafting perk that adds condition to the food like weapon artisan does for weapons.
---
FO76 had a fantastic, in depth story that takes weeks to fully uncover. It's in the forms of holotapes, notes, dead bodies and left behind robots. The Colonel Holotapes in flatwoods and the notes in the funeral home there brought me to tears.
---
On XB1 you can press Y on the first connector to start the attach wire but then you can press A to actually attached it instead of Y again. I don't know why this works but I just put a whole bunch of through wall connectors and conduit, redoing all my electric wire yesterday, and it worked great.
---
You really think RDR2 is worse than Anthem?
---
The event is new people myself included don't know what to do ok chill.
---
More like "Take a Camera Picture of a Player in an Unstoppables Costume next to 5 Scorched Glowing Albino Megasloths while naked and intoxicated in a nuke zone"
---
How many friendly animals survived?
---
Sure am! I'm mad about grips and doo-doo for coa-coa puffs, nerd. Bethesda should set up a donation box for abandoned games. Donations can go towards the arc the rest of us ride on to drift through the sea of wahhh-meee posts. Oh, the content I contributed neither soutions or money toward doesnt work! There's a pothole on my road! DEAR LORD BABY JESUS TAKE ME FROM THIS THIRD WORLD HELLHOLE!
---
Only one bear arm? Guess they didn't find the whole bill of rights yet, it clearly states you can have two or more.
---
Same for me. If you hit a few and get nothing, hop.
---
I have not, not even sure where to go next to start completing it, never pops.
---
Thanks for the info, I will look for this tonight.
---
Circle back to where I said that would invalidate a perk. Food is in abundance, you really don't need more.
---
what that person said\^\^
---
So much salt in this thread. It blows my mind. I can take a good hearted ribbing and don't mind giving one. But some of these people ... how does someone get so offended by jokes about the platform they play on? Who gives a shit? lol upvote for you.
---
Sincerely,
---
Someone else who can take a joke.
---
It's my understanding her story isn't over yet. More to come in future dlc.
---
Spoiler space for the noobs.
---
Apparently it's not finished. The belief is that she'll show up in a later dlc. Probably to tear us a new hole for popping off more nukes. D'oh!
---
fuck the bags FUCK THE BAGS!
---
Ya, too bad from what I've read people just show up to take your junk bag and tag the legendary. We need instanced events and the ability to kick players who don't contribute from them.
---
I believe this method doesn't work with mods that tweaks models?
---
I did, and this guy seem to find me anyway, I am on the Xbox platform. I  have blocked him for session and lodged a complaint as well, with Bethesda and Xbox. And he finds me, he starts messaging me telling me how much I  need him on my team, and I am letting him down. I responded the first few times and say sorry dude not intrested right now. And then he keeps sending me party invite, after party invite, this goes on for hours some times. I am a very outgoing person, I have no problem helping others out, but this guy has some issues. Lol. I am waiting for him to show up to my front door of my house, or wake up with some dude standing over me with a knife. Lol. Demanding my attention to play with him. Lol.

Two

It looks pretty good. My camp is mostly topiary cats....
---
Even if the name was displayed. Doesn't matter if they say the ban is over anecdotal evidence. People will believe the youtubers over Beth....
---
It was... nothing special
---
It always at harpers
---
The atom shop
---
I used to love it there now I barely go..even for blast zones
---
Free or no?
---
I can confirm that the german translation is also messed up lol. Whitespring gouls with wrong and strange names, my camera is titled as a flamer mod and the opossum tasks are nearly all converted into mod names and undoable in this state:-)
---
Desperate need? Sounds like you'll buy it at a high price. Unfortunately a PC user.
---
500 atoms
---
ideally, chameleon mutation with a set of 3\* weightless shadowed ultra-light combat/marine armor, with AP refresh and 20% reductions you want. 
---
Baring that any set of legendary armor with effects you want and shadowed.
---
Looks cool man. Did u fit much inside?
---
THE 4:82000 fix - lmao
---
What, like, power suit cores? You need flux for making those.. it doesn't give flux does it?
---
Huh. Didn't know that. what if someone approaches my CAMP from the wild?
---
I honestly dont care much about survival. I'd just like to see weapon balance.
---
I did, and still kind of do. The new patch came out and I was able to put everything back where it was. However, I feel like the tunnel I use for the base has stretched out because it doesn't fit the same.
---
Taming is already available
---
I used to to do them every day I played. First thing I did was check out the dailies and try to plan my session around knocking them off first.
---
I don't now, cause they are unbelievably tedious, and impossible to do unless you have friends to help you out (I don't have friends lol).
---
So Bethesda won...they made the daily allowance of 50 or so atoms extremely difficult to obtain while simultaneously releasing some of the coolest stuff in their atom shop, which will lead more people to buy atoms.
---
From a marketing perspective, it's genius.
---
From a players perspective, it blows.
---
Sounds good, no rush!  But if it saves you any time, maybe you could just split the one you already fixed into 4. Whitespring_Assault would be included in the regular Assault map, by the way. 
---
On a side note, would you mind if I tried getting in touch with some people about putting out some custom in-game map mods with your work?
---
They should just make it where if you are in an event you get loot got what other people in the event kill, kinda like being on a team. You already cant pvp in them so it shouldnt be that big of a stretch.
---
That IS a fun side note
---
I'm surprised not only why they aren't cracking down on these online shops, but they could easily take down these videos also that promote cheating. It says so directly in their TOS. Bethesda at this point aren't even enforcing their Zenimax TOS.
---
Gross. Looks like I'm not getting it😂
---
The amount of scrap it generate is not worth the time to defend it.
---
Oh shit, im stoked
---
Someone has actually already done that! Can't remember the name now, but search the comments
---
No thanks. I'll keep my non-troll PC community.
---
A team of legit just trolls who exploit to destroy camps and stuff
---
Silo Alpha is east of Site Alpha, Silo Bravo is south of Site Bravo. Not sure where Charlie is.
---
Few of them may be but a majority must be the same or we wouldn't see these "Can I photo somebody in XXXXX at XXXXX" or the inverse "I'm Wearing XXXXX at XXXXX come and take a photo!"
---
Haha brilliant! I love how the body literally just looks like a normal house
---
Explosive plans can spawn randomnly in the yellow explosive crates, green ammo crates, duffle bags, and steamer trunks. Once you get out of the forest it doesn't matter which type or which area. The container being locked increases the odds of finding a plan, even if another player unlocked it before you ever loaded the area on your system. Hope this helps! Also, if you're missing any chem plans, they can spawn in anything that can be looted by Pharma Farma. Food plans can spawn in anything that can be looted by Can Do. The perks will not generate plans, but the containers may hold them, and again the container having a "locked" tag increases the quality of the loot table.
---
Haha, I should've figured they did! Thanks, I'll check it out
---
I used to , until I started seeing take a picture of a player doing this or wearing that or the one with leveling up, at my level , doing this is a feat and don’t feel like going trough 10 minutes of loading screens just for a 10 cent reward...
---
It is actually respawning inside during the event. When the event ends you’ll be force to respawn elsewhere. I died 3 times during the event and always respawned in the animal laboratory
---
Because you need to defend it?
---
Please , pro tip wait until event pops and fast travel from outside arkos, avoid double loading screen
---
Uhh.  No console.  PC.
---
Holy shit, i never knew this!! Thank you so much!
---
Imagine that feeling after every patch and you see that popup - must be frustrating... till some day you finally get why it might pop up and never get fixed 😂
---
The savage divide is also where I ended up finally getting my Responder Fireman Outfit.
---
Tood Howard experience.
---
why? I thought the dev room is only a representation/collection of the items in-game and not the source/database of them?
---
Tough and probably not %100 complete solo. You have to fill three hoppers, defend three critters, and do so in wildly different locations that are not in LOS. Might be doable, but I suspect you won't get a %100 complete on it without a LOT of luck and repetition.
---
Just keep hackin and whackin and smackin...
---
This may not be what happened, but in the past I told MWR to cancel updating and somehow cancel updating means uninstall all 80GB.
---
I liked red dead 2 a lot but its no fallout.
---
If they were there how come they was not crouching? if you crouch it takes your character off the game map.
---
It works for me every time. I think it's an network or isp problem that you guys are having conflicting with the update or something. It's not like this is happening to everyone but I'm sure Bethesda will fix it soon.
---
I have a friend who has gotten 2 raider armor plans and a heavy metal armor plan from the Mr. Messenger events. He said it's the only one he's ever gotten to drop them, and he had to run hundreds to get the 3 he has.
---
I assume you mean the riot armor from new Vegas. Really good shout, this is the loophole for getting ncr ranger armor in 76.
---
Maybe this will explain why my camp (southeast of Arktos) keeps crashing? 
---
I’m fine anywhere else pretty much, but I keep crashing at my camp.
---
You're fine man I forgot to mention I'm Xbox One S
---
I use too. Would get 2-3 done a day. since the biv update i dont bother checking much anymore. I have over 5000 atoms nothing is worth using them on and the effort required on some of these for just 10 atoms isnt worth it. Im still trying to find a cat to photograph i dont have time to find a user named Cat wearing a cowboy outfit while being well tuned in a nuke zone as a SBQ and SB hit her with a sonice and acid attack.
---
It’s out now so go get it!!!
---
Green thumb and butchers bounty have 0 effect.
---
Got a bunch today all good
---
They claimed today's would be under 1GB for PC, most people are reporting 8.5GB and  I've read at least one that got hammered with a fat 60GB download. 
---
There shouldn't be any inconsistencies, but there are. 
---
Probably not a relevant example, but a few years ago RB6 cranked out a huge update but in doing so was able to reduce the sizes of the updates thereafter. Ubi doesn't exactly have the best reputation but I think they've done really well with Siege. Was also kind of interesting to see they had to remove a character and two items recently due to exploits (was kind of like a "76 isn't the only one!" moment).
---
Nope:(
---
Still cool
---
I think the server population is much much smaller. I always see the same players on Xbox time and again, especially the PvP focused ones.
---
First time I ever checked achievements was when I had to see what was needed for the tadpole stuff. Honestly didn't even know the menu was there and I'm lvl ~105
---
But you can only use it on one hand.
---
Just some lighting and the basics, bed, workshop, etc
---
My names all match the character. 
---
Fire Marshal Bill for the firebreather 2 handed melee character. 
---
Snake Eyes for what's essentially a male Mistress of Mystery character with stealth, an auto pistol, and sword.
---
Pandora for my no crafting scavenger with all the search a container for more stuff perks.
---
I don’t think it’s a guaranteed unlock everytime you scrap, isn’t it only a percentage chance? And where did you find the mod? I’d be happy with that
---
