Also no atom shop skinned ones
---
---
---
Whatever, It's all splitting hairs. Less human than a Super Mutant, more human than a Snallygaster. Happy? I bow down to your knowledge oh might lore-master
---
Heh,I am only able to get 16 with a vamp fist. Serious resist on that dude.
---
I think thay if three nukes are launched they should convert into one mega nuke
---
So they both have a skull... so what?
---
Ok well it should work, assuming ps5 backwards comparability works with 76
---
Congrats üëè
---

---
I'm only like 60 ranks behind you
---
Scorch Beast Queen
---
Yeah but...i am not good at this game. I like it...but not good. üòÅ
---
Do the effects come back if you take the skin off?
---
Alright now do u think i should build there or do u need more detail like places
---
You can buy all his bullion in one day or go back each day and get more if you want. I get it all at once so I don‚Äôt have to remember to go back each day.
---
Really? 
---
Ha!
---
They clearly both have the skull of the other person.
---
Literally years
---
Yay, I don‚Äôt as bad now
---
Wish I could take credit for it.
---
The same thing you are always supposed to do... play the game because you enjoy playing the game.
---
It makes sense to have a level requirement since you're capped to 8 players. Imagine a lowbie taking a spot of a higher level player that could contribute more...
---
Thanks I just wanted to make sure he won't just up and leave after my first purchase
---
That sucks, you will get it next time
---
Thanks, I just wanted to make sure I don't waste any money buying another copy if it won't work
---
Those doing the PTS are likely more experienced players who know that an ‚Äúend game event‚Äù is not the place for characters below level 50.
---
That said,  Bethesda May have left the event open like this to accommodate ‚ÄúOne Wasteland‚Äù which should allow lower level players to help.
---
This literally just happened to me on Xbox. He mutated, then disappeared and all the wendigos stop spawning
---
Even if you buy it all he‚Äôll still be there. You just won‚Äôt be able to talk to him till the weekly reset.
---
I‚Äôll trade whole outfit and backpack plan for tenderizer plan.
---
It's hard trying to complete two season passes at the same time. At one point I was actually considering buying ¬£80 worth of atoms to get the rewards, but the more I look at the rewards the more I think 'meh, next seasons are better'.
---
I am going to try to get to rank 62 for the ghillie scout armour and that would be me done and happy.
---
Apparently if you hit the queen monongah triggers anyway.
---
 Shoulda played Benny hill over your Mike.
---
Yes that is a thing that can happen
---
I know. And everyone said they cannot fast travel out. I only got out using my last vintage nukashine
---
[removed]
---
I wouldn't mind some clean cloths. I'm able to fabricate a plasma gatling gun but not a washing machine haha.
---
A few good things to combo together are...
---
Raider skinner hood
---
Raider nomad outfit
---
And Plague doctor mask, it looks pretty cool if you‚Äôre going for a more raider look
---
They should add a chest outside if that happens where the loot will spawn inside the chest, that will help
---
Yeah it‚Äôs weird. At one point he completely disappeared underground, and then a couple minutes later his head was barely above ground
---
Yeah, but what was Bethesda thinking with that challenge? More like, "I have no life at all, just fallout challenge". 
---
It's impossible to play 7600 hours=317 days of gaming. Even 760 hours=760 atoms could be more understandable.
---
This, protip is to use your brain instead of just bitching for an easy to solve problem
---
You must have been on a private team. Public teams don't let people build in your camp, I think. Also are you on PC?
---
Oh. Good thing I don‚Äôt have that problem, I would of missed the cookout lol
---
It‚Äôs fine by me if they‚Äôre afk on a drum or cooking spit, sometimes these afk people are more usefull than live players
---
Has there been a FO1st bonus yet or any mention of when its coming out? I may have lost track of time but i feel like something should have dropped by now?
---
That isn't a build choice unless you always keep crafting perks equipped.
---
Either no-one on board has made an mmo before and if they have they surely aren't now.
---
I went in with 4 other people and got stuck fighting the damn thing alone, TWICE. This is just badly planed as usual.
---
So I will be able to see them somehow before repairing?
---
I‚Äôve only been getting bloody chefs outfits and meat cleaver plans
---
Beth should implement an event list that‚Äôs currently going on at that time in each region. The camera should move on the map to see the location and players in the event.
---
People are silly
---
Here's a solution. If you're like.. level 50 or below, you're put into a seperate instance levels like.. 35-50, then from like 51-75 we'll day get their own instance thats slightly stronger, then from 76+ heh, you get the level 110 earle.
---
How is that okay?
---
In my PC experience, the high levels players able to carry a low player thru it easy enough. we run there with a level 21 (if i remember correctly) and we didn't have much problems taking it down.  
---
tho i do tend to run into magic weapons a lot too, so that's also that side of it. Don't know if consoles just don't have the same level of players who can kill it solo in a minute or two.
---
From the last month every time it loads my character I can rear it getting over-encumbered, get back to normal, get over-encumbered again, than my character appears and I see it adding "paper targets", and a pop-up with a quest (don't even known which) note "when you open the letter you see..."
---
It feels like they do everything based on scripts that are applied one over another...
---
https://youtu.be/xnF-wmAliXM
---
&gt;To me calling people toxic that make use of normal in game mechanics are actually the toxic ones
---
This statement is absolutely correct! And it applies to anything. Not just in the game but through life.
---
I have it because xbox game pass and I'm really enjoying it.
---
[deleted]
---
Yep. Submit a ticket. Usually they refund and you keep the items.
---
It's easy to make a mistake on the shop. But I asked for a refund for an item that has a known fault. I didn't know when I bought it. They refunded. I kept the item. I don't even use it. üòÇ
---
For real, can we just get some actual wasteland-y looking shit? All of the cartoony goofy stuff gets old really quick.
---
Yep. Go back to running your wasteland coffee shop or trying to be photomode expert or whatever it is you "serious" roleplayers do in this game.
---
OK so I level 30 something now. I have not been playing long. I‚Äôd join a Scorched Earth event on a  Whim just to see what is was all about and after the Rads killed me numerous times felt like a heal as I bailed out of the game.
---
I do try to help when ever I join so I do generally try to follow the level recommendations. I do think at a minimum that should be listed on the colossal problem.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a mix of yes and no, you came to the right place.
---
So basiclly what the start up quest that all of us high level had to do gotcha
---
What do you think? Know anything about it?
---
Go for all 5 Vanguards. Not sure what the DR/ER is on anything but scout armor. 
---
The diminishing returns deal can be dealt with. Use healing factor mutation, max out ironclad and use junk shield (optional). I think evasive also raises DR. 
---
I have gotten my DR/ER up to 650+. But it'll drop to a flat 575 if I take damage or acquire rads. But I also use Thorn armor. 
---
The only difference I have noticed with this is I take a shit ton of rads. Which can be dealt with by stacking radshield. And it doesn't prevent stagger.
---
it's fine. it's a bit gloomy in certain places but nice in others. You will just have slightly tougher enemies turning up that if you were say in the forest.
---
I just use them to complete those dailes/weeklies.  I claimed all 10 on the same server today to knock out that weekly.  The only one I have left is level up.
---
That is an excellent idea
---
Thats been out. Google and YouTube has it.
---
Alright no problem, I would have been happy to help. Good luck
---
Yea but tbf Fallout 4 enemies feel more dangerous to compensate 
---
At least it seems that way to me whenever I go back to it after playing fo76
---
The tent is a 1st skin for the survival tent, and the backpack is a separate item, very deceptive marketing...
---
Have to say, im level 170ish right now, and i only hit the wendigos with about 22 points each time. Tiny little jabs. Ill kill the spawns in a couple shots, but the big guy just doesnt get hurt from my weapons. Dont always blame the level, I know I have to figure out where the slack is in my attack, but for now im no better than the lowbies.
---
yes but that's visible to someone like me, when you claim a workshop and are never seen there again it's clear that you did that for the challenge.  
---
Easy way to find out if someone like that wants to fight is claim it while they aren't there, when they come to defend they want to fight, if they dont show up they don't. :)
---
Thing is the they mention repair perks in the title but then talk about the durability perks. So yeah. Build.
---
There were a few sought after plans.  I think the fact that they were so hard to get made it more exciting when you did hear that Treasure sound.  Hoping this would be the one.
---
I‚Äôve tried it both ways and I don‚Äôt think it works. Try it out on line in the sand. With it on or off it takes a few shots to tag all the enemies.
---
If you're on pc I would give you a good trade for that, depending on what you're looking for
---
yeah i don't roleplay.  illleave that to you console peasants
---
The fight has so much RNG. Falling burning amber, feared into drill, capable team mates, and whether or not it's gonna glitch through the floor/ceiling and risk running the time limit. :/
---
Fun when the stars align though!
---
Ahhh well that would make sense then but it would be less confusing then if they indicated that in some way. Thank you for clearing that up for me.
---
Most people who play 76 are precious fallout series expats. They are used to playing an RPG game where they can throttle the difficulty to match their play style and life. Most aren't PvP fps types. It throws them off and they don't quite understand why it's happening when it does. Especially those who didn't start with beta and are coming on board now. The game was initially billed as a PvP type game and had more mechanics now it's a complete surprise when they are taking a workshop and have their face melted.
---
This is just the sort of thing I was looking for! Thanks so much. :)
---
That greenhouse build set level, though... Oof. I was hoping to pass on much of the grind this time, and while that seems like the thing that could be added for bullion at Foundation, I'm not sure I want to risk it.
---
Thank you!
---
If that is the case, they should be refunding those daily challenges for atoms instead. 150-300 sounds about right
---
How do you milsim an arcade game? It's not like ArmA.
---
Then at the highest tier you get a greater chance at 3 star legendaries so you arent cheated out of an easier experience.
---
I mainly join Colossal Problem because it's a guranteed two legendary drops every time it's finished. Now if you've been through the hell of farming legendaries, 6 legendaries (3 nukes per world, 2 per event completion) is a great way for a post-wastelanders/MSQ player to get geared for harder content.
---
Nice!! I've got a decent junkies and an armor penetration one atm
---
Curious which one will be more effective whenever the patch hits 
---
I've really been hoping to grab a good shishkebab with the swing speed effect, for epic fire heals, but alas rng blesses me in many ways but not that one
---
Oh great more rude people
---
Xbox.  I think you are right on that.  Thinking back to last night I had a low level send me a team invite that I took.  I didn't think anything about it and logged off after doing a meat cook.
---
That is the only time I've teamed in a private group since public groups started that I recall and the timing fits.
---
its nice for me to get a week when you don't want to spend 1000 atoms for some bundle
---
probable i grab the plushie or the emote xd
---
Oh my bad
---
Is the minimum damage bar referring to if you get rewards or not?
---
worst is when you click to fast travel and it doesn't so you have to run stop try again and it if doesn't run some more till you find a spot that lets you fast travel
---
At least before the last patch it would definitely increase the radius but I havent used in over a month or so. I usef it for destroying the mainframe in silos and I could easily tell the difference with and without it.
---
It's just like 4. Tons of reused assets from 4 and the same playstyle. So if you thought 4 was "eh" you are getting more of the same.
---
I am on PlayStation and I have seen the event pop up once since it was released.
---
Ok thank u
---
Just wait till a lvl 5 Liberator destroys your entire base from half a mile away.
---
Clear out the middle floor of Top of the World. When I kill everything and pick everything up I make over 1000+ caps easy for 15 min of effort.
---
Yes I saw you said you are basically out of ammo. Kill a few scorched with bash if you have to and use the weapons+ammo they drop. Repeat until you kill them all.
---
It's like a milsim in a fallouty type of way, it's not tactical or anything, it's a militia that's supposed to protect a town type of thing, if that makes any sense
---
I complained about the cosmetics getting a little whacky a while ago, and people came to defend them saying ‚ÄúWell there is something for everyone! Stop complaining!‚Äù And now here we are...
---
I recommended a skin like the Appalachian Trailblazer Achievement icon, it looks really badass and what I personally think should have been the Veteran Outfit.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work when the event is packed. I tried this on pc and still couldn‚Äôt select the event icon.
---
Sure you don't.
---
Hey hey hey what about b2525 fixer or handmade lol
---
i am a relatively knew player too. And i can read the very obvious message that shows up when you claim something, it says that you might engange in pvp by claiming that. So there is absolutely no way that they couldnt now.   
---
I am level 290 now and i only attack people above level 100. When i notice the person doesnt have very good guns yet i will also use less "clappy" guns to make it fair.   
---
At the end of the day pvp is for fun and i have a good laugh in good pvp. I dont understand where this saltyness comes from.
---
Anyone actually finish the grognak game?
---
How is it deceptive, if you read the description it tells you what the bundle includes.
---
Definitely need more makeshift/lore friendly items. This includes outfits, camp objects, Weapons etc. 
---
lore-friendly builds has always been a go-to for me. 
---
I can only agree with this post.
---
Yes! I did it twice to check. What happens is when you add this skin the weapons keeps showing the stars but removes the lines about the effects (and any bonuses from them). When you remove the skin it goes back to normal. I haven‚Äôt checked if you leave the server with the skin on because I don‚Äôt want to risk my axe that badly.
---
The stuff on the "Fallout 1st" page are the 100% exclusive items, plus 1st members usually get exclusive sales that appear on the "SPECIAL and Free Items" page, but don't appear for non-1st members.
---
aw hell yea
---
Thank you so much
---
Vendor Phoenix in Watoga.
---
great comeback.   here's one someone like you would appreciate:  No u
---
Most mods come from buying the plan for the rifle, crafting, then scrapping. Or just finding the rifles to scrap if you know where to look.
---
Lol yah
---
That's not true. If I'm low in caps or scrap, I can farm some from players at workshops.
---
No witch-hunting allowed on this sub. I recommend you delete your post.
---
To be fair my buddy is level 42, and last night me, him, and some other dude carried the rest of the players. Even at like 30-35 you can have a  nearly complete build depending on the perk costs. But the level 15 hiding in the elevator room last night just so he could get rewards for free is an asshole
---
I would love it if you could fix and use the mining equipment to help defeat the big boi wendigo
---
Yeah Beth is pretty bad about this.  They include things in the screenshots that are other ATOM shop purchases.
---
Of course it does
---
Your welcome
---
That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt put the full name
---
Irrelevant. It‚Äôs still against the rules. 
---
File a complaint through XBox. 
---
This isn‚Äôt the sub for this.
---
Ah ok I think I get what you mean.
---
forgot to add one thing. Yes its RPG but now only online, which is awesome because everybody can roleplay whatever they like, the list is endless but for this example i will only say, people that roleplay the ""bad guys" are also a part of a game like that.
---
Alright
---
When is that?
---
Dont the turrets re-scale if you scrap and rebuild them? Or are the levels set?
---
Yo momma.
---
Oh I have 2 of those, I almost sold one to the Vendor for a measly 15 caps
---
The tent has been available before for 1st members, not sure it still is though.There is a backpack skin like the red ones in the pic, but as far as I know there haven't been any place-able backpacks released yet. I would definitely buy it in a heartbeat.
---
I agree.i went into the event knowing it was going to be tough.all i seen was players below 50.there was only 1 othe high level.it almost seemed as if the monster was invincible.we got him to mutate but it took so long to do that,we ran out of time to actually win the event.maybe tone the monster down a bit for low levels or is there a specific kind of weapon that hurts it more than others?mini nukes were involed.gatlin plasma,gatlin lasers.explosive rounds.shotguns.i threw everything at him and barely scratch his hp.
---
Im on xbox by the way.
---
No you cannot give them a chest with the jet pack that they can learn the plan from
---
Sans vibes
---
How about more than just 2 tattoos to choose from and more than...what is it now, 7 face paint choices
---
Luckily we can buy some of the stuff we missed with gold bullion next season
---
Or even at the very least allow us to deal damage to wanted players without having to toggle it off.
---
I recently got a mic for my headphones, rarely use the mic. The headphones, what a difference it makes, so much more immersive than the TV speakers, that is until my wife comes in and wants to talk.
---
Combat armor skin for the combat armor.
---
Level set
---
So accurate I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh a little. 
---
Idk what would be the best option tho. Maybe removing players from map if they are in an event? I always check how many participants anyway. It‚Äôs impossible to count all the dots sometimes.
---
As far as I know it's only the items that arent cosmetic, such as the chicken coop and ammo converter. If the ghillie armour is there too that would make me a happy man.
---
Half of my photo gallery from the last year is pictures of these lanky weirdos.  My hope is that the brotherhood is coming to finally eradicate this menace.
---
LOL its an old bug.  Happens sometimes when you've exited power armor.  Seems to happen more when you've been to A Colossal Problem.
---
Hah! That's what your body looks like in PA. Old bug.
---
Tight!!!
---
Ehh I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs being introduced tomorrow in the pts so I‚Äôd say sometime next month
---
I still haven‚Äôt found the chest. Is it before or after the red exit sign?
---
When I was about level 20 and my camp was just a bed, vending machines and the workbenches in the open some level 300 appeared and gave me 100 high quality gifts, also some ammo and plans.
---
Yeah, most of the players are great, except the ones who want to sell 1* and 2* legendaries for 5k caps. XD
---
I never even got to finish the event my first time through cause half the people in the event were under fucking level and the other half just decided to fucking leave half way through...
---
yeah the logic i think is to just get the maximum damage possible in a fight. Cool for things like this one but unless you stack them one or two buff doesn't make that much difference, probably overdrive and psychobuff are the most used.
---
My bad. Im saying they should add a chest outside so we can get the loot from the event if it glitches us out
---
Too ghoul for school
---
Protect it from who?
---
Because I'm not excited to see aesthetically boring content?
---
The free states and responders stuff for instance, I quite liked. Different. With personality
---
It does though?  Try looking it up.
---
I'm level 150 and I just finished the free states questline and an almost a general in the brotherhood questline
---
I power leveled from 30 to 80 in 3 days farming scorchbeasts mostly solo and only started doing the main quest after level 120 and even then only doing a few missions here and there
---
This is what this game is missing, challenges like this that give out rewards that you can display, Nuclear winter was sort of this but I think adventure mode needs something. 
---
PS Home was brilliant at this!
---
"No talk... 76.". Best case really weird foreplay.  Most likely you sleep on the couch.
---
This.  None of the science perks reduce crafting cost, they just let you build energy weapons and mods and Master rank 2 improves durability of crafted energy weapons.
---
You're correct, it doesn't reduce the cost for gauss miniguns.
---
Kinda ironic for your tag... üòú
---
There must be a locked door in Grafton.  Should nuke it to open it...
---
I never learned how to pronounce that name lol.
---
I have seen the God wall a few times but have never had it last that long to travel to it. In that sense it's like a rainbow XD
---
Isn't that tina belcher?
---
One I did earlier had one guy at level 143 me at 98 and then 5 others ranging from level 37 down to level fucking 6. Only one of them even had armour on the rest just had pipe rifles and what ever clothes they'd picked up in, what I can only assume is, the 5 minutes since leaving the vault.
---
He couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore.
---
I think PvP will be better once bloodied is nerfed. As that 12 second takedown of Earle video showed, you can quite legitimately make your character so OP that trying to take revenge against a surprise PvP is an utter waste of time. If you do pull out a gamma gun to take them on (as 99% of the time they're *yawn* bloodied) they bail out to their base in the safe zone.
---
I'm on PS4. I have only tried once (and failed) because there were about 12 players that entered and after about 45 seconds, there were only two of us left. We tried valiantly. I burned through thousands  of rounds and dozens of stims and ended up hacking at Earle's legs with my 3* Bloodied Bowie Knife.
---
It was brutal. Next time after I build up more ammo I will make sure that unless we have at least 8 players over 100, I will leave before I waste all the resources again.
---
I understand what your saying. I‚Äôm asking where the chest is located at inside. I still haven‚Äôt found it.
---
A camp surrounding a nuke silo would be awesome!
---
scorched, mutants, robots, whatever attacks the town, you would be sent out with a squad to patrol a certain area that would be near the town and kill everything that's a threat.
---
sorry ps4
---
Yeah, that would be cool if it was a way to improve leather armor, buffing the overall ballistic and energy resistance. It should have a leathery reptilian look and maybe carved  death claw horns at the end of the cuffs for extra bashing and fist damage.
---
How is this an exploit?
---
If you die during the event before Earl dies you simply see your corpse with the Respawn selector, the clickable word, but you can't, as nothing happens and you just get stuck in that view, once/if the event ends you will get dumped outside the mine with those that completed the event.
---
It looks like you bailed and waited for free stuff, but in reality the game fuckd you over.
---
Most likely, someone on your server was a total jerk.
---
You can use the power armor glitch to clip into the arena early, then the 5 minutes of time are more than enough to solo Earle if you're using a hacked or magic gun.
---
Alternatively, it could just be a random glitch. When entering certain interior cells (esp. Whitesprings) I've had an invisible, glitched "aura of death" of sorts around me. Whenever I step close enough to a robot, it drops dead. Could be something similar.
---
Don't feel bad. I saw three today in relatively rapid succession and all three ACP events failed
---
On ps4 and only just got to do my first run. Solo on prvt. First drop was helm. Looking for legacy only lol.
---
There aint no chest inside, when u kill the wendigo collosus it drops loot. But if you die it takes u out of the event and u cant get it
---
Scorched earth is different because every high level on the server can still participate. The colossus caps at 8 people, hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet but If I joined with a bunch of low levels in there I wouldn‚Äôt waste the ammo, the event is gonna fail (only run it 4 times, always successful but always had all 100+ players through luck)
---
just screenshot them
---
yes, this is because it is no longer grognaks axe and is now greloks staff, hence it loses all legendary effects and is reincarnated as a a fancy dildo /s
---
i am bloodied and i get killed by a bolstering armor/ vampires weapons anytime. Be a Tank and a bloodied stands no freaking chance.Bloodied shouldnt be nerfed there are way better builds that should be nerfed. Bloodied ist not a pvp build its a funny build bc you do a lot of damage but for the price of dying by one hit.
---
Given how much everyone strives to be individual I'm really surprised Beth aren't farming the living daylights out of us with genuinely coinworthy attire &amp; cosmetics..
---
Yeah I just tested it a little and it really does not seem to work. But I encourage you to try it out and see for yourself.
---
I finished this morning!!  I feel relieved.
---
Quite possible.  I didn't hear any shooting, but I'm sure that means nothing.
---
Yeah I know that. The last exclusive we got though was the Bog Wanderer outfit and that feels like it was weeks ago. I feel like we should have gotten something new by now
---
You mean 50% &lt; 100? (Less than).  If so I tend to agree.
---
Not how wendigo's work but k
---
it would, actually if I can do it I might actually do it
---
The legendary run finishes when the green ship reaches level 100, right? So in two weeks?
---
You could have just signed out, right?
---
Oh good idea
---
It's amazing that these sorts of bugs are even possible.
---
As I said in another comment is because when you walk through the curtains it slows you down, stops you for a second. So if the curtains weren't there you would just take some damage and be pushed forward. But because you move slowly it like hits you a ridiculous amount of times and you just die. 
---
And if I want to be picky clipping things through walls so they are invisible is also a little shady. But it's more the other thing.
---
Edit - dont just downvote me. If I'm wrong about this being an exploit then tell me. I would like to learn how it isn't.
---
If you have a friend with a private world you can complete it there.  If you're on PS4 I'll let you use mine when I get home from work.
---
According to the test servers, that Gatling laser is about to take an 80% damage reduction, so I‚Äôm not sure I would respec for it just yet.  
---
As a stealth comando, you can contribute by crippling limbs on the boss and doing floor clean up keeping little problems off the heavy builds.  
---
My comando doesn‚Äôt have much strength to work with.  He‚Äôll never fill the shoes of my PA/heavy build.  They are just too different.
---
Wendigo like dark, damp places, we see with in most of the places they spawn. They probably chose that as their hunting ground
---
Maybe a quick fix would be to place on top of weapon-wall-racks?
---
Just and idea. Don‚Äôt have it myself (yet) 
---
But sad to hear this non the less...
---
Turrets of any kind are almost useless. They're not worth the budget they eat for what they do.
---
Mobs can shoot at your CAMP from a quarter mile away, while your turrets won't even alert most of the time, until something is practically spray painting gang signs on it. And even then...
---
Unless they adjust their firing distance and aggro sensitivity, you're better off dumping them for budget. Make something actually useful. Like a chicken poop coup. Or a wind chime.
---
I'm not saying I agree or disagree. I love the idea of the MMORPG FPS thing. I wish there was more of the PVP stuff imo. I'm just answering the question. The average fallout player doesn't care about the battlefield player, COD, fortnite, etc. So that's why they get upset. I have played or RPed as bad. I've nuked camps and workshops. But I've been part of the FO community and most never cared about the PvP side.
---
I have a private world on Xbox.
---
So I can do it alone, or do I still need someone else?
---
Maybe? Dunno...haven't bothered with PVP for 210 levels, I'm not sure what clears a bounty outside of humiliating defeat at the hands of a level 15 player...to be fair I did just switch to a bloodied build after playing junkies and heavy gunner on the character...still humiliating...
---
Some games use a weekly reputation limit... knowing how much Beth loves its dumbass daily/weekly limits and caps they'd probably be ecstatic to add a weekly reputation limit
---
I won't be doing the next one.  The run made the game into work.  I still like the game, just haven't had fun doing stuff for no reason.  For example planting 10 crops at my finished camp or placing (and scrapping) 5 roof pieces.
---
I mean instead of picking the locks.
---
Whoops.  That‚Äôs what I meant.  Most of the server is typically ‚Äúlow‚Äù level, or less than 100.  Maybe 10% of the time I‚Äôll see a player that‚Äôs higher level than me, in the upper half of 500 or more.  Today I saw a lvl 1000+.  That‚Äôs very rare, even on PC.
---
Hmm, maybe the three basic heavy weapons perks in STR for the +30%, which won't force you to respec a ton of special points, then wear PA and grab Stabilized in INT for the armor penetration.
---
How so?
---
I did it once for the same reason. They'll ask for the date of purchase and exact bundle or item name.
---
As mentioned they sent a confirmation email and did mention I could keep the accidental purchase on them.
---
You should be able to do it alone, the bug is it can only be completed once on a server.  It refreshes when the server does so a private word solves the problem.
---
Sometimes I drop a nuke on peoples camps because I dont like their prices in vendors. Like 3 caps a shell, 300 for a deep pocket plan. I dont want the plants around or to kill the mobs. Its just because i dont like your vendor.

Really I just give it 5-10 seconds to load normally before I touch anything. 
---
Not that this is a good solution. But it seems to work ok when given a little time. 
---
(I probably have all holos, all notes and almost every FTP cosmetic in game just for comparison)
---
Lvl 51, hitting 1500~ with my bloodied piercing powerfist. 
---
Don't blame me.
---
I‚Äôm getting joy at all these high leveled 300+ players raging about this event lol. That‚Äôs for every time you fucks one shot a legendary so nobody else can get loot.
---
16x the working
---
Increase spawn time is a good mechanic. It means you can't brute force your way through an event.
---
There should be some punishment for death &amp; since we really don't have any, this is good.
---
oh and the 12 second takedown has nothing to do with bloodied builds. Those are hacked 50cals my love.
---
Definitely will take the time to test it out this weekend, thanks!
---
Yea i've tried it before but I didn't see much of a difference, if not one at all. But thanks!
---
Just like how in Terraria (best game) would give you mob banners for a certain number of mob kills

You can complete this through a private server.... Or believe it or not through a public, which Noone has tried to complete it. Tried and tested.
---
sorry titanium weapons make little sense.  titanium is not dense , its actually strong and light weight.  i wish they used black titanium for light weight mods for armor but its not used for some odd reason.
---
Its 90 a low level xd
---
Dataminers have confirmed it a few times on here.
---
I haven't done the ACP event yet, mainly cause nobody ever seems to spawn it, but I'm also only level 80, having not playing in over a year, and the 8 player limit. 
---
I've fought a Wendigo Colossus outside of the event and it took 9 of us almost 20 minutes to take the fucker out, so I expect this guy to be a lot more difficult...
---
&gt;I would rather be able to use my vamps FFR ultracite Gatling laser and have it actually do some damage.
---
Mutually exclusive requirements.
---
Stabalized (need PA) &amp; One Gun Army. Otherwise usual damage perks.
---
I got 62 seconds
---
Are you running it with demo expert? I havent messed with explosive weapons much lately but that might make a difference too
---
Still no respawn fix I see
---
"JuSt dOnT dIe ThEn"
---
That's lazy, caps and scrap are easy to come by, and you get very little scrap from workshops, and dick move taking other players hard earned caps. They need them just as much or more than you. And I get a guaranteed 1,400 caps a day just by farming water.
---
The problem with messing about and slowing it down is the bar drops and it can fail. Ive seen multiple fail now. It starts at the same time every hour. I watch the clock and get there early
---
Zealots Gatling - Scorched King
---
Lever Action - The Honeymoon (perception = site seeing. explosive AA = blowing their clothes off.)
---
How do you know that they were all in their own individual instances though.
---
I run a full health heavy guns build I swap between a .50 to do mediocre dps on the boss then a vampires Gatling that does garbage dps but works on the spawns and keeps me at full health.
---
I spam stims if I‚Äôm not shooting at anything.
---
Wow, a lot of these comments are super disappointing to me. IMHO, games shouldn't force you into builds (even in the end-game), and yeah, level 100+ players one-shotting everything */is/* _SUPER_ annoying. Also, level 100+ players who one-shot everything ruin the game for those who want to play what they like because they whine that the game isn't challenging enough . . .
---
But I guess fuck me for wanting to play this game */AND/* do so with perk cards and weapons that I actually like, and for not wanting to be an addict or bloodied . . .  Oh, and fuck me, too, for having picked up *FO76* during the Covid quarantine‚Äîguess I'm useless until level 90 and/or should never have started playing at all?
---
All that aside, a level 50 threshold for the Colassal Problem event is fine with me; I can agree on that point. The vast majority of these comments sound incredibly elitist, though.
---
Edit: One more thing? This is supposed to be a survival game. Maybe it's just me, but bloodied and junkie builds seem like the sort of people who wouldn't survive long in the case of an apocalypse on account of their being nearly-dead or, you know, addicts (overdosing is a thing). I should not have to be bloodied or a junkie in order to be viable, and a roleplaying game/its player base boxing me into that corner feels pretty messed up to me.
---
Rifleman can do decent damage not everyone wants to be commando
---
The picture that‚Äôs shown on the ATX website is nothing even remotely close to what they‚Äôre selling on the Atomic Shop. That picture shows the tent skin, backpack, stash box, loot bad and gurney. The one in the atomic shop has the plywood signs, flags, Klaxon light, workbenches, player icon and Crossed Axes Decoration. Nothing that‚Äôs shown in the above picture. The responders PA skin is under special offers. Pretty deceptive if you ask me but then again it‚Äôs Bethesda. Look how much they said would be included in FO 1st that hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet
---
I can about imagine how great that went
---
yes i got that it was a good argument. But they just cant be surprised about being melted because there is a very obvious notice :p   
---
Never was a great pvp player too but in this game its fun, when you find the right people you can have actually fun fights, no saltyness whatsoever :)
---
My family is so used to me being zoned out with the headset on they don't even bat an eye anymore, untill I start talking to someone who isn't there.  My fault for being so asocial.
---
Agreed, and unfortunately this type of short term thinking is endemic to all of the corporate world, not just gaming.
---
Try looking around on the roof as the top of the bracket sometimes pokes through, although it is very small.
---
It‚Äôs to the right before you exit to Appalachia. When you first go in the door will say ‚Äòinaccessible‚Äô
---
Wait, you're being an arsehole because the game mechanics allow for it but then complain about being called toxic?
---
Umm... OK...
---
Was working as of last night. But it's possible it's patched now
---
Yes, i'll try it out with demo expert on and off to see if the difference shows a little more, if there is one
---
I put it on a brick wall (inside) with Mothman barn wallpaper. No problems earlier. PS4.
---
Just no
---
It was right at the end...figured it would be faster and I could still complete the event to get me some of Graham's special meat...
---
Allah ak-
---
(rereads title)
---
Nevermind...
---
they fucked this up with one of the last 2 updates.
---
Actually if you‚Äôre running a full health sentinel build with a fast vampire/SS melee weapon the fight is kind of trivial as long as you have some good DPS behind you. My melee toon has done the fight 5 times and hasn‚Äôt been downed yet.
---
nope, probably going to have to be a Bethesda fix.  I figured all the self traders would be talking about this more but i don't see too many, so it could be an isolated problem, but i doubt it.
---
Well its not uncommon die in the impostor event and get stuck dead with 3 seconds respawn the game just freezes.
---
Imagine with 60 seconds the chance of this happen.
---
I am thinking it is every note I saved since beta. Already cleared Holotapes and Misc. only thing left is those notes. If that doesn‚Äôt fix it then I am out of ideas
---
I attack earl Williams till he is half health then I let the wendigos or earl Williams to kill me then I respond and wait at the top for earl to get killed so you can go down and loot him.
---
Damm that‚Äôs so unlucky
---
I failed my last 2 the last 2 days, as we did not have the DPS (incl Todays single Raid...)
---
a level 34 with a rifle and a level 57 with a lever action ruined it for us
---
Regards
---
PLZ FIX THIS!
---
Jean
---
That‚Äôs good to know I just figured out you can‚Äôt fast travel after you bet the boss you need to ether run out or wait till the timer runs out. If not you get removed for the fight and get nothing 
---
Should of knew but now it‚Äôs confirmed just die if you can‚Äôt escape
---
Hey thank you for the advice I appreciate it!
---
Sure, any bugs should be fixed. Agreed. The increasing time mechanic is good though. That should remain regardless.
---
I feel you on that. My gf is practically my wife, and it's funny how indifferent she is towards fo76. Until a loading screen pops up with a screenshot of my avatar crouched down next to commander dag's behind when she's leaning in at her console... Had a hard time explaining that one, haha
---
Hey thank you for the offer!

I can help out, level 300.
---
We are a welcoming lot.
---
Actually haven't seen one fail so far this year.  Last year though had enough fail that I learned how to solo it.  
---
Same posts about the lazy afk drummers and meat spit turning bastards ruining the  event by leeching both times though....
---
The limit is only in place to make the event challenging... it an endgame event meant for players who prepare for it (aka ammo / stimpak , chems and buffed ) not random ppl
---
Dont be that guy who throws his headset off and forgets to mute the mic, ahah
---
But... but sir have you heard of our lord and savior the bloodied 25 25 fixer?
---
I don't really worry if I upset someone. I run around and steal from collectrons, water purifiers, extractors. If I need a workshop i take it. But before 76 no one ever said "fallout is a great fps." VATS exists because it's actually a very bad FPS lol. The engine was bad at that part of the game. So as the game as changed since beta it's leaned away from it's PvP identity and back MMORPG. I think when one wastelanders updates that'll be a final nail in the coffin for the PvP world as it'll be more focused on solo RPG play that can be augmented with team play.
---
Just use different weapon and armour types as you're levelling up &amp; see what feels good. You'll settle on something you prefer eventually üôÇ Join public teams too as you'll get various bonuses - builders &amp; events teams are best for XP boosts. Don't forget to use perk cards either &amp; just explore, enjoy &amp; stay fed &amp; watered üëç
---
Give them stripper names. Peaches and lexus.
---
Thanks. That was my sixth time in there. Only two fails so far, I thought I was prepared. I was wrong.
---
Thank you.
---
I agree with everything you've said completely, and you were, like, the one person who commented on this post whose contributions didn't crush me.
---
üëçüèª
---
Funny as in a target of mocking or derision, yes? Because this company‚Äôs fuck-ups stopped making me smile a while back.
---
I have heard some really weird crap because of that lol.
---
Then they will be doing even less damage
---
Same concept. In all this time I wasnt ever talking to my television, but one day the television was speaking to me after I equipped a tinfoil hat
---
I just clear my throat...

He‚Äôs Radicool.

Nothing happens really, after reaching Level 100 I completed a weekly quest for 1000 score points, but it didn't add
---
Still not deceptive if you bother to read the description it clearly states whats in the bundle
---
Hmm. I guess with the damage balances coming it‚Äôs time to go back to full health sentinel anyways. Now to see what SS rolls I can pull.
---
I didn't mind the filler personally. And I agree, maybe make it 1000 score per level after 100. It could award lunch boxes, caps, atoms, chems, or maybe some kind of short term buff. Like xp for 30 minutes.
---
Edit to say I finished yesterday and completed some today just out of playing. Weird seeing the award of nothing.
---
If someone wants to take a workshop i took on a public server, go for it, you can have it. I'll go get a different one.
---
If i really want workshops for some reason, i'll jump on a private server.
---
i popped a friend request over. i'll just take all the help i can get, thanks!
---
I just hit level 40 today, and have been playing for about a month or so. Everyday I see a steady stream of level 2 players coming out of the vault.
---
You can come out ahead with ammo from Wendigo ammo drops. If you‚Äôre using a heavy gun, you‚Äôre just minimizing ammo loss.
---
Then show a picture what‚Äôs in the bundle on the ATX website, not something different. Who cares what the bundle reads in the atomic shop if you‚Äôre going to show something different on your website
---
Um... no?
---
[Crafting energy guns now costs fewer materials.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/science-expert)

idk how this would happen (its possible in WoW. but i know thats a bigger game) but i want to be able to use different armor cosmetics. for example, i run SS armor but would love to be able to make the pieces look like a cooler combat armor set. or do something like how the settlers look, with outfits such ad scattered armor pieces over like flannel shirt snd jeans. sure i guess i could do that anyways, but would be cool if i could do it with whatever armor i wanted on underneat the cosmetic. i know that wont happen though. more armored up / wastelandey outfits would be tight.
---
XD
---
I completely agree.  I feel ZERO need to play at this point.   I've done nearly everything and "Colossal Problem" needs some refinement before I'm will to dedicate my resources to it.
---
Everyone was using skins, they were just too popular.  
---
Something had to be done to bring skins in line with vanilla appearances.
---
I've fought a wendigo Colossus outside the event with 4-5 other people and been fine. This thing is just such a fucking sponge. I'm 206 and I felt like I was throwing rocks at the damn thing. These fights are honestly so unsatisfying
---
Nifty weapon. I have yet to get any decent bloodied melee weapon.
---
I would strongly disagree. I didn't die once It took maybe 5 minutes most. To kill Earle also I wouldn't know the suffering of wasting ammo luckly as I am a Bloodied unarmed build though my friend Level 156 died multiple times and he had power armor another thing people should keep in mind is power armor is actually not good at all. I am capable of getting 650-700 DMG resistance bit lower for energy resistance meaning my point stands. I beat T-65 in every way but rad resistance. And I am for context I'm Level 265. Also To be fair I just did the event solo
---
Let me keep the items and refunded me the atoms for the inconvenience. Here is what I said to them if you want to copy/paste feel free:
---
&gt; Hello, I hope you are having a nice day without too much stress.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I recently used some of my Fallout 1st Atoms to purchase the new "communist" item bundle for 1000 atoms which used the majority of my monthly allocation. I love the items! Unfortunately the communist bunker item, and fences item are currently bugged out, similar to other items previously released in the atom shop in the past (which took months to get fixed). The bunker in particular is broken in several ways, namely being unable to decorate it as advertised and that it does not fit properly into any terrain it is used on. The fences also do not sit properly, but I can work around that.
---
&gt; Can you please credit me some atoms for the inconvenience? I love the items theme and would prefer not to have it removed from my account, but this issue is a little frustrating given the recent string of bugs/broken atom shop items that are slipping through.
---
&gt; I am a big fan of the game, just a little let down.
---
&gt; Thank you!
---
Submitted that 08/18/2020 10:38 PM and received the atoms on 08/19/2020 11:15 PM.
---
As a side note: I really like how they decorated their church. They have one radiation emitter per pew. The 'holy water' is in fact 'toxic water'. They did a great job reinforcing the ceiling and blocking out the windows to ensure that the sun did not enter and activate 'sun kissed'. Finally, there is a big sign on the front door that says 'Rad sponge users will be shot on sight'. It is pretty nice!
---
The only downside is that they are constantly have to do repairs and maintenance because one accidental discharge of a bloodied weapon will destroy half the church.
---
Or... You could make a whole new Queen/Earle killer melee or commando build capable of soloing him. That way no matter who or what you‚Äôre paired with you‚Äôll always get loot!
---
I think it‚Äôs just consoles in general. You ever seen a PC stream? Don‚Äôt. It‚Äôll make you jealous of how quickly they can do simple things like cook.
---
I will recheck the actual card in game once I'm home from work but I'm fairly sure it doesn't.  Either nukes and dragons has outdated info or the wiki does, either one is equally possible so when in doubt go to the source; unfortunately I am unable to do so at this time.
---
Only one of us was above level 100 at the time, the reason it took so long is cause I'm a melee build, ~~I really need to find a better weapon~~ and most of the others ran out of ammo multiple times... My main job was to keep it busy while others went and got more ammo...
---
wanting to pvp makes people an asshole? now thats a high class argument right there.See guys that's what I meant with this toxicity that players immediately have when thinking about pvp. YOu cant even imagine that pvp can be fun or?Only because you dont like a certain playstyle it doesnt make eberybody that likes it is an asshole. Ever heard about the word tolerance?
---
If you're sticking with rifles I'd recommend going stealth. If you want to be in power armor I'd go for heavy guns. Most of my heavy guns are two shot so the accuracy from power armor really helps.
---
With everything going on in that mine and all of the adds that the boss spawns I bet the game would lag out if the whole server could join the same instance.
---
I don't think it should bank to next season, but earning atoms that you can spend .. that makes sense. I realized as I hit 100 today that I've got nothing except faction building and gold earning to do now.
---
With my sneak bloody build I always manage a few hits with melee until I‚Äôm detected
---
I've seen several people afk on the ledges at the jump down, it's frustrating to see it happening already
---
They're good if of you have demo expert. I have a two shot weight reduced Fatman that I use to relieve myself of mini nukes. I had a Bloodied missile launcher for awhile as well, but alas it was scripped by accident. They work best when you get a cluster of enemies, you can one shot five mutants at once.
---
Me (level 58 at the time) and a level 217 were put in the same instance, despite 5 others being present in the cave at the time. We killed the chicken legged cunt with 3 seconds left on the clock. I must have put 5k 5.56 rounds and 1k fusion cells into him, and about 1200x 5.56 into that bastard‚Äôs brethren. Most intense fight I‚Äôd ever had, and I PvP. And yes, my build is already optimised. So I was helpful.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before by accident. It‚Äôs pretty funny!
---
When BOS DLC is delayed for the third time till spring next year;)
---
So, when you tell people you are about to do pvp, their reaction is thumbs down and puking emote, yet you say you they should just say if they don't want to pvp.
---
What do you think the thumbs down emote is meaning if not, 'No'?
---
Because Bloodied is also good for saving your ass.
---
Cool. What kinda weapons are you looking for and any preferred armor/mod combo? Can‚Äôt make everything, but I can make most.
---
Since the rewards are so similar to Scorched Earth, perhaps they forgot to enable the repair kit rewards for A colossal Problem :P
---
True.  The one time I helped a public teammate in a PVP zone the dude he was fighting was bloodied.  Hit me and made a tiny dent.
---
Lit him up with my junkies lmg. I am full healh PA with Kintetic dynamo with dodgy/action boy.  You gotta drain my Ap, then my health, then born survivor kicks in.
---
It likely won‚Äôt have a stable market value until after then event ends, at least judging by previous events. I usually see the more rare rewards as trade listings for other rare event rewards.
---
I dunno, I agree with him to a point.   
---
On one hand we are genuinely lacking BOS and Enclave stuff.   
---
On the other hand, BGS Austin wants to design them as generic tacticool garbage.   
---
See: BOS Spec OPs outfit from Daily Ops that looks like it was straight lifted from Rainbow Six.
---
They'll always list what's 1st exclusive sales and 1st free items on the "coming to atom shop" articles if you're not sure in the future.
---
It's not even a Cackle, what the heck...
---
Oh no, I just bought the bundle and applied the skin, I need to check my damage :S
---
Fallout would be a raider gang who descended from comic book nerds and adopted the Grognak stories as oral tradition.
---
I took the same exact screenshot hahaha I‚Äôm like wtf is going on?!?
---
It‚Äôs an old game and it‚Äôs not at all about making nukes cool. In the endgame when ICBMs are flying there are human sobbing noises mixed into the soundtrack. 
---
Good game... and very grim.
---
Bitch please, who are you kidding. At least be honest enough to own it.
---
Ikr! It‚Äôs only been out for like a day and people are leaching already..
---
It depends on how you view 'tactical'.   
---
If you're going to give me some stuff that's lifted straight out of Rainbow Six, then no. No thank you. I know that's what a lot of people want, real world military fatigues with pouches and kevlar and yadda yadda - But please no. Doesn't fit Fallout and is frankly grating on the eyes.   
---
Some stuff more like the Free States Revolutionary outfit? Take my money!
---
Crap. I didn‚Äôt think of that
---
[Look for yourself, no need to wait. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/PP9c6rI)
---
[And the Wiki agrees](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Science_Expert)
---
I think you‚Äôre confused, friend, and thinking of Science *Master*, not Science ***Expert***.
---
Science Master 2 increases durability. Not Science Expert 2.
---
I did it for the experiment was expecting the game to say both couldnt be placed xD
---
And sometimes they just won't give you the refund at all, stating that its a "known issue".
---
Almost all the time. I have to exit server then come back to fix it most times.
---
That's awesome haha
---
I disagree with the fact of being good.
---
The event in general are super easy due to enemy poor AI , i really dont think increase the respawn time to compensate the low dificulty its the right way to do the things. I think 10 may be enough yo punish players death ( and fixing the bug too.)
---
I can‚Äôt quite solo it. But I can go in with one other capable teammate and succeed.
---
True dat ü§£
---
Ya I get 130-140 ultracite 5mm ammo from the mobs if I use a ultracite Gatling gun. The ammo return is insane on that gun.
---
My issue is with the ceiling and him getting stuck up there
---
&gt; Pretty cool if you happen to be there when it happens
---
I've tried this, but I've never managed to get the timing quite right. By the time you get the nuke notification, it's already coming out and it's too late to fast travel there and run to the launch hatch.
---
Because I'm curious. What happens if you're standing on the hatch when it opens and the missile comes out? Does it kill you?
---
I am at the point I would trade a peppered and spicy plus a moo moo backpack plan for a meat tenderizer plan.   
---
So take that for what it is worth?
---
PC w/ 2080Ti runs fine.
---
Bethesda: ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do about it?‚Äù
---
Wait a couple of weeks after the event &amp; see what others in the game are selling it for.
---
Don't waste your time with Fed76. They bias their prices unrealistically high by design. They're not remotely based off average prices.
---
And ammo!
---
Id wager its because console sees a decent performance dip during the fight. PC's uncapped framerates means more consistent damage longer? That is my guess.
---
Honestly.... Yeah they've had bugs..... Have I been stopped from my adventure..... No.
---
Are some of the bugs annoying..... Fuck yes!!!! And if I didn't like this game i wouldn't play. So if you don't, don't play.... Simple. I know that sounds harsh but Bethesda doesn't care so you have to find the go arounds
---
Then I stand corrected, thank you friend for increasing my knowledge.
---
Lever Action - Backwoods. Hunting in Appalachia requires a keen eye, and we often handload high grain ammunition.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôve got nothing clever for the plasma, good luck.
---
No worries. I had a feeling you were thinking of Master instead of Expert.
---
Ooh assassins might be viable
---
I play casually and am level 70. No excuse IMO
---
Did you mean to say anal?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Three people can already finish the event.  No reason for a level cap.  No reason to complain about AFK.  People.cab already dolo.the event
---
Just know the cursed weapons are static legendary affixes, so no need to hope for a bloodied cursed harpoon gun or whatever.
---
Ok, but I will never forgive them for taking away the teddy bears filming a cooking show.
---
Looking for a good group, sounds interesting. More info?
---
Im coming out with alt characters almost daily for the level up rewards
---
I'm 167, launched my first solo nuke...
---
 (checks watch)
---
Two days ago.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I always feared it would be hard, but I used a magic pump shotgun and I was one hitting everything. More tedious than hard.
---
I like the event for sure if only they could sort out these few issues.
---
This is what I get for transitioning to a heavy weapons build in 76.  Gauss rifle was my favorite in 4 but I was underwhelmed by it's performance in 76.
---
Ouch!
---
This might be common knowledge, but spotlights dramatically increase the range and targeting accuracy of mounted defenses.
---
Yep, I've seen people crouching on those ledges and not moving for the entire fight. It's super obvious because you see them still in the same place as last time, every time you die and have to drop down again.
---
I've also seen afk-ers up near the beginning of the mine where you first teleport in, and it's harder to notice those ones because you never go back up there until the fight is over.
---
how long do these buffs last?
---
i get the puking emojis after fighting mostly, or when I talk and people get that i am a girl. Apparently getting killed by a girl is a overlord sin or something  
---
no i dont always tell them, for an example. Level 300 player owns workshop, i go there say hi and use the gun emoji. He pulls out his gunas well, to me that means yes we will fight. THen I shoot and kill them they come back I kill them again, they kill me and so on so on. i tend to kill people a loot because most people have shitty armor builds, its not even my weapons. I get puking emotes when i kill them over and over and then they hear through the chat that I am a girl. So its mostly saltyness.Sometimes i come there and say through voice that i am going to attack since pvp zone here, then i get puking emotes a lot. I am being polite telling them that they are about to get attacked in a pvp zone ( i wouldnt have to do that) but still get called toxic.
---
They're not all that bad.
---
We're talking improved repair kits, not the atom shop ones.
---
Agreed. But I thought you meant the actual floor, as I just did it and Earl Dibbs or whatever his name is kept falling through the floor.
---
I felt the same way, but the Gauss Shotgun has been... interesting, to say the least.
---
Yeah, they'll be back when the next dupe comes around in September instead
---
And brands.
---
okay now i know you are trolling. DUde this was supposed to be a serious discussion. PVP itself is not toxic. Wanting to do that is not toxic.  
---
Killing a level 6 taking all their junk and laughing at them is toxic i agree, but that is not what this discussion is about.
---
This faction was the beginnings of an old faction called the ARR, the original owners decided to close down the server and use the arr as our main, I asked to keep it, so it's been sitting in my discord list for the past couple of months, me and a few of my friends decided to get back into 76 again and try to restore this faction to its former glory, we want it to be a good small community that's not too serious and really fun to just hang out with people and play 76 with them.
---
Lever action. "The can opener "
---
Plasma "scorched surprise "
---
I just want a white van.  And place my vendors there.  And yes we will have candy.
---
I absolutely love these random setups that can be found in the game. Don't ever stop making these!
---
Bro literally this hapend to me and my friend
---
What I mean is that it still needs to always have those items loaded in so it doesn't reduce overall strain. Having a locked away collection that's not accessed until you click into it is not something this engine does well
---
... well shit
---
No worries. I‚Äôm an idiot and like to make ‚Äòjokes‚Äô, hah.
---
It's an instanced area to prevent lag, only 8 players per fight regardless of team status from what I've seen on here.
---
Just did it and there was a level 15 that was downed every ten seconds. There were a couple mid-40s too that didn‚Äôt fare much better.
---
Easy solution get your friend that is good at PVP make them seem garbage at PVP and when "Discord" fights back he gets destroyed and text him "My Junk Now" I only say this as I am that friend and it's so funny watching them get destroyed
---
So how exactly does the vampire thing work?
---
Meh...bloodied + sneak + stacked perks = cheese no matter what, especially if you are stacking chems\food\bobbles\mags. Some group will do it faster soon enough.
---
few minutes (less than five i think) wich you can double the time with some perk cards
---
Yep, government requisitions are one of the known drops. I'd personally farm them but I'm not in the mood to run between a laggy terminal and random spawn point 500 times
---
Still not sure of the mechanics but I think there‚Äôs a max number of individuals (8?) in an instance of the battle. So you could have been #8 in your instance then your friend ended up in another.
---
Edit: Shit spelling
---
It was quick for me to check because of bloodied, it dropped about 400 damage. Anything else maybe one of the SPECIAL boots would be an easy check?
---
I've sold a few of them before, I believe they are just a rare item in the camp plan pool
---
More people need to read the patch notes.
---
There are multiple instances of the fight, each one 8 players max. Once one instance is filled up, the game creates a new one for the overflow players, until that one reaches 8 players and then another new instance is created, and so on until nobody else joins.
---
Which instance you get put into is basically random.
---
Sounds like he was put into a different instance than you. You can be put into different instances, despite being on the same team.
---
The rarest stuff will be more valuable, as is natural.
---
But the top billing item will be the Tenderizer plan, since it adds a weapon to Legendary reward pools (Like the Fixer, Sheepsquatch Staff, etc.), followed by the plans for it's mods.
---
Adrenaline seems to help a lot. Fixer doing almost 150-200 damage per hit without meds
---
My favorite thing about them is the siren that goes off when it's being launched I remember when I first played 76 after the beta hearing that siren for the first time was spine chilling
---
Yes. To answer your question, yes. But it kinda makes sense that people that play on PC are the more hardcore/invested gamers, doesn't it?
---
I did the raid (is it ok to call it a raid? It sure felt like an attempt at an MMO "raid boss" event) about an hour ago on XBox. Not sure about anyone else but XBox has been almost impossible lately since the update, for me at least, due to lag. Everything is laggy. I have a bit of understanding of the general story (?) But was mostly confused about why Earle was a giant monster?  I was mostly trying to help clean up the spawns. The fight was so laggy it was hard to keep track of everything. We did beat it, got out of the mine and my console immediately crashed üòÇ can't wait to do it again. Looted one or two wendigos and had no idea where Earles body was. It's almost impossible to find the way out. Guess I will see tomorrow when I log back on if I got any completion loot besides the armor piece I received for finishing.
---
I finished today and plan on taking time off away from 76 and play some other games. I work full time so the grind has eaten all my gaming time lately.
---
The event allows 8 people at a time, therefore when it reaches a maximun count it opens a new instance.
---
This has been an ongoing issue.
---
They should put a damage threshold on him too.
---
I get jealous watching them set vendor prices or using the favorites wheel. And the perk load out mod. So happy the last one is coming at some point
---
Now you can do whatever you want. After I finished I went on a SBQ farming marathon and then more recently started experimenting with a high health build.
---
Your new characters probably won't have a legendary weapon to take advantage of anyway though....
---
How much do you want to bet that it's because they literally CAN'T remove it? ;)
---
Grenades will make her take off.
---
I like troubleshooters armor. The only enemies that seem to deal real damage to me are Assaultrons and the Mr Gutsy robots. Everything else I can either dodge or it doesn't do enough damage to worry about.
---
Can confirm, it was coincidence. I've done 20 or so and the loot, like SBQ, is entirely randomized. Nice finds, though!
---
I'm a high level but I'm no tank. Thank you to those players who dedicate their gaming in Appalachia at fine tuning their damage. Sure the hell isn't me üòÇ
---
How? Once you hit somebody, you're marked as potential-hostile to the person you hit if they want to hit back. You can't just withdraw it. It only prevents you from initiating combat, not taking damage
---
I'll give you three fiddy
---
Hoorah for unarmed melee and nukashine. It won't be long before the damage nerf on the PTS makes this build a lot less fun (on bosses), but with buffs stacking twice (afaik) as they do now its just fab. I died a few times, but still managed to solo it when the rest of the team got disconnected somehow.
---
Another reason I like Fasnacht better. If you forget and aren‚Äôt there right at the top of the hour you can probably find a parade up until about 10 after. With Meat Week you‚Äôre screwed if you‚Äôre not there on time.
---
That's pretty clever
---
I tried this AFK thing on the spit in photomode w/ a rubberband spinning the camera but it still timed out.  I'd love to know how you guys do that.
---
5% drop rate from the event. Much lower than the other items in the event. Rare for the event but not bad chances for it. Not like trying to get a red asylum nurse outfit.
---
Agreed. I prefer my character to look like they're a survivor and uses practical outfits, rather than looking like some goof ball in a Halloween costume, running around, blowing crap up.
---
I still do this with what's available in the game but some unique options to make yourself look different from other players and NPCs would be nice.
---
I got a load of outfits already available I can craft, but most of them are dumb costumes I have zero interest in.
---
There's like three outfits in the list that seem like they belong in the game, while the rest just seem odd. A cow girl outfit? A hunter's outfit? Some Davy Crockett leather outfit? A two headed cow outfit? Come on.
---
Goofy outfits are OK for events or times when you're just messing around, but regular gameplay these just don't fit for me.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the timer, but what bothers me is on PS4 it‚Äôs basically unplayable. The lag totally destroys the gameplay to the point I can hardly turn
---
The SBQ will focus and attack one person. If they are in the sky then she will stay in the sky. If you are big and noisy and in the open then attack and hopefully she will attack you and land. I would say attack in the open, don't stagger, short bursts. If you are in the sky, only shoot on crop dusting and when she lands. Should speed the event up a lot.
---
My Zealots 3* knuckles
---
I named 'May it Compel You!'
---
I mean, they had a faction system with the raiders and the settlers. Enclave makes sense as the opposing faction for the upcoming storyline.
---
It has a 5% chance to drop from the Colossal Problem event. That's a 1 in 20 chance.
---
If you like it, keep it. If you want to sell it, there are probably never going to be less on the market than there are now (therefore, if you want to sell it, sell it now).
---
How are you guys on xbox not getting disconnected?  I tested this, went to a spit, set it into photomode and rubber banded the sticks so the camera rotated and I still got disconnected.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong?  I even plugged the controller into power to ensure it didn't die.
---
Thanks  
---
Dave
---
Well, generally speaking an exploit is when you "exploit" something in the game that is not behaving the way it should be behaving in order to achieve something that you should not be able to achieve.
---
In this case...is this an exploit, a bug, "a clever use of game mechanics" or even "working as intended?"  They are asking you to explain the reasoning you used to determine that it was an exploit rather than one of the other options.
---
Fair, but I'd argue that no one would really be able to tell how far the event is from completion when joining, and that most people wouldn't be *trying* to jump in right at the end for easy rewards. Consider that if you did try to wait as long as possible to join to get an easy payday, you're risking someone else taking your spot and getting nothing. And, you can already join right away and still be a low level or a do nothing.
---
The general rule is if you're in front of the piece that's on the board you're good. As you level.its harder to level again so if you're behind it now you're in trouble and need to play catch up. The extra dailies and weeklies won't affect the speed at which the event ends nor where you should be. Just be in front and keep up from there.
---
Alright thanks figured I'd ask i never knew how rare some of the stuff was and never kept things.
---
Except it would mess up with the lore. Wouldnt it? Iirc, the BOS does not know of the existence of the Enclave until Fallout 2.
---
I think everyone is looking forward to a bit of chill. So much has been going on and it'll be nice to just dig in, knock out some queens/Colossus and rebuild or inventory. That's what I'm doing to prepare for the next board game
---
You can get the home defence perk for better turrets.  You don‚Äôt have to use it all the time, you can swap it out.  While turrets are not great, they will deal enemies who come up and attack directly.  Level 4 turrets won‚Äôt cut it anywhere except for the Forest.
---
My worst experience was when a Scorched was doing indirect fire with a grenade launcher.
---
High?! I feel like they lowball most decent items on Xbox. Try and get a TSE handmade for 10k caps
---
I run a full health build as well, with Vamp weapons. I had 3 Vanguard pieces, but have since gone with a mix. 1 chameleon, 1 bolstering, 1 vanguard, 1 troubleshooter, 1 zealot. Lose a bit of overall DR/ER, but I'm still over 325 each, and I like the mix. Run buttressed for best results.
---
Bug since beta when dailies have atoms. One of the top bugs most complained about and reported.
---
Takes less than that to glitch.  The drops are usually meh at best and I can get more exp killing ghouls in the Toxic Valley than robots in the silo.
---
Alright thank you!
---
Honestly their hard work and dedication has made nuking possible for many. Wouldn't care much about nuking if it took that much work. Definitely a big thank you.
---
Every time I‚Äôve done it today, I farm screws and loot until the timer runs out...And then I‚Äôm teleported outside. No dying involved
---
There is a YouTuber named Rifle Gaming that is...obsessed I suppose, with launching nukes.  He has videos covering literally every facet of the process up to an including whether or not you can survive a nuke by jumping inside the hatch when it opens.  Might be worth a look.
---
Haha I was in that server! Did you make someone mad? I wondered why someone would send a nuke squarely at your base.
---
Man, I need to figure out how magic shotguns work.
---
Completed about 40, never failed once, played with all levels, carry everyone every event(even ppl lvl 500+), I'm lvl 772 Power Armor/Heavy build....love watching the bloodied guys who think they are badasses get smashed every 30 seconds and get 60 second death penalty spawn wait timers üòÜ
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôve been helped a bunch of times.   Especially just getting started.   Pay it forward when you can.   I sometimes go down to the overseers camp and drop like stimpacks, and food, water... maybe make an awesome pipe gun of some sort for the next player coming out of the vault.    It‚Äôs totally about the community.
---
Well this became an a witch hunt on low level players. I get the frustration. But they want to play too. And if we start going off that these players are not worth the effort. Then less players less content will be released and game will die off quicker. And there about to lose bulk players with the nerf. So they can‚Äôt afford to shoot both feet before it heals the first.
---
I just want the stupid tenderizer but the drop chance on that plan is like -.0001%
---
Take a break
---
Yeah, high. It's a joke what the pricing is like on there. The dev admitted themselves that they don't base it on in-game pricing at all and just the trade groups.
---
Was just about to mention terraria. This would be a pretty great addition to the game I think.
---
True, I need to stash my .45 again I think, and subscribe to First since im carrying my legendaries due to storage.
---
Ok, thanks. I'll keep hold of it all for a while then. Only problem I find is that some people will sell things for tens or hundreds of caps, and others for thousands so it's hard to know what it should be üòÇ
---
The Legendary Run ends at noon on Tuesday, September 8th, which is exactly ten weeks from when it started. 
---
Zorbo‚Äôs ship should get to the end of the board on September 6th.  
---
It‚Äôs a weird discrepancy, granted. If you want to be on the safe side, try to be done by noon on Sunday September 6th.
---
I think I'll be going Colossus, but I need to know first how to launch a nuke. I'm level 156 but I haven't done it yet, haha.
---
You: The event is super easy
---
Also you: Increasing respawn time is ridiculous i.e. you die a lot
---
The spawns often have stims, so you can replenish them as you go.
---
Have to wait until after next month after the second helping is unlocked unless they give different rewards for that one, which I doubt they will
---
Run silos and nuke weird places.
---
What tier do you think would be a tier as of today to be able to make it to 100?
---
This is the sort of shit that shouldn't even get past automated testing.  They've had these sorts of bugs before; they should have checks run at commit to confirm weapon skins conform to the expected parameters and refuse the commit if they're broken in a known way.
---
i personally love the commie fence, but a bit of warning. it cannot be shot. it can be shot through, NPC melee attacks can still destroy it
---
If you pay to move camp it removes it from placement and budget easy peasy
---
Once again, who are you kidding? Serious discussion... lol
---
You just wanted to complain about something and get people to agree with you.
---
It bothers me how dishonest you are with yourself.
---
Just play the event, you will 100 percent get it if u pkay it enough
---
This &lt;3 I'll take this suggestion to heart. I might login a bjt because Meat Week but I'll chill. I did grind a lot on this board because I started late (2 weeks late), that's probably why I'm itching for more. Ammo farming and SBQ/Collosus and chill.
---
The only grievance I could possibly come up with was that I had refused to engage in some PvP with someone.   But then,  I didn't remember the name of the instigator nor did I happened to catch who had launched the nuke,  so I don't even know if there's any real correlation there or not.
---
Ok thank you! Do you think I would have to be in the 80's or 90's to be able to hit max?
---
Agreed I‚Äôve just dosed Bethesda‚Äôs servers for this garbage
---
I have not been able to try it out but my friends have done it twice on PS4, he is level 197. He saw level 44 and level 37 there. In both of those times he failed the event.
---
There's a piece on the board? Oh my lord I never noticed that haha! I feel so stupid!
---
I don't know, but I am not complaining.
---
Probably gonna be a new feature in Fallout 1st Ultimate Edition
---
The note said they were going to clean up...for the love of God, don't do anything to discourage them.  We've seen that 150-200 years in the future NO ONE cleans ANYTHING.  If we're careful we might be able to create an alternate timeline where sweeping and dusting aren't lost technologies. :)
---
Other than grinding meat week rewards, just kick back and chill out. You've earned it.
---
A Colossal Problem isn't going anywhere so no rush for that. Might as well ease up and enjoy other games you may have neglected until the next major content drop comes along.
---
So there's a thing called luck: some people say it doesn't exist, but when the purveyor blesses you with a three star bloodied, explosive, +1 strength pump shotgun, you find out it's very real. Add on two shotgunner cards (yes, this is not even me at my full strength, I still need to level up some more), four demolition cards for explosive damage, and use vats (shotguns are weird, in vats they do proper damage, but if you aim normally it just does fuck all) and the right mutations, and you're a death machine. Weirdly, my secret service armour seemed to affect my damage output drastically. When I was in stealth armour, the gun did jack shit, even in vats. But when I used my normal armour, it was extremely powerful.
---
A meta build means it‚Äôs a good build that is high dmg output or great in other ways a non meta build mean it isn‚Äôt meta or good and is either below average or crap
---
Lol don't feel stupid. I didn't know what it was either for about half the game. There's a dial on the bottom of the game that shows when he'll move next as well.
---
All you need is a nuclear keycard. You can use the enclaves bunker at the whitespring to help you locate one. Then you do a nuke run at one of the silo sites. Nukacrypt normally has the codes for the launch decoded so you won't need to waste time trying to decode that yourself. You should watch some on YouTube to get a feel for it before you do it. I've only done about 6 nuke runs, it's rewarding everytime honestly.
---
I logged in during Fasnacht once and must have joined the world at the same time as someone else because our tents were fused together. They were at 90 degree angles from each other so you couldn't actually use either one.
---
Unfortunately turrets won‚Äôt shoot through it.  But I like how it looks compared to the generic wooden one I use
---
I'm not too sure but I think high 80s is where you want to be.
---
Based Vertibird poster.
---
Anyhow, best part about each week like this is that there is less and less possible datamined shit they can possibly put up before they run out and have to release that.
---
Yikes I'm only in the high 70's I don't think I'll make it.. bummer.
---
Not really, the event just works. There are however ways to make your run at it more efficient and understanding the esoteric "rules" will help with that. People can stand on the fence if they like, but it would be better if they were aware of ways to make the event easier. I have better things to do then shoot thousands of rounds into the sky, like chase down a holotape from a dead nobody because I found a corpse on the road.
---
Idk what platform you're on but if you can get a friend to help you can move some of the trash legendaries to an alt acct. This way you don't have to pay for 1st. You can make up to five characters per Bethesda acct. I have first and still use this method
---
If you are currently at about Rank 87, you should be able to get to Rank 100 by the end. 
---
[This doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview) has been very helpful to many people.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about builds until you hit level 50 and have all the perk cards potentially unlocked
---
I've been wearing the Santa beard for so long that I forgot that it wasn't my characters actual beard. 
---
The character creation beards look nasty...
---
I would love for more variety in facial hair, or hair in general to be honest.
---
Keep pushing and if you feel like you're not going to make it and want what's left you can buy rank with atoms. I think it's 150 per rank. Just do every daily and weekly. I did my friend's acct for her today and went up 4 levels just from today's dailies and weeklies.
---
It's not so much that they were hurting anyone, it's that they chose to NOT HELP anyone.  This is especially egregious in this particular case because they could just have easily been AFK on the drums or meat spits and actually contributed to a successful event with exactly the same (i.e. zero) effort.
---
So disappointing they are static
---
I don't understand why there isn't a minimum level requirement to *so many* things in this game. Events *and* quests.
---
I'm on PC, and unfortunately my friends quit the game, so I'm playing solo. I'll try to look for one though, that's a good suggestion!
---
Similar experience too, I cleared this earlier this week and there were only two of us, I was level 80 and the other player a level 150.
---
Devious XD
---
Rarity is so up in the air in this game. I think RN the mask is in high demand because it's new. But once we do the event enough everyone will have a few.
---
This
---
So have they added anything to help identify the Treasure Mole Miners for deaf and hard of hearing players?
---
It‚Äôs going for thousands. Like tens of
---
Picklock and hacking rank3.  U can bypass the reactor room.
---
Thanks for the tips guys, I wouldn't have thought of that
---
Die by spawning in a nukezone without power armor or get surrounded by 88109981 enemies after the queen scream or even run to a fire spot in colossal wendigo event doesnt make it hard , just frustrating 
---
Btw spawning in a nukezone without power armor while a event happen can be a pain in the ass cuz you will die without a chance of leaving the area.
---
Well the system sucks , events used to be a lot better without this system.
---
September 19th and 20th, the Autumnal Equinox.
---
I mean, because, obviously.
---
I wish there was a way to tell the normal weapons and the cursed weapons apart. Since there isn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs really no need to keep them and display them since you can just use the base weapon type (harpoon, shovel, pickaxe)
---
That happened my first time too. Had to relog and start the raid again. Worked second time for some reason.
---
The game is a flawless masterpiece for sure tho
---
1. AAEP Lever Action
---
2. Z40 Gat Plasma
---
I run a bloody two handed melee build! I use unyielding armor minus one piece with an auto stim perk, it‚Äôs definitely helped me out some, I‚Äôm only level 79, but I do hella damage- I‚Äôm still shuffling my perks around to optimize my build though. I put a lot into AP because my damage resistance is shit, so my go to is ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt die if they can‚Äôt hit you‚Äù I keep a gun on me to be able to hit from afar that way you still get AP when it goes down. I‚Äôve mostly concentrated on killing the wendingo spawn. Not glorious, but I like to think it‚Äôs helpful.
---
There are some bags on the new river gorge bridge that you should be able to get even at a low level with little effort, a few low level scorched and some bugs. Just hop servers until for have enough.
---
also fair. But in the beginning, if there‚Äôs several low levels taking up spots we can at least bounce and perhaps start another instance.
---
Boy do I have some good news for you
---
I hate how bombastic the current one is. I‚Äôd prefer something more toned down
---
There are a number of reshade mods on the Fallout 76 Nexus that might (or might not, it's subjective) be helpful.
---
I agree the rep grind is stupidly timegated, but really? What‚Äôs the point of exploiting your way through it? There‚Äôs no reward in that. The completion isn‚Äôt legitimate, and you risk getting your character banned.
---
Also, i‚Äôd you‚Äôd like to compare perks etc my inbox is open! I haven‚Äôt met another bloody melee build üòÖ
---
It seems better than constantly having to put up with way too few in the group.
---
There should be some kind of level restriction though so you don't end up with players who can't help at all.
---
Tbh I gave up on buying it for now and I'm going to do the event as much as possible for the next week before I start trying to purchase it if I don't have it by then
---
LOL I was literally telling this to a friend about half an hour ago after seeing [this](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1298335583555772420) RT of the bunch of people in cow costume. This game has such a weird approach to outfits. We keep getting bunches of creepy masks and weird fursuits and completely out-of-place costumes. With some utter drab numbers mixed in. Not sure where they think they're going with all these idiocies tbh.
---
It's almost like mannequins would be perfect.
---
(\*wink\*)
---
But only if you preorder then 10 year deal
---
The same thing happened on the main quest just after beta, I was only like level 20, and the main quest broke and wouldn‚Äôt let me continue. I quit the game for about 6 months after that one, we‚Äôll see if I go back tomorrow to complete the vault raid
---
I see where you're coming from. What I don't think is fair is that I did all of the raider missions and did their dailies frequently. Even giving them the majority of the heist payout, and it didn't even get me through friendly.
---
i said in the post that i expect people to disagree with me. I am also not compaining, I am confused about this that's why i started a disussion about it to hear different types of arguments. Yours was PVP IS SHIT SO EVERYBODY THAT LIKES THAT IS AN ASSHOLE. You seem like you misunderstood the whole point of this.  
---
There are people in this thread that also put up arguments against pvp in pvp zones but they  formulated it in a polite manner and if you read them you know that i saw their arguments and accepted them. That is how discussion goes. You are just trying to start a fight not discuss.
---
Just went through it right now... We failed missing like 4%. Lost at least 5K ammo Ultracite 5mm, about 40 Stimpacks... Some other aid.. I was calling the moat agrro and died many times :-(
---
Pistols are unfortunately the worst damage dealers in the game. I‚Äôm not saying they shouldn‚Äôt get a buff, but I don‚Äôt they‚Äôre unable to help in CP. Tagging Earle and killing wendigos is important too. And this coming from someone who just struggled through leveling a bloodied gunslinger and is only now reaching the damage cap.
---
The framerate drops happen even without Teslas, patch 21 messed up server stability in general!
---
It happened to me
---
The price is crazy to me, it's the highest subscription price for a game in Australia I've seen!
---
Incredible, no?  900 to 300.
---
Same here. I don‚Äôt have any vampire, but my biggest issue is the minions. I get cornered in poison areas by them, and I can‚Äôt one-tap them.
---
Talk about gatekeeping..
---
A meta build would be one that is built around min-maxing 
---
You don't have to min-max to not be useless,
---
The bias towards bloody commandos on this subreddit is ridiculous. I'm a Power armor/ heavy guns. Don't make assumptions.
---
Xbone here, I‚Äôd like to thank those players that dropped plans, ammo, stims and other aid off at railroad stations. And a super big thank you to whoever dropped those legendaries in a jack o lantern loot bag at the overseers house during Fasnacht, it helped out tremendously!
---
Agreed.  I've also been unimpressed with all the 'clean' items.  For stuff having sat neglected for 20 years, there sure is a lot of sparkly new items floating around.  I'd definitely buy more stuff from the shop if it had more stuff that looked like it belonged in a nuclear wasteland.
---
Shhh don't ruin the surprise! üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Us Aussies should rise up! Tell bethesda that they should make our price the same as the Americans!
---
You mean they base it on what people really buy and sell items for rather than the Bethesda suggested prices? I dunno man in my experience they‚Äôre more often lowish than high. Caps ain‚Äôt worth much dude. Getting 30k caps is much easier than landing a TSE handmade.
---
Don't forget the fast travel bug too, so even if you finally manage to hit the node you probably wont even fast travel anyway.
---
I love 3:00 to 3:20 in this video hahaha
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I totally agree that the system sucks ass and needs major restructuring. I just don‚Äôt think that justifies exploiting your way around it. I‚Äôm not judging you or anyone who does it personally because it‚Äôs just a game, but I think the grind is more rewarding because you‚Äôve put the time in. Just my two cents.
---
Dude don't make the cap 50, I had a bunch of useless level 50s in my instance and stood around and did nothing. Make the cap 100.
---
We, i dont Just tag earle. I have both suppressor and Tenderizer on to help weaken the boss and wendigos since the Gauss Pistol's blast does AoE damage
---
I also have bloody mess shared when Im in a public team.
---
Omg lmao that must've looked fucked up dude as well as the timing dude
---
I‚Äôm so jealous. I‚Äôm level 89 and wasted all my stimpaks and billets like a dummy.
---
Try relogging. Instanced interiors only save your progress at the end or when you get the "instance checkpointed" message. The upshot of this is that if you run into a bug, you can effectively roll back to the start of the instance section and try again. Almost like reloading a save in a singleplayer game.
---
Most people already run Bloody Mess, does it stack or something?
---
I was wondering why it required circuits to craft, get it now
---
Willing to help out as well!
---
Oh yeah, that makes sense, for it's little voice box
---
Happened to me as well. It repacked all the cards I had, then they must have reappeared cuz when I opened them all they were duplicates. Was lvl 80ish so I had alot, got points for all of them and was able to buy the last 6/7 cards I hadn't gotten yet.
---
Getting rid of notes if you have a lot of those should make a difference. It did for me, though if you happen to have the Fashnacht  analysis notes you will have to put them in you vendor as you can't take them back out of your stash.
---
The pass is also on PC, I‚Äôm playing the game pass version on PC. Takes like 1 week to hit level 50
---
Hell I‚Äôve seen more reclaimed gas masks than I‚Äôve seen those things and the gas mask has the lowest drop chance m
---
People are getting booted out of it on death so it may not even be deliberate. He may well be as incensed as you but for different reasons
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Mostly just looking for hunting-rifle-like weapons. The Hunting Rifle is the one gun I can't seem to find, but used to use when I was Level 1.
---
Enjoy the next 12 days of peace.
---
Are you stacking meats and aid? I usually have 4 meat buffs and 4 aid buffs and I do around 600?dmg with unstoppable monster, if your feeling crazy I‚Äôd pop nuka shine
---
Yeah. Even Warframe has a post finish reward. Lots of people here feel this way.
---
Did it for the first time today and was actually super disappointed, the extra wait time for this made it even less worth the wait. My frame rate went down to the point where I'd be getting hit and my health bar would go down between frames and I'd die. Idk if it's the game, or my Xbox but I know it's not my internet. Just not worth it honestly
---
It's not yet working on the SS Camo Underarmor.
---
It looks so cool but I mute my headphones at any CAMP with it installed.
---
True, I am gonna choose to believe that was it
---
Allow us to drop n share repair kits would be better. My mule has 80plus repair kit n i cant drop it for my main character...
---
Oh I know definitely cool ones. Shitty lower players to actually I had a level 18 troll me just yesterday.
---
I usually don‚Äôt, mainly because it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Honestly I haven‚Äôt seen either of these events in a while on PC.
---
Even when I hit the 800 I get w/psychobuff, adrenaline, and Nuka dark, it seems like I‚Äôm doing nothing.
---
The Colussus is a little harder to run melee because of the falling debris that does quite a lot of damage but
---
In total I do 1155 damage per swing
---
I have:
---
 
---
‚Ä¢ Bloodied Grognak Axe
---
‚Ä¢ emergency protocols on X-01 power armor
---
‚Ä¢ 16 strength
---
‚Ä¢ Nerd Rage
---
‚Ä¢ Every single mutation (In my opinion the benefits vastly outweigh the cons if you have class freak and strength in numbers perks)
---
When I power attack the scorch beast queen or colossus I deal like 1 or 2% of their health bar. Not bad considering I don't have to worry about ammo
---
I'm pretty sure it did, I can test tonight to see.
---
You could probably sell it for quite a bit right now, but it will lose value as people run the event more. Just depends if you want to use it
---
Just interact with it to turn the flames off until you want the flamrs back on
---
That reminds me, there's this level 8 charged immediately after the rubles cleared up and jump down to his death, asking players to revived him. Haven't start shooting anything yet x'D
---
Name my levers bob lee swagger every time
---
Oh boy. I'm hyped.
---
I want the flame animation at all times, just quieter. Is that asking for so much lol
---
Yeah I just need to remember the timer means nothing it‚Äôs just there to scare everyone. 
---
Thanks on the tip
---
I almost feel like they're hearing my prayers!  Two weeks ago I was wishing for another opportunity to buy the Thanksgiving display (had it on Xbox) and then they put it in the store.  Now that I have a great house that's fun to decorate, I was really wishing I could restore my plush collection...voila!
---
Ya lets be honest, I would say MOST people level 100+ have some type of god tier weapon (on PC). I solo'd this event the other day, was not all that hard, to be honest Queen is harder for me because of the flying and because of my color blindness. If you have 1 person with god tier weapons this event is not hard at all. As long as there is 1 person there with good gear, I don't really see the issue with low players. If your over 100 and don't have a god tier on pc you are trying not to. If you can not figure out how to get them, just take a day (it might be boring) and vendor hop. I see them all the time. Its basically all I do now in 76 is vendor hop finding cool stuff to give to low players.  It does put a little more pressure on that 1 person but seriously who cares. Bring a ton of ammo and AIM FOR THE HEAD!
---
Given bethesda, possibly...lol
---
Single item.  A gold one came out later and then I think there was a rocket one?
---
I disagree with the no-buy thing. That‚Äôs kind of a finger to people who might be forced by auto complete. 
---
Or do it for a short time post season, or don‚Äôt enable it for a certain time. People who XP glitched through it would be able to get way more than people who did it legit.
---
It won't show up if you have a skin applied to it.
---
They would make it a daily limit, and you have to choose between getting the rep or getting that day's bullion lol
---
It is not entertaining enough due to sponginess. The real challenge is to cause real damage unless you are using one of the 2 or 3 meta builds.
---
Like having thin walls in an apartment complex, I'd imagine
---
Omg....how did i miss that....
---
Hah, yeah. When this first popped up in the shop, I started seeing it in player camps (didn't buy it myself, not my kinda aesthetic). But I noticed in all the player camps nobody had it hooked up to power. I thought hmm... bit strange.
---
Then I eventually arrived at a player camp who *did* have it hooked up to power, and instantly realized why the others hadn't done so. lol
---
That stinks, but only if you want all of the plush.  I just have a couple that I want so I'll be happy to buy them individually.  ...until Beth releases all of them for less than what I'm paying anyway.  lol
---
Its bad even without the lag. I've done it 5 times so far, and I've died at least 3-4 times from absolutely nothing. No rock, no poison, just death.
---
Haha gauss minigun go brrrr
---
The reclaimed deep mining helmet is the rarest drop from ACP at 5% chance to drop, congrats.
---
Sadly doesn‚Äôt have a matching outfit but the Insurgent Outfit and Black Shovel Backpack look really good with it. Gives off a Mole Miner before mutation vibe.
---
I always feel so bad when this happens!  (Aside from when it happens in areas where I needed to kill those creatures myself for a challenge or something...lol)
---
I'm pretty sure console has just always had more players. Probably because physical copies get passed to owner to owner. 
---
My friend plays on PC and said how he would rarely see new players/low levels but on Xbox every server or two there would be a few really low levels. I imagine it's due to the thing I said earlier. Physical copies. I'm also referring to before gamepass. After gamepass nuclear winter matches are instant and now there are droves of noobies. It's awesome
---
Oh I see now. Now I wish I rather rolled strangler heart instead
---
Im on pc and I carry my Harry Potter pew pews to Earle just in case the group I'm with gets a little overwhelmed.  Low levels do come and I don't blame them it's great XP and they can build a character up quick doing so. I know when I was starting out I was always in a high level players way but I learned a lot from them so I welcome newbie.
---
Another week, another day my atoms sit in my pocket
---
Sounds like what was happening to me. I‚Äôd see one windigo, it would freeze up, then I had 4 on me wailing away. I hope it gets better for you friend, good luck out there.
---
Just imagine trying to get an owlet plush...
---
I was level 65 first time I joined that event. Barely made a dent doing anything. Can't imagine anyone below level 60 doing anything besides dying over and over.
---
I‚Äôm in ps4 pro and I never had frame rate issues.
---
Even my base PS4 didn‚Äôt shudder much in there.
---
You should clean up your PS4 with organize data base or something.
---
I do this every 3 to 6 months as well as clean the insides of it.
---
You can‚Äôt find a good high health build because high health builds are not good. You can try junkies but a low life junkies is always better than a full life one. And if you go low life, why not be bloodied instead and deal more damage? That‚Äôs why bloodied is the only build in the game
---
On a secondary note you stumbled upon the best way to ensure you do not sell or scrap an item you do not want to lose.
---
Just 3? Your suffering hasn't even begun...
---
Nice.
---
Find the plans for them and make and scrap a bunch of them.
---
level 59 and can tear down the toughest enemies in the game in just a couple of minutes. could've done the same thing if I had my equipment and weapons at level 20 that I have now. everybody should be able to play, those who are below level 50 not doing anything are alright, they just came to get xp and stuff which is smart.
---
I literally wasted all my caps the last 3 days doing the event and buying the recall cards, still have no plan...
---
Lol I mean today. I've read the horror stories
---
It's the gorrilas section, super weird
---
Honestly, maybe try a junkies non vats on PA. Might work, good damage reduction with the PA and easy to build. Downside is no vats
---
5 points to add whatever you want. If you are lucky with perk activation you may be able to vats.
---

---
I feel your pain a few meatcooks left and no plan. Doubles of everything else
---
I was doing the quest in wastelanders where you get the deathclaw egg and the death claw was level 15 and I was level 5. A level 300 comes blaring out of nowhere and destroys it and did the same thing. Disappeared without a trace.
---
Weird, I am able to cripple his head fine with a with explosive Cmando and Heavy weapons.  Not saying Explosive has anything to do with it I just prefer them for the extra chance to trigger Tormentor and OGA.
---
fall through while annoying not as bad as it being in the ceiling... not fun either way.
---
Yep I've thrown in the towel for the night. I wonder since the new patch if the servers are filling up too fast or overloaded
---
I lost all my .308 ammo to inventory to stash transfer. I rage quit a whole week
---
And a couple of instruments.... there‚Äôs a damn sleeping bag in the trailer
---
How? I‚Äôve literally wasted all my caps over the last 3 days buying the recall card and grinding the even without getting a single plan
---
I take this as the Wendigo Colossus is immortal, so lets do something morbid. Nothing like chopping off its heads and mounting them on a stick for everyone to see.
---
I literally couldn‚Äôt find the exit. Didn‚Äôt help that my character was getting staggered every 5 seconds. Also none of the wendigo had any drops? Is that normal? Earl didn‚Äôt either.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the stealth boys. There the stealth suit anyway.
---
I would like some peek coins.
---
We have a really good chance for the second helping of meat week so I am not despairing just yet.
---
It‚Äôs even more morbid because we know that this is just some guys dad who got trapped and mutated...
---
They're still only on the Test Servers.
---
There's a lot of problems to work out with them still.
---
I‚Äôve done hundreds.....my record is 12 in one night
---
Instead of whining, raise your game. Tnere‚Äôs a guy on here taking Earle down in less than 60 seconds, solo.
---
They turn on again whenever you or someone else fast travel to your camp... I just disconnected the power to mine
---
If it doesn‚Äôt that‚Äôs where your loss in damage is probably coming from. 9 points of Charisma could be spent better elsewhere maybe. We also have Tank Killer coming for pistols, which should help.
---
Can comfirm, happened to me twice out of the 10 times ive tried
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I‚Äôd be willing buy one after I get caps again
---
I dig it, I like prefer the helmet we already have tho
---
Xbox, unfortunately
---
Im also constantly playing in a team of 4 others, and I know they arent running it, so it's on by default.
---
Yeah bc fuck the lvl 40's who r just trying to help and have wasted 1000's of ammo and atleast 25 guns per fight, yeah fuck the ppl trying to help thier friends or actually get to said lvl 50. I get it u wanna get easy loot and grind the shit out of the event but keep in mind ppl (including me) have grinded and grinded for days getting enough ammo and guns to even particpate in the event while atleast 3 cunts where sitting back after shooting once meanwhile im going in with. My. Fucking. Fists.
---
And lets not forget that we've also skinned and gutted him just to decorate our camp. Sometimes I worry about our characters.
---
Forgot about that, we get this again in a month
---
There‚Äôs a distinct disadvantage while you‚Äôre using the Chinese Stealth Suit - your DR and ER are capped to I believe 140 each. If you‚Äôre spotted, you‚Äôre dead in a tenth of a second from a somewhat decent commando build. You‚Äôre not getting your ass/sent damage reduction bonuses. You‚Äôre also not able to remain invisible while you sprint. Stealth Boys make an already potentially very difficult to kill thing even harder to kill because you can‚Äôt see it. Imagine if Scorched Conquerers used stealth boys.
---
I died and didn't lose any of my 400 screws
---
Thank you kindly for your help I thought I was losing it
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied and I rarely die. There are spots In the mine you can avoid the acid and falling debris.
---
I only use about 8 to 10 ult cores for the event. Seems fine since it‚Äôs supposed to be a hard event.
---
The screws part though. Your not supposed to be fully focused on collecting screws to begin with.
---
I just hope the junk walls come around by themselves
---
Same here I had 40 packs to open...I figured better open them before they take them back
---
All I want is an option that lets me defend myself at workshops and lets me kill wanted players. I don't want to accidentally initiate PvP, but I also don't want to be burdened by slow menus when someone's coming my way to kill me.
---
Don't be a dick with it.
---
I‚Äôll give it a try, although I‚Äôve never had an issue before today. Thanks.

Your red triangle above your head doesn‚Äôt show up at all and Berry‚Äôs don‚Äôt work either. So it‚Äôs got more of an advantage then you say.
---
How‚Äôs this sound: 
---
I‚Äôll make you a lvl 30 Brotherhood Recon Rifle, lvl 30 The Fixer, a full set of lvl 30 BoS Combat armor (choose a mod), Shielded Under-armor of your choosing (sans Raider), and a Marine Tactical Helmet along with some aid and ammo. 
---
All I ask is when you outgrow the gear or decide to quit playing, you pass them on to a lower level player and if possible, request the same as I have of you. 
---
Fair?
---
I hit it today and I‚Äôm happy to take a break personally.
---
If you die during the event (even the run out of the mine) you won't lose your junk. Sounds like you died after the event ended?
---
I'm still waiting for the Merc outfits from 3 and NV lol
---
That‚Äôs reasonable. And according to some testing of my own, and a little bit of research, Bloody Mess does not stack when shared. No perk card does unless it‚Äôs lockpocking or hacking. Strange in numbers seems to stack sometimes, but that‚Äôs probably unintentional.
---
I died a TON of times and was surprised when I got back to my camp after we failed the event...I didn't lose any screws. I just assumed since I died and didn't spend time looking for my death bag, they were gone...but nope, they were there!
---
I‚Äôm rooting for her dad.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd use it like on the Colossus if we have like 4 minutes or less left and he still has most of his health. Basically a last resort.
---
Either a Wendigo was very, very bored, the ghosts did some magic, or one of the miners before they were bored wanted almost anything to do other than sit there.
---
Still, it‚Äôs a fun encounter.
---
YES. I had about 75 pounds of plans on my character (before sony scammed me. All my progress is gone now)
---
This. Was gonna say it but you beat me to it. No way people should be able to milk it.
---
I ran that event quite a bit and never got the plushie yet. I asked a friend to make one for me.
---
You waste more resources being non bloodied. Pretty much it
---
Excuse my naievety, but why do ppl do this? Just for the loot?
---
A better backpack would keep it from coming loose.
---
Hunters long coat looks very good with it
---
So many outfits need this.
---
GOT EM
---
That is true. I struggled and I‚Äôm around level 118. I do use melee builds which don‚Äôt help against him much but I can 2 shot the wendigo spawn. What if they made it that to unlock colossal problem you need to have completed a missile silo? I beat my first missile solo around level 35-40 but I struggled and took so long that someone else launched a nuke out of that silo making me need to restart twice.
---
I would like it if they made it weekly and have everything reset at the same time.
---
I haven't even bothered doing the Colossal Problem event on a public server with randoms. 
---
The SBQ is a big enough waste of bullets on public servers. Earl would just be a nightmare.
---
Stick to privates with squad mates who are actually decent.
---
It's a frustrating system! I'd love a weekly limit, maybe if you hadn't been online the dailies limits accumulated up to a weekly cap... 
---
Simply changing it to the same reset as dailies would make an enormous difference as well
---
Honestly sorry all the fucking try-hards aren't getting what thry want immediately with what would be their one shot weapons in the regular game play. It must be really hard.
---
This event is fucking stupid anyway. I did it yesterday for the first time with two other people in their hundreds and I think we still had two or three minutes left. My weapons all suck so that means two people completed it in more than enough time. Maybe everyone can stop being a fucking Cry-Baby about their 14th or 15th round of Rewards.
---
What intrigues me is how it can still be utterly broken after being delayed so long, it's the buggiest event I've ever taken part in this game!
---
This is one of my favorites as well.  It‚Äôs solid gold, just like the insult bot!
---
Maybe try defending it?
---
Don't give them ideas for the love of all that is atom!
---
Nice first run.
---
That rug really ties the room together.
---
Ya I complained about it only being 20 atoms not long ago but at least it‚Äôs more then what it was.
---
Vanguard sentinel/cavalier whatever 3rd Star. Ap refresh is best
---
I was thinking this earlier. I had to put a bunch of radios down to drown out the noise.
---
So like the terraria banner system?
---
Looks like a sinkhole opened up beneath that poor person while they were on the toilet. The teddy bears were going in to try to save them. It is a wholesome moment with a tragic outcome.
---
Min-maxing is all about dmg if you aren‚Äôt doing a lot of dmg you aren‚Äôt a meta build because your build isn‚Äôt the best or one of the best
---
I have heavies...but after doing it the first time...im unarmed. i deal with the wendingo mobs
---
They focus on Earle (get your shots in at least...i dont think you need to do min. damage to loot the body)
---
i mop up the stragglers
---
also stimpack diffusers are nice
---
cant do anything about the scream stuns that send you into the debris
---
Big if true
---
It isn't even a cackle... Its just a staff twirl!
---
That Grelock icon has some supreme smugness to it.
---
TLDR: Just don‚Äôt enjoy the game on a way I don‚Äôt approve or I‚Äôll spend my free time to FCK you up
---
Hit me up on PC sinofsociety
---
I‚Äôm online right now
---
I had one dis me about killing insult bots when I killed the last one.
---
Yeah I'm generally the only full health build in a team. While my damage is less, my survival is higher and it's well synergised with a bloodied group imo.
---
In MMO I play heals and support, so in this game while I manage the Wendigo babies I make sure nobody stays down for long if they get hurt. Leave the DPS to the DPS kids, and make sure to emote to I see you're down. If there's no Wendigo, I'll empty every magazine I have into Earl. 
---
It truly 'just works'.
---
Makes me think that America wasn't actually hit that hard at all, just one or two major cities.... Its the 76ers that messed up the rest of the country!
---
if I have a year to waste I could do it
---
PVP isn't for everyone.
---
Def a missed opportunity. I wish it had swarms of high level Deathclaws.
---
Sounds fair to me. I've mostly just been giving out any leftover gear that I dont need, or materials/food I don't have to new players I find anyways.
---
If you're waiting a minute than you're dying too much. I have that eternal can't respawn glitch. If I die once it's game over. I don't even have the luxury of a count down. Just can't respawn. Stay back a bit get your shots in and stay alive.
---
I sell lvl 50 versions of The Fixer for 500 caps if that‚Äôs agreeable. I can mod it however you‚Äôd like, free of charge. 
---
IGN secalane
---
Probably best to stick to private servers when taking work shops then. I head straight for any occupied workshop
---
Glad it help
---
Updoot for a fellow Grognak
---
Kill your teammates, eat them, then become one with earl.
---
I feel kinda bad shooting it. Poor little guy is just taking a nap in his nest.
---
Yeah I finished yesterday so now I can go back to my eternal search of rare plans and exploring. You know after 1500 hours I still discover Easter eggs and as for atoms I still have robots to kill and photos to take, I do miss the daily atom challenges though.
---
I sell mags at 15 to 20 caps. Bobble heads 50 to 75. I never keep them for long in my vendor. 
---
I usially get a mutation have fun with it and then need to cure my rads and it goes away. 
---
I drink alcohol because it is good for spot on hydration. Have the perk where I cant get addicted and the benefits aren't anything that is useful because it wears off in 5 minutes.
---
So yeah, I play clean and just have fun
---
Cool, lemme know when u are on and I‚Äôll get to crafting.
---
From what I've noticed, the rad "heal" works while the buff is active. My guess is that it has to do with the buff's other effect. I think it was something like "prevents any food loss" while active.
---
Same.
---
Its funny how i can 1 shot swamp fever event with my bloodied/unyielding melee build and end it in like 5 seconds, while a friend of mine with his sneak-godbuild and a perfect fixer needs like 3000 bullets...
---
I know earl has the same hit points no matter what.  But does the number of wendigos scale with the number of players.  If not, every player is helping unless they exceed 8 and prevent another higher level player from joining.  I‚Äôm a level 65 and mainly feel I help by being bait to draw wendigos away from the players who are actually doing damage to earl.   I might take out 8-12 wendigos, but that‚Äôs about all.
---
A "Meta build" is a build specifically built to be meta imo
---
I don't think we disagree on that 
---
But you don't need an optimal build to not be useless, damage in this game gets busted fast
---
It takes more head shots with a handmade than it does ground shots with a Gauss. That's why there are threads complaining about it every day and not the handmade.
---
Another victim of daily challenges
---
Home-shaming the deathclaw
---
My friend helped hold it in place with a Vampires limb damage handy buzzsaw blade! Really kept Earls legs crippled and his health at full!
---
I‚Äôm a noob. Can you go into more detail on this?
---
Taxidermy plans should have been a rare drop of the associated mobs imo, bit to late for that now though.
---
 :-(
---
Not to be a d\*\*\* but what do you expect a tag along lowbie to do...
---
As a shotgunner, I mainly focus on the mobs. I just keep turning in circles looking for red dots on the radar...special perk on my armor and an instigating combat shotgun and I‚Äôm 1shotting the minions. I typically go after the ones that are closest to heavy users....they‚Äôre usually focused on Earle... granted I can‚Äôt kill all of them in there I definitely kill my fare share. You can kind of gauge the downtime in between spawns, that‚Äôs when get my shots in on Earle if I can...then back to minions...I stay busy down there... I actually really enjoy playing a support role... I don‚Äôt know anything about cannibalism, but I know that after big boy is dead... I loot corpses and meat piles until the timer runs out...Pulled 119 and 115 my last two runs. GL man, be safe out there
---
119 and 115 screws*
---
Hey if you need someone to play with I‚Äôm usually on early afternoonish est, my psn is Daddy_Dani_
---
Give this man a sweeping emote.
---
Only if they guarantee a 3 star drop, I'd stop farming legendaries if all this extra effort and I keep getting 1 stars!

Your wasting your time with these people. None of them will admit it, but honestly the PvE community is way more toxic then the PvP community. Were just getting a bad wrap because theyre lumping all their experiences with griefers in with us. The PvP community has no want to fight a PvE player, its too easy. Were looking for a challenge, not to hand someones ass to them who isn't built for a fight. 90% of the fights they've encountered is griefers just looking to ruin someones day, and just assume that's what all pvp is. 
---
I agree with you that its sad that this is what the community has turned into, but it was an inevitable outcome once survival was removed.
---
Game Pass
---
ok thanks! ill add you soon, i have online classes atm lol do you sell plan or weapon?
---
I used to limit myself to two bulked sets of any item and then 50 or less of anything which doesn't bulk (except when I was working on building my Excavator armor, which I had to build one at a time).  Break down everything you pick up, unless you find some decorative item you want to put in a display cabinet in your CAMP (and then accidentally break it down a bazillion times until you finally remember to stop yourself from clicking "scrap all junk"...lol).
---
For Aid, look at what you actually use.  I used to carry a couple of every type of Chem and then realized that I only ever use Rad-X, Radaway, and Stimpaks.  I do keep 2 Buffouts on me just for those times when I'm just a little overweight with stuff I can't drop and need to fast travel.  For alcohol, I kept 2 of each type of alcohol in my STASH for doing the alcohol-related dailies (we also used to have challenges which required alcohol to be drunk in quantity).  I also used to carry several different pre-war foods on me but I realized that I can pick up fresh food so easily that I try to avoid picking up the pre-war stuff anymore.  Sell any of these items you won't be using.  Purified water, you shouldn't need more than 50 of these, probably way less, especially if you have water purifiers in your CAMP.
---
For weapons, start narrowing down what you really want to use.  I used to carry an assortment too so I always had a gun to match the ammo I was always finding.  But then I realized that I could find tons of just about any ammo and started focusing on the weapons themselves, finding the ones that I felt did the most damage for me, that fit my play style (long range or melee), and so on.  I do keep a collection in my wall displays of the named weapons or ones that there are challenges for that I'm not working on right away (putting them on the displays also keeps me from forgetting why I'm keeping them and scrapping or selling them).  Otherwise, scrap every other weapon you find so you can learn the mod plans for free (equip the Scrapper card to get extra junk items when you scrap weapons).  Also, when you narrow down your weapons, just carry ammo for those guns.  I actually found a few guns that used the same ammo which made it a little easier.  
---
For armor, as you go up in level, the legendary armor will start appearing for you.  I also always mod my armor (I prefer deep pocketed, then pocketed, then ultra-light, but I know I didn't have all of those when I was lower level).  Until I started picking up legendary armor (which is then take what you can get if the bonuses are beneficial!), my base armor was leather.  It wasn't very heavy and had great stats.  I always carry a suit of power armor with me (I always carry two fusion cores) but you won't have access to that until level 25.  However, having a hazmat suit is great for getting out of irradiated areas.
---
Look for perk cards which reduce armor, weapon, ammo, junk, and chem weights, but you should be doing good once you go through your STASH with a critical eye.
---
Also a *wow* emote please. When someone has an amazing camp built around the charleston Capitol buildings spire like I saw a week ago I dont just wanna go: love.
---
Playing one MMO that has something similar except once you finish getting the rewards, you compete against everyone else to get into the top 100 in score to get a variant of a future microtransaction item for free.
---
I prefer a SCORE vendor where you can keep on purchasing certain rewards like lunchboxes, fireworks, etc. instead of making dailies and weeklies useless.  
---
Just finished today and it finally nice to just have the Bullion grind to do instead of the SCORE and bullion grinds.
---
Needs to pay 7600 atoms...That‚Äôs like six or seven bundles. If you‚Äôre lucky

Quack doctor outfit.
---
You can also use the prisoner collar with it for a nice red glow.
---
whenever i do these events i feel like the dude with the lil pop gun from Harlem Nights
---
Everything I‚Äôve seen in 76 that‚Äôs meta is all about dmg and dmg output bloodied and junkies are dmg output but bloodied is more widely used because it has higher dmg, TSE was a meta weapon for awhile because of how powerful it was
---
i think 500 is fair thanks!, ill go online soon, still have online classes rn
---
Think it might have something to do with Bethesda releasing the duplicate perk card system so late. Lots of people already had a ton of levels and dupes with no exp credit so they decided to reward people who already grinded out tons of levels when NW first came out.
---
That's my guess anyways.
---
I wish I knew, I love it when that happens. Usually it happens when I‚Äôm cycling too fast on the quick wheel between my heavy and my shotgun
---
Tried to force it at a queen fight and couldn‚Äôt get it to stick
---
I forgot about this!  It took me a long time on my first character to Sort by Weight.  I was horrified because I didn't realize that ore wasn't going into my Junk section but had been building up and building up as I was playing.  lol
---
I'm somewhere in the middle but I can respect some people just don't enjoy PVPing. Occasionally I take workshops looking for a fight but most of the time I just take them for the dailies/weeklies. I usually just let people have the workshop if they want it badly enough to risk a face-off.
---
Edit: I do think that if you take a workshop you should expect you might have to fight for it if you want to keep it. There are plenty of junk farming routes available that yield a lot more raw mats without the PVP.
---
I don‚Äôt have an extra plan, I was just going to give you the weapon.
---
I just don‚Äôt care. I generally only capture them for daily tasks etc. I have fallout first with at least 1000-2000 of every resource I need.
---
My two shot laser gat chews him up in about under 2  min if someone actually covers me from windingos 
---
Last time i ran the event i had 12 wind attacking me AND earl, as they all seem to go after whos delivering largest damage and NO ONE was covering me or reviving me lol. Others were firing at earl and getting no where. Cant lie, its a fun event but a serious amo drain.
---
Then maybe I have horrible luck cause after awhile my death timer increases to around 60 seconds (if I keep dying) then after that if I keep dying I start to loose my junk every time. This on few different servers over past two days, maybe I'm glitched? So no one else is loosing gear after repeated deaths? I don't do bloodied builds but I got nice bloodied railway with faster firerate and it does some pretty good damage, just this dying constantly thing dies I can't see why people do it even with life saving piece.
---
And if it actually paid out promised rewards.... 5 out of 6 attempts I got nothing at all!
---
Considering I went there between level 10-20, and not when I had an end game build and ventured into the perma-low level Forest, no I was not disappointed.
---
Very good. I‚Äôll be on for another hour or so then I‚Äôm off to bed (it‚Äôs gettin late and I‚Äôm old).
---
Definitely
---
I was talking to a guy,on the server I was on last time, and we both did the event and each had it on, but he said a lot more ppl had been wearing it too, so the rng for events must be similar to legendary rolls. Depends on server. In my two runs so far, the first run I got the cursed pickaxe. Second run the reclaimed. Still havent got the chally feed yet from grahm's cookout tho.
---
Edit, I heard of people buying it for $500. To answer your question sort of
---
Yeah in this game meta=damage, so what's your point lol
---
Chally!!!!
---
Seriously?!?!  Guess what I'm doing first thing tomorrow morning!  lol
---
oh ok! ill add you soon, thanks!
---
Haha
---
Most likely just horrible rng
---
This would be much appreciated!!
---
Did event only 3 times and first time got rug then meat pile and last one I got cursed harpoon
---
Used to, this has been broken by a recent patch.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox by the way
---
Maybe not be a leech and go level up
---
Only in Fallout 4.
---
You'd be surprised how much scrap players carry. Sometimes I have to leave the server rather than risk them killing me to get it back. And no one tells them to keep seeking. Caps are caps.
---
You gonna be ok?
---
I'd read it had to do with some combination of Junkies, Furious, Instigating, Stalkers, Medics, Limb Damage, VATS accuracy, Bashing dmg and some augment on armor. But, that is a couple month old bit of info I was reading. And.. well, requires luck which I lack. Damn you Graham! Give me the last mod plans for Tenderizer and it's plan!!
---
i agree this is needed.
---
but i don't know if this thing about "the mod costumes that are out there".... i mean those mods for F04 from nexus? there are probably 10 costumes worth with something special that you really want to pay for
---
the rest 94% are all slutty things for girls/waifus wich I think are pathetic and made for wanker/jerkoff people and represent everything wrong with videogames these days
---
For rare weapons and armor, the optimal strategy is to craft them just so you can scrap them to learn the mods. 
---
The plans for the Lever Action can be found pretty reliably at the robot vendor in Harpers Ferry. They're called Plan: Lever Gun, and they cost about 1500 caps.
---
Give it a couple of months and you‚Äôll probably see a slight return. People will burn themselves out on this event sooner or later.
---
Something more than nothing at all?
---
Yesssss, it's adorable. If you are on ps4 I can build one for you
---
The event is not difficult, just tedious.  It is fine to have 6 low level players in as long as there are two higher level players.  One to DPS the big bad and one to sweep up the little wendigos.  Low level players don't hurt you by being in the event if you're any kind of built in to anything capable of dealing with a boss.
---
If you've failed the event with low level players in, its almost completely on you for either not DPSing or not clearing adds.
---
My buddy and I have run it several times and never failed no matter how many of the other slots are full of "lowbies", who are just trying to get in on a good thing, as they should.
---
No but I have been having problems where the event end won't trigger so I get no rewards...
---
As a full dps build, I can deal up to about 1/8 of Earle's health per reload. But while I'm engaged with him, I am the equivalent of a peeled banana in a monkey cage just sitting there under a spot light in terms of survivability. All I ask of a support is keep the little guys away from me.
---
Edit: as best you can of course, I don't expect them to never get through, I can take one hit and run without serendipity's help. If you are attacking Earle between waves, tenderizer and cryo are a huge service, or even setting him on fire for visibility highlight, because damn it's dark in there and I tend to lose track of him.
---
Still prefer the 100 carry weight.
---
Pretty sure that was a one-time, apology for delaying Wastelanders deal. I wouldn't count on it happening again without some monumental fuck-up on Bethesda‚Äôs part beforehand.
---
&gt;Or a bee's nest
---
Deathclaw's.
---
That would be very useful
---
Why do you need motivation? Turn off your game and do something else. Forcing yourself to play a certain game is not healthy.
---
Come back when you decide to play again. The only thing you lose out on the run is cosmetics and atoms.
---
I agree with this. I get wanting to take part, but they aren't going to be able to contribute in many ways. They are taking up space. While I haven't done the event many times, we barely made it the times I did because it would be a 2-3 high levels and the remaining 4-5 players are lvl 30 or below. It is just annoying how they do nothing and we have to waste 10k rounds of ammo as a full health heavy build to kill it while these low levels constantly just die and get the rewards. I just don't believe it is fair.
---
I'm not but thank you anyway!  I actually found someone selling the plan in their vendor for 5 caps and picked it up the other day.  (Yes, I wished a thousand blessings upon them since I couldn't believe my luck!)
---
Duuuuude
---
Why carry it just stash it, or be in passive so they can't kill you. I stay in passive all the time and stash my scrap as often as possible.
---
Wait you only get it if you sided with the settlers? What do you get for siding with the raiders or taking the gold for yourself ?
---
Wow so lucky
---
Probably that and not wanting to dump thousands or rounds into Earle.
---
Exactly. If someone commits that much time to the game, anything less than 7600 is a kick in the nuts.
---
SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED HOURS!  They could play for 10 hours every day for two years straight and still have another month to go to get to 7600!
---
Have you tried that bash damage on that thing? It‚Äôs a game changer. I‚Äôm glad the devs custom made that one.
---
The purveyor seems to agree.
---
They said in QC they are working on it but not to expect it soon, I agree, seems like a basic thing to add to a game with this kind of perk system ü§®
---
It would have to be a really good reward though. Scrap kits are pretty meh imo.
---
They should make player icons go beneath the event icon on the map so you can simply click the event icon.
---
Oh its weird looking I kinda like it though
---
Worthwhile post
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken you can tame and have animals at you‚Äôre CAMP or some people know how to glitch in a great way.
---
I'm the one robbing them.
---
yeah they will bitch (in live servers) that they need to pay a lof of caps to fast travel to the spawn points 
---
BiThIsDi pLs at least before it was in one region
---
But would it have changed your experience soloing that any? Did it have any ACTUALLY affect you or that encounter in the slightest?
---
They should add hole to climb into that takes you to an underground cavern. Could even have a big main Deathclaw boss event there.
---
Ah yeah that old bug and by old I mean 2015 Fallout 4 old
---
If you don‚Äôt fully complete it you have a chance of getting nothing. Idk if it‚Äôs possible if you do fully compete it though.
---
But I see you only got 2 meat cleavers so I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt fully complete it.
---
They seem to focus on stuff that looks like the modeler wanted to flex their personal creativity more than anything else. Recent example, the Chally outfits are well made but did we really need pink cows walking around the wasteland?
---
You can tell they‚Äôre still capable of good stuff, like the gas mask from ACP. But it‚Äôs rather sparse between the million weird cosplay outfits.
---
I'm with you. I have a bloodied lever with limb damage and perception and with the right perk setup hit around 4000- oneshotting 95 pct of all enemies. 
---
I collect more ammo than I use. I made ammo for the first time in months only because it was a daily.
---
That's only certain animals. I've not been able to find baby mega sloths that haven't already been killed.
---
Maybe this is old hat with you Vets, but I've been playing for about a month, and this seems like something that should have been addressed pretty early on.
---
Worthwhile comment. ;)
---
Two people in a group did this earlier, so I just let the event fail.
---
Same with Grahms event. There was 4 people just stood, so I just let that fail too.
---
Explosives sucked day one, then got hit harder with the perk change since a bunch of whiny assbitch boys complained about legendary expo weapons in PvP...yet here we are no real pvp in the world and still nerfed.
---
That never stopped Bethesda in the past.
---
If you're not feeling it, might just be time to take a break for a few months.
---
I usually really get into an online game hard for about three or four months before taking a breather and playing other stuff and recharging.
---
Don't let the seasons pressure you into staying when you don't want to. There will always be more cosmetics and such down the line.
---
Dang, thought by its description it might have been an evil laugh!
---
Yes, wish there was a whole gaggle of deathclaws there
---
That's what I was hoping too, I'm glad I waited till I saw footage of it.
---
I mean, they've been enough of a problem to be pushed back twice already. Even Bethesda can't put out something as broken as they are.
---
I‚Äôm pissed off atm. A level 300+ nuked the area, never did it before so I reach the boss and I see 2 people at around level 50. Next thing I know I‚Äôm the only one there fighting it. I dwindle his health to a sliver  of health. Try to switch my weapon via the weapon wheel but it‚Äôs laggy as hell and I get killed. Now I‚Äôm stuck on a loading screen and will have to restart. So wasted stimpacks and ammo for mothing
---
I got a Cursed harpoon with Bash..how do you build to make it worth while?
---
Mint build my guy
---
IIRC the Appalachian Brotherhood is out of contact with the main branch at this point, since the comm satellite failed. So long as everyone dies it's fine.
---
I have an hour I give myself. I tell the wife Im going to go do dailies and just spam through it. I'm now lv 144. Started the run at lv 80ish. I haven't even gotten too deep into the wanders storyline because I only have so much time to put into the game. I love the idea behind it, but hate the execution.
---
Taming some animals is available in the game i didn‚Äôt have them all but i can tell you dogs, deathclaws mirelurk king and megasloths are tamable for sure. No baby one tho
---
I've played this game way too much and am only about 1/3 there. No way I'll ever see those atoms. 2800 hours since launch. I play a lot less these days to be fair.
---
But elder maxson is directly related to the upcoming bos dlc
---
5% chance to spawn bees in any hour.
---
F
---
Their making foundation and raider camp free. It‚Äôs in the pts atm.
---
Idm about the caps costs though. If you hate it you should get travel perk that reduces cap cost by 30%.
---
Beats me then, I haven't really been following the new info.
---
Not really
---
I've found myself not wanting to play much lately. Combination of a few things like burn out from the legendary run, not liking the upcoming nerf in update 22 and the fast travel bug which has been tilting me more than it should. Nothing makes me want to Alt + F4 more than fast traveling and having it fail over and over, walk, crouch, jump, eat, drink, try to fast travel again, still fails or game crashes to desktop. Just thinking about it makes me want a Nukashine
---
"major content drop" is a bit of a stretch. Even Wastelanders wasn't major.
---
Weird bug, not complaining. That‚Äôs a level.
---
Why not just go to your player owned location- workshop or other, then fast travel? It‚Äôs inconvenient but it‚Äôs a working system that shouldn‚Äôt detract from trying to fix colossal problem ü•¥
---
How about you just ignore the post since it's obvious your not here to discuss or offer advice.
---
I‚Äôd‚Äôve bought that outfit if it wasn‚Äôt smeared with Free States markings. You have these neat outfits tied to new factions that are worsened by gaudy colours and ugly symbols on them.
---
People diss on the OG factions but at least they had designs that didn‚Äôt look like timmy‚Äôs colouring book. I just can‚Äôt get into these newer designs and outfits when they try to make everything vibrant and eye catching.
---
Yes, whenever the garage is half destroyed the top half of walls and roof is simply gone, everything attached will stay floating. Just destroy them while they‚Äôre floating and then repair it
---
Yes, Inspirational + Public Teams has replaced Lone Wanderer for me now
---
Indeed. It's funny when you compare two games they are responsible for. It's like f76 isn't theirs. Just a couple of dudes sitting in seperate room and scavenging the game, adding more content that is bugged. ü§î
---
My username is HanselZXA add me and sorry for the slow answer xd
---
He was asking why he was in a group of just him and 1 other person even though tons went in, and you didn‚Äôt provide him an answer, meaning you had no reason to comment
---
I miss being able to jack people's clothes in Fallout.
---
It's a glitch. If you quickly switch between weapons the one with the higher ammo capacity will give you that capacity on your other gun.
---
I ain‚Äôt got no damn tree fity
---
They confirmed they are bringing pets besides the current tamable animals
---
So when is treasure hunter event in the normal server then?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Happened to me too just a bit ago. I died and watched helplessly as Earl was destroyed by the rest of the team. Was booted out of the mine with 30 seconds left on the timer to escape. I got the event reward but didn‚Äôt get to loot Earl. Sad.
---
I want some Enclave Tesla armor.
---
How many pieces of unyielding ?
---
Put the flechettes mod on it, it turns it into a magic shotgun.
---
Although literally any other variant of magic shotgun will be better, even the double-barrel, because the harpoon gun needs to reload after every shot which cripples its dps a lot.
---
Insurgent outfit imo
---
I haven't gotten any cursed weapons yet, so your RNG might be bad but it's not zero-weapons bad.
---
It just wasn't really a good idea for me to come back after an 8-month long break, grind about a hundred fasnachts and not get all the masks, grind through this dumb battle pass, and now really have no reason to play the game because I have to grind through a million days of upping reputations for each faction by doing the same to dailies over and over and over. It's just a really poorly designed game with very minimal story.
---
I honestly avoided it until i leveled up a little, i expected to be swarmed. I assumed there was something there that was worth the fight.
---
First time i went there, i sneaked the whole time, checking the bags, peeking around trees, i could see a safe in the distance, worked my way around the island, gotta be something good in there....wait, i see something moving, lock and load!! oh ok, that was it. ok then.
---
I found it way easier with a non stealth Bloodied unarmed melee to stay alive and do a lot of damage compared to my Full Health heavy weapons PA Junkies and bloodied stealth commando.
---
Earle seemed to not pay attention to me as I hacked his legs. He kinda spun in a circle as I circled much like the SBQ.
---
The other two had wendigo spawns after them.
---
Honestly one of the only reasons I play this game is for the dumb cosmetics so they know how to hook me
---
I remember a really well-made mod for NV would have you using a handheld pip boy. Always wished Bethesda would give that aesthetic a try.
---
Seems like a good place if they added a another boss event in like colossus and SBQ.
---
I ran the event tonight for the first time with a team that did it twice in a row. It was great fun. Although I didn't make it out if the mine either time (was close) I got the plushie &amp; the rug, so I was happy!
---
True homie.
---
For real they‚Äôre the real MVP‚Äôs
---
That's funny. My CAMP partner is the settler wander, only wears the Jester mask. I just receive a "What's going on here?" With a glare from my wife.
---
Commando all day, and though that's a good gun you'll want to keep an eye out for a bloodied assault, commando, handmade, or fixer. Silencer is a key mod for bloodied commando builds, sneak gets you a lot more damage. I've got a B FFR 10mm SMG and it's great but pales against larger mobs where I can hide better with silenced guns .
---
I'm wearing the Elder Maxon? coat and it looks nice!
---
Yeah, i then need to go farm more flux to replace the extra ammo i had to spend because that person took 1 of the 8 spots. How is this even a question?
---
Proud owner of five meat piles and one cursed harpoon gun.
---
üò†
---
That sounds incredible!
---
Bet you're happy taking from lvl 1 players,  hope I dont find you in game. I'll be coming for you and your camp, using maxed out wrecking ball park and a shit load of missiles. Fucking scum bag.
---
The caravan atomic shop skin looks great with it, pr the treasure hunter outfit
---
Pretty sure you just buy the chally feed plan from grahm  himself. I think it's always in his inventory.
---
JFC I love you, and your flare is wrong
---
I am new to Reddit. I play fallout 76 and read some of you dipping buttholes complaining about this and that. Eat a bag of ... well whatever scared ya you twatt! I‚Äôm not caring about any of your complaining. It would be nice to meet another ... rifle slugger
---
It just takes longer. Would be a nice QOL change but not necessary by any means.
---
Did people join and then leave? I'm pretty sure it doesn't backfill the player slots who have left, even if they leave right at the start. So you can sometimes end up with multiple instances of less than 8 players, if several people bail.
---
Yeah I saw this last night in a friends camp when it said "Interact" (or something) as I moved my cursor over it.
---
Love it so much more now - and it explains why it isnt in the same menu as the other plushies
---
Same here I soloed earl too in 2n half minutes
---
Same! its been so exhausting. I need to not care next season
---
Yeah one of my Characters has that glitch but my other two don't. Definitely useful for shotguns, especially Double-barrel. I'm also guessing its Gatling Laser related as it also happened to me around the time I started regularly carrying one around.
---
But yeah if you try shooting as soon as you load the game you get some message in the upper left about not the right ammo.
---
6 levels to go, I'll be happy to go back to playing the game for fun once every few days
---
Hope she sees this bro üôèüèΩ
---
Lever - Boomstick. Because it makes go boom.
---
Plasma - Rasputin. Because it will get a queen on her knees.
---
Congrats - my wife and I tired it today with randoms and they left us halfway through :( - as a result we ran out of time with a quarter of his health left.
---
Our first fail in three runs
---
Interesting, I haven't noticed the message yet.
---
Maybe we‚Äôll get a stash and budget increase by then!
---
Wait how are you finding time to loot the wendigo? I barely make it out before timer üò¨
---
I prefer more people, hopefully level 100+ because if not, I‚Äôm usually being chased by the entire hoard and colossus at the same time.
---
I usally just change the ammo
---
No, it was fully complete with all 3 tiers.
---
In terms of the SMG vs Hunting rifle: go SMG. Much *much* higher dps. It be a harder decision if it was SMG vs like a semi auto bloodied rifle
---
Xbox player here, no odd disconnects for a while. I think I‚Äôve had a total of one game crash during loading screen today which is typical.
---
Wow it's literally happening to me right now again.  I see the message, "missing required ammo."
---
I had just blue screened and when I came back to the game, the glitch occurred.
---
Crazy.
---
for some reason I thought the power armor glitch was patched? can you still speed silos with it?
---
The best way to grow a community is to think of solutions for content,  not to bar them from it.
---
We want new players to have a shot at getting good things. That's the whole point of meat week too. Everyone can participate, and everyone can benefit.
---
There are babies??
---
I've done it probably 48 times now, no plans.  None, except 1 for the backpack. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

SBQ will go the whole event without landing sometimes and just carpet bomb pisses all over everything, which means the event fails due to time constraints most of the time because the AI won‚Äôt actually do what it‚Äôs supposed to. The battlefield is a great big wide open area with little cover and what cover there is sometimes messes up the pathing of the boss. Enemies everywhere that kinda blend into the environment and there‚Äôs so many different enemies that can show up, it could be scorched, some kinda weird animal, or some super annoying BS enemy that one shots you like the mirelurk king, mirelurk queen, cave crickets, deathclaws, etc. Super annoying how inconsistent the enemies are so you can‚Äôt really prepare. Can‚Äôt even cripple the queen to help yourself out a little bit. **DYING AND SPAWNING IN THE NUKE ZONE A MILLION MILES AWAY.**  The Queen fight is basically ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs landed! Kill her before she takes off again because she might not land again!‚Äù
---
Earl doesn‚Äôt run from you. Earl comes to you like ‚ÄúImma eat cho ass‚Äù. Which means no time is wasted chasing him down or waiting for him to become vulnerable so there‚Äôs plenty of time in the event. The battlefield is really interesting, lots of cover, neat little stage hazards that you have to avoid. When you die you spawn back at the entrance and can immediately get back into the fight. All the mobs that show up to help the boss are just one enemy type, sweet and simple, and it‚Äôs one of the tougher most deadly enemy types in the game too so they‚Äôre fun to fight. (We‚Äôve all been there at one point, being a low level and stumbling across our first windigo and have an epic battle with it scared out of your mind.) You can cripple Earl from what I‚Äôve heard. **No dying and spawning a nuke zone a million miles away.** Earl fight feels like an actual raid boss and it‚Äôs really fun to do with others. SBQ fight with 20+ players there one goes down ‚ÄúOh well there‚Äôs 19 more of us.‚Äù ACP with it‚Äôs 8 player instance and one of us goes down ‚ÄúShite I have to get over there and help him, draw Earl the other way for a sec and I‚Äôll get them up!‚Äù
---
ACP is much better and much more fun than Scorched Earth, Never dropping a nuke on the queen again.
---
That would be so cool, I've only seen them by themselves.  I have been sitting on 800 for the horse when it comes back. ü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
---
Lol. Good luck, I have tons of scrap and can rebuild it over and over again.
---
The dudes with Gatling lasers seem to tear, but they likely have magic weapons anyway.
---
Omg, that‚Äôs horrible. I feel your pain. What platform are you on?
---
You're not imagining it; the mod has gone from  -60% spoilage rate to -10%. 
---
What a bunch of crap.
---
Lol good one
---
Stack your meats and add a couple chems stretegically.  I'm doing well over 1k easily on SBQ unarmed with food buffs and expect about the same with Earle with some whiskey and psychobuff or fury. 3k if I'm undetected.
---
I'd imagine if you're running up to his face in PA you'd be doing low damage.
---
it‚Äôs because fo76 is free on game pass so there‚Äôs a ton of newbies
---
you made me laugh!
---
Honestly, they seem juvenile. If I came across one that was maze like or something more than boards or drops, I wouldn't mind. That takes at least some creativity. 
---
The board drops and falls, that's just lazy.
---
Happened to me the first time too. Just close app and launch the game again, fixes the problem
---
Hear, hear! Well said. You are a good bean, and I am very glad that you exist and are a member of this community. üíô
---
Same taking a break
---
Xbox.  It's totally not a huge deal, my husband got the salty mod, no plans for the actual tenderizer.  üòÇ I did get the plushie and meat piles on my first 2 wendigo drops so I guess that's good.
---
I wrapped up on the 3rd. Had not played for a while after that. Last few days been focused on my drumming for meat week.to get plans. Otherwise, just housekeeping shit. Moving weapons between characters and whatnote.
---
Gamma rounds ftw.
---
&gt;Maybe they're not bothering with level recommendations anymore after One Appalachia
---
As someone who's checked out the PTS, the people hoping that One Wasteland will fix this are in for a rude awakening. All builds do less damage, and lowbies with their janky builds will contribute even less to the fight.
---
"HeY gUyS i'M heLPinG!"
---
They need to either add a level floor or make the event non-instanced. The latter isn't gonna happen, so it's gotta be the former.
---
Why is it annoying?
---
Just used their site yesterday after messing up launching my first nuke. Instant bookmark immediately after that lol
---
[Go here](https://help.bethesda.net)
---
I‚Äôve honestly never played a game with such a friendly player base. I was pretty nervous about an online game bc I usually just do single-player stuff, but so many high levels came around and helped me out, showed me how to do events, gave me plans and supplies, it really made an impression. Now as a lvl 115 I love dropping things off for new players and paying that kindness forward
---
Aw, I‚Äôm on PC, or else I‚Äôd offer some stuff for you two. Those Meat Tenderizer plans are pretty rare, though!
---
Most high-level players have all the mods unlocked. Ask some in the game or on trading subreddit. Most will do it for free.
---
Still an issue.  Cant progress :(
---
Adapt.
---
I end up with dead Brahmin when I try to solo. The sheepsquatch isn't that hard to deal with, but trying to round up the adds that are killing the cows is where I fail it solo. Someone did tell me you only have to have one cow alive tho, and have not retried solo with that knowledge?
---
You are a lifesaver! It worked! Thank you
---
Not taking part in it and AFKing.
---
I will have you know that when I joined at lvl 55, I was useless. I felt bad. Granted, we didn‚Äôt lose just because I was wasting a spot..only two others showed up. 
---
Still, it wasn‚Äôt fun for anyone. I broke both of my decent guns just trying to draw attention. I expected more with two simultaneous nukes on the spot.
---
Edit: I don‚Äôt think my perks are trash, but my legendary weapons so far are. My only mutations are marsupial and carnivore, so I might be missing out there.
---
I saw exactly where they were but they would not allow me to move scrap store them
---
Looked up at the atomic shop splash image above my nuclear winter queue after reading this post and laughed
---
I'm going to call bullcrap on this for the simple fact that you killed my character before I could even respond to your comment.  I was a level 10 and you gunned me down when your level was in the triple digits.  I get pvp is fun but is it when there is zero challenge?  Why were you even policing the junkyard at that level of you're doing it for the thrill?  That's beyond trolling at that point.  At least have a side character that would be around a level where someone can realistically fight back.
---
I have 40 to go. I don't think I'm going to make it. I even started re-investing the atoms into another level, and using atoms from achievements to buy levels.
---
Its funner to respawn just as he dies and when you go to drop back into the mine it collapses right in front of your face so if you want to loot his body you gotta run thru where you escape than you get down and cant find the body.
---
His loot is meh anyway, the event legendary has always been better for me. The 400 screws is nice though.
---
That's why you hotkey a hazmat suit and just walk out the nuke zone.
---
If u die at the end do u really deserve that 1 Star wood left leg?
---
They each killed their opponents father. Thus the feud began.
---
Same here, thankfully they removed the ugly writing from the chest in a later patch, but it's still riddled with free states symbols. But outside of the kinda poor texturing job, the design of it is rather nice. Strikes a nice military look without spilling over into this cringy tacticool nonsense.
---
üëç
---
Oh, working the spits doesn‚Äôt help the event at all?
---
One of the big issues I see is that Beth doesn't want to make end game content. They want to make all content for every level (One Wasteland), but in doing so you forego end game challenges and additional reasons to get to those higher levels.
---
3 cursed harpoons on 5 runs.
---
I manage to get 250 - 300 a run as a support role. If I killed all these bodies, they‚Äôre all mines.
---
She's a beaut
---
Aye, personally I think the design team responsible for atomic shop content is really struggling with nailing Fallout's style, occasionally they get something that fits, but they never seem to be able to actually stick the landing like some of the greats in the series.   
---
If any designer working on 76 comes across this, I'd recommend looking into Adam Adamowicz's concept art gallery for Fallout 3, far and away the best visual design for the Fallout series.
---
Switched power pole?
---
Totally, TY though.  üíú I'm sure I'll find them vending at some point.  I just finally got the last bit of the sheepsquatch set that I was missing from someone's machine.  I can't do encrypted anymore it gives me an instant migraine.  I'm surprised ACP isn't bad at all.  It's actually fun.
---
I just came back to see if this game got better since launch.
---
This is what I expected and why I wont be coming back.
---
If you mean the 20 Treasury Note and 150 Legendary Scrip reset times, that‚Äôs controlled by you. It‚Äôs 20 hours after your first sale. 
---
Just do one sale as soon as you log in and you then have 20 hours to get the rest. Just like the 1400 vendor caps. 
---
Having a set time for the reset would be more restrictive, not less. 
---
Regarding making it one weekly reset instead of 20 hour resets; If it was changed to 150x7;  1050 Weekly Scrip, that would be less than now. You can theoretically get 8 Scrip resets in a week right now, for a total of 1200 Scrip weekly. 
---
All in all, the current system is better than a set reset time for everyone.
---
Well, I always thought that part of the map was rather empty. Wastelanders, and now steel dawn, seems to be fixing that nicely.
---
I would enjoy the pvp aspect more if it was an even fight, but all my experiences getting my workshops taken were when I was baby levels and a 100+ would just come up and squish me. I‚Äôd have no chance at all, and those players would sometimes even chase me from workshop to workshop, they weren‚Äôt taking them for the resources or the challenge of pvp. It wasn‚Äôt fun or sporting xD
---
People are pathetic tbh
---
I wanted to live there. But because it‚Äôs a location/Bethesda said no, you can‚Äôt.
---
Damn, I can‚Äôt loot that quick at the end... and I don‚Äôt stop to pick anything up during. That‚Äôs a shit ton of screwsÔøº
---
You don't like the game. That's fair, reasonable and perfectly fine. I don't know why you're coming to literally the one place on the internet where not liking the game isn't that popular of an opinion and expect validation. You can go anywhere else and say the game is stupid and get awarded gold for saying it.
---
What do you mean?  Like, what is a fair price to pay for Chems from a player vendor?
---
If they have a vendor.
---
I noticed this with the paint from SCORE, it fucked up my all rise, which now weights all 8 pounds, instead of the .86 it was before. üôÑ Now it went from my main melee weapon to a stash sucker.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a normal axe too? Or am I dumb?
---
I just hope they don't end up making nuke codes per person at some point and force us to do all that other grind just to do the actual events it's used for
---
THE NEED FOR SPEED!
---
Yeah
---
Sometimes? I visit camps that really stretch the definition of sanity.
---
I had the same bad luck with Fasnacht, but with this one I've gotten multiple Tenderizer and Tato Salad plans... None of the Tenderizer mod plans though, but I got them last year, so nbd... Just the nature of the RNG beast my friend.
---
There should be 5+ deathclaws, it would make the optional part of the beginning wastelanders quest a lot harder and more fun
---
Great idea. I've done the event twice now, both times getting excited when it pops up and immediately fast travelling to it, then I remember "crap, I forgot my power armor." ...then I die to the rads outside.
---
There‚Äôs really no set amount. I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than base value, and then only if I really needed it for my build. 
---
I personally sell chems at about 20-25% of Base Value, but that‚Äôs a bit on the cheap side.
---
The mechanist and the hard case backpack.
---
Hopefully next season they will give us atoms, or preferably bullion.
---
Exsplosive bait
---
Floor decor
---
the chinese stealth suit has you covered
---
I run a tank build, 4 Vanguards SS with 1 Auto Stim SS. I use a Furious Swing Speed Gauntlet and yea the dps is no where near the best, like 100-300 a swing on earl depending on food buffs and chems. But with all the bloody builds and ranged builds that love to get those juicy sneak headshots. I get a lot of thanks for holding them in place for them to easy damage and that to me is enough to keep me happy and smile. Outside the bosses the damage it does is more then enough to do open content solo.
---
With mutations, Perk Cards, food buffs and Chems that I use, I find the damage to be well enough for what I try for with the groups I tend to play with.
---
Report him. Sorry it happened I had it happen to me with two weapons a month ago. I ended up getting the guy blacklisted and I learned a lesson
---
I recommend you remove the person‚Äôs gamer tag. That‚Äôs witch-hunting and not allowed on this sub.
---
Someone always has their survival camp right next to meat week.  I'm always happy about that as a nonFO1st player.
---
I was just wondering because some people sell their chems for 25 caps and others for 15 caps. Thanks bro
---
I would have too. 308 is work
---
Man that‚Äôs rough. My luck is always awful in this game, but this event I‚Äôve received 4 tenderizer plans lmao.
---
I'll remember that for next time! I was so hyped for it when it came out but never ended up using it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
5 adrenaline
---
This isn‚Äôt new, it‚Äôs been in the game files for a long time. It was implemented way before we got any kind of confirmation for the brotherhood expansions so I doubt it has anything to do with that.
---
Same problem here.
---
Thanks for the info again I'm pretty new here and will do it just wanted to warn others that's all
---
Never. Ever. Trade.
---
I did thanks
---
i always favorite it so when im about to get out im good. also weights less than pa i think
---
Thanks I've learned the hard way but on a positive note i guess those will be nerfed in a month but still feels bad
---
B l o o d I e d I s n t g e t t i n g n e r f e d
---
The tech-claw. Half robot. Half death claw. Mad and on the same level as the encryptid SBC Earle. With spawns of other claws
---
I removed his tag thanks for the help
---
I'll catch hate for saying it, but if you're able to one shot most things I say don't even use Adreneline unless you're doing a boss fight. It's just overkill if you're a stealth rifleman/commando.
---
5 minutes is plenty of time even for a legit build
---
There's a sub in reddit that acts as a marketplace for trades. They offer help by having trusted couriers who volunteer their time to assist with trades. Try that route for future trades.
---
Fun fact on the plushie - it makes sounds if you activate it. Terrifying sounds, but still sounds.
---
And the trophy heads twitch every so often.
---
Thank you i will do that from now on i just wanted to vent this out and feel less stupid i should've know i appreciate the valuable info
---
Have you modded the gun for more damage? Are you running perks that increase damage?
---
I inbox people with awesome camps.  üíú On Xbox.
---
Oh wowwww kk got it now
---
I only play solo since launch and I can still say this is not a single player game.
---
Its like 50 caps max to fast travel w/ Travel Agent, you really dont have 50 caps to spare? Hell if you sell enough weapons, junk and chems you can FT a minimum of 28 times a day for free. Some people just can't complain enough.
---
That happened to me earlier today. We were just about to take Earle down and he vanished. All those rounds, wasted.
---
I'll try that tomorrow.  Thanks.
---
People have been talking about it ad nauseum... Not many listening though, since all I see as I solo the drums is people hopping around and doing Mothman dances.
---
It's not you buddy, you acted on good faith. There are always assholes in the world. Keep your chin up and be you!
---
Stop dying. Learn why you are dying soo much and prevent that. It‚Äôs there to prevent Zerg rushing stuff since dying has no draw backs.
---
Anything unique to my knowledge is obtainable no matter who you side with it will just take more time or additional gold bullion or both to unlock it.
---
I feel this we had a level 22 and a level 26 drop in tonight.  My husband and I are 147, and 245, thankfully we had 2 other good people on the team and the level 22 ran in like a complete nutter, and died instantly.  üòÇüòÇ
---
After missing out on some i dropped mine next to the little pond nearby lol
---
Also appreciate dwellers which moved their CAMP close to it
---
Anyone have the Salty Weapon Mod they would be willing to trade for?
---
The Mechanist outfit looks nice with it.
---
You don‚Äôt do it for all that other shite, you do it for the unique weapons, plans and apparel that come from the event. That‚Äôs why the SBQ fight is so bleh, can‚Äôt get anything special from it for the most part.
---
bloodied build on monogah doesn‚Äôt work too great
---
I'd be happy if they could just get them to target the lone mole rat chewing on the side of them.
---
I have this happen to me once except the other person was a level 24 with the same brotherhood armor that I was wearing with the same armored skull helmet that I was wearing I lost the picture due to a glitch that deletes all my captures
---
Its been like that for weeks you nonce.
---
Rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman perks all maxed out plus a hardened receiver on that bad boy will do shitloads more damage.
---
Thank you for the support i really appreciate it
---
FUCKING   *T H I S* ! ! ! ! !
---
I */WANT/* people to see my house, but I */DON'T/* want them to leave my doors open or fuck with my lights! I ended up putting locks on my doors again today~ üôÉ
---
Protectrons are a tricky target actually, if you shoot its very large "head" hitbox it does reduced damage despite acting like it was a critical hit. Aim for arms and legs with protectrons to take them down faster.
---
If they are naked, it usually means they have disconnected and left their body behind. They aren‚Äôt actually there.
---
I am a rifleman/commando stealth build.
---
I‚Äôm bloodied and I can run colossus without dying. Stand around the middle area. Falling rocks never spawn there. Acid does but it‚Äôs rare. 
---
If the colossus gets close to kick you run away. There are spots where his scream won‚Äôt make you run off the platform.
---
3 covert 3 adrenaline
---
Yes it does, you can fail the event.
---
Wrapped it up today, with the assistance of the bonus weeklies. I‚Äôm never doing that again. Now I know it‚Äôs (at least!) 56 days of effort, and what the rewards of that effort are like, I‚Äôll avoid it.
---
I like the idea of the run, but constant one-day-only points goals made it into something that became blah around rank 50, and actively annoying around 85. Too much pressure, not enough fun.
---
Going to go play something else for a while - Wasteland 3 is out Thursday!
---
This is my bobble head site, hope they don't change my spawn rate!
---
Yeah this makes sense
---
Absolutely nothing else to say other than the fact that this makes total sense
---
good to know, appreciate it!
---
It's probably more your build. Rifles and Shotguns are generally good weapons, but you need to spec into them... And it's hard to be spec'd for both Rifles and Shotguns, or at least it's a unusual combination in this game. Plus at your level you still don't have access to all the cards you're going to want. I would suggest picking one of them and focus your build around it. You'll need the cards that increase the damage on your specific weapons (ie, Shotgunner or Riflemen). You'll also want to find legendary variants of your weapons with effects that play to their strengths.. Instigating is really good for both Rifles and Shotguns for example. There's also Bloodied and Junkie builds you can utilize, but you'll want to look up some guides on how to make one of those builds, and both are dependent on finding the right gear, Bloodied more so than Junkies.
---
Did it 2 times y-day , both times atleast 2 under lvl 25 players , no issues completing it. Depends alot on the rest of the players, if the rest are only running weight reduction perks and not damage oriented it can be a struggle i can imagine though
---
Its an easy event , the key is killing the ads fast! I only run with randoms and if nobody is clearing the ads i just whipe em out fast. The big guy is not much of a threat himself  tbh
---
Runnning a Full health Junkie after getting boored with low health , yes i know a Bloodied does more damage but after 7 times i have 0 deaths , and we all know a lower dps is better than a dead dps lol
---
Real end game is helping out the newer players for me. I have the guns and armor I need. Now my days are spent looking for the elusive ‚ÄúLegacy Weapon in Vendor for 3000 caps‚Äù and helping newer players either by selling or giving items away. Oh, and I‚Äôve taken to  chasing noobs around Flatwoods with a Flaming Chainsaw while wearing the mechanics jumpsuit and Bog Wanderer mask and then dropping some aid at their feet afterwards. 
---
Good fun.
---
Well yes.
---
But on the otherside does it really take more resources than the SBQ Fight?
---
The SBQ Fight is happening in the Open World, basically everyone has to load up the the gameworld and keep track of all thing around them.
---
The Mine is Instanced - so you only have to load the Mine itself which is a smaller Area and would take less Resources to load? 
---
Im not a Programmer on any Level but shouldnt ACP run better than SBQ ?
---
If I ever do a 2:1 deal I always keep the best stuff till i get what i want. But then again I don't do any trade outside of reddit..
---
Lol a lvl 700 player was dying repeatedly. Just seems to be noobs
---
I want the pick axe i got 2  cursed shovels
---
x1000
---
Not cool bro.
---
Yea man it sure does add another dimension. It the main reason I love playing ESO on ps4 instead of PC.
---
I actually don't mind not winning every event every time, the game's a cheese fest otherwise.
---
There's plenty time to play and beat the event, it's not going anywhere.
---
*finally hits the event icon, gets the fast travel bug and has to try again
---
Thanks for this info it's really valuable since I'm new here and i appreciate it will do it from now on
---
Feel bad for Sinseer. He hit 7600 quite a while ago and only got 20 atoms.
---
Or because of how many people finished it and even early, they just pull a fast one and make it more grindy :(
---
It‚Äôs so basic. They never do anything truly dungeon end boss like :(
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying. Apparently some others are getting it too but It isn't entirely widespread
---
Static means that if you get two cursed harpoons their legendary effects will be the same, not random. So don‚Äôt bother trying to run it a bunch of times to get a bloodied one or whatever
---
I believe there was supposed to be a second part or was the last one our second part?
---
Funny thing is, I have the disc of fallout 4, bought it at launch. But couldn‚Äôt find it and it was on Xbox store sale for like 5 dollars. I bought it, and I tell you I have not started playing it again being I‚Äôve been playing fallout 76. But I know once I start it I will wrapped 400 hours in it in no time. I love that game and can‚Äôt wait to see what they do with the next fallout single player story.
---
The only place that dying ever had a draw back was with the vault 94 raids.
---
Dying in the event does not fail. Idk where you got this info. I know about when you die as soon as earl dies but you still get the rewards, but sometimes you get the repawn bug.
---
Don‚Äôt include bugs and glitches.
---
If you can tell me the process on how it‚Äôs possible to fail the event tell me other then timer running out.
---
My motivation is hanging out with my friends..  I‚Äôm rank98 myself but it definitely wasn‚Äôt a grind to get here
---
Assassin sentinel is best in slot for people like me who do PvP. I feel the same way about unyielding and weight reduction gear as you do about assassin gear.
---
Motivation to care?
---
Second part starts in September. It will be wood next
---
FoRtNiTe BaD
---
Looks like it finally returned! I‚Äôm happy that we can get it again, now I‚Äôm just waiting for the vault boy and girl mascot heads to show up finally.
---
Found the Excavator Boi
---
Robots in general are a huge pain in the ass, but it sounds like your build just doesn't have enough _oomph_.
---
I doubt they would do that for the reason that you can buy your entire pass on day 1 and hoard bullion the 10 week run....but who knows.
---
No.
---
I just played in a event. I sure hope the guy that launched it got in. Every other time I got on a server tonight the event was over. But I was about to log so I could goto bed and I saw a guy in the silo so I waited. I can‚Äôt remember if he got in or not. But that would be bs if he didn‚Äôt. I completely agree with you. The person that launches should be able to be in the largest group
---
WAIT ARE YOU NOT?? I got lucky on all my nukes so far, then. Holy shit, *why*?!
---
I have been trying to find a way to start the questline for the settlers but all I've been doing is increasing the reputation by doing Ward's quest but I don't know how to start the actual main quest and I need help with that
---
https://ibb.co/bb2SMnY
---
Just attack the spawn til the final 8min of the event then switch over to colossus that when it HP start going down... ‚Äúpower attack‚Äù only
---
With the queen.. you need 1500 total dmg to get drops... just wait til it lands and power attack it , for me 10-15 swing = the 1500
---
I thought whoever launched the nuke always got in, but I was just proven wrong.
---
Oh no. Dev admits to ignoring all in-game pricing, focusing only on 3rd party sites.
---
Since most of the items are sold in player vendors in-game, that alone shows that the prices are grossly inaccurate.
---
It's the climax of the settlers quest chain. You need to progress it to the end. If you completed the raiders quest chain you won't be able too.
---
It absolutely does. Even if you are afk, you are contributing as it helps prevent progress bar decay AND help fill said bar during the 1:30 prep stage at the beginning.
---
I am bloodied and after learning the event from playing it more tonight I had my 4th time and never died. I use all unyielding secret service except one piece I got from baby earl a week ago. It‚Äôs Chameleon marine armor plus with all the sneak perks I can stand still and mostly go unseen.
---
I found out the hard way..lol
---
If you want to do solo nukes, Troubleshooter Armour can be really useful, and the lone wanderer perk in charisma can really help
---
I'm still at hostel reputation with the raiders I don't know how to start their first line either
---
Seriously?!  Do they test this stuff?
---
And how do you get it to the climax for the sunrise does it mean the reputation or no?
---
They‚Äôre not guaranteed drops you know.
---
My wife and I both have magic shotguns. We cleared the event with just the two of us. PS4 btw.
---
Have you spoken to the overseer yet?
---
You need to do the quests for Rose at Top of the World.
---
3 event I died and respawned when he got killed I didn‚Äôt get to loot him but didn‚Äôt care being first two times it was junk. But this time I could loot the chest at the end. Nothing good but when I walked out to the world I had a black screen loading bug. Sat for ten minutes closed game on Xbox and started back up. Got back in and got all rewards still which was first cursed weapon harpoon. Tonight was the first fight in all four where I didn‚Äôt die and got to loot earl and chest and get out with no screen bug. The only bug I have encountered in 4 events was the black screen but I got rewards so I‚Äôm fine with it
---
You can't just separate out a portion of your community just because it's inconvenient to your perspective. They are a PvP player just as much as you are.
---
To a PvE player who never wanted to PvP, any unwanted PvP engagement is griefing to them.
---
Bear in mind I never said OP was a griefer. It clearly indicates that workshops are PvP zones so if you enter, you're opening yourself up to it. I just said that he's an arsehole because the games mechanics allows him to. That's all.
---
Hard to dispute given that the non-arsehole wouldn't engage in PvP at all, so it's pretty self evident.
---
I have in the prevention quest somewhat broken for me I put in the the blood sample but it's still saying I haven't so the ounces of prevention quest is broken for me so we're going to get that far with the overseer
---
I'm new to 76. My cousin got me the game as a gift. Told me to participate in Primal Cuts. I had an Oh Shit moment when I realized maybe beinf level 13 for these events isn't a good idea. Learned that the hard way lmao 
---
Yes pls a floor level would spare new players like me the embarassment of thinking events scaled for level

---
Correction so I didn't get far with them overseet
---
I haven't played WL with a fresh character so I'm not sure of the quest prerequisites to start the settlers/raiders quests... But since you're still hostile with the raiders I'm assuming you're going to have to do the Overseers quests before you can move onto that phase.

Wont be as big an issue once the rebalance goes live. 
---
First time I tried to go pure melee and wound up with a minute long respawn every other second for the whole fight. 
---
Second time I went with a vampires explosive train rifle and a medics explosive fixer. Swapping to mele for smalluns.
---
Only died 3 times that time.  And we made it with about 3 minutes. We ranged from 80 - 250. Looks like so long as continuous fire is maintained itll go down before times up, if people avoid dieting unecessicerily. 
---
I swapped to melee at the last like 5% and managed to pump out a ton of damage.
---
Got 3 legendaries of mediocre value, and the wendigo carpet.  That wont fit anywhere in my camp.  XD
---
I finished the quests with Rose
---
Damn Synths
---
It's so nice and the extra dr doesn't really matter that much.
---
All I use is ultracite ammo so it's useless to me
---
Everyone gets in as soon as an event is filled with 8 players another one pops up.
---
Or from other events at least so we can farm in between.
---
Close to Next week I believe.
---
The mace is great cause it gets rid of the constant annoying sound from the rocket sledge.
---
Mr. New Vegas and Three Dog are the tops
---
No. You're literally the only person to have an issue with that machine. /s
---
I agree 
---
Id rather dismantle unwanted ammo to use it's components to make ammo i need u know
---
I guess I should‚Äôve did this on my third event yesterday once I respawned they just killed him and I saw it was blocked and I just exited and looted the chest. That was the only event out of 4 where when I left the mine I had a loading screen bug and I had to close game down and when I brought it back up somehow I got all the loot still. So I didn‚Äôt care I couldn‚Äôt loot him. Tonight was the best drop I got from him. A mutants sledgehammer 40 more power damage and +1 agility
---
Don't worry the Brotherhood will take care of them
---
That is how it‚Äôs supposed to work yes, but after the first one filled up it was putting me into solo instances. About 15 people showed up but it only put me in a solo instance.
---
The first half is over. Second half is coming soon.
---
Radio newvegas for the win
---
I'm a sucker for plushies in real life and in game. But yeah I definitely like this idea! This would be such a fun way to do more camp items. Plus more paintings seem like an easy one that would please a lot of people.
---
Live and learn, friend. As others have suggested, use the marketplace sub for future trades and always check the blacklist. It sucks to be ripped off, but good on you for trying to spread awareness. And don‚Äôt worry about those weapons too much, good replacement guns will come back around as they always do.
---
Everything was "nerfed" because they're changing how damage multipliers are calculated. Everything will be comparatively weaker.
---
How much would that cost?  They would probably love if people blew that much cash on atoms.
---
I would be 100% down with that. It would be far easier to just deconstruct ammo for steel, lead, and gun powder. I am literally about to delete the ammo converter from my camp because it is useless.
---
I buy buffout and psycho for 10 caps and use chemist with super duper to make phycobuff.
---
25 caps is an iffy if your running low.
---
10 to 15 range is pretty good.
---
X cell, daddy o, and the other rare drugs run 30 to 50 caps. Formula P is usually in the same price range.
---
Happened to me 
---
Player had the same mountain scout outfit and raider gas mask 
---
Was immediately surprised
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 level 293 and I‚Äôve run the event like 20 times with randoms. Haven‚Äôt seen below a level 55
---
Haha. Was your story the one were when you first seen a SB you first thought was you needed a rocket launcher? I read that story. Lol
---
So basically, you lost several times because there were 1 or two low levels in the group of ... 8? Its time to ask yourself, if you are higher level ones, why you are so useless? Are you also maybe a less contributed factor that just kept dying? Its a shame that high level complains about low levels while you should be helping and nurturing them, you should hang yourself under the ball-sacks (or heads? whatever) of colossal and hang a board on your neck says "a useless tiny weenie"
---
Stop playing the game, you can't take it.
---
You were newbie before and wrap your spandex blue tight suit roaming the wasteland, now you wear fancy stuff on your balls then you forgot who you were? Shame on you!
---
Thanks it means a lot the support words and advice i wished i was here on reddit earlier thank you will do
---
# THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EVENT ON DEATHCLAW ISLAND
---
It is a rather small island, but it could have an instanced interior cave in the hole where the Deathclaw currently spawns. Like a Daily Ops deathclaw sanctuary-esque dungeon fight
---
I guess it balanced out, eh? Haha, they‚Äôre worth a lot if you‚Äôre after anything in particular. üòÑ
---
Just unlock the dark-matter scan jetpack and everything on the Legendary Run bundle and it does not work yet I can't even build it not even do the power armor and nothing I just unlocked it tonight about 20 minutes ago
---
I don't use it. I still make or buy my ammo. I don't sell as much ammo now as I did before the season but since I still do i think there are plenty of other people that also don't want to bother with the converter.
---
Yes I love not feeling like I have to log in as soon as I get home. 
---
But now everytime I level up or get that 10k xp I'm just like, "what a waste of my score."
---
Yeah i was so excited when i got it and then used it and was utterly disappointed. Even with the "fix" its all horrible, having fixed set amounts is stupid as all hell
---
I'm the person not playing the drums or running the spit, before the event starts. I know the drill and I find it infinitely fascinating. You guys get pissed when you can't get a shot in edgewise while playing uranium fever for a legendary. but you deny a low level character the opportunity of experiencing meat week. Seriously, shame on you. Most of you are going to put those items in your vendor for way too much anyway. We don't have much more time for meat week, but can you just let some low levels have ample time to join? I thought this was supposed to be fun.
---
Absolutely, and it is pretty fun if you can avoid the bugs! One time during that event, I started dropping all of my loot on every death, and the entirety of the event for me was fumbling my loot bag around until I died after Earle and respawned at the surface, never to see the bag again. xD Nice find! I‚Äôve yet to complete my Imposter collection, one day. üòÑ Wishing you the best hunting the plans down.
---
No problem, thanks anyway and maybe in advance
---
Yeah, I am still spending like 2,000 or more caps a day buying materials to craft ammo. I was so excited when I got the ammo converter because it was an early on season reward and then the second I went to use it I got a migraine instantly trying to read the words on the terminal.
---
For awhile I had this idea of death claw island being like quarry junction in New Vegas so I avoided it. They also had old olney in Fallout 3 that was haven for deathclaws so yeah when it actually has the word death claw in its name you think this is gonna be some crazy shit, but nah.
---
Now this idea I can get behind!
---
I've never been in one solo must be very unfortunate. I've been in a couple low one's which were horrible so now as soon as it pops I fast travel and it's worked out ok
---
Exactly they should at least have a sell all on every ammo type. I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit there and go through the display a million times. I am more inclined to just drop excess ammo now. Which seems like such a waste.
---
Yea i was caught off guard when i summoned the assultron not knowing it was a boss event, failed that event lol
---
Bro those couriers take for ever tho
---
Have a plan for the painting drop at 76 kills of a creature, and the plushie plan at 760. 
---
I would already have the opossum plushie...
---
It happens. I had 150 and some others reported even getting upward of 200 to 300.
---
I agree cause you collect that ammo yourself, but to get a return on investment is quite taxing and not even worth the effort. Plus exchange rate is unbalanced its like ur getting robbed
---
Just walk in, I have never seen the event spawn /Pop up but just walking in and getting to the first cavern bit always pops it.
---
3 Covert Op 3 Adrenaline‚Äîbut all of the above is better.
---
Ikr, I always have 25000 ish caps.  50 makes no difference.
---
I bought the Fuzzy ride, was waiting on that. I'll take a risk that they release a bundle for the plush, I'm low on atoms atm
---
As someone way down in the tree. It sucks. you guys should even get bonuses for grinding it out so soon.
---
Many players show up completely unprepared as was i. I had zero idea it was gonna be a bigger bullet sponge than sbq is.
---
that explains why i have so many raider limbs lmao
---
Almost all damage is nerfed, it's just the bloodied and junkies crying the hardest about the change because of how big their numbers dropped (not at all factoring in that in most cases the changes make negligible gameplay differences).
---
The only thing not nerfed is anything with zero or 1 buff, so pretty much early game characters.
---
This community has tons of reasons to complain but ffs sake people sometimes you just have to live with stuff. Thank god im not the only one who sees this.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten anything but cursed weapons and the only decent one the pick axe I got once personally not loving the event at all with all the bad experiences I‚Äôve had with it
---
I have 89k points in my ammo converter.
---
I made nothing but rail spikes using steel from scraping every weapon I come across.
---
It‚Äôs pretty useful unless you use ultracite.
---
The UI leaves much to be desired though.
---
Hmm...
---
Also literally everyone knows how the fast travel system works.  No one cares.
---
mr new vegas, travis pre confidence man (he‚Äôs funny)
---
Im getting dcd within 5 minutes
---
We need Nuka-World raider outfits and handmade skins.
---
I would actually use it but by "fixing" it, Bethesda actually made it worse to use.
---
Until Bethesda gets their act together, I'm pretty much just dropping excess ammo.
---
Sell them close to vault 76 for dirt cheap. New players buy them all the time, even the revolver ivory grip.
---
I dont think players understand this and think its like the snq event.
---
I'm only at level 7 in NW and had 60 cards. I like how you have a full 2 minutes to sort through them.
---
Lol we were lvl 30 and there were like 500+ lvl people coming. It was then that we knew we fucked up somehow
---
If you haven't completed An Ounce of Prevention quest already, you pretty much can't until Bethesda fixes it.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just make them sliders so you could exchange it all at once. It is like they thought it would be an unfair advantage for new players down the line. Its like what?! What about current players actually playing now? Plus we now know that all seasons items will be purchasable with gold bullion so now they should have even more of a reason to change it.
---
Suppose to just happen unless your payment is pending but I doubt that.
---
I jumped in on my alt and was completely caught off guard and that toon is 65. 3500+ rounds going in and used every weapons ammo. It got done but im not going in with him again for a while.
---
To me, the weird part is having the dailies and getting notifications when I complete them even though there is no benefit in doing so. It's kind of distracting.
---
Ill.kiss your lips for speaking that sweetness
---
There's a lot of thing I don't understand why Bethesda does things. They already had a perfectly good interface with the trade window that could have worked well with it.
---
Simple, clean, quick and easy to use and can handle whatever volume you want with the sliders as you've mentioned.
---
It's atrocious.
---
It's actuallly pretty weird how there're "rad poisoning" or "directions" emotes but no basics like "laugh", "sad", "scared" (different from dying) and the most important in Fallout setting "welp ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
---
They don't have any, that's how.
---
Maybe his parents were getting a divorce
---
They seem to think 12 year olds play their game. Sadly, I see these ridiculous outfits being worn so perhaps they know their demographics.
---
There‚Äôs a scared emote (you looking around scared) and a frown emote, but it‚Äôs more of an angry frown for sure.
---
It could have been the respawn bug, where on death you respawn in location without the ability to move or do anything. It‚Äôs happened to me half a dozen times already in A Colossal Problem, and unless you have a teammate you can respawn on in the even, the best you can hope for is for a Wendigo to kill you and if someone revives you you will be able to resume play.
---
Zoom in
---
Todd wishes he was Grelok
---
Id picture a Sea of Thieves-esque island with a big cavern on top filled with gold and a deathclaw sitting on a throne of skulls.
---
Ya I fear that every time I launch a nuke. 
---
Haven‚Äôt happened to me yet from the 10~ times I did him.
---
But, one of these days I know it‚Äôs gonna happen.
---
üçùü•¥
---
Sorry to break it to you bud but those will still be some of the best weapons out there. Bloodied isn't getting nerfed, almost all damage and builds are proportionately.
---
That's ok again lesson learned the hard way and i could be lucky to get a replacement one day ‚ò∫
---
Just go around to a few player vendors and see for yourself. There isn't really a place to check out.
---
YES! THEY ARE CUTE AF!
---
Careful senpai, its my first time UwU lmao
---
I completely agree! Maybe if we are really nice, they will stop by and clean up our bath tubs and toilets. I am sick of living in filth!
---
First time it‚Äôs happened to me. Rarely get a game crash, but the timing on this one is terrible.
---
It was still blocked and the event marker was gone within it felt like 3 mins tops. I could be wrong but idk. Tryin again now
---
Omg. I have to find one. Lol.
---
Wait, so is the issue people fast traveling to your camp and getting to your stash box while the camp is rendering? If that's the case I think I'm in the clear. I've built my camp on top of the highest mountain spire I could find and people tend to be a little confused/distracted by the view at first. Then got a couple flights of stairs to climb.
---
DPS is king. Always.
---
Lol same thing thought i was at a good level
---
Oh how wrong i was
---
Well, it seemed like mentats had some effect before when I was trying to learn the handmade mods, I guess it was just more randomness and flukes.
---
Itd be $150 in the US.
---
I saw a video of that event, and have not joined because I saw that it is no joke. This isn't Scorched Beast Queen lol. I recently started up on PC after playing quite a bit on Xbox in the past so I'm only about level 27.
---
Has it been a full month since you subscribed?
---
I was using Angry Turtles Lazy shotgunner build with a magic shotgun for a while and it was pretty good. I only switched because I got a vampire/explosive handmade
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOhE3SprXCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOhE3SprXCU)
---
I agree. Large community instance events should have stash boxes. 
---
I would also argue that Fallout 1st junk boxes should be in certain named locations. It adds small conveniences to those that [shamefully] admit to paying for it.
---
It would be cool if they allowed you to continue to level up past 100, but for each level the reward is 150 atoms.
---
There is a 5 minute timer on public, I think when solo in private the timer is around 3 minutes.  I believe you can still join the event up until the time where the drop down would open up.
---
Let me guess - you were a bloodied build that didn't do the smart thing and bump up your health to 40% so you had more of a buffer to survive?
---
I completely agree. While we are at it, lets add a 'Anyone see where the legendary body went off to?' emote...
---
Shoot protectrons in the back. That's their weakness. But for most things head shots are a winning strategy. 
---
For each weapon, be aware of its range. If you quick target in VATS and it's 95% you're good to go. Some weapons seem to work better in VATS, some seem to work better crouched. Standing without crouching lowers DPS. Make sure you're fully perked for damage and the weapon(s) you're using. 3* to all 3 weapon type damage buffs, scattershot and tank killer, adrenaline, bloody mess, etc.
---
How about a black titanium machete or sword? A cool looking one handed bladed melee weapon that needs a plan to be legendary like the Fixer and Tenderizer.
---
Sounds like a ... Colossal Problem
---
I went in as a low level 40 I spent the entire time criting wendigos and stimming my fallen teammates. I felt very useful.
---
Yes, the OP-build-nerf is slated to come out with 22.
---
I disagree with 50 being the floor. I would say 45, personally. By 45 you have access to every weapon in the game (for the most part) and you can have a fully fleshed out build. By 45 you can do meaningful damage, at least to the obnoxious little anorexic bastards.   
---
  
---
Now, I will say that I didn't participate myself until 80, and all I did was straight up tank a buttload of wendigos on my own to let everyone else deal with the boss, but I was able to one-two shot them pretty easily with my 'off-spec' (bloodied unarmed with a death tambo) with all of the melee related mutations, but I didn't have all of the spec cards for a fully effective bloodied build since I've spent most of my time as a stealth sniper and hadn't seen how truly OP/broken bloodied is and just started picking up cards for it, but someone who knows what build they want from the start and actually works toward it with every level can absolutely be useful in the event by 45. I could even make the argument that they could even be 'okay' by 35, but only in a support role like using perks that heal -- like a medic shishkebab and friendly fire maxed out, running into the fray hitting friend and foe alike so their melee crits heal, and so do their regular hits on their party members. But for focused damage or tank builds, 35 just isn't really up to the task since the difference between a level 35 weapon and a level 50 weapon is DRASTIC where the difference between a 45 and a 50 is not that bad (I've seen some people in the 150+ range running a build with a level 45 weapon just because they haven't come across a 50 3 star with the right mods)
---
tl;dr: 35 in a support role can be useful, 45 is definitely useful as long as they're not dumb so I'd say 45 would be the ideal level floor, since it would take an exceptional player with a very focused build to be useful at all below 45.
---
Coo coo. Sure i'll send a fr on psn, but i dont get to play much thru the afternoon. Usual times have been 11am to anywhere from 1pm to 4pm ish. Then I stay up after midnight till 3 or 4am when i get back, just a heads up
---
Yea...no, they're leeching
---
Really? I remember seeing posts when it first came out that the sound is still there. Guess that got fixed
---
It might sound...Unyeildy at first, but its quite comfortable in the end.
---
This is why I won't play on console. It's unfortunate, but I've found that outside of the titles like cawadoody, you find mostly \*very\* casual players on console for the most part. I pretty much only play casual games or single player titles on my xbox one for that very reason. I find that it's more frustrating on xbox to play games like fo76 because of shit like game pass, etc.
---
I had this happen near the end, just after the assaultron past the laser grid. Left it for a few days and came back to it when I felt like trying again. Went through without issue, but did have to start over again.
---
I swap in extra adrenaline for fights with lots of trash.
---
And it can shoot laser beams that makes you stupid.
---
My PA weighs 2.5 pounds.
---
I dunno dude... I look like I'm wearing clothes all the time because I wear outfits. I wish there was an option to display armor on top of outfits instead of \*just\* the under armor pieces. Like I'd love to wear my mountain scout outfit with my armor pieces on top. People see me and assume I'm not wearing any armor at all when I'm in full level 50 \*\*\* gear perfectly selected for my build. (No power armor stealth sniper, working toward being able to swap bloodied sniper and bloodied commando)
---
Oh, is that one guaranteed? That's good cus the weapon I use most in the game is a plasma caster.
---
Ive used a couple missile turrets to down a scorchbeast no problem... And heavy laser turrets are great too. Takes out level 60 ghouls like nothing.
---
That depends on how long you played. Some that have played since day one have stockpiles of atoms...granted they worked for them but they were earned through dailies.
---
Noobs don't get fucked cause they don't stack damage to begin with
---
I'm running Revolutionary General currently. The combat armor under the coat fits the aesthetic.
---
OMG. I had that happen the other night. I glided down gently with my bird bones, while all the power armor bros slam down all BOOOOM, then this fucking level 12 goes splat. I revived his ass by accident while trying to revive the person he landed on top of that had revenant and splatted on purpose.
---
If you're running herd mentality with class freak on, that negates any potential downsides. Upside is solid but not top tier damage
---
You stockpile yours?  I'm always buying stuff, but I like cool outfits.  My husband has like 10k saved up. üôÑ I have 1400 because I just joined FO1st like an hour ago.
---
Will pay caps
---
They should make the code carriers have actual fragments that can be used with a nuke case that‚Äôs randomly found on the map like nuclear winter. It could be a daily quest. Keep the silos as well, but only require the keycards, the codes have become obsolete thanks to the crypt team.
---
It's like he can gaze into my soul :(
---
it's $120 if you buy the 4000 atom bundles
---
50 is even generous . I was thinking 70s since that‚Äôs the level of the trash mobs . Still prob useless
---
Thought it would be like in New vegas where there was a valley of super tough deathclaws
---
Sorry!
---
Oooo, that is a really short miniskirt!
---
Giggity!
---
I have learned this lesson the hard way too.  Now I  always have everything set up before the nuke run and start the event immediately.
---
Make one of the raider factions lead by rose. I'd join so quick.
---
Only removed with addictol &amp; the omelette
---
Killing people at workshops is pretty much how I farm junk.  It's infinitely more fun than just going around looting things off the ground.  It leads to threads like this.  Today, as I was stashing all of the junk I just stole off of a poor soul, he began questioning both my sexuality and the size of my genitals.  It was great.  Would recommend.
---
I dont know, i pit the thing near a atomic blast before it  went down and i didnt die or or anything, just samage will be done to it by AI mobs
---
You get up to 50% damage increase for having 5 or more addictions. so 10% dmg for each addiction up to 5.   
---
Pro's:
---
* Great for high health builds
---
* 50% is a great dmg buff
---
* You can decrease stats instead of health for dmg like bloodied
---
* Great for Heavy builds
---
Con's:
---
* Addictions will decrease your stats so careful what you get addicted to
---
* If you get addicted to pscyho than when you take the drug you lose 10% dmg and than gain the drugs dmg buff
---
* If you get to many addictions or accidentally use an addictol than you have to farm for your addictions again.
---
Hitting level 2 doesn‚Äôt count for the S.C.O.R.E. Challenge, spending 5 mins getting to level 3 afterwards does though
---
As a new bloodied build I couldn't see myself running 20% health
---
God, me too. If her radio station had music I'd never listen to Appalachia Radio again.
---
Nice. Free score is free score. Doesn't take but a second to run to the overseer's camp and make some shit lol
---
Like the mother deathclaw in fallout3
---
I have the same issue too
---
That would be great especially in the bunker since they have to fix the floor lots of bunkers have basements
---
Wait, you can have a pet?
---
AGREED. Gimme a punky station or something. Keep it mostly her commentary, but something other than elevator music would be amazing.
---
There are some great .ini file edits you can do to improve performance quite a bit (including a frame rate uncap). I‚Äôd give it a goog‚Äôs, some reddit posts and videos that can walk you trough it far better than I can
---
It's a post apocalyptic wasteland where the strong survive.  Strong in this instance being the triple digit level guy.  That means the workshop belongs to him, along with the junk you dropped.  That's how the the wasteland works.  If you're not a raider, then maybe play more like a settler and bring a crew with you.  Strength in numbers.  If you can't do that, then best to steer clear of areas that are dangerous like that.
---
No need for the chem resistance perk because you can just take the chems you‚Äôre addicted to to negate effects. Unless you want to use other chems as well.
---
Personally, for my Junkies build I am addicted to Alcohol, Overdrive, Mentats, Psycho and Daddy-O. I use a heavy weapons build.
---
That one is decent only if you run Stabilized
---
I lost 12,250 SCORE today. :(
---
I do this when people don't hit the boss and just farm the spawns. It's hilarious to see these screw farmers suddenly start throwing everything they can at the boss when there's like 2 minutes left but fail cause he was at 80% health at that time
---
Not all of us have private servers but there are still plenty of challenges that we have to capture workshops for.
---
I do run stabilized, is that not optimal?
---
You can tame certain creatures or all not really sure but you can tame by getting the perk under charisma
---
Literally!
---
It's the second best build after bloodied. You can either go full health or use a bloodied package but just with the flexibility that you won't be punished when you go above 50% health.
---
Selecting your addictions matters so look up the effects and choose wisely. though it can matter less so with the bloodied package if you use unyielding armour.
---
Also you need to get a bunch of chems to start. You need to spam between like 5-10 chems so it's good to have up to 8-10 of each of the things you want to get addicted to.
---
Since you aren‚Äôt doing bloodied, TSE and AAE are what you‚Äôll want for legendary effects. And about your Gatling laser... it‚Äôs okay? I mean it‚Äôs no legacy laser which are the most broken things in the game, but it will do you well I guess. The best economic heavy weapon is the .50cal with making 180 bullets (2* ammosmith).
---
YOUUUUU SHALLLLL NOT PAAAAAAAASSSSSSS(gas)
---
There was a bug where an adventure mode quest gave perk cards. It's been fixed
---
I would love this...they were something to be feared in the earlier games. In 76 they just aren't very tough.
---
That‚Äôs the entry to the hollow earth where the troglodytes live. Beware!
---
Soon buddy, soon...
---
This is a great tip bud, thanks!
---
Or you know... run serendipity. I‚Äôve only died to Earle so far because he pushed my shit in when I was in melee range w/ my DCG
---
I'd rather die than keep my health at 40% and do shit damage
---
The tent, backpack, and Responders poster boards all released alongside the power armor during its initial launch months ago. The posters were released in the bundle, the backpack went for 500 atoms separately, and the power armor went for 1200. Descriptions made it clear which items were included in what. If people wanted all the Responders items, they were free to buy them on the ATX or through FO 1st at the time. You cannot fault Bethesda for re-using its initial photos of the power armor.
---
The TS will split the damage between the projectiles, so they get reduced by ER more than a single projectile would.
---
I was with you... till i learned some farming tricks to make enough en mass to make a few hours worth... and if u do it right u only need the base ammt. But chem fiend helps. And herbavore or carnivore for foods too.
---
I use a be +1p railway rifle
---
What system you on and how much do you need?
---
Speakng of stash boxes, is Bethesda is planing to increase the storage weight compacity or no?
---
PS4 1 pure violet 4 pure cobalt
---
I sometimes roll with 1hp then I pass by a firecracker berry bush...
---
Builds that were stacking multiple damage buffs and doing heaps of damage were nerfed the most. Especially low health builds. Even more if you were using stealth. If you weren't doing that, you won't see too much of difference and it's not as bad as people cry about. Of course bloodied builds gonna cry but  they really shouldn't drag other builds in to justify their ranting
---
Can you explain under what conditions its good?
---
Yeah, I got lured in by Grahm's event on the hour üòü
---
What do you expect? 
---
I have a character that is constantly rolled back, and thus unplayable. I've lost legendaries, supplies, etc. due to looting them and then being rolled back *twenty minutes*. 
---
Their reply, is to check my internet.
---
He said it perfectly. I use an explosive Junkies heavy build and you will have amazing health and do high damage.
---
I literally throw unused ammo on the ground rather than use that stupid thing. I dismantled it at my camp and never looked back. If it‚Äôs not .45 or 5.56, it gets dumped at the nearest Train Station.
---
What a waste of a good concept that thing is.
---
I believe 'Phase Bravo will' start on Thursday. 
---
But they could possibly surprise us and begin it today, after all 'Phase Alpha' started 4 days earlier than expected (August 4th, was originally scheduled for August 8th) so i wouldn't be surprised if it starts a day earlier.
---
I been bailing if I see anyone with a tesla rifle or gatling plasma in the lobby. I love the shovel, but I been a shovel main for a few weeks now lol
---
Hold the close button.
---
Atom Shop update for those on their 4th attempt to fast travel.
---
For Xbox Srry we just hold down b which I‚Äôm guessing is equivalent to O on  ps4 and it instantly backed us out of the ammo converter terminal screen
---
If you're on PC, get the mod that came out weeks after launch.
---
O...M...G.  THANKS!
---
~~Your gatling laser is a beast but only due to a bug with the weapon.~~ Edit: misread the secondary effect. It's not that good afterall. Rest still applies.
---
Bugged weapons aside though (not in any particular order), Ultracite gatling (even without prime receiver), gauss minigun and 50 cal machine gun are good options. The gatling gun (the ones that shoots bullets) is good for non-boss encounters as it's very ammo efficient i.e. does a lot of damage per bullet. However, you'd probably want one of the other 3 for the big fights.
---
Excavator is only useful for carry weight and mining. If you're only ever going to carry 1 suit, it's better than nothing but you're better off with a more combat-oriented suit and either carry the excavator as well or leave it in stash until you need it for mining ore.
---
As for legendary effects, Junkie's is your best option for not low health (but you can still get adrenal reaction mutation for when you do start to lose health to buff damage). You can go with an off-meta pick of vampiric if you want to be a mega tanky unstoppable force, especially with a high DPS weapon.
---
I have been running ammosmith but currently to make 5mm for my gatling gun or minigun when I'm not hurting for bullets/gunpowder. Also are TSE and AAE short for Two Shot Executioner and Anti-Armor Executioner?
---
Run Healing Hands
---
You should try aiming for a junkies weapon, junkies provides the most damage output right behind bloodied and of course, you can run full health. And me personally I hate two shot heavy weapons, If junkies isn't your fancy, Anti armor is a great alternative
---
I‚Äôve seen people getting the best drops on their first run of ACP and saying it‚Äôs an amazing event but for the people like men that have just been fucked over by the event it doesn‚Äôt seem worth the ammo
---
No. I like to buy stuff too but the point being, people that have been playing for awhile don't have to spend real money to buy the pass or portions of the pass in exchange for bullion for 10 weeks.
---
You're an exploiter enjoy your ban you criminal
---
I have a level 50 set of X01 so I should be using that instead of Excavator then right?
---
In every cod game If you get 30 kills before dying you can call in a nuke
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 as BruceHavokMills but I won‚Äôt be on for another 2.5-3 hours. 
---
If you still need it then and your around, add me and we can jump on a private server (I‚Äôve got fallout 1st). I‚Äôll just drop it for you no charge, I‚Äôve got enough.
---
I can only imagine. ü§£üò≠ All that ammo and time.
---
Word
---
I don't mind doing junkie but I should probably stop selling chems if I do go that way right?
---
I run Serendipity but I was the one carrying and nobody helped haha. I died so many times...
---
I still can‚Äôt event go into the thing in my PA and even if I do go into it it still a chore to do
---
the difference in DR is negligible, I think you'll find most high level players are using excavator if they are using PA. nothing other than assaultrons consistantly dish out enough damage to really worry about and the vastly increased carry weight and mining ability is much more useful than increased DR
---
The community is the only reason the game is still alive.
---
are u on Xbox? Looking for a Tenderizer plan
---
Need this. Candyland 76 players will downvote and disagree.
---
Same here accept add 50 cal on for my sniper. Other than that I have a habit of picking ammo up and then just throw it on the ground.
---
If you side with foundation you can get a Chinese stealth suit for free and it makes soloing silos easy as fuck
---
Wish it was secretly a ghoul sanctuary.
---
No shit sherlock that's how a game works.
---
Maybe it was an inside joke between the devs lol like ‚Äúlets name this deathclaw island freak people out but only have a baby deathclaw in it.‚Äù Lol
---
I have lots of peek coins, how many you want ?
---
Here's a tip: the game is exactly the same on all platforms
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not great when you are the main one doing damage. Best group I‚Äôve had had 2 people always clearing the adds so everyone else could focus on Earle, they did damage him so they‚Äôd get loot, but they mainly focused on the other spawns
---
Thank you
---
Hey don‚Äôt judge lol I‚Äôm level 390 and I missed my jump and serendipity didn‚Äôt save me
---
Hold "B" on Xbox.
---
All you need is to get addicted, not use them constantly.
---
Use about 5-10 of the chem and you should be addicted....and that's it! That's literally all you need to do to become a junkies build, after that you don't ever have to touch another chem in your life. My 5 addictions are,
---
* Alcohol
---
* Daytripper
---
* Med-x
---
* Buffout
---
* Psycho 
---
Most people will switch out psycho for something else as it has -10 damage resistance but i don't really care on my PA tank heavy gunner. Just for gods sake don't get addicted to x-cell.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
No. TSE and AAE are Two shot explosive and Anti-armor explosive. You can‚Äôt have Executioner on them as well as AA/TS.
---
Congrats!  I just unlocked the Gatling gun skin so wherever that is, I'm close.  Once I finished NW in 3 minutes I'll have whatever the next level is.
---
Which perks are you using to maximize that damage? Mine is like 114.
---
Gotta nuke their camp afterwards. You'll proc another ACP and they flee the server in panic. Win win!
---
Awesome thanks for the explanation, I'll definitely keep my eyes out for Junkies weapons then, as that sounds fun and flavorful lol
---
Yeah that seems smart. On my Bloodied, my weapons broke as well and I didn‚Äôt have kits on that toon. No lie though, I took Earl basically solo with a JE Plasma bc there was 2 lower levels that had DCG‚Äôs and that didn‚Äôt turn out well lol. I used like 3-4 repair kits and 5 cores.
---
Oh okay, thank you for explaining :)
---
This is new. I just checked and I had exactly 60 new card packs. I was there for the random 120 a few months back, but now there are 60 more. Just opened em and gained 2 levels!
---
There's a perk card that will inject a stem pack when falling below 20%. I forget which one it is although I use it anytime I go into battle.
---
Vampires is also a good combination with high health builds and fast fire rate
---
LOL I fast traveled and when I spawned it happened.  Not sure how that is exploiting anything.  I literally made this post because I DON'T know how it's happening.
---
Yeah lol I knew i was forgetting one prefix, I just couldn't think of it! I had a mAgIcAl vamps bash minigun on my heavy build and that thing melted anything in its path. I loved that gun!
---
Unfortunately, you cannot drop these weapons or sell them because you need to buy the plans with Gold Bullion. Anything acquired through that currency cannot be dropped nor sold.
---
Make sure you look at the list of addiction effects to get addicted to chems that won‚Äôt affect your build
---
Man after getting one of the first reclaimed gas masks on PS4, I was hoping to trade for a legacy laser from someone but no dice.. but yeah I was running my BE HM and my DCG, ran through most of my kits I had on me, not a fun time.
---
Cap
---
Agreed.. but then again thats kinda every game, 76 however has THE best group of whiney little crybaby brats ive ever had the pleasure of playing with. Luvya you overgrown man/women babies. Wouldnt trade you fukers for anyone else.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëç
---
Ugh.  Is that better or worse than a level 22 joining your instance?
---
I remember how jumpy and nervous I was creeping around that bloody island first time ,low level,..now I just go there for a Deathclaw omelette/steak breakfast
---
YESSSS!
---
It is ultimately Bethesda's responsibility. That's really the long and short of it.
---
It's their systems that got exploited this hard. It's obviously not Bethesda's fault that the exploits happened but they:
---
1. Launched the system in this state with known exploits from past games that modders themselves had fixed that Bethesda chose not to do
---
2. Clearly didn't allow for enough testing time during beta to deal with a lot of issues prior to launch
---
3. Once exploited, Bethesda were:
---
   1. Slow to act to both fix the problem and remove the bad players
---
   2. Didn't devote enough resource to fixing the problem
---
   3. Did bandaid solutions rather than deal with the core issue at the heart of the issue.
---
Also, who is going to fix all these issues? The community? Bitch please...
---
We don't have to do dick for Bethesda. We're paying customers. There is an expectation of service and quality that they're not meeting. 
---
Yes, there are bad actors in the community, making no excuses for them, but we have zero responsibility as a player base to do anything for Bethesda. We pay them do deliver a product and service and it's up to them to deliver on that. 
---
Sadly, you'd have to admit from the evidence presented that Bethesda do a pretty poor job of holding up their end of this deal.
---
It really is a dick move to blame the player base for what is ultimately a Bethesda problem to solve.
---
and that's why I can't even find a 1\* heavy metal left leg...thanks for investigating!!
---
I didn‚Äôt think anyone would believe I solo killed the big boss but it happened haha! The legacy lasers are insanely ridiculous for high DPS. Each scatter of the plasma does like 200-400 plus the pellets from explosive and a 250 round clip... sheesh hahaha. Hopefully you can get your legacy soon! Took me a lot of trades to get it but it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Welcome to the heavy gang :)
---
Armour mod recommendations - calibrated shock are expensive but the only way forward. Body, for a full health build, I would recommend medic pump. Head is more of a flavour choice but I tend to go for the mod that highlights enemies. Arms.. There's not much that's really useful so choose what you want
---
Weapons, there are so many to choose from. I personally run with a junkies ultracite gatling laser, a TSE 50 cal and a vampires minigun. The junkies is my big hitter, the 50cal is my "tag everything for loot and xp" gun and my vampires is my "solo sbq and ACP" baby.
---
That 2S ultracite gatling is actually very good, especially if you take the perk power user, which ups your shots per fusion core to 1k.
---
Full health build dmg prefixes at the mo go bloodied, junkies, AA, TS, Furious. Personally, from a survivability, I throw vampires in there, because quite honestly I'm almost immortal at this point :)
---
If youre on ps4 want to play with some other types of big guns (lmg, gatling plasma) let me know, I have a biiiiig collection
---
Nah they won't animate these
---
Do you include youreself as part of the community?
---
Outside of the Quarry in New Vegas, this little island still makes my skin crawl thinking about it. Deathclaws used to be so terrifying. Now I can have a picnic with ONE Deathclaw in 76.
---
(01)
---
(02)
---
You're welcome
---
That's a cop out and you know it.  It's a game and not some place where people that have more time to play get to steamroll over beginners and casual players.  Are you telling me that I basically have to steer clear of a portion of the game just because higher level players should be allowed to do what they want in low level areas?  That's bullcrap and you know it.
---
That's a keeper.
---
Ps4?
---
Unless you CBF with switching to suits to make the most of their strengths, yeah, I'd stick to the X-01
---
Yeah. I play the game, but I don't do the dumb shit that ruins the game and pins Bethesda against the wall like so many others.
---
Yes, they do.  They give you more space.
---
What's that twirling thing next to your username? I'd like to get something similar.
---
Same happend to me, it's nothing to do with NW as I don't play it, make sure you aren't logged in at the reset time, it seems to reapply the previous completion state on the new tasks if you do.
---
Tldr; mad cuz bad
---
If you mean magic weapons, TS isn't a magic prefix
---
wrong
---
What do you think majority of the community does?   
---
Maybe Bethesda needs to handle the bad actors smarter than they have?
---
I know a lot of people are disappointed with it but it seems like Bethesda listens to the complaints from time to time and they mentioned they would be taking feedback from Season 1 so hopefully we get the Fallout 1st Extras in S2 as well as stuff for ALL players. Suggestions included atoms, ammo, bullion etc. Although I had fun with it, I was so happy to be done so it would have to be some pretty good post-SCORE rewards to keep me grinding.
---
More space for perk cards, but not past the cap of 15 per SPECIAL
---
you might as well know about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs), if you don't already.
---
Don't lose hope yet! It can still come just give it time. Serving hopping can actually help as it resets its health if it runs into enemies.
---
Just saw someones post about how disappointing deathclaw island is, and we all seem to agree on how cool it would be if there was a cave you drop into somewhere on the island, with a new deathclaw boss.
---
Just make the event more deadly. They'll work it out and not come back until they're ready.
---
No way to transfer other than ways that might get you banned.  I suppose you could try to buy a whole account from someone.
---
For sure!
---
It's best against targets with low ER. It's terrible against enemies like Glowing Ghouls or SBQ with high ER.
---
Use Awareness perk to memorize who resists that gun.
---
TS is not magic but it can push the effective fire rate up into magic range if there is another magic effect such as increase VATS hit chance or you have magic armor
---
Remember the music change when you got close. Shiver.
---
Can't you open your pip boy, go to events under the missions tab and see them?
---
You're right but for the wrong reason. I mistook the fast fire rate for one of the other effects.
---
I'll adjust my comment accordingly. Thanks for that!
---
ROT IN TODD JAIL HACKER
---
What does the text box say when you click on a workshop?
---
Reminds me of Make Love, Not Warcraft episode of South Park. "What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game."
---
That's ironic, because these Wendigos *are* the BOS
---
Yeah but the gun in question has ffrfr and power armour. The ffr alone pushes the ultracite gatling into magic range, but it's not junkies, stalkers or instigating. No magic effect on this specific weapon, just a LOT of numbers
---
It's meant to be encountered when you're low level. It's terrifying when you're level 8. 2-3 hits and you're dead.
---
social menu goes down all the time :/
---
N i scripped it yesterday... üòÖ
---
Dude I'm not arguing against pvp, I'm arguing about there being zero sport or fun for a level 100+ to be camping a low level area near vault 76.  If they actually wanted a challenge then they wouldn't be sniping low level people and would be at a high level workshop.
---
No gunshots = no ghost.
---
He died to fall damage when he spawned in. Nothing new, happens all the time.
---
Ahh... that's a standard card for a bloodied build. That's pretty much a given.
---
If these players are constantly dying with serendipity (and other other relevant bloodied perks), they need something else, hence the post.
---
Ok thank you!
---
i was so glad when i finished it, finally get to PLAY the game again
---
Hmm maybe stop using turrets because they make more enemies spawn in
---
And im saying about possible dupe. If someone finds a way to put bullion items to collectron, other people can loot it.
---
Most of them are so easy to find or are rewarded.    
---
I sell them for cheap and can get rid of a small chunk. I'm going to end up dumping a lot more. We should be able to sell anything we can loot or get as rewards.
---
Depends on the player, most people I see just go for bigger numbers so choose to go bloody mess instead
---
Click my username, view profile, click the picture, then click the dots in top right and download, then edit your profile and use said downloaded image. Bosh. (On mobile btw)
---
you also can't get TSE or any explosive energy weapons anymore. they exist but are legacy and EXTREMELY valuable.
---
Yes, all explosions = all aoe damage.
---
This will include Legendary Perk Hack n Slash
---
I think you are getting unfortunately upset by very silly things.
---
 Bethesda has made some mistakes, but overall is learning. MMO'S are a tricky thing. I find 76 to be enjoyable and so I play it.
---
  A community, literally any community, will have a mix of favorable and unfavorable members. Unfavorable members are hard to miss. I risk understatement when I say this community has a lot of great members. Focus on the good ones.
---
Otherwise, maybe take a break. It is not worth getting so upset. I dont know you, but I hope you are able to relax soon. It's going to be ok friend.
---
All three of the cursed weapons appear as if they do not show up on your display shelves. It is a bug which hopefully will be fixed eventually
---
Mainframe cores can't be destroyed by explosions. For like that whole year
---
Thanks mate
---
Yes they can? Just did earlier today
---
Wtf are you on about you strange little man.
---
It's like Deathclaw Quarry except it's nothing like it.
---
Please accept my humble thank you.
---
Alcohol , daddy-o , daytripper , mentats &amp; psycho are doing the job for me . 
---
Pretty small setbacks for a commando build
---
I'm mad at the community not the game. I don't give a shit. I'm just sick of people complaining about things they caused
---
This post is brought to you by Todd Howard.
---
Have your upvote good sir
---
Pve only hard hats think they're exempt from pvp
---
Yeah I mean a game having glitches is one thing and devs getting shat on for that is totally understandable. But those same people that talked shit about them glitches abusing the hell out of it just doesn't make any sense. Bunch of hypocrites. I really don't understand why some people call fallout 76 community one of the greatest cause it just isn't. It's as toxic as any other game community and you have to add hypocrisy on top of that which makes it far worse than others
---
Agree completely. Short of that when I see mostly lower level players, I bail out. Not interested in wasting my ammo and aid. 
---
Having said that, I‚Äôve completed this event a bunch of times now and have to say it‚Äôs pretty awesome. There is so much to discover and figure out while running around killing swarms of wendigos, looting them and trying to do as much damage to Earl as possible without dying all the time. I think I‚Äôll have to do it many more times to really feel like I have figured things out completely.
---
Thankfully I haven‚Äôt encountered any bugs as of yet (PS4), So it has been a great experience so far.
---
This post is brought to you by a person who is sick of the community being hypocrites
---
When you're first introduced to it at like level 10-15 when that "scavenger" at the fairgrounds wants an egg it was absolutely terrifying the moment the game said "Discovered: Deathclaw Island". Absolutely not a missed opportunity there, but it would be nice to have an event for higher level players to revisit the island for more than just a daily challenge.
---
If you go into a workshop, you are expecting pvp. If you don't agree, *you are the one lying to yourself*. Participating in Pvp does not make you an asshole. Go play Candyland
---
I'd guild this if I could. I'm not sure what you're going for your PHD in, but I enjoyed your dissertation!
---
My point, but no one understands that.
---
No, not really.
---
Bloody mess is also standard card too. I've never seen an either-or situation. It's both or working to get both.
---
Next you're going to say that Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction are optional choices for a bloodied build as well...
---
Thanks bro, do you know about overdrive‚Äôs price range?
---
Would that work well for a shotgun build also?
---
I was on pc today and lvl 930 player no life
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm not looking for sport.  I'm looking for junk.  I don't care which workshop it is.  If I look on the map and I see an owned workshop and a player dot, I'm fast traveling there and I'm engaging that person because I want what they are carrying.  Junk is junk no matter what level the person is.  I don't care if they are level 1.  They are getting got.  Honestly the lower the level the better, because more times than not they haven't learned yet to stash their junk early and often, so it's like shooting a junk pinata.  Again - don't want to pvp, don't enter pvp areas.
---
had no idea this quest triggered that event, until we triggered it yesterday :( failed it miserably. but kudos to the level 18 who showed up and not only stayed back and watched (smart move) but also stimpak'd us a bunch of times as we tried to figure out what the hell we were doing haha I hope it was entertaining for them at least lol
---
You gave me an idea...
---
Brb...need to build a camp
---
havent played the game in a month so theres no way that i can finish it
---
Well since were not attacking we can run around and heal you higher up dudes
---
&gt; Participating in Pvp does not make you an asshole. 
---
Is NW where the whole point is PvP, absolutely agree. No question at all.
---
In a game mode that is mostly PvE and was made even more PvE due to overwhelming player response, yeah, you're being an arsehole initiating PvP.
---
You're allowed to be because the game allows it. No exploits, hacking etc. Still doesn't make you any less of an arsehole. Sorry, you just are.
---
Yeah I think most people sell them at a ridiculous prices like 67-88 caps in the last 3 severs a pop on Xbox, so I just wanted some clarification; if I miss judge their prices.
---
Totally. I‚Äôm over it for a while.
---
That doesn‚Äôt show every available event though, only the ones that you‚Äôve joined
---
Don't go into pvp zones if you aren't ready for pvp. It isn't trolling if you set yourself up for it. Go back to Candyland, you're not ready for the Wasteland
---
Completed 100% of the achievements on Xbox
---
Go play on a private server if you're allergic to lead
---
I think calling Meg‚Äôs group ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù is a mistake, as many have said. Survivalist fits far better.
---
Oh that's so insane, I don't even believe that you saw those numbers.
---
Of course it depends on the chem but you're talking like 5-25ish from my experience but yeah, you'd have to look around to find out what the overall average is.
---
I dunno. I'm about to AFK the event and all the drums and split are taken so I'm sitting in a chair.
---
agreed, i want the wastelander beard
---
Believe me, it is fun for them to see you ask for it over and over
---
Man they can't arrive soon enough! I really need to save what little atoms I have left for it
---
Poor pony
---
How much luck do you run with? You‚Äôd need at the very least 11 for what you are talking about.
---
If drums and spits are all taken im okish with afk ppl but there were open spits and drums
---
I did level 34,37, and 54 all selling them at those prices and then some people were selling them at base price
---
Why would it be in the public teams menu. You can just see them all on your map.
---
some plans are locked even on 3K each , with best bartening skills u could sell one for 600caps, Bethesda would need to rewrite all the prices for plans but thats just too much work for them i assume
---
I feel attacked
---
Nope. Following the rules laid down by the game does not make you an asshole.
---
Guess what, 2021 road map is all about bringing more PVP back to adventure mode.
---
Lube up, pi√±ata
---
I remember hearing about it before I started playing, and I went there finally at level 30. Ended up killing it with 3 hits from my non-legendary double barrel, wondering where the fuck the other deathclaws were
---
You must be new here.  This topic is probably the number 1 rant on fo76; the bug has been around for a long time...  Bethesda has acknowledged it, but there‚Äôs no remedy yet.
---
That‚Äôs true - honestly I‚Äôm just a big fan of how the actual outfit looks &amp; not the armor itself
---
I heard someone mention that sneak attacks won't work if someone in the whole event is seen or heard but thats gotta be wrong. That means it only takes one person being seen for stealth builds to break during the fight
---
Tell me how a level ten sets himself up to take on a level 100+?  Please educate me.  I'd really love to hear what your solution is besides "not going to a pvp zone".  You're lame attempt at trolling isn't quite working out that well
---
I think they're good at world-building and it was a lot of fun discovering the map but they really need to hire some creative people that can actually come up with storylines that don't suck. I've logged about 300 hours so I don't think it's accurate to say I don't like the game.
---
Was afk the event so I guess its what I get huh
---
You missed the entire point of the post
---
It's because PC players can actually aim at things without their shooting pattern looking like some sort of deformed Z, so it's not as noticable.
---
Awesome ty!
---
I would say yes! Shotguns fall under the STR category so I don‚Äôt see why not. :)
---
The grind isn't in the leveling it's in the other elements of the game. I don't really play with anyone but I can certainly understand it as a fun place to hang out.
---
they're stupidly strong and for no goddamm reason it seems. None that makes any actually sense at least
---
Vampire's is great with low health, tbh.  Way harder to die than bloodied, but still quite a bit of damage from adrenal reaction and need rage.
---
That seems kind of lazy when you could literally go to random parts of the map to find more junk than what you'd find on a new person.  All they'd have is wood, cloth, and steel.  Pretty sure Endgame players are looking for more than that like adhesive and screws.  What would even be the point in this other than to be a dick to new players?
---
When I went there a couple of days ago, the deathclaw wasn't even there!
---
At least on the weapon damage calculator a Gauss Minigun that would do ~1800 damage a second would instead do ~1500 damage a second (With all heavy gunner perks maxed, bloody mess, stabilized). If they released on wasteland but held off on the weapon nerfs to either nerf each individual gun that needs it or buff others and release it later maybe that would be better. imo bloodied needs a bit of a nerf like 15-25%. Imagine how many messages you‚Äôd get if you solo‚Äôd an end game raid boss in 20 secs in WoW.
---
This. A dungeon like the burrows would be cool, Deathclaws needs some love. In 76 they have not been a menace from the start.
---
That's what I was thinking. I'll give it test when I stop getting infinite loading screens.
---
Good luck to you buddy! It‚Äôs a fun build to go for, I‚Äôd recommend at least 5 points in INT for Demolition Expert if you want to do an explosive build.
---
Yeah, high luck is pretty standard dude. It's very common for a commando version to go to 15. Obviously you don't need as much if you're not going commando but it's still decently high. I wouldn't go below 11 personally but you can get away with 9 if needed.
---
Hell, I'd take 20 atoms. Or set unrealistic goals like every 5000 score after level 100 awards 50 atoms. I'm quarantined since the season starts so this has become what we do for family fun most of the day so I'm going to be playing anyway (my daughter is excited to be learning to play. She just had 2 top 10 NW finishes in a row, so a bunch of you just got schooled by a 6 year old girl, just saying....) but if they're going to have challenges, they should be rewarding forever, because the bonus challenge week that I donated for is going to get my wife to 100 but I finished with double score weekend on Sunday, so this is not doing me any favors.
---
The prompt when you claim a workshop:
---
&gt; *"Spend x Caps to Claim this Workshop. Other players may initiate PVP with you by attempting to Claim it from you!"*
---
Your lame attempt at not reading isn't quite working out that well.
---
Running around buildings picking up junk stops being fun pretty quick.
---
Oh yeah, I swap between that and gunsmith. My builds pretty much done for the most part, just wanna get more damage.
---
From the mine
---
Damn, I‚Äôm sitting at 8... always have been. BM/Seren, Starched, and class.
---
&gt; Nope. Following the rules laid down by the game does not make you an asshole. 
---
Lol, the logical fallacies...
---
If you were forced to go PvP in order to get a workshop at all, sure, once again not an arsehole. It's a choice though.
---
If you're forced to kill someone because you're in a war, that's one thing. When you're not in such a situation and you choose to, once again, arsehole.
---
&gt; Lube up, pi√±ata 
---
Yeah, definitely not what an arsehole says at all... Thanks for proving my point :)
---
.....
---
F76 seasons are ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù? What game have you been playing? Soooo many score glitches, multiple issues with cosmetic rewards, we got the same armor skin 6 times for each armor type...
---
And people don‚Äôt trade caps for god-tier items because of inflation and item rarity, nothing else. I‚Äôve never duped, glitched, or anything like it. I‚Äôve got 150k caps in ‚Äúreserve‚Äù plus 5 active characters with anywhere between 5 and 25k caps apiece. 
---
Rush the devs constantly? We have zero power over the devs, as is blindingly obvious. What we do have is very little patience for them, because they are slow as fuck to fix things, to the point of there being issues in game that have been here since launch. And they apparently have terrible version control and standards, because the exact same bugs keep coming back, and they keep doing the same stupid shit with ‚Äúnew‚Äù content (I‚Äôm looking at you Grelok skin; how the hell does a skin remove a legendary effect? Oh wait, we already went through this with the Stanley skin!)
---
Just drop them
---
Lol this thread.
---
permanent boss
---
I‚Äôm 99% same build (Adrenaline3 instead of actionboy) and weapon, and instead of how fast, since I‚Äôm always in public servers, I challenge myself to count how many wendigo spawns I kill during the event (gotta get adrenaline going to make up dps lost to no stealth) vs how many times Earl makes me run away scared shitless lol
---
So far my best is 57/3
---
So what does that mean the odds of getting one are? I'm expecting it to be 1/100th of a percent.
---
But the ammo convertor is so useful and easy to use! /s
---
I feel the same way lol
---
If you have unyielding, do you really need class freak? There are some other builds that opt for more crit/damage perks instead.
---
Well there is a reason for that. The ranged damage on swamp fever is capped. But you don't need 1000 bullets. Just shoot very slow. Blap wait 2 seconds. Blap. But ya I get your meaning. My main spec is melee, but its kind of a pain for me in the colossal problem event because of the color blindness. When I am up close I literally cant see anything, its just all black. So there may be a way to work the melee in it but I just cannot. But aiming I can kind of use vats assist. But ya, I can not figure out why people are complaining about this for the life of me. Maybe after the damage nerf, but I can't say for sure I have not tested anything or read anything about the nerf.
---
Tldr; go swing your All Rise around
---
Sadly yes, it was particularly painful this time due to the extra challenges being wiped out... It certainly sucks.
---
Lol yeah no me and my Freind were the lowest there, at 35 and 30 apiece. And we definetly tried to help, but nothing worked. Even his really nice legendary lmg that had shredded things before didn‚Äôt do shit. And I was so unprepared. Had like 20 stimpacks on me and 90 rounds in my revolver.
---
What the studio really needs to try is just include them in perk card packs. While they're blank. Then we can accumulate the coins necessary to fill them.
---
I don't really understand why it's limited to 8 anyway? I know it's a bit of a smaller room but the queen isn't limited, why is Earle? Is there any reason behind it?
---
And yes, the launcher should obviously be allowed in. In fact the event shouldn't even show up on the map for other players until the launcher has joined first.
---
‚ÄúNegligible gameplay difference‚Äù. 
---
Damage dropping by half isn‚Äôt exactly negligible.
---
You'll never change the minds of fools. Ignoring them is the best path.
---
I'm not saying that pvp is wrong, I never said it was.  I'm talking about high level characters basically bullying low level ones out of boredom.  You quoting the text doesn't prove me wrong in anyway.  I'm honestly wondering if you're even reading what I'm saying fully before you respond.
---
I don't really see this as a problem, maybe its just me. I've played the event pretty consistently since it launched on PC with players as low as level 20 and not once have I seen the event fail or otherwise. Sure they aren't technically contributing as much but I respect there effort especially at lower levels when your still struggling for ammo and chems. I get far more enjoyment out of saving their asses and watching them give it THEIR best then I do rolling through it with a bunch of vets in 5 minutes. The event is chaotic and that's what makes it fun.
---
I agree. Meg's group is a far cry from the Fiends, the Eighties, or the Nuka World Raiders. But I think Raider is just a term they accept because of branding.
---
Yeah I get that, at least you're honest.
---
You're an arsehole for doing so but I respect the effort all the same. It's the price you pay for going afk in that fashion. 
---
Hell, you can afk on the drums and still spin yourself around. At least then you'd be useful.
---
Did you put your tent in grahams cookout? If so, only fix was hopping into private world it would respawn outside the event range then move tent outside the cookout area and traveled to 76, then could respawn again normally.
---
I hope so
---
Can it be nuked?
---
Their not releasing it in that state. They said that that damage calculation change was just the first step.
---
You say no to PVP by running or fast traveling. üëì
---
I went in on my level 10 alt, it was its first day out (on Xbox) and one of the first on the servers.
---
I went in thinking it would be just like any other event and I could just see what it was all about, I hung out for 5ish minutes and realised it was not for me, but I was the only one rezzing fallen players so I stuck it out til the end but I won't be going back ever again unless on a high character with proper gear.
---
Yea I've seen some level 10s just like yup I'm he.. And I was very luckey only did 2 runs to get that sexy looking helmet that has a 5% drop rate
---
Just had like 5 people leave the event to go do primal cuts which is dumb
---
You damage number nuts are adorable. 
---
Try it first hand in the PTS or just watch both Angry Turtle or Innovsurvivalist's videos on the topic. It's pretty much a non-issue in terms of combat effectiveness for all but the boss creatures and a few specific weapons.
---
It really is a negligible difference.
---
Nope, when it all went to shit I was trying to FT from ACP event to my camp. I've tried loading into adventure and private but neither work. Gets stuck at the same spot.
---
Only used it twice, once when I got it and again when it got ‚Äúupdated‚Äù. Absolute rubbish.
---
Get the impression the only dev left doesn‚Äôt even play the game and see how his/her creations function/not function
---
Oh darn
---
I was starting to think I was the only one. Every time I say this I get down voted. F76 is feeling like a amusement park and not a post nuclear role playing game. 
---
Saw someones headcanon on here once. We are the control group. We are send out in advance to help prepare the actual best and brightest, what to expect in the wasteland. Every time we die they send out another clone of us. Sometimes the cloning doesn't work to well, and people that were friends in the faults attack each other, wear silly costumes, runs towards a nuke dropping from the sky and so on. A new player exits the vault a new test subject is let loose.
---
Me! And apparently a few other people too
---
I am. I'm saying that you are not exempt from PVP because you're playing on a low level.
---
Same as me being destroyed playing the drums at Meat Cook because I had a bounty. I couldn't fight back and it doesn't matter.
---
yeah that feature doesnt seem to work with events sicne it changes players to the orange, so it only works if both you and them havent been in an event since login, known issue.
---
Yeah. Acp is another issue that has weird issues. 
---
Especially if you happened to do anything at the exact moment the event is ending or mine is collapsing. 
---
Have you tried loading into nw for a match and then going back, especially joining friends world. My only suggestion other than contact support.
---
Huh, so that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt there when I jumped down the shaft
---
Give em 200 years and see what's left surviving.
---
Worse. There ARE washing machines all over the place and you can build a fusion reactor and water purifier, not to mention a working refrigerator, so DON'T tell me it's not doable! I'll even load it up with abraxo if I need to!
---
that's weird. You can also try to put it on the sign that we got from slocum's Joe. You know, the one that says Good-morning? (i think it says good-morning, i am at work now i don't remember)
---
I did that the other day too. Except these guys were running around trying to look like they were helping lol and they wondered why we didn't complete it in the full 7 minutes available
---
I sent in a support ticket. Haven't tried loading into NW yet, I'll try that. Staring to think my Xbone is just starting to crap out as I'm getting long load times in other games. Had to wait for the download, so didnt know till now. ü§¶
---
I want the ZZ top and a guitar sword with the double Z logo.  If you encounter another you can jam and the beards swing in unison.
---
Rifleman and gunslinger builds are are already very weak. This update will render them useless.
---
Its definitely possible, and I say that because I have died during the event and had the stupid af glitch happen. Feel so sorry for everyone else who's there when this happens as I know I can dish out dps to finish him if need be.
---
I'd love to visit nuka cola world again!  I'm not great at timelines so I dont know if in this game it would be super shiny and new?
---
All the power armor chassis bugs.
---
The only bugs that didn't make it are bugs like "Tina DeLuca won't give voice lines when recruited as a settler"
---
Energy armor pen got half fixed. Only base damage (like 32) gets armor pen, buffs wont.
---
It‚Äôs the worst feeling, just standing in the corner while everyone else scrambles to down Earl, whilst being a man short.
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs unstable when there‚Äôs too many people in the same instance like that, because the game engine is shit
---
Hold onto them, when they do the next NW event that offers cosmetics open the packs, all duplicates give exp when traded in.
---
Excellent job but don't share usernames here
---
Or just not play an animation at all would be better imo
---
How much u hitting with an explosive heavy?
---
Perform exploit to buy it from [redacted].
---
I guess you just miss the opportunity to loot that box at the end for a chance to get a cursed weapon.
---
That method won't get you banned. Don't lie
---
Ok, one more time: I'm not saying that pvp is wrong by itself.  I'm saying just stalking low levels because you can is a bit ridiculous.  You saying I should do a private world just so I can fully enjoy the game is ridiculous as well, why should I have to shell out money because people like you can't figure out how to play the game in any beneficial way?
---
Hmm, your level had nothing to do with this. Do you want a medal?
---
Ive seen level 800+ players on pc before. Generally pc players are level 100+
---
Proof:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_rKOuy9R98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_rKOuy9R98) 
---
Crossbow (but essentially rifleman perks, that's what it used before the compound bow was introduced, now bows have their own identical damage perk cards).  900 damage to 300.  2/3 damage nerfed.  If they tripled the base damage it would be a fair nerf/buff.  Same with pistols.  Triple base damage and it's by no means OP or an end game build.
---
yeah it poped up on my screen and ill check the shop
---
But, here's the thing... My character IS a high ranking military officer. Sure, everyone else who finished the story is too, but the members of foundation AREN'T. Even the military team you recruit for the bullion heist is lower ranked. And it's not just hand waved. I filed the damn paperwork, have an overseers certification from VTU, passed basic training, registered with a military organization (BoS), utilized senate clearance to enter the continuity of government bunker and received a VALID military promotion for commendation of Valor through the LEGITIMATE AND OFFICIAL continuity of government authority systems put in place by the government of the United States BEFORE the bombs dropped. That's not to mention the fact that the secret service acknowledged my legitimate rights to administer and establish a new system of currency for the rebuilt nation.
---
I earned the RIGHT to wear official military gear and there should be access to at least as many options as hubris comics cosplay.
---
Exactly. What he wants is to control the way other people play a videogame. And still has the audacity to call those people entitled.
---
With my Minigun around 150 per shot and .50 at about 200+
---
I have a JE Plasma and that does like 300-400 per pellet with scattered mod haha insane dude.
---
I don't know if you saw but right after seeing your comment I got a 1 star junkies minigun, is that a strong enough start to go for a Junkies build?
---
Bruh where were you when i opened them
---
Here's my advice. You can't police other players and it's up to players to decide whether or not to blow you up.
---
Running workshops is actually one of the slowest ways to gain resources and to level up. You can get all the plans from the many shit-tier player vendors that plague the game.
---
Stay away from workshops until you can get in and get out quick enough to avoid another players radar.
---
Extremely. If you have accelerated barrel, put that on it and it instantly becomes magic, not only will it be doing junkies great damage but this stupid thing in the game with some effects will have it doing bonus damage. You will love it i promise
---
bruh I'd make fucking bank
---
It'll be much more extreme the only reason things like this work is because all the damage buff are multiplicative. Say you had a 50%, 100%, and 50% buff. Now it would be 450% [1.5 x 2.0 = 3.0 √ó 1.5 = 4.5. After the buff it'll be [0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 or just at 300% damage. That's a 50% drop but people arent stacking 3 buffs they are stacking many many more. 
---
Bloodied, nerd rage, bloody mess, weapon perks, consumable, adrenal reaction, food buffs, alcohol buffs, sneak attack damage and critical damage. All of those going additive means a lot reduced damage.
---
Awesome, so glad to hear it! I do have accelerated barrel too. I just tested it with only 3 addictions and my only half finished perk build and its already doing more than anything else I've owned. Thanks again! :)
---
You use standard crafted weapons, I knew it!
---
I've heard of people getting banned because of trading bullion weapons.
---
Only by using third party software. The in game way won't lead to a ban
---
A new form of *buzz brain*
---
Glorious!
---
When i started playing iwas level 16 or so when i first did schorscbeast Queen and i got The legendaries and now that on level 71 no one does Queen fights anymore every server i go to Will launch nuke at monongah mine and i Have killed earle 7 Times on The last 3days
---
Nice! Hopefully these tips helped you bud.
---
Thanks!
---
No 22 is pretty good, the low levels are hitting for 1. You are as effective, probably a lot more effective since you are likely not dead all the time, as 22 low level players
---
I need all the pts stuff to be in the game rn. I can't wait.
---
I feel like there's some pretty considerable cognitive bias going on. Just the other week they released the Quack Outfit and the Raider Waster armor/underarmor. Last week had the communist outfit and the Raider Skinner Outfit, which straddles the line a bit but I've seen some people make some badass combos with certain masks. And that's not getting into the ton of power armor skins that have been released recently. Things always get a little wacky around festivals because they're a bit immersion-breaking as a rule, and the Grelok stuff just happened to drop around a fest.
---
I dunno, that‚Äôs a lot of health you are losing out on. Especially for bloodied that matters
---
I can understand you there. It does not make sense for winning the event at all. But I also understand that lots of low-level players are curious about the three-headed wendigo... I guess after a while there won't show up too many low-level players when all have seen what's going on there.
---
I remember spending like 50 dollars on PS home for them to just scrap it. It was really cool being able to have an avatar and hang out with friends in your beach mansion and watch Netflix... but damn it was a huge kick in the face for them to just be uhhh fuck it were done with this.  Remember the butterfly cryptic challenges towards the end?
---
Also completed the run last nite. Glad i got it done.
---
I‚Äôm only tier 56 :( I only started doing all my dailies halfway through the season
---
one shot deathclaw? Buddy I had to huff it like the devil was on my heels!! Mine was a level 53 and Im currently ( On my first and main character) level 25! nope nope nope and I use a crossbow and .44 magnum
---
I feel you man!
---
I have been there a few times now and there never was a deathclaw.
---
Yes, I know this. I got one this time though.
---
Warframe is a shining example of everything 76 should be. The MT's, content, updates, and more are all done fairly, in a consumer friendly way, and with fantastic polish; this is all despite having been a smaller studio when they started.
---
I mean you literally just run out after you kill him... there is no next part.. unless I‚Äôm missing something here
---
I had a 2 star fatman as well.  let off 4 shots. straight to scrip :(
---
Nude
---
It will come.
---
And if they really Listen to what people say they will fix it after they Released the Patch. But no way they will stop now.
---
Umad
---
So I'm able to FT out of the mine? I figured it would assume I'm leaving the event.
---
In vats AA will be better than TS, I think after the damage readjustment the  two shot will do more damage. Instigating will always do more damage than either on the first hit of a undamaged enemy
---
Yes daddy
---
you have them and they still ding you just get nothing. :(
---
This is a bit off topic, but I like these thrones. They give me an excuse to [quote this line from Thief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5FGGUDhDSM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=636).
---
No, actually run out, if you fast travel out you leave the event. You have a set time to GTFO the mine before it collapses
---
[](/kplaguedoctor)Dang, still no fix to plague walker not doing the "You cannot recover from diseases you contract" thing it says it does. I wanna catch-em-all Bethesda! Outside of that tho, these changes are all pretty dope.
---
Based off the weapon damage calculator Two shot does a tiny smidge more damage but that‚Äôs if you can hit both shots. If you miss that severely hampers your damage output. AA is more consistent in that it doesn‚Äôt gain accuracy penalties  so you could hit shots more reliably but the lower your enemies DR the lower the bonus. While TS the only downside is accuracy and the fact that weapon durability goes down faster.
---
I must say, it always gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside to see people waste an excessive amount of caps for nothing at my workshops.
---
I always place quick schematics that drive the cap cost up to 50+ to take over, and place all the necessary stashes and stuff along the border so I can do everything I need to do from outside. When I get that notification my workshop is under attack, followed by a rain of shots that do no damage it always makes me smile. 
---
Better is the death box I put down that means if they fully take the workshop and leave they die when they return to the traps I previously placed down.
---
IF you want high DR, Bolstering makes more sense than Vanguard's since you get more armor the more you get pounded on, instead of less. But, this is really the only sense in which Bolstering is any good at all.
---
If you actually want to be more tanky, having one piece each of Ghoul Slayer's, Mutant Slayer's, Troubleshooter's, Zealot's and either Hunter's or Exterminator's gives you a whole lot more effective damage reduction against most mobs in the game. So do the Sentinel's, Cavalier's and Blocker 3\* effects (15% damage reduction when standing still, sprinting or blocking)
---
In a group, the healing effect from Solar armor is bound to give you more overall survivability than Vanguard's or Bolstering.
---
If you're a low-health build, nothing beats Unyielding.
---
So no, Bolstering is not great at all.
---
I agree. but the entire score sound board level ups everything feels weird to me and has completely killed immersion.
---
What I have noticed is that when the BGS Maryland crew steps in to write a story or fix something it is done right. But when the Texas crew does stuff to maintain the game they screw it up. As I said in the original post I constantly defend and will defend bethesda because I really do love their games and this b.s. of people acting like bethesda is another Electronic Arts is absolutely ridiculous. That being said I feel like the texas crew just doesn‚Äôt think sometimes. Its like hey Wastelanders was super successful and people are loving the game right now, lets put in an ammo converter (a good idea) and half ass the User interface (a bad idea). Obviously this doesn‚Äôt ruin the game for me because it is a lot of fun but I am just confused on how the designer of it was like yeah this is totally the best way to do it. As somebody who is on PC and likes creating mods I completely understand that things are a lot easier said than done. However when you work for a company like BGS you should damn well be good enough to at least design something that people will like and is easy to interface with.
---
The exit is blocked, that's the issue. We're unable to "run out"
---
Oooooooh I see what you did there :) I love it
---
There was a bug where completing or leveling up in adventure (not sure which) awarded perk packs. I can back to like 180 of them in my main. Great for when there's limited time nw rewards and I don't have time to grind
---
Depends what your build is. I'd personally keep the Instigating and Anti-Armor. Two Shot offers nothing on a single shot weapon. Plus the accuracy is horrible with those things. I scrip every Two Shot weapon I get. But that's my 2 cents.
---
No, you actually have to be in a public or private team for that to count.
---
Anti Armor
---
If they would award more for completing them then it'd be a decent idea. This hair of a sliver progress bar gets harder and harder to see the closer I get to finishing though! My eyes hurt!
---
If u want your magazine to be normal just drop the ammo for it on the ground then pick it back up and reload it
---
Nah, they'll just start selling the nuke codes on the atomic shop.
---
Id say go AA
---
Even at 60% health, with fireproof, dense, poison resist legi peek, all on SS it's incredibly easy to get swarmed and stun locked
---
Someone salty downvoted you, have an upvote!
---
Well... that‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve ever heard of this happening. You killed him and the pathway didn‚Äôt open up to run out of the mine? Did the rubble fall so you can‚Äôt jump up the way you came in as well?
---
Too many people suck this game and the devs dicks. The guy is right,  why the fuck can't we sell the plans for anything?? Really? It's bullshit.
---
Totally agree they would be better sorting all the real game breaking problems out first. Especially the weapons that are useless.
---
That's what I just did. I'm not even a sneak character but I snuck around with my shotgun and did it all solo. First time launching a nuke too lol
---
Yeah, but there are certain conditions (of course). Basically, you need to find a random spawn (there is a map of random spawn points), it has to be alone, and has to be (i believe) half your level. You also need some charisma to max out Animal Friend perk. Then walk up to it and see of you get the "tame" option, and if successful you can then "send to camp". It may get killed on the way, and also they appear hostile in your camp although with a "owned by" tag, so sometimes someone will visit, see the creature and kill it. Can take some server hopping to find what you want.
---
Hell no. They weight too much. Go out and grind your  junk to fix weapons
---
Correct. We were able to down ourselves with the drill in the mine and it took us to the start of the area again, but it was blocked off. FT was the only way out.
---
Maybe they should have a kick function so many people vote etc.
---
Best part is i bought it off Grahm for 500 caps lmfao
---
Yep. Just got them yesterday.
---
Seriously, what are the odds?? XD
---
Two shot is cheeks with a single shot weapon, plus it degrades twice as fast. 
---
Go instigating if you're solo, anti armor if you're in a group or fighting a stronger enemy
---
76 is causal game... It even has built-in aimbot...
---
You are just low level and under spec. I've killed that DC with my latest lv 15 toon with melee weapons with no problems at all. The mob was a level 50. Is about being prepared.
---
They might not have been when he went afk
---
I saw in this thread you‚Äôre stuck in Ounce of Prevention. It‚Äôs currently bugged. So the only way you‚Äôre getting through it is a private server via a friend. It‚Äôs dumb and stupid, and it‚Äôll be patched in the next patch... Probably. 
---
I‚Äôd suggest finding an LFG group and asking someone to open a private world for you to do it in.
---
I hit it the day before the double score weekend, I remember people going crazy saying it was impossible to complete and you have to do every single challenge and you‚Äôll still not be able to complete it. I never did any NW challenges and I missed a full week of challenges early on. 
---
Looks like this sub is terrible at math
---
aw man treat em well
---
That‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard of that happening. That‚Äôs so weird. I‚Äôve done it 6 or 7 times with no issues. Wonder what caused it to bug out this run..
---
Born Survivor, it's in agility.
---
Thats a pretty good snag since you're a newer player, sadly you're on PC or I'd have a bunch of junkies stuff i don't ever use i could give to ya, i really do hope you're enjoying that mini though :)
---
&gt; I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs unstable when there‚Äôs too many people in the same instance
---
I'm 95% sure this is the reason. You'll note that 8 is also the limit on the number of people allowed on a private server: it seems to be the largest number of players that Bethesda thinks they can handle at one location and still guarantee acceptable performance.
---
I wish I could swing a higher award for this. We're playing a post apocalyptic game for crying out loud. Give us some worn down bad ass outfits. I second the comment about hair. Beards and actual long hair options.
---
Tattoos that don't need to go on your face or forehead lol. 
---
Not only that, but PLEASE add a body modifier that isn't a freaking triangle. I want my character to look thicker than the milkshake that brought the boys to Kelis' yard.
---
I remember saying that, but mostly because I started 3 weeks in and was behind until double score.
---
Anti armor is better for everything compared to two shot
---
I did it last week. I feel so free of this stupid grind
---
160 here opened 30...
---
Glad my patients was low for opening all..
---
(After reading the comments)
---
I am a high-level gunslinger. I would like to participate in the event with my bloodied fancy single action revolver. Is it okay?
---
Yeah that and the heads display I have like 3 of those plans I put one in my vendor for I this 3500 and someone bought it I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be selling more üòÇ
---
I don't know, Something amazing I guess.
---
Source? I'll wait for the fix instead of buying the eventual atx cosmos outfit if this is true!
---
They shout have made it like the construction site in new vegas. Full of evil claws
---
Change ammo, bring enemies to them, stuff like that.
---
If you wanna be a dick you could always report them lol
---
But the max remains at 15, you can't go beyond that.
---
Im excited to hear that as I got two extras just waiting to gain some value. Plus gotta wait for second meat week to pass? Idk Economics is so not my strong suit, especially when its a fictitious video game x)

Ahhh well thanks for the great advice anyway. I mostly enjoy it cause now I feel like I have a good starting place to look for weapons without feeling like I'm still waiting to do meaningful damage. One last question, are there any further specializations I need for Junkies? Like any perks or w/e that are important for making it even better or just get addicted and done?
---
Totally normal thing to happen when playing a male character.
---
Meg sure ain‚Äôt.
---
Challenge Accepted.
---
Any power armor build will do, with junkies all you need is the addictions. That's one of the benefits against bloodied, you don't need perks
---
Once I hit it, I stopped caring. I log in for the script and leave. Don‚Äôt care about meat week no long in and afk from time to time in the hour. Don‚Äôt really care about colossal problem either since the rewards are junk, just legendary weaponry which I already have too many legendary junk to even have my build on because of the massive weight issues. Oh fallout, thank you for burning me out worse than gta 5 grind. Didn‚Äôt think that was possible and that‚Äôs for making get close to the pointless level of 300+ which I already said if you get to that level, it‚Äôs time to get a life lol
---
Thousands for sure. These are event drops after all. Hopefully not many dupers will be able to saturate the pool with since it feels like that's what happened to fasnacht
---
Dude, I have three of each mod plan, about six complete Chally outfits, craploads of everything else and I would trade all of it for ONE Tenderizer Plan.
---
You dont even have to side with Foundation to get the suit, as you only have to do the side quests leading up to the decision of which faction to take on the final quest.  
---
You get the suit regardless of whom you side with, Foundation or Crater, if you do it right and do both sides of the quests...to say it another way. 
---
Trying not to spoil.
---
Honestly if you're undecided I'd wait. Pretty sure when the BoS update hits they'll be a lot of BoS items (a vertibird power armor got leaked)
---
It is so weird I was doing all the challeges everyday since I can't remembee how long.
---
Perfect, that's just what I wanted to hear lol. Thanks again, your explanations have been very helpful, and very good timing with the Junkies recommendation too lol
---
Less of a sponge than the SBQ at least
---
Except you will.....
---
you will....
---
I'll gladly be the next rube. Thanks for doing this!
---
If you're desperate, you could buy levels. I think the board gives 1500 total atoms, which is 10 levels. Get as far as you can and on the last day you could always purchase the rest
---
Mark my words, the ATOM rewards for dailies are never coming back.
---
Gotta sell atoms somehow....
---
I‚Äôve finished the event with my Level 200 character as well as my Level 20, if you can manage to stay alive and at least make a dent in the spawn mob or play medic to some of the others so they don‚Äôt have to respawn it should be fine. Every time I‚Äôve completed the event there have been low levels and it hasn‚Äôt stopped us from completion. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i just came back to the game and havent sided with ether faction and got the fashionable raider outfit i didnt do any quest with any of the sides
---
Bro what are you, 12? Why do you even remotely care if somebody is AFKing an event? Get over it. In fact, reading this just reminded me that I forgot the AFK Meat Week tonight, going to go fix that now.
---
It was a little frustrating, for sure. Hopefully this isn't a recurring issue.
---
It sounds like an adorable minecraft Ghast and I love it.
---
Game companies have been eyeing the profits mobile games, and want their games to print money like they do, they don't care if it makes the game worse.
---
Tbh they may even thrive considering a gold based currency and with the Brotherhood (under Roger Maxson) coming in soon. The only major issue would be bad blood between the Crater and Foundation but ultimately there‚Äôs no reason they won‚Äôt thrive in the toxic valley and the forest unless some major crisis happens in the time between the games.
---
The plans yes, but not the rep. I want to RP a good and evil character. I want to have negative rep and be attacked or chased away by a faction if my rep with them is low enough. I want the raiders to send death squads to my BoS character like the legion did in FNV.
---
Losing ~5% total damage hurts my bloodied spirit. That being said great tip! 
---
I‚Äôm very used to playing bloodied so other tips including always be walking sideways while shooting at Earle so his projectiles will not hit you; while reloading quit vats to quickly regenerate a little AP; always sprint away from dangerous situations (don‚Äôt sneak walk) like being swarmed by wendigos, falling debris etc, etc; hot key stimpaks, they negate damage temporarily.
---
Unless she gets as lucky as Luo
---
Were you solo or in a team? I noticed the game always likes to pair you with teammates so I wonder if it saves slots automatically for other peoples teammates pushing soloor slow people into the next one
---
oh noes. the hard endgame type boss might be actually hard
---
Yeah, mine is laggy as well. Think too much crap slows it down. I need to clean out all the plans. they dont sell that well
---
That's not a nerf, it's damage multiplier change.
---
Perhaps, but to dish out some serious dps I'd get the commando perks. You could hold your own but you'd rely heavily on your team, especially if you don't have an AA rifle.
---
As far as actual numbers go, he's even more of a sponge - more damage reduction, more DR/ER, same HP. It's just that the SBQ flies around a lot and thus keeps out of weapon range, which drastically reduces the damage you do to her while she's in the air.
---
In pvp and in boss fights its not negligible. Melee will be worthless, and bosses will be even more bullet spongey, and in high tier pvp, some people will be unkillable because of aid item spam (quantums, stims, etc). Right now it's hard to kill an aid pvp build, but after the nerf it will be impossible unless they nerf aid items, which will piss pve people off.
---
How do you get this one?
---
this is exactly what I'm doing!
---
Either way he‚Äôs died much faster than the SBQ excluding glitched guns or those ‚Äúmelt in half a second‚Äù builds
---
I know right. It might take a standered team more than 5-10 minutes to kill him
---
I got a bloodied 40 power attack reduced weight cursed pickaxe but wasn't sure to keep it or scrip it. Do they have other effects?
---
People don't even have to use the search function. There's similar posts usually on the front page without having to scroll down. Like i get it. Your jimmies are rustled but do we need another post about the exact same thing?
---
I was with a full team
---
Could we have one of them killers instead of the Mystery man? That could actually be a little more right in the timeline as well...
---
The only thing that would have made this better is if you shot him as soon as he turned around.
---
No. All the cursed weapons are static legendary effects. They have a hidden attack speed and damage buff, but idk. Keep it, scrip it, display it, that‚Äôs up to you
---
Im pretty prepared being able to take on most of this game on my own. Im crafty and play smart lol Wasnt insulting or starting anything. Apologize if it read that way. however understand and read other comments haha I'm not the only "low level" ( You just admitted to being lvl 15 think about that) to visit that island and have some problems. :) and those things when they jump outta nowhere are scary lol Jumpscare worthy.
---
Thsts rubbish, should automatically save a spot for 2 teams then auto fill after 2 mins
---
Prefer the 40 scrip then XD
---
I was thinking of using a Handmade with a hardened receiver so I don't have to spend a lot of time getting the Commando perk cards. I was planning on mostly going for the regular Wendigo's.
---
Great post, I can't agree more. I use their site every week when the codes change. 
---
Well done you fine people!
---
O.O ..... Im having flashbacks and sweating....
---
I did rather enjoy outer worlds. Solid 8/10. Just wish it had more to do as i was done in a  very short amount of time. And it needed a proper antagonist
---
Pretty much essential since Nerd Rage is a vital perk for damage.
---
this, its low level location. Hoping One Appalachia bring good level scaling and put lvl 110 deathclaw in it.
---
Finished it today and ‚Ä¶ just ‚Ä¶ the freedom of having all that WEIGHT off of my back.
---
Good lord.
---
as long as they add a min level =0
---
Hiding on one of the belts slowly sniping away at them, hearing the mines go off as they slowly try to reach you. Once you get in, it's hard to get out.
---
Nope. No blackpowder or ballistic heavys ever dropped as quad
---
I‚Äôm sitting at max scrip waiting for the purveyor sell... but that also means my stash is capped with legendary crap lol
---
I died a few times from lag because someone was using a Tesla and making the whole event a slide show. It made it really easy for the mini earls to get the drop on me before I even saw them
---
Bit of advice. In the centre area there‚Äôs a pipe sticking out of a machine on near one of the stairs up. The colossus can still hit you, but it should focus on others, however wendigos can‚Äôt. The main issue is making sure the colossus stays in sight.
---
Id atleast throw it all in shops for 1 cap. You would be supprised mate. Iv got shotgun shells off for 2 caps.
---
TS does a tad bit more damage but that‚Äôs if you hit both shots since TS make accuracy horrible. AA is more consistent and easier on durability.
---
lol he says he can only keep one and you give him reasons to keep all of them, nice
---
Honestly I would never nuke without them. They truly save the endgame.
---
Pretty sure it's only something to display
---
Exactly! It‚Äôs always during special events and updates this subreddit will be lively with bug report post and suggestion posts. It‚Äôs been entertaining.
---
That's just because he doesn't (usually) fly around the map completely ignoring the fight for more than half the time.
---
Earle's average lifespan is comparable to that of the Queen when she could still be crippled.
---
The only other thing I get that doesn't auto scrap that I haven't found a recipe for is Mole Rat Teeth.
---
If the other 7 players are solid you'll be fine. Just kill the wendigos and try to keep them off of other players, that's what I do. I ran it first as a rifleman, even with anti armor the normal wendigos took 3-4 shots to kill. You can't really get your stealth to work either, I was detected most of the time. I'd stick with your rifle though, the handmade without perks is just gonna burn through ammo.
---
No more silly emotes pls! 
---
A TEXTCHAT is what we need...
---
There's a drink on the PTS right now called "Liquid Courage" that makes you immune to "Fear" effects which you craft using the Vocal Sac.
---
Forget atoms ‚Äî I just want more earnable lunchboxes
---
I managed to display the cursed shovel without issue - but that's about it
---
Yesss I remember in New Vegas I went in to go kill the mother death claw once I had done as much as I could to fully gear up even the glitch to have all the companions. That was the best fight I had.
---
Alright thanks, do you know how I could get my hands on an AA Lever? I have 5-6k caps right now and I'm on PC.
---
Bog Wanderer Outfit if you have FO1st
---
Eh, not a super fan of free loaders either but...I do offer my friends to afk the event if they are too low level/non optomized to contribute much in way of DPS-esp useful if they are on public team and can share useful perks at least. But, I NEVER head into that Event unless I am sure we can beat him (at least two high dps players, one of which is junkie or bloodied, plus two average players). If you go in there uncoordinated, it's like gambling, and we all know how that can turn out.
---
Instead of complaining about other people--who you cannot realistically change or control-- try to go in more prepared, so then you won't give a rat's ass if someone's freeloading bc you're getting what you need out of the event. And who knows, that player afk'ing could be the alt of a player that's dealing the most damage to Earle and carrying you!
---
I still think to this day: Wasteland and Fallout share the same universe, oh sure I'm aware Wasteland is a different time period (Its 'Great War' takes place in 1998 while Fallout's takes place in 2077) but somewhere along that it could be intertwined.
---
I personally can't wait for Wasteland 3 on Thursday night (11 PM CST if it's like every other game) since i have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. I've always liked the Desert Rangers, one of my favorite factions from a Post Apocalyptic series.
---
Oooooh, TY!  What else goes in it?  So I can stock up!
---
Mole Rat Teeth are used to craft Mole Miner Gauntlets.
---
For a full health build I run 5 unyielding most of the time, switch to a 3 uny and 2 bolst when doing tougher events.
---
I did the same. But it was when it just came out. I died alone. And failed miserably.
---
Also you shouldn't apologise, it's your event, your card. You provided everyone a fun event. If some else triggered the event and you go to the terminal and started it, now that would be a reason to apologise.
---
Dont use it.
---
No need to apologize. I may hav sounded rude, so I'm sorry too. I reckon that since on my first playtrhoughs i may have not visited that area until i was high level, it was never supossed to be a challenge. Is an island on the forest, so is supossed to be friendly for low levels. 
---
I remember last time that i tried specifically to go for it with my lv 15. At that level i an use a specially preparred raider power armor with tesla coils, a nice 3* instigating baseball bat and some chems ready to test myself. Maybe i know the game by my current level. 
---
I tried the deathclaw at the power station north of watoga with that same toon and had my ass handed so I learned the limits of a lv 15 toon there lol
---
Oooooh, I always have those, I spawn on top of mole miners so I never need to craft a gauntlet.  TY!
---
Nah, I feel like it delivers what it promises. 
---
But the Cranberry Bog should get a ‚ÄúHuge Glowing Deathclaw Island‚Äù that should have a legendary Huge Glowing Deathclaw.
---
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link it, but there's a subreddit that has the name market and 76. You'll be able to get a 1 star pretty cheaply from there if someone wants to sell one. Just make sure you format the title properly!
---
Yes definitely I have a level 21 deathclaw  as a pet  it's terrible you have to shoot them they are on their own island just chilling you should at least have the option to tame them üòè
---
I'm not sure exactly. I don't have access to the PTS myself.
---
The other ingredients shouldn't be too uncommon. The Sac is the key ingredient.
---
Did it work for you to clear the ghost spot
---
The freedom is divine.
---
The big thing is that I felt so bad because so many people showed up! And then I couldn‚Äôt even help that well with completing the event other than dying a few times to keep the conduits running. Just a waste of ammo and resources. But I am very grateful so many people did show up to attempt to help us. I guess the event doesn‚Äôt go up often?
---
Thank you.  I'll see what I can dig up.  üíú
---
5. Dmg nerf is ruining my experience
---
Really?? Dang! I already scrapped 2 of them
---
Whoops, I read that wrong, I read that as asking which two to keep.  Still though, I would do some inventory management because both are great perks. I'm pretty sure there's at least 20 pounds of stuff you don't need.
---
Got that bad for me was using legendaries to sell for caps at vendors, I might of missed out on the tenderiser but got a lot of scrip and modules out of meat week
---
Oh yeah I've seen that subreddit before, I know which one you're talking about. I just got really intimidated by all the really expensive 3* guns and never looked on it again lol. I'll put up a post there, thanks for the suggestion and the help!
---
We had him get stuck in the ceiling but you could still shoot his feet. Was very helpful. Although I got a one star axe so that was painful.
---
if you put 2 of them together in a display case they look like balls
---
Are you making sure to talk to the raider who's running away and tell them you're attacking them? After killing them, then you can tell Roxy "Appalachia has a new corpse" while backing out of the convo quickly afterwards. Then just tell her again and again
---
If your planning on farming screws there, you might wanna pickup up the glow sight perk
---
It helps against glowing enemies, so you can be more effective against the spawns
---
You would be better off with this event if you get more tanks build, bloodied die quick here, and I haven't heard of successful stealthing here, but with my experience you don't lose your junk when you die during the event, so you do you
---
You could also run around with an auto Tesla rifle tagging them and looting while others do the heavy lifting
---
I just sell the 1 stars to grahm when I finish the event, if it‚Äôs not 3* or a good roll 2* I normally don‚Äôt pick them up.. just how I‚Äôve trained myself
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ or a booty!  My husband displayed 2 under the cursed shovel.
---
To be honest most my deaths are due to tunnel vision and not paying attention to the glowing effects above me until I get fried
---
Oh nice to know. Ill be hanging onto the 3 I have then. I was going to chuck them in my vendor for people who like to make "testicle" displays.
---
Tbf it's in a low level area and if you go there when you're a newbie exploring and a fricken deathclaw drags it's way out of the dirt and starts chasing you it is legit terrifying.
---
Befote restarting to play Fo76. I detele my old 72 level from the B.E.T.A beacause he was unperfect.
---
For level up this was very hard to level up without joining events with high levels players.
---
But without theses events , you can't play to this game and say it "fun" , you play against high level enemies but you don't need to use all of your ammo for 0xp
---
It wouldn't be a problem if that "engame type boss" dropped actual "endgame type reward". Yet his drop is similar to any generic 3-star enemy in the game.
---
Good practice to be honest 5 scrip is nice but the extra 10 or 20 weight can be killer
---
Word, the lizard almost ripped me apart at lvl 9. The intended fun was had.
---
Other way around
---
I finnish Wastelenders at 30/40
---
I come just to deal pain to that bloody assaultron and its iron man laser of doom
---
A week down the road, and you are absolutely correct.
---
Robe from fallout 1,2 would be great.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Robes](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Robes)
---
It has such! Check power substation north of Watoga - reliable spawn for Glowing Deathclaw lvl 91.
---
I like and hate the update
---
Ha, I had the exact same experience. I approached like it was the deadliest place in the world, sneaking, very cautious, sticking to the shore line.... 
---
I'm not saying it was anticlimatic but sometimes I go there and just punch the Deathclaw in the face with my bare hands for something to do.
---
Damn!  That's harsh!
---
Not only should you (and your team) be guaranteed to be in the 1st instance, I think you should be given the ability to select the other 4 people/team!
---
That sounds interesting, but I no longer play on xbox and would likely have time conflicts anyway; but I am interested in seeing it. Are you going to stream or upload to twitch or YouTube?
---
On the pts, apparently anyone with one of these in their camp gets the error: could not place camp, an invalid object was detected in your camp (or something like that) and they have to completely rebuild, so hopefully this will be fixed soon!
---
I always head to Hopewell Cave instead.
---
I duo it in stealth with a buddy, both stealth commandos and only ever die to fear/fire
---
When a male Fallout character reaches a certain age. They begin to go through changes...
---
I liked this part about the raiders a lot because it amazed those who, like me, wanted to side with foundation and destroy the Raiders when in reality they are not as bad as the former Apalachian gangs. Meg has however saved her people from scorched and although she does not want them to be remembered as the leader of die-to-hard she has still maintained the "peaceful" nature and not a brutal system like that of the Blood Eagles, which can be seen from fact that Meg does not want to attack Foundation. Another aspect is that even "common" merchants affiliated with foundation only are not kicked out and as far as deserters are concerned, Rocksy still allows them not to be killed but only to be "fixed".
---
I roll my eyes at most complaints on this sub. But you‚Äôre right that is total bullshit. Not getting to participate in an event you went through the trouble of starting is just wrong.
---
You still get the the 10% damage increase for the addiction even while under the influence
---
I was far behind until zorbo hit 70-75 something like that
---
I started around 1,5months ago,people were probably around 30-50 back then
---
I believe i missed a couple days of dailies,but i'm at 97 atm and gonna finish the run in the next 3 days or so,and havent bought a single level.
---
My opinion? It' was actually pretty fun to around 50,then i was like
---
Damn,this thing got too grindy 
---
And im completely burned out since 85
---
My opinion on the whole legendary run?
---
If they want to keep it this way,i think it should last way longer,maybe like half a year? 
---
If not,just make the level up bar stop at 2000 or something
---
OR,make it like every weekend/second weekend has double score for all challenges,so people can actually participate while having a life besides 76
---
Especially around workshops... I literally got told I'd been reported for harassment TWICE from two different people yesterday for claiming my 10 Workshops. Come on workshops are not safe spaces xD
---
Exactly why, sure there are sometimes where I may not get every single 150 scrip, but that‚Äôs fine with me, leaving 1 or 2 behind doesn‚Äôt bother me
---
Well I would thank you for starting it. Yes haven't seen it in a while, could just be my luck. Sounds like you did well, seen many complaints that no one wants to be the conduits.
---
I was expecting something like the little nook full of deathclaws or the quarry in new Vegas, or deathclaw sanctuary in 3. Definitely a disappointment
---
Thx man.
---
It's my view from my camp porch. He is too easy. Even my new toon 1 shots him. And Deathclaw island sounds scary/bad ass
---
Lol when we saw that thing we burst out laughing. Looks fucking ridiculous! And just eh fucking ‚Äúbaa‚Äù makes it all better. Loved the side quest that lead up to it too. Very interesting.
---
They are definitely a unique faction in their own right. From what I have gathered, the Crater is a kind of Raider Republic. Although not a republic in the formal sense of the word, they're definitely not the NCR, they do seem to operate under their own informal Code of Conduct, similar to the 18th century Pirate Republic of Nassau.
---
Why should it be a guaranteed endgame type reward though. Like. Honestly I think a lot of people in this forum have never played another vidya game. Once again I am using WoW as an example. You could spend 20 minutes doing a Mythic dungeon that is ludicrously hard and get nothing. Or 3-4 hours doing a raid and maybe get something that is not for your class which you can either hoard or give to someone else. And these things are a lot lot harder than a colossal problem or scorched earth.
---
Yes.
---
One I would love is to see a quest line that has a Hubologists VS Mothman Cult war. I know the Hubologists don't send any missionaries for about 100 years but it would be interesting to see two cults just duke it out.
---

---
You're a week late, buddy.
---
who cares, META shifting to other builds are good thing. I can guarantee there would be similar OP build in the future after nerfs.
---
They are pretty much scavengers under the guise of raiders, all bark and no bite. Still better than foundation though. ü§ô
---
Gotta wait until that‚Äôs fixed hopefully soon. Then the overseers quest opens up the settler and raider quests.
---
Nice nice, crazy to see how fast people data mine this game.
---
You play on Xbox? Lol think I might been on the same server
---
I had the same thing happen twice in a row, fortunately the colossus got stuck into a spot right next to the central machinery so it didn't move and it's spit got stuck into the mesh. Got a two shot explosive gating of it.
---
You get the same haha yeah Xbox
---
I‚Äôd consider it. Mainly depends on if this even gets traction. I‚Äôve only got one other dude right now
---
The original karma larma, oh I see you like to sneak around and shoot my buddies from the shadows, have that! Melts 3 bloodied guys in a second lol
---
If you determine another instance ended earlier, you can actually try to get those people onto your team and they can fast travel into your instance.
---
Rofl.. yeah I logged in to grind out some Ghram and cracked up. "Woah.. someone claimed all the workshops in the forest" .. nice one bruv lol
---
Exit game and reload?
---
Worst case scenario I will be abandoning my level 200 ish character and working on a new build until things stabilise.  And I do think they will continue to work on it rather than just nerf everything and leave it at that.
---
My advice would be to only launch while in a 4 player group (and ask if they are interested in ACP) as groups are guaranteed to be in the same instance, also the discord for 76 market has a pretty active player base in lfg for Xbox and hopefully other platforms, you could try to round up at least 3 other confined players to help.
---
For my first runs I used a privet server to make sure we had a full team of 8, though we ended up with only 7 (one of whom was only lv 60 and new to endgame content) and it went great.
---
Today I saw the nuke drop in a public server and quick joined a team of 3 but only one player came and then quit? shortly after starting it. I prior had a successful 4 player run and the random had a nice 400+ level and seemed interested in trying it as a two man team. Bearly into the fight they quit or crashed and I was on my own. But I did manage to solo the event with a magic Junkie's FFR Ultracite Gatling Laser (because regular fusion cores are one of my easiest to farm ammo) with 2 minutes left on the timer. Only killed a few Wendigo spawn and mainly ran from spot to spot where the adds couldnt hit me, which if your a non-melee build with good damage, I deffinatly recommend trying as a strat if you ever do get stuck running it solo.
---
Tried, my group kept spawning in the instance with the other randoms
---
Not with that stupid cooldown timer and people being lazy ;)
---
Just hold circle.
---
I went at the same time my team went. They even tried fast traveling to me and it only let them join the instance they was in before. Leaving me completely alone
---
Likewise, why can't you understand others play the way they want?
---
If it makes total sense then it is doomed from the start. When have Bethesda done something that makes total sense?
---
I think Meg and her crew just embraced being called Raiders because that's what people, especially their victims, called them.
---
Or just make the pistol related perk cars buff their damage more. that way pistols wont be the only thing you need at the beginning of the game but it will reward you for specking into them
---
Oh yes. This. Something that is still under testing and not even released yet.
---
Melee, especially unarmed and more recently one-handed, has a known issue. Their numbers end up being too low even when you factor in the damage changes. Something else is going on.
---
The one thing I find surprising is that people keep making out like this is the be all end all to combat balance. It's just the beginning. Even Bethesda made that clear. So with shit that needs attention - certainly bosses, certain weapons etc. that should come with time.
---
Hopefully. You never know with Bethesda.
---
Some people  want a lot yes but some people but you can gold there. I found a be +1p railway for dogfood.
---
It's a piece of armour you're wearing that has a certain effect. Wearing that whilst using a gun that shoots multiple projectiles makes that gun magic. It's the reason I'm not wearing a full set of ss armour cause I only have that effect on one piece of unyeilding that's not ss. Makes my 2 shot fixer kick ass though üòà
---
The tweaked is better,it has the same damage as powerful plus added critical shot damage.
---
yeah, it sounds like a grumpy  whoopee cushion...
---
In my mind, it's far more important to be able to take down the enemies quickly than to have more health to soak up damage.
---
Each to their own. There's no right or wrong, just what works for you and what doesn't.
---
Its hard for non colour blind people too see as well. Just a swirl of green plasma in front of me, not sure how successful I am by sight. Just looking for hit markers and numbers to gauge where to aim. I play as bloodied tank melee most of the time but earl hits hard.
---
"one with a baseball bat" lololol this gave me such a funny mental image of this guy dinking the boss
---
Yeah deff. Everyone‚Äôs gonna have their own build and differences
---
The new expansion is also soon to come out,  claiming another 15-20h at least,  making it nearl double the playtime whup
---
Tab ,space arrow keys are all you need(pc). While not perfect it takes me under a minute to get 1000 50cal or 5mm out of all my unwanted ammo every day.

I usually have 10k .50cal and 3k UC .50cal ammo stocked und my vendor aswell as 8k 5mm and other stuff like shielded raider underarmor and the odd legendary here and there. Im an ammo vendor since Player vending became a thing :) add me to your friendslist if you want.
---
Ign: Dampfwalze.
---
Oh okay many thank. Didn‚Äôt wanna put one on then have to go change it
---
*rumble rumble rumble*. Ah fuck, what‚Äôve I done now?
---
I think it would be cool if teams could pair up to form an 8 player event team. No extra buffs and functionally 2 separate teams, just guaranteed shared instances for ACP and future events if Bethesda has more with this format later on.
---
its such a relief to finally have freedom from that crappy grind, i still will log in daily for treasury note hand in but overall im happy to be free of that crappy score board.
---
I‚Äôve drowned my fair share of spinners.  Death to ‚Äòem all I say!  If you want free loot sit on a spit or bang a dang drum.
---
There are some high level console players as well, I am only 320. Last week there was a guy at 1050.
---
TF is Grelok?
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs a good defense appearing that hostile.
---
That annoys me as well.
---
Regardless of level, if you join an event, come  prepared and contribute. Kill minions, draw some heat off me to get in position and reload etc.
---
Just do something, and not just watch me spending last weeks ammo crafting grind.
---
That absolutely sucks. Ill be dropping a nuke for the event on Xbox (if you're on xbox) in a couple hours so will happily have you in my world ready and waiting to jump into the event... Just hope I get in myself!
---
Edit: Saw your other comment about bring in a group prior and didn't know it wasn't guarenteed. I hope Bethesda can get a solution for that, but I hope my tip about a privet server can help for now.
---
Split the difference. 150
---
Same!
---
I used it once to try it, use it as part of a junk wall for one of my characters. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No, the only time that works is with the different pc launchers
---
It used to have multiple spawn a year ago. Now its just that one Deathclaw.
---
Id shoot for 50 just so you can start getting level 50 (max) legendarys out of that event. Youll be fine. Just do what you can and let the other guys carry you. Also, a great spot for screws is the bog town workshop. There is one floor of the tall building filled with typewriter, fans, and globes.
---
I am excited to see Obsidian do well. I would agree that it did feel a little disappointing in scale, but was hardly lacking in some things many of the fans of classic Fallout have been missing. I am very much looking forward to seeing what Obsidian can do with Microsoft level support in Avowed.
---
Free xp i guess
---
It was Bethesda's decision to Frankenstein a network code layer into a single player game instead of starting from a clean codebase with a sane separation of responsibilities, which is why we have dupes and exploits. It is the individual player's decision on what they do, or don't do, once a specific exploit becomes known.
---
It was Bethesda's decision to implement only player-to-player trading, and only for item-for-caps transactions, without accounting for item-for-item transactions. It was their decision to implement a limit on every currency in the game and combine it with a pure RNG grinding mechanic that made sure that there are lots of items in the game that are worth more than max. caps due to how rare and desirable they are. Which is what killed caps as a currency. It is the individual player's decision whether they buy a duped legacy on ebay or from another out-of-game marketplace (the only kind because there is no in-game marketplace, again Bethesda's decision) for ammo, flux, or the soul of their first-born child.
---
It is Bethesda's decision to prioritize Atom shop bugfixes and new content over bugfixes to long-standing major issues. It is the individual player's decision of whether or not they care enough about this to think about how buying Atoms for money further incentivizes those priorities. 
---
The 76 battle pass sucks, like all battle passes, because it is based on FOMO. It also sucks specifically because the autocompletion bug and surprise bonus events introduced a level of uncertainty and unpredictability that increased the FOMO further and made it impossible to actually make sane decisions about the level of effort needed to attain desired rewards.
---
So no. Bethesda is fully to blame for the state of the game, because they are the ones who made the decisions that caused it. Although I would certainly also encourage each player to think about their own (mostly minor) contributions to all this.
---
I hope what happened to me hasn't happened to you. Infinite load screens.
---
I too was expecting Quarry Junction. Instead I just got disappointed, and never needed to go back.
---
I didn't know it was part of a challenge, I used to have my base right beside the island, I'd shoot it once, lure it over, then let my turrets do the rest
---
Pretty much what I had to do with one of my characters for the event, and having an some sort of auto-stim is a must too!
---
I‚Äôm on Ps4, thanks for the invite though. I really appreciate it
---
Yah! I would agree ... Had one 39 and another 61. Both hiding in the corners. I just left ... Too much ammo ...
---
What do you mean? I was able to join colossal problem without any problems tho.. It's just the atom shop üò•
---
Yes, there are several axes 4 if you include a picaxe
---
NOICE. I may have to install it again.
---
Done it lotsa times. I'll just try later i guess.
---
That sounds about right.
---
Write that up in a ticket and submit it to Beth. It's their fault that a bug that bad is in their game. I'm sure others have fallen prey to it.
---
Just make sure you emphasize someone sent you an invitation. Do you remember the player's GT?
---
One of my big gripes with most places in Fallout. I hope to see Foundation and other further locations look more like Shady Sands or even better Vault City and not Megaton or even some places in NV where people would likely have cleaned.
---
I pushed someone AFKing all the way from the church steeple during Fastnach all the way out of the event area, excepted them to notice but they were like that for the good part of an afternoon. üòÖ
---
Many thanks.  I will be getting this now.  I had this happen before and the bundle came out for the contemporary set.  
---
It would be nice to have the choice of either the set or so for items.  Not to be misled.  I don't know who runs the shops pricing.  But they certainly don't know basic consumer laws.  
---
This was back when they released an item with a sale already when the item hadnt even been released full price.  Crazy to think the store is run by individuals that didn't know this.   Anyways, no point in moaning about it now as they sorted it out.
---
I can load the Atom Shop and but on to a server. ü§¶
---
Please kill as many minions as you can. Extra points if you keep an eye out on those closing on me, stuffing up a good line of sight and clip unloading spree.
---
Stimpak diffusers are also welcome.
---
The ability to draw aggro would be terrific, so i can get a good line again, but generally as the heavy primary damage dealer I know that;s a tough ask.
---
Was it on like the third day of the event? Because that totally happened to me exactly as you described!
---
I wouldn't worry about it.  Each vocal sac weighs 5lbs, which is nuts.  I'd rather have the stash space.
---
I mean they all come with 90% weight reduction. If you wanna display a harpoon gun, shovel or pickaxe you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find better ones for that.
---
This is what I could sell:
---
* Backpack plan: 1500
---
* Meat cleaver plan: 500
---
* Meat flag: 500
---
* Tenderizer mod plans: 500
---
* Tenderizer plan: 9000
---
* Chally outfit: 250
---
Do they? I haven‚Äôt even noticed honestly. Got the pick and the harpoon, but not whatever the other/s are
---
ipresentinterval is the variable to toggle in your INI for uncapped FPS.
---
Also first choose the Ultra/High/Med preset before tweaking resolution, details etc. as this changes some settings you can't alter in the menu. With a 1660 super and an ancient i7-3770k I can squeeze a playable 4k experience from the game.
---
could add a feature where we can reinforce lower tier weapons like pipe guns, pistols, laser rifles etc with a "black titanium alloy/frame" which increases the damage by 15% and max range slightly and lowers hipfire and recoil by about 20% allowing the lesser used weapons and builds to compete alittle more with other stuff
---
maybe they even will give us CLEAN underwear...
---
THIS üòÇ
---
I want to upvote this a thousand times lol
---
Saw someone doing this today on my way out, I was like, ‚ÄúFly you fool(s)!‚Äù Pretty sure he died before looting because he was real angry outside afterwards. üòÖ
---
Y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs in the Forest. It‚Äôs literally made to be a low level area. That‚Äôs like going to route 1 in a Pokemon game and complaining about only finding low levels.
---
The fact that Deathclaws as a whole in the game are a bit disappointing is a different discussion, but that particular one is made to be an early-game challenge
---
That's the power of branding.
---
[Meg's Crew in a Nutshell](https://youtu.be/3YFeE1eDlD0)
---
Its a secret cloning facility.
---
Bethesda will eventually have an event where the clones break out and we have horribly deformed and mutated death claws roaming the green zone.
---
New players will be informed that they best stay in the vault.
---
You can definitely handle the event with your level and build, as a rifleman make sure you are extra wary of the environmental hazards and spawn mobs though! They‚Äôll catch you off guard!
---
Anti armor all the way
---
Kinda lines up with the story the new NPC tells about people being intentionally trapped in the mine.
---
Saw him getting sucked into the ceiling today, luckily we killed him before his legs disappeared. üòÖ
---
Why aren't Bethesda responding to this, or at least have a sticky?  It's such a game breaking bug.  Well, a bug that completely negates the new legendary run.  They have had weeks to fix it.  
---
All they have said is that they are working on it.  Then they have done a fix and some dev excuse of edge cases. I've finished the run so I'm ok.  But it's not right for the countless people posting here daily and being on the end of it.  Its disheartening and unacceptable that they haven't fixed it. 
---
If it's hard to fix at least make dev blog post explaining it.  R6 devs do this and then the armchair developers in the community soon pipe down.  I'm sorry you have had this bug.  At you level now you should be able to do it still.  My advice is to log out before reset and log in 15 mins after.  The fact that people have spent atoms as a result of bug is downright immoral.
---
All dungeon and raid bosses in WoW had thier own unique loot pools. Also there was a spiciefic loot table of items which can be dropped from any boss in that specific dungeon or raid. At least that how it was when I was playing it during Vanilla-BC-WOTLK era.
---
Right now getting 2-star armor or 1-star pipe gun from Earl or SBQ is basically the same as getting nothing. I don't even bother picking this items up anymore.
---
If you want to campare F76 to WoW... Imagine if all bosses in WoW dropped just random blue items that you usually get from rare mobs (silver dragon frame) in the world. That would be fun, right? Do you think people would care about raiding with such rewards?
---
Buttom line current rewards from bosses in F76 sucks ass.
---
If I was Bethesda I would make it all different. They already have good idea with those cursed weapons but almost all of them kinda useless... All items Earl drop should have that effect on them. Also I would add a plan (not tradeable) to Earl loot table which can be dropped with 5% chance. This plan gives you ability to Curse your existing weapons. Plan requirment could be something like 10x Earl's balls, 10x of each flux, 300 black titanium.
---
Perk loadouts will be a thing soonish. Also there's a cooming legenday perk for auto hacking and lock picking.
---
I saw the event for the first time, finished selling at the vendor I was at, fast travelled to CAMP to repair a couple things and pick up my heavy weapon, went back onto the map and the event had finished.
---
Yeah, is this about consoles? Im PC and Alt-f4 works for me.
---
I have the same problem. A razor works wonders. Just think of it as being more immersive. Eat, drink, sleep, and shave.
---
I'm tryna get on Fallout but PS is being an asshole and there's a padlock next to my games, I just wanna finish off my scrappy lakehouse
---
Are you sure he was dead and not just ragdolled? I had this experience last night where Earle fell over and just Ragdolled around like crazy, after getting blown halfway around the cavern by a 40mm auto grenade launcher, his body landed near where he spawns in and i sat there pegging him in the head, damage numbers showing and everything until he died and we got the prompt to leg it. Funny thing was, at the same time, I saw teammates getting feared, so I have to think it was some kind of client desync issue, though I know several other teammates saw the same thing I did.
---
Yup, wasn't planning on going in before I have my build finished anyways. Thanks for the tip on the screw farming location, I'll definitely check it out as I need as many screws as I can get right now.
---
I love the ideas of robes but I usually don't like the headwear they make
---
LMFAO big agree
---
Im glad im on pc and we already got perk loadout manager
---
New costume in atomic shop, some comic villian
---
And for those it does apply aa to it doesn't work properly. It only applies to the base weapon damage
---
maybe something better than a cuddly toy eh, game is rated 18+ be cool if rewards matched that
---
Thanks for pointing out the obvious. Ironic, yes?
---
He was definitely dead. His head(s) were detached from his body.
---
Fair, I was more talking about Elianora makes for example
---
its mind boggling that they added min. levels to the quests and certain areas but not to events, especially an end game boss
---
I vouch for transmogs in fallout lol
---
Seconded. Can we have something in 76 that brings us to Nuka World ages before those raiders set up shop
---
Hear, hear!
---
If there was ever a fix that needed to happen this needs to happen now. This is beyond unacceptable. There are already too many useless perks to have this one be completely overlooked for it‚Äôs potential. This is beyond absurd that I couldn‚Äôt even believe the numbers I was seeing
---
He could not have been more dead, basically.
---
Nooooo. It's almost the top of the hour!
---
This, very much. Also, don't try to join a public team and port to a team member whos already there. Chances are the system bugs out and fucks you off 20 miles east or w/e.
---
To be fair, the early math didn't account for the extra bonuses we received this season. The double points and extra challenges were a huge help. I have played nearly every day and I still have a few rewards to earn. I will definitely finish, but it could have very easily been a different story had they not given us the bonuses.
---
I know it breaks canon, but I think it's safe to say that 76 is semi canon at best, but they could absolutely bring in things like a Vault 13 set Tribals, NCR, Legion, Followers, Khans, Talon company etc themed cosmetics. They have Piper's outfit, they have the NCR Veteran Ranger outfit so it isn't a huge jump.
---
He roasted you more than Grahms barbecue meats. 
---
11 out of 10. Would have given me hurty feels.
---
Buyable for gold next patch btw
---
Had this happen to us as well, someone power armor phased in to earl before the rubble cleared and we think it screwed up the timers/tracking with the event
---
the one to the right that leads to the right side of the building
---
One of the first responses I got on my post is someone who didn't agree with me! But I'm glad to see so many do.
---
This will help with withdrawal.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I2KUPiVmajs
---
Ranger Armor, and add the Prisoner‚Äôs Collar to fix the gap at your neckline. Cool red light effect too
---
I'd rather have an early helping if mischief night
---
True, if they can have Piper's outfit and NCR rangers (fallout first) they can defo release more outfits like from the tribals etc. It would defo be super popular and earn them a lot of cash lol
---
Just keep pacifist on an don't engage and you'll be fine
---
The Main goal for a new game dev should be to focus on building a stable and good foundation with lore that gives potential to build upon, a style that works for the gamer.
---
They clearly achieved that, wich means they can invest more in the future.
---
Nah, that should be called the "Radagast".
---
I missed the first double score weekend and finished before the second, never did any NW challenges and missed an entire week, so the two extra daily challenges were a huge help with not falling behind but with how much I missed it shows how wrong the math was
---
It's pretty awesome in theory but pretty shitty in execution. I went back to ammo bombing newbs after trying it a few times.
---
I get that the NCR Ranger's outfit is technically lore friendly given it's pre-war nature but it also clearly still says "LAPD" on it which is fucking wild to think it's ended up in WV just 25 years after the bombs.
---
In my defence as a level 52 who joined one yesterday I didn't die once and stimpaked a few fallen people. But I spent most of the time running around avoiding dying. I was wholly unprepared. My shots were hopelessly worthless and the mysterious stranger gave out far more damage than me.
---
No, as much as I love fasnacht, 2 weeks of it last time did me in lol.
---
What we need is a new event that isn't either of them that coincides with another holiday or something, maybe a spring clean event or a totally made up holiday
---
Yeah defo, I just mean it's obvious they want to please the fans (considering that outfit is such a staple fallout outfit and a lot of ppl love nv) so why not do it with more outfits?
---
Beyond the limit of 8, the game sometimes puts people in different instances despite an instance not being full. 
---
For example, 5 of us went to the event and I ended up in a solo instance while the others were in another together.
---
Iirc you can now only pvp with one person at a time so you should be free to engage the one with a bounty. 
---
You should have stashed your junk and kited them away from your camp. They would follow you everywhere if you show you're up for pvp.
---
Fasnacht is simply better cause it requires involvement. In meet week if 6 people afk while on drum and meat it‚Äôs already 75% done and takes a whopping 5-20 seconds after someone puts greens in. With Fasnacht you at least have to sit around for 10-20 minutes making hour waits feel shorter/ less grindy and making the event feel like an event rather than 2 minute of waiting and 30 seconds of chores.
---
Well they ARE cursed....
---
It'd be cool if they actually had any impact. The reason no other games do it is because they're not lazy, but Bethesda jumps on the idea of getting to tint an area orange and making that "content". You're not really launching a nuke or changing anything, just applying a filter.
---
Better yet combine them both into one fantastic orgy of parade marching, bonfires, meat sweats, critter boppin musical festival cook out to dazzle the senses and bewilder the mind. Does it make sense? No, but at this point very little does.
---
It's a bit of a step backwards toward the t-65 but I love being able to craft my legendary gauss minguns. Ammo only takes 5 lead and 15 steel for 27 rounds with r2 ammo Smith. (it isn't very ammo effienct but is a fun gun with the tri-barrel and capacitor? (The higher energy damage mod)
---
Calibrated Shock (increased carry weight) is a must on PA legs. I like the Motion assist for torso over medic pump but that's because I run r2 born survivor already. I like the vats bonus mod for the head since the plasma caster is my casual go to. Arms are in nodded for durability and lack of worthwhile mods.
---
I run X-01 for style, but t-65 is the optimal choice stat wise and if you got the gold for the t-65 legs and shocks it's not a bad investment toward the full set. I wouldn't scrap your excavator set though, I lug around my lv25 10 lb. Excavator set on a frame for the occasional mining trip. (You can rename the sets by inspecting the frame in your inventory.)
---
They also have (almost inexplicably) tried to target older fans (pre FO3) with 76. Jet isnt present, they mention the rig, they bring up the APA being post war and mention the vertibird schematics, they gave the WV Super Mutants an origin far more in line with FO1's, they brought the original Maxson into the game and made noted mentions of Mariposa, the floaters are back etc.
---
So why not make some cosmetics for that same targeted demographic?
---
Hopefully its to keep the event a challenge rather than the dog-pile speed-run it would otherwise be
---
if only the writers had as much enthusiasm as the teddy bear posers
---
I was transferring items between characters, lost 2000 45. rounds. üò¢
---
The worst is that they let low levels into the event taking up spots.
---
I made it back in wahoooooo :D
---
Did you hear the encrypted message on the radio say Mariposa? I freaked out when I heard it ü•∫
---
I totally agree with you, I personally even prefer 76 over 4 (especially when it comes to lore) and I would love more outfits from the older fallouts.
---
Yeah earlier had a spot get taken up by a level 15 with a tire iron. Wasn‚Äôt sure wether to be pissed or laugh
---
Extra fast Shovel
---
As long as one lives you do complete it.  The event also ends pretty much as soon as the boss dies even if there are a ton of bugs still swarming the Brahmin.  It can be tricky sometimes to get them to the farm since vats won't work on a lot of the bugs on the way there.  Need to be fast with manual aim and know when it's okay to split up if you want to go chase down the straggler to speed things up.  It almost always fine to just wait around for the straggler though, it rarely gets attacked and comes back on its own.
---
Time to get more meat cleaver plans :')
---
Very slim!! Lol
---
I don't mind as the extra 3 star low weight bundles of legendary scrip sit nicely in my stash.
---
Yeah same, 76 has a fuckton of issues but I think that the written lore in it is probably Bethesda's strongest showing so far. The pre-war jet in FO4 was one of the most lazy oversights I've seen and I was very glad to see that Jet wasn't in 76.
---
Sadly somebody used the PA glitch to get to Earle and killed him before the countdown timer finished. This also bugs the event which means it will never complete.
---
Dude I‚Äôve been asking that question for the LONGEST. Thank you!!!
---
Lmao that is hilariously incompetent design.
---
So just Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
100% and it‚Äôs not like it counts as your 3* from finishing the event either... hell you can get 120 scrip from that event if you are lucky enough to get a 3* from Earle that is.
---
I was transferring weapons....üò≠
---
Rawrzilla when?
---
Also I want a Deathclaw PA limb mod, if not for practical use, at least looks.
---
Unfortunately some low level missions require you to go there, namely when you help out Rose.
---
Why tho
---
I was in a failed run when another nuke was dropped.
---
So I figured I'd try to get in on it one last time,  but being in the middle of a nuke zone I had to run for cover so jumped in the mine. 
---
It let me I to the event but in a separate instance all by myself. My disappoint was immeasurable.  
---
So many resources blown through for no return.
---
You gotta shave
---
How do you know which team is doing what for this game?
---
The fact that there are 2 teams working on this game at the same time is kind of a big deal.
---
It's the collapse, gotta be faster nerd
---
Should be an event there where it spawns a massive deathclaw
---
The reason is game pass it allows ppl to play for free if they have game pass
---
I am also itching to fork the lawn.  I'll fork anything at this point!!
---
Happy to help!
---
üëçüòÇ
---
I just got one!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Ah so someone most likely snuck down for a kill then teleported out, one guy did definitely leave the event early cause we went from 5 to 4 but I figured he just left because he didn't think we could kill him in time
---
Not too much of a stretch to say the BoS forget after a long while and it's just in a report lost in a file somewhere. Or maybe the Enclave is able to keep their name a secret?
---
Same here. I found the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù way  to do it is take a picture of what ammo I have then go down the list as I use the converter. Such nonsense
---
You mean since there is no endgame, they should get frustrated by normal mobs?
---
Blah blah boring boring........new topic please
---
Is that a proto-type mk II helmet design?
---
Can't wait to give my t-65 the Frank Horrigan look.
---
literally FO76 is both one of the worst games ive ever played and yet one of the best online expeirences ive ever had and it's because the community is so good
---
I still sell the main stuff like like .308, 5.56 some energy stuff. The rest I‚Äôve just scrap
---
Make explosive launchers hitscan? dude wtf is wrong with you
---
You're honestly suggesting that fat man, missiles and grenade launchers have no travel time?
---
ok dude whatever you say
---
not using it; I throw away or try to sell.
---
Not worth the hassle, in my opinion. Even if the menus on it were better, the conversion rates don't seem that great to me. Between the ammunition generator and simply looting, I get more than enough ammo. If I do manage to get low, it's pretty easy to buy large quantities from other players.
---
Two shot. Easily my fav gun I use 90% of the time. Prime receiver. Low amp usage, cobalt flux is needed to make more but rarely.
---
They did not but they absolutely should, though.
---
Quad is what makes the crossbow actually fun and viable and it‚Äôs a shame the BP weapons cannot benefit from it.
---
Wait a min, this event have slot?
---
Dirext quote from Valseek over at the PTS
---
"Hi,¬†
---
No, the damage bonus calculation changes are not intended to make the game seem harder. Previously, the way damage scaled with all the buffs you could accumulate through Perks, legendary effects, food, etc., etc., was pretty unwieldy to work with from a development perspective. The changes that are in the PTS right now greatly simplify how those bonuses affect your damage.¬†As a result, we have a much better path forward to make smarter and more effective balance changes (and buffs!) These changes look like nerfs right now, but they are changes¬†we needed to make as we continue to work on the game and make it even better.
---
**I know it's frustrating right now that you're dealing less damage than before, but it opens up more possibilities in terms of balance¬†for us going forward. Will definitely be bringing all of the thoughts folks have been sharing here¬†on the damage bonus changes in the PTS¬†to the dev team. Will let you know what I hear back.**
---
Thank you!"

---
Even the fixed amounts they use seem stupid. Got to have 5 mini nukes before you can turn any in??
---
10, 100, 1000? With 900 ammo you gotta do it 9 times. I can understand not having a sliding scale but it should have just ammo available to turn in shown and have an option for max available
---
Yeah it sucks bro, hopefully it will sort it self out but when the update come out everything was fine at least for me then it seems after the reset it's bugged out along with my challenges auto completing
---
Two shot as the only legendary effect?
---
Was just thinking today about how I expanded my cash of weapons from 2 to 7 for the new boss, and how annoyed I was that there wasn't a single skin for any of them.
---
Now I'm reconsidering that thought.
---
How do you push afkers ?
---
Tried the colossal problem event for the forst time here the other day (absolutely loved it) and I was kinda roleplaying a bit in my head walking slowly and looking around, taking the moment in and bam. Some guy dressed up as chally moo moo comes besides me
---
No need to go over the top. Just start out with a 1 star, which you should be able to find in-game, at least in my experience, between 1k-3kish (sometimes less). After that, you can shop around for better secondary and tertiary effects.
---
If you're a stealth rifleman, go with Intigating as you can one-shot a bunch of things. Junkies is good as an all-rounder and better during tougher fights but then again a lever action isn't the best in that circumstance anyhow. You can go with AA too if you can't find either of those two.
---
I have a three star. I think increased VATS and something else are the other effects but the two shot part is what makes the difference. It one shots almost everything, can take down level 65 scorch beasts in two or three. I run chinese stealth armor too. Not great for Colossal Problem but for everything else it works.
---
I‚Äôm running 5% health and I‚Äôd rather die than dealing less damage, it‚Äôs our bloodied spirit
---
go to hopewell cave instead for a bit of a challenge
---
Ahahah I feel you, I can get completly lost in my Roleplaying and just kinda making scenarios up in my head, and then some guy with a fasnacht mask snaps you right out of it
---
Excluding Bloodied and Junkie's, the next best legendary effect would probably be Instigating if you want to go for a one-shot sneaky sniper or Anti-Armor for general purpose plinking. So I'd say either Instigating/10% damage while aiming or Anti-Armor/25% fire rate.
---
We could never prove such biased drops. The sheer number of drops required as well as Beth changing things in the background made it essentially impossible to. Since then,  everything looks like a regular uniform distribution PRNG. Your case is just a lucky streak.
---
(That being said, I still believe, in the early days, the RNG was rigged in favor of Youtubers and Twitch Streams because they almost always got TSE Handmades and TSE weaponry. I only ever got 8 TSE weapon drops over 3300 hours.)
---
Meg's raiders are more comparable to the Great Khans from NV than the raiders of the other two Bethesda Fallouts. They have a concept of family and community and are not automatically aggressive to outsiders (Khans will trade with people, will be willing to talk with people and will show mercy at times, but are still raiders)
---
thats baby forest, it isnt a one shot for babies
---
We live in a day that a Deathclaw is considered a normal mob.
---
My how the mighty have fallen.
---
So you spent the event pushing people around and not helping with the cookout?
---
I was pretty pissed when fear drove me into that drill
---
It killed me fast
---
He was spinning so i walked into the circle he bumped me lather rinse repeat
---
It was pre cookout but nice job assuming sherlock
---
I'm learning to 180 when he's about to scream, saves you from the fear effect!
---
It'll get there one day. There will be a lot of crying and gnashing of teeth much like with the TSE nerf but life will go one.
---
Nice job:) did the lords work keep it up lol
---
I just dump unwanted ammo on the floor. The machine is so infuriating to use i value my time and sanity far more than a bit of recycled ammo...
---
At 100 gold its too pricy though ‚Äî I would like to earn them for completing weeklies or a number of dailies!
---
*tries to reply but frame rate is too low
---
Sorry bud. Fasnacht is fine and all but it's a once a year event. 
---
I'd much rather the meat week or an extended period of treasure hunter over that.
---
I have this problem too https://ibb.co/3CYK3Sj :(
---
When fightinge Earl and the SBQ on the regular, what do you think?
---
The Deathclaw is no longer on the apex, how else would you be able to get those as a pet?
---
That is absolutely ridiculous üò°
---
I have started collecting outfits in preparation for mannequins, gonna open a little apparel museum.
---
Oof always transfer via a buddy keeps 'mishaps' from happening regardless condolences.
---
I had this happen when I dude was spamming his Tesla so our game almost crashed what fun
---
I was being facetious.
---
This would just make meta builds even more viable/ required. I made a min-max non-meta build and then changed out some perks for more fun ones and it does very low damage; I don't want to be forced to play the same as everyone else.
---
I do not think that word means what you think it means...
---
Definitely awesome being free from the grind. It felt so good to take a long 12 hour drive to visit my extended family for a week and not worry since I‚Äôm not tied to logging in every day.
---
i likened it to the red death quest (or w/e it was called...) from far harbor.
---
We somehow ended up in a good cycle, where we weren't all shooting at the same time and instead we were naturally alternating. For my build I used a few stealthboys to shed attention ... and I made sure to kill adds if they got too busy to keep them off the others.
---
We had one guy who tended to stay near the entrance, two of us who worked the middle and cycled and another skirting the edges.
---
Yes as that is the purpose of this post. You get it.... right?
---
Is being a ‚Äúlowbie‚Äù better or worse than a ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù? I would figure it‚Äôs a step up because you at least have some experience although it sounds like a bit of a dig.
---
Just let me build my 10 sinks &amp; M.C. Escher staircases in peace so I can finish my dailies
---
I do not believe that word means what you think it means.... lol
---
it does not remove the budget.
---
Welp damn it removed it for me sorry bout the bad luck
---
Tried a few times don't bother. It is scenery.
---
Prolly because different people value different things
---
you absolutely sure about that? did you scrap all stored items after you moved and before you started rebuilding? you‚Äòd be the first one to get rid of the ghost budget yourself.
---
Oh and those ants! Its a real battle the deathclaw always wins, then promptly dies from a shotty blast in the face. Poor guy, I wanna see a legendary sheepsquatch vs a diseased glowing deathclaw
---
Which sub? This one? I‚Äôm after the Slaty Mod.

Also, I think it‚Äôs chances of dropping are the same as the other plans from the info I saw posted by another Redditor.

He already had an answer by the time I commented. His whole post is just another useless post that I've seen a million times. If he would max out his build like I said he wouldn't even need to post it. I don't need a neckbeard telling me what I can and can't comment so bye
---
I stand corrected far as i can recall it meant lying not being flippant * shrug *
---
Apparently Anti Armour on lasers still doesn‚Äôt work so yeah.
---
Wellnues there is a lot of lag in the game, but the auto teslas seem to be a big contributing factor to it
---
I used a one star two shot for quite a while.  More stars are always better but it is a solid weapon if you do a lot of aiming down sights.  The second bullet will miss kind of often in vats but almost always lands when aiming manually.
---
Im on lvl 95/100 and lost the exact same amount, it‚Äôs completely shit that this is still a thing. Kills all enthusiasm to play the game.

Goodnight sweet prince. üò≠
---
Perks, proper allocation of SPECIAL and crafted mods will up your damage significantly, you're still a relatively low level so you've probably not settled on a build yet (which is fine, I didnt bother doing mine properly until like level 70) but when you feel like going that route there's a lot of really good resources online
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/ladydeath/

Its not how I'd do it, but a build like this with bloodied effect on your rifle and a few mutations will do stupid amounts of damage

You can do everything from the initial purchase. The subscription is just for if you want private world with inf Mat storage.
---
In truth you really don‚Äôt need it. Just having 100 to 150 of each type of mat is plenty enough.
---
The only P2W mechanic I could think of would be repair kits but you can get improved versions from killing SBQ. The scrape kit on the other hand is basically useless.
---
If you enjoy these kinds of games then I would recommend to buy it. It‚Äôs in a much better state then it was before.
---
And a toothed (poison) version of one of ‚Äòsquatch weapons as well!
---
I liked doing them but now I haven‚Äôt got much use for doing them just helping out others with anything group related or buying stuff at there camps etc
---
I almost did the same thing when I ran through that questline. Luckily I remembered why that shack/pylon combo looked familiar (saw the YouTube of someone soloing Encryptid) before I triggered it. I still have two recall cards, now that I think about it... Never did start it myself.
---
Cause someone always has to get bethesded. That‚Äôs a fact like our flat earth circles around the sun and this game is just another vaultec simulation
---
I didnt even know theres was a deathclaw there the first time I got the egg quest I just snuck up to the nest, looked around, took the egg and left
---
If anything I‚Äôll pick up the responders bundle as I missed out last time
---
Lucky I‚Äôve just gotten 3 shovels
---
That would be pretty cool. Is that a mod?
---
Maybe he was just one of the poor fellas who got the "respawn" bug, where the game respawns you but you dont have any control over your char, still have the prompt to respawn but the only thing possible to do is to fast travel away so you get a loading screen which fixes the situation. But this results in no longer participating in the event as you cant fast travel back to the event.
---
it is much better now. I use it regularly. Put ammo into vendor at 1 cap, when it gets to certain limit eg, 1000 or 1200 take out and convert in a process.
---
Not an issue.
---
Gatling lasors almost no dmg at all, in comparison to others. Yeah. Tho if they buff Base dmg of some weapons, itl do.
---
Yes having something like this would be great. I'm only level 53 so I have mostly been questing and doing dailies, but I find when I do want to do an event it's really annoying to have to scroll around the map looking for what's popped.
---
Does it not have a recommend level for the event.
---
Or at least to make one five point perk that grands plus 60% damage to pistols (like explosives have) instead of three three pointed perks (equal to nine points perk points). There are so good agility perks for pistol build... but damage perks reduce its availability to six points with maximum agility. And legendary agility does not increase number of using perk points.
---
Event drop
---
Random reward, you get it or you don't.
---
The amount of dumb in this subreddit is mind boggling.
---
Literally all they've done is change the damage formula to make the vast majority of damage buffs additive. No tuning passes yet.
---
With multiplicative damage modifiers weapons and the DR system weapons are unbalancable. They'd have to check every single weapon with every single modifier and combination of modifiers against multiple DR breakpoints and then adjust *every.* *single.* *modifier.* independently in order to prevent ballooning.
---
With additive modifiers they can buff/nerf the obvious outliers with zero risk of breaking things. It also has the benefit of requiring significantly less work.
---
Calling for Bethesda to do the former set of balancing *and then* convert over to additive where their modifications will have meant absolutely nothing is dumb.
---
5% chance
---
No shit lol. I see it being offered up for legacy‚Äôs and B2525 fixers.
---
What do you mean one shot? It's in the starting region and I was there at level 8. Took me 5 minutes to kill the deathclaw while wasting all my ammo.
---
When I went at like level 10, there wasn‚Äôt a deathclaw there, expected the mother to go mental and jump out once I stole the eggs, felt really underwhelmed
---
A Deathclaw boss event would be cool.
---
This is bloody common sense
---
They should be able to sniff out any hidden person and negate stealth attacks.
---
Give them more resistances
---
And should be able to stun/stumble character at higher chance even in PA.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that. So not going to rush in if my team isn‚Äôt the one that launches the nuke. Maybe they want people to PvP for a spot in the event lol
---
This comment did not age well.
---
Known to who? I would have no idea of any of these problems, without purchasing, if I didn‚Äôt read this sub.
---
Bonus xp would be nice, or some atoms.
---
Sometimes goofy objects like bear plushies or billboards are used to tell the story of a place, maybe that scene represents someone being buried in the ground of the bathroom?
---
exactly!
---
Right. I thought I explained exactly how this was an exploiting the games mechanics. 
---
So clipping in games is when two objects are moved in such a way that the games collision detection is not working as intended and one of the objects becomes hidden. 
---
The spike trap that he used wasn't hard to see, he placed it in such a way that it was clipped under the floor. Essentially out of the  game. So that is the very definition of an exploit. 
---
Then the next part is placing that between an object that slows you down so instead of hitting you one time, like is intended, it exploits the hit box detection algorithm and hits you multiple times a second basically making you explode. You could even hear the sound glitching as this occurred.
---
Haha no its just a design i made
---
I played about 22 cookouts over the weekend cos I knew I wasn't gonna have time this week... I got everything but the grill and the Tenderizer mods in the end, but the Tenderizer plan was one of the last things to drop for me and I've only seen it once. So maybe it's rare or maybe that was just my luck.
---
Yeah man I feel you.

If you do get it sell it on the market sub. It‚Äôs not really worth much but some people will trade legacy‚Äôs for it.

Because you finished it
---
Let them hunt in packs and also be a random encounter.
---
The yau guai are deadly because of their stagger and mostly found in groups of 2-5.
---
If they do the same with deathclaws and make them slightly tougher with claws that can rip through even the toughest armor with ease they would once again be rightly feared
---
Why, not, just, bring back NV ammo crafting system? (brake unused ones, make what yu want)
---
Man, just making better ui in converter will do...
---
It would nice if Bethesda sorted out some of the campaign bugs like the cure for the scorched.  Cannot complete the mission because of the centrifuge bug
---
No

I can‚Äôt wait to donate all my stuff to BOS

Grief probably
---
You have 10 weeks worth of challenges. You decided to do them faster basically by taking advantage of the repeatable and double xp, etc. 
---
I‚Äôm personally happy to be done with the challenges.
---
Agreed also nice name
---
It's to keep it more challenging. And you get more enemy AI spawns too.
---
So its less performance taxing on 8 players than 20 on SBQ which is a joke battle that lasts seconds.
---
Harder terrain to navigate and lots of enemies makes this event challenging.
---
Yer so What??? I did om pc as 49 or some Thing... Soooo stop whining.
---
They're changing how all damage calculates so it's easier for them to alter the numbers when necessary. This isn't a complex idea to accept yet here we are with another dumb 'bloodied nerf' post.
---
it's better
---
It would have to be very strong as most people that are bloodied just destroy everything in there path especially death claws
---
 I think it would be cool if meet week and fasnacht and any other event has a set date. For example, in games like runecape you know the Easter event will happen at Easter. The Christmas at Christmas.
---
Would be something to look forward too. They just need more events to scatter throughout the year. Now that wastlanders are back they should have brought all kind of strange holidays with them.
---
We need a nuka cola themed holiday. Pray for the continued supply of nuka cola and caps.
---
Um it‚Äôs never been pay to win. Yes if you want a private server you do need to pay for that service.
---
This should definitely be in the game though. Good job on the design.
---
It reduces being crippled which leads to staggers. Straight stagger chance and chance to be staggered when crippled are different. I was referencing the benefit of reduced staggers. This is also discussed in more detail if you just search adamantium skeleton.
---
The Tenderizer plan is supposed ot have the same drop chance as the others according to the datamine. The RNG in this game can be a bit borked though
---
Serendipity, mysterious saviour and a lifesaving piece come in handy too
---
Yeah I think people have either not used the perk or are just going off what they heard. Even googling or just searching on Reddit shows it reduces staggers.
---
So roughly a year or more from now they will do a other balance pass to improve the damage of some weapons.
---
Thanks for that üëç
---
Yes, yes yes yes. I can‚Äôt comment to your solutions, but the devs need to stop ignoring broken weapons. If they have greatly simplified how damage is applied, then there‚Äôs no excuse not to revisit these. There are not enough guns in the game to have a handful of them perpetually written off.
---
I was under this apparent misconception as well.  This is a huge oversight and problem
---
If they do go AFK, push them into the fire.
---
Especially those pesky robots. One second they are waiting to be looted and the blam! Your blind and they are gone.
---
Agreed and thank you :)
---
Come on man, do you not know how hard it is to move a skeleton?
---
When my friends and i are playing, we'll see the body in different spots. If i ask them where it is, i may still not see it
---
My only issue is that they don‚Äôt do enough damage. I want to see a desolate area with a huge crater not glowing plants
---
It should always prioritise teams as well. 3 of my friends got into one instance and I got stuck with a naked level 35 with a sledge hammer. I noped out of that one pretty quickly.

---
Do you know if the Brahmin grill plan is the same as the one in the atomic shop? It's expiring soon and I'm short on Atoms so I don't know whether to grind for more atoms or let it go and keep grinding the event for the plan.
---
With the perk you can't be crippled, has nothing to do with staggers, there is no way to remove a stagger, you can use a pneumatic chest so that the stagger isn't as bad but that's it.
---
Pneumatic Chest - decreases the effect of incoming staggers
---
Adamantium Skeleton - limbs can no longer be crippled (rank 3)
---
Neither work in tandem, neither remove staggers completely. The pneumatic chest just makes it so you recover faster and you can start shooting or hitting again.
---
How in the ever loving fuck did you get so many atoms?
---
One Thing i dont understand with the plans is the workbenches... Why do we get Them as random drop, when we basicly get Them as quest rewards???? E.g. I have like 5 or 6 plans for the tinker for sale and no1 buys Them.
---
C'on bethesda we so all get the workbench plan so why let Them drop as random drops?? And it is the same with generators. Those we get from the powerplant events

I think that since the morals of pre-war society are still ingrained into the minds of the survivors they tend to be less ruthless and more willing to show mercy. Compared to the next raiders in the timeline. The Kahns from the original fallout who were all born post-war in a rougher environment then Appalachia is much crueler. The OG Khans were blood eagle crazy but without the brainwashing or addictions.

Yes adamantium skeleton literally reduces staggers by getting rid of a whole category of injuries that will stagger you. How are you not getting this ?
---
&gt;So its less performance taxing on 8 players than 20
---
*looks at the endless Wendigo spawns*
---
Bullshit.
---
Isn't he lvl 110?
---
No... It.. Doesn't remove staggers nor reduce them. A stagger has nothing to do with being crippled. How are you not getting this?
---
I just finished the run and find it challenging to log on and play anymore. Good time for a 76 vacation. Yep
---
PvP doesn‚Äôt work his way anymore. You would need to engage them both. Likely, they are on a team and one of them just got wanted. Either shoot them or don‚Äôt. No big deal either way.
---
You think that‚Äôs bad? My best weapon was an explosive Gatling gun
---
Dude literally Google does being crippled cause stagger. I just did and guess what, I was right lol.
---
Now you'll have to teach him bout the birds and the honey bees
---
outfits???? how about being able to display power armor? baby steps....
---
Word from the PTS is the lvln100 deathclaws are much stronger. Take more and deal way more damage.
---
Get the plan from the Brotherhood vendor bots in Watoga or the Whitesprings and craft them. The Gatling gun doesn't have that many mods and the drop chance is relatively high, so this isn't too large a drain on crafting resources.
---
Pretty sure this was debunked
---
Don't know that why I'm asking, if it recommended level is 30 say you can't blame low level from trying. If its like 100 and you have level 20's trying to do it it just selfish I never go into an event that a higher recommended level than what I am. I jump on a primal meats event in the mire if there is enough people that I'm not going to make much of a difference either way.
---
Yeah and old Olney and it's sewers or the deathclaw sanctuary in fo3, all have the same thing in common having to deal with more than one deathclaw and as you said their speed was a factor too.
---
The fo4/fo76 varient whilst looking impressive just doesn't have the same fear factor
---
Fallout 76, the neediest community ever

It's improved, but still needs a lot of work. You just have to try it and see for yourself. If you have fun then play. If not, move on.
---
Just fyi spreading misinformation just hurts everyone. You even had 4 other people blindly agree when a simple Google search proves my point. And when my answer literally helps OP but you are spreading false data and arguing with me it doesn't help anyone.
---
Maybe a cave entrance appears leading to a labyrinth with collapsing and clearing pathways so no two playthrus are the same. With a staging area at the end for gathering the team up (real risk of getting stuck in maze) before blasting into the Gamma deathclaw mother nest. She must die as she's the producing nie unstoppable Gamma deathclaws
---
Two ppl minimum have to set the blast countdown timer at staging area and blast causes maze to close off and flood with radioactive waste killing any lolligagers. Yes there will be some trollage re the maze but it happens with all the mechanics in game. Part n parcel of playing fo76. Sweet isnt so sweet without the odd tinge of bitter.
---
Imagine it's your first hour playing and you see an event call A Collosul Problem with loads of people there. They be like da fuck is that lol.
---
I scrapped it! I'm just selling all my unwanted ammo in my vendor. The converter is so stupid, why when all we need is the ability to break down ammo in our tinker bench?
---
Currently it's a good game with a lot of fun, the only problem I see it's the "pay to win" about the fallout 1st, the infinite scrapbox or more stash space should be available for all the players without any cost. It's a good advantage as you don't have to be gathering junk to repair your weapons or been overcumbered every time you complete an event. Also I hate the mediocre limitations: scripts limitations, stash limitations, camp budget limitations, gold bullion limitations. 
---
Besides that it's a pretty decent game atm.
---
At the least a deathclaw theme rollercoaster üòÅ
---
Well, one of the aims of the SCORE seasons was to limit the availability of ATOMs from challenges, so going back to challenges rewarding ATOMs as soon as you're done with the season run would go counter to that goal. But I agree, some small reward would be nice.
---
On the other hand I also cherish the freedom of not having to log in and care about/do the challenges every day, which is a reward in and of itself.

Texas is the team generally working on it where as big decisions as far as story and content go is from BGS Maryland. The world itself was also created by BGS Maryland. Hence why the world and storys are good and the little things while ok leave a lot to be desired SOMETIMES. A lot of times I have no complaints but sometimes I just don‚Äôt understand why the texas crew did what they did.

It pisses me of that after converting ammo it takes and hour to flick back through all the pages to get back off it. Also they need to add that you can convert ammo that in your stack and not just what you are holding. I think these to thing are more important to sort than the interface, which is a pain but useable.
---
Completely agree that Beth should communicate better. The issue with this bug is that know one knows what causes it or how to reproduce it. Without that info Beth can‚Äôt even start working on it. It also seems to effect some heavily and others not at all. I ignored all the advice given on the sub and never autocompleted a single challenge.

Exactly mate.. if the whole team was shambles fair enough... but two out of 8? Not really possible when 6 could easily wipe the event if the builds being used were semi efficient.
---
The community is the best part of this game mate. Least toxic and most helpful I've seen in 20+ years of MMO play.
---
&gt;	If the community and other players really weren't a problem, then why would they sell us on the idea of private server so heavily?
---
Define heavily. Players were asking of private servers since before launch.  Main reason is the ability to mod that will hopefully one day be added. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry your experiences with this game and other players have apparently not been good.
---
Because if there was it would bring the whole pay to win argument back into the game. The challenges and score seem fairly balanced. I have missed out on a full week challenge and a few days of challenges and yet I am still on course to complete it. I think they got the balance spot on. One of the few times Bethesda nailed something.
---
since you said he wasn't moving after dieing, was he AFK or did he have the respawn bug?

if you get the respawn bug the only fix is fast travelling out of the instance, but since that boots you out of the event and any reward with it you have to sit there until a team member goes outside to fast travel to them to go outside to regain control and still be in the event.
---
i can say from personal experience it sucks having to sit there instead of helping in the event because bethesda can't fix their S#!t.
---
I have social anxiety and rarely interact with other players short of a wave or a thumbs up emoji, so I don't understand how trade works in this game.  This lower level was in my camp one day with his buddy buying stuff from my vendors, and he asked to trade with me. Curious, so I accepted... Waited ages... His side of the trade box stayed empty, but then the outfit I was wearing (green shirt and combat boots) appeared on my side. Well I didn't care and I figured if he wanted what I was wearing bad enough I'd let him have it for free.  But was I supposed to see his inventory? And does that mean he could see all of mine? That seems a bit dodgy.
---
Special attack is a sideways shuffle through a double bed
---
Gonna be another year at least until they get a decent game going.
---
Yeah I'm not bothering with the Chally outfit in the shop, the dirty one looks almost the same and is good enough for me!
---
Yes and while you fight raiders sneak behind him and take all his equipment.
---
Stupid question how do you fast travel to a team mate?
---
&gt;but it was dark.
---
*Looks at the Pack from Nuka-World*
---
PS4, sorry.
---
Deathclaws, sloths, hermit crabs
---
Their*
---
Scorch Beast Empress?
---
Given how they‚Äôre running things at the moment, all that excess score might suddenly apply when you start the second season. I can just imagine the emergency klaxons at Bethesda now.
---
It's not hard I'm level 15 all solo never touched an event over my level. I've done few responder events solo.. But I don't even touch the others that's why I play so much to level because I want to join eventually.
---
Sad as it is, i doubt it. If you look back at Bethesda games none of them are even close to be called "bug free". This game will continue to be the buggiest online game there is. Until the day comes (sooner or later) when they pull the plug.
---
Then as he dies he says with his last breath *I've got my eyes on you, no offence* then he dies and you get nothing and wake up realising it was all a dream until you go to foundation and he's not there.
---
You ok buddy?
---
Just to add as a comment I know there are many issues and things going on right on but just wanted to throw out something in advance in case they actually would do it for this year.  What are your favorite monsters that you'd like to see?  
---
Halloween all year round in my head.
---
Good :D
---
I‚Äôve done it with 3 people that have non meta builds and 2 others that didn‚Äôt even have builds being level 20-30.. if a couple people know what to do and have experience it‚Äôs really not hard, it‚Äôs even been solo completed a few times by people from this community
---
You can most definitely trade. Just trade responsibly. Other subreddits and platforms have services like couriers that ensure you won‚Äôt get scammed.
---
That sounds like a total waste of time and energy. I hope you have a better experience if you try it again.
---
Put it on display in your camp so that everyone who visits knows what a heartless monster you are.
---
I still have the watch too lol.
---
I think the devs said at Quakecon that there were *multiple* teams working on FO76 at the same time. Which I guess means a handful of people from each, and would go a long way to explaining why things get broken then fixed, then broken then fixed, because nobody is communicating properly.
---
Ye I got the pike first time. I seem to also see the gas mask alot more. I was with a group the other day and 4/7 got the mask and non got the pike. Idk if it was luck of just how it is.
---
Use "Back" after each buy or sell, and it will take you to the last ammo type and amount. When done, then only a couple backs to exit.
---
Not going to lie, I traded a fixer plan for mine and I kept seeing ppl asking for top tier shit. I just got a extra one last night after getting the outfits like 40 events in a row. I posted it on market and i wanna see what I get offered. I think it is ridiculous that ppl want top tier stuff for it as I just had to trade a fixer plan which I have like 3 extras still.
---
The Treasure Hunter event changes sound good. 
---
Glad they finally returned Assassin to its Fallout 4 effect. Not sure why they didn't do that with Wastelanders from the beginning.
---
The event has been on for a week on PC buddy.
---
Just posted about this very thing on a thread about deathclaw island being a waste.
---
Deathclaw, grafton monster, and super mutant behemoth,
---
A somewhat itelligent behemoth "king/warlord" with hords of super mutants and their AA mini guns would be amazing. Would Love it to happen in a pit/arena setting.
---
I love how they gave a shoutout to the guy from the silver shroud quest (who is a ghoul in fo4) in some of the terminal entries.
---
Ounce of prevention quest needs to be completed. Of note, I was able to do this quest on a private server for my alt yesterday.
---
Mine auto jumps back there, so the only way to do it is  exit it after each time, or they could make it to you hold b and it just quits the machine no matter what screen your on.
---
Like a cave where the mutants have made a civilisation? Like where you can participate for caps,food,plans and Weopons/armour?
---
As long as people stay away from my other location I am fine with that.
---
Same. I tried the original UI, and then the updated UI. Both were so bad, it's not worth the effort.
---
Neither of those are lasers tho.....
---
no thanks, I don't need another 146 identical worthless masks
---
thanks everyone for information, it‚Äôs seems like everyone prefers AA over TS
---
Yah I‚Äôve managed to do this with a Gatling laser onto my Tesla rifle
---
Sorry, *Energy weapon.
---
https://youtu.be/dHgpklQc34I
---
Take a break. Do anything else. Best I got ATM.
---
After 4 events I‚Äôve gotten the rug, meat pile, cursed harpoon and then the heads.
---
Me and a friend have the same issue, I've been told there is some PSN related maintenance and thus some games do not work atm..
---
Well, I got mine when it first came out and the noise was gone for me. Could be glitchy from player to player though.
---
Sir, this is a fallout subreddit...
---
They had bigger fish to fry :-)
---
I mean, you decorate your base with human remains such as hanging corpses and severed heads, and have all your people talking about how people shouldn't have fought back or not being able to get the image of their grisly death out of their heads, and really all you are is just a *weak* raider. You are still a murderous (potentially junkie) bandit, but you still try to pretend you are civilised, so you can sleep better.
---
Crater is also due a change of management if you don't help them get the gold. Most of the nameless raiders really aren't happy to have moved into a cancer causing dustbowl that isn't even a safe journey from the local raiding targets.
---
Wtf?   My experiences have been mostly positive.  Sorry yours have not. üòü
---
Never seen a trap base in game, haven‚Äôt been griefed in months (since they changed slap damage)
---
About a year ago I did have some creep say a few things to my female toon (hey baby, blah blah).  I just fast traveled away.  Next time I will pop on mic and bust it something like ‚Äúyo dude, what‚Äôs up‚Äù (I‚Äôm a guy, lol). 
---
That‚Äôs about the worst.
---
Private server?  I hardly use mine anymore, prefer playing with peeps, met a lot of nice ones.  I mainly use mine to transfer stuff between characters.
---
Another Xbox player here. Haven‚Äôt noticed any unusual disconnects, but I feel like I‚Äôve been crashing more often. 
---
10 runs into Charleston capital, 4 crashes upon entering.
---
Ah yes because we should totally be fine with letting Bethesda get away with not fixning anything in the game and let all the event-ending glitches remain.
---
I was hoping for something like deathclaw quarry in New Vegas tbh
---
Another good farming spot is Sugar Grove in the Savage Divide. Quite a few desk fans in there, as well battered clipboards which offer springs iirc.
---
Heavily, being that the only reason they get fallout first literally is for the private server. to get away from other players, and not have them messing up your gameplay. Many people complain here daily about the other players in the game. It's always a complain about other players. Duping items, killing event bosses before they can even touch them. 
---
My experiences haven't really been that bad, except for the duplicating items part. That's just ridiculous. The fact that you can spend weeks on end trying to farm something, purchase it from another player with almost everything you have, and then it's deleted because it's deleted and removed with other duplicate items. That's just criminal
---
Me too, especially since my favourite gun on 4 is the spray and pray lol
---
i once opened a door to find him on the other side. he then gave me a knock-knock joke. yet to have a better timed joke
---
Not sure if appropriate but thought I‚Äôd add it here, a couple days ago at primal cuts in the bog I killed 3 legendary mobs and got 3 bloodied swing speed melee weapons in a row Shovel, shishkebab, and sickle which I thought was odd
---
A friend got her camp nuked. Not sure if it was because she was afk, which she was part of the time, or for some other reason. Still funny.
---
&gt;the event shouldn't even show up on the map for other players until the launcher has joined first
---
Could not agree any harder, absolutely this.
---
See a fixer plan. Back back mod. Etc I see that‚Äôs a totally fair trade. Don‚Äôt forget we get meat week part 2 in a couple of weeks.
---
I dropped a nuke yesterday and the event icon disappeared so I joined a team of someone already in there and got in the event half way through by just fast travelling to them.
---
If I remember correctly, it jumps back to the second screen, but you can still go back to the previous screen.
---
There's another problem like this where most melee weapons can only drop from mobs with the 50 limb damage effect. And that would explain why almost all of my melee weapons come with this secondary effect.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. I was glad a guy wanted the trade. Then right after my trade on Saturday I saw everybody posting they wanted legacies or rare outfits. I said hold on, then I got another drop so I want to see what the market is at for it. But I prob will trade for something cheap or just give it away to a team member
---
Yes there is.
---
Pretty sure it does not. But it should be set at no less than level 50.
---
I know it sounda bad but I do sincerlly feel bad
---
Let me guess outside site alpha? But no i havent only regular and glowing
---
Survivalists hang their victims from hooks and plant their heads on poles across their base? And wander around justifying atrocities to themselves with arguments as solid as "shouldn't have resisted" (put that in another context, and see how it sounds) while even getting PTSD from the things they do "I ain't getting that image out of my head anytime soon."?
---
I don't think I'll ever understand this desire to shove a factions sins under a rug before you can like/side with them. They are raiders, just not as psychotic as some, and they still do all the terrible stuff. They are all thieves. Most of them are murderers. Some of them are junkies. Some of them will be rapists. They are all of them scum as a lifestyle. I haven't found one in Crater that isn't some form of unpleasant criminal by our standards. But... why does that matter? You aren't electing them into a public office or waving their morals on a flag. They are a fictional faction who has interesting characters you find compelling and want to follow more than the more straight laced Settlers.
---
Own it. It's no different to finding the Empire in Star Wars more compelling than the Rebels.
---
They have vendor prices  listed there too? They‚Äôre about half the other prices.
---
And by the look of it, bloodied will still be king...
---
I see your point now.  
---
Like this, lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/igv2tt/earle_spawned_in_dead/
---
I've only just come back to the game over than meat week all the events I've seen have a recommended level.
---
I just block people like that
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to Halloween this year. It will be nice to escape in the game a bit also.
---
Check how many of those trades asking for legacy and meta gear actually get a response
---
Nailed it.
---
The wendigos do not count as glowing creatures, glow sight doesn‚Äôt work in this event
---
Eh, Foundation are quietly competent outside Ward and his guards. They have a pretty nice fortification built there, and seem to be making nice progress in mapping out Appalachia for future settling, and have even started raising livestock.
---
Meg decided that a crashed and irradiated space-station in a toxic region of the map, right next to a closed up but still incredibly radioactive ultracite fissure, was the ideal place to set down roots.
---
Yep that's been my strategy as well. Once the nuke drops I hit the event icon. Haven't failed getting in or completing that way. Usually my whole random team is in the same instance with me.
---
Lol, are you gaslighting?   There is a ‚Äúbalance change‚Äù incoming with the next major update.  
---
I for one am going to pop the popcorn and watch the show.   üòâ
---
As others have said the only difference is colour(atom shop = blue free plan = rusty brown) and honestly I think the "rusty" free version from the plan looks so much better. It looks like it belongs in the Wasteland. I love mine.
---
Same here on PS4
---
Thats crazy!  You should definitely get a guaranteed spot.
---
Instigating is the best for levers. If u need more than one shot then your doing it wrong. For 6k u might get someone to trade a vats 50 which helps on crits but I can‚Äôt see u getting an explosive for 6
---
Christ should be anyone under level 100
---
Yesterday 4 went in with me.while waiting for the rubble to clear they all left.i got his health down to the 2nd halfway mark solo but he was too spongy for me to solo.not sure if those other guys showing up made him stronger.had a hard time no dice.
---
There really isnt much difference at all. The "dirty" version still looks clean to me. Maybe a touch grubby. But it isnt torn up like many of the "dirty" free versions of outfits
---
Fire rate doesn‚Äôt work on levers. Single shot weapon.
---
It should be swarming with deathclaws. Just a writhing mass of them, so many the island can hardly stay afloat. All various levels to, from like 30 to 75. And at least one legendary. That would make it interesting and worthy of the name Deathclaw Island.
---
They could still do it together. not just throw in a balance pass, and then promise to someday do more balancing based on that, because that will be atrocious to wait for. as long as the balance thing doesnt make it to the public servers before an additional balance pass is added on top of the earlier one that changes things with the help of the foundation, then its fine though.
---
She's as far away from the queens lair you can get.
---
Foundation is a stones throw from the heavily fortified BoS base that got fucked in the last scorch attack.
---
Also Meg has the forethought to be as far away from everything as possible since there's a bunch of nuke happy psychopaths running around.
---
Happened to me once out of running the event 8 times so far. I realized the frame rate was super laggy and just bailed early while in the waiting room. The other times I had no performance issues in PS4. Think it is isolated to individual instances or servers.
---
There's only two people I trust enough to trade with. One of them is me, the other one isn't you.
---
And the award for "Most likely to turn up to a Colossal Problem on a Low Level Alt goes too..."
---
Still better to have them fire unrealistically than to be absolutely useless.
---
Same reason people keep posting threads about it, I suppose.
---
Might get into it tonight, but nobody to do quests with. Everybody just wanna chase beast all The time.
---
Im on ps4 so its way harder to find the less hardcore, willing to Explore gamers.
---
My bffr Lever begs to differ
---
There is so much about this event that sucks ass I've stopped doing it, I'm glad they've got it going but damn , what a collosal let down
---
yes there is. Do you mean to drop more than 3 nukes yourself with the same character?
---
It should be renamed "One lonely deathclaw island".
---
That's the place :)
---
Ive got a 1* junkies handmade lying around if you wanna try that out
---
Never seen a locked bench, didn't even know you could do it.
---
&gt;she is a much more capable and reliable leader than Paige.
---
 I hear this a lot, and I'm curious: why do you think so? 
---
When you meet them she has doomed a raiding party out of hubris and repeated a mistake the Raiders made before they fled, she has moved her people into cancer-ville (which they vocally dislike and call her out on, saying it was better up north), there is a holotape about her getting removed from power if this gamble doesn't pay off, and her personal 'circle' is a conman sleeping with her to stay in her good graces and for the benefits, a ragemonster babysitter, a traitor, and a suicidal demolitions expert. You spend the entire Raider questline trying to form them into something resembling a working team - and in the end the only really useful one is our ghoulish friend who pops the door.
---
Foundation on the other hand seems to generally be ticking over quite well, they are expanding faster than expected, have livestock and proper walls in a good location, while people are generally thankful to Paige and people across the world space note a little too often how great Foundation is and how it's going to inspire more places like it. Their questline is more about resource acquisition for a specialised job, and stopping the raiders from foiling the plan. 
---
I'm honestly curious is there is an angle I've not looked at things from that could make the raiders seem better and more competent in my eyes.
---
i am sad panda now
---
I'd love to fight Earle with a real group. Too much to chance in this event format... I've only done it once to say that I have done it, and unless I see a chunk of massively high levels lining up I won't go near it as I hate wasting ammo, supplies and time.
---
Stealing of repair kits, I wish they would bring back the ones that repair things better than original...
---
They still can.... They didn't promise anything. Again, *literally* all they've done is change the formula. It's not a balance pass. Like I said before there still hasn't been a tuning pass.
---
If they don't put in a tuning pass then that's something to complain about.
---
Can you do my dailies?
---
He has same health regardless of 1 or 8 players, same as SBQ, they buffing effect of players is a myth.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing lol. Ffr doesn‚Äôt work on single shot weapons. It‚Äôs tried and tested.  On a lever realistically the second perk is trash. Explosive breaks sneak and the weapon to damn fast
---
Maybe Bethesda can make a special server just for u Bloodied builds where u can keep one hit killing everything while also complaining about lack of difficulty, Would u still feel special then?
---
Thats true bro
---
Strange how this has been posted like 6 times in the past hour.
---
I think OP means locking a room with the workbenches in it
---
The game already knows when you are in combat, or danger and caution for stealth purposes, so it should just suppress anything the obscures the screen during this time.
---
Damn...I thought I was doing ok till I ran out of .308 down hill after that.
---
I agree with that! Lol
---
I saw it at alpha. Thought it was pretty weird
---
Public team members cannot build in your camp, unless there's a setting I overlooked.
---
That‚Äôs totally cool with me man. You‚Äôre entitled to play however you‚Äôd like. 
---
However, I wanted to offer a secondary option for newer players who might me also worried about trading. 
---
I‚Äôm very sorry for hurting your feelings, but I feel like people have the right to know all their options. :)
---
I dont ever check reddit often I just come on here and post lol.
---
Yeah but the plushies are in shop tho üòÖ
---
It's like not being able to start encrypted if you're the one that use the card. Same thing.
---
Yea, it's a bit of a pirate republic. I guess they'd have a democratic veto or something. It also aligns nicely with stealing and raiding just as a source of income, instead of the blood eagles for example that use murder and conquest to sustain themselves.
---
TSE minigun will melt him in about 6 secs solo, if you have the magic armour piece. Otherwise it is a struggle.
---
Great work and poc, congrats!
---
At this point the tesla shouldnt even be in the game. It becomes literally unplayable in a very short time span.
---
I was quoting a movie, not calling you out! It's all good.
---
"lock the access to" ...
---
Disagree, Two Shot is garbage for snipers due to the wild inaccuracy of the second bullet.
---
So it's only those in a private team that can build in your camp?
---
Max caps......
---
From what my wife and I have noticed, yes
---
I don't use chems so I'm not really interested in any junkies weapons.
---
On PC you just edit the confs.
---
Macho man deathclaw. Just think about it
---
Also, just FYI for anyone. If your game freezes when you're exiting the mine to the appalacia and you have to restart, you WILL still get all the rewards.
---
I'd been holding my breath every time I got the load screen to take me back to the overworld since my game loves to crash during load screens and was worried when my nightmare was realized, but all's good and the items were in my inventory.
---
Invest in something to keep you alive more? If you're bloodied, perhaps a higher resting health at the cost of less damage output? (If you're dead, you're output is zero if you catch my drift...) 
---
Also are you getting burnt by randoms who have no fucking idea how to contribute to a group effort? It's fairly unnerving when people on this forum are posting shit like 'Level 286- launched my first nuke today! Wow!'....... 
---
Like... What the fuck have they been doing for the last 186 levels (that's being generous I know....) 
---
Seriously, for Earle if someone goes down people need to get the revive asap. One less gun in the fight equals more spawns per man and more ammo being burned.
---
Bethesda doesn't fix. Only make/break.
---
Also you aren't guaranteed any loot if you kill Earl, 5/6 times I got nothing at all, not even treasury notes...
---
That's good to know, next time I won't be so quick to be suspicious. Ty!
---
Im going to lay out *MY* camp any way i damn well please.
---
Sold one for 2k caps. Was it okay price or did i screw myself? ü§î
---
Sentry Bots already have a pretty advanced moveset for a boss fight: beef up its health and add some gimmick, and that would be a pretty sweet fight.
---
And I'd love a boss event versus a Power Armored human enemy. It'd be nice to have a high-tech faction of enemies in general.
---
It's what your'e playing on struggling to render and deal with all the action that causes the lag, they had to play with resolutions and frame rates to try and make it sort of playable on consoles, that's what took the time. The servers are capable.
---
&gt;The tech-claw. Half robot. Half death claw.
---
100% Beast
---
Thank you :)
---
Screwed up beyond recognition.
---
Yeah everything he said is garbage. What a joke. Just another Bethesda employee laughing his ass off all the way to bank while we keep playing their broken ass game. Even if they actually did any of the balancing he‚Äôs talking about when do you think that‚Äôll be done? A year? Nah, too early. Two years? I wouldn‚Äôt count it. The games been out for two years now and it‚Äôs basically the same lmao
---
Well that sucks :(
---
Maybe a rouge BOS agent? He and a few other agents left and took a prototype version of a controllable liberty prime? Like before they know about it and they have just found some random blueprints. That'd be pretty cool
---
At least some dude banked :,)
---
They should also add a dead wendigo at the end that has all your missed loot.
---
They have the memorial in New Vegas for the ranger unification treaty between the NCR rangers and the Desert rangers. The statue of the desert ranger looks just like one of the Wasteland desert ranger guys so it does make sense.
---
COULD YOU IMAGINE you inv OP and he is the 8th player to join the event? Lmaoo
---
Yeah you screwed up.
---
This is correct public teams can only fast travel to your camp for free they cannot unlock doors or build at your camp unless you make a private team and add them your good.
---
And 3 perk points. It's why I have a penchant for weight reduction armors, 4/5 pieces of ammo weight reduction and you've got 80% reduction on an item class that can eat 5 points out of a build (bandolier and batteries included) or you could go weapon reduction and get back the points for bear arms, ordinance express (grenades get reduced as weapons) or whichever weapon class you choose, including being able to reduce the weight of those pesky rifles that weigh 24 lbs. 
---
Add in your preference of the chemist or food backpack and you can make weight management a worry of the past.
---
I got red.menace for 200 caps and a  45 tse 50.cal yesterday for 1500 and 58 magazines at 10 caps each, I will server hop for hours just shopping for stuff for my shop or I will buy up junk for my scrap box just to get rid of excess caps.
---
That clips through the ground and gets stuck under the map.
---
I thought it was going to be like Fallout New Vegas where if you go left at the start instead of right, there‚Äôs that mine just overrun with super high level death claws that you can‚Äôt pass as a deterrent from you going off storyline. So I avoided it at all costs until I was level 80 or so and was like ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs it?‚Äù
---
I would also like a...
---
"Fucking shit, AGAIN Bethesda?" emote for when an event glitches or my game crashes and I randomly exit, then re-enter a team.
---
The shake fist emoti is a good start though.
---
Not having to stress about challenges is rewarding enough for me.
---
All these newcomers make me nervous.
---
Could also spawn a bunch of little Davies that yell "It's slippy out, Yeah!"
---
The fancy pump action shotgun doesn't have a skin slot so you cannot use any skins on it.
---
Thank you! I'll give it a try!
---
There should be an event there where you can polymorph into a Deathclaw and chase down other players/ kill stuff for points kind of like Monster Mash but cooler.
---
Because of collectors or people who don‚Äôt want to grind the event.  RNG sucks sometimes and you‚Äôll never get said item(raven mask).  It‚Äôs always been like this, not sure why people get pissed about someone else‚Äôs trade.  The players that got good weapons for it, struck when the iron was hot, first 2 days.  Just wait until after the event!
---
God these posts are getting stale.
---
I have only had two chances to do the event and both were like this. Both failed ammo dumps. Got some screws out of it i guess.
---
Or since it's not your camp, the owner can do as they please.
---
It's amazing the number of posts of people telling others how they should setup their camps or give access to this or that like they're entitled to access anything at someone else's camp.
---
Obviously you've never played other games.  Assholes are universal, far more common elsewhere.
---
Thanks everyone for the replies I guess I was uneducated om the whole "pay the win" thing I was talking about. I'll give it a try, thanks for your time everyone!
---
Same here I put it down after the first two days when it came out until this week and have been totally digging it. Feels like a completely new game. Then BAM glitch you can't get past.
---
To balance damage and gameplay first, I would also rebalance Stealth. In its current state it's too dumbed down and linear. Everybody can stealth, even in Power Armor, which is just silly. And with the right combination of perks and equipment, you can be almost invisible all the time, basically tripling your damage. All those 10 seconds boss kills need perma-stealthed bloodied builds.
---
Balance would be better in the long run if ranged weapon classes catered directly to gameplay scenarios:
---
Heavy Weapons: what they are now is fine, but would insta-break stealth after first shot.
---
Auto: they are fine too, but should have a penalty to stealth. Long bursts should break stealth. It should be a balancing act. If you want to play stealthy, you need to shoot less.
---
Semi-auto: should get a bonus to increase the damage in critical hits, more catered to stealthy builds and getting comparable damage to auto guns because of the higher crits.
---
Pistols: should give a bonus to mobility. Less damage overall (as they are now) but should compensate that by increasing the players speed, jump, whatever.
---
Bow/Crosbow: the only perma-stealth weapons available.
---
I've heard you can, though I don't bother to do it myself.
---
Bethesda? Lie about the atom shop? They would *never*
---
Never!
---
If you only use the three perk cards you are losing very little actual damage, \~7%
---
if you use one strong buff (50%) on top of that you lose \~19%, which is a decent amount, but not that game breaking.
---
It's only the builds that stack all kinds of crazy buffs on top of buffs that lose a significant amount of damage, damage that they never should have been doing in the first place, and which has so horrifically warped everything else around itself.
---
Umm... there should be an FoV slider in the settings. We got that like a month or so after launch.
---
I am assuming you are in PA when the camera is shaking while sprinting?  Have you tried switching to the regular interface?
---
I haven‚Äôt touched it since the first day it came out.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize they had already reworked it. I know it isn‚Äôt perfect and they really need an option in between 1x and 10x but other than that it is not bad for bulk changing ammo.
---
Maybe they just make a slider that is 1x-100x and you can pick in single increments? That way we would spend a little time sliding to our number but in the long run it would be faster.
---
I dont use mine I get so much ammo from playing the game and the raider ammo machine i just dump thousands of rounds i dont bother selling outside  my shop.
---
Well some of us can't do the DPS required but can help take out the spawns. I'm a sneaky sniper build so I usually try crippling the legs of the windingos and get them down to almost dead and then concentrate on Earl. This way other people can finish them off and then everyone gets the XP. I did two events yesterday and I'd say 80% of my time was on the spawns.
---
With that said it should be more like the scorchbeast queen fight and you don't get anything unless you do enough damage.
---
Imagine if there were numerous end game bosses that all had different methods required to defeat it. That would be nice. Instead of wait for the queen to land and kill. Or even an instance to "build your own vault". I'd take anything to heavily increase the continuous playability of the game.
---
To top it off, the one I participated in last night had a bunch of people just hanging out in the room up top waiting. Inside the mine still where you respawn if you die. Assuming they died and just hid out up there rather than jumping back down. Was a fail obviously with only a few actually going at Earl.
---
Don‚Äôt give the devs an idea for a new boss event till they fix the stuff pissing people off about colossal problem.
---
But seriously should be able to drop a nuke on it and get a stupid strong legendary deathclaw just cause why not have a boss based around one of the most iconic enemies.
---
Yea I got the same 60 unopened packs. No idea how.
---
I'm absolutely with you on this. I'm holding on a wait and see approach before weighing in too much with my own professional opinion. Fully expecting another part of this to come in, given they haven't really redone or worked on much else outside of base damage calculation. 
---
I also wouldn't call people dumb for their opinions on it, just either uninformed or under informed in how some of the changes they call for will actually work. Like most "why don't they just..." posts, the answer is: Because it would be either way too difficult or would not work.
---
Perfect, ty :)
---
 Team up coming out of the vault (building, for intelligence (xp) boost). By the time you get to the overseers camp, you are close. A few things and you are done in 10-15 min. BS way to do it, but....
---
This x 1000
---
I found it amusing that siding with the raiders actually hurts their long term plans due to all the in fighting.
---
I haven't logged on for more than half an hour at a time since. 
---
Of course, Bethesda reads this and sees "dailies were the only thing keeping that man playing!"
---
I tried to use it, but the ui is abysmal...
---
The Queen. It's just a big ol server get-together and you get your stuff repaired for free along with some flux for your effort. I don't think she's a bullet sponge at all. 
---
I found Earle painful and frantic. Can't say even once familiar with it that I'll launch my own nuke to do it. I'd rather do SBQ if I'm investing the time as I don't want to get fucked by a terrible group.
---
What does the cursed part mean? I just got the cursed shovel.
---
I was incredibly lucky to have got the meat tenderizer plan on the very first attempt... With the amount of fasnachts I had to do to get the bonfire I had to pinch myself a bit. Second attempt got me the spicy mod for it... Not usually that lucky but for once, I'll take it!
---
When a nuke is launched and there‚Äôs ten seconds left, hover over back water mine and join. The seconds it shows up

It's 10 caps to use my toilet
---
Wrong place
---
Just trying to bring awareness to Bethesda.
---
Of course :) everyone benefits from it like a free lunch
---
This is more or less a foundation for that. Like you said, right now they are evening the curve to remove some of the broken overpowered shit. Since they are modifying what damage things should be doing, what they should also be doing is fixing all the damage bugs so that weapons actually deal the damage they're supposed to. And fix weapons that don't work at all. Maybe they could have done this in a different order, but it's still an important step and still badly needed in the stale grind we pretend substitutes for an end-game
---
Yeah, someone else today tried to blame the community for Bethesda's problems.
---
Didn't get any traction then either.

Find a bartering sub. This one doesn‚Äôt allow that.
---
my go to has been punch it in the face and tap my jetpack to avoid getting stopped and spit on. 
---
it works some of the most of the usually.
---
Usually the cultists around the mothman shop on the roofs have Gatling guns I usually get 1-2 at a time
---
While I get where your coming from and I know lots of people in the same boat here the reason people are upset is that some of us spent literal months rerolling weapons and armor. It took me 6 months playing everyday for 3 hours to perfect my build and roll my bloodied faster fire rate 15% vats and all my unyielding/bolstering secret service armor. Yes it‚Äôs stupid to be upset about a nerf I get that but at the same time most people spent lots of time and effort and caps to make their build happen.
---
this thing looks even more menacing than a glowing one...
---
Yeah , "pvp". *proceeds to use Tesla or legacy or VATS gun with 1000 quantums against a guy not built for pvp.
---
I get workshops are pvp zones, but that is what it is in adventure,  just spamming and not aiming yet shooting. At least in NW(mind you it isn't perfect), I have a fighting chance people don't run around with all that bullshit. I don't care if a guy or girl wins in nw, as long as it is fair
---
Well it works on my PC in silky smooth 60 fps
---
Stay in sneak mode! I've not died once yet in the event!
---
Well, currently Bloodied still does the most damage, but bloodied melee isn‚Äôt what it used to be. junkies is still ne t highest.
---
I believe people are going to need to experiment with the legendary perk cards as well...a lot more in play now, which can affect a variety of builds.
---
The majority of your post is irrelevant, however, people are entitled to feel how they want, they bought and play the game for their own reasons. If a change effects their enjoyment then of course they are going to say something.
---
Caps for craps!
---
Can confirm; bloodied build here who started doing this when I got tired of dying so often the respawn timer would get so long I‚Äôd lose out of looting the dead Earl
---
if thats the plan, then its impossible that this change makes it into the next patch, they dont have time to make the massive amount of tweaks to buffs and base damage its going to take to make this change viable.
---
releasing an incomplete balance pass would be asinine, which unfortunately is something bethesda specializes in.
---
I have yet to see any ammo farm camp.  Are they mostly done on workshops?  I avoid workshops so that might be why I havnt see any.
---
And the only constant is change.
---
People have been talking about balance and changes to bloodied for literally a year and a half....it was coming at some point.
---
Bethesda: We have an announc...
---
This Sub: I HATE IT BOOO BROKEN SUCKS PAIN TRAGEDY WAAAAAA
---
Well level 50 is when you get max level weapons and have your special maxed out. But if your build and gear arnt good it doesn't matter what level you are
---
I like it when people lock their doors, but forget about the other ways to access an interior. I always leave a lootbag for them to let them know someone was there.
---
I like the idea of making it a more fearsome Deathclaw location -- but they could also make it a special nature reserve where the Deathclaw(s) that lives there are threatened by enemies and we have to defend them against the poachers.
---
Haha fair enough, was just asking because so far thats the only weirdness I have had with him. I wish I had footage of it, it was pretty hilarious.
---
I think a better change would be to up the damage on some builds and make it more balanced so that way people don‚Äôt have to be bloodied if they don‚Äôt want
---
Like come on guys...we need a "King of DeathClaws" that when it screams we get petrified leaving our body immobile in the middle of a bunch of adds !
---
No seriously, there's no reasons to not offer us a big ass "DeathClaw boss" with original environmental challenges like the "Scorched Beast Queen" and the "Collosus". This game needs it anyway.
---
And we need twisted challenges, this is what Fallout is, no !? Twisted...
---
Same. I'll use the photo mod glitch if I have to. I made a guy leave servers cuz I just kept phasing threw all his locked doors haha
---
That happens to me too. I just wiggle the stick every 10 minutes or so. I'm not full AFK, I'm just working and can't really play.
---
My mule level 47, kill super mutant warlord level 48 with 1 shot kill with my bloodied lever action rifle. To do that, you just need the right perk cards.
---
You got your own camp with free fast travel too right ?
---
BGS isn‚Äôt ever going to make things ‚Äúeasier,‚Äù damage won‚Äôt go up....and changing the damage modifiers to be additive will make it easier to calculate damage potential.
---
There around a million or more people playing that would be useless and a waste of time for something this small...
---
The dust hasn't settled yet, and there are still a lot of bugs with damage like with melee or energy weapons. Plus there could still be more changes before it all goes live, they've talked about exploring buffs and making adjustments. 
---
But Bloodied still has the most damage of any build, it's just the gap between Bloodied and everything else has been narrowed significantly.
---
What build are you using? I‚Äôve been using a shotgun build and have been killing everything pretty consistently.
---
Mine too,
---
I wish it was harder and more of them for sure.
---
I'll add to this that a TS cryolator freezes much faster than any other kind.
---
Because of the terribly low amount of damage a cryolator does regardless of prefix only TS and quad are of any use.
---
Between the pvp exploits voiding passive mode, and the crippling server lag, I agree that Beth should remove them from the game entirely.
---
Your not wrong the good thing is is bloodied is still the most powerful build I just think they could‚Äôve handled this a bit differently in my opinion
---
Is good to have freedom tho
---
Feeling the same however when Bethesda re-balance the wasteland maybe it will finally be a challenge again ? (It also wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add MORE deathclaws)
---
Put my camp on the cliff above there once when I was around level 10. Every time I spawned in it dropped me at the bottom of that cliff and that bastard would chase me until my camp turrets could help me out. Sometimes i wouldn‚Äôt make it
---
You need to hit level 50.  Makes a big difference for the weapons that drop.  (Besides the perk and build issues mentioned, which are also true.)
---
At about 60 you should have a perfect build if you're putting some thinking in it.
---
From that on is all about your gear.
---
Well, this change could have been made a long time ago...like when they nerfed TSE into the ground.
---
But, I‚Äôll say, I love the new Colossal Problem event, because I see bloodied players die like flies, while I sit in Earle‚Äôs face and kill him dead with my Vampire, high health build.
---
Higher damage numbers don‚Äôt mean a thing if you can‚Äôt stay alive.
---
Lol omg that would he hilarious!
---
It's a feature.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

It‚Äôs a server stability issue.
---
Got one today at the primal cuts event in ash heap
---
Idk how they‚Äôre dropping like flies if your good at being bloodied you don‚Äôt die a lot I‚Äôm bloodied and can kill the colossus easy lol why do you hate bloodied builds?
---
Not to be rude but did you just ask to put 2 more weeks on a wv tradition doesn't matter if its fallout Bethesda can't do that
---
I would prefer if you didn‚Äôt put words in my mouth.
---
I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhate‚Äù bloodied players. They have their uses. It‚Äôs just not my style.
---
And no game should have a single meta which is so unbalanced. This change is long overdue.
---
I don‚Äôt shoot him, because I am not a monster
---
And your statement is what we call the ‚ÄúNo True Scotsman‚Äù fallacy.
---
\--not leaving a stash outside because of the stupid lag and theft possibilities
---
\--workbenches are behind the a locked fireplace door only because stupid rabbits kept opening it when it wasn't locked, and I want to be able to see the fireplace, not just its edge.  There's no place else to put the workbenches, and I don't have camp budget to make more and put them outside for visitors.  I'm not willing to put them outside because I like being inside when I work on my stuff.  
---
Sorry.   I'm right outside Flatwoods and all I can say is that most of the benches are right there in that town.
---
I got two in a row.
---
 You do know that your chances don't increase the more you do it, it a fresh roll of the dice every time so to speak.
---
Same as 2 coin tosses don't guarantee a heads, you could get 15 tails in a row easily, it's still 50/50 chance though.
---
The game should‚Äôve came out with the balance one wasteland should‚Äôve been an at launch feature and bloodied is still the most powerful
---
it took them 2 years to make this change, it will take them another 2 years to actually make the tweaks and changes that this change in damage calculations will allow them to make.
---
bethesda isnt capable of making this broad of a change in any reasonable amount of time, they cant even fix bugs that have been in game since day one, they dont fix hacked guns or magic guns, they dont address legacies, but they want to balance the game in the most time consuming and tedious way. right, great idea.
---
they should have opted for damage hard caps on bosses, and a slow incremental targeted nerf for low health damage stacking. this nerf only deals will runaway damage at low health, it does nothing to address anything else or any other balance issues, in fact its going to make some issues even worse.
---
It's a cool down because of spam and lag early in the games life it couldn't even handle 3
---
I would argue that 100 caps is really not an excessive amount for players at cap limit and/or trade mules.
---
From what I've seen of the PTS with one Appalachia the deathclaw only scales to level 50 on the island.
---
And lol ok I was saying I don‚Äôt drop I‚Äôve watched full health and bloodied drop like flies in this event
---
Rng is rng...
---
Yes, and I wish I had a million dollars too....
---
And these changes will get tweaked substantially before release. Bloodied will still do more damage, but it won‚Äôt be 300% better than everything else.
---
Bloodied is still the best, while the difference in damage isn‚Äôt that much anymore, there‚Äôs still many other reasons to run a low health build.
---
And I have as well, but it forces bloodied players to reevaluate their play style a bit, having to deal with Earle and the constant Spawns too..all the stealth in the world doesn‚Äôt prevent the fear mechanism and running right into a drill.
---
Sorry if my post was provocative, You‚Äôre right, Hopefully the changes aren‚Äôt too detrimental to your fun.
---
Man, it's not the "one thing".   What about all the limits?  Caps, scrip, gold bullion?     For me personally, the limits are ruining it much more than other players.
---
If they can nerf Strangler Heart armor to the ground because it lagged queen fights, then yeah, they should really do something about Teslas. ACP turns to a pixelated mess when anyone uses Teslas.
---
for farming black titanium? Never.
---
More about the weapon and perks used than the level really, they stop at 50 so it's not about your character level, more your build and weapon choices.
---
But it's got to be nuked to open the cave entrance, you know, for reasons....
---
yeah screw all that chasing beeping officers around.  It's long enough as it is, clearing out a silo.
---
Awww... Got removed ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I play sneak vats rifleman too. The lever is ideal for this build because your critical meter will fill so every 3rd shot is a critical with only 1 pt in critical savvy.
---
But yeah VATS and gauss don't work well.
---
Pretty sure the XP he got from the event worked towards their level up.  Just sayin...
---
I am still missing the tato salad recipe. Got way more masks than outfits. I was able to get one of each tenderizer plan but the funny thing is I've run the event with 5 different characters and only my heavy gunner got all 4 tenderizer plans. So much for rng.
---
I stopped. Their rework was a slap more than a tickle. It should just let you select ammo from your stash and PROCESS IT IN BULK. One click, maybe two.
---
If I'm not mistaken, the dataminers don't calculate those numbers, they take them directly out of the game files. Not sure if they'd catch an extra condition (IF result==plan_tenderizer THEN RND(80%, REROLL)) if that's not in the tables they check, though.
---
I can feel your pain, I only got the plans to drop once yet, and I need it for all of my five characters.
---
True, You‚Äôre right
---
I've ran into three trap bases.   There were probably more, but if a camp has a certain look to it, I just leave.   I also don't go to underground camps any longer.
---
Question is does the light on the top work?  Or can you install a light mod?  I seen screen shots and it looks awesome.
---
I do drop off a big bag of them from time to time by the vault entrance for newbies to use.
---
No the gun is not modded, but I will now after reading comments. But yes rifleman and expert rifleman have been started.
---
Easy Aloy
---
That's just shit
---
thank you
---
or do away with the misc tab at all...
---
have you any piece of auto-stimpack armor? or similar perk card?
---
You got booted by a level 12
---
It is. People do it all the time. Only thing you have to be careful of is someone coming in and stealing it.
---
Eh. As I said, it‚Äôs what I use and garbage is a bit strong but predictable with this community. OP, take it with a grain of salt, but I prefer it over instigating because every shot is equal damage and the reload on lever action is quick.
---
I put on a piece of armor that automatically uses a stimpack at 20% health every 20 seconds and then decided to try out a bloodied build for the day. Took me a minute to figure out why I went through 100 stimpacks in like 20 mins üòÇ
---
I did this too. I whonder what the reward was for giving it to her
---
I want to start a new character just so I can properly do that quest. When I first came upon it, and realized the egg was in Deathclaw Island I said fuck that. I wasn‚Äôt looking to be killed by all those deathclaws. I didn‚Äôt even attempt to get to the island because I thought for sure I would tore apart in a matter of seconds.
---
Ahh so what you‚Äôre saying is you got a cursed drop.
---
Harpoon gun? Because that one doesn‚Äôt drop below 30 already (earliest heavy weapon is 20). I‚Äôll bet the shove and pickaxe can drop at lower levels
---
yes that i dont like either. Its one of the reasons i usually ask the people beforehand if they actually want to pvp. Sometimes i offer to use melee instead or somthing to make it more fair.
---
Woah...
---
I haven't even tried the event yet only being level 44 i know im not up to par on this account yet. 1 more level i get to use my BE lever n then ima try it.
---
Uses a special confusion attack by ranting at players about detonators even though they did the settler raid.

who gunned you down?

If u liked doing the dailies then just keep doing them?

I recently compared pictures with my Xbox one X and my freind playing on the normal Xbox. I couldn't belive how low the quality was comparatively. It actually runs in 4k sometimes on the X and has much better performance.

Makes sense

Here I sit all broken-hearted, spent 10 caps but only farted.  Yesterday I took a chance, saved the caps but shit my pants.
---
I didn't get most of the new plans and I've been active and/or present at +/- 30 events. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The good news is that we have another shot at it in a couple weeks (don't know the date off the top of my head).
---
Ah ok thx. I dont care if it gets stolen as long as monoga mine gets nuked
---
Heh, walk slightly north-east of Crater (north of the little raider overlook you can see from inside). I'll also point out, as the raiders do themselves in their ambient dialog, that there is no way to safely travel to Foundation and it's surrounds without risking a Deathclaw playing with your intestines. Remember the map is scaled down heavily. They are days and days of hiking through the Wasteland away from even Flatwoods, let alone getting into the Appalachian mountains.
---
Oh my gosh dude my comment was actually so dickish. I‚Äôm so sorry for missing that lol. 
---
My apologies for being a little hostile, and I wish you good travels friend!
---
Deathclaws pop out of the ground right? So make baby varients that attack like molerats, in packs and always from behind.
---
I have a quad gauss rifle with plus 10 percent while aiming. If I find a nook where the spawn can't get me I can vats earle and crit him for about 500 every 4 shots. Its not much but I do notice the bar move when I crit so I do feel as I'm making a dent.
---
Change it to Cazador island.
---
Always.
---
Moooooooooothmaaaaaaaaaaaan
---
Instigating I find is the best but anti-armor works well.  I can one shot most enemies with instigating and two shots with anti-armor. Of course I'm a sneak/sniper build.
---
Idk about you but suffering isn't something that comes with buzz brain
---
It‚Äôs not level as much as it is perks, weapons, mutations, etc
---
Is this really happening? And does it only work through stashes? Like many others, I leave a stash box and scrapbox next to my vendors so people feel safe that there aren't any traps and if they need to refer to their inventory before making a purchase they can do so. I'd hate to think I am putting my stashed weapons at risk for this consideration.
---
Fallout - Karen edition. America's bitchiest emerge from the vaults to complain to the management about their treatment, and insist they're never shopping there again.
---
they should change it up so you need the keys but don't have to figure them out this would add a extra layer of effort without the confusion 
---
at same time we need some permanently radioactive zones that will let people get flux without launching a nuke specially since nukes really push the lag up on a server and 3 nukes landing to quickly can crash servers sometimes still
---
Do u have more then one quest active?   I notice this happens when I have multiple quest active.
---
Like I‚Äôve said here before, I‚Äôve had the tenderizer plan since last November thanks to the spawn hack. Have fun farming lmao
---
Ugh - nobody warned me about that when trying out bloodied....    I pulled three great bloodied weapons from Mumbles and I already had a set of unyielding - I need to remove whichever piece has that effect
---
I am so excited for Halloween in the wastelands!! I wasn't playing previous years so this will be my first crack at getting all the awesome Halloween camp items. I am really looking forward to seeing what they come up with. üéÉüëª‚ò†Ô∏è
---
It's enough for me that it's happened in the past and Bethesda has a tendency to reintroduce bugs/glitches.
---
Wish I had an answer on that.
---
Fair enough
---
You're an idiot. I was literally running around on my level 18 alt, took a workshop, got killed by a high level player and he literally left me 150+ large Christmas gifts from the xmas event that were filled with caps, aids and everything else. Yeah toxic community alright.
---
Nope. The chances are the chances.
---
‚ÄúThe only constant is change‚Äù is a more fitting Tagline than ‚ÄúWar, War never changes‚Äù regarding Fallout.
---
PC, and I actually got on the last event I did before heading to bed lol.
---
not really in the PTS I've seen a lvl 29 be the mvp in the event since every enemy being lvl 29 for him he didn't take the same damage as the level 300-400s that were fighting there against max level enemies as such he was stimpaking the people going down while still fighting and helping out and only once did he get knocked down to a wendigo spawn and we managed to stim him before he died during the fight he revived over 14 players keeping them in the fight all the time killing wendigo spawn and covering us
---
But it's happening to THEM, therefore the odds are different.
---
I think you may have misread the OP or are for some reason assuming there will ***be*** a tuning pass. I should be logical to assume to. But I'll remind you what game we are playing here.
---
OP is if anything trying to encourage said tuning pass.
---
The thing is, all a flat damage reduction across the board does is make things artificially take longer to kill for literally no reason. I haven‚Äôt run bloodied for some time, but most of my chars are junkies builds now, and I find it rather annoying that my damage is going to be reduced, while at the same time ‚Äúlower level‚Äù mobs are going to be scaling to my level 400 and will take longer to kill.
---
How about a get "GET OF THAT FUCKING FENCE/TENT" emote.

No ennemy is a bullet spounge except world boss in the game, even in the actual state of the patch....

By level 35 we can get the Enforcer perk, and immediately after that I was able to solo the Whitesprings Gold Club in a nuke zone: it depends on your build, how you play, and your skill level, but most players seem to talk about settling on their build between 50-75
---
Earle was empty on my first run yesterday. That was frustrating considering how much ammo I filled him with and having gone through 2 repair kits.
---
is it because i'm high or does the helmet look a bit oddly dog-like from the front? like somebody's weirdly-drawn anime mecha dog oc but they made the nose too small.
---
&gt; **Will definitely be bringing all of the thoughts folks have been sharing here¬†on the damage bonus changes in the PTS¬†to the dev team. Will let you know what I hear back.** 
---
And if we get some tweaking that stop weapons (such as pistols) being utter trash after the update, then great, all is well. But it's not like we don't have reason to be sceptical. The PTS is two updates into it's Patch 22 tweaks and the silence on damage is deafening.
---
Hahaha 
---
I must be a senior citizen at 47 ü§ô
---
I traded my spare plan for an ultracite emergency protocol plan and a casual shielded underarmor plan, had another high karma trader come on my post saying I ripped myself off, whilst offering me 5 copies of a plan I already knew!
---
I think it ridiculous amounts they are moving for, I was just happy to get a couple of plans I didnt currently know.
---
My thought process was that meat week pt.2 is coming which will devaluing the plan even further and it's only a matter of time before another dupe surfaces and renders any worth the plan currently has as useless.
---
You have the same chances whether you do 0% of the work or 100%.
---
I don‚Äôt get it either tbh. I keep my camp locked up, but I don‚Äôt have a vendor either. I don‚Äôt want any of your grubby mitts touching my shit, and Daguerre is annoying enough as far as compaby goes. But if you have a vendor, I don‚Äôt get why you would then lock out the rest of your camp.
---
Lol 47 ain‚Äôt old, Age is meaningless when you‚Äôre awesome!

late reply:
---
I know the plural of anecdote is not data, but I have been playing with my friends and have literally counted to 12 straight 95% vats chance misses in a row.  On numerous occasions, it is not atypical to have 3 to 6 95% chance misses in a row.   In fact, we've adopted two new theorems of FO76:
---
1)  You're never over encumbered.  it is now called "normally encumbered."   the corollary to that is "health status normal" when diseased.
---
2)  once the chance to hit in vats exceeds 90%, it is now the chance to miss
---
but, you're right, probability is a thing, randomness is a thing and I firmly believe vats hit chances are plain bad code, not probability factor :)
---
Keep stealthy and you can bypass that and get straight to New Vegas.
---
Death claws with frickin laser beams attached to their heads
---
The kicker is that Bloodied and Junkies builds with certain weapons will still be able to oneshot that Legendary Moleminer in Uranium Fever. A headshot or even just a rapid emptying of a clip. Dead. It didn't stop them being the Meta Builds. It just cut everyone down, them a little harder, but they are still superior.
---
Ignoring that people can do whatever they like, there's actually a few good reasons to lock stuff;

1). If your doors are open, creatures can end up inside and target your generators/rad shower, which are costlier to repair. Locking the door stops this.
---
2). A pet peeve for lots of people is every door being left open. Locking them means this doesnt happen.
---
3). If people cant access work benches, it also means they arent going to sit idle at them. I had a guy sit in my camp for an hour. Everytime I went to check, he was using one of my benches. This wasnt a problem at the time, but would have been very annoying if I had actually needed to use them.
---
I leave all my doors unlocked - people can use any workbench they like. Wish they would shut the doors after themselves though
---
Hey i remeber you from the PTS forum,fellow gunslinger! Im Bones741 over there.
---
That would be a great idea actually.
---
Hold up, voiding passive mode?? What do you mean and should I be worried?
---
(Some guy shot me with a shotgun the other day and actually did slap damage to me... I thought they removed slap damage?)
---
People might say vanguard for full health, but you would be better off mixing effects like : 1x trouble shooter, 1x mutant slayer, 1x ghoul and so on.   
---
Its been proven the 15% dmg reduction is better then the vanguard scaling.   
---
Wear 1 of each or use the one for whatever gives u a hard time.   
---
My junkies uses 2x trouble, 2x mutant slayer, and 1x exterminator.
---
That's how RNG works
---
Nice to see you, it'll be interesting to see how it all goes, and the final community response.
---
How new and with what?
---
GET A MIC. Stop asking Bethesda to waste dev time making shitty emotes because you are too afraid to speak.
---
We have an event happening right now, that is a 5 star rating system so there will be a whole section with all possible ratings as well.
---
I also recommend sharing whatever rank of Team Medic under Charisma you can with the group. This way when anyone uses a stimpack, everyone gets healed by it for at least half with rank 1.
---
I've been slamming super stims these last few events and we have haf very few deaths with this perk up.
---
If this is intended as a building block going forward with more balances further along then it could be the start of a better experience, If it‚Äôs not, Then it‚Äôs just as you say unfortunately &amp;  completely agree with you then.
---
Yep. That's the same reason I decided to give it a try. I have some really great bloodied weapons that I would never scrip and have just been saving as trade fodder then decided to actually try them out. Gotta say, playing bloodied is so fun and crazy damage increase compared to my - not even sure what kind of build it is - strength/hoarder? Lol I can see why 90% of the people I see are bloodied. Even with the upcoming nerfs, I'm going to move some perks around and go bloodied full time.
---
There is an exploit with tesla rifles that make it so if tehey shoot the ground near you, it arcs to you and instantly kills you no matter what your resistances are. Its part of the same exploit that lets them "overcharge" the mag to hold 999.
---
Tbh, after getting the anti-materiel rifle in NV, and the gauss rifle in 3, they were one shot kills.
---
"I hope more people set up places like foundation"
---
Less durability but more damage
---
I've ran the numbers Jim, and it looks like we do 0% damage while dead.
---
only things i'm missing from the event are the spicy mod plan and the tato salad. Got way too many bloody chef outfits and brahmin grills though
---
Dome is cool.but you cant hang shit off the walls due to the curves.cant really put anything flat against the walls either.
---
I've fed that mooing fucker some of her feed at every cookout I've attended and still no tenderizer plan, so I'd say no
---
Could I join? My plasma is out so I'll probably just be reviving people
---
Nope, that's just how rng works :)
---
Ur joking right?
---
When there's a challenge to kill Deathclaws, people head there for an easy kill. I head there when I can't find one of the bastards anywhere else, as I try to leave that open for lower levels to take on.
---
I usually never lock my door so people can use my benches, but today the last three people who walked into my house, took one look at my rare mask display case, did the trade icon, and sent me a friend request. 
---
(It‚Äôs a thanksgiving display case that has all four rare Fasnacht masks, reclaimed deep mining helmet, and an urban scout mask. None of which are for sale... bout to lock my damn door so I quit getting friend requests asking to buy my rare stuff.)
---
If the mine has already been nuked/shows the blats zone, dropping a nuke anywhere triggers the event again, just FYI
---
I was level 4 when I was heading over to that island. And then the name popped up and I got highly irradiated as I swam around the island trying to check from all angles that it was safe.
---
So you get SBQ and Earle for 1 nuke :-)
---
Agh shite... Now I‚Äôm gonna be scared to be near anybody in a public lobby now. Tons of people at meat week and ACP use Tesla‚Äôs.
---
Not necessarily a level issue.  Finding the right weapon that matches your perks (and mutations) will go a long way.
---
If you are fighting glowing ghouls (nuke zones, or trying Radiation rumble), then the GlowSight3 perk will add a large percentage to your damage.
---
  If the majority of your perk points are in something other than PER, and you are using rifles, that's a perk/weapon mismatch - most rifles benefit from PER.  If you are using rifles and have the twisted muscles mutation, but do not have classfreak perk,  then you are taking a ballistic weapon accuracy hit.
---
  If you have one, a weapon with the ghoul slayers prefix will also help.
---
  I'm a melee built, STR maxed out, and use a ghoul slayer switchblade at RR and whitesprings.  It one hits L42s and 2-3 hits L62s.  Its a combination of the specialty weapon, the weapon matching my build (melee), the glowsight3 perk, and the twisted muscles mutation.
---
The scrapbox with infinite space doesn't cause issues?
---
Heard about that but thx. Also heared that you have only 4 minuntes for the queen if you do it that way and still want to fight earl
---
It's possible Chally hates her food and Grahm makes us feed it to her as a punishment like brussel sprouts to kids.
---
I feed it to her all the damn time and after 58 cookouts I still have not gotten the tenderizer plan to drop. I did get 2 of the weapon itself which is even more worthless than meat cleavers now so thanks Grahm for keeping that in the loot pool.
---
Somebody killed me at their camp last night while on his vendor.i didn't see how.didnt see punji boards or radiation I just died and then they did the ???emotes.came back little bit of junk was gone but they didn't respond to my pvp advances.is there  a way to instakill?
---
Yes my be assault rifle breaks A LOT üòÇ
---
But I do have a bffr Lever and bffr Hunting rifle and they Do shoot faster then without ffr from my testing. Ffr doesnt work on a mag size of 1...
---
I mean maybe I had a beer too much or sth, Not trying to fight here
---
I‚Äôve seen one of those a few different times...
---
But have you seen an irradiated Yao Guai before? It looks even more glowing than an actual glowing Yao Guai, it‚Äôs really cool.
---
Maybe I'm just a terrible cook
---
I have a mic. I was just reccomending it for the people who DONT have mics.
---
I think I only got 60 caps
---
Don't steal Earle's e he gets mad :
---
I disagree. I‚Äôve been enjoying the breeze on my udders in NW.
---
Nothing.  I'm mad I returned it bc she's kind of a whiner.
---
No. Because it only holds stackable items. It‚Äôs one line item in the database.
---
I saw this coming,  you have to be quick when you jump on the event.
---
Sidebar - how do you make the plasma caster good? I‚Äôm a heavy Pa Build and it sucks compared to my 50 cal and way worse than my prime 50 and prime Gatling
---
Light works
---
I had this problem about a month ago. I was trying to help out a low level player by giving them a few government requisitions and teaching them how to use them. They used one and got the marker for the drop, but the drop never came. We waited a good ten minutes before giving up on it. I thought that maybe they just had the drop glitch out on them, so I tried to do one. Again, got the marker but no drop. I then went to a private world and tried again from a different location. Same results. I tried a couple more times over the next two days and still wasn't getting drops. Hopefully Bethesda fixes the issue, because supply drops are helpful for low level players.
---
I got the tenderizer plan on a run where we barely made it to the drumstick.
---
&gt;how wrong the math was
---
But it wasn't very wrong at all.  You had the double score and the extra challenges that the early calculations didnt know would happen, and you only recently finished.  If those hadnt happened, we would indeed have had to do nearly all challenges to finish in time.
---
If you plan to do this during  CP it doesn‚Äôt work
---
Around lvl 45. Sneak single shot rifle build with lever action. Critical head shots do around 1600dmg.
---
Hulk-gaoi
---
The converter is such an overdue concept but the UI is so poorly executed that I usually can't be bothered with the thing. It tends to lock up on my screen and crash the whole game so I just don't bother.
---
No. Bethesda‚Äôs changes to team PvP made this trick no longer work for the non-wanted guy, and killed team PvP almost completely thanks to little vaginas like you who are afraid of their own shadow.
---
More likely a higher percentage of selfish children.....
---
Just saying.
---
I would love to have one of those bad boys at my CAMP.
---
AA won‚Äôt change the stats displayed on the boss lol
---
I think the issue is the number of unique items within the stash. In a database, there is no difference between 100 of an item and 10000 of it - the memory is already allocated, and the quantity doesn't matter (barring **huge** values).
---
If they give just extra stash storage, the number of unique instances goes up dramatically. You can already tell 800 lbs is pushing it with how much the game tanks in frame rates with a full stash box open. Now imagine that even worse with 1000 lbs of whatever random crap people pack in there.
---
I'm sure some sort of optimization could be done but as it stands now, it needs a lot of work on the back end to ensure stability.
---
For April fool's they should post the wrong codes
---
Primm Slimm, partner.
---
Have you tried a bloodied build?
---
Thrown weapons and melee should be perma stealth.
---
This should've been addressed by One Wasteland but it appears it hasn't.
---
Enjoy the relaxation
---
If you know it will get deleted for violating the sub‚Äôs rules, why did you post it?
---
There are other subs for bartering. Use those.
---
I have a quad pilgrim musket, it has to be reloaded 4 separate times, I think a dragon would be the same sadly.
---
Ooh dam ofcourse.. im so sorry üòÜ
---
Ive been online at reset time the last couple of days so they nearly all auto-completed.
---
No I missed out on all the loot kicked from the whole event with 28 seconds left. Also they got rid of the box. It‚Äôs still there but it does not drop the cursed weapons they added that to the loot pool when the event is finished.
---
Post of the Year material right here. Awesome.
---
It's nothing but Colossal posts on the front page.
---
And why are all the title [Descriptions] the same color? Makes it more difficult to glance at the list and pick out the posts you're looking for, it'd be better if they weren't there at all if they're goign to be the same color.
---
Why would you care about randoms? Besides, the dead body ragdolls are not synced serverside anyways.
---
September sometime I've heard don't have an exact date for you srry
---
I was going to write a response but realized after a sentence or two that i now care so little about the game that i cba to bother.
---
You should keep politics out of this even if your right
---
Sorry if I frustrated you, Not my intention.
---
I used the camp budget glitch to fix mine, which sucks for other people since they just patched it.
---
Hopefully it is. And I do think people are overreacting. These are PTS changes after all and may not make it to the live game.
---
Yes sire no logon all day. Don't  think I'll  be giving the next season so much  importance.
---
enjoy :)
---
I agree.  Instigating for Levers is superior to TS in every way.
---
It's not as bad as 1st. Great for dumping missiles, mini nukes and railway spikes into to lighten the stash.
---
It's not terrible to use. A few more variations on how much you can sell (10x, 25x etc) and it would be ok to use.
---
But a better design from the start would be better
---
This is whats happened to me - after weeks of logging on every day to do the challenges Im suddenly left without an obvious reason to log on. I could find something to do (collect junk or whatever), but instead Ive just to play other things while I wait for daily ops
---
Select their little yellow circle in the map and select "Fast Travel to" or whatever it says.
---
Haha that‚Äôs me dieing every minute.  TBF I am taking huge chunks of health off every swing.
---
I know, I know, honestly, the other subs arnt as nice, seem very straight to the point and a little brutal. I wouldn't dare post there.
---
Like I said, I understand if it gets deleted, I just thought I'd test my luck in a nice sub which I check out everyday.
---
I now make new character, it's currently level 12, and I gather experience via hunting ghouls on Whitesprings and burrows.
---
I only go to WS if there are players near who'd make them level 60. I don't want to waste ammo on level 9 that spawn for me normally 
---
I kill level 62 ghoul as a level 12 player with 4-5 hits. I literally solo golf club on this puny level.
---
I optimized it to full. It has BE pipe rifle level 10, he has all the mutations needed (and I can't radaway for next 20 levels because it'd remove them).
---
The answer is: you can shred from the very beginning if you do it optimally. Show us your build, let us clear it out and you'll be rocking too. Just pick a single niche. Don't try to make "sniper with melee backup" because it will suck both as sniper and as melee.
---
Things are too ammo spongey - I barely use the GMG as it is, with stuff having more health I‚Äôm struggling to see why I‚Äôd keep using it.
---
Are you at least a PA build? If not then you might be able to get a refund from Bethesda support
---
Not sure why you'd broadcast this.
---
Your argument is weak tbh. Thorpe was prewar too and was actually a raider.
---
Make 5 different characters. Non-specialized builds already suck, and will be even worse if the patch 22 damage nerfs happen.
---
For sure. Personally, I hit 100 yesterday, and coming home from work today, knowing I don't have to log in Fallout 76 to do chores today has alleviated my stress levels 1000%. I still may log in, but at least it will be because I want to, and not because I feel I need to.
---
Some people actually defend having these daily chores, and it is honestly beyond me, especially when better ways of implementing content are available. Ways that would benefit everyone, and ways that would make everyone happier.
---
Frankly dreading the next season. Might just skip it and take a break from this game if they don't change the way these challenges are offered.
---
Wow level 321and just learning this thanks! Granted I never grouped once till teams became a thing
---
Yes when I had one quest active it would show up but if I logged in and out it would just disappear
---
People find anything. "Oops I bought the wrong candy bar because it was next to my butterfingers...I demanded they have their own shelf."
---
Use a piece of legendary leg armor that has 15% blocking damage as a attribute and the shotgun will do really good damage. I was unknowingly do this and wondered why my shotgun did so much damage lol.
---
I lock my bedroom cause you can sleep on the other five beds I‚Äôve provided in a non locked area. And I lock two empty rooms with the jail cell doors to look like a personal prison.
---
Can we get this stickied please.
---
I just sold my spare fashnact plans for 50 caps each someone bought me out, normally people are cool and only buy what they need or 1 of each but this guy came in and bought 354 plans (including 27 mounted cat heads and such) leaving just 1 plan in my vendors.   
---
As for neon signs and letters you can get it from vendors for cheap, the spare halloween plans I have I don't sell for less than 5k.   
---
I won't be on the game for a while but I may have a spare brick building.
---
Everyone will be doing less damage. the dmg nerf is coming with one wasteland. His point is that when one wasteland comes it‚Äôs just going to be harder than it is now
---
Myself and a friend started the event, was joined by four sub 50 players who just hid away and left two of us to fight for a solid 20 mins only to fail as we couldn‚Äôt fight off the wendingos and attack Earle at the same time, when the timer got to around 2 minutes left they all quit. What‚Äôs the point? Earle had literally less than 10% health left! Just contribute or GTFO
---
It‚Äôs a nice sub when people follow the rules.
---
Apparently something like that, I believe we can expect an increase by winter when instanced camp inter' become a thing don't expect it to be much though, maybe up to 1000 but not much.
---
I moved over to Scotland and I miss butter fingers so much. I can still get them but they're pretty expensive and can't get king sized versions haha
---
The beauty of this model is that basically every single type of mob could have a boss level mob/event without any particular effort.  I mean, it seems that way...if you ignore the fact that it has taken them months to get one new event into the game and it's currently of questionable stability/quality...
---
I was today years old when I found out this exists. Thank you. Bless you.
---
People can quit for whatever reason they want to shut up
---
Yer im only level 28 thats why a keep a couple in my stash.
---
I actually don't mind the damage differential, just give my full health build the same XP as the bloodied and I'm good, lol.
---
They've never fixed a game before, I see no reason to believe they can/will in the future.
---
how does that work exactly? would that increase dmg output by 15%?
---
Make me dimwit üòÇ
---
8th at noon est is when it should end as the enemy ship will land on the goal that day.
---
I think this is a visual bug because when I joined a team to do this I can see them in the waiting area but they were calling for me from inside the mine. I had no clue they were in.
---
I think they have something like this on PTS... InnoSurvival's run down of the PTS changes showed a showed world events in the lower left hand corner of the map I think
---
Again, I'm sorry.
---
You can fast travel to teammates already in the instance if that happens and it will let you back in. I crashed last night and was able to get back in. It was pretty cool, I thought I wasn't going to get back in.
---
The Halloween and Fasnacht plans are pretty rare. Fasnacht being less rare since it just passed a few months ago. The brick plans can be obtained from the vendor at harpers ferry or from one of the vendors at Whitespring resort. Most players won‚Äôt stock these as these can obtained all the time and aren‚Äôt limited. The neon signs and letters are sold by grahm and the game price for them is about 11,000 caps (I think/ but this also means that players will sell them for way more than that so they can break even). The best way to get them is currently to served hop this Meat Week event while he‚Äôs consistently standing in the same spot as his inventory changes every time you see him. Point is: you‚Äôre probably gonna need more than 5k
---
Pretty sure you can request a refund on it but I‚Äôm not sure the requirements I‚Äôve never done it
---
It helps a lot, when asking this sort of question, if you post your build and gear.
---
Go to https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks and fill in your build, then copy paste the Web address back into this thread. Also tell us what gear you're using. Edit the info into your OP. 
---
You should be able to kill stuff without resorting to bloodied or junkies. But advice is hard to give when nobodies what you're currently doing.
---
A generic WTF emote might be more useful :)
---
Ive only done one and was a low level but not anymore so very pumped to see what new items theyll have!!  üëª‚ò†üëøüç¨
---
üòÅüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£
---
It‚Äôs a bug as far as I know. Angry turtle made a video about it
---
üòÇ
---
The kits from the SBQ fight repair to 160% already.
---
Isn't there a confirmation notice before you buy?
---
The only similarity this game has with WoW is that they're both video games. 
---
Can't really compare anything else from the 2, especially FO76 bosses since they are literally just bullet sponges. If anything the SBQ and Earle are more like a Destiny raid boss without any mechanics, just show up and shoot til its dead.
---
Oh wow, well atleast you're good for space and caps I guess!
---
58 cookouts here and no tenderizer plan yet. I'm absolutely certain the plan doesn't even exist (despite the fact that I have already traded for the plan and learned it). 
---
I have gotten at least 2 of every other 2.27% item so my rare drops are actually above average (15 vs 10.5 expected). RNG just has to be a little bitch when there is only one item you really want.
---
Thrown weapons... yes.  Melee on the other hand... I don't think it should. You are hacking away at something at arms reach and in front of you,  it should only be a one hit stealth, like heavy weapons. Also because melee damage is astronomical, it doesn't need stealth to be effective.
---
Sure, you can fast travel to people on your friends list the same way for free as well.
---
Whaaat really?? If they will do something like this it would really be awesome :)
---
&gt;In fact the event shouldn't even show up on the map for other players until the launcher has joined first.
---
Absolutely.
---
Launching the nuke should grant that player, and only that player, access to the mine. Only once they're in should the event start and be available for the rest of the server to join.
---
I wouldn't feel bad. She knew it could be dangerous or she would have went herself. Just think of all our fellow 76ers getting killed by this freak, lol.
---
It's possible that you meant to link something and did not do so?
---
It's a glitch. If you do this and it gets fixed you're fucked and back to square one.
---
There is. You have to click ***TWICE*** to make a purchase. 
---
OP seems to realize they had user error, though.
---
This whole change is unneeded, hopefully it gets scrapped, or changed like perk cards.
---
Non-legendary guns are already useless as it is, and now they're going to be even more shit.
---
underground :)
---
It‚Äôs fine. At least there‚Äôs something to say on yours. The next 2 posts is someone letting us know the finished the legendary run and another guy asking for the date when it‚Äôs posted everywhere all the time.
---
Indeed.  I'm just hoping Bethesda's version won't wreck it.
---
No no it‚Äôs all good brother everyone has opinions
---
Naw sucks since I farm up normal plans for newer players and I sell them all at 1 cap same with mounted plans 1c each. Fasnacht was face value since they were uncommon and rare plans I price accordingly and am stingy on putting in.
---
ya I linked the part of the video that shows it... I can only assume/hope all the world events show up down there
---
I'm pretty hyped for it myself.. sometimes its pretty easy to miss the event pop up notifications
---
He can use it for the time being to farm legendaries and build from there. But yes you are right
---
I only intended for discussion to take place, I‚Äôm deleting the post now as it‚Äôs drawing a lot of negativity which I understand, Hope to have more positive interactions with you all going forward though, Have a good day
---
People I've seen shoot down the supply runs  so maybe this is why you don't get it.
---
I'm one or two shotgun shots away (weekly, critical hits) from reaching 100. I was debating with myself taking a break or finally leveling up my second charater.  Then  A colossal Problem was released for me as a console player.  Gotta get on that train now as I have yet to finish it (2 failures).
---
Trust me, you dont! That a\^hole completely wrecked my camp the other day while i was at a mission.
---
It's not necessarily an issue with your level.
---
Fill out your build on https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks and post a link to it on this sub, along with your gear.
---
A lot of the time the right perks, gear and mutations are more important than the level.
---
You forgot the 50 posts bitching that noobs should not be allowed to try A Colossal Problem.
---
Need to log on myself today to get it finished the more steps to go for me. Then I'll have no excuse to start decorating.
---
That's awesome man, I had people like you help me when I first started.
---
What elements do you referred too? Other then having to buy gold bullion every day it isn‚Äôt much of a grind
---
Legendaries they'll have no clue what to do with because they've been using a glitch as a crutch.
---
Someone with the CSS tried fighting me, and they might not have had the red triangle but he still died to one quick burst from my FE90 GP, and I‚Äôm not even a heavy gunner build.
---
It isn't even strictly an NV thing. FO3 had that AND a much better ammo converter at The Pitt.
---
But doesn't the event pop up even if the drop zone was fissure site prime? I've seen videos showing nuking FSP will also start ACP
---
I didn‚Äôt find it exhausting. I‚Äôd make it fun. Like, if there was a take a picture challenge, I‚Äôd wait till I find a mob that was glitched frozen and work out sobs kind of pose with it. So now I have a bunch of hilarious pictures.
---
Sometimes me we my friends would equip any hat our outfit we found along the way. 
---
If it was kill X feral ghouls or scorched we‚Äôd make a game of tag. Go up to Morgantown and find as many ghouls in one spot. The goal would be to kill them fast enough so they never hit you. 
---
There‚Äôs lots of things people can do to make it less of a grind and more fun
---
Great shot!
---
Is your stash weight maxed?
---
Go to support and request a refund for accidental purchase, or just make up some glitches that the PA skin might have, they'll always refund you and you get to keep the item.
---
damage balancing and damage nerf is not the same and since I've been playing on the pts its made the game far more fun since I'm not killing enemies in 1-2 secs anymore and the enemies are hitting me hard enough I have to pay attention - at same time since its also percent based damage now that means hes hitting a lvl 29 enemy so hes doing the same percent of damage based off of a lvl 50 version of the same weapon in the hands of a lvl 50+ player
---
Vampire + fast fire rate.  I have a vampire gatling plasma that does a good job on SBs.  Higher  damage per hit than my vampire 50 cal.
---
Calibrated shocks for the legs.  Optimized servos on the chest (+2 STR).  If you spend a lot of time in the suit, targeting hud on the helmet.
---
While it has lower DR to other PAs, it is still quite serviceable in nuke zones, etc.
---
Excavators big bonus is its massive carry weight - I can push mine to a bit over 1800# and can still run (using AP).  Can't go that high in any other PA.
---
Bethesda said the seasons will be ten weeks long. That means 70 sets of Dailies and 10 sets of Weeklies.
---
Which means that the season should end on September 8th, 12 noon ET.
---
Your stash is full.
---
Oh I missed that, I‚Äôll definitely check it out now. 
---
And yes I agree, especially when you‚Äôre busy with another event. I hate it when I miss rad rumble while busy with other events or dailies. So the change would be quite welcome
---
I just had a lvl 10 and 18 with me at CP and thought it was awesome
---
Daguerre goes crazy finally from her headaches. You have to kill her before she drops a nuke from space onto your camp.
---
The lore were else would he go and I have connections to people who are In PTS he‚Äôs an old man who talks about the past a lot
---
What are the traders with the B2525 Fixers looking for? I need a B2525 badly.
---
so infinite ammo for regular box is possible
---
Yeah I'm having the same issue, and I've just acquired the perk. Git 2 levels of it, and notification icon appears, but MS doesn't. What a waste of 2 perk cards. Stupid bugged game.
---
I want my Deathclaw encounters to have more Fist of the North Star references.
---
I sold mine for 10k. I put it high thinking maybe someone would want to trade. Little did I know someone bought it in less then 10 min.
---
If they wanted to include it, but they won't - it's a handy "weight" item for them to limit our ability to stash in the regular box.
---
ok thx
---
IT'S NOT A CAP, IT'S A FLOORRRRRRRRR!!!!
---
Weighs 10.8 and and only 718/800 in my stash.
---
Yeah...no. 1 million stash weight mostly weapons and armor 100,000s of each junk. No server lag, no personal lag.  That was on my I am a bad guy account before it was banned ironically for camp building and not the 1000s of duped items, they didn't take kindly to camp builds that exceed 2200.   
---
I will say it makes a character difference though if you have long loading times it is past time to clear our useless notes and holotapes.
---
Sometimes the tweaked shows less damage, why is that?
---
You're just the bearer of bad news, arntcha Afb...
---
I like locking ppl in my rooms to see if they know you can walk through brick windows :)
---
But look at that face? How could you stay mad at that? 
---
Haha, nah, but I really wish the whole taming/pet system was less busted! I'd love to take this fella and move into the Forest and spook some folks.
---
And they can‚Äôt. Went down to &lt;1FPS because of that one person using a Tesla rifle.
---
Yea you‚Äôre right.
---
*cries in I‚Äôm lucky if I get 10 while nobody‚Äôs using a Tesla*
---
They‚Äôre not ‚Äúimpossible to read‚Äù
---
Joke‚Äôs on it, I‚Äôm already stupid.
---
Well that restores some faith. Thanks. I was pretty irritated thinking these people were just hiding up there leaving the rest of us to die and blow through ammo. üòÅ
---
Legacy.  Certain top end fixers like b3325 and v2525. Unyielding/van sent/ap armours. Top end gear basically
---
I can't even comprehend the people who afk at meat cook but don't go to a drum or spit.
---
Whenever I see anyone over 800 I think trap disarm exploit.
---
I suspect it's a rogue tent or camp.
---
I have noticed some similar stuff like:
---
* getting around 50% of my purveyor drops as explosive on a certain server. Changing characters and returning to same server continued to give loads more explosive weapons than usual.
---
* Getting the same group of prefixes in the same server. Not only purveyor drops but also drops from enemies.
---
* Same with getting more bloodied than usual. Also changing characters and still getting loads of bloodied drops on that server.
---
It might be pure RNG combined with the human mind that is great in finding patterns (even when there are none) but I'm inclined to say there is some truth in your statement.
---
Reload and try again.
---
Why not both?
---
Well... It says 50+ on SBQ. But everybody could do that one. And it says 40+ on Rad Rumble. But I was able so solo that, no scavs dead and level 2 with a level 28 character.
---
MSG me, I can be on later and you can look at my alt. GT stoicpanda1419
---
This is about colossal problem, which has already had plenty of problems for players. Read the room... and it‚Äôs definitely a damage nerf. Trying to play around with phrasing doesn‚Äôt change that.
---
If many ppl can‚Äôt finish it now, that problem will only get worse when all players have lower output.
---
Oh its gonna be small indeed
---
Mannequins are for sure gonna genocide level murder the budget bar
---
Yeah my friend had a BE25 lever and I had a BFfr 25. I lent him mine as I wasn‚Äôt issuing it and he said fires exactly the same rate. I assume reload works on it coz u fire one shot at a time with a lever but who knows. It‚Äôs Bethesda after all
---
One I was in last night had a level 35 melee in Excavator PA. Really helped me out with the wendigo spawns, which is what I was focusing on. 
---
Probably contributed more than my level 104 partial-bloodied build did ... seriously, Commando way better than Rifleman for this event. LOL.
---
Oooooh yeah
---
Swendsen, can you explain further? I'd like to check these games out too.
---
They might be again after one wasteland
---
What I want to know...did this stuff not come up on the test server? This just seems like an exceptionally big oversight to have.
---
A rogue Honeybeast. r/nocontext
---
I literally just said I didn‚Äôt play during double score and didn‚Äôt do any nuclear winter challenges. That basically means I was only completing one extra challenge every day, and I missed an ENTIRE WEEK OF CHALLENGES, including the weekly which more then negate those extra daily challenges. The math was wrong.
---
Stabbing someone is extremely quiet compared to any firearm with a suppressor.  Melee should be perma stealth should you opt into that build.
---
I would like to think it was made for somthing that was to be in the game. Maybe ot will be at some point
---
ooowwww, it is not yoga?
---
Yep if it‚Äôs not duped then the value will increase as they get used up. But the croc plan is heavily duped since the last weapons one and that‚Äôs not public yet so don‚Äôt expect fortunes from them
---
I have a BE25 lever. Do *not* try using it on the boss. Even my BE90 laser doesn‚Äôt do much against it. You should run Wendingo Cleaning duty.
---
The PTS is public, *everyone* has connections to people in it. Information is everywhere. Like I said, I follow the datamining discord and they have posted information from what‚Äôs in the PTS currently as well as what can be found in the game files. Moreno is nowhere to be found. Not to mention he wouldn‚Äôt be old yet - it has only been 8 years since Operation Touchdown.
---
I let the insult bots live, no idea why.
---
Do you have any weight reduction perks going? That messes me up all the time because it masks what things really weigh in stash.
---
Where was this at? lol
---
I will deff be useing them thiss week to launch my 1st nuke. It is the last quest both main and side that I need todo.
---
??????
---
No, you haven‚Äôt.
---
Not always but it did come not long after. Maybe a few weeks. For sure before it dropped the 2nd time
---
Same. I have everything but Salty. What the trade value in Bloody Chefs Hats?
---
I run fireproof because of my love for explosive weapons, but I still eat damage from the collapse circles if that's what your asking.
---
It may help somewhat as I do believe, based on the flames, that it is at least partially fire damage, but it will still eat you alive, and i have no idea exactly how much it helps if at all.
---
That‚Äôs how RNG works. And the data miners don‚Äôt calculate anything. They just pull the data right from the code.
---
Yes. But after the first stab... I would turn around and face my opponent, wouldn't you? Perma stealth in melee range makes no sense, it has nothing to do with sound.
---
Also try to use three pieces of armor with poison resistance.
---
I mean the events all around Appalachia
---
I was finally able to add it.  My stash numbers are off for some reason.
---
Yep, ive had that a few times .... searched but couldn't find anything.... failed the event . With or without tent or camp , didnt seam to make a difference.
---
The only one I haven‚Äôt had an issue with is the mire.
---
Well between me and my friends we are 0 out of 836 cookouts combined for the tenderizer plan.
---
It would have been great if you could save up the score you get after you're done for the next run. As a reward for finishing your legendary run earlier.
---
I seen't it!
---
Breaking stealth means everyone can detect you.  By your logic that should be the case with every weapon then but most especially all ballistic weapons.  Melee weapons are the least likely set of weapons to draw the attention of others.
---
Sorry? It‚Äôs not bad news, it‚Äôs just the news. With only 5k and not much for trade you can probably get some of the fasnacht plans from a player pretty easily as a lot of people afk farmed the crap out of it and it ran for two weeks. The Halloween plans may come back around this year so you‚Äôll have a chance to get them. The brick plans are always available and I think they‚Äôre around 1300 caps (sorry I don‚Äôt have all these prices memorized) it could be cheaper. I would definitely be checking Graham‚Äôs inventory every time you see him. He sells rare plans pretty cheap compared to what players are gonna sell for, the main exception is the neon signs and letters. Even if you complete all the possum challenges available you still have enough to buy one mod. That‚Äôs what makes the prices for backpack mods inflate.
---
Then my fully optimised PvP build will slaughter the PvE builds. They‚Äôre totally different animals, but I can still take down Earle with one other guy. Me and one other dude killed it with 3 seconds on the clock. I did about half the damage there, and ran clean-up/medic.
---
I cant believe only 8 people in a server can get in.  
---
There was an older nuke on the Colossus mine, so I nuked the SBQ to activate both.  We killed the queen fast, but I was still not let into a Colossal Problem.  Not sure what the rules are here, but it could use some clarification.  Only 8 people allowed into an event is no fun and needs to be reworked so the whole server can enjoy.
---
a giant bullet sponge STINGWING
---
that would be really tough and scary
---
Yes, my Junkies FFR gatling laser was still 'magical'. The health bar drops a little slower than when you use it on the queen, but you still have the 'magical' effect.
---
Would be awesome as a initial reference from The Institute, landing later as a DLC
---
If level 58 is low then that award actually goes to me. But I have a useful build and weapon loadout.
---
Damn, I gotta spend more time on my stealth build. I'm rocking shotgun and melee at the moment for a more close up build as I'm always the stealth sniper and it's super boring after X amount of games.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre like me but I just finished the run yesterday, then put out my mr jangles stein with the others, stared at my screen for a moment, then logged off. 
---
Haven‚Äôt been back on since. Might check out the colossal problem event to try and get that helmet and meat pile. Though my first go with it ended in a fail because earl kept leaving the map through the bloody ceiling!
---
He was gone for a while 10 minutes at one point!
---
That would be nice, I was with one friend and we both dropped the nuke. We both managed to get in but it split us up.
---
Last time I asked for a refund, they told me they will give me the refund but to be careful with future purchases because "this option might not always be available" üòÇ bet
---
They should have 3 confirmation windows!!! /s
---
Not sure, but it doesnt help with the douchepumps who wait outside and spawncamp people without rad protection.
---
There needs to be a quitting penalty too 
---
I had a bad squad just give up and quit half way and the people who didn‚Äôt leave didn‚Äôt notice till we failed the event. The worst part was earl was mutated and a sliver from dead. If people didn‚Äôt leave we would have completed it fine. I wasted all my ammo and throwables thanks guys.
---
The tesla rifle can do that even on Solo xD 
---
One time the game crashed on me because i used it in a swarm of Liberators
---
I've never failed a prime cuts that I've attended, but I also stopped attending them a few days ago.  That said, I've noticed that the honey beasts can spawn really far up that hills in that area, and just wander away quickly.  As they are out of range, they aren't getting tagged by the quest either, so they just kinda vanish.
---
My targeting hud pa often helps me see them as they scurry behind the trees.  
---
All of this said, I wouldn't doubt the possibility of them not spawning for some reason and the game just going, well they didnt kill all of them cause some dont exist yet, and then failing.
---
Why? Even with a year of fasnacht, you still won't get FATHER WINTER mask.
---
unless you can spare that kidney of course.
---
If a teammate or friend is in the mine you can fast travel to them after the marker has gone, right upto Earle falling over.
---
If by accounts you mean characters, then yes name is the same. If by accounts you mean true separate purchases of the game then no.
---
Thanks and just did exactly that.
---
IIRC, there are a couple of diseases that negatively affect ballistic weapons.  
---
Might check the status page on your pipboy.
---
A lot of people have spent a lot of time, effort, and scrip trying to get the optimal weapons and armor for their bloodied builds. If the devs hit the game too hard with the nerf hammer, it'll make everyone who spent weeks/months to get their gear very upset. Bloodied and junkies builds will probably be okay, but some players might get their play style nerfed to death. If what I hear is true, unarmed weapons and energy guns are getting hit really hard. Instead of nerfing they should boost the other abilities.
---
I'm exclusively melee, so I have no use for it.
---
I would assume he meant 25 faster fire rate and missed the keys.
---
That's said....
---
Life finds its way üëå
---
Awesome, thank you, I'll be on around 5pm UK time.
---
The numbers but not the calculation algorithm. We want to see the algorithm else we wouldn't believe it lol.
---
I feel like they fixed this at least with the propaganda posters the liberators drop. At least I haven't notice it pop up lately. I'm surprised they didn't think to extend the same fix to other similar items.
---
^^this, it's "take less damage while blocking effect" on armour and any shotgun become one shot kill in vats
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt understand how that gun as described exists.
---
Well, for a start, I would say that ballistic weapons would need a silencer to maintain stealth. No silencer, no stealth. 
---
Aside from that, you have to draw a line somewhere in a game. In this case, I would consider more realistic that a long range silenced weapon would keep stealth better because of the distance to the target makes you a harder to spot, than someone who's stabbing you in front of you face.
---
Of course, the ideal would be that one hit kills from melee range don't break stealth at all too.
---
also thought so at a stage.
---
My now 0 scrip proved it ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
---
I was only poking fun, I was hoping someone had the plans for a little cheaper, but I really appreciate you putting the time and effort in to reply to me, you're obviously very knowledgable, thank you.
---
Then... mine the data yourself?
---
so easy to make but bethesda doesnt like easy thinks :(
---
Ah sorry yes I meant characters, thanks for letting me know :)
---
My point is, if it‚Äôs something people want they don‚Äôt cate if it is duped, ie Red Asylum, Croc, B2525, Energy Explosive ect..  They did lose some value but not much, obviously.
---
I like GOLD! Gold bullion! I lost my slong in a smelting accident.
---
FIRE THE LASER!!!
---
Same over here, got over 20 Flamer and Shishkebab on 4 different characters, no Meat Tenderizer:(
---
&gt;I know it's frustrating right now that you're dealing less damage than before, but it opens up more possibilities in terms of balance for us going forward.
---
ye im not buying this bullshit
---
See that's interesting, because when my character's stash approaches 800 lbs of scrip and other items, I get a noticeable lag to input and a huge framerate drop. I've seen others complain about it too.
---
Silencers do not exist.  A gun with a suppressor would be heard hundreds of feet away.  If we are being realistic hitting someone repeatedly with a spiked bat or sledgehammer is going to be much quieter than any gun.  You could get your throat slashed without people hearing it half a block away.  If I shot a suppressed rifle everyone on the block would hear it.
---
It is! Seems to be flying under the radar a bit, I only noticed because they sent me my crowdfunding keys.
---
I find that it is somewhat specific to the location of the horde.
---
I'm looking forward to the damage re balance
---
I would definitely have stopped reviving that asshat
---
When one wasteland comes out it will level up more. I don‚Äôt think it will be level 100s but they said higher levels.
---
Nah I imagined that place was like the high level area in new vegas. I was sure once I stepped on that island I would be swarmed with lower level deathclaws (because it's in the low level area for whatever reason). But nope. It was cool the first time because he was my level. Now it functions more or less as a free deathclaw kill when I need it for a challenge or whatever.
---
You don't get it yet.
---
Probably. That‚Äôs my thought as well.
---
There's the Brotherhood Spec Ops Outfit coming with the next build, I think you may like it.
---
All I need to hear is labyrinth! A maze! With an unstoppable deathclaw called ‚ÄúBIG DADDY‚Äù that you don‚Äôt want to come across.
---
Dying from the fall down the shaft is a pro move üòÇ
---
Still not possible. Those are both secondary effects. 
---
Possibly meant crit full or reload speed.
---
You have a custom paint job in it?
---
I got the tenderizer at last years event.   Don't recall if it was the just the weapon itself or the plan.
---
This year, RNG wasn't particularly friendly to me, so I ended up taking advantage of excess caps and someone elses luck.  
---
Bought the grill plan, peppered mod plan, and chally suit plan from a player vendor.
---
Doesn‚Äôt need to be higher level per se, but just more body count to make it interesting.  The ai literally just stand there not even shooting most of the time in those beginning spots
---
I'm Bloodied Melee using multiple foods, I've held my own against Earle 3 times now, I've been downed, sure, but as long as everyone is pulling their weight, who cares?
---
Yes, but first I have to crack the PS4 OS...        Just kidding Sony;)
---
For any new player tho it‚Äôs pretty well done tho.
---
I remember the first time I discovered it. Huh deathclaw island?       !
---
Sorry to dig this two weeks old thread, but can you please link where they say this? I've been looking all over their twitters and the Nukacrypt Devtracker going back to the beginning of the Run, and I haven't found an official statement about this issue.
---
wow
---
Bloodied will be still the top tier build. Unarmed weapons in general will be almost useless. I tried one handed weapons and it will be playable (tested with bloodied faster swing bowie knife), two handed weapons will be also very useful.
---
They need to fix them. Badly. Or remove them... Either is acceptable.
---
Those need to be classified as retired posts in my opinion. 
---
But until they are, they don‚Äôt technically break the rules. 
---
I hate seeing someone get booted that seems to be a decent person.
---
Ooh yeah I have seen that one. Looks really nice
---
I was in there with a 78 last night and felt utterly useless. I won‚Äôt be participating again until I‚Äôm a higher level. Or I‚Äôll use my higher level. But yeah... oof for me. That was tough.
---
What got removed?
---
There should be... a friendly deathclaw? deathclaw mommy that ignores you until you start looting her nest?
---
...and a way to drop her some meat to eat while she guards her eggs?
---
...friendship is magic, guys ;-)
---
Seeing all the lvl 300+ bloodied builds on their knees flailing their arms in the air every 30 seconds is kinda funny. I've played it half dozen times on my lvl 52 and haven't died once, very satisfying.
---
only if you are at least semi minimaxed end game player if you are not hf wasting shit ton of bullets
---
Maybe they are trying to hide a resource like a lead.deposit. 
---
Nothing more annoying then not being able find a world where your camp will drop.
---
Whatever it is, it will need nerfed the next go around until nocturnal is king, wait that will need nerfed too, so ghouls slayers it is!
---
You should pick one weapon type to build around instead of shotguns and rifles. You also don't have 3 of the most important damage cards you can have: bloody mess in luck gives you 15% damage, tenderizer in charisma boosts all your damage when you start attacking and adrenaline in agility is the best damage card which increases your damage per kill. Also if you use vats go for gun Fu in agility - extra 10% damage per kill as it swaps target in vats.
---
It's not everyone's cup of tea, but stealth is also a massive damage boost if you spec for it with covert operative.
---
Good luck.
---
Yeah he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten one revive from me.  It‚Äôs not everyone else‚Äôs fault he‚Äôs terrible at his build.   I‚Äôm bloodied and tank very easily.  Plus isn‚Äôt food builds used to describe non pvp people?   What‚Äôs that gotta do with ACP?
---
Somehow even worse than the original when we could just space-tab-space-tab.  Now I only use it when I can convert 10x to ammo points.  If it could create ultracite ammo, even at a very high cost, it'd get a LOT more usage.  Farming fluorescent flux for .308 ammo is a pain when everyone's nuking Earl.
---
People keep saying this type of thing to me about legit builds being way more powerful than mine could ever dream of being.
---
I know Bloodied is really good, but sticking with my Rifleman/Commando build, even Bloodied I deal nowhere near enough damage to kill Earle within 5 minutes. When I'm the only person attacking him, I can't even be sure his health bar is moving at all. 
---
Are heavy guns really that much better than Commando? Are you all stacking 5 tiers of chems and food buffs? What the heck am I missing that people think Earle is so easy to solo?
---
I would use chems and food more often, but for me that has two problems. One is they never last long enough to help me for the whole fight, and two is I'm missing the crucial recipes I would need to make using consumables sustainable (Ballistic Bock is rare, the Psychotats recipe doesn't exist, etc).
---
I'm gonna do it until I get all the rewards and then only every once in a while after that. Since it doesn't give repair kits as a reward it won't be worth doing it after that to me.
---
I always shoot them but I never loot them.
---
Lever Action : "The Duke" after John Wayne
---
Gatlin: "Dean of Green".
---
Yes.   This happens all the time.    Very annoying.
---
If anything, I think some of us who are running stealth rifleman without bloodied/junkie's are looking at it like we will have no choice but to choose one now.   If my damage really drops to 1/3 of where it is now that's like knocking me back to level 70 with a food build and no legendaries to speak of.
---
Why am I still laughing at this.
---
It‚Äôs amazing to me because the keyring is a much smarter programming implementation than individual keys. Oh you have Miners Lockbox key? That value is now 1 on the keyring opposed to adding the key into your inventory with an icon, name and description.
---
the 2 things I have found that affect performance are any camp over 175% budget which increases load time and produces some lag and for some reason holotapes and notes again load times.   
---
In my stash prior to this week I had 300 unique plans now that I am down to 100ish I noticed load times were better when fast traveling and the time for the stash to open. I am at max weight stuffed with 1 star meat week legendaries now.   
---
For me however I do not suffer the FPS issues but just load time lag. I should test with clothing I suppose I do have 200 treasure hats and insurgent outfits already made up for sale to see if those are also playing a role. Though with my plan count so low now I am not suffering issues any more.   
---
Maybe it would be wiser for them to cap line count and have the stash have an unlimited weight then?
---
Heres another: use a vampires weap on trash mobs, save dps for boss
---
Could be, but in my experience that isn't much of a factor.
---
I started blaming it on all those mounted plans. Every time I toss them someone drops them for me to take. Like bro I‚Äôm over level 200, I know every mounted plan, I don‚Äôt need to see them ever again.
---
Narration: In the harsh wasteland, everyone is out for their own, days of the heroes are long gone.
---
Level 300 guy: hold my desk fan.
---
I traded a fixer plan for my tenderizer plan and then last night after forty outfits in a row I got another tenderizer plan to drop
---
You get it in the next major update.
---
indeed, that would have been perfect!
---
You're trying to mix and match weapons which really doesn't work. You need to focus on one type and utilise luck, agilty and charisma perks as well as base weapon perks.
---
I went to 40% health in PA, so this would not happen.  I had lvl 50 in excavator, that kept dying, stim‚Äôd 4 times after that, he died over and over again.  I would except the same if It was me.
---
It was awesome !
---
I'm bloodied and high health builds are under appreciated. There are many changes I would like to see for their legendary prefixes to give them  better enjoyment
---
That says more about your experience.
---
That‚Äôs the thing though with a colossal problem is it‚Äôs 8 person instances. Having some AFK ppl or people doing extremely poor damage will hurt the chance of Earle dying.
---
Did it several times last night, all one star drops. Bethesda fixed (nerfed) the loot quickly.
---
Posting your build certainly helps. 
---
OK, I'd either go commando or shotgun. Specialisation helps free up perk points. I also see you have a lot of quality of life perks, that don't really do much. Everything you have in endurance can come off. As well as travelling pharmacy and thru hiker. Scrap often and carry less crap? Heh.
---
OK, skills you should take. I like shotguns, and I think you prefer them to rifles. Concentrated fire and skeetshooter in perception. Get them VATs-headshots in. Scattershot in strength might be good for you too, as you clearly like reducing weight and you'd benefit from the quicker reload time on shotguns.Enforcer of course in agility. 
---
I've added some agility perk suggestions, because I love VATs gunning everything in the face, if I'm using a non-auto weapon.
---
The last thing I'd suggest is Barbarian. A high strength would give you a lot of extra resist and staying power.
---
So, without editing your special stats much, maybe check something like this?
---

What gun do u recomend
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and got some keycards and run silos for events . Join me if ya want. BalboaTheRock
---
I was minding my own business walking around the meat cook area when some guy hit me so i killed him and he seeked revenge and i kept killing so he messaged me calling me a food build and that im trash since he couldnt kill even tho he had a legacy and i told him that calling me a food build doesnt bother me he then had a meltdown over it so i blocked him.
---
Hi all, we are going to get this fixed up as soon as we can. I also wanted to confirm that this is a visual issue. The legendary attributes are not actually being removed from the weapon, they just aren't being displayed in the UI while the skin is applied. Thanks for the reports, and apologies for any confusion this bug is causing.
---
I'm at 99 with at least 4 of the Weekly's left.  I can't wait to be done today. I've been jumping on after work, knocking out the dailies then playing Horizon Zero Dawn.  76 has made finding time to play it impossible.
---
Would be much nicer if it gave repair kits haha
---
I have a bloody 50 cal as well
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crap. I still need two mods for the tenderizer and Tato salad. I traded a fixer plan for my tenderizer plan then last night after getting about 40 of each outfit I got another tenderizer plan

Fuck RNG, I want my Meat Tenderizer plan so I can have my 0,0000227 chance roll on BSS+S at the Purveyor:/ ha!
---
This should be higher.  Maybe they'll have a round of weapon tweaks with the additive system in place on the pts before they go live with it.  Hopefully that's their plan and the changes stay on the PTS until then.  
---
As apprehensive as I am, it makes sense that they can't tweak weapons before they change to additive because they'd just have to do it again after the change.
---
I mean their problem is they didn‚Äôt go into areas that they shouldn‚Äôt have and get their asses kicked. Before level 30 was the most challenging time bc I didn‚Äôt stay in the forest past level 10.
---
Because it probably scales to the amount of people there, obviously someone can solo it if they‚Äôre by themselves but if there‚Äôs 16 people in the event and only 3 are actually putting in work then you‚Äôre gonna have horrible time since it‚Äôs difficulty increases to 16 people

Agreed... its freeing.  I thought I would stop playing but honestly its refreshing logging in without a bunch of chores to do.  
---
This combined with meat week and primal cuts giving us so many tickets, I dont even need to do the faction daily quests.   Back to just being a wasteland wanderer and enjoying it.
---
Well, I‚Äôd like to introduce you to One Wasteland - a new rebalance of the map where everything around each player scales to them. A level 200 player would see a high level deathclaw there, and receive and take damage as such, and a level 5 would see a lower level one, and receive and take damage as such. This will be coming this year.
---
Maybe it will scale better with One Wasteland?
---
In the current PTS everything in the Forest, Ash Heap, and Toxic Valley scales up to 50. It's great, Grafton Steel may be the new West-Tek
---
Xbox user here, haven't had any of these issues you describe above. You don't state what weapon you're using, or it's effects, or perk loadout.
---
I have been using Fancy Pump shotgun and Anti armor shotguns, using shotgunner perks, gun fu, grim reaper's sprint, and four leaf clover. I manage to push through some fairly sizable mobs without having to retreat too often. No graphical issues like the ones you note either.
---
A BFFR handmade is a good choice, but you‚Äôd need a commando build for that. Running spawn clearance is still useful though. Alternatively a Bloodied or Junkies heavy weapon will do good damage with a good build, but legacies seem to be useless. He has a lot of explosive resistance. BFFR/JFFR is best if you have it, but Vampires is an acceptable choice if you run low health, want to stay alive, and run adrenal reaction.
---
Damn that‚Äôs fast
---
That ain‚Äôt too shabby, you can get good DPS outta that.
---
I actually put on Revenant (and a full set of Life Saving Solar Armor) and fall down the shaft for the 50% damage boost ‚ò†
---
Move your CAMP 3D printer around to adjust your spawn point.
---
We definitely need more wasteland outfits (mad max styles) and hairstyles.
---
For the costumes...I don't mind so much around festivals, I think of it as people cutting loose and going a bit nuts at a chance to take a break from the nightmare of day to day life.
---
When I see the costumes after the events...well some people have obviously snapped under the strain and went crazy wearing the funny suits and masks all the time. I'll put on an outfit or mask when the event when I'm participating, but in between those it's back to the usual gear.
---
My favourite outfits have been hunters coat, fashionable raiders outfit, treasure hunters outfit, insurgent outfit (I think it's called). But those are all so impossibly rare to find.
---
My other character (Officer Friendly) wears a responder police outfit and campaign hat...bringing justice to the wasteland.
---
There are a lot of great outfits that are more common - the drifters outfit is great, scribe outfit...but we definitely need more of the mad max style of raider outfits.
---
The purpose of the bs is to keep us calm and hopeful while they blanket nerf everything.
---
Yessss lol
---
I wish I could lock my benches. I would too. Just to fuck with people. Make it a crime to craft or repair their shit at my camp.
---
did it twice yesterday on my bloodied char, first time i downed 2 times or so, second time no probs, easy peasy... the build is good, its just the operator that needs to get to the lvl
---
Slick! From sounds of this tale the playa in question didnt mean to hehe
---
That‚Äôs really not... If one of us died once more than we did, or focused on the spawns for three more seconds, or even if we spent that tiny bit longer in cover, we would get no loot. The event would have failed while he had a tiny shred of health left.
---
Oh yeah, apologies, I misread that and thought you said you only did the first one.  But still, no, the math wasn't badly off.
---
There was many extra challenges.  There were two double score weekends.  There was a double xp weekend.  There was meat week, which got me the final two ranks (the costliest two ranks) just from doing easy and frequent events.  None of that was known about at the time.
---
I've done (nearly) all those extra challenges, got all the double scores, got the two hardest ranks from meat week, and only just finished very recently. Judging by other posts throughout here, that is very far from an unusual position.  Without all those, there is absolutely no question that I would still have at least one week ahead of me.
---
It's nice if you've been ahead of that curve.  But that *was* the curve.
---
Very cool, very neat. But please don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to have a *time left* counter on it that has been requested many times!
---
So that would explain why I can just approach them and talk to them. Some of them are kind as hell( despite the fact they're raiders). Hey herea a comic book I live enjoy the read. Or hey. I love sharing my recipes with people, so heres a recipe, enjoy. 
---
People may see them as weak. But I see em as humans trying to cope with post war Appalachia
---
I‚Äôm camped up literally on the edge of the water on Site Alpha. Got a sick view of Appalachia but EVERY TIME I fast travel in I have a Yao Guai attacking my camps. I eventually put up a wall of 6 turrets facing Site Alpha to kill it before the can get to my walls.
---
A level cap isn't going to resolve the issue. The issue is you need specific builds (junkie or bloody) or "magic" weapons in order to output enough damage to be effective in the Colossal Problem. 
---
So really there should be a warning saying "Read Reddit before attempting.", as many people can one/two shotting through 99% of this game and still not be outputting enough damage to deal with the bullet sponge that is Earl.
---
Meg's chief concern is the survival of her crew. If you tell her about Lucky Lou's suicide attempt, she will personally go out of her way to console him and discourage him from suicide. When you help Gail and Ra Ra, she applauds your efforts, mentioning that she has a soft spot for children. And with Johnny, we know that Meg may have intimate feelings for him. However, Meg also understands the needs for talent and skill in Crater. In her eyes, discrimination is a bad policy to have in the wasteland. In addition to being morally wrong, discrimination denies Crater potential talent, and Meg acknowledges that fact.
---
That being said, she is not perfect, and that adds to her character. She tries to fight the Scorched Plague through brute force, just as the Brotherhood did, and fails. She has individuals in Crater who express doubts in Meg and her plans in Appalachia, and this is normal. There is no law in America anymore, and no mighty Raider government backing Meg. She is leader, but only so long as she has the confidence of the Raiders.
---
It's hard to critically examine Paige and Foundation, because Bethesda clearly designed them as the obvious good guy choice. Everyone loves Foundation, and everyone seems to follow Paige and Ward without question. They don't really have any nuances about them, like the NCR, the Followers of the Apocalypse, or the Minutemen. They are just good guys, because Bethesda needed them to be.
---
im not sure if they are aware that nerfing things in pve games makes people quit :V this game have a big chance of dying after the nerfs go live...
---
I have bird bones and reduced fall damage
---
Bummer, that is too early for me. The earliest I will likely be on is 11PM UK time.
---
Oh that‚Äôs freaking awesome. Can‚Äôt wait for that, I don‚Äôt even bother going over to most of those places because there‚Äôs no point except junk items
---
I have no idea. All I know is that this game has had an influx of clowns.
---
They either bitch at your for not being a min/maxer or follow you all across the map, spamming the trade emote.
---
Very much this! Stay in the forest until about 10. Then move on to ash heap ortoxic valley
---
That only helps when others have mics and are in area chat.  I tend to avoid area chat as there are too many heavy breathers, people who eat on mic, people with loud background music, screaming kids etc take away from my experience playing the game.
---
Don't listen to this guy
---
Oh I was afraid of that. So current consensus is that you can't optimize for at least two different weapon types? :-/
---
It was way easier to merge damage bonus related to health into a single one (for example at 9% health with adrenal reaction and nerd rage you would have 1+(90+20+50)/100=2,6 times the base damage with respect to the actual 1,9\*1,2\*1,5=3,42 times the base damage, around 24% nerf with respect to live server). For comparison, keeping a multiplicative junkie of 1,5 (but I'm ok to arrive to a flat +40% damage, i.e. 8% for each addiction) and using adrenal reaction and nerd rage the new damage at 9% health would be 2,55 (or 2,38 using the 40% cap) times the base damage with respect to the actual 2,7 of live servers. The main problem of the balance is that Bloodied is way stronger than anything else. If the patch goes live, bloodied it is still way more powerful than anything else, but with small damage number. They need to rebalance also most of legendary effects to prompt for build diversity. +15 special and a huge damage increase are more than enough reasons to run a bloodied over anything else.
---
Honestly though I can attest to this as well. Spent 2000 scrip trying to get a UNY SS chest piece and couldn‚Äôt get a single drop.
---
Joined a server that gave me a UNY piece from Meat Week and went straight to the Purveyor and managed to get 3/5 UNY SS pieces. Ran out of scrip before I could get the right arm and leg.
---
Same and the other half comes from .308 and 5.56.
---
I'm a bloodied food build (yes, it is possible) and I laugh about other bloodied builds complaining all the time. Muh damage numbahs nerfed! Respawn timers too long. We're so fragile.
---
The only thing fragile about bloodied builds are the ego of a lot of their players.
---
If I‚Äôm forced to spend more time on ammo crafting, I‚Äôll move on for sure. People play games to do stuff they like to do, such as shooting beasts. There‚Äôs enough tedious work to do daily in real life.
---
Yeah just wanted to check.
---
Far as I know glowing needs to be int he title and they will be green.
---
Used it a few times, but unless I have enough ammo to convert at the 100x level it's not worth it for me to use.  I'd much rather it be a vendor interface where you sell ammo to it, and then buy what you need with the points you get for sales.
---
Thanks.
---
I'm currently a rifleman build. If I don't want to go bloodied, what is my best option in your opinion?
---
This still works?
---
Nope. Just a lot of bitching and screaming. Shouldn't have bothered reviving him right then and there but I tend to not lose my shit easily. :)
---
Hahaha the wasteland is not forgiving!
---
Glowing Gouls will be going "green". And for the other enemies you will see some weird cracks glowing green on them.
---
OG XBOX user here. Mines fairly smooth 80% of the time. Occasionally it'll be really slow accessing my stash or during crowded queen events. I dont ever have issues during casual play.
---
Thanks
---
Badass pic op, thanks!
---
Don't listen to this guy who said "don't listen to this guy"
---
That or be guaranteed a 3 * drop! üòÇüòÇ
---
This allows them to do that more easily in the future. Once they remove the multiplicative factor they can increase base damage, perk cards, etc. incrementally.
---
That said, it's going to be kinda off when they first implement.
---
But they'd have the ability then to do things like ...
---
* Increase base damage for some weapons up by some amount
---
* Increase perks differently for weapon types - like maybe Rifleman is 12/6/6 ... pistols 15/8/7 ... keep commando 10/5/5 ... whatever
---
That's how it should work. That dude, however, was just bitching, screaming about food builds, and running away from everything. 
---
I should have recorded that and put the Benny Hill theme as background music.
---
I'm basing it off the clues you left on here.  Not many people go around announcing themselves like you say you do before blasting someone in the chest, let alone are they supposedly female.  If it wasn't you then, ok, my bad, but there are too many similarities between your post and my experience.
---
Clever
---
This is what I was going to say. Considering I don‚Äôt like using consumables when not necessary, think I‚Äôll swap to this for that. Not to mention that shaft is perfect for downing.
---
Good looking mock!
---
I have the same as you: One X, Ethernet, gigabit connection. I‚Äôd say mine runs smooth 99% of the time. It gets a little choppy when there‚Äôs a lot going on (SBQ, Wendigo) but other than that, usually zero issues.
---
I would love if it gave less treasury notes and just gave us repair kits. Unless they plan on adding more shit to buy for gold I don‚Äôt want treasury notes. I have over 200 just from playing meat week here and there. I have received one cursed gun which was harpoon, the rug the heads and meat pile. Plan on going for the rest and then prob just going to work on soloing it and go back to the queen fights
---
Or most of us have been playing this particular title for over a year and have seen how long it takes them to deliver promised or implied features. 
---
Don't pretend that Bethesda have a good track record for this sort of thing. Worries are entirely warranted when it comes to the same game that seems to introduce new and old issues every other patch, hell, in Patch 21 including things in the patch notes that weren't even in the update. A balance pass that comes in six months is going to be a pain in the rear to deal with that long. Or a balance pass that breaks something and takes them another few months to fix, if they ever do. Look how long it took them to finally release Colossal Problems, for example, or the push back of Legendary Perks and their initial horrific implementation.
---
No. Fo76 is a GAME. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
---
All yao guai are ghouls though.
---
I just got to where you start the enclave quest to bitch's lap a couple or 3 matriarchs. I leave Lil dude alone.
---
I got a bloodied cursed pickaxe last night, they are possible.
---
Oh well, that sucks.
---
I must have something wrong with my install or connection or something then not sure but every other game is buttery smooth and this one lags like crazy it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm playing at 15 FPS 75% of the time
---
Sorry read it wrong. That was close then. I‚Äôve gotten to try it once and died a couple of times and did mostly clean up. But was nice to run my PA heavy build that I‚Äôve been working on for a couple of weeks now. Still Needs a lot of rearrangement
---
Not at this time, no. Of the two I would say focus on rifles/commando as they're easier to work with and learn what all the other perks do. Shotguns done properly are a little harder as you need extra buffs for your SPECIAL to get them working.
---
Dude stop being toxic. Just cause your always was a pro ego sounds godlike doesn‚Äôt mean you should act on it by making a toxic post about removing lower level players. Gtfo of fallout if you can‚Äôt be bothered with your ego to help those who are likely starting out their introduction to fallout. Players like you need a ban for egotistical toxicity. I helped low levels sense the endish of beta and to present day even if the game is starting to be a clone of other games I don‚Äôt leave because Ik if I do people like you will rise up against beginners and start riots to make the game pro and god tier and it‚Äôs revolting man and unacceptable this is the bs that other see when they hear from a friend ‚Äúyou should try fo76‚Äù they see retardedly toxic high levels saying ‚Äúback to the trash bin you go noob‚Äù and ‚Äúnoobs are a plague conduit glad I was god tier at birth‚Äù maybe they want to play with other people in debatably the hardest dungeon in the game &lt;still I think dmv is hells gate&gt; have you even tried to think that they could use your help. Try doing something good for once mr solo silos captain soloeventletankis. I promise your god tier won‚Äôt die and if anything it will turn golden... make fallout friendly again .-.
---
5 levels to go for me. I missed the first few days, and maybe only one or two days since. On one hand I've been enjoying having a goal to work towards. But it does feel like a chore having to log in every day. And with having a full time job, and not having the energy to maximize EXP, I don't get the level up weekly bonuses very often. That requires some serious grinding, and I'm still kind of shocked by all the people who completed it last month.
---
Yeah, it's really stupid really. Energy weapons and I don't mean those legacy ones have a place in combat. My Bffr gatling plasma does 420 Energy damage compared to a BE 50 cal which did 430 with perks.
---
Pickaxes always comes with bloodied power attack damege 40% and 90% weight

**Counterpoint: Meg is a legitimately bad leader.** (Tons of spoilers herein)
---
Meg is never shown doing anything that would warrant her being the leader of the raiders. She seems to have no clue about what any of her lieutenants are up to, she doesn't seem to serve any particular function, possess any special skills, or have access to any kind of superior resources that would justify her status as leader of the raiders, and yet we're supposed to believe that she's all that. We're TOLD she's the leader but never actually SHOWN anything to back up that claim, and that makes for a very shallow, 1-dimensional character. On top of that, Meg makes bad decision after bad decision. Lev is actually correct; Meg is terrible, and honestly it should be ME leading the raiders after everything I've done for them.
---
Some classic Meg blunders:
---
**1. Returning to Appalachia without a plan to deal with the Scorched.**  
---
Meg knows everyone else got wiped out by the Scorched, and yet she doesn't seem to grasp that she's leading her people to certain death. When first confronting her about the vaccine, she even has a voice line that basically says, "Oh wait, I'm repeating the same mistakes again, d'oh." Like, seriously? She didn't think about this at all? She just figured she'd do the exact same thing everyone else tried and failed? Raiders are supposed to be cunning, apex predators of the Wasteland, and I'm not sure how Meg is supposed to fit that bill.
---
**2. Allowing the Vault Dwellers to control the vaccine.**  
---
The Scorched vaccine is literally the ONLY thing that lets settlements flourish in Appalachia, therefore whoever controls the vaccine controls Appalachia. Letting the Vault Dwellers just vaccinate everyone is a colossal mistake because Meg is effectively giving up what could be unassailable dominance over the entire region. A competent raider leader would have seemingly agreed to the deal, kept an eye on the Vault Dweller, maybe even sent them with a raider as a sign of good faith, and then immediately taken control of the Nuka-Cola plant upon completion of the vaccine by force.
---
**3. Letting the Vault Dweller call pretty much all of the shots.**  
---
Sure, we hold most of the cards in regards to Vault 79, but Meg suuuucks as a negotiator. She's supposed to be this big, bad raider, but then she's perfectly happy to just go along with whatever we decide, like letting the traitor live or even giving us enough leeway to offer Lev the chance to walk away. On top of that, Meg never even tries to regain the upper hand by putting pressure back on us. What if she managed to capture the Overseer and used her as leverage? Or Rose? Or what if she captured one of the Scorched and put him in a cage ready to be shipped to neighboring settlements as a bioweapon unless we agree to her terms? For a supposed badass leader, Meg is pretty milquetoast.
---
**4. Not enslaving/recruiting every last Secret Service agent in that Vault.**  
---
Once it's clear their supplies are running out in there, Meg is in a super advantageous negotiating position. Sure, the agents can threaten to seal off the gold or whatever, but they'll still all be dead, and Meg really isn't out much. She can starve out the agents if she wants, or the agents can agree to surrender to Meg in exchange for their lives and serve the raiders as slaves. Maybe if Meg is feeling generous she could even let some agents raid with her, the Secret Service is supposed to have the finest marksmen in the world. The fact that Meg is all like, "Oh cool, I guess I'll just let you guys do your thing now" is yet more proof that she's a TERRIBLE leader who doesn't see a golden opportunity right in front of her (no pun intended).
---
**5. Ignoring Foundation.**  
---
What. The. Hell. Foundation is a direct challenge to Meg's rule, and she just‚Ä¶ lets them be. Not a SINGLE quest in the main raiders quest line where we actively try to sabotage Foundation's efforts. Not even an IOTA of effort to diminish her greatest rival in the region. Lev was even working with someone on the inside to attack Foundation, but that's it. What's especially perplexing is that the Vault Dweller would be PERFECT for the job because Foundation isn't immediately gonna clock them as a raider and instead think they're dealing with another one of those soft Vault nerds. If I were Meg, that's how I'd make the Vault Dweller prove they're for real: make them go in and kidnap someone to bring back as a hostage, like that kid. (Which could then springboard into Ra Ra and the hostage actually becoming real, actual friends, learning valuable lessons from each other, overcoming their different upbringings and in doing so proving to everyone that peaceful coexistence IS possible.) Or maybe find someone at Foundation who is susceptible to chems, getting them good and hooked and opening black market chem trade with Foundation to further undermine their community and put them on the road to failure and being brought to heel. Raiders are supposed to raid. It's literally in the name. ‚Äã
---
Because Meg is such an objectively incompetent leader, the whole **Raiders** quest line felt a little underwhelming. There were some really good moments, but overall I did not get a sense that I was dealing with actual raiders.
---
Exactly why it was qualified as such.
---
Yes, I've seen super weird spawns and they don't even move until you get close to them.  Like from the flower on the map, almost to the watch tower on the hill, at the pond edge just chilling out, and out past the dirt road on the other side of pond coming up the hill.  I failed twice last night because of these weird spawns that just hang out far out of you compass sensing range and only by chance do I find them after the event fails.  Most everyone has moved on to the new event so fewer people are showing up which is fine but I'm having to sprint from what feels like one side of the map to the other to find them within the time to finish it.  As stated this seems to be pretty common at most of the locations.  It wasn't like this last time they ran it.  Not sure what changed but it is definitely more of a challenge to complete.  Luckily the honey beast drop honey as I'm constantly eating it to keep my ap up.  If you can't sprint I've found you'll fail.
---
Wow Bethesda.
---
I have bloody 50 cal, FE 50 cal,, bloody gauss rifle , also Be pmp shotgun. Thsts what i can choose from.
---
I would have milked him for more luls
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
Consider Solar Armor instead 
---
I run a set of solar with 1 vanguard and 1 each in the specific enemy mitigation and I can't remember the last time I died. 
---
Pair this with a vampire weapon to bring you up on the rare occasion something hits you below the health threshold and you will be amazed at the amount of unused stimpacks start to pile up
---
I agree. I hope they consider doing more area specific nuke bosses.
---
I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again, but the biggest mistake Bethesda made was not creating a unique Fallout 76 for every person.
---
I wouldn't say that - yesterday I was playing as 43lvl character (I want to level up my mule to lvl50 before One Wasteland) on public team with 3 other guys when someone nuked mine - one guy was DC'ed and, surprisingly, no one joined us 3 on that instance, so there were two commandos and me, lvl 41, full health mule with lvl15 instigating shotgun. And guess what - not only we've been able to kill him within 10 minutes, but all get their loot, I revived both guys few times (they had Revenant, so it helped them actually) and also helped them with spawns, killing most of them and letting them kill few crippled to maintain Adrenaline bonus. Event was successful. 
---
Sure, I know how to play it the event, while many players who are low levels don't, since it's their main character, but not all below 50 are useless, same like all high levels know what to do...
---
Yeah it does!
---
Stop using weight reduction cards , they are a hot mess.
---
dropping off technical data at camp venture. was when i was leaving to fast travel away
---
My game was running like a Bag of shit on PS4 Pro.
---
All sorts of problems,terrible game lag,lagging audio.
---
Then it totally crashed during the last major update.
---
I bought a new  2 tb SSHD Hard drive.
---
I have had zero problems.And zero blue screens ever since..
---
I think a lot of problems are at users ends,Shit hard drives not fit for purpose.
---
Even fast trawl takes seconds now.I could go and make a brew previously.
---
Haha this is accurate
---
I'm thinking it's their servers, not your hardware or internet connection.
---
Bingo.  Because dropping nukes is a big part of the end game, I think area specific nuke bosses are a really great thing to have.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen hordes spawn more then the first group in weeks
---
Was he half health after mutating, or half health as in right before mutafing?
---
I've spend thousands travelling around to every player vendor in every game looking for the plan and the mods. No luck yet. Seems I have bad RNG and bad vendor luck. Might need to keep a few rabbit feet from the cook out to see if that helps.
---
You dont need to escape to complete the event. When the timer gets to 0 it travels you back outside. Just be prepared to be in a nuke zone.
---
He, being the weakest of the deathclaws, decided to take refuge there considering it was one of the safest spots in Appalachia.
---
thx for taking the time to provide such good feedback, will look into
---
I saw his dead body near alpha once, but still was surprised
---
Did you aim for his head(s)?
---
Just a suggestion, try stashing away some items from your inventory? See how that goes? Example if you have loads ammo you dont use?
---
We went in with 6 last night and also ran outta time. All players over 150 (I'm currently 221). Went through 5000 rounds myself. Took him to 50% in 7 minutes or so, then he regenerated and we only did 25% in the remaining time. I think people have up.
---
He kept getting stuck in the rafters and with 6 minutes left he just disappeared.
---
Make a new character, run to the event , do the event , get the plan and hustle it to your main
---
This 
---
Fast travel literally after launch.
---
I feel like you're on the wrong sub....
---
I have done the event 3 times. Launched the nuke 2 of those times. I get in but i have yet to get an event reward. I got it once i think because of the quest. Also when i turned it into maggie or what ever her name is i got 6 caps. That was it. I would turn in a ticket but I can't figure out how to on the damn sight. I will be running it again tonight on ps4.
---
You're right, sorry... just realized my mistake lol deleting the post now.
---
You mean for real life?
---
That would be perfect right now
---
After mutating. We were getting there, but ran out of time
---
If you follow him he leads you to a stash. I don't know if that's common knowledge.
---
Exclusively. I always do with every creature I meet.
---
It's not that fun if do not use silo glitch
---
They should reuse the arena in Watoga.
---
It's not necessary to have such emote, but I can give you nice trick I used few times during Encrypted - use your camera. You'll see every character/npc listed using the visor, dead or alive - that way move slowly and you'll find it even if it looks like disappeared. FYI - asking someone where is robot is pointless, since it's usually in different places for different players (don't ask me why ;)
---
Yes they are. I hope the next one doesn't take two years but I guess beggers can't be choosers right? Hopefully instanced, repeatable, end game dungeons are added too. For now though, I am happy the end game finally got another nuke boss. Also the guaranteed 3 star was a thing the end game desperately needed, kudos to that as well.
---
The point I was trying to make is that in other games, you don't have to depend so heavily on the assholes, like you do in this game. You have to depend completely on other people for trade because there's no auction house or other economy like there is on other games. Take destiny for example. You don't depend on anyone because guess what? there's no auction House, you don't have to buy the best guns from anyone else. You earn everything yourself. You do all the hard work, by yourself. You can get bad teammates, and be grouped with bad people. But they can't hold you back
---
Maybe in a public world, but it was happening to me in a private world as well.
---
I‚Äôm always reviving people. Even got Quack Surgeon to give those a drink too.
---
Atoms are instant
---
Some are playing other new games, others are on the pts, while some are just waiting for the nerfs to be finalized.
---
You should get them right away, or as soon as the payment processes.
---
...how?
---
I saw someone selling one in their vendor for 2k caps. They are the true monster
---
Welp, this world has gotten sick -Find new world-
---
A vault boy points at the subject and the puts on a clown mask
---
It's a great tool for dumping steel (beats schlepping bulk to vendors) but that's all I use it for.
---
I only had this behavior when I was playing via wifi.
---
It's mostly to give low levels a little excitement
---
Well put. A lot more effort in there than I would have made for yet another 'the raiders are actually good guys if you think about it!' thread, but still well put.
---
Also, an easy 'raider' resolution to Vault 79 is via PITA. They all clearly love that kid, and her mother would do anything for her, she is even visible wandering around when you meet them, so all you would really need to do is let them stew til the supplies ran dry and appeal to Mercy's motherly instincts. Describe how she is going to watch her child starve to death, and maybe what happens when the weakest of them when someone gets a little too hungry. Maybe tell Mercy how even if they give her all the food, make sure she dies last, they'll get her to let them in once the grown ups are dead and then make her end far more torturous than just starving to death. All she has to do is open the doors and lift the lockdown and let go of some useless gold that isn't worth her little girls life.
---
Ahem, got a little dark there, but if you are going to raider then go all in.
---
I've had them spawn at Whitesprings. Super rare spawn for sure
---
Only if you have Fallout 1st does this work - if you do it on a public world, you're asking for the items to get deleted.
---
Thank you. I think it's better than buying them separately.
---
Dafuq is a food build
---
those are links in the descriptions you can click on to take you to them
---
All of that sounds like lag issues.
---
I wish it was like the unmarked location in fallout new Vegas called the deathclaw promontory
---
Noooo, all the level 50s need to run in circles and die down there instead
---
Each of these cursed weapons all come with their specific set of legendary perks, they're pre-determined and don't change like any of the other bethesda named legendary items, so the cursed harpoon will ever only be executioners
---
I completely ignore it and still just drop extra/unused ammo types that I get on my level 289.
---
I do this whenever possible. Though, I try to hang back to make sure if the person is actually in trouble, because I don‚Äôt want to accidentally steal XP from them.
---
Perfect. You get like 2k atoms yeah?
---
Your a nice person for doing that, if i ever see you in game I‚Äôll drop you some stuff
---
Yup. On the plus side, given I traded for them, they were probably duped, so if deleted there's now 3 less duped weapons in the game. Small sliver of silver on that there lining.
---
I thank you sincerely.
---
Always a nice thing seeing someone take a hit for you
---
Did this before myself.  Another option is to friend people on your recent people list, say you wanted to check their vendor on an alt or something, and maybe get back.  That quick thinking saved me once in the past, hopefully others can benefit.
---
I am level 400 and i had one event yesterday where i  spent the whole event being killed over,and over again.
---
That running with the Hands in the air is some funny shit.
---
Bloodied minigun was the reason.Every knock started the painful process of restarting the Equip process only to be killed before spinning up.
---
You live and learn.
---
I changed to a 50 Cal for the other events and was alright after that.
---
This game has a serious problem with higher levels.
---
I noticed at Queen events.
---
You kill the Queen,and suddenly you are targeted by Mirleurk Kings trying to deny you flux.
---
Higher levels with sense hit the Tents literally seconds after killing the Queen
---
They are all afk on drums and spits.
---
I like this Island a lot. Everytime I have to kill a Deathclaw (and power station at Watoga or Abandon Waste Dump is dead) I come to this lovley place. But since I use Power Armor always it gives me a nice Wash..... just to see that someone already killed it.
---
But I cant be the only one to collect the eggs right? Have in my Camp 15 of them. Dont wanna cook them but can do anything with them sadly.
---
I'm in by myself right now, nobody else showed. I've got plenty of time with these stupid 60 second respawn timers. Oh and his health goes back to full if he isn't close enough to the drop-in area when you die. Fucking incredible.
---
I was like WTF, another currency???? Lol
---
Ah dang, maybe I'll catch you at the weekend.
---
Regular mobs are not bullets sponge, you kill them in 2 shots already with common weapon.
---
Stop with this.
---
I'm really looking forward to MN this year! Last year my hardware couldn't really handle it but I've got a much better set-up this time around. I'm really hopeful about not getting the insane framerate drops and disconnects this year but we'll see!
---
Your best bet seems to be a Bloodied .50 but I recommend you act as cleanup for the guys that have specialised builds. That you can use your lever for.
---
Whenever I see newbies struggling in a silo I literally just message them ‚Äúnukacrypt.com‚Äù and have recieved a few messages back saying they weren‚Äôt aware. It really makes a huge difference!
---
are Albino yao guais rare? One jumped on me during Project Paradise... damn thing was fast as hell and slapped me around so much that I couldn't even swing my melee weapon
---
the albino yao guai didn't do too much damage but sure was annoying
---
I lock my stucture with all my benches because well, they are mine. I dont use vending machines at my camp but I have a PA station and stash/scrap boxes outside. If someone passes thru they can scrap/store and fix PA. üç∫
---
They‚Äôve completely turned fallout from dark and grim to bad fortnite skins.
---
May want to post what system you are on and which box you left them in so some kind soul could check for you. Not saying they will give them back, but at least someone will have them.
---
Chinese Stealth suit and a 2H melee build with a BSS sledgehammer. Cripple the legs.
---
I wish there was a baseless version of all the prefebs ...
---
The best answer :-)
---
1650 Atoms.
---
Fallout, much like Star Wars, has no real ‚Äúgood‚Äù faction. 
---
People crave that black and white binary notion of good and bad. Thing is, no one is really good, and bad is often situational. Call it sweeping it under the rug, but as was said by a wise old man, many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.
---
Sounds good yea thats what my build is for
---
1300 I think
---
I'm hoping that they put a little more effort for Halloween this year.
---
Last year. The atomic shop camp items only appeared 2 days before Halloween, half of a bundle were just ugly ingame assets that were even in fallout 4. 
---
No classic Halloween monster costumes. Nothing really interesting within camp decor.
---
And all the event rewards were lackluster previously ingame assets, with the exception to a couple outfits. Pumpkin suit was cool, but there needed to be a pumpkin head 
---
Halloween is such a unique, animated time of the year. It's so incredibly easy to have ideas for it that they should've easily knocked it out of the park, but didn't even come close.
---
I really hope with how the atomic shop has been improving as of late, there'll atleast be some amazing additions compared to last year. But considering they haven't even hinted at a Halloween event within talks or roadmaps, it's likely the ingame we'll just have the same event with only a couple of new rewards, much like meat week.
---
I LOVE Halloween. I'd really hope for them to do it justice.
---
It kind of feels a little wonky. I've done the event a dozen times now and getting him from full health to mutating takes no time at all, but it's like he has more health than the bar is showing after that. I haven't failed it yet, but I have died at the end and put outside the cave preventing me from looting.
---
just look for me to be online and msg me on XBOX.
---
Yes you very much can, just not on the fly. You can easily have a character thats close to optimized for melee, shotguns and heavy weapons. You just need to switch out the active perks when switching the weapon.
---
I can understand that, and it's purely anecdotal, but it seems to me that PC is still crowded with players.
---
I haven't been able to complete a single Colossal Problem event because of the lack of players.
---
Legendary Run and Meat Week ran fine for me on Xbox.
---
He does just jump servers until he has it
---
The only thing feeding Chally does is progress the event and make her poop.
---
I guess now or never...
---
It‚Äôs very likely that someone else grabbed them since it was a public server, so they‚Äôre probably still out there.
---
I had the fast travel Bug.
---
Some times it took so long it  just spinned.
---
When it got really bad my PS4 Pro died.
---
I had to buy a new SSHD fot it.
---
Fast travel Bug has gone,as have all my blue screen [errors.Fast](https://errors.Fast) travel takes a few seconds.
---
I am putting this out there.Reason being  i no longer have any in game issues 0.
---
After averaging 1,maybe 2 blue screens a day.
---
I finished the legendary run a week ago and have not logged in since. I really need a break and play other games.
---
" Dealing enough damage to one shot a max level supermutant should be possible, "
---
No. No. No. No. Stop this mentality. This has come from the long line of Fallout players who loved being super over powered either through gear or mods in previous Fallout games. This is not a previous Fallout game. It's not single player. It's not offline. 
---
If they rewrote the damage curve to stop this exact thing (which I believe is their long goal), then this game would be a lot more fun. The problem is that they *should* have started at the other end of the spectrum with lower damage and buffed stuff to the appropriate level. 
---
But instead they allowed people to be grossly overpowered and now they have to nerf and take it away, which never makes people happy. 
---
Personally, I can't wait for the damage balance. I want a challenge (which is also why I refuse Bloodied/Junkies builds)
---
Darn if I remember this post was 2 weeks ago and it was like 2 or 3 weeks before that when I saw it. I don't remember if it was a reply someone got from support or a community manager replying. I can't be arsed looking for 5 week old info dude I don't catalog everything I'm not a search engine.
---
If the issue bugs you enough message support and file a ticket.
---
If the name of the enemy says ‚Äúglowing‚Äù then it‚Äôs a glowing enemy. As simple as that.
---
Instigating is great
---
This.  Revenant is great.
---
Glowing creature is one that is that word in its name. I haven‚Äôt seen any effect of that perk on other creatures.
---
Yep then you should get them every month on day you got them first if you got it for a year, I think mines on the 14th
---
  \- rabbit feet
---
Lol :)
---
(ps4) player I bought from had placed their camp at the edge of the pond right by the event.  Big place - think it was the modern house bundle.
---
My fault..........
---
I one shot him before every run on Alpha.
---
Alt F4 mate
---
I think these nerfs are just in prep for the legendary perk cards since they will be buffing certain builds again with them.
---
I reverse pick-pocketed power armor on everyone in F3. Yes, even the kids. I found the downscale auto-sizing hilarious.
---
I think he did get harder cause I ran it 8 times with 2 fails the other day and just tried last night and same thing half health to full health would just eat our bullets
---
Please, telle me what ennemy do you need "shit ton of ammo for", Im very curious 
---
and you should also explain what is a "shit ton of ammo" for you because from my testing, no non boss in the game require more than like 3 or 4 billets, which is Hardly considered being a bullet spounge
---
That is weird. If I start or join a group it stays full for a couple of hours. After that the server dwindles in population, but for the most part I have seen healthy full servers since gamepass. I also noticed though I do not know how well of a metric this is but the LFG went from the mid to high 200s peaking at 300 to now being 350-400. Which to me implies and again not sure how much of a metric it is worth that more people are playing as I see a lot more asking for groups in it rather than just trading.   
---
I have had 1 CP (out of 16 ) that it was 5 of us but to be fair the other group was 8 and a lot of the other layers were in the 20-30s for levels.   
---
Maybe check player levels on the server and if they are mostly sub 50 server hop?
---
Considering you get the scrapbox, tent, special cosmetic items, camp items, and more atoms that the cost of the subscription is worth, it‚Äôs absolutely better than buying them separately
---
One  killed me yesterday
---
My buddy played for the first 15 min and was done.. i kept promising a land full of adventure but.. came up empty when he quit. Lol I still play but he refuses. The opening is kind of dull.
---
Saw one a month or so back for the first time.
---
Wasn't complaining just explaining it's an actual big effect.
---
Well done.
---
I am still only 72.
---
Obviously not going to get 100.
---
Kind of like encrypted but on a bigger scale with an actual raid boss?
---
I'm surprised there isn't one by now honestly. NW also needs an option to immediately re-queue instead of having to jump back to main and then wait to find another lobby, etc. They're just simple but meaningful QOL fixes.
---
Feels bad. A few weeks ago I assumed i was on my private server and left a bloodied railway rifle/25ffr/15fr at Watoga station and logged off.
---
Its not as bad as what you did, but I'm still thinking about it. I have better weapons but the one that got away still plays on my mind.
---
You'll have another chance with Grahm when meat week returns in September, if you don't get it this time around
---
No. You'll be able to buy them for gold bullion after the next update though.
---
Hour and half later and I found them, I specifically picked a very very remote box.
---
New lesson, perseverance is key :)
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre in a dead server. I‚Äôd recommend server hoping until you find a full one.
---
I server hop a bunch just to check different player camps/vendor. Lots of people still playing.
---
No idea.  I'm assuming it's melee since melee food stacks so you can get to absurd damage numbers.
---
You‚Äôll meet the real sponge after weapons nerf goes live. It‚Äôs funny that people don‚Äôt care when bloodied and junkies get nerfed hard, while those builds contribute the most in boss fights. After the nerf you‚Äôll see a lot of ‚Äòomg we failed the event‚Äô posts by low levels.
---
Heads. On. Poles.
---
it feels like you are finally free from having to level up and play NW. you can finally play 76 on your own terms.
---
i think food builds are kind of cool and a nice change from the usual sea of bloodied builds. Though I'm too lazy for either
---
I have 500 hours on Xbox, this is definitely abnormal.
---
That‚Äôs great!
---
so rifle/commando would be viable for example with the same build but switching weapon dmg perk cards?
---
Me neither.
---
It is a Pain in the arse.
---
Mine will only change a couple of Bullets at a time.
---
No idea why.
---
Now i just think too much effort,for too little reward.
---
Did we end up getting that for sure?
---
We all know that, but we're trying to make a game here, man, not a simulation. We wouldn't be walking around with an M2, 2 miniguns, a gatling laser and plasma, a flamer and 15.000 rounds of ammo wouldn't we?.
---
Those are my ideas to make the game more fair and more fun, and while you are technically correct, perma-stealth melee wouldn't make the game more fun at all. Quite the contrary.
---
No. One Legendary Run per account, not per character. If you opened them all already they're gone. 
---
Good news is that the PTS players say you can buy additional lunchboxes for Gold Bullion on the test server.
---
True additive is what most games use. I know Borderlands 3 uses additive and multiplicative together. I think more additive though.
---
I found one outside my Camp 3 days ago for the first time. First I thought it was a giant Super Mutabt Dog. Real cool.
---
Progress is account wide, so no. Be sure to claim the items you want on the character you want. Things like perk card packs may be more useful on a lower level character.
---
A build that doesn‚Äôt focus extensively (or ‚Äòefficiently enough‚Äô) on combat related perks and gear. 
---
Some people consider food builds to be those that don‚Äôt have *any* helpful damage bonus or reduction/protection perks, and just use Quality of Life perks. 
---
Some people consider a food build to be one that has even a single non-combat related perk.
---
Yeah I had over 200 when I started NW.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a single post here complaining about food builds. 
---
Plus there isn‚Äôt any way to tell somebody is a food build unless that player specifically told people they were a food build. 
---
That event itself is hard. I‚Äôve managed to kill him 7 times so far (of course with help of the team)
---
People go down often, it happens. It‚Äôs not an easy event.  But I‚Äôve seen level 50s getting annihilated, and also level 400+ die just as easily.
---
I think it‚Äôs more of a term to describe people with little to no build in mind
---
Buff deathclaws? Give them larger health pools, make them faster and allow them to lift you up and throw you 100 meters
---
This happened to me but ended very differently. 
---
The wanted person was a newish almost naked player. They hadn't done anything to my camp so i figured it was possibly one of those unintentional woopsie moments so i just let them carry on and waved. Then a higher lvl player spawns in, looks at me, looks at the wanted dude, looks at me again (sussing it out i guess) and then turns and shoots the wanted dude, walks over and loots the guys stuff then looks at me and then tported out of existence. 
---
Well that was interesting.
---
The new now unwanted player comes back and msgs me asking wtf happened. 
---
Hey wasn't me, you got bounty hunted.
---
Msgd replied was this game sux and a rant.
---
The random and weird interactions in this game are priceless.
---
Could be worse, America could be ruled by Nazis right now.... oh wait..
---
you currently cannot, but man would I like to dual wield my two quad single action revolvers.
---
My buddy (lvl 354) and I (lvl 198) were on last night and we get to the event and we were the only ones that joined.  Whoever launched the nuke didn‚Äôt even show up.  Why take all the time to launch it and not join the event?
---
It's pretty awesome.  I'm sitting with almost all my points on it saving me a ton of carry weight.
---
Sorry that you just hate everything, no matter how good and useful it is and like whining about great and useful things more than playing the game.
---
If you are willing to fight one, you must be willing to fight them all. 
---
If not, pacifist and move on.
---
Some are worse than others, sure. It‚Äôs just a spectrum of bad... I‚Äôve yet to see any inherently good. They are only ‚Äúgood‚Äù by comparison. 
---
And still, people will support them and take great lengths to justify that support. I‚Äôd almost prefer the folks that just own up to it.
---
Bethesda, take notes ! This is the kinda content we need.
---
Youtube
---
Kill first, ask questions later.
---
what do you want after that, a camo like assaultron ?  
---
stop giving them idea like that ...
---
I've resorted to holding the cursor over top of the Mine as the nuke hits, usually the first to load in. Just remember you don't actually have to run in there manually, just fast travel to the event. I'm not sure how it is on console but I've seen two lots of people load into two different instances from the same nuke/event proc. Had most the server in one, and ironically I loaded into one with my friend who wasn't even expecting me to be there :P
---
you forgot to fix  The Legendary Run  and the autocomplete without having any score.
---
the futur camp doesn't show the camp on the map
---
I got the tenderizer plan by turning in two plants along with my prime meat. Not because I don‚Äôt want to participate, just because that‚Äôs all the time I had before the event was completed. 
---
Then there‚Äôs been times where I collected plants and meat chunks, cleaned up the poop and skeletons, and had time to play the drums twice, and I got a grill master hat. 
---
I don‚Äôt think what you do affects your rewards, it‚Äôs pure luck. The only ‚Äúdifference‚Äù I‚Äôve seen is that you get more meat cleavers the more you participate.
---
Hahah fair point üòÇ
---
You cannot apply any mods, including skins, to the Fancy.
---
whats your build?
---
The bugged graphics on ghouls are way creepy. I got attacked recently by one down on hands and knees with its head down so you couldn't see the face. Since it didn't animate, it just quickly 'scooted' directly at me. It had a very ju-on: the grudge feel to it. Less jump scare, but much more unsettling as things just 'shouldn't move that way.'
---
I play on xbox and have not had this problem. Maybe its the time you are playing? I'm on in the evenings EST and in the afternoons/evening on the weekends.
---
The game-pass release brought a ton of newbies. Those guys are thinning out now but the ones left are typically high enough level to contribute to end game content. I have noticed that events are being neglected during Meat Week because the primal cuts event pops so often.
---
If you're on a public group, you should be able to do that.
---
Delivering 250 million glass happens Sept 7-10 to unlock a second helping of meat week. I don't imagine that will be a difficult one to achieve, and if we are somehow lagging behind, we will surely get a helping hand from the dev team like we have before.
---
I'd vote the AA one. Limb damage is still a "magic" effect, AA gets a tacit buff on PTS for being unaffected by the damage nerf, and you won't deal with the TS accuracy issues.
---
You can type 'magic weapons Fallout 76' into Google or Youtube and get what you're after.
---
Well in my defense that was my first time attempting it. I think we only got 6 because the run came after midnight. I think a few of the players gave up too soon and it just became a wendigo farming run.
---
Making melee draw the attacks of others makes little sense outside of the shovel since you are near the enemy.  Making guns have perma stealth is a huge advantage given you are already at a distance.  If perma stealth exists it makes the most sense with the weapon types that have an inherent disadvantage not with ones that allow you to attack at a safe distance.  
---
Making rifle builds shoot then move to a new area is a much more  logical and viable choice than making stealth disappear when you kill one enemy in a mob with a melee weapon.
---
Your ideas in no way make the game more fair.  It only pushes more people towards guns.
---
There is definitely some shenanigans going on as I get duplicate legendaries while crafting FAR FAR more commonly than chance.
---
Wands, staves, swords in stones...
---
Raiders Vendors 15.6% and Grahm 9.9%
---
(Easiest way is to go up all the raider vendors at train stations in the savage divide)
---
When leave a world. Just block a random person and it shouldn't try to throw you in the same world.
---
Blocks go away when you quit the game.
---
I thought we bloodied are the food builds? What else do you think we carry in that extra 100lbs? Party size corn dogs and alcohol of course! 
---
Screw that guy anyways.
---
Your account gamer tag is what is displayed normally. During some events (like Monster Mash and Encryptid, IIRC), you character name can be displayed.
---
the AA one for me
---
Bloodied build is not very good for this event.
---
That is just my opinion.
---
I change my build completely just for this event.
---
I am a bloodied build and spent more time dead than participating in the event. Wendigo are pretty relentless.
---
I go to 3/4 health and use a Zealots 50 Cal,reason being a Mingun is useless,after every contact you have to start the spin up process,get hit,start it again,rinse and repeat.
---
Melee build might be good also.
---
I subscribed for the first time solely for this reason. Everything else is just icing on the cake.
---
I spent a lot of time building my CAMP and damnit I want people to see and enjoy it.
---
Sounds exactly like he's been from Day 1.
---
Bloodied builds are the most toxic players in the game so that's not surprising. I have 1 weight reduction stat in my build and this guy started saying my build sucked so I had him shoot at me and proceeded to kill him in maybe 2 seconds, they just get downed all the time in the big fights and spam for people to save them.
---
There's a pretty frequent spawn behind the scout building at dolly sods.
---
The believe the 8 player limit is such a stupid idea to begin with. 
---
Hell, judging from my experience so far, you probably had your spot taken by someone grinding screws
---
This. It's so sad when you have 10 cleaver plans
---
Missed Opportunity is what Fallout 76 is all about.  
---
Note\* I love fallout 76.
---
It's a stupid fucking name. That's what it is.
---
Remember any weight perks you have dont effect your stash  box, sadly !
---
Do you have a lot of notes and holotapes? Getting rid of most helped for me.
---
I wanna see a huge assaultron. Like GUNDAM sized !
---

---
Doesn't this have something to do with the exchange rate US to AUS $?
---
$1 US = 1.38 AUS
---
What category do you craft this under?
---
When I first saw Deathclaw Island I was like, note to self: lvl up before taking on that challenge. When I went to finally see what it was about.. disappointment. That 1 Deathclaw didn't stand a chance.
---
Also, did you notice that there are no living Megasloth babies? Every time I see them, they are dead with an angry momma megasloth all sorts of pissed off. That's sad.
---
also FYI : your loot table is increased by every plan for a weapon or armor that you learn! 
---
so lets say you want to get fixer as a drop, then only learn that plan ! 
---
every time you learn another plan you decrease the chances to get the weapon you want .
---
I was expecting only 1 deathclaw of I'm honest. A lot of people find it around level 5-20. That thing slaughters them useless they go prepared. I think maybe having more.deathclaws in a low level area may be pushing it xD
---
I almost killed him on accident once. I was glad I noticed he had a weird name before I took him out. I often wonder how many of these cool instances I may have accidentally fucked up.
---
It really is! And it should be the most important part if it wants to get new players
---
The level design is really good, kudos to the guy behind it. It could give me the anxiety I never had while playing other parts of the game including the one star queen. The final escape is a nice touch, in one game I got to the exit while the timer had one second left, the experience felt like an episode of Indiana Jonesüëç
---
I tried a 2 shot GP once.  The plasma pretty much went everywhere except where I was actually aiming.
---
I would also like to see it have the recommended level listed. That would allow us new people a quick look to see what we can do.
---
I have the same problem with hair. I wanted to make my character agent 47 kinda look with my mobster suit but when i made my guy bald he still had hair but my friends saw him bald on their screen.
---
Ive been done with it since they "improved" it.
---
Ferris Bueller summed it up best, I think, when he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here? It‚Äôs over. Go home.‚Äù
---
Can only claim once, but the xp bonus *should* carry over between sessions.
---
Same, everything else goes into the vendor for 1c each
---
"I've seen one or two of these posted already too."
---
Thanks for laugh, OP.
---
Thats true, didnt think about that at all. Nice :)
---
Bloodied commando, Junkies Commando (low health obviously), Bloodied Strengh versatile (mainly Shotgun + melee with heavy backup for bosses) and Junkies Strengh versatile (same as bloodied, obviously low health too)
---
And its not even relevant as in this game, being min/maxed is allmost accessible equally to every one (the diff√©rence between a 1 or 3 stars bloodied will be minor if you have everything else), as its simply based on being low health and / or being stealthy, simply because some of the biggest damage multipliers are accessible to anyone like Adrenal r√©action, Nerd rage, Sneak criticals...
---
Also I thought as of now all they are doing is changing the damage calculation formula from multiplicative to additive and by the inherent nature of doing that all damage gets lessened by a bit. 
---
Additive is way easier to adjust and apply changes to without having to worry of how one thing can take 100 damage to like 3000 damage.
---
I hit this bug multiple times daily.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a giant gutsy with 36 guns blazing in all directions. Or the mother of the little Flatwoods monster who can make players shoot at each other (pacifist won‚Äôt help).
---
I have the tenderizer plan. I can give it to you if you're on ps4.
---
Please let us nuke Lucky Hole Mine and fight the Interloper. üôè
---
One major problem with this is that people only report oddities. They don't report when RNG looks "normal". There will be 1000s of people that get a reasonable spread of effects but if 10 get a weird spread and only they report it on the forums, it looks like a trend. 
---
As mentioned above, it is almost impossible to prove.
---
If the client crashed then yes, absolutely. If the server goes FUBAR then you're screwed.
---
I am a bloodied build and struggle with it at this event,even in full power Armour.
---
So much so that i change it for this event.
---
I feel as though all my mutations and Perks are useless.
---
Even emergency protocols dont work.
---
 i change to full on commando with 3/4 health reduced damage output on a 50 Cal,but consistent,i fly through it.
---
I feel like this event was designed to destroy bloodied builds.
---
I am with you: I don't care.
---
I also would add: the mesh of the object itself is terrible and doesnt fit anywhere
---
...this guy raids.
---
It just works
---
count board spots remaining before dude finishes
---
Ahhhh a knife through the heart. Alas dear, kind person I am on PC. But the offer was very kind!
---
Yeah, I had one as well. TS/25/15 and I had to use it like a shotgun at almost point blank or I‚Äôd be lucky to hit half the shots in one plasma core.
---
Ok. Um real quick I've been playing since day 1 and can someone tell me what the hell is a food build?
---
Calm down dude, I asked on this two weeks old thread *precisely because* I was in the middle of a search over all of Twitter, Reddit and the Devtracker. This was one of the many threads I've found while searching.
---
There are dozens of threads in which everyone says they've seen this statement yet this statement is nowhere to be seen. I went three months back on basically all platforms and haven't found a single thing. 
---
I figured I'd ask one of the many people who said they've seen this statement, but I'm not expecting you to waste time looking for it nor am I insulting you in asking if you have the link handy. Don't have to take it personally, I'm just looking for a source, if you can't give it to me just move on, a reply wasn't even necessary.
---
Sorry for bothering you, I'll try my luck elsewhere.
---
Ah damn. Good luck man!
---
Also on ps4 and not had any problems other than a couple of minor lag spikes when there were a lot of adds. Would agree about having a stash box in there but who the fuck stashes ammo?
---
I don't get... When people use a Colossal Problem pun do they think they're being original?
---
This doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Servers are dynamic so whether there are 50k people playing or only 100, you will always see near full servers. New servers are spun up as needed. It‚Äôs not like they have a fixed number of servers and speed people across them. 
---
Maybe you just aren‚Äôt seeing camps on the map? If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs likely because of a lot of new/low level players who don‚Äôt have them set up. 
---
The game is a top 50 game on Xbox right now. Player count is certainly not low. 
---
Tl/dr there is no way to infer player count by looking at number of players on your server.
---
I will second that! I would love to see a special Super Mutant or behemoth from West Tek too.
---
Lock pick and loot all of them.
---
Some people man...
---
Jeeez literally the first raider vendor bot had it.. Thanks for the tip!!
---
From looking at the comments, my assumptions about "food builds" were way off. 
---
I was thinking Food Build was someone who gathers all the flora, kills all animals, has Butcher's Bounty....cooks a lot of food to either eat for bonus or sell for decent coins. Me, basically.
---
ya I've noticed events being neglected because of Meat Week too. But for me, before Wastelanders I would always have 3-5 people at every event I did. The day Wastelanders hit, I suddenly became a solo player.
---
Anytime :)
---
Yeah but in the early parts I really didn't come across a lot of ammo or the means to be able to make it. If it wasn't for higher levels taking me under their wing I'd still be lost.
---
He... is easy to solo. I‚Äôm not saying everyone can but someone beat him within 13 seconds, can‚Äôt remember whether or not they had teammates. Even with 7 teammates it would be 104 seconds solo, less than 2 minutes
---
I don't disagree with you but I also don't think it's much of a surprise lol
---
It's a term used to describe players who suck at PVP.
---
Started to pop up in adventure mode when people "admitted" to using QoL perks and enjoying full health builds. Kind of silly, really, but here we are.
---
Melee is good for the spawns, but You get aggro‚Äôd fast and the melee strikes with higher numbers end up paying off less than a running a gun that can only handle 1/10 of that because of all the jumping around you have to do to not get killed. I try to stay hidden most the time and fire with any automatic weapon, it seemed to work well enough.
---
under armor in armor work bench
---
"Underarmor" category at the armor workbench. 
---
May seem obvious but did you learn the plan?
---
If the damage balancing goes through that they‚Äôre testing right now, AA will stand to maybe be the best weapon prefix in the game. So based off of that I‚Äôd keep that. If this was 2018 though you would keep the two shot. But they rebalanced that damage to 125% instead of 200% or whatever it was originally
---
If it was all high levels then it would be a non event.
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
I am enjoying it.
---
The only thing that pisses me off,Is the Wendigos AI seems orientated towards mobbing dangerous higher levels [players.So](https://players.So) if you are unfortunate enough to be with a lot of lower levels at the event you will spend a lot of time fighting them.
---
You make several good points here. Meg has indeed made several mistakes that would undermine her status as leader. However, I would like to make a few counter arguments based on the list you provided.
---
1. **Returning to Appalachia without a plan to deal with the Scorched.**
---
Meg did have a plan, just not a very good one. She assumed that she could defeat the Scorched with brute force. We see that this perspective was shared by some of the Raiders, who express their surprise about how the Brotherhood were defeated by the Scorched. Now, Meg can be persuaded to abandon direct action and have her crew inoculated, but she has no reason to assume that the Vault Dweller has her crew's interest at heart. In a later part of the questline, we learn about how other individuals tried to deceive her and the Raiders, and are now hanging on wires in Crater as a warning to others. Unlike Paige, however, you can get her to see reason and accept inoculation.
---
2.  **Allowing the Vault Dwellers to control the vaccine.**
---
By allowing the Vault Dwellers to inoculate her crew, Meg is accepting a blow to her reputation and pride for the sake of her crew's well being. But in keeping good relations with the Vault Dwellers, she is protecting her crew in the long term. Remember that both Foundation and Crater are only just beginning to establish themselves, and are not in a position to make enemies. By conceding control of the Nuka Cola Plant to the Vault Dwellers, who have the skills and knowledge to run the only plant capable of making the vaccination, Meg is ensuring that her crew has a reliable source of vaccine.
---
3.  **Letting the Vault Dweller call pretty much all of the shots.**
---
I have nothing for this one. You are absolutely right. Even if Meg was a principled Raider, and trusted the Vault Dweller, it seems unusual that she would not exercise her authority as leader, especially when Lev and his crew betrayed her and the Crater. I'm going to chalk this up as bad storytelling on Bethesda's part.
---
4.  **Not enslaving/recruiting every last Secret Service agent in that Vault.**
---
This is a murky issue. The Secret Service were some of the most elite security in the world, and they know all the ins and out of Vault 79. We don't know much about Vault 79, but, as a government facility, I think the Vault may have several safeguards meant to keep the gold out of unwanted hands. It's possible that if Foundation or Crater don't play nice with the Secret Service, they could decimate the Vault. It's also worth pointing out that, from what we've seen so far, the Crater does not practice slavery.
---
5.  **Ignoring Foundation.**
---
Again. we recall that Crater and Foundation are only beginning to establish themselves in Appalachia. Meg is focused on consolidating her position and building up her forces. As things currently stand, an all out war with Foundation is not an option. Crater just doesn't have the resources or manpower to march through the Savage Divide and seize Foundation. However, we do see Raiders and Settlers occasionally fighting each other in scattered skirmishes across Appalachia, and usually the Raiders win in such engagements, even without player intervention. While I also would have enjoyed a questline pitting myself against Foundation, Bethesda didn't seem interested in adding any. Hopefully this changes with the Steel Dawn update, and the introduction of the Raider War Council.
---
I wish the buy button and the inspect button weren't the same darn button sometimes. I accidentally bought something stupid I will never use recently. iirc a paint job for a weapon I don't like. Thankfully it was only a couple hundred atoms not 1200.
---
knowing beth they would add in a new currency that you have to also grind for. and limits on how much you can sell &amp; own and further limiting how much you can play
---
6k rounds? I just killed him in 8 seconds without firing a single shot, just goes to show how big the difference in dps is between different builds in this game..
---
You say that, but all the bloodieds are just swapping advise on how to handle Earl while you continue to complain about us. Food for thought
---
We can keep wishing but they'll never add it.
---
Not worth it unless you‚Äôre at level 90+ but to each is own as long as you‚Äôre getting things you want out of those said levels
---
Atoms are instant for monthly
---
Atoms for year sub is given at start of each month
---
I still love the Michael Scott Office reference with the "boom, roasted!" at the end of the insults.
---
I think this is the first time I've heard of a "food" build
---
Both equally pointless.
---
Which effectively lowers everyone‚Äôs damage.... so a nerf lol
---
I think it has made some improvements here of late but its a hard pitch. Lol I think the thing I said the most was "dude, wait till your a higher level"
---
Nah, food build is basically to say the player doesn‚Äôt have an optimized build type. It‚Äôs usually used as an insult, but it‚Äôs most the playerbase that just enjoy playing without a lot of the drawbacks from issues like survival mechanics
---
The wendigo spawns aren‚Äôt a real issue if the players work like a team. In one game I thought I‚Äôd focus on the spawns not the boss, it turned out to be hugely successful. Others could pound Earle as hard as they could. We beat it with 12 min left.
---
The fight isn‚Äôt hard regardless of how much damage you do. It‚Äôs more boring than anything
---
People should be allowed to punch the SBQ for 50k+ damage a hit.
---
People shouldn't be allowed to do 150 damage a second with 22 penalties on their character.
---
Just means the player doesn‚Äôt have an optimized build type like junkie, berserker, bloodied, vanguard, etc. It‚Äôs usually used as an insult, but it‚Äôs most the playerbase that just enjoy playing without a lot of the drawbacks from issues like survival mechanics
---
What a fucking beast. He (or she, don't want to assume) looks pretty bad ass.
---
Not complaining just making an observation I actually find it really funny watching people get tapped by a ghoul and then begging for a revive. It was only ever something to complain about before they capped pvp damage and bloodied was actually the only way to play. I say play whatever just dont complain about other peoples build if yours gets 1 shot by ghouls
---
When they introduced it I was actually ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù. This is nicely crafted, I like the rewards, I like the concept, I am the only person on Reddit to like the grind apparently. I was surprised after all that was put into it that it simply ended.
---
My junkie rifleman build is completely fucked. Thought I was in the Twilight Zone seeing reactions to this. Bloodied is still far and away the most powerful and we all do significantly less damage. Yay.
---
And whoever's in your team tbh as that's who will be running the nuke with you or at the very least who you launched it for
---
My ‚Äúfood build‚Äù bloodied unarmed begs to differ.  
---
I swear people who call food builds worthless have no idea how to play this game.
---
that's exciting! thanks for sharing
---
I got it and had zero interest in it. Put it in my vendor for 10,000 caps not really expecting someone to pay that ridiculous amount. It was gone in about 10 minutes. It's wild. But out of probably 20 cookouts, I only got the tenderizer plan once. Lots of grillmaster hats. So. Many. Hats.
---
Thanks for this. Much appreciated
---
&gt; Thanks to /u/Eckserah for the codes, seriously awesome.
---
Thanks Eckserah/NukaCrypt!
---
No worries. I have not thought about it because of the posts about low levels showing up for Colossal Problem. The game will show a brief recommended level when the first notification pops up, but it doesn't show it anywhere else. Really frustrating when I just want to find an event that would be close to my level.
---
Love the UI you did, thanks for posting!
---
This post just reminded me I have turrets on my roof.and should just scrap them for build space, seeing as I haven't thought about them in 80 levels and my Camp seems fine.
---
Play however you want. Calling ppl toxic because you met a guy is complaining though lol
---
Never underestimate the power of server hopping üëå
---
Haven‚Äôt tried witha compound bow, but a regular one with all 3 rank one dmg cards, nerd rage and bloody mess can one shot lvl 68 supermutants
---
I'd love some in-game monster costumes! Flatwoods Monster, Grafton Monster.... a mini-monster walking around like a kid in a Hulk costume.
---
*it just works*
---
You‚Äôre not wrong.
---
Finally a good post. I agree, really difficult bosses is what this game needs, it forces people to team up and be tactical. I saw a lot of posts with people complaining about the short time they have to loot and whatnot, but I feel like they are missing the point of a Hoarder Role in their team, that's what the perks are for
---
Who's having a hard time on Fallout 76?
---
Sounds about right from what I've seen in the few times I've done it. Sounds like if you would have had just one other gunner there you would have got him with time to spare. He has a ton of health, damage resistances, and damage reduction. I've spent the whole time just firing nonstop, switching weapons when I ran out of ammo or a weapon has broke, and finished with not much time to spare. Where there any other gunners there?
---
Had this happen once. About 45 minutes into server hopping I found the right one and recovered my gear. Sorry to hear you couldn‚Äôt recover yours.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that as well.
---
People use that term for someone who doesn‚Äôt have an optimized build.  Its more of a farming QOL type of loadout.  
---
But to me, food build is someone who uses food to boost their damage.   And that would be me with my bloodied unarmed and my melee stacking damage meats.
---
Why peolle with a completely legitimately farmed 2million 5.56 of course!
---
Ya it doesn't make sense. That's why I decided to finally post about it. I see camps, I see people online but no one does events. I see player dots but they are always in Foundation, Crater, or at their camp. With a couple here and there. 
---
In the last 2 months I've averaged about 10 events per day. I do them for my Treasury Notes. In each event, every day without fail, I am either the only person doing the event or 1 other person shows up. 
---
Whenever someone drops a nuke for a boss fight, I am usually one of 3-5 people who show up. 
---
Even Meat Week has been the same. I have never once seen more than 5 people at that event at any given time and I've been doing it every hour since the event started from 8am -10pm.
---
There's just no one on.
---
I'm in the process currently of troubleshooting with a Bethesda rep. Hopefully this gets fixed
---
I'm a food build and that event is cake as long as I keep Earles attention on me since I can just regen the damage and keep smacking at his ankles.
---
That's funny I was at a Prime event which happens just down from the Meat Week event and someone had their CAMP right next to the start point, there were two guys sitting on the porch watching me hack away at the wolves.  I am sure they got credit for me finishing even though they just sat there.
---
There is a fov slider (at least on the PC)
---
the feeling of knowing I wouldn't need to dip into NW or worry about losing SCORE points was epic for me, my dude.
---
I spotted this.
---
I actually went up to 2/3 health.
---
Sure i still take damage,but it is recoverable,instead of instantly dying.I also use my Nuka Quantums.
---
Also avoid weapons that need a couple of seconds to Boot up like Mini-Guns.Every little contact restarts the entire process.
---
So far i have found 50 Cal the best ranged weapon.
---
Just posted elsewhere think this event was designed to decimate bloodied builds.
---
I dont see how anyone running with 20% health can survive this event.
---
When the Collosus screams it is enough to kill if you have low health.
---
There‚Äôs a reason the misc tab is there - for items that don‚Äôt fit into the other categories. At the same time, the key ring definitely should exist, if nothing else to prevent 90% of the clutter in the tab.
---
They've been there since day one is an equally bad metric to justify an opinion.
---
Bugs/exploits/hacked weapons/cheaters/etc... they've all been there since day one so we should never work to fix/remove them.
---
Next bullet sponge event should be nuking Deathclaw Island to release a deathclaw mother and her alpha horde. Small reserved area so no throwing down tents and standing on them. Lots of physical obstacles to break up lines of sight and reduce the usability of long-range weapons. And if you just flood the place with decent strength claws you don't need to make them ridiculous health level sponges, just a real horde event with 4-5 popping out of the ground every minute or so.
---
Even if it‚Äôs just for 1 lunchbox I‚Äôd do that
---
Is that with or without the sneak bonus, and is it a headshot?
---
Lmao wtf why is someone playing the way they want to silly? That‚Äôs just ridiculous. Sounds like you have some unreasonable hate towards full health builds
---
Just below the watchtower is a random event/spot ive noticed more than once that if its the tank with the gutsies as guards they kill agro away more than one of the spawns for prime cuts the event fails
---
Ahh so the problem is people not doing events, not the servers being empty. Gotcha
---
That‚Äôs strange about meat week. Cookout is usually full in my experience.
---
Definitely sneaking, however not sure if it‚Äôs x2.5 or x2   modifier
---
(Everybody agreed with that)
---
that's for daily ops.   
---
maybe other events will stand there
---
Like awholesliceofpie said, first, I wish they actually had mechanics to the fights to make them more interesting than point and shoot til it's dead. Second, picture a raid dungeon, such as destiny. Fight numerous obstacles/mini bosses before an "endgame boss". Have people gear to the teeth before entering, and maybe put a stash box at the end, right before the final boss. Something that requires some challenge, finesse, And a little bit of thought behind it. This game desperately needs a large amount of endgame content. You can only roam the wastelands so long, farm so many materials and legendaries, shop at people's vendors, and launch nukes (for what reason) so much before it's just repetitive with nothing to work towards. I have a bunch of endgame content, along with most plans and whatnot (minus a short very rare few) and built my house over and over and over again. I've spent time in PvP as well as build a PvP arena. New camp content is cool, but with a stifling budget, it's not feasible to make what could also consume a ton of time with instances that allow you to "build your own vault" persay. It just needs something besides patches, nerfs, and somewhat useless content. That was the main reason I stopped playing BL3. Great game, but there was nothing to do at launch after you got to endgame and all they did was nerf, buff, then nerf trying to find balance when the game desperately needed content to keep the player base's attention, which in turn continually brings in more money.
---
I am gonna guess you were solo stealth or all stealth group. The minute you are in a group that breaks stealth it‚Äôs a completely different ball game. The same strats that are used to speed run the queen are effective against earl.
---
Yeah you do have a good point there. Ive actually also noticed that the recommended level is slightly off. Back when I was low level and had no idea what the hell i was doing, i would add 10 levels to the recommended level, becuase i was never able to do match up with the level they recommend. I was always too weak to do it. 
---
And thank you man I really appreciate it!
---
wait, the Tenderizer plan is rare? I think I got it on my second or so event.
---
When they updated to double dailies I was super excited. I have never played NW.
---
To clarify :
---
There wont be any diff√©rence between a 1 star bloodied and a 3 stars bloodied in the number of bullet youll need to kill an ennemy except for 1 major effect : explosive. Same if you compare Junkie 1* and Junkie 3*. 
---
Same for the armor : SS Armor are easily accessible to everyone and having a 1 star set wont be worse than a 3 star set if you consider the number of bullet you need to kill an ennemy. 
---
Allmost all of the minor and major legendary effect are quality of life or survivability effect but wont affect how spoungy the ennemies are.
---
So yeah, sorry but its not that much of a grind to be allmost min/maxed in this game.
---
the thing is not everybody is willing to spend a lot of time to respec and change their playstyle just for the game to be playable (especially casual players ) this will lead to them leaving which leads to bethesda having less money which leads to less suport for the game which leads to more people leaving and the circle continues...
---
This is very true and one of the issues i wanted to go more in depth with in a future week. Ill include the full list of weapons effected by it and some other interesting facts about this particular bug.
---
I think it should just be an event creature or something. Make it more of a miniboss like mirelurk queens are but tougher. The forest just needs more things to make it fun to travel to again.
---
Instigating for one shot mobs, and carry a semi-auto handmade or fixer for beefy enemies
---
This is what things were like before The Master. He knew what he was doing that guy
---
Auto stim effect.  Or u have a perk card that does it.
---
No, &gt;!I'm vengeance.!&lt; It's a dirty job but it's one that has to be done, and to hunt your prey you must know your prey.
---
They‚Äôre the real MVPs
---
Earle made it for his daughter, of course! Because what kid wouldn‚Äôt want a plush of their horrendously mutated father than makes screams of rage when you touch it (/s)?
---
I played till level 250 before I tried bloodie and I wish I would have sooner.  
---
With that said I always ran full health vanguards w/ a VE handmade and a Furious +10% while aiming handmade. Great combo. Also highly recommend commando over rifleman.
---
Add another 400 to that for me and my boy
---
It's OK, but I don't do PVP so I spent a lot of time in bushes.
---
[Did I just score? ](https://youtu.be/oYAZCygB8e4)
---
I've played the game since day one. I don't need your permission to have an opinion on a game I play every day. 
---
As for "Bugs/exploits/hacked weapons/cheaters/etc" that are still around? Well it goes back to what I'm saying. We need more fixes before they mess with other things. Because it's been proven over and over that they tend to cause more bugs when new updates and fixes. That's not shit talking, that's track record.
---
No, no other heavy gunners. One stealth and the other with a combat rifle, I think. At one point, i was inches away from Earl, aiming up into his faces, and his health bar wasn't budging as my rounds went into him. Was surreal.
---
Thanks for that.
---
My good old early game drop  Queen killer,"Zealots explosive 50 cal with 30% extra damage to scorched  was my go to for this event.
---
Glad i never got rid or i would be struggling.
---
I mostly use a bloodied Mini-gun these days at Queen events. It shreds her.
---
with the Collosus event it is useless every contact stops it firing.you start the spin up,contact,start again arghhhhhh
---
Painful.
---
I think I purchased that off graham the other day.... that and a load of other cool plans
---
I feel like this is a case with most content in games nowadays...and I honestly can't remember if there's a big difference from games of the past. I know the legendary run is different from a traditional game ending but in that sense I feel like the ending should actually be different and something special. I'm not gonna get close to finishing but I do feel bad for everyone else out there reaching the end and being let down.
---
I could be wrong but I thought it ends tomorrow?
---
What are food builds?
---
Im sorry but you cant complain about that kind of change if you literally refuse to change your playstyle to adapt to it....
---
But still, thats not even the problem :  lets say you wanna keep rocking your causal unoptimized build after parch and you need 10 bullets to kill a Super mutant Warlord, (which I dont see any buld not doing right now) youll need 13/14 aftzr patch so my question stands : how is it facing spoungy ennemies ?
---
I've got a normal ps4 and done the event at least 4 times with no trouble with framerate.
---
Killing off all the wendigo spawn as quickly as they turn up might have prevented the lag,i dunno... but that is what we did
---
Letting 3 deal with the collosus and 3-4 On crowd control then lending a hand with the big guy afterwards
---
That's nothing: all my dailies and this week's weekly's autocompleted without granting any score and now I'm not sure I can finish.
---
It was a few locations ago and it was quite fun tbh
---
I think he was saying the hate for them is silly. The term is a bit more than his description though. It‚Äôs used to describe builds that haven‚Äôt been optimized like bloodied, junkies, vanguard. Food build basically just means optimized for QoL or survival aspects of the game rather than combat. Pvp‚Äôers like to use the term as an insult, but most of the playerbase are food builds as it trades being much stronger for being able to enjoy game mechanics without worrying about the game‚Äôs survival aspects as much.
---
Melee/Heavy - ski sword and .50 cal swapping them for full effect.
---
&gt; No tuning passes yet.
---
Shotguns were nerfed into the ground more than a year ago and there has never been any sign of a tuning pass. What past action gives you the impression Bethesda is going to do a tuning pass instead of implementing a nerf and immediately moving on?
---
Saw one tear up a bunch of mutants outside the overseers old house down in the ash heap moleminer got it with a rocket a minute later
---
It would be cool if we had to face off with an intelligent 'mad scientist' type supermutant who wants to start up experiments again and overrun Appalachia with supermutants. You could nuke West Tek to blast open his underground laboratory or something.
---
I just sell all my maps for 11 caps. If anyone wants to buy them, I‚Äôm on xbox
---
I heard they put the double walls back in. Haven't tried it myself but that's the rumor.
---
You might be right. It started on the 20th and it says ‚Äúnext seven days‚Äù. I thought I saw somewhere that it goes until the 26th, and noon eastern is when things usually flip.
---
Ah I see. Lmao I really misunderstood his comment then.
---
Nobody seems to revive anyone during ACP or SBQ but it's understandable due to how hectic each event can be. However there have been numerous times that I (as a generally &lt; lvl 100 have had higher levels show up to save my ass during an event such as Free Range or Primal Cuts. Sure, sometimes they show up just to one shot the legendary but that's few and far between.
---
I wish the crowding were true for European servers :/
---
I agree. They‚Äôre fundamentally changing how damage is calculating and they‚Äôre making absolutely no adjustments whatsoever for specific weapons and legendary effects. For example, energy heavy weapons are getting a roughly 80% nerf. 80%! That‚Äôs not necessary at all!
---
FOV slider in settings.  Was added shortly after release.   For PC anyway.
---
Yes absolutely, and you can go for bows/crossbows aswell. The clusters are roughly as follows:
---
Strength: All melee, heavy guns, shotguns
---
Perception: Commando, rifleman, bows
---
Agility: Pistols
---
Intelligence: Explosive weapons (these are the hardest to categorize)
---
You can easily pick one cluster and build for all of those weapons. Note that with legendary perks coming you will be able to build an all around build if you get enough +SPECIAL legendary perks. (These are on PTS atm, google "legendary perks" for a list)
---
Also the clusters are not hard cuts. For example there is a shotgun perk in agility and a heavy gunner perk in Luck. But they are about right.
---
interesting feedback
---
Just moved and am rebuilding my camp this morning can confirm it's back.
---
Wait. I have a quad barrel bloodied the dragon. Is that what you mean?
---
Lol yah, I‚Äôm wanting to try a bloodied or vamp gat gun for this as the slower fire rate doesn‚Äôt seem to bug, but so far I‚Äôve had a lot of luck with my fixer. It seems he has good explosive resistance like the SBQ though so I‚Äôm gonna try to look for something without it. If you have a high enough fire rate, some guns will reload are way above their mag size. I had my fixer go up to 150 rounds a clip a few times yesterday and I blew through earl‚Äôs health everytime it did.
---
I'm AFK'ing currently and will edit this comment if the event pops up at noon. I think it will, I think it was Thursday to Thursday. But I'll double check.
---
I was only lvl 10 when I got there so there was no one shooting anything! anything is one-shot once you got the lvls and build.l!?
---
That would seem to be a very relevant issue.
---
Not all glowing enemies have glowing in their name
---
Same with Mutant‚Äôs and Berserker‚Äôs. They need a major buff and not a nerf. Berserker‚Äôs should get a bigger damage bonus than bloodied since having no armor is a much bigger sacrifice than having low health and like 700 DR. I‚Äôm a full-on bloodied build btw. Mutants should stack up to 5 mutations for a max of 50% more damage.
---
The Moo Man Group.
---
You‚Äôre good. Easy to misunderstand when it‚Äôs hard to even keep track of who‚Äôs saying what on here.
---
chicken
---
You put Nev Vegas instead of New Vegas. Go fix it before correcting someone else you bozo.
---
I, for one am glad I‚Äôm done with the score.   I couldn‚Äôt care about the challenges.  I didn‚Äôt do them before the Score.   
---
Score is the only reason I did the dailies and weeklies.  
---
Now I can load the game and just play my way.
---
Me and my mate both bloodied unarmed, and some random in the team wearing PA.
---
Same here. I miss my Tekken statues.
---
I logged in, bought my 200 gold bullion with the notes I already had, found enough cheap legendarily weapons in players vendors to max script for the day and logged out.  In and Out.  A quick 20 minute adventure.
---
Friends list is fucked on Xbox, causes the game to not recognize people you are friends with on Live. I tried everything to fix this and nothing worked, just says we aren‚Äôt friends. 
---
Check your ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù menu and see who does and doesn‚Äôt show up and ask if you show up on theirs
---
Same. A lot of the perks I have are survival traits because of my initial game play. I have Lead Belly maxed, and have never swapped it for anything else.
---
It might be time to start looking at other options though.
---
I have a Bloodied/Unyeilding Archer who can oneshot everything except for the two/three bosses. It will depend on your perk setup how well you do, but in my expierence, a headshot isnt required, but youd be missing out on a lot more damage. 
---
You will want to learn the double tap for VATS as well. Again, this might just be me, but hit chance seem to be automatic if you in/out/in VATS before the shot. Otherwise, i dont seem to hit anything with VATS on first try.  
---
As for the compound bow itself, i dont see much of a difference between it and my regular one, maybe a tiny bit faster draw, but nothing to be excited about.
---
Who among us has not placed the heads of our foes on a pole at one time or another?
---
You missed my point again... people will not complain to long they will leave they are not obligated to stay here or something XDD we ALREADY have people complaining about meta even tho its forgiving as fuck and you can run anything 14bullets is a lot also keep in mind it will be easier for casual players to die as well
---
Easy there guy, wendigos and their "lore" are ripped straight from Native American folklore so your flex of extensive knowledge of Fallout lore doesn't apply there.
---
Tip. Get Road Leathers underarmor and make it shielded. Best sneak stats 4agi
---
So, he didn't "Log Off"....... :-)
---
Yes, all non PvP builds are food builds. 
---
So the person ether believed ACP is a PvP event or doesn't know what food builds are.
---
I figured it would be at the usual reset time, whatever the day challenge timer is. I'm not home but I figured it would be over already.
---
Got 2 of 3, never saw all 3
---
1 hour left
---
Probably when the dailies reset.
---
I got a mail from Bethesda support responding to my support ticket saying "[We] are not able to adjust S.C.O.R.E. points or ranks in the Seasons, however, we will ensure that your report of this issue has been documented for investigation purposes."
---
Probably 12 pm Est
---
The release said 12.
---
I concur... Top lads
---
Imagine being so bad at video games you think you need a perfectly optimized build for the combat in Fallout 76.
---
Dude yes. Finally an appreciation post about the event. I finally got around to try out the new event with some buds &amp; holy shit it was like the first time ever fighting the queen. It was so much fun!! I love the whole unknown/kind of scared to engage aspect to it. Being a level 411 and being worried i might die is amazing lol!! Definitely kudos to Bethesda.
---
I think its allready over yes
---
That perk raises dmg for minigun and shotgun. Pistol i didn't test but i think it does
---
I use a 1\* Bloodied Scorched Slayer's Minigun. It just annihilates scorchbeasts, and I'm not built for bloodied or even heavy weapons at all.
---
I took the same picture some hours ago.I forgot to add flairs and filters tho.
---
The run didn't make me feel exhausted or bored. Sure there were some days I didn't feel it, but that was more, I just wasn't feeling like playing any video game. 
---
Mostly when I would log in, I'd try and make doing the daily challenges part of just playing the game, rather than trying to do them and quit. 
---
I've mentioned before, when take a photo was a challenge, I would use that as a reason to look for a really good photo or funny. 
---
Making games out of the challenges made it seem less grindy. The only one I didn't like was the Level up every single day. Maybe there were like a few times level up wasn't part of the daily. 
---
And I didn't play every day. I just remember how people said, you are going to have to log in every day, that's a 100 days of doing the same thing over and over. But between them having extra daily and weekly challenges now and then, double score weekends, it really wasn't horrible for me.
---
I understand some AFKers. Do the first run on the server normally, but if you notice there is a player who just shreds Earl with his bugged magic weapon in a few milliseconds, its okay for me to just stay AFK right at the entrance on the next nuke.
---
Tested rifleman but that doesn't affect
---
Is that a bug? I did notice in Encrypted I saw some players‚Äô names were something like ‚Äòmule002‚Äô, I thought that was hilarious.
---
Eh. Whenever I encounter people like that I don‚Äôt hesitate to speak my mind. It works in most cases, and when it doesn‚Äôt, there is always the mute function.
---
thats funny.  i got to 90-something and then just said 'fuck this' --  my copy of ghost of tsushima came in
---
I was able to log in and issue a ticket.  In response received an email stating that "[We] are not able to adjust S.C.O.R.E. points or ranks in the Seasons, however, we will ensure that your report of this issue has been documented for investigation purposes."
---
Yeah, good thing that it's coming to an end because now I work ~20 hours a week on top of classes. Gonna be hard to find time out of my day to just log in and go through the daily route. I don't bother with leveling on my main, just start a new character and run it down to flatwoods to do a few quick quests, delete and start over when theyre all done. I honestly don't think I'll even bother trying for the next season, unless they reduce the grind on it
---
lvl 40? guy wouldn't even have a build by then. shouldnt even be at the event.
---
1. Wrong sub, no trading here
---
2. Good f'n luck getting one that cheap
---
"[Bethesda Support] are not able to adjust S.C.O.R.E. points or ranks in the Seasons, however, we will ensure that your report of this issue has been documented for investigation purposes."
---
And how are you punished by diying in this game ?
---
And you missed Berhesda point also : this change is n√©cessary to start the process of fixing all the damage calculation bugs in the game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a bug or intended, to be honest.
---
I would guess 15% faster reload. 25FFR conflicts with 33 Vats
---
My anti-armor explosive handmade would like to have a word with that guy
---
Why is it only the stupid meme terms that get adopted into common use? "Magic", "food build", "milk drinkers", ffs do people not realize what they look like unironically saying stuff like this?
---
Yeah, everyone should give up! Why even bother?!  
---
You don't know what they'll do with all the complaints in the end.  The more tickets raised the better, more feedback to them on the severity and impact.
---
Until it's patched you need a "magic weapon" or armour piece and high fire rate weapon, you can melt him solo then if you want to.
---
All my weeklies and dailies autocompleted this morning.
---
"[We] are not able to adjust S.C.O.R.E. points or ranks in the Seasons, however, we will ensure that your report of this issue has been documented for investigation purposes."
---
Me and vats dont get along well.  Junkies heavy weapons and what not, so I dont really know where most of the vats modifiers end up without looking at a chart.  I kicked onto th 15 faster fire first. As a numeric issue.
---
A colassal problem.
---
I had an expectation that you'd use the code fragments with the Enclave bunker and get the final code from the printer. 
---
Instead it's actually encrypted in a manner that many would never be able to figure out.
---
Do you have any of the small generators from the atom shop in your camp?
---
Come One Wasteland he‚Äôs not gonna be so cuddly anymore
---
Whelp looks like I didn‚Äôt get tenderizer plan (though apparently I can make them salty). Will have to wait until second helpings for another shot
---
There is a limit on players?
---
"Event End:¬†The final Meat-Cook event will take place at¬†12:00 p.m. ET on August 26."
---
Copy and paste from last week's inside the vault article. Last one is 45 mins from now. Last one for me was 15 mins ago, fuck being online during reset.
---
&gt;To clarify : There wont be any diff√©rence between a 1 star bloodied and a 3 stars bloodied in the number of bullet youll need to kill an ennemy except for 1 major effect : explosive. Same if you compare Junkie 1* and Junkie 3*. 
---
i know i run bloodied :V 
---
&gt;Same for the armor : SS Armor are easily accessible to everyone and having a 1 star set wont be worse than a 3 star set if you consider the number of bullet you need to kill an ennemy. 
---
in case of armor 3* is far far faaaar better sentinel or cavalier effects can be life changers for some of the builds 
---
&gt;So yeah, sorry but its not that much of a grind to be allmost min/maxed in this game.
---
you compleatly forget about need to respec aka farming levels and perk cards you need especially for lower level players who didnt know what they were doing when they were leveling up it can get up to 50 levels if you fucked much
---
I see. Thanks for clarifying re cursed weapons. 
---
When I died just before the event ended (before the mine collapses but after Earl was killed) I was placed outside the mine but could move back into the shed in front of the mine and was able to get the rewards from the event. I missed looting Earl and the trunk at the end. I guess the latter is moot now, though...
---
The perk cards that allow you to eat ghouls/supermutants/scorched, and now the very abundant dead humans you find on your travels really help on the food (thus weight) you have to lug around.
---
Event End: The final Meat-Cook event will take place at 12:00 p.m. ET on August 26.
---
Needs to be swarming with 100 *** legendaries
---
I have a yearly and mine are issued on the date I bought. Not the beginning of the month
---
People paid atoms for legendary run before the last day? Why do you just hate having atoms and wanted them to go away?
---
Hey man this is somewhat unrelated to your question but i have a question regarding 76 on the SSD. Im thinking about getting a external SSD for my Xbox. Does it cut down the loading times quite a lot when you play 76 from your SSD?
---
I wish they did something like surprise us with the pip boy popping up and playing the game. Something so original and under utilized in the games. Of course let us keep the holo tape.
---
Checked Grahm every time for a week and didn't see the Mirror Ball plan once!
---
Have you played other MMOs? Just curious not being a dick. You should always deal with adds first when dealing with a dungeon boss. Everyone focusing on the boss alone with 20 wendigos around is a recipe for failure. A level requirement to enter should be implemented though i agree. Most games have a suggested gear and level requirement.
---
[There is little to none.](https://i.imgur.com/RLewFpA.jpg)
---
In the case of armor, you didnt get my point... Yeah sentinel is cool, but it doesnt affect your weapon effectiveness.... and how spoungy ennemies are.
---
There isn't any violet near Monongah. The nearest would be the Toxic Valley.
---
I will also say that alot of times when people get downed in ACP, they are unable to be revived. It goes straight to respawning. I am not sure if this is a  bug or intended.
---
Scavenger: A desk fan?  Who carries around a desk fan?
---
Noon today is the last one.
---
Yea I‚Äôm not a fan of vats either, although I‚Äôm trying to like it since this game put so much emphasis on it. Some weapons are outright unusable without it, such as the railway.
---
‚úã No, thank you!
---
"Food build" is quite an annoying way to describe it, as though a 5 year old came up with it as they don't have the intelligence or imagination to come up with a better word.
---
It has unfortunately been repeated so many times that now it's stuck
---
its anoying to die a lot which may make some people quit as they wont be super excited to play ammo farming and dieing simulator :V
---
&gt; this change is n√©cessary to start the process of fixing all the damage calculation bugs in the game.
---
it wont metter if they kill the game before they even start thinking about it XD
---
I knew somebody would come through with that map lol. Thanks!  Whenever I try to use it on my phone it looks like crap. Looks like I have to get off my ass and do my own nuke.
---
If you can get 4 to 5 stealth bloodied commando builds on the same page there is absolutely no comparison. My group tested that method where everyone stays in stealth and took the colossus down in 4 minutes. Got to the point where we just rotated private worlds. I will say that tactics will change dramatically with the damage cap but for right now a proper rifleman bloodied build team has no competition for the event.
---
It's an egg, and the only way to hatch it is with nuclear fission. :)
---
I myself would like to see a trusty vault 76 canteen to take a sip from similar to NV. No need to constantly worry about dehydration anymore..
---
Thats scary as hell looking. I would deff let out a quick shreik if I saw that while not activly payatention while walking through the wasteland
---
Yeah ran the event around 30 times and didn‚Äôt get it, plenty of back up cow outfits though
---
Yeah, sorry. Its...absolutely devoid lol
---
I have a vats auto rifle build but the issue there is that vats just doesnt deal damage sometimes and that's just not fun.  Oh your stealthed?  No damage.
---
That said on my frechette harpoon for my junkie heavy, vats all the way.  Its like a shotgun, so basically vats or shit damage.
---
This is so true poor thing just add to that that is a lonely mother trying to protect her eggs !!
---
This saddens me. At least I was able to find the stupid fluids in that area.
---
I love how in depth they went with the raiders, I feel it opens up a lot of avenues for expansion. Like what if the raiders and settlers had to team up to take care of the blood eagles or super mutants, and afterwards they keep a rocky alliance going
---
Ewww that sunkissed perk to a bloodied build is like garlic to a vampire lmao
---
I needed gold scrap yesterday and went to that location to pick some off the ground, those spawns were all over the place. I found piles all the way up near the raider camp.
---
Didn't like my response?
---
Pretty sure in a weeks my post that isn't saying give me atoms for challenges will be banned to make more room for those posts
---
Oh course, I was a handful short to finish my shocks on the T-65...ughhhhh.
---
It's meant to mean you will be the food and get eaten by the critters in the wasteland
---
Thank you for this, i'm definitely going to pick up Adrenalin and Bloody Mess, and mess around with my specials. 
---
what rifle do you normally use in general? i tend to run with a hunting/sniper rifle but the fire rate isn't the best when you are getting ganged up on or in closer quaters.
---
What‚Äôs a food build?
---
I mean it‚Äôs great, yeah. But this game needs so much more than a new boss that‚Äôs already trivialized by half the players. The event is fun, it‚Äôs a nice change from the queen but the game needs more polishing in every single aspect. They just keep adding new stuff to a broken ass game. I seriously envy you if you really haven‚Äôt had any issues with the event. I‚Äôve lost out on earles loot like 5 times already because the server lags out and I die from the ceiling or a wendigo or just because. I‚Äôve watched him fall through the floor to never return and the event fails. I‚Äôve had invisible wendigos killing me and they only become visible after I die waiting for 10 years to respawn. These are just a few things from this ONE event. The entire game is so fucked but it keeps getting normalized by people that make posts like this and talk up the game so much. I love this game, I really do but how can you even talk good about it anymore? After almost 2 years of hot steaming garbage that every time they ‚Äúfix‚Äù or ‚Äúimprove‚Äù something the games gets 5x worse. I would sacrifice new content for years to come if they would just get the damn game running at least half as decent as other online rpg games. The game is seriously almost unplayable for me. Stealth barely works, Damage is rubber banding worse than it ever has so much so that I‚Äôm wasting hundreds of bullets just to kill several enemies that I can one shot with my bloodied build but because of bugs and bad performance I‚Äôm wasting ammo. That doesn‚Äôt happen every enemy but it‚Äôs getting pretty close. The list of bugs that affect normal everyday gameplay is way too long for a game and gaming company that receives this much attention. People should be boycotting this shit, canceling FO1st and demanding that Bethesda fix this trainwreck but instead there‚Äôs people requesting new camp items, oh I want this cool skin to be added, add weapon holsters etc. like yeah I get it that stuff would be cool but fuck your stupid skins and camp items this game is gosh damn broken! It‚Äôs barely playable for any hardcore player and mildly amusing for a casual player that likes to build camps. Fix this shit. For fucks sake fix this shit before releasing anything else new!!! And that is the end of my rant that no one will ever care about and Bethesda will never see because they‚Äôre busy cashing FO1st checks and not being involved with the community that makes their money. Downvote me. Fucking do it. Send me down to oblivion maybe I‚Äôll see Earle Williams there where he fell through the floor
---
but it affects how much i can survive :V which translates to how much dmg i can do before i die
---
You are certainly right. The Crater Raiders do still engage in the kind of crimes we‚Äôve come to expect of typical Raiders. They decorate their territory with the corpses of those who have opposed them, and not above boasting about the cruelties they have inflicted upon others.
---
But I am not here to discuss the morals of Crater and Foundation. Bethesda very much intended for the Settlers to be the good karma faction and the Raiders to be the bad karma faction. But the problem is that Bethesda wrote the Raiders far better then they did the Settlers. Many players, including myself, find the Raiders more appealing because they are more well-rounded characters, while the Settlers are painfully one-dimensional.
---
Ugh, I hate those gut punches. If you're on PC I can give you some flux!
---
Gauss Mini Guns get increased damage from Demolition Expert perk card. They do have an explosive effect. Try not to blow yourself up.
---
Yes this is right. Did it with 3 other people today, no magic weapons and full health builds. I play a stealth build so decided to mop up all the spawns and make sure the other 3 tanking the colossus didn't have to worry about the spawns. Only went into danger once. Was really good in stealth being a support to the heavy hitters. This event needs to be done as a team, if everyone is just there trying to kill Earle and noones thinking about the smaller stuff it won't be as successful.
---
If people'd entire game plan falls apart because the enemy can see them, or because the enemy doesnt die instantly, and if they die over and over then either their build is shit (too overly reliant on certain factors) or they are shit at using their build (unable to mitigate weaknesses properly)
---
I like using bloody melee. I like being on the edge of the envelope with ~40hp and doing silly damage. I also recognise there are times when I need to flush my rads to 50% to not just die like a chump.
---
If mods were a thing...with open resources on PS4 finally, of course...
---
It should end with captain cosmos blowing zorbos head off.
---
PTS is a separate instance, they loaded your character in but it's a one way transfer, whatever you do in there stays in there, no Atom shop or anything like that either.
---
I an a bloodied commando build.  I die just as everyone else in ACP, but i have found a few things that have helped me a bit.  I often use the beams where you drop in to avoid his hits. I just sway around them to avoid line of site.  Then unload fire left and right of beams. When he runs back into the background  area, i move around the square pathway on right side, peeking around corners and laying down fire. It also helps to avoid incoming damage. The wendigo spawns are another story. I am stealth build, so i am usually in caution mode. I hope this helps.
---
On Xbox they sometimes can take up to 3 days.
---
Well yes, I was more trying to say you dont get 1650 x 12 atoms at purchase of year sub
---
I do, however, know that no one is getting SCORE points given to them. So there's that.
---
Tbh I think vats is the most OP component in this game. I‚Äôm very experienced with fps games, when I aim my guns I don‚Äôt always hit the target, but with vats, essentially legitimized aimbot, I not only hit the targets with high chance but hit them before I could see them in challenging lightings, down to specific body parts lol. I don‚Äôt quite understand why people are mad when vats aren‚Äôt working 100% of times. To me as someone who never used it in the past, it‚Äôs already a huge ammo saver.
---
It's not that hard to stay alive as a Bloodied build. I just run from Earle around obstacles if I take full aggro from him and use pharmacist 1 + diluted stimpaks to keep healing faster than I take damage.
---
Hopefully that will become a non-issue once the level balancing update goes live... One Wasteland or something like that?
---
I dont know how but i got 3 from like 15 events or even less, am sorry mate
---
I think it needs a cave. A cave absolutely infested with high level deathclaws. The deathclaw always comes digging out of the ground at it's nest right?
---
Oh woops i've misread the "dont" üòÇüòÇ well then, i'd go instigating or anti armor. I can Check my mules when I get Home if I got sth to spare
---
Try standing in the centre square and peek at earl and take shot from there and circle as he moves that's what I do I only died once and im bloodied.
---
That's awesome. Do you remember the level of it?
---
Yeah but sorry to say that but fortunately, there are other ways to not die in this game.
---
And from my testing, even if you have to fire 14 bullets to kill a super mutant on PTS, you are rarely even attacked by ennemies.
---
Tou also have PA if you want to survive more and so on... 
---
But that reflects exactly the problem of this game : Its allways been to easy and many People would like it to be even easier. But some People think otherwise
---
I think 1 left about 30mins then we can possibly get a second helpings if we turn in enough leather I think it is
---
And with one wastelander, this will become a lvl 100 Liberator....
---
You know how, you work there?
---
YES! At least one player should (help) focus on the spawns. Sneaky ranged DPS is amazing for this AND they can still get plenty of shots on Earle with all that awesome Adrenaline!
---
Glow sight level 3 +60% damage to glowing enemies
---
Bloody mess level 3 +15% damage
---
Adrenaline level 5 +10% damage per kill (+60% max)
---
Tenderizer level 3 +7% damage for 10 seconds after damaging a target
---
 Just a few staples that work with any build.
---
Fair enough, and I agree about the characters being more interesting, but I will point out one of your first replies is to agree with _Plums that they probably shouldn't even be called raiders. :P
---
It ticks down slow the 50, and I wonder sometimes if it doesn't necessarily show damage immediately when there is a bunch of things going on, like that fight. It sounds like you ran into one of the issues with that fight, and thats if you're not in a good mix of people its not entirely worth it. Basically read the room. If you're the one doing the bulk or the damage, ask if its worth your resources. Especially if you upgrade to ultracite or regular 2mm or .308.
---
I laughed so hard at that. In full fallout fashion it totally could end with bloody mess or the cannibal perk.
---
It's to my understanding that it does cut down on a load times.
---
That's actually a brilliant idea. Not sure why you're getting downvoted.
---
The prize is several days of playing games less grindy
---
I definitely dropped that radstag the first time I saw it.
---
I really don't see this actually coming live with Patch 22. They need to keep it soley in the PTS until the balancing work is complete.
---
People probably don't want it fixed or seen
---
I also don‚Äôt do PVP. I‚Äôd rather some Super Mutant Behemoths.
---
It was easy for me as melee, BUT I run full power armor Instigating melee. I one shot 75 wendigos. Switched to .50cal for Earl himself, admittedly.
---
I think it disregards the initial 30 seconds or so before the first shrinking circle shows up on the map and then probably only counts full minutes while throwing out any remainder seconds. Luckily I am close enough to the end of the legendary run that I didn't even bother with this one.
---
Well, I found the deathclaw pretty hard to kill. Am I the only one?
---
A lvl 1 developer must have named it.
---
I sell nearly all of my stuff for 20-25% of the recommended price... All ammo and most junk for 1 cap each... I basically farm junk to sell, haha.  I sell rad-x and rad-away for 3-5 caps each, disease cures and stimpacks for 5-10 , super stims and nuka quantum for 15.  But tbh since I'm only level 55 I keep most of my stims for myself. üòÅ.
---
How would they know how much time is left in the event? It all depends on how fast the participants do it.
---
Not looking forward to 2% rewards I won't get to earn.  I started playing two weeks before Fasnacht so I can't comment on previous events but having rewards to be so low a % drop from Fasnacht and now Meat Week is just frustrating and disappointing.  I'm currently unemployeed (thanks Covid) and can put in extra time for the events, so I can only imagine how much worse it is when players don't have that time available.
---
Go into vats go out of vats go back into vats it should take your shot real good.
---
I'm Todd.
---

---
Buying them from ayer vendors. They're part of the xmass gifts so are pretty easily available
---
again you are talking from the point of minimaxed build not from the point of average casual :V 
---
&gt;But some People think otherwise
---
and the game will die because of them :V
---
The issue isn't that. it's not that it doesnt work 100 percent of the time.
---
In my experience with that char, if I'm in stealth, it will not deal damage 100 percent of the time, it always misses.  Otherwise its hit or miss.  
---
For a stealth commando, no vats from stealth is a deal breaker.  Luckily my heavy weapons usage made me pretty good at combine hard aiming and hip fire.
---
Like I said though, on my heavy I use vats for my harpoon, and never had an issue because it's only occasionally at worst when stealth isn't a factor.
---
*sneaks stealthily in power armor*
---
if the blast zone an be set to overlay part of toxic valley - there's lots of violet there.
---
In my experience many people are playing XBox.  Game Pass added a lot of new players, in my experience.   Have you tried using the looking for group function on XBox?
---
I haven't blown myself up with the mini yet. The gauss shotty on the other hand, I'd rather not say how many times that's happened.
---
funniest thing is half the people commenting here think a food build is an optimized damage build with stacking food buffs, while its actually the opposite
---
No a food build is a build thats not fully optimized in damage (so if u have QoL perks, like reduced wieght or farming related perkcards)
---
other funny point is that u dont need an optimized damage buff to play this game efficiently, my cards are split between damage and carrywieght/farming and I can do everything just fine
---
It's easier to go farm PA spawns to build your set... But you can get the plans from treasure maps I believe.
---
You could look at Mama Dolce. There is a shed/warehouse SW of the large building down near the drainage that usually has PA. It might be the level you‚Äôre looking for
---
I don't bother with the converter anymore, took it out to save room in the garage. I only use ultracite fusion cores and 2mm cartridges so everything else is sold or stashed.  Heavy ammo gets insta-tossed (Cannonballs missiles harpoons etc).
---
Ehen my friend and I went there, we managed to get the deathclaw to t-pose when it came out of the ground. Sad times indeed
---
Most folks do that, especially their first time through... the "meta" players are a vocal minority. Don't let 'em bug you.
---
Ha yes I just wish there was an option that says turn in all of my .XX ammo and it does the calculations for you.  Instead of 10, 100, or 1k intervals or at least be able to do the action multiple times and not make me go through the menu 10 times
---
I completely agree. When I go in again, it'll be with a full complement of 8, or at least a few other heavy guns. Now, I have to spend time getting more ammo.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Might need asking.  Did u buy the plan for it?
---
IMHO, shielded SS underarmor is quite good.
---
15 DR, 15 RR, +4 STR, +4 nad +2 on 2 other specials that I cant recall right now
---
Or the one fighting ants at the substation outside Watoga.  That's my normal go to.
---
Aww man. I fell and died on my first time in. I was hella embarrassed lmao. I just ran and jumped in.
---
Man of culture I see
---
I‚Äôd rather have a durable food build on my team than a squishy, poorly made bloody build.
---
Most people in the server wait to get to sbq ubtil once nuke touches down, also if you dont put the nuke low enough most people just wont go because theres no solid ft point nor a decent respawn point
---
honestly you are sounding like a milk drinking food build that uses magic weapons.
---
Oh wow that sounds better than the forest operative underarmor.  I‚Äôll need to invest in that thanks!
---
I‚Äôve been focusing on Earle. Which I like the difficulty of that event. I haven‚Äôt completed it. Yesterday every instance I was in only had 3 people including myself. Switching between the mob and Earle is the challenge.
---
Yep
---
I signed on yesterday to tweak my C.A.M.P. and had a sudden urge to modify one of my guns that I had on display..
---
After modifying the gun and attempting to put it back in the display it suddenly says I‚Äôm over budget and can no longer display my weapon. What‚Äôs going on Bethesda?
---
Thats what I've been doing since yesterday morning. That and stims. God speed!
---
A ‚Äúsell all (ammo type) in inventory‚Äù to dispense all your unwanted ammo would make the system at least twice as fast.
---
I've only seen 1 player selling them and I didn't have the caps at the time.
---
Shit, anybody trying to optimize should use food. With the right mutations and perks, it can be extremely potent.
---
 I run a bloodied power armor minigun build and maximize its potential with food. Carnivore and scorchbeast foods with strange in numbers gives +8 to all stats and +38 to DR, +63 to ER from radscorpion fillet. Company Tea, well tuned, and well fed bonuses give an obnoxious AP regen rate to keep Dodgy perk fueled up. Canned meat stew for +12.5% more XP.
---
I can face tank Earl and the wendigo spawn at 19% health without much issue, just use a stim every once in a while. About the only thing that ever kills me is running into falling debris or acid during terror.
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
I've unlocked the framerate and still have stutters every few mins... it's quite annoying. i have a 8600k, gtx1080 and 16gb ram.
---
No you're right, I see that as well.
---
The English teacher in me cringes at your last of punctuation sir or ma‚Äôam
---
You can always trade for one.
---
Ah okay perfect then. Thanks!
---
You can sell your plans and ammo to vendors. Open pipboy at the same time you hit trade and spam X it will sell the 1st ammo or plan in your inventory
---
dont even bother, blaming everything on bloodied and complaining about them is popular right now.
---
circlejerk has to jerk.
---
Who cares
---
I hate that thing.  Luckily I don‚Äôt burn enough ammo to be forced into using it.
---
I might be lucky to get into events with friendly helpful people. A lot of times during ACP and SBQ I saw downed players and rushed to revive them dropping out of fight but was always too late because others already did that. The only reason I and all the rest ignored a downed player was when it was a lvl 25 dying literally every 15 seconds.
---
Oh well. I‚Äôm on PS4. I have a ton of T 45 and 51 plans that I drop to lower level players. Best bet is to check player vendors as someone else said. With Xmas presents being duped to hell and back those plans are all over the place.
---
This is one of my favorites: "There's a new patch with new buffs so we're nerfing everything before it gets here.  If you work really hard and play every day for a few months you can be nearly as strong as you were five minutes ago..."
---
You mean it doesn‚Äôt deal damage when you hit the target in vats with stealth? I haven‚Äôt experienced that yet, but with the amount of burst shots I take it‚Äôs hard to tell which bullet registered and which didn‚Äôt. I tried vats in PA and got very fast AP/core drains, i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a feature or a bug, but it‚Äôs very inconvenient and constantly slows me down. Spray and pray still works better for my heavy PA character.
---
What the fuck? I've never even heard of that.
---
So far I've gotten 2 cursed pickaxes and a cursed shovel.  Woohoo!
---
Man this community is souring. 
---
Wasn't there a post a month ago about how nice everyone is? Kinda long gone from the comments here.
---
Ya, not saying I like it or agree with it in any way...Just think this is what they are secretly looking at.
---
There is a flux map to help out - https://imgur.com/KHDQIV7
---
Does this take place before the others chronologically? Or maybe they weren't in Appalachia?
---
I still see potential. What we think is harmless is really a nesting grounds. Eventually the deathclaw herd comes back to discover it's dead child and sees you. Run for your lives. You thought Hopewell cave was there hotspot, until now..
---
See. To me, this is easily addable content if they ever choose to do it.
---
They really need to add auto-closing doors.
---
You should go with tri barrel, penta barrel lowers dps.
---
I think at least one of those was supposed to be mine and I accidentally got your bloody chef hat. Just let me know when it is a good time to swap. I went 0/58 on the tenderizer plan. Doh!
---
I have yet to launch a nuke - theoretically, are you supposed to collect 8 code pieces to solve the silo code? For some reason I got the number 4 stuck in my head, but that can't be right.
---
I don't know how but i have almost 350 lol
---
Ditch Barbarian and pick up blocker
---
Ditch iron clad and maybe get adamantium Skelton or something
---
Those Dr perks don't do a lot for how much they cost. Dr has harsh diminishing returns
---
Pm me your gamer tag. I'll dig through my plan mule for you
---
 Colossus armor scales with number participating as well, or at least it would appear too.  My wife and I got stuck with just the 2 of us in one event and the damage numbers with I was hitting with were much higher than with a full 8 man group. Anyone else notice the same?
---
Let's face it, the fact that there's this completely arbitrary and unstated 5 minute timer where you have to get to A Colossal Problem before it becomes unavailable to you is dumb.
---
What good reason is there for it to not be available for the same 30 minutes as the Scorchbeast Queen, if not the entire duration of the Nuke Zone?  I really want to get into Bethesda Austin's head on this one.  Who thought this was okay?  5 minutes, and not a second more?
---
They put this timer in, and yet, it's not even a hard limit.  You do have the roundabout option of joining the team of someone currently involved and fast traveling to them... although you're at the mercy of whether or not their instance has the space for an extra player.  But if you allow this, then why bother with the 5 minutes in the first place?  And give everyone the wrong impression that the event is totally unavailable to them?
---
It's such a ridiculous design.
---
Go to Settings. There's a section that shows your Bethesda.net account details.
---
Fair enough lol. Just great that the same ppl who say all we do is die and whine are also the ppl claiming we‚Äôre too op. Toxicity goes both ways
---
I will be adding these! Thank you
---
Even without weight reduction cards I doubt any weapon even fully modded would weigh more than 80.
---
Classic!
---
Duel wielding guns really makes no sense.
---
Lol. One more 2% shot at a reward versus 2000+ score points. Finally they are presenting us with real choices that have consequences in this game.
---
Me neither .. at most 2 and 1 was me. Nice shot
---
In pa, anything that costs ap costs fusion core.  That's a feature.  Even cryo floaters if they get close enough will drain your cores with their frost.
---
And yes.  In vats I get the hits, they just dont deal damage at all.  Sometimes it rubber bands and sometimes it just doesnt deal damage visibly.  Most common at higher chance to hit. 
---
I've been leaving that build alone for a while as its hit the point where it's time to spec deeper and I want to wait for the rebalance in the event that my main just falls apart.  Unlikely as I've made precautions but still.
---
Xbox unfortunately. Thanks though.
---
Try not to cut yourself on all that edge there bud.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Yeah he does, I saw it on him 100%
---
I never wished harder to be part of the 76 PC crowd. This is so very much needed in my life... O.O
---
You choose a side, get into the Vault, and then lose a bit of rep from the side you didn't side with, then continue on as if nothing happened with both sides basically.
---
PS4 doesn't record photos or video capture? :o   
---
Every good play that I get or kill count, I save them lol.   
---
On the fb group one guy showed us that he killed 34 without a nuke. lol
---
Sorry. I didn‚Äôt get around to read it (but I did now) I‚Äôve only played Destiny 1 and I‚Äôve never really reached end game since my friends stopped playing. But I vaguely remember one boss had a shield and you had to pick up a weapon that only spawned during the event and that got rid of the shield but it did no real damage to his actual health? As in you either have to keep dropping the weapon to shoot him or be the ‚Äúshield guy‚Äù but I could be mixing two different games. 
---
I like the idea of like a mini boss. Maybe the big boss starts off as like 4 or 5 tough mini bosses and they try to combine to make the huge raid boss but the more you kill in the mini boss stage the weaker the raid boss becomes (maybe only in HP amount and damage dealing) but you‚Äôd have to find the right middle ground so you can‚Äôt just insta kill all the mini bosses before they combine.
---
&gt; The entire game is so fucked but it keeps getting normalized by people that make posts like this
---
I assume that  I have just been lucky so far.  I am well aware that this game has a ridiculous amount of problems.  This post was not intended to minimize that in any way.  This event has problems too I am sure, but it seems I have been lucky enough that I have not encountered them... yet.   Though I am sure I will at some point.
---
I was expecting the problems with this event to be way, way worse than they are though.
---
You raid the vault.
---
I agreed because they didn‚Äôt have many of usual traits and deeply rooted flaws that I have seen in other Fallout games, such as Nuka World. While they indeed have all the cosmetic qualities of Raiders, such as mutilated bodies, and ramshackle tools and facilities, they don‚Äôt really act like the Raiders we have seen in previous Fallout games.
---
They strive for self sufficiency, they operate their own businesses, they don‚Äôt enslave people, and their leadership has goals beyond simple raiding and pillaging. For all their flaws, the Crater is far more civil then the psychopaths that would come to occupy the West Coast in the future. 
---
So, in my opinion, calling them Raiders may be a bit of a stretch. I think it has more to do with branding. These are first generation Raiders, so all the usual tropes may not have just developed yet. They still embrace the brand though, because it contributes to their reputation.
---
Wow, if there's an indicator of how fucked up this game gets with high level players.
---
Alright thank you. Does it matter which side you choose first, are there any benefits for either side ? I am not tied either way.
---
You'll get a rep boost with the side you pick, and no consequence for the other side.
---
In what way?  They work properly, from what I can tell.
---
Finally caught you ingame ! Sry for stalking you for a Bit, and then the encryptid event popped up üòÇ had to leave the Server afterwards, my Camp wasnt able to be placed
---
That would be an cool end animation
---
You can still build up reputation for the Settlers after the Vault job, it's just you'll get a further boost to your Raiders reputation by picking them. Also some different ambient dialogue in Crater and Foundation, if you care about that.
---
Just to make sure, you've done enough Settlers quests to get the stealth suit plans, right? I assume you have from your post, but worth checking.
---
no, to me Deathclaw Island meant somewhere that several of them lived and they would‚Äôve been really scary to fight alone lol.. but then again a lot of times in 76 the tough fights are empty when you get to them lol
---
I'm loving that people that do use it finally buy all my .44 ammo
---
I keep telling the dataminers the true drop rates are 50/50. You either get it or you don't.
---
Bummer. Well I hope you find it quickly and cheaply!
---
Yep. That one's usually a glowing 60+, and spawns as legendary about half the time. Even caught him fighting a legendary Sheepsquatch once.
---
Somebody hire this guy right now
---
they won‚Äôt feel bad for you when they wake up lol
---
what‚Äôs a food build?
---
I would add that the people on the nuke owners team should all be first four slots. I have a group that I have been doing it with and after a few instances where one of us didn't get in we now wait to drop the nuke till we are all collectively ready to go in. Like literally the moment the event icon appears we all click it
---
I don‚Äôt mind the rate, you‚Äôd expect to get less than you put in in any game. But the interface is beyond stupid
---
Honestly, I don't think tenderizer is worth it except maybe for boss fights.  Idk.  I honestly can't tell when I have it off or on.
---
I want it to be nukeable in the future to reveal a cave filled with high level death laws and one massive deathclaw
---
The server crashes are due to something you do with the factory, not by placing and using them as they were intended .)
---
I feel like I'd have started talking on the microphone about "Man, I'm glad I have my level 3 thru-hiker and good with salt perks on for this event so I can just spam eating corn whenever I start running low on health. I have hundreds of cobs. I could just stand around eating corn all day long. Om nom nom!"
---
Heheh sounds like you didn‚Äôt blame someone elses health bar for it though so cheers üç∫
---
So u good with putting in a dollar and getting a quarter in return ?
---
Yep, teal enemy ship reaches the end.
---
Nope, I will not constantly keep reviving you and eat through my stimpaks because you have a bloodied build, carry almost no health and get killed often.  Once or twice at first maybe but if you keep dying after that, nope.
---
Especially given what a grind it is
---
So, I've been away from my XBox this week and haven't actually gotten the chance to fight Earle. We're going to try it tonight but here's the deal.
---
I've spent a LOT of time, a LOT of effort, and a LOT of gear/in-game currency to put together a low health build and loadout SPECIFICALLY to carry food builds through tough fights. That's the whole point of the build! That's my job in any encounter! And if I screwed that up, and I get owned down in that mine, then that's on ME. It certainly isn't the fault of anyone else in the event. I was in control of my own decisions when I ground out this build and I am the sole owner of the consequences. If anyone there is kind enough to revive me then that's awesome, I don't expect it. 
---
Question, how does power armor hold up down there? I know there's a lot of poison.
---
Isn't it having like dozens of them like that one picture showed off?
---
Well I got the suit int he underground cavern thingamajig, did I get plans, I am not sure ? 
---
I am at the foundation and it says if I continue I can not longer do any more raider quests, so I assume I have gone as far as I could. I then did all raider quests until just before the vault and it now says I can not longer do any more settler quests if I continue, so I assume I have gone as far as I can on both sides.
---
I have an ssd and still get fast travel bug constantly. Blue screen maybe once or twice a month
---
I sell most of my ammo in a vendor right next to the converter and have seen people buy me out, then sit at the converter for a few minutes. About the only stuff I hang onto for points is explosive ammo.
---
Right?
---
The raiders outfit award is much nicer than the foundation outfit.
---
Somebody downvoted it, I thought it was you lol. That's an excellent idea though! Destiny had all sorts of funky mechanics like that. One part of the raid was a jump puzzle, another was to do a series of events while holding down pilons as waves of enemies come to destroy them and ultimately, you. That was one thing destiny was REALLY good at was thinking up complex designs to keep people thinking, and finesse their way through end game content. There were real threats lurking around every corner. True end game. Don't get me wrong, I love just about everything about fallout 76, they just need an end game idea. Something unique and not so straight forward. Something to challenge players besides the typical, blast everything as hard as possible until it's dead. It needs some sort of complexity.
---
I hear you, but I'm trying to figure out what the difference is between us that you say "Earle is easy to solo" and I say "I'm not sure I even do damage to Earle." 
---
I've got all my damage buff perks, I use an AA handmade to pierce his armor, I even attack from stealth most of the time. The game says 52 on headshots and 30 on bodyshots, but the bar doesn't move. 
---
Do I need to start farming psychotats and calmex in order to reasonably contribute? 
---
Are Heavies legit so much better than rifles that they can solo enemies I can't even properly damage?
---
Is it some other factor I'm not aware of?
---
I. LOVE. THIS. MOD. No more SWARMIN' VERMIN, or headaches, or Mayor, or Watoga Announcer. You can decide which ones you want to hear or not. It is just.....blissfully silent! You will still hear the "beep" to tell you they are talking.....but nothing comes out!
---
Platform?
---
Yessssss. This is getting on my nerves as well... I came across a problem where the text of the item was so long that it couldn‚Äôt show me what weapon it was haha. I found if you just tap buy on it, it‚Äôll show you the name... but no mods unfortunately.
---
When I went to deathclaw island around level 15, doing the side quest from the amusement park, i was terrified, crouch walking all the way there to get the egg, and there wasnt even a deathclaw there.
---
I‚Äôm very happy with my standard, no epic legendary damage buff build right now. If they take that away and I‚Äôm just a shitbag pumping ammo into every enemy, I‚Äôm probably at my breaking point.
---
I'm not the dataminer who calculated the drop rates, but gilpo would catch something like that. He does factor those variables in when they are present, but they are not in this case. It's just a simple set of lists and sub-lists determined by event completion rate and RNG.
---
If I hear griping from a bloodied player on my team, I share sun kissed when they aren‚Äôt able to pay attention to the card swap.
---
Alright thanks. Probably doesn't make too much of a difference to me as I am a PA user .. but I will probably go with the Raiders, seems cooler anyway.
---
Nobody cares how long you've played the game, it adds nothing to the conversation.
---
Nobody said you needed my permission to have an opinion but you're posting in a public thread to which people can criticize your opinions so you should take that into consideration beforehand.
---
Whether or not something IS still around has nothing to do with whether or not we SHOULD or should not work on fixing/removing/etc...
---
You're seemingly incapable of understanding the arguments I'm making about your points.
---
I do not care if they nerf damage.  I think it'd be good for the game, sure, but it's not of any real importance to me, personally.
---
I do not care if they don't nerf it, either.
---
I am addressing the premises for your arguments and trying to tell you why they're bad drivers for why you should be critical of one thing and not the other.
---
"They developed it" is a bad metric.
---
"It's been in since day one" is a bad metric.
---
I'm not arguing whether or not your conclusion is wrong or invalidated but rather how you're arriving at the conclusion isn't a means in which to scrutinize the game and its flaws with any real consistency.
---
You don't have to leave, I found that out after my 5th time doing the event. When the timer finishes it will fast travel you inside the exit room automatically. LOOT THOSE SCREWS!
---
I just really hate her entitlement to "own" the Appalachia. It's supposed to be fucking huge, no single small group can own it. And the settlers are far enough that there's enough space for both. Additionally, the Raiders ran away, nullifying any claim that "we were here first".
---
Also, her attitude that her actions are somewhat justified and that they are not the bad guys is laughable. Her Raiders constantly talk about how they want to raid Foundation. How they killed some guys who defended themselves when being robbed. Or how Rocksy gives us the most reward when we KILL a guy who wanted to leave. This alone makes the raiders tons worse than the Settlers. Rocksy congratulates us on killing a guy who didn't do anything bad. Ward regrets that we had to kill a thief who was stealing from them. Simply put, the only think that makes these Raiders better than traditional Fallout Raiders is that these can be talked with.
---
Crater are still the evil raiders, no matter how they want to present themselves. If anything, it's the Free Radicals who are much better at being morally grey than the Crater and IMO Free Radicals should have been the other faction, antithesis to Foundation. It would work. Choosing between Foundation and Free Radicals would be less onesided than current choice. Free Radicals don't kill for fun. Sure, they shake up the settlers at Anchor Farm, but they don't kill them. They don't hang people's corpses around. And finally, they don't want to kill people who want to leave them. They see themselves as free, that includes the freedom to walk away.
---
Tinfoil hat time - I think that Free Radicals were supposed to be the original Raiders. The first Wastelanders trailer seemed to imply that Anchor Farm would be the hub for the Settlers. So it would be logical if the Raider hub was originally in the Forest as well - in the WV Lumberyard.
---
Log in, get my bullion, maybe scrip some shit, go visit Ward for my free notes, maybe do an event, and then log off to get to choring IRL.
---
Agreed. Depending on the event though it could be a progress bar, wave 2 of 3, or a countdown untill event expires from no one activating. But yeah in most cases it would be largely useless I believe.
---
No, not really.  The way the nerd works, only very high dps builds are being effected much.
---
they cant make up their minds, first its thier too OP they never die, they are immortal, then its, all they do is die and complain, then its back to them being immortal and OP, then back and forth.
---
boss gets one shotted or dies too fast? it was the bloodied guy, not the 'magic' EXPLOIT, or the hacked guns, or the fact that 15 people showed up to a two person event.
---
cant get what weapon roll you want? its the bloodieds fault because that "all anyone wants to trade for" despite there being fuckloads of trades for other prefixes
---
person is an asshole to you? their bloodied because only bloodied players are toxic shitheads
---
game broke? bloodieds fault, the damage broke the game
---
have cancer? bloodieds fault, they causes your cells inhibitors to fail
---
wife left you? bloodieds fault, they caused the rift in your marriage
---
corona? bloodieds fault, they caused the pandemic
---
...why didn't I think of that?
---
Nope it's all random which ones you lose
---
Nope, its basically rng, but you may get lucky .. I didn't lost a few ones I wanted to keep. I had bird bones I wanted to get rid.
---
Everytime you level up after 100 you should get 50-200 atoms
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying it. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt. Earle is awesome, the event is awesome. I just feel like bethesda used this event as a mega band aid for all the other problems. I also don‚Äôt want to take away from your post man, there‚Äôs a whole lot of other posts that my comment would have been better suited for but it‚Äôs early still I just barely had some coffee haha. I hope you keep having a good time, because for me at least playing in my favorite game universe is something I‚Äôm passionate about and the fact that my time is more consumed by bugs and glitches than the game itself really bothers me and I just wish bethesda saw it that way but no they only see dollar signs and numbers.
---
The real stinkers are people who join teams with one or two high-level bloodied builds on them just to 'share' that card.  I've seen that exactly once, with cries of "my rads, wtf." It took them an oddly long time to figure out their teammate was the reason.  (No, it wasn't me, but no microphone on PC so I couldn't tell them either...)
---
I just want those explosive fuckers from Harper's Ferry. Give me the ability to build those, and I'll be happy.
---
Hit Rank 100 a week or so ago, haven‚Äôt gone back on since. I‚Äôm loving the time I spend away for now.
---
Thanks for the info I did not know that
---
What they should have done, is given us a legit ammo factory instead of an ammo converter which is a POS.
---
Bloodied with all the other buffs will still do the most damage.  AA is going to be better though because all straight damage effects are being weakened.  But Bloodied will still be highest dps.
---
The fact that you need a nuke just to get in the mine is lame. That‚Äôs what dynamite is for. Even a Fat Man. They couldn‚Äôt have thought of a better way? Like a drop box requiring literally a set amount of dynamite for people to drop in? Give the rubble a health bar and just blow it up using  a ton of explosives on it until it breaks? 
---
It‚Äôs a sunny day and after an hour of rigging, you and your fellows adventurers wipe the sweat from your brows and blast through the rubble. For just a moment after the breach, you swear you hear something from deep within the mine. As if the mine itself was angered by the commotion. Warning you. You brush the idea off. Likely just tremors from the breach. As you and your team enter, you‚Äôre greeted with the cool dark dampness of this forgotten place. Time to search for Earl‚Äôs remains and find out what happened to him.‚Äù 
---
Nope. Just launch a nuke.
---
I found 3 or 4 violet flux in the mountains directly east of monongah mine. I was coming down from the north around the middle of the mountains running side to side to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss anything.
---
Take off Starched Genes and start downing straight RadAway. You will see them come off but it is random which one it removes. So go slow and have others on hand to take that you don't want to lose.
---
Lmao that's a dirty trick ü§£ü§£ seriously though I'm a bloodied player, I wasn't for a very long time (played since the beginning, last 4 months been bloodied) I do t understand the whinning food builds can pack a punch
---
How do yo do the double wall glitch?
---
NP
---
Lol, there are platforms on the sides of the shaft, thats some pro-level dieing.
---
Yea it's there alot or a glowing one.
---
On one hand I'm happy to be free to do whatever I want. On the other hand I like the structure it gave to me. I liked playing Nucler Winter for the challenges. Currently I'm playing for the Meat Week events, but after that I'll probably take a break.
---
If only the challenges did something after hitting 100. For example making rank 100 repeatable with some currency or Atoms as a reward.
---
I mean it's more damage stacking which is what OP was after. I run 1 point in it which is minimal in the setup. Works well for fast firing weapons - I guess if you're not firing fast within the 5 seconds it's pretty useless, but with commando it's a good perk. I also heard if I'm not mistaken it's 5% damage of all your stacking damage not just the base of the weapon.
---
I don't want to invalidate your experience with the game because you've lived it but this is probably the nicest community of any game I've ever played. I've run into a few people that were pretty douche-y but for the most part they're not only nice but often helpful. Sorry if you keep running into jerks though, that really does suck.  
---
" TL;DR: game based on random loot, rely on other players for the items you want. Community finds ways to build trap bases, scam players, dupe items that will later be removed, steal from people's stash with bugs. Private servers added just to get away from other people "  
---
I mean the random loot thing is what it is... that's just a lot of games in general. If it's any consolation as you level up you find you don't need these god tier items because nothing is that difficult. Specific loot is hard to find but you aren't unlikely to get high-tier rolls from the purveyor or drops at least once a week that you can sell. As for the people exploiting/duping they are a small sub-section of the community but if you play on PC you likely see that more than I do (xbox).

Put two doors back to back then replace them both with walls.

Damn it, I JUST got a vampire ultracite gatling for colossal problem.

ugh i do this almost everytime like a noob

Make nukes great again

Deathclaw stops being scary in 4.

Those digging bastards, on the other hand, just got more scarier than ever. Radscorpions, Mole Rats, pick your poison.

Yeah, from what I played of Destiny 1 they had a lot of special raid boss puzzles and mechanics so it‚Äôs jut not pull out your strongest gear and go to town and see if you have the patience and ammo to just hold down or press the trigger the whole time. And I remember in D1 one friend and I would try to focus on the minions? Fodder? So the more DPS heavy friends can focus the boss since if you just ignored them they‚Äôd mess you up pretty well.
---
I was playing drums and the whole thing just disappeared at noon. 11 was the last one.
---
Lol. Changing the damage formula is the solid foundation....
---
I know lol. The point was he wasn't moving.
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
So newb question, should I just toss out the prime meat I have then?
---
It's happened once but I noticed straight away as I read a post on hear earlier that day, no whinning or complaining going on, I think they were just genuinely using that perk , he got kicked none the less lol
---
Well after 22 it will be just the base weapon, but I kill any non boss enemy so quickly, I literally take longer to rev up my gun than I do to kill an enemy.
---
Better yet, they need to fix the timer to enter the event (why does the event disappear when one group starts the event?), fix the respawn timer (because idk why players are punished for dying up to 45 second timeout), fix the respawn glitch, put players inside if they die post earle's death (so they have a chance at the red trunk, fix the issues that if you disconnect from server, you can rejoin the event with your group, etc.
---
There's a personal cool down timer to prevent people from launching one nuke after another, you can do alpha or bravo, just not Charlie
---
6 days is not a week. I miss you already, Chally.
---
thanks for asking, i came here to find this out.  never heard the term before.
---
It's been real.
---
Nope, why not end it an hour earlier then?
---
Melee is broken and is being fixed.
---
Nice pics
---
They do actually have one, but you need to get max rep with raiders for whatever reason. Should've been both sides TBH
---
No. There's a second week in September.
---
one-shot killing the Deathclaw is kind of a rite of passage, but on reflection, it is very sad.  The Deathclaws got no love from B in FO76.   They went from Apex predator to has been.  :(
---
It's a sad day. Watching Grahmn and Chally pack up and continue with their normal route. 
---
They'll be back, they always come back....
---
You know Bethesda, over-promising and under-delivering..
---
I never had before. Nice photojournalism!!!
---
[X] Doubt
---
Sounds like they did.
---
I get what youre saying and I kill things pretty fast too, but OP was looking for help doing damage because he feels the enemies are bullet sponges, so this perk will definitely help. May not be useful for you, but it would be for him.
---
There's a lot more xp to be had in the PTS because of higher level enemies.  I could tell by how much score for it I was getting.  I think everyone will be happy with that.
---
Fence post error FTW, I‚Äôm guessing.
---
do you run mutations? double check your class-freak is working.  I have to re-add it every time i login/server hop b/c it stops working.  which makes a huge difference in my ability to stay alive
---
TIL I am a "food build"
---
Though it would be more accurate to call it a Scrap Build since I decided scrap no longer goes in the stash and now I'm carrying over 2K steel
---
Yeah, that's true.
---
Fall damage? What is that?
---
100%. There needs to be a game plan and tactical focus. I really liked the idea of the SBQ when I first heard of it, described as needing 8 people. I thought that was so awesome this game had end game that required a mob of people to hang up on this boss. Sadly, it was just a bullet sponge.
---
Well sorry my opinion doesn't meet your personal specifications for correct or incorrect. I'll just have to live with that failure.
---
Not sure how that applies to this situation, but OK.
---
&gt; Noooooooooooo 
---
I think you mean 'Moooooooooooo'
---
But Primal Cuts went off....? Oh lord, Bethesda.
---
Yes, people placing them at industrial scale, especially more than one person doing it on a server, will drastically impact server stability. The system is designed and optimized around having only one of them running at any given time; multiple people running dozens of factories each doesn't come without a cost.
---
When you get Fallout First, you agree to in doing so, you still won't use any exploits or glitches. 
---
So it doesn't matter what you come up to justify your cheating. It's that simple. I don't care how much ammo you have, or whatever. I doesn't effect my game. 
---
But it doesn't change the fact those that do it, are cheaters. And cheaters won't stop at harmless cheats.
---
Finally I can have my life back!
---
Sounds like you should have the plans if you've been to that underground place. It's just it costs you a lot of a certain resource to get the plans later if you haven't, but sounds like you're all good.
---
I'm not sure I understood how curtains factor into the trap but stacked punjis are absolutely an exploit and probably the worst as far as griefing goes. If enough of them are glitched together they will be an instant kill if you so much as graze them. They've tried to patch this a couple times but they continue to be a nuisance.
---
These are the moments when I worry why Bethesda ever listens to us on combat balancing.
---
Newbie here. Why do I keep seeing the quest death from above?
---
Lol, it looks like a nerf because it IS a nerf. 
---
Maybe they should buff the ammosmith perk in the same patch so we can pump 20k rounds into bosses. Weapon condition too, while they're at it. Just for now, you know, to give us a better path going forward.
---
It's also weird that one of the final rewards - the game board wall decor -- is so buggy!  I can't place it on a wall that has wallpaper?!
---
That sucks.  Seems we regularly have open slots on PC.
---
Nah Graham decided to go vegan, didn‚Äôt you hear?
---
I do what I want and I get 10 meat Tenderizer plans while doing it
---
My favorite event... And I had to work‚òπÔ∏è. Done maybe 4 meat-cooks in total this year. Its a sad Day.
---
Ah, ok. Still, they could have solved that better. Everyone came to the scene, event quest started, stage vanished, that's it.
---
The double sided walls also count as a technical exploit and so do various other camp building techniques.
---
Bethesda will try to pin the blame on the user, the fact is the server stability is horrendous no matter what. They need to start sorting stuff out. Take keys for example, you pick it up, use it once and its useless. Yet we still have to haul round all that data.
---
Always ended on the 26th.
---
I haven't run into any issues on xbox.
---
... see nuke inbound (this is easier if you drop it yourself), stop what you're doing for 2 min (not a big ask esp if you are specifically targeting the event) join in as soon as nuke drops and event pops...
---
full server of high levels, empty server with nothing but newbs, has not failed me yet. 
---
Were you distracted? working on something else?  I was told above all else if you want in don't delay, and to prioritize getting in as soon as it pops.  that said... if you don't get into instance one, another instance should start... you just might be left without YOUR crew...
---
Why don‚Äôt they just patch you being able to make the blueprint instead of out right banning people? Also how long are the bans for?
---
Great pics, thanks
---
I have the ammo converter, and the ammo appliance next to each other in my camp.  The ammo appliance cranks out 200 5.56 in less than an hour, and every time I hit 2,000 I dump it into the converter, and get the flamer fuel I really want, but can't make with the ammo appliance.
---
I mean...it is a game board.
---
When I get shitcanned in Monopoly nothing really happens I just get laughed at
---
If those people stayed on private servers, I'd agree: do whatever you want with your character that never goes public. But manufacturing 200K 5.56 in your private instance, then dropping that on your vendor in a public instance for quick cash is not only unfair to the people who have to work for their caps, it also significantly destabilizes an already broken economy. 
---
There's also a point to be made about how an effectively infinite ammo supply in a game where ammo production requires materials and otherwise has weight is hardly an intended mechanic. But again, if you want to do that on a private server, that's your prerogative... as long as you stay there.
---
He just tried one of the Impossible Whoppers at BK and decided he didn‚Äôt need meat any more...
---
I can confirm, I'm on Xbox, and noticed the day after the patch yesterday was it?  The 1GB patch that was just released this week.  Night before the patch, I was working at my camp, looked at my budget, saw I had enough space to maybe place down 5-6 more things, very next day after patch, went right into build mode, at max space, something in build mode has increased.
---
Deathclaw would be logical.
---
Yes
---
Bruh, they killed each other.
---
I do, is this why day after the recent patch I'm at max too?
---
Oh no, doesn't she know the Sheepsquatch would absolutely win 1v1?!
---
And? I didn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ok with those did I? 
---
In fact on that subject I have said this. You can‚Äôt be against using exploits and then say, the double sided walls are ok. But Bethesda has said they fine with them. Promoted camps that use glitches like this.
---
And it‚Äôs their call, not mine. But I e also said Bethesda needs to introduce double sided walls for camps. So that way players don‚Äôt have to glitch their camps.
---
And none of my camps use glitches.
---
There's "design" to this?  This engine feels more like it happened, than was designed.
---
They tried adding fodder to it (all the scorched enemies) but if you fight the SBQ out of the nuke zone hardly any spawn and most aren‚Äôt anything to write home about especially with 8 people. I keep telling my friend that I feel sorry for the normal scorched beasts that spawn during the queen event because they just get absolutely obliterated by the people and then there‚Äôs the level like 5 radroaches. More annoying then we need people to focus on the fodder then the boss and there is no special mechanic. 
---
Most of the time the SBQ doesn‚Äôt do the sonic blasts she only really attacks when she lands and that‚Äôs melee so if you‚Äôre far away enough she poses 0 danger herself.
---
AHH now I know that as well. I'm not exactly new to FO76 but I never really gave it a thought, I just presumed those people were lazy to make an account name or something xD I gotta admit those names make me uneasy too, but not really, I've met some nice people with names like this.
---
Whoa that is a good catch. Pretty cool
---
I launched a nuke with a guy and we ended up on different teams.  We only had 4 but we took down Earle.  On our way out afterwards we go caught in a nuke someone else launched 
---
He ended up by himself and spent the whole event farming screws.   I joined him.  Found out what happens when you lose the event first hand.
---
He just ordered a salad from slocum joes and realised that he dosent need meat
---
Should be like opening 4 lunchboxes all at once and have confetti shoot all around you. Nothing too major, but fun.
---
Or even theme it. It's a space board game so instead of confetti have mini comets and stars flying around you.
---
Would allow you to get near a group and it would be clear. Like getting a level 99 in runescape.
---
I agree with the stay on private servers part. Lock them out of Adventure mode like they can do for Nuke Winter.
---
Unless you were not in the silo for that 1 hour then idk
---
A silo takes all of 10 minutes to get to Launch Prep once you get familiar with it.
---
I never accused it of being an intelligent design. :)
---
I was, yes. No idea how that qualifies for downvotes but Reddit is Reddit...
---
No, at least currently in PTS, enemies are still pushovers.
---
It was fun.  I'm glad we're getting a "second serving".
---
I guess I'm a softy, but I like the affection Grahm has for his Moo Moo.  "Who's not gonna eat da meat?  Chaaaaally"
---
They seem to be adding something like this in PTS.
---
And here I thought this was going to talk about yet another thing they destroyed on the CAMP builder
---
I‚Äôve never heard anyone use the term ‚Äúfood build‚Äù. Haha. You‚Äôre making stuff up. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwater farm, shitty aimer vats, constant camp rebuild‚Äù build.
---
I like that it has multiple angles to it.  Yes, Earle is a big bullet sponge.  But there's also this constant risk-reward of going around and looting the Wendigo Spawns with the collapsing ceiling, which is totally worth doing, unlike anything the SBQ has to offer.
---
I had thought they were new to the game, but nope. Just Far Harbor ports.
---
This exact same thing happened to me last time. I'm sitting on the drum waiting for the event to start, it hits the hour, and everything vanishes like a players camp that left the server, and I drop to the grass not realizing the last run was the LAST one.
---
I‚Äôm actually a little relieved it‚Äôs over.  Frantically doing primal cuts and it bugging out all the time....grahams cookoffs not even starting.  It was fun but I would rather be doing other stuff now.  Try a 2nd shot at ACP maybe... first one didn‚Äôt go so well lol.
---
A double please for a plan of the middle drum, I like the way it sounds.
---
You can try out one month to see if you like it and the atoms are nice bonus.
---
I share healing hands and wait for them to get downed lol
---
Yes!  Will copy you next time I'm at my camp.
---
Literally the first time I hear about people complaining on food buildd
---
Is it really such a bad thing if event items get out to oversaturate the market? I know the duping is bad...but on the other hand if it means everyone has a chance at getting all the event items without paying an arm and a leg I don't think it's all that bad of a thing.
---
Yes, it's over.
---
Strange. Inside the vault said the last one would be at noon but I can understand Bethesda not giving the correct timing. I did the one at 11am and didn't try the one at noon.
---
Was going to post this.
---
I usually play with my 13-year-old son, I spend the majority of events reviving him and anyone else I can.
---
Yeah, I really hate creatures with that stagger effect, especially Yao guais, they indeed aren't that lethal but very annoying.
---
I‚Äôm pretty close to the end.  Still need the fireplace, and the very last marker.
---
If you look at the atom value, you're mostly getting the benefits for about ¬£5 and the atoms at the cheapest rate possible too. So I feel it's worth it - cuz I would have like to buy atoms anyway.
---
I'm playing a lot at the moment so I get its worth. It's great running around grabbing EVERYTHING and popping up a tent and scrapping it all.
---
There's all this specialized gear too that doesn't need to be much of a focus either. Destiny had loads of specialist gear that you basically had to have for every instance you went into. 76 is stick to one build and hit hard af, anddd game. I love that they brought fallout to the MMO genre, but things certain aspects definitely needed change. Public events are good, but not all that worth doing.
---
I love the event (PS4) done it 6 times the first got a server disconnect , after that they‚Äôve all been fine although on the last we did get down to about 2 minutes left.
---
I actually start to feel nervous in the lobby before we drop down, that‚Äôs how it should be ..
---
I play as a shotgunner, drop in cripple Earle , deal with any wendigos, cripple Earle again, then go back to wendigos ..repeat until the end
---
An hour ago I went in with 200 rounds left with 600, and probably fired over 200 
---
Just wish I wouldn‚Äôt keep getting bone hammers! And got more flux
---
Yes! i remember when playing Fallout 3 and New vegas and hearing anything related to Deathclaw meant going to hell, Quarry Junction in NV was creepy af, and even in Fallout 4 the Witchcraft Museum quest was scary... then in 76, you touch Deathclaws and they die, and there's not a single instance for them to appear scary or anything.
---
Trading any of those?
---
I can still hear graham. I miss him.
---
üôÅ till next time
---
finished yesterday, honestly glad it's over. assuming you \*do\* want to enjoy / obtain the bulk of the new content released the last few months, then you're gonna do it - no real way around it. i feel like having to do it every day has fundamentally changed the way i play and i've been doing a speedrun every 24 hours for like 2 months or whatever it is. having to level up every single day means i've now got all these over leveled characters who've barely seen most of the gameworld, or my last resort create / delete toon to do the wayward run (which is also getting old fast), or my basic gameplay loop is just doing the same 2 or 3 events till i never want to see them again.
---
if i want to just hang around a camp and chill out or build - nope, gotta go grind events. if i want to explore - nope, i'm too busy racking up the legendary wolf kills. i basically finish ticking off the boxes, and i'm ready to log out with no real time left to play how i would've done if not for the required score loop.
---
some of the dailies will eventually become pretty much unworkable too - there's only so many times you can reasonably expect to level up per day forever, or build lots of objects in your camp which is already full or close to it, and all of that to obtain a bunch of camp items which i pretty much can't place anyway due to hitting the max budget.
---
they absolutely need to change how this works, perhaps making all score tasks be weekly only and adjust values gained appropriately. every day is just too much, and i'm actually \*relieved\* i no longer have to log in for a while. bethesda should probably be a bit concerned that achieving 100 is making me go off and do something else instead. if it stays the same, then i've got no interest in trying to do this again next season. i'm so burnt out it's unreal.
---
You will when the nerf comes or ACP won't be doable.
---
Wow I knew those floaters are sneaky bitches but didn‚Äôt realize they could drain my fusion cores! 
---
When vats obviously misses when it says high chance, I simple get out of it and either manually aim or re-engage vats, it seemed always worked that way. I read a lot about rubberbanding but strangely i haven‚Äôt encountered it myself.
---
I carry multiple weapons on my character for this very reason. Bloodied is not an option, instigating, or anti armor are their to compensate. I get that people want to make the cookie cutter one shot, but sacrificing a little power for versatility goes a long way.
---
I wouldn't call the event challenging, its a pretty simple battle. Earle has no mechanics that make him difficult, he is just a tank. The Wendigos that spwan endlessly are just cannon fodder that get midly annoying if the event happens to go on long enough. The only other part is avoiding hazards placed around the compact area. 
---
The loot isn't anything special, and it will only take a few runs before all of the unique loot is collected by everyone. Then there's all the bugs with the event that persist after months of testing and feedback, which will no doubt take more months to be fixed. I personally believe that many players are in a honeymoon phase with the event right now because its new. The same thing happened with Encryptid and Project Paradise when they were new too. 
---
The event is cool, and it can be fun to play when you aren't hit with bugs or a bad team, but overall it isn't amazing. Maybe someday Bethesda can figure out how to properly create a biss battle with engaging mechanics that utilize more than one build type and encourage actual teamwork over just having everyone show up and unload all the ammo they can until the boss dies.
---
I sell most ammo I pick up out of my vending machine, but I find it quite useful for disposing of missiles, 40mm grenades, arrows, and crossbow bolts. I find enough of these that I've built up 30-40k ammo points without even trying. Or if I see somebody dump a shitload of .38 rounds on the ground or something, I trade it in.
---
Normally I just let the ammo build up until I have enough to cash in the 10X trade, then do it all at once, except for missiles.
---
ROFLOL, the Lv. 40 "Bloodied," who doesn't have the perks needed to even be that.
---
That said, I've actually died on that opening drop even though I touched both platforms on the way down.  It's almost like there's this disconnect between the server and the client over where the player physically is (see also: why it's so damn hard to melee an enemy that's running away from you), and the server thinks I didn't touch the platform and decides to kill me a couple seconds after the fact.  You really do need to land, pause for a moment, then go to the next one.
---
...instead, the Tenderizer plan went to that guy that thought, ‚Äúwhat is this useless crap?!  I wanted that cool cow costume.  Damn meat week.‚Äù  LoL
---
Sorry, I know how you feel.  I felt the same way.
---
I love reviving people! As soon as I see that cry for help I sprint over immediately and slam dunk that stimpak into them lol.
---
Bethesda has known about it for a long time. I believe it‚Äôs been around for over a year. This is more on Bethesda for not acting than it is on the players. Also it isn‚Äôt much of an exploit. It is simply using the blueprint mechanic to copy it.
---
That‚Äôs how every RPG and video game with a buy/sell system in the history of video games have worked
---
screenshot of the plushie? i only play Reddit 76.
---
What we need is freaking text chat. If we had it, we would all be communicated between each other.
---
Same
---
Noon Greenland time I guess
---
I drop nukes and get about a whole minute into the hot zone and my xbox freezes.  If i reboot for every session, it doesnt happen AS OFTEN...
---
Anyone else get booted from their own nuke zones?  
---
I totally get your frustration on being excluded....
---
If it was me, i might get into the event, but my nukaquota runs out in minutes
---
Is the inclusion in the event based on jumping down the mine shaft, or is it just getting into the mine?
---
I'm going to miss my salvage operations at the Primal Cuts locations.
---
Better than my experience where there wasn't even a deathclaw all there
---
It‚Äôs just getting old. I wasn‚Äôt even against the nerf, I just didn‚Äôt like that we were dropped so low and the only response has ever been ‚Äúbut DPS,‚Äù I‚Äôve played enough mmo‚Äôs with bloodied or berserker builds that do pretty equivalent amounts of dmg at a similar cost and the community never complains as much as f76‚Äôs. And I don‚Äôt think ppl realize that by letting this nerf take so much all they‚Äôre doing is killing one more build that can even attempt to challenge the dps of magic weapons. So now ACP will just be that much harder for 8ppl while magic users farm kills on their private server. 
---
Too many ppl see a ss of some huge number that‚Äôs just our standard damage and not considering that it‚Äôs perks like revenant, food buffs, and dozens of other items available to everyone. Until ppl start acknowledging that they don‚Äôt really understand what bloodieds actually do, it just turns me off to wanting to discuss a truly balanced nerf...
---
This was the exact problem I had the last two times with the actual Tenderizer. The plan dropped on my second run of the event üôÉ
---
Now that's a campfire tale! Solid effort lads üëç
---
 It's definitely a different experience with a small team though, I did it yesterday with a team of 3 (lvl 270 or so, 120 something, and me 194)
---
It's not just misses.  Sometimes I even get hit markers for no damage.
---
And rubber banding is more common when you get stupid dps.  If you one shot it doesnt happen as much regardless of dps. At least in my experience.
---
I got a bunch of Chally outfits and backpack plans and no Meat Tenderizer plan :c
---
Yah, they work...ish. The other day my vendors and display cases all suddenly emptied themselves back into my stash. 
---
I, too, would like to inspect that Anti-Armor Tactical Reinforced C.....What is it, Bethesda??? Huh????
---
Mire maps
---
No, there is an exploit for SCORE, that will crash the server and keep the completed Challenge from being registered as completed on the server side, yet the exploiter keeps the score.
---
So the exploiter can effectively repeat the challenge as often as wanted.
---
Odd only because we assign it that title.  RNG doesn't care about what it spits out.
---
Yeah I do really like colossal problem, I think it's more fun than SBQ
---
i don't use two handed melee, so i lucked out in the sense i got most everything else.  got the cow outfit (head and body), grill, and backpack.
---
i'm sure they'll turn up in a vendor eventually.
---
I wouldn't be surprised xD 
---
Saw a guy who had 3, wouldn't sell one to me because I was 1k caps short of having 12k hahah
---
Wow thanks for the nice tip! So the rush to exit is really for cinematic purpose then, which is great too! I never had a chance to pick up any screws even though i mass murdered those spawns, now I‚Äôll take my time!
---
Meat week...in the title brah
---
Oh my god! I can‚Äôt believe it
---
Underarmor or secret service
---
You‚Äôre really nice for doing that !
---
You need to get out of there before the battle ends though, because that spot will instantly kill you.
---
As you probably know, the escape route loops back around to the top of the shaft.  For some reason, Bethesda was really obsessed about making sure people with jetpacks or whatever couldn't escape through the shaft, so they arbitrarily plugged it up with rocks and instakill anyone standing there.  For no good reason, that I could tell.  I mean, one, there aren't many players who would take that route anyway.  And two, *so what* if they do?  You already have no consequence for staying in the mine and looting - it doesn't count as a formal death - so why be so heavy-handed about this other aspect?
---
Ok, I'm not familiar with how it runs.. if you see the Colossal Problem event, is it open to ONLY one group of 8?  Or can multiple groups run it?
---
It went to the guy AFKing on the drums all week...
---
Looks like everyone‚Äôs running herd mentality on this sub
---
Welcome to the world of every pvp‚Äôer, bloodied, and socially challenged asshole on here lol
---
I really like this, great work. Just out of curiosity, was it my post that you saw?
---
Double the hp, double the defense, double the speed, double the attack, double everything!
---
Some events do have a timer running even if no one has joined, and many times, I've arrived when there is not enough time to complete the event.
---
Same here but I have the Tenderiser weapon and me being too much of a loot whore was hoping to have the plan so if I got rid of it I can get it back xD
---
We need to get the Federal Trade Commission involved due to the false advertising.
---
Excellent well done to you and your little buddy!
---
I go into events with the best of intentions. Sometimes you leave a hero and other times a villain, there's no inbetween.
---
I will gladly pay $15 a month for access to the scrap box and private servers lol
---
Rest assured you aren't alone in feeling this way. We all also agree this new event is awesome. More like this in a timely manner would sure help heal wounds any band aids are covering.
---
That is true
---
Thats cannon now
---
Sounds like an epic battle! Congrats on your victory.  
---
Colossal Problem kicking off is a bug.  The event will stay active for about four minutes.  So if you can kill the Queen fast enough, you get both events for one nuke.
---
I've tried 3 times and have had the same issue. Third time I thought we had it, but a few people bailed midway through. He had the smallest sliver of health when the time ran out... I was so disappointed lol.
---
F that thing! Kill it with fire!
---
Maybe, but that Worker hat is the coolest hat in the game.
---
Yup. There was a build budget glitch, basically those generators cost less budget to build than the standard ones, so people were building them, swapping them for the standard, then scrapping them to free up build budget. They‚Äôve changed the budget value to be correct now, but that causes your budget to be off currently until you scrap enough of your current budget.
---
Oh maybe that‚Äôs why, my current favorite is a Railway and it hit literally like a train, most small enemies are dead in one shot, tougher ones won‚Äôt survive a short burst. They didn‚Äôt get a chance to rubberband me.
---
Yes, thank you, I know full well the real life history of where they came from.  But Wendigos are NO LONGER human, just like Super Mutants aren't human. Nor are Robobrains human just because they have a human brain. Sorry, but anyone saying Wendigos are human or should be treated as human for Perks/weapon effects is grossly wrong.
---
Congratulations man, I do have the weapon. It's okay but I believe there are better. Though with legendary effects it will be a good weapon üò∫
---
you go right ahead
---
I'm on PC and if I want to leave world I just click on the top right corner of the social menu (near the faction rep). It gives me an option to Leave team or leave world.
---
Life? I have to do something other than work, sleep and meat week?
---
See you guys when fasnacht is back
---
Which one, there's been like 3 to 4 at each event üòÇ
---
Class Action time!
---
Complaining 101
---
Lol
---
Yes, now every region of the map needs such an event as well, so people will have a reason to nuke all of the other regions. Two down...
---
*STINGWING QUEEN HAS ENTERED CHAT*

steel into 5.56 and .45, brilliant

It's very bugged, but very weird.  Tried placing it on several walls last night, with various wallpapers and the results were all over the place.  Never placed on some, sometimes placed on others.
---
Idle drums for camps please. Real mvp of meat week. I need these for home base.
---
Is that in a vault?  I mean I'm all for it but I think that the commission might find it challenging to explain the concept to Grahm.  I mean they might be able to say something like "Humans mad!  Want more meat!  Week is 7 not 6!"  Possibly they should consider employing a human to Super Mutant Translator.
---
sorry for the instant heart attack situation but this is hilarious
---
Since there was only 4 of us it was easy to notice what he was doing, he died multiple times i revive him where we drop, one time he actually died spawn up there, and RAN to the hole, dropped looked around then stood still, I know the respawn bug and that wasn‚Äôt it.
---
Had someone drop tenderizer plan. Best thing I've ever found in a paper bag
---
Yeah, it will spoil
---
Was waiting for the responder PA. Had to appear Right when i fuckin bought the red menace skin.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, WE'RE GONNA DO IT!!!
---
How the hell is a bloodied build complaining about food builds? Bloodied works BEST with food mutations and honestly I'd be worthless without it. 
---
Probably would be dying as much as the fella you encountered.
---
Edit: After some reading apparently "food build" doesn't involve carnivore or herbivore mutations... why do games like this have to have the most moronic and random terms to describe things? Like in a game where eating is a viable source for buffs then why the hell would of all things you choose "food" to describe players who don't min max?
---
Duped Christmas gifts seem to be the easiest way
---
I got two of them. Harhar!
---
Couldn‚Äôt the lvl22 act as a bait for little minions at least ü§î
---
Stopped doing primal cuts altogether. With enough people playing the drums and turning the spit, its pretty easy to complete the event just by cleaning up poop, picking greens, and killing critters.
---
You do realize its a nerf to ALL builds that used multiplicative damage boosts, not just bloodied.
---
Bloodied just see's the biggest hit because it leverages the most multipliers.
---
Also none of your gear will suddenly be useless when the damage recalc happens, bloodied still reigns king, you'll just do different damage that previously. 
---
And with One wasteland there is a decent chance you will barely notice the change in some enemies.
---
Im honestly kinda looking forward to it, rather than the current state where 90% of people one tap everything at events, hopefully legendary mobs can last long enough for more people to get tags.
---
I don't think the tenderizer had a plan did it? Luckily I found one someone just left on the ground and gave it to my GF, now she just attacks me with it :c
---
That‚Äôs really bad luck. Statistically speaking you should have got it
---
I play daily, literally seven days a week.  Anywhere from 1-8 hours at a time.  $100 a year for infinite scrap box and survival tent is certainly worth it to me. 
---
I rarely use the private server.  I don‚Äôt spend a lot of atoms so the daily challenges took care of that for me.  But now we don‚Äôt have atoms from dailies, so I see that as added value I guess.
---
No. But if you want to get it, go ahead.
---
Also try to make it so that people can fight outside the rad zone , it‚Äôs easier and more people will turn up
---
Or realise that you don't need it and get on with playing the game?
---
Just figured it would go till noon at least.
---
The only excuse I could see for this would be being a low level. With mods such as Perk Loadout Manager that allows you to hotswap in 2-3 seconds, there's no reason to be on QoL perks when you're in a combat situation/dungeon. 
---
(Still though, that dude was a dick.)
---
Do it on a private server.
---
have to buy the Plan and then read it.
---
Best solution that benefits ALL handguns no matter playstyle:
---
Increase the weakspot multiplier for handguns by 1.5-2√ó. So for example headshots would deal 3.5- 4x damage instead of 2x. This makes up for lower base damage and capacity. 
---
Add this as a mechanic, not a perk card.
---
I got two the mods and everything else
---
Goddamnit. I attended every meat-cook event I possibly could (played all weekend, and every afternoon during the week), and I still did not get that tenderizer plan. I got a plan for a spicy mod, and about a thousand chally the moo moo clothing pieces, but no tenderizer plan. I REALLY wanted that. A bloodied tenderizer would be amazing.
---
Its such a dick move, but as soon as a bloodied on our public team starts being an ass, I put rad sponge on and follow them around until they leave. I have only had a bad experience with a Bloodied Bully twice.
---
He spawned up there after dying multiple times and he runs and drop back then stand still, again I know the respawn bug and that wasn‚Äôt it
---
That would be a colossal waste of money, a week might literally mean 7 days but in marketing, business, transportation and so on. A week can be 5-7
---
I wish there was a robe sort of clothing that could work with masks, could be great for mole miner outfits. 
---
Or in my case since I have the firemans axe as my main weapon: Reaper fire fighter.
---
Another 2 cents here. Yep definitely does. I have it on Xbonx and use SSD and it loads nice and quickly.
---
We just got the sleazy bed and something else since the bog outfit was released.
---
Nope it had a plan this year. Had like a 2% drop rate
---
...
---
Food build?
---
If no one complained, the game would still have every single bug from launch.
---
I‚Äôm wondering if instanced interiors will be a basement or a cellar door foundation. If so I‚Äôd enjoy it more. Allow me to make my communist character have a more secretive upper dwelling and then the lower instanced sub levels.
---
 Very true.  You know what, when I did grahams cookout last night and donated my primal cuts, it didn‚Äôt award me with any scrip either.
---
Wait it was? Now I'm even more sad :(
---
Haha, I don‚Äôt care who you are, that there‚Äôs funny!!!
---
It works as intended. Whether it‚Äôs worth it is up to you
---
It definitely changed the way people played the game. I also like to build and explore, and then do SBQ or Colossus now.
---
I've been making trap bases [since the game was released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnoZSsVyO58&amp;list=PLd9ZJI1zOOMM6fckdpUZ2UlLa9mA4F5dy) some of which are [well known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwelJNlyaiA). Trap bases (or games and puzzles that use traps) can be fun\* (note the asterisk) as well as interesting. This is partly owed to the fact that this is the only real thing you can build that both interacts with other players and also "does something" where camps are typically static entities.
---
Where the asterisk comes in is that depending on the motives of the creator the line between fun/interesting and asshole-ry is rather thin. My own philosophy is for the traps to be funny or challenging (with a way to escape or beat them) and not to take anyone's junk. This isn't everyone's philosophy but I think it factors heavily into how fun they are.  
---
In the early days of camp building trap camps were built around the use of flamers, teslas and rad emitters. These are expensive components that are also difficult to wire in a way that they're actually effective. In addition to this, back in those days players had the option of destroying the camp at the cost of a bounty (or simply fast traveling away).  
---
Over the last few months we've seen an increase in the prevalance of "stacked punji boards" which abuses the cumulative damage mechanics of this camp object to essentially kill someone instantly. These are instant deaths with very little cost or skill associated with their usage. Moreover, the ability to destroy a person's camp has long since been removed, so users don't have any recourse to escape (if they weren't insta-killed). Because of this the majority of trap camps don't exist as a novel example of camp mechanics but as an efficient method of farming junk through a glitch. Bethesda has tried to patch this at least twice now but ways to stack the punji boards have followed every time.  
---
The tl;dr is: Trap camps can be fun/funny and interesting but that depends highly on the builder and given the current mechanics chances are if it's based around the punji glitching it's not any of those things
---
Yeah, seemed dumb to give us another bunch of Primal Cuts events and then no opportunity to actually hand in the prime meat!
---
I‚Äôll have to check it out. Thanks!
---
I take them then leave ..
---
Or some broken legacy that makes everyones audio shit the bed.
---
Great idea!
---
Claim while being in stealh, stay close to the limit of the claim area, and if the workshop have a building or something similar, get in
---
Welcome to Fallout 76, the online experiment testing the negation of Wheaton's Law.
---
Yeah, I saw this yesterday as well. Posted a picture to my friends because I didn't realize they could be ghouls
---
Just saw him! Outside alpha right?
---
I'm totally a food build then. I just have perks for what makes the game most fun for me, not optimized at all for best combat (other than sneak cause I love sneaking and sniping). So I suck at the kind of events that are just bullet sponges (where you can't sneak and get an advantage). I usually  just don't do them though (I did get a gun or two now specifically for doing the scorch beast queen but I gotta have enough ammo before I bother doing it even with that).
---
Use:  
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)   
---
Then folks don't have to access your google drive =)
---
Yeah like I said I‚Äôm bloodied, commando specifically.  And I have soloed ACP, granted I died a lot, but if you take ur time and crit vats a lot u can do it.   But high health builds or vampire weapons users prob have the highest chance not to die as much.
---
It sucks.  In before everyone else says it sucks.
---
Got two of the plans.
---
No .50 cal does enough damage.  I use a Prime AA Gatling Plasma and with all three Lvl 3 Heavy Gunner, Stabilized, Bloody Mess and Psycho get 29 to the head or vocal sac, a lot less than the 49 I get with the same combo on the SBQ.
---
Shit, I'm level 90 and I still don't have a decent weapon. I must be playing wrong.
---
Chinese stealth suit and crouch in a bush while claiming, then FT away.
---
u/valseek was Grahm originally in the transportation business?  This makes sense that for him a week might be 6 days.  I know those poor souls in transport get the short shrift when it comes to days off...
---
I don't disagree with that. I was only responding to your weird hostility over a non-issue.
---
No, it's one of the community events rewards to have another Meat Week in September..OP is mistaken.
---
Geez, I didn't even do that and I'm pretty far from being a good player.   Thinking the difference was having Bird Bones mutation or not.
---
... yes. There‚Äôs multiple every single queen fight. The only reason the guy made a post about the ghoul Yao Guai because it has such a low spawn chance it‚Äôs easy to never see one in hundreds of hours of gameplay
---
Nice!
---
No of BoS reward is another meet week in September.
---
I appreciate that very much, but I'm on PC :( In terms of getting speed demon, do I basically just repeat the cycle of "get rads" + "take radaway" until I get that one? Or is it not even worth trying without starched genes?
---
Yeah it's rather ironic really that the guy the OP was referring to was complaining that his optimised build doesn't work for this event (or maybe he thought he was optimised and everyone else was holding him back, but then he died, so much for that then).
---
Bloodied builds, and really any build in any RPG, come about as a result of min-maxers trying to optimise everything for a specific way of playing. That's fine for the people who are trying different combinations of perks/weapons/armour/mutations etc to see what works best, not really my idea of fun but each to their own.
---
What I don't understand is why someone would copy a build that someone else came up with, and then moan that new gameplay doesn't suit that build very well. Surely if builds are your thing then the game for you is to come up with a build that works well for ACP.
---
It's not just FO76; I've seen similar attitudes in all manner of games, people responding to some new content or rebalancing by complaining that it breaks their extremely optimised build or playstyle that was always likely to break at any changes anyway because it is so specialised.
---
I mean, anybody who plays 76 likes a grind my friend. 10 distinct grinds stacked on top of each other gets a little old tho LOL
---
Start collecting glass for the second helping!!!!
---
It wasnt even supposed to be extended lol. Another Meat Week is in September.
---
Sorry to bother you directly on an unrelated thread, but I have a question that hopefully you can answer once and for all: the Lv 98 Legendary Run reward, the Captain Cosmos outfit recolors, come without an helmet, despite it being shown in one of the pictures that we can see when inspecting the level rewards. ***Is the Fishbowl helmet intended to be included in the lv 98 rewards of the Legendary Run, or is it an Atom Shop exclusive?***
---
I've looked through the last three months of threads and reports regarding the issue, and the consensus seems to be that this has been acknowleged as a bug, and that it will be fixed at some point. The problem is, there are dozens of threads of people claiming this, but not a single one of them has been answered by Bethesda employees nor there is ever a link to an official statement, so a clarification would be nice.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
I like sharing that perk with my team :)
---
Yes.  Remove Starched Genes, and consume Radaway until the particular mutation you want to get rid of goes away.
---
There may be side-effects, but this method is guaranteed to work.
---
Yeah for the most part I do like 3 different public events and most of the time it‚Äôs for T-notes. 
---
I think Destiny (at least 1 since that‚Äôs the one I played, I just have what my friends tell me about 2) is a good benchmark. Difficulty by itself is not a lot of fun (it can be see dark souls) but I think to most people just upping the difficulty wouldn‚Äôt increase the challenge or fun. In Borderlands 3 they introduced Mayhem mode 10 (enemies have like 10,000% more HP, shields and Armor) and there are 4 types of modifiers (easy, medium, hard and very hard) that increase both risk and reward like 
---
Big Kick Energy: Gun damage increased by 25% but recoil and weapons spread increased by 100%. 
---
Galaxy Brain: enemy head size and hit box increased by 100%, 
---
Healy Avenger: When enemies die a heart orb will appear and slowly go towards an enemy to heal them (you can shoot and kill the heart orb) 
---
Floor is Lava: if you stand still for about 7 seconds a lava pool (dealing fire damage) will spawn under you. 
---
Laser Fare: When enemies are hit they have a chance to spawn a laser spinner trap that does fire, shock or acid damage. 
---
Buddy System: An invulnerability drone has a chance to spawn with an enemy and make them invulnerable to all damage until the drone is destroyed. 
---
Post Mortem: On enemy death a death skull entity may spawn and slowly chase the player if it touches you you basically go into 76‚Äôs incapacitated mode (where a player can revive you). You can destroy the death skulls but they are somewhat sturdy and a pain for melee characters.
---
Not the face: Crit damage is reduced by 75%
---
Holy Crit: Crit Damage is increased by 25% but non-Crit shots are reduced by 50%
---
There‚Äôs more but I think I listed enough. Sorry hahaha.
---
The poor Momma just wanted to hatch her babies in peace...
---
Those numbers won't make a difference.
---
Converted all the spare ammo i had into fuel to cook Earl. Got enough to run it 4 times. So pretty useful to me.
---
apart from anything else, i definitely noticed a huge drop in people out and about on the map. seems like everybody was doing the same as me, teleporting from event to event. maybe i'm just unlucky but anytime i did go exploring, i'd never see anybody. i used to see way more people pre-season all over the place.
---
This bug is back again. My fiance just had 6 challenges (including the 5/5 challenge) auto-complete when the dailies rolled over this morning. I thought they fixed this back in July?? Looks like they broke it again in the most recent patch.
---
Anyone else seeing this again?? Super irritating with the Legendary Run almost over. They'd better come up with some sort of compensation for this nonsense.
---
I'm playing 2 different characters so I can side with both.
---
Take one most people dont care about. Push and hold the change - view button (select on console, not sure about PC). This let's you claim anywhere in the workshop. Hide. Leave once claimed. Your safe outside of workshop from pvp
---
September 22-28
---
Claim and leave. Avoid heavily contested workshops like the munitions factory.
---
I participated the same amount of times, and popped every other 2% drop multiple times. I only got the tenderizer at one of the last cookouts yesterday. Shit didn‚Äôt make sense, but that‚Äôs the nature of something being rare I guess
---
I'm not going back in as bloodied.   I'll be jumping in the rad shower, switching some perks, doing it, and then reversing the process once it's done.
---
Weird, the few times I am not in a party chat I don't ever hear anyone talking. I have even tried talking and no one responds back. Far as I can tell no one actually talks in the game.  
---
I still say FO76 has the most pleasant player base of MP games I've played (ok, monster hunter may have it beat but that's prolly cause it is solely a co op game). Granted I don't play many MP games (I bet I can count on one hand the amount I play, and GTA is my basis of comparison cause it was the first I got into... so probably most games look good compared to it ;). GTA online would be great if it weren't for its playerbase).
---
The last time I had three people. A level 170 with a pistol (I‚Äôm talking revolver), a level 323 hiding, and myself level 208. Should have been possible but level no longer equals game play time. I caught the level 323 crouched in the mine up top, had to find them and start shooting to say, Hey I see you. Then they hid on the middle platform on the way down. Events are making sure everyone participates. The whole event farming without participating is tiresome and why People probably still have to loot legendary bodies.
---
I love my food build! I carry around enough food to feed a small village. I swear these people don't even eat since they can't hardly carry anything.
---
I had considered that, or one time I literally just hid behind a building and used a Stealth Boy, but it does not seem right that there should be a situation like this in the first place. There shouldn't be weapons that allow a player to one-shot kill another player and no amount of armor will protect you, should there? 
---
This is why I just wish they offered an option for no-PVP servers. I would have a lot more fun.
---
You can sometimes find someone selling a serum for as low as 400caps, that‚Äôll give you the mutation. Could snag a couple if you want to try it before investing in starched genes. If you invest in rad removing items that keep the mutations (nuka grape is best, golf resort nuka cola bar), could tie you over for a bit as well
---
Way to focus on the wrong part of the message ;-)
---
Ok maybe the numbers are 50/25/25 ... that work for you?
---
The point is, since they aren't all multiplying any more, they can do more things with it. 
---
Here's one for you - they should make SNEAK damage an additive as well.
---
Nerf isn‚Äôt that bad, few extra shots here and there but stuff still dies. Running daily ops on the PTS even testing with an unoptimized full health build I‚Äôm finding it almost too easy... just glad they fixed Iron Fist.
---
It IS hard.   This just means you are that good, KayGrim.  :)
---
üò≠ he was triggered lol
---
No. This change is fine, they just need to adjust  hardened receivers and buff them like 50 points.
---
Even having an unlevelled tenderizer is fun because you can share it with your group and it starts at 5% more damage. Bam, now everyone is doing 5% more damage.   
---
Not sure if it's a stacking debuff, but if it is, then if all 4 of your group are shooting Earl then now he's taking 20% more. If both groups have one person sharing tenderizer and they're all shooting, then that's 40%.  
---
But even if it doesn't, a 5% damage buff from one person sharing a single ranked card isn't terrible.
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
Maybe I should of listed a bunch of industries that have business days and no assumed people knew what I meant. And instead put something like a business week can be 5-7 and still considered a week.
---
Are you on PC? I think I have an extra plan of it.
---
Oh so I can enjoy the game more I just have to pay? :)
---
3rd one, im a food build then, got aqua boy/girl equipped
---
I've only seen it once during a yao guai alpha event, haven't seen it since and honestly forgot it existed until a few seconds ago.
---
I hardly ever get attacked, i also leave all my resource things unlocked so players can just loot it so i give them less reasons to attack it in case they want it for themselves.
---
If you ever see a bloodied build with high radiation their one weakness would be a good radiation weapon, also carry berry mentats in case they like to use stealth boys.
---
We‚Äôre all at Radiation Rumble popping lunchboxes to level up for the dailies.
---
It sort of depends which weapon(s) and end game loot you were most interested in getting first really! I chose raiders because I like their GB loot pool the best but both factions have pretty good weapons available when you max out your reputation. You'll get access to it all eventually.
---
Yeah. Same. I thought that since primal meats events were still going they would at least have one last cook-off.
---
That quest pops whenever someone launches a nuke.  It completes when the nuke detonates.  Check your map when it pops, you'll see the red circle indicating where the nuke is targeting.
---
I saw a video by Rifle Gaming showing the difference, and it just seems like Bloodied builds are not worth it at all now. The damage nerf is gigantic, and for running around Appalachia in 20%&lt; HP its definitely not worth it to go bloodied anymore.
---
I don't know why they nerfed bloodied / junkies instead of just buffing the other effects :(
---
Wtf is a food build? I've never heard the term before
---
He just wants a picanic basket
---
Yeah, I think the common theme is that Meg is just awful at being a raider. She's okay as a pretty normal wasteland survivalist (Although even then, her leadership skills are questionable; how do you not know one of your key guys is suicidal and the other is plotting to overthrow you?), but that's not really anything we haven't seen before in this franchise. It would have been amazing to have a competent leader who is downright evil with not even a smidgen of pretense of being anything else but a monster who will do anything to ensure their people will always come out on top, and that ruthless leader being a woman. Caesar was at least trying to justify his actions with the noble cause of restoring order; I think *Fallout* needs more monsters you can forge an uneasy alliance with. MODUS was great precisely because he was so creepy and cold; we need more of that, not fuzzy wuzzy goody two-shoes like Meg.
---
The term "Foodbuild," is not a term used for high health builds. The term is actually used by PvPers such as myself to identify and sometimes pick at the PvE playerbase. Mostly, Foodbuilds are PvE players who load themselves with cards that reduce weight from junk, food drink chem, etc. They also use quite a bit of Quality of Life cards. Then they loads themselves with tons and tons of bulk junk only to lose it to a PvPer because the FoodBuild took a Workshop/PvP zone. Yes, Workshops are infact PvP oriented locations. 
---
Back to the Foodbuild term. I find that people that are infact Foodbuilds don't really understand PvP lingo. So I just thought I should clarify.
---
The plan didn't drop until this update. It was in the game before, but not implemented, and people hack-spawned/duped it
---
Time for second helpings I guess
---
I think everyone did this at least once their first time
---
Yeah, there should be some trigger for the nuke launcher at the mine entrance to start the event.
---
The audio doesnt remotely keep up with the video.  My MaDeuce was firing silently.  The only noise was the spawn killing me, 30 seconds ago.
---
My character is dead and my controller STARTS to take hits......  the firing gun has no climb, theres no noise and i am dead before i get hit.
---
Pretty satisfying, overall.  
---
In retrospect,  the noise is jumbled. The targets arent clear, my weapon is working but i am fixated on the shitshow in front of me.  And i never saw what hit me.
---
They fuckiin nailed it!!!
---
serious as a fukken heart attack, they nailed it
---
I do realize its a nerf to all damage but I don't care about commando builds or pistols neither do I care about other legendaries like junkies. I care about bloodied and unarmed as that is my build. I aplogize If you disagree though I am spreading my opinion to others. I do understand some people are happy for the nerf though I enjoy one-shoting everything I encounter. Though I have already have struggled when I was a low level. I am a high level now and I think earned the right to say after 200 levels I should be able to one-shot a scorchbeast and solo every boss in the game. Though thats my opinion. P.S excuse my mis-spelling im in a rush
---
I have never felt like the people who were killing me really cared about the workshop, or else they would have claimed it already. They just seem to be people who enjoy being dicks.
---
They should make a DLC with a Far Harbour place called Death claw Island (or something similar) but all the death claws are chill bc their mega death claw is like that one deathclaw from the vault (i forget the lore) thats chill.
---
If you want to spawn one reliably, log out at Dolly Sods and log back in.  The enemies will spawn at minimum level for the Mire and both the Yao Guai will be lvl 30-something ghoul versions.
---
This may only work on a private server or if no other players have been through the area recently.
---
lol
---
You cant really 1-shot people as there is a dmg cap (unless they are very low level with no DR or low health)
---
stop by my camp I‚Äôve got plenty of them, you‚Äôll find it in my vendor under Ted Swag
---
Yet in this case you‚Äôre the fool, not bethesda, as they never said anywhere they would be extending meat week
---
I bless those who are generous enough to revive me when I over extend on events where something blind sides me and knocks me down in one hit.
---
Bloodied builds can talk tough shit until a yao guai rushes them. I fear those bear bastards more than I do a scorchbeast.
---
As an added bonus if you're not melee consider blocker level 3 incoming melee damage reduced by 45%. I say if you're not melee because if you are you can literally fill all 15 strength slots with straight damage buffs.
---
But then us folks at work that have restrictive firewalls can't see it.
---
It‚Äôs not bad, but I‚Äôd remove any perks that give you increased DR and trade them for ones that increase the chance to block or reduce a certain % of incoming dmg like blocker(str) does and maybe put in life giver instead of ironclad
---
Nah I don't think it stacks. But if you're in a group you know you can have someone equip suppressor to reduce enemy damage output which is just as good.
---
Prime AA Gatling Plasma is the weapon for Earle and the SQB with three Lvl 3 Heavy Gunner, Stabilized, Bloody Mess and lots of Psycho.
---
Never have i been so offended by something I 100% agree with more.
---
You can still kill someone before they have time to react with a powerful heavy weapon.
---
The best thing about meat week was all the plans I bought off graham
---
What is the damage cap? I think at full health I have 260 HP and I've seen weapons that can do over 300 damage prior to any modifiers from armor or chems or perk cards. I know the most recent time this happened the person was using some kind of legendary railway rifle because I heard the whistle right before I died. I might not have been at *full* health but relatively close and in power armor.
---
Same here. I was holding 15 cuts. Everything vanished and a ghoul came out of nowhere and started attacking Graham. RIP Meat 6 Days.
---
depends on your platform.
---
I feel you. I've never played a single game to 100% and that feeling is probably exactly why. The fun is not in the completion but in the journey along the way. 
---
Each time there's something to look forward to, there's the feel-good chemical rush. You want more good feels so you keep going. But the ending is...the end. No more rewarding good feels.
---
isnt that how real life boardgames work aswell tho?
---
I don't know, maybe I'm biased because I think bloodied builds are the ultimate corny way to play any game in recent memory, but I don't think it's out to get you. I think it's actually designed that way to force some semblance of cooperation and team work the same way the 8 player limit is.
---
 I play a heavy guns tank and inbetween shooting at Earle myself and another tank player were attracting attention of regular wendigo spawns and keeping an eye out to prevent them from bodying bloodied builds so they can focus all attention on the boss. Felt a lot more fun and coordinated than SBQ ever could have.
---
all the stuff for the meat-cook was still there, but it didn't start. sadly, i totally blanked on the time - only time i've had the dailies auto-complete on me so far, too.
---
Xbox sorry should have mentioned
---
I personally loved dark souls because of that reason. The challenge may seem insurmountable at first, but after defeating that challenge is one of the most rewarding feelings of accomplishment. Even just those mods add some really cool complexities to the game, and increase rewards too. All this game seems to try to do is timegate everyone, and that's the end game. Grind until you don't see grinding as beneficial or fun anymore. I'm hopeful one wasteland and the brotherhood of steel add ons will provide much needed life to the game.
---
Why was he griefing you?
---
Haha me too. Thought I had already got most plans but 8000 caps later I guess I was wrong lol.
---
I'm absolutely a food build. Just switched from Junkie's didn't like Bloodied and I tanked out of power armor against Earl. After playing for so long I've enjoyed toying around with chems and alcohol and some of the endurance perks. It's been a lot of fun so far.
---
I fear a Liberator
---
Use stealth suit and bow troll them into submission
---
Lmao god I hate that people like that exist most people base our great community off of people like him. I myself am I bloodied build, but I don't mind others doing their own type build. With that being said sorry you had to experience that.
---
Don't know about xbox, so i personally can't help you there.
---
I got there a second too late and didn't get to hear Grahm say goodbye :c It's the third time now that I keep just barely missing the last Meat Week event lol
---
I think we should also earn the two pieces on the board that we can move around.
---
If you try it out for a month do u keep the tent after that month is over
---
Legit, I like card sharing for this kinda stuff, and yeah, suppressor starts at something bonkers like 20% right?
---
Yes, nice :-)
---
The real question is why they are giving them to us piecemeal like this.
---
I think its so funny how there were people who were saying that it was done on purpose because the SS armor was so good that the lack of deep pocketed and ultra light was supposed to be an intended feature üòÇ
---
If you need it for dailies ask someone with private if people are being cancer. It's really rare though to see this. I've only seen claimed workshops in the legendary run, no one on public actually care about them, outside of the run. 
---
Put your ign here, I'd let you grab the ones you need should cancer show up.
---
The scrapbox alone is a gamechanger.
---
Well said!  Thats why I suggest for the entire month not when the event is on!!  They had the vampire costume though but should do more monsters!!!
---
That player afking wasnt an alt, lvl 132 in the power armor skin you get from finishing the legendary run so NO! He wasn‚Äôt carrying me :)
---
And yeah sure you can let your friends afk I would help a friend too, but to do it with randoms and afk when only other three is fighting? That‚Äôs terrible.
---
Also joining the fight I know i can do enough damage to pull my weight (explosive flamer is awesome) another player was melee and the last was commando and we did it with 14 minutes to spare! That‚Äôs not the point. Spent way more ammo than needed because some jerk decided not to contribute.
---
Having someone afk in such event is Super frustrating for most, this event isn‚Äôt like the easy meat week, team work is needed.
---
It's pretty tough to kill when you're low-level. I figure that the problem here is that some people will stop by the Wayward and pick up the Crane quest-line and then just follow it to its conclusion, in which case you're probably only level 4 or 5 when you encounter Deathclaw Island; while others will encounter the other main story quests you can pick up near the vault (Responders and Grafton questlines seem to be the main ones designed for you to encounter almost fresh out the vault) and not return to it until they're a much high level.
---
I was watching a YouTuber playing recently, and they explored the area around Vault 76 a bit, came within range of the Grafton radio, which triggers that quest and then just followed that quest line all around the Toxic Valley, getting to about level 15 or so without setting foot in Flatwoods.
---
I was the other way round, I picked up the Grafton quest, noted that it was in the north of the map in a different region and deduced it probably wasn't for newbies. Ended up running through the whole of the Responders/Fire Breathers quests, most of the Wayward quest and Rose's quests before I got around to visiting the Toxic Valley.
---
Thanks anyways but I think I‚Äôve lost it all :(
---
science food build
---
As has been posted elsewhere in this thread, all is not lost. Due to us "finishing" the plastic challenge (I don't know about you, but I didn't contribute a single bit of plastic), we get "Meat Week, A Second Helping" from Sep 22-28.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt really get why people use it as an insult. I consider what I use as a food build because I use a bloody unarmed build to be non-sneak while using every food/aid buff I can, so I‚Äôm always hunting for ingredients. I even use Fasnacht sausages to down myself for revenant.
---
Carnivore, Good with salt, butchers bounty, green thumb, thru hiker, party boy, rejuvenated, curator (eating unarmed bobbleheads and covert ops magazines).  
---
Although I get the frustration from the stupid collapsing ceiling aoe as a bloodied melee build. I can stand in all the other aoes fine, but that one seems to do full damage regardless, has no floor indicators, and no warning/delay. And Earle sure does love to stand in those.
---
Ah that‚Äôs perfect. Thank you!
---
Yeah, hopefully the BOS isn‚Äôt just a reskinned wastelanders with a BOS theme to it. Like there‚Äôs a vault full of pre-war tech let‚Äôs break into it and then you grind for like pre-war circuit boards or something to get plans.
---
Prime AA Gatling Plasma for SBQ and Earle.  Med Pump for your PA and VATS Assist.  Magic shotgun for all around use other than bosses.  Don't forget that Perk Card layout is as important as the weapon.  At Lvl 390 I can change builds in less than a minute.  PA/Heavy Gun, Sshotgunner, Commando, Stealth version of any build with Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
Is it over now?!
---
All Daily Ops enemies have enhanced perception to basically disable sneaking so stealth commandos etc cannot but sneak attack everything and remain undetected...
---
The feeing of getting on the game and not having 11 grinds and only having 10 is immensely uplifting. Why am I like this?
---
I get that thought process but some of the conjecture surrounding it borders on hyperbole. I've completed the event several times without a single bloodied build in the mix. All high health. Bloodied players' self importance is a little wild sometimes.
---
Don't get me wrong though, I did fail it once when Earle had maybe 10% health left and we ran out of time because half the team was sub level 50 and that felt REALLY bad lmao. So I feel the frustration.
---
I now need a grafton plushie
---
Thank you! And yes hahah it was your post. It was a really great idea so I just made something to share how I would like it to look :)
---
OP gets it.
---
I'm sure many people feel this way, it's just difficult to put in words like this. Thank you.
---
that would not have been the last one.
---
I'm still waiting to see the Blue Man Group up there...
---
Yao Guial
---
That doesn‚Äôt help. Your spawn point is determined by the spot you initially drop it, not where you move it around to afterwards.
---
Yea Im unemployeed to beem so over a year so im there with you my friend.  Previous halloween event they didnt put anything in the shop until it pretty much was halloween.  Theres that nice pumpkin suite Im sure theyll bring back but yea drop rates are bs.  Just wamt something to look forward to you know?
---
This right here
---
As others have said, you have to buy the plan and read it, but you have to make sure you have the base plan, then buy the mod for shielded. They are separate items.
---
Yeah I really don't know the specifics but I know for a fact that nothing much will change. Like from what I know, bloodied will still be the best build but much worse and everything else will be basically useless.
---
I die enough as it is and I accept each death with a smile because I know I am a glass canon. Take away the canon part and you have something only meant to be broken. Just glass, only dangerous things about it are the broken shards on the floor and I guarantee you no wasteland monster is gonna give a shit about some broken glass.
---
Over the top comparisons aside, I REALLY don't think this is gonna make anyone very happy, while I personally believe that I as a bloodied build should be a bit more nerfed I am baffled that the solution to that nerf is downgrading everything.
---
Oh yeah saw someone else also saying it. If it goes trough, then awesome!!
---
I'm level 220 and I only recently got a good weapon, your not playing wrong, it's just bad luck
---
How are the Responders and Foundation not good? They both just wanted to rebuild society and protect whoever needed help as long as they weren't raiders.
---
I aplogize for upsetting you though.  I do understand these post are stupid I really do aplogize. But im just spreading my opinion.
---
"Why would you care about randoms?"
---
Spoken like a true psychopath.
---
Right?  So so much money.
---
The cynic inside me wants to say either because stretching out content or just simply forgot, but I have no idea really, I'm just glad that they are adding it eventually
---
Yes, thank you. I went back to the main menu to check and the message says bonus challenges. I've finished the run 2 or 3 weeks ago and had completely forgotten about it. XD
---
Mothman costume!!  Yea I discussed this with some pals last time why they didnt have any in game monster costumes.  But they did come out with the Grafton monster coustum a few months ago so they got one in!
---
I read that if you drop an item next to the crack everything will shift to that bag and not in the fissure. I am not sure if this will work
---
Drop something (anything) as close to it as possible, the two bags should merge next to you. Or try to use a jetpack to get the bag (tricky).
---
yeah, it's a nice surprise for sure. early on in 76, I had a camp near there and didn't even know it was a thing. I found it while going to grind super mutants at the lumber factory (ah, the good ol' days).  i dont know if you ever played new vegas but that first time you try go north from goodsprings past the mining camp to the quarry and you get owned, you're like "oooh, that's why they said go all the way around the damn map". It's an experience.
---
No, you keep the stash box and the junk in it but you can‚Äôt put anything in.
---
Has happened to me as well
---
No it does, while still some what random it will change the location. It's normally north of the printer. The printer location also changes where your pet paces. Try it out if you don't believe me.
---
I always go for Beckley Mine and Dolly Sods Campground for the challenges. Never had an issue at those ones
---
A rad roach the size of a van would make for a terrifying endgame boss.
---
I have a J2515 one, a B25 Gatling plasma, and even a legacy BE1P Gatling plasma. My bloodied heavy build is perfect for the event but I‚Äôm gonna need to use different weapons sadly.
---
I've been in one where we had SIX people under 40.  Do you think they did any damage?  They were all like 24, 24, 26, etc. with I think one at 35.
---
We failed the event because the 2 of us with high level characters can't 2 man that.  They died a million times to the smaller Wendigo spawns that they ignored, probably because they couldn't kill them.  Or they're just the selfish type to try and get free XP and loot without caring to actually contribute.
---
I've seen plenty of queen events fail because everyone wants to bring an alt for loot and XP. 
---
Many of us higher levels DO help lowbies.  I've never come across higher levels that just hate lowbies and don't want them around.  I give them stimpaks, gear, weapons, chems, anything that will help them stay alive and get through content easier.   I'll even hunt level 5 legendaries down just to help lowbies out.
---
Get off your high horse and use your head.  It's about **failing events**, not because we don't think they belong.
---
Nope, you're not the only one. I scrapped mine. lol
---
Yeah... first time I got on it I instantly ran because I assumed it was full of deathclaws and I was totally not ready to take that on. Then later on learned it was just one deathclaw.
---
Hahah
---
I just came back myself last week. It really has invigorated my interest. I did make a big mistake and was unable to get the stealth suit on my stealth character after not doing the research. I rerolled a new one already, and back up to level 60.
---
Ok thanks guys will try that
---
Course I did... does it not have any other meanings to you?
---
I just scrapped it for more budget at some point
---
Some people have their chat set to area, which is why I usually run muted. During events, however, I unmute in case I miss something. I'm glad I did, it was hilarious. :)
---
The playerbase in this game is one of the best but lately there's been a huge influx of weirdos. No idea if this is because of the Gamepass thing but I've run into a lot more weirdos and asshole then usual.
---
My Freind still has his. We‚Äôre gonna save it until we‚Äôre higher level
---
I like this idea! Make the Deathclaw deadly again!
---
I honestly hate the idea of enemies not being able to be killed by any weapon.  They need to remove it from the pts.
---
The banking clan will sign your treaty
---
It's a bug, I've had the same one stopping me for months. Two different issue reports, still no luck. Apparently throwing grenades up into the waterfall in the room can help? It never did for me but hey, maybe you'll have better luck. 
---
And a word of advice: if you see the name of it/a red reticle, but it's still invisible, and you can hear breathing, don't kill it. It won't turn visible or leave a corpse on death, so you're still stuck without the key.
---
Because it's tiring, lol. I've been so tempted to buy off my last few levels.
---
So, I'm not clear about this-- is it possible to join someone else's private server even if you're not paying for the Fallout 1st yourself?
---
Wtf is a food build?
---
Wade airport and Lakeside Cabins are good easy ones as well.
---
Got me today too. Lost 3750 score. I honestly can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt fixed this.
---
I was kinda sad when I ran up the hill and all the stuff was gone üòÇ
---
I mean, i guess it's possible but they would have to have a pretty twisted view of what stretching out content means lol.
---
Since we had that issue where the deep pocketed was supposed to be in there then it wasn't and had to be hotfixed in, it would seem that simply adding a plan to regs's inventory is not as simple as one would think.  Maybe the spaghetti code is that bad that this is the case.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OqpbBruZIc#t=5m10s
---
@ 5:10 if deep linking didn't work.
---
Huh I thought he called me fat..
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd like to see someone solo that in 12 seconds! Then again, some one probably has and probably could, but still.
---
It's Grahm.
---
But yes, we all do. I want a Chally and Grahm plushie set. :D
---
BL has V1 and V2 damage. They're both additive, but then they multiply together along with some other things. 
---
Gross oversimplification, but that's the gist of it.
---
I have tried it with no change. The spawn point is always on the north edge of the spot I dropped the camp initially. Moving the overhead projector makes no difference. I‚Äôll try again though. I want to be wrong.
---
Any proof of this I'm fairly certain it's instanced and multiple teams of 8 are doing at same time my friends were doing a completely different collosus at the same time as me
---
Very common bug...happens all the time.
---
Dont feel bad, I bought off my last 15. I havemt grinded for score for over two weeks. I really am hapoier playing daily now.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äòmurka!  Companies have the freedom to extract as much money from you as possible.
---
Like I said, I don't think it's people who really care about the workshop. Almost every time this happens, they kill me, pick up my loot and fast-travel away. Some times they stay in stealth and if I try to rush back to pick up my loot they 1-shot me again, then they FT away. Often they also will immediately block me so I can't see where they are even.
---
Sadly it is a highly common bug, I personally never had it(thankfully).. apparently it has something to so with being online when the server resets, although it happens to people who weren't, and also quite often doesnt happen to people who are online during reset.
---
Deathclaws keep getting less and less deadly each game. Or at least each game Bethesda uses them in. Hell... the first time I encountered one was 3 (I never got far in 1 before I played 3 and didn't have a chance to play 2) and I just shot it in the head. NOt until later when some one was hoping to get a it scared the hell out of me story did I realize it was supposed to be scary. So when I played New Vegas I was like, "Oh, just one shot in the head, should be easy". Uh yeah, barely touched it and it kept coming at me... oh shit! New Vegas was the last time deathclaws were scary.
---
First off. You get a BIG ASS message letting you know that you have entered a potentialy dangerous area by claiming the work shop. They can't let you just sit in the workshop in pacifist all week long. Someone else might like to collect supplies and frankly if another player can clap them cheeks they deserve the work shop. If you find this to be an issue fallout first is avalible providing a private server. You can also collect way more scrap out in the world than ANY workshop. 
---
Next you need to understand that even with the very best tank gear and build a player can only withstand so much damage. The damage a player can do is capped at 150 but players only have so much health so it only takes a few shots normally to kill someone. For those super tanks they might take two powerful clips before dying but they are not exactly gonna sit there and let you kill them. If they have reached super tank status then chances are their weapons are top tier and your gonna die.
---
Lastly 76 was never meant for pve. Right from the get go it was intended that players would run around killing each other constantly. But over time it grew to accept the pve players at the cost of ruining it for the pvp players. Everyone said give them their own servers. Then dirty pve players showed up and ruined that. Next was the change so pvp is one on one initation now becuase pve players didn't like being cat fished. Now you want to sit in a workshop all day doing beach bob stuff? Naw you need to be sent home if you can't protect it so things can clear out for the next player.
---
This. It's efficient to rock 3 man cyclical teams to get 9 done super fast.
---
And usually by the end of your #3, 9 total, #1 will have cooled off your person.
---
Huh, I didn't realize it was an "event" and thought it was a straight-up questline. I ended up getting in on a Colossal and fulfilling the rest of the quest *minus* launching the nuke.
---
Can a person ONLY start the event if they have the quest line or can anyone just target Monongoa mine to get it underway?
---
The emote? It's not a laugh/ cackle at all, just typical Bethesda being misleading. It is cool though, the character spins around the staff then slams it down like a taunting Gandalf.. kinda.
---
Honestly I just got to the Chicken Coop reward and called it good. I couldn't do it anymore. Lol
---
I was surprised when I learned yesterday that it was going to end today.
---
That's not actually a week.
---
looks like a few others have already posted about it today, as per usual.
---
The dirt tiles should have been too.  While you're at it, why not the shotgun and the minigun?
---
FT out puts u out of the event.
---
My bad didn‚Äôt scroll through enough
---
Really? I just read that they use both. I wasn‚Äôt go into minmaxing until BL3 and TBH in 76 if you have enough ammo you don‚Äôt really need to min-max.
---
Still can with deathclaw gauntlet sneak attack it in 2 hits , well on console I heard pc unarmed damage got wrecked
---
Apparently then, I got the weapon itself as a reward.    Fun, but really heavy.
---
Thx for the clarity!
---
Ugh, well I wasn't using them for that reason, they are the staircase for my camp, see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j1eOdMX0s4&amp;t=28s, I was trying to put some final decorations in now that I was done with the legendary run, just need enough space now to build a few last things really... was going to make the Turbo Fertilizer and add 2 plushies - got the WC from the event last night and finally - they put the Silver Shroud plushie back in the shop!  What will my camp be now without my Wendigo Colossus plushie!!? I'm going to have a hard time figuring out what to remove, maybe I'll just leave it be.
---
Made this on the day i had it unlocked. :)
---
To have this game be consistent would be a win right. All I know is when I'm done building a camp I adjust that printer to get the right spawn every time. It's a bitch but it works. Like if I put it at the south end you spawn towards the middle. The land itself may play a role too I'm sure. But it's still random to avoid exploits.
---
didn't expect you to. just answering your question.
---
Why fade it out during the cook-off?  All this does is piss players off.  Like end the event afterwards.  Not as it's about to start.
---
A good point.  I ended up buying a handful of things like Mirror Balls and Radiation Emitters that will probably resell for a decent price.
---
The stupid thing is when presets come in everyone will have a food build and a combat build, so why bitch that people use food builds? Bloodied builds can be some of the whinest players on the game I swear, if it bothers you that much go make a Junkies build and do almost the same damage at virtually no risk.
---
Thanks that's probably been the best response I've heard, I've ran unyielding the whole time as a bloodied build and never thought bolstering was any better 
---
But say vanguard with a high endurance would still be worse than bolstering?
---
the deathclaws in 3 didn't scare me as much after I got that cannon thing from mothership zeta allowing me to launch them in the air if I angle it right
---
NV will always terrify me
---
yes its a must, iconic monster and not even a boss :/
---
Were two wearing Chally backpacks and one the meat cooler? If so that may be me on the right.
---
Private server!
---
To be fair, I've been told by PVPers that anything is a food build as long as there is one QoL perk in the build.
---
Personally, I'm a PA heavy gunner. I don't min/max. I have a lot of QoL perks equipped and the amount of damage I deal is sufficient. 
---
I was a Berserker. I was Bloodied. I was Junkies. I was every build you can imagine, sometimes for hundreds of levels, and in the end I settled for full health PA heavy because I want to have fun. :)
---
When you press buy u can see more btw if words are too long.
---
I have had no problem at all on ps4 sounds like yours is junk
---
it's a 2% drop, so statistically speaking things happened as expected.
---
Agreed.
---
It doesnt stop working. It's a visual only glitch on loading that character.
---
Here's how to test.
---
Login and see something like egghead saying -3str -3end.
---
Cool.
---
Check your specials, specifically str and end.
---
Now go unequipped and re-equip class freak.
---
Egg head now properly shows -1str -1end..BUT, check your specials. They dont change at all.
---
Why? Cause it's a visual only glitch. Annoying but the card isnt broken.
---
That would be great, but think OP is talking about baby Godzilla.
---
Iirc, max PvP dmg is 100 per shot.  The railways are one of the few weapons that works in vats during PvP.
---
It's not a cackle at all.
---
It's very similar to the Grognak axe pump, except he swings his sorcerer staff around all mystically.  It's more of a taunt than anything.
---
If you thought you were buying it for a deranged, unhinged evil laugh, it's a big disappointment.
---
I think 20% might actually be level 3. I'm not 100% sure on that though because I don't use it myself. I live by the belief if you kill it faster it'll do less damage LOL
---
I think it should have been after you kill the first one, you then hear several screams. A few seconds later 3 to 5 additional Deathclaws spawn.
---
NP.  The +4 STR is great for my melee build :)
---
full spec for shielded is: 
---
 15DR, 15ER and 15RR 
---
 Strength +4, Perception +2 Endurance +4
---
I barely struggle with this event. I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy build and usually do the most damage out of the group even if there‚Äôs other high levels. And no I don‚Äôt use legacies or magic weapons.
---
Wait I never got Revenant to proc from Life-Saving legendary armor. I tested it before and it didn‚Äôt work. Are you telling me that it freaging works???
---
That too, I'm glad to have gotten every plan during the event too, many of them, except the Tenderizer of which I only got one but can now get legendary ones with him.
---
The idea is to rely on your allies and not be able to solo it so easily, but you can solo if you focus on a build that uses multiple weapons. So it would only be a matter of adapting and having backup weapons.
---
Honestly sneak into the workshop. While your crouched you dont show on map. Walk to the workshop that way so they cant see you (maybe in Chinese stelth armor so they have issues finding you of they are already there)
---
yes, if u have someone on friendlist with private server he can host his private servers with 7 additional players
---
Just annoying that over half were completed
---
Keep on grinding
---
On steam PC my atoms appear one day after steam takes my monthly subscription.
---
oh that's interesting!   i swear i noticed an increase in what i could carry when i switched the card in/out the other day, but perhaps i had just got hungry enough that i got +strength from my unyielding gear
---
It was supposed to end on the 28th of this month, maybe they changed the end date. But everything from the Meat Week site has de-spawned.
---
Oh wow def going to purchase that as soon as I hop on today.  Any suggestions on regular armor?  Is the scout armor the best?  Which mods would you suggest for those?
---
Build budget glitches are a gift and a curse. If you plan it right, you can have a crazy big camp that you can make minor tweaks to later (swap one plushie for another, etc). If they happen unexpectedly or you didn‚Äôt plan them well enough, it screws you into having to delete stuff just to be able to add anything new, including connecting power. 
---
I‚Äôve been maintaining a 2x max budget camp for the past 5 months now, and I still make changes to it often because I planned it out in a crazy way. Built a storage room and filled it with decour that I can swap between. I can change all floor types and wallpapers. I‚Äôve only had two accidents when I went to store a wall and place it back, it got rid of the wires running through the wall, so I lost power in my underground Mothman church (which is actually pretty fitting).
---
Today i have had several issues where the game just freeze and disconnect. Tho, the box had an update today. So may be related.
---
May be a lucky streak, but I rolled 3 Bolstering SS  chest pieces in a row using this method. Coincidence maybe, past experiences lead me to believe  otherwise.
---
Nah, xbox. Save that plan though, somebody will want it.
---
I saw that happen as well a few nights ago
---
OK, I can say for certain there's some way around that. The last time it happened, the person killed me with one shot from some kind of Railway Rifle, then when I respawned hoping maybe they just wanted the workshop and weren't going after my loot and tried to run back to pick it up, they were able to one-shot kill me again even though the second time I was definitely at full health. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but somehow it's possible to get around it.
---
Also the event just fading out as it's starting.  At least fade it out after the event.
---
Facts. Would totally give an award if I wasn‚Äôt broke
---
NOW If you were full 8 people in the instance and 4 of those jokers were afk--that would be super frustrating, 100%, yes. No arguments from me.
---
However, in your particular case...the instance supports up to 8 players and you were only 4 total, yes? So it's not like that afk player was taking a spot away from player who would have helped--you had **open spots** in the instance. Whether the afk person was there or not **did not change** the battle much for you. Sure, if s/he could've helped, would have been nice, but so would have been having a full instance of powerful players...it's just chance, you didn't get lucky with the folks that joined.  
---
But my original suggestions stands--don't go in there by yourself, which I gather you did. Form a team before hand, communicate about the event and load into the instance together--and your frustration will be greatly minimized.
---
They were spawn hacked in last year, but later removed from all player inventories by Beth. Was one of my favorite looks too.
---
Same thing happened during Fascnacht - we were about 1/2 way though the parade route and poof...everything related to the event just disappeared.   
---
Would have been nice to be able to complete the active event.....
---
That means someone is dropping a nuke somewhere on the map. You should check the map to make sure you are not in the red circle. If you are in the red circle, fast travel away immediately so that you don‚Äôt die. If you are not, you can continue going about your business.
---
Nukes in low level areas are uncommon, but not unheard of. I have seen Morgantown get nuked, for instance.
---
I think I also got all the mods but wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to get the actual plan or tenderizer itself
---
Note. That‚Äôs a total of 6 days for the event
---
I have it and really love it. It‚Äôs unfortunate it isn‚Äôt part of the base game, but for as much as I play it is worth the cost to me.
---
I use it almost daily to solo transfer gear between alts.
---
2% is 1 in 50. OP said they did 60-70 times...
---
When my workshop gets attacked by a try-hard "workshops are pvp zones!" player. I just go to a different world and cut my losses. 
---
PVP is the thing i do the least in workshops. It's only REAL function is to prevent workshop hoarding.
---
Yeah, that gives you more content to get, but ultimately, what are you getting that content for? Lol
---
Geez, the worst is the High Radiation Fluids.   I'm lucky if I can get two.
---
Huh, I just made my build like I would in a single player Fallout game, high PER, AGI, and LUCK for that sweet sweet rifle/vats action. Does that make mine a food build? 
---
I should mention I have a handful of mutations on, hence high luck requirement.
---
Still looking for someone?
---
No problem! I walked with about 250 screws last time. Enjoy!
---
Cuckout
---
I had the daily challenges autocomplete on Monday. Took yesterday off cause I was salty and then log in today to see all the weekly ones autocompleted too. Fuck. I still have 25 levels to go.
---
Well, they are easy mainly because of the OP weapons we have and frog legs. Also they removed any kill animations like 4 had where they would grab you and either throw you or stab you, which would make them more dangerous. Maybe increase speed and damage.
---
We'll get another week in september more than likely, hopefully you get lucky then. You could try to trade for it as well, seen a fair few people willing to trade for items/caps.
---
Then play the game. Not slot machine.
---
Dude oh hell no i would be so upset
---
This is EXACTLY what is happening. 
---
All the goofy shit is there for the fortnite crowd. All the ghillie suit/military bullshit is there for the call of duty kids. Fallout takes the back seat in the fallout game.
---
Me too my friend...me too.  Literally got everything else, including the mods for it.
---
Or the mouth harp, or the frame drum. Can't understand why these weren't included.
---
In 4 they at least could grab the player and do massive damage. I don‚Äôt know why they removed it in 76. Here‚Äôs to hoping they get a damage and maybe a stagger buff.
---
I thought one-star rolling pin is a queen exclusive. Looks like I‚Äôm totally wrong.
---
I don‚Äôt understand... what the f is a food build
---
I'm not a "food build" per se, but I try to run high health (Vanguard armor, Ironclad, etc.)
---
I can barely handle all the inventory and perks I have much less keep tabs on my food/meds/etc.
---
And Bloodied just scares the hell out of me. NO way would I be comfortable with such low health all the time. It's like THAC0 from 2nd ed. D&amp;D. It just makes no sense to me.
---
Shouldnt be to bad game design. Honestly this comment is so stupid I‚Äôm trying to figure out if your trolling.
---
Beautiful!
---
I rarely use it. Horrid design, easily fixed but they wont.
---
Several times someone would come through and one shot the colossus before anyone else could get a shot on it. At least you can still cheese the silos with the power armor glitch. You can just clip through all the doors til the end and just do the launch prep. Makes it to where the silo only takes me 5 minutes.
---
Finally got the metal picnic table from him!
---
Thing is, you could have no-PVP servers and just say on those any workshop you claim is only for one hour max. Worst case scenario once in a while you might have to jump servers. Most of the people who would be dicks and claim all the workshops are the ones who want to be killing other players.
---
A few public events haven't been working by walking into the area. Queens, Meat Week, Earle, ive had to open the map and join the event. I cant just be there already or walk into it.
---
Wow an actual good idea on this sub for once. I support this.
---
That sounds pretty good for a vault raid yes I'm going to have to think on that because I've only done the vault raids 1 time bloodied and failed miserable, I have a full set of vanguard sent marine with 2 pieces assassin sent and cavs and it's been great for pvp but also weak against some other builds but also a survivor for in game activity better than bloodied
---
Yep. Seen and killed him, and his little alien buddy to.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve gotten luck in that area in the little town that has mole miners and some mole rats. Found more fluids there than I have anywhere before lol. But now I need the damn flux....grrrrr.
---
Not a problem at all mate. 
---
Of course, play the game how ya like, just figured I'd share since I'd been there lol. 
---
Best of luck out there in the wastes
---
So glad the problem I currently have is still active 110 days later
---
Oh so the mother of the mother
---
Things like the Legendary Run which is definitely a grind since you have to basically play the game every single day or leveling up your reputation with the factions which is a form of grind because you're constantly doing these same repetitive challenges each day. Or even saving up for a goddamn mr. Fuzzy mascot outfit what's takes literally months and months if you're only using your own character and not creating 10 alternates to reap tokens every day
---
Finished it 8 days ago ...  wish I had daily atom challenges to do .
---
We still need to get 2 million glass if I‚Äôm not mistaken
---
Yeh I've noticed when I login it always says I'm overencumbered, no matter what. It goes away within a few seconds though. Maybe it's the game just thinking.
---
Like it has to take a second to realize marsupial is there and do all the other mutation calcs?
---
I might be a bit off the mark here but I imagine a text chat system would likely work a bit better than adding all these hyper specific emotes
---
Except in like the first six or so games.
---
The respawn timer is a fucking joke though. Great fun waiting 60 seconds at a time because of some gimpy damage over time effect.
---
You would think that was the answer but like i said in the op my friends ft out and got the reward. If you ft out it puts you at the mine no matter were you chose to go. If you run out it puts you at the mine. If you get kicked because of the timer you get put at the mine.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs gonna be a thing here soon
---
Serendipity procs like 75% of the time for me on fall damage the other 25% bird bones helps
---
A progress bar would work. I would worry that some people would join at the last moment to get the rewards and not do anything.
---
Doesn't matter if they knew or not, if you want to end up banned because you broke TOS, don't come to reddit to whine about it when it happens. The fact that people are taking advantage of it, is what's disgusting. We have 2 machines that can give us ammo for a reason now. Use those. Stop breaking the game and making shit harder for Bethesda. Simple.
---
The pistol build could need some love and comfort. Make it an viable end game build, instead of: Fresh out of Vault to mid game.
---
12 noon eastern, on the dot, event despawned.
---
Grahm and challey walked out of the area
---
There might of been a few voice lines, but I was rather confused and taking in the situation to hear what they said and used to ignoring Grahms repeated voicelines from the last week of listening to him over and over.  
---
Would have been nice to have the 11am event finish and THEN they packed up and left instead of leading us on that there would be a 12 noon event. Or even if Grahm offered some high priced copies of the plans for those that did not get rng to bless them with even one Tenderizer plan
---
Going to try again tonight. Will run out and let it kick me out. Idk why im the only one that ft and does not get the reward
---
This is getting on my nerves as well.
---
Please enlighten me on how you can do this multiple times? Should I not have gone back and talked to chica at Foundation?
---
Why call other players and I quote ‚ÄúLowbies‚Äù that kind of attitude and the segregating players is what fuels toxic community‚Äôs. You can make your point without having to fire shots at a large portion of the player base which are just casual players or players that are late to the party but still heavily invested in the game. Chill out, Be respectful.
---
I thinks it‚Äôs builds that don‚Äôt follow the Meta, don‚Äôt min max. Pick mostly exploration perks, food and water saving perks, etc instead of combat heavy ones.
---
So glad I didn't buy this.  I looked at it, almost bought and then thought hey... I bet this isn't going to be a cackle at all.  Bethesda is notoriously bad at saying what you're buying.
---
Dear Bethesda - A CACKLE IS A FUCKING SOUND NOT A MOTION
---
I never really considered this...only because it's rare that i do PVP at all in workshops. The biggest problem with it is that the player can just keep coming back even if you win. So basically they just will harass you off the server if you need materials.
---
In the end hopefully they will overhaul pvp for workshops to be something more a "one and done" event type thing instead of endless attacking.
---
I don't give a shit about workshops, but Bethesda has chosen to make claiming workshops one of the primary repeating ways to participate in "The Legendary Run", so apparently they expect me to claim workshops. 
---
Even then, I do get that there's that warning, but how in the world is it even fun if someone can show up in stealth and just kill me before I even know they are there? if the damage is capped at 150, but someone has a legendary or modified weapon that can shoot 2, 3 or 4 rounds at once, then that's up to 600 damage before I even know they're shooting at me.
---
I've been chastised for trying to kill the friendly animals with my shishkebab at Project Paradise before... like, look at their health bar dude, i'm healing them.
---
Dodgy and serendipitous perks. ;)
---
But seriously... Check the map to make sure you're alone when you claim it. Build what you need quickly, then get outside the boundary. You can do the defense events if you want by just shooting from outside the workshop boundary.
---
However, on a couple occasions I've had people block me before coming to attack, just so that they won't show up on my map. It's not a sure thing.
---
The item is not even showing for me on Xbox.
---
I guess I didn't find it too challenging.
---
It does slap. One of the highest 2-handed base damages. With peppered mod it outdamages a super sledge.
---
Fall damage reduction, bird bones, and healing factor. Dont have any damage by the time I get to earle
---
Well anal-retentive is an extremely rare phrase, and given the modern connotations of "anal", it would be easier and less confusing to say "fussy".
---
Thanks.   Yeah, I stumbled across that town this morning.   Someone had already killed the miners, but I will definitely return there with your feedback.
---
I was in it when graham decided to pack up and leave with chally. He didn‚Äôt even say goodbye , what A-hole. Not a good host , makes his guest put out fires , clean up shit and rancid food.
---
You're guaranteed a spot fighting the colossus.  I've never been blocked from getting into the instance after I launched a nuke.  What are you talking about?
---
Alternative medicine is spicy.
---
Salty is the only thing I didn't get from the event. I mustve done the event 100 times too.
---
If you play the game a lot.. it‚Äôs worth it just for the atoms, survival tent and scrap box.   Makes the game a lot easier to play.
---
God damn. That has to be the best thing I've read all month about fallout 76.
---
2% is 2 times out of 100. Which means there are statistically 98 chances to not get the prizes. The 60-70 times OP did the event are part of those 98 chances, statistically speaking.
---
So, upon reflection-- if the limit is 100 or 150 per shot but someone has a dual, tri or quad shot weapon, then they could do up to 4x that amount of damage in one trigger pull right?
---
Of course not. This isn't Warframe's battle pass, it's a AAA game company's, lol.
---
David S. Pumpkins?
---
Well go do the new event and try and find the heads of earl. Took me twenty minutes to find.
---
True. I want variety over just do the same grind but different currency and ‚Äúrewards‚Äù and hopefully no reputation. I just realized that to get the Minigun and shotgun (without glitching) its a time gate locked behind a time gate. You have to get ally with them (one time gate) and then get enough gold to get the weapons and mods (2nd time gate)
---
So they can only PVP you inside the boundaries of the workshop, even after you claim it?
---
But the grognak gorilla taunt is awesome for when you win in NW or want to show off pumping the crew around you.
---
This one seems totally useless.
---
same :(( hopefully i'll find someone willing to trade
---
Some people are desperate for this to be a pvp game, whether you like it or not. Personally I'd be happy if they got rid of pvp outside of NW altogether.
---
If they're really annoying you, try nuking their camp. They might leave the server before it hits.
---
Just traded for my Vampire flaming shishkebab just for this reason. Hope I do not get to much hate ...lol. Project Paradise,  Radiation Rumble.  All good events to be able to heal NPC's
---
Ahh okay . Never thought to play the game like that but to each their own. Thanks
---
It burned out many players. Congratulations on making it that far!
---
lol, epic bethesda
---
I think it used to be different, but that's how it works now. As long as you're near the workshop you still get credit for the defense events.
---
And 3rd, to grind the scrip. And 4th, to actually craft the perfect roll
---
everything I've seen said the 26th. which is today.
---
IIRC, modded SS armor is still the best - I vaguely recall reading butressed has the highest stats, but I could be wrong.
---
You will need legendary modules (50 scrip per from mrgph) to craft the base armor.  Suprisingly, I got one piece as a reward from meat week.
---
Anyway - RNG dictates the number of stars and other features on your crafted armor.
---
IIRC, polished heavy metal has the best DR stats (117 torso, 54 or 56 each on the appendages), but lags a bit behind in RR, especially if you have the high capacity backpack mod.  I spent a lot of scrip getting 3\* WR metal set I have.
---
Still too squishy in higher level areas, so I find myself back in Excavator when I get into the mire or bog, as well as some locations in the divide.
---
Sorry, very little experience with scout armor.  The few pieces I had, I believe Polymer gave the highest stats.  I also know the mods you can buy from MODUS do not always specify to which variety of they apply, so you could spend a bunch of caps on mod plans only to find out they don't work with your armor.
---
Perhaps someone else can expound on the benefits/provide more detail.
---
Yeah try dropping something else. As long as you‚Äôre close to it it should work
---
Hah. What happens to your camp if it gets nuked does it get destroyed?
---
is it time for a .. ‚Äúit just works‚Äù comment? Lol
---
I logged on my wife's account to check and the same thing for her prize as well. Why does the legendary run have it's claimed status removed?
---
Thankyou man you literally read my mind with this post. How toxic can this guy get, seriously he needs to gtfo and stay out, it‚Äôs people like him that ruin games for us all.
---
Bethesda: "I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that."
---
Don‚Äôt fast travel out
---
There should be an animation or cinematic with sound effect and stuff.
---
Yes. That quest where you can steal an egg was very intimidating and I was nervous about going out there so low level. I snuck over there, yoinked an egg, and was clear in a couple seconds. It was a let down and I didn't even fight anything.
---
It breaks everything and they have to waste time and resources rebuilding it.
---
I can certainly make you Tenderizers if you want them and are on PC.  I'll be getting rid or scrapping the Spicy one hanging on my wall once I have a Legendary one to replace it, hopefully one with a 90% weight reduction.
---
Either die after looting earl and make sure when you do have something to protect from nuke zone or run out of mine and again make sure you can stay alive in nuke zone. And then you will get reward
---
True, Baby Mega Sloths cannot be tamed. Only the Sluggish Mega Sloth and only in a random spawn location.
---
I wouldn't personally call a newly added bullet sponge "challenging", though the mechanics of the event are amazing on their own, the whole mine thing and the "fear" the colossus inflicts are a great addition.
---
last years flag is on a pole.
---
I got the plan again this year, but it immediately went to "known" so I'm guessing its pole mounted again this year
---
Only because if you get pounded on with higher health bar is at 100% vs 20% wouldn't the sentinel effect hold up longer than bolstering and to keep stiming yourself add serindepidy to both
---
Would you trade one?
---
I was in a public team and one of my teammates joined with me, not easy to tell bunch people you don‚Äôt know that are doing their own stuff to leave what they‚Äôre doing and join can you?
---
And I would rather be only us three active there than having someone afk and leaching off of us, yea it didn‚Äôt change my battle much, (only bunch of rounds and repair kits lost to carry his ass) but the site of him standing still made my blood boil, it‚Äôs just something i am not okay with and don‚Äôt accept.
---
You get more animation from completing a daily. I thought it was an odd balance. I was interested in getting additional story.
---
You know, I'm going to keep that in mind. I just wish it didn't take quite so long to get through the silo to launch one but that's a fairly fitting revenge...
---
All the footage I've seen of people experimenting looks like you'll be okay.
---
Huh. So wait...you can still have a decent experience in event without a mic? I‚Äôve avoided most team stuff because of that and well..I like to imagine FO76 is still a solo game
---
Yeah that's the thing I'm concerned with now, I'm not sure how many things I'm going to have to delete now, I have some Gourds nearby that I can delete - but was using those to make the Cranberry Relish, I'm thinking I'm going to try getting rid of the two Gourds I have planted and hope that frees up enough space - as those crops tend to take up a lot, if not.. I guess the plushies are doomed.  Great idea with the storage room btw.
---
You should mount that rolling pin in your camp ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Great idea!!
---
Good to know, I honestly thought once you claimed a workshop people could just openly PVP you anywhere to try to claim it.
---
Always worked as far as I know. You can see the increase in damage in the Status tab and the 50% bonus in the effects tab after I pick myself up.
---
https://youtu.be/bc8QIMOv_AU
---
I get that sometimes when I load my 2nd account into my main account Private server. To remedy it, I do a hard reset on my main character. That always allows my 2nd account to join my private world after the reset.
---
On my 2nd account, in the social menu, if it shows my main account "offline". I load a different game, then reload into FO76. That usually resets my availability to allow my 2nd account to join my main private world.
---
Possibly. PS4. What are you thinking?
---
You can view that as a damage avoidance perk; avoiding unwanted Rads is useful. ;)
---
lmao imagine missing the point of the original post this badly
---
And for the record, if you have Fallout 1st or a friend that has it...use that for the workshop challenges. Taking workshops in AM is a pain and private servers make all the difference in the world.
---
Ive seen one once at silo alpha sitting in the pond
---
It‚Äôll all be dependent on how many of those generators you have/had in your camp, but no way to give an exact amount. Hopefully it‚Äôs not too much that you‚Äôll have to remove. Good luck!
---
Oh sorry i meant is the secret service armor the best not scout lol.  I saw there was solar and another type but the secret service sounds pretty good
---
Shit didn‚Äôt know it ended today. Luckily I traded for a tenderizer for a fixer plan and got pepper mod for it next event. I got all rewards numerous times except tato salad never got and tenderizer I got another plan last event last night. I will only missed out on two mods for tendy and salad. Glad I have a extra tendy so I can trade
---
r/DeathclawMating
---
Yup, looks good! I put some bone chimes also üòÇ
---
Claim the ones no wants like Berkeley
---
To be fair the raider one I believe is only available through a DLC and the factory is susceptible to being attacked by other players. You can get around this by paying an absurd amount of money just to play alone. This exploit is the only free way to get a ammunition factory (that is identical to the other ones) in your camp or other workshops. A lot of exploits aren‚Äôt necessary if you buy fallout 1st. Not everyone can afford that so in order to actually enjoy the game they need exploits to give them a basic things Bethesda should have for free. Like the infinite carry weight in the stash box. You should NOT have to pay for that.
---
If you realize its a nerf to all builds, quit calling it a bloodied nerf, its misleading AF.
---
Call it a damage nerf or a multiplicative nerf, because thats what it is, it does not solely affect bloodied.
---
I dont disagree that the nerf is going to hurt, but IMO its the right direction they need to go for a multiplayer game, your kinda stuck in the single player "I need to be god" Fallout mindset.
---
One shotting is tons of fun, until your the guy missing out on all the kills and loot because someone is faster than you and taking every kill. And I think thats one of major reason behind the recalc, to make the game more enjoyable for everyone, not just the ones that have optimized their build.
---
Of my 8 viable builds, 3 of which are bloodied, every single one including my 2 15 charisma support builds can onetap anything outside of end game bosses and sheep squatch, as much fun as it is, that isnt really right in a multiplayer enviroment.
---
My Vats sniper was one tapping lvl 68 super muties at the mid 40s, thanks to a low lvl instigating lever. Once you understand the perks and weapons its pretty easy to become OP.
---
Also if you just have to one shot everything, there are a ton of single player Fallout games you can achieve god hood in, just saying.
---
Appreciate the offer but I‚Äôm on PS4
---
It went for 6 days though.
---
That‚Äôs so weird, I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy gunner/unarmed melee and I do pretty good one shot damage, but lots of my points are just for convenience, I got 15 strength but I also have max intelligence just so I can build stuff. I got 3 levels of endurance which is ok by my and the rest of my stats are boosted by unyielding. If I‚Äôm one shorting almost everything I come across how optimized to builds get?
---
This.
---
It actually is annoying. Though with such low odds I surprised how many people got it. 
---
Besthdea should just stop adding things with stupid low drop rates.
---
I got my ass handed back to me went in using the Chinese SS and rifleman.  Yeah that went well.
---
Faster swing speed/90% reduced weight shishkabob is where it is at
---
I don't know this for sure but it could be that there was a team of 4 and then the 5th person was on a team of 4 and even though that their 3 teammates didn't join the event the game might have been holding spots for them.
---
I don't know if this is how it works but this is how I think it works.  I'm sure someone will let me know if I am wrong.
---
My go to for that deathclaw Skin farming challenge.
---
I‚Äôve just got past level 60 and would love some insight into launching nukes. Anyone wanna party up on Xbox?
---
I was expecting a deathclaw promontory experience and left thoroughly disappointed. Deathclaws don‚Äôt feel dangerous or scary in this game whatsoever. New Vegas was their peak, with FO3 being a close contender. There was a sense of palpable dread in those games when a deathclaw appeared and started stalking around looking for you, because unless you had really good gear or a great position, they‚Äôd toast your ass.
---
I don't understand. I thought that there was multiple instances that continued to spawn during the duration of the nukezone being active?
---
My guess rhey FT to U instead of a location so it kept them in the instance.   I‚Äôm just guessing here.  
---
But FT out the event does put u out the instance and hence why U didn‚Äôt get the rewards.
---
My fixer is only doing 54 damage... Anyone know why?  :(
---
Tell you what I‚Äôm glad deep pocketed is there gives me more hoarding abilities. I don‚Äôt have it on chest being I have jet pack but I can carry with out weight reduction stuff 560 and with that pocketed mod on legs and arms I can now with ribeye steaks or whatever I can carry 630. Amazing, I have all unyielding armor so it‚Äôs nice to have that much. I do have a nocturnal with weapon weight reduction that I put on if I‚Äôm in a pinch but I don‚Äôt see that happening anymore that I got 40 extra weight
---
Have you done the excavator power armour quest.def worth it.might want to do the sheepsquatch quest also to get a fixer plan.other than that it's free roam. A few quest stand out
---
Maybe. Commando‚Äôs usually do a rifle/stealth with vats sprinkled in and it‚Äôs a top build. Food builds are usually players who sacrifice a lot of their endgame dmg/protect buffs for lower hunger/lockpicking, or other QoL perks that just makes regular gameplay less tedious. 
---
The term can be held loosely, but generally it‚Äôs just someone who hasn‚Äôt committed to any other build. You can have a lot of commando perks but just not have some important ones to complete it and some could still consider it a food build.
---
Colossal winged deathclaw boss with baby deathclaw hordes
---
Yeah the perfect roll (one of the reason I went T-65 before SS) PA has no perfect rolls. But I‚Äôve made at least 16 Gauss miniguns and the best I got was a Mutant Slayer/FFR/15 vats Crit.
---
I hadn‚Äôt noticed but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. The last time I checked he would have hit the last space on Sunday September 6th, but the season is expected to end on Tuesday September 8th. 
---
Might have been a stealth-fix.
---
So is the one you guys are talking about that's exploited. What's your point? I watched someone wreck an entire camp with several of those ammo machines you guys have been exploiting. They are considered a camp item and can be destrpyed.
---
TAKE MY UPVOTE.
---
I was thinking about trying again in September, though I've already seen price hikes with the Tenderiser plans so nest sept is likely when i'll get it
---
I just checked, and it happened to me as well.
---
&gt;Some people consider a food build to be one that has even a single non-combat related perk.
---
The game really forces you to mix/max stats if you want to be effective, which sucks for us middle of the road folks, but I can't understand why anyone would be mad about how other people structure their characters.
---
As a bloodied build, that shaft is to be feared. 
---
Side note, maybe he should stick to kiting the windigos while higher levels kill them off...
---
Damn, I'm on xbox
---
Yeah, he's the go-to deathclaw for challenges. He exists solely to get shot so we can have a free hat or whatever.
---
I only lose my shit early if I drink coffee
---
That's what I was thinking
---
It seems that instances are bugged. I was put in an empty instance while the rest of my team had a full one. Plus the point of my post is that whoever launched the nuke should get a space in the first instance that almost always is full of high-level players
---
Yikes
---
The mistress quest has me going to the HQ area where I think the excavator armor is? I remember reading notes saying they were working on the suit at the HQ and it needed to be sabotaged so hopefully I can get that next. I‚Äôll look into sheepsquatch, I think I need to find someone near a sunken church next.
---
No sneaking capability or vats usage it looks like. No limb damage protection or explosive. Usually a commando or rifleman build has high agilty also.You will get staggered and crippled and blown up allot. I'd say it needs work
---
stay in there until it forces you out ...you do not have to leave ...this will make sure you get your reward
---
Yeah right what gives? I signed off early last night and said screw it i'll do it tomorrow, and i wake up, hop on only to find no more meat cook :(
---
Was once stationed there with my camp cross from the silo entrance and had to deal with a level 76 everytime I visited my camp. Got real annoying so I moved lol
---
Have them just restart their games and it fixes itself.
---
Same! Was choosing which spit to rotate for a few minutes. Thought it was weird that it was 1:05 and no event. Suddenly it was all gone. Just had to stand there for a second and feel empty =(
---
I would assume that in this case, there were 3 other people who joined the event before you did, and they filled out the group of 8. You were technically the 9th person to join, which started a second instance of the fight.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for when I do Secret Service armor. It‚Äôll be even more fun trying to get 5 perfect rolls. /s
---
I am so puzzled how people can deal with having constant yammering going on while they‚Äôre in their camp. I even bought the vault tec generators because they‚Äôre silent. Even just going to peoples camps to shop I‚Äôve heard some of these lines a hundred times already. I bought the slocums joe pack for the new vendors. Took all of two days before I scrapped them because of the constant buzzing and weird music they play non stop. Shit drives me nuts.
---
I have soloed...bloodied command with a 25/25 fixer and a 25/25 sub machine gun as backup.  I have barbarian3, bandolier2, blocker3. All the commando and tank killer 3s.  Ironclad 5, fireproof 1 radcool, lone wander4, nerd rage 3, gunsmith 3, action boy 2, covert operative 3, evasive 3, sneak 3, escape artist, adrenaline 1, bloody mess 3 and starched genes 2.  
---
Died a lot but if u stay under the drop point most the time and sneak crit a lot it he goes down in about 10 or so mins.  Just when he gets you or his minions you die.

Hope this helps!

I was AFK on drums in the middle yesterday wearing the same outfit and noticed the other 2 drummers were AFK dressed alike as me. People were coming over taking pics throwing emojis at us it was great!
---
Reminds me of Fasnacht this year.  Caught the very first parade "cool!". Show up again an hour later to do it again and just find a group of confused people standing around. "Oh, they pulled the event and delayed it after 1 go, nice."
---
that happened to me the first time
---
Nerf the legacies one shoting everything
---
Even Bethesda‚Äôs dates are bugged
---
It's not the build that defines the bitchiness, it's the attitude and the knowledge. Just because you are low health doesn't mean that your build is any good. :)
---
A level 40 ranting and raving about food builds while dying to virtually everything, including their own stupidity, is peak self own.
---
I am almost 150 and just realized I can't get the fixer because I missed a quest.  Having to go through and do that now.  There are a LOT of little quests out there that end with big rewards.  I would say hit up some sites listing the quests as well.  I just found this out after digging around why I didn't have that plan after doing Encryptid several times.  I hadn't unlocked it.
---
Maybe like Deathclaw Island. Drop a nuke and fight swarms of Deathclaws!
---
The dates and times were posted so
---
Lol that's the entire game tho, launch a nuke kill the queen okay thats it no grand finale wtf not going to say the rest do to spoilers but it's pretty much repeat with a feeling of emptiness for completion
---
This needs to be soon to make up for the bugs
---
It‚Äôs on a pole, sadly. I wish it was a wall flag.
---
More female outfits!
---
Is there a mod on Xbox to shut up all the whiny little bitches ten times my level who report me for cheating when they can‚Äôt kill my optimised PvP build?
---
So I didn‚Äôt play every hour being I work full time and got wife and kids. So this weekend was the most I got to play it but every Night I would play it every time it popped. I have every plan except two mods for tenderizer and the salad plan. I got lucky with the tenderizer being I found someone on Xbox that traded me it for a fixer plan and last night as I‚Äôm about to goto bed and after we take earl down I say I‚Äôll goto cook off and I get another tendy plan. And now that I realized the events are over I def have more chance of getting something decent from it. I know for a fact if I didn‚Äôt get lucky and trade for one I would‚Äôve never gotten one. As I never got the 3 rare masks from faschnat. I only recently got a raven mask for trading one of my winter mans. But yeah it should‚Äôve been easier to get
---
I was definitely expecting a "Congratulations, it's over" pop-up or something.
---
&gt;Edit to say I finished yesterday and completed some today just out of playing. Weird seeing the award of nothing.
---
This is exactly my point. I'm doing stuff with my community and seeing dailies complete...and getting nothing from them. It's a huge let down.
---
I revive everyone as long as they aren't being little shits on area chat. We're in this together and if I have any say about it we all survive this together. :)
---
Where do you guys get these mods I hear about
---
That's what it is designed for and why we were hurt by the absence of it so far. I use it too bcs I have like 200cw worth of scrip on me, which I can't seem to get rid of and it keeps piling up. Without it I would rather get the ultralight or maybe brawling/stabilized. But 150 scrip a day says I have to use deep pockets.
---
I started running around firing my 50 cal machine gun into the sky in despair.
---
define "effective".
---
I have a bloodied stealth rifleman that can still ohk mooks so for me that means that character is indeed effective.  But if your definition of effective is something else than I don't know.
---
It will still be the best dps build in the game, but it will not be nearly as powerful as it is now.
---
I would pee in its butt
---
I just finished the run yesterday and I don't think I ever encounter this bug
---
There's a reason why they included a ammo crafting legendary perk
---
Yeah, I never used them back in Fallout 4 cause of how low-tier they were, but I had all my raiders wearing them to give the look of a truly terrifying gang taking over the Commonwealth. I'd kill to be able to just use it as clothing in 76.
---
Some lads will be there banging the drums until xmas. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Probably just a kid. I'm personally working on a Bloodied high health commando build (which require food, alcool and drug buffs ) Overall, in high intense fights, i should be more efficient than a typical full optimised bloodied build.
---
But this dude...must be a kid.
---
Yeah.your on a good path.i dont use power armour but excavator w shocks adds 200lb carry weight which is a plus when you do need it.the garb of mysteries quest is definitely one that would be very nice to add on to
---
Useful cards to collect: chemist, super duper (3* is 30% chance to make double of whatever you‚Äôre making), starched genes (2* means you don‚Äôt gain or lose mutations - might be worth trying some out. Marsupial was a huge game-changer for me, and now that it‚Äôs trivial to be on a team, Herd Mentality seems a no-brainer to get a boost on all stats.)
---
Definitely get the excavator armor - lots of carrying capacity and 4x yield for lead ore nodes in Lucky Hole when you need lead for ammo. (You also need acid to smelt it into lead scrap.) Add the calibrated leg mod to the armor and that‚Äôs an extra 50lbs of carry per leg.
---
üòÇ I've been trying to get a SS chest piece with a great roll for so long. And I've only gotten one single piece that's had my primary perk I was looking for. Lol
---
Meat week is every night for me.
---
In my bedroom with the lights off. üòâ
---
I never did either until today.
---
Mount it?! Hell, I'm going to build a shrine of Harambes worshiping it!
---
Thanks for that, I had no idea.  As I've leveled I've moved away from QoL perks to more damage output/reduction ones but I really don't want to play bloodied.  I'm currently mostly in a rifle build that does OK enough for how I play but I know I'm not optimized.
---
It seems like they added the Helmet!
---
Was this on Xbox last night? You guys looked like the one I played in a group with last night
---
Yeah, same. The entire stage just vanished and he left with his beloved moo moo. It was sad. :(
---
Giving the players double xp for couple days is highly needed for people like you who missed out on scores because of them! I really hope they would be kind enough to do so
---
So you go on about helping lower level players and acting like your some white knight while still referring to them as ‚Äúlowbies‚Äù man get some help.
---
Could have sworn it said 28th on the startup screen. Maybe I need better glasses lol. ITV does say 26th 12:00pm ET, so yeah its ended now.
---
Haha! Thank you kind vault dweller! Though considering the state of things, it's not saying much, but I'll take it!
---
...I want to believe this but I feel like this is a joke
---
brussel sprout is fucking delicious
---
Stealth commando is still great on PTS. The main problem you‚Äôre going to run into is in Daily Ops. You can‚Äôt use stealth at all in Daily Ops (due to one of the modifiers that‚Äôs always present). You‚Äôre prob gonna want to consider adding another modifier like bloodied or junkies
---
I was shocked. I thought it was only Cursed weapons or armor based on previous runs.
---
its kind of hard to explain without writing an essay, because each character has a different damage formula and its not always clear what goes where in those formulas
---
You got bethesded
---
Last night I had a packed Meat Cook, I was on the drums with 2 others, we had 2 people dancing infront of us, one on mic saying this was the best BBQ ever.
---
I choose to believe that was my last Meat Cook, and a mighty fine send off to an amazing week
---
Few more of these nuke boss events and I‚Äôm down to keep playing another year or so, Bethesda!!
---
Being done with that slog was epic enough. I've finished weeks ago and I never knew how much control that dumb season had over my playstyle until I was done with it. Holy crap.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand statistics..... that 98% likelihood is after 1 roll of the dice. You need to add attempts together to get the likelihood of not getting after x number of attempts. 
---
2 times out of 100 is the same as 1 out of 50.
---
The odds of not getting the plan after 70 attempts is only 24%. Said another way, you have a 76% likelihood of getting the plan after 70 attempts. 
---
Maths:
---
(1-odds of getting it)^number of attempts. 
---
(1-.02)^70=24.3% likelihood of not getting after 70 attempts
---
Statistically speaking, he should have got it by now, more likely than not.
---
Psn: SirCreamcorn. I'm not great either but I got splodey guns that go bang on enemies real good.
---
So a waste of my precious ultracite. 308 ammo!
---
Yep , after 5 builds and previous ‚Äúre-balancing ‚Äú  
---
I‚Äôm a not grinding out  a new character , just finished my unyielding sentinel Secret service set, after close to 1000 modules used.. they already lost a huge player base of beta players.  No one I played with for 2 years still logs on. This will be the final nail in the coffin. 
---
RIP FO76
---
Also why must daily ops render users of the Chinese SS useless? 
---
I have to ask u/valseek why give us the suits if you then ensure they're pointless for your new Ops? I 100% would be behind a few enemies having the negate stealth perk, but all of them?
---
When 22 lands the masses are going to find out whats been nerfed and how their builds work. and while the meta followers will be out dropping unsolicited advice, the hate will flow and Bethesda you will have a shitstorm on your hands from a casual gaming crowd.  
---
I know you have said down the line you plan to perhaps buff up weapons using the new systems for calculation you have implemented.  I strongly urge you to delay 22 until you have sorted out the balance as OP has suggested, but please consider sorting out stealth in daily ops.
---
I would like to help, but I take a less direct approach. I avoid fighting the robots but if you want we can.
---
The one where you escort Brahmin it's handy too.
---
That's my kind of bug! Though real world thinking, it makes sense that a nuke dropped a couple miles away would have an impact on much of our little corner of Appalachia.
---
Bitching about bitching seems terribly ironic...
---
I only saw it twice in about 30 cookouts
---
does it let you wear glasses with it? I am gonna assume no but it would be cool.
---
That would be nice.found a junkies ss one
---
60 seconds is the maximum penalty for dying AFAIK. If you aren't penalized  for dying where is the challenge?
---
Does anyone know if glow sight includes damage to All legendary‚Äôs( cause they glow green) or just to Irradiated enemy‚Äôs?
---
Deep fried and wrapped in bacon? Maybe.
---
As you watched the event fade away, did your SCORE fade away as well?
---
I'll sell if you still need it. @velociraptoring on PS4
---
Just edited the post with a screenshot. Note that this is xbox and we had a patch yesterday.
---
Yeah I think when the game first came out some skills just said ‚Äúincreases shield capacity by a substantial amount.‚Äù Like no actual numbers just vague wording.
---
My mate got me to do it yesterday morning, man it was great an first go I got that cursed pickaxe too that thing is a monster, next we tried it again an hour later sadly it the Randal bugged into the ceiling rip.
---
But we went in for round three after my mate did a silo run (gave him the axe as he's a 2H melee build), the event is killer &amp; I got a second axe my mate thinks I'm lucky now lol (as he wasn't so lucky getting a medic western revolver), but the biggest take of this event is the screws as one battle I walked away with 300 screws.
---
Draw back the amount of ammunition you'll go through with it is crazy but it's one crazy demonic fight,.
---
We plan to do a few more today but I'll probably be scrapping the barrels with what limited ammo I have left now, the event is so much fun an I wish there was more big boss battles in Fo76.
---
Exactly my problem and recently I just started transferring my overhaul to my 4 alts. And then I just keep getting filled up and stuff I don‚Äôt want to get rid of I keep but then all the stuff I can‚Äôt scrip sucks. So I need it. But I‚Äôm happy for right now with buttressed and deep pocketed. Wish it was like this the whole time. But yeah I wish they would up the daily scrip limit or give us like scrip notes so we can at least get rid of the stuff. I never sell my stuff being I am always usually near max caps. Only time I do sell is like one or two star stuff after I hit daily limit. I sell to vendor bots
---
It's the auto complete bug. Has been around for a long time.
---
My brother who played the game no more than a total of 2 hours at the time got the tenderizer plan first meat week :/
---
Welcome back! This game is a lot of fun and way undervalued! I hope to see you in the game fellow vault dweller!
---
Tank killer perk is being added to handguns ..not sure if its live yet
---
so much acid and so many screws. Great farming there for sure.
---
Rifleman here too, thinking of keeping the perks and guns for the impending shitstorm due when 22 lands, but going anti-armour and commando.
---
When I launched a nuke the first time after completing the main quest line, the Queen fight felt like this epic finale. I can totally see how it could go the complete opposite direction.
---
Omg it's real ü§≠ awesome, thanks for the post! I'm going to check it out when I get home tonight
---
This makes sense. I mean, Grahm has always been everyones favorite door to door salesman
---
You idea gives you the chance to clean out the extractors while a pvp player is claiming it and can't kill you. Workshops are a risk reward area, where you take the risk pf pvp for resources. You want all reward and no risk.
---
ACP isn't SBQ. Gotta have top tier stuff to be really viable. Glad I reached that before it came out otherwise I'd be bitching too.
---
I tried darn hard to get that ss/90. Its ghouls slayer so no damage but dont use it for damage lol
---
Aye no one should bitch about builds tbh, if you can carry your own weight(which it sounds like you can) who cares? Don‚Äôt gotta be bloodied
---
What i see here is a weak attempt to draw viewers to your lame YouTube channel
---
It's a relatively common bug that has been around since the Season started.
---
Bethesda is aware of it, but are unable to do anything to compensate people affected by it and it sure seems like they have no idea how to fix it.
---
I noticed throughout many online games; you‚Äôll have people who bitch &amp; whine. Their IQ isn‚Äôt very up to par; whether it be a condition or just lack of proper critical thinking skills. Have patience with them, or just avoid them.
---
Is credit still given even though it's marked as complete? How are we supposed to finish up the challenges for the season?
---
Wasn't one of the ATLAS rewards an extra week of Meat week? They passed us on the concrete to get the sign even though we were nowhere close but not this one?
---
Yo fuck these guys they are brutal. Level 35 in power armor and it wrecked me. I think it was 52. Handed me my lunch. Granted it was fun
---
You got it. Each level up from here on out you can get a new perk card OR swap a special point.
---
You stop getting free shit
---
You won't get any more points to distribute to your SPECIAL stats, but you still get level up points. You can rank up cards with them or move SPECIAL points around.
---
Sickkkkk. Wait...which platform are you on? I‚Äôm on PC.
---
No unfortunately
---
Unlimited perk cards every 5 levels. Farm for gear and get flux.
---
Such a classic phenomenon. Idiots who just copy the "meta" build without understanding how to play are always the ones who complain loudest about the poor bastards who get stuck carrying their worthless asses.
---
You can with the nuka girl helmet so maybe
---
Forgot about that one. üëçüëç
---
It seems like 4 or less players and the "Wendys" become almost unmanageable. There were points where there had to be more than a dozen of the little buggers chasing us. It makes for a fun challenge, but staring down that horde with no AP in the middle of reload? Not fun.
---
Nope. And there's nothing customer service will do about it. You're just sol man sorry
---
Such bullshit. I play daily and haven't encountered it until this past Monday morning and has been going on since...
---
I fell asleep with my controller taped down running into the wall of one of the tents hoping to get a few rewards while I slept, got 2 cow suits and another peppered mod........was hoping to wake up and have the backpack plans, wanted that so bad
---
I got a peppered plan and used it before I realized it's for a weapon I can't even get.
---
Food builds?
---
Seen a few at scorch beast queen fight, those things really get the jump on you if you're just crouch walking around playing without audio üòÇ1 hit me no matter what
---
As a full time worker I was more than happy to have revived the backpack plan! Working sucks when fun events such as fashnacht and meatweek occur!
---
Yay, I can switch out my Clean Spacesuit Helmet with this and have it actually look like it belongs.
---
.....what is a food build?
---
How are you tanking bloodied
---
Yes, you will still earn cards every level and packs every 5 levels. You also get to reallocate points if you decide your build is now working. The big thing I would suggest doing is getting perks to help with other things besides fighting, the cards for finding magazines and Bobble heads are good to pick up for sure.
---
aw. Still great that it finally works ha
---
It was actually true :D had to go to the screen and reclaim it.
---
sure I 'm down!
---
mine did, first time it's happened so far, too, because i totally blanked on the time while trying to get the tenderiser plan.
---
i did not get the tenderiser plan.
---
My favorite part is the effort you took into proving my original point.
---
All honesty level 40s shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed in that event they die a lot anyways
---
cool!
---
An optimized build can also be called a food build.
---
Especially melee gets strong buffs from food.
---
I think it‚Äôs my MMO healer personality, but I do the same in FO76, heh. I really enjoy helping others and reviving when needed.
---
Well, there was this one time i was overencumbered and hobbled to a nearby camp only to find the doors locked.
---
I forgot it wasn't ending tomorrow and logged out early last night. Oh well I guess!
---
Luckily haven‚Äôt had that happen but was told once outside you need to wait for the event to complete before leaving the area.  the time that it takes to run out has to finish needs to end
---
I agree there should be a penalty. But a full minute to respawn? And on a timed event where you need at least four more people than yourself to succeed?
---
That sucks a lot, it happened the first time meat week happened, I got 2 plans for mods for the Tenderiser and no weapon. 
---
Fingers crossed you get it nest time üôÇ
---
You on PC?  I think I have like 8 of those.
---
Yay! üòÅüòÅ
---
Hate to be those people who went on a break after completing the season while waiting on season 2. Hopefully they have a chance to claim the reward later on.
---
No just enemies that have glowing in the name. Which is a lot and usually the top level variants of most things.
---
Edit: So legendary glowing whatever yes. Regular legendary no.
---
It‚Äôs not proving your original point. Statistically speaking, it‚Äôs unlikely that he would not get it after 70 rolls.
---
Get them eyes checked, my dude.
---
What‚Äôs your ign? I‚Äôll add ya
---
It‚Äôs always about stretching content; supply and demand babyy
---
What you did there ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I see it.
---
LOL, no, I actually hit 100 yesterday.  On Mon though I lost a bunch of SCORE by being logged in when the time flipped over.  I would have been done then had that not happened.
---
Pick a build, make that build, come on here and brag about that build.
---
Alright, I‚Äôm not home right now but I‚Äôll be home at around 5PM MDT Time if your still in by then. I‚Äôll PM my GT.
---
I think they added the helmet to go with the suits.
---
Your best bet would be to keep an eye on the roadmap on the website. It's far from perfect but it generally lets you know when you should expect things like that.
---
&gt;To be fair, I've been told by PVPers that anything is a food build as long as there is one QoL perk in the build.
---
LOL! You mean "bubble wrap babies"? The ones that wrap themselves in a whole set of Assassin's Sentinel armor and tool around with every legacy they could dupe, along with 1000 Quantums? The ones that couldn't PvP their way out of a wet paper bag without all their crutches?
---
The only thing they're an authority on is being insufferable jackhole griefers.
---
I got the chemist backpack mod off of raiders which reduced my aid weight by like 100 lbs which is more than what a possum badge backpack upgrade gives ya, a lot of players carry a lot of chems on them and they don't even realize it.
---
i've problly made over 150,000 ( i have 3 bank toons) caps since the game added the vender sales purly selling plans. ive horded them at first for friends, then it became a habbit and now i run 4 vending machines with all plans. event items usally sell for the highest and fastest. while a vendor robot will problly give you 10 caps... ill stick with people sales. plus i give away all the free food, water and have a full crafting station set up for peoples needs as a bonus
---
3rd party mods can get you banned. 
---
Key word: can
---
Not saying you will, but it‚Äôs a possibility
---
Yeah I got hit with it once 2 weeks ago. 
---
When Bethesda finally acknowledged it, they said it was a "rare" occurrence and that they added a method of tracking it to try to figure out what causes it, but that was back before the last patch, and they haven't said anything since.
---
Customer support can't do jackshit about it either.
---
Some people say you should avoid being online when the dailies reset (12 PM EST) but others say that doesn't have any effect.
---
All we can hope is they fix it before the next season.
---
I understand fully also my title is not mentioning anything about the discussion. Look I just want to have fun in this game and one-shoting everything is fun. Also I do not  like single player in this game as its supposed to be multiplayer. Also I might get hate but I enjoy PVP and no i am not toxic. I bring that up just because I might one-shot everything alone when I am in a event or with friends I don't  and use my op items I let them get a shot a proceed to dispatch of that enemy. Because not all PVPers are toxic. I just find PVP and one-shoting things fun taking the one-shoting part of the game removes most if not all fun for me I hope you understand.
---
If so, it will render Thorn armor completely useless.
---
Because SS uses the same mods as raider, trapper, etc, I don‚Äôt think it will get shadowed mods.  None of those have shadowed as an option.
---
Then again, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me much.
---
Yes but if optimized builds are reporting doing 50% less damage, than everyone's gonna need a good build when it comes to ACP.
---
Im not worried about anything else.
---
do you know what the word "unlikely" means? if not, I really don't have time to continue the discussion.
---
You don‚Äôt earn special points but every level you have the chance of selecting a new card or moving a point from one special to another.
---
Can't even properly do bloodied at level 40, you can't even unlock nerd rage and class freak til level 46 (then add 6 more level ups to max rank them both). Without nerd rage you're going to die a LOT and mutations suck a lot of life out of you without class freak.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, as much as we both want you to be.
---
That's always appreciated! The game is a group effort c:
---
Nah dude it's probably because Mark the Intern is a fucking moron and can't get anything right, and Jerry in Management is too busy trying to sleep witk Carol in Accounting to keep track of the project and agenda and won't stop scheduling meetings so he looks good on paper.
---
It was the dart gun for me that changed deathclaws from a terrifying prospect in fo3 to a slight irritant.
---
Once you crippled it's legs you could easyly run away from it and deal with it
---
Happens to the best of us my friend
---
Now you figure out what kind of build you want to be(I recommend checking out Nukes &amp; Dragons if you're not sure), tweak your points/level up your perk cards, and start grinding for end-game gear.
---
I feel this was to encourage us working to earn the second helping of Meat Week when the second set of resource gathering goals go live.
---
The ones we had in 76 weighed 10 pounds and gave like 20 DR/ER iirc. They counted as outfits too so we could wear armor under them still, unlike Fallout 4. Still kind of mad that Bethesda removed those and not the nuke miniguns or the beamsplitter .50 cals...
---
Carousel ‚Äî Renewal
---
Never go with the hivemind. Had friends who told me the game was bad because they saw some reviews and YouTubers piling on on it.
---
It baffles me, no mans sky got a pass from the gaming community because it improved, but fo76 is forever lost...
---
Glad you did the "research" and tried it for yourself.
---
I thought it was up until tomorrow for some reason.  Primal Cuts was good XP, at least in the Bog.
---
Now we need like 3 more and we got base mmo world bosses after almost 3 years imo . But yes its good.
---
And that excludes the occasional ‚Äúlow‚Äù level that has a fully optimised build. Below level 55 or so, you‚Äôre not gonna have a complete build, but at level 28 I soloed radiation rumble with no scavver deaths and hit rank 2, thanks to my already powerful 2H melee build.
---
I am having the same problem. You cannot collect the blood sample a second time.
---
Thanks, will do
---
Fuuuuck I‚Äôm on console
---
Yes....
---
It is unlikely to not roll a 2 on a 100 sided die after 70 roles. The likelihood of that happening is only 24%. If you asked 100 people to do the same experiment, 76% of them would roll a 2 within the 70 rolls. 
---
Likely=more likely than not. 
---
Unlikely=less likely than not. 
---
It is more likely than not that you would get the plan after 70 attempts.
---
A 24% likelihood is unlikely in my book. Maybe you think differently.
---
[I imagined this](https://youtu.be/PS1PZxrwv2Q)
---
Food perks are powerful - ignoring food in the game is foolishness.
---
Deathclaw matriarch, I miss the varients NV introduced :c
---
Sooo? What was the solution for you?
---
Its almost like one dude doesnt represent the entire instantly downed after doing a badly calculated jump builds
---
;)
---
in NV it was the holorifle that made them easier to deal with but I still kept my distance cuz they close that gap fast
---
But they won't unless a significant amount of the player base all voiced this opinion, then they might. Sadly it seems players are happy with the state of the game since they continue to buy atoms and or fallout 1st
---
I've run bird bones for months and months. I had a ton of mutations and I wanted to get rid of grounded to improve gatling lasers, thinking that might help shoot Earle better. When I put back on mutations I decided to skip bird bones and see how that goes. First thing I did was jump down the hole and almost die.
---
As a sneaky sniper build I'm always crouched anyways, but I only go after the unclaimed workshops if I happen to get the quest while wandering the area. I claim the workshop to get the "claim workshop" quest rewards and mayybee keep it long enough to do the PvE defend workshop quest - either way I server hop to drop the workshop ownership flag right after and go on my merry way. I try not to stay long enough for the pvp-ers to show up
---
I don't even use power armor or a meta tactic, I just have a combo of marine and combat armor pieces w/ deep pockets bc I'm a loot-all-the-things casual. I guess I don't look like a worthwhile target even at level 125
---
I would like them to post a time lapse of how they do it so consistently!
---
Big power armor and big guns definitely mask the crouched stealth commando in the corner who is actually doing all the damage; but if you need a revive, big power armor boii gotchuu
---
You are right, from this point of view it doesn't seem likely. But if they started this trend of adding missing mods, my fingers are crossed they continue it and add it. SS would be the ultimate armor and I thought it was always intended intended to be.
---
No idea but they are glowing in collosal problem so glow sight works
---
I'd like to know too if ghoul slayer works, ive got a GS  explosive gattling gun I might try out there
---
I've jumped in plenty of times sub-lvl 50 and pulled my weight
---
Im surprised not enough people mention the loss of so many death animations that you can do and get done on u.
---
And also cry about other builds being stronger than yours
---
No problem! This sub will also usually light up with posts about anything significant coming up in the weeks/days leading up to whatever it is so you can also just keep an eye on what's posted about a lot. 
---
I figure we'll probably get one in September or maybe October with the Brotherhood stuff. They usually capitalize on new content with free weekend and/or double XP.
---
I almost did it the other day because it was my first time and I had no idea lol
---
No point, most players I have actually got to revive are bloodied builds that instantly go back down, it's a waste of resources and I only carry 5-10 stimpaks.
---
I've seen this request since a few weeks after launch...
---
The grind is over....
---
The real grind begins
---
I feel this might be accurate as I have gotten into Colossal Problem and had only 5 people, then after no one was coming from my team I left it and suddenly new people were able to join in.
---
There's a chest mod that reduces the magnitude of incoming staggers.
---
That's mostly just how Yao Guais are though. Those bears are stagger machines, once they get ahold of you they just jackhammer you into oblivion, it's crazy. Best thing to do is just make sure you drop them before they get to you. 
---
Do you play in first or third person perspective?
---
The more optimized the build is, the more the nerf impacts them.  The least impacted builds will be the ones with fewer damage multipliers stacked.
---
‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt shake these nightmares. Floating in space forever... just... why?‚Äù X1000 while at my camp
---
I think there is some confusion about the event. It's not that it is undoable for non Bloodied builds or magic weapon users, it's that it's eating your ammo by the truckload if you aren't one.
---
The adds dropping the ammo type you use is definitely a step in the right direction.
---
Pretty sure it's any enemy whose name is prefixed by "glowing." You know, like Glowing Mutant Hound or Glowing Stingwing. This doesn't affect all legendaries though as not all of them are "Glowing." That's my understanding.
---
Yeah thats what I do to leave the world.. but a 'join new world' option next to it is what I am asking for haha
---
Don't feel bad, I attended the event at least 72 times.  I got the Tenderizer plan ONCE.  Got a lot of other things though, I'm awash in Chally suits, helmets and backpack plans.
---
Lol well call me a food build cause I don‚Äôt ever want to play without thru-hiker, good with salt, traveling pharmacy and the junk one again. I love picking up every little thing in every dungeon and scrapping it all down and storing it. Thru hiker alone reduces my carry capacity by over 100 when I equip it and I have 9 charisma to share it with my friend when we play and she exclaimed ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù out loud when she saw how much of a difference it made. 
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll faze some of these perks out eventually and get some really good combat perks I‚Äôd at least temporarily swap out for while doing events in a couple dozen levels (I‚Äôm just past level 50 as of now). However I chose them I‚Äôd much rather spend my early game with efficient and convenient perks like those I listed to make the gameplay experience more casual and fun with less inventory micromanagement.
---
I still wonder why the helmet costs so much
---
Yes it will have higher impact, but you're still doing more damage with more perks than without.
---
My whole point is if most don't have a good build after the nerf ACP is going to be hell.
---
Edit: is no one gonna try and dispute, or just downvote?
---
Yeah I've been working forever to finish my last two scout quests to get the +120 backpack for that same reason, just can't find robot armor arm plans anywhere, or Unstoppables #4. These days I spend way too much time fast traveling to player vendor machines and armor workbench sites, it's driving me crazy.
---
lol this is gold.
---
Meat week this year was so disappointing, primal meats was broken for almost all locations. Instead of the mobs coming to the drum you had to go look for them or else you failed the event. You had to deal with high level players 1 shotting the final prime beast. I found myself doing the other boring events more often than Primal Meats and it was heartbreaking since last year it was such a great event to join.
---
No you don‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt use scaly skin. I need that ap. And you need about 34 luck with critical savvy to have every other shot refil your crit meter. Hold the crit button while in vats while shooting helps too w/o having to keep tapping crits.
---
Yes. 10000000%. The sole reason I never bother with battle royale games is the wait time between them. You have one life, everything on the line then BOOM, 2 minutes in you are dead with 85xp and a 5 minute+ wait until you get into the next game
---
Yeah there's always alot near the monument
---
I wish they'd patch bloodied out tbh or just make it harder to sit permanently on low health and get so many bonuses. It's obviously intended to be a final rush before you die and not a sit on low health and become god tier powered all the time.
---
At the same time I don't want them to cuz I've seen plenty of nice bloodied players. It's probably just that it's super meta that a lot of a-holes use it all the time.
---
I asked the question a few days ago &amp; never really got a straight answer. I know it doesn't work on Earle.
---
I'm on PS4
---
That sucks.  Maybe wait more than an hour?  Idk.  I have been lucky so far.  But I am expecting for it to happen one day.
---
I wish you luck, I was lucky enough to get about 15 chally moo-moo outfits myself.
---
It took me a lot of events to get every plan as well, it was getting slightly annoying after getting outfit after outfit. Gonna do more the next week and hopefully get some more tenderizer plans.
---
That would be pretty nice, I finished it Sunday and just have little reason to keeping playing right now.
---
To flex on the new players. Idk. The vault raid armor helmet is expensive as well.
---
I thought this as well, but the helmet still isn't in the helmet category in the Armor Workbench...
---
Edit: I just read Valseek's post on Beth.net,  I guess I'll check better later, it was probably put in another category.
---
welcome to adulthood......
---
Reduced fall speed is a good thing
---
Getting the one batch, isn't much of a reward. Particularly if you just took the place. Meanwhile if You even happen to be there You're going to do the extractor circuit and then store your junk thing anyway.
---
So this reward idea of yours kind of hinges on the idea that someone's going to go back to their workshop. Notice that they've just been ejected and happened to have a bunch of running but unlocked extractors.
---
I'm assuming that the instant you get kicked out of the ownership of the workshop you would stop owning the locks as well, so you would have to break into your own locked extractors.
---
So it's not all reward and no risk, it's just a completely different paradigm.
---
Of course I never locked my extractors anyway because I'm playing as if it's all of us against the environment because I'm supposedly aligned with everybody else who came out of the vault.
---
There are plenty of single axes analysis that will make one thing seem to stand out in favor of another, but taken as a whole I think what I've proposed is actually quite well balanced.
---
If the extractors are unlocked then the PVP player can empty the extractors before claiming the base. If the extractors are locked then the non PVP player loses ownership and access to the locked extractors.
---
So there's just a different layer of tactics to this particular issue
---
A food build? Whats that?
---
Find high ground. There are few but there are places, just look.
---
We try(rip my stimpak collection) but I treat people how I‚Äôd want to be treated... nothing‚Äôs worse than dying and having someone jack your junk
---
ok thanks, not really interested in stuff, probably the stuff that looks interesting to me is the ammo machine, the crop floors and grenades for the crops .. not interested too much in weapons or outfits myself. I have lots of characters, so not the end of the world I guess.
---
On the 7th day, Grahm saw the outhouse and declared it right and good for he was backed up from 6 days of red meat and no greens.
---
Agreed.  I played at launch, then lost interest last year after starting a new job.  I just redownloaded it and have been taking my time and taking in all the lore and scenery and it's been great.
---
I first heard the term from some obnoxious PVPer youtubers who quit after wastelanders because they weren't specifically being catered to.
---
One wasteland isn‚Äôt an event. It‚Äôs an upcoming update.
---
Good idea, just mentioned I have many characters, so probably will do that
---
Radstag moshpit
---
Cool
---
i turn in 5.56 to get 0.50
---
I just saw that based on what someone just told me. Nice
---
I went once and saw two people dressed up and taking pictures together and emoting. I thought, hey what the heck, I have that outfit too. Changed into my suit and we all played the drums together too. Gave me an laugh. Honestly one of my favorite things about this game are little moments like that.
---
Thank you üôÇ Hopefully you get more yourself. 
---
Those outfits and backpack. I've been giving them away üòÅ I got too many of them.
---
Aw, the infamous Grognak continuity errors. It's no wonder the Grelok Battle Through Time arc is widely considered the weakest Unstoppables story, given how badly it breaks canon. Because as we all know, canon is all that matters.
---
Bloodied gatling
---
We need more heavy weapon guys
---
I have enjoyed a full support character this most.  I run empath, team medic, and a medic HM.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works
---
Oh fuck yes. Do you know if the underground is still doable?
---
Ah bummer. Man I wish there was cross play. Well good luck and I hope you get it as a drop in Septembers meat week.
---
That's an unfortunate truth xD
---
Daily ops is nothing compared to ACP. Especially now that they fixed the robots spawn camping you. That was the only difficult thing before. It was almost like you were getting staggered before you even got controls on a respawn.
---
Earl in ACP has 30,000 health and his DR scaling starts where the SBQ's scaling ended. He scales from 300 to 400 DR, the Queen only scales up to 300DR max.
---
The times I've done ACP on the PTS when there were mostly high level heavy gunners there when they were all shooting him you couldn't even see the bar move. The one where we had mostly commando builds (5 or so) you could barely see it move. So far every time I've done it we weren't able to complete it, partly because so many people were quitting because they were annoyed with how little damage we were doing. Every time so far it's ended with less than 5 people because the others left early. If that's how it's going to be when this goes live it's going to suck.
---
The nerf for the rest of the game, including daily ops, is not really a problem. I actually enjoy the extra difficulty a lot.
---
The damage calculation fix isn‚Äôt what one wasteland is, that‚Äôs a bug fix
---
1v1 me ill bring out my B/E/SS/S/CAT/25252525 gatling plasma against your noob food build
---
It's not Bloodied that needs fixing. It's the combination with Unyielding and a couple of perks that makes the build so OP. A full set of UNY armor adds 15 points to all specials but Endurance. That's absolutely bonkers. And there is nothing like that for high levels. Imagine Vanguard doing the same but for full health builds. That would be even more insane. :)
---
If anything they need to limit the stack to max 3 armor pieces or something. That's still 9 to all specials, END excluded, but it's more in line with what other builds can achieve by drugging up or eating the right types of food.
---
I tried to have many characters but I had to settle on 2...trying out like 7 different builds at once was overwhelming lol
---
Completely game changing. I think the overall process went well. It could use balance to make it apart of the game and not the entire game. Things for both high level and low lower. Discover multiple locations, launch a nuke, etc. Maybe almost a challenges tab for the entire length of the legendary run.
---
In my experience, my arrows landed 75% and missed 25% in vats; despite it being at 95% hit chance in vats. Theeen you have to reload which takes forever. Just got fixer stealth commando like every1 else. I kno you want to be different, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you will be happy
---
Plus there is a damage cap to most bosses like sbq; so it‚Äôs better to do fast &amp; strong damage compared to slow &amp; really strong damage.
---
Well at least he gave it back, so that's something.
---
Yeah I just finished it today. I clicked it and was like well I guess I have everything now and started farming resources to build another jet pack
---
Maybe they should just make healing weapons to make it more obvious
---
You load before your perks and any other character stats.
---
Just a little something would have been nice.
---
Pfft! Entitled much?
---
No word of a lie I once sat queueing for Nuclear Winter so long that I started and finished an entire match in Fortnite by the time we were choosing where to drop in Morgantown. I now only try to play at peak North American times and hope for the best. I used to love the mode to death but all the little things start to add up and now I only really switch to NW for the extra S.C.O.R.E.
---
Even as melee I just can‚Äôt say no to that lovely dmg reduction
---
lol imagine being that guy who gets triggered over things like this and calls people cheaters.
---
Kill the super mutants at West Tek usually 2 of them, and then there is a spawn through the locked doors in one of the first rooms on the right. Sitting along the back, not hard to see.
---
Can't wait to see the reasoning behind why the paddle ball is included in that list
---
Although, it WAS treated as a legendary weapon early on, flashing on your screen and being impossible to scrap
---
Yeah it seems to be since it's on gamepass. At least that's my theory as a PC and occasional xbox player.
---
You can always pay atomic points to complete it
---
The fireplace is nice. I‚Äôll probably redesign my camp to use it.
---
What is a food build??
---
How are the mega sloths as pets?
---
I've heard from PTS players that some of the LR rewards are available to purchase with Gold Bullion but I have no idea which items are or aren't.
---
The fun starts
---
This is in PS4 but I do have Xbox as well
---
This is what my tank power armor character does with a Vampire weapon.
---
If you're not already wearing power armor during
---
 ACP, you should. It has built in damage reduction on top of it's high DR.
---

---
google is your friend
---
Well that's mean.
---
Reading this sent me back to my first free range where I ran up to the last bramin to heal it and just.... Butchered the event...
---
No need for that they all come here to let us know.
---
I dunno,  probably thinks my voice is annoying.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Maybe I'll try that
---
I completed  or by eating a box cotton candy. The missions find only done
---
I do too. I've got some decent melee weapons stockpiled, but nothing big and war hammer enough for my preferences, though the instigating +40% power attack damage grognak axe comes close.
---
I want something that LOOKS like it will turn a scorched into a meatpile with one hit.
---
If only the flamers worked
---
Pretty sure it's only the practical ones. Not the cosmetics
---
Ammo converter, chicken coop, lunch box's are the ones off the top of my head
---
Lowbies means lower level characters, you dolt.  When I'm on a low level alt, I'm a lowbie.
---
thats nothing i have a B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/B/25 tesla shovel.
---
ur fucked
---
Lol yeah that guy was a dick
---
Big time
---
 https://imgur.com/gallery/WhNDdFo
---
I know it's not ideal but at least there is an option . Best of luck
---
Hard to imagine, especially in a game this silly lol
---
I do it so I can have 20 camps. I actually have 4 separate characters. I consider 2 to be my primaries and total of 4 primary and the rest are just fun camp building characters .. I have many camps, but two at Meat week and 2 at Fasnacht for instance and the rest spread over the map for fast travel points. I play 2 xboxes all the time, so always play 2 at the same time. I used to play just two, now I play 1 primary and 1 baby character and switch them with my other primary .. I got carried away lol
---
So you too enjoy Halloween candy enough to run rank 2 Thru Hiker?
---
I agree. The minimum penalty should be 10 seconds and the maximum 30.
---
I soloed Earle with my food build with no issues. Sounds like that guy just sucks at the game.
---
I most often see it when an enterprising low-level wanders into the Whitesprings Golf Club and meets its lvl62 ‚Äúresidents‚Äù!
---
It is nice but you're giving away a lot of damage for some protection. Which sounds reasonable at times but the reality is dead things don't do damage. So in a lot of situations the best defense is more offense. Even fully stacked with damage you'll still have plenty of slots that have no way to do damage at all. The cards just don't exist. So you may find it better to put damage where you can and then put defense where you can't put more damage. But that's just my perspective, there is no wrong way to play fallout. So try both and see what you like more.
---
All players I burn down are actually in the workshop and most carry a lot of scrap. I got 359 screws and 426 fiber optics from a guy I killed last night. If I claim a workshop, they will have a chance to clear out the extractors and not lose their scrap. You claim workshops are not very useful then why do you care about the pvp aspect. And since you're a role player, raiders exist in Fallout and now players are actually roleplaying that faction. Don't tell them how to roleplay.
---
Cool! Thank you for that head's up.
---
According to the wiki, they are cryptids, not ghouls.  I believe the only damage boost available is from one of the ‚ÄúTales from WV‚Äù magazines...
---
So, a really easy way to take care of the level up daily is to just make a new alt character. Those early levels go pretty fast. An event or two and you're there. Hell, you get a free level just for leaving the vault.
---
Gourmand should be a new legendary effect, the more I eat, the more powerful I become. Make way for Lord om nom nom.
---
But....it was a week?
---
I live right there and I kill a Yao guai everytime I spawn in/after a while. You make me doubt myself whether I've killed a ghoul or not, what level do they spawn at?.
---
I don‚Äôt known why players show up to events without heavies.  The same ones think they got robbed at the SBQ but really they never did enough damage.  I do a lot less against Earle with the same B gat plasma vs SBQ.  I also use sneak with B fixie on Earle.
---
Glow sight works on the wendigos??? I‚Äôd have to take off my tank killer though. And I probably need that for Earle...
---
Yep I tried on my junkies PA heavy build and it was a breeze. Yes all my guns are magic, but the full health is so much easier to stay alive with (obv)..
---
That's how I've always done bloodied. It can be the swiss army knife of builds if you let it.
---
I have been using junkies as my backup gun for when I bump my health up but I recently discovered how nice two shot plasma rifles are, so that's my backup now.
---
Oh god, yes. If season 2 comes out unchanged I don't think I'll bother with it. I started at level 330, I think. I'm now almost 570. Granted, I finished quite some time ago but in retrospect, I've got nothing to show for most of those level gains. I have way over 300 level ups banked but that's about it. :)
---
And then the empty bar showing your next reward that makes you wonder if you actually have finished it....
---
No I'm on ps4 unfortunately, only rewards I didn't get were the bag and the tenderizer
---
That used to happen to me a lot when the game first came out, then stopped mouths after.
---
Then Wastelanders came out and now I get it roughly 3 times a week.
---
I get it, the people who want to take things from other players don't like the idea of there being a way for people to not have their stuff taken.
---
This is now well-traded ground in this entire thread.
---
I tend to carry the things I can't lose anyway and leave all my junk at home. If you're going to be loaded down with 800 lb of stuff they might as well be 800 lb of aid and guns or whatever instead of the one thing you can lose which is junk.
---
So it sounds like the only people you've taken down are kind of dumb about the underlying mechanics of the world in which their character exists.
---
So I'll put away jump and take out an equal weight of something else because I can't lose anything else.
---
If you're going to be a pack rat you need to be a smart pack rat. 
---
sometimes I think other people are playing it completely different game. I mean I don't take workshops very often, but I haven't even had people taking potshots at me except for a couple times and the first few weeks.
---
Nexus. Just google FO76 and Nexus. I personally use the 'Fallout 76 Quick Configuration' for a mod loader.
---
Radtoad
---
Thanks for confirming that
---
Thought me one x was faulty never know with this game üòÜ lol thanks for reply
---
Yeah I have both but play on Xbox more. Ok just looked like same guys I played with last night. Thanks for the reply
---
I shell be there
---
I'll always revive other players.   
---
If I have even a single stimpak, you can bet your ass I got you.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I was worried about. Damnit. Got my hopes up that I could have an evil laugh. Bah.
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs fun to share when a random bloody build joins the team. Lol takes em a bit to realize what‚Äôs going on
---
That‚Äôs what i like to hear !
---
Lmao this made my day. I hate when bloodieds think their hot shit in general, but especially during this new event lol 
---
I run medic solar. I've yet to die or go down during this event.
---
Sometimes interacting with the holotape in the cave helps trigger it. Also chucking explosives into the waterfall area occasionally unsticks it.
---
Awesome. :)
---
Why not afk on the drums or spit?
---
Initially when I started playing I was going for a sniper and melee weapons build but now I‚Äôm going to try and make a heavy weapons, melee weapons, power armour build.
---
Why do you call that "food build"?
---
It‚Äôs a nice set piece tho
---
Yeah, same here.  I was playing at launch and really enjoying it.  But the constant hate really dampened my mood towards it.  But then I got hit with the PA bug.  Spent 1 hour clearing the silo, and had to get out of my PA to make those motherboards and the game locked...  Stopped playing.
---
Then Wastelanders came out and I have played every day since it's release.  Loving this game and the free stuff through the season.  Started really reading up on builds and such, then grinding out the gear I wanted.
---
I have improved my dude a lot.  But there is so much more to be done.  I love it!
---
Honestly, this would be a high-utility improvement towards enjoying the game. I'd even like to see a tab you could use to quickly select certain fast-travel spots like: "My C.A.M.P.," "My Tent," and perhaps even teammates' C.A.M.P.s and tents. It's pretty silly I need to click it on a map...especially when the map icons can get in the way. =
---
I am at work at the moment so it will be around 7 eastern time, that works.
---
That first one in FO4 was a great OH SHIT moment.. until you remember the game just gave you power armor and a minigun to knock it over with haha
---
I'm pretty sure that's just someone who watched Sandman do things, picked the term up, not realizing that it actually applies to himself just as much, if not more than other people.
---
It‚Äôs been how long? üò¥
---
I‚Äôm 4/4 in having great experiences with this event and recognize it‚Äôs not the same for some people.  Worried this morning I got bumped to a new instance with one other guy but we actually completed it with plenty of time to spare.  Maybe that won‚Äôt be possible after the pending damage nerf
---
Awesome! Where I should start I would like to develop some mod too
---
A 3\* Gourmand Rolling Pin.
---
50% plus Strength if well fed
---
50% less durability to armor due to bloat
---
AOE damage to enemies, gaseous clouds make them retch for 10% health per second.
---
:)
---
Yeah it would really make everything go much smoother and sooooo much faster!! I guess we can only dream huh :(
---
What is a food build? I've never heard of that.
---
I assumed it would boot me for inactivity still the taping my controller stick so that I run into a wall for hours is so I can leave to the store and come back, getting some stuff done while I was gone but in this case I was just tired and wanted to see if I could squeeze in a few more rewards while I sleep
---
And then they come and stand right in front of you as you're trying to heal the thing that is about to die :(
---
That‚Äôs actually perfect. It‚Äôs around the same time I get home.
---
What‚Äôs that?
---
Well food build is a stupid name for what it is.
---
Gotcha. I'll try this next time I'm in the cave, thanks
---
wanted to know how much harder it will be to kill stuff, as I am using an AAFFR .45 smg as my main stealth weapon, supplemented by and IE auto railway rifle and a QE laser(used when detected and cannot re-sneak)
---
It was added now. Open the scoreboard and claim rank 98 again.
---
would it be a good idea to pull out legacy lasers for daily ops then??
---
There is no such gun as a bloody quad
---
For an invisible suit?
---
I was there in the beginning......
---
As if grinding to 50 wasn‚Äôt bad enough. I mean it wasn‚Äôt but it did take me 2 years to reach that point.
---
I don't worry about what anyone else's build is. Whatever works for them doesn't bother me. I don't understand how a "fucking food build" would ruin his chances.
---
Is that rare? I managed to find the picnic table and the mirror ball plan. I just kept trading with him every time I ran the event buying all of the decor plans
---
A let down,just like the preorder bag. Are you surprised?
---
No problem! I hope you're able to get it! That cave has bugged out on me a bunch of times.
---
Psssst, don't tell anyone, but if you stand up while wearing it, you are no longer invisible.
---
They have one of the thickest health; i‚Äôd just find high ground if possible or run if you cannot kill in time
---
Nah, booted me off. Lol
---
I just want a build with big ass guns I don‚Äôt care about these bleeding builds or whatever.
---
I kill'em too fast to get the name! üòÜ

U don‚Äôt need to find codes. Nukacrypt.com gotchu. I kno it says find codes in the quest; but once you launch the nuke, it still completes the enclave quest anyways
---
There is a perk that allows you to use fire to heal allies?
---
&gt; I just have perks for what makes the game most fun for me, not optimized at all for best combat (other than sneak cause I love sneaking and sniping).
---
Same. I mostly play casually, so I just build for playing like that and avoid things that are too hard. When I do play with friends, I'll swap out some cards, but I'd really have to save up some perks to move cards around enough to actually be good at doing any of the higher level content.
---
Solitaire had this figured out 25 years ago.
---
Longtime bug.    Fortunately it‚Äôs never happened to me.
---
I think at least half of the stories people share here are either r/thathappened, or at least heavily exaggerated.
---
You can pick one perk per level like normal. You can now move 1 special point instead if you wish. Also now max level gear drops all the time so really you want to focus on legendary gear. Unyielding, bostered, bloodied, Junkies, Explosive legendary effects tend to be most popular.
---
Same, they most likely forgot about it. Pathetic
---
Yeah I noticed, thanks.
---
By nerfing higher damage builds, that is what they're doing.
---
three minute warning. this curry is nearly gone.
---
The way I understood what happened is because you don't pass through them, instead of just throwing you away, you were stuck and they hit you. 
---
But not being able to check the area because they logged it sounds more like what you said. 
---
So clipping and stacking them.
---
What a jerk.
---
It‚Äôs not Mr. Williams that kills me...it‚Äôs the other stuff in the room. üòÇ
---
Also sorry if my reply to you originally seemed harsh or anything like that. Wasn't my intent but I can see how it looked and read that way.
---
Wait! Missile silo holotape? What is this?
---
A what !? Is it new ??
---
Heck ya, it‚Äôs bullshit they have piercing gaze. So fight the bullshit with your own bullshit weapons
---
Ah, nice. I was originally gonna hop on eso, but then tried 76 during the free weekend after having been playing lots of fo4, so it was an easy sell
---
If you want to blow yourself up in close quarters.
---
Gotta get those screws, grind never ends
---
yeah that's why i said there are like 10 costumes that are worth to pay for. Elianora have a compendium with tons of clothes that looks mostly vanilla but I considered them just 1 mod. I used the mechanic jumpsuit with the 111 logo. 
---
But for example "Niero" has cool mods for weapons and armor and he is already working with the creation club.
---
Didn't see it this year, but i was there last year when the clock hit noon, watched everything disappear,  then Graham and Chally walked away. One of the saddest moment ever in a video game.
---
I play on third person on PS4. So from what you‚Äôre saying with pneumatic mod on my chest plate I‚Äôm mostly anti stagger except for Yao Guais?
---
Are you not able to enter at all? Does it actually have a limit less than the max number of people on server?
---
Hahahaha
---
We're all food builds now anyway
---
What are bloodied builds I hear people talk about those alot and wanting that effect on weapons?
---
Just heard It was added, probably yesterday
---
The guy with bloody build just a jerk. No one complain how you play except for cheat, exploit.
---
Nerfing every build.
---
I think it does prioritize your team. One of the instances I got was with my team and one other guy who eventually dropped out. We were all playing separately so it had to had done some sort prioritization when it realized all three of us headed for the event.
---
I‚Äôve seen one before but didn‚Äôt get this good of a look at it mostly just saw it‚Äôs name. It was during an event I think the scorched queen but wasn‚Äôt part of the fight and it just got decimated before I ever got to look at it
---
Bethesda doesn't like anything that doesn't = $$$. Adding new content, especially atom shop items, translates into real dollars earned. Quality-of-life improvements like these are hard to put a value on. That's why they're easy to de-prioritize. It's a pretty common perception in all project work, sadly.
---
I can hardly manage to maintain 2 separate character builds and you play multiple characters at the same time? I'm impressed honestly.
---
pvp in fo76? that's not really a thing. what are there like 7 of you?
---
Yeah, that's kinda ridiculous. Hopefully they get added in a future content drop; I'll even take it as a rare event reward.
---
Shoulda ended with something. Anticlimactic.
---
I'm not creative in this way, so I don't know what it could be, but there should have been some sort of celebration
---
I have my Vampire's flamer all set to go. I won't get chance to play the event until Saturday, but my plan is to set all the Wendigo's on fire to keep myself alive.
---
Eh. The joke of Deathclaw Island is that it‚Äôs in a noob region of the map. I went there as a lowbie thinking, ‚Äúhaha, they wouldn‚Äôt put a Deathclaw here, it‚Äôs probably a Scoobie Doo ghost or something... haha, see the island is totally empty! Oh hey, I wonder what that dark patch is all about??‚Äù And then I was torn asunder.
---
This is even more clear when one of the earliest noob branches of the Wastelanders main quest sends you there for a simple fetch quest.
---
I'll offer you a free non-legendary tenderizer in his stead then. It's what Graham would want. "We meat cook, we meat eat, we meat share."
---
Technically that's correct, but the amount that weaker builds are getting nerfed by is much much less than top tier builds.
---
Well, Bethesda have *finally* started doing the ‚Äòclean version in atom store/dirty version in game‚Äô that should‚Äôve been done from the beginning, so there‚Äôs a chance now at least.
---
Tri barrel two shot
---
Actually, believe it or not, PvPers comes in the thousands on all platforms. There was even more back in the early days of the game, before BGS listened to angry PvE players and nerfed PvP altogether.
---
I came across an irradiated one at site alpha yesterday.
---
Indeed, I‚Äôve finally found some fixers to replace my handmades, now I‚Äôve got 10k 5.56 to sell off
---
I have a question . in fo76 do u always get into the same server when logging into the game..
---
Are you in a group when you try? Me and my boy just had this problem. We tried it multiple times in different servers and it only ever spawned when we left the team and were alone.
---
I run a full health vanguard build. Love it.
---
It‚Äôs like 2 hours, right?
---
First night of Meat Week, I didn't know WTF the going on. Failed every primal cuts except one, couldn't find a cookout without server hopping. Soooo I quit on it LOL didn't play the rest of the week. I'm not salty though, I'm glad so many people enjoyed it. I'm trying to hold to boundaries regarding what I'm willing to tolerate from 76, a game I love but has frustrated me too much I think
---
Nice! Never seen one. 
---
I have over 200 levels and I just recently had my first encounter w a glowing mothman.
---
[Glowing Mothman](https://i.imgur.com/Uo6RLci.jpg)
---
Whats a food build lol
---
Congrats, you're at the part now where if you're hardcore you'll keep going until you're level 600 or you'll get bored by level 60 and start a new character
---
oh wait the second one is just me
---
I know that I have the backpack skin and I think that I have an extra Tato salad plan. I'm on PS4
---
Yep.  Event faded, Chally ran into the woods and the Dailies/SCORE went up in a plume of imaginary smoke. Graham wasn't even around for the last 2 sessions, he was up by the Vault 76 door.  On the bright side, without Dailies to grind, got the night off to mow grass I guess...pick up dead leaf piles, gather wood scraps from the yard, scoop some poop, and then mow the Greens
---
Yeah. I was planning on buying the rest of the levels I couldn't get because I was taking it casually. I figured buying 10 would be fine because the last 3 are covered by level 100 rewards and 7 more is easily covered by other ATOM rewards in the Legendary Run. But now I'm mad and there is no way I want to spend any real money on this to compensate for their bugs. The least they could do is award the points when they fuck up instead of just letting their bugs screw over your progress.
---
Nuke silo robots too :D
---
You will require a few more shots to kill things. That's about it. 
---
Daily ops won't let you sneak so might be hardish but just squad up or use the legacy.
---
No you'll still be staggered, just not as dramatically. 
---
So there's this weird thing about staggers depending on which camera view you use. If you're in 3rd, the stagger will interrupt your shooting. 
---
If you're in 1st person though, you can keep shooting through the stagger and hopefully kill them before they do another one. I'd try that if I were you.
---
The score system isn‚Äôt a grind
---
Vampire's has been my go to since the old TSE nerf, since i liked having more health
---
A failed joke
---
Of course man.  Hmu if you get on either one.  Message gt or psn if you'd like. Always need help with the events like colossus lol
---
I dont think these people remember what it's like to play as anything other than bloodied, when I swap back to my tank resistance armour I might be doing less damage but my vampires mini gun makes me invincible as long as I have bullets. Cant deal damage if you're dead
---
I admit it has taken a lot of time and does get confusing. I started when I was doing heists in GTA, you sort of adapt and can still get confusing which controller is which and which screen is which, but it has been super helpful, I borrow resources, junk, supplies, travel points. Especially with the over encumbered bug which I die and spawn at the vault, I just send other character to where I died, then spawn on her, it's been a life savior, else this game would have killed me by now. Have two camps with crops, so if one my crops gets destroyed, I jump to the other camp grab resources, or if one camp doesn't spawn in, I have a camp. I can't even begin to tell you the amount of uses a 2nd character brings to the table, countless .. but yes you do have to train yourself and eventually it becomes almost second nature .. so far it has been helpful in GTA, GOW4 and Fallout 76 ...
---
Try and make a build with this website and read all the perk card to learn what works best for you 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
It‚Äôs getting easier to get legendary weapons and armor, so my advice would be to focus on dmg perks within each s.p.e.c.i.a.l. category and try not to invest in to many weight reduction perk cards other then ‚ÄúTraveling pharmacy‚Äù in  strength, having the space to hold stim packs is helpful
---
Edit: I‚Äôd say you need at least 20 more lvls to begin a good set up
---
Damn I‚Äôm sorry.
---
Well said my son in laws a food build and he waits till everyone has done there damage . He can do the queen solo in under 12 secs if she lands got Vidio proof
---
Too much Nukashine today?
---
I was thinking of making a 2nd character cuz I‚Äôm doing the Wastelanders quests while siding with the Raiders and I did the stupid decision of giving Johnny 50% of the gold bullion while on his quest to recruit him
---
If there is a skin on it wont show up
---
Isn‚Äôt there a Spawn point pad available in the camp build options now? Thought I saw one the other day.
---
I've tried it both ways
---
I will def. my PlayStation account is only level 10 being I bought it from redbox when it was done with games for like 3 dollars. But my Xbox is 301 and had it since beta. I always try to find someone to take down earl. Got lucky and have fought him 4 times and finished it four times. Only once I didn‚Äôt get to loot body being I respawned as he died and just had to leave. But got my first cursed gun that day. But I‚Äôll hit you up
---
Idk but I saw someone wearing it, looks stupid, it's really ugly. Just sayin and that's my opinion, if you like it great but I won't be wearing, that's for sure.
---
It would be cool if it activated a quest where you go and ‚Äúpick up‚Äù your prize at the Hubris Comic Shop in Watoga. If an NPC in a captain cosmos outfit or even a robot gave you it, I still think it would be cool.
---
Does it have a paint on it?
---
If it had a skin on it from the atom shop.
---
Yup, there should be some fanfare and a server-wide announcement that you have reached 100.
---
The emperor's new paint.
---
The owlet plushie would be rare as fuck
---
props to the glowing wolf photobomb
---
What... What's a Food Build?
---
I never found Graham, I've just got four cuts of Prime Meat in my PipBoy
---
What is a Food Build?
---
Wendigo arnt ghouls.  So id say no.
---
This was fun shame that I dont have much time to play the game.
---
I was able to reclaim the suit on PC
---
Hello fellow medic. I typically have anywhere from 150-200 stims on me at any one time, 2 star Team Medic shared with my crew, and Dry Nurse. If you're on my team I'll keep you topped off on health. If you're not, [I'll res you when you're down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SUZxM5b0Ak) Got plenty to go around.
---
Whet even is a food build?
---
Well if they added a skin for wood armor then anything is possible
---
Good man.
---
This. 
---
Pretty much a mini-game itself.
---

---
As a fellow builder it's always nice to have folks appreciate one's efforts in making a camp.
---
Vampires Gauss Minigun +Limb Damage +Faster Reload
---
It's a bear &amp; it melts the spawn and hurts Earle bad.
---
I‚Äôm about to do something called, a pro gamer move.
---
Oh for sure. In the last day I've gone through about 8k 5mm and 16 or so plasma cores. Contextual ammo softened the loss of 5mm a bit but not getting anything back for those plasma cores but nuclear material HURTS lol. 
---
I just think people have gotten so used to one-shotting everything in the game that when they face anything with resistance to insta-gibbing they freak out. Never understood how erasing everything with such low effort could ever be fun and definitely think the nerfs coming up are a great step towards actual balance. 
---
When a builds power can single-handedly fuck up the fun for other players either by deleting legendaries before anyone else can touch them or by eliminating any difficulty a boss might've had due to INSANE damage numbers that means it needs a serious rework.
---
If you're on ps4 and you missed some common rewards let me know, i can give you them for free
---
Same. Did the event about 20 times. Didn't see it during last years meat week either.  Been playing since beta and have only found it on Graham twice. Have only found the star burst clock once.
---
Yup. Got downed right after Earl was killed, and stuck in the 60 second respawn screen. Event finished, I loaded outside in the Radiation, and got zero rewards.
---
Wendigos are cryptids
---
Apparently triggering Scorched Earth can occasionally trigger Colossal Problem as well. People have observed it before, yes.
---
Damn. Thanks for the insight.  I just planned to start with the healing shiskebab and never would have thought about the silo's.  Run them a lot and this is brillant.  TY
---
GATLING GUN, I've done west tek a fair amount of times and never seen one there.
---
I just grabbed a Vamp/ss/+1End
---
I didn't know I played the last one until the next hour came around and I didn't see a notification:( I was really hoping to get the tenderizer plan
---
I just started the Wastelanders quest.  It's weird, but satisfying, to have human NPCs in the game again.  I just wish the player character had a voice like they did in Fo4.
---
Charisma Perk - Friendly Fire - 1-3\*, Teammates hit by your flame weapon regen health (no molotov)

I love getting camp appreciation messages

Shhh

Will do; looks like explosions are back on the menu, boys
---
Sound like you hit the jackpot on the pull of the slot machine
---
Did a hoard a couple weeks ago, first wave was all the ghoul variety...
---
^what they all said...
---
FO76 is easily in my top 5 games I've ever played. I have 300+ hours in and the only other game that has ever captured my interested was WoW. 
---
I left for a few months and recently came back. Don't know why I ever left. All I can think about all day at work now is getting home and playing Fallout.
---
What platform?
---
They work, but you need to use the bash not the flamer.  Flame does not heal, the bash will.
---
Yess ! Love when people do that. If i see someone down i always revive them, even if i have 1 stimpak left.
---
I call those respec points. Lol. Whenever I get a better drop, time to move all the points around.
---
I had no idea, thanks.
---
Xbox
---
It was like the fourth one I rolled.....I'm very happy.
---
Thank you for the headsup!
---
Yes and now you gotta work to make life easier for your character. 
---
Eventualy you will even have bought enough perk card to switch between builds (Exemple: Heavy machine gun build to a shotgun build ) . We are even waiting for a build loadout system so we can quickly change of build on the fly to suit a lil more the situation and needs for the team.
---
But for now you have alot to do. You gotta polish/optimise your "main" build to make sure you have enough dps to deal with the high lvl enemies. 
---
Now that you are lvl 50, until you it about lvl 80, enemies will also start spawning at a higher lvl too. So you better make sure you can deal with them. Otherwise you will have some trouble to play high lvl content.
---
That's your main objective for now. Also make sure that your camp is well built too. Make it fits your needs ! ‚úå
---
I wouldn't say I'm a "builder" in this game, I just wanted my camp to look nice, so I built a Blue Ridge Caravan Nuclear Waste Disposal Site.
---
Yeah right, thats the same thing the crazy guy with the flame thrower said in my town before the police got him.
---
What in the fuck is this? I hadn't seen a behemoth till the primal cuts events too.
---
Wouldn't that be double the budget cost
---
Well I mean, it's called *Deathclaw* Island, not *Deathclaws* Island
---
Our Earle disappeared. That was cool.
---
Oh found her again last night and she had corn and stuff ugh I have no luck with her. Then found her again same server and had chems. So annoying
---
You were probably the 9th person
---
FIRST comment I see. I‚Äôm done here. I can‚Äôt process anything right now
---
Yes. In the Charisma perk chain. Allows you to heal team members with flame weapons, but also works on NPC's
---
Food builds? Never heard of it. üòÇ

 September 7 ‚Äì 10 Deliver 250,000,000 Glass Meat Week, A Second Helping (September 22 ‚Äì 28)

Chally got sick of not eating meat. Chally eat meat, Chally eat meat week
---
Wait, meat week is done?   Well crap. Im sitting on 34 prime cuts because the cookoff wouldnt spawn when i was on....   boo!
---
Bloodied is a effect for weapons were the lower your health, the higher your damage. Using perks like nerd rage to increase your damage and serendipity so when you take damage, there's a chance you just don't take any.
---
Put on some other perks like bloodied mess and so on and you have a character that is op and one shots most things.
---
It does. It only removes ballistic. I used awareness to test.
---
Spot on! ;)
---
I‚Äôve got a tenderiser if you want one
---
This weapons wouldn't do jack shit without the magic damage bug though, god knows how many rounds he'd take from a minigun without the bug,  10k? Probably closer to 20k tbh
---
Listen, at the end of the day, those bloodied builds need us food builds to be the support they need. I find it relaxing to wander around and scavenge. It's strangely cathartic. And then I get back to my camp and sell ammo and aid items at reasonable prices (and plans and mods) for those bloodied builds to come drop their caps on. We're a symbiotic ecosystem. They sell their legendaries that they pick up while farming and I buy what's worthwhile to me with the caps they gave me for stimpacks and chems (those junkie builds love their chems and home brewed alcohol).
---
I've seen a few at Dolly Sods, over the last few months.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/WAWl86u
---
My pride and joy.
---
Lmao me too
---
The emote is actually really great if you time it right on when the rocks clear in Earles mine I felt like Gandalf lol
---
Are you suggesting you don‚Äôt LOVE hearing from the MAYYYYYOORRRRRR of GRRRRRRRAFFTONNNNN!!!!?!?
---
Never happened to me before
---
I bitched about the prize at the end being just another skin (and got downvoted?) but man that was a let down. You spend hours every day grinding and it‚Äôs like  ‚Äúohhh wow you did it, have a slightly different color PA skin than the one you got earlier‚Äù.
---
I haven‚Äôt logged in since
---
That.....makes perfect sense for Bethesda but does not fit any definition of "working" that I am familiar with beyond "It just works"
---
You basically just suggested he pay $100 for a PA skin... Yeah not ideal indeed
---
Yeah, they didn't though.  They kept killing themselves by running at Earle.
---
Thank for the tag! We will raise this during our next meeting.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, but it is apart of the one wasteland update. They‚Äôve said previously one wasteland was going to come with other changes to make sure the lvl‚Äôd enemy system makes sense with the current combat.
---
Because they fixed the missing helmet.
---
However they didn't seems to make this fix clear or announce it needs to be reclaimed anywhere.
---
Figured they should notify people better for these things.
---
Wonder if when the season ends will it auto claim or be lost if someone doesn't reclaim it?
---
It was fun as hell but I got all the rewards.
---
Side Note: My dumbass spent Atom buying the Chally "Clean" outfit, not knowing there was a free dirty version that drops during the event.

---
 &gt; Thank for the tag! We will raise this during our next meeting.
---
I actually got that today from him
---
Oh so that‚Äôs why I could reclaim it. I already made the suit for me and my ally so was confused why I could reclaim it again. That‚Äôs cool because I was looking for a space helmet at the Crater and couldn‚Äôt find any.
---
And on the 7th Day Grahm rested and all was good!
---
It's not mentioned because it's largely understandable that they had to go. Too much strain to force positioning scripts for every single player vs AI in a game like this. It would also break the flow of gameplay in mob fights with multiple players. Simpler stuff already drains server stability so most people don't even dare to ask them back.
---
To elaborate on Tamashi's point though, a speed, health and/or dmg buff is all that's needed to make them fearsome again.
---
Thanks :D
---
You said you heard the train whistle, which means they were reloading. Prob hit you more than once, that thing can fire pretty fast.  All I know is the dmg is capped, and it's 110, not 100.
---
This comment is highly underrated
---
It‚Äôs coming back in a month
---
Just read any of the other posts explaining what a food build is. 
---
Food builds aren‚Äôt players that eat food for buffs lol. That‚Äôs just apart of basic gameplay for any build. It‚Äôs someone that hasn‚Äôt leaned into another build. They‚Äôre called food builds because they‚Äôre built with survival in mind rather than being proficient in combat.
---
Have you helped the Miss Nanny up at Wavy Willard's?
---
Yeah, same answer as everyone else, but I'm adding that I use skins to prevent me accidentally selling or scripping Legendary items I want to keep.
---
Not sure I've heard of tri or quad shot weapons.  I'd recommend teaching a friend and experimenting with PVP dmg, the rules for it seem to change and i have a lot of questions, myself.
---
You dirty bastard lol
---
There's a chest near the end of the tunnel, i think that's some minor incentive to escape- but the screws are worth more haha
---
I'm hoping we get shadowed.
---
But a buddy of yours can launch right?
---
Thanks! I may reach out and take you up on this within the next week. üòä
---
Stay safe fellow wanderer
---
Send some of your storms over to us in CA. I had fires raging on all sides of my house. We could do with a good flood.
---
But in all seriousness good luck. Stay safe out there
---
I bought a plan - maybe not the right one.  Thanks for the info.
---
Awesome just add me on 76 it‚Äôs my just my reddit user
---
There are other people commenting the same as me.
---
But, food build is often used as an insult towards casual players. But people who use it unironically are the ones who lack game knowledge, as optimized food builds are the ones that can 3-shot the sbq.
---
Here is an example of an optimized food build:
---
https://youtu.be/0OeCjnFYxLs
---
EDIT: Made my response sound less passive aggressive.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I have a spare backpack plan. I‚Äôll just give it to ya. But if you wanna throw me some caps I won‚Äôt complain. Or maybe you have a rare camp plan? I still haven‚Äôt got the disco ball on that character
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. 
---
It‚Äôs happened to me before, than a few days later, it goes back. I really hope it goes back, because I‚Äôll never be able to get double walls again. 
---
I really hope they come out with interior walls soon!
---
This sub is for people that stayed. Regardless of if you have good taste or not, i wasted 70 bucks and you have a great time. 
---
Good luck...
---
I'm really hoping they don't.. the SS armor is already disgustingly overpowered in every single stat, repair cost, jetpack and if they gave it shadowed then nobody has a reason to run any other armor in the entire game. Secret Service gear has already destroyed the equipment balance of the entire game; it's bad enough that people want it to have everything. I'm never going after SS simply due to the fact of how broken and unbalanced the entire set is; screw meta.
---
Funny part is food builds are the most powerful in the game right now and always have been lol
---
&gt; The playerbase in this game is one of the best but lately there's been a huge influx of weirdos. No idea if this is because of the Gamepass thing but I've run into a lot more weirdos and asshole then usual.
---
I'm level 47 and started playing about a month ago after buying 76 at launch. I wouldn't blame the low levels per say, I've definitely found my share of level 150+ assholes who are not only unhelpful, but trolly. I've also found extremely toxic low levels as well, I just account it to Fallout being a single-player series where your character is literally "god". They come into 76 with that same mindset and it just doesn't fit at all.
---
Really? Which ones ? I haven‚Äôt seen a single glowing enemy not have glowing in their name. 
---
The only exception apparently are the wendigos that spawn in the new event. 
---
Although they are glowing black and green they aren‚Äôt considered glowing. And they don‚Äôt have glowing in their name. So the perk card is useless against them.
---
Been ambushed a handful of times by one of these beauties sad that they're not my friends lol
---
Yes it does like for example my friend also has a One X just no ssd and I can literally wait for him to fast travel somewhere and once he shows up on the map but is still loading I can click on his name and fast travel to him and still load in before him.
---
this is the camp ally not trader =0
---
I'd pay like the 5-6k caps I have on my main right now, should be rewarded for it at least lol. My psn is TheFerroFresh if you want to add me and I'll get on later and message you
---
Really? I assumed the person who launched it always got in. How many people are allowed into the event?
---
Radroach that's 3 times the size of the SBQ
---
Lol oh god my bad
---
2 tenderizer plans
---
2 peppered plans
---
1 salty plan
---
3 spicy plans
---
5 backpack plans 
---
1 Tato salad recipe
---
Infinite chally outfits 
---
Infinite chefs hats
---
Not a bad hall overall this event, could have been worse could have been better. At least my main and my alt have tenderizer plans learned in and I bought the missing salty recipe and tato recipe.
---
I just hide my weapons when running about.
---
I can believe this though. I run with two food builds. Anytime we plan anything, they have to take some time to go hunting, cook and prep whatever it is they use, and away we go. I‚Äôve experienced folks we normally play with bitch about how long it takes them to get prepped. Food builds were also the butt of all jokes to the bloodied pvpers during the survival server days.
---
"Bleeding builds" that is actually genius. I'm stealing this even though you probably didn't meant it. 
---
They're called bloodied builds because they take advantage of the bloodied legendary weapon prefix. They also get buffs from unyielding armour that increases all SPECIAL when at low health.
---
Good point, I wonder if you can land a Lvl 5 shovel if you go straight from 76 to the event with a hazmat suit? ü§î
---
Sounds like instead of thinking for yourself, you let the community dictate how you felt about the game. The world has always been full of amazing content.
---
Sure, bugs and frustrations got in the way of fully enjoying the game, but BGS has done a good job with the world and exploration aspect of the game since day 1.
---
You would be better off moving those rifle perks into agil/luck and using a heavy gun instead of a rifle. Then you can swap out to heavy gun perks when you wanna blast fools.
---
Is that a solution or a work around?
---
Just get rid of healing factor until they fix it
---
Good to know thanks!
---
If you only bought the plan for SS Under armor - Shielded Lining or something like that, then you bought the mod. You need the one that is just SS Under armor first, then you can make that one and put the lining mod on it.
---
It has happened to multiple people here because the descriptions and interface with Regs could be better.
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh interesting ! I‚Äôll try hitting with first person view next time . Thanks!
---
Well that‚Äôs good to know, I probably would never look at the board again
---
Saaame. I was playing the drums when they fell from underneath me and I was just standing there, full of sadness.
---
I consider a good build that random dude in the corner strung out in chems and food buffs with a bffr fixer one tapping things
---
The prevailing theory on how to avoid it is to be logged off when the dailies refresh at 12pm ET. Give yourself a ten or fifteen minute window before and after the refresh and just stay logged out during that time. Seems to work, but it's apparently a difficult bug to reproduce on demand, so YMMV.
---
&gt;Earle is awesome, the event is awesome. I just feel like bethesda used this event as a mega band aid for all the other problems.
---
Everything you say here is 100 percent correct.  I want to make clear, the purpose of this post was not to gloss over the myriad of problems still in this game.  By no means.   People who look at my post history have accused me of being a chronic complainer, and there is truth to that lol.  My posts are critical more often than not. But  I had fun with the event and figured I'd post something positive for a change.
---
You are right it's a band aid, but I feel like it is one of the better band aids.   I thought the mole miner pail event, the extra week of  Fasnacht were band aids.  I am enjoying the Colossal Problem band aid a lot more.  Faint praise, yes, but it's about the best I can manage.
---
I agree the repair cost is ridiculous, it needs to be the most expensive to repair. But then it should also be the ultimate endgame armor so if it is missing a mod essential for a build that majority of people use, it wouldn't really be the endgame armor. Which was it's point, to replace all the duped armors and be the peak the playerbase grinds for.
---
Nice, good deal. Mines the same as my username. I won‚Äôt be on until after 8 eastern time
---
Fort defiance and the prison where the mad dog event is
---
I‚Äôve seen miniguns in west tek but never a Gatling gun
---
The game itself is tons of fun, but there‚Äôs definitely some quality of life improvements Bethesda needs to make. I just wish they‚Äôd hold off on creating new content even for a few months just to focus on fixing the issues that have been around forever
---
Alright cool same probably closer to 9
---
There are friendlies in there? I've only done it twice and everything was hostile and just kept coming.
---
I've seen 'em there a few times, but not until after I put in 1000+ hours
---
*stops to reexamine life*
---
I finished it last night and that was my same feeling around it. Even if it gave something like the completion of an event with a vault boy drawing and a congratulations would've made it more satisfying. 
---
Certainly better than absolutely nothing.
---
How much of a vacation do we get anyways?
---
I keep a magazine rack in my bathroom, and use it as a gauge to C.A.M.P. Space. The day before I had 5 magazines. When I went to change the curtain, I ended up taking a poster down, then all 5 magazines out, as well as the magazine rack, with no ability to place it. I can‚Äôt even put the old curtain back!
---
Whatever they did is bad. Thanks to this update, I won‚Äôt be buying anything C.A.M.P. Related until this is fixed...
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before, and it‚Äôs fixed itself a few days later, I hope that‚Äôs all it is now...
---
I guess all 4 of my characters are essentially food builds then. ü§î
---
I think vamp/ss/90rw is the god tier for the weapon.
---
Be safe and good luck!!
---
Yeah, it really is sad watching it all disappear.
---
Was somebody using a Tesla rifle nearby?
---
I don't have healing factor, but how would that help anyway?
---
I think actual mutations rather than enhancements make sense. Cybernetics don‚Äôt make sense in a thing that is supposed to mutate enemies. For humans I would imagine something like Eagle Eyes, where stealth is less effective and they are prone to aiming for the head for maximum damage. Bat ears makes stealth completely ineffective. Bear arms make humans with melee weapons do 3x the amount of damage. Etc.
---
Wtf
---
Out of curiosity, what perks do you use with that gun? I ask because I'm a casual sneak/sniper type, but found an anti-armor explosive handmade that I'd like to play around with.
---
I see you guys  on the news so sad
---
Bows are fun and do good damage, great everywhere but bosses. The only difference between my sneak rifle vats and a bow build is the damage cards so I swap out for fun often.
---
The only issues and why I don't play bow more is vats is broken, they have replied on reddit posts that the vats issues are being worked on but are complex.
---
Those issues mostly boil down to missing shots we shouldn't miss and this problem seems worse with 1 shot weapons like my lever action and its even worse with my bow. So free aiming works but I like vats I'm lazy.
---
Currently playing my build as a commando and vats misses are way less.
---
heavy guns animations in general look goofy if you're not wearing PA.
---
and even in PA, the running (not sprinting) animation is just awful.
---
This was my first time on the event missed it the last few times. Did get the butcher hat and apron and 1 moo moo mask, no bottoms. I'll dig around if anyone sells on the vend. Pretty fun event.
---
Wait what‚Äôs a food build
---
Yeah, I could enjoy it in a case like that! Good for you to ask and offer other ways to fight, too. I did have a person once come to my workshop and ask to fight, but wouldn't actually *take* the workshop, they just wanted to enjoy a pvp match. That was pretty cool and refreshing xD
---
5 runs and I have gotten the pile,rug,cursed shovel and 2 pick axes.
---
I couldn't find my way out the first time and got the reward even though I couldn't find the exit.
---
Yep - have a B1050 mini. Didn‚Äôt do anything. Churning away for 18 dmg per shot.
---
Specifically, the 3rd Floor of Defiance is where you'll find the rare ones.
---
Quick health regen from it bugs fast travel. Do you have any health regen armor or food? I've found even stimpaks can cause it.
---
You get the rewards, you just get teleported to the entrance.
---
It just teleports you out, and you get event rewards. I've  been staying inside for the screws and acid
---
I think we're getting a second helping of it in a while, keep an eye out for it.
---
This happened to me too...it said there were 6 people and when I joined I got a second instance with 3 of us...has to be a bug? 
---
The other two glitched after dying and I had to solo him.
---
Took me 3 tries and 4 repair kits with him healing over and over...
---
I died 3 times because I refuse to leave without looting all the 5.56 off the wendigos. it just puts me outside the mine.
---
got the mask and a couple cursed weapons from the rewards screen. don't know about plans but I'm assuming it's the same.
---
HOLY FUCK!  Im getting this
---
You die, and it respawns you outside of the mine. Just stay within the event zone at the mine until it finishes, and you can still get the event rewards
---
Edit: you **don't** lose your junk.
---
Reading this gave me catharsis. Thank you for sharing
---
*I see what you did there...*
---
Not trying to argue, but genuinely - how did the challenges have that much impact on your playstyle? Pretty much everything would be done naturally in the course of a day's/week's playthrough.
---
Kill 10 Scorched - they're everywhere
---
Kill 10 Mole Miners - Uranium Fever happens constantly
---
Eat Bubblegum/Pre-War Food - if you don't have any on you, they're everywhere, even in those level-up perk-packs.
---
Level Up - just play
---
Buy/Sell from other players - everyone is always looking for a good bargain
---
Repair / Scrap Weapons and Armor - happens naturally
---
Kill 10 robots - stop at Watoga train station after a SBQ evet, take out a few constituents
---
The only one I can see being out of someone's playstyle would be to claim a workshop and of course the Nuclear Winter stuff. Even missing those on a daily basis can be made up of the weekly exp repeatable.
---
Never heard of a "Food Build" before but more diversity is always good. If everyone is the same everyone has the same weaknesses and that is a recipe for disaster.
---
tis ok.  nswer doesn't change much - IDK about the other types.
---
There should be some charts on (multiple) web site showing the statistics, benefits/drawbacks of the other types.
---
I do the same thing too. Just wish I had a skin for the LMG.
---
The only benefit of exiting is the loot room with mediocre junk before the exit. I think it's better to keep killing and looting spawns and then making sure to switch in to something rad resist. If you stay it just teleports you out, unlike load bearing.
---
Yep, get that a lot.
---
No health Regen armor, and the only food I have is canned dog food and purified water
---
I never understood what to do. I had a lot of prime meat from the Prime Cuts event but it just spoiled.
---
I will never understand why some things get downvoted, unless it is clear cut rudeness or gross misinformation. Opinion on a PA skin is good feedback.
---
Played the event with friends last night... I dont know if its the minions or meat piles or what but the frames got so bad and it got so laggy for all of us we were dead before we knew how we died and at many points we all pixilated looked like an 8bit game.
---
We have done the event about 6 times and its happened 3 of them.
---
We have 1-2 who mop up the minions so as not to have many in play at once and they are not a problem but they should atleast limit how many are spawned at once because one 2 runs we hit hard and we had a sea of windegos it was insane.
---
It's definitely grindable even at this stage with xp buffs and lunch boxes. As others are saying, you can buy your way through with Atoms (150 atoms per level) or no-life as much as you can the 10k xp/100 score challenge.
---
The latter is definitely doable even this late in the run.
---
First floor has or had a spawn in the laundry room after you unlock the secure door.
---
I really like this idea.
---
Haha yeah when I started using power armor I had to change to first person because it looks so bad. Like a contest to see how high your knees can go while you run.
---
I fully understand the fun of one shotting, as long as its not at the expense of others not having fun.
---
And not saying you are, but there are plenty of players taking their fun at the expense of others, especially at events.
---
The forest will always be prime for oneshotting everything, even post recalc im guessing.
---
And you gotta remember there is currently a HUGE damage disparity between builds, we have people complaining Earle is a bullet sponge, and 3 man teams burning him in under a minute.
---
Hopefully the damage recalc evens that out a bit, and sets BGS up with good building blocks to make some of the other builds and playstyles more viable.
---
Cuz dayum I really wish my pistol build was more viable.
---
Possibly. Is the healing capped or % or what? I could see a bloody one-shot full-healing if it‚Äôs % based.
---
I think the "extra week" is the event coming back again next month.
---
I agree, it's getting ridiculous.   These min maxers really irritate  my with their talk of "food builds."    I am a heavy gunner  with all the heavy gunner perks, bloody mess, tenderizer, adrenaline, dodgy, one gun army etc.     Lots of damage/ combat perks.  Min maxer would call me a "food build." because I sink a very minimum amount of points into carry weight perks for ammo and weapons. 
---
The person you described sounds like  typical  min maxer. People like him don't seem to realize that when you dedicate 110 percent of  your  build to damage output, then damage output is all you get. 
---
Which is why he kept dropping dead.
---
Agree. You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel, just use it. A vault boy that pops up from the bottom of the screen and gives me a thumbs up would have be acceptable.
---
the animation is kind of already there.  Reminds me of the sword from that "there can be only one..." movie / TV series.
---
Goes over your shoulder, then poof, dissappears.
---
Not terribly difficult.  Here's an thread about all the things to do:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/
---
Demolitions expert as much rifleman and snipers you can as well as fire proof because the explosions will kill you if you do not have it
---
‚ÄúWho not gonna eat the meat... C h a l l y... ‚Äú
---
it was really good this year with a good community spirit. One cook off was completed in about 20 secs!! Couldn‚Äôt believe it! üëçüèº
---
Sad to see it end..again
---
I thought meat week was supposed to last 2 weeks this time?
---
This was my first meat week and I have to agree, after doing Primal Cuts a few times I just gave up on them all together and only did Grahm's cookout.
---
Why not balance DR and Health of mobs and bosses across the board? Instead of bringing damage on everything up and factoring in possible changes to perk cards, etc. maybe bring enemy health and resistances down. I've always thought that if an enemy is eating bullets then the issue isn't necessarily the damage number output as much as what the enemies are able to absorb.
---
Seeing my AAFFR Gatling Plasma doing 100+ damage per shot after perks but still not damaging Ghouls and Super Mutants like I feel that it should always came across as the enemies themselves being too tough vs. the weapons being weak. Maybe just two different lenses of the same base problem but I guess if I had a choice over which coat of paint was used to solve the same problem I'd prefer damage numbers to not look insanely high. I don't want a pistol doing 120 damage per shot; I want 80 damage per shot to be worth way more than it is currently if that makes sense.
---
It‚Äôs 8 people per instance. But apparently the instances can break and put you in a solo instance instead of an instance with other people
---
Ok, you got me there. Lol.
---
huh, i had no idea food builds were a thing. interesting.
---
I knew exactly what I was getting myself into and I thank you for this piece of absolute gold.
---
Hmmm. You should send me his gt, so I can ask him if they were legit...
---
Hell no. That would be exploited so fast
---
That was making me scratch my head. The next time I quit the game and reopened it, it finally displayed correctly.
---
Yeah you speak the truetrue. I hate how i sound saying that, but playing a bloodied build right is a sleight of hand. Sure its about gear, but also very much about how to play it in its diffrent variations.
---
Stealth commando, rifleman, melee or heavy. They're all exeptional regarding damage output, but they all have diffrent requirements in how to survive with them under heavy load. Something thats gonna be even more important to "know how to" after the one wasteland patch.
---
You are not guaranteed a spot, you‚Äôre either getting there faster than everyone else and/or you‚Äôre not getting broken instances
---
I've found if you do go bloodied you have to stay stelthed. If you get scared or need to run from a danger you die if you cant stelth again
---
Ya, Ima find me a magic weapon or dust off my AAE Gatling Plasma and give that a try next.
---
I kept all the fireworks at the end, and threw a party at my last Meat Week lol
---
Yeah I tried thatüòä. No responce
---
I sometimes get confused with week math as well but yes it was. It started last Thursday at noon and it ended today at noon. Thursday-Wednesday is indeed 7 days
---
Anyone can nuke the mine to spawn the event
---
i have the marsupial mutation.... i barely get hurt lmao
---
Its bugged.  First nuke hit the mine for earl.   2nd and 3rd nuke no matter where it hits it‚Äôs triggering ACP event again.  
---
Its pretty neat.   Nuke earl, kill earl.   Nuke SBQ, kill SBQ, kill earl.   Rinse and repeat.
---
Now it only needs a level floor and stable frames lol
---
Best solution. 11 out of 10
---
Would be nice if it didn't (disappear).
---
I mean I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll happen again so I can record it then
---
nice pic! that is honestly a one in a million pic, not just the costumes but the rad storm going on as well.
---
It does - but it's never a rare one.
---
Brought my vampires LMG but it hardly scratched anything there. Good every now and then to save on stims I guess.
---
Just went there and it‚Äôs gone.  Sad.
---
Im a fan of VE over vffr for auto rifles and 10mms. The explosion triggers a second heal so it double dips.
---
My question is, is it even worth nuking the SBQ anymore? I have infinitely more fun fighting Earle than I do the queen, plus I recover ammo from the wendigos. Is there an advantage to the SBQ that i'm not thinking of?
---
The fact that I didn't see anyone complain was strange because the first time around it was the event you didn't want to miss. I feel bad for ppl that experienced this event as their first experience. Same I just logged in 5mins before the hour to try and get the rewards.
---
Should do two runs. One the "correct" way and then another the 5 minute way ;)
---
Solution or work around for what?
---
It‚Äôs open ti multiple groups of 8 people. But you can be thrown into a solo instance for some reason
---
I miss being a high health tank but screaming at people will get you nowhere fast.
---
Yeah, I had some that ended in literally 10 seconds. It helps when you have all six spits/drums in use in the 2 minute count down.  Then people just blasted through the rest of the actions.
---
The bashing damage makes it a "magic" shotgun if you put the flechette mod on it. It will one shot most mobs using vats.  Doesn't work outside of vats and still slow as heck.  Angry Turtle has a good video of the three cursed weapons and they're actually halfway decent.
---
Most comments are saying what I‚Äôm trying to convey, with a sprinkle of people commenting they thought food build just means to eat food. 
---
Angry Turtle and a couple youtubers created a build they called the food build a year ago, but that no longer exists and wasn‚Äôt considered a build type. It‚Äôd be like someone making a loadout called ‚ÄúMikey‚Äôs meat Farm‚Äù and us saying that‚Äôs a build. Using a loadout and having a build are 2 different things. Food build just means survivability, which as I had said, is usually used as an insult, as it doesn‚Äôt have a way at competing in combat with optimized builds in its purist form.
---
google food build:

[7 survival builds](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/builds-best-characters?amp)
---
All you get are posts about survivability or purely QoL perks. No one mentions food builds being an optimized build type, definitely not recently. It just means survival, or un-optimized when used to insult.
---
Well, I assume you say this as a way of communicating that there's no need to change anything, and we should comfort ourselves by sheathing the weapon into thin air.
---
I think we get a second week from one of the Atlas challenges, but not sure when.
---
I used the flamer two weeks ago. They do work to heal other players. I‚Äôm assuming it just doesn‚Äôt work on npcs
---
I'll definitely take it!  I was struggling to grab ammo!
---
They didn't trigger at that exact time the nuke dropped, it was a few mins after. but I can see how they're linked.
---
go up in lift to third floor. the room opposite on the bed you can see can be a spawn.  Then the other dorm room and the shower. That's it. don't bother picking up white or dirty. if you do nothing will spawn there until you have picked up x amount of items (general consensus is 180 items but it's not. it's 255 or more). the hats aren't rare. 
---
here is a price guide based on my 150+ hours looking for a red one and selling the spares i found
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 5k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - trade only. Like 150k+
---
It should have ended tomorrow, but the schedule has always been today.
---
Only way is super gifts I always sell any PA plans for 50 caps max
---
I launched the nuke and waiting until the event popped up. As soon as it started I joined it. I was the only one in my instance. The test if my team was in another instance with 5 other high level people. So no I wasn‚Äôt distracted, but even if I was distracted you should be guaranteed a slot in the first instance because it‚Äôs always the fullest instance.
---
This will be my second one this year, this is where the fun begins
---
Grahm confirmed on many occasions the name of the event was based on it sounding better than 'Meat Many Days'. No idea why this is troubling so many people.
---
Good question. Honestly I had given up on the queen before colossal problem dropped though.  The main reason I don't bother with the queen anymore is because Bethesda disabled he ability to cripple her and force her to land. That really sucked all the fun out of the event for me.
---
while they are not ghouls, I can tell you a L50 Ghoul Slayers switchblade takes them out with fewer hits than a L50 Vampire switchblade.
---
As a casual bloodied, I would love it if Vangaurd worked like that. It would mean a little more build variety at the very least.
---
I thank you for understanding. and I thank you more being able to understand my werid-ass paragraph "Forgive my language" I edited now though.
---
Lowbies/ everyone can join that one. More people. I like sbq still! Also FLUX
---
Bloodied powerfister here. 
---
With all my buffs and junk I can slam 2k damage into something, but a stiff breeze will melt me.
---
Interesting, whereabouts you from, because anal-retentive is still in common usage here in the UK and dependent on context what most people would understand when reading that a person was 'anal'.
---
I feel like when you escape you don't get the extra mystery pick reward. I might be wrong though. So it depends where your priorities are. If you need screws it's definitely better to stay and loot.
---
Thanks that‚Äôs good to know, I love harpoons, the firing and reloading sound is so satisfying
---
Isn't it over?
---
Good luck to you and yours. Stay safe guys
---
You do still get the mystery pick, can definitely confirm that
---
I love grinding, you're not alone.
---
Yeah magic weapons seem to work well, I tried a VE plas with not much luck on my alt 
---
I was using BE and BFFR fixers, the BE actually worked better since earl doesn‚Äôt seem to have explosive resistance like the queen does. Having fireworks is key üòè
---
8 people per instance. So lets say there are 16 people who join the event. You‚Äôll only see 7 other people because the cap per instance is 8. Meaning there are 2 events going on. At least, thats how it‚Äôs supposed to work
---
Sad but true unfortunately, it‚Äôs in all the YouTube videos about the event
---
if you keep holding your reload button, the weapon gets holstered.
---
Neither,  just fast travel out. Hehe üòà
---
Love EACH cryptid as a boss. Id LOVE an event where you nuke an alien ship and fight a Flatwoods monster horde.
---
Now I can sell everything at greatly inflated prices!
---
It would be nice to actually see the holster.
---
Yeah thats why i dont use them. Looks goofy.
---
NPCs comment about the grease coming out of your pores.
---
True.
---
I'm guessing the intent is to lower the processor demands for animation down when in 3rd person ?
---
I don't feel so good moo moo.
---
I don't datamine, but I don't think so. But it is a perk I always keep "on".
---
I use V E Flamer and it's bliss. Deals crazy damage and you can't die unless you get caught in your own explosions (or the falling debris)
---
Ive done the event a good 35 times now, and even dying in a good 20 of the runs. I haven't ran into any Respawn bugs, and Earle only fucked off and fell through the floor once. But was able to fix it and come back a few minutes later where he was promptly murdered.
---
I also like how it's instanced with 8 people because if you're cheeky and join the first group and a second one starts. You can actually double dip the event if you fast travel to someone who's in the second instance of the event.
---
Colossal Problem does give out Flux as a reward, maybe not as much as the Queen though. I feel like the Queen event has lost a lot of its luster. It used to be a server wide event that everyone would drop what they were doing to join. This could absolutely just be my personal experience, it just doesn't have the same draw that it used to.
---
It was definitely servers for me. I just did a colossal run and could barely walk there was only 5 of us and earl was the one that lagged everyone for some reason.. other runs have been seamless
---
I truly believe that they are doing this to make balancing easier on their end so that we actually will see...ya know...some balancing at some point. What I don't understand is actually implementing half of a solution when that half is specifically a net nerf to every form of damage.   
---
I'd much rather see them announce that they're doing this internally and giving almost a separate "roadmap" towards a fat balancing overhaul and releasing this along with changes that still allow for meaningful damage output from players while fixing some of the other outstanding issues (certain builds vastly outshining others, certain weapons not benefiting from prefixes, etc.)  
---
I'm fully aware that balancing this game is going to be a fairly long road and *I'm* *okay* with that...this is just the wrong mile marker to stop and push out changes from.
---
I love me some good office drama, please continue
---
I use a 3* Two Shot Explosive Lever Action, it is my go to weapon. However in addition to Rifleman Perks it also benefits from Explosive Expert, (Intelligence) which I also have maxed out but then it also requires Fireproof, without which I do occasionally get caught in the explosive backfire, and I've only one point allocated to Endurance...
---
I have fairly recently started using the Plasma Caster, one of these days I will craft a 3* with either a Furious or Executioners prefix, but it's great for long range sneak attacks.
---
I also hover over the spot on the map. It still put me in a solo instance and not with everyone else. There was definitely more than enough people for multiple instances but I was shoved into a solo instance.
---
Ah ok I only tried it once when I stayed and looted and didn't see one appear and couldn't find anything in my inventory. Am sure you're right though!
---
Ive gotten about 7000 screws from this event. Most in one run was 500. These screws are what's going to get me the last plans needed for the Radium Rifle.
---
Pro tip; jump between private and public server if you are farming it. Dont take the basic ones or you wont be able to loot another for 2 days or until you pick 180 not container stuff.
---
I‚Äôve done it many times, mainly because I lose the colossus body and don‚Äôt have time ü§£ but I‚Äôve always got the mystery pick
---
collect everything. sell everything.
---
Sell things....
---
But loot! And ammo ü•∫
---
Automatic weapons are the strongest weapons in the game followed by non explosive heavy weapons. Pistols suck, shotguns suck (most of the time unless you have perfect connection), riflemen sucks, explosive heavy guns like auto grenade fatman and missile launcher suck. Power armor is damn near useless unless you're a heavy gun build.
---
Bloodied is the best legendary effect followed by junkies and then anti armor. Sneaking is really strong. Make sure to get the adrenal reaction, marsupial, and speed demon serums. Trading is the best way to get good gear.
---
That's all I can think of right now
---
Yes, yes indeed we need more events like that.  More boss fights revolving around nuke drops.
---
I launch acp sbq acp. Ive always had full attendance at sbq. Prolly cause meat week was boring lol.
---
Queen fights til i die. :) also i blue screen half the time in acp and it makes me unhappy lol
---
So how would you not be able to join one instance?
---
Perfectly, I put them on my porch.
---
and Railway. I somehow lost my JE90.
---
Food build is the dumbest fucking name.
---
Good points. For me personally I like camp building, exploration, and the Queen fight, radiation rumble, project paradise. A specific example is I normally do not do Uranium Fever, but if kill 10 mole miners, scrap 10 weapons, kill 3 legendaries, and do an event were the dailies, it became clear to me that was expected. Now that it is over I am no longer doing that event.
---
I joined the event the second it spawned, was the only one in my instance. My team, who joined seconds after I did, got put in an instance with 5 other randoms. It seems that the instances are fucked up. My post claims that the nuke launcher should always have a reserved slot in the first instance because it tends to always be the most full
---
This "instance" Crap is just Freaking Bullshit anyway!
---
thanks, I'll have to add demolitions into the mix and give it a go
---
Yep!  That was exactly the problem.  Thanks!
---
Totally agree. There was nothing. I expected at least a congratulations like you said.
---
The boss should be a big deathclaw matriarch with regular max lvl deathclaws around her
---
Thats my goto plan sense the event went live
---
Yeah it's not hat hard. And using glitches to skip entire portions of the silo means missing out on XP.
---
The typical response to that statement  is, "I'm level 280 I don't care about XP."
---
Well, they'll see how important XP is when the new legendary system rolls out and you have to be leveled way into the hundreds to level up legendary perk cards.
---
Did this my first time in my excitement lol. Someone was nice enough to stim me and I wore PA from then on.
---
Shit I thought it was running through the 26th, not ending the 26th. Now I'm sad cause I only got 1 tenderizer plan
---
I was there too. He just talks about other stuff all of a sudden.
---
Would probably create 25 more bugs.
---
Why cant it have insta kill attacks? 50% chance so that big boy dc can show everyone who is boss again...boost health to sheepsquatch level...make it a thing to fear no matter your build..
---
It seems you are getting the bug where you don‚Äôt actually join the event, cause the event gives 8 treasury notes and a guaranteed 3 star legendary
---
Herbivour + Good with Salt:  Tato Salad + Silt Bean soup + Vodka  
---
Pop those before any boss and you can have bloody tanky food build too :)
---
I bought the gauss mini gun plans a few weeks ago. The very next day the perveyor gave me a vampire gauss mini gun with almost the same effects. I‚Äôve never bothered to try and craft anything else since.
---
See I found a cool animation while swapping between the mole minor gauntlet and a combat rifle, in 3rd person for a second or so it shows you holding the gun over your shoulder. It would be so cool if we could  walk around like that.
---
Yea. Only thing I dont like is when he does the fear attack them makes me run directly into an acid pit/drill lol
---
Thursday to Wednesday is 7 days.
---
Maybe just not enough people joining?  I join as soon as I see it pop up, as I don't want to get stuck in one with no one else.  I've never been in one less than 5.
---
Nope, just super rare. They were in fallout 4/far harbor
---
If you mean how I wasn‚Äôt able to join other instances, idk. After waiting 3 minutes in loneliness I kept reloading it as well as fast traveling to my teammates. Didn‚Äôt work.
---
If you mean something else then whatcha mean
---
8 per instance
---
If you have some decent weapons they can go for good caps.also 1400 caps daily from vendors.sell them anything you can
---
Aye, your a kind man! I‚Äôm certainly pleased with what I got, but I thank you for the offer!
---
Well I may be mixing two things together. There are definitely Legendary weapons that fire two rounds at a time, and there are mods for missile launchers and fat man (at least maybe for others too) that have 3 or 4 barrels, but I think in those cases you have to pull the trigger repeatedly. I know the 4-barrel tracking missile launcher I have you can lock onto a target and then relatively quickly fire four missiles that will home on the target.
---
Maybe Grahm stays kosher and doesn‚Äôt work on the sabbath.
---
LOL, that's my plan!
---
I'll never understand why people piss and moan about food builds. I have a medic/food build and I've always pulled my weight with team medic/first aid/good with salt. 
---
like, imagine bitching about how someone else plays a game they paid for. amazing.
---
This idea is in the pts.
---
I did join the second it popped up. And there was about 12 people doing the event because you can see their name on the map.
---
We gonna get another one soon
---
How many times did you run it?  I did about 72 MW events, and got one Tenderizer Plan.  Seemed ultra rare to me.
---
This is already in the pts
---
I moved my camp to a location near site Charlie. And it turns out there are 2 yao guai spawns right next to it. So every 20 minutes or so she gets mauled by 2 mutated bears while she desperately tries to fight them with a pipe pistol. 
---
It's a win win, I get some 14 springs every half hour. She gets her legs torn off by bears.
---
If you're a low level (under 50) I'd say you can go to any vendor and get a max of 1400 caps a day by selling random useless junk. If you're a high level (over level 50) and have a stock pile of random legendaries you can open up a vendor at your camp and players can buy what they want from you.
---
Same here, it was really some intimate time to spend with earle alone... until a spawn popped out of nowhere and caused my bullets to kill myself, then when i respawned i noticed earle got full HP again from almost half way, I thought he‚Äôs not supposed to do that?
---
If you haven't already, finish all the other questlines : mysteries, BoS, Roses original questline, etc.  You'll get the max level rewards.  
---
If you have finished them, recraft the reward item to max level).  Ditto your armor/power armor.
---
You can do scorched earth and I have become death separately.  I did scorched earth many levels before I launched.  Still got credit for both.
---
I like the high str and per setup (same as I use).  makes you pretty versatile between heavy weapons, melee, and most rifles.
---
Since you are melee, if you don't already have it, look at healing factor mutation.  
---
Twisted muscles is great for additional  melee damage, but reduces your rifle accuracy, so make sure you get (at least) classfreak2 t offset the accuracy reduction.
---
Vampire weapons are always nice to have - offsets some of the hits you take in melee.
---
Yeah, I have TWO left and think about 2 times a day, I should just buy this shit.  But, I like the having tasks to do each day.  So I will continue for the next day or two.  Then 2 weeks of nothing to do!
---
There is also the Queen of the Hunt daily, if you deliver a Wendigo sample you get a buff against wendigos.
---
Bet the headaches aint so bad now huh? Kinda got other issues to deal with lol..
---
It's possible, but then the first time they hit me I didn't even get feedback of being shot for whatever reason. I am almost positive I have seen a legendary railway rifle in someone's vending machine that fired an extra round per shot.
---
In that case I'm never leaving the mine again! It did feel kind of wrong the one time I stayed back while everyone ran away..
---
Same here tbh. I'm running a bunch of the 90% weight reduction perks. I think if I remove all of them I'll have 3,000+ pounds of stuff on me.
---
Stand by the Tinkers workbench over at The Whitespring Station and pimp yourself out. It‚Äôs a hard life out here in the Wasteland, you gotta earn that money one cap at a time.
---
I was afk drum beating when it happened
---
Nice. I run a strength based one, so it's all swords and machetes for me. The diversity of melee weapons is kind of meh...gaudy sword or oversized glove/gauntlet. But it is what it is.
---
Farm water
---
I've joined the event once and I'm not sure if I will again because I'm not thrilled with Earle and his 90 percent or so DR. I'm not one for event rewards like  outfits and the legendaries I've gotten could have come from any random legendary enemy out there without the huge use of ammo. I just don't feel the event is worth doing, for me anyway. YMMV.
---
I'm from the UK and I assure you that nobody, in the last thirty years, has at any point used the phrase "anal" as an adjective. It is not common usage here, and it is not common usage anywhere. At this point in time, people typically associate that word with anal sex, so next time just say something normal.
---
Me too that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking opinions because I feel the same ü§£ü§£
---
I've joined it 5 times and it's been failed five times. On 4 of those occasions my One X has dropped to about 4 fps and was completely unplayable. I've lost tens of thousands of .50 cal ammo and it has made me fucking hate that quest. Is it much easier with a good team? I can't ever seem to get anyone that knows what the fuck they're doing.
---
Supposed to get 'second helping' at some point.
---
Never heard the term food build, but seems I have a good build. Fucking love food builds
---
There is such a big window of time, no excuse for it to end right in the middle. The event doesn't take more than 15 minutes, you would think that's an easy thing to work around.
---
I would only recommend people to use gatling plasma, or gatling lasers on Earle. Just because of how cheap and easy the ammo is for how much total damage it can do. Double the efficiency if you throw power user perk on to have 1000 rounds per reload for the Gatling laser.
---
it's a sexy kind of wrong
---
wtf is a food build?
---
Yeah i jumped on at lunch hoping to catch a last hurrah but nada.  
---
Definitely didn't get very many of the plans this time around. 10+ flag plans sure but only the backpack for the new items
---
Yup there goes my bullets. I‚Äôve been blue-screened and in a party with my friends hearing them cheering about their rewards. I load into the nuke zone and die with no rewards and 800 less ammo for my gauss. Thnx
---
No loot left behind!!! ü•∫ü•∫
---
Really? I go by site A all the time and it‚Äôs usually either a glowing or a ghoul Yao Guai.
---
7 days = 168 hours event was 144 hours. Yes it was active during 7 different days but 2 of those days were half days. 
---
Idgaf about it to be clear just doing math
---
As someone who normally has a shit time with RNG, i was also really happy with the drops. I think the only thing I missed out on was the backpack.
---
You time out after about 15-20 minutes.
---
Sell non legendary guns to robots and ammo to players
---
Good story!
---
What is a Food Build though?
---
Is that just "Eat a bunch of stuff periodically" thing?
---
I have Carnivore, Good with Salt and Thru-Hiker, and I collect and cook every piece of Meat I find, then eat the top 5 different things in my inventory that are spoiling soonest every 30 minutes.
---
Is that a Food Build?
---
Now i hope they bring the Hex barrel for the gauss minigun out too
---
Ah, ok.
---
I live in Houston and just used my cooking station to craft up some boiled water. That should go good with my stash of pemmican to keep me fed. Ya‚Äôll stay safe out there.
---
How many times did you do the event?  I did about 72, got the tenderizer plan once.
---
i wish, ps4
---
its fo76 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I always join Scorched Earth if it comes up, mostly for the flux and improved repair kits as I've never gotten a good legendary from her. I never start it myself because I just don't care for doing the silos.
---
"Be cleansed by righteous fire!" -BornFabled, probably
---
I want a small liberator
---
It makes my facial hair disappear, anyone else? Plus, what‚Äôs with the no glasses? You can wear them with the Nuka spacesuit. How about some consistency??
---
Falwell invited?
---
I have a vampire ffr tesla. Is that good enough?
---
You don't need Grahm for that, you put them on the BBQ grills.  I server hop until I find an event where he's there though when it was still running.
---
Same where is everyone now
---
Not sure why they haven‚Äôt done the other robots already. Could just make them do the same function as the protectrons.
---
I hear ya, this has definitely happened before to me as well - and just like you, I saw after a couple of days (maybe it was weeks), not sure, it went back down again, according to Wasteland_Veteran here in the comments, it has to do with the small generators from the Atom shop.  In my case, this would make sense, since I'm using 18 of them, so - if they increased the budget required for each one, that would explain the jump I noticed right away, are you using any of the small blue vault tec generators from the Atom shop in your camp?
---
Same! I was waiting on the drums and all of a sudden everything disappeared and the other guy on the drums was just spinning in circles lol
---
Yes, but 'second helping' another week is coming at some point.  Read it now so you know what to do then.
---
I was online and at the event when it disappeared today. Surreal. But Graham and Chally remained and he had the radiation emitter plan I was apparently missing after 200 levels.  
---
I kept trying to get the mirror ball, but I guess I'll see him around Appalachia!
---
Yall too man.. I'm gonna grill up a few alligators to go with my boiled water lol
---
Neither of my magic gun (JFFR Gauss Minigun and Ultracite Gatling Laser) shred either boss, they'll often shred Sheepsquatches and Sentry Bots, if a bloodied build doesn't get to them first, but I only use them after it looks like everyone has tagged it. I'm unsure if my guns are actually doing magic damage durring the boss fights, maybe I just have too much lag and my perspective is skewed on how 'broken' they are.
---
I can understand a need to find a solution on PC if it is bad as you say but the Xbox situation does not seem to need the same removal solution.
---
thats not what edgy means...
---
Group up?? Hahaha
---
The game is poorly optimised i recommend just trying to keep your console cool so it can atleast try to get frames
---
What do lunch boxes even do anyways?
---
Where did you get your 255 number? Actually curious. I've only ever heard the 180 number
---
If they ever do "pets" they need to include the "tamed"Liberator.
---
I was about to mod myself a Eyebot helmet if the fishbowl never came. So happy I don't have to figure out 76's mod system yet lol.
---
Perfectly put! As a Vanguard's/food/pistol build, I have run into a lot of players who give me grief over the build. As if doing max plasma pistol DMG, with 500+ DR, and an unstoppable health bar is a bad thing. Geez....
---
Good post my friend!
---
Haha I'm on ps4, sorry mate lol
---
something or someone¬†trying too hard¬†to¬†be cool, almost to a point where it's¬†cringe worthy
---
Good to now, I really thought Beth wouldn't fix this
---
Suppressor seems like it would be better than tenderizer if it affects damage to players outside of your team, like where you have 0-2 teams fighting Earl
---
100% false
---
Oh well, those are the rules you agree too when you take workshops. The first time I found a workshop (Red Rocket) it took me while to clear out and then when I went to go claim it, i got a message that it was a pvp zone. I never took them until I was around level 90 and I could hold my own. If players disregard the warning, they get what they deserve.
---
&gt;I miss chally already
---
I gave beckett the outfit and backpack and jailed his ass in the Circus cage trailer lol.
---
 Not the same thing, but it works /s
---
Never ever taking off Good With Salt
---
Lag is yes, it reduces damage taken if the server can't keep up as well. Performance problems are a pc and console thing but you can do a lot to get better performance on pc so it's not as huge an issue.
---
Hey sometimes your jetpack just decides not to reduce falling damage.
---
If you'd like, I have an extra backpack plan I'd give you.
---
I was in the last cookout as well, but everything vanished quickly for me! Grahm began walking away, but I was able to speak with him before he left. It made me sad, too. Also, love the imagery with the Infinity Gauntlet!
---
I got the clock and one of the other plans I‚Äôve only found on him
---
Absolutely no need to apologize. Unless you had done research ahead of time (which you shouldn't be expected to), you wouldn't have known. My wife experienced the [same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hauty7/my_encryptid_story_a_story_of_fright_intrigue_and/).
---
Question: I just bought the plan for the shielded ss underarmor and it‚Äôs not showing up to craft in my bench.  I went back to the vault and sure enough it says I know it.  Is it just a mod?
---
Yeah mine auto completed on Monday. Sucks since I‚Äôm so close to finishing.
---
Yeah, the launch crew robots that you have to protect from the hostile robots can be healed with shiskebab / flamer bashes with the friendly fire card. Usually it is not too hard to launch nukes, but every once an a while an assaultron or colonel gutsy decides to put the hurt on the launch crew.
---
+25% xp up to 100% if you use 4. They last 1 hour.
---
The legendary run gives you iirc 20+ lunchboxes.
---
With in-game buffs from food, int, etc you can easily get another 80%-100% bonus or so.
---
Run at +180% of base xp and you will farm legendary run easy. It'll be boring, but easy.
---
Good call, the improved repair kits do come in clutch.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm a filthy casual and have no idea what a good build is
---
Well I didnt get the tenderizer or the spicy mod.  Oh well.  Got the black chef hat finally though
---
This is not a thing. At all. Otherwise I would've melted everyone around me and my boyfriend. Hell, we were doing RR with Teslas. No one gets killed unless they shoot back, therefore triggering PvP.
---
*slap damage no longer exists*
---
I just save arrows, crossbow bolts, and syringer darts because they are light and toss them in their when I get the max point amount. I'll do that until I hit the 100K point mark and just save them for a rainy day.
---
The UI is still not great, but slightly better than before. When you select to sell/buy it will take you to the next screen to confirm, if you just hit TAB it takes you right back to the buy/sell screen of whatever ammo you were doing. So if you have a lot of one ammo to convert doing that makes it a lot faster instead of cycling through again.
---
Because they‚Äôre jealous pricks.
---
I'm right up the road from you, kinda, in central MS! Been keeping a close eye on things since I have friends in LA. Stay safe! I hope you're in a good spot and stocked up! Every hurricane season since Katrina I'm on edge and worry constantly damn near the whole time.
---
Has it actually happened to YOU, though? Because chances are, that Person2 shot Person1 back and got killed by a Tesla.
---
Just to clarify - is there no list at all, or do you have the list of new challenges and they are all completed?
---
I love my heavy pyro/medic build
---
Next time, bring 5 Prime Meat to the BBQ area ( you know, where the bear is on a spit ) and you‚Äôll get the the option to deposit them. Do that and you‚Äôll advance the event meter and get a scrip reward.
---
Same,  I usually have 150~ and like 75 super stims.
---
Teslas cannot void passive mode. OP is an ignorant twat.
---
what about us players that rely on vampire weapons? I have a vampire's 50 cal and a vampires gauss shotgun and they allow me to tank pretty much any kind of damage. I get caught off guard occasionally, but for the most part I'm nearly invincible. 
---
I do have all three levels of shotgun damage equipped though, along with enforcer and bloody mess.
---
I thought it was until tomorrow also.  No tenderizer plan for me.  Sad face emoji
---
üò¢x1000
---
I‚Äôve had that problem for a while. Just took a 2 week break and got on, went to almost all the locations and found nothing
---
Can confirm same for plans
---
I legit got so tired of listening to her I broke up with her and scrapped her computer.
---
I keep meaning to bring Raider Punk back he was pretty chill.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I had help both times lol
---
I was on the drums with two others while a guy spun around endlessly in circles.
---
angryturtle made a youtube video about spawning enemies and items. he puts a lot of effort into his video and he hasn't been wrong yet. 
---
The 180 number i've only ever seen here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
So i decided to test it myself. I looted 180 items (just over) and things didn't respawn. So i kept going. Unfortunately i messed up. not once but three times doing this. Is it 180. Definitely not. is it 255. probably. I went back to check the weights and they were back after looting more than 255 things. 
---
One day i shall test it properly and not mess up. probably after saturday as i am off work for a week. ALSO! Gold club is probably the best p[lace to get a lot of items quickly. There's easily 300+ things in that place. Oh and flowers count as well. Not sure if other plants count as you could go to billings homestead and there's something like 60 razorgrain growing there (or was it corn).
---
No greens my ass. I worked verrry hard to ensure everyone had their sprouts!
---
Stand up?  That's crazy talk ;)
---
Yeah I go to locations and get nothing also...which is pissing me off
---
Somebody asked me a question and I answered honestly haha.
---
Ok ty. I could've sworn I picked one up there a year ago.
---
They are all completed
---
We should be good on supplies. We got lucky for rita and Katrina  and they dodged us both.. but I've seen the aftermath from rita and it looked like a bomb went off. I'll never forget it
---
It's not an event, it's a way of life ;)
---
Ok
---
How!!!
---
I'm level 221 and run into the problem where I cant kill a level 20 player trying to claim my workshop. I've heard that if your weapon is too high level or deals too much damage you can't harm other players. It seems true for me.
---
Awesome thank you for your info, and your time testing
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think you should get staggered while in power armor. Was doing the primal cuts that had yao guai and they were staggering me constantly.
---
Think I might be able to one-up you, [the second-ever roll I did today.](https://gyazo.com/612fe28f6ae7ab2a8a719fdc0311117e)
---
I hate that guy.   ‚ÄòHow NOW brown cow‚Äô got so old, I wish I could tear down every relay tower just to crush his dreams of being a radio personality
---
I didn‚Äôt even get to attend meat week üòî I wasn‚Äôt home this whole week Pain.
---
We will most likely get a second round of it
---
Yea isn't it supposed to set up multiple instances rather than disappear after the first 8 players join?
---
There used to be. And I saw the option to build one in a workshop a few days ago.
---
It's per strike, that's why fss is the best for friendly fire. That stacked with martial artist as kept me alive using other vamp weapons.
---
Prime it, seriously
---
That's damn close, but I'd still take the Vampire effect to keep me alive.
---
thats dope dude
---
Far harbor is the only place I‚Äôve seen em other than the cabin thing in the mire
---
You can‚Äôt say you have good weapons or you get downvoted. You can‚Äôt say at level 58 you have a fully optimised build or they call bullshit and demand PvP, in which I fry their ass.
---
Also well trod ground here.
---
And my well-trod response is that the workshops represent a significant dynamic in the economic system.
---
If I need to extract something at length, I either have to pay extra money to get a first account and use a private world, or I have to engage in behavior I don't find fun even though I paid full price for this game too.
---
I still think it would lead to more, and more interesting PVP to do it my way. Right now there is no crossover between the PVP and the non-PVP. My system would allow for the ability for both sides to interview The engagement as there were. Rather than being able to be sniped while You're busy. The PVP player can challenge your workshop ownership by simply taking it from you, and if you wanted back you can see whether or not it's a fight of potential parity.
---
Anybody who's good for all comers can leave his PVP mode active all the time. Anybody who's only interested in otherwise fair exchange can have his PVP turned off, get challenged, decide it looks like an interesting fight and go try to take his shit back. And the people who never want a PVP just end up losing their workshop or not being able to take a workshop from anybody else.
---
If I and everybody else simply avoid the workshops completely, you've got no real way to challenge me at all or lure me into another wise quote fair quote fight. So you get no truck with me at all.
---
if some guy who's 5 to 10 times my level comes along just because he wants to headshot me while I'm in the inventory menu, well wasn't that fun... And there were certainly no challenge to it.
---
But somebody comes along who's about my same level and takes my workshop, maybe I turn my PVP on and go try to take it back.
---
I personally probably wouldn't, but some people might, and right now the mechanisms mean you will never get a response from the people who otherwise might.
---
The entire PVP mechanism as it exists today relies on the concept of bullying. The bully can always come take your crap. In this case the bully just happens to be somebody with much more experience in the game most of the time.
---
So the mechanism I propose allows for four different potential relationships instead of two. I'm not saying the other two quadrants are going to be popular, but it's at least two more shots.
---
You can try but i dont think a tesla is fast enough to keep up with the damage of earl and his minions
---
Yes, it‚Äôs supposed to spawn another instance after the first one is full. In my case I was the first one at the event and I didn‚Äôt even see my own team who was also doing the event.
---
Yeah only Yao Guai I‚Äôve seen outside Alpha is glowing
---
No that's it. Sorry :/
---
This is the way
---
Yea it definitely seems to disappear instead atm, I saw the event start while I was trading and by the time I finished the trade the event was gone. Definitely didn't open up multiple instances
---
I think some kicks are not really kicks. I was leader of a building team and it said "playername" was kicked. I didn't kick anyone I think people leave or get disconnected and that's the message that plays.
---
exactly. i play mostly in pa and if I don't spot those kind of creatures and kill them before they approach it turns into an annoying game. it's even more annoying that if I find a roof or a small spot where it can't get me it starts to run away only to come back when you least expect it if you don't run chasing it. I get it's ai, it's just extremely annoying or maybe I need a break from this game or maybe both xD
---
For me auto works fine. When on a team with other people I speak to them if I‚Äôm not on a team or in a team by myself it switches to area
---
Gotcha. That's the auto-complete bug, nothing can be done about it.
---
You have forgotten the day between Monday and Tuesday.  Incidentally this is also the day you can complete your autocompleted score, there are no bugs, and rng doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
He said he had it taped down which let's you afk as long as the server is open and your controller is plugged in the console.
---
Like we are all hear to help each other and talk experiences ya know? My buddy doesn‚Äôt understand that a Lvl 50 and a Lvl 700 could have the same build doing the same damage lol. You running Bloodied?
---
Fallout 76: New and Improved!  More Monsters!  More Land!  More Lag!
---
In my experience, being logged in around reset time fucks me over and gives me the autocomplete bug.
---
Start a team and let people join you.
---
Can one get the mods vi scrapping?  I got the tenderizer plan.  But none of the mods.  :-/
---
I just buy 308 off of player vendors for 1 cap each. 
---
I mainly just use my 5mm Gatling gun though for most of the enemies because LMG is just over kill for trash mobs.
---
I didn't read it all sorry lol
---
Auto means when solo you're in area but when you join a team it goes into team chat
---
stay and lute, that's what I do.
---
Someone still on the drums, as the Event ended, started blasting Phil Collins through their mic. HaHa.
---
I didn't say magic guns need removal, those simply need to be patched. Legacy guns need to be removed, or if they even can, be patched just the same, they're all benefiting from different bugs that need to be fixed
---
Hacked weapons, or glitched weapons however, need to be removed, the sort like a 50. cal that does 2000 energy damage. And I know they can do that
---
Ah shit yeah I forgot about that.
---
Ok guess I just am not gonna have a companion at my camp, they all get annoying lol
---
Seeing the Meat Week Cookout disappear in front of my eyes was sad, but also sort of funny. I met up with Grahm somewhere else and I bought a scarecrow plan from him and when I looked away, then looked back he was gone, without a trace. Very unexpected ending for Meat Week for me.
---
I don't have healing factor and it's been an issue for me as well.
---
I respectfully disagree...
---
A word can mean two things. And people have differen't definitions for a food build, for example Captain noob and TYR consider anyone using good with salt or good with salt a food build.
---
Altough they were a bit drunk on that live stream.
---
Also, this sub is pretty casual and really slow to jump on the latest meta's, for example: magic weapons.
---
Also loadouts can make your build a different type easily. For example,
---
Commando &gt; Rifleman
---
Heavy Gunner &gt; Shotgunner &gt; Melee
---
Bloodied &gt; Full health
---
I don't see why swapping to good with salt, rejuvenated, hunter's bounty and/or tru-hiker wouldn't make your build a (optimized) melee food build in a same manner as sneaking makes a commando a sneak commando. A melee character can benefit more from food damage wise than from the actual melee perks under the strength tree.
---
But I guess it's up to interpretation.
---
Wow that's great!
---
Prime helps me alot, resources aren't an issue for me, its just the amount of times I have to spam A to craft 308. The prime crafts more and does more damage
---
get the manta-man outfit and youre mysterio
---
I don‚Äôt judge or critique people‚Äôs builds unless they ask me to.
---
As long as you‚Äôre having fun, then you‚Äôre using a good build.
---
The strictly private teams don't get any stat bonus, so they need to first be public (for the bonus) and then add their friends to it
---
Unless they change how the stat bonus works it's just going to be how it is...
---
Man even with my mutations I saw that hole and I was like nope not jumping in I didn't wanna risk getting respawned outside.
---
Everyone booed me If I mentioned the event ends too fast. Now here you go, a definitive proof that I was right (:
---
When you login, join a public team. Soon as Uranium fever appears, join it and hope most of your team does. Kill everything, not just in the event, Once it‚Äôs over everything in the mine as well. Then pick up everything that is possible. Walk out to train station, scrap junk, bulk, and sell everything you picked up across all tabs. You should be pretty close to max caps for the day.
---
I was able to launch my first nuke at level 30 because of them. The silo was a nightmare but the payoff was amazing
---
Alright I‚Äôll try that
---
I run bloodied power armor minigun build, and the only thing that kills me is the debris or acid. I can face tank Earl without much trouble. Just use stims every now and then.
---
I love running Friendly Fire.
---
If we reach the goal in the next atlas donations we can have a second helping.
---
that's a great breakdown, thanks! I guess I'll try dragging in some extra friends to test this one out.
---
yep, 172 ammo per craft (2 pts in ammo smith, not including super duper) is the way to go!
---
I‚Äôm not upset about it unless I‚Äôm in the middle of an event.
---
Consider using Final Word if you want a good all around heavy weapon to compliment builds
---
I don't think so, there were 3 participants when I joined
---
Yeah, Chally loves them but Grahm won‚Äôt touch them...
---
Make sure you join a team though. As everything they kill, you can loot as well. So effectively you can loot almost every dead miner if all your team is there.
---
The ammo save is far too good for me personally
---
Sure am
---
That's what I've experienced, but it just felt like it wasn't intended. To me, Auto implies that it should switch between Area/Team on the fly, but I guess not. I suppose I'll just keep it on Area since that's usually far more useful to me than Team.
---
If only i had known...
---
It‚Äôs funny, Beth replies to me last time Meat Week occurred and told me they would allow the event to finish next time. Lmao
---
If you can find an outfit plan for sale eg Insurgent - you can craft them and with the vendor perk + grape mentats sell them for 25 caps a piece.  
---
That, and just selling a bunch of purifier water - build a base where you can access to large bodies of water
---
Is that a steel collector?
---
Well the event‚Äôs icon disappears after 5 minutes so that could‚Äôve been it
---
At level 21 it‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôd say, as you‚Äôre often low on ammo. A pistol, a ranger sniper rifle, a shotgun and a semi auto would be normal for me at that level.
---
First of all, power armor is absolute garbage for PvP. It does more to harm you than anything else.
---
One shot kills technically aren't a thing anymore, because *the damage cap for PvP is at 110*. More likely than not, you're being two tapped. This does not require legacy weapons to achieve. I can do this with low level legendary weapons, especially if my victim has crap armor. If you don't want to be killed, don't stay within the workshop boundaries. I hunt players who stay inside the zone, especially if they're afk in a bed. 
---
Yes, you are correct. Pacifist mode will not make you immune to workshop PvP. Otherwise people would just camp at workshops forever with Pacifist mode on.
---
I'm not sure what your build is, so it's hard to suggest specific armor other than maybe even just a basic set of assassin's sentinel. Legendary leather sets are also nice. Look on the trading networks. What you need will depend on your build and playstyle. If you're on PC I'd be happy to give you some more pointers in game.
---
Bloodied or two shot with limb damage and faster reload
---
Yep.  Its there so I can recycle power armor left behind when the BOS visits
---
Probably two shot, limb damage, faster reload
---
Since I'm pretty sure explosive guns like that are bugged and and ts deals full explosive damage like legacy weapons
---
But really any roll will be garbage on that gun
---
Yes it's so unlike Bethesda to fuck up something so incredibly simple as telling the correct time.
---
I'm still trying to figure out why everyone isn't on 4 player building teams .. it like 1.5 times plus the XP of any other category.. I feel your frustration man .. why not get more XP .. more levels .. more score. ..
---
I will miss the Meat Week... I love it! But one sad thing is graham telling his pre-war life.
---
Trust me honey, we PvPers are not short on resources. üòÇ
---
Yeah I have always gotten it and only escaped twice out of 4 times. I even got a black loading screen on third attempt. Waited ten minutes closed game down on Xbox and got back on and got all rewards. Even for first cursed harpoon
---
All valid points and I agree with most but the level up one really rubbed me the wrong way. The amount of XP I need to level up can only be described as absurd and time consuming. Running West-Tek, Huntersville, the NAR, the Burrows and the DMV is no longer enough to level me up once. 
---
Considering that there are players like me who don't go all in on Unyielding to max out the XP gain it should simply not be on the challenge list. 
---
I know that I could have used a toon to do the level ups but I don't think that utilizing toons is a good mechanic. It's silly to get riled up about this but I just hate how lazy some of those "challenges" are. :)
---
Like a piece of my heart broke.  It's legit my favorite event.
---
You bet your sweet bippy I love NOT hearing it even more! LOL
---
Blissful silence!
---
Stay and loot the screws, ammo, etc. I'd much rather be clouded in by the collapsed mine with the mats/ammo than trying to sprint my ass off to a chest-full-o-crap reward
---
Different strokes for different strokes....that's a really nice roll.
---
Lol yeah! At that point I had built my character around using grenades but I had been out of grenades for while now. Shame cuz I feel like some nuka grenades could have at the very least thinned out the robots.
---
It used to be different (we could hunt people and send 1 person to go to the victim's location while the other team member tapped the workshop), but yes, now you can only PvP with them if y'all are in the workshop perimeters.
---
a squirrel.  but it should legit be wearing a crown
---
I've tried it but not that exact method. I've just killed the raider and then tried to quickly back out of the convo with that response. I'll try this exact way and see if that helps.
---
Yeah, they need a buff..... or more mods.....
---
It‚Äôs has tons of fun and it‚Äôs great in that way, could use a few improvements but besides that it‚Äôs definitely a welcome addition.
---
I had no idea I was missing SO many benches!!!
---
I just wish diffusers acted the same way.
---
I found that out accidentally. I was farming three workshops and I got softlocked, and I was hot about it. I went back in, figuring I'd just chalk the workshops up as a loss and do a few Meat Cooks, but I went to one of the workshops just for the hell of it and everything I'd built was there. I went back and quickly reclaimed all three (didn't even need to do a retake) and I was back in business.
---
Exactly. They took away so much of the PvP aspects because of whiny foodbuilds who want this to be a fun and easy Candyland.
---
food builds ? sorry im new
---
Me and my friend can‚Äôt join each other because of this. Tried looking it up but found nothing. Typed in the entire error msg in google and this post showed up. 
---
If no one‚Äôs talking about it, it might be a while before it gets fixed. Kinda makes me not want to play until then...
---
first of all how dare you
---
Hmm probably around 30 times, guess I got lucky cause I heard it's like 2.75% chance of getting tendy plan from a maxed out event bar, less from lower levels of completion
---
I need to bump into you then üòÉ
---
Food builds are to complicated for me lol
---
PC
---
I thought meat week was supposed to last a week this time. Meat six days... did they forget they started two days late?
---
No. 
---
Also the Wendigo Spawns don't count as Glowing because they are not marked in the game files as such. It's unclear if this is intentional or an oversight.
---
but , I might get it on PS4 if I can convince someone else to join me on it
---
Damn, lol. I finished the wastelanders at lvl 40, so didn't get the best scaled version and scripted it
---
strong edit. I see you get it for finishing Beckett questline
---
its so advanced that it shaved off my mustache!
---
You can also start as a private team and convert it to public, which is what we do. Sometimes that leaves a spot open and who ever joins, joins.
---
Fair points. The leveling up one was pretty much the only one I didn't do daily due to time constraints. I do find that about 3-4 runs through West Tek would do it (at 191 currently)...if I had time. The new grouping mechanic really helps with that too.
---
Also, I never even considered that my Unyeiding set was helping me with xp. I have most of my set as Unyielding (not a Bloodied build), but that's just so I can jump in the water to fast-travel if I'm encumbered. I join the Building groups but completely forgot the INT bonus from the armor :)
---
Glory to the VANGUARDS.
---
it's like they forgot it started late
---
Of all the fixes needed, this should go right at the bottom, dignity or not!lol
---
It's time to run like hell ain't it? I wish you luck in Godspeed.
---
Something did change recently, though I haven't experienced not being able to loot them.  
---
It's just, something about the ash piles and plasma piles, if there's a heap of them, seems to cause a great deal of lag.  
---
I'd only pull the weapon as an absolute last resort. Like, "The only way we can fix this is pull the weapon, rebuild it, and reimplement it" situation. Otherwise, leave it in while searching for what went wrong in the first place. Pulling it before then could well create more bugs than it would solve.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help....
---
üòÇüëª
---
I just wanna kill stuff with lightning bolts ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ The dev team needs to fix the Teslas asap
---
well for me it was 90% reduced weight. I used it for line in the sand when the scorched, well, you know.
---
8 people per instance. So if nine people join, the ninth person gets put in their own instance and have to fight Earl themselves. Most likely the power players will jump on the event quickly and be in the first instance.
---
:(
---
What you later describe is exactly why food build is not a combat build. I eat food for my melee damage. That doesn‚Äôt make me a food build. Food is just a necessary mechanic of the game that a player can take advantage of. I don‚Äôt carry stimpaks and call myself a medic, because that‚Äôs not what a medic is. Other games call food builds other things(mule is popular in others but we use that for alt accounts).
---
While terminology can be subjective, that is why majority rules. While food build I a loose term, it‚Äôs understood what it means. The difference between captain noob saying ‚Äúif you use this perk, you‚Äôre a food build‚Äù and you saying a food build is someone that uses food for combat is that he‚Äôs taking the agreed upon term loosely. Your definition would change what a food build means completely, even if both are just as far from the definition.
---
I‚Äôm not sure where you were going with the loadouts things. Any build can be altered in this game with some card changes, that‚Äôs just their chosen mechanic. But either way it comes back to what I was trying to say which is food is not an optimized build. You don‚Äôt equip perks that give you more food and become a food/melee/bloodied. It‚Äôs just a term to address players who put survivability and QoL before combat. And that could mean lockpicking perks, hunger reduc, green thumb. 
---
It‚Äôs just a way to describe a build that isn‚Äôt made towards any specific end goal.
---
Quick test might be the book house in Summersville. Pickup some weights, travel to the book house, pickup 255 books then check back to weights.
---
Edit: that house has easily 350 books
---
Every time I've gone to the event I've gotten into an instance where I can fight Earl isn't that what's supposed to happen?  What kind of a broken instance?
---
Just happened to me....ugh...so we have to wait on a fix....should I fill out a ticket with Bethesda?
---
The issue you're describing is to do with meat / ash piles....not with teslas. You make a lot of them all in one place and you have issues. 
---
Teslas can do that but no more so than any weapon with a large enough area of effect, so if you'd need to remove weapons with the explosive effect as well to be effective....better to fix the meat piles I think.
---
Now if you'd ask about whether it was reasonable to have a weapon that didn't need to be aimed at anything except vaguely at the ground in order to hit nearby enemies well.....
---
Yeah, a popup of some comic book style art where Cosmos and Jangles put Doctor Zorbo in space jail or something, would have been fun.
---
i can confirm this.  but not in game.  its my wife
---
There‚Äôs just too much shit to account for. At lvl 300+ I‚Äôd like some actual stats to see how many wins/kills/revives etc I actually have. Not just recorded videos
---
Thats is what‚Äôs supposed to happen, yes
---
Bethesda?? No way
---
Nice, I actually got a Vampire‚Äôs Light Machine Gun from my first Colossal Problem.
---
Right. I don't think people realize how much xp they lose on other teams.
---
I just want a little boatfly
---
This is brilliant.
---
GRAHAM NOT FEEL SO GOOD, MISTER STARK
---
Not really?  The shitty legendary effects are still shitty.  You could delete Bloodied/Junkies from the game entirely and people still wouldn't want garbage like Nocturnal or Troubleshooters.
---
I think Beckett is the least annoying but it's still the same running dialog over and over.
---
Totally!  I do it all the time.
---
This was nice to hear. Damn near climaxed.
---
people already do this enough without the progress bar. that would just attract swarms of vultures
---
It‚Äôs to the right of vault 76 right? My camp is at that exact location. I have a brotherhood themed camp there.
---
I'm not saying they're good, just that they're better comparatively.
---
I hate it when you start loosing shared buffs right when you start taking on the boss ... Oh that sucks üò¢
---
Oh that would be cool
---
Did you take the short cut and jump up to the exit with marsupial and then back track? If so take the long way. Buddy had this issue apparently there is a trigger that only activates the sequence when you come in the long way. I suspect they didn't expect low level players to have marsupial.
---
So... Am I a "bloodied unyielding stealth food commando"?[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f348ab&amp;d=sa2s01pg2ph2pi2pp2p02e60em1c72ic4ir2ar2an2ao0lu2l71la2lt2s72&amp;m=051c249fe8&amp;am=182735-182735-182735-182735-182735&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142534&amp;n=Stealth%20Commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f348ab&amp;d=sa2s01pg2ph2pi2pp2p02e60em1c72ic4ir2ar2an2ao0lu2l71la2lt2s72&amp;m=051c249fe8&amp;am=182735-182735-182735-182735-182735&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142534&amp;n=Stealth%20Commando)
---
I've had similar occurrences at a SBQ fight. As soon as that thing went down and died less than 15 seconds later something had gotten me too. When I respawned I was able to loot her but never got the flux or anything else.
---
Glow sight doesn't work on them either. Whether this was intentional or not is anyone's guess. There is a magazine that will work on them though.
---
You can find them in vendors sometimes.  Usually for like 3k.  
---
It maxes at Level 45.   But .50 is easy to craft.  And the Anti Armor/FFR is really nice for the SBQ.   
---
I do a hybrid shotgun/rifle build.  But also am speced for heavy/rifle when I want.
---
Tbh for what we get for Fallout 1st and the fact we have been let down time and time again with lack of updates or upgrades I feel the same as you guys in Australia as here in the U.K Fallout 1st is ¬£11.99 a month where as services like Amazon prime which offers more usefulness is only ¬£4.99 a month. So yeah come on Bethesda how about you start giving us Loyal and or cash paying players some actual value for our hard earned money not so much take take take.
---
Too many of my NV playthrough ended with me as a sneak sniper. Anti-Materiel rifle was incredible
---
I did this too and felt bad after, felt even worse when I saw it in my misc tab weighing in at 0.5lbs, being a quest item I thought it would be weightless, now I‚Äôm thinking I might have to place it in a vendor if it‚Äôs tradable or drop it
---
I've seen them a few times, but it's rare
---
I finally got the Starburst Clock after over a year and over 1000 attempts at his inventory.
---
I'm hoping that our further accumulated SCORE will roll over to the next season, but I'm probably kidding myself.
---
I one or two shot non sbq/wc enemies with my bloodied death claw gauntlet so I‚Äôm not too worried about missing out on extra damage
---
Bethesda needs to climb down from Mount Olympus and get some fresh air now and then. It might actually help.
---
Didn't realise you enjoy it that much. Explains why you're often on mute...
---
Edit: Bros before bugs... Bethesda, please don't fix
---
I just wish I could hand it back over, maybe its better to lie? Its false hope but sometimes in a world like fallout its for the best right?
---
Weird. I never had that problem with Primal Cuts and I did at least 50 of them.
---
It‚Äôs over? I only did one event. ü§ï
---
Kicking is up to the team leader. I think the following are valid reasons to kick someone:
---
So you can play with friends,
---
Background noise from an open mic,
---
Sharing perks that are detrimental to a build,
---
Not mutated,
---
Constant jabbering...
---
But that's just me.
---
Sheepsquatches should've been swapped with Deathclaws. Honestly just swap them around
---
They're "meh"  at best.   I had a deathclaw as a pet, and the little bastard I swear could open doors, I cant tell you how many times he ended up, up stairs in my camp.   The best pet imo would have to be the meirlurk king.   Actually fights stuff,  and doesn't die within two or three hits
---
I suspect that a majority of those who are complaining about the nerfs had no previous online game experience and kind of expect this game to be in line with the previous ones. After a certain point you are literally the scourge of the wastes and your power knows no equals. That simply doesn't work in an online game, not even one like this. :)
---
Health regen armor can also trigger it
---
you are still confused
---
It's not just food builds that don't like teslas.  It's a cheese weapon, sorry.  It discourages aiming just keyboard mash to victory.
---
I‚Äôd like to see what you‚Äôre running if possible? I want to compare builds. I feel like I‚Äôm optimized but maybe other insight would help
---
Oh I forgot to ask if you had it - but the Raider ammo producer could really help.  It‚Äôs allows me to maintain my 5.56 supply without having to craft any.
---
That last line gave me the Meat Sweats.....have an upvote.
---
Appalachia's newest band - Chally and the Moo Moos!
---
I don't use building teams at the moment simply because I have finished the legendary run and dont really wish to earn huge xp right now. I usually use any of the other non xp boosting ones instead. I'll switch back to building team when the new season starts.
---
I was hoping by saying I found nothing it would avoid any follow up dialogue involving the news that her dad was very much alive but now had 3 heads and anger management issues, on balance I think just handing over the holotape is probably the kindest thing to do in the end but it is a shame we can‚Äôt return it at a later date and say ‚Äúhey I was sown the mine again and found this‚Äù
---
As a Floridian stay safe my dude . We will keep you in our thoughts out here in the wasteland, I'll make sure to give Earle hell for ya.
---
correction: Thursday through Wednesday is 7 days.
---
Voice chat is so buggy in this game, which is why I usually end up being in a party on Xbox.
---
I‚Äôm part of the Xbox insiders club, whenever you do these little quests (mostly surveys for feedback, or using some new app) you get points towards a level up for your insider score. Whenever you level up is does the most satisfying little 8bit game style screen wipe and midi music with a giant level up button, it‚Äôs so simple and satisfying.
---
It actually says CPD on it, Charleston Police Department.   
---
They had their bases covered on it, definitely.   
---
Personally, I'd leave out faction uniforms like NCR / Legion, they're a far cry from Piper's 'Anyone could make this' leather coat. That being said, I wouldn't mind getting some of the more generalized outfits from NV like the casual ranger gear, merc outfits, etc. Stuff that looks like anyone anywhere could make it and not be trying to emulate a faction.
---
I thought I wouldn‚Äôt see too much of modders doing useful stuff in FO76, if only because of how limited their tools would be. Turns out that just providing basic QOL tweaks is enough to show up the devs, however. That‚Äôs how low they‚Äôve set the bar.
---
Colossus clipped 2 times, never finished the raid (PS4)
---
I have a junies ffr and I'm looking for a bloodied ffr
---
No. I agree animation looks stupid.  Its why I hide my weapon when running.   And that‚Äôs what I stated.
---
Who is worse, ward or Preston Garvey?
---
Nice title, sad content
---
 I came up with a list ages ago:
---
I thought of the idea of having different boss creatures spawn at different fissure sites when nuked:
---
There is a deathclaw cave not far from the pumpkin house. The fissure next to the pumpkin house could spawn a scorched chamelon deathclaw king, with the ability to go invisible, grab people and throw them super far away. Also, it could have a mighty roar that damages players every now and then, but it leaves the deathclaw incapacitated for 20 seconds as the roar is super powerful. It's main weakness would be the legs and eyes and can be crippled so that it doesn't go invisible.
---
The fissure sites closer to the forest could spawn the almighty mothman king. It has the ability to blind all who are in eye contact for 10 seconds every time the eyes change from red to black (3 seconds after they turn black to give people a chance) it can also fly and teleport, but both rarely.
---
The second fissure site close to the forest may spawn the prime Grafton monster. This monstrosity can shoot a wave of black tar over the enemies in front, slowing their movement by half. The tar can be ignited to cause damage to the Grafton monster. It also has a third arm at the back, so that the back can't easily be attacked. It has two faces which are it's weak spot.
---
The fissure site at the top of cranberry bog could spawn an ancient supreme behemoth, which can throw boulders 3 times as large and also has a ground shattering mace that damages players who are in front of the attack. It is vulnerable from it's sides as they are cut open and bleeding.
---
These ideas are wild, but would be bloody cool.
---
Going to try sticking around and looting the wendigos too. I usually cry and scream on the escape run because of all the bodies I didn‚Äôt get to loot back there...
---
I‚Äôve stayed back a bit too, to help new people to the event to find their way through on the escape. It can be very confusing the first couple times.  That part feels like a movie with everything collapsing around you
---
so it didn't start on the posted date, why would you expect it to end on the posted date? so
---
My bad then!
---
Would it have been too hard to have an animated Zorbo damn you and shake a fist after a wee fanfare...?
---
Happened to me today.  So frustrating!!!
---
Perfect.
---
Just add a display case full of those 'microscopes' or whatever he constantly has us fetching.
---
Came close to dying my first time down, despite doing a slow jet-pack descent and perks/mutations to prevent that sort of thing. I usually run around the map jumping off everything like a lemming on meth, so that was unexpected.
---
wait, what exactly wrong with "food builds"?
---
The production rate is abysmal.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt like pulling your weapon out of your butt??
---
I got the mirror ball today, but from a vendor bot. The one right under foundation. Next to the nuclear silo.
---
Which is odd since the game says to "check monogah mine"
---
Yeah there's a decent chance the bear at alpha is ghoulish. I don't care, bear.
---
my mustache is gone now :(
---
&gt;What you later describe is exactly  why food build is not a combat build. I eat food for my melee damage.  That doesn‚Äôt make me a food build. Food is just a necessary mechanic of  the game that a player can take advantage of. I don‚Äôt carry stimpaks and  call myself a medic, because that‚Äôs not what a medic is. Other games  call food builds other things(mule is popular in others but we use that  for alt accounts).
---
Food is not a necessary mechanic in the game anymore. It's 100% optional.
---
Also, sneak is a mechanic in the game everyone can take advantage of. Not just for very long depending on your build, yet "sneak builds" have existed since the launch.
---
&gt;Your definition would change what a food build means completely
---
As I said, words can have more than one meaning.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not sure where you were going with the loadouts things. Any build can be altered in this game with some card changes
---
Exactly. With few alterations, you are utilizing food in your build the same way you can utilize sneak or VATS.
---
&gt;You don‚Äôt equip perks that give you more food and become a food/melee/bloodied.
---
Yet that exact logic applies to sneak/vats/bloodied/commandoes.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs just a way to describe a build that isn‚Äôt made towards any specific end goal.
---
Never have I ever denied that it is used in this manner, mostly as an insult, yet it can be used more literally for other definitions.
---
Edit: grammar
---
I'm actually super sad too, I was sick yesterday so I afked on the drums with the notifications jacked up so the timers on stuff would wake me up occasionally for a good chunk of the day. I have enough flag plans and cleaver plans and the chally body to sink a battleship but no tenderizer plan or any of the plans for its mods.
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
Na na na, good vibrations.
---
[This build is for PvP](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f8487b&amp;d=sb2pg2po2ph2pp2pi2e82em1eh2ce0cu2ib4ir2a70a12s72la2l71li2lt2), but it‚Äôs good for PvE and it will do good damage to the boss in a pinch. It also lets other people do extra damage. Problem is, I ain‚Äôt noticed Earl get crippled despite putting 5000+ 5.56 into the chicken legged cunt.
---
That's the same excuse they gave for limiting player's stash. Suddenly it wasn't a problem for FO1st and junk.  Now THAT is "magic"
---
Idk what I'm going to do every hour now. Maybe I'll go outside idk.
---
Oh I forgot about this. Good news!
---
I think that one can drop from radiation rumble if you get 4/4 ore completion
---
They already have scarecrows as craftable items.  They should have a chance to scare things away
---
God I really mean this in the least dickhead way possible but isn't the payoff at the end supposed to be the items you get from the final level? When I finished it my closure moment was hanging the gameboard on the wall. I'd be down for maybe a splash screen with some celebratory audio or even a server-wide notification like events have announcing someone completed it though.
---
Perhaps this is a better way of explaining it. 
---
Take away nerd rage, serendipity, bloodied weapons and a bloodies has less potential. There‚Äôs no way to improve them more than through having those cards.
---
if we removed chems from the game a junkie would be at a direct disadvantage to other builds or took out some of the chem boosting perks and it would make junkie‚Äôs less useful.
---
If food no longer provided buffs or you took away any of the perks mentioned from a food build, they wouldn‚Äôt be any more damaged by it than any other player. Those perks don‚Äôt boost food items capabilities, it just makes them less annoying to have around. They‚Äôre QoL perks. Any build can utilize food without sacrificing any perk cards or changing their build in any way. An optimized build suggests you‚Äôre sacrificing certain stats or perks to improve others. It‚Äôs something that separates you from others. If anyone can achieve what I can with a perk set, that isn‚Äôt a build. That‚Äôs just me making use of in-game mechanics.
---
*IF* Bethesda made a set perks that allowed food to do more than it currently can, then you‚Äôd be taking about the makings of a food build in the way you‚Äôre describing it, but for now a single mutation and a series of cards that just determine longevity of a commonly occurring item or how much it weighs is just QoL/survivability, which is why we call QoL players Food builds. Not players that eat food for buffs.
---
I dont want one but i wanna play my psn is leeclan817
---
Yeah i use it on my BoS alt for those fusion cell but not on my main who's always good on 2mm EC.
---
In some cases, yes, in others not. It doesn't really look like it was intended to balance anything, it just was reworking how damage modifiers are calculated so that it's a simpler calculation which means it should in theory perform better and be easier to adjust. The end result is that builds that rely on lots of buffs like bloodied got hit the hardest. Now that they've redone the damage calculations, the real balance test will be what they do next. Hopefully before it goes live they will go and tweak damage modifiers across the board for a more balanced system.
---
Just like I believe scrip and caps are only limited because it's actually a bug and they just not have any idea how to fix it haha.
---
Yep same here.  I'm going to give it a few weeks then start dumping them on my vendor.
---
Same here
---
Run the tank killer perk. And a bloodied or junkies rifle. If running tank killer and an aa gun you'll be getting pretty sever diminishing returns
---
That‚Äôs a nice pvp build for sure! I have slightly different SPECIAL allocations due to only playing pve now. Thanks for the info bro, seriously.
---
Mandalorians use lmgs?
---
Yeah these stupid bright coloured suits, Valentine's stuff, even some of the vault stuff is too bright and gaudy. Hell, most of the wallpapers are plucked straight from Barbie dreamhouse. There needs to be a Worn version of everything
---
Another piece of equipment needs your help....
---
tank killer is 36\*%, anti armor is 50%. although nothing's stopping you from using both.
---
thank you, Daemoni73.
---
If you can make more, I‚Äôd appreciate one as well. I can make any of the mods if you want one tho. I picked up everything but the weapon from the event.
---
It is ONLY the automatic tesla that causes framerate drops. The semi auto ones seem to be fine
---
that +1 luck's really fucking useful for my perfectly preserved pie salesman character
---
Tbh with level actions I can‚Äôt tell.   I‚Äôve gone from an instigating/limb to an anti-armor/limb to a mutants/explosive.  
---
I know AA has diminishing returns and I have Tank Killer maxes.  Seems like 80% AA would still be better than 45 or 50%.  That‚Äôs why imo having limb damage is nice as I typically hip fire my lever 
---
Would like to know this as well
---
EDIT - Quad/AA/EXP or /Limb would be nice to find
---
11 days left I think, then I'm sure I read two weeks after until the next Season.
---
Do you still have it? I could use one. I can mod yours if you want.
---
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to argue with the same dude on two different comment chains about the same thing. You should present this on my reply to you.
---
Whats a food build never heard of this type of build before.
---
I would have done a mothman dance on him
---
I think even like a server announcement would be awesome. Like similar to when an event starts. Something like,   
---
SwagDaddy64 Just finished the Legendary Run!   
---
As a bonus it'd be cool if everyone in the server then got a +5 exp boost and the person who finished got a 100% exp boost for 2 hours.
---
I saw at site alpha
---
who cares? join another group. i kicked someone accidentally while i was trying to fast travel to them. maybe you're really annoying (maybe?) or sharing a card they don't want or not sharing a card or smell bad or something. It's probably Bethesda's fault anyway amirite lol?
---
Goodbye Grahm. I‚Äôll see you again when you sneak up on me and scare the shit out of me like usual.
---
Killer? I 'ardly know 'er!
---
Nothing?  So now I'm just screwed???
---
I literally cannot read the text from where I have to sit so I just don't bother with the horribly designed dumpster fire. Who the fuck designed the UI for that machine? 
---
Way too much text in too little space. Holy shit. Take a design class and re-apply for an entry-level position or something because whoever made that shouldn't be allowed to touch live assets.
---
Okay cool, gonna do some testing to see if it's worth 2 points or not
---
Is there a way to fix this?
---
YES
---
finally got a radiation emitter
---
It started on the posted date. They posted a date. Then announced it was being moved back a few days and new date were posted.
---
The event runs 6 days. The repeat coming up will run 6 days.
---
There‚Äôs no deception going on
---
It's over!? Oh man I wanted to run it at least a couple more times :( my absolute favorite event in the game.
---
Why is this triggering you so much? Are you some sort of mega-Christian or something?
---
Ty for that information, I honestly thought it worked as they were glowing wendigos.. at least the magazine does, which one is it? And placing bets it'll jump up in price or get duped to hell now lol
---
You‚Äôll be fine. Jump in there and wreck shop. I‚Äôm a bloodied mutant and had a great time.
---
Finished this morning. Couldn't be happier...that it's over.
---
I answered most of this in my other post, but to sum up. Food is optional but available to anyone. Calling yourself a food build doesn‚Äôt give you access to any combat improving perks than any other build. I can choose not to take stimpaks. That doesn‚Äôt mean other players are stim builds, they‚Äôre just being smart and using game mechanics. 
---
- Stealth has stats that increase sneaking abilities which means you can get 2x multiplier easier and work around enemies stronger than you(and there are stats to increase the dmg of stealth attacks)
---
- VATS lets you crit easier, and has perks to increase crit dmg
---
- bloodied has dozens of stat boosting perks
---
- commando has dozens of stat boosting perks
---
- your idea of a food build doesn‚Äôt boost stats. It‚Äôs just someone who eats food that is available to any build.
---
While words can have multiple meanings, once again that‚Äôs why majority dictates. Majority decided long ago what food build meant. If you don‚Äôt agree with it then you‚Äôre only causing problems as now we have situations like this where you‚Äôre debating over an agreed upon term when others already decided what food build meant.
---
I don‚Äôt need any of the perk cards you listed to get use from eating food, so there‚Äôs no food build if I‚Äôm not dependent on any cards to achieve it.
---
I wasn't even online all day today, never got that tenderizer plan. I really hope a lot of people got them and will sell them.
---
I can help if you'd like. I'll be on in about 40 mins.
---
If I was playing strictly for PvE, I‚Äôd still have a similar build. Instead of having as many Nuka Colas, I‚Äôd have three more points to put into agility, and I‚Äôd have a rank of Bandolier instead of 3 of Travelling Pharmacy. So I‚Äôd have 5 more AGI and have adrenaline. That‚Äôs assuming I use a commando build. I‚Äôd also move three out of endurance and have the sneak perk, because I won‚Äôt be downing Quantums constantly.
---
Me too just traded for a Ve25 10mmsub
---
some useless mook
---
I can help
---
don't forget to factor in your damage output as well. weapons with low single shot damage (such as heavies) benefit more from armor piercing than high single shot damage ones (bolt rifles).
---
past a certain point (based off your target's dr), armor piercing makes zero difference. you'll probably deal the same amount of damage with and without tank killer against a level 1 scorched, for example.
---
Along with that we need a join last world option for when the game crashed, not that it ever does. üôÑ
---
Solo won‚Äôt be an easy feat.  If anything, I focus on the wendigos using a stealth instigating shotgun.  Works wonders.  Use my AA/Exp Handmade on Earle.  
---
I run full health, no reliance on Bloody or Junkies too
---
Was scrollin too fast and saw the title as "hands up if you've never seen a yaoi ghoul" and my momentary thought was, "well, I guess I'm not surprised that there's an overlap in fandoms"
---
I did! Had never seen it before so I bought it. Pure luck I suppose. Also grabbed the radiation emitter by chance.
---
Ah, I missed it at the end. Thank you.
---
idm whether you reply or not but not going to repost. You‚Äôre able to read what it says just as easily where it is
---
Alright. I'll be on in about the same time. What's your gamer tag?
---
Casually slings a machine gun on your back.
---
Have at it,it's not that hard. Done it 3 times with random on public severs and we've finished with over 10 minutes left every time.
---
I ran my lower level buddy through the event last night after I set the nuke off to start it. He is new to the game, only level 20, but I figured its my nuke So I‚Äôll go show him the event. We get to the drop and there are like 6 other high level guys with us. I tell him to just jump down cuz it‚Äôs like the ds3 dlc ash heap lol. He jumps, gets downed in front of everyone,  and we both just crack up for the rest of the fight.
---
vie carry us
---
She is uh.. the "progressive" part of F76.
---
Ok thanks just wanted to make sure i didn't sandbag the team
---
The thing is, I hate PvP, most of the time I hate there are other players in the world at all because of the restrictions that creates, but I love Fallout enough that I'm trying to live with it given it will be several more years before they release another single-player game. But if you want to explain why power armor is bad I am interested. Typically I have the best non-PA I can on my character, and then when I go into nuke zones or other places the PA works better to protect me I switch. If carrying a whole suite of PA in your pocket cost more than 10 weight that would be less convenient.
---
So I don't really want a PvP build, I just would like to be able to do the daily quests that everyone else does. If the only real good way to do it is just claim a workshop, hide for 30 seconds and then FT away, then that's what I'll do from now on. 
---
Maybe "one shot kill" is technically not possible, but for certain I've been killed multiple times by players literally before I could even move to avoid a shot, and several times if it was not one shot, it was enough shots fired in less than one second.
---
Yeah, all the duplicate plans I get, I put in my vendor for 10-25 caps depending.  I just want to get rid of the weight of them.  .25 lbs each adds up fast!
---
I think certain scorch ghouls don‚Äôt even seem to be affected by anti armor.  It‚Äôs noticeable on Super Mutants though
---
Honestly I found Sneak to be easily replaced with Sneak Artist for 1 point and you never get detected haha it‚Äôs insane. You can walk around mobs and they won‚Äôt see you. How do you add a link with words to your comment? I‚Äôll send you my PVE build to see if you agree with it.
---
That sounds almost identical to another player and myself last night. Great battle...I came away with 140+ screws, lol.
---
Yah i went in there myself lev 135 and im css rifleman /heavy gunner decided to wip out my vamp minigun after a bit and throw on my pa because everyone seemd to be made for damage  ao basically stood there blasting him and occasionally turning around to make sure to hit his wendigo spawns and everyone else focused on WC
---
Ok yeah I'm full health with an IE fixer and a FE handmade so sounds comparable. Thanks
---
Alright.
---
Does just acquiring the Tenderizer from the event drop it into my loot pool or was there an actual plan for it I needed?
---
When they do the One Appalachia rebalance, it should be a higher level, but yes...   you would expect more than one.
---
Here in College Station.  Batten down the hatches, my dude
---
[Text] (link) but no spaces between the brackets.
---
But if I‚Äôm going to PvE then I‚Äôm gonna make a melee character at some point exclusively for that.
---
You're added
---
Are you ahead of the green ship? I'm not on right now so not sure where 82 would put you. I would think you're in good shape though.
---
What gun/build?
---
99% sure it‚Äôs purely for power level.   Don‚Äôt want 20 folks showing up and mowing everything down so quickly.
---
I've never compared the two before, but it is so true.
---
Okie
---
About goddamn time.
---
That's the spot.  Moved there because I was running low on steel and copper.  Its one of the best spots in the game.  Has a great view for watching Monogah mine getting nuked.
---
I'm usually at a spot with a steel resource node between ATLAS and Monogah mine, but its getting a little too spicy there with both Monogah Mine and ATLAS becoming nuke targets.  Had great views of seneca rock too.
---
They seriously didnt extend at all for console? Lame.
---
You know, playing the game some times I think, "How could the Raiders actually be such selfish assholes?" and then I remember you guys :P
---
I was on a trip for most of the double score weekend so I wasn‚Äôt able to use that to it‚Äôs full advantage. I think I‚Äôll be good with these double challenges but I was just wondering if I would be able to make it all the way through.
---
YTers have reported that category is going away see InnovSurvivalist... sorry to be the bearer of bad news üôÑ
---
fuck me the beeping drives me nuts, and the only way to SHUT IT UP is to take the thing.
---
Some dev be trollin' no fucks given.
---
In my non CSS fella, I can remain in caution with a non silenced weapon. It's a little weird. 
---
If you can keep enough distance and vats its middle head (weak spot) you should do OK and be able to remain in stealth.
---
Yeah that was my first thought: they're trying to make it harder for bloodied. Poison damage is the bane of bloodied power armour users, spin up guns especially. You can't stimpak until your minigun has stopped spinning. That's killed me so many times
---
Sounds good. I have an amazing Junkies Heavy for PvE as well, super tanky. Could be PvP I guess but not fond of it.
---
Weird gram didn‚Äôt vanish for me. He and chally walked away while he talked about how they walk together
---
All I wanted was that jar of fireflies. I'm not even close.
---
Bethesda need to realise they ARE burning people out and pissing others off.
---
The suggestions of focusing on Weeklies is a smart one. Helps people who are dedicated, longtime Fallout players but have jobs/kids and other things IRL too. They shouldn't be locked out...they may have a whole day a week they can hard game, but all the Dailies don't help them...
---
I'd like to see another way of catching up added too. A co-operative event or challenge you can do in a group or dedicated servers folk can follow an option to travel to where others are specifically there to run these challenges.
---
Nothing like a grown man making threats of a$$ rape over the internet. Some people's kids man...
---
The flamer isn't bugged? At least it didn't work on the creatures on project paradise, which is sad because I run with that perk 100% of the time (friendly fire) but I run with only a shish, waiting for that 90% weight flamer, hell I'm even stocking up on fuel.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve gone back to user my Fixer over a Lever Action.  Still looking for a Quad/AA or Quad/Explosive
---
It‚Äôll be a close one
---
Yes heaven forbid, those of us who enjoyed all the previous Fallout games would have preferred this not to be a multi-player game at all, but would settle just for having an option to not participate in PvP without actually having the gameplay experience suffer.
---
You don't like an open mic and chewing noises ... LOL ..
---
Liberty Prime wants YOU to fight again fascism
---
You're right. It's totally my fault glitches exists and it should be my job to work around them and not the developers to fix them. Silly me.  
---
The clock in the pip boy is good to know, I'll be sure to look for it. Though it's still weird to play an mmo that doesn't have one for the basic hud.
---
Ah. I was not aware of this.
---
I like to PvP. Much more opportunities now the toxic pricks are picking on low levels since it‚Äôs on GamePass.
---
Two to three?  How much xp do you grind, geez.
---
I know you're a reasonable person, and I claimed no deception. Weekly events in FO76 typically start at 12:00pm EST on Tuesdays and end at approximately the same day and time. When the start of Meat Week was moved from Tuesday to Thursday, it's not much of a stretch to presume the end date would be moved correspondingly. I'm just disappointed because I had planned to put in several hours this evening.
---
That's not nearly as goofy as running with the camera out. It somehow feels as if you run twice as fast while wearing high heels.
---
Poison resistance armor pieces help.
---
So what doesn't happen?  Do you not end up in an instance with an earl to kill?
---
It's gonna slow down in the 90s (although the extra challenges will help). You should really pump up your INT and/XP buffs. Use public teams to your advantage. Even be the leader that way you have more control and you're able to change your team's goal from intelligence to event as soon as an event is about to end and then switch it back to intelligence to continue getting the general XP buff across everything you do
---
Also true.
---
I play on a controller so I don't see your point here.
---
There's no need to take premature actions bruh
---
Earl was there, no other players were. Even though I checked the map and counted 12 other people at the event I was still put in a solo instance
---
I got the Tenderizer plan on the last event... on XBox if anyone needs one.  Also have all mods.  Where do you get the legendary ones? Mr Joker21
---
He regens health just like any other Legendary at around the 50% mark. Once.
---
Well not this time. Honestly 6 days is enough for these events. By day 5, half the people at them armed AFK farming the event. 
---
So I‚Äôm actually find with this.
---
Saddest image ever ahaha
---
got stuck in 3 man group, where I was the strongest player (Never a good sign), then another nuke dropped as we failed that attempt, jumped in and got a solo queue.
---
my disappointment is measurable. especially since now I'm down 3 thousand rounds of ammo and 30 stimpacks.
---
I have a the plan
---
Lol, depends if I'm hungry. I should have been more specific. By background noise I meant someone playing game sound through their speakers with an open mic.
---
why not have a fusion generator?
---
That's a compliment. LOL
---
Ur the one thats wrong here my friend.   If u die after Earl is dead u respawn outside the mine.  
---
If u die anytime within the timer u don‚Äôt lose any junk.   Only if u die after event timer is finished like normal.
---
This is only true of weapons and armor added to the game after Wild Appalachia. All the base weapons and armor are already in the legendary drop list regardless if you know the plan or not.
---
Sure, it's just a way of shooting back. A little inconvenience and annoyance.
---
Stealth pvp against people who don't want it and can't fight back is not very sporting, but the rules of the game allow it, so fair enough. The game also allows dropping a nuke on someone though.
---
Just adding something others didn't mention. Just to show how much the effect loses potency when you keep adding it (AA effects are multiplicative not additive). And also, i would personally go with the Fixer.
---
Anti-Armor (50%) + Tank Killer (36%) = 68% armor penetration / ignore
---
Anti-Armor + Tank Killer + Piercing magazine (20%) = 74.4%
---
Anti-Armor + Tank Killer + Perforating magazine (40%) = 80.8%
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Weapon and effects are listed in post. I'm a heavy build.
---
Yes, they want you to feel like you were running the game in one of the terminals
---
Bro me too! 
---
My advice. Blast earl early and then let the big boys take care of him while you revive them and addstomp. It's oodles of fun. Are you on ps4?
---
Wanna bet it ends up being a BoS skin?
---
Does it work with the plasma thrower?
---
At least you can see them coming, Assaultrons on the other hand, make me cry every time.
---
TIL what the hell a ‚Äúfood build‚Äù is, and that apparently I am one.
---
Hahaha America is in need of a Liberty Prime.... or 2
---
&gt;your idea of a food build doesn‚Äôt boost stats. It‚Äôs just someone who eats food that is available to any build.
---
My idea for a food build is to make food a sustainable part of damage for your build with specific food items that boost your damage, most cases melee. That requires perk investment just like any other stat boosting perks.
---
What you are describing is a person who cooks the random food he scavenges and eats it.
---
&gt;While words can have multiple meanings, once again that‚Äôs why majority dictates.
---
Yet the other meanings still exist.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt need any of the perk cards  you listed to get use from eating food, so there‚Äôs no food build if I‚Äôm  not dependent on any cards to achieve it.
---
I don't need any perks to VATS or sneak either. But if I want my build to be optimized, in this case make food buffs sustainable, I get the relevant perks.
---
If you don‚Äôt make it just dump atoms in the last few levels. You‚Äôll get 500 atoms at rank 100.
---
Man can't they do anything right without even the simplest additions having dozens of game crippling bugs?
---
like everything new I've seen of late is packed with bugs, just a matter if you get lucky for them to not completely break your experience.
---
Fallout 76‚Äôs Shakespeare
---
aside from the fact that the SCORE system is exp and therefore INT  based, the only reason any of them are useful is for herd mentality and fast traveling
---
From what I've heard, nothing.
---
I don‚Äôt think two to three ranks a day is that much. During the last few hours of double score I was able to get double that in half the time.
---
Not gonna lie, but the grind in Legendary Run is real.  Hopefully the jar will be made available in another way.
---
I‚Äôm four spaces behind him
---
I am: wood_bot
---
I have that Crushing Blow instigating and limb damage launcher and its fun to pop it into enemy groups and cripple them up. Then I clean house with my handmade.
---
Earle is tougher
---
Even the ammo maker produces very little .308.
---
He has 90% reduced damage.
---
The dailies only give 3000 right now, normally 2500.  So that's like 6000 score from xp which is 600,000 xp.
---
I am: egroegy
---
"Egg" in game. Good to meet you Wood [?].
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done a bit of research on the intelligence/xp ratio and while higher intelligence DOES increase your gained xp, it‚Äôs not enough to make any significant impacts. Not like it was in Fallout 4
---
well and proper, yes.
---
Earle has a flat damage reduction effect. similar the Queen, except it's even stronger.
---
sneak multipliers also don't trigger if your target is in combat with something else, like players or even other mobs.
---
The question wasn't "what happens if you die in the mine". The question, if you actually read the post, was "what happens if you don't get out on time" and this goob said you die, which you don't.  You just teleport out. Teleporting out and dying aren't the same thing. My friend.
---
It‚Äôs less meat week and more meat few days
---
Dude he's not a friendly guy that's for sure
---
you better pray to Chally that you get all the extra points this week.
---
U on pc? U can have one?
---
I don't think the trade took that long, felt like 2 minutes but maybe yea
---
Chally, what you think of this meat cook? What you mean meat week over? It not have been week yet!
---
You‚Äôll be fine. I did it as a hybrid stealth commando/stealth sniper build, and did just fine plinking Earle, burning down Wendigo adds, and rezzing a few overly brave people. 
---
I did die once, because it was my first time doing the event and I was distracted looking around and taking it in and didn‚Äôt watch my health. Earle took a moment to use me as toilet paper and then tossed me into a wall.
---
Yeah every time I get enough atoms to buy a rank I do.
---
Tbh I'm glad it's over, one of the meat week event spawns was right next to my camp at the monorail where you get Swan's ugly cousin and even without playing the drums, the event would start on its own and my base kept getting completely destroyed even though I didn't wanna participate anymore, or cuz some noobs would come to the event and used my base for cover  üôÑ (lvl 213 on Xbox) I couldn't sit at my camp for longer than 5 min without 10 lvl 75 prime rad scorps or fog crawlers just wrecking the place. It was nice for XP cuz I could kill them pretty easy, but it ended up getting really annoying as I lost an absolute metric fuck ton of junk as a result. (And to anyone who says it's my fault, or I shoulda moved my camp I say gfys ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
---
Considering i didnt do beckett's questline yet and am at lvl 133, i'm gonna have to have a word with this final word
---
all heavy gunner perks, stabilized (in int). batteries included and power user also help a lot.
---
ideally you'll want to be bloodied as well, since you'll be virtually invincible anyway.
---
also make sure you don't have the grounded mutation.
---
Yeah well Chally disappeared a day early
---
Worked for me THANK YOU!!!
---
Meanwhile I bought the clean one just to stand out amongst the unwashed masses...
---
ultracite laser *rifles* have a lower base damage and higher rate of fire.
---
ultracite *gatling* lasers are just flat out better than regular ones, I believe.
---
No he regened to full hp before the legendary regen, so I had to start all over üò≠
---
The real question is why have they not added it yet?
---
What is a food build even
---
having an opinion you dont agree with isnt trying too hard lol
---
[Close enough.](https://external-preview.redd.it/IbT-SyfVRFz7z0AT7ncuLQkvXGL5i0zDaVFlFji115M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f89ec74a46a5fb11f6b354ca7cc6166842d7c4f8)
---
A droll visit from an awarding Mr. Handy would be fun.  
---
Just hands you a slip of paper that says congratulations, and leaves.
---
Yeah i checked earlier if i had it unlocked, and i do somehow so. Saves me the trouble of getting the plans. Now i gotta use all that saved up flux and nuke zone mats i havent had a need for!
---
Fingers crossed
---
I‚Äôm in same boat...full SS set works prob best.  But I still rock the Chinese stealth suit in high rad areas.
---
I was there for the very last event and didn't know it was the last day of Meat Week. I thought for a moment my game was bugged or that I was about to crash.
---
I got all of Graham's vendor recipes though. That radiation emitter will be put to good use in my camp... :)
---
Same :(
---
Is it an MG42 though?
---
Disassembled for scrap metal or scrip. Oh you mean Roll? Bloodied or two shot probably. But honestly you are better off with any weapon that isn't explosive right now. If they every buff explosive weapons, I've got a bloodied auto grenade launcher sitting on the wall in my armory.
---
Are you surprised that Grahm had difficulty counting the days out correctly?
---
&gt; My dumbass spent Atom buying the Chally "Clean" outfit, not knowing there was a free dirty version that drops during the event.
---
That's not all bad. The atom one is craftable and the free one isn't. So if you ever lose your free dirty outfit, it's gone forever. If you lose the clean one you can just craft another one.  
---
Likewise it doesn't take up any stash space (since you can craft one any time you want), unlike the free one which you have to store forever.
---
Doesn't matter, Grahm won't remember the lesson he learned (the hard way) by the time the next Meat Week rolls around. His mind is too shot to focus on anything but meat, trade and green stuff for Chally.
---
Thanks for the tip- my camp is down there so I went by. No mirror ball but 3 electric chair plans which was new to me. I'll keep trolling all the vendors in Whitesprings- I had to visit there many times to get Signs and Letters.
---
I wasn't getting killed that much but I'll try it anyway. I have a few VFFR handmades somewhere around here.
---
I think one might be +250DR while reloading which should keep me alive as long as I have ammo.
---
You should have saved those atoms. Rank 80+ is much more worth it since they take a lot more score to level then ranks at the start. 
---
I saved all my atoms I got Incase I need a boost at the end ranks but I managed to get to 100 a couple weeks ago.
---
Yeah, I thought get said it went to the 26th?
---
I‚Äôll be home and able to go online in about an hour or so if you want a hookup. IGN Tazier
---
Just need two points switched into intellect, and... Seven more levels worth of points all in all to max out the perk for crafting prime
---
Right so in your case button mash to victory.  Point is it's a no skill weapon.  
---
But if you like it go crazy you don't need my approval play however you want.  I don't use them and I think they are stupid.  Personal opinion
---
What does meat Sweats even do?
---
If halloween candy is the reason you're using thru-hiker, you have issues :)
---
You have to use the fireworks lunchbox* bonus, duh
---
^^* ^^lunchbox ^^not ^^included
---
Ok. But what dude said isn‚Äôt 100% false.  Just the death part.
---
trapper has the highest rr out of all armor types except SS. but neither can be shadowed. then robot, and marine. robot can be shadowed *and* has muffled arms. there's also the leaded backpack.
---
but it won't make much of a difference in radiation rumble and definitely won't make a difference inside a nuke. you need a hazmat/CSS or PA for those.
---
"People who don't want it and can't fight back"
---
LOL if you don't want it don't step into a workshop zone.
---
Ward. By a landslide. 
---
Preston doesn‚Äôt talk shit about you unless you actually did something to deserve it. 
---
Preston doesn‚Äôt send you out to kill someone that took one of twenty osmosis kits and lies to you about how important it is. 
---
Preston is annoying, but at least he‚Äôs sending you out to help people. Not to cover up for his incompetence.
---
From using melee forever... Since atom's judgment in fo4... I might want to cheese mobs for a bit with it, tbh lol
---
I tend to use T-60 and diluted Rad-X.
---
I dont think you understand why i originally said what I did lol
---
Numbers? What do they mean Mason? Sorry I‚Äôm not a maths person.
---
I think the best theory I can come up with is that the people who use it have small peckahs.
---
Why dies my tse flamer not heal? Is it somehow coded that only an actual flame will heal?
---
15k feft for the double challenge(3k a day), Then 7 days at 2500 a day, you will then have 1 week left in there being this upcoming tuesday. I am also assuming that you are farming XP like a mad person to catch up. Really from challenges I see only 14.5 so you would need about   
---
13850 more score so 1,385,000 xp. I guess if you can fast farm bog server hop and get line in the sand a lot (glitched version) If you are maxed out xp/int food and using the glitch unyielding (for the int) you could get if no one else is there roughly 100,000k xp per 11 minutes. With lunchboxes on I managed 1800 score from one but that was my son standing there being a body and me killing them all. 
---
If you have some Atoms saved up say 3 days worth use that on the final day if needed and you will get them right back as you get 500 atoms for finishing the board. Would save you a massive xp grind
---
Im new. Im mean, im level 51, but ive never launched a nuke. What the hell is and ft and an sbq
---
And do not forget the screws
---
No, you need to learn the plan for it to be added to your loot pool.
---
That‚Äôs aswell!
---
Yeah, that had crossed my mind too. I have seven more levels of saving up points, so in the meantime i'll keep doing my daily west tek rituals
---
That‚Äôs maddening. I lose out on so many Legendaries because of bodies magically disappearing, but how can they roll you back constantly without addressing and fixing it? That, and their response, is enough to make me stop playing
---
Not just the problem that they can't contribute enough, but they're doing it at a detriment to themselves because they're eating up their ammo and consumables they need.
---
There is a world event notification [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/371/)
---
No reason to keep the game installed without Nuclear Winter.
---
Once you learn that plan, you can get a legendary Tenderizer for rewards in any mission or drops from any legendary creature, as well as from the legendary vendor.  I'm waiting for the sale for legendary stuff and going to try to buy one then.
---
Yes, just look up PA spawn locations
---
He works as a merchant, and does well enough to have 1400 caps on him, I figured he had decent handle on numbers.
---
Damn on ps4 had 0 luck whatsoever at player vendors
---
Bashing major effect is indeed one of the "magic" or bugged effects and they tend to work great with fast firing weapons like ultracite gatling lasers. I personally have not had the magic effects work on CP. Tried 3 different ones on my private server. If you had 10minutes to spare then i doubt it worked for you either. Weapons with these "magic" effects are usually waaaaaaay faster than that.
---
I was messing what that last night. Didn‚Äôt notice a difference. In fact used an aa limb damage reload speed and a vampires limb reload speed. Both combat rifles and nothing.  Only thing was I stayed alive a little long with the vampires of course.
---
Yes + bashing is a magic gun. How many cores did you burn 12?
---
Don't spend you atoms until the last day. Grind as much as possible, then spend the atoms if necessary.
---
It's one of the cryptid tales ones that does extra damage on wendigos. It was tested to work on the collosus a while back.
---
The open mic people really remind me of ye olden days when push to talk was our dream.
---
I had, in no particular order:
---
a dude yelling at his wife that he needs to own some pubbies before lunch 
---
some broad getting angry at her dog for shitting on the floor
---
YMCA on endless repeat
---
a woman singing along to Ring of Fire. She had absolutely no talent and got into an argument when someone else from my team complained about her voice turning the milk sour
---
someone listening to one of the Harry Potter audiobooks. I think it was the 3rd one.
---
a bloke yelling at his room mate to stop fucking the damned screamer cause he can't hear shit over the headset
---
and finally, my personal favorite, 2 people arguing about Game of Thrones, season 8. For 2 hours.
---
That was all this week. I love team chat. :)
---
Well, looks like I'll be spending some caps for a chally costume
---
Ya I used to play mainly melee a long time ago until I tried out some ranged weapons.
---
In the end I went with heavy weapons abandoning my melee build and switching my stats around once I got the feel of it.
---
What does this have to do with fallout 76?
---
With the damage squash incoming has anyone tested on the PTS to see if they changed to additive?
---
Level 51, and i still dont know what tresure notes do.
---
I did that quest tho
---
Didn‚Äôt they patch that?
---
Yeah, just the once though. At the junkyard behind Charleston.
---
It was my mate who spotted it. We were standing on the cliff above, so he couldn't slap us into next week, like they do... üòÑ
---
I have the pictures in my enormous FO76 picture folder.
---
Yup i have only one in my camp tho lol
---
I hate to admit it but I am a cheap bastard and love to screw Todd out of a couple of caps here and there and do use the free fast travel üòÅ
---
It's not guaranteed but if you switch the server often enough you should find a new frame
---
Chally is still in the Wasteland, my dude.
---
I carry 500+ for this reason.
---
lol it is. It becomes weightless so I can carry 30,000 of it and use it to replace all other food items, and it gives 0.1 rads each so I use it to trim my rads/health too.
---
I do also carry a lot of nukas so I guess it's really for both of them.
---
Get in your PA and hold fast!!!
---
Hard to loot the wendigos for them after the fight though. You might say that we're getting....screwed.
---
Big yup. But with the glitching going on ppl get snooty if you have more than one in your camp
---
I only kick people if they don't share a perk. 3 points in charisma is not the same as sacrificing your first born to pagan gods, for crying out loud.
---
The exception to that rule are really low levels.
---
I saw a post about this and people claimed they are still multiplicative as they are not damage multipliers, but armor penetrations. Making AA effects slightly better than they used to be when compared to anything else in PTS. Have to remember though that it is PTS, anything can change.
---
I still hate Preston tho.
---
What could they add?
---
Get a medics version and bomb your friends for heals?
---
Instigating would be the best though fire it and hot swap for a quick clean up.
---
Sorry what's a food build? Lol
---
Take a pyschobuff for giggles and watch what happens when you get to 20 percent health
---

Reference this and you can turn the menu music off.
---
With any other company? It would probably be a lengthy process, but it would most likely get given back to you and items restored.
---
But this is bethesda here. I doubt they‚Äôll get your account back to you and even if they do, they won‚Äôt be restoring any items stolen from the account
---
Take my damn upvote :/
---
Power Armor can spawn in specific locations, and will do so regulary on a server.
---
Tip: Check out Watoga, since there are 3 Power Armor spawns (Hospital Roof, Transit hub (behind a locked door) and one in the middle by a crashed vertibird. Be warned though, the citizens of the city may attack you.
---
I saw him near a workshop just a few minutes ago. He is not gone.
---
Ahh, sadness. Thank you.
---
A visual indicator or something on the pipboy. They stuffed them in hard to see places and the cowbell was the only way to find them
---
Chain x 10^76th would like a word.
---
A lot of the challenges require you to, otherwise a lot of people probably wouldn't. 
---
I take workshops anyway because some of the defense events spawn multiple legendaries. Once in a while someone comes by to take a shot at me, but whatever. Even if they get me, I don't lose anything I can't get back in a few minutes.
---
If you want to pvp, go ahead. I just might nuke you, that's all. We'll both be fine.
---
Shot just showed up and it was gone lol thought it was tomorrow dang wanted to get a few more in.
---
Well, you shouldn't say words of wisdom on reddit. It will get you downvoted.
---
Pretty obvious when its game optimization fault, and people never realized it and always blame the game for all performance issues. Truth to be told, playing on SSD and since Wastelanders FPS was very stable for me.
---
Its total mystery that to play games you need a good hardware. Mindblowing.
---
Not a food build IMO. Food build is specific to people using excessive carry weight perks, specifically the one in Agility because there are so many powerful agility perks. You‚Äôve just got a build. Might not be meta, but this game isn‚Äôt hard enough to require meta gaming so rock on.
---
Garvey had comedic timing, ward does not
---
"We need to go raid the institute before it's too late...but first, I have a settlement for you to help out"
---
You'll still probably be more help than the lvl 50s that show up
---
I would like a Rawrzilla
---
We have some bonus score stuff coming up.  You‚Äôll be close I think.  Save atoms for the next to last day. You get 500 for completing it.  If you have incomplete free atom challenges work those into your xp routines.  Except maybe robot killing those take forever.
---
Good luck avoiding autocompletion bugs!
---
I want a hacked sentry bot. And I want to change its settings to "Loyal as a puppy".
---
Unlucky or maybe a stealth troll
---
When Double XP Weekend is 4 days long nobody panics, because it's all a part of the plan.
---
Remove one little day from Meat Week, well then everyone loses their mind!
---
They did when i thought about it but youd think itd at least be live today til midnight
---
Not really pal, from my experience if you die during the collapse you just miss the chest nearside the entrance. It doesn't affect rewards
---
Yeah its either lag or being forced into debris from Earls scream.
---
Dang looks like I‚Äôm finally quitting
---
Its nice to finally use a use for stimpacks again. I have an alt with 500 regular ones stockpiled just in case. Everytime Earle runs me into a hazard I just spam the stimpack button 3 or 4 times to make sure it registers due to the lag. Making a pretty good dent in my stockpile in just a handful of fights so far.
---
Shit I missed it. Guess i‚Äôll wait for everything to reduce in value and pick it up. Heard there‚Äôs a Tenderizer plan now?!
---
When the shit hits the fan IRL, I will totally BBQ with Graham.  He's a cool cat.
---
~laughs in cannibal~
---
Don't worry Grahm will be back on Sept 22-28.
---
We‚Äôve got your back!
---
The Deathclaws are too few, lore wise they're pack animals so they need to up the number that spawn together.
---
I‚Äôve been able to run in nuke zones with a full set of ss, lead lined backpack and a radshield. It puts my rad resistance to almost 700. Still need to take diluted radaways, but you need to do that anyway.
---
Just don't ever have Beckett if you want a camp in the Ash heap. He will complain *all* the time about how it sucks and why no one in their right mind would want to live there.
---
I was under the impression that it requireda fire rate of over 200 initially. Having tried multiple weapons in CP this one had performed unusually well and while I've seen some magic weapons and have some as well,  I've never had them perform quite as well as some others seem to against the SBQ.
---
&gt; Therefore, Teslas + shitload of enemies + unlootable ash piles=insane lag and frame rate drops.
---
Well, that explains what happened at Line in The Sand yesterday.
---
Nocturnal is already one of the best buffs, it's on par with junkie's in the middle of the night. Its only issue is that the buff isn't good enough to justify the damage decrease in the day, especially when compared to junkie's (same bonus 24/7 with effectively no downside) or bloodied (demigod lol). Fully agree though, they nerfed most of the worst offenders, now it's time to buff what really needs it. Hoping that's on the radar for upcoming patches this year
---
Two shot is the best.
---
No, it doesn't. The perk only checks for the normal flamer and kebab. Missed opportunity to make a flaming chainsaw medic build :(
---
Yes they tend to work better with firerate 200 and over. But there are other variables also. Like yours latency etc. Angryturtle has made a new/updated (i think 2 months ago) video about the effects and goes little deeper on the subject.
---
I see dead Ward, I upvote. Simple.
---
Blackwater Mine (topside, in one of the garages) is a PA spawn point.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Should‚Äôve been there from the start, ya know, but still awesome!
---
Me too man, he started to talk more about how he met Chally and how they became inseparable. I bought like 10 plans out of him before he left, what a lad, I will never kill another Super Mutant for fun ever again
---
The hive-mind says no...
---
Must be nice to have FO1st and 72,000 steel LMAO
---
I have a sweet vampires gatling laser that is my go to for this event.  It is a life saver.
---
I constantly had the events bug out and fail on me because shit wouldn't spawn. 
---
Good riddance to this buggy piece of shit event that caused no end of issues on multiple servers I was on.
---
I agree, just finished it myself &amp; was thinking exactly the same thing. Very lame.  Not in the least bit surprised though:P
---
Yup, seems to be rare even compared to the percentages.  I got it once in 72 attempts. I've seen someone say they got it 2 times in about 30.  It's seemingly rare to get.  And yeah, if you learn the plan it adds it to your potential legendary drops and rewards.
---
I‚Äôve run it probably a dozen times now. Usually bloodied sneak commando, but sneaking is difficult in there. Not impossible, but it takes some doing. I‚Äôd say overall, the Queen fights are more difficult unless someone is melting her with a magic weapon. You should be fine.
---
The treasure hunter quest is over.  It wouldn't be on the test server.
---
Give me all the food
---
I mean I usually see them coming, but can I do anything about it before they hit me? No not really. That's assuming they bother to get close instead of using the "bloodied killer 9000" aka their face beam.
---
Floor decore
---
Floor decor beside the sitting and standing gorillas oddly enough.
---
When you level up enough it'll start coming out of your characters nose and ears as well.
---
Yes, from September 22 forward. And it's a reward for the Glass delivery of PROJECT: Bravo which is beginning tomorrow and not for the last one.
---
The arching between close by enemies is difficult to justify, certainly considering the way that it is implented - arching back off the ground is the most ludicrous bit....
---
Just stick to "the leade of the pack" and you'll be OK!
---
I got all the rewards from it already and I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep doing it or go back to the SBQ lol
---
Kill stuff, loot stuff, sell stuff in C.A.M.P. at your vendor.  
---
Mostly sought after things:   
---
\- Stable X Flux (the thing you get from the SBQ or ACP)  
---
\- Ammo (.45, .556, .308, .50, Plasma, Cores)  
---
\- "useless" legendary items for script  
---
\- good legendary items (duh!)  
---
\- screws, lead, adhesive, every junk remotely rare
---
Guess it‚Äôll be something to work towards when I return to the game, took a break after the legendary run, will prob be back for season 2. 
---
And a legendary tenderizer would be so cool to have, guess reduce damage output prefix would be fitting üòÇ (think that prefix is available on melee weapons)
---
Nah, there are a lot of SMs I enjoy watching explode into body parts.  But anytime I hear Grahm in the wild or see a Brahmin, it fills my heart with a little joy.
---
But if it did base damage during the day and did bloodied leveled damage during the night, it would be worth it. But the way it wanes makes it not worth the trouble
---
I see thanks , I might skip the bloodied suggestion since I'm more casual but I do like the power armor perks suggestion didn't realize these assisted
---
I thought that too, but with Super Duper, you get 2 ultracite cores per normal core sometimes. The violet flux is a minor grind, but it's the main plant down by Scorched Earth. I made about 40 a month ago (got 52 with duper), and haven't run out yet.
---
Somewhat rare but if you server hop enough you can find them. I finished my Graham-exclusive plan hunt this week thanks to this
---
2% higher Exp. per point of Int.
---
For minor rads,  rad shield is your friend but for pure nuke zone or the extreme rads in the radiation rumble tunnels theres bot much you can do beside haz suit  stealth armor or power armor  because even if you get your rad resist numbers to match those there is some kinda secret rad resist to those types of suits
---
Building up suspense I guess.
---
Yeah, I usually solo them in about 8-10, but that's geared up. At level 15, you can't pick the locks to skip portions of the silo.
---
lol just wait afew months and bethesda will do another cook off
---
I‚Äôve avoided it so far so I‚Äôm not too worried
---
Same here! It definitely helps with the snack bar I have set up next to the pond right near the event spot. Probably get less traffic now that it's over, but I don't care. I do it for me.
---
Food is sustainable without those perks. you can eat all easily and they last much longer than items such as chems so the need to replenish is far less. players even have camp fridges they could buy if they wanted to. None of the things you‚Äôre suggesting require any of those perks. That‚Äôs why a food build in your terms doesn‚Äôt exist. Because, in your own words, a person can cook all these random food items and eat them. And they get the same boost. Just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard‚Äù to get food doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve made a brand new build. I can get the same boosts and still tack on multiple dmg boosting perks through *actual builds*. 
---
‚ÄúYet the other meanings exist.‚Äù Not a valid point. Flat earthers still argue the earth is flat, doesn‚Äôt make their argument valid. Ignoring an entire discussion and saying, ‚Äúbut I still think this way‚Äù is like seeing a groundhog and calling it a squirrel. Your opinion on what it should be called means squat when the majority agrees you‚Äôre wrong.
---
If you want a VATS or sneak build you do need specific perks. look up what a sneak and vats build are.
---
Both use multiple perks that are necessary to achieve a certain end. Sneak perks increase stats through stealth/maneuvering where other builds can‚Äôt, and can achieve higher dmg sneak attacks. There are actual higher dmg multipliers. VATS has crit meter increases, higher crit dmg, and other crit skills like the lone wanderer. They achieve something that an opposing build cannot. 
---
You don‚Äôt know the mechanics of other core builds, so I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any point in discussing this further. You shouldn‚Äôt be arguing for the definition of other builds when you don‚Äôt know the mechanics of the existing ones.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing, if you want to prove you‚Äôre right, where are the food builds at? Why does no one talk about the power of a food build? In order to prove a food build is real you‚Äôve listed off just about every build that exists, yet most ppl clearly don‚Äôt know or think this food build exists. It‚Äôs just a umbrella term for QoL. Why are we talking about every build but yours daily? you‚Äôre making up something that isn‚Äôt real and suggesting you‚Äôve found a mechanic that every player uses easily. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre having so a hard time keeping dmg items from spoiling, but the rest of us have done fine without our food from running out. 
---
*apologies for any aggressive tone. it‚Äôs nothing personal, just my debate style*
---
Electricity would also like a word. So would the late mr tesla now that i think of it.
---
Let's take those suckers outta the game. I am sick of the word chain lol
---
Never tell me the odds....
---
Nice hat trick!
---
There‚Äôs a chest?! I‚Äôve missed it every time
---
Simply make sure to log into the game 15 or 20 minutes past the reset time and log into the normal mode first and not nuclear winter. It's the best thing you can do right now.
---
I still have the glitch. Can't proceed at all.
---
I got fed up with it, purchased some points through the psn store, and just paid it out. Granted, I like a grind like any other, but the endless repetition of it all not only became boring, but it was just.....a huge let down.
---
No, that barrel works like a radiation emitter. No banging the drum, just radiation creeping up on you.
---
They said it was being tested again with new adjustments starting today on the PTS. The event itself is obviously long over.
---
This. I was ready to start selling mine until I met Earl.
---
As a tank/medic responder main I'm always either face tanking the badies, healing the team or reviving anyone that goes down. Doesn't matter if I'm the one tanking the Imposter Sheepsquatch or Earle; if you go down I'm heading your way immediately.
---
If we meet the final ATLAS goal we get another week of it
---
Like I said not that much. I already have pretty high intelligence though and it‚Äôs boosted with a few perks and mutations.
---
You can probably still make it if you grind out using INT boosts and cranberry relish with the herbivore mutation, if not you‚Äôd probably only need to buy a few levels which are basically free since the event gives you free atoms
---
That happens if you die during the fight and are by yourself and respawn and run back. Happens during queen as well.
---
It's full of caps and junk, nothing valuable enough to cry for it
---
Yes. But still the lesser of two evils.
---
Well, to be only 4 weeks in I'd say if you keep going at the rate you are, you'll probably make it. In case you end up at lv 90 or after during the last day of the season and really want the remaining rewards, just know that the score board gave out enough atoms to buy the remaining spots and come out even.
---
Well arcing could happen - that electricity is just trying to find the path of least resistance to a ground....I guess if something was in mid air then lightning passing through it on the way to the ground and then onto other stuff on the way is entirely plausible......not when all the parties are stood on the ground though
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied stealth build and I have a bloodied fixer the prefixes are 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage I have all secret service unyielding armor and stealth maxed out. I can get around 22 a bit without adrenaline hitting. But I can get over 100 on most hits after. I hit for 88 out of vats. Forgot to mention the first couple numbers is in vats but seems I do more damage out of vats and just hitting him regular
---
Ahh thank you for that. Still nice to know about, but at least I didn‚Äôt miss out on something rare üëçüèºü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Instigating imo.
---
its been noted
---
No, i watched it happen to my fiancee who didnt do anything at all.
---
whats that stuff selling for since the event ended?
---
You got 100 levels of rewards and still cry about not getting a pat on the back and fanfare for finishing? People really will complain about anything.
---
Yup it took me ten minutes to find last night
---
I think that's what I did...  Crap.  Thanks for the info.
---
As an answer to the question posed, it was NOT CORRECT üòÇüòÇüòÇ what kind of school did you go to?? lmao whatever dude
---
I'll never see it because the grind has pretty much killed any desire I have to even load the game anymore and I'm way behind.
---
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that.
---
grahm was being a tight wad he didnt give me crap except the stupid outfit and backpack skin
---
Noted what?
---
Just need the other two cursed weapons, the mask and the plushie and I‚Äôll be done with rewards.
---
Yes. I got the tenderizer and tato salad plans and I‚Äôm also on pc. I only got one of each of those and a few dupes of the mods for the tenderizer. I wasn‚Äôt very aware of how many runs I did. But I think it was around 80 or so based on how many treasury notes I now have. The rest of the numbers you listed seem consistent with how many I have of each plan also.
---
My rng was bad have a ton of everything except the tenderizer plan. Taking a break from fallout today cuz meat week ended and finished legendary run , tomorrow gonna just vendor search for a plan. Pretty sure they're all 15000 or trade only
---
Stop posting on reddit and start grinding bruh
---
What‚Äôs a food build?  It‚Äôs pretty self explanatory but I‚Äôm not familiar with it
---
You have to bash using the flamer... It's really dumb but actually using the fire doesn't work, even though that's the icon for the perk lmao üòÖ
---
I have yet to run it in PA and I‚Äôm a bloody build almost level 200. Mainly heavy guns though, but I‚Äôve seen stealth commandos in there as well around mid 100s and there just fine. Have at it I say ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
The event is coming back in Sept. Just keep an eye out for it then.
---
*chortles in cannibal*
---
I think I actually have a (known) Tato Salad plan, so I must have either received two, or had one from the last Meat Week. The only think I didn't get was anything Tenderizer
---
You can do it. I have done it four times and finished it four times. I use my bloodied fixer with all unyielding secret service armor except one leg is chameleon marine armor. I can wreck him with it
---
If I were Maggie, I'd definitely take an elevator and tell Penny how I feel about her family's criminal actions personally, rather than just send someone else nuke the final resting place of my father and then not even go there in person.
---
I tired to raise this point in the PTS before the event went live, but it was probably too much to code a more interactive quest just a month before the whole thing was supposed to ship to live servers. Still, IMO Maggie should have been in the instanced environment of Foundation from the start.
---
The only framerate drop I've experienced in ACP was with a heavy gunner using a gauss minigun with explosive effect.
---
You have to bash instead of using fire, firing at teammates apparently works but not NPCs.
---
Earl drops 50 to 500 caps on death if you loot his body.
---
Yes i got them both on PC. Several actually. Sold the extra tenderizer plans for 20k each.

---
One of those 6 times the event wasn't active, the other 5 times it was.
---
I've run it 12 times now only gotten one plan to drop so far!
---
Are you on FB?   There's a bounty group there; pretty sure you could find people to join you.    They are completely optimized for pvp.   
---
Thanks for doing it or even trying to do it.   At 500+ caps, it definitely needs to be done.
---
Be safe and stock up on provisions.
---
Isn‚Äôt it funny how they all gave me hot garbage drops lol
---
Whoever downvoted you needs to choke on glue lol
---
I think I used about 4
---
Idk how many times I did the event but I think around 50. I recieved every possible reward except Tenderizer plan... I also got multiple plans for different items but only one plan for tato salad. PC
---
I've had it both ways, I have another method I'm going to check next time I play
---
Are you missing any of the other plans? I‚Äôll gladly trade you for your extra salad recipe.
---
That's your problem right there, you can't let the game know you want something, you will never get it.
---
How hard would it be to put 2 push to talk keys in the game? One for area and one for team?
---
They can't rob you of your sense of accomplishment
---
You can prob afk on the drum and tape the right stick down so you are looking in circles. Pretty sure it'll work anyway, didn't try myself.
---
Really? I'm more amazed that you was able to see what you loot. I took everything in a sec and was walking out in high speed...
---
Dude are you on Xbox??? I‚Äôll pay you to build me a few!
---
I have all the other plans and outfits. I have two extra Tato Salads.
---
Do you have anything else to trade?
---
I could give you the scrap to build it if you were on ps4
---
Did you find all keys for the tnt domes ?
---
Christ. How elitist can you be?
---
I'm I'm "food" build then as I have thru hiker. Green thumb (leave it equppied cus it's to much hassle to equip/uneqiup) and bear arms. 
---
Screw em. 
---
Btw. I wouldn't ever even dream of whinging about another player cus they are full health or low level. I just try to do my best and assume the ones I play with are too.
---
That's par for the course.
---
I guess that means I'm a food build too but my question is why would it mean someone else keeps dying?
---
I have been hopping from vendor to vendor across numerous servers during the downtime and never seen either plan for sale.
---
I saw someone trying to sell the tato salad recipe for 9K.    
---
ROTFL!   For me, anyway.
---
Yeah, I tried doing extra research on it after making this post because i remember people talking about a social bug that messes with your friends list a bit ago, and it brought me back here.  
---
Was able to join a friend's private world but having trouble joining anybody's public world.
---
Hopefully you'll get them on Second Serving.
---
My first run- I was the first and only person to drop and die into a pack of uber levels waiting. 
---
I didn't need a mic to know they all said 'Jesus Christ' with a collective head shaking.... Atleast I redeemed myself by good play and a successful clear.
---
Fuck I was embarrassed LOLZ
---
Honestly you deserve this. If you continue to throw mounds of money at this broken video game don't complain when it bites you in the ass. Why should Bethesda actually fix the game when people like you will give them tons of money regardless? That's why the game is shit, because of people like you.
---
Ehh you are right but I still wish I could drop a nuke on his face.
---
Yep. It really is a dumbass name.
---
I'm on PC so use mouse/keyboard, but I suppose if you used a controller you could do that.  Might consider that for the Sept event.
---
Every 3star weapons is worth its scrap from now on.
---
I got the same problem on public world, it doesn't display the name of the people playing even if I have them as a friend. Instead it appears "Player" and level on steam.Is there a way to fix this?  
---
Edit:  
---
My bad, I found the way to fix it. In game settings&gt;display&gt;show other players name
---
I sold tenderizer plans for 20k, mod plans and grill plans for 5k, new outfits and hats for 3k, and the backpack for 8k. Goes like hotcakes.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt mind buying the last 10 since it‚Äôs a wash that way. Just have to hit level 90! I‚Äôm sitting at 72, so 18 more levels to go!
---
Got several banked weapons. I tend to keep all the instigating furious two shot bloodied and junkies I pick up if level 45-50.
---
What types of weapons you use?
---
Jesus my last run was incredibly lucky then because that's what got along with a mod for it the run before. 
---
Going to have to jump around a bunch of camps to find the Cally mask tho. Three outfits but none of those :/
---
Yea I've looked up and down dyer and nada. There even a rad storm if that affects anything
---
Ah gotcha. Ya I might try it for the next event and see if it works.
---
Awesome shot!
---
Really?  I thought the CSS was pretty darned wonderful for bloodied.   Might have to pop a radaway or diluted once or twice, but that along with Radshield, makes all those things do-able.
---
They are hard to spot
---
That‚Äôs almost enough to convince me to move there for a bit, I didn‚Äôt know about that.
---
Its like 1000 in 8 hours right?
---
Yea happened to me when i solo‚Äôd the queen, I had read that Earle doesn‚Äôt do that so he‚Äôs more solo-friendly, but apparently the report was wrong.
---
I have water purifiers 5 caps and 50 tato‚Äôs, use turd bomb to instantly re-grow tato‚Äôs and sell 600 of them for 2 caps to train vendor.  Need hard bargain, green thumb and charisma.   Max daily caps in 5 mins.
---
I didn't know you could buy off him. Whoops.
---
Bloody Stealth Commando build
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_D0U69RTlw  
---
If you read the replies it looks like it may not work anymore.
---
Are they attached to trees like the stranger pods?
---
I take 3-4 rad/sec in Rad. Rumble in the CSA. Do you take more?
---
I am now rethinking my magic minigun and pondering dusting off my junkie ffr UGL.  I am assuming you have power user on correct?
---
Yes, stumps too.
---
hm. TIL... Thanks!
---
Thank God somebody understood what SASensenmann said... Lol .. I am a low health build for damage and greatly appreciate and protect my paladin warriors in the grasslands braving and attracting the waves of enemies that find quick, sudden dispatch quietly from my perch.  I say let us raise a glass and celebrate their brawn and bravery... Cheers!
---
Push them into the fight or out the cave
---
Not gonna happen
---
The reason is css along with just the normal hazmat suits have a hidden flat 90% radiation mitigation on top of the 1000 rad resist.
---
So even if you went the best alternate route and say, used the following:
---
* full ss armor with +25 rad resist on every piece = 422 rr (have fun rolling ss pieces for the next 5-8 years to get all 5 unyielding with rr and a good tertiary like sent/cavs/whatever suits your build)
---
* radshield = 300 rr
---
* lead lined packpack mod: 90 rr
---
* rad resistant perk: 40 rr
---
* 852 total rr
---
There's probably more things I'm forgetting but I'd guess you'd take at least +7 or 8 rads in a nuke zone with all that but at best it would still be +5 or 6 which makes sustaining \~20% health a chore and require constant radaways.
---
tl:dr: nothing is better than css in rad zones/radiation rumble.  period.
---
***Pass the barbecue sauce, please.  This clown tastes a little funny.***
---
When it first went live (PS4) all loots from Earle were two or three stars, since last night it has been only one star. Either bugged or dev had second thoughts.
---
Any chance you suffered from Rad Worms?
---
They are not thing sadly. Same with the T-65 and Excavator
---
PC player here, did a shit load of events. Got 2 tato salads but not one meat tenderizer plan. traded for one however. Got several mods, about 2-3 each. I havent counted all that I got, but your numbers feels like what I experienced, minus my two tato salads.
---
Yeah im allocating the five i had in ironclad for a hybrid bloodied furious. Bonus crit dmg  in luck extra ranged sneak crits in agility. Bloody mess max, max heavy guns stacked.
---
pc?
---
If you still have an extra tenderizer plan, would you take an equivalent value trade? I don‚Äôt have that many caps atm (returned to the game only recently and have been buying up the serum recipes whenever I accumulate 17500 caps and then spend 6k a week on bullion too)
---
Well if you dont want to use Power Armor, Chinese stealth suit + Armored Backpack is still your best bet.
---
Things to help this build:
---
Perks:  Life Giver, Rejuvinated, Body guards/Lone Wanderer, Evasive, Serendipity, Ricochet, Barbarian, Class Freak, Field Surgeon
---
Mutations:  Empath (only with team); Herbivore , and make sure you dont have Healing Factor 
---
Food:  Tato Salad + Silt Bean Soup + Vodka (can use party boy if your build allows)
---
This will give you high health and decent resistances even when bloodied.  Stacking max health really helps bloodied build.  Then if you have class freak and you are not using the healing factor mutation your stimpacks will save your life when in danger.
---
It ran from Thursday to Wednesday, so that is a week
---
What is Second Serving? I‚Äôve never heard of that before. (This was my first Meat Week).
---
Go to the rad cave in the mire where you do the enclave stuff, there is an elevator in the back that takes you to the surface use that and there are 3-5 swamp plants right around the exit.
---
Those sold out fast aaaaand trading is not allowed on this sub.
---
Especially when the perk card features a flamer.
---
 No risk in looting. 
---
You can stay until the collapse and you get to keep your junk and get rewarded.
---
&gt;Food is sustainable without those perks
---
No it really isn't. If you want food dmg buffs from all the different meats on all the time, you need to keep a decent stock and the food will spoil in your inventory before you get to use it. Sure it's possible to farm for all of the different food every time it spoils, but that's just incredibly time consuming... And I know, since I also have that build and I've experimented around it.
---
&gt;players even have camp fridges they could buy if they wanted to
---
The fridge is a joke, if it was 90% reduced spoil rate, it might be worth a damn. But then it would be too pay to win for atom shop.
---
&gt;Because, in your own words, a person can cook all these random food items and eat them. And they get the same boost.
---
No they don't. Different food items have different stat boosts, melee players are looking for very different boosts to sneak commando players in terms of damage.
---
The point is to trade 15% dmg from bloody mess (for example) for 50% from food boosts with good with salt for example on melee, it's a trade off, but it's a win if it's sustainable.
---
&gt;‚ÄúYet the other meanings exist.‚Äù Not a valid point. Flat earthers still  argue the earth is flat, doesn‚Äôt make their argument valid.
---
No. Your statement was an oxymoron, you say majority rule dictates what the meaning is, yet you just stated that words can indeed have different meanings. And that is the exact case, if you go look in a dictionary, many words do indeed have multiple meanings, even if they aren't used as much.
---
Refreshment:
---
\-
---
&gt;If you want a VATS or sneak build you  do need specific perks. Why are you arguing that mate. please look up  what a sneak and vats build are.
---
Read again, I said that anyone can use VATs and sneak, but if you want it to be optimized, you put in the relevant perks just like with a melee build focusing on food buffs as a major sustained dmg source.
---
&gt;I don't need any perks to VATS or  sneak either. But if I want my build to be optimized, in this case make  food buffs sustainable, I get the relevant perks.
---
I‚Äôve got an instigating M79 grenade launcher. It‚Äôs great for first hit when several mobs are just hanging out chatting. Perks that improve explosives are great with it.
---
I don't truly understand this whole food build concept, but in my run everyone died but me (not counting the embarrassment of the jump down haha) and I was churning through Stims picking up the broken bodies.
---
We started with 8, ended killing Earle with 3 of us.
---
I got mall but tenderizer...had 22 taco salads...lol hopping for a 2nd chance in a few weeks...
---
It could be worse. It could have gone as long as Fasnacht did and be a Meat Fortnite.
---
Yur a wizard
---
Repair kits.
---
I did not count but I would say at least 10-12 times per day of the event, so probably similar to yourself. I know i got ultra lucky on double tenderizer plans. I was kinda hoping to get a 3rd in the last hours, but that was just wishful thinking.
---
I missed the whole thing, was away from my computer the whole time
---
This is the first I‚Äôve ever heard the term lmao. I started to play for quests but made the cap max farming purified water and then built my base which is more of a shopping center with different stores.
---
During prime events I developed two techniques.  One is to run at them and swipe with mele just before impact.  The other is to jump(ideally with marsupial) and then use vats to target and swing on the way down.  I‚Äôm unarmed mele, so may be slightly different to 2 handed.
---
Love the the Thin Blue Line flag! BlueLivesMatterüá∫üá∏
---
Are you kidding?? As someone who was rocking 60+ INT for the run it makes a massive difference. A single line in the sand event with Lunchboxes, leader bobbleheads, cranberry relish, brain bombs, berry mentats, would net me a full rank in many cases. Imma hard disagree with the idea of downplaying the value of INT here, since I've been done with the run for over 2 weeks (with taking a 10 day break in the middle).
---
However, your game, your choice. I wish you the best of luck either way
---
Best thing to do is just wait a bit
---
the guy dying over and over is the food build.  Period.  
---
But so is the guy not doing much if any noticeable damage.  But at the end of the day 1 food build complaining about another food build is just the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Don't ever go to Vegas, my dude.
---
Dauguerre also has a line about breathing broken glass if you live there. I'd definitely recommend moving there for a little while. If just for the sunsets. For whatever reason the lighting there is better than many of the other places in the game.
---
Thanks. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that but it makes sense. Most of this post isn‚Äôt about trading ofc. But I‚Äôll cease and desist any further talk of it here. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Vegans, be like grahm. He may be a carnivore but he doesn‚Äôt force it on his pet, Chally. That‚Äôs why challys happy and healthy
---
Fenses are in the "Defense" tab.
---
Sadly no and I tried after I got my first tenderizer plan. Made about 20 and scrapped them all and nothing. Sadly the event mod plans are the only way to acquire them. Peppered being probably the best followed by salty and spicy last. I would roll with salty since it has a cripple debuff, but it adds a ton of weight. Peppered is highest base damage and not too bad on added weight. Spicy is just a tiny energy damage bonus.
---
Food builds got all weapons buffed unless they just wanted Earle to be more squashy. I'm not saying dude is justified to be whining around but I'm just saying.
---
hmm..
---
havent been on yet today.. but during the event I had my tenderizer mod plans in my vendor for 1776 and no takers.. Im thinking I better change that as soon as I log on.. lol
---
I don't. There's a magzine and I believe a bobble head on that island I can never find because the bastard is hiding it.
---
Damn Right! üí™üèøüëçüèø‚úäüèø
---
I appreciated that the few times I was trapped but would prefer to lose the junk since it adds so much suspense.
---
Do people view mods negatively here? you seem to be getting down voted.
---
Same, finished yesterday and never once got hit by it. I feel bad for the players that have, though. Every time I logged in, the first thing I would do is check the challenges and I'd always hold my breath until I saw "0/9" wondering, *is this going to be the day?*
---
F3, FNV F4 Deathclaws "Oh God it's a Demon come to feed on my body then my soul!"
---
F76 "Oh Free Black Titanium and Gears!"
---
Did you remember to scroll sideways in the fences menu?
---
That's cringe, I got 14 pods right now and 0 swamp plants
---
5 of each I believe it is.
---
Take 5 in a row
---
A nuke is the silliest threat of all time because I do not give a flying fuck about my camp. But okay foodbuild.
---
There was just pods also you left out a couple of small details about the cave üòÇüíÄ
---
lol that does seem a bit pricey for that particular plan
---
Happened to me a lot, just stay on the ‚ÄúPress ang button‚Äù screen for a few mins (5) and then try
---
Repeat it
---
Or reinstall the game
---
Enjoy it whilst it lasts. Angry Turtle has confirmed the current PTS has fixed magic weapons.
---
I seen it before once or twice, pissed off I cant tame it, this game has way too many restrictions on pets, its bullshit
---
You won‚Äôt make it. Start saving your atoms because you‚Äôll probably be 1-5 tiers away by the end
---
dammit! lol
---
That seems to be the case with these kind of games. Division 2 will release a patch that "fixes" something nobody complained about that pisses everyone off while actual problems aren't fixed. Bc they saw the analytics or some shit. But idk who at Bethesda be like "Walls, dammit. Something has got to be done about these walls. People like it too much."
---
Lol, ban the users for something Bethesda put in the game. Not the brightest idea.
---
As a wierdo who secretly role plays a first Responder, I run squad manuver so I can sprint to revives even faster..... I like sprinting under SBQ or Earle to get the rez lol It's an 'oh fuck' moment!
---
Makes you fart when you take damage. True story.
---
My favorite spot was in the Ash Heap. I loved the waves of rats and crickets. I love when you get swarmed with mobs. Swinging my axe Buddy. Then the craziness of the scorpions and sheepsquach.
---
One time we must of staggered or crippled him because he fell down and struggled to get up!
---
They could make companion robots which would be smaller sized versions of the originals and can be equipped with one of a few mods:
---
Laser-a small laser that would deal damage to enemies, not enough to kill an enemy by itself but could help on tougher enemies
---
Sheild-reduces damage slightly
---
Reviver-will revive you every 15 minutes if you go down. The cool down is there so the perks like mysterious saviour are still viable.
---
Backpack - two possibilities here, first it could just increase players carry weight, or it could have its own inventory where we could store items.
---
Scanner- marks nearby enemies or items of value.
---
They could also add in skins for the robots and have them do emotes with us, like if we do a dance they will also dance.
---
I balanced them out this way as then they aren't just npcs which would just make the game 2X as easy in theory but more as a support companion which can help but can't kill an entire horde of enemies solo.
---
I know this is a few days later but I saw ps4 footage of shooting a gat plaz and youre right you guys don't have the same lag we do. Strange.
---
okay but what about console players though
---
 I need the backpack and almost everything lol
---
So they have to be different drugs or the same?  Should I just chug a sixxer to get the bonus?
---
I really doubt that you had 60+ intelligence but okay lol
---
Ps4 and never got the tenderizer plan either. Fingers crossed for the second helping to get that plan
---
Yes, let's ban people because Bethesda can't put their code into a shape that vaguely resembles a game engine, that's 100% the solution of all our problems here!
---
This is not the first time it happens. First it was Energy Weapons, causing respawn problems, then it was Strangler Heart PA, killing the game at big events, now the Tesla... this game's code has more duct tape than Stiles' Jeep, and holds together 1/100th as well as that car. You can't fault people who use their own equipment just because an update broke it.
---
Take about 5 to 7 of the same Chem type consecutively in your pipboy in quick succession. So pop in 5 to 7 Mentats in a row. That should get you hooked. Then repeat that for 4 other Chems or booze. 
---
Suppressors are good for stealth and not getting noticed right away
---
right i get that.  but dude left some nice info to be helpful that he was correct on besides the death part.  hell dude probably thought when u teleport out it is kinda a "death" cause u didn't make it out on time.  mine fell on you.  its ez to assume u die.
---
My GT Is Masinary if he‚Äôs still around and you need help
---
just slam 4 of the exact same thing as fast as you can so say psycho - eat 4 in a row, wait 10 seconds and you might get a message that you are addicted.  if not take 1, wait 5 seconds, another, etc till you get the addiction message.  it won't take more than 8.
---
don't mix chems/alcohol when getting addicted just focus on the 1 until you are addicted then the next.
---
repeat as needed till you have 5 total addictions and note your pip boy effects tab never shows addiction for a chem you are high on so if in doubt wait till you are no longer high (remove chem fiend to lessen duration which getting addicted for this reason).
---
But 90% of the time pounding 4-6 of anything in rapid succession will get you addicted to it.
---
Thank you! As always, you are very kind.
---
5 of 5. So 5 beers, 5 mentats and so on.
---
It was 7 days. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
---
That‚Äôs seven.

Scroll down and it had the dates.
---
In a public server (steam), anyone can take the stuff from the Collectron in my camp?
---
Indeed ü§£
---
a piece of TShooters armor helps.. 
---
I also carry a TShooters weapon on all my toons.. only mobs I do that for..
---
fukka ASSaultron.. and high level gutsys too..
---
He tried to help and u complain about details? My lord
---
No only private teams
---
Everyone complains about screws and ballistic fiber, I just bought them in bulk.
---
It works great for healing tamed pets at your camp, too.
---
People try to take them from me if they see that I hooked up a fusion generator to the fusion core producer.
---
It spawns in the ash heap also.
---
The couple I attended were like that. Seemed kinda pointless, but meh whatever. I think I got a stein from it.
---
the one out front "reading" the sign there?
---
Best advice I've seen
---
Sigh.  Guess I‚Äôll need to look at random camps until I find someone selling them.  Or try harder during second helpings.    But I kept having the event bug on me so I missed out a number of times.
---
I don't care about "my" workshop either. It's a consequence-free online slap fight for fun, ya know?
---
I'm doing bloodied commando right now btw. Sounds like they're about to nerf me into the ground soon though.
---
Meanwhile I'm walking around Colossal Problem with 120 stimpacks and Team Medic ready to revive and dive.
---
Why is he so butthurt over quantums?
---
That sweet sweet black power armor skin though.
---
Keep us informed please
---
Bruh im not complaining lol you are clearly just trying to start something. Also it was a joke about the deathclaws in the cave.
---
If you just avoid dying while looting, you can take your time. Once the mine collapses on you, you are teleported to the front with everyone that "made it" with all your junk. Same thing as lode bearing.
---

This video will show you everything you need to know.
---
Thanks for the junkie Info I meant the suppressors ledgendary, reduce targets damage by a percent.
---
Ahh children always the same ü•±
---
I know I‚Äôm just trying to raise awareness so dear Tesla users all show some sense use some different guns for a short period of time to not disturb and ruin other player experience while Bethesda is working on a fix.
---
You do know about turrets right?! /s
---
That would be nice on all occasions. I don‚Äôt feel like pulling out my recon scope railway rifle just to know where they‚Äôre
---
The most annoying thing is when I finished it two weeks ago and I can't even get atoms from daily challenges anymore. Like, there's zero reason to even do them anymore.
---
Here and the youtuber tells you how to get them. The things is they bloom only in certain circonstances. Take a look. ‚úå
---
[Edit:] This is still how i do to get them. I wait for the event and just before going at the event i collect them.
---
https://youtu.be/BZPvkLxzaX4
---
It‚Äôs okay.  We get another meat week next month
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the one. One swift shot and it would take off like the worlds slowest rocket gliding around the parking lot.
---
Base INT max (15)+ all Unyielding armor (15)+ each armor piece gave a bonus 1 to INT (5)+ Egg head and herd mentally when on a team (8+3)+ Building team maxxed out (4)+ brain bombs (7.5)+ berry mentats with chem fiend (5)+ night person (3)
---
And if I was feeling saucy add an INT bobblehead for plus 2 or leader for extra XP, Cranberry relish for XP, Live and love 8 for XP when I'm a team.
---
Go do better research lol
---
Edit: Curator to extend timers for mags and bobbles. Saved lunchboxes because I want them for the next season
---
Edit to clarify: Running herbivore helps with the Brain bombs and relish
---
Thank you! It showed up and I‚Äôm SO happy
---
Meat week shall return in Sept!
---
I mean, we've known this since people completed it weeks ago.
---
I‚Äôve had the same exact problem and that was because my PS4 storage was almost full so i deleted a game and reset my PS4 and worked right away I‚Äôd give it a try
---
Prime
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone is arguing that the Responders or Foundation aren‚Äôt good. The problem is that Foundation doesn‚Äôt have the kind of depth or development that the NCR or the Minutemen have. The NCR is morally good, when compared to House or the Legion, but it suffers from corruption and imperialist tendencies. The Minutemen are devoted defenders of the Commonwealth, but they suffered terribly from major military failures and infighting.
---
The Responders also have some depth. They are emergency workers and police officers trying to salvage what was lost in the nuclear apocalypse. But they underestimated the scale of what they were trying to do.
---
They abandoned the people of the Savage Divide, paving the way for David Thorpe to rise to power. They made a foolish blunder with Rose, and underestimated what Thorpe and the Cutthroats would do in retaliation.
---
Foundation does not have that kind of depth. They are  good, but that‚Äôs their only quality. They don‚Äôt kill, they don‚Äôt steal, and they oppose chem use. Even in the Raider quest line, Foundation never dirties their hands. They are good for the sake of good, and that is not a realistic faction.
---
Meat week, meat week, hmm hm hmm hm
---
I miss it already.
---
So I feel this. I got mod plans FOR the tenderizer, but no tenderizer itself plans. Sad day.
---
K bud
---
What is part 2?
---
5 or more, it won‚Äôt work if you do 4
---
Are you some kind of musician?? :)
---
Sorry man damn wtf
---
Same.  Someone killed me, took all my junk and destroyed my base there.  It's so annoying.
---
So dont pick up junk or pick up junk... I feel like that maybe the cause to why I haven't gotten it. I literally pick up everything
---
Defense tab
---
Another meat week
---
Can you make enough prime ammo?
---
I would have bought that no problem, it‚Äôs a rare plan so you could hold onto it for six months and let the value increase and trade it to people that collect plans for a great weapon or armor on the other sub. 9k isn‚Äôt that many caps in the long run
---
Also your hunger doesn't go down. Level 2 you get bonus HP and the farts, at level 3 you get the HP, farts, and an XP bonus. No idea if the gas does damage, but I think it might. It's funny AF to see though.
---
It was very sad for me when I fast travelled to Vault 76 to join my wife and heard her very disappointingly say, ‚Äúawww, it‚Äôs all gone... it‚Äôs over.‚Äù around 12PM CST. (we weren‚Äôt sure when it was going to end exactly). 
---
Until next year Meat Week!
---
Looking forward to Halloween event now.
---
As a side note would anyone like to look at my junkies stuff, I'm on PS4. Sounds like a lot of work so I think I'll scrip what I have unless someone wants to 1v1 for scrip value.
---
Edit: also thanks for the quick replys and my psn is kit_cloud
---
Go play division 2 for 15 minutes. It will teach you ALL about using cover lol. Same applies here. Step behind something. Shoot her legs. Profit.
---
Facts, yet people still act surprised. Lol
---
We need a perk *Legendary Finder* that adds a diamond on your screen/map on all legendary corpses. You know what, I could even settle for a directional audio like the bobblehead/magazine finder perk.
---
There should‚Äôve been an option for you and Maggie to go kill penelope
---
Current update: two public teams onto him but griefer is hiding top of a tower at WS station. He is good and we can‚Äôt do any decent damage.
---
Edit: We finally did it! Joker came down and we lit him up!!! Justice served.
---
They're so flimsy.  I kill them before they can even attack me.
---
Yeah, i have 300 violet flux. Just needs steel
---
Accelerated, it's magic so damage doesn't matter.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and can confirm....came back after 3 hours to find myself at the main menu and only got one reward
---
better idea, lets ban u/sg1133 instead.
---
ft is fast travel   sbq is sorch beast queen.  the original end game boss.  if you launcha nuke at fissure prime she spawns and you can fight her.  she is very tough.
---
The next thing to consider is how easy it'll be to continue getting flux.
---
added you we are looking for a 7 pm start eastern time
---
Lmao, true
---
Well this explains why I can't find the left leg im looking for. Lmao. Its my last piece to complete the set, and I cant find one anywhere.
---
I have thru hiker, traveling pharmacy, pack rat, good with salt, and the extra weight backpack mod. 
---
I 1-shot the wendigos and I can solo Earle. 
---
This game is not difficult enough to require optimized builds.
---
Ah gotcha, well thanks for letting me know.
---
Wondering if the friends are dying and are calling the respawn screen fast travel.  If they are in fact fast traveling is OP trying to fast travel back to camp a million miles away to be outside of the nuke, and they are logically traveling just outside of the mine and still in the event area?
---
I agree. I finished maybe 4 or so days ago.    
---
If you were in the middle of a fight it would screw things up.    
---
IMO, you should get a big box in your Stash back and CAMP. A delivery from Vault-Tec. You can open it anywhere but it would do as  you suggest. Fireworks. A photo frame. A bunch of high level mats in that combined box we got during the run. Two tokens that can be used in a machine that grands you one piece of gear and weapon.    
---
You would go through and check off what you want through subsequent menus.    
---
Armor-Leather/Metal/Etc-Level-guaranteed 3 star, max durability bar and also degrades REAL slow, and you get to choose 3 effects. Same goes for the weapon. Mods like Ultra Light, recievers, and all would still have to be crafted or bought.    
---
You'd also get 5000 caps and 500 atoms and a Player Icon unique to completing it.
---
Preston. FO4 (if I remember correctly) would not put on repeatable quests unless you actively accepted the quest. But with Preston, if you got anywhere near him, boom, you now have another repeatable quest on your hands.
---
(I realize now I may be misremembering - perhaps you had to talk to him, but you didn't get to say "yeah I'll do this")
---
üòÇwhy?
---
Typical Bethesda...
---
Unless you don‚Äôt have work or school and you have way too much spare time that you spend only playing this game, I highly doubt you did 100 runs. Only 144 ever happened during the event, since they spawned. every hour for 6 days considering sleep, even if you got 8 hours of sleep every night you would‚Äôve had 104 waking hours to do the event. Did you spend literally every single moment of your free time playing this game for the past week??
---
I was going to record a stream tonight because I plan on finishing it then.  I'll have to create my own fan fare. I'll crack open a Diet Coke.

---
Idk if there is a fov slider on a console
---
I have over 600 screws taking space in my stash and I'm not yet prepared at the idea of letting them go, my hoarder within still considers them a rare luxury item lol it'll take a while to get to the point in which I'll remove them from the 'instinctively loot' list.
---
Rip i made a mistake. It's 50% chance to roll 1-2 from.harvesting Stranger Bloom
---
I was taking a few extra...I really thought the CSS had a higher rad resist
---
Division 2 is already great. It‚Äôs perfect. I can handle black tusk golden boi heavy gunner just fine, the cover is phenomenal. But in FO76, even though I‚Äôm virtually in another room the laser shreds me over and over. PC btw...
---
Nope!
---
People ask where he is but nobody asks how is Earl Williams.
---
If you're on XB, I can give you one.
---
Idk but I know ppl where doing this and traveling away from event and not getting rewards. Like the first two events I died after looting earl so it put me outside in the nuke zone. Second time I hurried and got power armor on so I didn‚Äôt die. And after you‚Äôre out of mine you have to wait couple minutes to see rewards so I wonder if you travel away before ppl leave mine or before countdown ends if it takes you out of event like if I would walk away from zone where cook off event was I wouldn‚Äôt of gotten rewards
---
Ditto. Would have thought it would just appear in the armor bench menu eventually.
---
I traded my meat tenderizer for marsupial serum recipie.  It would have been one more damn melee weapon to drop for me from Legendary enemies.
---
I haven't even seen one of those, the challenge says I picked one up but I dont remember where
---
It's been 1k
---
I miss him already...
---
The event was a mess. From far-spawning mobs to scorpions that won‚Äôt come to the surface and mobs that just flat out won‚Äôt spawn. 1-shotting mobs is annoying for people trying to tag for xp but with all the other things that go wrong it is almost required in order to beat the timer. Especially when 8 people are so focused on tagging the non-legendary boss that no one runs to the opposite ends of the event to clear the last two primes in time and the event fails.
---
Oh great and all knowing Wastelander thanks for imparting this great knowledge on us.  /s
---
Seriously dude not everyone has seen this and it is a cool pic.  Personally I have seen scorched deathclaws at queen but not glowing. Props to OP for the cool pic.
---
Appreciate the offer, but im on ps4.  Good lookin out though.
---
You put the chill on my crazy thoughts. Thank you kind strangler.
---
What build do u run and did u solo them?
---
I feel that. I started Ghost of Tsushima. Nice change of pace.
---
I did it with my JFFR Ultracite Gat Laser, I spent 10 cores and took most of the time but am unsure if any magic damage was actually being done or not.
---
Now you "either misread the post or meant to comment on another comment"... OK.
---
My post refuted your inability to read by showcasing that your post would not resolve workshop disputes, which is what the OP was talking about and what the discussion is about.
---
So "doucheknob", don't get mad at me because you don't read.
---
I don‚Äôt like how he keeps calling me babe
---
I‚Äôm just saying he seems to think it‚Äôs anywhere near as rare as the Yao guai. He probably just wants attention
---
Nooo :( my fav event of the year I love chally!!
---
Only if we get a little longer timer to loot.
---
Not really a good idea to do it during the fight.
---
I always wonder if people know what's happening when I start whipping the ever loving fuck out of the Brahmin in Free Range, or if they think I'm a nut.
---
Same here. AFK on the drums and rubber banned my poor controller just trying to get the meat tenderizer plan but only got lots of costumes. RNG is just fun that I got the helmet first time running The Colossal Problem.
---
Btw I think you can get the tato salad recipe on the trading subreddit by caps or some flux but the prize of the tenderizer plan just got crazy atm.
---
I couldn't get the controller trick to work on pc, but I used a small heavy object to hold down the W key while working the spit in photomode. If you angle your camera right under the meat on the spit and slightly up, the camera will keep bouncing up and down, maintaining the movement necessary to not time out. All my other afk attempts failed and only managed to afk properly on the final night haha
---
Use your camera to find him.
---
This would've taken ten seconds to quality test. Classic 76 devs.
---
Bethesda can't count. Is anyone really surprised by this?
---
No,  it seems like in the same vein he found something cool,  especially for it's location,  and took a cool pic. 
---
You sound like a fun guy to have around at parties.
---
Raiders mention you being an ass if you keep the gold. Meg said it was a crap move but she probably would have done the same.
---
I get random raiders cussing me out and telling me they‚Äôre tired of hearing my name around Crater.
---
Oh okay interesting, thanks for the info
---
 "As mentioned after yesterday's PTS update, we've made some design changes for the "Hunt for the Treasure Hunter" event and we'd love to hear what you think! As of today, August 26, we've enabled the¬†Treasure Hunter event in the PTS so you should be able to find Treasure Hunter Mole Miners¬†throughout Appalachia, and purchase Mole Miner Pail crafting supplies from vendors. Here's a rundown of the changes we made to these events in our latest PTS update:
---
**Hunt for the Treasure Hunter Returns!**
---
* Going forward, Treasure Hunter Mole Miners will now spawn in all regions of Appalachia
---
* Treasure Hunter Mole Miners now scale with One Wasteland, up to level 50, and they will drop legendary loot that is leveled appropriately.
---
   * We‚Äôve separated Treasure Hunter rewards from the Holiday Scorched rewards list, and added a number of new rewards that are exclusive to Treasure Hunter events.
---
   * Treasure Hunter Mole Miners now have an increased chance to drop Ornate Pails, and players now have an increased chance to get Treasure Hunter exclusive rewards from lower-quality Pails.
---
* Additionally, we‚Äôve greatly reduced the Cap prices of Treasure Hunter Pail crafting components that can be purchased from Vendors"
---
Really?  I had no idea.
---
I went all Zen and shit and have removed my Collectron, ally and fusion generator. I run a stack of hidden silent vault tec ones and it's so goddam peaceful now. Can hear the wind chimes so clearly.... 
---
There should be mute options on these people. Or a vast reduction in the loop cycle.
---
Oh wow haha I haven‚Äôt seen that same joke posted hundreds of times online by people thinking they‚Äôre funny
---
I think we're going to get another Meat Week in September, iirc.
---
Seems to happen when you go down in the DoT spots.
---
I got 3 plans in 20 minutes of grinding, if the RNG on the live servers is as good I'll be very happy. The animatronic clown is bugged with the hat coming down to his chest not to the top of his head, I don't really care but a lot of people probably will.
---
Why is he still around hanging on my world? Or is it this week too ?
---
I'm convinced it still tries to load you into the same world over and over.
---
I tried earlier 3 times before I gave up, joined the top person on my friends list and boom, my CAMP could place.
---
Probably afk whilst he slept. Not hard to do
---
Hey, you know me, Miller. I don‚Äôt judge.
---
Damn I didn‚Äôt even get the one reward I wanted....
---
Behold the beauty of playing AFK. ;-) You could actually get better numbers if you switched servers right after the event completed and the event was still running on the new one. I did that a few times, but it was quite a rare chance.
---
Tf is a good build
---
I hope they at least keep the area set up, because we are getting a second Meat Week. Plus, I just want to hear the Hawaiian music.
---
Yes! I've been wanting a hammer like that for a while now, I really hope I get that skin plan!
---
Bloodied unarmed, did it with some high level randoms
---
This is how I felt watching fasnacht disappear üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
You romanced him you dirty bastard! I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs the taker in our relationship...
---
I hope they find a nice balance between atoms and the legendary run.
---
Thankfully I haven't met anyone like that, but rather the opposite. Someone thanked me for face tanking Earle.
---
Thank you, thank you, to everybody on this thread. I finally switched over from rifleman to commando after reading this thread, and gameplay is a lot more fun. While I mostly shoot .45 and .556 legendaries, I switched a Fixer over to .38 auto, and it is surprisingly viable for a lot of enemies. An auto laser rifle is fun, too. Most surprising was how the auto receiver turns the railroad gun from a weird novelty into a viable weapon, even when mostly just taking single shots. You can even get the spikes back from the bodies, much of the time (yay, recycling).
---
Still carrying my beloved Instigating Lever, though, for making those Long Distance surprise calls.
---
Man, this sounds way more exciting than my recent bounty hunts. I go after any bounty I see, but every time it's some schmuck who really wanted that 14 lead or 200 ammo and lasts maybe a tenth of a second after I open up. However, I did manage to get a guy who broke into *my* camp once, that was gratifying.
---
Tenderizer does too. But it's all situational. If you're solo Lone Wanderer would be your best bet. If you're a glass canon tenderizer fits your build. If you're on a team where someone else has tenderizer then you could pick up suppressor but if you have a tank with suppressor you could take something else entirely. Just depends on exactly what you have going on.
---
And my axe!
---
The game is already in bad shape regarding framedrops. I can simply jump and get a 2-3 second of framedrop...
---
I'm not triggered at all. You just said something dumb, so dumb in fact that I asked you if you meant something else. You, condescendingly, responded, and thus I responded to you. It's called a conversation, dingus.
---
Chally has two heads
---
Ahhh i really want a tenderizer plan... i don't know where to find one. Can someone help me? I play on pc
---
You do know that turrets are practically useless right? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è all of them get one hit by The scorpions cuz they're level 75 or they take out the foundation that they stand on in one hit and then the turrents disappear, all they did was aggro my base even more üôÑ
---
"That's a whole lotta *glass* goin on"
---
It literally spawned on the hour every hour since Thursday......
---
Same.  I‚Äôve gotten wise to it after 3-4 runs and now I‚Äôm constantly repositioning between VATS bursts.
---
After playing if a few times, it's boring. Repeatable events like this aren't great content.
---
Ah, ok. I had done that event before! I didnt know what sbq was though. Thank you!!!
---
Sounds like a foodbuild coupled with a few more experienced foodbuilds. LOL
---
seen one
---
Lol why did i read this in grahams voice?
---
Oh thank god I saw the helmet but couldn't make it
---
Sure...but I feel it would be wisest to kill the guy and run before Bethesda's code...er...the mine collapses like a house of cards...
---
September 22nd-28th
---
Jangles beer stein and board game not enough?
---
There are tons of food build complaint posts, and even worse comments, dunno how you missed them 
---
And most people just call out a non bloodied build as a "food build" which is easy to spot since they won't have an irradiated health bar
---
Probably not üòÄ
---
I love my quad ffr fr. I jump. I fire. I am raiden. Fear Me!!!
---
Right
---
You can craft weapons and dismantle them for learning it's mods that takes thousands of screws
---
This one was actually exciting and was fun to experience as a brake from the usual grind. This guy eventually got so much attention it was a full on manhunt while he fast traveled everywhere.
---
When u get married neither will the wife.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I didn‚Äôt get 60 caps!
---
Is it safe to assume that all the treasure hunter pail exclusive plans are coming back as well? Croc Backpack Plan, treasure hunter and insurgent outfit sets, radstag knife, circus trailer, etc.?
---
I may actually need to dump all 150k caps and try to get the full set this time if so.
---
Yeah, why wouldn't they just classify it as a hat for fuck sake. Schoolboy error by some temp
---
Same, someone was kind enough to drop me a non legendary tenderizer so I'm running that salty along with my grognaks on my melee build.
---
Wait? wanamingo?
---
The only reason I even keep fallout 1st is because of the scrap box if I was to cancel it I would have probably filled half my stash with junk alone
---
The Targeting Hud in PAs doesn‚Äôt work on him either. Spawns are also very faint you barely see them unless they‚Äôre already in your face.
---
Ps4
---
HA! Drink some nukashine, set off fireworks, see where it takes you!
---
As a food build who takes three or four good Earle kicks to the face to keep him interested while my bloodoed crew hits him from afar, I support this message.
---
Earle gave me a one star suppressors golf club!
---
That animatronic clown is the stuff of nightmares. WHY BSG?! WHY?!
---
Ah damn. Was gonna say if you were on XB1 I‚Äôm pretty sure I have an extra I‚Äôd sell to you cheap
---
Good riddance....now launch my nukes at Monongah mine plebs so I can carry you all during A colossal problem. You've eaten enough...time to go to work!
---
Good to see they made the lights much brighter
---
It‚Äôs come a long way since launch
---
I always thought there should be a side arm perk thats lets say 3 perk points in Agi and it lets your  pistols get 75% of the damage buffs of your other guns. Although this then raises the problem of what damage boosting perks and for what guns, maybe a system to tag a type of weapon specific buffs idk
---
Awesome post üëçüëç
---
I did 3 events and then my TV stopped working. I missed pretty much the whole thing. BUT, from the 3 I did, I got the Tenderizer plan, Chally‚Äôs Backpack plan and the Chally Mask.
---
yeah, it makes no sense at all,   
---
I thought that was build based on food/chem buff... but this would not make sense either since you can buff also as a bloodied... oh well. I guess people need a stupid name for everything, even when there is nothing to name
---
 haha
---
yes, they are returning as well. but there are no mounted heads or shit like that. it seems to all be treasure hunter event exclusives now, both new and old.
---
Nope. It ran from the 20-26. So that is
---
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
---
It was available to participate on each day. 
---
More so they set the dates several weeks ago, when they announced they were pushing it back a few days. 
---
7 days. Times and dates announced.
---
The way your trying to count it, as 7 consecutive 24 hour periods. That‚Äôs not how it works.
---
I know you are going to disagree and say it is. It‚Äôs not. Just because a person doesn‚Äôt want to accept a fact doesn‚Äôt make the fact go away.
---
it doesn't know where your camp is until it finds a world
---
Why I have the same instigating crossbow but I'm at 300dmg... Am I already playing in PTS lol
---
Ummm....Atlas is still going on?
---
That's awesome, maybe I should be the bad guy one of these days and run that bounty up to the moon and see what happens.
---
Its just gona look for one and put you in the same one you were.
---
yea, that thing can fuck right off, that fucking santa anamatronic was bad enough, now this?
---
no
---
True
---
Also, that event in particular is hard to get to people because there is so much stuff in the way and the spawns will stagger you and slow you down.
---
This is a  problem with RPGs and mmos in general. Nothing you do seems relevant. Having the world react to you more and recognise your accomplishments would go very far for immersion.
---
I snapped up that mirror ball plan like it was a tasty meat week critter!
---
Now we're back to finding him wandering the wasteland with his precious two-headed companion.
---
Grahm...until we meet again old friend.
---
\*laughs in not-bloody build*
---
You just got unlucky, I got the tenderizer plan in my first run, but never got another one and didn't got any mod plan nor the tato salad recipe in the other like 25 runs I did. :( I just need one more recipe for the 80 atoms challenge.
---
But he gave you a 3* drop at the end when your escaped right?
---
It does make it really hard to kill someone if they pop a bunch at once.
---
Haha, noted
---
It‚Äôs a skill-less noob weapon that makes lag-piles. 
---
What else is there to understand?
---
I assume that's *no mounted heads. Sounds great. So the first run of treasure hunter was really just an unfulfilling expensive way to drain all the extra caps out from the heavily duped Christmas presents at the time. Glad to see they are turning into a full fledged unique reward pool now. Wish they would have done something unique for the Atlas donor provisions since they clearly understand recycled garbage loot pool isn't appealing.
---
I hit 79 last night.  I started about three weeks ago myself after coming off a long hiatus.  I'm confident that I can catch his ship, but that's because I'm off next Tuesday and Wednesday and have plans to just go hard in the paint farming XP.  I believe in you!
---
Got paid. Welp, back to work.
---
Nice I still haven't gotten anything cursed yet
---
That's a sweet idea.
---
Not again literally spent all week doing those mole miner runs and was only missing tresure hunter outfit plan
---
I don't care. Fuck 'em. My mods make the game SO much easier to play. QoL mods are my lifeblood. Stuff to fix Bethesda's lack of foresight. Like I can type numbers into a field to set prices or buy a specific number of items instead of using the stupid slider.
---
Stuff like that is a godsend. I assume they think I am breaking the game with my mods but what would be the point of that?
---
If they don't want to use mods, it's their loss. It's like 90% of the reason I play games on PC. Ultimate customization.
---
40 Earls killed, 0 bugs but lots of lag and artifacting near the center of the mine boss area
---
Laughs in anti armor
---
Oh. I thought you were going to tell us something. 
---
I got one from last year and I still have it because I only have the one. Never found a good enough situation to celebrate.
---
Ok?
---
You get it:)
---
So they said it‚Äôs live on the PTS but when is it gonna drop for the rest of the platforms?
---
Nah, it was wonderful. Got the new outfit, the new backpack, the new grill, the new stein, tons of scrip, got to eat and drink... it was a rousing success.
---
oh yea, let me edit that lol.
---
can we get an F for my boy
---
Meat week is my favorite special event. Target beasts with generally good drops (shocking amount of mats and armor on all those guys!) and the cookout is just silly fun. It actually made me sad that the cookouts last weekend would max out in 30 seconds or less.
---
Does medic legendary work too for healing NPC's?
---
Whatever for?  While the Hornwrights actions might have been somewhat unethical, they were clearly legal.  on the other hand, Earl and his friends decided to get drunk and then go steal supplies and equipment from the mine...which is both unethical and illegal.
---
Now granted, the mine entrance was going to be sealed so you could argue that they weren't stealing so much as salvaging.  And it was a fellow named Deke Sykes that sealed the mine without bothering to make sure it was empty.
---
Just doesn't seem to me that Penelope is particularly responsible.  Her father set up the deal and gave the speech, the town counsel were too blinded by greed to be properly cautious, Earl went on a drunken crime spree and Deke Sykes violated (well, probably...in Fallout who knows what the state of things is) health and safety regulations to Hell and back by blasting without verifying the mine was empty.
---
Every time I showed up it completed almost instantly. Never actually "participated" besides standing there waiting for everything to load in, or banging on the drums if I showed up early
---
Wait? You're selling them for that much? I put the outfits,  2 grills and 2 backpack for 1k and no buyers.
---
Curses! All I got was a cursed shovel!
---
No offense, but those prices are outrageous.
---
Or it's just RNG.
---
20% more sponge...Sponge Earl Nopants
---
Basically just means a QoL build. It is either QoL perks are just an assortment of random stuff and hasn‚Äôt been optimized to be a combat build. 
---
It got the term For players who focus on resource management(such as maintains food supplies) is, pvpers. Many players will use it as an insult because it‚Äôs basically implying they‚Äôre fodder.
---
Lol. I read it once and said dear god no not again. Then reread it and knew what it meant. Haha.
---
Earle is a disgrace to all proud cannibals everywhere. His event is great, but that guy needed to be put down.
---
Yes this has been a problem for some time. They need to fix the displays again
---
Just means a QoL build
---
Well guess they changed it there used to be the pods and the blooms when you pick a bloom you used to get a swamp plant also.
---
I didn‚Äôt get the plan :/ plenty of everything else though
---
says you
---
Just means a QoL build be optimized laodouts
---
He does get put down... we constantly kill him lol
---
Just means they‚Äôre a QoL build
---

---
I keep this post bookmarked because it really helped me get started.
---
Thank god there's no mounted heads
---
That's totally fair. Heck, even something small like the cheering sounds you get during Monster Mash would give a celebratory touch.
---
There is a room behind an inaccessible door at the entrance. That door opens after killing Earle. There is 50 caps and a bunch of ore and random loot, ammo boxes, as well as ballistic fiber stuff on the shelves. If you don‚Äôt need acid or springs then it is worth hitting the loot room.
---
Someone that hasn‚Äôt optimized their loadout. Usually has lots of QoL perks
---
Wasted potential!
---
Since its magic anyway just save the flux
---
Sure hope so. One star drop really cheapens the supposedly ‚Äòendgame‚Äô bosses and make all efforts look silly.
---
Glad I got to trade a fixer plan for tenderizer plan and last night last one before bed so I can goto work in morning. It was 12 midnight eastern us time I saw that wonderful plan meat tenderizer show up. And being I know a lot of ppl didn‚Äôt get it. I now have a decent plan to trade. But wish it was longer
---
Curses are like a % reward you always get a 3* wep or armor before you get a cursed wep/helmet or plan
---
yes no maybe?
---
&gt; Did any PC players reading this actually receive 'Plan: Meat Tenderizer' or 'Recipe: Tato Salad?
---
I play on PC. Got one single plan for the weapon (which I used on myself, so no spares).
---
Didn't get the salad recipe, which I didn't care for anyway because that salad kills me when I eat it, lol.
---
same here now...
---
COOOOONGRATULATIONS!!!!!

 Thanks for the thought. The community is good so im sure if I Vendor search or post on market ill find one. Were getting a second helping so ill probably wait til then and use all my scrip on mama mur
---
we dont have a date, obviously sometime after patch 22 goes live.
---
bethesda has said before that its an event that they can turn on whenever, its all just serverside values that get switched on/off.
---
sometime in late September or October i would guess.
---
60 sec is the killer and you can even lie there forever and can‚Äôt respawn (happened to me today)
---
Cool bean, gracias!
---
It's one of the next things for atlas so it's getting everyone ready
---
Nice
---
But your interpretation of what counts as a week is wrong. That is not the socially established and acceptable idea of a week. 
---
If a store runs a said for a week, you don‚Äôt expect to have access to shop 168 consecutive hours. The sale doesn‚Äôt start at 12:01 am. 
---
And while this is a 24 hour game, you aren‚Äôt guaranteed playability always. Same with limited time events. Your given a time to participate on 7 consecutive days. That‚Äôs what they gave.
---
And my husband works in HR with Unions, he read your statement and laughed because he said it‚Äôs not true at all.
---
First event I joined a team and when we went the first day it went live it was just me and 3 of my team mates. We killed earl around 18 minutes left. I said man that was easy then next one same thing if not quicker but had 8 ppl. Third event that day we almost did not complete it. 6 minutes left I got out of power armor being I‚Äôm a bloodied commando and we shredded him with literally a minute left. Hardest fight we had in the four I got to do so far
---
A subtitle perhaps?
---
Oh it‚Äôs the absolute worse! I just dont understand the reasoning lol like why.
---
Yeah. It is also what‚Äôs responsible for people not completing colossal problem. Nothing like being 20 seconds into a 30 second timer when the event completes.
---
Exactly this, it's so weird.
---
In your live test you didn't have bloody mess equipped, but on PTS you had it equipped.
---
It seems rifleman, gunslinger, nerd rage, bloody mess, adrenal reaction, bloodied and convert operative are now added up but headshot is still a multiplier
---
so the calculation should be:
---
live: base damage \* 1.6 \* 1.6 \* 1.2 \* 1.15 \* 1.5 \* 1.8 \* 2.5 \* 2
---
PTS: base damage \* (1 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.5 + 0.8 + 1.5) \* 2
---
It seems the inconsistent damage you experienced is caused by different DR values on the super mutants. On live super mutant don't have any armor, but on PTS each super mutant type has different DR ... could be a side effect of "One Wasteland".
---
I got a week before earl came a VFFR Ultracite Gatling Laser from whitespring. At the time I was amused over it. Now I thank God for it. Whenever I pull it out winning against earl is granted.
---
I mean if you have a big enough friends list, you just join someone's world.
---
Bit of a workaround but my friends list is huge (almost all from trading)
---
So... 65 then?  About +130%... before pure XP bonuses. 
---
But, yeah, *no way you had 60+*, lol.
---
40 bash, 50 limb, 33 vats is the best if u wanna melt things like a magician
---
It‚Äôs really not a ah shucks thing more of a what to do after or when someone completes it.  Again like you we did know but I‚Äôm not saying it as a complaint more of a do more so ppl don‚Äôt shut the game down type of thing.
---
They only spawn during a specific quest stage of An Organic Solution. If you see them, someone had a toon intentionally stuck on that stage to spawn them. Once spawned, they stay until the server closes.
---
Can't argue with this. Ran it last night with a V2525 Gatling Laser, I couldn't even see my health drop except when Earle got whiny. When he died, I had to leap over all the Earle Juniors that had gathered around me to actually move.
---
I just think it sucks that its 1 per log and not totally of wood gathered
---
Yea apparently it‚Äôs the same bug carried over from SBQ to Encryptid and now Colossal.
---
Yeah I getcha. Bloodied unarmed build here. No PA so those wendigo‚Äôs really mess you up. 
---
Having to wait 30+ seconds definitely sucks and takes out a lot of enjoyment, but if that wasn‚Äôt the case earl would be dead a lot sooner. I suppose it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs makeshift way of balancing bloodied with this patch. 
---
I assume bloodied will be in a much worse place come patch 22, because doing far less damage while also being ridiculously squishy, while also having an hour long respawn time doesn‚Äôt sound very beneficial at all. 
---
A little bit heartbroken because the word is bloodied melee has been hit the hardest, but hopefully Beth can compensate with updated cards.
---
It's still easy to single tap the trigger even with automatic. So I can still conserve ammo for long range sniper kills but throw alot of lead downrange in close combat.
---
I have a B/33vats/25lvc Gat plasma, is that magic?
---
Yeh it's weird how it works, he seems to be weaker after he's regenerated and his health is below 50%, almost like he's wearing Vanguard armor lol. I changed up to full health as all previous have been bloodied, didn't do a much damage but svae the 2 guys a few times. Didn't get any decent rewards, I want the mask now, a mate offered me one but I want to earn it haha.
---
Did anyone get a double of the tenderizer plan ?? Just curious to see if ppl got doubles or more
---
What's your in game name? I can help you.
---
True, but not as sad as when Dom died in Gears....
---
Yea i think nights should be scarier too. It used to look like late afternoon on a rainy day lol, now it‚Äôs already a lot better but still too bright and peaceful.
---
Would have thought that was a logical feature from the beginning but 2 "fixes" later and we're still not there yet.
---
No you need over 200 firerate, plasmas cant go that fast, and energy weapons dont work that well, minigun and lmg are the best for magic or the Gauss minigun
---
I didn't even play yesterday. First day in a LONG time to not play. Felt weird, but freeing lol. 
---
Just downloaded the PTS so I have something to do.
---
Yeaaaah and idk if anyone else experienced this but I made sure to make all the best choices and everyone still called me a dick
---
Oh okay, i think i have a B/33 gauss minigun... and what about a AAE minigun?
---
It doesn't have to be That Gun or even like That Gun. Just that it would be nice to see more calibres for pistols, and that's a start players would recognize.
---
Nope. No way lol not possible. Lol
---
It doesn't look like anyone responded to you. I have the plan, and would be happy to make it in exchange for the scrap.
---
Every time I talked to him a different plan for my CAMP, so very happy.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just fun when you can complete it with not many ppl. And yeah I got offered the mask for the tenderizer plan I got dropped on last meat cook off I did before bed. I already have one being I traded a fixer plan for it on Saturday. But I wanna earn it. So far I got the rug, meat pile, cursed harpoon and then the head statue.
---
Why does the time differ? Does it get longer the more times you die? I had a 10 sec right at the end the other day, by the time I respawned and jumped down into the mine the event finished just in time for the rocks to fall on my head, killing me and respawning me outside the mine, unable to loot the root. And taking rads
---
When the most enticing reward is the angler plushie...
---
You're on ps4?
---
I'll do you one better - who is Earle Williams?
---
Right like when you craft ammo its the ammo count not the times you craft
---
Fuck I completed that ages ago üíÄüíÄ
---
I was wondering how One Wasteland was on the PTS. Hopefully you enjoy it. From what I understand the damage is calculated differently that multiplying currently.
---
Floor decor,  the same block as the gorilla statues if u have those.
---
[When I see people downvoting this comment.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/574/Screen_Shot_2017-11-06_at_12.41.31_PM.png)
---
Definitely wait outside the mine until the countdown ends and you see the event complete notification.  If you fast travel more than maybe 100 feet away from the mine entrance you will leave the event.
---
My controller shuts off after a few minutes even when doing everything listed above.
---
You didn‚Äôt respawn in the other Fallouts, you just died and had to reload your save. The respawn timer has been like that since launch as far as I can tell, every death the timer seems to increase so if you die less you respawn faster, I think they just want dying multiple times in a row to have consequences since our characters magically come back to life all the time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Are you on Xbox one? I did a similar strategy as a level 20 something, but I just circled with a bloodied weapon, it held ugly‚Äôs attention while everone else iced him and the spwans, I doubt I was your huckleberry tho
---
I was there too, but AFK at the drums.
---
Sun? What is a sun?
---
Maybe that was hyperbole but mine lasts a bit longer than that with improved repair kits from SBQ and 3 gunsmith
---
I love how the critters just sit in a circle and wait for us, god they know how to make things easy.
---
The Gauss should be doing pretty good if you get fire rate to 200 or more, the AAE I think if you have 200 fire rate and reduced limb damage armor you can pull it off, I never tried doing it with just limb armor but apparently that works, it could even work for your friend minigun that u were asking about
---
Stack all the +XP things you can get your hands on and grind that XP repeatable
---
I think you can catch it if you get all the extra weekly, daily and some extra XP. I was 10 levels behind last Sunday and now I'm just one behind it.
---
Actually, after thinking about it some more you‚Äôve changed my mind. Finishing faction dailies and even earning small amounts of scrip feels almost ‚Äúbetter‚Äù because of the tiny animations that pop up. I know it‚Äôs just my dumb primate brain liking shiny things but it feels so much more congratulatory. Maybe they‚Äôll change it for Armor Ace!
---
I changed some on how I play - definitely more often, but I found I could grind the weeklies on the weekend and just focus on doing most of the dailies each day. But I'm still far short of the end - I only got to the 3rd section. I'm hoping to do a few more levels before the bitter end.
---
The hell is the brotherhood gonna do with all that glass? Give it back to us in a green house set in some armor ace boardgame or something.
---
I had to buy a special Xbox branded cable before mine would stop doing that. That could be your issue.
---
If you still need to transfer I can add you and let you use my private server but I won‚Äôt be on until 10:45-11pm EST
---
I feel like people sleep on that mod. I've kept a missle launcher because it only weighed 6 pounds, my gauss rifle is 90% weight, super sledge..couple armor pieces..i love it. Especially when its paired with +1 strength
---
You running around like crazy?
---
How‚Äôd you join their private world? My friend has fallout 1st but I don‚Äôt. Was their world set to invite only?
---
Thanks a lot bro!
---
Think you need a jet pack before you can put one on that,since excavator armour shouldn't have a jet pack
---
Exactly, I sure as shit wasn‚Äôt going to do it. I knew better from reading pc players. I was scared that one time I wasn‚Äôt in power armor and I had only a little bit being I am bloodied but I got in it right before because I know I would‚Äôve died and not been able to fast travel in zone and lost out on my awesome meat pile plan I got from that event lol
---
are they all in the same container (Stash, your person, Scrap box)?
---
I got the plushie on my first ACP run.  I named it in honor of Earle.
---
Very bad idea. Ranks are harder to get the higher you go. If you‚Äôre still able to play, you shouldn‚Äôt be spending Atoms. Wait until the last day you are able to play, or Sunday September 6th. *That‚Äôs* when you decide if you‚Äôre going to spend the Atoms. 
---
Doing it now is like using a freebie coupon on a $4 Wendy‚Äôs value meal when you could wait until later to use it on $80 steak &amp; lobster dinner.
---
Not to mention we know why those players use it - it's all about tagging as many enemies for XP for themselves. They don't give a fuck if the event succeeds or not, just so long as their get their XP and loot.
---
I wish the plushie was as big as the sheepsquash one
---
That is a funny side effect of that one lol. I find I can eat it once but twice is risky and three times is certain death
---
I you are playing on PC, there are reshaders that alter the visuals.  I believe you can make the game darker by adjusting the shader presets.  Mind you, it affects daylight and artificial light too but you could set the shader to be quite dark and only turn it on (it can be toggled with a key press) to approximate what you're looking for.
---
Of course, this would only affect your game.  For everyone else it would be unchanged.  If you want to force other people to put up with it just because you like it...well...perhaps not?
---
You have to pick up 180 world items for things to respawn
---
Im down I have all the mods too
---
I‚Äôm hoping with Daily Ops as a repeatable mission that will be the start. I also wish they had seasonal goals in additional to weekly. Maybe give back the dailies to people who want to grind for atoms.
---
Yeah well that was a great perk about fallouts before, you‚Äôd die instantly and just spawn at your last save
---
Yep.
---
Yes, 1 shot with 4 balls.
---
But only using one ammo?
---
Ah I see I thought it was just a timed thing like every 24 hours or so
---
I get the bug where the location indicator on the hud is actual pointing at the opposite direction forcing me to travel away from my intended location.
---
the grind is ridicules. It's kinda sad that after 150 tries, I still have to settle with a Weightless - AP - Breathe Underwater. The rest had even worse combinations. Got a decent Unyielding, but that's not my playstyle and can not trade it or give it to an alt.  
---
But I am glad they are adding some mods to Secret Service Armor, although I agree ever choice has benefits and drawbacks. When they add all mod options, there are no drawbacks for Secret Service armor.  
---
My alts run in Marine, because of the Rad Resistance. For some reason I find radiation more annoying than being pierced by bullets.
---
You learned the jetpack plans for your PA, right? The one from the atom shop is just a skin.
---
Nah. I have no idea when or if it ever changed as i only started playing about 6 months ago
---
If you already had the helmet from the Captain Cosmos bundle a while back (orange outfit, helmet, bed, alien blaster skin and Invader), is this any different?
---
I was hoping this version wouldn't cover your hair or have colors that match the outfits, but unless I'm missing something it's just the same item and it still removes facial hair...
---
it's punishment for dying. 
---
best way to counter it is not to die.
---
yeah, it seems puny when next to the sheepsquatch
---
Gt?
---
Considering the Tenderizer is 20 lbs without Perks or legendary effects, I can't justify carrying one without it.
---
Yeah, I am.  Doubtful through because this person kept running up with just a pitchfork.  It was wild, I was impressed but it ended badly for them.  We just had it drop, everyone got in the first instance except my husband and I and 1 level 9 who showed up.  We decided to bail when no one else showed up and the level 9 jumped down.  My husband and I weren't on nice so I inboxed that it would be too much for 3 of us, and sorry.  I felt so bad they came by my camp after (I'm right by the mine) and I have them a bunch of stuff.  They were super cool and took over my workshops when I logged out.  üíú
---
Start looking into builds I would recommend bloodied or junkies, from there organize your special, at lvl 80 or so you should have your ideal deck
---
To get really immersed in the story, I don't recommend playing with friends.  It was hard to follow the main quests' stories with friends screaming that they needed help with a Deathclaw or listening to them tell me about the junk they just scrapped.
---
Man I got sooooo many treasure notes from this
---
Did you do the quest of the syringer? Maybe you still have it active and needs to be completed.
---
Character slot 2-5 is your best friend
---
EncryptHeart579 oh and what's up dog?
---
Oh lord no. I bench weapons when they get like that lol
---
Nothing much, what's up with you?
---
Tbh id rather kill myself than start this game again lol.
---
Should only be a 24 hour communication ban, had something similar happen to me a while back and unfortunately there was no was to counter it.
---
That would work too. I'm paranoid BGS won't respec base damage at all or  just boost it a couple points. The MG42 was done correctly, but the laser boost was garbage (due to legacy explosive damage).
---
Ok Dutch
---
Tell me that thing doesn't look like a Murloc?
---
This whole game is one big missed opportunity :D
---
We do get a second helping of Meat Week though as an Atlas Reward....
---
Yea just logged onto xbox to check. Got an email that just said suspended so freaked out a bit.
---
What‚Äôs a QoL build?
---
I thought completion of BoS collecting was gunna trigger an extra week of meat week
---
Depression üòéüëä
---
That stuff falling down is my new worse enemy.
---
I won't  be on till 4:30 pst which is 7:30 est I think.
---
I have 5 nuke cards myself and can solo the run.  Down to make a friend or two if you want to add me on ps4 and make some runs happen when I'm on.
---
Chaos_Algorithm is my psn.
---
And remeber folks don't feed the Yao-Gui Arwooooooo, Never seen a ghoulish one before ??
---
There needs to be something to persuade you to try not to die. Dying is supposed to be something you try to avoid. The respawn timer is there to give you a reason not to die.
---
If you prefer you could ask Beth to make you lose an increasing amount of caps per death instead.....
---
You answered yourself. The obvious drawback is that you have to keep rolling until you get a half decent piece. You can't trade for it, you have only 3 rolls a day. It takes months to get something that isn't nocturnal 1*. That's it. The endgame. I think that deserves all the mods and then some.
---
Yes i have because ive built the jet pack before its just i wanted the other color for it
---
B33 gauss minigun is obscene, I just soloed Earle earlier in ~20 seconds with mine. I was running full perks and a Big Guns bobblehead, but still it's incredibly broken.
---
This is also bad for the unique weapons. I don't know how many there are, but I remember seeing one that just had a name that I didn't recognize. I couldn't tell at all what it was, so I had to look it up to see it was a melee weapon that I had no interest in.
---
Same iv been on for about a month or two and it was just frustrating to keep respawning and not seeing any of the normal spawns from Morgan hs and fort defiance
---
Quack Surgeon, dying was never an option.
---
That Calmex had me seein visions
---
Ahhh I am actually having that issue. I bought the only plug and play target has and it's some off brand crap. Even when it's plugged in it turns off. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting better results for my AFKing efforts. Seemed to only make it through one hour (3 meat cleavers) both days I tried. Now it makes sense.
---
Repair cost is cheap if you use the repair kits from the queen.
---
Aslong as they keep in the ability to cripple Earl the event is my new awakening.
---
I don't know how I managed to mess up every attempt at the event (not that I could try it that many times, mind you), glad you had such a good time, be glad because it happened my friend!
---
Quality of life. So lockpicking, green thumb, reduces hunger. Perks that don‚Äôt increase your combat skills at all but just make gameplay less tedious
---
Yep, that one alone could check off half you list everyday. And chewing gum, eating pre-war food, buying and selling aren't hard or time consuming.
---
let me know when I am not great at launching nukes and I have no mic so just tell me what you want and I will do it
---
yall be sounding like a bunch of foodbuilds.
---
I have a perfect solution for you:
---
Stash your junk next time.
---
Problem solved.
---
It increases with each death. In my few runs it seems like you get 3-4 deaths where it‚Äôs a short timer and then it starts adding like 20 seconds each time.... I have no science just recalling how my few runs have gone
---
I will gladly accept!
---
Yeah that could be your issue. I just used one from amazon, but it doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of the server kicking me out after about 3-4 hours.
---
psn?
---
I made a post a week or so ago throwing out ideas for buffs/nerfs but it barely got any attention and mostly downvotes, lol. I guess poeple only want to hear complaining and not constructive thinking. I had the same idea for Mutants! A lot of prefixs need buffs for sure.
---
Mmhrmmmnhrmm?
---
I buy the screws when im at vendors whether I need them or not, and I've never run out if them. If you hit the surface to air batteries a few times a week, you wont have to buy fiber.
---
It's cheap af already, I'm suggesting it gets a nerf and be more expensive. The fact that there are repair kits form the queen or atom shop shouldn't really play a role. It's endgame armor and should have endgame upkeep costs.
---
I‚Äôll check that out and see if it helps
---
He actually said something before he disappeared.  It was like "Music time ended.  Now time for trade!", then he disappeared.  It was a neat little detail.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child...
---
Well it wasnt much that I‚Äôm sad to lose. It‚Äôs just what he did that pisses me off. And the fact that he reported me and now I have a communication ban.
---
I‚Äôd rather lose caps than have the timer honestly
---
Damn i bought the mirror ball and radiation emmitor because they were cheap and sounded cool, didnt realizes they were so sought after lol
---
that was exactly what I was talking about so let's add one
---
The first time I ran it I died 3/4 times and never got the timer, the second time I got 10 seconds on the 3rd death.
---
How about make the new grills play the Meat Week song.
---
Please.
---
Awww I think the radiation emitter was the one thing I couldn‚Äôt find lol
---
Ditto
---
It‚Äôs just absolutely not needed tho lol.
---
I love the new grill and I'm loving the collectable steins.
---
Welp, the damage dealers got their eyes on the target most times. But when i check for spawns and see someone down i pause firing my rounds and sprint over there. Ramming in that big shot is somehow very satisfying.
---
Earl gave me a one star double shot pipe pistol! XD
---
I worked into a stealth character so I wouldn't spend half my time hunting for lead and acid. It worked great, now I'll be doing it again. Just hope BGS is serious about balancing so it's not as bad.
---
sorry to burst your bubble but there probably wont be shadowed SS.  shadowed mod is for light weight armors, SS armors are considered heavy and typically dont have that mod.  i mean anything is possible but dont hold your breath.
---
Don‚Äôt bother messaging people who pull that shit, just report them immediately.  Also remember his gamer tag, seek him out, and nuke his camp every time you see him on.  üòà 
---
Sorry you got such a dick in your party.
---
I suggest getting an explosive gun with a relatively fast fire rate and go to line in the sand. With the glitch spawn you can get exp credit for 80‚Ä∞ of the kills or more and a single event playthrough adds up, especially if in an events group and you toss in lunchbox madness that was common during the season.
---
Recently meat week has been a popular level up due to the large numbers of high level cryptids you fight. Again, this is why I dumped bloodied in most prime meat events and just used my explosive two shot gatling. It's perfect for swarm events, both in kill credits and still respectable for damage with a skill card respec.
---
Lamp 
---
Nothing else...just Lamp
---
People are patching roofs with toothpaste now?
---
maybe
---
Death bags and dropped loot bags are separate.
---
There is no reason I would use a 50% damage boost from Slayer's over 80-95% damage boost from bloodied . Honestly,  they should be double damage instead of 50% and berserkers should be triple (just fix the ability to equip armor while broken)  .
---
I forgot about the Halloween event!! &lt;3 We should be getting a 2nd helping of Meat Week, though, to fill in the gap between now and then.
---
Death in this game has no consequence usually. Now it does.
---
I wish I had the time. Oh well. I‚Äôm glad to hear that some people made it.
---
have a word with yourself, man. give ya head a wobble.
---
Probably a couple DC'd while in the instance.  I don't like the instancing setup they have either, but then I don't have problems killing earl solo so doesn't matter to me if there are others in there or not.
---
Vampires isn‚Äôt good for damage so consider getting a new gat laser
---
Same, finally got that mirror ball. Plus a couple extra plans for it for my vendor
---
that's less than 1% of our community. Most of us are wave and thumbs up folks. We hate those bawbags just as much if not more than you.
---
It's delightful. I hope to find it in some creepy CAMPs come Halloween.
---
He loves the mountains
---
What is a ‚Äúfood build‚Äù
---
omg yes, i hate having like 60+ rounds left in a plasma and then suddenly POP
---
Meat-Many-Days
---
I can also give you one, or more, if you need it.
---
I don't have the caps for that yet but I've got 100+ screws and ballistic fiber so I'm good to go
---
I‚Äôm confused by this post. Of course their are mods. Just scrap them to learn plans, they are a super common weapon.
---
Really? I‚Äôve drummed on a rad barrel at someone‚Äôs settlement before so maybe it‚Äôs an old atom item or they somehow built around one in the world
---
Its lame that you have to be in teams.
---
Maybe I have bad luck or something, but I‚Äôve been encountering loot stealing people a lot recently, and high levels too. Just not as bad as today recently. The extent they‚Äôd go for 5 wood scraps is amazing to me
---
food build, YUCK!
---
We get to do it again in a month remember
---
Gamepass on xbox...sorry bro.
---
I said communist PA
---
thank u
---
It's actually both, whatever gets fulfilled first. Either you wait 22hrs or pick 180 other items.
---
Yea this is a huge one for me.  If i have to run rad armor then im just not going to do sbq
---
Yeah I think the possibility of that Sentry Bot turning Ra-Ra into swiss cheese was a missed opportunity......
---
Death should have consequences.
---
These don't bother me. In Helvetia behind the restaurant is a small roofed area with a lot of chopped wood. There you can collect about 10 at once. :)
---
I meant like mods that you just slap on, like under the 'Mods' section of your inventory.
---
i dont understand why you'd want to gimp your dmg with vampire weapons for such a timed event.  theres more then one way to heal then stimpack (which sucks in combat with the clunky animation in nonPA build).  stock up alot of nuka cola, food, glowing meat etc and hotkey it.  soon as the dmg comes in, you start spamming it.  i use this food SPAM method to survive even a direct assaultron laser hits which is WAY more then anything earle can dish out.  take it from me, try my suggestion out.
---
FYI if earle or imposter insta kills you, then you need to rethink your bloodied build.  if you can be bloodied but take atleast a few hits then you can use my method to survive most big hits no problem.
---
I just picked up a bloodied weightless ultracite Gatling laser at a player vendor to use at events. Only 2 lbs. works great. Don‚Äôt have to use my precious 45s on bullet sponge bosses
---
praise Chally
---
I just glad we have a boss that my shotgun can hit without having to wait 5 minutes for something to land.
---
My mule evolved into a food build. Eventually it became a hybrid with heavy weapon. It was more to challenge myself, since my tank/unarmed build was too OP and my gunslinger has difficulty with end game.
---
Damn, go rub one out and chill.
---
They apparently changed the damage system so damage buffs on bloody/junky, etc builds are additive not multiplied. 
---
Basically you won't find stuff as powerful as before depending on what build you had. and if I'm not mistaken Bloodied suffered the worst of it.
---
Thanks for the headsup!
---
I've never had this happen. I do notice a lull in the action but I think it's because everyone got stomped for a bit, but the action picks up and everyone finishes.  I hope that what you're saying is not the future of this event. Maybe this is just lag?
---
Nah, not trollin, they‚Äôre just incompetent AF.
---
Over the years i sold and threw out way too many of those vampire weapons and now i regret it. BUT the only one i kept was my VE25 Laser rifle (because legacy ofc). I didn't test it yet with my bloodied char but i hope it keeps me alive well.
---
Never hopefully.
---
Had the same problem on PS4, what it seems to be working at least for me is log in to any other online game wait for a minute or two then come back to fallout and it works, idk how or why ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I want one thats grey like a swat officer kinda deal or one that isn't so glossy
---
Im in bed as it's just after midnight here, but, if you're still willing I will hop on tomorrow if you can make it?
---
Raider vendor at whitesprings has them for sale.
---
All I see are bloody builds honestly. Lame tbh. I just have what I like.
---
Why?
---
I'd like a slider for this.
---
I have nothing against real dark nights, but when the real sun is shining like crazy, the night is too dark for me w/o puling the curtains closed.
---
That's weird because it's been almost 48 and the items are still not there üòí
---
Yeah, lmk if that worked. Just completed them as I'm still a novice in this game too, even though I'm level 107. XD
---
Rose's quest is kind of tedious as you need to go from A to B then to C and D, then to E and F and again to A and B, but I think you haven't completed it.
---
I hear you‚Äôre a person of faith.  Do you happen to have any tenderizer mod plans, fellow brahmin of the flock?
---
If he was playing at launch, he probably didn't know bloody or junky are meta now (nor that they are to be nerfed soon along with all multiplicative effects)
---
OP, your black powder crit build is not viable. Crit builds are not strong.
---
My advice for you is to go to the top of this sub, and type in "best builds" then get reading. If you have been away for a long time, you have so much to catch up on that most answers here may just confuse you more.
---
Nice ill have to start going there. When its only 20 logs it isn't bad but I've seen it be 100 logs which is rough. If it was a total collection of wood rather than one per log it wouldn't even phase me xD
---
They could also cap bloodied at 50%
---
Same.......
---
Man I opened this post thinking" i'm gonna reply hopefully never",and your post was there. Brilliant.
---
That's a good point.
---
Nukes too obvious. Explosive bait ftw. Go to town on it.
---
We've already got plenty. For the first 8 months or so, those were pretty much the only FO1st exclusives.
---
That's not true. There is shadowed mod for heavy leather. What you meant to say was there is no shadowed for armor that has only 1 class, and not 3 classes like light/sturdy/heavy. And that would be correct. Someone already pointed that out.
---
RNG and chance just does this sometimes.  It‚Äôs human nature to try and make order from chaos, but it‚Äôs just random.  Sometimes you get ‚Äúlucky‚Äù streaks, but you can‚Äôt forget about the 1000 ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù rolls you had before that.
---
That being said, some servers are definitely hotter than others for legendary enemies, but I don‚Äôt take three similar drops in a row to mean anything, considering the other 997 pieces of random junk I got before that.
---
That info is literally not in game anywhere. Probably my most hated thing about this game? You want info? Hell no! Go google/reddit it.
---
That isn‚Äôt the case as far as i know... if they changed it it‚Äôs news to me
---
I'm getting downvoted because I'm trying to tell people that their group will at least need a decent build to be able to do ACP after the nerf.
---
I'm just waiting for the complaint posts about how they can't complete it when the time comes.
---
We got like 2 the desert one and the elite one i missed both
---
Meat week is back in sept
---
My total investment in this game is like $30 for 2 accounts so I could play with a friend. I got it during the worst of the hate and Beth was practically giving the game away. Never bought any caps nor fallout 1st.
---
Ive spent double that on games I spent far less time playing. I have my money's worth 10x over.
---
Same here. There was a player on each drum and cooking spit. We all thought we were experiencing the last one but then everything just vanished.
---
a food build is someone who sucks at pvp and gets all salty when they die at workshops. They are called foodbuilds because they are food for my handmade.
---
Just go to the lumber yard area. Got all 25 wood there in less then 2 mins
---
Lone Wanderer is dead. R I P
---
Slow firing weapons are disadvantaged now so commando or rapid firing heavies are popular.
---
I mean that‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôd use it but it‚Äôs terrifying with that smile.
---
To be a full week today should be the last day, we got 6 days not a week. :(
---
It should work the way you said to be a full week, from Thursday 20 10am to Thursday 27 10am, but well we knew the dates.
---
It helps a little, but you still take quite a bit of damage from fire.  I‚Äôm hoping the legendary fire resist card will be more effective.
---
I had a weird encounter today too but not that bad. After Graham from meatweek packed up and left I went to a camp next to vault 76 to shop around and the owner was commenting on my combat level and said that I was going to get raped, I decided not to buy anything and changed server. Probably my first weird experience and I'm level 106 lol
---
No facial hair in space
---
I went at level 40 and got chewed up. Didn‚Äôt go back until 90 and plenty of stims lol
---
Where do u think ward's osmosis kits come from? ü§£
---
With a 2.27% chance of getting the plan you had a 90% chance of getting one in 100 events. Bad luck but not unrealistically bad.
---
Ahhh damn, timing mismatch. I‚Äôm on pacific time and work the early shift. I can usually get on by 3pm PST if you can manage that... otherwise the weekend is an option!
---
Fuckkkk
---
Gears is trash
---
Why do most people call him Graham instead of Grahm?
---
That doesnt help. Its a skin. What actual PA are you using.
---
It was this way since beta. There are several posts here that collaborate this, "where to farm all the things" .)
---
1. Increase their damage resistance to a flat % around 70 to 90.
---
2. Let their claws pierce armor just like Gutsy and Super Mutants do.
---
3. Add back their ability to pick up and slam or rip players apart.
---
4. Turn single spawns into at least a pack of 3 spawns.
---
ive run the event on the pts a few times now. its not fun even with optimized teams. its just sponge and wasted bullets to get another cursed harpoon gun.
---
FEV Creature from fallout 2. I wonder if they‚Äôll be showing up since we‚Äôre getting a plush...
---
I hate that I can't reload if I'm taking damage or an enemy looks at me wrong, but the damage it does is worth the headache
---
Seems like an oversight to not include this
---
Sounds like a near perfect time.
---
Anytime. You can have 5.
---
Some might tell you just to keep leveling and to start changing your focus after 50.
---
But if you like alts, just make a new one with that focus in mind.
---
Example:
---
main is power armor melee and shotguns (who cares about sneaking shotguns? People not in power armor)
---
2nd char is non power armor, all stealth and rifles
---
3rd is Power armor and heavy guns
---
4th is Junkie fist weapons only
---
5th is automatic rifles.
---
Do what makes you happy.
---
Mate I only need 1000 more logs for the 7600 challenge....and it only took me 2400 hours!
---
no....i just learned in this thread that he has special plans during meat week. üòî
---
I havnt had this happen yet but I do 2/3 of his total hp myself so ...maybe work on your build some.
---
But collecting 100 logs is a weekly, right? I Havn't seen that as a daily. There are probably many more places where you can find similar quantaties of log piles. I tend to take a quick hike through the forest area, there is a loot of wood to colelct there (who would have guess'd that huh? ;) )
---
Have you tried clearing the cache from your Xbox?
---
Not a troll. They just straight dgaf
---
Never use profanity on xbox live msg
---
Nice! Looks cryptically awesome
---
I play stealth commando (not bloodied tho) and with the Chinese Stealth Suit I can just hang out in a corner and get sneak attack damage almost the whole time. Unless I get hella unlucky and get feared but haven‚Äôt had problems getting back into stealth yet. It‚Äôs a very good idea tho.
---
Wow, what?
---
I found that area on my first play through when I was just level 5 or so. I didn‚Äôt even know about resource mining until much later, I‚Äôve been at that same area ever since. I‚Äôm level 104 now
---
Holy cow props to you
---
I have a crap ton of pipe gun mods and plans. You want the plans so if you decided to change the modifications on it, you don't lose the ability to rebuild it that way. Im more than willing to give you them.
---
All good! Messages can be misinterpreted so context is important lol. I got my butt handed to me last night by a glowing deathclaw lvl60, 2 legendary glowing wolves lvl55, and a glowing wendigo lvl 65.... I was in a blast zone btw lol and in a hazmat suit. Im trying a sneaky medic sort of character so I dont use power armor. I have alot of T45 pieces and some T51B armor pieces. I usually just sell them for rock bottom prices.  But I think its just more difficult for me without the armor lol. Im squishy up close but deadly from afar. :)
---
No from primal cuts, though. Let a raider (Rad) sell it and the chemical barrel plan, while one of the Sunnies sells the other missing instruments.
---
Nothing weird on public servers. I gave up on farming there as I had the same problems. But private worlds guarantee that YOU get the items.
---
But there are exceptions, rare loots are spawned in when a cells gets (re-)activated. Bobbleheads and rare outfits are best hunted on a full server.
---
I was attempting too but struggled and time was running out. I am still playing with my build and probably need a better gun to kill off the wendigos. Must just be my luck.
---
oh really? thanks!
---
Same! That and the poison perk are the ones I really long for
---
It‚Äôs odd they would make a plush if they aren‚Äôt returning. They might make it an enemy with Fractured Steel, similar to how the floaters made their return with Wastelanders.
---
Don't go outside, it's lagging something crazy. My news channel is stuck on a story from February!
---
Yeah its a weekly. It is probably more of I dont know where to look so everybody giving some locations will definitely help me out. I normally just go down the road from 76
---
You built foundations over the fast travel spot. Either move the foundations or move your camp. Always check the fast travel spot before you start building
---
Yeah definitely. I think it must be my luck or a console thing. Everyone just slowy started to leave but it‚Äôs understandable if its boring, lag or they don‚Äôt have the resources.
---
I also run bloodied melee and I found if I keep jumping when attacking earle is less likely to stomp my sorry ass into the ground. Pretty goofy to watch I'm sure.
---
Ash pile lag is from the lighting effect of the ash pile. Lighting is always hard on graphics cards and the Tesla makes pile and piles of independently changing light sources.
---
I've seen a post recently where another player found a few full Raider PAs in their inventory, and had no idea where they came from. This is a strange bug that's starting to pop up
---
There was a naked (undies) dude squatting in the middle of the field yesterday, apparently AFK. 
---
I‚Äôll be dammed if I didn‚Äôt stand in such a way to make the whole event NSFW
---
Just a guess, Learn T 60 jetpack
---
I didn't even think to ask, what are you playing on? I'm on PS4. ashisnotok is my PSN if you have it
---
When things do go right and you get that amazing 1v3 where they get scared of you and run off, those are the moments
---
Nice. I've had a ticket open about his for over a week
---
Iv been think about getting fo1st just to be able to farm seems like it might be worth it if this is my main game lol hell I paid 15 a month for eso when I was playing that so I might just do that as well
---
I‚Äôve only attempted it once (I think there were 4 of us total).  We didn‚Äôt make much of a dent... got him to about halfway after his mutation before time ran out.  It was such a drain on my resources and seemed like none of my weapons dented him at all.  I may try it again some other time though, I just don‚Äôt think my build is correct for squaring off against him.
---
Its only bc I'm out of work due to the pandemic and could grind during double xp. 
---
Worth the grind? Nah.
---
Aware of that but there was a post explaining that somewhere down the line this was changed to 180 in game items and 60 per container for the spawns to reset. Hence why you can no longer server hop for mat spawns
---
As usual, disappointed but not surprised by things like this
---
ah, i'm on xbox lol. thanks for the gratitude though!
---
I love this, hope I find you around!
---
ahhahaha i'd say that's cruel but i killed that sloth about 100 times in a row once for those delicious screws
---
Ra-Ra had some cringy voice lines but she doesnt deserve that!!
---
Not a bad plan, but why not help out other players and play the drums or turn the spits?
---
Damn! That sucks! Good thing I didn't clear out my stash box and vending machine! No problem!
---
Another interesting feature is that if you are in the Enclave quest line, and someone in your group runs silo and launches a nuke, you get credit and quest completion without being in the silo.   I noticed this a few nights ago on my original main that I did everything but the actual launch in the Enclave line.   A buddy in our public team launched, and I got ‚ÄúI am become death‚Äù quest completion and rewards.  Yay!
---
There's a bug that leaves you naked and targetable when you log out.
---
I'll donate my 250 and let Bethesda fudge the rest.
---
Yes!! I will rearrange a room just to do it. Its also helpful to use as a planner before I make irl home arrangements. I love decorating...
---
Moving spots is a little harder to commit to lol
---
Between my two characters (mostly did it with my level 45 melee alt) I got the flag, the Tenderizer, Salty Mod, the Grill, the outfit and head, recipe... anything I missed?
---
Sorry but there is really nothing new here.  I have seen probably 5 other posts with the same or very similar suggestions.
---
Curse of the wendigo- astonishing tales, I'll have to keep a look out for multiple copies
---
move your camp module. you spawn in a northerly direction of it
---
It likely will. 
---
I‚Äôd guesstimate the fire damage at like 30 damage per second. It only takes a couple seconds to kill my bloodied build with Fireproof and about 50hp.
---
Fireproof turns 30dps into 16.5.
---
Legendary fire resist at 50 should turn 30 DPS into like... 10.
---
Actually I think I can check this out, I‚Äôve got a few characters I haven‚Äôt played on the PTS yet, I can perk them up
---
It was in the minutes after the event finished. I of course helped by collecting greens and putting out fires.
---
That's super creepy, taking that role playing a little too far. Like if you don't want someone in your camp, don't have a vendor
---
I had 3 Graham Meat cook events.. 3.. Primal Cuts were coming fast and furious.. I cooked and dropped so much meat I'm surprised that the landscape wasn't forever changed by mutt chops, crispy crickets, radrat steaks, wolf ribs and Yao Gaui roasts...
---
With only a Chally outfit and mask as well as meat cleavers and the bloodied apron... 3 times ...
---
Was fun while it lasted, wonder what's next..
---
Yeah it was odd... there wasn't much leading up to it other than something like "your only level 106" and something about my secret service helmet being a waste of bullion, then it was just straight up " your going to get raped ". I don't even use a mic and I must have only been at his camp for like 2 minutes. Post meat week must bring out the worst in some people lol
---
Yes best the grill is the best free item ever
---
Exactly what my issues seem to have been. I end up using so much stuff and seem to do hardly anything especially when I am doing it solo. My build or weapon probably isn‚Äôt the greatest in this situation either.
---
That's good, I only get more than 2 or more levels on Tuesday due to weekly score.
---
I'm on 86, and yeah, you're pretty close, with these 500 extra daily score we'll get to 95-98-ish,we'll need to farm a lot XP for the last levels or buy them. :(
---
i can do it for free if you come to me. 
---
GT: rammadeus. camp is near top of the world
---
GT?
---
Doing the lord‚Äôs work. Thank you. I just wish I knew why there was a 3 hour limit. Maybe it kicks me off the server once my hunger and thirst bar reach zero? I just don‚Äôt know.
---
The real fanfare was the grinding we did along  the way
---
"I don't want to go..."
---
Repair things.
---
yeah, I tried that, just tried it again and it did the same thing. It synced ok, connected to the wifi, its just when it is signing it it crashes out.
---
Consider me foodie as fuck. 
---
I'm recently started swapping over to a damage build lol now it's time for the painful level grind
---
:O Never til now.
---
I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get that second helping of Meat Week if we donate enough glass during Project Bravo. So don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll participate in our favourite supermutant‚Äôs bbq again soon enough.
---
Sounds like you were being a little toxic yourself, dont get in trouble for saying hi
---
This makes me sadder than it should...
---
I sent him a wtf. That was all. Apparently wtf is too much. Lesson learned I guess lol
---
Its a bug
---
You just need the caps to get to one of the surface to air locations, then you can run across the bog to each of them on the map, not many caps required, and you might make caps in the meanwhile.
---
So does that mean the old plans will not drop?
---
I never got to do the event, people were always afking on the drums
---
2 years for real? A friend of mine just ranked a new char to level 50 in 3 days. To be fair 13 hors per day but still, he wasnt even farming that much!
---
Have you tried to load a different game, then try to reload 76?
---
Was life sized bobblehead Todd Howard the coward there with an automated voice who's laughing now *low pitched hua huh huh huh huh* without breaking a vaultboy style smile?
---
It was totally worth it for me. I chose the yearly sub, that brought it down to 10 Euros, less than what I paid for wow.
---
Now that the atoms are no longer free, it was a no-brainer for me. The 1600 atoms / month are worth 16 Euros alone. Add to that the nukes you don't share with a whole server and farm over and over (7 ws-runs is my record, for over 100 of each of the stabilizing agents. Or 2 runs on Hemlock Holes for over 1000 raw violet flux). Freeing up stash space is also quite nice, no need to choose which scrap to sell or throw away.
---
I should hit that tomorrow and I‚Äôll be good.  It was my own personal goal to make it that far.  Sad?  Maybe.
---
Best just to block and move on
---
Don't the long respawn timers happen when you die an excessive amount of times?
---
so people like me can delete a quarter of our camps and replace it with clowns
---
One thing you missed is the Safari Gorilla Backpack.
---
Dude, just scrap her. I did all the missions and scrap all the allies. Or just get the raider dude.
---
Lower your luck and collect what you want to repair, then repair it.
---
I‚Äôll DM you with my GT in a bit. I‚Äôll be on after 9 pm CST. Thanks a lot!!!!
---
My game seems to crash when i tried to do this
---
AH! Problem there is im GMT. And it's currently 00.25. And i'll be going to bed in about an hour.
---
3 tato salad plans (any point to it?)
---
2 meat tenderizer plans.
---
5 mods, all 3.
---
Several of everything else.
---
Maybe ran it 30 times? Possibly more.
---
Sold tenderizer for 20k on vendor since we're getting another meat week if we do enough turn ins.
---
On PC
---
I've seen others comment that you have to build a new torso and jetpack, but I don't have first hand knowledge
---
I know. Everyone buying up all my scrip weapons. I ain't mad shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Just saying, the self transfer isn't reliable on xbox at the current moment due to a bug.
---
SOLVED!! I didnt delete the reserve game space when I cleared out the profiles on the console the first time, but I just went back and did it and it fixed the issue. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
There are two sections: Alpha and Bravo. Alpha is done
---
I can make you one on ps4
---
Yeah the frames were ridiculously low plus I was getting extremely unlucky from the falling ember spawning on top of me. But still. The game could at least spawn me back in the mine idk why that‚Äôs too hard to ask
---
I don't give 2 shits about that project. I get better return from selling the wood to a vendor.
---
Beth will tweak the "donations" anyhows.
---
Dude playing without travelling pharmacy is just torture to me. Stims weigh a fuckin ton
---
Yeah. It's basically a punishment. Stop dying and you wont have a long respawn timer. Simples.
---
Sure!  My psn name is the same.  I‚Äôll probably be on later
---
One wasteland?
---
yeah i mean i dont think they intended for people to end up in that situation sucks to not be able to loot the boss
---
I guess I agree with you. I mean I thought there was a bigger bundle at the end but oh well. 
---
Frankly I didn't think I was done. I thought I had just got to level 99. I wasn't worrief, well, maybe a little, I wanted to finish off my weeklies in case the AC bug hit. Even though I had enough weeklies to add with today's challenges that I should be able to finish it early this morning. 
---
So i polish of a weekly, that should've took me well into 99. I get the unlock and the nothing. I wasn't expecting to be finished remember, I just was expecting more score to fill the bar. 
---
Even now, staring at the empty score bar is making me itchy.
---
Damn! I doubt I‚Äôll get on in the next hour. I‚Äôll hit you up tomorrow. I really do appreciate the help!!
---
Yes that sorry for getting the name wrong
---
Mine is same too lol I'm on eso right now so just message when you get on.
---
I don't think it was, but then again i'm not sure.  I asked for help in testing whether it would work and it did, but I still couldn't join public worlds through the social or through the xbox club afterwards.
---
Big balancing and level scaling update. Enemies will scale to you and the way weapon  perks stack has been changed.
---
It‚Äôs not guaranteed that we‚Äôre getting the second serving
---
How exactly are weapons changed?
---
An event every hour for 6 days feels like a month lol
---
Damn: and its my gf and my night for fall guys. Family first. Get me something nice ill make it worth it! (I have loads of stuffs, accidental collector)
---
Xbox one or one X?
---
Use blocker perk
---
My fusion cores keep disappearing, maybe they are filling someone else's pockets
---
I saw soo many players just spinning in circles after Grahm took the drums home with him.
---
Yeah, so far I haven‚Äôt encountered any of the problems PC players were reporting last week.
---
Jesus, people are weird sometimes, I am sorry you had that interaction
---
Junkies
---
Sorry bout 2 comments: please dm me anything that is rare. I would greatly appreciate it!
---
WTF is a "food build"!?!?!?
---
Would have been perfect if I got any good drops from it lol
---
It also said last event was at noon but it just despawned. :-/
---
There already are armor skins, like those found in the Legendary Run and nuclear winter rewards.
---
The whole ‚Äúmagic‚Äù thing is useless for most players especially when it doesn‚Äôt work on the queen, like with this gauss minigun. And with heavy guns and stabilized AA does make much of a difference in damage. The explosive projectiles kind of negate the accuracy buffs since you don‚Äôt need to be 100% accurate. Two shot is better on this gun
---
put him in the chally outfit but not the hat.  his mohawk bleeds into the back hair of the suit and it's epic.
---
The two shot one is much better than the AA. 2x extra 25% damage is good, and although two shot isn‚Äôt the greatest it‚Äôs still better than an anti armor with a non damage 2nd effect
---
Only two things I‚Äôd change in the event is 
---
1: A 30 Second Respawn Timer Cap, Because I keep dying to invisible fire and shite and 60 seconds is way too long to wait.
---
2: Removing all hazardous environmental damage spots on the ground after Earl dies. I‚Äôve played this event 10 times yesterday and only made it to the exit about 3 times because some jackass thought it would be funny to put one of the invisible fire environmental damage spots right in front of the tunnel you need to use to escape, and with the the stimpack button now being delayed if you‚Äôre a bloodied build and that touches you once you just insta die with no chance of being revived. 
---
(Oh did I mention fireproof doesn‚Äôt protect you against the FIRE spots on the ground or Molotovs? Max fireproof and I still die instantly.)
---
Other than those two glaring issues I rather like the event, it‚Äôs fun.
---
What was the issue with iron fist?
---
Got into their world. We had to join a team while on the main menu, then had them join their private server. Didn‚Äôt try a public one tho.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Metal\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_armor_(Fallout_76)) 
---
See "location" about 2/3 down the page
---
If it was that simple they‚Äôd just do it. I don‚Äôt think you understand how complicated a games coding can be, especially this one
---
And the need to reload when I get stuck zoomed in,... And the need to reload when I get stuck only able to move slowly,.... And so on...
---
I'll up vote ya, I'm mostly foodie with a PA Heavy and a Stealth Shotty perk swap out, My shotty build is already useless against Earle, and my PA Heavy currently does 10-22 damage per hit with a gatling plasma against Earle.  
---
Against the SBQ its a fair-good build and  I can just about solo the Queen, but its really difficult dealing with the swarms as well,  When this nerf comes into effect I won't have a prayer of doing the Queen never mind Earle without drastically changing my build specs.
---
Idk if I was doing it wrong or what but me and my buddy tried doing the thing where one person stays with vendor bot while the other leaves the server to come back and get new stock except when we did it his stock never changed, it stayed the same each time we logged back in to the server so I think Bethesda patched out the ability to farm him :(
---
Plus the only shit he was selling me was a space suit and a red and green ski outfit
---
I think the method to farm him was patched out :(
---
You don't get banned for toxic behavior, what did you say in your message to him ? Whatever you said got you banned.
---
Try ft and maybe not be on a team? Never give up! Lol no worries, if so great! If not ill still let you look thru my stuff if you got stuff to trade
---
VE gat plasma for the wendigo spawns, and a V ffr gatling laser for Earle when I don't have time to repair/reload.
---
Agreed mate you might have just talked me into trying it out today lol
---
Yep. Also, I saved what‚Äôs her name‚Äôs spy-mom, and at the end they said she died. What??
---
I sent a wtf.
---
Pick up junk, don't pick up worthless outfits.
---
Don't understand what goes through their head, it's end game content for a reason, not for players who play the game for a week and want to do Colossal and the Queen
---
That reminds me: I was on the center drum wearing the Chally mask with the pink Captain Cosmos outfit and someone called me a Cow-er Ranger.
---
I believe in you too! Go get it.

Poor vendor bot blew up cuz he was out so long, gonna have to look for another one now lol
---
Exactly and I‚Äôm just like when that happen

Ignore the people saying Crit builds aren't viable. They are completely viable... Crit spamming is a great way to boost your damage. And don't worry about build viability... Just make sure to be using the cards that boost the damage of your weapon of choice and you'll be good. Hell, you don't even need to go that far, you'll just have to farm ammo more often.
---
This sub is starting to get ridiculous in terms of what they mean by viability. Just because stealth commando has the highest DPS doesn't mean it's the only viable build. Not every build needs to be able to solo Scorched Earth ffs.
---
You just said WTF to him ? smh .. that shouldn't have got you banned, but xbox live is pretty strict I guess.
---
 Not really de answer to your question but I believe you get a set of ultracite armor by completing the brotherhood story line
---
Yeah at the very least they need to buff All damage perks from 20% to 30% in tandem with the damage nerf, we shouldn't be punished for building our characters properly üòê
---
You can get a fair amount from the cave in the south east ‚Äúglassed cavern‚Äù but unfortunately the excavator armor doesn‚Äôt increase the amount you can harvest but still smelting it down with super duper still helps plenty. I don‚Äôt go for it very often so there may be better ways of farming but it works enough for me
---
Tim Cain (original creator of Fallout) gave an excellent talk about how RPGs must react in a big way to every choice the player makes. I love this video and I wish Bethesda would take some of this to heart for Fallout 76 https://youtu.be/MEewLWDpscA
---
Lode Bearing event and on the ground around fissure sites. If a Scorchbeast pops out, don‚Äôt forget their wings junk ultracite.
---
You‚Äôll need acid and 4 ore to make it.
---
I was on the stage, drumming, and then I fell to the ground.
---
I take back what I said. The helmet removes all facial hair. Classic Bethesda strikes again.
---
I guess they might be doubling down with gamepass. No profanity, even abbreviations lol
---
I think i have about 100 or so. I find them mostly near the fissure sites. Take them from scorchbeast wings and the ore nearby. Also, hardened mass scraps into ultracite. 
---
If your on Xbox, I can give you a bit.
---
Have you done the BOS quests? At the end you get a full suit of level 50 ultracite PA on a chassis.
---
Other than that, if you want to be as tanky as possible T-51b is the best non bullion power armor for a tank. It has better damage resist and energy resist combined than any other non bullion PA but lower rad resist
---
This is hilarious, and too true!
---
I run fist weapons partially because it's pretty funny to be hitting huge ass beasts with knuckles and actually see decent damage. 
---
It's like people who beefed the fuck out of the dinner knife in Skyrim
---
What would you like to see in terms of good content?
---
As long as I‚Äôm within 10 levels, I‚Äôm good. I don‚Äôt mind atom skipping those since it‚Äôll be even with the atom rewards I got from the game.
---
Update: had a nice group of people who actually completed it now I feel silly for ranting.
---
Wow, normally that ban you for using for words, calling someone gay etc .. wtf technically shouldn't have gotten you banned, but hey .. I like to taunt them and them report them .. send them a message without using profanity ..
---
This. I don‚Äôt ever ‚Äògrief‚Äô anyone, if someone watches me die then steals my junk when i die in a battle, he should spend them on camp restoration.
---
I was definitely expecting the quarry from NV but instead got Stripe in his dog house from Old World Blues.
---
I guess I haven‚Äôt done that one yet? I no longer have main quests, and none of the sides I have pertain to the BoS. Maybe I haven‚Äôt picked up their quest or something?
---
Cryo with minigun and UC GL barrel? Lol, that‚Äôs the weapon I wanna use
---
Wanamango plushie? Oh no that means I need to grind the event not only for my plus e collection but my fo2 nostalgia
---
Pretty sure that is a hunting rifle.
---
What the hell is that?!?
---
Add a lot of randoms as friends. Then just use the social menu and join them until you run out.
---
Basic skins yea, like paint, I‚Äôm talking about ones that change the look of the armor entirely. Like how the Red Scare skin changes the look of any power armor to that skin.
---
It's one of the best things when someone messages you about your camp then the rest of their team shows up and walks around for a while
---
I wish I was now lol I‚Äôm on PC. Thank you though!
---
Hacked weapon for sure. A Cryolator with a minigun barrel and beam splitter.... You report them by either mousing over them on the map or finding them in the recent list in your social tab.
---
That‚Äôs why I said they might have done the reporting. Since a wtf hasnt triggered anything before for me
---
I‚Äôve taken him down on the PTS. It‚Äôs fine.
---
Then again the PTS is virtually all hardcore players.
---
I guess I somehow missed the BoS quest line somehow...
---
Thank God the event is over.  My camp is on the lake in the Divide that was a spot for Primal Cuts.  I eventually gave up repairing, and have been in rubble for a week.
---
U could emote them :(
---
I think some of the rewards in ‚ÄúArmor Ace‚Äù for next season completely reskin a couple sets.
---
I got the plan for it but doubt I'd ever use the weapon tbh. For the record I like that there are some things in the game that have really low drop rates. As frustrating as it is to not be able to get absolutely everything easily, the feeling when you do actually get something rare is hard to come by in games IMHO.
---
Ok, well, hit the fussure sites and any nuked areas. Should be able to stack them up quick.
---
Do the special arrows you can use with the compound have a decent impact? Or basically worthless?
---
If so, I‚Äôll be very happy.
---
We've had 4. The olive green color, the riot shoulders, the elite one, and the desert color. When we got those, that was it, so if you didn't   want an armor that came from New Vegas, you were out of luck.
---
However, I they rereleased them to be purchased separately as a FO1st exclusive, that would be great.
---
im scared to try this bc i dont wanna accidentally initiate pvp and get destroyed
---
Lmao. The absurdity of hacked weapons
---
That's good to know.  
---
I wonder what happens to people who're taking some time off this game, after finishing the run.  If they don't come back until next season, are they out of luck?
---
THE CLOWN ANIMATRONIC
---
No, they're supposed to join it, have a horrible time and come here and complain about the respawn timer. That's the natural order of things.
---
ive had the chally head with pink cosmos outfit on too. twinning!
---
I set up a camp at the big raider windmill just above Top of the World. There are 4 raider npc‚Äôs that spawn there, and they‚Äôll even walk around on structures you build. So you can have a raider camp that‚Äôs actually occupied.
---
You can actually buy 3 more if you have enough, since you get 500 for hitting tier 100
---
His example was a black powder rifle crit build. I raise you 4 lv 62 ghouls. His build isn't viable to fight them, as in he will struggle, and likely die.
---
Whats your definition of viable? 
---
Crit builds rely on optimization between semi auto low vats cost and frequency of crits being available. Ideally, this would be one crit per two to three shots, using pistols.
---
Even on pistol crit specced characters (I run one), the crit isn't extremely useful. I do not consider it a crit build, so much as a pistol build that plays to its strengths.
---
It's probably a similar issue to when the damage registration nopes anything significant.
---
Thank you seem like this worked!
---
Yup even article said the last one was at noon but he just left lol
---
It's a work of art for sure!
---
It‚Äôs Beth‚Äôs fault for not lvl locking it, like all good games do!
---
thank god for that. I was never gonna use that suit without the helmet
---
Why bother reviving them?  If they showed up unqualified for end game, let them die.
---
I did! That was a good one!
---
You'll have a bad time getting mods for it unless you can find someone to mod it for you. T-45 or above are at the damage reduction soft cap so just pick whichever you think looks coolest.
---
I didn't do a single thing for meat week and it was insanely relaxing since all I've seen on here is people freaking out :)
---
Ill be on when you are tonight. Gt narmyknight can do for free as well. Shouldnt be too difficult.
---
Me, lev 212, and some 550 level killed the Earle today... 10000 rounds of 5mm from me, and a Bloodied death stick on the 550 lev character. Fist time I ever slayed him.., Then couldn‚Äôt make it out of the mine in time.... aaarrghhgra!!!
---
Bethesda is bad at clocks and calendars. It ran from August 20 to 26. It started and ended at noon, so 12 hours on 20th and 12 hours on the 26th. All other days, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 it was 24 hours.
---
So what's my point?
---
That's only 144 hours combined... or six days. That's not a week. It either should have started at midnight and ended at midnight, or gone on until Thursday at noon to make it an actual week. Just because it was 7 days doesn't make it a week.
---
And yes, I sent this feedback to Bethesda.
---
That reminds me of the wacky weapons mod for fo4 üò≥
---
I‚Äôve had this same bug occur at that location and the enemy just paced underground in that spot, if you jump servers it should move the quest to another location and you can complete it.
---
I spit out my tea all over the counter from this!
---
This is correct, you get a full set as a reward for completing Belly of the beast when you return to Fort Defiance. It's given to you as "power armor chassis" so if you don't have this you may have thrown it by mistake and you unknowingly already had a full set. I think the only place to mine Ultracite if I'm not mistaken is the glass cavern in cranberry bog or you get given some scrap for completing Scorched Earth.
---
Beam splitting cryomini gun. When you absolutely have to drop the entire room to 0 degrees kelvin.
---
Ooooh no! How do I start the quest?
---
But technically speaking they could make more skins because the armor is riot armor and is used by exleast whay it looks like multiple police departments and could have many different variations and paint jobs
---
Or make nocturnal worth a damn too, not a double edged blade. It's useless on a game that doesn't have a wait/sleep option.
---
After the first couple of minutes, we just left them. I was hoping maybe they were overpowered mules pulling some serious weaponry.  Wrong on all counts.
---
Some two-shots, stalker, executioners... They do the job. But people just need to min-max.
---
Don't blame the low-levels.  Blame a shitty mechanic for doing the instance.  
---
This should be like any end game run in other games.  You form a group, you do the pre-requisites (launch the nuke) and you do the instance...as the group that originally formed.  You don't just haphazardly do a first come first served BS instance.  
---
It's lazy game mechanics.
---
Yeah, you might have to scroll to certain section of the pip-boy, it's been in all the 3rd person fallout games so you get used to it, and I never said the bugs were your fault, I said that it's nobody else's fault you missed the event, I can see your not just trying to be a prick because you actually brought up something I said in a positive way(the clock), but at least to some degree you have to admit I'm right
---
-I wish we were going to Candy Apple Island.
---
-- Candy Apple Island? What do they got there? 
---
-Deathclaws. But they aren't so big. 
---
.
---
-HE SAID IT WAS JUST A NAME!
---
--What he meant was "Deathclaw Island" is actually a peninsula!
---
I don't even try to make it out. I'll scavenge screws and then just enter the exit tunnel. Still get all of the rewards, etc.
---
So. Meat "week" doesn't last a whole week? Because I think it started last week about 1.30am Friday morning Sydney time, and it's only 10am Thursday now... That's disappointing as I was hoping to do a few more when I got home from work tonight. I have everything but two Tenderizer mods though so I probably wouldn't have gotten those plans anyway.
---
And i do have fallout 1st
---
The market is saturated with hacked weapons and they are freely available almost to anyone. They wont ban anyone for having them - They would have to ban like 80% of the player base.  
---
Another note, how do you know it was HIM who killed the boss? Just because he has a hacked weapon? 98% of hacked weapons are SHIT.   
---
Most likely scenario - someone used Magic weapon (yeah, google it), or someone used a private hack to instantly kill the boss. You got mad because you did not get any reward so you went and checked other people's weapons and saw a guy with an unusual weapon.  
---
So you made a screenshot, having literally no proof, blaming and shaming him publicly asking for him to get banned.   
---
I can assure you, if someone has a GOOD hacked weapon, they won't kill the boss and be just standing there - they switch them.  
---
Tldr - you are little whiny Karen
---
It's a lot to spend in order to get blue balled.
---
I started romancing Preston on one of my playthroughs and he turned all creepy stalker on me. Every time I'd see him he was all like, fuck your dead husband, I need to know what you think of me right now. So I sent him to a far away camp and never talked to him again. He was the only romanceable companion that I couldn't bring my self to role play romancing on any of my characters.
---
If you have the tenderizer plans (spicy, peppered, salty), w hould you save them for me?  
---
My power is out for at least the next few hours or I would jump in and check out what you have.
---
Haha bloodied build
---
For the record, with class freak on the energy damage reduction is significantly lower.
---
Yep, this. It's a waste of stims.
---
I'm all for fixing bugs but what is this fast travelling bug? I've genuinely not heard of it
---
I will drink to that plan. Luckily the BOS will pay the tab.
---
Me with tears in eyes: sit down and let me tell you a story of a legend.
---
*motorcycle engine and explosion intensifies*
---
I dont think people are categorically saying its bad. It will bring stronger enemies while nerfing player weapon damage, especially the extreme buffs that today's meta permits.
---
i have plans you get fro m the gifts
---
so mounted creatures and some weapon and armour plans
---
Matriarchs are in the game they just look different
---
I run Gat build, it's pretty good but if you're keen on aiming for precision I recommend a magazine over the drum. Drum blocks the sight I have. 
---
It also has really bad range. Damage falloff starts at about 30 ft even on long barrel.
---
Max air conditioning
---
Yo that sounds ugly lmfao
---
I mean to be realistic it should turn to ash
---
Four heads are better than two!
---
That was me also. Lunch break, working from home, logged in and ran hoping to hear Graham's voice tell me about Prizes.  Ran up the deck, grabbed the spit handle and poof.... I just stood there for a while, sad.
---
So how will the damage on bloodied be affected?
---
I went with my lvl 35 alt half vanguard set and a magic shotgun to farm screws, didn't die once and got the reclaimed mask üòÅ
---
I don't even mean optimized. At least something between "Food build" and optimized.
---
Make posts teaching low-levels players how to help if it's an issue
---
Let me guess - you‚Äôre a whiny bloodied build scared that everything‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBuLlEt sPoNgE‚Äù because it takes an extra 2 shots to kill everything
---
I'm glad its working out for you!
---
For the record I just server hop till I see a nuke zone for SBQ and get violet there
---
More ghillie, we need more ghillie. Ok seriously, Bethesda we are good on ghillie.
---
Only placing the Ammo Factory back will slowly clear any and all ghost budget. Moving the CAMP will delete that single machine but also put that 0.6% back into your Stored budget. Also, clearing the budget by moving the CAMP seems to only work on consoles.
---
Yeah, that person was definitely nice, so that's why I felt terrible afterwards. Now I know, and I hope they don't think I was intentionally being rude. Maybe they'll see this, doubt it, but one can hope :)
---
Here's an option for them. Buy the game on PC, because we don't have any trouble completing the event and welcome low levels to join us since we don't need a full team to be successful. It's funny having them along for the ride.
---
Got it.  I have all of those.  A lot of people give them to new characters emerging from Vault 76. 
---
Thanks for the response.  I appreciate it!!
---
Pipe revolver :D , im dying.
---
Hit up every player vendor you see, you can probably find a plan.
---
I'm not even talking about going for max damage, just somewhere between "food build" and optimized.
---
Over already? I did 4 times as many  fasnacht events during the same time it feels like.  And I only played slightly less during this event.
---
Looks like you‚Äôre right. The quest is completed and I don‚Äôt have any PA chassis with that armor...Guess it‚Äôs off to farm the cavern.
---
Its what we do... well what some of us do
---
It‚Äôs when you try to fast travel and the only thing that happens is the map closing. So have to try and do it again. This can happen many times in a row. My streak is 7 in a row.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm 4 spaces ahead now... I was tied with him 1 or 2 days ago and definitely didn‚Äôt rank up 4 times
---
Lmao his gamer tag is in the picture.
---
I'm fairly certain it is the only thing marked very hard. I might be wrong and queen/Encrypted is as well but very hard should not mean sub level 50. As a main it should mean 100+
---
Oh no not my precious bloodied lol
---
Yah I scrapped that machine a few weeks ago.  I gave it a try, but my play time is so limited I can‚Äôt spend time button smashing to convert such small amounts of ammo.  I just buy it from player vendors instead.
---
Those were some nasty fuckers. Still remember when i first encountered them down in the Wanamingo mine at Redding.
---
Edit: The Mine was in Redding and not in Broken Hills.
---
They need a trading system like borderlands
---
Another option to consider is to switch to big guns (i.e. 50 cal).  It uses many of the same perk points as melee and shotgunner.
---
Ah. Never really had it happen. That sh1t sounds annoying tho
---
